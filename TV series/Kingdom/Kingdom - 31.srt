1
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:12,375
[QIANG XIANG] If "gods of war"
really do exist,

2
00:00:12,458 --> 00:00:15,125
we can't compete on the
length of our breath.

3
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:19,583
So we'll just compete
on depth, that is all.

4
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:21,458
[QIANG XIANG]
That'll be your time, Lei.

5
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:27,333
[QIANG XIANG] They say you can
already breathe more deeply

6
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:29,666
than any Chi You in history.

7
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:35,166
Not even a god of war,
you understand?

8
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:06,416
[QIANG XIANG] So as long
as the duel is a short one,

9
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,750
you won't lose to anybody,
not even a god of war.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,958
[QIANG XIANG]
Lei.

11
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:33,666
[QIANG LEI]
It's time to dance, Lu Sui!

12
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:42,583
[NARRATOR]
The time: the Spring &amp; Autumn

13
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:44,625
and Warring States periods.

14
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:48,541
Xin, a nameless boy who rose to
the rank of squadron commander,

15
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:51,166
carried out a string of exploits
in the midst of battle

16
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,083
that brought the
Qin army an advantage.

17
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:56,041
However, the enemy's
commanding general

18
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:57,416
has appeared at last,

19
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,041
and has proven to be
beyond all imagination.

20
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:02,958
That man, said to have a
previous tie to Wang Yi,

21
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:04,583
is named Pang Nuan.

22
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:08,250
The war situation is
on the verge of change!

23
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,958
[WANG YI]
Where did the gong ring?

24
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,666
[TENG] Sir, Lu Wuwei
and Gan Yang's camp,

25
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,916
if I'm not mistaken.

26
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,208
[WEN] But it stopped
immediately after.

27
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,666
It'd be strange
for them to attack

28
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,791
hours after retreating.
It may be a false alarm.

29
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,625
[WANG YI] If it isn't...

30
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:07,458
[WANG YI] ...then perhaps
Pang Nuan has appeared.

31
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,500
Finally.

32
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,208
[WEN] Pang Nuan, Sir?

33
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:14,000
[TENG] This does not
quite feel right, though.

34
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,458
I had assumed he was
conserving his strength

35
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:19,000
for his duel with you, my lord.

36
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,833
[WANG YI] It's possible
that he mistakenly thought

37
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,583
I was there, I suppose.

38
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:27,333
A strange intuition
seems to be at work in him.

39
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:28,833
Shall we move out, Sir?

40
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,416
[WANG YI] No.

41
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,666
We can't very well mobilize our
main force on just speculation.

42
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:39,958
[WANG YI] Even if something
is happening there right now,

43
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:45,541
we will have to trust our men
at the front lines to handle it.

44
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:50,500
[QIANG LEI]
Pum, pa-rum. Pum, pa-rum.

45
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,875
Pum, pa-rum.

46
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:56,958
Pum, pa-rum. Pum, pa-rum.

47
00:04:57,041 --> 00:05:00,958
[QIANG LEI]
Pum, pa-rum. Pum, pa-rum.

48
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,458
[QIANG LEI] Pum, pa-rum.

49
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,958
[WEI PING]
Q-Qiang Lei... is great!

50
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:12,958
That's it!

51
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:15,625
It's like the war
with Wei again!

52
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,375
Is that a sword technique?

53
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:20,625
Those moves--They almost
look like a dance!

54
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:25,416
[CHONG YUAN] Unpredictable
movements, changes in speed...

55
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,250
And he reacts like he knows
what Pang Nuan will do next!

56
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,583
[CHONG YUAN] It may look
like a beautiful dance,

57
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:34,083
but that technique
just isn't human!

58
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:42,833
[QIANG LEI]
Pum, pa-rum. Pum, pa-rum.

59
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,625
Pum, pa-rum...

60
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:49,958
[PANG NUAN] I see. Thou art
an exorcist of gods, then.

61
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:53,875
I came thinking thou wert him...

62
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:56,708
But is this providence?

63
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:59,750
[PANG NUAN]
O thou exorcist of gods,

64
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:03,833
thou art indeed
one of mine enemies.

65
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:07,333
This night... is for us.

66
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:11,791
I who house a savage god
and thou who exorcise them.

67
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,291
I shall demonstrate beyond doubt

68
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:18,166
which is the powerful one
chosen by the heavens.

69
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:26,833
[QIANG LEI]
Have no fear, Lu Sui.

70
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:29,333
I am with you now.

71
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:32,583
Bring me the
life-breath of the gods.

72
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:36,041
Just make it deep, and fierce...

73
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,791
If we do that,
there will be no one

74
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:41,708
who can match us! Now!

75
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:51,875
[CHONG YUAN]
What amazing speed!

76
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:52,666
Wow!

77
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,708
Go, Lieutenant Qiang Lei!

78
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,000
[QIANG LEI]
I'll settle this fast!

79
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:04,041
[QIANG LEI]
This sacred dance...

80
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,500
[QIANG LEI] ...is the
deepest I've ever done!

81
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:11,041
[QIANG XIANG] So as long
as the duel is a short one,

82
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:14,416
you won't lose to anybody,
not even a god of war.

83
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,166
[QIANG LEI] You're mine!

84
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:28,000
[WEI PING]
Q-Qiang Lei's blow has...

85
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,000
[QIANG LEI] H-He stopped it?!

86
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:33,541
[PANG NUAN] Of course
thou art not the only one

87
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:37,083
with the ability to read
an enemy's movements.

88
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:11,250
[PANG NUAN] Thou art the first
to draw blood from me

89
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,291
in a long while.

90
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:16,708
And thou hast made me
sense death nearby,

91
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,958
if only for an instant...

92
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,916
[PANG NUAN] None hath
challenged me that much

93
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,708
since those two nine years ago.

94
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:31,791
[PANG NUAN] It hath been truly
worth my while to come here,

95
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:34,000
exorcist of gods.

96
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,541
[XIN] Qiang Lei!

97
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,416
[TIAN YOU] Xin?!

98
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,500
Run, Qiang Lei! Now!

99
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:44,916
[WEI DAO] S-Something's wrong
with Qiang Lei!

100
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,958
What's wrong?
Exhausted? Already?

101
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,875
Better not be, as there's
more yet to come.

102
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:06,666
[QIANG LEI]
My body feels... heavy...

103
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:12,291
[coughs]

104
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:15,083
[QIANG LEI]
The sacred dance has left me.

105
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:18,416
I took the exorcism deeper,
so the backlash is huge!

106
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,625
Now I can hardly breathe...

107
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:21,708
Lieutenant Qiang Lei!

108
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:23,166
Qiang Lei!

109
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,833
Run now, all of you, just go!

110
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:30,166
[QIANG LEI] Get going!
He's truly too much for us!

111
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,458
I'll hold out here
as long as I can.

112
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:35,250
You all use
that time to get away!

113
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:43,416
[QIANG LEI] I... can't
lose this place I've found!

114
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:52,500
[PANG NUAN] I shall not allow a
single one of you to leave here.

115
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:57,041
You must see our battle
through to its very end.

116
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,708
[SUBORDINATE 31A]
General Gan Yang!

117
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,416
The report I have also claims
the invader was a lone man!

118
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,000
[SUBORDINATE 31B] Crazy!

119
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:09,291
Are you suggesting one man wiped
out an entire unit of guards?!

120
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,333
That's impossible!

121
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:11,833
[SUBORDINATE 31C] Urgent report!

122
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:17,666
My general, there's been an
enemy invasion with casualties!

123
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,916
[SUBORDINATE 31B] What?
How many Zhao soldiers?!

124
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,041
Well, Sir, just one large man.

125
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,500
Bring me my horse!

126
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:25,541
[SUBORDINATE 31D] Yes, Sir!

127
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,083
Go tell Lu Wuwei
that he is here now.

128
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,583
Yes, Sir!

129
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,500
[GAN YANG] No doubt about it:
It's Pang Nuan.

130
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:36,625
I don't know what made him
show up out of the blue,

131
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:41,375
but what I do know is that
if we defeat him this war ends.

132
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:42,750
[signal sounding]

133
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,250
The enemy invasion signal!

134
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,208
I can hear fighting, as well.

135
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,791
The general!

136
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:51,333
This signal is for
a real enemy attack!

137
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,208
[screaming]

138
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:00,833
[WAN JI]
Kill all the Qin dogs now.

139
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,541
It's time they learn
the very depths

140
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:05,375
of Zhao's grudge for
all of them.

141
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,916
[NARRATOR] Qin's armies
were thrown into confusion

142
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,583
by the sudden assaults
of Pang Nuan and Wan Ji.

143
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:14,041
But Zhao's own armies
were also struggling

144
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,166
to understand the situation.

145
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,125
[ZHAO ZHUANG] So you came
here, too, Gongsun Long.

146
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,208
[GONGSUN LONG] Ah, Zhao Zhuang.

147
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:26,375
I hear General Pang Nuan
moved out all by himself!

148
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:28,416
What is going on?

149
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,000
I don't know, either.

150
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,125
[GONGSUN LONG] You realize
that if Pang Nuan is slain,

151
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,500
the war is over?!

152
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:34,875
I know that.

153
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:37,875
I feel a bit relieved
now that I'm here, though.

154
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,916
Besides, where
General Pang Nuan is,

155
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,458
the mountains
are perfectly still.

156
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:45,958
[ZHAO ZHUANG] No one is moving.
Or rather, no one can manage to.

157
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,083
[NARRATOR]
Just as Zhao Zhuang said,

158
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,541
even after the various
generals' camps found out

159
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,791
where the night raid
was occurring,

160
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,666
none of them rushed
to the scene.

161
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:59,458
In fact, they fortified their
own defenses instead.

162
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,458
This was because at the time,

163
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,416
not one of them
had a clear grasp

164
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,625
of the relative locations
of every Qin camp.

165
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:09,458
Therefore each army
had no choice

166
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:13,791
but to be on guard
against an unseen enemy.

167
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,625
This night raid is
absolutely unexpected,

168
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:19,458
but it could prove
surprisingly successful.

169
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:22,541
This is no time for
such sheer complacency!

170
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:25,375
Yes, Wan Ji is in pursuit,
but the fact remains

171
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:29,000
that our commanding general
is currently in enemy camp!

172
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:32,250
So you do not trust
in Pang Nuan's power?

173
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:35,875
It's not as though
I've witnessed it myself.

174
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:39,250
And no one knows what may or
may not happen in war.

175
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,208
[ZHAO ZHUANG] Yes, no one
knows what may happen in war.

176
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:49,791
Not Zhao's armies,
and not Qin's.

177
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,875
What's a Zhao cavalry
doing here?!

178
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,625
They've come to take us out.

179
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:04,791
And so... are we done for?

180
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:07,291
[SOLDIERS gasping]

181
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:31,833
Wan Ji?

182
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,000
Here they come!

183
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,541
W-We're done for!

No!

[SUBORDINATE 31D]
General Gan Yang,

190
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,416
the enemy has
around 500 horsemen.

191
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,416
We only have 100.

192

And on top of all of that,
they have him!

is quite weak!

[WEI PING] Aw man,
what do we do about this?

00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:05,250
The armies are fighting
evenly, but... but...

237
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,291
[QU HAI] We outnumber them
since we've got infantry,

238
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,791
but Zhao's horsemen
are tougher than we thought!

239
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,583
[PEI LANG]
Sometimes a few of our men

240
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,458
break through their cavalry...

241
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,750
[PEI LANG] ...but they just
end up cut down by that guy.

The way things stand now,

243
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,375
I know we definitely
gotta fight,

244
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:28,208
but how are we supposed
to beat a monster like that?

245
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:34,541
[XIN] It's okay.

246
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,041
[XIN] Yeah, he's crazy strong,

247
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:39,875
and he's calling himself
a damn war god or whatever.

248
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:43,791
But he's still human
just like us!

249
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:48,000
[XIN] If we cut him
real good, he will die!

250
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,666
[XIN] If a sword can
kill him then we can do this!

251
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,500
Let's go!

252
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:52,833
[CHONG YUAN] Hold it.

253
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,875
[CHONG YUAN] I understand,
but keep a cool head.

254
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:58,250
We can't kill that man by
just rushing in willy-nilly.

255
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:01,333
And if we fail,
we're surely all dead!

256
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:04,958
I already know that,
Chong Yuan.

257
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,458
However, in the
fight with Feng Ji,

258
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:11,500
[XIN] how many lives
did we lose killing one man

259
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,708
surrounded by
an army of 20,000?

260
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,166
The central and right forces

261
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,833
couldn't kill
their enemy general

262
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,458
despite sacrificing
tens of thousands.

263
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,166
That's how war is!

264
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:26,125
But right now,
a prize general who oughta be

265
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:32,000
in an army of 120,000
is standing in front of us!

266
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,541
A prize general...

267
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,791
Can't pass that up, can we?

268
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:43,666
[XIN] No one needs to
tell me this is dangerous.

269
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:47,666
But we've gotta do it anyway.

270
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,416
[XIN]
If I start running away now,

271
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,625
I haven't got a prayer of being
the world's greatest general!

272
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:54,666
[XIN] But...

273
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:01,166
[XIN]
But... Chong Yuan is right.

274
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,000
We're up against
a real ugly customer.

275
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:07,625
Anybody who really needs
to get home alive can bow out.

276
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,416
I won't complain.

277
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:20,208
[WEI PING] Still dumb as a box
of rocks, aren't we, everyone?

278
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:24,750
You think anybody'd bow out
after coming this far?

279
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:28,041
Too late to fuss over us.
It's just creepy now!

280
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,333
Oh come on.

281
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:30,291
I'm in.

282
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:31,625
[TIAN YOU] Chong Yuan.

283
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:34,708
I'm not going against the
commander's decision.

284
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:38,000
Right! Enough of this yakking!
Instead, let's go!

285

Grab this war's
top honors right now!

286
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,666
That'll avenge our
dead comrades, too.

287
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,000
It's a two for one deal.

288
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,041

But my breath is not
coming back soon now.

292
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:56,708
I suggest you do not
count on my power.

293
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,041
Not gonna.

294
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:02,166
[XIN] I wasn't too awake
for your fight, Qiang Lei,

295
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,125
but I was watching.

296
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,291
[XIN] You fought to your limits
to protect us, didn't you?

297
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,666
Just rest now.

298
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:16,500
[XIN] I'll take down
that monster! He's done!

299
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:19,541
I'm counting on the power
of your unity today!

are behaving strangely.

[LORD CHANGWEN]
A trap?

304

Too many of their movements
defy explanation.

305

General Wang Yi has noticed

306

the disquieting behavior,
but then...

307

It will be unpredictable.

Yes. As ruler of the kingdom,

311
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:55,500
I must never
be complacent in war.

312
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:56,541
[LORD CHANGWEN]
Sire.

313
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,291
[ZHENG] By the way,

314
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:02,541
I'm told his squadron received
a name from General Wang Yi?

315
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:03,958
You mean Xin?

316
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:07,500
Yes, the name
is "Fei Xin Force."

317
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:10,458
A good name.
It suits him very well.

318
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,625
[PIAO] Your Majesty...

319
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:18,208
If anything should happen
to me, please, trust in Xin.

320
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:22,333
I'm certain he'll soar
higher than anyone!

321
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:26,666
[ZHENG] I remember, Piao.

322
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:38,000
[GAN YANG]
This one is quite strong!

323
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:41,458
I can't believe I've been halted
within sight of Pang Nuan.

324
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:45,208
[GAN YANG] Hmm?
Xin of the Fei Xin Force...

325
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:47,791
Why is he just
standing there?

326
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:50,500
Can he be waiting
for something?

327
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:56,583
[XIN] Okay, let's start this!

328
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,708
[whistle blows]

329
00:21:58,791 --> 00:21:59,833
[WEI PING] There!

330
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:01,208
The signal!

331
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,250
Here we go!

332
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:07,916
[SOLDIERS yelling]

333
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:09,916
What?!

334
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:13,958
[XIN]
At the sound of Shi's whistle,

335
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:17,125
all three units
head for Pang Nuan at once.

336
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:19,625
You guys brought off
the assault on Feng Ji,

337
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:20,875
so this'll be fine.

338
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:22,500
When you break
past the cavalry,

339
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:24,708
throw spears at him with
all you've got

340
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:26,791
from all three directions!

341
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:33,833
Don't flinch! Keep it up!

342
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:40,083
[XIN] Simultaneous attacks
on three fronts...

343
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:42,708
Even that may not
work on him.

344
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:45,041
[XIN] But if you keep on
throwing anyway,

345
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:47,958
Pang Nuan will focus
his attention on you...

346
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:53,500
[XIN] ...and he won't notice
me coming from behind!

347
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:56,333
No, knowing him, he will!

348
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:59,500
It isn't his attack strength
that's the real problem.

349
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:01,500
It's that defensive
strength that held up

350
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:03,875
against Qiang Lei's dance!

351
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:08,416
So I'll manipulate him
into this spin-and-strike!

352
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,500
He's on to us?!

353
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:10,708
Xin!

354
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:12,708
[QIANG LEI]
No, Pang Nuan's swinging late!

355
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,083
That means-- 

356
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:54,666
[WEI PING] We are gonna
see Xin through all of this

357
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:57,541
as his buds from
Cheng Hu Village!

358
00:24:57,625 --> 00:25:02,041
[NARRATOR] I won't let you die,
even if it costs me my life!

359
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:05,083
Next Time:
"The Fei Xin Force on the Run."
