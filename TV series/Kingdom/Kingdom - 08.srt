to another beside the King...

[NARRATOR]
Ancient China...

6
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:36,458
The time of the sages was over,
swept away by base human greed.

7
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:39,208
Over five centuries,
an endless storm of war,

8
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:41,833
hatred, and strife
raged across the land.

9
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,375
Over a hundred nations fell,

10
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:46,083
winnowed away until
only seven remained.

11

Now, from Qin,
the westernmost kingdom,

12
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:51,166
a great wind of history
is about to blow.

13
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,916
This is the tale of a
nameless boy and a young King

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,958
who ran the gauntlet
in this age of strife.

[XIN] Little Lord Bi, now,
why'd you come along again?

18
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:57,166
Because only you two
going alone worries me.

19
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,208
And don't you call me
"Little Lord"!

20
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:03,500
[XIN] Ha! Whatever, but hurry up
or we'll leave you behind.

Damn it. Damn it!

Hey guys, I wonder what

25
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,666
the mountain king's
nation is like.

Do you think... there are
big castles and all of that?

No. To be blunt, I doubt
there is much to it.

00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:39,291
[BI] Judging by their dress,
their standard of living

29
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,708
isn't at all high.

30
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,833
It's likely on the order
of a country village,

31
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:46,250
rather than a nation.

32
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:49,666
If we can only sneak in,
the rescue shouldn't be hard.

33

Uh, how is this like
a country village?

that you three will soon
be judged by our king,

00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
That's enough!

160
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,208
We just screwed up a little bit.

161
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,791
A little bit?

162
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,250
[YANG DUANHE]
Do it.

163
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:07,541
[DIAO screams]

164
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:10,958
I'm first?! No!

165
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,916
[ZHENG]
There's no need to do that.

166
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,208
I know, that pain
well enough myself.

167
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,916
[ZHENG]
Mountain king, hear me.

168
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,875
If a king takes up the sword
driven by grudges or enmity,

169
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,291
his hate will then drives
his kingdom to fall.

170
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,833
A king's duty,
is to take a sword

171
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,541
to cut out a path
to give only life.

172
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,833
[YANG DUANHE]
What does this mean?

173
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,416
It is because they are divided,

174
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,375
that there's friction between
mountain folk and Qin folk.

175
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:44,291
Yet, because it's
always been so,

176
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:47,333
it's come to seem
entirely natural.

177
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:50,000
The same is true of
all the Middle Kingdom.

178
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:53,666
The plains folk, who must
seem all one people to you,

179
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,041
keep endlessly pillaging
and killing one another.

180
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,583
As the turbulence worsened,

181
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:01,041
we've built long walls
on the borders,

182
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:04,041
making inside and outside,
friend and foe,

183
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,958
all the more explicit.

184
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:09,958
A rare leader, like
Duke Mu, did indeed appear

185
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:13,583
becoming leader over many
lands, yet ultimately,

186
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:17,083
even he provided no more
than temporary stability.

187
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,833
But that alone
isn't good enough.

188
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:22,166
What's not good enough?!

189
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,750
What do you think you
know about Duke Mu?

190
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:28,166
If peace was achieved even
temporarily, that's amazing!

191
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,333
What more are you
saying he could've done?!

192
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,666
The abolition of all borders!

193
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:42,291
Eliminating borders?

194
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:48,333
[YANG DUANHE]
King of Qin, look around.

195
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:53,208
Do you think even a single
kingdom will accept that notion?

196
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:56,333
If they can't, I'll do
it by cultivating power.

197
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:58,791
As suits a world at war.

198
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,958
[YANG DUANHE] That sounds
like the very opposite

199
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:04,041
of "a path to give life."

200
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,250
[ZHENG]
No!

201
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:08,166
For 500 years,
turmoil has reigned,

202
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,333
which means it could
go on for 500 more.

203
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:14,666
I take up the sword
to prevent those sacrifices

204
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,916
of the next 500 years!

205
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:22,958
Just hold on!

206
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,458
What in the world are
you talking about?

207
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,500
[ZHENG]
I'm talking about my aims.

208
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,333
[XIN]
Your aim is the throne stolen

209
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,666
by your younger brother, right?

210
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,458
Didn't you come to ask
for reinforcements

211
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,125
to take the throne back?

212
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:39,625
The jeweled throne is just
the first step on my path.

213
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,583
You have a path?

214
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:44,041
What on earth do you
mean "your path"?

215
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,833
I'll become the first King
to unite the Middle Kingdom!

216
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,250
Unite the...

217
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,125
...Middle Kingdom?

218
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,708
Does that mean destroying
the other kingdoms

219
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:58,041
and bringing them under Qin?

220
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:58,916
It does.

221
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,500
That cannot possibly happen...

222
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:05,208
In 500 years-- No, going
back even further...

223
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:08,375
Such a thing's never,
ever been attempted!

224
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,041
That's what I'll do.

225
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:14,000
With all united, there'll be
no conflict anymore,

226
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:17,583
and people of every land will
see their horizons broadened!

227
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,916
[YANG DUANHE]
Their horizons broadened...

228
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,583
[YOUNG YANG DUANHE]
Grandfathers, why don't we

229
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,166
conquer Qin?

230
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,916
[ELDER A] O-ho!
That's our Yang Duanhe!

231
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,500
[ELDER B] That ambition
is admirable, Your Highness.

232
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:41,916
But please be a little more
patient for the time being.

233
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,708
In order to conquer Qin,

234
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:48,125
we must further strengthen
the mountain kingdom's power.

235
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,291
[YOUNG YANG DUANHE]
In that case, let us seek peace.

236
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,291
Wh-What are you saying?

237
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,833
Peace with the hated
Kingdom of Qin?

238
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:57,625
You must not utter such
words, Your Highness!

239
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:00,875
[ELDER A] All are glad that
for the first time in centuries

240
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:04,416
a king's arisen who binds
the mountain realm together.

241
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,625
[ELDER B] Our hopes are that
you, great Yang Duanhe, will be

242
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:11,916
the one to purge the regrets
of our ancestors and of today.

243
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,583
[YOUNG YANG DUANHE]
Grandfathers...

244
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,125
With each passing year,

245
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:19,500
the mountain kingdom's defenses
grow much sturdier.

246
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,083
[YOUNG YANG DUANHE] But with
this, I feel the constraints

247
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,416
of these mountains.

248
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,375
Whether by battle or peace--
by whatever means,

249
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:33,041
I simply want to
broaden my world.

250
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:45,041
[ELDER A]
What is taking so long, my king?

251
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,000
Now is the right time to pay off

252
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,125
the long-standing
grudges of our folk.

253
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:52,791
[ELDER B] This excess of
dialogue is unnecessary.

254
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:55,375
[ELDER A]
Since we elders remember deeply

255
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:59,916
our kindred's grievances
against Qin's people, though...

256
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,333
...allow us to make
this a fair judgment.

257
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,625
Let us skin Qin's
sovereign alive

258
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:09,375
and bare him to the sunlight.

259
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:14,000
[ELDER A] These three we'll
chop up and use as pig feed.

260
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,458
Who's gonna be pig feed?!

261
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:18,000
I'll kick you into tomorrow,
you old windbags!

262
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,583
[DIAO screams]

263
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,791
I'm first again?!

264
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,541
[XIN yells]

265
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,000
Ohhh...

266
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,166
Xin! When did you manage--

267
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,916
We figured this might happen.

268
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,958
Piao and I trained rope
escapes to perfection!

269
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,375
Are you serious?

270
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:43,041
How 'bout it, Zheng?
You nervous?

271
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,208
Not especially.

272
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,625
[XIN]
Huh?

273
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,750
Well, what are you all doing?
Seize them quickly!

274
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,916
Xin...

275
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,166
[YANG DUANHE]
Heh, heh.

276
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:03,625
An amusing boy, just as
Ba Jio's report said.

277
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:06,083
And? What will you do next?

278
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,166
[XIN]
Me? I won't do anything.

279
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,416
[YANG DUANHE]
What?

280
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,958
[XIN] If you won't
lend us your strength,

281
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:15,166
we'll head back down the
mountain and find someone else.

282
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,125
[XIN]
Granted there is no one left...

283
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:19,083
[ELDER A]
You fool!

284
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,791
You believe you can just
descend unharmed from here

285
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,791
just like that?! [screams]

286
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,916
[XIN] Or I could steal
a sword and raise hell.

287
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,541
But there are guys here
I really don't wanna fight.

288
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,041
There's no choice.

289
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,583
Guess I'll take you hostage,
old man and descend.

290
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:36,875
Eh?!

291
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,625
Hey! Guy in the
fancy general's mask!

292
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,916
You've been talking
all this complex talk

293
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,333
this whole time,

294
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,541
but to put it simply, this guy's
in trouble right now!

295
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,250
Just think of it
as a helping hand

296
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,083
and lend him support, huh?

297
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,708
That's the crudest persuasive
speech I've ever...

298
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,333
It's all over.

299
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:57,166
What's more, hook him up
with an agreement now,

300
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,125
and you just might get
a bigtime payback!

301
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,791
With treasures and
tasty food, too...

302
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:05,333
Stop with your cockiness,
flatlander monkey!

303
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,083
We'll slice the
lot of you up here

304
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,583
as sacrifices for our
forefathers' grievances--

305
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,125
[ELDER a screams]

306
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,375
Shut up with all
your "grievances!"

307
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,416
The greatest grievance of all

308
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,000
is when a dream ends up as
no more than an illusion.

309
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:25,125
If you really care about
the ones who died,

310
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:28,625
then turn what they dreamed
of into something real

311
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:31,041
and concrete, do you
all understand?!

312
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:42,291
[XIN] Whoa! What just
happened to the air in here?

313
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,708
[ZHENG]
Don't be dismayed.

314
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:47,083
For you, that was good work.

315
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:08,291
[ZHENG] Yang Duanhe,
king of the mountains.

316
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:12,333
For now, I am what you see: a
weak king, powerless before you.

317
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:16,333
But unifying the Middle Kingdom
is no empty delusion of a dream.

318
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,791
It is with certainty my path.

319
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:22,000
If you join me, you'll see a
broadening of your horizons

320
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:26,291
even greater than your
forefathers' spirits sought!

321
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:28,750
Revive the alliance
of four centuries ago

322
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,791
between Qin and
the mountain lands,

323
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:33,041
and lend me your strength.

324
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:45,291
[YANG DUANHE] I have
one question, King of Qin.

325
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:46,833
We are savage.

326
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:49,541
In your regaining the throne,
the Royal Court

327
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,791
may become a sea of blood.

328
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,833
You don't mind this?

329
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,083
Does that mean...

330
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,041
That's how it was taken from me.

331
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,958
Why should I balk at the same?

332
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:07,333
You can't!

333
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:09,541
You cannot, Your Highness!
Our forefathers--

334
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,333
[YANG DUANHE]
Silence!

335
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:12,750
Never again open your mouth

336
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:15,375
to spout nothing but
ancient grudges!

337
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:31,208
[XIN gasps]

338
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:34,208
Hear me, one and all, now!

339
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:36,708
Yang Duanhe, king of
the mountain realm,

340
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:40,833
binds herself to Ying Zheng,
King of Qin, in a firm alliance.

341
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:42,375
She... She's a woman!

342
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:44,500
[YANG DUANHE] In that
alliance's name, we will go

343
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:48,000
to regain the throne from
which he was unjustly driven.

344
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:51,416
Gather troops from the
surrounding heights!

345
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,791
All troops prepare to march,

346
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:55,000
with intentions to
fight to the death!

347
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:58,416
Our target is Qin's
capital at Xianyang!

348
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:04,833
[MEN cheer]

349
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:17,166
[ZHENG]
It begins now...

350
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:55,166
[XIN]
It's 3,000 against 80,000!

351
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,916
We haven't nearly enough!

352
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
[NARRATOR] Facing an
overwhelming disadvantage,

353
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:02,166
in their hearts lies only
an unshakeable readiness.

354
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,583
Next Time: Onto Xianyang
