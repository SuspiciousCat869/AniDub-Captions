[CHARIOT CAPTAIN 18A] Heh, heh!
Pesky little fly...

2
00:00:13,916 --> 00:00:17,333
I'll take his life myself;
just watch!

3
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:21,541
[XIN] With a horse's mobility
and this steel spear, I can...

4
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:22,458
...do it!

5
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:23,916
[XIN growls]

6
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:29,625
[XIN] I don't
care about you guys.

7
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:34,125
My opponent is this
freakin' annoying chariot!

8
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:37,000
[XIN yells,
CHARIOT SOLDIERS scream]

9
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:39,250
[CHARIOT CAPTAIN 18A screams]

10
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,541
The counterattack starts now!

11
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:45,000
[XIN yells]

12
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:49,333
[NARRATOR] Ancient China...

13
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:53,250
The time of the sages was over,
swept away by base human greed.

14
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:55,666
Over five long and
harrowing centuries,

15
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,291
an endless storm of war, hatred,
and strife

16
00:00:58,375 --> 00:00:59,583
raged across the land.

17
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,000
Over a hundred nations fell,

18
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:03,416
winnowed away until
only seven remained.

19
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,750
Now, from Qin,
the westernmost kingdom,

20
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:08,125
a great wind of history
is about to blow.

21
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:10,875
This is the tale of a
nameless boy and a young king

22
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:13,416
who ran the gauntlet
in this age of strife.

23
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,791
[yelling]

24
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:51,750
[WEI PING] Xin!

25
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:52,958
[XIN] Got it!

26
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,416
[XIN grunts]

27
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,708
[XIN gasps]

28
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:12,041
[XIN] So the others weren't
completely wiped out, then.

29
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,500
Okay!

30
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:16,416
[XIN] Well survived, men!

31
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,750
Just as I'd expected of the
valiant warriors of Qin!

32
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,875
We have a fresh force
over there battling hard!

33
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:26,083
All of you hurry over there
and fight by their sides!

34
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,666
Yes Sir! Where will
you be going, my lord?

35
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,125
[XIN gasps]

36
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,958
I'll join you after I bring
down the chariot that fled!

37
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:36,791
Come on! We have not
lost this battle yet!

38
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,291
This fight is just beginning!

39
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:41,041
[SOLDIERS cheer]

40
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,791
[Right, let's join
our brother army!

41
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,083
Lend the injured a hand!

42
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:47,500
Hey, Tian You.

43
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:50,500
That cavalryman wasn't wearing
armor. He was in rags!

44
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:56,083
Come to think of it, he reminded
me of that loudmouthed brat.

45
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:59,208
What in the world is
going on over here?

46
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,875
[horse whinnies]

47
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,125
[BI] We've lost too much
of the infantry.

48
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,083
[BI] Do you really think
we can bring down Wei

49
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,750
and all his troops like this?

50
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,625
Letting our soldiers
die in vain?

51
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,208
They are not dying in vain!

52
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:14,666
[BI gasps]

53
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:18,875
They're honorable deaths
for the sake of our victory.

54
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:22,083
Fu Hushen,
look at our circumstances.

55
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:24,333
Why do you not
doubt our victory?!

56
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:28,083
Is Lord Biao truly a general
worthy of such trust?!

57
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,541
Heh!

58
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,583
[FU HUSHEN] I do not
know any other general

59
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:36,041
who is so talented.

60
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,208
[NARRATOR]
After its attack on Xin

61
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,083
and the Fourth Army infantry,

62
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:48,500
the chariot squadron was now
exercising a crushing offensive,

63
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:51,875
attacking the Second
and First Armies.

64
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,416
Saying that the gap between

65
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,750
Qin's fighting strength and
Wei's had already determined

66
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,166
the outcome of the
battle would be fair.

67
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,041
In truth, Xin and the others

68
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:04,458
had only brought down one unit
of the main chariot squadron.

69
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:07,916
Theirs was an extremely
localized success.

70
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,875
It had no effect on the
larger picture whatsoever.

71
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,416
Now, Qin's forces clearly have
no strength left to resist us!

72
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,291
Leave a small
defensive force.

73
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,125
All other troops
descend from the hill!

74
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:25,000
And take that foolish
General Biao's head now!

75
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:30,916
[NARRATOR]
The Fourth Army's resistance

76
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,208
was like a stone
fighting a tide,

77
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,875
and Gong Yuan, Wei's
second-in-command,

78
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:38,333
did not even take notice of it.

79
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:41,791
Their cheers of victory
seemed entirely drowned out

80
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:45,166
by the greater army's
mobilized footsteps.

81
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,250
[NARRATOR] However...

82
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:52,375
Huh-huh, so part of the
Fourth Army's infantry

83
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:53,875
defeated a chariot?

84
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:57,375
Yes, my lord, but soon there'll
be an enemy counterattack.

85
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,708
Gong Yuan's army
is on the move.

86
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:03,125
I believe we should... withdraw.

87
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,541
[LORD BIAO] Look at this.

88
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:05,958
M-My lord?

89
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:08,583
It looks as though the battling
on every single front

90
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,416
is the same, but the pieces rock

91
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,166
the chessboard's balance
in many ways.

92
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,250
The movement of one
makes ten move,

93
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,791
and one thousand
can break ten thousand.

94
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:20,833
A small chain reaction
can lead to a conflagration

95
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:24,458
that brings the war
rapidly to its end.

96
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:27,833
And today, one place
on the board stands out.

97
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:31,291
When that happens, you know
there's something there.

98
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:35,208
That is exactly how war works.
Isn't it, gentlemen?

99
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:36,583
Oh?

100
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:41,125
Order the entire Fourth Army
cavalry to charge now!

101
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,750
Charge now!

102
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:53,416
Hey! It's the cavalry!

103
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:58,166
[WEI DAO] They... They finally
came, those cavalries!

104
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:04,583
[CAVALRY yelling]

105
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:15,625
[WEI DAO] We're saved!

106
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,333
[WEI PING] We survived!

[XIN] Hey, Bi, my man!

111
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,833
[BI] Xin! I'm glad
you're all right!

112
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,291
[FU HUSHEN grunts]

113
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,375
[FU HUSHEN] I see.

114
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:46,291
This lot drove
Lord Biao to action.

115
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,625
[BI] Bring your horses
and crush them!

116
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:51,666
Foot soldiers, spread the
defensive wall to the right!

117
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,708
The chariot squad's
main force'll be back!

118
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:57,083
[FU HUSHEN] That over-serious
brigade commander

119
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,333
from the capital...

120
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,333
I see he's quick-witted.

121
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,875
But he obviously doesn't
understand the meaning

122
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,166
of the cavalry's charge.

123
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,958
What the general wants is to
turn the tables of this war.

124
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,333
Fu Hushen Brigade, attack!

125
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,083
[FU HUSHEN]
I congratulate you on surviving

126
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,541
Wei's chariot attack!

127
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:21,208
Not only that, but you
launched a counterattack!

128
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:25,750
That makes you the pride of your
battalion, and the pride of Qin!

129
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,875
You're men who, in despair,
escaped the jaws of death!

130
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,333
You can overcome
even deadlier dangers!

131
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,333
[gasping]

132
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:36,875
Our battalion will go to the
enemy's infantry and take the

133
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,458
head of Gong Yuan Wei's,
second-in-command

134
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,416
who sits atop that hill!

135
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,833
Prepare to charge!

136
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,250
[gasping]

137
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,583
[FU HUSHEN] Foot soldiers
follow behind the cavalry!

138
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:49,083
If you don't want to die,
run with all you've got!

139
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:50,958
Come on, I thought we were saved

140
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,666
when the cavalry
came to join all of us!

141
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,583
Why do we have to push
our luck like that again?!

142
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,125
[WEI DAO groans]

143
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,750
We've got less than a hundred
men--left out of a thousand.

144
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,833
It's impossible to get
through that massive army

145
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:05,791
of ten thousand like this!

146
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:08,666
Nope, not necessarily.

147
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,208
What do you mean, Xin?

148
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,000
Do you think we have a chance?

149
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,833
Huh? Oh, nah, I have a feeling.

150
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,458
[WEI PING] Excuse me?!

151
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,250
[QIANG LEI] Xin is right.
We have a chance.

152
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,625
[ALL] Huh?

153
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:20,958
[QIANG LEI]
The enemy has momentum

154
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,458
from coming down the hill,
and they'll act fast.

155
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,500
Our path upstream
against that tide

156
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:28,125
will be an incredibly cruel one.

157
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,083
[QIANG LEI] But at that speed,

158
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,750
we won't have to
cross swords for long.

159
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:36,500
Yeah, yeah,
exactly what he said!

160
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:39,333
If we get through them,
the hill will be wide open.

161
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,875
We can take the enemy
in one swoop!

162
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:45,166
And then, this battle
will be ours!

163
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,333
As I said,
it's a cruel path

164
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,333
Anyone who pauses
will then be met with a

165
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:50,791
certain death.

166
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,916
What's gotten into you?

167
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,708
You've been mighty talkative
since the chariots came here.

168
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:00,041
I thought you said
you hated talking?

169
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,916
[QIANG LEI] I'm just like you.

170
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
[XIN] Huh?

171
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:08,000
I simply cannot
afford to die here.

172
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,875
Uhh... is that so?

173
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,583
Anyway, that settles it!

174
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,583
I'll drive off the enemy!

175
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,833
Okay, now prepare to charge!

176
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,083
[WEI PING] You don't
give orders, moron!

177
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,541
Commander Fu Hushen,

178
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:23,166
one of the foot soldiers
is riding like a cavalryman.

179
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,041
[FU HUSHEN] Leave him to it.

180
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,500
[FU HUSHEN]
That brat must be the one

181
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:29,875
who's been leading
what's left of the men.

182
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:33,458
He should come in
handy at some point.

183
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:36,833
[NARRATOR] On the front lines,
Qin's 1,000-man cavalry

184
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:41,583
was sorely testing
Wei's 40,000-man army.

185
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:46,083
The raid ordered by Lord Biao
had indeed succeeded.

186
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,458
[LIAISON OFFICER 19B] Still,
they're outnumbered.

187
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:50,125
They're sure to be
pushed back eventually!

188
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:51,541
[LIAISON OFFICER 19A] A report!

189
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:54,583
The chariot squadron is
attacking the Fourth Army again!

190
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:57,833
Now order the First and
Second Army cavalries...

191
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,041
[LORD BIAO] ...to storm the
Fourth Army's battlefield!

192
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:07,166
[NARRATOR] Lord Biao thought it
was the fight's moment of truth,

193
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,833
and this was his swift response.

194
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:13,708
[FU HUSHEN] Go! Go!
Don't stop for anything!

195
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,458
What is that
battalion doing now?!

196
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:20,875
They're going too far!

197
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,333
That's Fu Hushen.

198
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,416
He probably means to break
through the enemy's center,

199
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,583
and storm that hill!

200
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:26,875
[BI] That's crazy!

201
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,541
They'll be wiped out even
before they make it!

202
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:29,583
[laughing]

203
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,583
If he wants to die,
leave him to it!

204
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,250
I can't do that!

205
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,625
Bi Battalion!

206
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:37,541
Form a wedge formation,
and cut into enemy lines!

207
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,750
Back up the Fu Hushen
Battalion's advance!

208
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,125
[XIN yells]

209
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,625
[XIN] You okay, Ze?

210
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:46,250
Y-Yes, yes I am.
I'm managing!

211
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,875
It's a big help that you're
taking the lead, Xin!

212
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,291
[WEI DAO] Darn it, Commander
Fu Hushen is going too fast!

213
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:55,083
Who does he think
we foot soldiers are?!

214
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,791
[FU HUSHEN yells]

215
00:11:56,875 --> 00:12:00,291
Foot soldiers were never
important to him to begin with!

216
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,208
[WEI DAO yells]

217
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,166
Dao, are you okay?!

218
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,333
I'm okay!

219
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:09,041
Keep running!
Right now, just keep--

220
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,500
[WEI PING gasps]

221
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,333
--[XIN screams]
--[BOTH gasp]

222
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:26,541
[WEI PING whimpers]

223
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:27,916
Brother!

224
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,541
[slashing,
weapons clanging]

225
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,083
[XIN gasps]

226
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,458
[WEI SOLDIERS scream]

227
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:44,833
You did...

228
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,041
Wei Ping, get up! Quickly!

229
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,541
If we don't hurry,

230
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,791
we'll be left surrounded by
the enemies, and we'll die!

231
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,916
It's okay! I'll cut us a path!

232
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,541
--[WEI DAO] Xin!
--[ZE GUI] Xin!

233
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,833
[XIN] We're gonna catch up
with our commander!

234
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,625
No more tripping, Wei Ping!

235
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:00,958
G-Got it!

236
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,791
[XIN yells,
WEI SOLDIERS screaming]

237
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,416
[XIN] Qiang Lei...

238
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,166
I thought he
was just brains,

239
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,666
but he's pretty good
with a sword, too.

240
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,416
There's more to
this guy than it seems.

241
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,416
[XIN grunts]

242
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,083
[XIN] Fine by me.

243
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:18,041
Looks like I can forget
about the rear

244
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:20,541
and concentrate on
what's in front of me!

245
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,250
[FU HUSHEN yells]

246
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:33,291
[screaming]

247
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:45,291
[FU HUSHEN] What, Wei soldiers,
is that all you've got?

248
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:49,041
I will give whatever it takes
to win this battle!

249
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:54,083
[SOLDIERS yelling]

250
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,666
We... We got through!

251
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:22,958
[FU HUSHEN] The guards stationed
halfway up haven't noticed us.

252
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,416
How many men left?

253
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,250
[SUBORDINATE 19A]
About forty, Sir.

254
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,333
[FU HUSHEN] All right.

255
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:28,625
[XIN] Hold on there.

256
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,083
[FU HUSHEN] Huh...?

257
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,458
Five more makes
that forty-five.

258
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:39,333
[FU HUSHEN] This boy cut his way
through that death trap

259
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:43,083
even after falling
behind us... But how?

260
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:50,541
We'll now storm this hill
and kill General Gong Yuan!

261
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,583
--[XIN growls]
--[SOLDIERS whimper]

262
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,958
Know that our battle
will be a critical one

263
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,916
to Qin's ultimate victory!

264
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:01,333
I am aware that you have
used up all of your strength!

265
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:04,125
But I won't go soft on you!

266
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:05,875
Anyone who doesn't
make it to the top,

267
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,416
I'll kill you later myself!

268
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,625
[SOLDIERS groan]

269
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,083
[FU HUSHEN] However,
whoever makes to the top

270
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,583
will have the
chance to be honored

271
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:15,416
for their distinguished service
and effort during battle!

272
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,250
Honored and rewarded.

273
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,458
[gasping]

274
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,125
[FU HUSHEN] The ones
stationed on this hill

275
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,500
are Wei's highest officers.

276
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:27,250
And the prices of their heads
are extremely high, of course.

277
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,958
Kill one of them and
I pledge ten times that reward!

278
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,541
[XIN gasps]

279
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:35,375
Brother, you and I could be the
village heroes if we succeed!

280
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,208
[WEI PING laughs]

281
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:37,833
I sure can't turn that down!

282
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,833
[FU HUSHEN] Hey, kid!

283
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:42,958
Leave your squad
and come to the front.

284
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,916
We need all the
cavalrymen we can get.

285
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,208
[gasping]

286
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:49,125
All ri-- Ah!

287
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:50,583
[XIN] But if I do that,
Ze and the othe--

288
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,666
[WEI PING] Just go, idiot!

289
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,666
You don't have to worry
about us anymore, cavalryman.

290
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:59,708
It's very clear that a five-man
squad isn't enough for you, Xin.

291
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:02,291
You're gonna be one of
the world's greatest generals.

292
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:05,708
Go out there and
outdo them all, Xin!

293
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,333
[FU HUSHEN]
Ah, good dust clouds.

294
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:17,125
If we get behind the rock,
they won't see us.

295
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:20,208
Go, and make sure all the men
stay out of sight and hearing.

296
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,333
Yes!

297
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,333
Hey, kid.

298
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,958
Do you want a great achievement?

299
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,291
Of course.

300
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,916
[FU HUSHEN] Then cut your way
straight through

301
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,041
and don't look back.

302
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,708
Hey! Wh-What are you doing?!

303
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:39,666
[QIANG LEI] Let me
ride for a while.

304
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,625
Say what?!

305
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,000
Looks like it's time to go.

306
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,083
Hey! Listen when I'm talking!

307
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,291
Fu Hushen Battalion, move!

308
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,541
[XIN] What do you want?

309
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,458
Oh, I know.

310
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:03,208
You're just coming with me
to steal my glory away!

311
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,125
What's wrong?

312
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,041
N-Nothing's wrong.

313
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,750
[horse whinnies,

314
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:13,541
Be careful!

315
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:14,500
Shut up!

We still have far
greater numbers than they do.

Nothing that happens will
affect the big picture.

In the end, our generals
are simply better than theirs.

00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,916
The outcome of this
battle has always been

a foregone conclusion.

325
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,166
Soon, this dust will settle

326
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,375
and the soldiers of Qin
will become extinct.

327

Is this the power of Qin

328
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,416

of tigers and wolves?

we'll pass them!
