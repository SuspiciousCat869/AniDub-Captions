[XIN] I could feel that
I didn't strike bone!

What's with this freak's body?!

My next one will break bones!

11
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:06,416
I was just careless.

[PANG NUAN] Still, thou hast

The time: The Spring and Autumn

and Warring States periods.

16
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:24,458
Xin, a nameless boy who rose to
the rank of squadron commander,

17
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:27,416
carried out a string of exploits
in the midst of a battle 

18
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,083
that brought the
Qin army an advantage.

19
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:33,250
However, the enemy's commanding
general has appeared at last,

20
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:36,416
and has proven to be
beyond all imagination.

21
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,416
That man, said to have a
previous tie to Wang Yi,

22
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,791
is named Pang Nuan.

The war situation is on
the verge of great change!

24

[WAN JI]
"Fei Xin Force"...?

34
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:12,291
So that's the force that
managed to slay Feng Ji?

35
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:15,375
[NARRATOR] After that, the
battle between Qin's Fourth Army

36
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,458
and Zhao's Wan Ji Army

37
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:21,583
turned heavily one-sided with
the advantage going to Zhao.

38
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,625
It all started when
Wan Ji seriously wounded

39
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:29,208
Fourth Army combat commander
Gan Yang in one-on-one combat.

40
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,791
Pang Nuan stood still in
the midst of the battle

41
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,375
for a time...

42
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:39,708
...and then vanished into
the darkness once more.

43
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,500
At the cost of several lives,

44
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,875
the Fei Xin Force left
the battle's epicenter

45
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:49,041
and managed to make it
deeper into the mountains.

46
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:54,166
[NARRATOR] However, Wan Ji
then personally led

47
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,958
a large-scale punitive
expedition against them.

48
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:02,333
Encircle the area! Fill gaps
with infantry men! Get them all!

49
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:05,000
[NARRATOR] The countless torches
and the clamor of horses

echoing through the mountains

51
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:10,583
were powerful evidence of
the enormity of their pursuit.

52
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,166
[PEI LANG]
How many of us went down?

53
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,125
[CHONG YUAN]
No idea.

54
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:15,666
My squad's safe, though...

00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,000
Long Chuan!
What about yours?

56
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:21,041
I lost three of my men, too.

57
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,000
[PEI LANG]
I don't see Long YRu's squad.

58
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,125
[CHONG YUAN]
We split up before we got here.

59
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,416
Same thing for
Zhong Tie's, Lu Yan's

60

and the mountain folk, too!

61
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:29,875
What about Qiang Lei?

62
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,958
I saw Tian YRu
carrying him away,

63
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,541
but that's all I know.

64
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,750
I have to say, it stings
how close we are!

65
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,250
Yeah, almost got him.

66
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,458
Almost bagged the biggest kill.

67
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:43,083
Although that would've
brought its own problems.

68
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:47,000
Forget about village heroes--
We'd have been national heroes!

69
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:50,500
Ha, ha! True. That'd make
all hell break lose!

70
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:55,958
Anyway, our commander really
is one heck of a strong man!

00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,125
[PEI LANG]
Yeah.

[CHONG YUAN]
That's for sure!

73
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,708
Still a moron, though.

Wei Dao! Don't you dare
let go of that kid!

75

No matter how many
of us small fry die,

76
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:08,958
the Fei Xin Force won't die
as long as he's alive!

go on ahead for a bit.

160
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,416
I'll just take a little break.

161
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,833
[WEI PING gasps]

162
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:05,916
[WEI PING]
Dao... those arrows...

163
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:10,666
Let's do our best,
like Xin always does.

164
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,708
[WEI DAO]
We have to grit our teeth

165
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:15,833
and put one foot in
front of the other.

166
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:20,666
[WAN JI'S SOLDIER 32A]
We found bloodstains!

167
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,958
Call General Wan Ji!

168
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,916
[WAN JI'S SOLDIER 32B]
Two sets of footprints.

169
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,875
From the depth,
I think one of them

170
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:30,250
might possibly be
carrying someone else.

171
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,833
I conclude that two to three men

172
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:35,333
are fleeing up the mountain.

173
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:39,583
They're the ones.
No doubt about it.

174
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:43,416
[WAN JI'S SOLDIER 32B] But
there's something puzzling, Sir.

175
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,375
I would normally expect someone

176
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:48,166
who had lost this much
blood to be dead.

177
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,458
[WAN JI'S SOLDIER 32B]
How can they still walk?

178
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,000
[WEI DAO]
Brother!

179
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:58,500
It's not over yet...
I won't let it!

180
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,083
[WEI DAO]
I'm sorry, Brother.

181
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,500
I didn't know the
gash was that deep.

182
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,750
[WEI PING]
Shut up, you idiot...

183
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:07,833
Your wound is bad,
too, isn't it?

184
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:11,083
[horse neighs]

185
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,583
[WEI DAO]
They're after us?

186
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:16,041
We... We may not make it...

187
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:21,416
[WEI PING] Dao...
Is Xin's heart still beating?

188
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,000
Yeah, it is still beating.

189
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:27,208
[WEI PING] Mine still is,
too, and so's yours.

190
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:31,625
So if Xin were awake,
he'd say...

191
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:35,458
"This ain't over yet, everyone!"

192
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:38,125
The arrows stopped
at the bone, didn't they?

193
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,958
Yeah. I can keep going.

194
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:44,000
[WEI PING] Okay. Then,
we will split up here.

195
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,916
[WEI PING]
They're following our blood...

196
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,458
[WEI PING]
I have an idea...

197
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,916
Here, hold onto this and
put it over your wound

198
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,416
--and keep climbing!
--[WEI DAO] But brother...

199
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,250
[WEI PING] Dao. We're gonna
see Xin through all of this!

200
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:03,375
As corporals of
the Fei Xin Force...

201
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:06,083
As his buds from
Cheng Hu Village!

202
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,750
Brother!

203
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,500
Don't you make that face.

204
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:16,375
Once I give them the
slip I'll come join you,

205
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,708
that's for sure!

206
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:20,583
Ha! I'm not dying here.

207
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,041
Dong Mei's waiting
for me back home.

208
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,500
Take good care of Xin, Dao.

209
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,500
Brother...

210
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:48,500
[WEI DAO gags, retches]

211
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:52,791
They pierced bone...

212
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,291
We're both banged up
pretty good, huh?

213
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,333
[XIN coughs]

214
00:13:57,416 --> 00:14:00,541
But we're not
kicking the bucket!

215
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:05,583
Sturdiness is a Cheng Hu
man's biggest selling point.

216
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:08,958
And that's a fact. Right, Xin?

217
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,375
Ain't that right, Brother?

218
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,208
[WEI PING] So you're
the dumb servant brats

219
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,250
who say they're gonna be
great generals one day?

220
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,458
Well then?

221
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:27,166
How about you say a
proper hello to the--

222
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,416
[WEI DAO]
Brother...

223
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,041
[WEI PING] Ow! What are
you waiting for, Dao?!

224
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,291
Go kill that brat!

225
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,333
[XIN laughs]
Dummy!

226
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,208
[WEI PING]
Dao!

227
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,291
Learned your lesson, you punks?

228
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,666
Never make fun of the
world's greatest generals!

229
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,583
Come, let's go.

230
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:45,875
[WEI PING]
Dammit, you'll pay for this!

231
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,583
[WEI DAO]
So that's the Xin and Piao

232
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:50,041
people have been
talking about...

233
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,541
[WEI DAO]
You awake, Xin?

234
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:02,375
[XIN]
Oh, Wei Dao.

235
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:06,666
I just had a dream about
back when we were kids...

236
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:10,166
[WEI DAO]
Heh. What do you know? Me, too.

237
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,875
[XIN]
Pang Nuan!

238
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,208
[WEI DAO] You shouldn't
move at all just yet.

239
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,750
Just lie down.

240
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,833
What the heck's
going on, anyway?

241
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:27,750
Where are we?! And the fight?!

242
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,500
You're saying everybody
risked their lives

243
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,208
to let me get away?

244
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:39,083
Dammit, what kind
of leader am I?

245
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:42,666
What happened to Gan Yang?
And Pang Nuan?!

246
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:46,708
Xin, could you stop
talking about him?

247
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:51,750
Remembering his face is enough
to stop me from healing.

248
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:56,458
[XIN] Hey, you are hurt?!
Show me the wound!

249
00:15:56,541 --> 00:16:00,625
[WEI DAO] It's fine.
I'm not as hurt as you are.

250
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:04,416
Right now, I just want
to talk about something...

251
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,875
...something cheerful for a bit.

252
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:14,750
Xin, remember how we all
used to make fun of you

253
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:17,250
for saying that you'd
be great generals?

254
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,541
"No way," we said.

255
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:23,000
Yeah, so I sent you
flying every time, right?

256
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:26,666
"Great general," huh...

257
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,166
[WEI DAO]
With my first taste of real war,

258
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,916
I realized that
was just a dream.

259
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,416
How much do you fight
before you get there?

260
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,791
Make just one mistake and
you're dead-- it's all over.

261
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,625
[XIN] Hey, I thought
we were talking about

262
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,083
something cheerful.

263
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,333
[WEI DAO]
We are.

264
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:47,583
You survived a fierce
fight with Pang Nuan.

265
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:48,958
[XIN]
Well I...

266
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:52,583
[WEI DAO] That's right,
you didn't do it alone.

267
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,750
You made it because
the whole squad

268
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:57,166
protected you with their lives.

269
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,250
They staked their lives
without orders to...

270
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,875
It's not normal at all.

271
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:07,583
Normal commanders
can't do this, Xin.

272
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:10,125
So that made me think,

273
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:13,916
"Xin really can become
a general, after all."

274
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,916
All of the famous generals,

275
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,750
even Wang Yi, must've had times

276
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:25,375
when they couldn't fend
for themselves, too.

277
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:28,875
That's what I think. [coughs]

278
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,583
[XIN]
H-Hey!

279
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:35,875
But your power includes
all of your men's power, too.

280
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,958
Xin, I'm really glad
I was your friend.

281
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,041
Back then, and all through this.

282
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:45,416
Whoa hold it, Wei Dao!
What are you talking about?

283
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,666
[WEI DAO laughs]
It always felt very exciting

284
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,125
to be with you, friend.

285
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,541
Wei Dao!

286
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:55,083
[WEI DAO] A lot of our comrades
might've died tonight,

287
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:58,541
but there's no need to
hang onto your deads.

288
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:01,708
It's war, people die.

289
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,500
It's fine, Xin.

290
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:10,333
See, we all wanted to dream with
you and that's fine. Really.

291
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,291
You have to keep it up...

292
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:16,166
I hope you make your way up
to the world's best general

293
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,125
And take a whole bunch of
people's hearts with you

294
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:20,833
on the way...

295
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:23,958
Wei Dao... y-you...

296
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:29,333
[WEI DAO]
I know you can do it, Xin...

297
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,458
I gotcha.

298
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,375
[XIN]
Y-You idiot!

299
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,208
Don't mess with me, dammit!

300
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:46,916
[WEI DAO laughs]
Sorry.

301
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It's not like me
to talk so long.

302
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,583
L-Let's sleep a bit, Xin.

303
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,583
When we've gotten
our strength back,

304
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,708
I'll take you to
the others, all right?

305
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:59,875
Are you sure you're
okay, Wei Dao?

306
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:03,166
Oh yeah. I'll sleep it off.

307
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,375
YRu Li...

308
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:39,666
[XIN]
Don't mess with me...

309
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,375
I'm not falling for
the same trick twice!

310
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:48,416
Knock... Knock it off...
Just wake up!

311
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,666
[XIN]
Wake up, Wei Dao!

312
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,416
It's not fair...

313
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,958
Fool... you fool!

314
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:08,041
[whistle blowing]

315
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,666
The whistle you hear...
Over there?

316
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,291
[whistle blowing]

317
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:14,625
[QU HAI]
What?!

318
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,125
So you just left Xin with
the Wei brothers only?

319
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:17,833
Two people?

320
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,458
We had no other choice.

321
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:22,541
I figured he'd be all right
in their capable hands.

322
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,291
[QU HAI]
And is he really?!

323
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:25,916
[FEI XIN SOLDIER 32G]
It's Corporal Wei Ping!

324
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,958
Our Corporal is finally back!

325
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,541
[PEI LANG] T-Tian YRu!
Why are you with Wei Ping?

326
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:35,833
[TIAN YONG] Hey, hold on! Xin
and Wei Dao aren't with them!

327
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:39,041
[TIAN YQU] Wei Ping was a
decoy to throw off the enemy.

328
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,583
We all just met up with
him a few minutes ago.

329
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:44,125
Xin's only got Wei Dao
protecting him?!

330
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,458
[WEI PING]
Dao will do fine.

331
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,833
He's one reliable guy.

332
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,625
But I doubt he can move
with those arrows in him...

333
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,000
There's no chance.
We'll send a search party!

334
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,333
[TIAN YONG grunts]
We got one more, quick run!

335
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:57,416
If you're hurt, stay here!

336
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,166
[SHI]
No need to.

337
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,791
The commander has now returned.

338
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,041
[PEI LANG]
What?!

339
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:10,708
[FEI XIN SOLDIERS]
It's Xin! Xin's back!

340
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,875
I'm really glad
you're back, Xin.

341
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,833
Wei Ping, I'm sorry.

342
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:23,583
[QING]
Wei Dao!

343
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,166
[MAO]
Wei Dao!

344
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:33,083
[sobbing]

345
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,333
I'm sorry.

346
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:38,458
Why should you
apologize for this?

347
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:41,375
[WEI PING]
And Qing and Mao, quit crying.

348
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:44,916
There's nothing to
cry about. He succeeded.

349
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,041
He carried out his duty well!

350
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:50,625
So he doesn't need tears.

351
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:55,208
Now you gotta smile
and compliment him.

352
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:58,958
Tell him: "You did
such a good job!"

353
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:07,291
[WEI PING]
Dao!

354
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:16,833
I'm impressed you didn't die

355
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:20,041
from Pang Nuan's attack,
I truly am.

356
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:22,833
What the heck is he, then?

357
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:26,375
That strength...
I still can't believe it.

358
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:30,000
That man is a truth
seeker, of a sort.

359
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:32,250
"Truth seeker"?

360
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:35,041
[QIANG LEI] One who leaves
humans to devote himself

361
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:37,333
to seeking his path
and mastering it.

362
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:39,875
One who undergoes
training beyond what we

363
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:44,833
can imagine in the single-minded
pursuit of sheer strength.

364
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:47,000
What kind of training?

365
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:48,958
I can't even guess.

366
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:51,958
But I'll train myself, too.

367
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:54,791
Six months from now,
I will beat him.

368
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:57,458
[XIN] We don't have
six months, Qiang Lei.

369
00:22:57,541 --> 00:22:59,333
We'll kill him in this war.

370
00:22:59,416 --> 00:23:01,708
He's our enemy's
commanding general,

371
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:03,625
so we'll kill him.

372
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,583
[QIANG LEI] Wei Dao was
a good man, wasn't he?

373
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:10,208
[XIN]
Yeah.

374
00:24:52,541 --> 00:24:53,958
[WANG YI]
It's time to go.

375
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:56,458
The deciding battle
is approaching.

376
00:24:57,666 --> 00:25:00,583
[NARRATOR] Even if there's
no going back now...

377
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:04,208
Next Time:
"Wang Yi Takes the Field!"
