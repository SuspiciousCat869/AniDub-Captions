1
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:21,416
[NARRATOR] The Qin forces
led by General Wang Yi

2
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,000
numbered 100,000.

3
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,208
The rival Zhao forces
led by Pang Nuan

4
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,500
numbered 120,000.

5
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:31,041
The two sides encountered
each other at MNyáng.

6
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:32,375
Now the battle
has transferred

7
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:35,166
to a vast plain nearby
called Gan Yuan,

8
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,083
and their confrontation
is about to begin.

9
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:48,375
[NARRATOR] The time:
The Spring &amp; Autumn

10
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:50,416
and Warring States periods.

11
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,166
The place: Qin.

12
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:56,083
Xin, a nameless boy,
met Zheng, a young King,

13
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:57,791
distinguished himself in battle,

14
00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:00,583
and rose to the rank
of squadron commander.

15
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:01,708
In the midst of this,

16
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:04,083
the neighboring
kingdom of Zhao invaded,

17
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:07,375
and Qin faced
unprecedented crisis.

18
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:09,416
What manner of battle
will Wang Yi wage

19
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,916
as commanding general?

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,250
And what growth
will Xin accomplish?

21
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:52,708
[DIAO] It's amazing!
Wang Yi is truly amazing!

22
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:56,541
Wow, there are countless
soldiers fighting for each side!

23
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:58,750
You don't have time
to be distracted.

24
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:02,750
Get a firm grasp of the war
situation before things start.

25
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,416
[MENG YI] The linchpin
of Zhao's attack

26
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,291
will be the 60,000 men
in those three rifts,

27
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,125
the left-hand force.

28
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:18,125
[MENG YI] Each division
has about 20,000 men,

29
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:21,333
and each plans to attack
Qin's right flank.

30
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:25,166
Qin has a total of 40,000 men
in its right-hand force

31
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,875
defending against that

32
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,875
while Qin's left force
and Zhao's right force

33
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:32,458
feel cut off from
the rest of the armies.

34
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:36,000
See, they're both surrounded
by physical obstacles.

35
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,625
So victory'll be
essentially decided

36
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,041
by the attack

37
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,750
as well as the defense
to the right of center, right?

38
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:46,708
Exactly. Zhao's key
are the 60,000 in their left.

39
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:49,000
And Qin's key men
are in the center:

40
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:52,250
Wang Yi's lieutenant
Meng Wu and his army of 20,000,

41
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:56,666
plus the 20,000 men of the
First Army, totaling 40,000.

42
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,500
Meng Wu? "Meng"...?

43
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,500
[MENG YI] He's my father.

44
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:04,583
[DIAO gasps]

45
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,666
[LI BAI] So that's Meng Wu?

46
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,208
Meng Wu. Son of Qin's
"White Elder" Meng Ao,

47
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:17,083
and Lü's most trusted
general, apparently... Well.

48
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:20,791
[GANG LUAN] Rumor has it his
offensive power is formidable.

49
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,500
Ah, Gang Luan.

50
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,583
One fights power with power.

51
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,083
I beg you, my lord,

52
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:30,208
please let my heavy cavalry unit
take over the front lines.

53
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:37,500
[WANG YI] So Zhao wants to have
a contest of strength, it seems.

54
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:40,416
All right, let's see all
of your power then.

55
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,208
It's time to show it off.

56
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:45,666
Army charge!

57
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:50,041
[SOLDIERS yelling]

58
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,958
There he goes!

59
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,958
I-It's starting now!

60
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,125
[GANG LUAN] Kill them now!

61
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,333
Meng Yi!

62
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:06,125
Are you confident that
your dad will be okay?

63
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,708
[MENG YI]
You underestimate him.

64
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:13,958
[GANG LUAN]
Prepare to die, Meng Wu!

65
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:18,125
[GANG LUAN choking]

66
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:22,375
[MENG YI] Now you see the power
of the general called Meng Wu.

67
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,333
[SOLDIERS yelling]

68
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:33,166
That... that animal...

69
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,333
[QIN SOLDIERS]
General Meng Wu!

70
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:40,125
General Meng Wu!
General Meng Wu!

71
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:43,083
General Meng Wu grabbed
the battle's momentum!

72
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,916
Think he can keep it?!

73
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,458
No. Zhao's vanguard
won't take this quietly.

74
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:52,333
Their left force is
lead by General She Meng.

75
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:53,833
[QIN SOLDIER 27C]
Here they come!

76
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,708
What?!

77
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,125
Our right force!

78
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,375
The vanguards
are evenly matched.

79
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:09,416
Yes.

80
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:13,291
Isn't it our turn
right about now?!

81
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:21,625
General Li Bai, we aren't
slowing Meng Wu down.

82
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:24,250
Put the heavy
infantry diagonally.

83
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:27,708
Deploy 500 archers to the left.

84
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,250
[ZHENG] Is it time?

85
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,958
[LORD CHANGWEN] Yes, no
messenger has reached us yet,

86
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,125
but General Wang Yi
and our forces

87
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,125
should definitely combat
the Zhao army

88
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,583
without fail today.

89
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,791
General Wang Yi...

90
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,666
Do you feel impatient?

91
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,041
Yes.

92
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,708
If only it were possible,

93
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:53,333
I would watch these events
unfolding in detail.

94
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:54,666
And yet...

95
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,083
Here I am merely sitting
daily in this high throne.

96
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:00,250
I have no choice but
to leave the battles

97
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,041
to my top generals.

98
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,833
I guess that is the
nature of kingship.

99
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:06,375
[LORD CHANGWEN] As you say.

100
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:11,458
It looks like Meng Wu's army
is slowing down somewhat.

101
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:16,125
It's the Zhao guard's strategy.

102
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,583
[MENG YI]
By firing from one side

103
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:20,166
and setting their
infantry diagonally,

104
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,083
they're managing
our cavalry's momentum.

105
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:29,750
[ZHAO ZHUANG] Meng Wu is even
stronger than the rumors say.

106
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:34,666
But pure force of arms is not
enough to make it past Li Bai.

107
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,083
Now, what will you
do next, Wang Yi?

108
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,291
The right and center forces
are operating as planned.

109
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:47,791
Now we're only waiting
on our all-important left force.

110
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,833
[NARRATOR] Even as its
center and right forces

111
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,333
battled fiercely,

112
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:55,458
Qin's left force had not yet
received any direct orders.

113
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,666
Is there any meaning at all

114
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,916
in protecting
this steep terrain?!

115
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,666
Should we not go to support
our central force instead?

116
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,041
[GAN YANG]
Battalion Commander Bi.

117
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,833
Please understand
that crux of our attack

118
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,666
isn't the central force...

119
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,208
...it is the
left force instead.

120
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,708
What do you mean,
sir, that we are the crux?

121
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,166
We can't strike the
enemy's core from here,

122
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,083
and we've waited too long
to target their center.

123
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,791
The war has only
just begun, however.

124
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:27,458
No one could go straight
after their core and reach it.

125
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:28,708
[BI] However...

126
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:31,958
I received a strategy
from General Wang Yi.

127
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,625
It's from General Wang Yi?

128
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,416
I'm sure it'll be
a hard battle,

129
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,333
but desperate battles are
my specialty, I assure you.

130
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:44,333
[TENG] Sir, the left force
has begun its advance.

131
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:46,041
[WANG YI chuckles]

132
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,083
[WANG YI] Now the stage is set.

133
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:52,166
Perhaps it's about time
to release the archers.

134
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,333
[WANG YI] I'll leave
this post to you for now.

135
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:55,375
[TENG] Sir.

136
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,041
The left force is charging!

137
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:10,541
Heh heh! Looks like it's
finally our turn to act.

138
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,666
It's about time, isn't it?

139
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,416
[XIN] General Wang Yi!

140
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,833
[QIN SOLDIER 27D]
It's General Wang Yi!

141
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:26,791
[QIN SOLDIER 27E]
General Wang Yi!

142
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,500
As you can see,
our left force of 10,000

143
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:40,041
just attacked Zhao's
right force of 20,000.

144
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,750
Ten thousand?

145
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,125
Twenty?

146
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,458
[WANG YI] In truth, this is
the most critical fight

147
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:48,541
to the initial stages
of the campaign.

148
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,583
Oh, young Xin, my boy,

149
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:56,875
it's time for you to show me
the fruit of your training.

150
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,875
Leave it to me!

151
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,291
I can see that you're
irrefutably undaunted.

152
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:06,708
[WANG YI] Very well. I shall
give this squadron a mission.

153
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,875
The typical rule for
fighting efficient battle

154
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,625
is to first of all make sure
to seize advantageous terrain.

155
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:18,458
[WANG YI] However, there is
another sound method as well:

156
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:23,833
Killing off the enemy's
best commanders firstly.

157
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,083
[gasp]

158
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,958
[WANG YI] The general
leading the 20,000 men

159
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,458
in Zhao's
right force, Feng Ji,

160
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:35,000
has an exceptional gift
for tactical analysis.

161
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:37,250
[WANG YI] As a battle
approaches its climax,

162
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,458
that sort of commander

163
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,916
becomes more
and more troublesome.

164
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,083
So listen carefully.

165
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:48,000
Let's begin by firstly
removing Feng Ji, shall we?

166
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,500
Young Xin.

167
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,666
It's time for
your squadron to act.

168
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,541
Take advantage of
the confusion there

169
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,666
to capture the head
of Feng Ji.

170
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,750
The head of Feng Ji...

171
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,583
[WANG YI] This is an extremely
important mission, young Xin.

172
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,291
Can you do it?

173
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,500
There is something I
realized from that training

174
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,916
I did in the stateless area.

175
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,291
In a giant battlefield with
tens of thousands of soldiers,

176
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,625
one hundred is merely
just a pebble-sized

177
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,458
tiny number, after all.

178
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:28,125
But even a pebble has its own
kind of strength, however!

179
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,833
[XIN] We can squeeze
through openings,

180
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:33,208
and together we can be a
rock that nobody can break!

181
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:37,708
My squadron will surely
take on that mission!

182
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:41,416
I'll repeat myself.
This is a really crucial battle.

183
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,833
Whatever happens,
you are not allowed to fail.

184
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:48,875
I will be counting on you, then,
Squadron Commander Xin.

185
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,500
[WANG YI chuckles]

186
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:56,000
[WANG YI] It relieves my mind to
see that you've grown somewhat.

187
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:59,916
Very well, let me
give you a little reward.

188
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,875
I give your squadron
the name "Fei Xin Force."

189
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,625
[XIN] Fei Xin Force!

190
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,458
[MENG YI] Give it up.

191
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:30,125
You cannot possibly
pick Xin and the others

192
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,916
out of so many people.

193
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,250
That is...

194
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,875
There's a group
coming from over there!

195
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,708
There, there by the woods!

196
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,541
Do you see?
I'm right! It's Xin!

197
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:57,625
[YUAN] Let's lay out
a strategy, Sir.

198
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:01,833
I'll start by explaining the
situation, so listen closely.

199
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:04,416
Our target, the 20,000
led by Feng Ji,

200
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,208
is fighting 10,000 Qin men now.

201
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:10,708
The Zhao army is sure to be
focused on the Qin troops

202
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,333
in front of them.
That's our opening.

203
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:16,666
We'll circle around and
charge them from the side.

204
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,208
[YUAN] The plan is to
take the enemy unaware

205
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,208
and go for their core.

206
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,041
But will this really work

207
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,166
just because
they will be surprised?

208
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,583
I have done
similar things before,

209
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:38,125
though not up
against a whole army.

210
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,416
[YUAN]
But we've got a big problem

211
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,291
in the run-up
to this maneuver.

212
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:45,166
Namely, whether or not we
can go to our entry point

213
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,125
next to them
without being noticed.

214
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,625
No problem.

215
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,708
That's precisely where
being a small unit

216
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,875
actually comes in handy.

217
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,125
[WANG YI]
Thank you very much, Teng.

218
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,416
How are we faring?

219
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,791
Sir. The right force
has been pushed back a bit.

220
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,875
Meng Wu's center force
hasn't regained momentum,

221
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:17,083
faced with Li Bai's guard.

222
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,125
What about the left force?

223
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:23,125
The left force
is fighting bravely.

224
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,708
Thanks to Gan Yang,
the Fourth Army's general,

225
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,250
their fighting spirit is high.

226
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:33,333
Still, though, they're
on shaky ground, aren't they?

227
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:36,958
Feng Ji is baiting
them then, Sir.

228
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,083
[WANG YI] If my arrow
doesn't hit home soon,

229
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:42,458
I believe there's pain
in store for the left force.

230
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,625
We should be
just about there.

231
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,291
That went very well.

232
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:49,916
All right, get ready.

233
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,625
Pass the message down the line:
"We are charging soon."

234
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,250
[TIAN YOU] Got it.

235
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,458
[GUARD SOLDIER 27B] Pests.

236
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,750
[metallic slicing noise]

237
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,416
Damn, these woods
are thinning out now.

238
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,458
Fei Xin Force,
come to a halt!

239
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:21,166
Right, there they all are.

240
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,583
[XIN chuckles]

241
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:27,666
[SOLDIERS yelling]

242
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,000
Onward, men!
The enemy is faltering!

243
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:34,041
Heh, how nice!
Qin's got them on the back foot!

244
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:37,291
[WANG YI] Half the left force's
momentum comes from talent.

245
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:42,791
The other half is
thanks to Feng Ji's trap.

246
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,291
Pull back the front line.

247
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:47,333
Send Hei Li and Hei Ling's
infantry to the front,

248
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,041
and take your positions.

249
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,916
[ZHAO MESSENGER 27A]
Wu Fang Squadron withdraw!

250
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,708
Wu Ying Squadron follow!
Everyone withdraw!

251
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:58,500
[BI] The front line
fell back... Why?

252
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:03,375
[BI] We were pressing them, yes,
but not that much, really.

253
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:04,625
[BI] Could this be...?

254
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:07,583
[QIN SOLDIER 27G]
After them! Kill them all!

255
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,583
Bi Brigade!
Halt, for this may be a trap!

256
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,416
All squads to halt now!

257
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,291
[QIN SOLDIER 27H] Follow them!

258
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:15,833
[INFANTRY COMMANDER 27A]
So they came.

259
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:18,708
Foolish amateurs.

260
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:22,000
Men, it's time now
for the slaughter.

261
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:29,750
[QIN SOLDIER 27I]
W-Wait! Stop, stop!

262
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,583
[SOLDIERS yelling]

263
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,208
Commander, look right!

264
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,541
[BI] Oh no!

265
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:45,083
[NARRATOR] Feng Ji's
trap closed at last.

266
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,458
The heavy infantry's spears

267
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:49,958
and the arrows
pouring down like rain...

268
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,541
Their ruthless attack
brought down

269
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,500
almost half
of the left force

270
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:57,958
and soon most of the foot
soldiers were rushing to escape.

271
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:06,000
Huh, that's not good...

272
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,375
Th-That's brutal...

273
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,458
[YUAN] This is bad, sir.

274
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,583
If everyone's spirits
aren't high,

275
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,250
we can't draw power
from our unity!

276
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:22,041
Fei Xin Force,
let's get in formation.

277
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:26,750
[XIN] For a group of 100
to get to the leader of 10,000,

278
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,750
we can't afford
any pointless fights.

279
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:31,000
That's why we're
using a file formation

280
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:34,125
and making a beeline
for the enemy general.

281
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:36,458
Issue is gonna be
when we make the breach.

282
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,208
'Cause when we move,
they'll know we're here

283
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,333
and they'll guard against us.

284
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:43,208
To tear through their defenses
and to get a point of entry,

285
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:46,541
I'm putting four corporals
with good strength in the front.

286
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:49,416
[XIN] Zhong Tie!
Shan He! Tian You!

287
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,958
And corporal for the
16th squad Long Chuan!

288
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:55,458
Long Chuan, it's our
first time fighting together,

289
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,125
but I've high hopes.

290
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:00,666
Tian You told me you've got
twice the strength he has.

291
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,333
I wanna see it.

292
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,291
[TIAN YOU]
Long Chuan! What's with you?

293
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:09,125
You better not be getting
cold feet right now!

294
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:12,500
[SONG ZUO] Can't blame him!

295
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:15,041
Word came his wife
had a baby last month.

296
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:18,166
And it's his first kid.
Put yourself in his shoes.

297
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:22,541
If he dies here,
he'll never see that cute face.

298
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,416
So back on topic!

299
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,166
You can think of the Fei Xin
Force as a single arrow.

300
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,416
[XIN] If we fly to the enemy
general we can take him down,

301
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,125
but if we fall short
we'll get broken

302
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,958
and we'll die pathetically.

303
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,791
If we fail, everyone
on the left force

304
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:42,125
that you can see getting
shot at will die as well then.

305
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,500
And so will every single
person that's waiting for you

306
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,958
back in your villages!

307
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,458
Did you guys forget?

308
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:49,833
If we lose this battle here,

309
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:52,875
the Zhao army's just
gonna pour right into Qin!

310
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,958
[XIN] If that happens,
the massacre at MNyg

311
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,833
gets repeated
everywhere!

312
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,000
These guys are serious!

313
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:00,458
Long Chuan!

314
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:04,250
If we don't win,
your kid gets killed, too!

315
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,833
[XIN] Drum it right
into your heads, men:

316
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,791
That's exactly
what's on the line here!

317
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,791
[yelling]

318
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,375
Let's go, then!

319
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:26,958
Let's score today's
first victory, Commander.

320
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:41,208
[INFANTRYMAN 27A]
Enemy attack from our left!

321
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:42,541
[WEI PING]
Crap, they're onto us.

322
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:45,833
Doesn't matter!
We just gotta go!

323
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,583
Heavy infantry to the front!

324
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,458
Build us a wall, now!

325
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,750
[WEI PING] Damn it!

326
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,208
[XIN] Long Chuan!
Long Chuan, wait!

327
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,041
Don't go out on your own!

328
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:03,083
[TIAN YOU] Long Chuan,
don't tell me you're not--

329
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:11,791
[LONG CHUAN] Tian You, you've
got one thing terribly wrong!

330
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:16,916
I'm afraid I must correct you...

331
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,583
[LONG CHUAN] I've got three
times your crazy strength!

332
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:22,875
You brought some serious
muscle with you, Tian You!

333
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:24,291
Here we go!

334
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:27,125
Fei Xin Force,
it's time to charge!

335
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:31,000
[ZHAO SOLDIER 27B]
Pen them in from both sides!

336
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,500
[ZHAO SOLDIER 27C]
Pick 'em off and slice 'em up!

337
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:35,875
They're closing in! Hurry up!

338
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:37,083
If we don't move faster,

339
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,208
the path we cleared
is gonna disappear!

340
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:41,791
Go now! Chong Yuan Five!

341
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:49,791
Oh wow, that mongrel's
not bad for a pretty boy!

342
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,666
And the rest of
his squad's tough, too!

343
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,833
[WEI PING] All right! Go!

344
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:06,625
[BI] Don't fall back!
It's an enemy trap--

345
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,583
If we fall back
they'll kill us!

346
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,625
The way out is forward!

347
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,041
Commander Bi said...

348
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:13,041
[BI'S SOLDIER 27B]
Commander!

349
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,000
The way out is forward?

350
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,250
That's right!

351
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,083
If we make it to those
Zhao soldiers up ahead,

352
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,833
the archers won't shoot us!

353
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:22,916
[BI] We need to all band
together to break through!

354
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,208
[SOLDIER 27B]
Get everyone together!

355
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:35,041
It's Gan Yang...
He'll strike their core unit!

356
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:38,250
[BI] Bi Battalion,
follow our commander!

357
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:44,666
General, a unit is
advancing toward us head-on!

358
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,708
[NARRATOR] Feng Ji was
untroubled by this news.

359
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:50,291
In truth, only about
1,500 men in the center

360
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,250
were actually advancing.

361
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,041
The rest were running away.

362
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,916
For now he'd follow his plan,

363
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,875
sending a mop-up brigade
of 3,000 to kill the runners.

364
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,000
[NARRATOR] At that point,
Qin's left force

365
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:04,250
would effectively be destroyed.

366
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:08,416
Then only the 1,500
advancing troops would be left.

367
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,000
Naturally, they wouldn't
be difficult opponents.

368
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:13,458
However, this is
where we catch a glimpse

369
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,791
of Feng Ji's battle viewpoint.

370
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,625
[NARRATOR]
"How can I defeat the enemy

371
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:20,708
as effectively and
efficiently as possible?"

372
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:22,791
Feng Ji's mind
was busy searching for

373
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:26,500
the best way to dispose
of the remaining 1,500.

374
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:28,583
As a result,
he did not notice at all

375
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:32,708
that the Fei Xin Force was
closing in on him from the side.

376
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:34,875
[ZHAO MESSENGER 27 A]
Report!

377
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:36,041
We're under attack
from the left!

378
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:37,541
There are a hundred of them.

379
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:40,000
They're on their way
to Formation 2.

380
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:42,583
Say what?!
Other signs of them?

381
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:43,791
[ZHAO MESSENGER 27A] No, Sir.

382
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:46,208
The hundred-man
squadron's operating alone.

383
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:48,125
A squadron acting alone?!

384
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:50,291
What is going on here?

385
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:55,583
[FENG JI] I see. So that's it.

386
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:05,375
[FENG JI] Wang Yi, I understand
you're after my head.

387
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:09,166
[FENG JI] Interesting.
Let's see you try to take it!

388
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,875
[yelling]

389
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:55,625
[XIN] Split up the squadron?!

390
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:58,458
[NARRATOR]
For the sake of victory!

391
00:24:58,541 --> 00:25:01,583
Xin, your path lies
ahead of you now!

392
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,666
Next Time:
"Wang Yi's Flying Arrow."
