1
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:12,541
[ZHAO ZHUANG]
Brigades 2 and 3 charge!

2
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:16,416
Time to eat a hole through the
Wang Yi infantry's flank!

3
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:32,041
[yelling]
[weapons clanging]

4
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:47,750
Sir, this is...

5
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:49,750
Oh yeah. This is all
going according

6
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:51,541
to General Wang Yi's plan!

7
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:59,541
[rumbling]

8
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,625
[WANG YI chuckles]

9
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:07,791
[WANG YI] Your formation has
broken down quite a bit.

10
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:11,500
I'll be taking your
headquarters now, Zhao Zhuang.

11
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:14,083
[NARRATOR]
The time: The Spring &amp; Autumn

12
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:15,958
and Warring States periods.

13
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:19,125
Xin, a nameless boy who rose to
the rank of squadron commander,

14
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:22,291
carried out a string of exploits
in the midst of fierce battle

15
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:24,541
that brought the
Qin army an advantage.

16
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:27,333
However, the enemy's commanding
general has appeared at last,

17
00:01:27,416 --> 00:01:30,125
and has proven to be
beyond all imagination.

18
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:33,083
That man, said to have a
previous tie to Wang Yi,

19
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:34,791
is named Pang Nuan.

20
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:38,625
The war situation is on
the verge of great change!

21
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:18,208
[JIE SHEN]
My lord, it's Wang Yi.

22
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:21,083
Wang Yi is now
personally charging!

23
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,958
Say what?

24
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:28,375
[ZHAO SOLDIER 35B]
It's Wang Yi! Wang Yi is coming!

25
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,458
[ZHAO SOLDIER 35C] Infantry to
the front! Spears at the ready!

26
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,333
[ZHAO SOLDIER 35B]
Kill him!

27
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:37,708
[SOLDIERS scream]

28
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:40,791
[NARRATOR] When Wang Yi
personally spearheads an attack,

29
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:43,625
the men he leads
become utter demons.

30
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:45,250
[SOLDIERS gasping]

31
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,875
[SOLDIERS yelling]

32
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:49,791
[NARRATOR] Few could stop
them, but the Zhao army

33
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:53,333
with its formation in disarray,
had no chance at all.

34
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:57,250
The Wang Yi Army
cavalry is amazing!

35
00:03:57,333 --> 00:04:01,166
Hurray for General Wang Yi!

36
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,041
[NARRATOR]
Meanwhile, Meng Wu's group,

37
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:06,000
which had essentially been
saved by Wang Yi's arrival,

38
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:09,125
watched quietly
from the sidelines.

39
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,333
Oh no...

40
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,625
What exactly is the matter, sir?

41
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,125
This absolutely is not

42
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,625
my lord's normal
fighting style...

43
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,291
What's going on?

44
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:26,083
Why is he rushing this battle
so aggressively like he is?

45
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:28,916
We're changing formations.

46
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,666
Move headquarters
back right now!

47
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,250
Sir. Fall back!
Fall back now!

48
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,541
[ZHAO ZHUANG] Wang Yi is
taking the vanguard himself

49
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,083
this early in battle?

50
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,708
[ZHAO ZHUANG] There's no need
to head off our escape.

51
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,750
We have our backs to the cliffs.

52
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:47,166
Why is he in such a hurry?

53
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:51,583
[ZHAO ZHUANG]
Don't tell me that he knows?!

54
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:59,041
[LI MU]
Once you are in the mountains,

55
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:02,333
lure General Wang Yi over here.

56
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:05,041
The soldiers I'll have
ready will go there

57
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:08,916
to ambush him.
A pretty simple plan.

58
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:14,000
[ZHAO ZHUANG]
Li Mu, rather, High General.

59
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:18,000
[LI MU] Yes? I still can't get
used to being called that.

60
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,375
[ZHAO ZHUANG] I can understand
everything that you are saying,

61
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:24,583
General, but it rests on
far too many assumptions.

62
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:27,000
Frankly, I'm not persuaded.

63
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:30,208
To begin with, what are the
chances that Wang Yi will appear

64
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,916
when we invade Qin?

65
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,916
[GONGSUN LONG] And sir,
even assuming Wang Yi comes,

66
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,708
I'm afraid I can't believe
your "sure-fire strategy"

67
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:42,125
will work on him.
Wang Yi is unpredictable.

68
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,500
You say you will
join the battle late,

69
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:47,416
but Wang Yi is sure to
notice you moving an army

70
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,166
of that massive size south,
like you are planning to.

71
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,875
He won't notice it.

72
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:55,583
After all, you two haven't
noticed, have you?

73
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:56,833
[BOTH gasp]

74
00:05:56,916 --> 00:06:01,625
An army of 130,000
gathered north and crushed

75
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:04,541
a Xiongnu army of 200,000.

76
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,583
What? That cannot be...

77
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:10,583
Impossible! I haven't heard
any word of it at all!

78
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:13,375
[LI MU] Because I'm
suppressing the information.

79
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:16,500
Though it would be fair
to call it "manipulating."

80
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:20,000
On that note, I've already
leaked to General Wang Yi

81
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:24,000
that Pang Nuan will become
Zhao's commanding general.

82
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,416
[LI MU]
That is bound to make him come.

83
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,041
You see, they have a history.

84
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,708
History?

85
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:33,458
[LI MU]
Fear not, my good sirs. Listen.

86
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:38,125
I guarantee you...
that we can win this war.

87
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:42,958
[ZHAO ZHUANG] This new Great,
calling himself Li Mu,

88
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,000
appeared out of nowhere,

89
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:50,250
yet everything he predicted
has come to pass.

90
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:54,125
[ZHAO ZHUANG] On his orders, no
one but myself and Gongsun Long

91
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:58,083
has been told of
the northern army.

92
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:00,500
Not even our own
commanding officers

93
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:03,291
like Li Bai and Feng Ji knew...

94
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:07,000
It's inconceivable that
Wang Yi could know.

95
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:12,833
Attention all,
infantry units, now charge!

96
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:17,250
[SOLDIERS yelling]

97
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,375
The left army's advancing!

98
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,083
Say what?! Oh, darn!

99
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,000
So now that we're
done being decoys,

100
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,375
we've got nothing to do?!

101
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:29,208
[COMBAT COMMANDER 35C]
Foot soldiers! Fall in now!

102
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:30,041
[WEI PING]
Huh?

103
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,375
Listen up!

104
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:34,708
We are all about to charge
into enemy headquarters!

105
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,583
The time starts right now!

106
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,875
[SOLDIERS cheer]

107
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,541
Ha! Now that's more like it!

108
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:44,291
[JIE SHEN] Ahead of us, the
enemy infantry is advancing.

109
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:47,791
The entire Qin army
is poised for attack.

110
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,166
[ZHAO SUBORDINATE 35A]
I can't believe they're taking

111
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,625
such a gamble when the
battle has only just begun!

112
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:55,125
Has Wang Yi lost his mind?!

113
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:59,166
[ZHAO ZHUANG] It's much too
unnatural for this to happen.

114
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,958
He does know Li Mu's strategy!

115
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:07,375
[NARRATOR] On the contrary, Wang
Yi did not know the strategy.

116
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:08,750
That's how perfect Li Mu's

117
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:12,208
suppression of
information had been.

118
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,000
However, by this time,

119
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:18,583
Wang Yi had predicted a Zhao
ambush in the works as well.

120
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,541
He sensed the truth
as he arrived

121
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,166
at the site of this showdown.

122
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,500
On the face of it,
this bell-shaped terrain

123
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,208
seemed to have Zhao trapped,

124
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:29,458
but if a different Zhao force
were to come in from behind,

125
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,583
Qin's army would be
the one trapped.

126
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:34,625
At that very moment, though,
Qin's combat commanders

127
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:35,875
in the mountains,

128
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:39,083
were holding off Zhao's
various other forces.

129
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:41,958
Push them all back!

130
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:45,125
We defend this land
to the death!

131
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:49,416
[NARRATOR] Thanks to these
commanders' furious fighting,

132
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,833
at a glance, it seemed
that no Zhao force

133
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,791
could get behind Wang Yi.

134
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,166
However, there was
an unseen enemy

135
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,000
somewhere in
these mountains.

136
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:02,208
When Wang Yi concluded this,

137
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:05,750
it answered the
suspicions he'd harbored

138
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:09,625
since Zhao headquarters
had entered the mountains.

139
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:12,125
[WANG YI chuckles]

140
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,583
[NARRATOR]
From there, he extrapolated.

141
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,875
[NARRATOR] Ever since
his headquarters' flags

142
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,500
had gone out of sight,

143
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:23,666
Wang Yi had searched for
the enemy's location.

144
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,708
His search party had not come
across the Zhao ambushers.

145
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:30,750
This was no surprise;
he knew how thoroughly

146
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,666
his enemy strategized.

147
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,833
These reinforcements would have
dispersed and hidden themselves,

148
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:38,416
outside of his search radius.

149
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,208
This meant the mountain
terrain worked against Zhao

150
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,666
at the moment.

151
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,416
[NARRATOR] Wang Yi felt
confident that he could

152
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,666
settle the battle before
the ambush party arrived.

153
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,750
[WANG YI chuckles]

154
00:09:56,833 --> 00:10:01,250
[WANG YI] Whoever is behind this
plan, it's an interesting one.

155
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:05,500
Still, you weren't careful
enough in the final stages.

156
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:08,083
If I choose to...

157
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,875
[SOLDIERS yelling]

158
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,791
[WANG YI] ...I can slaughter
Zhao Zhuang's army

159
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,625
in an instant.

160
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,708
[ZHENG] Yang Duanhe
told us of a Zhao army

161
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:25,000
we had no knowledge of.

162
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:29,625
This ambush must be
Li Mu's primary objective.

163
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:33,166
If I can see that from
here in Xianyang,

164
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,875
Wang Yi would have
already realized it.

165
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,250
[LORD CHANGWEN] This Li Mu
individual has no name

166
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,750
for himself.
I'm sure he can't outdo

167
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:43,416
Wang Yi's battle experience
and instinct.

168
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,625
[ZHENG]
What bothers me though is this:

169
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:50,708
Why exactly is Pang Nuan
Zhao's commanding general?

170
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:54,416
If you are indeed right
that he is not the sort

171
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,541
to lead an army of men,

172
00:10:56,625 --> 00:11:00,333
isn't the rank of commanding
general disproportionately high?

173
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:02,333
You're right, sir.

174
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:03,500
I'm unsure...

175
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:05,416
Could Li Mu have
known everything

176
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,458
when he chose him
to lead for us?

to the front and defend...

[TENG SUBORDINATE 35A]
Sir, what's that sound?

[JIE SHEN] What's that? There's
shouting at the front lines!

204
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,916
It's General Pang Nuan.

205

[LORD CHANGWEN]
Your Highness...

206
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:23,166
Do you suggest Li Mu
deliberately gave Pang Nuan

207
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,958
this rank, knowing of his
history with Wang Yi?

208
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,750
[ZHENG] He's more likely
a "commanding general"

209
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:29,958
in name only.

210
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,625
In truth, he's the bait
to lure Wang Yi

to the battlefield.

212

[ZHENG] Wang Yi, the last of
the six great generals...

213
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,500
A man feared as the
"Strange Bird of Qin,"

214
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:47,250
yet once thought to have
abandoned the field for good.

215
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:50,000
[ZHENG] But, this Pang
Nuan drew him back

216
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,958
into the field once again.

217
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,083
What could drive
Wang Yi to that?

218

Yes, I was right, indeed.

[LORD CHANGWEN]
Sire.

221
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,833
Who was Liao, the great
general felled by Pang Nuan?

222
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,750
Who was he, exactly?

223
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,541
Do I assume correctly that Liao

224
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:10,291
was someone quite special
to Wang Yi, then?

225

means I employ.

is my godliness!

kill thee here

that I am a god of war!

you have not changed.

that I will kill you here

00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,541
Should we really pull
back to headquarters?

316
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,125
The winner of this duel

317
00:19:57,208 --> 00:20:01,875
will win the entire war!
What meaning is there in this?!

318
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:04,250
It's just not that simple.

319
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,416
Don't forget the
pinnacle of our army

320
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,000
isn't General Pang Nuan,

321
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:12,000
but our headquarters, with me
at the very center of it.

322
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:15,125
Even assuming that
Pang Nuan fells Wang Yi,

323
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,500
if our headquarters
has fallen as well,

324
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,750
we won't be able to
counter Qin's moves.

325
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:24,250
[ZHAO ZHUANG] Conversely, even
assuming Pang Nuan is felled,

326
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:27,541
if our headquarters is intact,
Zhao can regroup.

327
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,000
What you need to
understand is that for Qin

328
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:33,208
to win this whole war,
they have to fell us first.

329
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:36,833
And Wang Yi knows
that quite well of course.

330
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,666
That's why his cavalry
is coming for us

331
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,833
instead of rushing to him.

332
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,375
[ZHAO ZHUANG] Take care.
They're tough opponents.

333
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,166
[FEIXIN FORCE 35A]
Er, excuse us...

334
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,666
Maybe it wasn't fair
to the other foot soldiers

335
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,000
for us to come watch
instead of fighting.

336
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,500
Don't be stupid, Wei Ping.

337
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,750
If things go wrong,
the bloodiest fighting

338
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,750
will happen exactly right here.

339
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:05,791
Y-You're right...

340
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,916
Who really cares about that?

341
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,916
Right now, the important thing
is the generals' duel!

342
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:25,375
[XIN] General Wang Yi
seems to be losing?!

343
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,458
That Pang Nuan...

344
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:37,083
Wound my body and the pain
just vanisheth with time.

345
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,916
But, wound my soul and the pain

346
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,625
never fully vanisheth,
no matter how many years pass.

347
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:48,041
Wang Yi, it must be
the same for thee.

348
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:51,083
That is why thou art here!

349
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:53,250
Rage is power.

350
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:56,541
Remember how thy comrade
died that very--

351
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:04,708
Drew blood!

352
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,416
General Pang Nuan!

353
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:14,333
[QIN SOLDIERS] General
Wang Yi! General Wang Yi!

354
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,625
[XIN] "Comrade"?

355
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:17,416
[WANG YI chuckles]

356
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,041
[WANG YI]
Rest easy, Pang Nuan.

357
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:23,000
My wound has not healed either.

358
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:28,083
I am sure you will be
very happy to know.

359
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:29,166
[LORD CHANGWEN]
Very well, Sire.

360
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,083
I shall tell you everything.

361
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:33,916
There is a reason as to why

362
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,666
so uncommonly little
is known about Liao.

363
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:40,375
King Zhao forbid
anyone to speak of it.

364
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:41,833
[ZHENG] King Zhao?

365
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:43,541
[LORD CHANGWEN]
Liao's secret was a truly

366
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:46,041
highly complicated one, you see.

367
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:48,041
What's important at
the moment, however,

368
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:51,958
is that Liao was someone
dearly important to Wang Yi

369
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:53,875
personally at that time.

370
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:08,875
[LORD CHANGWEN] The great
general Liao was a woman.

371
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,125
What's more...

372
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:20,458
The woman who was
to be Wang Yi's wife.

373
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:56,500
[WANG YI] Soon you'll have
the last one, won't you, Liao?

374
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:58,250
[NARRATOR]
A future trampled underfoot.

375
00:24:58,333 --> 00:24:59,875
When the blood can't
be shed in tears

376
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:01,708
it comes back as a bloodbath.

377
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:04,791
Next Time:
"Wang Yi and Liao."
