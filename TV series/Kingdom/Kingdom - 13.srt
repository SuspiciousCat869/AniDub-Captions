I'm surprised.

162
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,666
I thought you would've run
away crying and screaming,

163
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,625
but you look relaxed.

164
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:35,125
You've made peace
with dying, jerk?

165
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,291
Execution.

166
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:42,333
[XIN]
Huh?

167
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:47,250
For the crime of
lowborn riffraff like you

168
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,625
setting foot in the
exalted Royal Court--

169
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,208
Execution.

170
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,750
[CHENG JIAO] For the crime
of you dung-beetles

171
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:58,125
breathing the air in
the same place as me--

172
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,583
Execution.

173
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,833
[XIN chuckles]

174
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,958
That sounds just about right.

175
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:07,375
The way you're being
right now, strikes me

176
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,875
as the most "royal" reaction.

177
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:13,708
I was with him this
whole time, so I'd forgotten.

178
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,833
How dare you
address your King

179
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:20,291
as simply "you"? Are you
just wrong in the head?

180
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:23,750
Hey now, the one who's
wrong in the head is you.

181
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,583
Zheng is the King of Qin.

182
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:29,625
You are no more
than a measly traitor!

183
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:38,750
Do not expect to
die quickly, little worm.

184
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:41,875
I'll tear your limbs off
while you're still alive.

185
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:44,291
Just try it.

186
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,958
[CHENG JIAO cackles]

What is he, then?

195
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,958
[BI]
What is he?

196
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,125
Lan Kai is his name.

197
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,291
[WANG YI]
Teng, are you here?

198
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,541
Yes. Here, sir.

199
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,875
Did you go down to the corridor?

200
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:53,458
Yes, I was just
about to head there.

201
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,625
No need to there.

202
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:59,416
There's another place I'd
like you to go instead.

203
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,041
[TENG]
Yes, as you wish, sir.

204
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,083
[WANG YI]
I mean right away.

205
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,166
[TENG]
Sir.

206
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:11,791
[COMMANDER 13A]
It's taking too long.

207
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:14,041
What on earth is
happening inside?

208
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,833
She said stand by,

209
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,208
but wouldn't it be
better to make a move?

210
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,541
Correct. If we breach the gates

211
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:23,666
and shut them before that
army of 80,000 comes...

212
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,791
Absolutely.

213
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:32,875
[bells jingling]

Don't take matters into
your hands, you fools.

215

If the order is stand by,
then stand by, you fools.

[LAN KAI yells]

217
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,625
If the strength of
Tajifu and the others

218
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:04,333
can't hurt that thing,
how are we gonna hurt him?

219
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,625
[BA JIO]
Don't lay a hand on him.

220
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:23,083
Ba Jio... what are
you trying to do?

221
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:32,750
[BA JIO] I'm reverting to
the past for a moment.

222
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,291
Since these words
come from the elders

223
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:48,041
of the mountain-folk,
we would like to obey, but--

224
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,625
We have deep
faith in our king.

225
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,000
W-We have faith
in ours, too.

226
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,500
H-However--

227
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:58,291
Every single one inside
was cleverly handpicked.

228
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:02,291
The 40 taken were the most
experienced of each tribe,

229
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:05,125
and leading them all
is the mountain king,

230
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,458
the great Yang Duanhe.

231
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:10,625
[ELDER A] What's more,
Ba Jio is there too.

232
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:20,083
[LAN KAI growls]

233
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,958
My, what amazing movement...

234
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:27,833
The monster is recoiling.
The situation's shifted.

235
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,833
[DIAO]
Amazing, Commander!

236
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:36,541
[DIAO]
Amazing, but scary somehow.

237
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,500
[DIAO]
He's not a human; he's a beast.

238
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:46,416
Ba Jio... the man Xin
calls "Commander"?

239
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,833
Ba Jio was a
real pitiable boy.

240
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:55,791
We'd just set out on a campaign
to unify the mountain realm...

241
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:59,750
[ELDER A] When we split up to
enter the remote northern peaks,

242
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:02,541
three lookouts vanished.

243
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:06,666
[ELDER A] Searching nearby
turned up three dead bodies,

244
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:12,750
all of them brutally damaged
as though ravaged by a beast.

245
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:16,333
In that land, we still
had an unseen enemy.

246
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:20,833
We formed a squad of 20,
and had them search the area.

247
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,583
But as the days passed,

248
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:27,083
not a single one returned.
Feeling an ill foreboding,

249
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,250
we elected to move our
main force to search

250
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,666
for the missing squad of 20.

251
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,625
Soon after we began the search,

252
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:40,041
we were able to find
the terrible, vicious beast.

253
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:45,750
And around it were the
savaged husks of the 20 men.

254
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,666
[growling]

255
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:06,375
[ELDER A] Ba Jio's tribe
had perished in a battle

256
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:10,791
some years before.
Only he survived.

257
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,333
In living for years
and years all alone

258
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:17,625
in the mountains, he became
something other than human.

259
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:21,125
Capturing him was
a real struggle, actually...

260
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,458
[ELDER A chuckles]

261
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,958
[YANG DUANHE] If you
were to remain a beast,

262
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,708
I'll end your
misery here and now.

263
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,666
But if you restate
your humanity

264
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:43,791
and swear loyalty to me,
we'll take you in as family.

265
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,583
[ELDER A]
At that time, Ba Jio didn't

266
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:55,750
understand human language.

267
00:19:57,833 --> 00:20:01,500
[ELDER A] But he nonetheless
cried at the top of his lungs.

268
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:05,958
Then Yang Duanhe welcomed
Ba Jio into our tribe.

269
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:11,041
[ELDER A] Ba Jio steadily
regained his humanity,

270
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:15,458
learned language, and
became an able warrior.

271
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:19,750
But to this day,
the beast of those times

272
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:23,375
still resides within his soul.

273
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,541
If ever that
beast is released,

274
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:30,083
it would truly be nothing short
of formidable, to put it mildly.

275
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,166
Whoa...

276
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:40,791
He's fast...

277
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,375
Incredible.

278
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:09,083
That monster is
completely at his mercy.

279
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:12,250
So this is Ba Jio's
truest form.

280
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:15,208

Lan Kai! He's being
pressed back now!

285
00:21:56,625 --> 00:22:00,583
That monster couldn't
be losing. Am I right?!

286
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:14,958
He won! Amazing, Commander!
You beat that monstrosity!

Why do you think I've kept
a freak like you as a pet?

I've taught you this:

00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:35,750
The only worth in your existence
comes from you killing people.

If not, you will be punished.
