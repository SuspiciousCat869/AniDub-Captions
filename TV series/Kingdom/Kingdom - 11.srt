1
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:11,458
Let's do this!

2
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:22,375
[XIN]
That hurt!

3
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,250
[BI]
He... He made it!

4
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:38,333
Kill this insolent monkey-boy!

5
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:41,125
[XIN]
You're too late, boys!

6
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,458
This fight is the
memorial for Piao,

7
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:45,750
so there'll be no mercy.

8
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:52,625
[NARRATOR]
Ancient China...

9
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:58,666
The time of the sages was over,
swept away by base human greed.

10
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,208
Over five long and
harrowing centuries,

11
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:03,791
an endless storm of war, hatred,

12
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:06,083
and strife raged
across the land,

13
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,416
consuming everything
in its wake.

14
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:14,791
Desire. Pleasure. Suffering.
Terror. All without end.

15
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:18,333
In a time filled with so much
cruelty and destruction,

16
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:21,541
small wonder that this
era was known as...

17
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:22,958
..."the dragon."

18
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:29,416
As though scorched by
the flames of the dragon,

19
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,041
over a hundred nations fell,
one after the other,

20
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:36,125
winnowed away until
only seven remained.

21
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:40,750
Yan... Qi... Zhao...

22
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:43,750
Wei... Han... Chu...

23
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:45,833
...and lastly, Qin.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,708
Like lions trying to
devour their rivals,

25
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:53,291
these seven kingdoms lunged
at each other's throats

26
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:54,500
again and again,

27
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:58,250
their swords stained
with ambition and blood.

28
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:01,958
This was the era of the Spring
and Autumn Warring States.

29
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:04,583
Now, from Qin, the
westernmost kingdom,

30
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,666
a great wind of history
is about to blow.

31
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,958
This is the tale of a
nameless boy and a young king

32
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:15,000
who ran the gauntlet
in this age of strife.

33
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,958
Defend the gate!

34
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,416
[GUARDS yell]

35
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,250
[XIN yells]

[JIANG, JIE SHI gasp]

[XIN grunting]

39
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,416
[JIANG] At this rate, the Red
Turtle Gate will be breached!

40
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,875
[JIE SHI]
The scoundrels...

00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:27,333
[XIN grunting]

42
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,125
[XIN]
Ta-daaa!

43
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,708
That was amazing work, Xin.

44
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,291
No sweat.

45
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,625
Hurry! Get us out of here!

46
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:06,458
Target that carriage!
That's Minister Jie Shi!

47
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,416
Wait, that's Minister Jie Shi?

48
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,708
Isn't he one of the ringleaders
of this whole plot?

49
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,916
[XIN]
Why didn't you just say so?!

50
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,666
[LAN KAI growls]

51
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,958
What's with you?
What is it, Lan Kai?

52
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:34,291
Go faster! Push the
horses harder!

53
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:42,375
Oh no! Sir, they're
going to catch us!

54
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:48,291
Wh-What are
you doing?! My lord?!

55
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,625
What's that guy's problem?

56
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:00,250
He threw his own
underling at us!

57
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,666
[DIAO]
That's just sick!

58
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,833
That old guy's the
scum of the earth!

59
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:06,250
It's not only Minister
Jie, unfortunately.

60
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,583
[BI]
Aside from Lord Changwen,

61
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,500
most of the ministers who
hang around the Royal Court

62
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,458
are just that sort of person.

63
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,958
[XIN]
Oh man! Those guys got a horse!

64
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,000
They're gonna get
to the fun before me!

65
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,666
What on earth...?!

66
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,708
[DIAO] This battle is finishing
up faster than I thought.

67
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,916
It's thanks to His Majesty
and my Lord Changwen.

68
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,916
Their scheme to draw out
Jie Shi was a success!

69
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:40,916
It kinda stings to
see somebody else

70
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,291
take the ringleader's head,

71
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,916
but at least that
old man is finished now!

72
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,833
[YANG DUANHE]
Halt!

73
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,500
That's Si Shi!

74
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,875
[DIAO] Th-There's even
more soldiers now.

75
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:33,208
I'm getting scared again, Xin...

76
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,625
Well done, Si Shi.

77
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:43,583
My lord.

78
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,875
Your timing is impeccable.

79
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:49,875
But how were you able to figure
out they were deceiving us?

80
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,708
When they first arrived
in the capital...

81
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,583
[SI SHI] I noticed that
a few of them were wearing

82
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,666
something shiny under
their straw coats.

83
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:04,416
[SI SHI]
I suspected it was armor.

84
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,833
Meaning there are
flatlanders among them?

85
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:10,375
It's very likely that the
mountain folk came down

86
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:13,750
because someone from the
flatlands prompted them to.

87
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:16,875
However...

88
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:19,833
There are very few flatlanders
who could hope to inspire

89
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,916
mountain folk into action.

90
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,666
It couldn't be!

91
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,041
If his head hasn't
turned up by now,

92
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:29,583
then it most certainly could be.

93
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,416
I know you are there,
Ying Zheng.

94
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,041
Reveal yourself, King of Qin!

95
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,916
Si Shi's troops are
on a different level.

96
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,958
They're all
battle-hardened veterans.

97
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:41,541
This time, our disadvantage
in numbers will matter.

98
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,291
[LORD CHANGWEN]
It will, indeed.

99
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,666
[ZHENG]
Split off Bi's wing.

100
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,708
[LORD CHANGWEN]
Yes, Your Majesty.

101
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,791
[SI SHI]
What's the matter?

102
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,000
[LORD CHANGWEN]
Bi!

103
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,083
My lord?

104
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,125
We know Your Majesty is there.

105
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:58,583
Don't bother
concealing yourself.

106
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,708
We will find you!

107
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:01,916
Aye, sir.

108
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,375
[LORD CHANGWEN]
I pray you'll succeed.

109
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:04,833
Right.

110
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,833
[SI SHI] Come forth and show
yourself, King Ying Zheng!

111
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:31,291
It is Ying Zheng!

112
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,250
Have you enjoyed
your fleeting glory,

113
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:36,041
Minister Jie Shi?

114
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:38,666
So, was it enough for you?

115
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,625
Coming forward
with no escort, huh?

116
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,375
Unwise of you.

117
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:53,083
What is that idiot doing?

118
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,916
He's gonna get
picked off from there!

119
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,666
[BI]
It's fine.

120
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,041
The crossbow bolts can't
reach him from there.

121
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,916
[XIN]
Bi, my man...

122
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,416
Ba Jio?

123
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,041
Everyone from here to the right
will break off on my mark.

124
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:07,083
When I give the command,
follow me.

125
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,541
[BA JIO]
Understood.

126
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:09,958
Wait, we're gonna break off?

127
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,166
[BI] That's right.
Let's do this, Xin.

128
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,541
Hey, hold on!

129
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,708
These new troops have
a totally different aura

130
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:17,291
than the last bunch we took on.

131
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,833
If Zheng doesn't have the
commander or me with him,

132
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,541
he'll be in real trouble!

133
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,708
That's actually
part of the plan.

134
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,083
[BI] While the King draws
the enemy forces to him,

135
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:31,041
we'll strike at Cheng Jiao
in the inner sanctum!

136
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,708
[XIN gasps]

137
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:40,291
[WANG YI] Hmm...
isn't this King admirable?

138
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,208
Things have certainly
gotten interesting

139
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:43,875
all of a sudden.

140
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,083
Charge forward!

141
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,833
Fill those who oppose
you full of holes!

142
00:10:55,916 --> 00:11:00,416
And glory to the man who
chops off the King's head!

143
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,541
[JIE SHI]
Huh?

144
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,625
That bunch is headed
for the corridor.

145
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,375
There may only be a few of them,

146
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,375
but isn't it dangerous
to lose sight of them

147
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,166
and let them run amok inside?

148
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,541
Do not worry yourself, my lord.

149
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:16,208
Zuo Ci is waiting in
the corridor for them.

150
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:33,791
[XIN]
All right! Go to it, Tajifu!

151
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,958
[XIN]
Ow!

152
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,708
He did it!

153
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:42,083
Right. We're going in.

154
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,041
[BI]
He'll be fine.

155
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:48,833
Lord Changwen and the mountain
folk are with His Majesty.

156
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,833
It's time for us to
play our own part

157
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,333
in this battle, Xin.

158
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,083
Yeah, I know that.

159
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,125
[XIN]
Speed it up, Bi!

160
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,666
Let's get this show going!

161
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,166
Ready a volley!

162
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,625
Wei Xing's crossbowmen
are known and feared

163
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:10,125
far and wide,
all over the realm.

164
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,625
Before they get our range,

165
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:14,958
let us fall back and reformulate
our tactics, Your Majesty.

166
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,000
[YANG DUANHE]
There's no need for that.

167
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,750
Yang Duanhe...

168
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,000
[YANG DUANHE]
The blood of the mountain folk

169
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,375
is just getting stirred up.

170
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:45,041
[panting]

171
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,416
[BI]
This way.

172
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,458
[XIN]
Hey, Bi, hate to ask...

173
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,500
but are you sure that
we're going the right way

174
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:59,125
to find that little
jerk, Cheng Jiao?

175
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,750
Well, the route from this
corridor to the inner sanctum

176
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,250
is a pretty complex labyrinth.

177
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:06,000
Most people couldn't
hope to ever traverse it.

178
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,333
[XIN]
What?

179
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,875
[BI] But don't worry,
we'll be fine.

180
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:22,833
We used them to lead
Lord Piao to escape before.

181
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:25,250
I know every route
to the throne room.

182
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,750
I know where we're going.

183
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,291
Oh-ho!

184
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:32,041
So you're the go-to guy for all
this stuff, eh, Bi, my man?

185
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,708
You're all fired up
for this, aren't you?

186
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,458
[BI]
Of course I am!

187
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:39,000
From the moment we led
Lord Piao out until now,

188
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:42,666
countless lives
have been sacrificed.

189
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,041
I was the lieutenant.

190
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,916
The blame for those
losses weighs on me

191
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,458
too heavily for words.

192
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,375
I'd give my life to
ensure all those deaths

193
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:52,833
weren't in vain; to take down
Cheng Jiao once and for all.

194
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:58,375
[XIN] You can't take down
Cheng Jiao if you're dead!

195
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:08,750
What is it, Yang Duanhe?
Let's pull back.

196
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,500
The mountain folk are strong...

197
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:14,333
but even they can't fend off
that many crossbow bolts.

198
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:16,333
[LORD CHANGWEN]
We must fall back!

199
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,875
[YANG DUANHE] We mountain
folk do not give ground

200
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,958
to mere arrows!

201
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,291
[YANG DUANHE]
Prepare to charge!

202
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:35,083
This is madness! Don't do this!

203
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,125
Stupid monkeys.

204
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,916
Seems they are
intent on taking on

205
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,875
my elite archery
forces and dying.

206
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,958
[WEI XING]
This will be fun.

207
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:53,333
All forces, approach
closer to the targets!

208
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:57,250
Make sure every single
arrow hit its mark!

209
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,875
[LORD CHANGWEN]
They'll be wiped out.

210
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,041
Pull them back, Yang Duanhe!

211
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:04,416
[ZHENG]
No. We should follow them, too.

212
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,250
Your Majesty...

213
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:27,958
[WEI XING] All of you,
loose a volley! Shoot!

214
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,750
[YANG DUANHE]
Charge!

215
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:42,583
Impossible!

216
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:45,375
Those three men were
playing dead all this time?

217
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:52,333
[WEI XING]
Damn you! You were still alive?!

218
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:53,875
[WEI XING]
What are you waiting for?

219
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,541
Move forward!
Release a volley into them!

220
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,083
What the...?

221
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,416
What is the meaning of all this?

222
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,041
Si Shi!

223
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,833
Don't just stand there
looking blank!

224
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:15,291
You have to come up
with some sort of plan!

225
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,500
Messenger!

226
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,083
[MESSENGER 11A]
Yes, sir!

227
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,875
Assemble all the guards
of the Royal Court!

228
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:23,125
We will settle
things right here!

229
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,041
Only this many?

230
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,208
Zuo Ci?

231
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,041
What, you know this guy?

232
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:15,458
He's Si Shi's right hand man
and Jie Shi's chief executioner.

233
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:18,416
Chief executioner?

234
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,125
[BI] In the power struggle
between Lü Buwei and Jie Shi,

235
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,875
there've been tit-for-tat
assassinations

236
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:26,083
of each faction's
strongest players.

237
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:30,333
One of the main culprits
behind the scenes was Zuo Ci.

238
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,000
A number of my dearest friends

239
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,166
have been struck
down by his hand.

240
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,875
So he's kind of a
killer for hire, huh?

241
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:39,250
Not to worry. I got this.

242
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,250
I'll cut down
this bastard myself.

243
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,708
Don't underestimate Zuo Ci.

244
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:47,625
Yes, he can wear an assassin's
mask and be shadowy and sneaky,

245
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:51,000
but he's also a warrior
by nature, born and bred.

246
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,500
On the other hand...

247
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,791
Right now, Zuo Ci and Wei Xing
are the only people at court 

248
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:04,083
who are capable of leading
soldiers into battle.

249
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,875
If we can break through here,

250
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:08,666
the way to the
throne room is clear!

251
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,125
This is the moment
of truth, everyone!

252
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:14,000
Oh yeah! You heard
him, Commander!

253
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,458
[BA JIO]
I will kill every one of them.

254
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:27,958
[yelling]

255
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:00,791
[LORD CHANGWEN] This is the
might of the mountain folk.

256
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:05,416
I thought I knew what they were
capable of, but I had no idea...

257
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,958
Yang Duanhe, it seems
I underestimated

258
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,958
the true strength
of your people.

259
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:14,500
I was rude in telling you
to fall back. My apologies.

260
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,583
[YANG DUANHE]
No apologies needed.

261
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:19,875
Your judgment was sound,
given the situation.

262
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,125
However...

263
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,416
[YANG DUANHE]
The mountain people

264
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,541
have our own
way of fighting!

265
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:45,375
A woman?!

266
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:48,000
The mountain king,
Yang Duanhe...

267
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,208
...is a woman?!

268
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:52,000
Taking her out would be
a huge achievement!

269
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,208
Rewards and promotions
are ours for the taking!

270
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,916
We'll slit that
white throat of hers!

271
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,833
Don't leave a
single enemy alive.

272
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,708
It's a festival of blood!

273
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,250
[XIN yells]

274
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:46,750
[DIAO] Incredible...
this is too amazing for words!

275
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:51,791
[DIAO]
Get 'em! Get 'em all!

276
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:56,750
[MOUNTAIN FOLK 11K]
He's not here...

277
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,416
Where did he go?

278
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,083
[ZUO CI]
Here I am.

279
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:12,541
[XIN gasps]

280
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,291
Next.

281
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,166
[ZUO CI] You've
overestimated yourselves...

282
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,125
... you worms.

283
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,750
[BI]
Dammit... How can this be?

284
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,916
[BI]
With only two strokes,

285
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,666
he's completely turned
the tide of battle.

286
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:00,666
S-So this... this is Zuo Ci!

287
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:04,916
[BI]
Wh-What am I doing?

288
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,208
I-I should set the example
and stand before him,

289
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:12,000
rally our men's fighting
spirit... but still...

290
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:14,291
Even though I-I know what to do,

291
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,083
my body won't move!

292
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:18,416
I can't move!

293
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:24,250
[XIN]
Hey, hey.

294
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:26,208
Overestimating ourselves?

295
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:29,250
I think that's more your style.

296
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:31,750
Idiot-face!

297
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:37,875
[BI]
Xin!

298
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:53,833
That powerful aura...
is it Ba Jio?

299
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:57,833
No. I suspect
it's from that boy.

300
00:22:57,916 --> 00:23:00,583
By the feel of it,
it looks like the real fight

301
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:02,958
is about to begin in there.

302
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:56,541
[XIN] This is the sword
bequeathed to me by Piao!

303
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:59,500
[NARRATOR] He's given
his blood, sweat, and tears.

304
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:01,875
Only one last measure
can be taken...

305
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:04,875
Next Time:
The Ultimate Sword-Blow.
