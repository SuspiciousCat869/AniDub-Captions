1
00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:14,791
[XIN grunting]

2
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,291
Ohhh, come on!

3
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:26,166
We've been walking for
three days already.

4
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,083
When the hell are we
gonna get back home?

5
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:29,583
[PIAO] Don't waste
your breath, Xin.

6
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:31,375
You'll just tire yourself out.

7
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:33,166
But Piao...

8
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,500
Three more days' walk
and we'll get to the village.

9
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:37,833
Just think of it
as good conditioning.

10
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:39,833
[XIN] Usually for this
distance and this load,

11
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:41,000
you'd use a horse-cart.

12
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,375
What, do servants
rate lower than horses?

13
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:44,916
[PIAO] Yeah, and
that's why we're doing

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,083
all this conditioning...
to break free of being servants.

15
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:50,583
Yeah, I know.

16
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:52,541
I mean, I get it, but still...

17
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:53,625
[rumbling]

18
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:54,833
Huh?

19
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:08,083
What the heck
is that sound?

20
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:09,583
[PIAO]
Is it an earthquake?

21
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:12,416
[XIN] No, wait...
it's coming from over there!

22
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,500
[PIAO] It is!

23
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:16,166
[NARRATOR] Battle.

24
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,708
The scene unfolding
before the two boys' eyes

25
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:22,791
was the first glimpse they had
ever had of real warfare.

26
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:27,791
[NARRATOR] In truth,
it was nothing more

27
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:29,375
than a mere border skirmish,

28
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:32,458
a small, unremarkable fight
with a neighboring country.

29
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:35,666
But in it, the two men
could see their own futures

30
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,416
clear as day, and together,
they had the same thought...

31
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,750
"This is the world where
we will live out our lives!"

32
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:46,083
[XIN] Piao!
This is a real battle!

33
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,666
[PIAO] Yes!

34
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,375
And one day, you and I will be
the heroes of a fight like this!

35
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,250
[NARRATOR] Ancient China...

36
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:04,708
The time of the sages was over,
swept away by base human greed.

37
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:07,625
Over five long and
harrowing centuries,

38
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:11,583
an endless storm of war,
hatred, and strife raged

39
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:15,125
across the land, consuming
everything in its wake.

40
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:19,291
Desire. Pleasure.
Suffering. Terror.

41
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:21,125
All without end.

42
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:25,333
In a time filled with so
much cruelty and destruction,

43
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:28,791
small wonder that
this era was known as...

44
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,666
"the dragon."

45
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:36,291
[NARRATOR] As though scorched
by the flames of the dragon,

46
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:39,750
over a hundred nations fell,
one after another,

47
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:43,083
winnowed away until
only seven remained.

48
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:50,291
[NARRATOR] Yan, Qi,
Zhao, Wei, Han, Chu...

49
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,958
...and lastly, Qin.

50
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:57,250
[NARRATOR] Like lions trying
to devour their rivals,

51
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,791
these seven kingdoms
lunged at each other's throats

52
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:02,000
again and again,
their swords stained

53
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,583
with ambition and blood.

54
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:08,291
This was the era of the Spring
and Autumn Warring States.

55
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,958
Now, from Qin,
the westernmost kingdom,

56
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:13,625
a great wind of history
is about to blow.

57
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:19,333
[NARRATOR] This is the tale of
a nameless boy and a King

58
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:22,791
who ran the gauntlet
in this age of strife.

59
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,291
Yah!

60
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,000
[PIAO] Take that!

61
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,916
[XIN] It's not over yet!

62
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:37,000
[XIN and PIAO continue sparring]

63
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,625
[XIN] You missed again!

64
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,875
You and your brute
strength... huh?

65
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:11,833
[PIAO] Over here!

66
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,000
[PIAO] Hey.

67
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,041
Hooray!

68
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:26,666
That makes 333 wins,
332 losses, and 587 draws!

69
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,916
That means I'm up by one!

70
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,041
Damn it! One more match!
Just one more!

71
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,125
[PIAO] Huh?

72
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,083
Gotcha!

73
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,250
No, wait!
Someone's coming.

74
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:04,166
--[XIN groans]

75
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,291
--[PIAO] Huh?
--[XIN groans]

76
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,291
Oh, that actually hit you?

77
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,375
What are you
lookin' at, old man?

78
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:31,541
[XIN] Yeah, that's right!

79
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,333
[PIAO] Stupid, stupid,
stupid, stupid!

80
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:34,458
[PIAO] You idiot!

81
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,625
Look at his clothes,
and that carriage!

82
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:39,958
He's got to be a warrior
of high stature!

83
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,625
That doesn't mean
anything to me!

84
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,833
It means he could
have you killed!

85
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,708
What's with you boys?

86
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,875
Weren't you just
squabbling a minute ago?

87
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,583
[XIN] It wasn't a squabble,
it was a match!

88
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:53,666
And thanks to you,
old man, I lost!

89
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,208
Old man?

90
00:08:55,291 --> 00:09:01,458
Out of 1,253 matches, I've won
332, lost 334, and tied 587!

91
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,625
Now, thanks to you,
for the first time this year,

92
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:04,625
I'm two behind!

93
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,500
1,253 matches?

94
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,333
[laughs]

95
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,375
So now the truth comes out.

96
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,791
You're a little boy who likes
to tell some tall tales

97
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,166
and make yourself look good.

98
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,916
[laughs]

99
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,541
You... you mean to tell me...

100
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:27,708
...that the two of you
have fought

101
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:30,041
over a thousand bouts
of that intensity?

102
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:35,750
That's not the sort of
thing normal people do...

103
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,583
[laughs]

104
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:40,125
I'm not surprised
you're shocked, sir.

105
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:44,208
A distinguished person like
yourself might not understand.

106
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:47,125
The two of us are orphans.

107
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,541
[XIN] Yeah, that's right.

108
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:58,291
We lost our families in the war
and were sold as slaves.

109
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,583
Now, we only
rank as servants.

110
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:01,958
[PIAO] As you can imagine,

111
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,291
we haven't inherited anything
from our parents...

112
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:07,041
...unless you count the
strength in our bodies.

113
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:11,750
But that's all the
inheritance we need!

114
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,708
Right. So long as these bodies

115
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:16,625
can still swing our swords,
Xin and I have enough!

116
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,583
[XIN] Warfare took
everything from us,

117
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,958
so we'll use warfare to
take just as much back!

118
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,375
[PIAO] That's right!

119
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,416
[XIN] We're gonna go into battle
and achieve greatness!

120
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,791
[PIAO] With the strength
and technique

121
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:32,750
we've built up together,
we'll win fortune and fame!

122
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,208
[XIN] We'll rise up
from the very bottom

123
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:38,750
and build our own houses!

124
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,208
[PIAO]
Yeah, magnificent mansions

125
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,125
with huge gardens
and giant gates!

126
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,333
[XIN] I'm gonna get a pretty
bride from a good family,

127
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:45,833
and make lots of babies,

128
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:49,083
and employ more household
servants than you can count!

129
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,083
[XIN, PIAO] 
And most importantly...

130
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,875
...we will make our names
echo across all of China.

131
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,125
And together, we'll become

132
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:10,041
the most powerful generals
in all the world!

133
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:24,791
[laughing]

134
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,708
Ugh! He's laughing at us again!

135
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,291
I'll kill him!

136
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,875
[LORD CHANGWEN]
This encounter...

137
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,875
could be the one
that finally sweeps away

138
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,000
the dark clouds surrounding Qin.

139
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,375
[NARRATOR] Xianyang, the capital
of the Kingdom of Qin.

140
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,833
[NARRATOR] At that time,
the royal court was divided,

141
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:03,333
consumed by the swirling
flames of ambition.

142
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:07,041
On the one side, there was
Lü Buwei, aide to the King

143
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:10,166
and Minister of the Right,
the highest Court post.

144
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,500
On the other side, Jie Shi held
the second-highest post,

145
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,208
Minister of the Left.

146
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,625
With these men as the
hubs of their factions,

147
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,708
the Court had split in two.

148
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:24,625
[NARRATOR] The rivalry
escalated quickly.

149
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,791
Soon, blood washed
away blood,

150
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,916
and the conflict continued
day and night.

151
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:34,916
[NARRATOR] And then...

152
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:38,291
The King's younger
half-brother, Cheng Jiao,

153
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,208
joined together with Jie Shi
to claim the throne as his own,

154
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:45,708
and tensions in the Royal Court
seemed poised to bubble over.

155
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:53,958
[coughing and groaning]

156
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,333
[LI DIAN muffled]
Water! Water!

157
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:57,541
What in the
world is this?

158
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,791
You call this food?
It's not even edible!

159
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,625
It's so nasty!

160

[LI DIAN]
Which of you made this?

161
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:05,708
Xin. I knew it.

162
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:08,166
[YOU]
I thought it was you!

163
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,500
[YOU] You're not good for
anything, not like Piao.

164
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,041
You can't cook, can't clean...

165
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,458

servants like you...

166
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:18,916
..."useless!"

167
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,708
Ah, he glared at me!

168
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,583
Father, Xin's being mean
and glaring at me!

169

He what?!

00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,000
Why you ungrateful brat!

[LI DIAN]
What are you glaring at?

172
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,666
Are you saying you've got
some cause for complaint?

173
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,125
We don't need
the likes of him!

174

He's not like Piao.
He can't do anything!

[LI DIAN] Have you forgotten
who to thank for being alive?

176
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,541
You're war orphans!
You only survived 

177
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:44,708
because as this village's chief,
I provided for the two of you!

178
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,083
And this is what I get for it!

179
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,833
[XIN] Dammit!

180
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:58,958
Dammit! Dammit! Dammit! Dammit!
Dammit! Dammit! Dammit! Dammit!

181
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:02,166
[PIAO] They'll hear you, stupid!
Your voice is going to carry.

Dammit! Dammit!

183
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:07,166
I don't care!
I've reached the end of my rope!

184
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,333
I'm gonna thrash 'em all and
leave this house for good!

185
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,125
It's too soon.

186
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:13,875
Do you really think
we have what it takes

187
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:16,625
to put food on the table
for two of us?

188
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,041
We'd just end up starving.

189
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,375
[XIN]
Then we'll become bandits!

190
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,000
And this house can be
the first place we strike!

[PIAO] Xin!

Huh? What is it?

193
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,833
[PIAO] We haven't been
training this long

194
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:31,666
in order to become
something like that.

195
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,625
Are you that foolish?

196
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,833
I know that. It was
a joke, okay? That's all.

197
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,833
What's your problem?
What, you still want something?

198
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:46,958
[YOU]
Piao, come right away!

00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:50,125
Quickly! Hurry!
This is really big!

200
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:52,791
Huh?

201
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,541
[PIAO, XIN] Huh?

202
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,041
Hey, that's...

203
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,125
...from earlier.

204
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,041
[LI DIAN] Piao, my lad!
Where are you?

205
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,250
"My lad?"

206
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,875
Ah, Piao, my boy!
Come along now, hurry up!

207
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:16,708
Hey, what about me?

208
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,458
What about you?
Go do your chores in the barn!

209
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,291
Huh?

210
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:34,875
Ah, Piao, this gentleman's
name is Lord Changwen.

211
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:37,958
He's a powerful man of very high
station in the Kingdom of Qin,

212
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:41,125
one of the Ministers
who serves in the Royal Court.

213
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,541
[PIAO] A Minister...

214
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,750
...from court!

215
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,166
Piao. As of today,

216
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,583
Lord Changwen will be taking
you under his protection.

217
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,500
What... did he say?!

218
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,791
That's correct.

219
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,500
Beginning tomorrow,
you will be working for me

220
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,083
in the Royal Court.

221
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,458
[PIAO] Me, at court?

222
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:13,833
That's right.

223
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:18,083
[PIAO] I, I don't...
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

224
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:21,291
I cannot speak here about
affairs of the Royal Court,

225
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,333
but I would have you
accept a special post

226
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,750
and take on an important duty.

227
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,833
[PIAO] So wait,
are you saying...

228
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,208
Does this mean I could
be an official at court?

229
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:31,708
[LORD CHANGWEN] Correct.

230
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,541
P-Piao, in the Royal Court?

231
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,583
Oh wow, amazing!

232
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,291
[PIAO] What about Xin?

233
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,333
[PIAO]
Can... can he come with me?

234
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:44,083
He's got just as much
potential as I do!

235
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,541
Denied!

236

and one alone.

What's the matter, Piao?

240
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,500
Why don't you hurry up
and accept, already?

241
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,416
[PIAO]
I beg your pardon.

242
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,833
Please give me one day's time
to consider your offer.

243
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,666
I need to sort through
my feelings on this.

244
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,000
Wha--Wait,
what did you say?!

245

Why didn't you accept
his offer right away?

252
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:41,250
A small-town servant suddenly
becoming a court official?

253
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:42,666
That's beyond our
wildest dreams!

254
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,750
How can you turn that down?!

255

[PIAO] I don't have
the slightest idea

256
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,625
what this is all about.

257
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,833
I should say I've trained all
this time so I could rise,

step by step,
by my own ability...

259
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,291
...and that I haven't been
competing with you this long

260
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,333
just so I could slip
in the easy way.

[XIN] You idiot!

262
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,416
But I'm not gonna
say that, Xin.

00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,333
Huh?

264
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:14,750
That's right. I'm going.

00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,541
Of course you are!

you'll be following me soon!

So hurry up and
catch up with me!

I know we're gonna
end up in the same place.

00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,500
I know it, too!

272

I'm gonna surpass you

Xin! Here's a tip.

277
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,541
Hey, thanks!

278
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,458
Yeah, you did good work.

279
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:15,041
So it's been, what, a month
since Piao went to the Capital?

280
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,583
You know, I think you've
changed since then, Xin.

281
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:19,291
I have?

282
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,125
Yeah, you're like

into a monkey-boy.

[laughs]

286
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:28,000
So you're adjusting okay, then?

287
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,583
I wonder how
Piao is doing.

288
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,166
I can't really see
how a mere servant

289
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,666
could manage palace duties.

290
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,083
That's 'cause you're a fool!

It doesn't matter if it's
in the Royal Court or not.

This is a nightmare!

supposed to hawk my goods?

[MERCHANT A]
I'm having the same problem.

299
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,666
The talk is that
the Court's in no state

00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,708
to be doing any
business at all right now.

The rumor?

About the King and all his

There's a swift horse
on its way to Lü Buwei,

317
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:26,750
who's on expedition
against the Kingdom of Wei.

318
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:28,333
Oh, is that so?

319
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:30,916
I take it that you dispatched
someone to pursue this horse?

320
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,458
[HERALD] Yes.
O-Of course we did, sir.

321
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:35,291
[JIE SHI] That horse might
be carrying a message,

322
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:36,791
and if it reaches
its destination,

323
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:39,625
that scoundrel Lu Buwei will
know what we've been up to.

324
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:41,291
If he joins the King's side,

325
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:42,958
this won't just be
a simple coup.

326
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:45,375
The entire kingdom
will break in half!

327
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:47,166
We've got no more
room for delay.

328
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,125
Order all our forces
to move into action,

329
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:50,583
with every possible haste!

330
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:51,416
[HERALD] Understood!

331
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,458
[CHENG JIAO] Calm down.

332
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:55,083
It's getting way
too heated in here!

333
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,333
This is likely something

334
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,375
he's already accounted
for in his plans.

335
00:22:58,458 --> 00:23:00,333
I wouldn't get so
worked up over it.

336
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:01,583
[JIE SHI]
Yes, my honored lord.

337
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:03,875
Understood.

338
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:05,583
[CHENG JIAO]
Still... I won't lie,

339
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:08,583
the prospect of speeding
things along does interest me.

340
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:10,625
After all,
I do want to see

341
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:13,416
my half-brother's head
presented to me soon.

342
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,500
[JIE SHI] Yes, my lord.
Please, leave it to me.

343
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:21,583
My friends... the time has come!

344
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,166
[ALL FOLLOWERS] Aye!

345
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:36,416
[LI DIAN] This gentleman's
name is Lord Changwen.

346
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,541
He's a powerful man of very high
station in the Kingdom of Qin,

347
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:42,458
one of the Ministers who
serves at the Royal Court.

348
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:43,791
[LORD CHANGWEN] I cannot
speak here about affairs

349
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:45,000
of the Royal Court,

350
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:46,541
But I would have you
accept a special post

351
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,375
and take on an important duty.

352
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:49,833
[MERCHANT A] The rumor?

353
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:51,750
You mean the one about an
uprising happening at Court?

354
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:56,208
About the King and all his
loyal followers getting killed?

355
00:23:56,291 --> 00:24:00,541
[XIN] Piao, you're
still okay, right?

356
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:02,000
[LI DIAN]
Piao! This is Xin.

357
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:05,375
He'll be living with
you from now on.

358
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:07,291
He's a war orphan like you.

359
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:10,375
Teach him how to do
his chores, all right?

360
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:13,541
Hey there!
Your name's Piao, right?

361
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:15,625
Nice to meet you!

362
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:16,875
You, too.

363
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:19,000
Hey, do you wanna have
a sword fight with me?

364
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,750
Huh?

365
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:22,875
Sounds fun! I'm in!

366
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:28,375
[PIAO] Xin, you may think
you're lucky to get taken in,

367
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:30,458
but... well, not really.

368
00:24:30,541 --> 00:24:33,375
In the end, you and I are just
servants in the chief's house.

369
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:35,458
[XIN] What are
you trying to say?

370
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:37,083
[PIAO] A servant's
a servant forever,

371
00:24:37,166 --> 00:24:37,958
even when he grows up.

372
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:39,458
He marries a female servant,

373
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:42,000
and his children end up
as servants, too.

374
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:43,916
I hate the thought of it!

375
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,166
[XIN]
I hate it, too!

376
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,083
But there's nothing we
can do about it, right?

377
00:24:48,166 --> 00:24:50,541
[PIAO] We'll break free with
our sword-fighting skills!

378
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:52,208
[XIN]
Our sword-fighting skills?

379
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:53,375
[PIAO]
We'll go to war!

380
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:55,041
If we can get famous
on the battlefield,

381
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:57,708
we can break away
from being servants.

382
00:24:57,791 --> 00:25:03,791
[XIN]
Piao, you're amazing!

383
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:06,000
We've always
got our swords.

384
00:25:06,083 --> 00:25:08,041
We've got our swords!

385
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:11,541
[XIN] Piao...

386
00:25:11,625 --> 00:25:13,708
What are you doing right now?

387
00:25:13,791 --> 00:25:16,791
I swear I'll catch up to you.

388
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:18,458
Wait for me...

389
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:47,875
I'm home, Xin...

390
00:26:50,291 --> 00:26:54,416
[XIN] Piao!

391
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:13,833
[XIN] Piao!

392
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,666
[XIN] Stay with me, Piao!
Open your eyes!

393
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,500
I said open your eyes!

394
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:24,666
Wha-What's all this
about, Xin?

395
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,916
Is it a thief?

396
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,500
Chief! We need a doctor,
quickly! Please, hurry!

397
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:30,500
P-Piao!

398
00:27:30,583 --> 00:27:32,500
Where's all that
blood coming from?

399
00:27:32,583 --> 00:27:34,875
Forget that! Get a doctor!

400
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:37,208
[PIAO] Xin...

401
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:40,541
It doesn't hurt.

402
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:44,791
There's no need...
for a doctor.

403
00:27:44,875 --> 00:27:47,541
Piao...
how did this happen?

404
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:50,458
What happened in the capital?

405
00:27:50,541 --> 00:27:53,458
[PIAO] The King's brother...
he staged an uprising.

406
00:27:53,541 --> 00:27:55,083
I got caught up in it.

407
00:27:55,166 --> 00:27:56,416
[XIN]
His brother?

408
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,666
The King's younger
half-brother? He's rebelling?

409
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:03,250
What are you saying?

410
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:04,708
The rumor?

411
00:28:04,791 --> 00:28:06,208
You mean the one about an
uprising happening at Court?

412
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:09,708
About the King and all his
loyal followers getting killed?

413
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:13,875
[PIAO] The King...

414
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:17,000
His side only had that
minister, Lord Changwen...

415
00:28:18,583 --> 00:28:20,708
...and just a small
handful of troops.

416
00:28:20,791 --> 00:28:22,625
His brother's forces...

417
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:25,291
They were too many,
and too strong for us.

418
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:26,916
They were unstoppable.

419
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,208
They've taken
over the capital.

420
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:31,083
Try not to talk too much.

421
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:32,916
There are people after me.

422
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,833
If they follow
the trail of blood,

423
00:28:34,916 --> 00:28:36,041
they'll find their way here.

424
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:38,375
Wha... What?

425
00:28:38,458 --> 00:28:39,625
[XIN] People after you?

426
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:42,958
[PIAO] When they get here...
chief... please,

427
00:28:43,041 --> 00:28:45,000
just tell them some
stranger came by

428
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:46,500
and died in the barn.

429
00:28:46,583 --> 00:28:49,708
And... leave my body.
Don't do anything with it.

430
00:28:49,791 --> 00:28:51,125
Oh... Got it...

431
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:54,291
I won't let 'em touch you!

432
00:28:54,375 --> 00:28:57,041
I won't let a single one
of 'em go back alive!

433
00:28:57,125 --> 00:28:58,875
Not a single one!

434
00:29:00,791 --> 00:29:04,541
It's good to hear
that spirit again, Xin.

435
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:07,375
[XIN] Don't try to speak.

436
00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:10,541
[PIAO] Wait, no, there's
something I have to ask of you.

437
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:21,250
[XIN] A map?

438
00:29:21,333 --> 00:29:22,666
[PIAO] Yes.

439
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:26,250
It's of a village west of here
named Heibei Village.

440
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:27,750
[LI DIAN] Heibei Village?!

441
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:29,541
It's a village of outlaws, 

442
00:29:29,625 --> 00:29:31,708
a place where thieves
and murderers

443
00:29:31,791 --> 00:29:33,708
from every kingdom
come together.

444
00:29:33,791 --> 00:29:35,750
They say it's a place
of pure horror,

445
00:29:35,833 --> 00:29:37,458
and that any normal
person who goes there

446
00:29:37,541 --> 00:29:40,041
will never come back alive!

447
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:42,500
Xin!

448
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:45,750
I came to pass this on to you.

449
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:48,791
You have to go there
right away, for me!

450
00:29:48,875 --> 00:29:51,041
Wha-What is this?

451
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:52,500
What are you talking about?

452
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:54,000
I don't understand any of this!

453
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,375
[PIAO] Listen, Xin.

454
00:29:56,458 --> 00:29:58,416
I entrust it to you!

455
00:30:03,416 --> 00:30:05,041
[XIN] I understand.

456
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:07,416
I understand, Piao.

457
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,583
I'll do it.

458
00:30:08,666 --> 00:30:10,750
[soft sobbing]

459
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:13,041
So don't die, Piao!

460
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:14,291
You can't...

461
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:16,375
You have to...

462
00:30:16,458 --> 00:30:18,125
You've gotta...

463
00:30:18,208 --> 00:30:19,541
We've gotta...

464
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:21,458
You and me have gotta
become the greatest generals

465
00:30:21,541 --> 00:30:23,958
in the world!
Isn't that what you said?

466
00:30:28,916 --> 00:30:30,291
[PIAO] We will.

467
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:35,291
Xin...

468
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:39,000
[PIAO] We're the same...
in both ability and spirit.

469
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:42,750
The two of us have
always been one at heart.

470
00:30:42,833 --> 00:30:45,708
[PIAO] If you spread...
your wings and fly...

471
00:30:45,791 --> 00:30:48,041
I promise...

472
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:49,875
I'll be there, too...

473
00:30:49,958 --> 00:30:52,541
Xin...
Take me with you...

474
00:30:52,625 --> 00:30:55,166
And conquer everything
under the heavens.

475
00:30:57,708 --> 00:31:03,166
Piao!

476
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,666
[XIN] Piao...

477
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:36,833
[XIN sobbing]

478
00:31:36,916 --> 00:31:45,875
[XIN screams]

479
00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:55,250
[XIN] Why?!

480
00:31:57,291 --> 00:32:00,333
Why did this happen?

481
00:32:00,416 --> 00:32:02,750
[LI DIAN] Stop! Xin!

482
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:04,916
[screaming]

483
00:32:07,541 --> 00:32:10,708
[XIN] I'll kill them all!
The ones that did this to Piao!

484
00:32:10,791 --> 00:32:13,833
I won't give them
a clean death, either!

485
00:32:13,916 --> 00:32:16,541
I'll rip them apart!
Every last one of them!

486
00:32:16,625 --> 00:32:19,541
I won't stop 'til
Piao's killers are dead!

487
00:32:19,625 --> 00:32:22,125
I'll kill them!
I'll kill them all!

488
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:24,083
All...
I'll kill them all!

489
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:26,791
[XIN] I'll kill them all!
I'll kill them!

490
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:29,375
Kill them all!
Kill them all!

491
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:31,750
Kill them all!
Kill them!

492
00:32:31,833 --> 00:32:33,208
--[XIN] Kill them all!
--[LI DIAN] H-Hey!

493
00:32:33,291 --> 00:32:35,041
[XIN] I'll kill them all...
I'll kill the--

494
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:36,375
[YOU] Xin!

495
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:39,750
Don't you dare let Piao's
death be in vain!

496
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:41,791
Xin! Do you hear me?

497
00:32:41,875 --> 00:32:42,916
What'd you say,
you little piece of--

498
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,250
[YOU]
You know something?

499
00:32:44,333 --> 00:32:48,125
Yeah, I admit,
I've always hated you.

500
00:32:48,208 --> 00:32:50,625
But the truth is,
I always loved Piao!

501
00:32:50,708 --> 00:32:52,500
So you're not the only
one who wants revenge

502
00:32:52,583 --> 00:32:54,375
on Piao's killers, you know!

503
00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:57,166
I wanna find the bastards
who did this and... and...

504
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:01,041
I want to carve them into
little bloody pieces!

505
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:04,000
But... you have to
go and do this, Xin.

506
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:07,708
I don't understand any of this
any better than you do.

507
00:33:07,791 --> 00:33:09,875
But I know this, for sure...

508
00:33:09,958 --> 00:33:12,791
If you don't want Piao's
death to be in vain,

509
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:16,916
then the only thing you can
do is go to this village!

510
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,083
[PIAO] I came to
pass this on to you.

511
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:22,333
You have to go there
right away, for me!

512
00:33:22,416 --> 00:33:25,125
Listen, Xin.

513
00:33:25,208 --> 00:33:27,541
I entrust it to you!

514
00:34:01,916 --> 00:34:04,166
[LI DIAN] You really
intend to go, Xin?

515
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,625
Please, don't do this!

516
00:34:05,708 --> 00:34:08,208
Heibei Village is supposed
to be a village of killers!

517
00:34:08,291 --> 00:34:09,625
It's a horrible place.

518
00:34:09,708 --> 00:34:11,333
They say once you
set foot in it,

519
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:12,958
you'll never come back alive!

520
00:34:13,041 --> 00:34:15,000
And besides, there's all
this about the uprising,

521
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:16,833
and the King's
half-brother, and...

522
00:34:16,916 --> 00:34:19,000
[XIN] None of that
makes a difference.

523
00:34:24,916 --> 00:34:27,000
[XIN] I don't care that
it's a den of killers.

524
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:30,083
I don't care what's
happening in the capital.

525
00:34:31,375 --> 00:34:34,000
[XIN] Piao told me to go...

526
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:37,833
[XIN] And so...

527
00:34:37,916 --> 00:34:40,583
...no matter what,
I'm going!

528
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:11,083
[CHENG JIAO] Jie Shi.

529
00:35:11,166 --> 00:35:12,625
[JIE SHI] My lord?

530
00:35:12,708 --> 00:35:15,333
I am well aware of how desperate
you are to have this kingdom

531
00:35:15,416 --> 00:35:18,666
all in hand, but you see, I have
no interest in such matters.

532
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,875
All I want is my
half-brother's corpse

533
00:35:20,958 --> 00:35:22,541
covered in his own
tainted blood,

534
00:35:22,625 --> 00:35:25,041
as proof that he's dead at last.

535
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:26,125
[JIE SHI] Yes...

536
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:28,458
and you will have
it soon, my lord.

537
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:31,458
How polite of you.

538
00:35:31,541 --> 00:35:33,916
But surely you're secretly
smirking into your sleeve?

539
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,041
After all, you must consider

540
00:35:36,125 --> 00:35:37,916
both me and my
half-brother upstarts,

541
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,750
who owe our stations
entirely to Lü Buwei.

542
00:35:40,833 --> 00:35:42,708
What are you saying,
honored lord?

543
00:35:42,791 --> 00:35:45,083
Your esteemed father,
King Zhuangxiang,

544
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:47,500
ascended to the throne
by his own virtues,

545
00:35:47,583 --> 00:35:48,791
not just due to Lü Buwei

546
00:35:48,875 --> 00:35:51,125
like the groundless
rumors might suggest.

547
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:53,875
Skip the play-acting.
We've come too far for games.

548
00:35:53,958 --> 00:35:57,208
In any event, it's that shameful
connection that I want to sever.

549
00:35:57,291 --> 00:36:00,041
That's why I've
allied myself with you.

550
00:36:01,416 --> 00:36:03,166
[CHENG JIAO]
Dun! Come forward.

551
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:04,000
[DUN] My lord!

552
00:36:04,083 --> 00:36:04,750
[JIE SHI, ATTENDANT]
Huh?

553
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:10,500
[CHENG JIAO] This man is from
a poor artisan's household.

554
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:12,041
He was abandoned by his parents,

555
00:36:12,125 --> 00:36:14,500
but he has some talent with both
a sword and a writing brush,

556
00:36:14,583 --> 00:36:16,958
and thanks to that, he's
managed to advance to a post

557
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:18,791
working for me here in Xianyang.

558
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:20,708
He now has his
own residence.

559
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:23,375
He even sends an allowance to
the parents who abandoned him.

560
00:36:23,458 --> 00:36:25,125
[JIE SHI, ATTENDANT]
Ah...

561
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:27,583
[CHENG JIAO]
He's no equal to Lü Buwei,

562
00:36:27,666 --> 00:36:29,958
but he's scraped his way
up from the bottom.

563
00:36:30,041 --> 00:36:31,000
[snaps fingers]

564
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:47,416
[CHENG JIAO] I can't stand
people like that.

565
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,000
They make me nauseous.

566
00:36:51,541 --> 00:36:53,125
No matter how
precious the clothes

567
00:36:53,208 --> 00:36:56,125
they drape themselves in, they
can't change what's underneath!

568
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:59,208
And it's the same
with my half-brother!

569
00:36:59,291 --> 00:37:01,000
His mother is a vulgar woman,

570
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:04,541
with no connections or ties
whatsoever to the royal house!

571
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:06,291
To think the spawn
of such a wretch

572
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:08,208
could come ahead of me
to take the throne...

573
00:37:08,291 --> 00:37:10,583
It will not be tolerated!

574
00:37:10,666 --> 00:37:12,416
I have a mother of
the royal blood.

575
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,416
I am the one worthy to be King!

576
00:37:16,541 --> 00:37:17,625
[CHENG JIAO]
When my half-brother

577
00:37:17,708 --> 00:37:19,041
took the throne from me,

578
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:21,500
I came to understand
the Royal Court's

579
00:37:21,583 --> 00:37:25,333
true feelings toward
him... and me.

580
00:37:25,416 --> 00:37:28,208
In the end, they were all
only interested in kneeling

581
00:37:28,291 --> 00:37:29,458
to the position of kingship.

582
00:37:29,541 --> 00:37:32,541
Every last one of them,
bowing and scraping.

583
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:36,125
That's all that matters
to people of their "caliber."

584
00:37:36,208 --> 00:37:39,833
That is why I don't
count on people anymore.

585
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:47,333
[CHENG JIAO]
There are a few things

586
00:37:47,416 --> 00:37:49,375
that can be counted
on in this world:

587
00:37:49,458 --> 00:37:52,791
Greed, lust for power,
ugly human desires.

588
00:37:52,875 --> 00:37:56,416
I take advantage of them and
move things along as I like.

589
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,750
Arranging to send Lü Buwei
away on an expedition

590
00:37:58,833 --> 00:38:00,333
is just one example.

591
00:38:00,416 --> 00:38:03,416
[JIE SHI] It's dangerous to
underestimate Lü Buwei, though.

592
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,833
With him as your enemy,
you may need to raise

593
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:08,083
tens of thousands
of men for your army.

594
00:38:08,166 --> 00:38:11,250
I suppose you're trying to say
that I need the royal seal.

595
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:13,000
That thing is no
more than a token,

596
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:15,958
but do whatever you must
to simplify matters.

597
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:18,125
[JIE SHI]
Yes, honored lord.

598
00:38:22,666 --> 00:38:25,916
[CHENG JIAO] Soon, we can
reverse the sands of time

599
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,375
back to the way things should
have been five years ago.

600
00:38:40,541 --> 00:38:41,500
[WANG YI] So...

601
00:38:41,583 --> 00:38:44,625
What has become
of Lord Changwen?

602
00:38:44,708 --> 00:38:47,291
It's exactly as you
expected, my lord.

603
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:50,250
[WANG YI chuckles]

604
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:58,958
[WANG YI] It looks like things
are about to get interesting.

605
00:39:01,875 --> 00:39:03,875
[YOU] Hey, can't we do
something for him?

606
00:39:03,958 --> 00:39:06,208
We can't just leave
him here like this!

607
00:39:06,291 --> 00:39:08,791
Poor Piao!
Don't you care about him?

608
00:39:08,875 --> 00:39:10,458
Uh, yeah...

609
00:39:10,541 --> 00:39:13,291
But remember,
Piao said there would be

610
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:16,541
people coming after him,
and to do nothing with his body.

611
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:18,750
But what on earth...?

612
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:40,750
[XU WAN] Ying Zheng...
You people...

613
00:39:40,833 --> 00:39:42,208
Did you speak with him?

614
00:39:42,291 --> 00:39:43,500
No, no, no!
There was a noise, 

615
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:45,208
so we came out and
we found this guy here,

616
00:39:45,291 --> 00:39:47,375
and, well, he was already dead!

617
00:39:48,791 --> 00:39:50,625
[XU WAN] Is that so?

618
00:39:50,708 --> 00:39:53,000
Well, that saved your life.

619
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:07,458
[YOU] Stop!

620
00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:08,500
[XU WAN] Hmm?

621
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:16,333
[XU WAN] Well, now...

622
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:18,000
What happened
to this man's sword?

623
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:20,458
[LI DIAN] We don't know!
We don't know anything!

624
00:40:20,541 --> 00:40:22,416
[XU WAN] It's obvious
you're hiding something.

625
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,125
[LI DIAN] N-No!
We're really not!

626
00:40:24,208 --> 00:40:25,500
Not a thing!

627
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:27,750
[YOU] Father!

628
00:40:31,541 --> 00:40:32,708

[sword slicing]

630
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,666
[YOU screaming]

631
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:42,791
[LI DIAN, WIFE] You!

632
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:45,625
Speak quickly.

633
00:40:45,708 --> 00:40:49,166
Or next, I'll stab him
in the heart.

634
00:41:38,458 --> 00:41:40,541
Hey, look, someone
came to visit.

635
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:43,000
Showing up at a place like
this at such a late hour?

636
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:46,583
This punk must have no brains.

637
00:41:46,666 --> 00:41:48,333
[VILLAGER 1C] The sword at
his hip's a wooden one,

638
00:41:48,416 --> 00:41:51,875
but the one on his back looks
awful nice, don't ya think?

639
00:41:53,083 --> 00:41:55,250
[VILLAGER 1B] That was
some good scouting, Diao.

640
00:41:55,333 --> 00:41:56,291
Here!

641
00:41:59,041 --> 00:42:00,000
[XIN] Hey.

642
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:03,833
So I take it I've arrived
at Heibei Village?

643
00:42:03,916 --> 00:42:05,125
[VILLAGERS laugh]

644
00:42:05,208 --> 00:42:07,625
If you're just realizing
that now, it's too late!

645
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:09,541
If you hand over that sword
on your back quietly,

646
00:42:09,625 --> 00:42:10,750
then we'll leave you unharmed

647
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:12,500
for when we sell
you off to the slavers.

648
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:15,958
But if you resist, your corpse
will take a swim in the river.

649
00:42:16,041 --> 00:42:16,916
Which do you--

650
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,583
[pounding noise]

651
00:42:17,666 --> 00:42:24,708
[VILLAGER groaning]

652
00:42:24,791 --> 00:42:31,708
[VILLAGER yelling]

653
00:42:31,791 --> 00:42:34,458
[XIN] Sorry about that.
I'm in a hurry.

654
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:45,583
[VILLAGERS groaning]

655
00:42:45,666 --> 00:42:48,333
[VILLAGER 1B]
That little piece of crap...

656
00:42:48,416 --> 00:42:50,833
Diao! Call everyone
in the village together

657
00:42:50,916 --> 00:42:52,458
and have them
go after that punk!

658
00:42:52,541 --> 00:42:54,750
Don't let that little
snot-nosed wannabe brat

659
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:56,375
leave here alive!

660
00:43:06,708 --> 00:43:07,708
[VILLAGER 1G] They got beat up.

661
00:43:07,791 --> 00:43:09,166
So it wasn't just
one kid after all?

662
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:10,041
What the heck?

663
00:43:10,125 --> 00:43:12,291
[VILLAGER 1G] Here he comes!

664
00:43:12,375 --> 00:43:14,416
[VILLAGER 1G] That's him!

665
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:21,166
[VILLAGERS yelling]

666
00:43:30,666 --> 00:43:32,416
Wha--What's up with this kid?

667
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:33,833
[VILLAGER 1G]
Go call everyone together!

668
00:43:33,916 --> 00:43:34,625
Surround him!

669
00:43:34,708 --> 00:43:36,458
Don't let him get away!

670
00:43:39,666 --> 00:43:41,875
[VILLAGER 1G] He's crazy fast!

671
00:43:41,958 --> 00:43:43,125
Hey, grab him!

672
00:43:43,208 --> 00:43:45,250
Maybe if we get
a hold of him...

673
00:43:53,833 --> 00:43:55,208
That's some crazy brute force!

674
00:43:55,291 --> 00:43:57,166
What is he,
some kinda monster?

675
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:58,541
[XIN] That's right.

676
00:43:59,416 --> 00:44:00,791
[XIN]
Compared to the swordsmanship

677
00:44:00,875 --> 00:44:02,833
of half-assed
scum like you,

678
00:44:02,916 --> 00:44:04,208
mine is different!

679
00:44:18,416 --> 00:44:19,291
[PIAO] Xin!

680
00:44:19,375 --> 00:44:20,708
Uh huh?

681
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:23,875
Someday, the two of us
are gonna be famous generals!

682
00:44:23,958 --> 00:44:26,208
[XIN] Huh? What,
do you have a fever?

683
00:44:26,291 --> 00:44:28,833
There's no way that's
ever gonna happen!

684
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:31,916
We can do it!
If we win like crazy...

685
00:44:33,166 --> 00:44:35,541
...rack up some achievements,
get recognized,

686
00:44:35,625 --> 00:44:39,041
and climb to the top,
we can become generals!

687
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:42,541
Generals?

688
00:44:42,625 --> 00:44:44,083
That's right!

689
00:44:44,166 --> 00:44:47,416
We'll dress in golden armor,
and ride all across the Earth!

690
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,583
And in the end, we'll become

691
00:44:48,666 --> 00:44:51,208
the greatest generals
in all the world!

692
00:44:51,291 --> 00:44:53,833
Yeah... the greatest generals!

693
00:44:53,916 --> 00:44:54,916
And then...

694
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,291
our names will
go down in history!

695
00:45:04,833 --> 00:45:06,083
[PIAO] Exactly, Xin.

696
00:45:06,166 --> 00:45:07,791
Right now,
we may be just servants,

697
00:45:07,875 --> 00:45:10,916
but we'll carve our two
names into future history!

698
00:45:12,541 --> 00:45:13,833
[XIN]
So exactly how long

699
00:45:13,916 --> 00:45:15,833
will our winning
streak have to be?

700
00:45:15,916 --> 00:45:17,708
[PIAO] It's simple.

701
00:45:17,791 --> 00:45:19,583
We'll just have
to be invincible.

702
00:45:19,666 --> 00:45:22,375
We won't lose... to anybody!

703
00:45:24,916 --> 00:45:26,041
[XIN] That's right.

704
00:45:27,666 --> 00:45:28,958
[XIN] My sword...

705
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,208
[XIN] No, our sword...

706
00:45:32,291 --> 00:45:34,750
[XIN] will resound
over all the world!

707
00:45:34,833 --> 00:45:38,333
Nobody... Nobody will defeat us!

708
00:46:12,208 --> 00:46:14,208
You want to keep at it?

709
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:19,125
Bunch of fools.

710
00:46:44,625 --> 00:46:46,291
[XIN]
I've arrived...

711
00:46:48,083 --> 00:46:51,708
[XIN] ...at the place...
where the rivers merge.

712
00:46:59,083 --> 00:47:01,833
[XIN] That means...

713
00:47:01,916 --> 00:47:03,875
...this is the place?

714
00:47:05,708 --> 00:47:08,416
[XIN]
But... it's an ordinary hut!

715
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:11,708
Piao, it's just an ordinary hut!

716
00:47:11,791 --> 00:47:13,500
What's the story here?

717
00:47:14,833 --> 00:47:17,583
[XIN] I come all this way,
without avenging your death,

718
00:47:17,666 --> 00:47:19,833
without even knowing why...

719
00:47:19,916 --> 00:47:22,000
...and this is what I find?

720
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:28,041
[XIN] Tell me, Piao... Why?

721
00:47:28,125 --> 00:47:30,666
Why did you die?

722
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:33,291
Why did you use your dying
breath to guide me here,

723
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:35,375
to this decrepit old shack?

724
00:47:36,916 --> 00:47:40,708
What... what in the world
could be here?

725
00:48:00,916 --> 00:48:02,666
It can't be!

726
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:05,333
It's not possible!

727
00:48:19,541 --> 00:48:20,791
Piao?!

728
00:49:52,875 --> 00:49:55,541
[XIN] You're the one!
You killed Piao!!

729
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:58,666
He's never...
he's never coming back!

730
