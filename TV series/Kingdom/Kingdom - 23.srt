1
00:00:09,416 --> 00:00:10,458
[XIN] Qiang Lei!

2
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:11,875
[DIAO] Who's that?

3
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:14,375
Someone I fought with
in my five-man squad.

4
00:00:14,458 --> 00:00:15,833
What?!

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,583
[DIAO] But that person is...

6
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:21,083
[XIN] A heck of
a fighter as well,

7
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:23,291
with some really
out-there moves!

8
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:27,750
One swing and ten huge
guys went down at once!

9
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,000
Are you serious?

10
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:31,250
So what are you doing
over here, Qiang Lei?

11
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:32,583
[QIANG LEI] Taking a walk.

12
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,291
You liar!

13
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:36,625
[QIANG LEI] I happened
to be in the neighborhood,

14
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:40,333
so I came to tell you one thing.

15
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:44,000
If you don't change,
sooner or later, you will die.

16
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,291
[XIN gasps]

17
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:46,250
[QIANG LEI] See you.

18
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:47,750
[XIN] So that's it?!

19
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:48,458
[QIANG LEI] Yes.

20
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:49,833
[XIN] Hey, hold on!

21
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:53,166
I've got a ton of things
I wanna ask you!

22
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,250
[QIANG LEI] Well?

23
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:58,666
[XIN] U-Uh...
about before... um...

24
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,791
When you were
riding behind me...

25
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:04,625
[DIAO] Hmm?

26
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:07,250
[XIN] So-So anyway...

27
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,500
...you're a girl, right?

28
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:11,500
[QIANG LEI] Yes. So what?

29
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:13,166
[BOTH gasp]

30
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,750
[XIN] W-What's
a girl doing fighting

31
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:17,125
with a bunch of guys?!

32
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:18,833
[QIANG LEI]
It's none of your business.

33
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:21,166
[DIAO] W-Wait!

34
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,583
I bet you must be hungry, right?

35
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:26,833
I'll cook us some
dinner before you go!

36
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:27,750
[QIANG LEI] I don't need--

37
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:30,958
[QIANG LEI's stomach growls]

38
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:35,375
[NARRATOR] Ancient China...

39
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:39,166
The time of the sages was over,
swept away by base human greed.

40
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,791
Over five long and
harrowing centuries,

41
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:44,375
an endless storm of
war, hatred, and strife

42
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:46,375
raged across the land.

43
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:47,958
Over a hundred nations fell,

44
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,125
winnowed away until
only seven remained

45
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:52,666
Now, from Qin, the
westernmost kingdom,

46
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,875
a great wind of history
is about to blow.

47
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:57,250
This is the tale of a
nameless boy and a young king

48
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,541
who ran the gauntlet
in this age of strife.

49
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:00,875
[yelling]

50
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,375
[DIAO]
Okay, dig right in, everyone.

51
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,333
All right, let's eat!

52
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,208
[BOTH gasp]

53
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,333
[XIN stammers]

54
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,500
[QIANG LEI gasps]

55
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,000
So good!

56
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,916
[DIAO] She could
fit in with the men...?

57
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,625
Anyway, how did you
not figure out

58
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,291
someone this cute was a girl?

59
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:09,125
Sh-She was hiding her
face the whole time!

60
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,666
How could I know?!

61
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:15,750
[DIAO sighs]

62
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,791
[DIAO]
C-Can I ask you something?

63
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,375
What is it?

64
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:25,833
[DIAO] What did
you mean by "so what"?

65
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:28,208
A young girl who
is living as a boy

66
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,750
is no trifling thing,
I will have you know!

67
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:33,583
[XIN] Why are you so interested
in her all of the sudden?

68
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,500
Be quiet!

69
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:39,250
It could be a bother if
people knew I was a woman,

70
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,083
so I don't tell them.

71
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,708
You are really confident
about your skills

72
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:46,000
to do what you do, Qiang Lei.

73
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:49,375
[QIANG LEI] There is no one in
this world stronger than I am.

74
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:53,083
Hey, hold on!
That's going too far!

75
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,375
Do you want to try me?

76
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:58,791
[XIN laughs]

77
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:01,375
Anyway, I gotta say
I'm relieved.

78
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,250
I thought you were a cold fish

79
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,791
who didn't care
about other people,

80
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,833
but it turns out I was wrong.

81
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:10,541
Excuse me? You thought that?

82
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,291
You went out of your
way to visit,

83
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,458
even though I don't
really get it at all.

84
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:15,666
[XIN laughs]

85
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,916
[QIANG LEI] That's because--

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,416
I have been wanting to
fight together again,

87
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,666
I'll have you know.

88
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,375
We're comrades after all!

89
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:23,333
[QIANG LEI gasps]

90
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:24,500
Stop it!

91
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:25,541
[DIAO &amp; XIN gasp]

92
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,250
That is not why
I joined the battle.

93
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,041
There just happened to be...

94
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:32,625
a battle while I was
working toward my goal.

95
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,833
That's all it was.

96
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,541
A goal, you say?

97
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:39,083
I'm not interested in
"togetherness"

98
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,583
or "comrades" at all.

99
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,125
[XIN] What is your goal then?

100
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:47,791
How did a girl like you
get so incredibly strong?

101
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,958
I-I want to know, too!
Please do tell us!

102
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,166
Uh... Diao?

103
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,541
I want to be
very strong as well!

104
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,416
You and I have the same--

105
00:05:57,208 --> 00:06:00,500
[crashing, DIAO grunts]

106
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,750
[XIN] Hey, what are
you doing?! Put Diao down!

107
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,208
[QIANG LEI] Lay off!

108
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:09,583
We were just born into
absolutely different worlds.

109
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,000
Words like "I want
to know," "Tell me..."

110
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,583
Makes me sick when
people take me lightly!

111
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:20,541
[QIANG LEI] I'm alive for
one reason only, you see.

112
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:25,666
Being born Chi You
decided my life and my fate.

113
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,458
Born Chi You?

114
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:28,958
[QIANG LEI] A group of assassins

115
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,625
that has lived for
centuries in shadows.

116
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,166
[BOTH gasp]

117
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,250
[QIANG LEI] At least, that's
how people describe our tribe.

118
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,833
[laughter]

119
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:46,666
[CRONE] You shall all be
delicious food for our young.

120
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,208
[BANDIT 23A] What is this old
crone going on about?

121
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,291
[BANDIT 23B] You wandered into
the wrong neck of the woods.

122
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:54,333
[BANDIT 23C] None of you are
getting outta here alive!

123
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:57,708
I take it you do
know of the Chi You?

124
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,291
[BANDIT 23A] "Chi You"?

125
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:02,625
The sword was not
originally meant for slaying--

126
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,625
It was made in the ancient world

127
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:07,583
as a sacred object
for holy rites.

128
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:11,416
The Chi You are priestesses
who dance with swords

129
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,708
housing much divine power.

130
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:16,833
[BANDIT 23B] So what the heck
does that even mean, exactly?

131
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:21,125
[CRONE] As they dance, they slay
with the power of the gods.

132
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:24,666
Mere human power can
never ever compare to it.

133
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,583
[BANDIT 23C] Oh, is that so?

134
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:29,375
[BANDIT 23A] Okay, Granny,
whatever you say.

135
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:33,000
[CRONE] Dance, daughters
of the Qiang clan.

136
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,500
Xiang! Lei!

137
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,708
[BANDITS gasp]

138
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:38,583
[BANDIT 23A] What is that?

139
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:39,833
[BANDITS laugh]

140
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:42,333
You're offering a dance
to spare your life?

141
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:46,791
[grunting, gasping]

142
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,083
[QIANG LEI] The Chi You tribe
divided into specific

143
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:50,541
and individual clans,

144
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:53,541
which scattered themselves
all across the mountains,

145
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:56,625
and the gifted ones were
forced to train hard early on

146
00:07:56,708 --> 00:08:01,083
so towns could make many capable
of carrying the Chi You name.

147
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:03,208
The clans staked everything.

148
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,250
[QIANG LEI] That was our law.

149
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,708
[QIANG LEI]
When I turned thirteen,

150
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:14,083
a Chi You had to be picked.

151
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:15,500
Two candidates were selected
from each of the nineteen clans.

152
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:19,041
My clan picked Xiang and
me--We were raised as sisters.

153
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,916
All the candidates must fight
for the title of Chi You

154
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,833
until one was left.

155
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:28,333
Until just one of the
candidates was left...

156
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:32,083
That is the tribal law
that is known as the Ritual.

157
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:34,750
That is the Chi You.

158
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:39,166
Our fates are simply sealed
as we are born into this.

159
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,083
[QIANG XIANG] That's
Lian of the YMu clan.

160
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:45,208
And this one's Jing of Yi.

161
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,416
They're both extremely strong.

162
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,000
You don't need to worry.

163
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,958
You will definitely
survive tomorrow, Xiang.

164
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,041
[QIANG XIANG] You do realize

165
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,708
that would mean
you die tomorrow?

166
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:59,208
Remember, it might possibly be
even me who kills you!

167
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:01,416
That does not bother me at all.

168
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,000
We have been told since babies
that we'd live until the Ritual.

169
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:09,125
Well, I don't like the idea.

170
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:12,625
I do not want to die
at just fifteen...

171
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:15,833
There are so many things
I still want to do.

172
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,583
I want to see those "nations"
down in the flatlands,

173
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:21,583
and I wanna see
the people who live there!

174
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:26,041
And I want to have children
someday, and before that...

175
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,875
I want to know the warmth
of a man's touch.

176
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,250
[QIANG XIANG gasps]

177

[QIANG LEI stammers]

178
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,750
[QIANG XIANG laughs]

179
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,541
[QIANG XIANG]
I guess you're still too young

180
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:38,041
to talk about that.

181
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:42,666
The truth is, I don't want you
to die tomorrow either, Lei.

182
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,916
I want you to survive
and carry the Chi You name,

183
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,916
and learn lots
about the outside world!

184
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,458
[QIANG LEI] It can't happen.

185
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:53,791
We are not allowed to join
forces despite our same clan.

186
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:56,416
Only one will survive.

187
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,166
That is what the law states.

188
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,916
That's the reason
we both have to fight hard

189
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,416
for our own sakes tomorrow!

190
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,875
Even if we end up
fighting against each other!

191
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:11,083
Don't you dare
go easy on me, Lei.

192
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,541
Understand?

193
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:15,708
Understood.

194
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,541
[QIANG XIANG] Lu Sui... you
protect Lei well tomorrow.

195
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:23,916
Hear me?

196
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,625
[QIANG LEI] Sister...

197
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,125
My Lei...

198
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:32,166
I've always thought of you
as my real sister and family.

199
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,333
[QIANG LEI]
I feel the same way, Xiang.

200
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,541
[QIANG LEI] There are thirty-six
other candidates besides us.

201
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:48,333
[QIANG LEI] I'll go all-out
the second the Ritual starts.

202
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:53,041
If I kill ten of the
strongest-looking tough ones,

203
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,166
that will surely be enough.

204
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,791
[QIANG LEI]
Xiang will do the rest

205
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,541
and then she'll
become the Chi You.

206
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,208
[QIANG LEI] It's okay, Lu Sui.

207
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,833
I decided on this.

208
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,166
Let's go to sleep.

209
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,958
We'll have an early day.

210
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,208
[QIANG LEI gasps]

211
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,208
[QIANG LEI gasps]

212
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:28,833
[QIANG LEI] It's... evening...?!

213
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,125
[QIANG LEI] I overslept?!

214
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:36,000
No, I couldn't have!

215
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,041
Something happened...

216
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,333
Incense?

217
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,125
I was drugged!

218
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,583
By who?

219
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,541
[QIANG LEI gasps]

220
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,000
[QIANG LEI] Sister...?

221
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:53,250
[QIANG LEI] The Ritual--What
happened there?!

222
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,708
And Xiang...

223
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,791
[QIANG LEI] What about Xiang?!

224
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,416
[QIANG LEI] Xiang...

225
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,458
[QIANG LEI] Xiang...

226
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,083
[QIANG LEI] Xiang...

227
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,083
[QIANG LEI] Xiang!

228
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,333
[QIANG LEI] Xiang!

229
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,125
[QIANG LEI] She's not here...
Xiang's not here!

230
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:36,333
She's not here,
she won the--

231
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:37,791
[QIANG LEI gasps]

[DIAO whimpers]

235
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:05,083
[QIANG LEI] Don't misunderstand:
Xiang wasn't weak at all.

236
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:08,375
She far surpassed
the rest of those girls.

237
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,125
[DIAO] Then why did she...?

238
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,833
[QIANG LEI growls]

239
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,208
[QIANG LEI sobs]

240
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:21,833
[QIANG LEI] Why, Elder?

241
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:25,000
Why did this happen to Xiang?

242
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:29,416
There was not a single person
here she would have lost to!

243
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:35,291
Xiang was carefully targeted
from the very beginning.

244
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:37,000
Targeted, you say?!

245
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,458
[CRONE]
The second the Ritual started,

246
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:42,958
a whole group attacked her
simultaneously.

247
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:46,958
[ELDER 23A] In accordance with
our laws we'll start the Ritual.

248
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,166
Begin!

249
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,916
[yelling]

250
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,125
[grunting, shouting]

251
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,666
[YLULIAN] Hmph. Little wench...

252
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,500
[CRONE] All while
Lian of YMu simply looked on.

253
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,000
[QIANG LEI] That can't be!

254
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:03,000
It's forbidden to join forces
with anyone in the Ritual,

255
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,375
even a member of your own clan!

256
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:08,708
That is our law!
Isn't it?!

257
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,291
Lei!

258
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:13,291
It was clear to all that your
and Xiang's power was greater.

259
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:16,583
The Elders of all the
clans acknowledged it, too.

260
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,458
That's why they
turned a blind eye.

261
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:24,583
To the others joining forces
and... to your absence, too.

262
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,458
[QIANG LEI] A blind eye...?

263
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:30,000
Elder, wait,
what about the law?

264
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,708
Isn't the law
absolute after all?!

265
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:35,375
Is it really such a
trifling thing?!

266
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,375
[CRONE growls]

267
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,083
[QIANG LEI] Elder!

268
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,416
Then why...

269
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,541
Then why did they
do this to her?

270
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:44,958
Why did Xiang have to die
if it isn't absolute?!

271
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,625
[ELDER 23A] What are
you doing, Elder of Qiang?

272
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:50,416
That one is but
walking dead, I believe.

273
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,666
[QIANG LEI gasps]

274
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,166
[ELDER 23A] Just slay
yourself, Qiang girl.

275
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,625
The Ritual's victor
has been decided!

276
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:59,250
Each and every loser
must die promptly.

277
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,333
That is the firm law
of Chi You,

278
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:04,708
which has stood unbroken
for a thousand years!

279
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,625
[ELDER 23A grunts]

280
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:07,875
[ELDERS gasp]

281
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,333
[QIANG LEI] You hags
think I'm stupid?

282
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:15,666
Thousand-year law?
Don't make me laugh.

283
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,708
[BOTH sigh]

284
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,666
I thought about killing
all the old crones

285
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,541
and then dying myself
afterwards,

286
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:25,250
but I didn't.
I changed my mind.

287
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:28,875
There's one more thing
I have to do before I die.

288
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,458
You're talking about
that YMu Lian?

289
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:35,208
I am... talking about her...

290
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,500
[QIANG XIANG grunts]

291
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,541
[YLULIAN laughs]

292
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,416
[YLULIAN] Sleep tight.

293
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,500
[QIANG LEI growls]

294
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,333
[QIANG LEI] The one who
plotted to have them

295
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:57,166
gang up on us...
and who killed Xiang

296
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:01,416
ended up the new
Chi You and left our lands.

297
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,458
I'll make her pay if
it's the last thing I do.

298
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:08,750
I lost Xiang and I abandoned
the Chi You homeland.

299
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,833
The only reason I'm alive now

300
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:13,916
is to kill that woman
and that's it.

301
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,500
[XIN growls]

302
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,083
[DIAO] It must eat at you.

303
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,166
[XIN] Hm?

304
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,333
[DIAO] That you were
at the mercy

305
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,458
of some stupid baseless law...

306
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:25,166
that you lost Xiang to
people fighting really dirty...

307
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,666
And also the girl
who killed her is

308
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,958
living the wonderful life
as Chi You, but...

309
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,666
The worst part...

310
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:37,416
...is that when the one
you loved was killed,

311
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,125
you couldn't be there
to help her.

312
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,791
What makes you think that, Diao?

313
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:48,333
Because that's what...
scares me most of all.

314
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:49,791
Diao...

315
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,375
[XIN] Wow, it's
already nighttime!

316
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,916
Stay with us tonight,
Qiang Lei.

317
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,708
[QIANG LEI] All right.

318
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,250
[DIAO grunts]

319
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,791
[XIN] What's up?

320
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,458
[DIAO] I cannot sleep at all.

321
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:11,458
I'm gonna go get some fresh air.

322
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,458
[DIAO] Back in Heibei Village,

323
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:22,541
all I ever thought about
was how I could escape.

324
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:27,416
[DIAO] But when I met Xin
and Zheng and the guys,

325
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,625
and then got in the fight
to take back the capital...

326
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:35,416
I don't know why,
but I felt so excited inside.

327
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,958
Even though every day was
really a brush with death...

328
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:43,666
[DIAO] But now, calming down
and thinking about things,

329
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,250
I kind of get it all.

330
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:51,916
Xin... I think because
I was with you.

331
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,916
We started living together, and
even though nothing happened,

332
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,708
happy days started to come.

333
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:02,750
It was the first time life
had ever been fun for me.

334
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:06,666
And I thought it'd stay
that way forever...

335
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,916
But I was very wrong.

336
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:14,666
[DIAO] You keep moving forward.

337
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,208
Not just you.

338
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:20,416
Zheng, and Bi,
and Lord Changwen, too.

339
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,916
You're all risking your
lives to move forward.

340
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,958
All of a sudden, I'm the only
one sitting somewhere else,

341
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,041
facing a different direction.

342
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:33,916
At this rate,
it's just like before!

343
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,166
So what am I to do, then?!

344
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:40,666
[XIN growls quietly]

345
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,250
[XIN growls quietly]

346
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,125
[XIN grolws]

347
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,125
[QIANG LEI]
You're keeping me awake!

348
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:52,208
Quit staring;
it's very oppressive.

349
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:54,666
Hehe, sorry, sorry!

350
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,041
But you know what,

351
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:59,041
now that I look at you,
you're actually really cute!

352
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,916
You are an idiot.

353
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,583
Someone who was just
like a brother to me

354
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:06,708
got killed as well.

355
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,916
He was Piao.

356
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,666
To me, he was just like a--

357
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,500
You do not have to tell me.

358
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,000
I was sort of listening while

359
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,291
you were telling
Wei Ping and Wei Dao.

360
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,833
Okay, fine, never mind then!

361
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:24,625
I felt like it was not right to
let you spill your guts alone.

362
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,166
[QIANG LEI] Xin.

363
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,583
[XIN] Hn?!

364
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,791
You are...
really a strange one.

365
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,958
[XIN] Huh?! Where did
that come from?!

366
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,791
[QIANG LEI] I'm strange as well.

367
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,166
You were simply lucky in
that war, and that is all.

368
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,458
[XIN growls]

369
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,958
Xin, even in that last fight
you had with Wei,

370
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:47,875
there were plenty of men who
were much stronger than you.

371
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,125
[XIN] I know that already.

372
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:54,583
The experiences I had in
that battle made me realize

373
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:57,125
that if I just go racing ahead
on nothing but momentum

374
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:58,333
and high spirits alone,

375
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,458
I cannot win a real fight.

376
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:04,291
I realize my shortcomings.

377
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,083
I've thought it
through thoroughly.

378
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,916
Sounds like you've
made up your mind.

379
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,666
[XIN] So what are you
going to do now?

380
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:16,041
[QIANG LEI]
I'll head for Wei on my own.

381
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:22,166
[QIANG LEI]
That's all I... have left...

382
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:26,166
Well, when you're done, you
get your butt back here, okay?

383
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,500
[QIANG LEI gasps]

384
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,875
You say you've got nothing
but revenge or whatever,

385
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,875
but that's a gigantic lie.

386
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,291
Someone like that
wouldn't risk herself

387
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:38,083
to help other people out
in a battle that wild.

388
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:40,333
Listen up, Qiang Lei!

389
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,958
You're a comrade who
fought hard and bravely

390
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,833
in my five-man squad,
which means

391
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:48,750
you've been one of my
hundred-man unit from the start!

392
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:52,375
So you get back here before
the next war. No excuses!

393
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,708
That's an order, you hear me?!

394
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,375
[QIANG LEI] Don't sign me up.

395
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,750
Shut up! Answer me!

396
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:00,125
[QIANG LEI] I'll think about it.

397
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:01,916
[XIN growls]

398
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,375
[XIN] Whatever.

399
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:07,458
I'll always save
a space for ya.

400
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,791
Qiang Lei, you must
have learned a lot

401
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:15,291
from that battle you
were in with us.

402
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:24,208
[QIANG LEI] I suppose.

403
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:27,125
[XIN] Well, then you
better come back here!

404
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,791
[QIANG LEI] Knock it off!

405
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:38,125
Oh, I see you are awake?

406
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,166
[XIN] Is she... gone now?

407
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,791
[DIAO] Yeah. Come on,
it's breakfast time!

408
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:46,625
Xin, please listen to me.

409
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,750
[XIN] Hm? Say what?

410
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:51,208
Do you remember
about my ambition?

411
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:54,875
It is to become super-rich
and spend my life partying hard.

412
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:58,166
Oh yeah, I do remember you
telling me about that one time!

413
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,250
I have no intention of
living in this shabby hut

414
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:02,625
just making ends meet.

415
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,791
Yeah, I'm on it!
I'm gonna climb up the ladder

416
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,458
and get us one huge estate!

417
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:09,041
Originally, I figured
I'd rely on you,

418
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:10,416
but I've changed my mind.

419
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,916
I mean, you could
really die at any time.

420
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,541
[XIN] E-Excuse me?

421
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,000
That's why I have
decided to go to battle

422
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,166
and earn my fortune now!

423
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,250
Huh?!

424
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:23,000
You want to go to
battle and fight?!

425
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,916
I know that I
don't have the muscles

426
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,416
for much of anything, really.

427
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,458
But then, even if
I don't know what it is,

428
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:33,666
I know there is going to be
something that I can do, Xin!

429
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,833
So...

430
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:39,291
When the fighting starts again,
are you going to go to war?

431
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:40,458
You bet.

432
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:42,916
I will leave here
promptly then as well.

433
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,458
To find the place
where I belong.

434
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:47,333
Oh, I see...

435
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:49,416
[DIAO] We might not see
each other for a while,

436
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,583
but I promise to come back.

437
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:55,041
I will come back to you.

438
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,708
I'll be waiting for you.

439
00:22:56,791 --> 00:22:58,916
[DIAO giggles]

440
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,708
[XIN] Okay! Let's work
like crazy today!

441
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:03,833
[DIAO] Yeah!
You help clean up then!

442
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:05,041
[XIN] You do that.

443
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:06,250
[DIAO] Say what?!

444
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:08,250
Pitch in once in a while,
why don't you?!

445
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:11,166
[XIN] I told you, I'm terrible
at cooking and cleaning!

446
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,416
So that's why
I just stick to eating!

447
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,958
[DIAO] Don't just
decide that on your own!

448
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:56,791
[XIN] I want the world's
greatest generals to train me!

449
00:24:56,875 --> 00:24:58,458
[NARRATOR]
A step toward the future.

450
00:24:58,541 --> 00:25:02,250
In order to follow his path,
he seeks to better himself!

451
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:04,791
Next Time: "A New Trial."
