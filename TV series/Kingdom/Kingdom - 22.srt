[NARRATOR] Ancient China...

The time of the sages was over,
swept away by base human greed. 

17

Over five long and
harrowing centuries,

18
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:31,833
an endless storm of
war, hatred, and strife

19
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:33,375
raged across the land.

20
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:34,875
Over a hundred nations fell,

21
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:37,166
winnowed away until
only seven remained.

00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,500
Now, from Qin, the
westernmost kingdom,

a great wind of history
is about to blow.

I lost sight of
your soul completely.

Thirty years ago,
a small kingdom

143
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:18,333
to the east of Wei called Jia
was wiped out solely by Zhao.

And I am its rightful royalty!

from a perished nation?!

146

[WU QING] I changed my name
and tattooed my face.

147
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,333
I became someone else,

148
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:33,125
and wandered the land
until I ended up in Wei.

149
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,583
And there, thanks to
Lord Xinling's protection,

150
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:40,791
I regained my name, and Wei
became my second homeland.

151
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:45,916
But I have never, for one
moment, forgotten the sight

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,375
of our castle going up
in flames that day!

I understand.

154
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,416
So your obsession
with that grudge

155
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,666
gave you the impudence to go
ahead and challenge me, then?

156
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,333
Someone like you
could never understand

157
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,750
what it's like to
lose your country!

158

nothing on the battlefield!

164
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,833
A soldier thinks of how
to conquer the enemy

165
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,166
in front of him.

166
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,541
A general thinks of
how to win against the army.

167
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:30,791
He doesn't let his mind
be ruled by anything else!

168
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:34,333
All that awaits a man like you
who puts his personal feelings

169
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,916
before his duty as
general is defeat!

170
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,458
Come, Wu Qing!

171
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,750
On my honor as
commanding general of Qin,

172
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,833
see to your dynasty!

173
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:50,583
[WU QING]
So the mood has changed...

174
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:53,625
No, it was Lord Biao
who changed it.

175
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:02,541
[WU QING] I realized something
when I saw my castle burn.

176
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:07,666
[WU QING] There is something
mighty in this world

177
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:11,666
that bows to no justice
mankind could ever conceive of.

178
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,625
For me, right now, that
something is Lord Biao.

179
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:18,750
Fighting him spells
certain death for me.

180
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,708
But even so...

181
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,166
[WU QING] Even so...

182
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:29,166
[WU QING] ...I shall not yield!

Your cleverness made this
a hard-fought battle for me

and your fierce passion
for the sword at the end...

193

I must say that you truly did
blaze brightly, Wu Qing!

[cheering continues]

199
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:48,000
[NARRATOR] While Qin's soldiers'
cheers rang in his ears,

200
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:52,000
Xin's gaze was captured not
by the triumphant Lord Biao,

201
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:57,041
but by the tragic figure of
Wu Qing laying on the ground.

202
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,833
This was because even in death,

203
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,875
a tiny flame still
smoldered in his eyes.

204
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:09,375
[NARRATOR] At the sight, Xin
murmured silently to himself,

205
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,708
"So this is what a general is."

206
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:26,708
[NARRATOR] And so the tide
of battle was determined.

207
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:31,291
The Qin soldiers who had served
under Lord Biao numbered 3,000.

208
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:34,875
The Wei soldiers surrounding
them numbered over 50,000.

209
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:38,333
However, in Wei's army
there was not a single man

210
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,708
who raised his
slumped shoulders.

211
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:47,708
[WEI SOLDIERS sobbing]

212
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,583
[WEI COMMANDER 21A]
General Wu Qing...

213
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:56,208
[sobbing continues]

214
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,958
[NARRATOR] To Wei's armies,
that great general

215
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,291
was simply too
important a figure.

216

[WEI SOLDIERS sobbing]

217
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,708
[NARRATOR] His
second-in-command, Bai Guixi,

218
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:08,083
could restore
their will to fight.

219
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,750
And in his path
stood this man...

220
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:13,750
Wait, you are...

221
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:17,708
That was the first good battle
I've seen in quite a while.

222
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:21,083
To drag the battle out
any longer would just be

223
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:24,208
somewhat gilding the
lily, now, would it not?

224
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:26,875
Or are you telling me
that you are confident

225
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:30,458
that you can now perform
an even greater battle

226
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,416
with myself, Wang Yi?

guys from the other armies, too.

[LORD BIAO] Ah, Wang Yi!

247

you exerting pressure
from the hilltop like that.

happened to be passing by,

251
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,625
so I decided to watch.

252

By the way, General,
what do you plan to do now?

[LORD BIAO] Huh?

254

[WANG YI] Do you intend to
go straight on to the castle?

Or...

256

Nothing is more difficult than

bringing an inferno
back to life after it's gone.

00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:39,875
You, prioritizing
something else over food?!

323
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,750
Wow, you've really matured!

324
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:42,875
That's a squadron commande-- 

325
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:45,208
[XIN's stomach growls]

326
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:48,083
[DIAO giggles]

327
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,458
[XIN] Hmph.

328
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,708
We'll need energy
for armor shopping!

329
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,166
I guess we better
eat up first!

330
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:58,750
Welcome!

331
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,833
Oh, I've never
seen you two before.

332
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,916
Well, we came all the way
here from three villages over!

333
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,125
This guy here
wants to buy armor.

334
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,250
Armor?

335
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:08,833
YOU want to?!

336
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,291
Are you going to wear armor
for your first war?

337
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,958
My first war's done.

338
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:16,291
I'm using the reward money
from that war to buy some armor.

339
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:17,458
What?!

340
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:20,291
The last battle was
that one against Wei

341
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,041
three months ago, wasn't it?

342
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:25,500
The men from this neighborhood
who did join the Fourth Army--

343
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,083
Almost all of them died!

344
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,375
That's not even a good lie.

345
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:29,958
[XIN yells]

346
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:33,750
I'm tellin' ya that I fought in
the Fourth Army and I got paid!

347
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:37,958
Hey, the place is noisy today.

348
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,416
Wait up, isn't he...?

349
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,833
See?! Right there is a real
and true Fourth Army hero!

350
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,291
[TIAN YOU gasps]

351
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,625
Uh?

352
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,958
[TIAN YOU] Oh!
Hello there, my lord!

353
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,958
[XIN] You're that guy everybody
wanted most for their squad!

354
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:58,625
[CROWD murmuring]

355
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,958
You are looking
very well, my lord.

356
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,166
[XIN] Call me Xin.

357
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,416
You're looking pretty
good yourself, Pops!

358
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,750
Hey, chief,

359
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:09,208
is this brat--I mean this
young man--really him?

360
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:10,666
[XIN] Hm?

361
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,791
Yep, this is Xin,
the man from that war

362
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:20,750
who fought like a demon
and went from foot soldier...

363
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:23,708
...all the way to a
real squadron commander!

364
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:26,041
[CROWD gasps]

365
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:30,208
But a squadron commander
leads a 100-man unit!

366
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:33,458
This kid climbed that
high in just one war?!

367
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,791
[TIAN YOU] It's the kind of
thing that hardly ever happens

368
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:37,875
but it's more than justified.

369
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:40,333
Without Xin, that war
might've been lost,

370
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:42,541
let alone the
Fourth Army's part of it.

371
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,208
You exaggerate.

372
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:48,833
Everyone was telling stories
about you on the way back home.

373
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:52,041
When I heard that you had
made squadron commander,

374
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,041
I could not have
been happier for you!

375
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:56,000
[XIN] Seriously?!

376
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:59,875
I've never looked forward to
the next war this much before.

377
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,500
But I'm sure that
I'm not the only one

378
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:05,958
who wants to try fighting
for you in your unit, Xin.

379
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:07,291
[XIN] Hmph!

380
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,458
My unit's gonna get worked
to the bone, you know!

381
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:10,916
Ha, ha!

382
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:43,791
[XIN hums]

383
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:46,666
[DIAO] I'm glad you
got to buy your armor, Xin.

384
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:50,125
[XIN] Heh, heh!
I look cool, huh?!

385
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:51,458
[DIAO] Mmm-hmm...

386
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:55,125
No you don't! Quit bragging.
Are you a child?

387
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,500
Huh? Which is it, then?!

388
00:22:56,583 --> 00:23:00,375
Um, what I'm saying is...

389
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:01,750
Uh...

390
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:06,625
Xin, you've really
grown up... Mmm-hmm.

391
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:14,375
[XIN] It's you!

392
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:16,125
Qiang Lei!

393
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:56,125
[QIANG LEI] I am alive
for one reason only, you see.

394
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:58,083
[NARRATOR] A secret past.

395
00:24:58,166 --> 00:25:01,958
On a night spent alone together,
their souls tremble.

396
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:04,583
Next Time: "An Evening Story."
