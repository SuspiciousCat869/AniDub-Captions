1
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:45,041
[ZUO CI] You've overestimated
yourselves, you worms.

2
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:49,083
[BI thinking] S-So this...
this is Zuo Ci!

3
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,083
[BI thinking] What am I doing?

4
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:55,208
I should set the example
and stand before him,

5
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:57,458
rally our men's
fighting spirit...

6
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:59,541
But still...

7
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:01,541
Even though I...
I know what to do,

8
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:03,333
my body won't move!

9
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:06,750
[BI] I can't move!

10
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,666
[XIN] Hey, hey.

11
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,375
Overestimating ourselves?

12
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:17,625
I think that's more <i>your</i> style,

13
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:19,916
idiot-face!

14
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,000
[BI thinking] Xin!!

15
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:29,166
[NARRATOR] Ancient China...

16
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,750
The time of the sages was over,
swept away by base human greed.

17
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:35,000
Over five long and
harrowing centuries,

18
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:37,250
an endless storm of war, hatred,

19
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:39,208
and strife raged
across the land,

20
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:40,875
Over a hundred nations fell,

21
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:43,666
winnowed away until
only seven remained.

22
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,291
Now, from Qin, the
westernmost kingdom,

23
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:48,375
a great wind of history
is about to blow.

24
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:51,166
This is the tale of a
nameless boy and a young king

25
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,833
who ran the gauntlet
in this age of strife.

26
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:35,250
[yelling, fighting sounds]

27
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,750
[shocked sounds]

28
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,500
[ZHENG]
Yooooo!

29
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,583
[YANG DUANHE thinking]
A worthy King of Qin,

30
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:13,250
heading right into
the thick of the fray?

31
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,375
[MOUNTAIN FOLK 12A]
Don't you sense something?

32
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:16,666
[YANG DUANHE] Hmm?

33
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:21,708
Is it Ba Jio?

34
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:24,708
No. I suspect, it's that boy.

35
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,625
[YANG DUANHE] It seems the
time is ripe over there, too.

36
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:34,416
[pants]

37
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:43,291
You're overestimating
yourself, dimwit.

38
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:46,625
[ZUO CI] Oh?

39
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:47,541
[gasps]

40
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:52,458
"Oh?" I'll give you "Oh"!

41
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:55,375
Yaaaaaaaahh!

42
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,000
Ouch.

43
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,416
[XIN] You're quick, jerkwad...

44
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,416
...and you're dead!

45
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,500
Hyaaaaah!

46
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,958
<i>Who</i> is that kid?

47
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:49,666
Against Zuo Ci, who finishes
every foe with a single cut...

48
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:53,541
He's trading blow for blow!

49
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,000
Oh, wow...

50
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,208
Xin. Fight hard.

51
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,458
[BI thinking] Why, Xin?

52
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,041
[BI thinking]
Why is it that you, a boy,

53
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,208
can stand up to Zuo Ci?!

54
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,583
Aren't you terrified?

55
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:23,500
Where do you draw that
hidden strength from?

56
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,750
You two...

57
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,416
[BI] Lord Piao...

58
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,041
That's right.

59
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:39,166
Lord Piao took the lead
without blinking, too,

60
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,791
in cutting a swath
through Wang Yi's force.

61
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:45,916
[XIN] I'm gonna become
the world's greatest general!

62
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,333
[BI gasps]

63
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:51,416
The world's greatest general?
That's an absurd dream.

64
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,500
[DIAO] Considering
how stupid he is,

65
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:57,125
he's got huge dreams
and attitude to match.

66
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,291
And him, a commoner,
who didn't even know

67
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:02,666
how one becomes a general
until just recently.

68
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,708
[XIN] Shut up!

69
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:06,833
If I say I will
become one, I will!

70
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:09,416
What's more, this
isn't just <i>my</i> dream!

71
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,666
[ZHENG] It's a rugged road.

72
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:19,000
Ha! I'll thrive on whatever
kind of path--Whoa!

73
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:23,083
[ZHENG] I just said
this is a rugged road...

74
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,916
You... don't play
games with me!

75
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,750
The road to a generalship
will be much more rugged.

76
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:34,166
Heh. Ha!
Well I sure hope so.

77
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,166
And hey, just for the record...

78
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,250
Not just a general,

79
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,500
but I'll be the
world's greatest general!

80
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,083
Don't get it wrong!

81
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:45,541
[ZHENG] Is that right?

82
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:49,583
[XIN] Hey, Zheng, you just
mocked me, didn't you?!

83
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:52,791
Dammit, you just watch!
I will definitely do it!

84
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:59,916
[BI] You really mean
to achieve that, Xin?!

85
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,208
[BI] If so...

86
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:15,833
[BI] If you,
a nameless servant boy,

87
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:18,666
are to become the
greatest of generals...

88
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,041
[XIN] I got you.
That must really sting!

89
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,166
The real fight begins now!

90
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,625
Whoa... Ah...

91
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:30,375
Well, hey, there!
Lost your concentration?

92
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,625
Are you a bit scared?

93
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:43,541
[XIN] Wh-What just happened?
I never saw it coming.

94
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:46,708
Xin!

95
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,875
[BI thinking]
Xin, if you're soaring toward

96
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,250
becoming the
greatest of generals,

97
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,958
the right hand of a King,

98
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:59,166
who seeks to unify the
entire Middle Kingdom...

99
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:06,666
[BI thinking] If you are...

100
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,666
[BI thinking] If you are...

101
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:13,833
Die.

102
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,166
[BI thinking]
I already let one die.

103
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:26,166
[BI thinking]
I won't let you kill this boy!

104
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,125
[BI thinking] That was shallow,
but I've cut him twice!

105
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:34,041
If I take one step closer,
I'll have him!

106
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:51,916
No, Bi!!

107
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,916
[ZUO CI sighs]

108
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,166
Let's continue, young one.

109
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,708
Your Highness!
Are you all right?!

110
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:23,250
Pay no mind. This doesn't
even qualify as a scratch.

111
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:24,916
[SOLDIER 12A] You're too far in.

112
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,041
Your Highness should
be behind the rest of us.

113
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:27,541
Gaaah!!

114
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:28,583
[ZHENG] Huh?

115
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,541
Your Highness... prepare to die.

116
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,125
Wei Xing...

117
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:53,333
[XIN grunts in pain]

118
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,916
You... What you did to Bi...

119
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:14,708
[XIN thinking] What the...?

120
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,916
Is it 'cuz of that blow
to the head I took?

121
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,666
The sword is about power.

122
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,166
And about speed.

123
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,375
Xin!

124
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,375
[XIN] My strength is...

125
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:49,583
I, who have attained the
pinnacle of both of them...

126
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:53,208
...am the mightiest in the land.

127
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,041
[ZUO CI] You, a young one,

128
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:18,458
dared to wound the flesh
of the great Zuo Ci now?

129
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:23,750
Tell me, how do you plan
to make this right again, hmm?

130
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:27,916
That's it. Zuo Ci
has completely snapped.

131
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,041
Of course he has.

132
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,291
After all, he'll cut
someone in two

133
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,666
just for dirtying his clothes.

134
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,875
[ENEMY GUARD 12B] That kid
will be tortured to death now.

135
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,416
He will.

136
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,500
This fight now has
been settled. Let's go.

137
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,083
Kill them all!

138
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:00,791
Huh?

139
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:05,791
He's alive!

140
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,833
[DIAO] Bi! Wake up, Bi!

141
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:21,208
What? Did you
say something?

142
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,333
How's the battle?

143
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:25,750
Huh?

144
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,666
They're all hard pressed...

145
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,583
...especially Xin.

146
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,500
The battle's terribly one-sided.

147
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,083
Terribly.

148
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,125
But it'll be okay.

149
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,666
I mean, we do
have Xin after all!

150
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,208
[XIN grunts]

151
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,750
[DIAO] No matter
how much he gets torn up,

152
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,833
he won't lose!

153
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,083
No matter how much
he gets torn up...

154
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,708
...he'll always win!

155
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,958
That's the truth, Xin!

156
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,125
Huh?

157
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,166
Die!

158
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:56,208
Well now, who said
you could squat down?

159
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,208
On your feet, worm!

160
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,166
What's the matter?

161
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,750
Your scheme was to break away

162
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:07,083
and strike at the
throne room, correct?

163
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:10,875
If so, then go on!
Defeat me.

164
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:11,875
What's wrong?

165
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,750
What's the matter, young one?!

166
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,875
C'mon! C'mon! On your feet!

167
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,458
[ZUO CI]
You're done already? Huh?

168
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:28,208
Xi-Xin... Xin!

169
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,458
[XIN] Finally.

170
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:57,875
[XIN] You fool,
yammering on and on...

171
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,000
[XIN] I wasn't listening at all,

172
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,291
so say it again for me...

173
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:09,375
Who's the mightiest
in all the land?

174
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,750
Thanks to your
meaningless jabber,

175
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:15,000
I've completely recovered now.

176
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,750
So get up.

177
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,708
I'll teach you who's
mightiest in all the land!

178
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,583
[WEI XING thinking]
Oh?

179
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:28,208
So young and yet, not shrinking
from me mounted before him.

180
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:31,583
Royalty, but a warrior's
heart resides within?

181
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:34,833
Or is he a second
coming of King Zhao?

182
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,875
But the time and place

183
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,125
you were born into
are just too harsh!

184
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,833
Forgive me!

185
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,416
What was that?!

186
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:54,000
[LORD CHANGWEN] For someone who
sits on his horse so arrogantly,

187
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:57,791
your blows are quite
lightweight, Wei Xing!

188
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,541
Lord Changwen!

189
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,666
[LORD CHANGWEN thinking]
Until the breakaway force

190
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,625
reaches the throne room...

191
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,541
[LORD CHANGWEN thinking]
Until they strike down

192
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:11,958
Cheng Jiao and Jie Shi...

193
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,875
[ZHENG thinking]
We hold out here at all hazards!

194
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:16,416
We're counting on you, Xin!

195
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,458
[WANG YI laughs]

196
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:23,083
Tastefully handled as
always, Lord Changwen.

197
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,791
But, it's too bad
there's one place

198
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,625
where I can't watch from.

199
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:30,041
Teng, are you here?

200
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,208
Yes. You called, sir?

201
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:36,750
Would you kindly go see what the
situation is in that corridor?

202
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,000
Hey, someone go
down to the right--

203
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,625
I'm speaking to you, Teng.

204
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:43,250
But Zuo Ci is the one
supposed to be guarding there.

205
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:46,583
Won't the breakaway force
already be destroyed?

206
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,708
[WANG YI] If they get
through that corridor,

207
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:52,416
there's nothing to keep
them from the throne room.

208
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,708
Si Shi likely posted
Zuo Ci there

209
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,541
with the aim of
winning at all costs.

210
00:17:57,625 --> 00:18:00,041
But Lord Changwen
and the King

211
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:03,666
sent the breakaway force
in full awareness of that.

212
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,875
[gasps]

213
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,041
They are sure of
getting past Zuo Ci?

214
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:10,791
[WANG YI] Well... setting
questions of confidence aside,

215
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:14,541
what I'm saying is that without
a shadow of a doubt the person

216
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:18,458
in whom those two trust
the most is fighting there.

217
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,958
[chuckles]

218
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:27,708
[ZUO CI] I see. While I was
having my fun, you recovered.

219
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,125
What of it then?

220
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,958
We're merely back
to where we started.

221
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,000
You no longer have a
mask to protect your head,

222
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,333
with my next blow,

223
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:42,416
I'll spatter what little
brains you have all over.

224
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:52,208
[XIN thinking]
He's right: one more blow.

225
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:58,541
With cuts all over,
I've lost too much blood.

226
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:01,750
I've lost feeling
here and there.

227
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:05,208
I only have strength left
for a single blow.

228
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,250
But that's enough...

229
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,958
This is not a wooden sword.

230
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,666
[XIN thinking] This is the
sword bequeathed to me by Piao!

231
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:22,000
[slows down breathing]

232
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,708
[XIN] Watch this, Bi!

233
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:05,416
[ZUO CI] In speed or in power,
no one can match me whatsoever.

234
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,041
Xin!

235
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,041
[ZUO CI] Huh?

236
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,375
[XIN] Old man,
seems like the blood rose

237
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:18,750
to your head and
you didn't notice.

238
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,916
After Bi cut you twice,

239
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,250
your speed and your power
are lessened by half.

240
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,541
Now I've made
things right for Bi.

241
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:34,416
Time to take in
what happened.

242
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:57,458
[ZUO CI] I, Zuo Ci...
by a punk like this...?

243
00:20:57,541 --> 00:21:00,916
Who are you...?

244
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,666
I am Xin.

245
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,583
[XIN] We did it, Bi.

246
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:39,000
[BI] Why cry...

247
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,041
...when you've won?

248
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:47,416
Did someone close
to you die or something?

249
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,416
[XIN] Bi! You're alive?!

250
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,416
[BI] Guess my holding back meant

251
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,208
he wounded me a
little less deeply, too.

252
00:21:58,291 --> 00:21:59,625
[XIN] You stupid jerk!

253
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,875
You scared the heck out of me!

254
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:03,250
[BA JIO]
The warrior Tajifu says,

255
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:06,583
"That man is alive.
It is okay."

256
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,750
[XIN] It's too late
to tell me that now!

257
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,500
[everybody laughs]

258
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:17,000
It would seem
that it's over now.

259
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:20,750
I just wonder what sort of
person he is in whom the King

260
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:23,666
and Lord Changwen
have placed their trust.

261
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,125
[chuckles]

262
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,083
[BI] They're all
torn into pieces.

263
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:30,750
But those two only paid

264
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:33,125
the ultimate sacrifice
against so many and Zuo Ci

265
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:34,916
speaks volumes
for the fearsomeness

266
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,166
of the mountain folk.

267
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,958
[XIN] Well, if someone
can just bring down

268
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:41,000
the commander,
this is how it goes.

269
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:43,958
[DIAO] More importantly Bi,
shouldn't you be lying down?

270
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:46,500
[XIN] When we've come this
far he's gonna lie down?

271
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:48,083
[XIN] Right, Bi, my man?

272
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,666
[BI] Exactly.

273
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:53,625
[BI] Passing through
this corridor will take us

274
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:56,000
immediately to the throne room.

275
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,416
In the throne room

276
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,583
is the ringleader of this
whole affair, Cheng Jiao.

277
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:07,000
[PIAO] Listen, Xin.
I entrust it to you!

278
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,833
[BI] Are you ready
for this, Xin?

279
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:14,416
Damn right!

280
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:21,375
[XIN] Now we strike
down Cheng Jiao!

281
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:55,833
[XIN] Wha-What are you?!

282
00:24:55,916 --> 00:24:57,833
[NARRATOR] Is that
grotesque shape a man,

283
00:24:57,916 --> 00:24:59,083
or a beast?

284
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:01,333
Swords become powerless.

285
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:04,333
Next Time: "Lan Kai Roars."
