1
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:12,166
[XIN]
That means...

2
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,666
...this is the place?

3
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,916
But... Piao, it's just
an ordinary hut!

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,666
What's the story here?

5
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:24,291
[XIN] I come all this way,
without avenging your death,

6
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:26,208
without even knowing why...

7
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:28,208
...and this is what I find?

8
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:32,500
[XIN] Tell me, Piao...

9
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:35,625
[XIN]
Why?

10
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:37,791
Why did you die?

11
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:40,458
Why did you use your dying
breath to guide me here,

12
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:43,166
to this decrepit old shack?

13
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,458
[XIN] What... What in
the world could be here?

14
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:05,208
It can't be!

15
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:07,875
It's not possible!

16
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:19,291
Piao?!

17
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:21,166
[NARRATOR] Ancient China...

18
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,000
The time of the sages was over,

19
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,041
swept away by base human greed.

20
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:26,791
Over five centuries,
an endless storm

21
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:30,250
of war, hatred, and strife
raged across the land.

22
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:31,791
Over a hundred nations fell,

23
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:34,416
winnowed away until
only seven remained.

24
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,791
Now, from Qin, the
westernmost kingdom,

25
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:39,625
a great wind of history
is about to blow.

26
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:42,416
This is the tale of a
nameless boy and a young King

27
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,166
who ran the gauntlet
in this age of strife.

28
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:01,083
Who the hell was that kid?
Little monster!

29
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,458
In all my days of
doing this gig,

30
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:07,458
never seen a kid that tough.
I-I think my rib is broken!

31
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:10,458
[VILLAGER 1B] You were sloppy,
you stupid lowlife.

32
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,791
Heibei village is supposed
to be feared by everyone!

33
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,291
You call yourself one of us?

34
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,208
[VILLAGER 1C] Oh yeah,
because you're one to talk.

35
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:19,041
[VILLAGERS laughing]

36
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:22,625
You got that right...
Ugh... huh?

37
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,250
[VILLAGER 1C] Hey, what's up?

38
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,541
Over there...
Someone's coming.

39
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,708
Who's this joker?

40
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:40,500
Hey! What's with you,
Mr. Cool? Huh?

41
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:47,541
Huh?

42
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,250
Huh?

43
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:56,750
[VILLAGER yelling in pain]

44
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,875
W-Wait just a minute!

45
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,500
That outfit...

46
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,041
I've heard of
that uniform before.

47
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,458
[VILLAGER 1A] It can't be...

48
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:10,625
Then he's...
a Vermilion Slayer!

49
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:13,208
Vermilion Slayers are
from a clan of assassins

50
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,375
said to have a 200 year history.

51
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:16,375
He's one of them?

52
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:17,875
Oh crap!

53
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,583
They say if they target you,
your life is literally over!

54
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:31,250
You look just like him,
but you're not Piao.

55
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,833
But... But why?

56
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,500
I-I can't look away!

57
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:37,958
So it's true.

58
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:41,166
If you've come, that must
mean that Piao's dead.

59
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,541
[XIN] How do you know Piao?

60
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,000
I don't get it!
Who are you?

61
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,750
Why do you have
the same face as Piao?!

62
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,083
And how do you
know Piao and me?

63
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:53,000
Look, would you tell me what
this is all this about?!

64
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,958
[ZHENG] It seems there
isn't time to explain.

65
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,625
Wh-What was that?
An enemy?

66
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,375
Who the hell are you?

67
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:16,791
There's no escaping me now.

68
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:21,250
[XU WAN] Your life is mine,
High King Ying Zheng.

69
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:27,875
[XIN]
Did... Did he just say...?

70
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,416
You're...

71
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,458
...the king of Qin?!

72
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:33,916
[ZHENG] I am.

73
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,791
[XU WAN] Ahh, so you're not
one of the King's retinue,

74
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:37,958
little one?

75
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,083
Yes, you're standing
beside the King,

76
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,750
who's managed to keep himself
alive a little longer

77
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,958
thanks to a very
excellent stand-in.

78
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,291
A stand-in?

79
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:47,833
[XU WAN] It's surprising
that two different people

80
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,625
could look
that much alike.

81
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:53,416
Even I was fooled,
if you can believe it.

82
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,291
What's more, that stand-in was
quite an amazing boy.

83
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,125
He's the first prey who
ever managed to escape me,

84
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,625
even though I struck
him a mortal blow.

85
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,291
[XU WAN] Ironically, though,

86
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,916
that same stubborn streak
ended up betraying him.

87
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,541
It allowed me to
track you to this place.

88
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:21,250
Xin... We're both the same...

89
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:24,000
...in both ability and spirit.

90
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:27,041
The two of us have
always been one at heart.

91
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:30,541
If you spread
your wings and fly...

92
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:34,291
I promise...
I'll be there, too...

93
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,708
Xin... take me with you...

94
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,416
...and conquer everything
under the heavens.

95
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:47,625
Piao!

96
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:52,833
[XIN] Piao... Piao...

97
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,583
Piao!

98
00:07:54,666 --> 00:08:03,125
[XIN screams]

99
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:07,416
Damn you... It's all
falling into place now!

100
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,958
You're the King...

101
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,083
...and you're an assassin!

102
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,125
[XIN] That's why Piao
was taken to court

103
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,791
in the first place,
wasn't it?

104
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,291
[XIN] He was supposed
to be the stand-in

105
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:18,875
because he looked
just like the King!

106
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:22,291
And when it worked, he was
mistaken for you and killed!

107
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:25,000
You knew that your half-brother
would rebel against you!

108
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,833
So you ran away here to
hide yourself, safe and sound,

109
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,416
and left Piao in your place!

110
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,000
You left him at court,

111
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:34,333
making him pretend to be you,
knowing that he'd be attacked!

112
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,250
Yes, that's exactly right.

113
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:43,041
Damn you...

114
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,416
Well, well, things
have gotten interesting.

115
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,583
Little one?

116
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:48,958
If you wish, I'll
relinquish the pleasure

117
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,375
of killing
the King to you.

118
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:53,750
His head, however,
still belongs to me.

119
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,041
[XIN] I'll kill him.

120
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,791
I'll cut him to pieces.

121
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,583
[XU WAN] Good, little one.

122
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,458
I'll watch and see
what skills you have.

123
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,666
[XIN] You'll sit back and watch?

124
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,875
Oh, no, you won't!

125
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,000
You're the one who
killed Piao, after all!

126
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,000
I'll tear your guts out!

127
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:27,208
[ZHENG] This boy's
swordsmanship is extraordinary.

128
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,458
But still...

129
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,708
[XU WAN]
You're good, little one.

130
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,666
Your strength,
quickness, and skill

131
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,958
are all on par
with that stand-in,

132
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,833
Piao, or whatever his name was.

133
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,166
[XU WAN] But when
it comes down to it,

134
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,916
your sword's never
tasted real blood.

135
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,541
[XIN] He's huge!

136
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:52,083
You'd need at least another
hundred years of training

137
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:54,041
before you could challenge me!

138
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,583
[XU WAN] What a pointless
waste of my time.

139
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,375
Now, Ying Zheng...

140
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,916
Prepare for your end.

141
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:15,083
My half-brother's
head isn't here yet.

142
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,875
Give it more time,
honored lord.

143
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,166
The one who's pursuing him
is a Vermilion Slayer.

144
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,916
He should return with
your brother's head soon.

145
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,916
"Should?" That's your
excuse of an answer?

146
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,583
[PO SHI groaning]

147
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,750
[JIE SHI] Now now, please,

148
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:36,125
try to calm yourself,
most honored lord.

149
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,208
Rest assured,
no other assassins

150
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:41,708
can surpass the
Vermilion Slayers.

151
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:42,958
I see.

152
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,833
However, there's still
another obstacle

153
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,791
besides my half-brother.

154
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,083
You're taking the
necessary measures, I trust?

155
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,250
[JIE SHI]
In all things, Lordship.

156
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,041
A-Another obstacle?

157
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:57,375
Mmm. Did you not know?

158
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,541
[JIE SHI] To deal
with that Lord Changwen,

159
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,791
I decided it needed
a special touch,

160
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,166
so I sent the men who turned
the Battle of Changping

161
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,458
into Hell itself.

162
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,916
[chuckles]

163
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,833
[PO SHI]
Th-The Battle of Changping?

164
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,708
[PO SHI]
At Changping, our Qin army

165
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,916
drove the Kingdom of Zhao's
forces back into their castle,

166
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,541
then cut off
their food supply.

167
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,000
[PO SHI] They say that
in the madness

168
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:30,208
and pangs of starvation,
the soldiers of the Zhao army

169
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,833
began to kill one another
as meat to eat.

170
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,333
[PO SHI]
That was how our kingdom

171
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,458
gained the final
victory in the battle.

172
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:41,416
But our commanding general,
General Bai Qi,

173
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,666
wasn't satisfied.

174
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,458
He had 50,000
prisoners of war beheaded,

175
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:48,375
and 400,000 soldiers
buried alive.

176
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:51,625
That was the hell known as
the Battle of Changping.

177
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:54,333
A-And now...
The ones who did that...

178
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,083
[yelling in pain]

179
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:59,375
Kill every last
person who opposes me.

180
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,708
Understood.

181
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:04,000
That's my good Minister.

182
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:10,458
[laughs ominously]

183
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,833
[XIN] Wait, you...

184
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:19,875
[XU WAN] Huh?

185
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,208
[XIN] Do you think that
you've already beaten me?

186
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,500
[XU WAN] What?

187
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:29,500
Oh, you're still
breathing, are you?

188
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:32,500
But now your will's
been completely broken.

189
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:35,041
I doubt you can even stand.

190
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,208
[XIN] He's good...

191
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,875
No, he's impossibly good.

192
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:47,041
He was able to defeat Piao.

193
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,083
[XIN] I can't pretend anymore...

194
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,250
I'm no match for him.

195
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:54,125
There's no way I could
hope to beat him.

196
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,916
[XIN] I'm sorry, Piao...

197
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,666
I'm so sorry.

198
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,875
[ZHENG] Xin.

199
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,833
Don't keep
over-thinking things.

200
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,541
Or, if you must think,

201
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:09,750
then concentrate on purging
your regrets over Piao.

202
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,041
My regrets over Piao?

203
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:19,833
[XIN] Don't you ever...

204
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,333
He's standing!

205
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:25,750
Don't you ever speak
Piao's name again!

206
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,041
[XIN] Piao...

207
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:30,208
Piao's life was just beginning!

208
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:33,833
And you tangled him up in
a petty brothers' quarrel!

209
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,708
Petty, you say?

210
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,250
Yes, it was petty!

211
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:38,750
You think us people
on the bottom

212
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,250
give a damn
about who's King?!

213
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,041
None of that matters!

214
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,291
And as for you...

215
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,583
You... curse you!

216
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:50,750
Because of you, he's dead.

217
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,041
And now he's never...

218
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:57,500
He's never coming back again!

219
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,000
[ZHENG] He's fast.

220
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,750
And the blow was heavier.

221
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:20,000
This little one...

222
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,333
[PIAO] Yes, it's true
that Xin's ability and mine

223
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,416
are about equal.

224
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,958
But still...

225
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:28,500
When it comes down to it,
Xin might be stronger.

226
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,083
[ZHENG] Xin is stronger?

227
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,875
[PIAO] Yes, Your Majesty.

228
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,708
What a strange thing to say.

229
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:37,458
You just finished
claiming you were equals.

230
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:40,583
When I spar with Xin,
we're exactly matched.

231
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:43,083
Just the same if an
opponent were too strong

232
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:47,583
for me to beat,
Xin could still win.

233
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,083
[ZHENG] Does that mean
that he was holding back

234
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,041
in all your bouts?

235
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,458
[PIAO] No, Your Majesty.

236
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,416
Xin always goes all out.

237
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,375
For some reason,
when we fight, he's my equal.

238
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,625
But whenever I got
one victory ahead of him,

239
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:05,541
Xin would always
win the next day.

240
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:09,375
What a tiresome fellow.
Sounds annoying.

241
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,958
Well, I can't deny that!

242
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,833
[laughs]

243
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:15,708
[PIAO] He can be
tiresome, but still...

244
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,916
[PIAO] ...Xin truly
is strong, Majesty.

245
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:24,416
[XU WAN]
Time to die, little one!

246
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:32,333
[XU WAN] Now the horror
is just beginning for you!

247
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:33,416
[ZHENG] No...

248
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,125
[ZHENG]
Xin's reading his attacks!

249
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:38,541
What's this?

250
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:47,041
Is that all you got,
Mr. Red Guy?

251
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,416
[XU WAN] Enough words!

252
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,291
[XU WAN] Huh? This little one...
He's dodging my blade.

253
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,333
But still,
if that's all he does...

254
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:55,541
[ZHENG] ...then he can't win.

255
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,583
What will you do, Xin?

256
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,833
[XU WAN] This is the end!

257
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:06,125
[ZHENG] You're getting
flustered, assassin.

258
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,666
Now you're mine!

259
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,500
[XU WAN] Little one!

260
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,458
[XU WAN] Impossible!

261
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,708
I've been cut!

262
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:30,541
Die, little one!

263
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:33,875
[XU WAN] He's vanished!

264
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,291
[PIAO] Your Majesty...

265
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:40,875
If anything should happen to me,
please, trust in Xin.

266
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,416
[PIAO] I'm certain...

267
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:48,125
[PIAO] ...He'll soar
higher than anyone!

268
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,291
[XU WAN] It can't be...

269
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,708
This little one...
could beat me?!

270
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,750
[ZHENG] So... this
is Xin's strength.

271
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,083
[XIN] You... You killed Piao...

272
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:11,166
I'll show you!

273
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,541
Now who's laughing,
you damn monster?!

274
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:15,458
You're finished!

275
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,916
[XU WAN] W-Wait!

276
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,708
Please, I beg you!
I have family.

277
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,250
I have four children!

278
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:25,791
If I die, they'll become
orphans and sold into slavery!

279
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:27,791
Please, let me live!

280
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:32,375
Just spare my life,
for my children's sake!

281
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:33,791
Orphans?

282
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,416
Ah... Thank you.
Thank you so much,

283
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,458
from the bottom
of my heart.

284
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:43,500
[XU WAN] Thank--

285
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:51,166
Your children
have no bearing

286
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,083
on your crimes.

287
00:18:57,166 --> 00:19:00,166
[ZHENG] So what's next?
Do you wish to kill me?

288
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:05,208
[ZHENG] If so, know that I will
not just stand here and let you.

289
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,916
More than a few
people have already died

290
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,208
to protect me
this far, after all.

291
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,875
Your friend Piao
was among them.

292
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:17,583
[XIN] Damn you...

293
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,625
You knew he'd be
attacked by this fiend.

294
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:22,291
Why did you stand by
and let Piao die?

295
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,083
[ZHENG] A life belongs
to no one else.

296
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,666
Only to the person
who lives it.

297
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,833
[XIN] Wh-What?

298
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:30,958
[ZHENG] Every person has a path.

299
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,750
How a person chooses
to live their life--

300
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,500
That is their path.

301
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,916
Stop trying to trick me
with your stupid blather!

302
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,083
[ZHENG] You probably can't
understand right now.

303
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,833
But in order to become
a great general,

304
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,958
Piao agreed to
become my stand-in.

305
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:49,458
That was the path he chose
for himself at the time.

306
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:53,750
And as for you, it seems you
haven't found your path yet.

307
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:56,000
My path... huh?

308
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:01,625
[XIN] Piao, you entrusted
this country's King to me.

309
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:05,416
But... it's almost as if
he killed you himself!

310
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:10,833
[XIN] Damn it!
What am I supposed to do?!

311
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:13,000
Tell me what to do, Piao!

312
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,000
[XIN] What...
What are you doing?

313
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,750
[ZHENG] Be silent.

314
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:25,208
[ZHENG] This is bad.
Can you feel it?

315
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:27,750
[XIN] The ground...

316
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:30,166
I felt it tremble
a little, just now.

317
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,041
Shoot!

318
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,041
Everything that moves
is a target!

319
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,750
Loose arrows!

320
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,333
[XIN] Hey, what is that?

321
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:58,541
What's going on?

322
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,125
Soldiers... and a lot of them.

323
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,541
Soldiers?

324
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:08,083
Oh man, what's with all
the noise so late at night?

325
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:25,291
[distant yelling]

326
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,041
They're over there!

327
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,291
And over there, too?

328
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,083
Crap. We're surrounded.

329
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,583
We're gonna have
to take the river.

330
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:35,125
[ZHENG] That won't work.

331
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:41,291
[XIN] When did they show up?
What is all this?

332
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:42,916
[ZHENG] It seems
my brother's influence

333
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,708
has tainted the
entire army hierarchy.

334
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:49,083
[ZHENG] Perhaps the outcome of
this fight was already decided

335
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,958
back when I
anticipated this revolt,

336
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:54,583
but lacked the
strength to suppress it.

337
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:55,750
[XIN] Damn it...

338
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,625
Well, wanna raise
a ruckus one last time?

339
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:58,583
You...

340
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,333
You mean to fight with that?

341
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:03,708
Of course I do!
You won't catch me dying here!

342
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:06,166
You could also take the
path of trading my head

343
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,583
for your survival.

344
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,125
That's ridiculous!

345
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:12,166
There's no way Piao would have
ever wanted that to happen.

346
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,458
I see.

347
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:19,958
And I don't have enough strength
left to fight my way uphill,

348
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:22,000
so I'll have to go
along the river.

349
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:23,750
Stay right with me!

350
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:25,291
Fool.

351
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:27,541
It's impossible for you to break
through this encirclement...

352
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:29,875
Wait, "stay with you?"

353
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:31,750
[XIN] Once we break
through these troops,

354
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:33,583
I want to take my time
deciding whether or not

355
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:34,916
to kill you.

356
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,958
So don't leave my side.

357
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:44,583
[ZHENG] Well, no help for it.
Guess I'm with you.

358
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:46,416
Right. Let's go!

359
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:53,333
Hey! I know you!

360
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:56,208
[giggling]

361
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:13,875
I know a way through.
Come with me.

362
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:55,166
[ZHENG] He knew the risks,
and yet, he still tried!

363
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:57,500
He accepted, knowing it
might even mean death.

364
00:24:57,583 --> 00:25:00,333
[NARRATOR] Xin, can you find
a new light for yourself

365
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:03,083
beyond the endless
flow of tears?

366
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:06,250
Next time: "For a Friend."
