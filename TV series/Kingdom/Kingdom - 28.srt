1
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:12,250
[MESSENGER 27A] Report!

2
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:13,916
We're under attack
from the left!

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,541
There are a hundred of them.

4
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:18,041
They're on their way
to Formation 2.

5
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:22,958
I see. So that's it, then.

6
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:30,625
[FENG JI] Wang Yi, I understand
you're after my head.

7
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:35,666
Interesting. Let's see
you try and take it!

8
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,416
[NARRATOR] The time:
The Spring &amp; Autumn

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,625
and Warring States periods.

10
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:41,500
The place: Qin.

11
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:45,416
Xin, a nameless boy,
met Zheng, a young King,

12
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,250
distinguished himself in battle,

13
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:49,916
and rose to the rank
of squadron commander.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,166
[NARRATOR] In the midst of this,

15
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,416
the neighboring
kingdom of Zhao invaded,

16
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,250
and Qin faced
unprecedented crisis.

17
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:58,375
What manner of battle
will Wang Yi wage

18
00:00:58,458 --> 00:00:59,750
as commanding general?

19
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:02,833
And what growth
will Xin accomplish?

20
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:43,625
[yelling]

21
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,083
[XIN] We can do it.

22
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:51,750
If we keep this up,
we can do it!

23
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:54,458
[XIN] Yuan and I
used sneak attacks

24
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,291
to take the enemy by surprise
a bunch of times

25
00:02:57,375 --> 00:03:00,125
in the stateless area.

26
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:03,833
[XIN] The tribe we protected
only had a hundred people,

27
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:07,041
so we pretty much had no choice.

28
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:10,791
[XIN] But thanks to that,
I know the power of surprise!

29
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:13,000
[yelling]

30
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,125
[WEI PING] We got through...

31
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:22,416
B-But the hard part
comes next.

32
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,041
Surprising them
got us this far.

33
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:28,250
[LU YAN] Its effects
have worn off now, though.

34
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,791
The rest of our fight will be...

35
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:35,000
...pure force against force!

36
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,208
Be careful!

37
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,958
These guys are all
exceptionally good!

38
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:50,875
[yelling]

39
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:53,166
Form five-man squads!

40
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,250
We can't!

41
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:01,625
Sir, look!

42
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,833
[SOLDIERS choking]

43
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,166
[YUAN] Qiang Lei!

44
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,208
We...

45
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,875
...just have to do it!

46
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,750
Fei Xin Force,
let's follow our commander!

47
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:23,708
[NARRATOR]
At this point in time,

48
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:27,875
Qin's left force's battle
had become one sided.

49
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,041
[NARRATOR] The Qin soldiers
fleeing for the rear

50
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,291
amidst the storm of arrows

51
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:36,250
were harshly shot from the back
by the Zhao mop-up brigade.

52
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:39,250
Though the 1,500 men
in Gan Yang's and Bi's units

53
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:42,125
escaped them
by advancing forward,

54
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,500
most of Qin's
left force was slain

55
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:47,041
by this attack from behind.

56
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:50,375
The remaining force is a
third of its original number.

57
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:54,041
Zhao's soldiers picked off
the survivors at their leisure.

58
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:57,833
Nevertheless, Wang Yi
made no move at all.

59
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,791
[WEI DAO] Darn!

60
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,208
The enemy
is just too strong!

61
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,625
[WEI PING] Not to mention
we're exhausted.

62
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,958
My mind's getting fuzzy!

63
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,875
[WEI DAO] Everything's blurry...

64
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,416
I feel like I could pass out.

65
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,833
[WEI PING]
But... But still...

66
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:30,916
[gasp]

67
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,666
[yelling]

68
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:39,375
[WEI DAO] Every time he cuts
somebody down, my energy rises!

69
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:45,458
[WEI DAO] Each time our leader
slashes apart an enemy...

70
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:50,375
[yelling]

71
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:54,250
[WEI DAO] ...my body brims
with power again!

72
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,625
What's up with these guys?

73
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,291
So wonder boy there,

74
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:01,208
is he really the
squadron's leader, then?

75
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,791
And the amazing thing is

76
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:06,166
he's propping up the
morale of his whole unit.

77
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,125
But we are the elite guard,

78
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,958
and they absolutely
cannot defeat us

79
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,041
on fighting spirit alone!

80
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,083
That's right.

81
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,250
If they stay in this
war of attrition,

82
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:19,500
they'll eventually
be worn down to nothing.

83
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:23,458
Therefore, they're
no threat to our victory!

84
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:26,375
[XIN] Onward! Onward! Onward!

85
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:34,541
[XIN] Damn... we're getting
nowhere like this!

86
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,500
[XIN] But what else do we do?!

87
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,583
[LU YAN] Lieutenant!

88
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:41,916
[YUAN] What is it, Lu Yan?!

89
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,333
[LU YAN] We won't accomplish
anything like this!

90
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,583
I know that!

91
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:48,416
But if we don't crush
the enemy right here...

92
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,583
[LU YAN] Hence my suggestion.

93
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:56,666
Y-You're right,
that's our chance.

94
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,583
[YUAN] Xin, Sir! Pardon!

95
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,000
What was that?
We're in the middle of a battle!

96
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,375
[YUAN] My apologies, Sir!

97
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,583
I need to speak with you!

98
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,958
[XIN] Split up the squadron?!

99
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,375
[YUAN] That's right.

100
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:16,750
If we keep fighting
this war of attrition,

101
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,000
we'll run out of strength,

102
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,250
and we will never
make it past them.

103
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,916
So we should act now
and split up the squadron,

104
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,750
putting all our best men
all on one single team.

105
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:29,875
We ought to send the
elite team after General Feng Ji

106
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:32,750
and have the other soldiers
hold these enemies' attention

107
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:33,833
over here.

108
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:36,083
"Hold these enemies'"...
Wait a second!

109
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:39,458
If we do that, the guys who
stay here will surely all die!

110
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,583
But that's fine!

111
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,875
What'd you say?!

112
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,666
[YUAN]
The Fei Xin Force's mission

113
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,250
isn't to kill the enemies here,

114
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,000
or to bring all one hundred
of us back alive!

115
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:53,250
It's to slay General
Feng Ji of Zhao!

116
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:56,625
As long as we manage that, the
Fei Xin Force will be victorious

117
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,375
even if few survive it!

118
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:01,458
We will all happily stay here
if it lays the foundation

119
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,291
for that victory!

120
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,458
"We will all"?!

121
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,250
I am staying.

122
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:08,583
And the men who
are fighting here

123
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:11,333
will need a leader to
motivate them, after all.

124
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:12,708
Yuan...

125
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,166
Xin!

126
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,416
Lieutenant Yuan is quite right.

127
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,958
Please go, don't trouble
yourself about us.

128
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:19,958
[XIN] But Ze Gui!

129
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,500
[ZE GUI]
You said it yourself, Xin:

130
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:24,625
This is a battle
we cannot afford to lose!

131
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:29,041
And many of us are close to
our limits, including me, too.

132
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,250
Once the elite team
gets through,

133
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,750
we'll have no more
business here.

134
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:40,041
The rest of us will desert
this place by then, as well.

135
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:43,708
Even we can handle a mission
where all we have to do is run,

136
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,208
so please go!

137
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,791
But Ze...

138
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,375
[YUAN] That's bravado.

139
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:51,500
[YUAN] Escaping an enemy
formation like this is not easy.

140
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:54,416
But since it's Xin's
former commander telling him,

141
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,958
now Xin can go! Free!

142
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,875
[XIN]
Squads who can still run...

143
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,666
Pei Lang! Tian Yong!

144
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,958
Squads who can still fight...

145
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,916
Zhong Tie! Qu Hai!
Long You! Bang!

146
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,541
Squads who aren't
out of energy yet!

147
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:13,708
Tian You! Long Chuan!
Wei Ping! Wei Dao!

148
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,708
Bring whichever of
your men who can fight

149
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:17,791
and come with me immediately!

150
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,166
You want to split up
the squadron then?

151
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,000
[WEI DAO] It's the right call.
It's our only choice!

152
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,833
[XIN] Qiang Lei!
Where is Qiang Lei?!

153
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:27,916
[XIN] Yuan!

154
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,291
[YUAN] Sir!

155
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:32,541
No matter what, once
we're gone, you get away clean!

156
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,708
We will meet up again later!

157
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:37,333
And you'll see Feng Ji's face!

158
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:38,666
Good fortune!

159
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,791
You, too.

160
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,333
Here we go!

161
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,958
[ELITE GUARD 28A] You're not
going anywhere, you Qin dogs!

162
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,000
Oh, yes they are!

163
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:49,250
[SHAN HE] You guys better bring
us the general's head here!

164
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,000
[PEI LANG] You bet we will!

165
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,291
[ELITE GUARD 28B] Captain!

166
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:58,250
Feng Ji!

167
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,875
[WANG YI] Just as sword-fighting
is a matter of distances,

168
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,458
so is command.

169
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:07,041
Each commander specializes in
a particular fighting distance.

170
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,375
Within that range,
the commander's talents

171
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,250
are displayed to their fullest.

172
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:14,208
Feng Ji's specialty is
mid to long-range battle,

173
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,833
is it not?

174
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,125
[TENG] It appears so, Sir.

175
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:21,333
Yes. That battle is
outside of his range.

176
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,083
Am I correct in saying so?

177
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,166
[chuckles]

178
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,666
Yes. It's too close.

179
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,375
I am counting
on you, young Xin--

180
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,000
My flying arrow.

181
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,083
[FENG JI] What of the
squadron that attacked us?

182
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,500
[FENG JI'S LIEUTENANT]
We're still engaging them, Sir,

183
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:42,916
but I see half their
original number now.

184
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,291
It's over now.

185
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,958
Yes, Sir.

186
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:00,875
[XIN] So that's the
general's camp, huh?

187
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,625
[FENG JI'S LIEUTENANT]
I-Impossible!

188
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,666
Was the elite guard
breached or what?!

189
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,875
No, they're engaged
with the enemy!

190
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,875
[FENG JI'S LIEUTENANT]
What does this mean?!

191
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:27,541
[FENG JI] I see they divided
their squadron in two

192
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:31,750
and sacrificed half
their men's lives to come here.

193
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,166
It's his camp.

194
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,625
We finally made it here!

195
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:36,791
Time for murder.

196
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:39,083
Qiang Lei,
how many are there?

197
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,625
Two or three hundred.

198
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,666
Thirty against three hundred?

199
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,875
[PEI LANG] Don't worry.

200
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:46,708
150 of them are
between us and Feng Ji,

201
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,083
lined up in ten
fifteen-man ranks.

202
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,583
If we fight our way
ten men deep,

203
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,500
we have the general's head.

204
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,791
All right!
We can handle that!

205
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,000
Yeah!

206
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,666
[XIN] Okay.
Hold out Yuan and the others.

207
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,625
And say your prayers, Feng Ji!

208
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,458
Here we go, everyone!

209
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:06,041
General Wang Yi said
this was the first stage's

210
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,875
most critical fight!

211
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:12,458
We're gonna end
this one personally!

212
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:13,958
[FENG JI'S LIEUTENANT]
They're charging.

213
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,583
Do they really think they
can make it all the way here?

214
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:19,416
Or do they just want to die
in a blaze of glory?

215
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,875
They'll make it.

216
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,083
[FENG JI'S LIEUTENANT] Sir?

217
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,666
I said they'll
make it over here.

218
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,416
[SHOU] I can't believe
they'd come at our main camp

219
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,583
with only thirty men!

220
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:31,833
[SHOU] Infantry men, ready!

221
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:35,583
They're late for their date
with death, so kill them!

222
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,083
[FENG JI] There are times,
though, few and far between,

223
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:42,166
when in war, people
have superhuman strength.

224
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,291
The more theoretical a general,

225
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,958
the easier it can be
for such things to throw him.

226
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,333
[FENG JI'S LIEUTENANT]
Huh?

227
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:49,958
[FENG JI] This is the
first time an enemy has ever

228
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,875
closed in on me to this degree.

229
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:56,291
But the occasional battle like
this makes for a nice change.

230
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,041
[ZHAO SOLDIER 28I]
What are you doing?!

231
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,041
Don't let them through!

232
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,083
[ZHAO SOLDIER 28J] Stop them!

233
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,416
Out of my way!

234
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,250
I'll send them straight
to hell myself right now!

235
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,750
[ZHAO SOLIDER 28I] Lord Shou!

236
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:16,416
[yelling]

237
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,625
[SHOU] You little brat!

238
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,625
[FENG JI'S LIEUTENANT] Zhao Jue
and Gao Force to the front!

239
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:26,791
You have a cavalry!

240
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:29,083
Why can't you stop
a measly thirty people?!

241
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,166
Take them down now!

242
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,375
They may be a
mere few dozen men,

243
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,250
but riding that much momentum,

244
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:38,375
they're unstoppable now,
aren't they?

245
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,791
Feng Ji's camp,
primarily cavalry,

246
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,833
is working against him, too.

247
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,666
[WANG YI] A cavalry's
strength is in motion.

248
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,416
When densely
packed in and still,

249
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,375
it displays
no power whatsoever.

250
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:54,458
Will Feng Ji the
tactician devise a plan,

251
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:55,791
now, you think?

252
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,041
I doubt it.

253
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,875
Cornered at such close range,

254
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,833
one doesn't have time
to devise any plans.

255
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:05,000
[WANG YI]
Especially not Feng Ji.

256
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:09,458
Yes, he showed brilliant skill
in halving Qin's left force,

257
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,875
but at the cost of letting
the Fei Xin Force

258
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:14,791
get deep into his territory.

259
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,583
[WANG YI] For Feng Ji who is
inexpert at close-range battle,

260
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,958
that failure to notice
the Fei Xin Force

261
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,958
did irreparable damage.

262
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,791
Are we nearing
checkmate then, Sir?

263
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,958
[WANG YI]
Interesting question...

264
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:33,000
[WANG YI]
There is one way Feng Ji

265
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,958
can still recover
from this mess.

266
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,208
[XIN] Okay, we're through!

267
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,458
We're through!
We're... through?

268
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:52,916
[WANG YI] The one and only way
Feng Ji can possibly recover...

269
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:58,125
[WANG YI] ...is to
regain his distance.

270
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,416
[WEI PING]
You... You're kidding...

271
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:10,291
H-He's supposed to be a general,
and he's got 150 men...

272
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,666
But he's running away
from thirty of us?!

273
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,916
How does that make sense?

274
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,750
Stop now. This is enough.

275
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,375
[FENG JI'S LIEUTENANT]
Halt, men!

276
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:24,958
[WANG YI] Well played.

277
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:30,083
In one move, young Xin
is cast into the jaws of death.

278
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:32,708
If he deploys cavalry
from that distance,

279
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:35,291
our foot soldiers
will then be helpless.

280
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,291
[WANG YI] Yes, quite...

281
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,166
[laughs]

282
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,500
It's bad! They're coming
from front and back!

283
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:50,083
[TIAN YOU] What? Now?

284
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,125
[XIN] Damn, we're totally stuck.

285
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,041
We gotta get out quick...

286
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,583
But...

287
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:59,583
[XIN] Maybe Qiang Lei and I
could manage somehow, but...

288
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:03,250
[XIN] ...these guys can't!

289
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,166
G-Go then, Xin.

290
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:18,958
You and Qiang Lei could
get through, maybe... so...

291
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:19,791
Go!

292
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:20,833
What are you saying?!

293
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,208
If you keep
kidding around, I'll--

294
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,291
I'm not kidding!

295
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,625
I'm telling you to go,
you stupid jerk!

296
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:28,333
You know you
can't die here with us!

297
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:31,750
You're gonna be the world's
greatest general, aren't you?!

298
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:36,833
[XIN] Forget it.

299
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:42,000
Xin! If you stay,
it's all over! Get going!

300
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,208
How can I?

301
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm sorry, Qiang Lei.

302
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,958
Don't apologize.

303
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,333
It is not over yet.

304
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:00,375
Wh-What's that?!

305
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:03,000
General Feng Ji! Straight ahead!

306
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,458
[WEI PING]
It's our left force...

307
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:15,083
Our cavalry is coming through
Zhao's defensive wall!

308
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:18,333
[ZHONG TIE] Forty... fifty...

309
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:19,791
More keep coming!

310
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,000
It's Gan Yang!

311
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,875
You know him?

312
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,416
[XIN] He's one of General
Wang Yi's inner circles.

313
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,708
I bet he's the
left force's commander!

314
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:32,541
We've come for
your head, Feng Ji.

315
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:35,041
What impudence.

316
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,125
Call half the right flank!

317
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:43,958
[SOLDIERS yelling]

318
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:45,916
What is it now?!

319
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,583
Support Gan Yang's unit!

320
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:52,541
Keep the enemy infantry away
from them and from Feng Ji!

321
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,333
Even my man Bi...

322
00:17:57,416 --> 00:18:00,541
[GAN YANG] All troops charge!

323
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,291
They broke through at last.

324
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,541
[WANG YI chuckling]

325
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:10,875
We're all going, too!

326
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:13,291
[yelling]

327
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,916
It turned out just like
the general said, Xin!

328
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,333
He told us at the start, when
the left force fought the enemy!

329
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:27,583
He said to benefit from the
confusion to get Feng Ji's head!

330
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,583
[WEI DAO]
This is the moment he meant!

331
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,625
Don't match
your speed to ours!

332
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:35,583
Just ride at full speed
and then just go get his head!

333
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,166
Wei Dao...

334
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:41,541
[WEI DAO] Get moving! You have
to be the one to take it, Xin!

335
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,416
Got it.

336
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,625
His head will be mine!

337
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:51,333
[XIN] But listen up, you guys!

338
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:52,500
I will get the credit,

339
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:55,000
but we will all be
splitting the reward!

340
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,916
Alive or dead,
all one hundred of us here

341
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,666
get the exact same cut!

342
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:05,791
Go then!

343
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:09,250
[yelling]

344
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:13,875
[QIANG LEI] Xin.

345
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,375
[XIN] What?

346
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,250
When we're close to the general,
go for the small opening.

347
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:21,750
There will be a chance.
Don't let it pass by.

348
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:23,583
Yeah, I know.

349
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,708
[QIANG LEI]
"Comrades", huh?

350
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,458
[FENG JI] Why does the
general of their left force

351
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,083
look so triumphant?

352
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,416
Does he think
he's cornered me?

353
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,500
My strategies are flawless.

354
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:41,500
Still, there will be a slight
margin of error,

355
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:45,125
even in the most
flawless plan.

356
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,958
[FENG JI]
That's the nature of warfare.

357
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,791
They simply got lucky
in that those tiny errors

358
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,000
stacked up to their advantage.

359
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,583
[FENG JI] Lucky?

360
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:59,500
No, it's too hard to swallow.

361
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:02,333
Would I allow enemies to get
within striking distance

362
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,791
by sheer luck?

363
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:08,000
Does this mean there was
a fault in my strategy?

364
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,250
[FENG JI] It's him.

365
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,791
That little unit that
attacked from the side--

366
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,833
They broke my camp.

367
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,208
[FENG JI] But in a war strategy
with thousands fighting

368
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:21,416
on each side,

369
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,708
a steady advance by
a hundred-man squadron

370
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:26,333
falls within
the margin of error.

371
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,500
It was coincidence that
let them reach my camp

372
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,958
in the first place.

373
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:34,833
If I hadn't advanced both flanks
to wipe out Qin's left force,

374
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,791
they could have
never made it in.

375
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,041
[gasps]

376
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,583
[FENG JI] Was the squadron
sent after me

377
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:45,166
because both flanks
would advance?

378
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:49,083
I was manipulated
into advancing them?!

379
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,375
That man ordered
10,000 of his troops

380
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,166
to charge me
just so I would do it!

381
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,500
[FENG JI] The squadron's
charge wasn't a coincidence.

382
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:03,333
I played into his hands
with my very first move!

383
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:06,083
Feng Ji's love of strategy
was his downfall,

384
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,500
wasn't it, Sir?

385
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:08,708
He wasn't attentive enough

386
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:11,750
to carry off truly
magnificent moves.

387
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:14,041
Feng Ji loves to dominate.

388
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:18,041
But one must give thought
to the opposite role, too.

389
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,916
[TENG] The way you
manipulated that arena

390
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,750
without taking command
was genius, Sir.

391
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,291
[WANG YI chuckles]

392
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:28,750
Well I'm surprisingly fond of
long-range battles myself,

393
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,875
as you can see.

394
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,000
I'm pulling back!

395
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,250
General?!

396
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,375
I don't care
for their removal.

397
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:43,625
You join the defensive wall
and clean this yourselves.

398
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,375
I'm taking the
soldiers in the rear

399
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:48,208
and withdrawing
to the woods for now.

400
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:48,916
Yes, Sir!

401
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,375
It's over now, Feng Ji!

402
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:58,833
You'll need a lot more
practice before you show off

403
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:00,958
your schemes to my master.

404
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:02,208
Ridiculous!

405
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:04,583
You're the ones done in
by your own scheming!

406
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:07,666
The fact that only few
of you made it here is proof!

407
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,500
[FENG JI] I'll kill you,
kill all your survivors,

408
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:13,708
and consign your entire
left force to hell!

409
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,875
No, I don't think
you will be able to.

410
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:18,250
Your time's up.

411
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,333
No, your time has run out!

412
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,583
Kill that man right now!

413
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:24,250
Feng Ji.

414
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,750
My master's flying arrow...

415
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:33,166
...is about to strike home.

416
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:46,041
[yelling]

417
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,500
[gasping]

418
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:17,791
[SOLDIERS cheering]

419
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:21,333
[XIN] I... I got him...

420
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:55,833
[DIAO] Li Bai's men
are changing formations!

421
00:24:55,916 --> 00:24:57,958
[NARRATOR] All is now in place.

422
00:24:58,041 --> 00:25:01,416
The strongest man
shall devour the battlefield!

423
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,125
Next Time: "The Tides
Of War Suddenly Turn."
