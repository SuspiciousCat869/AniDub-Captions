1
00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:12,041
[XIN]
What's to be glad about?

2
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:16,416
You, and you, and you,
with all your carrying on!

3
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:20,666
Listen, old man!

4
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:25,791
Piao is... Piao is...

5
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:29,166
Piao is now dead!

6
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:42,166
Hey! Say something!

7
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:49,125
[LORD CHANGWEN]
Piao isn't the only one.

8
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:55,416
A many great others died. This
is a war. Lives will be lost.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,708
[XIN growls]
What did you say?!

10
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:03,041
I've had enough
of your nonsense!

11
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:04,500
[DIAO gasps]
Oh no...

12
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:06,875
[XIN]
You bastard!

13
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:18,333
I regret the commotion,
Your Highness.

14
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,666
[BI] What shall we do
with this person?

15
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:28,500
[LORD CHANGWEN] Let him lie
somewhere out of the way.

16
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:29,875
[BI]
Yes, sir.

17
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:32,416
[NARRATOR]
Ancient China...

18
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,166
The time of the sages was over,
swept away by base human greed.

19
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,125
Over five centuries,
an endless storm

20
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:41,541
of war, hatred, and strife
raged across the land.

21
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:43,291
Over a hundred nations fell,

22
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:46,166
winnowed away until
only seven remained.

23
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,583
Now, from Qin,
the westernmost kingdom,

24
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:51,083
a great wind of history
is about to blow.

25
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:53,625
This is the tale of a
nameless boy and a young King

26
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:57,166
who ran the gauntlet
in this age of strife.

27
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,666
[DIAO]
Kept you waiting. Here it is!

28
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:48,958
If it's good, say "yum,"
or if it's bad say "yuck."

29
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:52,125
At least say that much.

30
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:55,416
Guess it's not
that kind of a mood.

31
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,333
[SOLDIER 6]
That was a hideous fight.

32
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,916
[SOLDIER 6B] Never imagined
things getting that bad.

33
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,041
[SOLDIERS]
Yeah.

34
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,583
[SOLDIER 6C]
Our master, Lord Changwen,

35
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:07,083
has had a rough time of it, too.

36
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,541
Lord Changwen?!

37
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:13,250
Diao you, just said
"Lord Changwen," huh?!

38
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,208
Huh? That wasn't me!

39
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:18,291
That bastard. Where did he go?

40
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,541
Ow! Ouch, ouch!

41
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:21,833
That son of a-- 

42
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:24,125
Settle down!
You shouldn't be moving!

43
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:27,958
Though, you are not the
only one who cannot move,

44
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,166
I'll have you know.

45
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:36,708
[DIAO] All these soldiers
came here for Zheng.

46
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,583
I'm just truly glad.

47
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:41,083
Absolutely. What really
matters is that

48
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,750
His Highness is safe.

49
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:45,083
Did you see
Lord Changwen's face?

50
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:48,333
I have never seen him
shed a tear before this.

51
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:52,541
I'm so glad I risked my life
to get all the way here.

52
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:59,916
[BI] In this escape drama,
our biggest slip-up

53
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,375
concerned General
Wang Yi's appearance.

54
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:07,291
We simply didn't anticipate
that he would show up.

55
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,541
Taking his personality
into account,

56
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:12,041
we presumed him being
completely uninterested

57
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,458
in the Court's power struggles.

58
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,250
[LORD CHANGWEN] On that day,
I may have foolishly played

59
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:22,125
right into Wang Yi's
entire scheme.

60
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,458
[ZHENG]
Scheme?

61
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:26,791
Yes. In the middle
of that brutal battle,

62
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:31,458
our combat somehow drove us
all the way up to Shu Da Hill.

63
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,875
[LORD CHANGWEN]
And there...

64
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,916
[LORD CHANGWEN]
What the...

65
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:54,250
[LORD CHANGWEN screams]

66
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:09,250
[LORD CHANGWEN] In this way, I
pulled myself from Death's jaws,

67
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:12,666
but I'd been forced to
leave the battlefield.

68
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:21,958
A blunder... But now,
as I think about it

69
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:26,458
why was I able to hold my own
that long, solo against Wang Yi?

70
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:29,291
With the prowess
that he possesses,

71
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,208
he could've sliced
the likes of me in two

72
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:34,916
without breaking a sweat.
That was clearly a scheme of his

73
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,833
to draw me away
from the battlefield.

74
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:41,916
Wang Yi has many riddles,
the Kingdom of Qin's

75
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,125
mysterious bird, who flies by
his very own, strange callings.

76
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:51,916
A legendary general,
who served my grandfather,

77
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,666
the great King Zhao.

78
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,000
[door creaks]

79
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,791
[DIAO] Um... I thought
that you'd be hungry.

80
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,875
Thank you for that, Diao.

81
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,166
[LORD CHANGWEN]
Your Highness, who is this?

82
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:08,041
[ZHENG] He's He Liao Diao.
He saved my life at Heibei.

83
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:09,833
[LORD CHANGWEN]
Is that so?

84
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:14,458
And yet you dress in an awfully
unique outfit, little one.

85
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,583
[DIAO] Because I'm of
the mountain folk.

86
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,083
Really?

87
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,708
In which case you have a true
connection to this place,

88
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,166
isn't that right?

89
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,875
Maybe.

90
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:28,208
Your Highness, may I speak now?

91
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,708
What is it?

92
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:33,250
[BI] This means you also met
the other at Heibei Village?

93
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:36,375
That's right. His name is Xin.

94
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:39,625
It's thanks to him
that I'm here today.

95
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:43,208
Xin was also
a friend of Piao's.

96
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:46,083
He was... Was Lord Piao's...?

97
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,583
[DIAO]
Lord Piao?

98
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,125
[BI]
Excuse me, your Highness.

99
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:54,000
If I may have your permission,
I would tell that young man

100
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:57,375
of Lord Piao's demise.

101
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:00,583
[DIAO]
Xin! Hey, Xin!

102
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,291
Zheng's calling for you.

103
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:05,208
Says he wants you to
hear something important.

104
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:11,083
[DIAO] What's with you?
Zheng's calling you!

105
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,916
Are you feeling down, Xin?

106
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,458
Shut up with your jabbering!
So what if Zheng's calling?

107
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,666
Can't you see I'm
thinking right now?!

108
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,750
He can come here if
he wants something!

109
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,625
Who the heck's Zheng?

110
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:28,083
Do we even have a Zheng?

111
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,333
[SOLDIERS]
Zheng?!

112
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,583
You can't possibly
mean His Highness?!

113
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:32,375
[XIN]
Yep.

114
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,750
Who do you think you are?!

115
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:38,541
To utter the High King's name
is an inexcusable offense!

116
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,583
But Zheng said it was all right!

117
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,500
You're still gonna say it?!

118
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:45,875
The King is calling
for you, Xin.

119
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,666
Hurry up! Bi says he has
something to tell you.

120
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,958
[XIN]
Oh, so what?

121
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:55,083
It's about Piao's last moments.

122
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,458
Oh. I see.

123
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,250
Hey, wait for me!

124
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:13,750
[DIAO] The blowgun...
Where are the darts?

125
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,541
[DIAO]
Ah, there he is!

126
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:30,458
[DIAO] I'm used to seeing
corpses in the village,

127
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,416
but touching one's nasty!

128
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,833
Where are they?

129
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,333
Not there, nope.

130
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:36,958
[DIAO screams]
The undead!

131
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:40,416
[MU TA]
Do not make a fuss, now.

132
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,166
If they hear that I'm alive,

133
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,041
they will finish me
off most definitely.

134
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,875
[DIAO] What, old guy?
You're still alive?

135
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:51,458
Mu Ta's life force is
powerfully fearsome.

136
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:54,750
This is what I would like to
say, but I will be dead soon.

137
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:58,083
So please keep it
hush-hush, understand?

138
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,416
[DIAO] Well I'll hush,
but in return give me

139
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,041
some poison darts.

140
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:05,541
You want Mu Ta's poison darts?

141
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:08,583
Yeah. I wanna be... formidable.

142
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:33,041
[XIN]
So you are Bi?

143
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,625
[BI]
Yes I am Bi,

144
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,666
Lord Changwen's
retainer and lieutenant.

145
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:41,875
I heard you have something
to say about Piao.

146
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:46,958
Correct. I would very much like
for you to know of this story.

147
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,791
[XIN gasps]

148
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,041
[BI]
My lord!

149
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,541
[PERSONAL GUARDSMAN]
Lieutenant Bi! What orders?

150
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,250
Defend the carriage!

151
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,583
Even if it means
being cut to pieces--

152
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,958
Defend that carriage!

153
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:14,166
[BI] Only two knew about the
stand-in: Lord Changwen and me.

154
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,916
To make this ploy succeed,

155
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,541
I raised my voice and strove
to rouse up the troops.

156
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:27,458
But Wang Yi's force...
was simply too strong.

157
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:30,166

to break, and the carriage

Lieutenant Bi! The carriage!

162
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:47,416
[BI] It was over.
We would be annihilated.

163
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,333
I gave up all hope.
But just then...

164
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:02,375
Don't give in!
Re-form your lines!

165

We'll tighten the ranks
and break through!

We'd abandoned all hope, 

170
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,416
but our will to
fight was rekindled

171
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,000
by Piao's strong words.

172
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:23,333
I truly couldn't believe
it that before us

173
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:26,375
was Wang Yi's force
feared in every land,

174
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,875
while the one who
led us, unflinching,

175
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:32,291
was a boy of unknown
name of low station.

[BI gasps]
It's Piao...

177
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:44,208
[BI] But his bearing
was that of a king.

178
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:53,041
[BI] With this momentum,
we could break through--

179

I was certain of it.

180

From the looks of it,
it won't be so simple.

and that we'd meet again here...

Such a bitter mischance...

204
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,875
Hey Zheng, there's just
one thing I want to ask.

205
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:52,458
I'm simple-minded so,
explain it in definite terms.

206
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,500
[ZHENG]
What's that?

207
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:57,375
If I get you back
safely onto your throne,

208
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:00,250
what will you do
for me in return?

209
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,916
Since you're the King,
will you grant me

210
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,666
anything I desire?

211
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,666
My wish is to become a general.

212
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,875
Will you grant me
this one wish, then?

213
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:15,166
What suddenly brought this?

214
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,833
I always knew, Piao was special.

215
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:21,458
Seeing Bi, my man here,
talk about him

216
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:24,583
as if he was a hero
just reaffirms it.

217
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,291
[XIN] He always knew
since we were kids...

218
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:34,333
He knew what it took
to win the prize.

219
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:41,500
[XIN]
But I didn't know anything.

220
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,583
He knew it all,
so I always thought

221
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:46,500
I could just stick with him.

222
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:50,708
But Piao's not here
anymore, as you know.

223
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:54,000
Nothing makes sense to me now.

224
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:56,500
So why not just
explain it to me?

225
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:57,666
In definite terms,

226
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,416
how can someone like me
become a general?

230

[MU TA]
For keeping this hush-hush,

233
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:21,333
I am going to give you
a piece of advice.

234
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,500
Going with that
young King won't lead

235
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,500
to anything good at all.

236
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:29,083
From what I understand,
he has only one ally:

237
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,916
that old grizzle-beard.

238
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,375
[DIAO]
At the moment.

239
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,625
But I hear he's got a powerful
ally named Lü Buwei.

240
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:39,083
Apparently he's away
campaigning, though.

241
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:43,208
[MU TA] Unfortunately,
you are very badly mistaken.

242
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,666
[DIAO]
Huh?

243
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:52,541
[ZHENG] This kingdom now works
on a system based on merit.

244
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:55,333
The era of nobles and
warriors being generals

245
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:58,750
by virtue of being born
into a caste is now over.

246
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:02,250
Whoever goes to the battlefield
and accomplishes greater deeds

247
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,791
will rise to the
rank of general.

248
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,750
Piao used to say the
same thing, so I know that.

249
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:11,250
I want you to
explain the specifics!

250
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,666
Unfortunately for you,
it's impossible.

251
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:17,625
Say what?! What
exactly do you mean?

252
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:20,750
The army as it is, is mainly
made up with a group

253
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,541
of regulars of the
noble or warrior caste

254
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,666
and levies recruited
from the common folk.

255
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,583
But at present, you cannot
join the regulars,

256
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,625
or even the levies.

257
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,083
Eh?

258
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:36,583
[LORD CHANGWEN] You really
don't know anything, do you?

259
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:40,041
The levies are raised
from registered households

260
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,208
and only from
those houses owning

261
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,083
a minimum level of wealth.

262
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:47,541
But for you, without a
home to live in,

263
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,208
it's not a matter
of skill at arms.

264
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:52,125
You can't even step
onto the battlefield.

265
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,208
Don't be so disheartened.

266
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:58,041
General isn't a rank that
even a warrior or a noble

267
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,708
can easily set his sights on.

268
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:06,375
[XIN]
Uh-huh. I get it.

269
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,083
[LORD CHANGWEN]
You understand?

270
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,875
Uh-huh. I get it.

271
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:17,250
So we get Zheng
back to the Palace,

272
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,666
and after we take down his
brother, what's-his-name,

273
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,541
and this minister,
what's-his-name, 

274
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:25,041
I just need to be given land,
have a house built for me,

275
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,708
and gain some wealth!

276
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:31,541
That is the situation.

277
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,750
That's an agreement!

278
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,541
We are agreed.

279
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:38,958
Hey, now things have
gotten interesting!

280
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,333
[ZHENG] In return, you'll work
ten times harder for me.

Are you kidding? 100 times!

Zheng! Is it true what I heard?

283
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:51,166
That Lü's army won't return
until you've been killed?

284
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,375
[SOLDIER 6J]

285
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,041
from the capital...

Again with news of
Jie Shi's revolt.

287

Cut his head off.

288

[SOLDIER 6J]
Sir?

289
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,458
[LÜ BUWEI] It's a ploy
by the army of Wei,

290
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:27,625
seeking to free itself from
my army's encirclement.

291
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,041
Cut off the messenger's head.

292
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:36,541
[BI] Lü won't return? Even
knowing of Jie Shi's uprising?

293
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,916
That's outrageous!

294
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,833
Lü would suffer more
than anyone else

295
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:43,083
at the loss of His Highness!

296
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,708
Well, Bi, you do
not yet understand

297
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:50,833
the true fearsomeness that
Minister Lü possesses.

298
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,583
[XIN] What on earth
does this mean, Zheng?

299
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,958
Lü is waiting for
me to be slain,

300
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:04,750
and for Cheng Jiao to
ascend to the throne.

301
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:07,583
Lü would seize the
opportunity to loudly decry

302
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,208
the tyranny of Cheng Jiao
and Jie Shi,

303
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,625
and storm Xianyang
magnificently,

304
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:15,541
leading 200,000 troops.

305
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,000
The royal family
may lose their lives

306
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:21,833
in the chaos of the
battleground in Xianyang.

307
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:26,166
[ZHENG] With the whole
royal family eliminated,

308
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,875
who do you think the people
would raise up as their King?

309
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,208
Lü Buwei?!

310
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:40,875
What did you say?!
You're kidding me!

311
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:43,916
Lü Buwei isn't your ally
like I thought?

312
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
This means, you've got nothing
but enemies in the Court!

313
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,541
That's why I told you...

314
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:57,916
I am a, powerless king walking
in the cruel wilderness of war.

315
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,666
B-But there's some
way to do this, right?

316
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,625
C'mon, Lord Changwen!

317
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,458
It's regrettable,

318
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,750
but with our present
level of strength,

319
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:14,000
we cannot even manage
getting near the capital.

320
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:17,666
We can only watch
Lü's and Jie Shi's moves

321
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:22,416
and seek an opportunity
to regain power.

322
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,958
[ZHENG]
No, Lord Changwen.

323
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:30,458
I will return to the capital
as soon as possible.

324
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:33,583
But, Your Highness--!

325
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:35,250
[ZHENG]
Whether I'm alive or dead,

326
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:39,125
once Jie Shi is prepared for
all-out war with Lü Buwei, 

327
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:43,250
he'll force Cheng Jiao
onto the throne.

328
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,750
Lü and Jie Shi's struggle

329
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:48,291
would be of a scale to
split the kingdom in two.

330
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,500
Before they spark a civil war,

331
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,458
I must attain the Jeweled Throne

332
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:55,208
and restore normalcy
to the capital.

333
00:21:57,375 --> 00:22:00,166
It... It's impossible,
Your Highness!

334
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:03,333
Our strength is quite feeble.

335
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:06,041
What's more, there's now
no force in Qin

336
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,500
not bound to Lü or to
Jie Shi that would even

337
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:10,416
consider aiding us!

338
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:14,333
Do you think so, Xin?

339
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,958
Can you suggest some
way to do this, Zheng?

340
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,708
Hey, that blowgun! That's
that old guy's, right?

341
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:25,791
[DIAO] What about it?
He gave it to me!

342
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,250
[XIN]
Let me see it!

343
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:29,500
[DIAO grunts]
No! It's mine!

344
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:31,833
[XIN] I won't take it.
I said let me see!

345
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:34,125
[DIAO]
No! He gave it to me!

346
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,875
[LORD CHANGWEN]
There is...

347
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,250
My lord, did you say something?

348
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:47,125
There is one large
force that is not bound

349
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:50,916
to either Lü or to Jie Shi.

350
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,250
I have been thinking
of that ever since

351
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:54,833
we first arrived here.

352
00:22:57,791 --> 00:22:59,875
[LORD CHANGWEN]
But 400 years ago,

353
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:02,791
the connection with them was...

354
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:04,583
[ZHENG]
The likelihood is small.

355
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,875
We can only go to meet them...

356
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:10,958
[ZHENG]
The mountain folk...

357
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,541
[ZHENG] ...and the
mountain king who rules them.

358
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:54,250
[BI]
I see.

359
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:56,916
You don't know the tale of
the "Horse &amp; Liquor Force".

360
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,041
[NARRATOR] Xin and his
companions shudder in fear.

361
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:00,666
Is it those berserk folk,

362
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,750
creeping through the
unfathomable dark?

363
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:05,458
Next time: The Fearsome
Folk of the Mountains
