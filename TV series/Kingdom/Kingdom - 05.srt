1
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:14,833
Xin, who is this guy?

2
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:16,666
Keep quiet.

3
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:23,416
[MU TA] You'd be the one who cut
down that hooded assassin, yes?

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,541
And so, what is it to you?

5
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:28,083
I won't kill you the easy way.

6
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:31,458
Just prepare yourself,
little fella.

7
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:37,958
You're probably angry
your friend got killed,

8
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:39,000
but give it up.

9
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:41,416
An old guy like you
can't beat me.

10
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,041
Qin people just do not
understand anything at all.

11
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:48,916
But even among them, your
stupidity truly stands out.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,333
First, the Vermilion Slayer
wasn't my friend.

13
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:55,666
Also, killing one of your kind

14
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:00,333
is actually incredibly easy
and simple for me, Mu Ta.

15
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:05,125
[MU TA]
For example, like this...

16
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:14,333
[XIN]
What's that?!

17
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:16,958
[NARRATOR]
Ancient China...

18
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:23,416
The time of the sages was over,
swept away by base human greed.

19
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,916
A storm of war and
strife had been raging

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,250
across the entirety of China

21
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:33,000
over the unthinkable
span of five centuries.

22
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:37,958
Desire. Pleasure.
Suffering. Terror.

23
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:41,458
Unmistakably in this
world rife with cruelty

24
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:43,708
lived a dragon...

25
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:46,500
...a dragon named "the era."

26
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:53,541
Scorched by that
dragon's flames,

27
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:57,166
more than 100 nations fell,
one after another,

28
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,791
winnowed away, into seven
that now remained.

29
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,875
These were Yan, Qi, Zhao,

30
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:08,791
Wei, Han, Chu...

31
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:10,458
...and Qin.

32
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,958
These 7 large kingdoms,

33
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:16,833
as though each was trying
to devour the others,

34
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:19,458
lunged at their enemies'
throats again and again

35
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,583
with ambition-fueled swords.

36
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:25,333
This was the era of the Spring
and Autumn Warring States.

37
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:28,083
Now from Qin,
the westernmost kingdom,

38
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:31,791
the great wind of history
is about to blow.

39
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:35,208
This is the tale of a
nameless boy and a young King

40
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:39,291
who ran the gauntlet
in this age of strife.

41
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:26,291
[XIN panting]

42
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:29,916
Hm, you have a real
talent for combat.

43
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,875
Your body's
responding instinctively

44
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:33,333
to Mu Ta's poison darts.

45
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:36,000
Poison darts?

46
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,583
But you can relax, young fellow.

47
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:41,875
Since you killed the Vermilion
Slayer, I won't use a blow-dart.

48
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,375
[XIN]
What?

49
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:46,375
[MU TA] That Vermilion Slayer
upset me before, you see.

50
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:49,750
He insulted Mu Ta, and called
my blow-darts "cowardly."

51
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:53,416
He didn't seem to
recognize Mu Ta's ability.

52
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,333
Blow-darts are the ultimate
weapon of my people,

53
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,583
"the Basha of Yue."

54
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,750
But Qin people are stupid

55
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:06,500
and don't understand that,
and I can't help that.

56
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:13,500
[MU TA] I'll show you
strength without a blow-dart.

57
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:16,041
I'll shred you, who was
somewhat strong

58
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:19,125
than the Vermilion Slayer
you killed...

59
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,416
...with these axes,
and show Mu Ta's might

60
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,708
to Qin fools who don't
get my sheer prowess!

61
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:32,333
[XIN]
He's fast!

62
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,333
Xin!

63
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,250
[MU TA yells]

64
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,750
[XIN]
But not faster than me!

65
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:40,708
Huh?

66
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,083
[XIN gasps]

67
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:46,625
Xin!

68
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,875
Damn you...

69
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:02,750
[MU TA] You dodged Mu Ta's
attack and wounded me.

70
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,875
I find that quite surprising.

71
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,083
As a great warrior
of the Basha,

72
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,791
I can't let this
stand whatsoever.

73
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,958
With the pride of the
Basha as a whole at stake,

74
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,583
I'll spill out your
innards, little fella,

75
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,500
and I will kill you.

76
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:23,083
[XIN]
Try it, man with square head!

77
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,458
Foolish brat!

78
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:28,708
[DIAO gasps]

79
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:33,250
All three of the little
heads I seek right here...

80
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,916
Zheng! Pursuit's here!

81
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,416
A killer of Cheng Jiao.

82
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,500
Why the heck are you
just standing here?

83
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:45,041
Hurry and go stand by Xin,
or he's gonna be killed!

84
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,666
Do you need a hand?

85
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:50,000
[XIN grunts]
Nope! Not a chance.

86
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,041
Just hold on a sec!

87
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:55,250
That old man's extremely
good, understand?

88
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:58,333
I know that. I was watching.

89
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:01,083
But if he can't win this
fight even with nine lives,

90
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:04,041
it won't be enough for
what's coming. Xin!

91
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:11,750
That's easy to say, but...
he is really scary.

92
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,125
[DIAO screams]
Wait!

93
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:17,791
Does "three little heads"
include me? M-M-My head!

94
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,041
You three...

95
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:22,625
Are you making fun of
Mu Ta behind my back?

96
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,000
That upsets me.

97
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,125
[XIN growls]

98
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:31,416
[MU TA yells]

99
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:42,291
The brat has good eyes.

100
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:47,125
[XIN] What is this?!
Crap, I can't see!

101
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,000
[MU TA]
You're mine.

102
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:56,875
[XIN yells]

103
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,291
Xin!

104
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,583
[XIN yells]

105
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,333
What a shocker.

106
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,958
So he managed to block
it with his sword...

107
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:18,250
Oww...

108
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,750
Feeling weak?

109
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,958
[DIAO]
Huh? Something's strange...

110
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:36,083
Like Xin's... lost his edge.

111
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:39,958
He looks smaller than when he
fought the Vermilion Slayer.

112
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:50,000
This has grown quite
tiresome for Mu Ta.

113
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,291
Die!

114
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:57,625
Don't back off, Xin!!

115
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,208
[XIN gasps]

116
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:03,083
[XIN]
Back off? You're saying...

117
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,416
...I was intimidated? Me?

118
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,333
Your strong nature
is your weapon!

119
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,166
That I know!

120
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,833
[XIN yells]

121
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:23,916
[XIN groans]

122
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:29,958
[DIAO gasps] They're hurt,
but Xin looks different.

123
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:33,583
He's freed from the spell
of Mu Ta's killer instinct.

124
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,875
Now, the real contest begins.

125
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:05,541
[SI SHI] I'm sorry for summoning
you so early in the morning, 

126
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,791
but there's something
that concerns me.

127
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,125
I beg for your understanding.

128
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:21,250
It regards what you
delivered to us last night

129
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:24,250
General Wang Yi;
Lord Changwen's head.

130
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:31,375
[MEN gasp]

131
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,041
With the severity of the wounds,

132
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:36,458
we can't verify that
it is Lord Changwen.

133
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:39,625
I'd request a detailed telling
of how you specifically

134
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,208
engaged with Lord Changwen

135
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:44,416
and how he ended up
in this gruesome state.

136
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,541
--General...
[WANG YI] Mm-hm?

137
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,333
What is it?

138
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:58,000
[WANG YI] Then you must have
major doubts on me, Si Shi?

139
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:01,458
I-I do not doubt you whatsoever.
It is simply my duty

140
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:04,500
to understand the
circumstances, General.

141
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:05,791
[WANG YI]
Mm-hm.

142
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,750
If that's how you put it...

143
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,583
Very well.

144
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:14,916
It's not a particularly
interesting war-story, though.

145
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:53,250
[WANG YI] Please do wait
for us, Lord Changwen.

146
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,958
[LORD CHANGWEN]
I'll hold back Wang Yi.

147
00:11:57,041 --> 00:12:01,041
You men protect
His Highness. Go!

148
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,625
Lord Changwen!

149
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,166
Forgive me, Piao.

150
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,291
[WANG YI]
Why, you've come, Lord Changwen!

151
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:14,208
[LORD CHANGWEN yells]
Wang Yi!

152
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,541
[WANG YI] Riding side-by-side
like this brings back memories,

153
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,708
huh, Lord Changwen?

154
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,500
We're true enemies now.

155
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,625
You think I'll fall
into reminisce?

156
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:42,000
Wang Yi, you were
never interested

157
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:45,083
in the strife between
Lü Buwei and Jie Shi.

158
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,750
Why have you suddenly
got involved?

159
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:48,875
[WANG YI]
Just seeking out a fight

160
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:52,083
that can get my blood all astir.

161
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,041
You're speaking nonsense!

162
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,333
All of you people
would understand.

163
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,291
[WANG YI] Since Qin
fell under the control

164
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:04,541
of Lü Buwei and Jie Shi,
war became horribly dull,

165
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:07,125
and I really miss the days
of King Zhao unbearably,

166
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:08,291
to be honest.

167
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:11,000
You know the feeling,
don't you, huh?

168
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,541
[LORD CHANGWEN]
Certainly in today's battles,

169
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,958
money and goods circulate
behind the scenes,

170
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:20,500
and events often
directly profit Lü Buwei.

171
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,291
But that should have
no bearing upon you

172
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,625
on the battlefield at all.

173
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,291
Oh, how you jest.

174
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,375
Do you think that
sort of cynical warfare

175
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,250
gets my blood boiling?

176
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:34,458
My heart is so incredibly
delicate, you see...

177
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,083
[LORD CHANGWEN]
Are you saying fighting

178
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:39,083
a mere civil servant
like myself does, in fact,

179
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,708
get your blood boiling?

180
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,500
It's possible, you know...

181
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,208
[WANG YI] You were once
known as a warrior

182
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:51,708
who excelled on the field
and had an actual backbone.

183
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:56,333
At a chance to trade
blows with that man...

184
00:13:56,416 --> 00:14:00,333
...one might get
hot-blooded for a change.

185
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,083
[GUARDIAN 5A]
My lord!

186
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,875
[LORD CHANGWEN]
Whoa!

187
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:11,791
Victory is ours, Wang Yi!

188
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:15,041
We're here! It's Shu Da Hill!

189
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,541
[SI SHI]
Shu Da Hill, you say?

190
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:31,916
What is that?
And what happened next?

191
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Truly some handiwork
befitting his manliness.

192
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:40,208
Shu Da Hill is really the ideal
place for concealing troops.

193
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:45,375
That's exactly right, Wang Yi.

194
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:48,750
[COMMANDER 5A] Unit 1, Unit 2!
Protect His Highness's carriage!

195
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,416
[SOLDIERS]
Sir!

196
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,625
[COMMANDER 5B] Unit 3, Unit 4!
Let's aid Lord Changwen!

197
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:54,666
[SOLDIERS]
Sir!

198
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,041
So you're saying Lord Changwen

199
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,500
mobilized all his
personal troops.

200
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,875
In those circumstances,
how did you...

201
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:05,541
But isn't it painfully obvious?

202
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:11,625
Shu Da Hill is an ideal place
for concealing troops.

203
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:15,291
I'd prepared my own
ambush, you see.

204
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,500
[SOLDIERS yell]

205
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,583
[LORD CHANGWEN]
Wh-What's that?!

206
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:24,625
[WANG YI]
Well, Lord Changwen...

207
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:30,958
[WANG YI]
...we've ourselves a battle!

208
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,291
And for you,

209
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:36,125
a very special tête-à-tête
with yours truly!

210
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,541
[WANG YI]
Well, the result was--

211
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:47,333
which I handed over to you.

212
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:53,875
Bad of me, though, to render
his face unrecognizable.

213
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,750
Still, those who
fight with Wang Yi

214
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,666
generally do end up with their
heads in total shambles, huh?

215
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,833
If you think I'm lying...

216
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:05,166
Shall we try it with a
few heads around here?

217
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:11,291
May I at least ask
you one question?

218
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,750
As many as you like.

219
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:18,500
What is it exactly that you
want now, General Wang Yi?

220
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:21,250
I can't believe someone
like you would join us

221
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:25,958
merely from a desire for
Lord Changwen's lands.

222
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,583
[WANG YI] A world that
excites and sets nerves in.

223
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,541
[SI SHI gasp]

224
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,416
[WANG YI]
Or failing that,

225
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,666
at least a hot,
blood-stirring fight!

226
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,166
[WANG YI]
Of course, I jest.

227
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:48,875
Such a world really does
no longer exist now,

228
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:52,125
but however...

229
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:57,083
If such a world could come
about, though I would be...

230
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,541
[WANG YI]
...beside myself with joy.

231
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,125
[SOLDIER 5A]
Here's one!

232
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:17,875
[CAPTAIN] No mistake. That
belongs to Mu Ta. He's close.

233
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,458
Right! Let's keep on, huh?

234
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,958
Captain, what is
the matter, sir?

235
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:27,458
I must be imagining
things... Let's move!

236
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,083
[SOLDIER 5B]
Captain!

237
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,125
[SOLDIER 5C] The mountain folk?
[SOLDIER 5A] What's this?!

238
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,833
[SOLDIER 5A]
No! Soldiers!

239
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:46,958
[CAPTAIN] That's madness. A
hostile force this deep in here?

240
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:51,375
A hostile... there aren't
forces hostile to us.

241
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,833
But... But you are...

242
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,791
[XIN yells]

243
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,958
[MU TA yells]

244
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:12,500
Oh, wow! That Xin
suddenly got stronger!

245
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,750
When he fought
the Vermilion Slayer,

246
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,833
Xin lost himself in his rage.

247
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:20,625
It's very likely that he
himself doesn't recall.

248
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:23,250
So one could call this battle
he's fighting right now

249
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:26,458
his first genuine
clash of blades.

250
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:32,333
Oh, so this is really
his first, then.

251
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:34,541
[ZHENG] Apparently,
him and Piao went all-out

252
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:37,000
more than a thousand times.

253
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,541
[DIAO]
A thousand?

254
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:43,333
[ZHENG] From that, he has sword
skills to equal most warriors.

255
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:46,875
But there's one thing
he hasn't cultivated:

256
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,666
The strength of spirit
to throw back

257
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,958
a killer intent flung at him.

258
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:54,583
But Xin realized he was being
pushed back by killer intent,

259
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:55,833
and he charged.

260
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:57,708
That assassin is good,

261
00:18:57,791 --> 00:19:00,583
but who Xin's becoming
will no doubt handle this.

262
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:03,333
He will? He'll handle himself?

263
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,250
[MU TA]
This little fella...

264
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:19,291
Even this bloodied his
heart remains unbroken.

265
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:20,916
On the contrary...

266
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,250
[XIN yells]

267
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,791
[MU TA] On the contrary, he
keeps coming on and coming on!

268
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,791
[MU TA] He's getting...
stronger and stronger!

269
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,458
[XIN]
What's this?

270
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:46,875
[XIN]
What's this I feel?

271
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:58,708
[XIN]
My body...

272
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,875
[XIN]
It's like it's gotten lighter!

273
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,208
[XIN]
This again?

274
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:09,875
Your visual tricks won't work
anymore! I see it all clearly!

275
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:14,875
[MU TA screams]
[XIN grunting]

276
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:17,583
[MU TA] He's getting
sharper and sharper...

277
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,583
[MU TA]
This little fella...

278
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,250
[MU TA]
...is fearsome.

279
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,500
[XIN]
I did it.

280
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,333
I did it now!

281
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,041
He did it!

282
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:05,375
[DIAO]
Don't push it.

283
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:08,166
I'm gonna tend to
your wounds right away.

284
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,833
[MU TA grunts]

285
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,125
[XIN, DIAO gasp]

286
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:14,583
As a Basha warrior,
I cannot simply

287
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:17,083
end things like this.

288
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:20,250
I will take this King's
life before I go.

289
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:21,458
Run now, Zheng!!

290
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,625
Prepare to die.

291
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,000
[XIN gasps]

292
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:33,875
What would you do to
His Highness? Scoundrel!

293
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,708
[LORD CHANGWEN grunts]
[MU TA groans]

294
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,583
Why, you are...

295
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:45,583
[DIAO]
Xin!

296
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:12,291
[LORD CHANGWEN] I claimed
your means of escape

297
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:14,083
were foolproof...

298
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,625
[LORD CHANGWEN] The
responsibility for everything

299
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:19,583
that has happened is only mine.

300
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:21,333
Order it, and right now

301
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:24,833
I'll smash my head on
these rocks and end it all.

302
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:29,708
First... firstly though,
above all else...

303
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:32,125
I'm glad you're safe!

304
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:41,750
The same for you.

305
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:49,750
[LORD CHANGWEN sobbing]

306
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:51,833
[SOLDIERS]
Oh, your Highness...

307
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:56,083
[XIN]
Are you kidding me?!

308
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:02,875
[XIN]
What's to be glad about?

309
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:07,291
You, and you, and you!
With all your carrying on!

310
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:11,416
Listen, old man!

311
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:17,166
[XIN]
Piao is... Piao is...

312
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:21,375
Piao is now dead!

313
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:56,083
[XIN] So tell me...
How can I become a general?

314
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:59,125
[NARRATOR] He's set to stake
his life for his advancement.

315
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:01,958
He won't forget the dream
he swore to his friend.

316
