[NARRATOR]
After Pang Nuan's attack,

2
00:00:11,416 --> 00:00:14,250
the Fei Xin Force scattered
and went on the run.

3
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:17,375
Meanwhile, the Gan Yang
Army's surviving soldiers

4
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:20,083
were taken in by
the Lu Wuwei Army.

5
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:24,166
When morning dawned, fewer than
half the Fei Xin force remained.

6
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,416
They now had 36 men left,

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,125
all of whom took up their
weapons again and began walking

8
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,708
while their wounds
were still fresh.

9
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:38,750
And then...

10
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:42,416
[PEI LANG] No doubt about it,
that's a Qin flag.

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,625
They're assembling our soldiers.

12
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:46,333
We should go, commander.

13
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:48,375
Yes.

14
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:55,541
Our allies!

No.

[XIN]
Those guys ain't from Qin!

17
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:05,416
They fell for it right away.

18
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,583
Kill all those
Qin apes, immediately!

19
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,375
Run, now!

Scale the cliffs,
horses can't climb them!

21

23
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:22,083
Wh-What's this rumbling?

24
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:23,750
Behind us!

25
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,541
[SONG ZUO] There's a huge
cavalry incoming from the rear!

26
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:29,291
[WEI PING]
Darn, more Zhao soldiers?!

27
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:33,041
No way, that is...

28
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:35,375
...General Wang Yi!

29
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:39,208
Our general has now
taken to the field!

30
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:42,041
[NARRATOR]
The time: The Spring &amp; Autumn

31
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:44,041
and Warring States periods.

32
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:47,541
Xin a nameless boy who rose to
the rank of squadron commander,

33
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:50,375
carried out a string of
exploits in the midst of battle

34
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:52,916
that brought the
Qin army an advantage.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,375
However, the enemy's commanding
general has appeared at last,

36
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:59,291
and has proven to be
beyond all imagination.

37
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:02,291
That man, said to have a
previous tie to Wang Yi,

38
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:03,666
is named Pang Nuan.

39
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,958
The war situation is on
the verge of great change!

40
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,041
[WANG YI] I assumed
She Meng must be the one

41
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,458
who came up with
that asinine plan.

42
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,416
It seems I was right.

43
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,166
Yes. Quite asinine.

44
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,916
[WANG YI] He's not the man who
decimated our Fourth Army,

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,291
but one can't have everything.

46
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:04,125
For now, let's have She Meng
shoulder all of this sorrow

47
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,875
that we have all
had to suffer since...

Oh, how I've longed
for this day to come!

Wang Yi!

[SHE MENG] The six great
generals are legends now.

56
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:34,625
There's no doubt
of their strength.

57
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:38,083
But I wasn't around
in those days.

58
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:41,666
I'll show you all
that I am a monster

59
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,875
who surpasses the
six generals easily!

60
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,625
[SHE MENG] Now I will reign
over all the battlefields

of the Middle Kingdom.

[TENG]
She Meng, someone like you

64
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,875
could never hold a candle
to our leader.

falling back!

[ZHAO SOLDIER 33A]
Retreat! Retreat!

71
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,666
[WANG YI] I see the Fei Xin
Force has been more than halved

72
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,875
in one night. That's a pity.

73
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:42,458
Are you distressed,
my young Xin?

74
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:45,166
I'm not gonna
think about it now.

75
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,458
Otherwise I feel like
I might just drop here

76
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,750
and not be able to move forward.

77
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,208
However, that's not what those

78
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,000
who have passed away
before us want!

79
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,541
I know it.

80
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,208
So right now,

81
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,791
I'm only thinking about
how the 36 of us standing

82
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:04,416
right here, right now
can fight and win.

83
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:10,083
I had a pep talk
all ready today,

84
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:13,208
but it doesn't seem
necessary now, does it, Teng?

85
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:16,291
No. Quite a boring child.

86
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:20,500
I must say, you have a
fine attitude, young Xin.

87
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:24,291
The path to generalship
is one of sacrifice.

88
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,958
And with every single
sacrifice overcome,

89
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:29,666
the warrior and his unit
grow in greatness.

90
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,083
In fact, growth is essential.

Men, it was worth my while
to name you the Fei Xin Force.

Now it is time to go.

you are safe.

Forgive me.

[ZHAO ZHUANG] General,
as long as you are safe,

this does our strategy
no harm, really.

101
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:12,875
However, in the future,

102
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:15,375
I would be grateful if you'd
tell me of your plans.

103
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:20,125
Otherwise I'm afraid this
may have all been for naught.

00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:23,416
I understand.
You've nothing to fear.

[MESSENGER 33A]
Zhao Zhuang, Sir!

106

The rear guard has
sent up a smoke signal!

107

It's the signal that She Meng
has been slain in battle!

Say what? She Meng
has just been slain?!

109
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,541
Yes, Sir! And there
was one more fire--

00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:39,500
The one that means
Wang Yi's appeared!

111
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:45,291
[ZHAO ZHUANG]
So you're here at last, Wang Yi!

112
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,708
General Pang Nuan's
night raid ended up

113
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:52,291
drawing that cautious old fox
into the mountains, then?

114
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:55,875
She Meng's loss is a
blow to Zhao's armies,

115
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:59,125
but it is certainly
not a fatal one.

116
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:02,041
Now our armies will
intercept each of Qin's

117
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,583
to halt their advances promptly.

118
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:07,750
Wang Yi's army will be
isolated as a result,

119
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,833
and if they come after
our headquarters,

120
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:12,291
Zhao will be victorious!

Is that their headquarters?

Thank you, sir.

127

The enemy should be
off-guard right about now.

No need. Now that
we've come this close,

[DIAO]
Look, smoke signals.

135
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I wonder if
something happened...

136
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,666
I am not an insider,
so I don't know

137
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,208
which army made them.

138
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,875
However, what I do know now,

139
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:56,250
I can't imagine
how harsh war is.

140
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,458
For instance,
to relay information

141
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,375
to an allied force
of unknown position,

142
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,166
smoke signals are
your only option.

143
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,791
But as a tradeoff,
you reveal your own position

144
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,208
to the enemy.

145
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,333
Those fires that you see
wouldn't be set

Yes, a very good reason...

148
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:18,791
There is another way to
deliver messages, you see.

What does that mean, then?

[LI MU] You can use flags'
colors and relative positions

155
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:38,166
to convey very
detailed information.

156
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,041
Still you see,
they have the drawback

157
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:44,541
of only being visible
within a limited range.

00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,958
And from Wang Yi's
own vantage point...

161
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,458
[WANG YI]
Look there, Teng.

162
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:59,333
It's the signal telling us
where Zhao's headquarters is.

163
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,416
Courtesy of Long Guo, I assume.

164
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,791
Yes, Long Guo is good.

165
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:06,083
However, it's deeper
into the mountains

166
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,666
than we originally thought.

167
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,916
I believe that's down
to Zhao Zhuang

168
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,875
pulling back early, rather than
to Long Guo being late.

169
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:15,583
Yes. He's a skilled tactician.

170
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,375
I'm sure Zhao Zhuang

171
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,375
is the one in command
of headquarters,

172
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:22,958
but if Pang Nuan were to
involve himself somehow...

173
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:26,583
This will be
quite unpredictable.

174
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:29,875
[WANG YI] Now I'm a bit
concerned about Meng Wu.

175
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:33,791
I'm positive his battle
has already begun.

176
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:36,416
[NARRATOR] Just as Wang Yi
surmised, at that very moment

177
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,458
the battle between
Zhao Zhuang's army

178
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:41,833
and the Meng Wu-Long Guo
Armies was at fever pitch.

179
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:45,000
Meng Wu and Long Guo initially
tore through the enemy

180
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:48,041
with their sudden attack,
but the Zhao Zhuang Army's

181
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,416
adroit interception
halted their momentum,

182
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,875
leaving the two sides closely
matched in strength.

183
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,333
Nevertheless, with Meng Wu
taking the lead,

184
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:59,083
Meng Wu and Long Guo's
armies steadily

185
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,791
pressed Zhao Zhuang's men back.

186
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:07,416
[SOLDIERS screaming]

187
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,375
Attention, Meng Wu
and Long Guo Armies!

188
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:25,083
That big man with the
long black hair is Pang Nuan!

189
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,541
[LONG GUO]
Zhao's commanding general

190
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,416
has had the nerve to
show himself before us!

191
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,416
Surround him and take his head!

192
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,083
[MENG WU]
So that's the famous Pang Nuan.

193
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:36,208
That explains why he
struck me differently.

194
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:39,791
I never met a man who
reeked so strongly of war.

195
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:49,291
[MENG WU]
Me, in a cold sweat?

196
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,791
Interesting!

197
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:54,208
[MENG WU yells]

198
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,916
[MENG WU yells]

199
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,166
What's this?!

200
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,250
H-He just ran?

201
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,541
How dare you do that!

202
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:17,083
Don't tell me you think
I'm not strong enough

203
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:18,625
to go to battle, you!

204
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,833
[MENG WU] Do you think
I'll let you escape?!

205
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,250
[MENG WU'S SOLDIER 33A]
Follow General Meng Wu!

206
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,416
[LONG GUO]
No... what is this?

207
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,041
Something is wrong.

208
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,958
Even so, this is
still a good chance

209
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,500
to slay Pang Nuan.

210
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,875
[ZHAO ZHUANG]
We netted a different fish

211
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:41,333
than we were hoping for,
but this is just fine.

212
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:42,875
They cannot possibly
have guessed

213
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,041
that we used our commanding
general as a decoy.

214
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:49,208
[ZHAO ZHUANG] Wang Yi,
in the end you'll have no choice

215
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:50,958
but to show yourself.

216
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:59,541
[LONG GUO] This terrain
is bad! It's clearly a trap!

217
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,458
General Meng Wu--

218
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:09,083
[SOLDIERS gasping]

219
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,416
[SOLDIERS scream]

220
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:17,833
[MENG WU'S SOLDIER 33B]
My lord!

221
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,208
[LONG GUO]
General Meng Wu!

222
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,583
[MENG WU]
How many casualties?

223
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:24,083
Even at a rough estimate,
I would say half, sir.

224
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,833
[MENG WU]
Half...

225
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:28,041
It's enough. Let's go.

226
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,375
Sir, please wait!

227
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:32,333
The strategist Zhao Zhuang
is trying to reel you in

228
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:34,083
with Pang Nuan as bait.

229
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,708
We should withdraw
for the moment

230
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:38,291
and try to regroup.

231
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,916
I think that is a big mistake.

232
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,541
I will not be
stopped by strategy!

233
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,166
[NARRATOR] At the same
time that Meng Wu rode

234
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,750
into Zhao Zhuang's trap,

235
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:58,708
Wang Yi was dividing his forces
into cavalry and infantry.

236
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:02,041
He and the cavalry searched out
a route the horses could travel

237
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,333
while he took advantage of the
infantry's maneuverability

238
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,833
and sent them sprinting
along a direct route

239
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:09,750
that gave them almost
the same speed.

240
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,541
[XIN] Wei Ping, Chong Yuan,
just don't overdo it, okay?

241
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:21,291
General Wang Yi said
anybody who couldn't keep up

242
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:22,375
was allowed to bow out.

243
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:26,083
[WEI PING]
Don't be stupid, Xin.

244
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:29,041
You want us to lie napping
after we've come this far?

245
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:32,958
N-Not a chance. Let's go.

246
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,958
I may not have fight left in me,

247
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,791
but I'm seeing this war
through to the very end!

248
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,291
With my own two eyes!

249
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,541
You heard the man.

250
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:46,625
I am not sure all
this rush is a good idea.

251
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,500
We're defenseless like this.

252
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:52,166
If we were to get ambushed now,
I think we're all done for.

253
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,250
[SONG ZUO laughs] I get why
the general's in a hurry,

254
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,500
but this is a bit much.

255
00:14:57,583 --> 00:15:00,041
[QIANG LEI] General Wang Yi
knows the enemy isn't here.

256
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:02,333
Hence the plan.

257
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:04,958
Well how can he with all
of these mountains?

258
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:06,791
[QIANG LEI]
Don't ask me.

259
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:10,458
Our lieutenant's as gruff
as ever, or so it seems.

260
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,416
[QIANG LEI]
Be quiet and just run.

261
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,041
[SONG ZUO]
Okay.

262
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,333
[NARRATOR]
Just as Qiang Lei said,

263
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:21,083
Wang Yi knew that there was
no Zhao army presence

264
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,208
where they were going.

265
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,500
The reason, of course,
was the flags.

266
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:27,208
Even as Wang Yi
continued his advance,

267
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:30,833
he periodically raised flags
toward Qin headquarters.

268
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,916
These were messages for
the various commanders

269
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,833
scattered across the mountains.

270
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,791
His remaining subordinates
at headquarters

271
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:42,041
faithfully relayed these
messages with their flags.

272
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,125
The combat commanders
in each location

273
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:48,166
kept an eye on those flags
to exchange information.

274
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,791
Naturally, their messages
were also conveyed back

275
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:54,166
to Wang Yi via headquarters.

276
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,166
This meant that as long as
he kept headquarters in sight,

277
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,750
Wang Yi was aware of the
overall positions and states

278
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:04,375
of both Qin's armies and Zhao's.

279
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:07,000
The exception: he did not
know the movements

280
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:09,458
of Meng Wu and Long Guo's armies

281
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,958
which had made contact
with Zhao headquarters.

282
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:15,791
Neither of these armies
had answered Wang Yi.

283
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:19,875
Therefore, he hastened
his advance even more now.

284
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:25,500
Well the flags have changed
positions once again.

285
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,291
Which means the war
situation is changing?

286
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,458
[LI MU]
Exactly so.

287
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,458
[DIAO]
Kaine.

288
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:38,208
Here, I made lunch.
It's your share.

289
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,375
Tasty, isn't it?

290
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,791
Yes.

291
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,541
--[KAINE] Fine!
--Huh?

292
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,500
[DIAO]
Hey Kaine...

293
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,583
You are a woman, correct?

294
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,166
[KAINE]
Obviously!

295
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,791
Yeah, totally! Ha, ha!

296
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:00,375
But you know, um,
you don't seem too womanly

297
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:01,500
so I thought you
might be a man...

298
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:02,416
[KAINE]
What?!

299
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,833
[KAINE gasps, growls]

300
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:09,083
[KAINE]
Oh, so you're a gi--

301
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,291
[KAINE]
I see...

302
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:15,541
Well, it's not too rare these
days for a woman to survive

303
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,583
by dressing as a man, you see.

304
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,208
So did you get carried away

305
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:22,041
and decide to be a
"male" tactician?

306
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,125
[KAINE]
Am I wrong?

307
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,333
Am I wrong, Kaine?

308
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,666
[DIAO]
I don't know yet.

309
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,625
I just thought if
I didn't do something,

310
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,791
I'd get left behind...

311
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,583
I didn't know
what to do exactly,

312
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:42,083
but being here, I feel like
I've started to figure it out.

313
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,125
[KAINE] If that's what
you're thinking forget it.

314
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,291
Huh?

315
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,791
You do not understand anything.

316
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,791
If you're going
to be a tactician,

317
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:52,916
you need to grasp what
being one really means.

318
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,375
What it means?

319
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:55,708
That's right.

320
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:58,875
It's more stressful and
painful to be a tactician

321
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:02,083
than a soldier bleeding
on the front lines.

322
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,833
Painful...

323
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:09,375
[KAINE]
...and terrible as well.

324
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,958
[JIE SHEN]
Sir, they're here.

325
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,291
[JIE SHEN]
That's Wang Yi's army.

326
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,916
There it is:
Zhao headquarters...

327
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,083
But, why then...?

328
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,500
That's right...

329
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,375
[XIN]
The place is totally empty!

330
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,750
This will do.

331
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,875
Let's just stop here
and do some real

332
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,250
information gathering,
shall we, Teng?

333
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,375
Yes.

334
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:06,375
[MESSENGER 33B]
I have a report!

335
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,166
[OFFICER 33A]
Madness!

336
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,583
Zhao trapped him in a rockslide
and took half his troops,

337
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:15,458
and still pursued them
on Long Guo's watch!

338
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:17,875
[OFFICER 33B] We can't
fault him for the pursuit.

339
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,291
With the commanding
enemy general

340
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:22,041
in front of him, anyone
would have pressed on.

341
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:25,625
The larger issue is
the missing Zhao army.

342
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:28,541
They have stockade
around headquarters;

343
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,500
why leave it behind?

344
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:33,583
To go and exterminate
Meng Wu simply.

345
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,083
[OFFICER 33B]
My lord?

346
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:38,291
[WANG YI] I imagine Zhao Zhuang
has units lying in ambush

347
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:43,333
along Meng Wu's path to
slowly whittle down his army.

348
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,541
Once the army's been gutted,
he intends to bring him down

349
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:49,208
with Zhao's main force
from headquarters.

350
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:50,875
In which case, we can all

351
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:55,208
go to the Meng Wu Army's aid
by following Zhao Zhuang?

352
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,083
But if we go any further,

353
00:19:57,166 --> 00:20:00,125
we will lose sight of
our own headquarters.

354
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,208
By extension, that would mean

355
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:06,791
losing our overall picture
of an enormous battlefield.

356
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,125
[WANG YI]
We likely have no choice.

357
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:14,083
I imagine that
Zhao Zhuang's strategy

358
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:18,625
is to lure me away from Qin
and our headquarters here, men.

359
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:22,500
So if we stay here, they
won't make a single move.

360
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:25,708
Moreover, Zhao Zhuang
surely laid the traps

361
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:29,708
Meng Wu is facing
in order to kill me.

362
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:35,458
I'm afraid Meng Wu may well
lose his life in this battle.

363
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,333
Listen, men...

364
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,750
Let's take the field.

365
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,833
[MENG WU yells]

366
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,458
How many fell?

367
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,000
[MENG WU'S SOLDIER 33C]
Around 2,000!

368
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,000
You little...

369
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:04,000
Pang Nuan!

370
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,833
Get him, General!

371
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:08,000
[MENG WU yells]

372
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:14,916
[ALL gasp]

373
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:19,208
[SOLDIERS cheer]

374
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,625
General Meng Wu, you did it.

375
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,916
[MENG WU]
No.

376
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,250
This man here isn't
Pang Nuan. He's a fake.

377
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,000
[LONG GUO]
Sir?!

378
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:33,041
On your guard, men.
They're coming.

379
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:39,958
[SOLDIERS yelling]

380
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,500
[ZHENG]
A night battle?

381
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:43,666
[LORD CHANGPING]
Yes, Your Highness,

382
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,083
if the last smoke signal
is to be believed.

383
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:50,000
It would seem that Pang Nuan
has now re-appeared.

384
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,833
Pang Nuan?! But why now?

385
00:21:54,916 --> 00:22:00,125
A nighttime attack is no
fit tactic for a large army.

386
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:03,125
I believe something unexpected
must have occurred.

387
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,541
[LORD CHANGWEN] And that
"something" was Pang Nuan?

388
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,416
Yes.

389
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,875
The other day,
you described Pang Nuan

390
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:11,750
as not a general, but a man,

391
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:15,541
crystallization of warfare,
right, Lord Changwen?

392
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,416
Yes.

393
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,208
Can such a man be suitable

394
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:21,583
for the position of
commanding general?

395
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:24,541
And yet he is, in fact,
in that very position

396
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,250
at this moment...

397
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:29,041
This war is peculiar.

398
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:32,500
Wait! Unless...

399
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:34,708
[BUREAUCRAT 33A]
Your Highness!

400
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:36,083
[LORD CHANGWEN]
What is it?

401
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:38,041
[BUREAUCRAT 33A]
We have an emergency.

402
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:48,875
That is...

403
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:50,666
Lord Changwen, let's go.

404
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,041
[LORD CHANGWEN]
Sir.

405
00:22:58,125 --> 00:23:00,541
Naturally, I'm happy
to see you again,

406
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:03,583
but what brought on this visit?

407
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:05,291
Yang Duanhe.

408
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:08,458
Zheng king of Qin,
you look well.

409
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:10,458
I realize this is
a hectic time,

410
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:14,166
but I have come here because
there is something very urgent

411
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:18,041
I must tell you immediately
about the current war.

412
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:20,500
[ZHENG]
Something you must tell me...?

413
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:57,041
[WANG YI] So, shall we
finally settle this then?

414
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:59,416
[NARRATOR]
Bloodlust fills the air.

415
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,583
The path opens
at his demonic smile.

416
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:05,625
Next Time:
"The Main Attraction."
