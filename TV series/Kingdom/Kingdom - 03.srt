1
00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:15,916
Hey! I know you!

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,416
[CHILD giggles]

3
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:27,875
I know a way through.
Come with me.

4
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:30,458
[NARRATOR]
Ancient China...

5
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:34,750
The time of the sages was over,
swept away by base human greed.

6
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:35,916
Over five centuries,

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,041
an endless storm of war,
hatred, and strife

8
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:39,875
raged across the land.

9
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:41,541
Over a hundred nations fell,

10
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:44,625
winnowed away until
only seven remained.

11
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:46,916
Now, from Qin,
the westernmost kingdom,

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,416
a great wind of history
is about to blow.

13
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,833
This is the tale of a
nameless boy and a young King

14
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:54,833
who ran the gauntlet
in this age of strife.

15
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:33,333
There's a way through?

16
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:39,083
[ZHENG] You know how we
can elude these troops?

17
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,416
Duh, of course!

18
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,416
This is a village of
wanted criminals, you know.

19
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,541
There are so many secret
escape routes and passages

20
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,375
that you could get lost forever.

21
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:47,500
Wait a minute!

22
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:49,875
There's no way we're
trusting this kid!

23
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:51,750
[XIN grunts]

24
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,000
[DIAO yelps]

25
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,791
[XIN] It's thanks to him
that I was surrounded

26
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,500
by those ruffians
from the village!

27
00:02:56,583 --> 00:03:00,458
He's the first one I'm
going to settle things with!

28
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:03,250
Why would you be
willing to help us?

29
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:07,291
[DIAO] I was eavesdropping
on you earlier.

30
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,583
You're the King of
this country, aren't you?

31
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:12,333
That means you're
a very rich man.

32
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:13,833
It's money you're after?

33
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:15,375
[DIAO]
Is that a problem?

34
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:16,833
Not at all.

35
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:19,500
In fact, it makes
you trustworthy.

36
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,125
Hey, hey, hey!

37
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,291
There's nothing trustworthy
about this brat!

38
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:24,791
We don't know who he is!

39
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:27,541
You wanna trust some kid that
doesn't even have a name?

40
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,083
I have a name!

41
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:31,791
Huh?

42
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:35,208
My name is He Liao Diao!

43
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:44,416
[DIAO] There, now I've
properly introduced myself.

44
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,666
Have you made up your minds?
There's no time to waste.

45
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,916
Very well. Lead
the way, He Liao.

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,250
[DIAO]
Diao is fine.

47
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:52,583
W-Wait!

48
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,583
So you're really going to
go along with this kid?

49
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:58,541
[shouting]

50
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:07,000
[MEN whimpering]
[SOLDIERS shouting]

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,208
[DIAO]
C'mon, this way!

52
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,375
It's pitch black,
so keep to the wall.

53
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,833
I'll light the
torch further along.

54
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,541
[thud]
[XIN] Ow!

55
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,083
Is it still too soon
for a torch, brat?

56
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,875
[DIAO]
It's not "brat"! It's Diao!

57
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:41,958
[XIN]
Hey, King! Did you get hurt?

58
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,500
It's not my blood.
It's from above.

59
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,833
Huh? From above?

60
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,458
[XIN groans]

61
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,291
How awful...

62
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,833
So the soldiers are
going to slaughter

63
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,958
everyone in the village?

64
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,291
[XIN]
Hey, Diao!

65
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,291
Do you have a family
or someone close?

66
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,000
They're all being
killed up above!

67
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,208
[DIAO]
I don't have anyone.

68
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:03,958
[XIN]
Huh?

69
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,083
[DIAO]
By the way,

70
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,791
are you one of the
King's retinue, Xin?

71
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,083
What? No, of course not.

72
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,625
[DIAO]
Thought not.

73
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:13,166
You look about as common as
a commoner could possibly be.

74
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,333
You're a pretty
spirited one, though.

75
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,958
What, something wrong with that?

76
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,125
[DIAO]
Well, I mean,

77
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,125
you talk to the King
like he's an equal!

78
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:21,750
Your attitude kinda sucks, too.

79
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,958
Are you just stupid
or something?

80
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:27,625
You know you're just
as rude as I am, right?

81
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:30,500
[DIAO]
Me? It's okay for me to do it.

82
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:33,000
It's not like he's
my king, after all.

83
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,166
Huh?

84
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,291
[DIAO]
I'm not from Qin originally.

85
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:40,375
I'm one of the people of
the far western mountains.

86
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,125
I don't know why,
but apparently,

87
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,000
our whole clan was driven
out of the mountains

88
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,541
and wound up here
in Heibei Village.

89
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,458
All the others are dead now.

90
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:50,416
So you're one of
the mountain folk?

91
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,791
I've never seen one.

92
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:54,083
So that's why you
dress so funny.

93
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,583
[DIAO]
Hey!

94
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,875
You were talking down to me
just now, weren't you?!

95
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,833
What? You wanna go at it, kid?

96
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:04,208
[DIAO] Nobody disrespects
the mountain folk! Come on!

97
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:07,500
Lemme get in at least
one punch on you!

98
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:08,791
Hey!

99
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:12,166
Let's go. This isn't playtime.

100
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,375
[XIN]
Crap. What am I doing?!

101
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:23,291
[XIN]
He's to blame!

102
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,416
Piao's dead...

103
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,833
...and he's to blame!

104
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:34,958
Uh... It-it's nothing.

105
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:42,500
[XIN]
Later...

106
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,958
Once we give the
soldiers the slip...

107
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,458
[XIN] Once there are
no more problems,

108
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,208
I'm gonna settle
things with this guy.

109
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,416
[SOLDIER 3A] We searched every
last corner of the village, sir,

110
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,041
but didn't find any young men

111
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,625
who matched the description
included in your orders.

112
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:05,083
[LIEUTENANT 3A]
How can that be?

113
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:06,500
[SOLDIER 3A] He must have
either taken refuge

114
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,083
in the mountains
before we arrived,

115
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,416
or he was able to escape
by following the river, sir.

116
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,916
Or...

117
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,625
It's possible there might be
some underground passageways

118
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:14,583
out of the area.

119
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,125
In that case,

120
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,541
rouse up all of our men and
split them up to seek him out!

121
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:19,958
[SOLDIER 3A]
Yes, sir!

122
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,916
[LIEUTENANT 3A] This has turned
into a fiasco, hasn't it?

123
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,166
Hm. As things stand,
I suppose we'll have to ask

124
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,125
for that man's assistance.

125
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:31,625
"That man," sir?
You don't mean...?

126
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,458
Summon Mu Ta.

127
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,500
[DIAO]
Hmm?

128
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,250
By the way, Majesty,

129
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,875
why are you being chased by
soldiers in a place like this?

130
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:44,833
Because his younger half-brother
started a rebellion.

131
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,750
One big happy family, huh?

132
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,541
[DIAO]
It's weird, though.

133
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,250
[XIN]
W-What is?

134
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,625
[DIAO]
Well, think about it.

135
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,583
Your Majesty,
you prepared a stand-in

136
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,000
and hid in Heibei village

137
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:02,250
because you knew this uprising
was gonna happen, right?

138
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,458
[DIAO] But if you knew
about it ahead of time,

139
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:10,500
wouldn't it be better to
crush it before it happened?

140
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:15,541
Why are you so ready
and eager to run and hide?

141
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:18,166
You're supposed to be a king!

142
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,916
No kidding.

143
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:22,708
Diao!

144
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:23,833
[DIAO gasps]

145
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,583
What is it?

146
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,333
[ZHENG] The reason I couldn't
nip the uprising in the bud

147
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:31,750
was because I didn't
have the strength.

148
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:34,041
That's all there is to it.

149
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:39,041
[ZHENG] My grandfather,
King Xiaowen, passed away

150
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:42,416
only three days
after his crowning.

151
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,541
The next in line, my father,
King Zhuangxiang,

152
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,458
died after three years.

153
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,333
[ZHENG] Because of that,
I ascended to the throne

154
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:55,291
last year, at the
tender age of 13.

155
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:07,500
[ZHENG] Of course, a child
couldn't carry out the duties

156
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,166
of a king, and so
I became nothing more

157
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,375
than an ornament
sitting on the throne.

158
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,041
[ZHENG] Now, the Royal Court
has become consumed

159
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,583
with selfish ambition.

160
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:20,041
It's a battleground
between rival Ministers.

161
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,458
The one who's seized
the most power

162
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:24,333
is the Minister of
the Right, Lü Buwei.

163
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,416
[ZHENG] Lü Buwei has
been a support to me,

164
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,958
and he used that to further
strengthen his own influence.

165
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,208
The second most
powerful is Jie Shi,

166
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,083
Minister of the Left.

167
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,833
The court has
splintered into halves,

168
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,833
with these two at the centre,

169
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,958
and the conflict between them
gets bloodier and bloodier.

170
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:46,333
Pwah! These Ministers are
scum, every last one of 'em!

171
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:51,458
Hang on a second. If you were
just a pretty figurehead,

172
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,583
how the heck did you get
tangled up in this fight

173
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:56,083
between the Ministers?

174
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,625
It's because my
half-brother, Cheng Jiao,

175
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:00,458
wanted the throne for himself.

176
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,541
[ZHENG]
To that end, he allied himself

177
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:06,333
with the Minister
of the Left, Jie Shi.

178
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,333
[ZHENG] When my protector
Lu Buwei went on an expedition

179
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,541
against the neighbouring
kingdom of Wei,

180
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,625
he took all of his
forces with him.

181
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:18,375
Jie Shi and Cheng Jiao
used the opportunity

182
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:19,875
to make their move...

183
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,875
[ZHENG]
And thus, instigated this coup.

184
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:27,666
[XIN gasps]

185
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,958
[DIAO] Wow. Then that
was quite an escape.

186
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,708
You had to get out of a palace

187
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,708
packed with those guys'
supporters, all by yourself?

188
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:38,666
[ZHENG]
Not by myself.

189
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,541
The Royal Court is filled
with many enemies,

190
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:45,416
but there's one man whose
loyalty to me runs deep.

191
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,375
Right now, he's a civil servant,

192
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:50,041
and he serves under
me as my tutor.

193
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,250
But in his younger years,

194
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:54,375
he was a hero on the
field of battle.

195
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:58,750
[ZHENG]
His name is Lord Changwen.

196
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,750
[XIN]
Lord Changwen?

197
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:04,000
The old man who took Piao away?

198
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,750
[ZHENG] Lord Changwen judged
that he couldn't rein Jie Shi in

199
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,458
with only his small
contingent of troops,

200
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:13,125
so instead, he devised a plan
to escape from the palace.

201
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,166
[ZHENG] In case the two of us
were separated when we fled,

202
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,458
he went to set up a number
of backup meeting sites

203
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,666
ahead of time.

204
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,750
Heibei Village was one
of those meeting sites.

205
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,583
[ZHENG]
But then...

206
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:33,750
On his way back from scouting
the village, he met someone...

207
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:37,375
A boy named Piao,
who looked exactly like me.

208
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,833
[XIN gasps]

209
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,166
[ZHENG]
Piao changed matters.

210
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,625
Rather than being just an
emergency meeting-place,

211
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,708
Heibei Village could
become a safe refuge

212
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,916
for me while Piao took my place.

213
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,500
[XIN growls]

214
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,041
Now I get it!

215
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,500
There was this rumor
going around the village

216
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,916
that there was a person
with some sort of horrible

217
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,958
contagious disease living
in that shack you were in,

218
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,791
so of course, we all
stayed well away from it.

219
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,541
So that rumor must
have been a lie

220
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,291
this Lord Changwen put out in
order to conceal Your Majesty

221
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,208
and keep us all away from you!

222
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,958
[ZHENG] Lord Changwen
still had confidence

223
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,791
in the original escape plan.

224
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,291
To him, both Heibei
Village and Piao

225
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:20,500
were merely contingency plans
for a worst-case scenario.

226
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,041
But in the end,

227
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:27,000
it's thanks to those contingency
plans that I'm still alive.

228
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,500
Well, doesn't sound like

229
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:31,125
you had much of
a choice, really.

230
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:34,500
[XIN]
Wait... just a minute.

231
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:38,208
So you're saying that
Piao was just part

232
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,583
of a "worst-case scenario?"

233
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:43,208
Just a "contingency plan?"

234
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,500
[XIN yells]

235
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:53,291
That's enough outta you!

236
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,333
[XIN, ZHENG grunting]

237
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:03,541
[XIN] Who the hell do you think
Piao's life belonged to?!

238
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,166
Stop it, Xin!

239
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,666
[DIAO yells]

240
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,833
[DIAO groans]

241
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,875
How dare you?! How dare
you do this to Piao?!

242
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,666
[DIAO groans]
Stop it! Stop it, Xin!

243
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,458
If you keep doing this...

244
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:21,000
If you don't stop,
the King is gonna die!

245
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,750
You killed Piao!

246
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:32,166
[XIN grunting]

247
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:36,000
[ZHENG]
Stop it. That's enough.

248
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,666
I am currently waging a war,

249
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,208
and one with extremely
bad odds at that.

250
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:43,416
[XIN]
A war?

251
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,250
[ZHENG] Whatever methods
are available to me,

252
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,333
even deception or sacrifice,

253
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,916
I will use them to
my fullest advantage.

254
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,333
Wh-What did you say?!

255
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:55,250
But... your friend understood
that from the beginning!

256
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:59,041
He knew the risks,
and yet, he still tried!

257
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,375
[PIAO]
A stand-in?

258
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,666
[LORD CHANGWEN] There's
nothing to worry about, Piao.

259
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:08,000
We'll use every possible
means to prepare for escape

260
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,500
and ensure Jie Shi
knows nothing.

261
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,250
There is absolutely no chance

262
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,625
that the rebels' swords will
touch the King's person.

263
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,750
It's just that
we want to prepare

264
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,916
against all
conceivable eventualities.

265
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,166
[ZHENG] Don't gloss
things over, Lord Changwen.

266
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,166
[PIAO gasps]

267
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,333
[LORD CHANGWEN]
Your Majesty...

268
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:28,458
[ZHENG] Confidence does not
equate to absolute certainty,

269
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,958
and that's why a stand-in
double is needed.

270
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,083
Be clear with him.

271
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:38,458
[ZHENG] It's Piao, correct?
Listen carefully.

272
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:42,250
In this plan, there are no
guarantees of safety for you.

273
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:47,000
It is possible that the blades
of my enemies could reach you.

274
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:50,041
In that case, they would
mistake you for me...

275
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,750
...and kill you.

276
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,708
Have you lost your voice?

277
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,458
Piao...

278
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:03,333
[PIAO]
Uh... um... Lord Changwen?

279
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:04,500
Hm?

280
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,916
Yes? What is it?

281
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,916
[PIAO] May I speak directly
to His Majesty the King?

282
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,750
[LORD CHANGWEN]
What are you saying?!

283
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,291
You should know
your place, Piao!

284
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,583
I'll allow it.

285
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,916
Raise your head,
and speak your mind.

286
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,500
Y-Your Majesty!

287
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,500
[PIAO] I'm a backwater
servant who was suddenly

288
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:26,416
offered a position at court.
I came expecting full well

289
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,000
that there would be grave
matters waiting for me.

290
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,916
But for you to
grant me a duty

291
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,375
as important as this one...

292
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,416
...it's beyond my
wildest dreams!

293
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,583
Piao! So then, you'll do this?

294
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,916
You realize this may
be the death of you.

295
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,041
[PIAO] My friend and I have
hopes way beyond our station.

296
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,583
[PIAO]
We wanna go down in history

297
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:50,958
as the greatest generals
this land has seen.

298
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:55,041
For that, I've always been
ready to risk everything.

299
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,458
[ZHENG]
Piao accepted the post,

300
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:59,041
even though he was
aware of the hazards.

301
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,500
He accepted, knowing it
might even mean death.

302
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,000
He risked it all for the sake

303
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,000
of attaining
something truly great,

304
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,333
something that living
an ordinary life

305
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,833
could never get him!

306
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:12,500
[XIN coughing]

307
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,791
[ZHENG]
But in the end...

308
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:19,500
He died, and failed
to attain his dream.

309
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,625
That's the end of it.

310
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:34,500
[XIN sobbing]

311
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:41,083
[ZHENG]
A breeze... is the exit nearby?

312
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,125
Huh? Oh, yeah.

313
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,333
It's right over there.

314
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:46,708
[DIAO]
W-Wait!

315
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:50,000
Hey, hold on just a second!
Xin still isn't ready.

316
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,625
[ZHENG]
Xin.

317
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:55,125
Let these tears be the
last time you grieve for Piao.

318
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,916
What's ahead now
is your own path.

319
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,625
[ZHENG] You have two
paths to choose from:

320
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:04,416
Return to your village
and live as a servant,

321
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,166
or aid a powerless king,

322
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,708
and accompany him into
both wilderness and war.

323
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,708
It goes without saying
which of them

324
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:15,083
will get you closer
to your foolish dreams.

325
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,541
It's a new dawn.

326
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:38,083
[JIE SHI] What do you mean,
the King's nowhere to be found?

327
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,458
M-My lord, apparently,

328
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,833
there was a hidden underground
passage out of the village.

329
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:45,333
Our forces are pouring
everything into the search.

330
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:48,000
[JIE SHI]
That accursed Lord Changwen.

331
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,583
I knew he was up
to something sly,

332
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:53,166
but to think that he
prepared so thoroughly...!

333
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,541
Our main problem
is Lord Changwen.

334
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,750
We mustn't underestimate him.

335
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:01,000
Search everywhere for the King
and Lord Changwen's whereabouts!

336
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,916
[WANG YI] Don't worry.
There's no need for that.

337
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,458
[MEN gasping]

338
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,416
[WANG YI chuckles]

339
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,833
General Wang Yi...

340
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,958
The situation has been
rather critical lately.

341
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,708
Where were you,
and what were you doing?

342
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:27,166
What was I doing?
Why, my dear Left Minister,

343
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,958
I was just playing
outside for a bit.

344
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,041
Fine.

345
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,666
And what do you mean
there's no need

346
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,875
to search for Lord Changwen?

347
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,916
[WANG YI cackles]

348
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,083
[DIAO]
What... What?!

349
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,375
[DIAO] What do you mean, you
don't have any money to pay me?!

350
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,000
[ZHENG]
I left it in the shack.

351
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,958
[DIAO] I said from the
start that I was in it

352
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:50,958
for the money, right?

353
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,458
[ZHENG]
Yes.

354
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,333
[DIAO] Then why didn't you
tell me you didn't have any??

355
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:55,958
[ZHENG]
There's no need to worry.

356
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,666
When I return to Court, I'll
prepare a large reward for you.

357
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,833
You can come and
get it at a good time.

358
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,000
[DIAO] You'll pay me
when you return to Court?

359
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:06,333
But when in the world are you
gonna be able to do that?!

360
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,500
I'm afraid there's
no way to know.

361
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:12,500
For now, just find us some food.
You can manage that... probably.

362
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,291
Wh-wh-what?!

363
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:18,583
That's sooo low! Are you
even human, you jerk?!

364
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:19,958
[XIN]
Hey, Zheng!

365
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,250
"Zheng"?

366
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,291
You're talking about
returning to Court.

367
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:26,791
Any idea how to do that?
The other side's got an army,

368
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,916
and we've only got
two guys, you and me.

369
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Huh?

370
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,333
But wait, Xin!

371
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,250
You're not thinking of
going with him, are you?

372
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:39,458
As a matter of fact, I am.
But don't get the wrong idea.

373
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,666
It's not like I've forgotten
about Piao at all,

374
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,541
and it's not like
I'm kneeling down

375
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,208
to you as my King.

376
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:48,208
You're only useful
for one thing:

377
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:51,041
The path that Piao and I chose.

378
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:54,500
Hm. Even if you did humble
yourself, I'd feel ill.

379
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,125
And another thing...

380
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,625
I don't see you as something
important like a retainer.

381
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:02,708
You're just a sword,
used to keep me from danger.

382
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,291
Break, and I'll throw you away.

383
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,458
[XIN growls]
Now just hold on, you!

384
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,791
Yeah, now you're
just being a jerk!

385
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,208
Well then?

386
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,708
How are you gonna manage
getting back into the palace?

387
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,041
[ZHENG]
On the far side of these woods

388
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,333
is the last of
our meeting sites.

389
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:19,041
Hopefully, I can meet
Lord Changwen there.

390
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,833
That's all I can do.

391
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,416
[SI SHI] A report has come in
from Heibei Village, my lord.

392
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,041
They've confirmed the
King is indeed alive.

393
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,208
According to the report,

394
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:30,625
he slipped through
the troops' encirclement

395
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,375
and vanished into the forest.

396
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,583
[JIE SHI]
The obstinate little fool.

397
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:38,208
But so be it. The biggest
problem, Lord Changwen,

398
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,333
is no longer a concern.

399
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:43,000
He is still quite a
dangerous fellow, though.

400
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:46,291
Thanks to his interference, this
coup nearly ended in failure.

401
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,166
He was originally a warrior

402
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,333
of great fame
on the battlefield.

403
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,208
He should have been watched
with great vigilance.

404
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:53,416
Huh.

405
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,500
And now, you say he's
no longer a problem.

406
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,291
Who can we thank for that?

407
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,583
That man over there.

408
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,291
[SI SHI]
General Wang Yi?

409
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:10,791
The legendary general
offered us his aid?

410
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,916
Yes, he was willing
to fight on our side

411
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,458
on the condition
that he could claim

412
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,916
Lord Changwen's
territories for himself.

413
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,458
Frankly, if we can
get that man as an ally

414
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:23,208
for just that bit of land,
I'd call that a bargain.

415
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,583
Wang Yi's motives are
never really clear.

416
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:28,125
If I were you, I wouldn't
trust him too much.

417
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:30,291
It could be your undoing.

418
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,416
[JIE SHI]
My undoing?

419
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,541
You're not in a
position to talk.

420
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,416
Shouldn't you be more
worried about your own neck

421
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,375
than the necks of other people?

422
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,250
Leave the King
to me, my lord.

423
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:45,416
A suitable assassin is already
on his way to track him down.

424
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,666
I hear the Vermilion
Slayer was defeated.

425
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,000
Now, will this
one do any better?

426
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:51,375
[SI SHI]
Not to worry.

427
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:55,625
The assassin who will
track the King... is Mu Ta.

428
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,166
[WEI XING] It seems your
time has come, Mu Ta.

429
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:08,583
[MU TA] Tracking this time,
is it, Master?

430
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:10,916
Mu Ta's nose is fearsome.

431
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,916
There are three of them,
little ones, running away.

432
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,083
Three of them?!

433
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,791
[MU TA]
Mu Ta's legs are fearsome, too.

434
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:20,750
Mu Ta will catch up to them.

435
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:23,375
This guy is supposed
to be an assassin?

436
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:24,958
[MU TA growls]

437
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,916
Oh man, and he missed his shot!

438
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,333
[MU TA]
Mu Ta didn't miss.

439
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:39,333
[SOLDIER screams, gags]

440
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:43,041
[SOLDIERS gasp]

441
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:46,625
[MU TA] Mu Ta aims on purpose
to scrape your cheek with dart.

442
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:49,625
That's all it takes to die.

443
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:53,000
Mu Ta's poison darts
are fearsome, too.

444
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:56,041
That will be enough, Mu Ta.
You've made your point.

445
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,541
[MU TA]
Okay.

446
00:22:57,625 --> 00:23:00,416
[WEI XING] I know of your
prowess, and your... skill set.

447
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,125
Now go, quickly!

448
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:03,208
[MU TA]
Oh, yes.

449
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:05,375
Mu Ta will find
the little fellas,

450
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:09,708
kill them with poison
darts, and with axe...

451
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:12,583
Take three little heads
and bring them back.

452
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:14,166
Oh, yes.

453
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:17,000
Oh, yes. Oh, yes...

454
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:21,125
Oh, yes!

455
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:54,625
[ZHENG]
I told you. You're just a sword.

456
00:24:54,708 --> 00:24:56,625
If you break,
I'll cast you away.

457
00:24:56,708 --> 00:24:59,583
[NARRATOR] Sympathy begins
to awaken in a rebellious soul

458
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:03,000
and the gears of
destiny begin to turn.

459
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:05,833
Next time:
The King and the Sword.
