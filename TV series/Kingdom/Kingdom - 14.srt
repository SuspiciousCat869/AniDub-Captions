[ZHENG] We are busy.

489
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:11,250
We have not got the time to
be concerned about you.

490
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:13,291
[WANG YI giggles]

491
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:15,458
[WANG YI] I simply came
to take your life.

492
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:17,750
Do you understand?

493
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:53,583
[WANG YI] What kind of king

494
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:57,000
does Your Highness
aim to be exactly, then?

495
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:59,250
[NARRATOR] A young King
staring down the future.

496
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:02,083
Can he become the light that
brightens a war-torn world?

497
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:04,208
Next Time: "The
Qualities of a King."
