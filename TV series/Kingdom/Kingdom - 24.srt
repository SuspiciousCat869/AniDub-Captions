00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:17,083
[XIN] Sorry, Diao, but I'm
heading out for a while.

3
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:18,208
[DIAO] Where to?

4
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:20,583
Eh... somewhere or other.

5
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:22,791
Well, should I expect to
see you back for dinner?

6
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:23,875
Nope.

7
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:25,083
When, then?

8
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:26,916
Beats me. I might just
end up skipping out

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,833
and heading on
to the next big fight,

10
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:30,750
but I guess
I'm not really sure.

11
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:33,333
What do you mean,
"you don't really know?"

12
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:35,000
Well, see ya later!

00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:44,291
[NARRATOR] Ancient China...

15
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:48,125
The time of the sages was over,
swept away by base human greed.

16
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:50,875
Over five centuries,
an endless storm of war,

17
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:53,583
hatred, and strife
raged across the land.

18
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:55,166
Over a hundred
nations fell,

19
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,541
winnowed away until
only seven remained.

20
00:00:57,625 --> 00:01:00,083
Now, from Qin,
the westernmost kingdom,

21
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:02,791
a great wind of history
is about to blow.

22
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:05,583
This is the tale of a
nameless boy and a young King

23
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:08,333
who ran the gauntlet
in this age of strife.

Hey, good mornin', Yuan!

27
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,625
Uh, yes, good morning.

28
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,375
Why are you here so early, sir?

29
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:55,750
I need your help.

30
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:57,083
[XIN] I kinda
need you to take me

31
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,625
on a little field trip today.

32
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,125
A field trip?

33
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,791
[YUAN] Well, sir, where are
we going for this "trip?"

34
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,041
[XIN]
General Wang Yi's castle!

35
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:11,958
[YUAN] Uh! General Wang Yi?!

36
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,541
[YUAN]
N-No! We can't go there!

37
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,250
I'm turning us around
right now!

38
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,166
[XIN] What? Why?!

39
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,958
Come on, Yuan,
you're supposed to be here

40
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:21,708
to serve and obey me, just like
the Royal Court told you to.

41
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,125
I know, but not there.

42
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:25,625
That's the one place
we can't go!

43
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,083
[XIN]
Ugh! What's the big deal?

44
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,541
It's not like you're too busy!

45
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,708
No, sir, it's not
an issue with being busy!

46
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:33,708
I-It's just the sort of place
we need to stay far away from!

47
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,541
They say you go near it
without permission,

48
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:38,458
you can only blame
yourself for getting killed!

49
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:41,625
Rumor has it all kinds of
people have disappeared!

50
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,500
Oh, c'mon,
it's just stupid gossip.

51
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:44,750
Giant Fatlips--

52
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,708
no, I guess it should
be General Fatlips...

53
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:49,250
Anyway, the point is, General
Fatlips isn't such a bad guy!

54
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,166
"General Fatlips?!"

55
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,916
Sir, do you realize
how dangerous it is

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
to talk like that?!

57
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,166
[XIN]
Here, you can have this, okay?

58
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,541
Wh-What is it, my lord?

59
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:58,708
Money.

60
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,458
I don't care
how much you pay me,

61
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:01,875
the answer is still no.

62
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,666
I have two
beautiful children.

63
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,541
I need to stay alive
for their sake!

64
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,666
Oh, really?

00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,541

[chuckles]

68
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,166
[YUAN] I don't suppose I
can make you reconsider?

69
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,208
[XIN] No way!

70
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,416
Are you sure?

71
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,333
Of course I'm sure!
It's the only way

72
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:31,625
I'm ever going to up my game
and get even stronger.

73
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,125
[sighs] Is that so...?

74
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:35,083
[XIN] Yep! Word is,
Wang Yi is one of

75
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,166
the world's greatest generals!

76
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,708
[YUAN] But still, sir...

77
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:42,666
After I got promoted
to squadron commander,

78
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,000
I went and asked around
at the Royal Court about him.

79
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,333
[ZHENG] Odd question.

80
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:51,291
What makes you so interested
in General Wang Yi?

81
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,000
When I talked to him
on the battlefield,

82
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,541
I realized something.

83
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:57,416
I could tell he was different
from the other generals.

84
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,833
I can't describe it.

85
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,583
It's like he feels
larger than life!

86
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,375
He's so overwhelming!

87
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,583
So I want to find out why.

88
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,791
Hm. I understand.

89
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,583
[ZHENG] Xin, it's not surprising
you feel that way about him--

90
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:10,791
it's only natural.

91
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:13,875
General Wang Yi
is no ordinary general.

92
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,875
He's one of Qin's
six great generals.

93
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,791
In fact, he's the
only one still alive.

94
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,416
Qin's "six great generals"?

95
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,625
[ZHENG] My great-grandfather,
King Zhao,

96
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,333
was known as a god
of the battlefield.

97
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,875
During his reign,
Qin was unquestionably

98
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,583
the most feared nation
in the Middle Kingdom.

99
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:33,708
It was said that whenever
Qin's armies began marching,

100
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,958
our enemy nations would
seal all of their gates.

101
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,250
Why do you think that was?

102
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,166
Because of
the six great generals?

103
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,416
That's right.
It was because King Zhao

104
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,166
had the foresight to appoint
six fearsome war leaders,

105
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,208
and those six went on a rampage
through every land and kingdom.

106
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,083
[ZHENG] At that time,
Qin was constantly

107
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,666
invading other kingdoms,

108
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,666
often fighting several
different nations at once.

109
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,750
The battlegrounds were
far away from Xianyang.

110
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:03,583
Therefore
King Zhao appointed...

111
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,208
Bai Qi,

112
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:06,958
Wang He,

113
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,666
Hu Shang,

114
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,500
Sima Cuo,

115
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,291
Liao...

116
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,750
...and lastly, Wang Yi.

117
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,916
He granted these
six generals a specific

118
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,958
but wide-ranging authority:

119
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,833
The freedom to wage war
as they saw fit.

120
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:24,250
In the field of battle,
the situation changes

121
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,583
moment by moment.

122
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,583
To that end,
these six generals were given

123
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:30,916
complete discretion
in warfare and combat.

124
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,500
From the other
kingdoms' perspective,

125
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,541
it must have seemed
as if six dragons had been

126
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:38,000
unleashed into the wild to
ravage the land as they pleased.

127
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,333
W-Wow...

128
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:43,041
[ZHENG] Indeed. King Zhao
and the six great generals

129
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:46,541
were bound together by a
loyalty as unwavering as iron.

130
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,166
That was why King Zhao
was able to make

131
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,041
the six-general system work.

132
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:54,791
Not like today. It's almost
like some distant legend.

133
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,166
[laughs]

134
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,333
What's so funny, Xin?

135
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:01,583
Well, just the fact that
it's so freakin' cool, Zheng!

136
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,416
[XIN] That settles it!

137
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:15,083
[XIN] Just you wait...
I'm coming, Wang Yi! Hm!

138
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,125
[yells]
Sir, wake up!

139
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,500
[yawns]

140
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,250
[YUAN] I-I think
we're almost there!

141
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,833
Huh--aaah!

142
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,208
You mean that's...?!

143
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,791
Yes! This is it!

144
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,416
[YUAN]
General Wang Yi's castle!

145
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:52,375
[XIN] Wang Yi's castle
is behind this wall.

146
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,708
[XIN]
Open up! Hey, open up!

147
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:56,916
[YUAN]
What are you doing?!

148
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,500
Please, sir, stop!
We'll both be killed!

149
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,000
What are you
so scared about, Yuan?

150
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,875
I keep telling you,
it's gonna be fine!

151
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:08,541
Open up! Let us in! Aaah!

152
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,375
It opened.

153
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:31,708
Uh... It closed.

154
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,583
[XIN] Hey, hold on
a second! What gives?!

155
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,000
It's me, Xin!

156
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,250
We met on Gong Yuan's hill!

157
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,166
Hey, Lieutenant!
Open the gate!

158
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,125
Ah... you see, sir?
We can't come uninvited.

159
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,500
Why don't we leave for now and
come back with a better plan?

160
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:48,291
[horse snorts]
[YUAN] Uuuh.

161
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,000
Huh?

162
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:52,708
[WANG YI] Hello there.

163
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:56,458
My goodness. Well if
it isn't our young Xin!

164
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:59,500
And what would happen to
bring you all the way out here?

165
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,416
[WANG YI chuckles]

166
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,500
We welcome you home, my lord.

167
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,625
We've been awaiting you.
How were the battle drills?

168
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,958
[WANG YI chuckles]
Oh, so-so.

169
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,958
[YUAN] B-Battle drills?!

170
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,791
That's from just drills?

171
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,625
What kind of training
do they do?

172
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:28,041
[XIN] Well... I'm glad
I caught him at home.

173
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:31,083
I did come on the spur
of the moment, after all.

174
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,041
[XIN] Wh-Why is it
so hard to catch my breath

175
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:36,625
around him, though?

176
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,750
I've already met him once,
but I still feel overwhelmed

177
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:41,000
just lookin' at him.

178
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,541
He was one of
the six generals

179
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,333
who once terrified the world.

180
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,666
Were they really
just this amazing?

181
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:50,750
And this... This is what
a general's castle is like?!

182
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,125
[XIN chuckles]
Are you seeing this, Piao?

183
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,833
The great generals
we want to be like

184
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:57,541
are larger than life,
and so are their castles!

185
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:00,250
And one day, this'll be us!

186
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,916
[chuckles]

187
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,125
[XIN] U-Uh...

188
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,291
[YUAN]
Wh-Why are we in the bath?

189
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:14,583
Now then, did you have
some business with me?

190
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,166
[WANG YI] We're about to
begin the second stage

191
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:20,333
of our training exercises,
so you will have to be brief.

192
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,833
Sir, I have come here
to ask you a favor.

193
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,958
Teach me to be strong like you.

194
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,958
[chuckles] Oh, I see.

195
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,791
I'd assumed
you wanted to start a bit of

196
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,125
mm-mm-mm with me.

197
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,541
What do you mean
by that, sir?

198
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:33,625
[WANG YI chuckles]

199
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:36,250
I'm only joking. Aren't I, Teng?

200
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,833
[TENG] Yes, sir.

201
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,500
[WANG YI] Seeking
instruction from a mentor

202
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,541
is a commendable purpose.

203
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:45,083
It seems our young Xin
has matured a little bit.

204
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,375
Still, showing up
at my home unannounced

205
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:51,625
shows me you still lack
a healthy sense of prudence.

206
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,541
When it comes down to it,
I have absolutely

207
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:56,291
no obligation to look
after you or teach you.

208
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:59,625
After all, we've only met
once before, haven't we?

209
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,958
Given your history with him,
wouldn't it make more sense

210
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,125
to have Lord Changwen
be your instructor?

211
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,166
[XIN] Lord Changwen
isn't good enough!

212
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,333
I want the world's greatest
general to train me.

213
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:09,958
I won't settle for less!

214
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,541
[ALL gasp]

215
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,458
[XIN] I know you don't have any
obligation to help me out, sir.

216
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:14,875
I understand that.

217
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,375
But I would help you, too!

218
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:19,791
[WANG YI] Hmm. And what
advantage could you give me?

219
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,208
[XIN] Teach me,
and I'll get good enough

220
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,625
to be your
right-hand man in no time!

221
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,708
The more tough commanders
you have on your side,

222
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:28,291
the bigger and better battles
you'll be able to stage!

223
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,541
There's your advantage!

224
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,958
X-Xin, sir!
What are you thinking?!

225
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,666
Your boasting is going
way, way too far!

226
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,916
[YUAN]
Y-You're gonna get us killed.

227
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,250
[WANG YI chuckles]
It's like they say,

228
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:42,125
the only cure for stupidity
is a nice dose of death.

229
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,916
[YUAN] O-Oh, no...

230
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,166
Very well, then.
If you're resolved,

231
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,583
then leave the baths with us
and prepare yourself.

232
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,791
[SOLDIERS gasp]

233
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,416
Does that mean I get to
join your training?!

234
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,875
[WANG YI chucles]
No, it doesn't.

235
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,416
Don't look so glum.

236
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,291
I'm going to take you somewhere
even more fun, my young Xin.

237
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,208
[XIN] Huh?

238
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:10,208
[YUAN] Wh-Where do you
think he's taking us?

239
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,750
And why did I have to
get dragged along?!

240
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,416
I have two beautiful children
who need their father!

241
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,458
Ah, Yuan,
man up already. Come on.

242
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:21,541
[chuckles]

243
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,250
[WANG YI] Well, if there's
anything you would

244
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,125
like to know from me,
feel free to ask.

245
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,583
As I said before,
one doesn't get the chance

246
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,791
to have a conversation
with me very often,

247
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,750
so don't waste it.

248
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,500
Then could you please
tell us more about

249
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,541
the legendary six generals?

250
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,916
Hm. Hm-hmmm.

251
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,791
[chuckles]

252
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:43,875
I'm impressed that
you know such an old story!

253
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,708
[WANG YI] It's a surprise
to hear you ask about

254
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:47,708
something like that,
young Xin.

255
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:50,083
[XIN] When I visited Zheng
in the Royal Court,

256
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,291
he told me all about how
Zhao created that system

257
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,166
with the six generals.

258
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,541
A system?

259
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,750
It seems that both you
and the king are laboring

260
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:01,041
under a slight misunderstanding
about how we used to work.

261
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,875
Misunderstanding?

262
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:10,791
[yelling]

263
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,333
[WANG YI]
From the very beginning,

264
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,125
the six of us used to sweep
through countless battlefields,

265
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:18,041
slaying countless
enemies in our wake.

266
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:21,000
As a result, our military
fame spread throughout

267
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,166
all the lands of
the Middle Kingdom,

268
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,875
until all we had to do
was approach an enemy,

269
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,958
and he would prostrate
himself before us

270
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,291
and surrender his castle.

271
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:33,250
For real?!
They all knew of you?!

272
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,583
[WANG YI] When he saw this,
King Zhao decided to

273
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:38,291
establish the six-general
system, so that it would be

274
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,250
even easier
for us to operate.

275
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:43,625
In other words, we were six
exceptionally strong warriors

276
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,083
far before the system.

277
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,541
You had it
the wrong way 'round.

278
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:48,833
Isn't that right, Teng?

279
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:51,208
Quite. It is meaningless
to create a system

280
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,250
without substance
to back it up.

281
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,166
[WANG YI] Young Xin,
when you mentioned the six

282
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,666
great generals earlier,
you called us legendary,

283
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,791
did you not?

284
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,333
Uh... Yes, sir.

285
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,291
[WANG YI] You're right in saying
that we've become a legend,

286
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:05,500
but do you have
any idea as to why?

287
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:06,708
No.

288
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,333
I rather thought not.

289
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:12,250
Well then let me
enlighten you. Mhmmm.

290
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:16,041
[WANG YI] It's true that there
are still several people in Qin

291
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,958
who have the title of "general."

292
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,333
Unfortunately, however,
there is not a single one

293
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:23,083
among them who is worthy
of being referred to

294
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,166
as equal to the six greats.

295
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,958
Sadly, that meant
there were no generals

296
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,625
worthy of succeeding us
when all of us were gone.

297
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,875
But the people still
remember our strength,

298
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,250
even after all this time,
and they hold our memory

299
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,500
in utmost respect.

300
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:39,791
That is why we are
a "legend" to this very day.

301
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,625
[XIN] Wow...
This guy's the real thing!

302
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:46,375
He really is one of the world's
most amazing generals!

303
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:47,750
[WANG YI] And you?

304
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,375
Do you want to become a
general as well, young Xin?

305
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:53,416
[XIN] Yeah, one of
the best in history!

306
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,041
Ah--hm!

307
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:59,208
[WANG YI] So you want to climb
up to my level and be my equal?

308
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:07,333
[PIAO and XIN grunting]

309
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:13,833
[BOTH panting]

310
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:15,416
[PIAO] Listen to me, Xin.

311
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,125
One day, we'll become the
world's greatest generals.

312
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:21,875
Our names will
go down in history!

313
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:24,333
[XIN] The world's
greatest generals...

314
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:27,333
[XIN]
No, I won't be equal to you.

315
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,166
[WANG YI] Hm...?

316
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,958
I'm gonna surpass you!

317
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,666
I am gonna become
the strongest general

318
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,958
in the entire world.

319
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,083
My name'll
go down in history!

320
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,916

321

[grunts]

322
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:50,541
[WANG YI chuckles]

323
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,666
The strongest in
the whole world?

324
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,041
[WANG YI laughs]

325
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,291
[WANG YI]
What do you think, Teng?

326
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:58,000
[TENG] Sir,
I'm stricken speechless.

327
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,083
[WANG YI] Arrogant stupidity
taken to that extreme

328
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,791
is a talent in its own right,
my dear young Xin.

329
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,625
[WANG YI laughs]

330
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:07,250
Very well.
I've decided I like you.

331
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,041
But it will take
a lot of work for you

332
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,750
to make your foolish
dream happen, you know.

333
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,375
And it's work you'll
be risking your life for.

334
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:17,750
I know that. That is why
I came to you, General.

335
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,791
Oh, then you think you're
prepared for that risk?

336
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,333
Of course I am!

337
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,041
[XIN] I don't care
how brutal it'll be.

338
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,250
I'll get it done,
just you watch!

339
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:29,958
Please, take me on as
your pupil, General Wang Yi!

340
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,416
[WANG YI] Mmmm... no.

341
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:33,708
[XIN] Huh?

342
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,666
[yells]

343
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,625
Sir!

344
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:42,333
[XIN continues yelling]

345
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:48,833
Hey man, what gives?!

346
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,333
[YUAN] G-General!

347
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:53,916
What was the meaning of this?
This is excessive!

348
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,625
"What's the meaning of this?"

349
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm giving him training,
like he asked.

350
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:01,083
I fail to see what part
of that was educational.

351
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:04,291
What are you talking about?
Of course it is.

352
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:05,625
[WANG YI laughs]

353
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:08,000
[distant yelling]

354
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:11,333
[WANG YI] Your training
begins now, young Xin!

355
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,791
[XIN] A battlefield?

356
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,666
[WANG YI] This strip
of barren land is actually

357
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,750
one of several
stateless areas within Qin.

358
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,541
[YUAN] A stateless area?

359
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,791
[WANG YI] This wilderness
isn't fertile enough for crops,

360
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,000
so Qin has
largely abandoned it.

361
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,416
Due to its "free" status,

362
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,958
many people from fallen nations
and tribes forced out of

363
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:33,041
their homelands by
war end up drifting here.

364
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,791
And now, they are
fighting amongst themselves

365
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,416
like cats and dogs for control

366
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,958
of this little
piece of wasteland.

367
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:42,458
Needless to say,
they're all incurable fools.

368
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,791
[WANG YI] Young Xin!

369
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:45,958
Huh?

370
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,208
Let's see if
you have what it takes

371
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,250
to conquer this land.

372
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,208
[XIN] Conquer it?

373
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:52,666
[YUAN]
Th-That's impossible, General!

374
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,250
What can he do in there
all by himself?!

375
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,041
He's just one warrior!

376
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:59,375
Oh, I'm not looking for a
one-man swordsmanship display.

377
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,166
Why do you think
I took his sword from him

378
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,125
while he wasn't looking?

379
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,458
[XIN] Huh?!

380
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,208
[WANG YI] Young Xin!
The community you fell into

381
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,083
belongs to the Nanba tribe.

382
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:12,291
They're the weakest of the ten
tribes living in this region.

383
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:13,833
They have a small population.

384
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,666
I would estimate around
a hundred people.

385
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,541
[XIN] A hundred?

386
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:20,583
Is he saying that before I can
become a squadron commander,

387
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,625
I gotta lead
these guys in battle?

388
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:26,208
Is this... General Wang
Yi's brand of training?

389
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,916
[ELDERLY MAN 24A]
They broke through!

390
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,916
O-Oh gosh, they're coming!

391
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,250
That's their defensive line?
Only old folks and women!

392
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,375
Remember, everyone,
this is our land!

393
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,041
And I'll defend it
with my life!

394
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,250

Mmhmmm...

Huh? Who the hell are you?!

404

Old guys,
get into teams of five

405
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,291
and work together to
kill them one at a time!

406

Women, leave the front line
and back us up with spears!

407

Hey, you over there.

408
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,208
Pass on this message
to young Xin, will you?

409
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,583
Tell him I'll train him
after he's finished

410
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:15,875
conquering this land.

411
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,708
[YUAN] What?!
I'm going down there, too?!

412
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,416
Oh, don't you want to?

413
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,083
Well, if you
really want to do things

414
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,916
the more difficult
and painful way,

415
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,291
I could always just
kick you off the cliff, too.

416
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:28,416
No-no, thank you.
I'll climb down myself.

417
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,958
[WANG YI] And tell him
that if he has trouble

418
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,625
with those pathetic enemies,

419
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:34,333
he can forget about me
giving him any training.

00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:49,458
Did you just
say something, boy?

474
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,875
Well, I guess your ears
work okay, at least.

475
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:54,125
Mouth off while
you still can, you brat!

476
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:56,291
[yells]

477
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,625
[XIN] Damn,
this guy isn't all talk.

478
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:03,166
And I can't sword-fight
with an old spear.

479
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,500
[XIN] Okay!

480
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:07,791
[XIN yells]

481
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:11,583
[ALL gasp]

482
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:15,166
[BOTH struggling]

483
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,041
Did you think you could win
with that little trick?

484
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:20,583
[XIN] Ugh! I didn't
stab him hard enough!

485
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:23,291
Time to die, boy!

486
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,541
[squelch]
[XIAO DING groans]

487
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:27,458
You old bastards...

488
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:29,625
Now's your chance! Attack!

489
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:31,500
[ALL yell]

490
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,875
[XIAO DING] I-Impossible!

491
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:36,541
[ELDERLY MAN 24H] Now!

492
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,041
--[YUAN] Sir!
--[XIN] Yuan.

493
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:46,125
Guys, they're on the run!
We can't miss this chance!

494
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:47,458
[XIN] Everybody follow me!

495
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:49,375
We're gonna go
and rout the enemy!

496
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:52,875
[cheering]

497
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:54,750
[WANG YI] Do you suppose these
opponents were too weak

498
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:56,541
for his first fight, Teng?

499
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:59,291
Yes, sir. They're folding
far too easily.

500
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:02,041
[WANG YI chuckles]
We're just getting started.

501
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:05,583
My dear young Xin,
your first lesson begins here.

502
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:08,208
You'll learn how hard
it is to lead an army,

503
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:11,958
and how strong fighting
as a group can make you.

504
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:15,250
General Wang Yi...
you just wait.

505
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:19,416
I give you my word...
I will conquer this land!

506
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:53,666
[LORD CHANGWEN]
There is one such man.

507
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,416
The most powerful
of Qin's warriors,

508
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,750
powerful in both
offense and defense.

509
00:24:57,833 --> 00:25:00,000
[NARRATOR] Qin faces
its greatest crisis yet.

510
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:01,583
he dormant bird
breaks his long slumber

511
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,083
and goes into action.

512
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:05,125
Next Time: "Commission."
