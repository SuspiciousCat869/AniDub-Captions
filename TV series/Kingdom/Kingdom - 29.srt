1
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:17,833
So then... did my lord
give your squadron

2
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:21,083
an actual name, young boy?

3
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:23,166
Fei Xin Force.

4
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:28,666
[GAN YANG]
Xin of the Fei Xin Force

5
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:32,291
has taken the head of
the Zhao general Feng Ji!

6
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:38,208
[yelling]

7
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:41,583
Very well done, Xin.

8
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:45,625
You truly never
cease to amaze me.

9
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:47,333
I can't take all the credit.

10
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:50,166
You're the one who held off
the enemy infantry, Bi.

11
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,583
[YUAN] Sir!

12
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:54,291
You did it!
You really did it!

13
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:56,041
[XIN] Hey, the guys are okay!

14
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:58,291
[XIN] Sorry,
I gotta take a rain check.

15
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:02,166
I see, then...

16
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,666
You really are a leader now,
aren't you, Xin?

17
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:15,625
[WANG YI] This is
absolutely not the time

18
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,416
to let your mind
linger in the past.

19
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,541
Do you understand, young Xin?

20
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,250
General Wang Yi.

21
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:26,625
My goodness.

22
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:29,583
Your general is here to
personally show appreciation

23
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:32,416
for all of your efforts today.

24
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,791
Look a little bit happier
about it, won't you?

25
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:37,875
You're not being very sweet.

26
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:39,833
[WANG YI chuckles]

27
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:45,250
Young Xin, do you know
why I even gave your unit

28
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:47,000
an actual name?

29
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:49,875
Think about it.

30
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:52,416
[WANG YI] It was to
make you easier to remember,

31
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,250
for enemies and allies alike.

32
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:57,583
Enemies?

33
00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:59,916
When you finally killed Feng Ji,

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,583
Gan Yang declared the Fei Xin
Force's name and yours loudly.

35
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:11,833
Feng Ji was a renowned warrior.

36
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:15,833
As the one who slayed him,
your name will soon be known

37
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:19,708
to Zhao's armies and
the whole Middle Kingdom.

38
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:23,041
My name to the
whole Middle Kingdom?

39
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:25,375
[WANG YI]
However, it's only for a moment!

40
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:27,750
[laughs]

41
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,458
[XIN] A moment...

42
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:34,083
My name, even if
just for a moment...

43
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,250
[XIN] Okay, this works.

44
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,541
[XIN] If I keep
making this happen,

45
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:43,958
my name will leave its mark
all over the Middle Kingdom!

46
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,166
[XIN] That's how
I'm gonna become...

47
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,666
[XIN] ...the world's
greatest general!

48
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,666
[NARRATOR]
The time: The Spring &amp; Autumn

49
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,875
and Warring States periods.

50
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:04,750
The place: Qin.

51
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:08,333
Xin, a nameless boy,
met Zheng, a young King,

52
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,958
distinguished himself in battle,

53
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,666
and rose to the rank
of squadron commander.

54
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,958
In the midst of this,

55
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:16,125
the neighboring
kingdom of Zhao invaded,

56
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:19,250
and Qin faced
unprecedented crisis.

57
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:22,583
What manner of battle will Wang
Yi wage as commanding general?

58
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:25,833
And what growth
will Xin accomplish?

59
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,083
[NARRATOR] The war
reached its second day.

60
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,541
Qin's army concentrated
its resources

61
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,458
on the battle in the center.

62
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,666
Today, that battle
would be the focus

63
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,875
and its leading player
would be Meng Wu.

64
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:21,041
This is the same as yesterday.

65
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,083
Foot soldiers, follow me!

66
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:29,875
[SOLDIERS cheering]

67
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:34,083
My, their spirits are high.

68
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,125
Teng, how many casualties

69
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:39,041
did Meng Wu's army
suffer yesterday?

70
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:42,125
Well, approximately
six hundred, I'm told.

71
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,791
[WANG YI] Six hundred...

72
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,916
For such a long
and fierce battle,

73
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,750
that seems like a
really small number.

74
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:52,375
I see, so that's it.

75
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,791
[MENG WU] Meng Wu Army, charge!

76
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:12,125
[SOLDIERS yelling]

77
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:15,333
Put the heavy
infantry diagonally.

78
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:21,541
It has started!

79
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,791
But at this rate...

80
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:27,916
Sir, will it be
the same as yesterday?

81
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,291
Not quite.

82
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:33,166
I believe we'll soon see
something very interesting.

83
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:41,750
[MENG WU] I have heard
of you extensively, Li Bai.

84
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:44,333
They say defensive battle
is your forte--

85
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:47,166
That you've never
been defeated.

86
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:51,791
The Middle Kingdom acknowledges
you as the "Defense General."

87
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,666
[MENG WU] Don't make me laugh!

88
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,625
[MENG WU] You've just been
blessed with weak opponents!

89
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:08,416
[DIAO] That diagonal formation
had held his force off,

90
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,750
but today they broke through!

91
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,833
What's going on?

92
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:16,000
Maybe he could have
done so yesterday as well

93
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,750
if he wanted to.

94
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:23,791
Then he chose
not to break through?

95
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:26,541
[DIAO] Why?

96
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,958
[TENG] He was training
his infantry?

97
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:31,250
[WANG YI] Yes.

98
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:34,375
Most of the Qin foot soldiers
that are in this campaign

99
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:35,666
were gathered in haste,

100
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,000
meaning that morale
was low and there was

101
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:42,291
a great gap between them
and Meng Wu's own cavalry.

102
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:45,708
Men cannot fight as
a single army in that state.

103
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,041
And so...

104
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,750
Yesterday he chose a method

105
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:54,000
that dodged going in deep
and kept Qin casualties low.

106
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,208
To us it seemed
Li Bai's formation

107
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,416
took the wind
out of his offensive,

108
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,625
but how must it have felt
to his foot soldiers?

109
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:05,125
[DIAO] Hmm... maybe
like they were the ones

110
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,125
attacking the enemy position

111
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:11,625
and the enemy was just
standing in place defending...

112
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:15,416
I get it! The infantry
got their confidence!

113
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,708
Greater confidence
equals higher morale.

114
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:22,458
Meng Wu's infantry is a
completely different force today

115
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,458
than it was yesterday.

116
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:30,041
[yelling]

117
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:33,541
[WANG YI]
Not bad, Meng Wu, not bad.

118
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,750
[ZHAO ZHUANG]
But still, it is not enough

119
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:41,041
to break past Li Bai's
defense, isn't it?

120
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:44,500
You really need to
show them just how fearsome

121
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:48,125
your formations are, Li Bai.

122
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,833
We'll use the Snake.

123
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:50,958
[LI BAI'S LIEUTENANT]
Yes, Sir!

124
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,000
Now what?

125
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:55,916
Li Bai's men are
changing formations!

126
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,833
[MENG YI] The last
of his diagonal formation

127
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,541
broke sideways
to thicken ranks

128
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,666
at the point of the charge...

129
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,375
[MENG YI] Meanwhile, the top
section made a sharp turn

130
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:07,416
and blanketed the turf
behind Meng Wu's army.

131
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,708
They are not in
defensive formation.

132
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:16,000
Li Bai's army means to surround
Meng Wu's and just destroy it.

133
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:20,416
[WANG YI] Oh, dear. Just when
it looked like you'd make it,

134
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,666
Li Bai turned out
to be a cut above you.

135
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,708
[chuckles]

136
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:30,291
[WANG YI] You're completely
surrounded now.

137
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:33,250
What is your next move, Meng Wu?

138
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:37,750
All troops,
continue the advance!

139
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:40,791
Now things are
getting interesting.

140
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,833
General, that man...

141
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,291
No matter. Keep going.

142
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:48,916
A single warrior
can only be so powerful.

143
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,750
[DIAO] It's no good! That way
of fighting can't last long,

144
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:56,208
no matter how strong
your dad is!

145
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,208
[DIAO] Meng Yi?

146
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:03,208
This is it.

147
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:06,041
[MENG YI]
My teacher told me once...

148
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:10,750
"To defeat a powerful warrior,
devise a strategy.

149
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:13,583
On a battlefield where
tons of soldiers fight,

150
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:16,250
strategy is everything.

151
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,833
But for that very
reason sometimes we long

152
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,958
to see the exact opposite."

153
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,458
[MENG YI] You and I
are witnessing that now:

154
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:31,166
[MENG YI] A warrior's power
outdoing strategy!

155
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,458
That damned monster...

156
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,833
We'll pull back for now!

157
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:46,708
[LI BAI] Meng Wu, you can
exercise all the power you want,

158
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:49,583
but it won't get in my head.

159
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:54,166
[MENG WU]
Bad assumption, Li Bai.

160
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:58,000
[MENG WU] I don't give
a damn about your fool head.

161
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,916
Meng Wu Army!

162
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,291
Lay them to waste!

163
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:06,750
[SOLDIERS yelling]

164
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,208
[WANG YI chuckles]

165
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,833
They may be straggling soldiers
left without a general,

166
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,583
but there are
at least ten thousand.

167
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:18,333
If he gets rid of them
for us, it will be a big help.

168
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:19,791
Right, Teng?

169
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,333
Quite.

170
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,458
As the army who needs to shrink
its numerical disadvantage,

171
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,750
this is a great harvest.

172
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:28,458
[WANG YI]
Meng Wu, the world says

173
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:33,833
you're a self-satisfied loose
cannon on the battlefield, 

174
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:37,625
but I see the real you is
something quite different.

175
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,250
[WANG YI] Still, I will
watch another battle or two

176
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:45,291
before I judge your power.

177
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,500
[LORD CHANGWEN]
He forces Li Bai,

178
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,625
known for his strong defense,

179
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:55,500
to attack Meng Wu, Qin's
strongest offensive warrior.

180
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:59,375
A tactic not only sensible,
but quite playful, even--

181
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:02,083
Reminiscent of Wang Yi.

182
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:06,500
[ZHENG] But the fact remains
that we're at a disadvantage.

183
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:07,958
[LORD CHANGWEN]
This is Wang Yi.

184
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,708
I'm sure he's already
planned his next move.

185
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:15,666
[LORD CHANGWEN] Nonetheless...

186
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,541
The battling will
continue to be harsh.

187
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,583
[DIAO yawns]

188
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:26,458
[DIAO] Your dad really put up a
heck of a fight, huh, Meng Yi?

189
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:28,541
[MENG YI] Yeah.

190
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,666
I mean he brought
the enemy to its knees

191
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,541
on sheer force...

192
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:38,583
[MENG YI] That isn't something
easy for me to admit, though.

193
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,708
[DIAO] Huh...

194
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:43,750
You don't seem
too happy about it.

195
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,500
How come?

196
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:48,500
This is the era of strategy.

197
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:49,875
He is out of step
with the times,

198
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:53,666
hung up solely on individual
sheer fighting strength.

199
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,291
[DIAO] But um, your dad dares
to follow that path anyway,

200
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,833
am I right?

201
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,666
[DIAO] Gotta support him...

202
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:12,750
[MENG YI] Of course...
I support him.

203
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,375
[MENG YI] I decided
to become a strategist

204
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:22,083
because I wanted to make up for
the areas where he's lacking.

205
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:25,791
[MENG YI]
But I suppose I didn't need to.

206
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,750
[MENG YI]
Watching him, I realized:

207
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:31,083
Meng Wu is strong, and he's
not lacking in anything.

208
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:38,333
It looks like this war will
revolve around my father,

209
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,083
Meng Wu, for a while.

210
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,875
[NARRATOR] The third day.

211
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,708
[NARRATOR]
To oppose Meng Wu's army,

212
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:58,458
Zhao's forces
changed battle arrays.

213
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:03,833
[NARRATOR] Li Bai and Gongsun
Long's armies joined forces

214
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:05,500
and countered Meng Wu's army

215
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,916
with their
collective 40,000 men.

216
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,875
[NARRATOR]
Nevertheless, Meng Wu...

217
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,375
[NARRATOR]
...remained unstoppable.

218
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,541
[NARRATOR] The presence
of the exceptional power

219
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:24,875
that was Meng Wu

220
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:28,291
was about to radically
change the war situation.

221
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,166
Gongsun Long! Li Bai!

222
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:45,250
[SHE MENG] What exactly
are you two doing?

223
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,583
Don't place blame on them.

224
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,208
This is my fault.

225
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:52,333
I failed to recognize
Meng Wu's power.

226
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:54,250
Then fix this by
outmaneuvering him

227
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,833
like the tactician
you are, Zhao Zhuang.

228
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:59,125
I plan to.

229
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:02,041
We'll strike
Meng Wu in full force.

230
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,541
[laughs]

231
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:07,750
[ZHAO ZHUANG]
We will lure him in firstly

232
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:10,250
by taking exactly the same
formations tomorrow,

233
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:13,166
to mean we'll fight
the same way.

234
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,375
[ZHAO ZHUANG]
When he makes his charge,

235
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:20,208
I want She Meng and Wan Ji to
attack from the rear and flank.

236
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,166
How do we respond
if another army

237
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,916
takes advantage of
that time to attack us?

238
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,750
[ZHAO ZHUANG]
No need to consider that.

239
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:31,708
We will slay Meng Wu
before they make a move!

240
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,083
[MENG WU] You want to talk?
About what?

241
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,666
No need to act menacing.

242
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,666
Please just have a seat.

243
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,916
I'll stand! Get to the point!

244
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,500
[WANG YI chuckles]

245
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:51,208
[WANG YI] Very well.
I'll skip the formalities, then.

246
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,666
I anticipate that Zhao's armies

247
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,958
will make a real
drastic move tomorrow.

248
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,583
[MENG WU] What do I care?

249
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,750
[WANG YI] I had faith
that you'd say just that.

250
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,083
[WANG YI] Normally we'd
consider the enemy's next moves

251
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,416
and set up
various countermeasures,

252
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:11,666
but in this particular case,
I wholeheartedly agree with you.

253
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,041
What are you trying to say?

254
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:18,500
Now is the time
for us to attack.

255
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:27,000
[NARRATOR] The next morning,
the Fei Xin Force

256
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:30,958
was incorporated into the
Fourth Army led by Gan Yang.

257
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:36,416
[GAN YANG]
Here you are, Fei Xin Force.

258
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:41,000
[GAN YANG] I expect heroic
fighting out of all of you.

259
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,291
[FEI XIN FORCE]
Y-Yes, Sir!

260
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,791
Get ready, boy,

261
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:48,416
today's battle will be
another fierce one.

262
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,416
That's how I like 'em!

263
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,375
[NARRATOR] And so the fourth day
of battle was about to begin.

264
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:02,541
[NARRATOR] On this battlefield
filled with heroic warlords,

265
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:05,875
each side with a hidden agenda,
the one to set things off

266
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:09,916
was of course... this man.

267
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,916
Men... Let's charge!

268
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,333
[SOLDIERS yelling]

269
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:22,916
[WAN JI]
Meng Wu has made his move.

270
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,958
I'll be paying you
a visit soon.

271
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,250
Look forward to it!

272
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:31,166
[ZHAO ZHUANG]
Not yet, Wan Ji, She Meng.

273
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,333
Move when Meng Wu's army

274
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:37,583
passes the halfway point exactly
between their side and our side.

275
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,291
[ZHAO ZHUANG] Now!

276
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,541
First Army, move out!

277
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:48,541
[SOLDIERS yelling]

278
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:49,625
What?!

279
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:50,791
Another central army

280
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,875
is making its move
right now, too?!

281
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:55,333
[LONG GUO]
Second Army, into battle!

282
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,583
[LIN FANG] Third Army, let's go!

283
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:03,583
[TONG JIN] Fifth Army, charge!

284
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,375
Qin's main army, as well?

285
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,958
Damn these country bumpkins!

286
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:11,416
They have changed
their strategy!

287
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,041
Do not fall behind!

288
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:18,083
[GAN YANG]
Fourth Army, here we go!

289
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:24,541
And what they want is...

290
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:28,875
[WANG YI]
...the Zhao army headquarters.

291
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:36,458
Whaddya figure
it's like, Wei Ping?

292
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,125
What do I figure what?

293
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,666
Being on the
other end of this attack

294
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,416
that's taking even
our breath away!

295
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:53,958
[ZHAO ZHUANG] We're the ones
who crossed their borders

296
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,750
and then invaded...

297
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,875
Your Qin dogs should
be on the defense.

298
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:03,291
And yet you're attacking us
with all your armies, Wang Yi?

299
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,833
[DIAO]
Things are getting pretty crazy!

300
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:11,041
Is this really
a good idea, though?

301
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,416
[ZHAO ZHUANG] There will be
absolutely no coming back

302
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,833
from this if you fail, Wang Yi!

303
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:23,708
Oh, no, we won't fail.
Will we, Meng Wu?

304
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:35,625
Piece of cake!
This one'll be an easy win, Xin!

305
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:36,791
Yeah!

306
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,000
They are so scared
of Meng Wu's army,

307
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:42,250
they're paying
no attention to us!

308
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:46,250
We can take this chance to
go straight for headquarters!

309
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:54,125
A unit from the left
made it into the mountains!

310
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,666
Can they actually storm
Zhao army headquarters

311
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,791
in one single charge?

312
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,208
[MENG YI]
Do you really think so?

313
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:07,708
Well, no.

314
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:10,541
The enemy saw them and
didn't even try to stop them

315
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,125
whatsoever.

316
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:14,875
Which means...

317
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:19,541
[SOLDIERS yelling]

318
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:22,625
[WEI PING]
Wh-What the heck is this?

319
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:34,000
I-It might...

320
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:38,166
It might as...
as well be a fortress!

321
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:47,791
Hey guys, no turning back!

322
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:51,500
If we get through here,
we're at headquarters!

323
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:55,625
Our only choice is to advance.
Expect to shed blood!

324
00:20:57,166 --> 00:21:00,166
Fei Xin Force, forward!

325
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,833
[ZHAO ZHUANG] My original plan
was to reduce Qin's numbers

326
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:06,541
through repeated battles,

327
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:12,166
then ask Pang Nuan to come in,
and then take Wang Yi's head...

328
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,666
But now, it turns out
that in just four days,

329
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:19,625
we are the ones whose
headquarters are being stormed.

330
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:22,208
I was confident
that not even Wang Yi

331
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:24,833
could best me
in matters of strategy.

332
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,083
But I guess I'm
no match for him...

333
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:30,083
However, I'm not finished.

334
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:33,541
This battle won't end yet!

335
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:39,000
We're moving the headquarters!

336
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,625
[NARRATOR] Zhao Zhuang's order
was immediately relayed

337
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,416
to the front lines.

338
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,666
He's mobilizing headquarters?

339
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,625
You're taking the
plunge early, Zhao Zhuang.

340
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,375
But under these
battle conditions...

341
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,833
It's probably a wise decision.

342
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:58,208
[ZHAO ZHUANG] We can't afford
to lose any more of our soldiers

343
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:01,666
until we launch
our next strategy!

344
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:05,500
[ZHAO ZHUANG] Whatever I have to
do, I'm in this war to win it!

345
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:10,125
[XIN] Huh? What?!

346
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:12,416
What is going on?

347
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:23,208
[XIN]
Zhao seems to be retreating?!

348
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:27,583
[NARRATOR] The tides of war
were on the verge

349
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:30,250
of yet another sudden turn!

350
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:40,791
[grunting]

351
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:42,083
[crashing noise]

352
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:49,208
[KAINE] Shouldn't we have taken
the long way on horseback?

353
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:52,958
[LI MU] No, I heard
this way would be faster.

354
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:02,916
[LI MU] See?
Yep, they're going at it!

355
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,041
We did make it in time.

356
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:06,958
[LI MU]
Take a look at that, Kaine.

357
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:08,875
[KAINE] Oh, I'm looking.

358
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:16,166
Okay, everyone!

359
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:19,625
Li Mu has just arrived!

360
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:54,625
[YUAN] I have to go help them!

361
00:24:54,708 --> 00:24:57,500
Our men are all dying!

362
00:24:57,583 --> 00:24:59,125
[NARRATOR] Is this a nightmare?

363
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:02,791
There is no escape from
this one-sided destruction.

364
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:05,333
Next Time: "An Act of God."
