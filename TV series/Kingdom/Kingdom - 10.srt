1
00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:15,000
[ZHENG]
We're here, at last.

2
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:17,500
It took us an
awful long time.

3
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:20,166
[DIAO] Then...
you're saying that's...

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,500
That's right.

5
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:26,416
That... that is the
capital of Qin... Xianyang.

6
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,416
[NARRATOR]
Ancient China...

7
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,541
The time of the sages was over,
swept away by base human greed.

8
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:40,000
Over five centuries,
an endless storm of

9
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:43,250
war, hatred, and strife
raged across the land.

10
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:44,708
Over a hundred nations fell,

11
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:47,083
winnowed away until
only seven remained.

12
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:49,583
Now, from Qin,
the westernmost kingdom,

13
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:52,208
a great wind of history
is about to blow.

14
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:55,000
This is the tale of a
nameless boy and a young King

15
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:58,000
who ran the gauntlet
in this age of strife.

16
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:37,833
[XIN]
Wh-What is that?

17
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:40,541
It's so huge, I can't even
make out which part is which!

18
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:41,916
Holy crap!

19
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,416
Stop falling to pieces, dummy!

20
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,666
A place that big?

21
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,750
I mean... who could...
why would...

22
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,916
How could we do that?!

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,416
[DIAO]
Calm down!

24
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,958
That's impressive.

25
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,958
Hey, Zheng, you're telling
me that we're gonna

26
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,208
try to storm that?!

27
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,708
We are.

28
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,875
How the heck are we supposed to
attack something so huge?

29
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,833
I can't even see the far
edges of it from here!

30
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,833
Stop raising a fuss.

31
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:02,750
[XIN]
Huh?

32
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:03,916
[ZHENG]
Can you see further in?

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,500
There's a row of
larger buildings

34
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:06,708
standing out from the rest.

35
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,791
[XIN]
Huh? Yeah, I see 'em.

36
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,833
[ZHENG]
That's the Royal Court.

37
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,958
Our reports say that
news of this rebellion

38
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,541
hasn't been publicized
outside its walls.

39
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,125
That means those
outside the Court

40
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:19,833
aren't tainted by
my half-brother.

41
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,458
[DIAO] So that means
we only need to strike

42
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,458
at the Royal Court,
and nothing else?

43
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:24,291
[ZHENG]
Correct.

44
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,541
[XIN]
Hold on a second!

45
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,625
The Royal Court's still
smack dab in the middle

46
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:28,500
of Xianyang, isn't it?

47
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:29,875
[ZHENG]
Of course it is.

48
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:32,000
Xianyang has tier
after tier of walls,

49
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,750
as well as residences
for the nobility,

50
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,416
warriors, and commoners,

51
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,708
with the Court at the
center of it all.

52
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:41,291
In short, Xianyang itself
is an enormous castle.

53
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,916
[XIN] Oh good, you at
least acknowledge it.

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,458
Well, now that's
been cleared up,

55
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,916
how do we get through
all that to the Court?

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,333
[LORD CHANGWEN]
That's why we spoke about

57
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:50,875
creating a stratagem.

58
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,500
[XIN] That's easy to say,
but there's more

59
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,666
than just those high walls!

60
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,625
There's a legion of troops
waiting in there, too, right?

61
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,916
[LORD CHANGWEN]
That's the key to our plan.

62
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,833
80,000, eh?

63
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:15,000
[JIE SHI] That's not
nearly enough, Si Shi.

64
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,833
[SI SHI]
My humble apologies, my lord.

65
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,625
We still haven't found
the Royal Seal,

66
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,916
so this was the greatest number
we could muster in time.

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,041
[JIE SHI] You do not need
some worthless Royal Seal

68
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,125
just to muster troops, you fool!

69
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,500
Use bribes, use threats,

70
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:29,125
use whatever means
necessary to light fires

71
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,875
under the rear ends of the
cowards playing wait-and-see!

72
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:33,541
This is no defensive war.

73
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:34,958
We have but one aim:

74
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:38,375
To annihilate Lü Buwei's
200,000 men!

75
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,583
And to do that,
we are going to need

76
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,375
far more men than this.

77
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:46,291
Raise another 100,000
troops immediately!

78
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:51,333
Do not disappoint me again.
Is that clear, Si Shi?

79
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,583
[SI SHI growls]

80
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:58,416
[XIN]
80,000 is too few?

81
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,833
[LORD CHANGWEN]
Yes.

82
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,500
In his initial plans,
he almost certainly counted on

83
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,833
raising an army
of about 400,000.

84
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,583
[LORD CHANGWEN] But only
80,000 responded to his call.

85
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:09,666
Mark my words, Jie Shi
will be feeling worried.

86
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,625
So if some troops
offering to support him

87
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,625
were to appear unexpectedly...

88
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:15,791
That would be us!

89
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,333
Yes.

90
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:20,000
Convince him we're allies and
have him invite us inside...

91
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:24,625
...then we can get past the
walls without any injury.

92
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:27,083
[XIN, DIAO]
Ohh...

93
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,666
Now... let's go!

94
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,250
[yawns]

95
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,541
Huh? Whoa!

96
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,416
[SENTRY 10A]
What is that?!

97
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,958
[ZHENG]
At long last.

98
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:52,916
Yang Duanhe, I am grateful
you're fighting by our side.

99
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,875
[YANG DUANHE] Words of
gratitude should be saved

100
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,750
for after the battle's won.

101
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,291
[ZHENG] After our victory,
I won't just give you words,

102
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:02,000
but a castle and a warm
welcome for your people.

103
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,833
[YANG DUANHE]
I'll look forward to it.

104
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,708
[JIE SHI] You say a
throng of mountain folk

105
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,250
appeared at the west gate?

106
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,041
[JIANG]
Yes, my lord.

107
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,125
[JIE SHI]
How many?

108
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,666
[JIANG]
Between two and three thousand.

109
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,166
They're strangely dressed,
but they're all

110
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,250
mounted and bearing weapons.

111
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,583
[JIANG] Still, they're
apparently showing

112
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,916
no signs of aggression.

113
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,791
Did they not send a messenger
to announce their intentions?

114
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:23,041
They did, but all he said
was that the mountain king

115
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,208
had come down from the hills
to renew the old alliance.

116
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,541
Then he returned to his troops.

117
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:30,708
[JIE SHI] The mountain king...
an alliance?

118
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,833
Makes you wonder if
that legion of 80,000

119
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,791
is gonna make a
sudden appearance.

120
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:36,916
Oh, like I wasn't
already nervous!

121
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Why do you keep saying
things like that?

122
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,291
Everything will be fine.

123
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,541
They'll take us up on it,
without a doubt.

124
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,750
[XIN]
I sure hope you're right!

125
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,833
[OFFICIAL 10A] If we're going
to confront Lü Buwei soon,

126
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:51,208
any gain in allies would
be welcome at this point!

127
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,708
It may only be 3,000 men,

128
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,541
but if they're descended from
the Horse &amp; Liquor forces,

129
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,083
they'll be a force
to be reckoned with!

[PO SHI]
Wait! Why would people

for so many years

suddenly seek to
renew an alliance?

be plotting something.

Are we about join hands

Huh...

Why have you made this decision
without consulting me first?

To seal a useful
alliance, my lord.

You said you would give me full
responsibility over governing,

Pitting rabid monkeys against
raccoon dogs, you mean?

158
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,875
[JIE SHI]
Just so, my lord.

159
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,083
[CHENG JIAO] Still, I refuse
to speak with monkeys.

160
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,541
You don't need to.

161
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:46,166
All you need to do is sit on
the throne as King of Qin.

162
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,500
Leave everything else
to me, your Minister.

163
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:54,458
[XIN]
Ha, ha! That was too easy!

164
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,625
Everything's going well for now.

165
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,625
[BI]
But just imagine...

166
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:00,541
What if we had had to
breach this many walls

167
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:01,750
in order to get in?

168
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,291
Frankly, the thought
of it gives me chills.

169
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:07,291
[XIN]
Even you think so, Bi, my man?

170
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:08,500
Of course I do.

171
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,666
Storming a stronghold
normally requires

172
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,166
two or three times
the enemy's numbers.

173
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,708
We're talking about
taking it with only 3,000.

174
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:18,625
You could call this the most
outlandish stratagem ever.

175
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,125
[XIN]
Really?

176
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,416
Now I'm kinda getting
all pumped up about it!

177
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,333
It's good that you're eager,
but don't get careless.

178
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,750
We may be outside
the Royal Court,

179
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,708
but this is still hostile turf.

180
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,125
Yeah, sure, I get that.

181
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,916
[DIAO]
Huh?

182
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,541
Look, Xin! It's the town!

183
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:43,250
[DIAO, XIN]
Whoa...

184
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,000
[BI]
Something's strange.

185
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,250
[XIN]
What is it, Bi, my man?

186
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,958
This is different from
the Xianyang I know.

187
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:52,291
There's a subtle tension
hanging in the air.

188
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,333
Do you think they might
be onto us already?

189
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:55,458
[LORD CHANGWEN]
I doubt that.

190
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,833
Look carefully among the crowds.

191
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,375
[XIN] There's a lot
of guys wearing black.

192
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,166
[BI]
They're gendarmes.

193
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,333
[XIN]
Gendarmes? What are those?

194
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:10,833
[BI] They're officials
who arrest people

195
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,666
who step out of line.
Now I see...

196
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,166
The prince's followers
and partisans

197
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,375
are keeping the people
of the city muzzled.

198
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:19,458
[LORD CHANGWEN]
Cheng Jiao's kingship

199
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:20,833
must be seen as legitimate

200
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,833
and enabled by the King's
"sudden demise,"

201
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:26,250
not as something usurped
or taken by force.

202
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,958
The bad rumors
leaking from court

203
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,791
must be firmly sealed
up before they spread.

204
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,791
According to the
reports from our spies,

205
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:35,125
anyone who speaks openly
about the Court now,

206
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,250
is immediately
arrested by gendarmes

207
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,000
and is never heard from again.

208
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,333
That's despicable.

209
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,166
[ZHENG]
That's only the beginning.

210
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,916
Both Cheng Jiao and
Jie Shi will stop at nothing

211
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,291
to achieve their aims.

212
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,333
This is no more than a
fraction of the oppression

213
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,291
those two will enact.

214
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,625
They're monkeys, aren't they?

215
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:57,750
Knock it off!

216
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,916
We have got orders
not to provoke them.

217
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,750
[ZUO CI]
Hey!

218
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,208
[GENDARME 10B]
Huh?

219
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,416
[ZUO CI]
You're in the way.

220
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,125
If you think you
can get away with

221
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,875
acting like that towards us...

222
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,333
[ZUO CI]
Huh?

223
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,375
[GENDARME 10A]
That's Zuo Ci! And Wei Xing.

224
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:13,666
They're upper-level
army officers.

225
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,833
And that third guy...

226
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,166
If he's being accompanied
by those two...

227
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,250
Then that man has got to be the
strong arm of Minister Jie Shi:

228
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,041
Si Shi!

229
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,083
You men can leave now.

230
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:29,041
[GENDARMES]
Yes, sir. By your leave!

231
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,041
Isn't the Minister acting
a bit too desperate

232
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,208
by inviting this
rabble to court?

233
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:36,666
I mean, it's just to get his
hands on a mere 3,000 troops.

234
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,125
It's not just 3,000.

235
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,833
That man there is the conqueror
of the mountain realm,

236
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:41,833
Yang Duanhe.

237
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,416
If we forge an
alliance with him,

238
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,500
we gain the support of
over 100,000 mountain folk.

239
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,000
[WEI XING]
I see.

240
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,750
The Minister made the decision
based on that expectation.

241
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,458
[SI SHI]
Yet one thing still troubles me.

242
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,875
Why now?

243
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:58,791
For hundreds of years
they've been isolated.

244
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,750
Why now have they
suddenly shown up?

245
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:04,708
Bah, my hand got dirty.

246
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,125
So, this is it?

247
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,166
The Royal Court.

248
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,625
[XIN] It's bigger than it looked
from the top of that cliff.

249
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,416
Guess that's a given...

250
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,583
What's wrong?

251
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,708
Are you finally losing
your nerve, Zheng?

252
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:41,125
I was thinking about
how it all began here.

253
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:45,125
At Court, Piao spoke
of nothing but you.

254
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,125
[XIN]
H-Huh?

255
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,708
His eyes used to gleam when
he was talking about you,

256
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,083
like he was showing
off his treasure.

257
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,500
He told me about the
training you two did,

258
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:57,875
about how you used an ox instead
of a horse to practice riding,

259
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:02,541
and about how you both dreamed
of becoming great generals.

260
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,125
Generals...

261
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,666
That's right!

262
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,791
We'll dress in golden armor,
and ride all across the Earth!

263
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,208
And in the end, 

264
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,541
we'll become the greatest
generals in all the world!

265
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,541
Yeah... the greatest generals!

266
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:18,291
And then, our names
will go down in history!

267
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,208
[ZHENG] If not for
Cheng Jiao's rebellion,

268
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:24,166
I never would have
met Piao, or you.

269
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:29,333
But then, Piao wouldn't
have died either.

270
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,875
[ZHENG] And now, the ringleaders
who started this rebellion

271
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:36,291
are on the other
side of this wall.

272
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,958
It's time to settle
things... Xin!

273
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,500
Yeah!

274
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,291
If things go wrong, don't die.

275
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,125
[XIN]
Me, die?

276
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,000
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

277
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,041
No way!

278
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,500
This is my first
step toward becoming

279
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:51,875
the world's greatest general!

280
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:54,291
You think I'm gonna
stumble now?!

281
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,416
[JIANG] Minister, why do
you not excuse yourself

282
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,208
from going to greet
them in person?

283
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,375
After all, they are barbarians.

284
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,041
You really are a fool.

285
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,708
You understand nothing
of this, Jiang.

286
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:13,541
It's Yang Duanhe
that I'm meeting.

287
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,083
Huh?

288
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,458
[JIE SHI] In the past, I've
conducted some private trading

289
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:20,041
with the mountain folk, enough
to learn a little of them.

290
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,750
They have countless
different tribes.

291
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:26,625
Even I knew nothing of
this latest congregation.

292
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:29,625
But I have heard of this
mountain king, Yang Duanhe.

293
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,458
My sources say he has

294
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,250
a strong interest
in the flatlands

295
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:37,000
and was seeking an opportunity
to come down here.

296
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,250
Since Yang Duanhe
ascended the throne,

297
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:42,583
the mountain folk's strength
has grown by leaps and bounds.

298
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:46,583
Now is the moment we need
that strength for ourselves.

299
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:49,041
[BA JIO] They say the
king and up to 50 envoys

300
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,291
may proceed into court.

301
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:51,666
Just 50?

302
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,541
How can only 50 of our guys
fight against 80,000?!

303
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:55,875
You can be quiet.

304
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,791
[ZHENG] There's no chance
that all 80,000 soldiers

305
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:00,291
and militiamen are
within the Court.

306
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,000
The troops are
stationed to the east,

307
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,708
some distance from here.

308
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:06,416
[XIN]
Oh. Well, why didn't you say so?

309
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,666
Once they get wind of any
strange events at Court,

310
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,333
they'll soon come pouring in.

311
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,708
We must strike down
Cheng Jiao and Jie Shi

312
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:13,958
before they do.

313
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:17,041
Lord Changwen, select ten
men with knowledge

314
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,458
of the Court's layout.

315
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:19,416
[LORD CHANGWEN]
Yes, sir.

316
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,916
[BI]
When the fighting starts,

317
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,875
should we have the people on
the outside break the gates?

318
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:26,958
[ZHENG] No, that would bring in
the enemy forces from outside.

319
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:28,625
Our only hope of
winning this battle

320
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:31,583
is to keep it inside
the walls of the Court.

321
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,875
To that end, those waiting
outside the gates

322
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:37,041
will guard all exits and
capture anyone who comes out.

323
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,916
Pick the other 40 from
among the mountain folk.

324
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,041
[BA JIO]
Understood.

325
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,916
Hey, I'm coming, too!

326
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,791
Obviously.

327
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:58,458
[TAJIFU grunts]

328
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,250
[XIN yells]

329
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,166
[XIN] Why are you trying
to come along with us?

330
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,416
[DIAO]
Whoa!

331
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,666
Get outta here!

332
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,041
[DIAO]
Well, that's impossible now!

333
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,250
[XIN]
I can't believe this!

334
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,666
Don't you understand
what's about to happen?

335
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,208
[DIAO]
Yeah, I understand.

336
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,666
But if you guys fail inside,
everybody else on the outside

337
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,458
will be killed anyway.

338
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,625
[DIAO] Besides, there's
no place for me among

339
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,250
that bunch out there.

340
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,500
Huh?

341
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,291
[DIAO] They don't really
interact with me at all,

342
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,416
even after seeing how I dress.

343
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,708
It just seems like they're
not really my kin.

344
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:33,958
Which means... I'm with you.

345
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,541
I'll come with you guys...

346
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:38,583
That way, I can achieve great
deeds and become massively rich!

347
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:41,708
[XIN] Well, not my
fault if you get killed.

348
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,958
[DIAO] The great He Liao Diao
of Heibei Village

349
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,625
won't die so easily. Ha, ha, ha!

350
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,916
[JIANG] At the Red Turtle Gate,
we'll confiscate their weapons 

351
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,250
and let only the
mountain king

352
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,666
and one attendant pass.

353
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,583
The king himself
has agreed to come,

354
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,750
so it's unlikely this
is just part of a plot,

355
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,208
but if something does happen,

356
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:05,791
that gate is our best defense.
So as a precaution,

357
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,916
we've positioned a large
contingent of guards there

358
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,333
to reinforce it and keep
the mountain folk in line.

359
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:11,708
[JIE SHI]
Mmm.

360
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:14,541
[XIN]
Wait...

361
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,125
They're gonna confiscate
our weapons?!

362
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,458
[BA JIO]
Yes.

363
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:20,000
But then we're not gonna
be able to fight, are we?

364
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,791
Precisely.

365
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,666
That's why this is the place...

366
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,083
The place where battle begins!

367
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,208
[JIE SHI] Look. The mountain
folk are almost here.

368
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:47,041
Oh man...

369
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,791
Looks like this'll be a flashy
start to the fighting...

370
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:54,375
[DIAO] Is it... is it
about to start now?

371
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,208
[XIN]
That's right.

372
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:57,375
[DIAO]
This is bad!

373
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:00,125
They've got twice as
many soldiers as us!

374
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,541
[XIN]
It doesn't matter.

375
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:04,583
[DIAO gasping, panting]

376
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,458
[DIAO]
Wait, Xin... please...

377
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:08,625
Can't breathe.

378
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:12,583
My chest is hurting...
I can barely walk.

379
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:13,708
Diao!

00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,583
Whatever happens,
don't leave my side!

381
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:16,958
You hear me?

382
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,458
I... I understand!

00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,833
I won't leave you,
for even a second!

385
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:25,041
We'll collect your weapons here!

00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,291
Set aside your arms, all of you.

No.

00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:37,583
The right to strike the
first blow in this war...

Here it goes! Diao!

Ah... right!

00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,333
Minister Jie Shi, we should
take refuge within, now!

401

Stop panicking so much.

402
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:43,541
So Yang Duanhe, you think you've
put one over on me, do you?

403
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,833
But you've underestimated
the Red Turtle Gate,

404
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,666
you mountain monkeys!

405
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:52,625
[XIN, DIAO yelp]

406
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,541
Bi, my man, the gates
aren't opening! What do we do?

407
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,458
[BI] The Red Turtle Gate
is so strongly built

408
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,041
that it can't be smashed

409
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:03,208
by anything less
than a catapult!

410
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:05,833
That's why they chose this
spot to make their stand!

411
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,125
Don't even try to
scale the walls!

412
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,000
You'll just be a target!

413
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,416
But what else can we do?
If we can't break the gate, 

414
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,875
the only way is
to climb the wall

415
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,958
and open it from the other side!

416
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,416
[BI]
You're right!

417
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,000
But the wall's way too high
for us to scale it safely

418
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,041
in a single go.

419
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,125
Then what do we do?

420
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:33,541
That's a good question.

421
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,583
[LORD CHANGWEN] Fortify a
position beside the wall!

422
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:38,208
We'll build a human ladder
and climb over it!

423
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:43,708
My lord, as things stand,
we'll only sacrifice more lives!

424
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:47,583
[LORD CHANGWEN] I know.
But there's no other way.

425
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,125
Don't flinch!

426
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:52,750
There's no chance of victory
unless we surmount that wall!

[JIE SHI]
Jiang!

429
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,916
Choosing the Red Turtle Gate
as the entry point

430
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,166
and increasing the number of
guards was a very wise call.

Kill them all in the
shadow of the gates!

This was a mistake, Xin!

There's no way past the gate!

It's impossible! Fighting
it out here is pointless!
