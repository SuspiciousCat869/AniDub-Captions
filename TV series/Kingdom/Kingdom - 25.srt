00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:17,000
[NARRATOR] Four month
after the war with Wei,

3
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:19,250
after Xin made a splash
in his first campaign

00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:21,708
on his quest to become
a great general...

5
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:27,541
[NARRATOR] Qin sent a great
force of over 200,000 men

6
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:29,666
to march against Han,

7
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,708
another kingdom located
on its eastern border.

8
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:36,916
Go! The ladder's been put up!

[SOLDIERS groaning, yelling]

11
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,625
[NARRATOR] Under the command
of General Meng Ao,

12
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:47,583
this army was composed of
Qin's most famous warriors.

13
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:50,583
They stormed Han's castles
one after another

14
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:53,458
and the people of Qin were
overjoyed to hear the news

15
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:55,291
of the quick succession
of victories.

[laughs]
Let's have a look!

20
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:09,875

[gasps]

22
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,333
[NARRATOR] ...an unprecedented
danger was bearing down

23
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:19,625
upon the kingdom of Qin.

24
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:23,166
[NARRATOR] Ancient China.

25
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,083
The time of the sages was over,
swept away by base human greed.

26
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:30,166
Over five centuries,
an endless storm of war,

27
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,875
hatred, and strife
raged across the land.

28
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:34,625
Over a hundred nations fell,

29
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:37,000
winnowed away until
only seven remained.

30
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:39,416
Now, from Qin,
the westernmost kingdom,

31
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,833
a great wind of history
is about to blow.

32
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:44,791
This is the tale of
a nameless boy and a young king

33
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:47,500
who ran the gauntlet
in this age of strife.

Open the gate!

37
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,708
[LORD CHANGWEN] You say
Zhao's forces are invading us?!

38
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,041
[MESSENGER 25A] Yes, sir!

39
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,583
[ZHENG] The Kingdom of Zhao?!

40
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,041
[LORD CHANGWEN]
What was their point of entry?

41
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,583
[MESSENGER 25A]
MNyg, to the northeast!

42
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:42,791
[LI SI] How many soldiers?

43
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:43,833
[MESSENGER 25A]
A hundred thousand!

44
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,250
That many?

45
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,875
[MESSENGER 25A] We got
a report of a signal fire

46
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,583
requesting
reinforcements at MNyg,

47
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,416
but the rain quickly
put it out.

48
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,958
[LORD CHANGWEN]
We're powerless...

49
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:55,666
General Meng Ao is off invading
Han with 200,000 of our men.

50
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,208
[LORD CHANGWEN] That means
there's no standing force

51
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,083
in the kingdom
we can deploy now!

52
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:02,000
[LI SI] First MNyg,
and then MNyáng after it...

53
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,000
If Zhao manages to
take the border castles

54
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,125
on our front lines,
their armies will be able to

55
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,125
surge straight into
the heart of the kingdom,

56
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,375
with no way to stop them!

57
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,291
[LORD CHANGWEN]
What on Earth do we do?

58
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:14,083
We don't even have enough
time to call back

59
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,041
General Meng Ao's forces.

60
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:19,000
[LORD CHANGWEN] They've already
penetrated too deeply into Han!

00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,000
[sighs]

62
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,083

for us to sit by idly!

[MEN gasp]

64
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,458

of men from our heartland

including those exempted
from conscription

66
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:29,541
for the war with Han.

67
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,666
Raise a hundred
thousand troops!

68
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,916
We'll send them
to relieve the front lines!

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,333
[LÜ BUWEI] One moment,
Your Majesty.

70
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:39,291
Such important matters
must be decided properly

71
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,833
in a council of war.

72
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,583
[LÜ BUWEI] We must first
summon our military's

73
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,750
high commander,
Lord Changping.

74
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,458
Make him be quick, then!

75
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:49,625
We are facing
the kingdom of Zhao.

76
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,166
[ZHENG] And in case
you've forgotten,

77
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,875
we were the ones who buried
400,000 of their soldiers alive

78
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,500
in the Battle of Changping!

79
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,083
You think they've forgotten?

80
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,958
[ZHENG] The hatred Zhao's people
hold for the kingdom of Qin

81
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:03,666
is implacable and unstoppable.

82
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,083
Unless we hurry,
every last man, woman,

83
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:09,208
and child in our borderlands
will be put to the sword.

84
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,916
[NARRATOR] An emergency draft
order was immediately issued,

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,166
and the conscripted men
set out for the battlefield.

Please promise me
you'll come home safely.

00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,291
Hey, Yuan.
How long's it been

99
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:53,083
since I got
kicked off the cliff?

100
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,750
[YUAN] About...
four months, I think?

101
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,166
[XIN] I see.

102
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,333
That took a little bit
longer than expected, huh?

103
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,458
[STATELESS PEOPLE]
Long live Lord Xin!

104

[XIN grunts]

106
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:08,666
This time I'll get General
Fatlips to train me himself!

107
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,125
I've earned it, dammit.
It's time to collect!

108
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:14,458
Ta-da!

109
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,166
Hmmm...

110
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,083
[XIN] Hold it right there,
General Wang Yi!

111
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,916
[YUAN] Xin, sir, please don't
give orders to generals!

112
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,416
[XIN] What do you mean my
training is gonna hafta wait?!

113
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,291
We managed to conquer
the stateless area

114
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:28,416
just like you asked!

115
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,541
[WANG YI chuckles]

116
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,208
[WANG YI] Circumstances
have changed a bit

117
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,875
in the meantime, you see.

118
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,166
[XIN] What is that
supposed to mean?

119
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,708
[WANG YI] It means
that war has broken out.

120
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:41,500
What?! A war...
is going on now?!

121
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:45,000
Then are we all heading
straight to the battlefield?

122
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,833
Ha ha! Right on!

123
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:52,416
I'm gonna do this,
just you wait!

124
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,583
[DIAO] An emergency draft?!
Gotta mean something big.

125
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,833
What the heck is going on?!

126
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:05,083
I'd better go pay Zheng
a visit and ask him.

127
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:06,791
[BOY] Wait right there,
He Liao Diao!

128
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,083
[DIAO] Huh?

129
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,666
If you've come
to see His Majesty,

130
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm afraid you can't.
Sorry to disappoint you.

131
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,250
[BOY] Not even you
would be allowed

132
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,791
to enter the
Throne Room right now.

133
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,625
Oh, don't look so worried.

134
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,708
I'm not an enemy or anything.

135
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,625
Not at the moment, anyway.

136
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,541
Huh?

137
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,166
[BOY] I came here
with my teacher.

138
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,000
I was hoping to listen in
on the council of war.

139
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,583
But as soon as I got here,

140
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,708
they told me to wait
here in this room.

141
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,791
My father scolded me, too.

142
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,958
He said this was
no place for children.

143
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,458
Uh... who are you, exactly?

144
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:41,791
[BOY] Oh, sorry.

145
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,416
I suppose I haven't
introduced myself yet.

146
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,916
Nice to meet you.
My name is Meng Yi.

147
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,208
[DIAO gasps]

148
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,708
So, you're a
scaredy-cat, then?

149
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:52,875
Got a problem with that?

150
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,500
Hm! Not at all.

151
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,000
[MENG YI] It's a
valuable trait to have,

152
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,750
both here at court
and on the battlefield.

153
00:07:58,833 --> 00:07:59,708
Huh?

154
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,291
[MENG YI] Oh, I get it!

155
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:04,125
That boy you live with...
Xin, I think his name was?

156
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:05,541
You think it's likely
he'll take part

157
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,583
in the war with Zhao, right?

158
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,541
[DIAO]
He knows about Xin, too...?

159
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,166
[MENG YI]
And you're worried about him,

160
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,458
so you came looking
for information.

161
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,416
[DIAO] Who is this guy?

162
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,458
[MENG YI] You certainly
read the situation right.

163
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:18,958
Huh?

164
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,291
The council of war
they're holding

165
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,958
at the Jeweled
Throne right now,

166
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,458
it's definitely one
of extreme importance.

167
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,875
It will affect the
whole course of this war.

168
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,875
[LI SI] Everyone in
MNyg was slaughtered,

169
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,291
down to the last newborn child.

170
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,333
Their corpses were
left to the elements,

171
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:35,541
and our enemies
spilled a river of blood.

172
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,250
[LI SI] We must not
stand by and allow Zhao

173
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,000
to get away with this outrage!

174
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,458
[ALL gasp]

175
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,291
We know all of this already.

176
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,916
How long are you going to
keep repeating yourselves?

177
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,041
Leave this matter to me.
I'll handle it.

178
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:52,166
[LÜ BUWEI] Hm.

179
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,333
We are most
fortunate to have you here

180
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,416
at Xianyang while our
renowned warriors

181
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,666
are away in Han. Your presence
must be considered

182
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,583
the silver lining
to this cloud, Meng Wu.

183
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,541
[LÜ BUWEI]
Given that, Your Majesty,

184
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,458
I urge you to
commission Meng Wu as--

185
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,041
[LORD CHANGWEN]
I beg you not to.

186
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,708
[ALL gasp]

187
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,666
Yes, Lord Changwen,
did you say something?

188
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,541
Yes. I said General Meng Wu
should not be appointed

189
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:23,375
commanding general.
I'll repeat myself if needed.

190
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,666
[LORD CHANGPING]
Hold, Meng Wu!

191
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:34,125
I will not let some mere
civil servant interrupt us.

192
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,625
[LORD CHANGPING]
He is no civil servant.

193
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:39,500
Lord Changwen is
also a veteran warrior

194
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,166
who's spent long years on the
front lines fighting with

195
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,833
bow and halberd in the time
of our own King Zhao.

196
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:48,041
Lord Changwen,
it appears you have

197
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,958
some concerns on your mind.

198
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:52,041
[LORD CHANGPING]
May I ask what they are?

199
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:54,625
[LORD CHANGWEN]
When it comes to battle,

200
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,625
there are two types
of strength:

201
00:09:56,708 --> 00:10:00,041
[LORD CHANGWEN]
offensive and defensive.

202
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:03,875
Certainly, General Meng Wu's
offensive power is outstanding.

203
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,500
Indeed,
in that area, he may be

204
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,625
the best Qin general
of our time.

205
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,166
However, when it comes
to defensive strength,

206
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,916
he does not have what it takes.

207
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,833
[MENG WU grunts]

208
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,166
[LORD CHANGWEN] In a war where
the borders around our lands

209
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,583
are steadily crumbling,

210
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:20,583
and our ranks are already
thinned almost to nothing,

211
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,666
there can be no doubt
that defensive strength

212
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,500
is necessary for survival.

213
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,500
Therefore, we cannot afford
to leave this war

214
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:30,000
in the hands of
General Meng Wu.

215
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,750
[LÜ BUWEI] I see your point.

216
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,666
Your argument does sound
most reasonable.

217
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:40,958
However, having said that,
the larger question remains.

218
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,541
Is there anyone else now
in Qin capable of leading

219
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:47,000
100,000 soldiers to victory?
Who else could manage it?

220
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,791
There is one such man.

221
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,125
[ZHENG] Hm?

222
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:51,708
[LORD CHANGWEN] He's a
veteran warrior who's been

223
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,500
resting his wings away from the
field of battle for some time.

224
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:55,833
[MENG WU grunts]

225
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,083
[LORD CHANGWEN] Nevertheless,
the most powerful

226
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,791
of Qin's warriors.
Moreover, he's powerful in

227
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,208
both offense and defense.

228
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:05,000
Impossible...
You can't mean...?!

229
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,125
[WANG YI chuckles]

230
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,791
My, my, I see
the Court is livelier

231
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,333
than it's been in a long time!

232
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,791
Hello, everyone.

233
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:29,833
And how are all of you
on this fine day?

234
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,291
Xin?

235
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,833
Uh... hey, Zheng.

236
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:55,750
You're interrupting
our council of war. Leave!

237
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,333
What an odd thing to say.

238
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,750
I came all this way
because I was invited

239
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:03,458
to take part in this
very same council.

240
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:05,541
That's nonsense.

241
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,333
Who in his right mind
would invite you?

242
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,500
I invited him,
General Meng Wu.

243
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,875
[MINISTERS gasp]

244
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,875
[MENG WU]
Why would you do that?!

245
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,416
Answer me!

246
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,791
[LORD CHANGPING]
To commission him formally

247
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:20,708
as commanding general
of Qin's forces.

248
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,250
[MINISTERS] What?!

249
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:30,541
[XIN] Wang Yi will be
the commanding general?

250
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,416
Does that mean I get to see
with my own eyes

251
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,333
how the last of the six
great generals does battle?!

252
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,750
Is this my big chance?

253
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,125
[MENG WU] Lord Changping.

254
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,750
Do you think I will stand by

255
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,833
and accept this insult,
just like that?

256
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,666
You had better.

257
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:54,833
My reasoning is exactly as Lord
Changwen has already outlined.

258
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:57,875
Battle isn't about
offense or defense.

259
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,916
It's about crushing
the enemy in front of you

260
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,458
'til nothing's left!
That's all there is!

261
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:06,000
[LORD CHANGPING]
Enough, Meng Wu.

262
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:09,666
As Qin's commander, this is
my decision, and it's final.

263
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,041
It shall not be overruled.

264
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,291
You're nothing more
than a relic of the past.

265
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,750
I hold no respect for you!

266
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,333
Oh, that's such a shame.

267
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:33,583
You see,
I respect you, Meng Wu...

268
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,833
To a certain extent.

269
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:39,750
[MENG WU grunts]

270
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,875
[WANG YI chuckles]

271
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,916
Well, it seems that
matter has been settled.

272
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,083
[WANG YI] Now, if you
gentlemen don't mind,

273
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,958
would the rest of you
please leave as well?

274
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:00,708
[LORD CHANGWEN] Wh-What?!

275
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:04,000
What on Earth is the meaning
of this, General Wang Yi?

276
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,500
[WANG YI]
There are certain...

277
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:08,708
...old rules of etiquette that
apply in times like these.

278
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,833
The King and I must
go through certain formalities

279
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:14,916
in private before we can hold
the formal rite of commission.

280
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,250
I confess, I'm a
stickler for tradition.

281
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,166
I could never consent
to lead Qin's armies

282
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,625
without following
the proper protocol.

283
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:27,125
[MINISTERS grunting]

284
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:41,500
[ZHENG] Why do you
remain silent, Wang Yi?

285
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,666
You told a patently
transparent lie

286
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,666
in order to drive out
the others, didn't you.

287
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:50,416
[ZHENG] I assume you wish
to say something to me.

288
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,833
[laughs]

289
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,875
Well, then...

290
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,875
[WANG YI] Your Majesty,
I told you something

291
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,458
when your younger brother
Cheng Jiao rebelled

292
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:04,750
and turned the Royal Court
into a battlefield.

293
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:08,708
Do you remember
exactly what I said to you?

294
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,500
"Build up the
corresponding strength,

295
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:14,666
if you're going to speak
so grandly." I remember.

296
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,208
[WANG YI laughs]

297
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,333
It seems that will take you

298
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:21,250
a bit more time
to accomplish that.

299
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:24,000
I won't deny it.
After all, I have yet

300
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:27,875
to accomplish anything
truly kingly by myself.

301
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,458
Hm.

302
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:32,333
Wang Yi. On that same day,

303
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:36,625
I challenged you to accept and
move past King Zhao's death.

304
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:39,916
[ZHENG] If you're now willing to
accept command of our armies...

305
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,750
does that mean that
you have been able to do it?

306
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:49,500
King Zhao was
an illustrious ruler.

307
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,500
Believe me,
I'm well aware of that.

308
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:56,291
[WANG YI] Your Majesty...
you suffered a great misfortune

309
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:57,916
in that you never
had the chance to see

310
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,083
with your own eyes
the king who should've

311
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,666
been your role model.

312
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,125
You lived as a hostage
in the kingdom of Zhao

313
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,791
until you were nine.

314
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,375
And unfortunately, the only
king you saw in the four years

315
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,708
between your return
and your coronation

316
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:13,541
was your father,
King Zhuang Xiang,

317
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:17,333
who was merely
Lü Buwei's puppet.

318
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:20,125
If you had seen even one
glimpse of the old King Zhao,

319
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,791
and known what
he was capable of,

320
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:24,125
perhaps we would find ourselves
in slightly different,

321
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:27,708
slightly better circumstances.

322
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,208
What you say is true,

323
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,250
but nothing can
be done about it now.

324
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:35,375
I will simply have to
grope my own way forward.

325
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,958
[sighs]

326
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,208
What is it, Wang Yi?

327
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,791
If I am going to accept the
responsibility of going to war

328
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:45,166
as Qin's commanding general,

329
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,958
then there's a vital piece of
information I just remembered

330
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:51,041
that I need to tell you about.

331
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,708
[ZHENG] What is it?

332
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:56,500
Just that I have a message
I must give you.

333
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,833
[WANG YI]
It's from King Zhao.

334
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,291
[gasps]

335
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:06,083
[ZHENG] A message...
from King Zhao?

336
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,875
[ZHENG] The castle at MNyg
has already fallen prey

337
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,666
to Zhao's sudden invasion.

338
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,375
Its people have
been slaughtered

339
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,750
and the entire area demolished!

340
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,083
Now MNyáng castle,
the key to our kingdom's

341
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:30,125
first line of defense,
is under attack as well!

342
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,583
If MNyáng falls,
tragedy will sweep through

343
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,458
all the lands of Qin.

344
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:36,875
[ZHENG] Know that
this crisis threatens

345
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:39,000
our country's very survival!

346
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:44,541
[ZHENG] General Wang Yi,

347
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,375
I appoint you
as the commanding general

348
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,833
of over 100,000 Qin troops!

349
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:51,250
[ZHENG] Save MNyáng castle,
and annihilate the Zhao army

350
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:54,958
seeking to trample our kingdom!
Those are your orders!

351
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,208
I hear and obey you,
Your Majesty.

352
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:14,041
[MENG YI] So Wang Yi is
the commanding general...

353
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:16,458
I doubt Father is pleased.

354
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:19,166
My teacher made the
right decision, though.

355
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,375
General Wang Yi
really is the best one

356
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:24,125
to handle this war. It makes
sense to appoint him.

357
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:25,541
[DIAO] I don't
know much about him,

358
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,625
but if he's in command,
and if he's really that much

359
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:30,375
of a big shot, maybe we
can rest a little easier.

360
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:31,916
Know what I mean?

361
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,583
[MENG YI]
It's too soon to tell.

362
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,083
Huh?

363
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,166
[DIAO] Wait,
what do you mean by that?

364
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,291
I am thinking about
Zhao's forces.

365
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,750
There are things we
do not know about them yet.

366
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:45,458
For example... oh, hey!

367
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,500
Xin!

368
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:53,083
[YUAN] Lord Xin, why don't we
stop by at home first?

369
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,041
I think we should
at least tell poor Diao

370
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,250
that we're marching soon.

371
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,416
[XIN] No need.

372
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,875
He already knows
without me telling him.

373
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,000
[ZHENG] Xin!

374
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,041
[XIN] Huh?

375
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,500
[YUAN] Your Majesty!

376
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,000
[ZHENG]
Are the two of you leaving?

377
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,291
[XIN] Yeah, I gotta go.

378
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,583
Sounds like the others
are already marching.

379
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,083
I heard General
Wang Yi's gonna

380
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,541
stay a little longer, though.

381
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:16,041
[ZHENG] I never imagined you'd
be training under Wang Yi.

382
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,250
[XIN laughs]

383
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,958
Well, not like he's
actually bothered to

384
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,875
teach me anything
himself yet!

385
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:24,166
So, what?
The great king himself

386
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,541
came out here
just to say hello?

387
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,583
Be careful out there, Xin.

388
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:32,500
Yeah, yeah.
I'm way ahead of you!

389
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:35,083
Or, at least,
that's what I wanna say...

390
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:36,916
But what is with you, Zheng?

391
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,833
You look way gloomier
than usual.

392
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:42,125
It's just that
this attack by Zhao,

393
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,000
it took me
completely by surprise.

394
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:44,958
[XIN]
Well, they say overconfidence

395
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,708
is the greatest enemy.

396
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,791
[ZHENG] Certainly
the kingdom of Zhao was once

397
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,500
a mighty rival power.

398
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:53,458
But that was because
they had three great generals.

399
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,000
[XIN] Three great generals?

400
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,250
[YUAN gasps]

401
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:59,791
[ZHENG] Lin Xiangru,
Lian Po, and Zhao She.

402
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,875
They were illustrious
ministers and warriors

403
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,333
who fought for Zhao.

404
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,000
They were on the same level
as the six great generals

405
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,666
who were the pride of Qin.

406
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:10,083
They were as good as
the six great generals?!

407
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:13,166
[ZHENG] However, none of the
three are alive any longer,

408
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,666
and we knew of no one
qualified to succeed them.

409
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,083
Based on that, the Court
and I believed Zhao was

410
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,666
currently incapable of
mobilizing a large force

411
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,083
and attacking Qin.

412
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:25,333
[XIN] But now they are attacking
after all, aren't they?

413
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:27,583
[ZHENG] I'm told
King Dao Xiang of Zhao

414
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:30,083
is an extremely cautious man.

415
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,583
He would not have
authorized the attack

416
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,208
if he weren't confident.

417
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,000
[XIN] Don't you worry.

418
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,375
We have General
Wang Yi on our side!

419
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,416
Ah! W-Wait, sir!

420
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,500
And we got me, too.

421
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,750
[sighs]

422
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,000
[XIN] That was pretty
awesome back there, Zheng.

423
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,625
Hm?

424
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,708
The rite of commission.

425
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,458
That was actually
a pretty cool feeling,

426
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,125
getting commissioned by you...

427
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:01,000
with all the ministers
watching, in that big room.

428
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,000
[reins snap]
[horse neighs]

429
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,583
[XIN]
All right. I'll see you later!

430
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:11,625
Wait! Xin, sir,
please, wait for me!

431
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,958
Fortune be with you!

432
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:19,916
[DIAO panting]

433
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,833
[MENG YI] He's left, huh?

434
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,416
[DIAO] Yeah.

435
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,250
--[MENG YI] He Liao Diao...
--[DIAO] Huh?

436
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,958
Do you want to go
into battle as well?

437
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,583
Huh?

438
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:41,125
[NARRATOR] In the meantime,
the Qin soldiers who were

439
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:43,000
gathered by
the emergency draft

440
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:45,291
were marching
haphazardly northeast,

441
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:49,166
without even stopping to
organize their regiments first.

442
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,583
[WEI PING]
Look! There he is!

443
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:54,666
Ah! Hello, Wei Ping, Wei Dao.

444
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,083
[WEI PING, WEI DAO]
Corporal Ze!

445
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:57,958
Glad to see you again!

446
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:59,875
[ZE GUI] Good,
you're both looking well.

447
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,583
[laughs]
Yes, sir, we sure are.

448
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:05,583
[MAN] Ugh, the weaklings
are all coming together again!

449
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:06,916
[BOTH] Huh?

450
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,916
[WEI PING] Oh!
So you guys are here, too!

451
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,708
[XIE CI] 'Course we are!

452
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:15,208
We've all been itching to have
another proper dust-up again!

453
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:17,125
Look.

454
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:20,000
[XIE CI] Tian YRu and
Zhong Tie are here, too.

455
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:21,875
Yeeehoo!

456
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:23,791
All us boys who got
through that bloody battle

457
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,583
against Wei
are together again!

458
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:26,875
With the gang all here,

459
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:29,666
there's no way
we're gonna lose to anyone!

460
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,958
Say, where's that kid?

461
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:34,791
I thought he might be
hanging out with you guys.

462
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:36,875
Hmm? You mean Xin?

463
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:38,250
Yeah, we kept
an eye out for him

464
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:40,166
on the way here, but no luck.

465
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,000
Don't tell me
the brat didn't come.

466
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:44,291
I'll kick his butt
if he hasn't.

467
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:46,041
[WEI PING laughs]

468
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:48,458
Hey, no need
to worry, you guys.

469
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:50,250
[WEI PING]
If the rest of us are here,

470
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:52,791
there's just no way
he won't show up.

471
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:55,541
I may not know why
he's taking his sweet time,

472
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,500
but trust me, he'll be here.

473
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:58,875
[WEI PING]
He's gotta be, right?

474
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:02,125
He is our squadron
commander, after all!

475
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:05,708
[YUAN] Lord Xin, sir, we don't
have to be in such a rush!

476
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:08,250
[XIN] Whaddya talking about?
I ain't rushing, Yuan!

477
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:09,500
[YUAN] Huh?

478
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:11,583
[XIN] I'm just excited
to see everyone again!

479
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:12,791
[YUAN] What?!

480
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:15,375
[XIN] He-heh. Guys...

481
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:16,541
Hya!

482
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:20,208
[XIN] ...I'm on my way!

483
00:24:52,666 --> 00:24:54,791
[LORD CHANGWEN] Impossible...
That can't be!

484
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:56,291
He died!

485
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:58,083
[NARRATOR]
That man is not human.

486
00:24:58,166 --> 00:24:59,333
The heavens fear him,

487
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:01,250
and the earth
trembles before him.

488
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,333
[NARRATOR] Next Time:
"Pang Nuan, God of War."
