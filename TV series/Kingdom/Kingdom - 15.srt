1
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:11,083
[WANG YI] I simply came
to take your life.

2
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:12,958
Do you understand?

3
00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:18,750
[WANG YI] However, it is
contingent upon your answer.

4
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:21,375
[NARRATOR] Ancient China...

5
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:24,666
The time of the sages was over,
swept away by base human greed.

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,875
Over five long and
harrowing centuries,

7
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:29,750
an endless storm of war,
hatred, and strife

8
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:31,125
raged across the land.

9
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:32,750
Over a hundred nations fell,

10
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:35,208
winnowed away until
only seven remained

11
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,500
Now, from Qin, the
westernmost kingdom,

12
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:39,958
a great wind of history
is about to blow.

13
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:42,625
This is the tale of a
nameless boy and a young king

14
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:45,458
who ran the gauntlet
in this age of strife.

15
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:46,791
[yelling]

16
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,583
[WANG YI]
There is only one question

17
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:30,041
I would like to ask by your
leave: What kind of king

18
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:33,916
does Your Highness
aim to be, exactly, then?

19
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,833
Please, think carefully
before answering me.

20
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:43,041
My prized blade does not
forgive insolent words...

21
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:46,041
...no matter who
the speaker may be.

22
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,083
The only King of
Middle Kingdom.

23
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:54,625
[gasping]

24
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:59,125
The only King?!
Those are bold words...

25
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,750
In all the past five
centuries as of late,

26
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:09,666
I know only one monarch who
spoke such foolhardy words

27
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,000
as you have.

28
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:14,166
He was once feared as
a "God of Battle"--

29
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,916
It would behoove you never to
utter King Zhao's name again.

30
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:21,958
[LORD CHANGWEN] Hold on,
Your Highness.

31
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:25,291
It's dangerous to speak of
King Zhao in front of that man!

32
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:32,666
The "God of Battle", King Zhao,
my great-grandfather,

33
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,875
most of his 55-year reign
was spent at war.

34
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:40,291
You were not the only
one to cherish him as a King.

35
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:44,416
Warriors from all over Qin
gave him their utmost loyalty

36
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,500
offering their lives.

37
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:50,958
Yet, in the seven years
after King Zhao fell,

38
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:55,375
Wang Yi, you would have then
lost your cherished lord,

39
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,083
and became a
hollow-hearted bird,

40
00:03:57,166 --> 00:04:00,541
flailing, suffering
with nowhere to land.

41
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:03,208
If you keep chasing
after King Zhao's shade,

42
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,541
there will be no place
for you to land.

43
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,625
[ZHENG] However,
I haven't the least desire

44
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,541
to become a perch
for you whatsoever.

45
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,541
If you wish to
fight on my side,

46
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:17,875
then accept King Zhao's death
and finally set your feet

47
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,291
on the ground where they belong.

48
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,125
Then "Strange Bird of Qin"

49
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:25,916
will soar over all
the Middle Kingdom!

50
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:39,125
[WANG YI] Soar over
the Middle Kingdom...

51
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:44,458
[WANG YI chuckles]

52
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:47,291
So it's beyond me...

53
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:53,291
[KING ZHAO] Ahh, indeed, the
Middle Kingdom was too large.

54
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,083
[KING ZHAO coughs]

55
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:59,166
[KING ZHAO] I entrust you
with my dream then, Wang Yi.

56
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,791
Your Highness.

57
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:06,666
If I were to lose my King,
I wouldn't be able to fly again.

58
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:08,583
[KING ZHAO laughs]

59
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:11,125
[KING ZHAO] Don't say
such pitiful words now.

60
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:16,000
Even after I die, there will
always be battlefields.

61
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:19,166
However, there will be
no field on which to fight

62
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,375
for a dream with real heat.

63
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,208
Is that so?

64
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,875
There are any
number of other kings

65
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:29,250
who also want a unified
Middle Kingdom.

66
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,333
They do only in talk.

67
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,291
I can tell when I see them,

68
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,000
whether burning with love
for the Middle Kingdom

69
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,625
if they've planned this dream.

70
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:41,458
The real thing carries
a gleam in his eyes

71
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,750
like a boy as
Your Highness does.

72
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,625
[KING ZHAO laughs]

73
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:48,583
Like a young boy, you say?

74
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:52,166
[WANG YI] No other king truly
wants a unified Middle Kingdom.

75
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,625
They're all nobodies
avoiding the hard path,

76
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:59,333
scrapping and scrapping content
preserving the status quo.

77
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,666
[KING ZHAO]
That's a little harsh.

78
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,375
There's not a single
one anywhere...

79
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:08,958
No praiseworthy king who
is willing to devote his life

80
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,333
to that dream.

81
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,583
A praiseworthy king, huh?

82
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,541
[KING ZHAO chuckles]

83
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:20,166
[KING ZHAO] If I could live
for another twenty years, I...

84
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,416
might have realized my dream.

85
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,583
Ah, Wang Yi.

86
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:39,666
Even if you give up flight,
just keep your talons sharp.

87
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:43,166
It would be unforgivable
for a warrior of your caliber

88
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,916
to die and be forgotten.

89
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,708
Even if there is none
now, in the future,

90
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:53,875
a king like myself
may appear again one day.

91
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:57,750
[KING ZHAO]
If that time comes, Wang Yi,

92
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:01,833
you must beat your wings
even harder than now!

93
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,250
[WANG YI chuckles]

94
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,375
[WANG YI]
After King Zhao passed away,

95
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:18,666
many kings tried to enlist
me, but all tossed around

96
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:23,250
the words "Middle Kingdom" or
"all under Heaven" too lightly.

97
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:26,250
Not one was the real thing.

98
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:29,166
But this young King's not bad.

99
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:31,916
[WANG YI giggles]

100
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,791
[WANG YI] He's still different
from King Zhao,

101
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,416
but he's not bad.

102
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,166
That lovely gleam...
This young King's eyes

103
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:46,666
are nothing like King Zhao's
burning love for the nation,

104
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,875
but is focused on the path
to a unified Middle Kingdom.

105
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,666
[WANG YI giggles]

106
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,458
[WANG YI] One might call it
arrogance born of youth,

107
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,916
but there hasn't been
a single King

108
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,625
who's stared down at unified
Middle Kingdom with those eyes.

109
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:06,708
The 31st King of Qin;
Ying Zheng...

110
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:13,000
[WANG YI] Lord Changwen...
Now I understand a little

111
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:17,166
why you've gotten yourself all
hot and bothered, if you will.

112
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,125
[LORD CHANGWEN] Hmm...?

113
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,000
[WANG YI giggles]

114
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,041
This was quite an
interesting conversation.

115
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:26,750
I guess, for today,
I will be taking my leave.

116
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,666
[gasping]

117
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,833
[WANG YI laughs]

118
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:37,750
Your Highness, thinking that
I want to fight at your side

119
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:40,666
betrays certain
self-absorptions...

120
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:44,666
[WANG YI] Please build up
the corresponding strength,

121
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,958
if you are going to
speak so grandly now.

122
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:51,375
This is no time to be fumbling
with your little brother,

123
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,291
do you understand?

124
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,125
[WANG YI giggles]

125
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:00,291
[WANG YI] With that,
we will withdraw!

126
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:01,750
[TROOPS] Sir!

127
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:07,208
[WANG YI]
You'll withdraw, too, Teng.

128
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,125
[TENG] Yes.

129
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,708
[WANG YI] King Zhao...

130
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:15,708
A heated time may be on its way
once again, Your Highness.

131
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,416
Well, Wang Yi...

132
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,750
I can't overlook your
killing of Wei Xing,

133
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,625
but the reality is you've
brought things to a halt.

134
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:27,500
I will put things in
order before it is known

135
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,833
that Minister Jie Shi is dead.

136
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:30,750
[XIN panting]

137
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,666
[CHENG JIAO gasps]

138
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,916
[CHENG JIAO yells]

139
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,375
[SI SHI gasps]

140
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:39,708
[SI SHI gasps]

141
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,041
[CHENG JIAO screams]

142
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,166
[SI SHI] Lord Cheng Jiao!
Wait, my lord!

143
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:47,958
What is this?

144
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,666
The battle has stopped?!

145
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,125
[ZHENG gasps]

146
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,291
[ZHENG] Xin!

147
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,333
Huh? Well, hey there!

148
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:58,750
You're still alive.

149
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:03,000
[CHENG JIAO whimpers]

150
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,458
[CHENG JIAO screams]

151
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,375
[SOLDIER 15A] Lord Cheng Jiao!

152
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,666
[SOLDIER 15B]
Why's Lord Cheng Jiao here?

153
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,333
Ying Zheng!
This is Ying Zheng!

154
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,541
Go kill him! Kill him!

155
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:28,791
What are you all doing?!

156
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,750
Hurry up and kill him! Cut him!

157
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:34,458
What is going on here exactly?

158
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,416
--[gasping]
--Huh?

will cut you down in a flash.

Cheng Jiao.

00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:12,000
You're a common fool
who mistakenly believes

169
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:16,291
that a person's value
rests solely in high birth.

170
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:19,208
You are completely unfit
to be a King!

Then are you saying that
you're fit to be a King instead?

You are semi-royalty
and your blood is half

from a mere commoner.

176
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:38,750
Can you rule over the people?

177
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,416
[ZHENG] I can.

178
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,250
I won't concede to a commoner.

179

I, the pure blood,
will rule the people

You've received a

The people are not as simple
minded as you or I think.

They don't much care
about us royals.

Yes, it was petty!

about who's king?!
None of that matters!

look down with arrogance,

knowing nothing
about people's hearts.

of the mountain folk...

said that he is going to
get a house ready for me.

306

Considering your success,

307

I can promote you to a

You honestly think I could stand
doing something that boring?

311
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:16,583
I'm setting out
for the battlefield!

then I'll become a general!

for you, too, from here on, huh?

314
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,208
[ZHENG] I left Jie Shi's forces,

315
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:31,333
but it's clear that
they're weakening.

316
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:34,041
Lü's power will grow
greater now.

317

But that is only
until I come of age

00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,583
for governing this kingdom.

319
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,583
When I reach 20
and get crowned,

320
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:43,083
I'll strip Lü of
his power without failing.

321
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,541
And then...

322
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:49,000
...I'll set the Middle Kingdom!

323
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,458
[XIN] That's it.

324
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:57,833
[ZHENG] Xin... until then,
rise up the ladder.

325
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,291
[XIN] Yep.

326
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:10,583
[LÜ BUWEI] I see.
So they've been pacified.

327
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,458
[AIDE 15A] Yes, sir!

328
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:16,833
[LÜ BUWEI laughs]

329
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:21,083
[LÜBUWEI] Time to go
then... to Xianyang.

330
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,708
[ZHENG] You truly did us
a great service.

331
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:26,375
I am grateful to the valorous
mountain folk with all my heart.

332
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:27,875
The fight's just begun.

333
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:31,750
We'll share our knowledge,
of the moves of both internal

334
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:34,000
and external enemies.

335
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:37,375
In the future, I'll send
messengers regularly.

336
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:38,708
I'll send them, too.

337
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:43,250
I also want to further our
exchanges of technology.

338
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,083
You have a clear vision.

339
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,958
I look forward to when
you become the King

340
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,250
of Middle Kingdom.

341
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,625
We'll meet again!

342
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:07,791
[DIAO] Isn't it great, Xin,
that we can get our own house?

343
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:11,458
[XIN] There is no "our".
It's my house.

344
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:15,000
And why the heck are you
coming along with me anyway?!

345
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,375
[DIAO] Dummy.

346
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:19,583
If you were all alone,
what would you do for food?

347
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:22,375
[XIN] Food?
That's so simple, I...

348
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,416
Um, I can't handle it, I guess.

349
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,416
[DIAO laughs]

350
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,208
See, that's why
I'm so generously

351
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:28,708
coming along with you.

352
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,208
Show some gratitude!

353
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,583
Whatever.
Do what you want.

354
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,041
[DIAO] Hey!

355
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:38,583
The house Lord Changwen
gave us isn't that way!

356
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,083
[XIN] This is the right way.

357
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,291
There's a place
I'd like to stop by.

358
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,583
[DIAO] Huh?

359
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,708
[DIAO] Where are we?

360
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,958
[XIN] The village where
Piao and I grew up.

361
00:20:56,041 --> 00:21:00,125
Piao is... the guy who
was a stand-in for Zheng?

362
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:01,166
Yeah.

363
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:04,333
The reason why I am
what I am now

364
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:07,875
is because I met Piao
in this village.

365
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:09,458
Xin...

366
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:12,958
Take me with you, and conquer
everything under the Heavens.

367
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:20,708
Piao!

368
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,500
[XIN] I've made it
this far, Piao.

369
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:33,625
Along the road you and I
chose, I made it far!

370
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:36,125
[DIAO] So it's because
you met Piao

371
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:38,791
that you became as
strong as you are...

372
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:39,958
[XIN] Yeah.

373
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,958
[DIAO] It sure is
mysterious, huh?

374
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,458
[XIN] Huh?

375
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:46,750
[DIAO] That Piao met Zheng,
and Zheng met you as well...

376
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:50,500
[DIAO] Who could've imagined it?

377
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,000
Me, too.

378
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:56,041
I feel like my fate changed
in a big way by meeting you.

379
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:59,208
Nope, that is
just totally wrong.

380
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:01,958
[DIAO] Mmm,
what's wrong about that?

381
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:07,000
It didn't change, you see.
You just changed it yourself.

382
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:10,041
Fate changes if we
carve out the path

383
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:13,875
Oh, then I guess
that's true!

384
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:18,208
[XIN] Piao, I'm burying
my memories with you

385
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:20,708
in this village...

386
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:23,625
...so that I can
forge ahead with the dream.

387
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:26,791
--[XIN yells]
--[DIAO screams]

388
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:28,750
[DIAO] Hey, where did
that come from?!

389
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:29,791
[XIN] Go, go, hurry, hurry!

390
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:32,333
[DIAO] Xin,
don't leave me behind!

391
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:34,375
Wait for me, Xin!

392
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:41,333
[DIAO] Wha... What is this?!

393
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:44,041
[XIN] Well, it looks
like a house to me.

394
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:46,125
What makes this a house?!

395
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:47,416
This is a shed!

396
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,875
That old man stingied us
out of a house!

397
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:51,541
Say something, Xin!

398
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:53,041
It's perfect.

399
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:54,958
Huh?

400
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:58,375
[XIN] Because I originally
had nothing whatsoever.

401
00:22:58,458 --> 00:23:02,375
Now at last,
I own land and a house.

402
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:06,875
I'll win more acclaim and
get bigger lands as well!

403
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:10,250
To start with a
broken-down shed is fine!

404
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:14,625
This is our first castle,
Diao! Our first castle!

405
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:17,041
Yeah! We made it! [XIN laughs]

406
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:19,458
[DIAO] No we haven't, you dummy!

407
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:21,250
[laughing continues]

408
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:54,666
[XIN] I can't speak!

409
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:57,250
What is it... this sensation?

410
00:24:57,333 --> 00:24:59,625
[NARRATOR] Displaying
an unfathomable smile,

411
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:02,583
that man quietly pays obeisance.

412
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:04,958
Next Time: "Lü Buwei."
