There's something up ahead...

3
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:24,541
Hey, Xin! What is it?!

4
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:30,750
H-Hey, you!
Don't pass the leading car!

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,375
[XIN] It's gettin' hotter...

[XIN] Gettin' heavier...

7
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:41,791
What's this sensation?

8
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,166
There's something
right up ahead!

9
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:46,791
[XIN] Something serious!

[WEI PING gasps]

16
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:19,375
So this is a... battlefield...

17
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:23,333
[NARRATOR] Ancient China...

18
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,708
The time of the sages was over,
swept away by base human greed.

19
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:28,958
Over five long and
harrowing centuries,

20
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:31,750
an endless storm of war,
hatred, and strife

21
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:33,375
raged across the land.

22
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:34,833
Over a hundred nations fell,

23
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:37,250
winnowed away until
only seven remained.

24
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:39,666
Now, from Qin, the
westernmost kingdom,

25
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,208
a great wind of history
is about to blow.

26
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:44,791
This is the tale of a
nameless boy and a young king

27
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:47,416
who ran the gauntlet
in this age of strife.

28
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,791
[yelling]

29
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,291
[NARRATOR] Xingyang: A land
that lay near the border

30
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,458
of the kingdoms of Qin and Wei.

31
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,916
[NARRATOR] It was the
western gateway to Wei,

32
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,250
and a key strategic strongpoint.

33
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:40,541
[NARRATOR] And now,

34
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:43,000
the two countries' anticipated
battle over it had begun.

35
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,333
[NARRATOR] Qin, using
Yashui as their base,

36
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,833
planned to attack Xingyang
from three points

37
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:51,166
and take the castle.

38
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,875
However, Wei's
commanding general Wu Qing

39
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,791
sallied forth from Xi Castle 

40
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,833
and tore holes in
Qin's defenses immediately.

41
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:03,166
[NARRATOR] Outfoxed, Xin and
the others in their first battle

42
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,458
as foot soldiers changed course
from Wan Castle to Yashui

43
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:10,958
before finally arriving at the
site of the deciding battle:

44
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,541
She Gan Plain.

45
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,250
Fourth Army, fall in!

46
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,458
I am the battalion
commander, Fu Hushen!

47
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:29,041
We will begin organizing
our formation!

48
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,000
Five-man squads, line up!

49
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:31,666
[WEI PING] Huh?

50
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,291
What's going on?

51
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,833
I thought we were supposed
to storm a castle!

52
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:38,208
[FU HUSHEN] Line up!
Get moving, worms!

53
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,750
[SQUADRON COMMANDER 18A]
One moment please, Commander!

54
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,000
We haven't been told anything

55
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,875
other than that...
our meeting point

56
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:45,291
changed from Yashui
to She Gan Plain!

57
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,916
Sir, wasn't the plan
to storm Xingyang?

58
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,625
A lowly foot soldier has
no need to know everything!

59
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:55,000
You worms only need to follow
your superiors' orders!

60
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,291
B-But Sir, we--

[BI] Hold it!

64
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,916
The war situation has
changed at a dizzying speed.

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,708
We should explain it to them,
foot soldiers or not!

66
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:09,500
[WEI PING] Hey, isn't that the
battalion commander from before?

67
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:10,833
It's Bi!

68
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:12,833
Newcomers shouldn't
stick their noses in!

69
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,833
[BI] Whether I'm a
newcomer is irrelevant!

70
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,416
We're both commanders, and
I will make my opinion heard!

71
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,041
Excuse me?!

72
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,208
[SHANG LU] You cannot fight
in front of the troops.

73
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,458
Settle down, you two.
It's shameful.

74
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:26,250
Keep out, Shang Lu.
I'm talking to him now.

75
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,708
[SHANG LU]
Sorry, I can't do that.

76
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,708
This guy's a childhood friend,
and you see,

77
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:33,333
we have a tradition of
working things out together.

78
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,833
[FU HUSHEN] Hey.

79
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:37,583
Keep being fresh with me
and I'll kill you both.

80
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,041
Huh...?

81
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,958
Wei's forces
caught us off guard

82
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:46,208
with a sortie out of Xingyang!

83
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:49,250
In response, we moved
our troops from Yashui here

84
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,500
to She Gan Plain!

85
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:55,500
It was yesterday that the two
armies faced off and battled.

86
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,750
The Third, Fifth,
and Sixth Armies

87
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,416
have not yet arrived here,

88
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,833
which leaves our
forces outnumbered.

89
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:06,041
The Wei troops arrived
a short time before us

90
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:10,083
and covered the hills, giving us
a geographical disadvantage.

91
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:13,458
In order to win,
we need to take the hills!

92
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:17,458
The Second Army battles as we
speak, but it's a bitter fight.

93
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,708
They await our reinforcements!

94
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,291
After we unite our troops,
the Fourth Army must aid

95
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:26,041
the Second Army and do whatever
it takes to seize that hill!

96
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:29,000
That is our current situation!

97
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,541
We just gotta take the hill?

98
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,166
That'll be nice and easy.

are brave warriors feared
throughout the Middle Kingdom!

Go out there; prepare to die!

Kill, kill, and kill again, for
as long as you have strength!

Dye this field red
with the blood of Wei!

be with you!

But this waiting part...

00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,166
is always a great thrill,
isn't it, huh?

123

I agree!

124

[ZE GUI]
Most of the men in the front

125
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,208
lose their lives in

It's no use, Corporal.

Even if we make it
through the beginning,

other to cover our blind spots.

We defend as five
and attack as five.

144

Even against a single wounded
enemy, we attack as a group.

Me? Scared?

Nah. See, I've been waiting
for this moment all my life.

They're about to
order the charge.

00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,208
Don't get too eager and trip.

168
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,750
You'll be trampled
to death by your own.

Uh... it is starting!

Okay, I can do this.
I'm gonna do this!

I thought this might happen!

A rock formation!

Jump up onto the corpses

[XIN] What is this?
I'm already breathing hard.

214
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,083
[XIN] Am I tight because
it's my first battle?

215
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,958
No, that's not all...

216
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,791
[XIN] My body feels
heavier than normal.

217
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,333
No... the air feels heavier.

218
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,541
Is this what a
battlefield is like?

219
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,833
Well, it's no big deal!

220
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,666
[XIN yells]

221
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,333
[NARRATOR] Wei's rock formation
was considered perfect.

222
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:12,666
But the soldiers poured through
the crack Xin made on their wall

223
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,625
without losing momentum, 

224
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:18,083
and the tide of this early
battle turned in Qin's favor...

225
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,583
[NARRATOR] ...or so it seemed.

so you survived, Wei Ping?

230
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,333
Don't you "heh heh" me!

231
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,750

[WEI PING] Weren't you
listening to the corporal?!

234
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,791
Squad solidarity is-- 

235
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:39,291
[ZE GUI] Wei Ping.
It's all right.

236
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:40,541
Corporal...

237
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,958
If he had not charged
on his own like he did,

238
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:46,791
I think we might have probably
all died during the first clash.

239
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,208
"Doing what you can
for the good of all"--

240
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:52,000
That's another fine
squad strategy.

It is almost
like an earthquake.

are gone, too.

Never mind that. What is
your strategy, Qiang Lei?

295

[QIANG LEI] A defensive wall.

[QIANG LEI] By piling bodies.
