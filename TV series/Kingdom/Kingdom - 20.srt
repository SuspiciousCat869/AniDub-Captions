1
00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:16,458
[FU HUSHEN] Gong Yuan,
we meet at last.

2
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,500
[NARRATOR] Ancient China...

3
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:44,083
The time of the sages was over,
swept away by base human greed.

4
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:46,375
Over five long and
harrowing centuries,

5
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:49,000
an endless storm of war,
hatred, and strife raged

6
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:50,666
across the land.

7
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,375
Over a hundred nations fell,

8
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:54,625
winnowed away until
only seven remained

9
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:56,958
Now, from Qin, the
westernmost kingdom,

10
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:59,208
a great wind of history
is about to blow.

11
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:01,875
This is the tale of a
nameless boy and a young king

12
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:04,625
who ran the gauntlet
in this age of strife.

13
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:05,916
[yelling]

14
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:51,250
[LORD CHANGWEN] Your Highness,
I just received a report.

15
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:56,208
[LORD CHANGWEN] Our forces led
by Lord Biao are still engaged

16
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,250
in battle on the She Gan Plain

17
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:01,250
with the Wei forces
led by General Wu Qing.

18
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,041
However...

19
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,958
Not only were many
of our men lost

20
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,500
in an attack by
Wei's chariot squadron,

21
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,666
but Wei has also
made camp on the hills.

22
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,958
Our forces are
now in dire straits.

23
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:14,916
I see.

24
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,625
[DIAO] "Dire straits"?
Does that mean...?

25
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:27,083
[DIAO] You're okay, right, Xin?

26
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:30,375
You're gonna get glory
and come back home?

27
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,416
[ZHENG] If you lose this
battle, you won't carve

28
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,708
a path to the Middle
Kingdom's unification.

29
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,166
I'm counting on you!

30
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,625
[GONG YUAN] I see, then...

31
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,750
So you have made
your way over here

32
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:02,000
through a series of amazing
miracles, I understand.

33
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,583
[GONG YUAN] How meaningless.

34
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:08,000
Miracles are when the powerless

35
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,250
happen to come across good luck.

36
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,291
It's because you rely on them

37
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:15,708
that thousands of your
soldiers die dogs' deaths.

38
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,458
You stupid fool!

39
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,083
Take that back!

40
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,000
[FU HUSHEN]
They are not dogs' deaths.

41
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,208
[XIN] Huh?

42
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,000
[FU HUSHEN]
Every single one of our dead

43
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:29,291
served to build the bridge
that I made my way here on!

44
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,916
[GONG YUAN] Ha! The
sacrifices of your comrades?

45
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,166
Men who bring touching stories
like that into war

46
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,875
are the sort I hate
the most of all.

47
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,166
Battalion commander of Qin...

48
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,583
Your faith in miracles doesn't
change that you got this far.

49
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:47,250
Still, what good
does it do you?

50
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,166
You'll change nothing...

51
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,833
unless you kill me
and take this hill over us.

52
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,333
[GONG YUAN] Which you can't,

53
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:57,291
and that means all
you have achieved...

54
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,375
...is a dog's death!

55
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,291
[FU HUSHEN grunts]

56
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,708
Commander Fu Hushen!

57
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:08,958
Did you really believe
that I was merely a tactician?

58
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,583
I am a warrior who once
ravaged the front lines

59
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,166
with the great Wu Qing!

60
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,875
[FU HUSHEN]
You call yourself a warrior?

61
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:21,041
I'm already a dead man.
I can't even see properly,

62
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:24,708
yet you feel the need to
run me through with a sword?

63
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,875
So then, Gong Yuan,

64
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:30,625
is my power now
just a mere miracle too?

65
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,250
If that is what you think,

66
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:35,833
your army stands no chance
against Lord Biao.

67
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:38,125
Gong Yuan, second-in-command...

68
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:43,250
[FU HUSHEN] Your life is mine!

69
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:44,708
[XIN gasps]

70
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,333
[FU HUSHEN chuckles]

71
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:51,666
[QIN SOLDIER]
Commander Fu Hushen!

72
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,458
[WEI SOLDIER]
General Gong Yuan!

73
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,666
[XIN growls]

74
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,125
[XIN yells]

75
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:03,208
[QIN SOLDIERS yell

76
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,000

[grunting]

78
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,625
[WEI SOLDIER 20A]
Who the hell is this kid?!

79
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:17,333
[WEI SOLDIERS yell]

80
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:27,750
Qiang Lei's something else...

81
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,125
Yeah. With that skill,

82
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,791
he might be able to
slay all Wei's soldiers...

83
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,250
[grunting]

84
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,708
[WEI PING gasps]

85
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,083
[QIANG LEI] I'm out of breath.

86
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,500
[QIANG LEI]
Guard the rear until I get back.

87
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:50,625
[WEI PING &amp; WEI DAO]
What?!

88
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,541
[WEI SOLDIERS] Now!

89
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,791
[ZE GUI whimpers]

90
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,291
That's how it is.

91
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,583
[SUBORDINATE 20A]
Commander, we've killed most

92
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:09,916
of the Wei soldiers, and the
rest of them have fled now.

93
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:13,916
Our unit has overpowered

94
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,625
Gong Yuan's encampments
successfully, Sir!

95
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,500
[SUBORDINATE 20C] However, the
defensive corps we broke through

96
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:21,083
on our way here is closing in.

97
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,583
[SUBORDINATE 20B]
We have less than ten men

98
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,791
to face a force
of over one thousand.

99
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,625
[SUBORDINATE 20A] I hate
to say that we should withdraw.

100
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:32,458
We'll oust Wei's flag
and bring Gong Yuan's head!

101
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:33,666
[XIN] Don't be stupid!

102
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,958
[BOTH] Huh?

103
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,916
If you jerks want
to leave, go ahead.

104
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,291
I'm gonna stay here
and fight them!

105
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,666
How dare you, brat?!

106
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,250
[SUBORDINATE 20B] Know your
place, you foot soldier!

107
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:46,500
The commander said he made it
here 'cause of our men's losses,

108
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:49,041
meaning they died
to take this hill!

109
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,291
Look around!

110
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,583
Their deaths won't be in vain,
I'm telling you!

111
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:56,333
I'm not just gonna let it go

112
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:59,125
for some little pathetic
thousand-man unit. I refuse!

113
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,458
Are you a fool?!

114
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:01,958
They're a thousand!

115
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,083
[FU HUSHEN laughs weakly]

116
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,166
[SUBORDINATES gasp]

117
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,083
Your name, little boy...?

118
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,375
It's Xin.

119
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,833
Xin...

120
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:15,333
Listen, Xin. Fear and
recklessness are different.

121
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:16,541
If you confuse the two,

122
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:19,458
you'll die early and
leave nothing behind.

123
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:25,791
[FU HUSHEN] Withdraw from the
hill with everyone else.

124
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,666
That's an order!

Do you really think you can make
it down from this hill alive?

00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,375
Don't shame yourself with lies!

131
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,000
We know there are no guards

132
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,916
on the far side
of the hill for certain!

133
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,041
We'll stroll to the bottom,
and take your head with us!

All you people understand
nothing whatsoever...

We'll slaughter all Qin's men
just like at Wan Castle.

but there's no soldiers!

146
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,583
[SUBORDINATE 20B]
Which means the man himself

atop the hill has fallen!

161
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,375
Say what?

162
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:32,291
Looks like Fu Hushen
has made it to the top.

163
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:35,666
[SUBORDINATE 20D]
Commander! A red messenger!

164
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,166
[SHANG LU] An emergency
order from the General?

165
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,458
What is it now?!

166
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,375
[RED MESSENGER 20A]
Attention, First, Second,

167
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,000
and Fourth Armies!

168
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,875
Ascend the hill and
form a battle array!

169
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:51,166
I repeat: All forces ascend
the hill and form an array!

170
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,083
That is crazy. They are almost
crushing us as it is!

171
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,208
We cannot get even
near the hill

172
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:57,833
at the rate we are going at!

173
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,291
Right, Bi?

174
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,458
What is wrong, Bi?

175
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,625
You're looking the wrong way.

176
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,125
[BI] What does this mean?

177
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,291
[BI] What are
you doing here now...

178
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,708
[BI] ...General Wang Yi?!

179
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,791
Hey, Bi!

180
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,208
It looks like we might as well
go and take the hill, too.

181
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,291
Wait, Shang Lu!

182
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,166
General Wang Yi is here...

183
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,875
Something is about to happen!

184
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:33,958
[WANG YI giggles]

185
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:37,916
Lord Biao's battle style
is as rough as ever.

186
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,791
Isn't that right?

187
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:43,875
Yes. But that is exactly what
makes him a fearsome general.

188
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:46,208
[WANG YI]
In which case, Wu Qing...

189
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,333
[WANG YI]
That hill seems to command

190
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,625
a better view than this one.

191
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:55,125
Wouldn't you agree, Teng?

192
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,791
Yes, you are quite right.

193
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,125
However, my lord,

194
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,791
it's a crime to join a
battle without permission.

195
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:06,541
Unfortunately, I'm afraid
this is the closest we can get.

196
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:10,416
No one made any
mention of joining them.

197
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:15,041
I quite simply really fancy
climbing that hill myself.

198
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:18,708
Though I'll eliminate anyone
who happens to get in my way.

199
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:22,458
A flawless excuse,
and as usual, my lord.

200
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:23,833
[WANG YI] Well, then...

201
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,541
[BOTH gasp]

202
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:30,083
[SHANG LU] They are racing
down a slope that steep?!

203
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,250
Which cavalry is that?!

204
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:33,750
That's General Wang Yi

205
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,583
accompanied by his
personal soldiers.

206
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,166
What?! General Wang Yi?

207
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,666
That is crazy! I thought
he retired years ago!

208
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,416
General Wang Yi!

209

[gasping]

210
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,208
[SHANG LU] Then the...
Strange Bird of Qin

211
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:55,375
has taken to... to the
battlefield again?!

212
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:59,666
Battalion! Follow our
new reinforcements! Ride hard!

213
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,041
That goes for the
Shang Lu Battalion, too!

214
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,000
Let's go!

215
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:07,625
[SOLDIERS yelling]

216
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,750
Ugh, Commander, let us
decend on the opposite side

217
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,333
of Wu Qing's main force.

218
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,250
[SUBORDINATE 20C] We'll have to
battle the defensive force

midway down. Bear with us.

220

Just leave me here.

221
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,250
[SUBORDINATE 20B]
We can't leave you in a place

222
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,583
we know the enemy will come!

223
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:27,291
If you must go, Sir,
let it be on our shoulders.

224
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,375
I'll lend my shoulder--

225
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,166
No, you'll take this!

226
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,041
This is the enemy
general's head, isn't it?

227
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,416
Right.

228
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,916
It's proof of the Fu Hushen
Battalion's achievement.

229

Do whatever it takes to
bring this to the Qin camp!

Failure is not an option.

[XIN] Am I the right choice?

232
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,166
This is a direct order
from the Commander,

233
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,375
and we have no objections!

234
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,541
I'll see to it.

00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:58,291
Okay! Now let's
get down this hill!

236
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,541

than climbing up!

like an ally, either.

explains it all.

the child Lord Changwen meant,

ever so slightly.

00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:54,375
Well, the truth is
that Qiang Lei...

320
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,000
[QIANG LEI] ...is right here.

321
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,750
[WEI DAO] Qiang Lei!
When did you get here?

322
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,333
[WEI PING] More importantly,
where have you been?

323
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,250
[XIN] Hah!

324
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:14,750
General Wang Yi, we are
grateful for your aid.

325
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,291
It must be divine providence

326
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:20,041
that brought you all the way
here to us in our hour of need.

327
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:23,250
I feel it only right
to put you, a general,

328
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:26,083
in command of the troops
that are on this hill.

329
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,791
[BI] Please, lead us,
lead our armies

330
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:33,583
in an immediate charge
against the Wei forces!

331
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:37,375
With our new geographical
advantage and our men

332
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,166
led by the great
General Wang Yi,

333
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,500
I am certain we can win!

334
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,333
[XIN growls]

335
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:43,916
[WANG YI giggles]

336
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,208
[WANG YI] I see you're as
earnest as ever, Lieutenant Bi.

337
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:51,166
But I'm afraid we
didn't come down here

338
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,958
as your reinforcements, however.

339
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,541
[BI gasps]

340
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:59,375
[WANG YI] We quite simply only
wanted to come up to this hill.

341
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:00,541
Right, Teng?

342
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,333
Yes. The view is
excellent, my lord.

343
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:05,250
[WANG YI] And so, Lieutenant,

344
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:09,166
you said you were
rather certain of a win.

345
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:14,208
You seem to be taking General
Wu Qing a bit too lightly.

346
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,833
Nine fold Spear Walls!

347
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:20,416
[WANG YI] There, you see?

348
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,250
[SOLDIERS gasping]

349
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,083
He observed us and then

350
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:27,500
promptly changed his
formation accordingly.

351
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,208
He senses the smallest
changes in a war.

352
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,833
His movements are bold.

353
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,583
He is absolutely
the best strategist

354
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:36,875
in all of Wei by far,
I understand.

355
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,583
On top of that, he has the
valor to lead from the front

356
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:42,333
as he demonstrated
at Wan Castle.

357
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:43,583
Make no mistake.

358
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:46,541
General Wu Qing of Wei
is a master general

359
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:49,083
who will pose a
threat to all nations.

360
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:50,583
Oh, no!

361
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:53,041
If they've got lots troops
and their general's amazing...

362
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:53,833
[WEI PING growls]

363
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,041
[WANG YI giggles]

364
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,250
[WANG YI] Oh, the numbers
are irrelevant.

365
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,500
This has never been
that sort of battle.

366
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:02,625
It's hung on the
general's fighting styles.

367
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:03,166
[XIN gasps]

368
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,791
[horse whinnies]

369
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:08,583
[WANG YI] I believe that there
are two types of generals.

370
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:12,250
On one hand, you have the
clever type like Wu Qing.

371
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,958
On the other, you have
the instinctive type

372
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,333
who fights on feral intuition.

373
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,083
[WANG YI chuckles]

374
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:23,541
Would you like to
make a bet with me,

375
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:26,208
young Xin, about this?

376
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:30,666
Will cleverness win,
or will instinct win?

377
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,125
[XIN] Instinct?

378
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,916
[WANG YI] I mean, the Qin
armies' commanding general,

379
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,541
of course, Lord Biao, naturally.

380
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,458
[XIN] So you're saying
you want to make a bet

381
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:40,916
on who's going to win?

382
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,916
Our leader or... Wei's leader?

383
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,958
[WANG YI] Precisely.

384
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,416
[XIN growls]

385
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,666
[BI] General, I must ask you
to stop this jesting!

386
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,875
[WANG YI] "Jesting!"
Oh, how you wound me.

387
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:57,833
The question of
cleverness versus instinct

388
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:00,666
is the eternal debate
of generals.

389
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,166
[XIN] The debate of generals?

390
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,041
[BI] Even so, General,
now is the time for us

391
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:08,958
to consider how we will
slay the enemies below!

392
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,458
It is certainly not the time
to dissect Lord Biao,

393
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,833
who is not even here
presently with us!

394
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:15,708
[WANG YI giggles]

395
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,500
[WANG YI]
Are you so sure of that?

396
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,541
[SHANG LU] Bi!

397
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,250
A part of Qin's cavalry is
circling this hill right now

398
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,458
at an all-out gallop!
I've just noticed it myself!

399
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:25,916
[BI gasps]

400
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:29,333
[SHANG LU] Lord Biao
is commanding them!

401
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:30,708
[BI] Say what?!

402
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,166
[XIN] Where?!

403
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:37,916
[XIN] I can tell with one look.

404
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,250
That man is Lord Biao.

405
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,875
Our highest officer is
leading the charge...

406
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:45,750
He plans to charge straight
into that Wei army!

407
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,458
[WANG YI giggles]

408
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:50,375
It seems Lord Biao has
not changed whatsoever.

409
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:52,875
He is still reliably
the exact same.

410
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:54,416
For in the end,

411
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,625
he has to make sure he's right
in the thick of the flames.

412
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,166
[WANG YI] He's expanded
his army over these long wars,

413
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,708
and now he fights with
tens of thousands.

414
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:05,583
[WANG YI] But the larger an army
grows,

415
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:07,333
the more its battles are swayed

416
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:10,250
by the talent and
strength of its general.

417
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:11,333
[XIN gasps]

418
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:14,875
In the end, wars
belong to the generals.

419
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,458
Lord Biao?

420
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:19,791
Surprise attacks do not
work on Wu Qing's army.

421
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,916
[WANG YI] Wu Qing has
changed formations once again.

422
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,333
A stance meant to take
Lord Biao's charge

423
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:29,208
head-on and stop it.

424
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:30,583
[XIN gasps]

425
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:32,791
[WANG YI] Wu Qing thinks of
war as logical reasoning

426
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:35,208
like in a board game.

427
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:37,541
Lord Biao's battle,
on the other hand,

428
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:40,291
is a great raging bonfire.

429
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:42,083
He could never
let this moment

430
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:46,708
when flames leap
their highest slip past him.

431
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:49,875
You can't understand that?

432
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:52,291
[WANG YI giggles]

433
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:56,458
Wu Qing cannot understand
Lord Biao's way of battling.

434
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,791
However, Lord Biao
has not seen through

435
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:03,083
all of his tactics, either,
I'm afraid to say.

436
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:06,708
Who is right...
and who is wrong?

437
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:09,833
We can't say for certain until
one of their heads rolls,

438
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:12,166
now, can we?

439
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:56,083
[XIN] I have been talkin'
to a real general?!

440
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:58,375
[NARRATOR]
Xin sees the future there.

441
00:24:58,458 --> 00:25:01,875
And he learns the
true weight of his goal.

442
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:04,666
Next Time: "The Meaning
of a General."
