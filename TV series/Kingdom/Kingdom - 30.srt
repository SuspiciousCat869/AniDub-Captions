1
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,875
[NARRATOR] When Qin got
offensive in the war with Zhao

2
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:15,041
via Xin's efforts as leader
of the Fei Xin Force,

3
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:18,458
Wang Yi placed all armies
under Meng Wu's command

4
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:21,333
and went straight for the
conquest of enemy headquarters.

5
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:23,875
First Army, move out!

6
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:25,916
[LONG GUO]
Second Army, into battle!

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,708
[LIN FANG]
Third Army, let's go!

8
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:31,791
[TONG JIN]
Fifth Army, charge!

9
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:34,250
Qin's main army, as well?

10
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,791
They have changed
their strategy!

11
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:40,416
[GAN YANG]
Fourth Army, here we go!

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,583
[NARRATOR] However,
just as Xin and the others

13
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,541
were on the verge of striking,

14
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:48,291
the situation abruptly
and drastically changed.

15
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:55,875
[XIN] What?! What is going on?

16
00:00:57,291 --> 00:01:01,291
[XIN] Zhao seems
to be retreating?!

17
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:05,583
[DIAO] What's going on?

18
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:09,000
The mountain of Zhao's
headquarters went all quiet!

19
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:13,583
[MENG YI]
Zhao's central force is...

20
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:19,041
[DIAO] Whoa whoa,
what's gotten into them?

21
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:24,375
[DIAO] They left their
headquarters totally exposed!

22
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:29,083
Could they be-- 

23
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:30,250
[LI MU] Oh!

24
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:33,166
[LI MU]
It looks like Zhao's armies

25
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,000
are already
going into hiding!

26
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:38,166
[KAINE] My lord,
there are people already here.

27
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,125
[LI MU] Hm?

28
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:45,250
Hi! I'm Li Mu, and this is
my gorgeous bodyguard Kaine!

29
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:54,791
[chuckles softly]

30
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:56,541
[NARRATOR] The time:
The Spring &amp; Autumn

31
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:58,541
and Warring States periods.

32
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:00,500
The place: Qin.

33
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:03,791
Xin, a nameless boy,
met Zheng, a young King,

34
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:05,750
distinguished himself in battle,

35
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:08,500
and rose to the rank
of squadron commander.

36
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:09,791
In the midst of this,

37
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:11,916
the neighboring
kingdom of Zhao invaded,

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,125
and Qin faced
unprecedented crisis.

39
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:17,125
What manner of
battle will Wang Yi wage

40
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:18,583
as commanding general?

41
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:21,666
And what growth
will Xin accomplish?

42
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,250
[SOLDIER]
Take down Zhao's flag!

43
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,250
Put up ours!

44
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:12,291
[MAO] We took their
headquarters, didn't we?

45
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:13,708
So we won?!

46
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,791
[TIAN YONG] Moron!

47
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,208
They've just moved
their headquarters

48
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:21,291
somewhere else, it seems,
to keep their numbers up.

49
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,208
So then, do we
chase them again?

50
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,083
Of course we do!

51
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,500
We're not letting 'em
get away now!

52
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:31,875
[XIN] Dammit, what are the
combat commanders waiting for?!

53
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:35,000
If we drag our feet,
the enemy will regroup!

54
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:39,916
[LONG GUO] So they've
taken the battlefield

55
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,416
into the mountains...

56
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,041
[TONG JIN] We won't be able
to tell where they are now.

57
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,916
[LONG GUO] No, the
steepness of the mountains

58
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,541
limits the number of places
they can station troops.

59
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:51,833
From our higher vantage point,
we'll spot them.

60
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:55,791
But it is safe to assume
they've already considered that.

61
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,625
Do you think we should
pursue them, Long Guo?

62
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,208
Don't ask that, Gan Yang!

63
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:06,083
You heard what my lord said
in last night's war council.

64
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,875
[WANG YI] We can gain
control of Zhao's mountain,

65
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:12,166
but I'm sure their headquarters
itself will retreat.

66
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,458
Whether we should pursue them

67
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,750
will depend on
the circumstances.

68
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:19,208
I'll leave that decision to
the general on the ground.

69
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:23,291
And that means you, Meng Wu.

70
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,291
Mountain warfare carries danger

71
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:31,083
because it's difficult
for allies to act in concert.

72
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,375
[WANG YI] I advise you
to think calmly.

73
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,208
We will pursue!

74
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,000
[MENG WU'S SUBORDINATES]
Yes, Sir!

75
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,250
[LONG GUO]
Allow me to confirm: 

76
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:43,125
You do remember the promise
with General Wang Yi last night,

77
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,500
I trust?

78
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:49,083
However, if you do
attack the fleeing enemy

79
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:51,375
you must promise one thing.

80
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:54,666
[WANG YI] And that is scope!

81
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,791
You may only attack Zhao
within seeing distance

82
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,375
of their former headquarters.

83
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:03,625
Under no circumstances
can you break this promise.

84
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,833
I know that.

85
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:14,166
They seem to be
moving out, my lord.

86
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,166
[growling]

87
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,541
Oh my goodness!
We came all the way here, 

88
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:22,708
and now everybody's
disappeared behind the mountain!

89
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,291
[LI MU] Now all
we can see from here

90
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:28,291
is Qin's headquarters
facing away.

91
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:33,625
Well, I suppose that's still
worth the walk on its own,

92
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:34,791
wouldn't you agree?

93
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:38,041
[DIAO] H-Hey!
Quit ignoring us already!

94
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,250
[DIAO] Who the heck
are you people?!

95
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,458
Nobody invited you up here!

96
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:48,583
Both of you,
put down your swords!

97
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:51,916
[NARRATOR] At Qin headquarters,

98
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,416
preparations to move
were complete.

99
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,166
[NARRATOR] Zhao's mountain
had been thoroughly conquered

100
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:02,333
and there was no sign of
the enemy between them and it.

101
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:05,875
Circumstances were good for Qin
to switch its headquarters in.

102
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:10,250
And yet Wang Yi, who had been
quick to act up until now,

103
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:13,875
was uncharacteristically silent.

104
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:17,041
An indefinable sense
that something was off

105
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,333
held him in place.

106
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:23,458
[WANG YI] I sense
a carefully laid strategy

107
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:27,875
behind this sudden
retreat on Zhao's part.

108
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:32,250
Meaning these four days
of Zhao losing were deliberate,

109
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:36,125
but that hardly seems
conceivable at all to me.

110
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:41,583
[WANG YI] Something smells
a wee bit strange here.

111
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:42,250
Teng.

112
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,458
Sir?

113
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,750
Do they have any other
tacticians remaining

114
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,916
besides Zhao Zhuang?

115
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,833
No, they should not
have any, Sir.

116
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,416
[WANG YI] Well, why not?
We'll move headquarters, Teng.

117
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,000
[TENG] Yes, Sir.

118
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:07,083
[WANG YI] After all, either way
I still have to go and smoke out

119
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,208
that commanding general
of theirs

120
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:11,708
who hasn't shown his face.

121
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,791
[LI MU] Now Qin's headquarters
is on the move, too!

122
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,416
[DIAO] Huh?!

123
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,333
[LI MU] They're transferring
to that mountain

124
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,375
because it'll be easier to
maintain command from there.

125
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:26,041
I can figure that out myself!
Don't talk down!

126
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,750
But you know this will
bring those two generals

127
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,250
closer together!

128
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:33,583
Hohohoho, how very exciting!

129
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:41,041
Now, then.
Let's get going, everyone!

130
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,500
We won't be able to
see the battle from here.

131
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:44,875
[DIAO] Just hold on a second!

132
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,500
Why are you giving the
orders all of a sudden?!

133
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,291
[LI MU] Uh, why not?

134
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,291
We're all spectators, aren't we?

135
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:56,458
The more of us the merrier,
wouldn't you say?!

136
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:59,416
Would you mind giving
us two a ride in your carriage?

137
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,791
Our horses are a bit
far away right now.

138
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,333
Of all the nerve
in the Kingdom!

139
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:06,750
We're not just gonna-- 

140
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,833
[LI MU] The thing is, there's
another abandoned castle

141
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:12,083
up ahead just perfect
for viewing from!

142
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,416
[DIAO] There is?!

143
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,416
Very well.

144
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,666
But I have just
one request in return.

145
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,291
[LI MU] What is that?

146
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:24,208
[MENG YI] Will you let us take
charge over all of your swords

147
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,041
if we do?

148
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:30,416
I am so wary of traveling with
strangers in a place like this.

149
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,625
Put yourself in my place.
Understand?

150
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,708
[LI MU] Okay then. Have them.

151
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:36,750
[KAINE] What?!

152
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:40,791
[MENG YI] Thank you very much.

153
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,916
[KAINE]
You're not getting my swords!

154
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:48,291
Let's leave while
we still have daylight.

155
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,916
[KAINE] My lord!

156
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,750
[NARRATOR]
While Qin's forces set up tents

157
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,708
at their new headquarters,

158
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,958
Wang Yi put the
infantry on standby

159
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,791
in the mountain's
rear foothills

160
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:01,750
in case of changes in the war.

161
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:04,958
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
Long Guo joined Meng Wu's army

162
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,708
and led the way to enemy camp.

163
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,333
The other armies
advanced with them

164
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:13,458
in their original positions
around Meng Wu.

165
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:17,458
[NARRATOR] But they had not
encountered the enemy as of yet.

166
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,541
[WANG YI] Any reports
at all on Pang Nuan?

167
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:29,625
[SOLDIER 30A] No, Sir.

168
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,791
Each army's commander
has reported in,

169
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,708
with no sightings of him.

170
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:39,250
[WANG YI] You certainly like
to try my patience, Pang Nuan.

171
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,375
[WANG YI] Has what
happened nine years ago

172
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:53,500
perhaps made you more cautious?

173
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:56,375
[WANG YI chuckles]

174
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:59,458
[WANG YI] But you have
no hope of taking my head

175
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:02,291
if all you do is hide.

176
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,208
[WEI PING] If things
keep going like this,

177
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,750
we may get home sooner
than we thought, huh?

178
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:18,875
Yep.

179
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,250
And then, we'll
be village heroes!

180
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,416
[laughs]

181
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,500
[YOU YI] Imagine the look
on their faces

182
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,375
when we tell 'em
we took down a general!

183
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:35,791
When I get home, I'm gonna
go and marry Dong Mei!

184
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,833
[YOU YI]
Nobody asked for that update.

185
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,375
[MAO] Don't say that.

186
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:42,750
Because you are not actually
engaged, or are you?

187
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:43,958
[WEI PING growls]

188
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:46,000
[WEI PING] I said I'm gonna,
and I'm gonna!

189
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,541
[SOLDIERS laugh]

190
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,416
That's right, you go for it.

191
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,541
Dao here has kept
his woman waiting forever

192
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,458
because he says
he can't get married

193
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,958
before his big brother
does so first!

194
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,500
Hey, hey,
Qing, stop sayin--

195
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:01,000
[WEI PING] What?!
Is that true, Dao?!

196
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:04,083
I'm sorry! Please give me
just a little longer!

197
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:07,541
[laughing]

198
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:10,291
[XIE CI] Ze Gui, so how old is
your kid again... around five?

199
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:11,916
[ZE GUI]
Just turned six, actually.

200
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,541
Huh, so the same age
as mine! A boy?

201
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:16,750
[ZE GUI] Yes, a boy.

202
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,583
[XIE CI]
Yeah, sons are the best, right?!

203
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,791
[FEI XIN SOLDIER 30A] Moron...
daughters are so much cuter!

204
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,083
[FEI XIN SOLDIER 30B]
Nah, boys are the best.

205
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,541
[FEI XIN SOLDIER 30A]
Girls, idiot!

206
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,291
[FEI XIN SOLDIER 30C]
Is your baby big, Long Chuan?

207
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:26,250
Must be, right?

208
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,500
[LONG CHUAN]
No, normal size...

209
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:43,291
Hi! The war council is over!

210
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:44,958
[XIN] What's wrong?

211
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:47,166
[QIANG LEI] Nothing.

212
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,958
[QIANG LEI] It's just...

213
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:53,041
They all have a home
to go back to.

214
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,125
Y-You-- 

215
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,875
Just forget it!
Do not read into that.

216
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,458
Everyone gets to have
different things.

217
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:03,208
I have something, too:
A goal that I'm living for.

218
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:12,625
[XIN] Revenge is important.

219
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:16,500
But you know, Qiang Lei,
that isn't the end whatsoever.

220
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,875
After you get your revenge,

221
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:22,208
you're alive, and you'll
still have a future.

222
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:27,833
Deep down, you've already
figured that out, haven't you?

223
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:28,625
[QIANG LEI] Huh?

224
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,166
"Huh"? Don't you "huh" me!

225
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,500
You took a break from revenge
to come and join the war

226
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:36,541
with us here!
Of your own free will!

227
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,625
[XIN] Which means...

228
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,791
You've got a perfectly
good home, too!

229
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:44,958
The Fei Xin Force!
Don't you forget that now!

230
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,458
[QIANG LEI]
Don't decide that solo.

231
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:53,125
[XIN] Come on. I'm gonna tell
everyone about the meeting.

232
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:58,583
Or are you saying
you don't like it here?

233
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,083
[QIANG LEI]
No, I'm not.

234
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,583
Then it is settled!

235
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:08,625
[QIANG LEI] It's not
that I don't like it here.

236
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:12,541
[QIANG LEI] No. In fact,
it's not half bad.

237
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:19,375
[QIANG LEI] I think that must
be why I feel a little lost.

238
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,625
[QIANG LEI]
What...

239
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:40,041
[QIANG LEI]
...is this presence I feel?

240
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,708
[QIN SOLDIER 30A]
Hey, you! Who are you?

241
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,041
[QIN SOLDIER 30B]
A Zhao soldier?

242
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,708
[QIN SOLDIER 30B]
What are you doing there?

243
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,458
What unit are you with?!

244
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:54,000
Halt! State your affiliation!

245
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,625
[WEI DAO]
Is something wrong, Xin?

246
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:09,083
[WEI DAO]
Xin!

247
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:12,250
[QIANG LEI] What I'm sensing,
is it a Chi You?!

248
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,083
No... it's different...

249
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,583
Similar, but
different somehow...

250
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,666
[QIANG LEI]
Don't tell me it's...

251
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,166
[QIN SOLDIER 30E]
E-Enemy attack!

252
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,416
It's an enemy attack!

253
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,916
[XIN] Darn, I knew it!

254
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,916
[XIN]
Hey! Which unit went down?

255
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,291
How many hostiles?!

256
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,000
[QIN SOLDIER 30F]
The one over that hill!

257
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,625
Sounds like the
watch team got wiped out

258
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,416
before they could even signal!

259
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:43,666
[XIN] What?!

260
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:48,291
[SOLDIERS muttering quietly]

261
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,583
[XIN] There's no enemy army?

262
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,208
[XIN] That whole unit
of guardsmen is dead, but...

263
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,125
...where did the enemy go?!

264
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:58,000
Did they run because
the rest of us came?

265
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,916
[QIANG LEI]
No. They're still here.

266
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,500
The commotion made me
lose track of them,

267
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,000
but they're still somewhere
in this campground.

268
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,041
[QIANG LEI] Where?

269
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:12,791
Maybe someone hit the
warning gong by mistake, no?

270
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,041
I'll go and take a look.

271
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,916
It is totally quiet
down there, though.

272
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:33,583
[SHAN HE]
Wh-Who the heck are you?!

273
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:37,250
[SOLDIERS yelling in pain]

274
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:41,375
[WEI PING] No way...
Shan He and his team...?!

275
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,708
This can't be happening!

276
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:47,458
[WEI PING] Who is he?!

277
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,416
[CHONG YUAN] Everybody run!

278
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,666
[SOLDIERS yelling]

279
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:57,625
[YUAN]
I have to go help them! Now...

280
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:01,083
What am I doing?
I'm a lieutenant!

281
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:05,458
Our men are all dying!

282
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,666
[YUAN] Xin!

283
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:11,250
[XIN] We were just laughing it
up together a few minutes ago!

284
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,416
This can't be happening!

285
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,541
[LONG YOU] Who exactly is he?

286
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,541
[WEI DAO] Just looking at him...

287
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:22,250
[WEI PING]
I can't stop shivering!

288
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:28,208
[PANG NUAN] I'm an act of God,
a natural disaster,

289
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:31,666
and all of you here...

290
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,708
[SOLDIERS yelling]

291
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:38,125
[PANG NUAN]
...were simply unlucky.

292
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:42,875
Run, guys!

293
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,416
You Yi!

294
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,916
[SOLDIERS yelling]

295
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,791
[FEI XIN SOLDIER 30E]
Someone help!

296
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:11,708
[YUAN] Everyone, run in
different directions! Scatter!

297
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,625
I-I can't talk...

298
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:17,000
I can't move my legs...

299
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,625
Sir!

300
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:22,041
[YUAN] At this rate,
the Fei Xin Force will die!

301
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:26,208
What are you idiots doing?!
Stand up!

302
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,875
[ZE GUI] Wei Ping, stand up!

303
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,791
M-My legs won't work now!

304
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,541
Hurry, Brother!

305
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,416
[WEI PING]
Run, you two!

306
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,125
[WEI PING] Xin!

307
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:11,041
Idiot, how dare you do this!

308
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:15,000
[XIN] I am not giving you an
easy death, that's for sure!

309
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,958
He's gonna fight...

310
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,666
Of course he is. He's Xin.

311
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,958
But, uh...

312
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:24,291
Don't do it, Commander!
You can't beat him!

313
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:28,791
[yelling]

314
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:40,791
That Xin is just amazing!

315
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:04,708
Stand.

316
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:07,416
[XIN]
Don't you look down on me...

317
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,625
X-Xin...

318
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,416
[XIN]
Don't worry at all, guys!

319
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,833
He's gonna be
the one to die!

320
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:23,291
[XIN] What?

321
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:28,500
[XIN] A guy that big,
dodging Qiang Lei's sword?!

322
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,500
Oh.

323
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:37,166
It would seem thou
art the one who called me.

324
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,875
What the heck does he mean?!

325
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:43,000
[PANG NUAN]
Thou mayst be a child,

326
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,750
but I'll still taketh thy life.

327
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:48,875
[XIN] What's with all the
crazy talk you keep spewing?!

328
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:52,625
And who in the world do you
think you are, anyway?!

329
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:55,375
Our camp's got
over 20,000 men,

330
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:58,708
and you rush in alone
and start killing everyone...

331
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,041
[XIN] Are you a Zhao soldier?

332
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,333
If you are,
what's this one-man raid

333
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,333
supposed to achieve?!

334
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:06,083
[XIN] No, wait a minute--

335
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:09,583
He did say Qiang Lei
called him...

336
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:13,125
[QIANG LEI] I don't remember
calling for anyone like you.

337
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,500
[PANG NUAN]
Thine existence called to me,

338
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:18,250
independent of thy will.

339
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:21,375
The savage god
lurking within me now

340
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:26,208
will permit no other strong
ones to exist around me.

341
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,875
[QIANG LEI]
Who exactly are you?

342
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:32,958
I am Pang Nuan, god of war.

343
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,125
[XIN] "God of war"?

344
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:37,000
What you talked about
before Qiang Lei?

345
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,000
Pang Nuan?

346
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,750
Did he just say Pang Nuan?

347
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,583
Pang Nuan?

348
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,333
Pang Nuan?

349
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:47,833
Pang Nuan, you say?!

350
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:50,750
But Pang Nuan,
he is the man...

351
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:54,291
That's the name of Zhao's
commanding general!

352
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,625
I don't care!

353
00:21:56,708 --> 00:22:00,458
I don't care if he's a god
of war or whatever he says!

354
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:03,583
[XIN] This guy killed Shan He
and Xie Ci and Fa Jian

355
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:06,916
and all the others!
He's gotta pay!

356
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,375
Time to take revenge,
Qiang Lei!

357
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:12,000
Of course.

358
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,291
They have him
on two sides...

359
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:18,166
They're gonna take him
on together?!

360
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,541
Let's join 'em!

361
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:22,041
Don't do it!
We'd get in the way.

362
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:24,041
The only support
we can give them

363
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:27,958
is to stay here
and watch their fight!

364
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:29,875
[QU HAI] But can they
really win alone?!

365
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:31,916
They're up against a monster!

366
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:37,583
If anyone can, it's Xin
and Qiang Lei! C'mon!

367
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:05,916
[WEI PING gasps]

368
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,708
No way! Even Qiang Lei?!

369
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:16,541
[QIANG LEI]
Pum, pa-rum. Pum, pa-rum.

370
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:19,458
[QIANG LEI] Pum, pa-rum.

371
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:22,083
Pum, pa-rum.

372
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,166
[XIN] If I start
running away now,

373
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,666
I haven't got
a prayer of being

374
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,458
the world's greatest general!

375
00:24:57,541 --> 00:24:59,541
[NARRATOR] Go for
the split-second opening!

376
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:02,666
Stab the invincible man
with a hundred blades!

377
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:05,166
Next Time:
"The Power of Unity."
