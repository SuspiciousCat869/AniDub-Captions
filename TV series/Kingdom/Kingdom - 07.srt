1
00:00:09,791 --> 00:00:12,666
It--It's impossible,
Your Highness!

2
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,875
Our strength is quite feeble.

3
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:18,333
What's more,
there's now no force in Qin

4
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:20,250
not bound to Lü or to Jie Shi

5
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:22,625
that would even
consider aiding us!

6
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,083
Do you think so, Xin?

7
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:30,583
Can you suggest some
way to do this, Zheng?

8
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:33,333
Huh? Hey, that blowgun!

9
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:35,625
That's that old guy's, right?

10
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:37,875
[DIAO] What about it?
He gave it to me!

11
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,291
[XIN] Let me see it!

12
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:40,625
[DIAO] No! It's mine now!

13
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:41,791
[LORD CHANGWEN] There is...

14
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,750
[XIN] I won't take it.
I said let me see!

15
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:47,208
My lord, did you
say something?

16
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:48,583
There is one.

17
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:51,041
There is one significantly
large force

18
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:54,625
not bound to Lü or to Jie Shi.

19
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:56,291
I have been thinking of that

20
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:58,833
ever since we
first arrived here.

21
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,541
[ZHENG]
The likelihood is small.

22
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:04,208
We can only go to meet them...

23
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:09,333
The mountain folk, and the
mountain king who rules them.

24
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:15,041
[NARRATOR] Ancient China.

25
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:16,666
The time of the
sages was over,

26
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,250
swept away by base human greed.

27
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:21,083
Over five centuries
an endless storm

28
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:24,541
of war, hatred, and strife
raged across the land.

29
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:26,791
Over a hundred nations fell,
winnowed away

30
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:28,958
until only seven remained.

31
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:31,625
Now, from Qin,
the westernmost kingdom,

32
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:33,958
a great wind of history
is about to blow.

33
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:35,750
[NARRATOR] This is
the tale of a nameless boy

34
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:37,916
and a young King
who ran the gauntlet

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,708
in this age of strife.

36
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:41,208
Yaaah!

37
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:26,083
[birds chirping]

38
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,291
[DIAO panting]

39
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,458
Hey! Wait, Zheng!

40
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,250
[sighs]
I'd never heard about

41
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,416
mountain king's
existence before.

42
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,875
Does that mean in the
mountains there's a country

43
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:40,000
just like Qin, with a king,
too, and everything?

44
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:43,250
No. It means something
a bit different.

45
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,750
As you are well aware,

46
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:48,750
the mountain folk all live
their lives as separate tribes,

47
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:51,041
but it's said that
they sometimes unite

48
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:53,583
for the benefit of all.

49
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,250
The one who speaks for and
advises that confederation

50
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:59,208
is the one we call
the mountain king.

51
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,041
[XIN] Hey, Zheng.

52
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,041
[DIAO gasps]

53
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:05,125
[SOLDIERS breathing heavily]

54
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,833
Some of them are
starting to fall behind.

55
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,666
None of that
shuffling along, men!

56
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,166
[XIN] We're not
out here for a stroll!

57
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,541
[BI]
How can you say that, Xin?

58
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:23,208
You haven't the least idea
how exhausted we truly are.

59
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,541
[XIN] So what? Slow is slow!

60
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,333
If we're shuffling
along like this,

61
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:30,250
that Cheng Jiao or whatnot
is gonna become King!

62
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,958
[LORD CHANGWEN] Uh!

63
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,666
Blasted little one.

64
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,041
But if we don't hurry now...

65
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,375
[LORD CHANGWEN] We must
bring our King before

66
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:45,625
the mountain king
with all possible haste.

67
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,125
[LORD CHANGWEN] And more,

68
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,458
there may possibly
still be pursuers.

69
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:57,875
[PLATOON LEADER 7A]
Don't lose focus.

70
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:01,750
Minister Jie has
rigorous expectations.

71
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,166
Who knows what punishment
we may all face

72
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,208
if we do not find the boy!

73
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:08,083
[SOLDIERS] Yes, sir!

74
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,875
[SOLDIERS gasp]

00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:16,000
[SOLDIERS sigh in relief]

[yelling]

00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:34,916
[commotion]

81
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,291
What--What? What in the...?!

82
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:46,291
[squelch]
[groans]

83
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:53,458
[whistles]

84
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,416
[DIAO] Whoa!

85
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:11,875
[DIAO] Wow, amazing view!

86
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,125
[DIAO] But still, Zheng,

87
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,291
how is it you know the way
through these mountains

88
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,833
to the mountain king's keep?

89
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,625
[ZHENG] Duke Mu's
summer retreat was built

90
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:26,625
at the halfway point between
Qin's capital Xianyang

91
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,583
and the mountain king's keep.

92
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,916
So the general
direction is clear,

93
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,541
[ZHENG] and if we rely
on the appearing markers,

94
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:37,083
we'll come to the
mountain king's keep.

95
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,916
[DIAO] Ooh.

96
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,916
[XIN] Oh, I see.

97
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,666
[groans]

98
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,083
C'mon, get up!

99
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,791
Huh? What the
heck's going on?

100
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:56,833
I'm just fine.

101
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,125
Someone give him
a shoulder to lean on.

102
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:00,083
[LORD CHANGWEN] No!

103
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,333
Huh?

104
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:02,833
Those who can't keep up

105
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:06,000
will return to Duke Mu's
retreat and stand by.

106
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,291
[BI] My lord?

107
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,291
Hear me, everyone!

108
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,541
I'll have those
who slow our march

109
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:14,333
drop out immediately.
Burn it into your brains!

110
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:17,083
[ALL gasp]

111
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,583
Wait, my lord!

112
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,916
Holding to that, you realize
that most of the men

113
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,833
will drop out
on the road ahead!

114
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,541
There's no other way.

115
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:27,291
Just as Xin says,
if Cheng Jiao ends up

116
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:30,541
taking the throne,
everything will be for nothing.

117
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:34,000
[LORD CHANGWEN]
We must all make haste.

118
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,375
Pardon me,
but no one will then remain

119
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:38,375
to guard and protect the King

120
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,291
against those
fearsome mountain folk

121
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:43,791
if we don't protect the King
with every last soldier...

122
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,416
They're fearsome?

123
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,666
Just think. If the mountain
folk attack us all in earnest,

124
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,000
it will definitely not
make a whit of difference

125
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,583
whether all these men
are there or not.

126
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:55,833
[XIN] Just hold on!

127
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:58,541
What's this about
"fearsome mountain folk"?

128
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,583
Aren't the mountain folk

129
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,750
the nice guys who
carefully preserved

130
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:05,916
Duke Mu's place
for 400 years?

131
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,416
I see.

132
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,666
You don't know the tale of
the "Horse &amp; Liquor Force."

133
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,875
"Horse &amp; Liquor Force"?

134
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:21,791
[BI] About 400 years
before the present,

135
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:25,291
the sovereign of our land
of Qin was so open-hearted

136
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,833
that he presented liquor
to the mountain folk

137
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:31,666
who'd unknowingly
hunted a horse he owned.

138
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,625
[XIN] I know! Duke Mu, right?

139
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:34,791
[BI] That's right.

140
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:38,375
It was the 13th year
of Duke Mu's reign.

141
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:42,166
There had once been
a Kingdom of Jin.

142
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,666
[XIN] A Kingdom of Jin?

143
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,916
[BI] Yes.

144
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,833
At the time, that kingdom
to the east of Qin

145
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:50,291
had been visited
by a great famine.

146
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,708
[BI] Jin was an enemy kingdom,

147
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:57,833
but to save those suffering
from hunger, Duke Mu sent food.

148
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:00,958
[XIN] Whoa!
What a guy, that Duke Mu!

149
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,750
[BI] Then, in the next year,

150
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:06,250
our land of Qin
was visited by famine.

151
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,875
[BI]
But when Duke Mu sought aid,

152
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:14,666
Jin attacked, attempting
to overrun our land.

153
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,958
What?!
But who would do that?!

154
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,791
[BI] At this,
even Duke Mu was so furious

155
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:24,208
he stood at the head
of the army and fought.

156
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,083
The men of Qin, though,

157
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:31,541
lacking substantial food,
grew weaker and weaker.

158
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:35,833
And Duke Mu was surrounded
by Jin's great army.

159
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,291
[XIN] Uh! Oh no!

160
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,666
Duke Mu was in a real pinch!

161
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:44,958
[BI] It was certain death.

162
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:47,708
But just then
they came forth...

163
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,666
[groans]

164
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,291
[BI] The fabled ones we call
the "Horse &amp; Liquor Force."

165
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:59,125
300 mountain folk enshrouded
in a strange aura of death.

166
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,125
[XIN] Mountain folk?

167
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,458
[DIAO] But why?

168
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:04,541
They had all come to repay
their debt to Duke Mu...

169
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,750
For the horse and the liquor.

170
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:09,875
I understand. They're the
"Horse &amp; Liquor Force"!

171
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,083
But then that would make them

172
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,208
really great people,
wouldn't it?

173
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:16,041
They certainly took
their duty seriously.

174
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,666
However...

175
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,375
[yelling]

176
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,791
[BI] It's said that their
fighting was so savage

177
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,541
that even the Qin soldiers,

178
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:26,125
whose side they'd taken,
felt terror.

179
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,666
[XIN] Huh?

180
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:32,500
[BI] What's more,
after a mere 300 of them

181
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:36,375
routed thousands of enemy
troops and saved Duke Mu,

182
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,291
they seized the enemy king.

183
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:48,375
[BI] The mountain folk are
a fearsomely warlike people.

184
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,583
It's wishful thinking
to believe because

185
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:53,791
they preserve Duke Mu's
retreat that the mountain folk

186
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:56,791
bear goodwill toward
the people of Qin.

187
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:59,166
Since we were the ones
who cut off relations

188
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,083
after Duke Mu's death,

189
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,583
a more natural
assumption might be

190
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:05,125
that they detest us.

191
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,500
And now we are all
setting foot in their realm

192
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,083
without their
permission, you see.

193
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:14,208
What'll become of us
if we are seen as enemies?

194
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,958
I now get it.

195
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,583
Now I really understand
how fearsome

196
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,500
the mountain folk truly are.

197
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,208
[BI] You understand?

198
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:22,625
And that's why--

199
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:25,208
And that's why making
allies with them is worthwhile.

200
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:28,000
[gasps]

201
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,333
That's it, right, Zheng?

202
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:32,750
Indeed it is.

203
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,875
[DIAO] Hey, Zheng's way
ahead all alone!

204
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,000

[LORD CHANGWEN] Even in
becoming an official,

208
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:21,750
I've always thought myself
a warrior at the ready.

209
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:25,625
Aging is a
frightening thing.

210
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:26,791
[LORD CHANGWEN] Just the same,

00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,291
this is no time for whining.

[LORD CHANGWEN]
The only sword His Highness

can rely on is me.

00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,458
[LORD CHANGWEN]
That one can't do it.

215

His temperament is too direct.

216
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,458
The path out of
this warring world

217
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:52,750
can't be cut simply
through martial skills.

Go defend the King, now!

[LORD CHANGWEN] Form a

If they were so inclined,

they would have
attacked already.

You're saying they
came out to greet us?

They're carrying some
wicked gear to do so.

to be your sword and all?

A sword isn't needed
for a discussion.

[MESSENGER 7A]
General Wang Yi!

Orders have come
from Minister Jie

for you to assume command
of the garrison at Hangu Pass.

[WANG YI] Tell him a passive
role isn't to my taste,

and that I decline.

[MESSENGER 7A] Yes, sir!

[WANG YI]
The Hangu Pass, huh?

299
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:31,125
[NARRATOR] The Hangu Pass
is an important barrier,

300
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,833
the keystone of
Qin's eastern defenses.

301
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:37,208
[NARRATOR] To prevent Lü
Buwei's army from returning

302
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,791
to Qin from its
expedition in Wei,

303
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:43,708
Jie Shi's side must
hold this Hangu Pass.

304
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,875
[WANG YI] Sounds like Jie Shi's
started preparations

305
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,375
for an all-out fight with Lü.

306
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:55,250
Now that the King is gone,
things have started moving...

307
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,666
His returning
to center stage now

308
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:02,000
would be a difficult feat,
wouldn't it, Teng?

309
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,583
Yes, a difficult feat.

310
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,875
[WANG YI] Ying Zheng...

311
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:17,333
an unlucky king born
in a peculiar context.

312
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:20,500
Prince Zheng will
surpass King Zhao!

313
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:24,583
[WANG YI] Hmmm...

314
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:27,666
In what way could he
surpass King Zhao,

315
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,500
the "god of the battlefield"?

316
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:33,791
[WANG YI] I would
sure like to see that.

317
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,750
In the end,
his Highness went on alone

318
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:50,833
out of concern for us.

319
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:54,666
But Zheng, being invited
counts for something.

320
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,375
He'll be okay, right?

321
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,791
You don't call that
an invitation.

322
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,250
It's an abduction.

323
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:06,291
He is gonna
get himself killed now.

324
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:09,958
[DIAO] Hey! Don't say stuff
like that so casually!

325
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,291
[grunts]

326
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,666
[XIN] He's definitely
gonna get himself killed.

327
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,875
[DIAO] Hey!

328
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:16,625
[grunts] What on Earth
was he thinking?

329
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,291
"Get the support
of the mountain folk."

330
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,166
--[LORD CHANGWEN grunts]
--[XIN yells]

331
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,875
[DIAO yells]

332
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,000
[LORD CHANGWEN yells]

333
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:34,166
[yells]

334
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,500
What are you doing you...

335
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:43,916
...you crazy,
insane old man?!

336
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:51,541
[groans]

337
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:55,125
[XIN] Ha! I knew you'd
injured your leg, old man!

338
00:20:55,208 --> 00:21:01,375
My lord!
Whatever is the matter?

339
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,166
Go ahead, Xin.

340
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,875
Huh?

341
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,916
It pains me to say it,

342
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,375
but the truth is you're
more useful than me now.

343
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:15,166
[LORD CHANGWEN]
Go after the King! Please!

344
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:19,416
[BI] My lord is bowing his head
to another besides the King...

345
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,166
[BI] And to a no-name
serving-boy, at that.

346
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:41,750
[XIN] Bowing your head
is pointless, old man.

347
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:45,750
Zheng said a sword isn't
needed for discussion.

348
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:49,208
[XIN] That means if the
discussion doesn't go well,

349
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:52,000
he will need a sword, right?

350
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:56,208
[XIN] Hm!
That's why from the get go,

351
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:57,625
I meant to give it some time

352
00:21:57,708 --> 00:22:00,833
then go after Zheng
and protect him.

353
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:02,458
I see.

354
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:05,208
In that case,
go quickly, you fool.

355
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,416
[XIN]
Quiet. I am going now!

356
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:12,375
[grunting]

357
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:15,458
Heal your leg in Duke Mu's
house while you wait.

358
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:16,875
See ya!

359
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:19,375
Wait! I'm going, too!

360
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:21,708
[LORD CHANGWEN] Xin.

361
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:24,000
What? Do you ever quit?!

362
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:28,625
[LORD CHANGWEN]
I'm sorry about Piao.

363
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:34,416
[LORD CHANGWEN] It wasn't
supposed to be this way.

364
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,875
Forgive me.

365
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:47,000
[LORD CHANGWEN]
Ward the King well!

366
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:48,625
[XIN] Yeah...

367
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:55,666
[XIN] What on Earth
do you mean, "your path"?!

368
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,208
[NARRATOR]
Carrying the burden of a

369
00:24:57,291 --> 00:24:59,250
bloodstained history of spite,

370
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:01,750
two kings now
confront one another.

371
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,208
[NARRATOR] Next Time:
"Each One's Dream."
