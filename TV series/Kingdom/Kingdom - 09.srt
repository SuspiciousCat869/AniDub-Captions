The time of the sages was over,

Over five centuries,
an endless storm of

war, hatred, and strife
raged across the land.

Over a hundred nations fell,

a great wind of history
is about to blow.

Piao and I used to
long for the day

77
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:26,041
that we'd be able to
sit astride horses.

I heard something interesting
at the market today.

00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,166
[PIAO] Apparently, until the
era of King Wuling of Zhao,

84
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,708
nobody rode horses to battle.

[PIAO] He was the king
of Zhao 80 years ago.

00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,750
He's the one who created
the Middle Kingdom's

[PIAO] He got rid of
the idea that horses

91
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,083
were just for pulling carts.

on those animals?

[PIAO] Actually,
they're super powerful!

96
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:11,750

about the time

97
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,041
he was on the battlefield.

98
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,750
He said that a whole
troop of foot soldiers

99
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,250
was scattered by
a single horseman.

[PIAO] Only regulars
from the warrior nobility

are allowed to be cavalry.

107

We must start off
as foot soldiers

and build the skills
to join the warrior class.

we allowed to ride.

00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,500
Once things
have been settled,

162
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:58,541
I'll reward him by making
him one of Lan Kai's toys.

163
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,416
[CHENG JIAO]
Which reminds me, Si Shi...

164
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,708
My lord?

165
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,208
Ying Zheng's head
still isn't here yet, is it?

166
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,416
My patience is reaching an end.

167
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,666
[SI SHI]
Of course...

168
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,958
We're still searching
for him, Your Majesty.

169
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:12,500
[CHENG JIAO] Si Shi,
I'm letting you and yours

170
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,833
do as you like
with the kingdom.

171
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:19,333
In return, you and yours must
deliver Ying Zheng's head!

172
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,083
That is my only command.

173
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,708
But make no mistake...

174
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:25,416
If it's not obeyed,
your lives are at risk.

175
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,833
[JIE SHI laughs]

176
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:32,125
Please try not to
worry yourself so much,

177
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,041
my young lord.

178
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:37,708
As Minister of the Left,
I give you my word--

179
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,875
no, I promise
on my very life,

180
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:42,125
that you'll have
the King's head soon.

181
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,375
[JIE SHI] Now that
Lord Changwen is gone,

182
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,625
the King has nowhere to go.

183
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:50,333
He must be suffering in
anguish even as we speak.

184
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:52,333
When you think
of things that way,

185
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:55,000
isn't it a pleasure
to draw out the wait

186
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,625
for the day he
shows himself again?

187
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,666
More importantly,

188
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,666
the King's existence is
but a trifling matter now.

189
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,916
The bigger picture
demands our attention.

190
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:10,791
Lü Buwei...

191
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,958
[TROOP 9A]
You're safe!

192
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,333
[TROOP 9B]
Show me...

193
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,625
[TROOP 9C] Where are
the water and rations?

194
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,875
[CAVALRY COMMANDER 9A]
Company Six.

195
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,458
31 members have returned.

196
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,833
[SOLDIER 9E]
Oh! So you're all okay, too!

197
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:33,500
We have some injuries.
Please, take care of them.

198
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:34,875
[SOLDIER 9F]
Yes, sir.

199
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,125
Nonetheless...

200
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,208
[SOLDIER 9E]
Huh?

201
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:38,958
[CAVALRY COMMANDER 9A]
To be honest,

202
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,416
it surprises me
that this many survived.

203
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,500
[SOLDIER 9E]
Yes. We've sent out scouts

204
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,541
to round up the routed
and scattered troops.

205
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:46,958
Still more will join us.

206
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,833
I see.

207
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,208
What of our lord?

208
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:51,750
I heard he was safe,
but where is he? Did he leave?

209
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:52,958
He's up above.

210
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,708
Above?

211
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:04,833
Huh?

212
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,791
[rumbling]

213
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:10,708
[LORD CHANGWEN] The mountains...
they're trembling.

214
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,416
[SOLDIER 9F]
Wha... What's that?!

215
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,833
[SOLDIER 9G]
What is that sound?

216
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:21,583
[XIN yelling]

217
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:24,208
[XIN]
Ha, ha! I win!

218
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,333
Huh?

219
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:49,000
We've returned.
Thank you for the welcome.

220
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,125
[LORD CHANGWEN] We've been
waiting for you anxiously.

221
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:04,208
[XIN] Diao, hurry over
here with that grass!

222
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:07,333
The poor thing must be
absolutely starving! Huh?

223
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:08,791
Commander?

224
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,291
[TAJIFU grunts]

225
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:14,208
[BA JIO] Boy, Tajifu
says he's surprised.

226
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:17,541
That there is our most
temperamental horse.

227
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,500
He says it's an
impressive feat.

228
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,791
Even among the mountain folk,
few have been able to ride it.

229
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:27,250
[XIN laughs] Well, you know, for
someone like me, it's... huh?

230
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,916
Wait, you purposely dumped
a wild horse on me?!

231
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,541
Hey!

232
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,916
[DIAO]
Xin!

233
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,166
[XIN]
You're slow!

234
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,458
[DIAO] Ugh, I swear,
you're so hard on people!

235
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:39,875
I noticed something.

236
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,375
[XIN]
Hm?

237
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:44,625
Aren't there more of Lord
Changwen's troops than before?

238
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,791
[DIAO] They're overflowing
from that cave.

239
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,250
[XIN]
Yeah...

240
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:52,000
[XIN] Looks like old Lord
Changwen hasn't been

241
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,125
sitting on his butt
and waiting around.

242
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,708
It feels like things
are livening up.

243
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:58,666
Gotta admit,
I'm getting pretty pumped!

244
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,666
[SOLDIER 9H]
Xin!

245
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,583
[BOTH]
Huh?

246
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:01,791
[XIN]
Uh--

247
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,750
You did a great job
rescuing His Majesty.

248
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,625
Not only that,
but you came back

249
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,500
at the head of
the mountain folk...

250
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:08,625
I was wrong about you!

251
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,125
[SOLDIER 9I]
So was I!

252
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,208
At first I thought you were
just a kid with bad manners,

253
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,500
but I take it back!

254
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,541
What's this?
Who are those kids?

255
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:16,916
That's Xin and Diao.

256
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,333
After our troops
fell back in the mountains,

257
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,625
those two pursued
the King with Lieutenant Bi

258
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,166
as far as the
mountain folk's stronghold.

259
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,708
[CAVALRY COMMANDER 9A]
Huh...

260
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,166
[door creaks]

261
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,791
Heya! Is the strategy
council already over?

262
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,666
[BI] Xin! We haven't
even begun yet!

263
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,916
And more importantly,

264
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,333
you can't just traipse
in here as you please!

265
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,125
[XIN] What's wrong?
[BI] Huh?

266
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:05,416
[XIN] Your face is
really red, Bi, my man.

267
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,500
[DIAO] I get it...
he's got a crush!

268
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:08,666
[BI]
What are you talking about?

269
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,208
[DIAO]
Oh, I think you know...

270
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,666
[TAJIFU grunts]

271
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,666
[BA JIO] Tajifu says
your face doesn't match

272
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,375
our king's tastes or standards.

273
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:17,458
[BI]
Just what are you saying?

274
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,583
Can we talk about this later?

275
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,333
The point is, we should
head out right away!

276
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,291
We've got a lot of
momentum right now!

277
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:24,916
Warfare's all about momentum!

278
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,791
Who needs detailed plans?

279
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,833
Let's power it on
out of here! Let's go!

280
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,750
Oh boy. Here we go again.

281
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,375
[YANG DUANHE]
He has a point.

282
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:33,833
As Xin says,

283
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:37,958
maintaining momentum is an
important factor in warfare.

284
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:40,291
But... momentum alone
would only win

285
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:44,416
perhaps a single battle between
small kingdoms, at most.

286
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,625
We are about to attack
the capital of Qin,

287
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,875
so we must know our enemy well.

288
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,041
We must know how their
forces are deployed...

289
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:54,333
and we need a stratagem
for surmounting the walls.

290
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:57,083
The capital of Qin... oh man.

291
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,750
If the four of you
would like to

292
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,333
join the war council,

293
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:03,291
sit right there
and don't say a word.

294
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,250
[ZHENG]
Hmph.

295
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,416
[XIN]
Stop it, Zheng!

296
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,208
[LORD CHANGWEN]
Your Majesty...

297
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:23,000
In the time since our army
descended from the mountains,

298
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,416
I've been sending
my men into Xianyang.

299
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,583
They had been ordered to gather
as much information as possible.

300
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:29,541
[ZHENG]
Tell me.

301
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:30,958
My liege.

302
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,208
To begin with,
there's been a large shift

303
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:34,875
in the enemy
forces' deployment.

304
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,958
The word is that,
for some reason,

305
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,416
there's been a
report of my death,

306
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,333
so their attention
has shifted from

307
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:43,333
Your Majesty over to
dealing with Lü Buwei.

308
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,291
[ZHENG]
Jie Shi has begun to move?

309
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:46,583
[LORD CHANGWEN]
Yes.

310
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:50,041
They say that recently,
an army of 80,000

311
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,708
has been mustered in Xianyang.

312
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:52,416
Huh?!

313
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,833
80,000?!

314
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:56,625
C-Commander, how many
tribesmen do we have?

315
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:59,208
[BA JIO]
About 3,000.

316
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,250
That... That's not
even close to enough!

317
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:05,375
[DIAO]
80,000...

318
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,666
--ZHENG] Hmph.
--[XIN] What?

319
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,375
The numbers
will be adequate.

320
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:11,833
[XIN, DIAO]
Wha--?!

321
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,666
[XIN]
3,000 against 80,000?!

322
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,458
What's adequate about that?!
Have you completely lost it?

323
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:19,458
Old Man Changwen,
you tell him!

324
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,791
It's just as
His Majesty says.

325
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,916
[XIN]
Huh?

326
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,750
The numbers
will be appropriate

327
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,666
for carrying out our stratagem.

328
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,750
A stratagem?

329
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,000
[LORD CHANGWEN]
But before we depart,

330
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:32,166
there's something I will
need you all to make.

331
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,708
To make?

332
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,583
[LORD CHANGWEN]
To begin with...

333
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,791
Huh?

334
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,708
Ah. Risen already, Your Majesty?

335
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:55,208
[ZHENG]
Yes.

336
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:57,000
[LORD CHANGWEN]
Finally we come to it.

337
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,375
[ZHENG]
Mm-hm.

338
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,666
The preparations
seem to be coming along.

339
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,833
Yes.

340
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:11,666
[DIAO, SOLDIERS laughing]

341
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,458
[DIAO] Whoa, that mask
is amazing, Xin!

342
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:15,708
[XIN]
Shut up!

343
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:26,500
[laughing]

344
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:27,875
[ZHENG]
You're finished, then?

345
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,708
[DIAO]
Zheng!

346
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:33,291
Look at this! It's the mask
Xin made! Isn't it amazing?

347
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:37,500
[XIN] Quiet, you.
I made it funny on purpose!

348
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,333
[ZHENG] That's good work,
by your standards.

349
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:40,833
[XIN]
Don't laugh at it!

350
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:43,583
[DIAO] I made one for you
as well, Zheng. Here it is.

351
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:44,791
Honestly...

352
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,541
Ordering us to make
all this weird stuff...

353
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,416
What are we supposed
to do with it, anyway?!

354
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,916
You'll understand later.

355
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,541
More importantly,
have you finished preparing?

356
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:54,833
Preparing what?
I already made the mask.

357
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,583
[ZHENG]
I mean preparing this.

358
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,416
[XIN coughing]

359
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,166
This is going to be
a real pitched battle.

360
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,375
[XIN]
Tch. Don't patronize me.

361
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,208
I've been ready for that
kind of fight for a long time.

362
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,791
I've trained for it, after all.

363
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,500
All those years with
Piao were for this.

364
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,083
[ZHENG]
Bi!

365
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:19,125
Gather everyone up!
Prepare to depart immediately!

366
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:20,458
Yes, sir!

367
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,541
We're going home...
to Xianyang!

368
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,791
[SOLDIERS]
Huzzah!

369
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,666
[JIE SHI]
Our adversary is Lü Buwei.

370
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:48,208
If things go badly and we lose
this decisive battle to him,

371
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,375
that merchant
spawn will end up

372
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,000
taking the throne
from you, my lord.

373
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:55,333
Just thinking about it
makes me nauseated.

374
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:58,666
We must return the Royal Court
to its pure and proper state,

375
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,083
no matter what the cost.

376
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:12,166
[laughter]

377
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,375
[FLUNKY 9A] That minister
of Zhao who came to court

378
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:17,125
the other day, was gushing with
praise for my lord Cheng Jiao.

379
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:18,375
He said he expects
you'll become

380
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,375
an esteemed king of rare worth.

381
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,291
[FLUNKY 9B] Because of you,
my lord Cheng Jiao,

382
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:25,041
the future of Qin's
next generation is secure!

383
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,333
[FLUNKIES laughing]

384
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,833
[FLUNKY 9A]
What's the matter, my lord?

385
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:32,166
[CHENG JIAO]
There's no bridge.

386
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,791
[FLUNKY 9C] My lord,
there's a bridge over there...

387
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,791
I want one here.

388
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:42,833
[CHENG JIAO laughs]

389
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:54,750
[FLUNKIES murmuring]

390
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,000
[FLUNKY 9A] Cheng Jiao
isn't the heir to the throne!

391
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,625
[FLUNKY 9C]
They say it's Ying Zheng.

392
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:01,375
[FLUNKY 9D]
Ying Zheng?!

393
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,625
[CHENG JIAO] Ying Zheng?
I don't know anyone

394
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,250
by that name!
Who is he?!

395
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:07,083
[FLUNKY 9E]
Ah... Apparently, he is

396
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,000
my lord Cheng Jiao's
elder brother.

397
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,208
[CHENG JIAO]
Elder brother?

398
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,500
I never heard
I had an elder brother!

399
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,791
[FLUNKY 9E] Ying Zheng's
mother is of low station,

400
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,416
so she'd never come forward.

401
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,583
But despite that,
the word now is that

402
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,625
there's been an informal
decision to make her

403
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,208
the King's official consort,

404
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,125
and to install
her son, Ying Zheng,

405
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,750
as the new heir to the throne
instead of you, my lord.

406
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,416
She's of low station?

407
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,125
You're saying
the next king will be

408
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,708
the brat of a woman like that?

409
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,958
[FLUNKY 9E] Please, keep
your voice down, my lord!

410
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,791
Ying Zheng is
already here at Court.

411
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,458
You must be careful!

412
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:46,291
[FLUNKIES laughing]

413
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,291
[CHENG JIAO]
He looked down on me.

414
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:54,875
That bastard...
He looked down on me!

415
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,333
How dare he humiliate me?

416
00:20:57,416 --> 00:21:00,000
Me, the most royal of royalty!

417
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,916
[CHENG JIAO] What do you mean,
I can't see my mother?

418
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,583
[LADY OF THE COURT 9A]
My lord...

419
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:07,250
She's fallen ill, and no one
may see her, not even you.

420
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:11,041
Leave at once, please,
my lord Cheng Jiao.

421
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,125
[CHENG JIAO]
My mother was sick...

422
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:18,500
I thought it was just an
excuse for her not to see me.

423
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:21,958
But my mother's
"illness" was genuine.

424
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,916
When her throne and
position were stolen

425
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,125
by a woman of low birth,
she grew sick at heart.

426
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:31,875
My lord Cheng Jiao.
Please, stand right over there.

427
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,458
Our troops are
gathered for the war

428
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:37,500
that will strike down Lü Buwei
and make you King of Qin.

429
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:40,375
Your men stand ready
to fight for you.

430
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:48,000
[SOLDIERS yell]

431
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:03,250
Yes, this is how
things should be.

432
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:16,666
[SOLDIER whooping, yelling]

433
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,208
[DIAO]
Yahoo!

434
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:20,250
[XIN]
Hiyaah!

435
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:21,916
[BI]
Xin?

436
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:27,041
[LORD CHANGWEN]
Churlish little fool,

437
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:29,583
riding out in front of
His Majesty like that...

438
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:32,041
It's fine. Let him
do what he likes.

439
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,625
[LORD CHANGWEN]
Is something the matter, Bi?

440
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:38,625
[BI]
No... it's nothing.

441
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:40,208
[LORD CHANGWEN]
Hm...

442
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:50,958
[BI]
Xin... Piao...

443
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:53,708
The two of you
really are the same...

444
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,375
[ZHENG] We're here, at last.

445
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:06,833
It took us an
awful long time.

446
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:09,541
[DIAO]
Then, you're saying that's...

447
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:11,125
That's right.

448
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:14,458
[ZHENG] That... That is
the capital of Qin...

449
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:16,125
...Xianyang.

450
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:54,541
[XIN] There's no
choice but to do it!

451
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:56,791
There's nothing
left but to do it!

452
00:24:56,875 --> 00:24:58,500
[NARRATOR]
An impregnable wall.

453
00:24:58,583 --> 00:25:01,500
The stratagem for breaking
through it begins to fall apart.

454
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,958
Next Time:
"Storming the Capital."
