1
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:18,708
[LÜ BUWEI] My, oh my.

2
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:21,541
Returning to the Capital
is fraught with difficulties.

3
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:23,375
So be it.

4
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:24,583
Raise the flag!

5
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:25,791
[LÜ BUWEI] It will be
pleasurable to see

6
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:29,791
with my own eyes
with what face the King

7
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:33,708
who strangely survived
will greet our arrival.

8
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:35,625
[LÜ BUWEI chuckles]

9
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:42,958
[laughing]

10
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:45,416
[NARRATOR] Ancient China...

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,875
The time of the sages was over,
swept away by base human greed.

12
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:51,041
Over five long and
harrowing centuries,

13
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:53,583
an endless storm of war,
hatred, and strife

14
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:55,291
raged across the land.

15
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:56,750
Over a hundred nations fell,

16
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:59,208
winnowed away until
only seven remained.

17
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:01,625
Now, from Qin, the
westernmost kingdom,

18
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:04,250
a great wind of history
is about to blow.

19
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:06,791
This is the tale of a
nameless boy and a young king

20
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:09,458
who ran the gauntlet
in this age of strife

21
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:10,833
[yelling]

22
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,083
[XING] Hey, you!

23
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:55,083
You're getting
nowhere real fast,

24
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,666
moving so little at a time.

25
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,083
Hustle, boy, hustle!

26
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,708
[XIN grunts]

27
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,166
Sheesh... you're hopeless!

28
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,416
[XIN growls]

29
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,791
[XIN sighs] I'm home...

30
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:18,250
Had a long day?
Supper is ready right now!

31
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,000
Huh...?

32
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,458
[XIN chuckles]

33
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:25,791
[XIN sighs]

34
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:30,416
[XIN] Whew! That was filling!
I am just stuffed!

35
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,541
[XIN sighs]

36
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:32,500
[DIAO growls]

37
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,250
That is not a compliment.

38
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,791
[DIAO] But still,
it is really peaceful.

39
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:42,875
That recent battle at the Royal
Court just doesn't seem real.

40
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,333
You're working,
earning a bit of money.

41
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:49,041
I gather wild plants
to save on food.

42
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:52,708
We're getting by somehow
like normal folk.

43
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:55,666
Yeah, getting by
like normal people!

44
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,000
Things are good,
wouldn't you say?!

45
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,166
[XIN] Call it
a momentary breather.

46
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,375
[DIAO gasps]

47
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,750
No.

48
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:05,625
See, what I mean is,
we'll get by like normal folk

49
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,791
so it doesn't have to
be a momentary--

50
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:10,458
[XIN yawns]

51
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,708
I'm gonna go to sleep.

52
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:13,958
[DIAO] Huh...?

53
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,416
[DIAO groans]

54
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:21,583
[DIAO snores softly]

55
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:30,916
[XIN] Just as Diao says, we're
getting by like normal folk.

56
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,458
I don't think it's
a bad life, either.

57
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,458
But I can't keep up
like this forever.

58
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:39,208
I've got to go to war
to achieve things,

59
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:42,041
to drive toward
becoming a general...

60
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,458
[XIN yells]

61
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,083
[XIN grunts]

62
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:51,083
[XIN] The shoulder where
Zuo Ci got me

63
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,625
still isn't back to normal.

64
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:53,416
[door rattles]

65
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,333
[DIAO] Xin!

66
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:55,083
[XIN] Huh?

67
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:57,500
What is it, Diao?

68
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,791
My... From Zheng...

69
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:00,791
From Zheng?

70
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,000
[DIAO sobs]

71
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,958
I haven't got the money
he promised me yet!

72
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,000
[DIAO whimpers]

73
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,250
[XIN] The money... he promised?

74
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:09,958
[DIAO] Mmm-hmm.

75
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,791
[XIN sighs]

76
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:14,208
[XIN] Don't startle
me like that!

77
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:32,250
[DIAO] If you were that angry
at me, why come along, Xin?

78
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,583
Why, you say?

79
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,000
Just... It's 'cuz, um...

80
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:39,041
You're gonna get a load of cash
from Zheng, right?

81
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:42,625
So I'm kind of... like a
bodyguard on your way home

82
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:45,333
so you don't get
mugged by bandits.

83
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:46,583
Oh ho ho!

84
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,125
[XIN] Eh?

85
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:51,083
It's all because you want
to see Zheng, isn't it?

86
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,500
[XIN growls]

87
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,625
Why-Why would I
ever want to see

88
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:57,875
that unendingly pretentious
sarcastic jerkwad?!

89
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,458
[DIAO giggles]

90
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,708
Hey, wait up, you!

91
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:06,333
[XIN] It is huge no matter
how many times I see it.

92
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:09,625
[DIAO] That's 'cuz it's the
gate to the Royal Court.

93
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:12,916
It has to be this huge
in order to guard the King.

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,500
[DIAO sneezes]

95
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,250
You really think that's okay?

96
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,916
What do you mean?

97
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,750
Well, since the mountain
folk raised hell here

98
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,458
at the Palace just recently,

99
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:25,375
you think you can really get in
dressed like that? 

100
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:28,166
[DIAO] Hmph. Look who's talking!

101
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,625
[GATE GUARD 16A] Hold it!

102
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:33,875
Told you so, didn't I?

103
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,750
You there! Who are you?!

104
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:36,625
[DIAO gasps]

105
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:40,666
Who am I? Well, my name is...

106
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,666
[DIAO] He Liao Diao,
I am called...

107
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,291
...called... called... called...

108
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:47,916
called... called...

109
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,708
[XIN] How dumb are you?!

110
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,291
You think those antics
will get you in--

111
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:52,583
[GATE GUARD 16A] You may enter!

112
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:53,791
Huh?

113
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:54,750
[DIAO] Much obliged!

114
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,625
Wha-What just happened?!

115
00:06:58,416 --> 00:06:59,458
Hey, you!

116
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,583
Are you seriously
guarding this gate?!

117
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:05,291
If something happens to Zheng,
you're gonna pay, understand?!

118
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:06,916
Criticize if you will,

119
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,833
but there's a direct order
from His Highness

120
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:13,250
"to grant such and such a person
egress to the Court said

121
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:16,041
one's name being called,
um, He Liao Diao."

122
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,083
And this portrait...

123
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,750
Uh... Is that right...?

124
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:27,750
Hey, Zheng!
You doin' all right?! Uh?

125
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,916
[XIN] What's... going on? Um...

126
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,375
He has returned.

127
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,500
Uh... Who has?

128
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:49,208
The shadow ruler who
controls this Kingdom of Qin,

129
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,666
Minister Lü Buwei, has.

130
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,583
[DIAO gasps]

131
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:53,875
[XIN gasps]

132
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:56,000
Lü Buwei, you say?

133
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:59,166
Lü Buwei, who took
Zheng's youth as license

134
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,666
to do whatever he liked,

135
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,500
and when the chips were down,
left Zheng to die?

136
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,333
That scumbag, right?

137
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,958
I hate guys like that
more than anything!

138
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,000
[DIAO grunts]

139
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,500
[XIN] This is just perfect.

140
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,041
It's an unmistakable fact

141
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:18,083
that he didn't come to
Zheng's aid whatsoever.

142
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,208
Punish him for it and
that'll speak volumes

143
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,708
of King Zheng of Qin,
paragon of justice.

144
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:27,833
If we could do that,
things would be easy.

145
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,208
What, um...
what do you mean by that?

146
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,541
Though the antagonistic force
of Jie Shi's faction

147
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,708
still remains,
their power is a lot weaker.

148
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:38,666
Lü Buwei's forces are now
the only power in the Court.

149
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,375
In such circumstances,
it's impossible for a King,

150
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,250
no matter his lawfulness,
to try Lü Buwei.

151
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,750
If Lü Buwei should
revolt in earnest,

152
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:50,708
his power isn't on the same
scale as Cheng Jiao's.

153
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:54,250
On the other hand,
our power is extremely weak.

154
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:58,416
It would be like 10 men
facing a force of 10,000.

155
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,958
[XIN] It's not about numbers!

156
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,000
[COUNCIL gasps]

157
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,041
War isn't about numbers!
It's people!

158
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,541
[LORD CHANGWEN]
You are exactly right.

159
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:12,916
Your insight, and this
after only a single fight

160
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,708
to recover the Jeweled Throne
is not bad at all.

161
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:17,458
I'll give you that, even.

162
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,583
However, Xin,

163
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:23,166
in quality of manpower, too,
they are far stronger than us.

164
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,083
Uh... say what?

165
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:30,250
[ZHENG] We haven't
time to bemoan this,

166
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:34,833
my struggle with Lü Buwei
has already begun now.

167
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,458
[COURTIER 16A] Minister,
Lü Buwei has now arrived!

168
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:06,166
[XIN] So at last, this guy
Lü Buwei makes his appearance.

169
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,458
Finally, I'll get a good look
at the face of the guy

170
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,333
who tried to leave
Zheng for dead.

171
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:21,125
[doors creak]

172
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:25,750
[footsteps echoing]

173
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,208
Wh--?

174
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,833
[XIN] What's with them?

175
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:42,708
I feel this stunning
sense of... pressure.

176
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:46,208
It's incredible how each
one of them emanates an aura

177
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:50,291
that's beyond any assassin or
soldier I've fought up 'til now!

178
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,500
[gasping]

179
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,875
[XIN gasps]

180
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:25,708
[LÜ BUWEI] To begin with,

181
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:30,250
I'm utmost glad that you
are well, Your Highness.

182
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,208
[XIN] I can't speak!

183
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:37,208
What is it... this sensation?

184
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:43,083
[XIN] Feels like I'm being
swallowed up... completely...

185
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:47,416
[LÜ BUWEI] Leaping right in,
Your Highness...

186
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,500
You surely feel displeasure
that I did not dash to rescue

187
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:54,458
during the occasion
of the recent uprising.

188
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,541
[LÜ BUWEI]
Such displeasure is reasonable.

189
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,041
You see,

190
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,791
I was content with the prospect
of Your Highness

191
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,833
meeting his untimely doom,
I'm here to admit.

192
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,458
[XIN] What's this?!

193
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:22,416
He just spat out a confession
that he abandoned Zheng!

194
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,791
Well, this just...
has to clinch things.

195
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,458
[LORD CHANGWEN] No.

196
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:30,416
I understand that Bi
just told you that

197
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,541
for the time being we cannot
bring Lü Buwei to justice.

198
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:35,625
[XIN] But why?

199
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:38,000
Try him or don't try him,

200
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:42,958
that man certainly
wants you dead! Zheng!

201
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,875
Enough of your joking,
Minister Lü.

202
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:49,291
Surely, some event
was the true reason.

203
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,500
Wh--?

204
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:57,208
Is the gap in power
that large? Zheng!

205
00:12:57,291 --> 00:13:03,041
[LÜ BUWEI laughs]

206
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,083
[LÜ BUWEI] It was indeed a joke.

207
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:10,250
A slight offense in hopes of
easing the grim atmosphere.

208
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:13,125
Please forgive me,
Your Highness.

209
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,791
[NARRATOR] Even in an age of
strife, for a follower to seek

210
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:21,166
his king's death is an
odd state of affairs.

211
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,000
[NARRATOR] Faced with Lü Buwei
cavalierly sweeping this

212
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:28,541
into the shadows, Zheng,
Lord Changwen and the others

213
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,625
could say nothing.

214
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:33,583
This scene clearly
showed that there existed

215
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:36,583
an overwhelming
disparity in power.

216
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,541
[OLD MAN chuckles]

217
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:43,416
[OLD MAN] Is the farce now over?

218
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,958
It's been a long time,
Your Highness.

219
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,791
So glad you're hale and hearty.

220
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,375
Cai Ze, huh? It's been awhile.

221
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:55,041
That old man... is he Cai Ze?

222
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,583
You know that guy, Bi, my man?

223
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:01,166
Cai Ze served as a Minister
in the time of King Zhao.

224
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,333
To be exact,
that was three kings ago.

225
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,541
[XIN gasps]

226
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,375
A man that important
is under Lü Buwei?

227
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,416
He is among the first rank
of diplomats,

228
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,166
and I have heard
he was transferred to Yan,

229
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:15,416
which is located in the far east
within the Middle Kingdom.

230
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,833
[ZHENG] When did you return?

231
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:19,083
[CAI ZE] The other day
on an errand.

232
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:22,166
I shall return to the East
very soon.

233
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,708
[ZHENG] Such a burden...

234
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:26,250
Take good care of your health.

235
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,541
[CAI ZE laughs]

236
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:30,250
[CAI ZE] I'm so very
grateful for your concern.

237
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,291
[XIN] What's that oldie's story?

238
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:35,833
He sure comes across as
friendly. Sure he's an enemy?

239
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:39,166
[BI] Cai Ze isn't one
to treat a King lightly.

240
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,125
And yet...

241
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:44,250
Come to manhood swiftly,
Your Highness.

242
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,458
You see...

243
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:49,625
Your humble servant
Cai Ze serves only those

244
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:52,166
of genuine strength.

245
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,000
[CAI ZE laughs]

246
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,625
[CAI ZE] By your leave,
Your Highness...

247
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:06,125
[CAI ZE] You wish to return
soon, too, don't you, Meng Wu?

248
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,625
It's written upon your face.

249
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,375
[MENG WU growls]

250
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:11,916
Of course I do.

251
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,708
I've no time to spend
attending farces either.

252
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,125
[MAN] Watch your words,
Meng Wu.

253
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,458
[MENG WU] Hm?

254
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:20,250
Cai Ze's words aside,

255
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:23,166
you've no standing whatsoever
to call this a "farce."

256
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,666
Speak for yourself!

257
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,375
To whom do you think
you're speaking, Li Si?!

258
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:30,291
The Royal Court is a
place of governance.

259
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:31,875
And governance is a thing

260
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:35,625
that your intelligence can't
understand, or so it appears.

261
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:38,791
Every word has a
deeper meaning, you see.

262
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,125
[MENG WU] Have it your way.

263
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,958
What I look for is
only on battlefields.

264
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,583
[LI SI] Oh?

265
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:47,791
What can you, blustering ahead
with no talent but brute force,

266
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,791
be looking for
on battlefields then?

267
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,375
To prove my prowess.

268
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,166
[LI SI growls]

269
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,708
I, Meng Wu, am the
Middle Kingdom's mightiest!

270
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:02,708
My one and only interest
is just in proving that!

271
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:05,750
The Kingdom's... mightiest?

272
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:08,083
The Middle Kingdom's mightiest?

273
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,791
It's odd, though...

274
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:13,791
One mightier than you
sits right up there now.

275
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,041
Right, Lord Changping?

276
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,500
[DIAO gasps]

277
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,375
Your jokes go too far,
dear Cai Ze.

278
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:23,708
[CAI ZE laughs]

279
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:28,041
Rude of me. Forget I
ever said it then.

280
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,166
[LÜ BUWEI laughs]

281
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,791
[LÜ BUWEI] Are you finished,
all of you, now?

282
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:36,083
Chattering away in front
of His Highness...

283
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:39,500
Thanks to you, I most rudely
need to stretch my legs.

284
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,666
[gasping]

285
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:48,041
Your Highness, please forgive
my underlings' lack of courtesy.

286
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,791
It just stems from their
unwaveringly obeying

287
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,750
their own inner natures.

288
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:55,416
Also, this was
precisely my purpose

289
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,500
in asking an audience
with Your Highness.

290
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:01,833
For now that Jie Shi's
uprising has been suppressed,

291
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:05,500
my underlings will all
quietly keep control over

292
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:09,208
and defend the land of Qin.

293
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,791
Be at ease, Your Highness.

294
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,541
[ZHENG] I appreciate it.

295
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:25,083
[LÜ BUWEI] With that Your
Highness, I take my leave!

296
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:38,958
[CAI ZE] You look to be
enjoying this, Minister.

297
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,916
[LÜ BUWEI] Is that how it looks?

298
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,583
On the inside, His Highness
must have been

299
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:46,083
completely boiling
over with absolute rage

300
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:49,666
just sitting there, but he
did not let it show at all.

301
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:53,208
Impressive for one
so young, I'd say.

302
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:57,708
I really think that you've found
a worthy opponent to play with.

303
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:00,208
That is what
you're thinking, no?

304
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:03,958
Ensnaring a nation's
King as a mere playmate?

305
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,208
What a frightful thing to say...

306
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,625
[LÜ BUWE chuckles]

307
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:12,958
[laughing]

308
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:18,000
[growling]

309
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,166
[BI whimpers]

310
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,291
[LORD CHANGWEN]
Your Highness, please stop!

311
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,875
You'll injure yourself!

312
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:37,583
[XIN] Hey.

313
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,083
Come on, let's get a
little breath of fresh air.

314
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,500
[XIN] I'm just stunned.

315
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,666
Even you have to pound
on stuff sometimes.

316
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,250
[ZHENG] How could I not
with all this?

317
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:54,083
Even with a guy who wants
you dead to your face,

318
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,375
you couldn't say
a single word, huh?

319
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:57,541
[XIN laughs]

320
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,416
You took a drubbing!

321
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,208
[ZHENG] Mm-hm... If it's
humorous, then laugh.

322
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:05,083
This is the reality.

323
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:07,541
He's a big enemy.

324
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,625
[ZHENG] Li Si runs the law.

325
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:13,458
Lord Changping and Meng Wu
run military matters.

326
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:18,041
Cai Ze, manages diplomacy
and general counsel.

327
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,000
These four, called
the "Four Pillars",

328
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:23,083
are the main supporters
bolstering Lü Buwei's force.

329
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:26,666
[XIN] Seeing them, I could tell
all four of them were special.

330
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,041
But the really
dangerous one is him...

331
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,375
[DIAO gasps]

332
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:33,000
[ZHENG] Yes. The man who
binds all underlings,

333
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:35,000
starting with the
"Four Pillars"...

334
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:37,000
Minister Lü Buwei.

335
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,291
[ZHENG] 'Til 13 years ago,

336
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:44,541
Lü Buwei was simply
a foreign merchant.

337
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,500
A foreign merchant?

338
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:51,041
So why is he now
a Minister of Qin, then?

339
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:54,458
[ZHENG] Lü Buwei disbursed
funds to support my father,

340
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:57,083
who was not a candidate
for royal succession.

341
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,625
[ZHENG] Via Lü Buwei's
money and stratagems,

342
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:03,458
my father became King of Qin

343
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:08,250
and as a reward, a Minister's
seat was granted to Lü Buwei.

344
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:12,333
So this was the process by which
Lü Buwei became Minister.

345
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,583
But then, money and tricks alone

346
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,791
can't speed a man
from a commoner

347
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,916
to ruling over a kingdom.

348
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,333
You who aim to become a general
can surely understand this, Xin.

349
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:27,208
[XIN] Yeah. That guy
is the real thing.

350
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:31,125
[ZHENG] Including me, the gap
between our forces is too great.

351
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:32,333
Hey!

352
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,208
Don't tell me you've
already lost the will

353
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:35,541
to fight this, Zheng.

354
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,458
Nonsense.

355
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:40,500
As an opponent,
he has no deficiencies.

356
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,791
[XIN laughs]

357
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,875
[XIN] Has your mood
lightened a bit?

358
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:50,791
It's repulsive that
you're concerned about me.

359
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,250
What?!

360
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:59,500
[XIN] You said it
right here, didn't you...

361
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,375
[ZHENG] When I reach 20
and get crowned,

362
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,666
I'll strip Lü off his
power without failing.

363
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,125
And then...

364
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,541
...I'll set the Middle Kingdom!

365
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,833
[XIN] That's it.

366
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:15,291
[ZHENG] Xin... until then,
rise up the ladder!

367
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:17,708
[XIN] Yep.

368
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:22,166
We can't lose, Zheng.

369
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,708
[ZHENG] Hmph.

370
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:25,958
We've been speaking
of me all this time,

371
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,583
but it's about to
begin for you, too.

372
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,958
[XIN] About to begin? What is?

373
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,708
[ZHENG] The next battle.

374
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:33,833
[DIAO gasps]

375
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:35,708
Is that true, Zheng?!

376
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:38,500
Just now, the Middle Kingdom
has seven kingdoms,

377
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,333
counting our land of Qin,

378
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:42,291
crushing and vying one another.

379
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:45,166
Innumerable sparks
could cause a conflict,

380
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,125
I even hear
that certain nations

381
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:50,291
are making suspicious moves
near all borders.

382
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,833
It would not be strange at all,

383
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:54,458
should the flames of war
suddenly flare up.

384
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:01,041
[XIN growls]

385
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,166
[XIN grunts]

386
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,166
Shall we go home?

387
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,916
Let's go, Diao!

388
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,833
Huh? Um... but I...

389
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:12,500
...haven't gotten my money yet!

390
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:21,958
[XIN pants]

391
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:22,916
[XIN laughs]

392
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,958
[XIN yells]

393
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:30,625
[XING] N-Nice work...

394
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:32,083
[XIN] Thanks!

395
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:35,458
Yeah, my shoulder's good, too!

396
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:37,791
I'm ready to roll right now!

397
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:45,541
[XIN] Umm,
what does all of it say?

398
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:47,500
You're not able to read it?

399
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:49,125
I'll read it for you.

400
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:52,208
Right. So tell me
what's written there.

401
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:54,833
To make it simple, it says:

402
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:57,291
We're invading the
neighboring kingdom of Wei,

403
00:22:57,375 --> 00:23:00,166
so we're recruiting
foot soldiers.

404
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,375
[XIN gasps]

405
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:03,291
What did you just say?!

406
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,875
Diao!

407
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,541
It's great, eh, Xin?

408
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:11,666
At last, your first war!

409
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:12,666
[DIAO gasps]

410
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,125
[DIAO grunts]

411
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:21,125
Yeah!

412
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:54,291
[XIN] This is the
first step toward

413
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:56,666
my becoming the
world's greatest general!

414
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,333
[NARRATOR] The air is heavy.

415
00:24:58,416 --> 00:25:00,708
But souls are on fire.

416
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:03,041
It's a real battle!

417
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:05,291
[NARRATOR] Next Time:
"First Campaign."
