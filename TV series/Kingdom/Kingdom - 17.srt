1
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:20,541
[NARRATOR] The five
centuries of strife:

2
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:23,958
The Spring and Autumn and
Warring States periods.

3
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:25,666
Months and years of battle

4
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,125
winnowed more than
100 nations down to seven.

5
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:31,875
We now know these as
the Seven Warring States.

6
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:35,458
[NARRATOR]
Such unbearably long upheaval

7
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:38,666
led the people to despair
of peace ever returning.

8
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:42,833
[NARRATOR] However,
in the year 246 BC,

9
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:45,041
a young king with
a great destiny

10
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:47,083
ascended the throne of Qin.

11
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:53,750
[NARRATOR] The 31st King
of Qin, Ying Zheng,

12
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:57,666
later to become Shi Huangdi.

13
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:01,250
[NARRATOR]
With Ying Zheng's appearance,

14
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:04,666
a wind of change began to blow
that, while slight,

15
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,458
would usher in the future.

16
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:13,625
[NARRATOR]
Xin was riding that wind.

17
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:16,833
Hehe, this is really something.

18
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:58,208
[NARRATOR] Right now, battles
for control of Xingyang,

19
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:02,750
which was near the border
between Qin and Wei intensified.

20
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:06,958
Xingyang lay along the Yellow
River and was a gateway to Wei.

21
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,666
It would be one of the
most crucial strong points

22
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,166
for either kingdom.

23
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,458
Wei sent three armies to meet
at Xingyang from the rear,

24
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:19,166
and Qin gathered forces from all
over the country to march on it.

25
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,916
Each kingdom's forces
was just over 150,000.

26
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,833
This, the largest battle of the
year, would be Xin's first war.

27
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,958
Finally, my first war.

28
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:33,458
The first step to becoming
one of the greatest generals!

29
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:34,750
[XIN squeals]

30
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:37,750
I'm doing this thing, Piao!

31
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,208
[XIN grunts]

32
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,458
[laughing]

33
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,125
[BOY] You're as
loudmouthed as ever.

34
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,625
What the hell?!

35
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:46,750
Huh...?

36
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:49,333
Long time no see, Xin.

37
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:52,166
Whoa! Wei Ping! Wei Dao!

38
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,000
Hey! It's the thug brothers!

39
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:56,875
I didn't know you'd be here!

40
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:59,875
[WEI PING] Hey don't call
us thugs, you stupid brat!

41
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,291
[ALL laugh]

42
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,250
How's everyone
back in the village?

43
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:06,416
Good. Li Dian's
sarcastic as ever.

44
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,000
Wow, you haven't changed
since you left the village

45
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:12,083
because you're still
saying that stupid stuff

46
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,666
about being the world's
greatest general!

47
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,666
[XIN growls]

48
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,416
It's not stupid!

49
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,833
I'm gonna be the greatest!

50
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:22,125
That's exactly the
stupid part! Stupid brat!

51
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,125
[GUARDS gasp]

52
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:34,583
[DIAO] I am called...
He Liao Diao!

53
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,333
[GUARDS gasp]

54
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:37,875
[GATE GUARD 17A]
You may enter!

55
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
[DIAO] Are we gonna
do this every time?

56
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:48,291
[ZHENG] I see.
Xin's first campaign?

57
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,541
Yep. He was really raring to go.

58
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,083
I don't think he'll be able
to score a victory

59
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,750
right off the bat.

60
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,541
[LORD CHANGWEN]
Ah, here you are.

61
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:58,791
[DIAO] Huh?

62
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:01,833
The Fourth Army
has just taken the field now.

63
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,916
[ZHENG] The Kingdom of Wei...

64
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,708
They've barred Qin's path to
the east for generations.

65
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:10,000
[LORD CHANGWEN] Wei is
surrounded by enemy nations,

66
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,791
and for centuries, they've
spent all of their time on war,

67
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,458
so their entire army
is battle-seasoned.

68
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:19,916
Their chariot squadron is one of
the best in the Middle Kingdom.

69
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,083
Th-The squadron?

70
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,000
That country is a powerful foe.

71
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,166
[DIAO gasps]

72
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,041
X-Xin'll be okay, right?

73
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,541
[LORD CHANGWEN] It's sure
to be a fierce battle.

74
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,791
I only hope he is
able to survive.

75
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,041
Don't say unlucky things!

76
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:39,916
You know Xin would
never die that easily!

77
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,791
It's just like him...

78
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,000
Huh?

79
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:47,625
[ZHENG] I predict this
fight will be harsh.

80
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:55,458
[XIN] What's everybody
all grouped up for?

81
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,625
Form five-man squads!

82
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:00,000
All corporals gather!

83
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,041
Huh? Five?

84
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,875
[BOTH] Huh?

85
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,291
[NARRATOR] During this period,

86
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,250
the system was to
divide foot soldiers

87
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,041
into groups of
"five-man squads."

88
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,250
Squad leaders were
called corporals,

89
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:16,041
and in Qin this squad was the
basic unit of the infantry.

90
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:19,416
These five men would
all share a common fate.

91
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,250
Tian You! Come join my squad!

92
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:28,208
[FOOT SOLDIER 17B] Hey wait, he
was with you last time, jerk!

93
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:30,458
He's in my squad now!

94
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,333
Tian You! Wait a minute!

95
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:33,791
It's Zhong Tie!

96
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,708
Zhong Tie the Killer is here!

97
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:36,875
Perfect!

98
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,416
Please join my squad, Sir!

99
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,625
You'll get the
red-carpet treatment!

100
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:41,500
Huh?!

101
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:42,875
Okay, I get it!

102
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,291
The strongest-looking ones
get picked first, right?

103
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,500
Damn it!

104
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:49,250
But none of these people
don't know about me!

105
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,333
Right!

106
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,583
Everybody listen up!

107
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:56,875
I'm Xin from Cheng Hu Village!

108
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:01,458
I may be a bit small, but I'm
the strongest guy around here!

109
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,541
Take me seriously, clowns!

110
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:10,291
I'm gonna be one of the
world's greatest generals!

111
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,375
Cut it out! You're
embarrassing yourself!

112
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:14,041
[XIN] Let me go, you jerk!

113
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,333
--I'm gonna beat them up!
--[TOUGH GUY 17A] Hey!

114
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:19,000
You must be new recruits.

115
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:22,041
You've got some muscle on you.

116
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,708
[TOUGH GUY 17B]
You the big brother?

117
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:26,041
All right,
we'll let both of you in.

118
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,083
That makes five.

119
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:32,333
Hey, is that little guy
your kid brother?

120
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,375
If you don't wanna
split up your family,

121
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,041
then we'll just find others.

122
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:42,583
[WEI PING] Nah, he's just
someone from our hometown, Sir.

123
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:43,875
No relation.

124
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,333
[TOUGH GUY 17A] Okay.

125
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,416
What crap!

126
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,375
Absolute crap!

127
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,750
Five burly guys all together?

128
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,708
That's just gross,
those dumbasses!

129
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:57,458
I'm gonna fight as hard as
the five of you combined.

130
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,666
You hear me, dumbasses?!

131
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:11,583

You're even smaller than me!
It's no wonder.

Have a seat.

Hey!

Do not ignore me when
I'm being nice to you!

Hey, you jerk,
I'm tellin' you to sit down!

140

You listenin'?!

Eugh! Why are you here?!

143
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:41,708
They found some guys who
looked tougher, so we're out.

144
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:44,708
Well, well.

145
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,708
Cap'n Zegui is all
by his lonesome.

146
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,875
No surprise there!

147
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:51,500
Who'd want to trust his life
to the hands of a wimp,

148
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,541
because that's what he is!

nobody teamed up with me...

Let's see who the
leftovers are...

154

Oh... two of them
are still children!

155
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:12,291
I wonder if we'll make
it back home alive...

00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,500
Why the hell not?

162
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,958
Hey, you! What's your name?

163
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,250
Bastard, you'd better--

164
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,666
[XIN gasps]

165
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,000
[PERSON] Qiang Lei.

166
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,208
[QIANG LEI]
My dislikes include talking.

167
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,583
The end.

168
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,000
[XIN] Hmph!

169
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,041
[ZEGUI] Anyway we are comrades

170
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,291
who'll entrust each
other with our lives.

171
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:53,375
Let's help each other
out and do our best.

172
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:54,833
[XIN]
Hmph!

173
00:09:55,958 --> 00:10:00,750
[XIN] Man! This is a great day
for marching huh?!

174
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,333
If only that annoying brat
wasn't here,

175
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,583
then it'd be perfect!

176
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:08,250
Why do you suppose he
isn't more nervous?

177
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,083
I'm sure as heck worried 'bout

178
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,958
being in a squad
full of newbies.

179
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,416
[WEI DAO sighs]

180
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,416
What happened?

181
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,875
[XIN gasps]

182
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,208
It's the Qin flag!

183
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:36,208
[XIN] So we're not
the only infantry here?

184
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:39,041
That's actually the
Fourth Army's main force.

185
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:42,541
We will all be absorbed
into their ranks from now on.

186
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:43,916
The Fourth Army?

187
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,166
Does that mean there
are three more forces

188
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,291
this big as well then?!

189
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,958
[ZEGUI] Five more, actually.

190
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,833
There are six forces in total.

191
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,375
[WEI DAO] Six forces?!

192
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:58,333
[XIN] That's... that's awesome!

193
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:05,625
Awesome, awesome, awesome!

194
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,750
[SOLDIERS gasp]

195
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:14,333
Forward, men! Forward march!

196
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:15,333
[FOOT SOLDIER 17G]
Who's that guy?

197
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:16,041
[FOOT SOLDIER 17H]
Quit it, brat!

198
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,333
[XIN] C'mon, men!

199
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:20,291
What kind of kid is this
Xin exactly like?

200
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,666
Just as idiotic as he seems.

201
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,541
Oh...? Huh? What is it?

202
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:30,208
Well, I just started imagining,
and then I felt a bit sick.

203
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,625
[WEI PING] Imagining? What?

204
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:35,416
I was just thinking about
what it would look like

205
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,125
if this many people started
killing one another...

206
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,875
[WEI PING] D-Don't
imagine crap like that!

207
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,250
B-But I...

208
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:53,375
[MESSENGER 17A] Fall in!
Everybody line up!

209
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,500
[XIN] Hm? What's up?

210
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,875
Battalion commander
coming through!

211
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,000
Everyone fall in!

212
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,875
Battalion Commander?

213
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,000
[XIN] Let's get out in front!

214
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:17,166
--[WEI PING] Hey, Xin, hold on!
--[XIN] Come on!

215
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,500
All right!
We're in the front row!

216
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:23,000
Be real careful not to
break formation, okay, then?

217
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,250
Huh?!

218
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:27,166
The Qin cavalry is very
strict about discipline,

219
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,208
and a lot of the
battalion commanders

220
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,333
have really fiery tempers.

221
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:35,041
Just, please, don't break
formation, whatever you do.

222
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,166
Oh, how cool!

223
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,041
Stay still, stupid!

224
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,416
Four-horse chariot.

225
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,375
That's a battalion commander.

226
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:56,375
[XIN gasps]

227
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:57,375
I gotta get a look!

228
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:58,791
Stop it!

229
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,375
Xin!

230
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:14,916
He is dead...

231
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,458
Halt now!

232
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,833
That guy's as stupid
as they come.

233
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:22,833
Heh, heh... His head'll
roll, just watch this.

234
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:28,416
[COMMANDER]
Figured you'd be here.

235
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,833
Hey there, Bi! Long time!

236
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,166
You're still the same Xin.

237
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,541
Glad to see you are doing well.

238
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,125
[SHAN HE] Who the hell
is that brat?!

239
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:43,708
He was acting way too
friendly with the commander.

240
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:47,625
He was probably the commander's
servant way back when.

241
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,375
[XIECI] The kid
talked like his equal!

242
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,125
What's that?!

243
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:53,750
What kind of kid is this Xin?

244
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,333
[WEI PING] Just as dumb
as he seems...

245
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:58,208
I'm thinking...

246
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:01,291
You seem to have bulked up
just a little.

247
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,791
I hardly recognized you,
my man!

248
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,375
Battalion Commander?
Real impressive!

249
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:09,541
So this means we get to
fight together again!

250
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,291
We don't know that just yet.

251
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,500
There are 30,000 men
in the Fourth Army,

252
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:17,541
and I command
1,000 of them right now.

253
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:20,541
Whether I'll be the general
above you will be decided

254
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:24,250
when we organize the troops
as we arrive at Wan Castle.

255
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:27,958
So you're just one of many
battalion commanders?

256
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,708
Nonetheless,
it is an important rank.

257
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:33,166
You'll need to speak
politely from now on,

258
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,583
or it will set a bad example.

259
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,875
Fine.

260
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,125
So then, Xin.

261
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,500
What does your
five-man squad look like?

262
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:44,500
A worn-out corporal.
An amateur bunch.

263
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:48,041
The others make fun of us
and call us the Weakest Five.

264
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,208
[BI gasps]

265
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,791
The "Weakest"?

266
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:55,958
Well, but a squad will be stable
if it has two skilled warriors.

267
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:58,458
And you can count
for two by yourself.

268
00:14:58,541 --> 00:14:59,625
That's right!

269
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:02,208
I'll just do five
men's work, that's all!

270
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:03,458
[BI chuckles]

271
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:06,541
Right, then I'll be waiting
in Wan Castle.

272
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,958
Yeah, Commander Bi!

273
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:14,708
[ZEGUI] So the Fourth
Army got Wan Castle.

274
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:17,625
Now we're real trouble.

275
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,000
The lord of the castle,
Hei Gang,

276
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,750
is feared as the
"Blinding Black Dragon."

277
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,250
He's a bold general

278
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:28,833
who's wiped out an army of
30,000 with only 2,000 troops.

279
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:31,708
Now he's in charge of
the toughest battlefield,

280
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:34,875
so he's burning
for battle even more.

281
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:37,958
Yeah, aren't we all going
to combat as his infantry?

282
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:39,500
Isn't that exciting?

283
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,125
For real, that's great!

284
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,291
Isn't it, Wei Dao?!

285
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,583
Gah... Well, my stomach's
starting to hurt...

286
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,291
If it's the
toughest battlefield,

287
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:51,041
that means we'll
get major glory!

288
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:53,791
Yeah! I'm all fired up!

289
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,791
[NARRATOR] However,
the maelstrom of war

290
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,958
would soon end Xin's plans

291
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,708
and give rise
to even more chaos.

292
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,583
[NARRATOR] In Wan Castle,
at the time...

293
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:21,125
What?!
Wan Castle just fell?!

294
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,291
How come?!

295
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,208
We're the ones
gearing up to attack them,

296
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:25,666
so how is it possible...

297
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,500
we've lost a castle?!

298
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,916
General Hei Gang is strong!

299
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,125
He was slain in battle.

300
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,666
[XIN gasps]

301
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,125
It wasn't just the general.

302
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,791
Everyone inside the
castle was killed.

303
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:42,083
Even the elderly and
the women and children.

304
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:43,541
[BOTH gasp]

305
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:49,291
[WEI PING] This is my first
time, so I don't know...

306
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,125
Do people always go
that far in a war?

307
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:55,583
[ZEGUI] No--It's the first time
I hear of something like this.

308
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,083
[XIN] Who attacked them?!

309
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,958
Who could've pulled
this thing off?!

310
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:03,291
General Wu Qing
of Wei, I think.

311
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,875
If he defeated
General Hei Gang,

312
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,916
he must be
extraordinarily gifted

313
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,166
even more than people say.

314
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,083
[BOTH gasp]

315
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,166
[XIN] No matter!

316
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,166
I don't care how tough he is.

317
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,458
I'll kill him!

318
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:17,875
[ZEGUI groans softly]

319
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:21,000
[WEI PING] B-But anyway,
since the castle we'd camp in

320
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:25,291
has just fallen, where are we
supposed to go then?

321
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:26,666
Yashui.

322
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,791
We'll meet up with the First
and Second Armies there,

323
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:32,000
and then we'll have to
make a frontal attack

324
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,708
on Xingyang next.

325
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:36,875
That sounds
pretty dangerous...

326
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,416
It couldn't be worse.

327
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:43,125
[XIN] Okay, then, let's go to
that "toughest battlefield"!

328
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,791
Suits me, General Scumbag!

329
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,750
[XIN] The mood's getting
weirdly tense right now.

330
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:02,750
[XIN] So this is... what it
feels like when battle's near...

331
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:05,041
[FOOT SOLDIER 17E] Hey, you!
You stepped on my foot!

332
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,250
Huh?

333
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:09,750
Well, if it it's not one
of the Weakest Five!

334
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,208
You're a nuisance!

335
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,666
Just go home before
you drag us down.

336
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,958
Wh-Why you--!

337
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:15,958
Um, pardon...

338
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:18,791
What? So you punks
wanna go, then?!

339
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,333
[XIN]
Wh-What?

340
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,000
[FOOT SOLDIER 17E whimpers]

341
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,708
[ZEGUI] N-N-N-No, you mustn't!

342
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:29,666
A feud during a march
is a court-martial offense!

343
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,833
Please. A-As a favor to me...

344
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,375
[FOOT SOLDIER 17E]
Damn!

345
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,291
--[ZEGUI sighs]
--[WEI PING sighs]

346
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:42,875
[XIN] I figured he was
no ordinary fighter, but...

347
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:44,083
Hmph.

348
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:47,916
This guy's got
a lot of secrets, huh?

349
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:55,750
General Wu Qing, I am
grateful for your support.

350
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,583
With you here amongst all of us,

351
00:18:57,666 --> 00:19:01,083
Xingyang is indestructible now!

352
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,916
We are not support.

353
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,375
[LONG TAI] Sir?

354
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:08,083
I just came here to take all
of the troops in Xingyang.

355
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,375
[LONG TAI] All troops?

356
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,083
Wh-What do you mean?

357
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:14,750
I refuse to allow
those filthy invaders

358
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:17,958
to even dare to set foot
on Wei's lands.

359
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:21,208
[LONG TAI] G-General,
do you mean...?

360
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:29,041
[RED MESSENGER 17A]
Urgent report!

361
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:32,833
Wei forces have just made
a sortie out of Xingyang.

362
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:36,250
150,000 troops,
led by Wu Qing!

363
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,666
They are coming
straight for Yashui.

364
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,791
150 thousand?!

365
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,958
That's Xingyang's
whole garrison!

366
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,291
[BATTALION COMMANDER 17C]
That Wu Qing--

367
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:47,250
First Wan Castle,
and now Yashui?!

368
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,000
[BI] What's going on?

369
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:52,541
The First and Second Armies
are stationed here in Yashui.

370
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:56,166
It's unlike Wan Castle
which didn't have an infantry.

371
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,250
Does he have
a trick up his sleeve?

372
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,833
[LORD BIAO] Don't be afraid.

373
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:02,000
[BI gasps]

374
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,916
Wu Qing isn't
after this place at all.

375
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,958
The backbone of Wei's forces
is their chariot squadron.

376
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:12,500
He wants to bring this battle to
flat land where they benefit.

377
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,750
She Gan Plain?

378
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,666
Sounds interesting...

379
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,958
Abort the attack on Xingyang!

380
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,833
We'll now go to war
on the plains!

381
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:26,083
We'll hold the key battle
on the She Gan Plain!

382
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,500
Take up your
positions quickly.

383
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,166
We leave immediately!

384
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,625
[BATTALION COMMANDER 17A]
Immediately?

385
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:32,916
[BATTALION COMMANDER 17B]
But my lord,

386
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,291
we haven't finished
organizing the regiments!

387
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:35,958
And the Fourth Army
hasn't even entered the cas--

388
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:39,625
Take care of those things after
we reach She Gan Plain!

389
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,916
And send the Fourth Army
straight to She Gan as well!

390
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,208
[BI] It's an agile response.

391
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:49,041
In a plains battle, I understand
us wanting to take positions

392
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:52,125
on the hills with a good view.

393
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,125
But it's too facile.

394
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,625
She Gan Plain is three days'

395
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:59,000
run from here, and four
days' run from Xingyang.

396
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:03,458
[BI] We'll be facing the Wei
forces three days from now.

397
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,625
But our armies aren't ready.

398
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:08,291
The plan was to make
our move in ten days

399
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,583
and storm a castle.

400
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:13,666
Is this general truly
a good leader?

401
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,833
Lord Biao...

402
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,000
Just what kind
of general is he?

403
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,375
All troops move out now!

404
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:26,125
[XIN] Why are we marching
double time all of a sudden?

405
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:27,333
[ZEGUI] I don't know.

406
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:30,041
But our destination has
changed from Yashui

407
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:32,166
to She Gan Plain now.

408
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,541
[WEI PING] What?
It has changed again?

409
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:36,541
[XIN] What the hell?!

410
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,208
This is the second time!

411
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:42,625
I imagine it's because Wei must
have made another sudden move.

412
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,000
Listen to me, all:

413
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:47,125
I want you to prepare
yourselves mentally.

414
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:48,958
We were supposed to
be the attacker,

415
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,291
but we've been forestalled.

416
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:54,333
When that happens,
lots of people die.

417
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:02,833
[WEI PING] X-Xin, you jerk!
Quit sprinting!

418
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:04,291
Think of your squad, will you?!

419
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:07,125
[WEI DAO] We've passed the
rest of the army in no time!

420
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:08,458
I'm not sprinting!

421
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:11,416
I'm just matching
your slow pace!

422
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,541
[WEI PING] C-Corporal,
we're on our fifth day!

423
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:17,666
Shouldn't we be at
She Gan Plain by now?

424
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,000
Am I right?

425
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:22,000
Yes, that's right, I believe
we're almost there.

426
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:24,500
[XIN gasps]

427
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:25,958
[XIN grunts]

428
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:30,583
[XIN] The air just changed
all of a sudden.

429
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:32,375
There's something up ahead.

430
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:37,791
[WEI PING] Hey, Xin!
What is it?!

431
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:41,916
[SOLDIER 17A]
H-Hey you!

432
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,708
Do not pass the car!

433
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:47,333
[XIN] It's getting hotter...

434
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:52,166
[XIN] Getting heavier...

435
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,250
What is this sensation?

436
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:57,291
It's not what I felt
with Mu Ta or Lan Kai.

437
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,708
But one thing's for sure...

438
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:01,708
There's something
right up ahead!

439
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:04,708
[XIN] Something serious!

440
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:17,791
[SOLDIERS yelling]

441
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:20,875
What... What the hell is this?!

442
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:55,541
[XIN] Dammit!
We can't do a thing!

443
00:24:55,625 --> 00:24:57,083
[NARRATOR]
There's nowhere to run.

444
00:24:57,166 --> 00:25:01,000
Lives are crushed at
a shocking speed.

445
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:04,125
[NARRATOR] Next Time: "The
Chariot Squadron's Menace."
