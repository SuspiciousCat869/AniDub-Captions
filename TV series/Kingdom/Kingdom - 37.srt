1
00:00:09,416 --> 00:00:12,333
In this war, they are
not targeting Wang Yi

2
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:14,125
for victory's sake.

3
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:17,416
Taking Wang Yi's head
seems to be...

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,541
the purpose of this war.

5
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:21,625
It can't be...

6
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:24,333
Don't die, Wang Yi.

7
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:26,250
[LORD CHANGWEN]
Your Highness...

8
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:28,666
I have gotten
to ride beside Wang Yi

9
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,208
on many battlefields
in the past.

10
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:34,333
He truly has
immeasurable power.

11
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:37,416
I'm sure Wang Yi,
the Strange Bird of Qin,

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,458
would not fall to this now
no matter what, sire!

13
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,916
I feel the same way as well.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,583
However, if...

15
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:46,250
[LORD CHANGWEN] "If"?

16
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:51,833
If this Li Mu were a giant

17
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:54,375
[ZHENG] who surpasses
even Wang Yi,

18
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:56,458
that would change things.

19
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:59,375
[LORD CHANGWEN] I cannot
believe that's the case.

20
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,666
I only speak hypothetically.

21
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,083
I do believe in Wang Yi's power.

22
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:10,500
[ZHENG] But Xin,
if anything should happen,

23
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:12,791
protect Wang Yi for me.

24
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:15,916
I still have
so much need of him.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,291
[ZHENG] Please, Xin.

26
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,208
Real enemies.

27
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:27,791
Xin, sir,
wh-what in the world...?

28
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:30,166
[XIN] It's a trap!

29
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:45,583
[WANG YI] It seems the enemy
moved a little faster

30
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:47,666
than I had predicted.

31
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:51,541
[NARRATOR]
By Wang Yi's reasoning,

32
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:55,875
it should have taken Li Mu's
army another half day to arrive.

33
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:59,083
And in fact, that army
had hidden themselves

34
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,208
where Wang Yi predicted.

35
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:05,000
Why, then, were they able to
arrive so incredibly early?

36
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,208
The real key lay

37
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:10,375
in the quality of the horsemen
in Li Mu's command.

38
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:13,958
[NARRATOR] Since olden
times they had fought

39
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:16,833
the Xiongnu equestrian
tribe in the mountains

40
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:18,583
at the northern border.

41
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:21,500
To them, mountains were
no obstacle.

42
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:24,500
Therefore, the Li Mu
Army were able to

43
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:27,166
ride straight for
the battleground instead of

44
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,791
circling around
any of the mountains.

45
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:32,833
In other words,
the Li Mu Army's speed

46
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:37,500
far exceeded that of
any ordinary cavalry.

47
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:41,208
For his part, Li Mu had
even planned on Wang Yi

48
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:44,583
misestimating his army's
marching speed.

49
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:48,125
This was because he had
investigated Wang Yi's history

50
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:52,250
and knew that he had never
fought Zhao's northern army.

51
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:55,333
Since Wang Yi had battled
in the central regions,

52
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,958
naturally he had never
fought the Xiongnu.

53
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,875
Since he had never
witnessed the agility

54
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:01,666
of the northern cavalries,

55
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,166
neither Zhao's
nor the Xiongnu's,

56
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:09,166
he was not able to even
properly imagine their talents.

57
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,166
Upon realizing this,
Wang Yi broke into

58
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,750
a light sweat
for the first time.

59
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:18,708
Meanwhile, unable to
process the situation,

60
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:22,250
the Wang Yi Army
could only stand aghast.

61
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,916
[ALL gasp]

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,958
Raise the flag
of the Greats right now!

63
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:46,791
[SOLDIERS yelling]

64
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:50,416
[WANG YI] So it turns out
the man who set a trap for me

65
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,791
is one of
the fake Three Greats.

66
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:55,541
Zhao's forces number 40,000.

67
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:58,916
My army has 6,000 left.

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,583
The enemy has launched quite
the large attack, it seems.

69
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:05,958
[NARRATOR] The time:
The Spring &amp; Autumn

70
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,291
and Warring States periods.

71
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:11,333
Xin, a nameless boy
who rose to the rank

72
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:14,166
of squadron commander,
is currently at the center

73
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,166
of a historic battle.

74
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,375
[NARRATOR]
A duel between Wang Yi

75
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,416
the commanding general of Qin,

76
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,083
and Pang Nuan the
commanding general of Zhao.

77
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:28,125
Their fated battle
held sway over the destiny

78
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:30,083
of the kingdom!

79
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:11,250
[PANG NUAN grunting]

80
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:14,958
I'm sure they're on our side,
but whose army is that?

81
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,583
I have never seen them
before now!

82
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:21,375
[ZHAO ZHUANG] Thank you...
thank you for making it in time!

83
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:24,625
[YUAN]
Th-This is very bad, Xin, sir!

84
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:27,208
At this rate,
our army will lose now!

85
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,833
Don't say that, Yuan!

86
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:34,041
[XIN grunts] What do we
do now, General Wang Yi?

87
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,541
You're overdoing it.

88
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:38,125
He's just one
enemy general really.

89
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,833
You did not do anything
this elaborate

90
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:43,041
even against the Xiongnu.

91
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,375
[chuckles]

92
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:47,250
"Just one enemy general,"
you say, Huh?

93
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:50,833
I suppose you're too young
to know of Wang Yi.

94
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,625
His head is worth way
more than fifty castles

95
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,500
put together you see.

96
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,125
Fifty?!

97
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,750
I believe Wei Jia
is quite right.

98
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:02,791
A true great general
represents his entire kingdom,

99
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:05,250
you see,
thus his head's a symbol

100
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,208
of his kingdom's army.

101
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,375
With the loss
of that symbol,

102
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,750
Qin's military fame will fall,

103
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:15,666
and Zhao's military will become
the biggest fear of all nations.

104
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,583
In these times,
no one will go somewhere

105
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,375
with a weak position.

106
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:23,458
The ruin of army fame
will alienate valuable talent,

107
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:27,750
and lead to the weakening
of the kingdom itself.

108
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:30,833
[LI MU] So you can see that even
"just one general's" defeat

109
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:33,625
has real incalculable influence.

110
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:38,083

in Wang Yi's case.

00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,583
This is just...

118
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:06,458
...a real one-sided slaughter.

119
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,458

Even foot soldiers like Xin

00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,708
now sensed that
they had been trapped

125
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:27,666
and faced a terrible
imminent defeat.

126
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:31,958
Wang Yi and his foresight
sensed it all the more.

Brilliantly done.
I don't know who you are,

Come, Wang Yi!

161
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,041
Protect our lord, men!

162
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,958
Get Pang Nuan away from him!

163
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,958
Protect General
Pang Nuan right now!

164
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,500
Kill Wang Yi!

165
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,250
[SOLDIERS yelling]

166
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:31,250
[weapons clanging]
[SOLDIERS yelling]

167
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,958
We have much bigger problems
than the duel now.

168
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:38,250
This war won't end until
one of them finally falls dead!

169
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,916
I know! But now...

170
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,416
[yelling]

171
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,041
[grunts, yells]

172
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:48,625
[XIN] Even if this war won't
end until one of 'em dies...

173
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:51,791
We can't possibly
let the general get killed!

174
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,416
Look out now!
There's a brat over there.

175
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,750
Start with his--uaaah!

176
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,416
[ALL yell]

177
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,041
[WANG YI] There's no greater
obstacle I could face

178
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:09,416
in such an urgent
situation like this.

179
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:14,000
I truly have no choice
but to end you right here!

180
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,333
[yells]

181
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,291
[SOLDIERS gasp]

182
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:27,166
What's wrong? Thy swordsmanship
is in disarray!

183
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,958
[WANG YI] Devil.

184
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:32,875
[SOLDIERS yell, groan]

185
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,958
[WANG YI]
So we have been engulfed.

186
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:45,916
[WEI JIA] So the strange bird
falls to Earth at last.

187
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,041
[WEI JIA chuckles]
I'm pleased.

188
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:51,458
I actually have goose bumps
due to all of this.

189
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:55,208
Hm? Well you really don't
look that happy to me.

190
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,333
The death of such a
great figure provokes

191
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:02,250
more than a single
simple emotion, understand?

192
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:05,666
Of all the generals in
the Middle Kingdom alive today,

193
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,125
no one is absolutely
hated by more people

194
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,708
than Wang Yi currently is.

195
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,791
[WEI JIA] Therefore,
you see, no one's death

196
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:15,875
is more longed for than his is.

197
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:19,750
That man once crushed enemies
on each and every battlefield,

198
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,791
effortlessly, it seemed.

199
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,958
He acquired the name
"Strange Bird of Qin"

200
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,041
because he could
appear at any time,

201
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:30,625
like a bird from the skies
to rain down his fury.

202
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:34,041
His death is the desire,
and the greatest dream, too,

203
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:38,083
of absolutely every single one
of Qin's enemies, you see!

204
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:42,166
And yet that is also proof
that all acknowledge Wang Yi

205
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,125
as a hero
whose name will go down

206
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:48,250
in the Middle Kingdom's
history until the end of time.

207
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:52,125
But finally today,
Wang Yi will fall.

208
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,333
Wang Yi is rumored
to be the strongest

209
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,916
of Qin's legendary
six great generals,

210
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,458
and perhaps the best of all!

211
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:02,708
Do you know why, Kaine?

212
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,791
It's because...

213
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:08,291
[WEI JIA] ...General Li Mu here,
is even more of a monster

214
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:11,083
than Wang Yi is in reality!

215
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,666
Huh?

216
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,875
In this world at war,
giants among men

217
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:21,916
always appear to greatly
shape their era, you see.

218
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Bai Qi, Wang Yi,
and Qin's other generals,

219
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:28,833
Lian Po and the rest
of Zhao's Three Greats.

220
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:32,666
And today a giant of
the past is about to disappear

221
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:36,333
[WEI JIA] and the curtain is
about to rise on a new era!

222
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:39,708
Thanks to the efforts
of the nameless in fact.

223
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:42,250
My heart now
cannot help but to

224
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:45,291
tremble at the idea
of watching it!

225
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,750
[WEI JIA] Now excuse me.

226
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,125
Huh? Where are you going?

227
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,625
[WEI JIA] We are currently
on the world's stage,

228
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:59,750
and Wei Jia would like to
leave what mark he can...

229
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,958
Even if in a reviled role.

230
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,666
[WEI JIA] Though imperfect,
Pang Nuan is one of

231
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,458
the Three Greats. For the
sake of the new era,

232
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:12,708
he mustn't be allowed
to lose his life here.

233
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,916
My gratitude.

234
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,291
Wang Yi!

235
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,041
[SOLDIERS groan]

236
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,458
[yells]

237
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:26,791
[WANG YI] I truly
stand on the verge of death.

238
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,833
[XIN yells]

239
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:35,041
Don't you dare give up,
men! You got it?!

[ALL yell]

241
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,041
Xin.

242
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,458
A suspicious bunch is here.

243
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,250
[WEI JIA GUARD 37A] Keep the
circle formation tight!

244
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,125
[WEI JIA GUARD 37B]
Don't leave any openings!

245
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,166
I'll achieve a great thing.

246
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,458
None of you dare
get close to me now.

247
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,041
[SOLDIERS] Yes, sir!

248
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,208
[XIN] They're heading
for General Wang Yi.

249
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,750
They must all be
zeroing in on him!

250
00:14:58,833 --> 00:14:59,958
[QIANG LEI] Most likely.

251
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:03,666
It won't happen!
Qiang Lei, horses!

252
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,666
[XIN] Fei Xin Force,
keep pushing forward!

253
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,500
[FEI XIN FORCE yells]

254
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:14,000
[ZHAO ZHUANG] At last...
At last the time has come.

255
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,958
The great general Wang Yi,

256
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,666
the living legend
will be brought down.

257
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,041
Wang Yi, who struck
terror into the hearts

258
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,708
of the Middle Kingdom!

259
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,541
[ZHAO ZHUANG laughs]

260
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,125
[ZHAO ZHUANG]
Wang Yi will die in the war

261
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:29,416
where I served as proxy
commander-in-chief!

262
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,916
[laughs]
I really have to laugh now!

263
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,666
I suppose my one regret...

264
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:41,541
is that I won't be able
to witness his death as well.

265
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,333
[ZHAO ZHUANG]
I'll be waiting for you

266
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,541
in the afterworld, Wang Yi!

267
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,416
[squelch]

[WANG YI'S SOLDIER 37A]
What?!

270
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,750
[WANG YI'S SOLDIER 37B]
Pang Nuan's strength is...

271
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,166
[WANG YI]
So he's lost consciousness,

272
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,333
and the fetters are loosening.

273
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,125
[LI MU] Warfare's
truth seeker was bound

274
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,750
in chains of vengefulness.

275
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,666
And now that they are gone,

276
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:26,500
Pang Nuan is a pure incarnation
of warfare once more, you see.

277
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:29,458

00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,250
My goodness...

284
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,625
It's not easy fighting
a formidable strategist

285
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:49,208
and warrior,
both at the same time.

286
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:50,958
[WANG YI] As for the
strategist, I've considered

287
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:54,083
the various angles
very carefully,

288
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:59,000
but it appears there is not
a single stratagem we can use.

289
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:01,500
[SOLDIERS gasp]

290
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:03,375
He's given up now!

291
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,500
The great Wang Yi has given up!

292
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:09,250
A-ha! Then we will quickly
just go take his head!

293
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:10,875
[LI MU CAVALRY 37A, 37B groan]

[WANG YI chuckles]

295
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:15,916
Oh, please I never once
said I was giving up.

296
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
If we have no strategy,
we'll use strength.

297
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,375
[ALL gasp]

298
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,750
[WANG YI] I issue this order
to every Wang Yi soldier

299
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,458
who hears these words!

300
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:27,291
The enemy outnumbers us
by almost ten times!

301
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:30,083
Therefore you are each to
kill ten of them at once!

302
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:31,833
[gasp]

303
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:34,291
[WANG YI] You aren't allowed
to fall until you slay

304
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,375
ten of the enemy!

305
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:40,125
You must fight like
true wild beasts from now on!

306
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:41,333
Listen well:

307
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:45,041
the Wang Yi Army
now comes into its own.

308
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,916
[WANG YI] We shall now
all force our way

309
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,166
out of these jaws of death!

310
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,375
I, Wang Yi,
will always stand behind

311
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,416
each and every
one of your backs!

[SOLDIERS yell]

313
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,125
Move it!

314
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,333
[XIN]
I'm almost there. Almost!

315
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:10,958
Stop that man over there!

316
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:13,916
Wei Jia's one of
the best archers ever!

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,125
[MEN groan]

318
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,708
[XIN] Like I'd ever
let you die, General!

319
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,000
[LI MU'S SOLDIERS scream]

320
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,000
[WEI JIA GUARD 37A]
There's some brat coming!

321
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,291
[XIN]
Zheng still needs you badly!

322
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,916
Kill him!
Don't let him near Wei Jia!

323
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,083
[yells]

324
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,875
[XIN] Not to mention,
you still haven't

325
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,708
kept your promise to me yet!

326
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,708
[WANG YI]
You are strong, Pang Nuan.

327
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:46,000
[WANG YI] However, with such
a haggard body like yours...

328
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,416
[WANG YI grunts]
[PANG NUAN gasps]

329
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,000
[WANG YI]
...you cannot defeat me.

330
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,416
[groans]

331
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,458
[WANG YI]
Pang Nuan, it's over!

332
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,500
[gasps]

333
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:25,541
[SOLDIERS] My lord!

334
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:28,333
[WEI JIA] Although it definitely
was Pang Nuan's sword

335
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:31,916
that took his life,
it was unmistakably me,

336
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,666
Wei Jia, whose arrow
allowed the blow to happen!

337
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,333
Even if the Middle
Kingdom condemns this,

338
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:43,458
surely you shall not
call it cowardly, Wang Yi.

339
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:47,125
[XIN] No! What have you done?!

340
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:55,750
[PANG NUAN]
Our battle hath been spoiled.

341
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:59,541
This is precisely why
war is worthless.

342
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:02,416
However, war is
truly thy theater.

343
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,958
No complaints here.

344
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,708
Thou hast now lost, Wang Yi.

345
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,875
Ha-ha! They've abandoned
their weapons!

346
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,416
It's over, men!
Now kill all the Qin's--

347
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,666
[WANG YI]
Hold it right there!

348
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,125
[ALL gasp]

349
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,333
[WANG YI] You upset me
taking it upon yourself

350
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:28,291
to decide my loss.

351
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:31,583
I'm furious with my
subordinates as well.

352
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:35,458
Why do you throw down
your weapons?

353
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:38,083
I thought the
Wang Yi Army's pride

354
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:40,208
was in never giving up
no matter what,

355
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:43,708
meaning not even in
the very face of death.

356
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:47,833
[WANG YI'S SOLDIERS]
My lord! My lord! My lord!

357
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,208
[XIN] General Wang Yi...

358
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,250
[LI MU CAVALRY 37C]
You embarrass yourself!

359
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,666
It's plain for everyone to see
that your slaughter is at hand!

360
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,166
You just don't
know when to die!

361
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,291
[grunts]

362
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,125
[LI MU CAVALRY 37C] Uh!

363
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,875
[WANG YI chuckles]

364
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:04,791
I've spent many long years
on the battlefield,

365
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:07,666
and fought many harsh battles
to the very death.

366
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:11,625
Perhaps that's why I can
tell without hesitation:

367
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:15,208
I am not presently
at death's door.

368
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,458
[ALL gasp]

369
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:23,083
[WANG YI]
You don't seem to believe me.

370
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:26,541
In that case,
I shall prove it.

371
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:30,250
First I'll
cut down Pang Nuan...

372
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,541
[ALL gasp]

373
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:42,583
[ALL sobbing]

374
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:46,000
[WANG YI grunts]

375
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:47,708
[ALL gasp]

376
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:50,750
[WANG YI grunts]

377
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,833
What dost thou play?

378
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:10,000
The word "general"

379
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:14,625
is no different from "squadron"
or "battalion" commanders.

380
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:18,375
Merely the name
for a rank and a duty.

381
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:21,541
However, very few
will ever actually

382
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:24,541
[WANG YI]
make it that far, you see.

383
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:27,583
It is a place that can
only be reached by who have

384
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:31,333
come back through death's
door and achieved feats.

385
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:34,916
In consequence, a general
has the responsibility

386
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,875
and the tremendous
honor of fighting

387
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:39,750
with the lives of
millions at his command.

388
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:42,583
[WANG YI] It is a privilege!

389
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:45,708
Therefore his
presence is weighty.

390
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:48,666
Therefore,
he shines bright enough

391
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,208
that he can always dazzle.

392
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:59,375
[WANG YI grunts]

393
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:02,916
[PANG NUAN] Impossible...
What art thou, then?!

394
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,541
Wh-Who on Earth
art thou truly?!

395
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:13,416
[WANG YI chuckles]

396
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,000
Who do you think?

397
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:19,416
I'm one of the world's
greatest generals!

398
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:55,250
[XIN] The King and Sword,
we have been entrusted with

399
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:57,416
the whole future
of the Middle Kingdom!

400
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,166
[NARRATOR]
New light is about to be born,

401
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:02,333
shine in the age
of strife yet to come!

402
00:25:02,416 --> 00:25:04,875
[NARRATOR]
Next Time: "Succession."
