In the end, wars belong
to the generals.

3
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:16,958
Wu Qing thinks of war as
logical reasoning

4
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:19,041
like on a board game.

5
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:24,666
Lord Biao's battle, on the other
hand, is a great raging bonfire.

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,583
[XIN gasps]

[WANG YI giggles]

9
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:33,750
Wu Qing can not understand
Lord Biao's way of battling.

10
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:36,875
However, Lord Biao
has not seen through

11
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:40,166
all of his tactics either,
I'm afraid to say.

12
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,833
Who is right
and who is wrong?

13
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:45,208
We can't say for certain

14
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:49,541
until one of their
heads rolls, now, can we?

[NARRATOR] Ancient China...

16
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:58,583
The time of the sages was over,
swept away by base human greed.

17
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,250
[NARRATOR] A storm
of war and strife

18
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:05,166
had been raging across
the entirety of China

19
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,333
over the unthinkable
span of five centuries.

20
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:14,875
[NARRATOR] Desire.
Pleasure. Suffering. Terror.

21
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:20,583
Unmistakably, in this world rife
with cruelty lived a dragon:

22
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:23,041
named "the era."

[roaring]

[NARRATOR] Scorched by
that dragon's flames,

25
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:34,125
more than 100 nations fell,
one after another,

26
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,958
winnowed away into
seven that now remained.

27
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:42,083
[NARRATOR]
These were Yan, Qi, Zhao,

Wei, Han, Chu,

29
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:46,916
and Qin.

[roaring]

31
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:50,791
[NARRATOR]
These seven large kingdoms,

32
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:53,583
as though each was trying
to devour the others,

33
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:56,500
lunged at their enemies'
throats again and again

34
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:59,000
with ambition-fueled swords.

35
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:02,958
This was the era of the Spring
and Autumn Warring States.

36
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:05,791
Now, from Qin, the
westernmost kingdom,

37
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,750
a great wind of history
is about to blow.

38
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:11,958
This is the tale of a
nameless boy and a young king

39
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:15,458
who ran the gauntlet
in this age of strife.

Enemy incoming on our left!

[WU QING] Hm?!

43
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,333
Five to six thousand!

44
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:02,541
[WU QING] Lord Biao,
is it? The fool.

45
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,791
Surprise attacks don't
work on Wu Qing's army.

[gasping]

47
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:10,875

[XIN gasps]

49
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,541
We're in trouble.

50
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:26,250
They organized their army
before we started the charge!

51
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,791
[WANG YI giggles]

52
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,458

[WANG YI giggles]

00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:24,208
[WANG YI] This has surprised
Wu Qing as well, it appears.

61
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:29,708
Lord Biao's talent far exceeded
his estimation of the situation.

62
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:36,000
After all, the man can put on
an even fight with me as well.

63
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,750
And the army that
he commands is just

64
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:42,791
a little bit stronger
than mine, too.

65
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:46,125
He'll wipe out one or two
of those formations.

[WEI SOLDIERS screaming]

67
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:51,000
However, Lord Biao
cannot predict

68
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,958
Wu Qing's next move, can he?

[LORD BIAO yells]

00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,541
Call Zhu Gui and Ma Gui.

71
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,125
It's time to kill!

72
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:03,833
[COMMANDER 21A] Yes, Sir!

73
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:08,416
[WANG YI] Are you getting an
inkling now of what I meant

74
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,416
when I told you that wars
belong to the generals?

75
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,916
[BI]
"Wars belong to the generals"?

76
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,166
What does that make us, then?

77
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,833
What about the people who died?!

78
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:22,041
What about Fu Hushen's death?!

79
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:24,791
That's nonsense!
We're fighting, too!

80
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:28,083
[BI] Bi Battalion,
prepare to charge!

81
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,250
We'll back up General Biao!

82
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,083
This will likely be
the final battle,

83
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,708
and... you'll fight
tooth and nail!

84
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,666
[SOLDIERS] Yes, Sir!

85
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,208
Take the field!

[XIN gasps]

87
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:48,375
[BI] War does not belong only to
those who are generals, Wang Yi!

00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,166
Bi...

89
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,416
[WANG YI] Oh dear.

90
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,541
Lieutenant Bi has jumped
to the wrong conclusion,

91
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:56,916
or so it appears.

92
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,583
[XIN growls]

93
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,833
[WANG YI] The reason Lord Biao
kept his troops fighting

94
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,666
to the point of recklessness...

95
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,375
It's because he kept the war
in a state of change

96
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:09,041
that Wu Qing has left his
advantageous position

97
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:12,166
on the hill and
come before us now.

98
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:15,416
[WANG YI]
From Lord Biao's perspective,

99
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,666
Qin deaths, which at first
seemed meaningless,

100
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,375
were actually sacrifices
for the sake of victory.

101
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:26,375
[XIN] Commander Fu Hushen
said the same thing!

102
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:29,916
The fact still remains that
Lord Biao is the one

103
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,833
who sacrificed them.

104
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:34,125
Which means the wars...

105
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,916
Depends on the generals.

106
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,625
Yes, precisely.

107
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:40,791
[WANG YI giggles]

108
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:43,125
[WANG YI]
Listen well, young Xin.

109
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:47,041
This entire situation
you see before you

110
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:51,958
was brought about by those two
for the sake of their victories.

111
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:57,125
[XIN] This big of a battle
made by just two people?

112
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:05,916
Indeed. You see, that is
just what all the generals do.

113
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,041
[SOLDIERS yelling]

114
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,250
[XIN] Generals...

115
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,875
[BOTH] Soon, we'll become the
most powerful generals

116
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,250
in the world!

117
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,166
[XIN]
The most powerful generals...

118
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,500
I've been going on
and on about 'em,

119
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:26,041
but all I knew about it
was an image of

120
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:29,375
"heroes everybody's heard of"...

121
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:32,375
But now, thanks to what
this big guy just told me,

122
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,583
I'm startin' to get the picture.

123
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,791
[XIN] General Wang Yi...

124
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,833
[XIN gasps]

125
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:44,916
[XIN] Oh, wow!
So this whole time,

126
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:49,125
[XIN] I have been talkin'
to a real general?!

127
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:56,625
[XIN] General Wang Yi,
lend me a horse, um, please!

128
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:59,541
Oh, are you going
down there as well?

129
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,791
You will not get chance

130
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:05,291
to have a conversation
with me very often.

131
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,708
You are right about that, but...

132
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:11,375
...there's no way I can't go
when there's such a big kill!

133
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,791
[WANG YI chuckles]

134
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,375
[XIN] Ze, a favor!

[WEI DAO] Huh?

00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,541
[WEI PING] Pretty much
the idiot he seems to be.

144
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,250
He says he's gonna be the
world's greatest general.

145
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:40,541
[WEI PING laughs]

146
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:44,166
[QIANG LEI] The world's
greatest general?

147
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,875
He IS an idiot.

To bring down a fierce

154
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:05,166
you don't need to go
for the head straight.

My goodness!

in the face of
Lord Biao's charge,

00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,166
[WANG YI giggles]

162
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,083
[WANG YI] It seems like Wu Qing

163
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,541
won't let us have
his head so easily.

164
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,791
He has caught on to the trick

165
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:36,916
behind Lord Biao's
success, hasn't he?

166
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,958
[BIAO SOLDIER 21A] Right flank!

167
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,208
The chariot squadron
is closing in!

168
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,833
[BIAO SOLDIER 21B] They're
coming from the left, too!

169
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:48,708
He's attacking General Biao's
men, not the general himself?

170
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:51,750
It's abnormal for the
commanding general

171
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:54,416
to lead a charge
the way he has been.

172
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,916
The enemy is sure to target
the leading rider then.

173
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,500
[LORD BIAO yells]

174
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,458
[WANG YI] After all,
if they slay that one,

175
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:04,125
the battle is over.

176
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,541
But they can't slay
him now, can they?

177
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,750
So interesting...

178
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:09,875
[SOLDIERS yell]

179
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,166
[WANG YI] To stand
before General Biao

180
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:15,458
is to stand before
all of his army, too.

181
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,083
Because the general
is at the front,

182
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:20,791
the combined bloodlust
of the entire army

183
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:23,250
bears down on the enemy at once.

184
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,083
At the sight of their frenzy,

185
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:29,208
all the enemy soldiers are
paralyzed with sheer fear.

186
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,541
His army is able to
break through the heart

187
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,458
of the enemy easily,

188
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:36,625
partially because of
Lord Biao's own strength,

189
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:40,500
but the army following him,
keeping him away from harm

190
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:44,291
plays a very large and
crucial role in all of this.

191
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:47,833
So large that it's fair to say
the pressure they project

192
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:51,625
is also the source
of their own power.

193
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:52,791
I understand.

194
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,708
And when Wu Qing realized that,

195
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,750
he split his army
left and right.

196
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,250
Yes.

197
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:02,833
He limited his targets to the
soldiers behind Lord Biao.

198
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,791
Crush them!

199
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:12,000
[grunting, yelling]

200
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,125
[TENG] They are
being whittled down.

201
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,833
[WANG YI] They have
such fighting craze

202
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:18,375
because they're
guarding their master.

203
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,500
When they themselves
are targeted,

204
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:23,708
they are left with only their
native strength, you see.

205
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:28,125
Lord Biao, at this rate,
you'll be stranded in a sea

206
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,458
filled with Wei soldiers.

207
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:35,875
Dammit, there is just no way
we can break through them, Bi!

208
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,041
We've got less than
a hundred horses!

209
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:41,875
We will die painful deaths
before we even get near enough

210
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,625
to Lord Biao!

211
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:46,375
Believe in me and
come with me, Shang Lu!

212
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,875
I noticed something when
I looked down at the enemy

213
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,750
from the top of the hill!

214
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:54,250
They're Wu Qing's main army,
but with many men!

215
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,666
I saw more than one slow unit.

216
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,375
If we go after those units...

217
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,083
We'll get in from here!

218
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,250
[LORD BIAO] Hrm?!

219
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,666
What's with these guys?
They're weak!

220
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,625
If we keep this up...

221
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,125
[BI gasps]

222
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:17,708
You think you're so clever
only hitting our weak points!

223
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,166
Come at me!

224
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,250
I'm definitely not like the
rest of them, you'll see!

225
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,708
[BI growls, gasps]

226
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,125
[XIN yells]

227
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,333
[XIN] This is awesome, Bi!

228
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:37,458
The horse I borrowed from
General Wang Yi is so fast!

229
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,541
[BI] Come with me, Xin!

230
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,833
[BI] Lord Biao's army
is being hemmed,

231
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,458
let's latch onto the left!

232
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:49,375
[XIN] Right on, Commander Bi!

233
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,666
[COMMANDER 21B] Qin's army's
drive has been halved!

234
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,875
There's less than
three thousand left!

235
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,125
The chariot squadron
has now left!

236
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,458
The battle's further
in Wei's favor!

237
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,625
[ZHU GUI] Did you
call for me, my lord?

238
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:04,166
[WU QING] Lord Biao's army
will soon be annihilated,

239
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,916
and he'll be left isolated.

240
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,708
[WU QING] Zhu Gui, Ma Gui,

241
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:12,375
take his head and close
the curtain on this war.

242
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,791
It will be our pleasure.

243
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:23,458
[XIN yells]

244
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,625
[WEI SOLDIERS scream]

245
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,083
[SHANG LU] We got through!

246
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,791
These guys are wimps!

247
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,250
They're hardly fighting back!

248
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:33,000
No, we're just targeting
the weakest ones.

249
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,208
Don't get too comfortable
or you'll be dead, Xin!

250
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,541
[SHANG LU] Look here, Bi!

251
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,625
[XIN] It's General Biao's unit!

252
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,083
[BI] All right!

253
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,583
[TENG] Say my lord,

254
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:47,458
I know we're passing by
here on other business,

255
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:50,208
but should we stay
on the sidelines?

256
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,416
Oh, we're doing enough.

257
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,041
Just standing on this
hill goes a long way

258
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:57,541
towards containing
Wei truthfully.

259
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,000
[WANG YI] Besides...

260
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,541
[WANG YI giggles]

261
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:04,041
[WANG YI] ...don't you want to
see what the emerging force

262
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,916
is really made of?

263
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,000
[DIAO] "Emerging force"?

264
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,541
[ZHENG] That's right.

265
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:14,833
Before, Qin had only the Lü
faction and the Jie faction.

266
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:19,291
Now there's a new power: The
faction headed by Lord Changwen.

267
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,791
It's a little depressing
for the King's own force

268
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,875
to be the "emerging" one,
don't you think?

269
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:29,166
[ZHENG] That's the reality.

270
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:33,583
Our size is to Lü's
as a baby is to an adult.

271
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,000
However, for me to assume power,

272
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:39,041
it's essential that Lord
Changwen's faction grows

273
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,666
mightily along with me.

274
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,500
Lord Changwen will lead
the civil servants,

275
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:46,041
and the proper man to
lead in matters of war,

276
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,500
is his lieutenant Bi.

277
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:51,458
That's one reason why Bi
needs to perform his strength

278
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,291
in this battle.

279
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:57,208
[DIAO] Ugh, I wish you'd say
Xin even if you didn't mean it.

280
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,125
Oh, well, it's his first war,

281
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,375
so he might not be expecting
that much, understandably.

282
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,583
[ZHENG] Hmph.

283
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,666
That's the spot! Let's go!

284
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,750
[QIN SOLDIERS yell]

285
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,541
Qin cavalry, incoming!

286
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:16,125
It's not the one that Lord Biao
has brought along with him!

287
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,708
Say what?!

288
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,416
[COMMANDER 21B] They appear to
be coming for our right force!

289
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,250
There's less than a hundred!

290
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,666
Okay, guys, I'm coming
to the rescue! Just wait!

291
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,208
Wait, Xin! We don't need to go!

292
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:28,375
[XIN] Um, huh?

293
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:29,708
[COMMANDER 21B gasps]

294
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,250
[COMMANDER 21B] The new
cavalry is not attacking!

295
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,458
They're still riding
by our right force!

296
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,500
[WANG YI giggles]

297
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,666
[XIN] What's going on, Bi?!

298
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,083
Why aren't we attacking?!

299
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,250
We came here
to back them up!

300
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:49,208
[BI] We'll lose if we fight
when we're this outnumbered!

301
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,416
We will help more
effectively if we stay...

302
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,291
parallel and get the
psychological effect!

303
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:55,916
"Psychological effect"?

304
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,375
[BI] They're being hemmed in!

305
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,583
When the enemy comes at you
from the left and right

306
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,125
or the front and back, 

307
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:04,041
the soldiers feel psychological
pressure, and morale drops!

308
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,916
That's why Lord Biao's
army is struggling.

309
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,166
But now our unit
and Lord Biao's

310
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,458
are hemming in
some of Wei as well.

311
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,375
[BI] We may not be
a large force,

312
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:18,291
but we must be putting at
least some pressure on Wei!

313
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:21,583
General Wang Yi said Lord Biao's
soldiers were even better

314
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,083
than his own.

315
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,041
[LORD BIAO growls]

316
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,208
[BI] If that's true,

317
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,750
this indirect support
should be enough.

318
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,541
[LORD BIAO] Go left!

319
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:31,458
[SUBORDINATE 21A] Yes!

320
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,291
Crush their left force!

[SHANG LU] General Biao's
unit is on the offense!

324
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:42,500
Great!

325
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:45,958
Wow that's Lord Biao's
men for you guys!

326
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,416
Huh?!

[ZHU GUI] Pressuring the troops?

331
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:02,000
We've been named the
"General Slayers."

332
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:05,000
Such cheap tricks
won't work on us.

333
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,625
[MA GUI] I will cut
off the horse's head.

334
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:10,458
Then I will cut off
his head myself.

335
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,708
Remember we share the glory.

00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,291
I know that.

Wait. A rider is coming.

[XIN] I figured
you'd be stronger.

350
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,750
Turns out I was right.

351
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,916
It was worth racing
to get here!

[COMMANDER 21A] What is it?

00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,250
[COMMANDER 21B] Lord Ma Gui
is in battle with a horseman

but this one's a
handful on his own!

Hurry it up, Ma Gui!
They're coming!

O-Oh, no...

Lord Biao is coming!

[COMMANDER 21B] All troops,
prepare for battle!

[COMMANDER 21A] Stay calm, men!

381
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,375
We have over twice as
many soldiers as they do!

382
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:30,958
Moreover, General Wu Qing

383
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:34,458
still has no less than a 100
strategies up his sleeve!

384
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,833
We will be the victors today!

What are your orders, General?

387
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:44,750
Personally, I see no need to go
and actively engage Lord Biao

388
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:47,291
who is riding a tide
of luck and momentum.

389
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,666
I suggest we return
to the hill and regroup,

390
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,250
then take our time in
wiping out all of Qin's armies.

[LORD BIAO] Much blood has
been shed on both sides

400
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:00,958
since the Wan Castle
massacre was ordered.

401

[LORD BIAO] Wu Qing...

402
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:07,458
So it is at last we meet.

403
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,375
Do not interfere here.

General Biao...

405
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:35,125
Single combat? That's insane.

406
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:36,958
What's going on?

407
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:41,000
Wu Qing could never match
Lord Biao one-on-one.

408
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:42,666
Is this a trap?

Heartlessly surrounded,

417
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,416
there is no escape now.

418
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,458
So simply burn that
encirclement to the ground!
