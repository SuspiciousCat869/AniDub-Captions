[SOLDIERS gasp]

00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:13,291
[MU TA] Mu Ta aims on purpose
to scrape your cheek with dart.

3
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:16,333
That's all it takes to die.

4
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:19,625
Mu Ta's poison darts
are fearsome, too.

5
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:22,958
That will be enough, Mu Ta.
You've made your point.

6
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:24,375
[MU TA]
Okay.

7
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:27,833
[WEI XING] I know your prowess,
and your... skill set.

8
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:29,208
Now go, quickly!

9
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:31,958
[MU TA] Oh, yes. Mu Ta will
find the little fellas,

10
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:36,750
kill them with poison darts,
and with axe...

11
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:39,291
...take three little heads
and bring them back.

12
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:43,083
Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, yes...

13
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:47,541
Oh, yes!

14
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:50,583
[NARRATOR]
Ancient China...

15
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:55,000
The time of the sages was over,
swept away by base human greed.

16
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:57,375
Over five centuries,
an endless storm of war,

17
00:00:57,458 --> 00:01:00,166
hatred, and strife
raged across the land.

18
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:04,375
Over 100 nations fell, winnowed
away until only seven remained.

19
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:06,791
Now, from Qin,
the westernmost kingdom,

20
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:09,291
a great wind of history
is about to blow.

21
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:11,833
This is the tale of a
nameless boy and a young King

22
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:15,000
who ran the gauntlet
in this age of strife.

23

[XIN panting]

29
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,416
[ZHENG]
Let's take a little breather.

30
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:20,500
[DIAO sighs]

31
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:23,625
[XIN panting]

32
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:28,000
[DIAO] Xin, now I can see
that you're all scraped up.

33
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,333
I am?

34
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:32,666
Yes, you clearly are.
Gimme your arm.

35
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,875
Hey, what are you doing?!

36
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,333
Oh hold still!

37
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,708
I'm binding just
the bigger wounds.

38
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,250
There is no need for that.

39
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,625
You're wrong!

40
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:46,666
What if the scrapes rot and
then your arm falls off?

41
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,625
Shut up! Don't worry about me!

42
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,041
Who do you think you are?!

43
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,458
[DIAO]
I'm He Liao Diao!

44
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:59,041
[XIN]
And that tells me...? Seriously.

45
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:02,708
Why the heck are you still
coming along to begin with?

46
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,833
Think I can go away
empty-handed?

47
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,625
There might be
something really valuable

48
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,125
like money at
the meeting place.

49
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,041
[XIN panting]

50
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,916
Are you all right, Xin?

51
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,625
Your skin color
looks really off.

52
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:16,875
Quiet!

53
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:19,083
I'm just really sick and
tired of talking to you!

54
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,666
Sorry?!

55
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,125
Don't give an attitude when
someone shows concern for you!

56
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:24,791
[ZHENG]
It's time to move on.

57
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,166
Oh yeah!

58
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,125
Now I will show you the
stamina of us mountain folk!

59
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,291
Don't fall behind, Xin.

60
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:34,208
[XIN groans]

61
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:36,958
Xin!

62
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:54,208
[MU TA sniffs]

63
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,500
[MU TA gasps]

64
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,625
Well these are still fresh...

65
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,875
Wh-What do we do?!

66
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,333
Could it have been my bandaging?
What do you think?!

67
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:12,500
No. His pulse is very strong.

68
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:16,458
I think he's exhausted the
limits of his body and spirit.

69
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:19,541
[ZHENG]
No surprise.

70
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:22,666
In one night, he lost his
friend, then avenged him,

71
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,041
and, without rest,
came this far.

72
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,875
Xin...

73
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,333
Time to be off.

74
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:33,208
Huh? But we can't leave!

75
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,625
We have to let him rest
for a little while!

76
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,333
Impossible. There is no time.

77
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,375
Say what?!

78
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:42,333
You mean to leave Xin behind?!

79
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:44,250
I told him he was just a sword,

80
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,291
and if he broke,
I'd cast him away.

81
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,958
You think your being
okay's all that matters?

82
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:52,250
Gimme a break!
So much for trusting you!

83
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,375
Huh?

84
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,375
Hey, um, Zheng?

85
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:20,958
Lord Changwen is the
only one you can rely on?

86
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,875
Precisely.

87
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:25,125
But he didn't show up
at Heibei Village,

88
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:30,000
so don't you think...
he could be dead?

89
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,541
I can only pray
that he is alive.

90
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,208
[DIAO] That "sword"
needs lots of care, huh?

91
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,166
A little too much.

92
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,625
[DIAO] Dummy!
[XIN groans]

93
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,333
Ow! What the heck was that?!

94
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:13,791
Since when does a commoner

95
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,958
make the King
carry him, you jerk?!

96
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,625
Huh? Carry? Carry who?

97
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,458
Well after you passed out,

98
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,541
the King ran all this way,
carrying you on his back.

99
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,333
A whole day and night.

100
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,666
Wh-What did you say?

101
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,000
We're going.

102
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:37,791
Get a little more sleep!
You literally just sat down!

103
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,625
[ZHENG]
We've rested enough.

104
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,916
Uh--!

105
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:50,958
[XIN]
Hey!

106
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:55,958
[XIN grunts]

107
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,791
I never asked you
to carry me, Zheng,

108
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:01,041
but thanks to you,
I'm fully recovered.

109
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,583
So now, it's my turn.

110
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:05,333
You can just give me
directions from my back.

111
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,958
I'll get you to your
destination in no time.

112
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,208
I refuse.

113
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,916
What man submits himself
to such an indignity?

114
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,000
[DIAO laughs]

115
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,500
You little... stop laughing!

116
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,166
So lame...

117
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,208
[XIN] Little jerk!
--Quickly!

118
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,708
Or do you want me
to still carry you?

119
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,000
Quiet!

120
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:31,166
Diao-- I've had enough
of your laughing!

121
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,250
Hey Zheng, how much farther

122
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,833
until we reach
the meeting point?

123
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,083
[ZHENG]
A little farther.

124
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:58,000
[TIGER growls]

125
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,708
[TIGER roars]

126
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:03,833
[TIGER roars]

127
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:42,458
It's not that I'm tired
or anything like that,

128
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,000
but just tell me.
Aren't we there yet?!

129
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,000
You said a little farther

130
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:50,916
Uh... we've been running
for about three days...

131
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:02,291
Hey, you wouldn't by chance
be lost now, would you?

132
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:03,666
What?!

133
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,333
Well I think there's no way
that without sign posts,

134
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,916
a guy raised in a palace

135
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,708
could get through all of these
mountains without getting lost!

136
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,291
That's true...

137
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:25,375
That lost jerk's ignoring me!

138
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:28,208
Wait a minute! Hold on!

139
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,291
[XIN]
You... You little...!

140
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:45,041
[DIAO] Well, it's 'cuz
you stopped so suddenly!

141
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,916
What is with that guy?

142
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,791
Um, hey, Zheng!

143
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,833
Zheng... this is it?

144
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:44,333
Yes. This is indeed
the meeting site.

145
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,750
[DIAO]
We're here!

146
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:04,916
[DIAO]
That's a splendid building.

147
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:10,083
[ZHENG] It's a summer
retreat built 400 years ago

148
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,750
by Duke Mu,
the land's sovereign.

149
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,583
There's nobody... in here.

150
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,500
[ZHENG]
We just arrived too early.

151
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:32,416
Um, whoa! There's a ton of food!

152
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,333
I could make anything
with all of that!

153
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,875
I'm itching to get to it!

154
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:41,208
[ZHENG] Lord Changwen
must have arranged this.

155
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,875
You're saying that
you can actually cook?

156
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,208
Don't tease me!

157
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,500
You'll be stunned
when you taste it!

158
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,666
Rooms should be
prepared, as well.

159
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,333
Take your rest as you like.

160
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,458
[XIN sighs]

161
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,750
[XIN]
A sword, huh?

162
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,416
[XIN]
Piao...

163
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,208
Watch and see, Xin.

164
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:23,833
I'll make something so good,
it'll blow you away!

165
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:28,750
Mm, I find, for a
400-year-old duke's

166
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:32,583
summer retreat, though,
it's oddly clean.

167
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,250
[DIAO screaming]

168
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:44,375
Water! Water! Water!

169
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,250
[DIAO]
Supper's on!

170
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:56,416
[XIN gasps]

171
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:07,250
How'd you do it?
This is really good!

172
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,708
Diao, you made all
of this yourself?

173
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,875
Really great work!

174
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,375
I guess...

175
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,250
What's the matter, guys?

176
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:19,250
You're not really eating.
Aren't you hungry?

177
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:22,666
[DIAO] Watching you spoils
our appetites, stupid!

178
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,583
And by the way, Zheng...

179
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:32,083
[DIAO] You said this was a
400-year-old duke's retreat,

180
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:37,083
but something that's 400 years
old can't be this clean, can it?

181
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,333
Unless somebody took
care of it the whole time,

182
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:42,416
there's no way that
it would be like this.

183
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,291
Duke Mu, sovereign
of four centuries ago,

184
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,375
was a great, unique ruler.

185
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:51,625
[ZHENG]
More than anyone,

186
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:54,791
Duke Mu loved all
people without bias.

187
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,541
They say he showed respect
even toward slaves

188
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:02,500
from enemy kingdoms;
even took their advice.

189
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:05,500
It happened one day,
that Duke Mu's war-horse

190
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:08,541
was killed and eaten
by the mountain folk.

191
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,041
His war-horse? That's awful!

192
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:17,166
Say, weren't those
relatives of yours, Diao?

193
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,458
So then, he killed
all the mountain folk?

194
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:25,166
No. Duke Mu gave
them good liquor,

195
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,625
whose flavor
complemented horsemeat.

196
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:31,791
What? You're kidding me!
Why would he do that?!

197
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:34,458
That was Duke Mu's nature.

198
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:37,833
In loving people, he didn't
distinguish between

199
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:40,458
Qin folk and mountain folk.

200
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,625
This occurrence though,
called down great fortune

201
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,708
onto the land of Qin.

202
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:53,583
[ZHENG] It struck deep in the
hearts of the mountain folk.

203
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,791
The mountain folk...

204
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,833
[ZHENG] The land of Qin
lies in the far west

205
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,875
of the Middle Kingdom.

206
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:02,833
Further west stretches a
world of deep mountains.

207
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,291
[ZHENG] That is the world
of the mountain folk,

208
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:10,000
who never associated
with the flatlanders.

209
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,083
The king of that mountain world

210
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:16,208
and Duke Mu joined
hands in an alliance.

211
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,458
In a world where
hundreds of thousands

212
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:22,416
were dying to contest
a single league of land,

213
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,000
Duke Mu opened up a hundred
leagues of land to the west.

214
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,500
[XIN]
A-Amazing...

215
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,833
But ultimately, in the end,

216
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:34,500
the only one to love them
without bias was Duke Mu.

217
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,916
After his death,
the alliance collapsed

218
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,125
on the Qin side, and contact
with the mountain folk ceased.

219
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,500
This place was built by Duke Mu

220
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:47,083
for inter-changes with
all the mountain folk,

221
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,625
but after his passing,
it was forgotten.

222
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:54,500
But... But then, who takes
care of the building?

223
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,208
The mountain folk.

224
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:01,166
[ZHENG]
Even now, 400 years later,

225
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,625
they haven't forgotten Duke Mu.

226
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,166
They revere this place
of the Duke's memory

227
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,750
as hallowed ground, and,
descending from the mountains

228
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,375
now and again,
they preserve it.

229
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,625
Through four long centuries...

230
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,291
[DIAO sobs]
Such a good story!

231
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:27,583
[XIN]
Wow! Amazing. I am impressed!

232
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,208
Made his mark in history,
that Duke Mu!

233
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,208
A real Mu-ver and shaker!

234
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,125
I'm gonna become the kind of man

235
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,625
who's talked about four
centuries from now, too!

236
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,000
Shut your mouth!

237
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:44,708
I was so moved, and you
totally killed the mood!

238
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,083
Well, aren't you lucky, then!

239
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,583
Huh?

240
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:54,000
By staying here, won't you
eventually meet your own folk?

241
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:57,416
That's so true.

242
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:25,250
[XIN snoring]

243
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,833
My own... folk...

244
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,875
[DIAO]
Don't be ridiculous.

245
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:47,333
For as long as I can remember,
I've grown up in the flatlands.

246
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:49,416
There's no way now
I could ever be accepted

247
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,875
as one of the mountain folk.

248
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:55,708
If I could, I wouldn't have
stayed in that village.

249
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,166
Stupid.

250
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:00,541
So what?!

251
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,250
I'll wheedle loads
of money out of Zheng,

252
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:05,416
and I'll live all by myself
and do exactly as I please!

253
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,375
[DIAO laughs]

254
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:14,125
Seriously though, Lord Changwen,
would you hurry up and get here?

255
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:17,541
My dream life depends
greatly on you.

256
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:20,958
Unless you arrive,
it'll be just us here.

257
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:25,416
Just the three of us here...

258
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:31,041
No! Am I stupid?!

259
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:34,458
It's money. Money's the
most important thing.

260
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:49,583
[DIAO yelps]

261
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,458
[XIN] What do ya
think you're doing?!

262
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,333
Hey! I found one!

263
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,750
So Captain, who is that
Mu Ta guy exactly?

264
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:22,583
He's a warrior of a land
even farther south than Chu.

265
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:26,041
When Qin's army invaded Chu,
we sought cooperation

266
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,583
from Mu Ta's force.

267
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:31,500
Apparently they liked what
they saw in Mu Ta's methods,

268
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,916
and brought him back to Qin.

269
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,333
Is he really that good?

270
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:37,833
Who knows...

271
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,958
I have heard a number of rumors

272
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:43,166
that his skills are
just extraordinary.

273
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Xin, who is this guy?

274
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:54,375
Keep quiet.

275
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:56,583
Uh-hm...

276
00:21:56,666 --> 00:22:00,541
You'd be the one who cut down
that hooded assassin, yes?

277
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:03,708
And so, what is it to you?

278
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:05,916
I won't kill you the easy way.

279
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,375
Just prepare yourself,
little fella.

280
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,916
[XIN]
Who is this guy?

281
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,875
He doesn't look tough at all.

282
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:21,958
He's small and he doesn't
even have a sword.

283
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,708
And above all,
I don't feel pressure

284
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:26,291
like with that hooded jerk.

285
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:30,708
I got a weird feeling, but
I-I'm just imagining things.

286
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:32,916
This one's a weakling.

287
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,083
You're probably angry
your friend got killed,

288
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:36,416
but give it up.

289
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,875
An old guy like you
can't beat me.

290
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:42,541
Qin people just do not
understand anything at all.

291
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:45,875
But even among them, your
stupidity truly stands out.

292
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:47,958
Say what?!

293
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:52,333
First, the Vermilion Slayer
wasn't my friend.

294
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:55,541
Also, killing one of
your kind is actually,

295
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:59,708
incredibly easy and
simple for me, Mu Ta.

296
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:04,083
[MU TA]
For example, like this...

297
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:13,125
[XIN]
What's that?!

298
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:54,250
[XIN]
Back off?

299
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:56,000
You're saying I was intimidated?

300
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:59,250
[NARRATOR] The fear of death
assails you for the first time.

301
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:03,166
If you're a common sword, Xin,
you'll only shatter and crumble.

302
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,500
Next time: Unbroken Heart
