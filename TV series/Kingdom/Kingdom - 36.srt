1
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:11,916
[LORD CHANGWEN] The great
general Liao was a woman.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,416
What's more...

3
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:21,333
[LORD CHANGWEN] ...the woman
who was to be Wang Yi's wife.

4
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:25,416
[NARRATOR] The time:
The Spring &amp; Autumn

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,166
and Warring States periods.

6
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,750
Xin, a nameless boy
who rose to the rank

7
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:32,791
of squadron commander,

8
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:36,416
is currently at the center
of a historic battle.

9
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:39,041
[NARRATOR]
A duel between Wang Yi

10
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:40,916
the commanding general of Qin,

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,708
and Pang Nuan the
commanding general of Zhao.

12
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:46,750
Their fated battle held sway

13
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:49,125
over the destiny
of the kingdom!

14
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,708
[ZHENG] Liao was to be
Wang Yi's wife, then?

15
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:36,791
No, one of
the six great generals

16
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,375
was a woman, you say?!

17
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:42,333
Yes. Now I shall
tell you everything I know.

18
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,500
[LORD CHANGWEN]
It was quite a long time ago

19
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:47,333
that I first met Liao.

20
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,416
Qin was in a
very heated conflict

21
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,875
with Zhao back then, as well.

22
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:53,958
While Qin had
emerged victorious

23
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:57,583
from the Battle of Changping,
another regional battle

24
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:00,875
could easily spark
at any time it seemed.

25
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:03,083
Such was the era.

26
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:06,083
[SOLDIER 36A] My young lord!
Lord Changwen!

27
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:07,250
Hm?

28
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:10,541
General Wang Yi's
army has just arrived!

29
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:16,250
[SOLDIER 36B] Wh-Why is that
army so oddly dressed?!

30
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:19,250
Hm. They're fools who
want to attract attention.

31
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,416
Hm?

32
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:26,958
[LORD CHANGWEN] A woman?

33
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:30,083
[LORD CHANGWEN] It was Liao,
the "woman soldier"

34
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,375
[LORD CHANGWEN] heralded as
a warrior whose beauty

35
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:35,000
belied a power
that put men to shame.

36
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,125
[LORD CHANGWEN] I was later
told she was the daughter

37
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,875
of one of Wang Yi's servants.

38
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,458
[ZHENG]
The daughter of a servant?

39
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,500
[LORD CHANGWEN] Yes.
Apparently she grew up

40
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:47,000
at Wang Yi's side
from a very young age

41
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,333
and honed her own battle skills.

42
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:52,166
I truthfully didn't
trust this, of course, but...

43
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,416
[SOLDIERS laughing]

44
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,583
[LORD CHANGWEN] Hm?
What's this commotion?

45
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,333
[SOLDIER 35A] Well, sir...

46
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,833
[LORD CHANGWEN] She killed
Zhao Lei and Guo Yao?!

47
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,291
[SOLDIER 35B] T-They were
the enemy's general

48
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,916
and his lieutenant!

49
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,125
[LORD CHANGWEN] After that,
we took the field together

50
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,250
several times.

51
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,583
Each time, I was made
acutely aware

52
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:16,541
of the power of
the girl called Liao.

53
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:18,750
[LIAO] Gramps!

54
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,583
You take their left flank!

55
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,375
Y-Young lord...

56
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,166
Don't call me Gramps.

57
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,791
Come on! To the left!

58
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,000
Yes, Sir!

59
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,833
[SOLDIERS yell]

60
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:32,541
--[LIAO] Huuuh!
--[SOLDIERS holler]

61
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:33,958
[ALL gasp]

62
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,375
[LORD CHANGWEN] She was a
veritable genius at war,

63
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:41,208
both in might and
in strategy as well.

64
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,958
And then...

65
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,500
[WANG YI] Our king
is so very fond of war

66
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:51,250
that he often visits the
front lines or so it appears.

67
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,791
He has a
long history of leaving

68
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,916
the Royal Court on campaigns.

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,750
[LORD CHANGWEN]
Encouraging to hear.

70
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,500
Yes.

71
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:01,833
However the wars we men
wage in the field out there

72
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,916
are not the only
wars occurring.

73
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,500
There's another in Court.

74
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:06,916
Huh?

75
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,250
[LORD CHANGWEN] As Wang Yi
said, the Royal Court was

76
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,833
especially turbulent
in that age.

77
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,750
There were
endless bloody battles

78
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,625
over who would
be the successor.

79
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,708
And King Zhao's
many frequent absences

80
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,250
only added fuel to the fire.

81
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:25,416
And in that setting,
a beautiful court maiden

82
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,625
who was in the king's
particular favor

83
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,958
became pregnant.

84
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:35,708
However, she was of a
lower-class warrior family.

85
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,333
[LORD CHANGWEN]
She couldn't expect support

86
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:39,875
from any of
the king's concubines.

87
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:44,708
She had no hope of being able
to protect her child.

88
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,791
And so she chose...

89
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:59,625
Sorry... I'm sorry...

90
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:02,708
It is the only choice!

91
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,583
[WOMAN sobbing]

92
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:09,708
[WOMAN] I'm so sorry.
Please, grow up healthy...

93
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,166
Liao.

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,250
[LORD CHANGWEN] Liao's mother
put her child in a place

95
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,458
that she felt she
could really trust.

96
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,458
A place far from the Court

97
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,291
and with someone
whose rank allowed him

98
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,583
to understand the ordeal.

99
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:26,333
[LORD CHANGWEN] In other words,
Wang Yi's manor.

100
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:29,916
Her father had been Wang Yi's
father's brother in arms.

101
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,291
Still, to adopt the baby
would've attracted attention,

102
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:35,916
so she was
"the daughter of a servant."

103
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,666
[ZHENG] And to think
that general Liao was

104
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,166
King Zhao's daughter...

105
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,375
[LORD CHANGWEN sighs]

106
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,583
[ZHENG] Did the king
or Liao know the truth?

107
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,500
[LORD CHANGWEN]
Of course they did not know.

108
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:47,750
However...

109
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,250
[SOLDIER 36C]
The High King has come!

110
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,416
Everyone fall in
on the double!

111
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,458
Don't just stand there!

112
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:57,000
[LORD CHANGWEN] One day,
King Zhao made a personal visit

113
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,875
to the battlefield
to show the Wang Yi Army

114
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:03,500
his thanks for leading Qin
to victory at Nan'an.

115
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:06,791
[KING ZHAO] Brilliant as ever,
Wang Yi, my prized sword!

116
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,250
I must admit, that for many
years I have been unable

117
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,291
to conquer this land of Nan'an!

118
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:14,083
You have truly done well!

119
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:17,958
I am so very grateful for
such undeserved praise, sire.

120
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:20,083
Hm? What's wrong, Liao?

121
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,500
[gasps] Uh. Mm.

122
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:23,875
Oh, it's nothing.

123
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:27,750
[KING ZHAO] So now, Wang Yi,
where is the fair one

124
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:30,000
whose name I hear
so often of late?

125
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:33,708
[KING ZHAO] Your trusted woman
soldier named Liao, I believe.

126
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:36,583
She achieved more
great things in this battle.

127
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,166
Where is she now?

128
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,291
Liao, step up.

129
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:43,333
Yes, sir!

130
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,666
Mmm.

131
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,041
[gasps]

132
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,833
[gasps]

133
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,875
[gasps]

134
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,583
[gasps]

135
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:08,041
[SOLDIERS murmur]

136
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,458
[gasps]

137
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:14,041
Liao, how old are you now?

138
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:18,166
S-Sixteen, sir.

139
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,833
I see...

140
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:25,750
I see. You've done
well for yourself.

141
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,333
[KING ZHAO] Liao...

142
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:32,625
You are my treasure,
just as Wang Yi is as well.

143
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,666
[KING ZHAO] And all the
rest of you, of course!

144
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,458
You shall be rewarded
upon your return!

145
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,458
[SOLDIERS cheering]

146
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:44,000
--[KING ZHAO] Wang Yi.
--[WANG YI] Sire.

147
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,333
[KING ZHAO]
We must speak later.

148
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,083
[WANG YI] Yes.

149
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,875
[LORD CHANGWEN]
From that day forward,

150
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:59,875
Liao always wore a mask
on the battlefield.

151
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,958
The official reason
was to disguise

152
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,208
the fact that she was
a woman before she became

153
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:07,291
famous in other kingdoms,
but it was also forbidden

154
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:10,500
[LORD CHANGWEN] for anyone
to speak of Liao's identity.

155
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,541
And almost immediately,
she officially took her place

156
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,416
among the generals.

157
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,083
[LORD CHANGWEN]
Liao, do you have a moment?

158
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,625
[LIAO] Oh Gramps! Come in.

159
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,583
Who are you calling Gramps?

160
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,125
[LORD CHANGWEN]
Are you all right?

161
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,791
Ooh.

162
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,666
Mm.

163
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:36,916
[LIAO] I'm finally coming
to terms with it, I think.

164
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm not really angry or sad.

165
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,041
I mean by rights
I should have just been

166
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,041
killed right at birth.

167
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,666
[LIAO] I'm just
grateful to be alive.

168
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:55,750
Yeah. I've been
lying to you.

169
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:58,625
General Wang Yi
told you then?

170
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:01,208
Yes.

171
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:03,750
I see.

172
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:06,291
You always draw
the short straw.

173
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,583
I see why you
do not get promoted.

174
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:09,666
[LORD CHANGWEN]
Be quiet, you.

175
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,375
[giggles]

176
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,208
You are a woman.

177
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,625
It would be a loss
to the military,

178
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:19,958
[LORD CHANGWEN] but you could
lay down your sword now.

179
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,125
That is going in
the wrong direction.

180
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:25,000
What would I have left
without my sword, huh?

181
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,208
I cannot be a noblewoman.

182
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:29,708
I am just a servant's daughter.

183
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:32,083
[LIAO] I won't quit.

184
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:36,166
But then, what will you gain
by continuing to fight?

185
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,416
I'll be the
world's greatest general!

186
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,291
Huh? Excuse me?

187
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:43,416
[laughing]

188
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,916
The reason I fight is a very
silly, childish promise

189
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,250
that I had made so many
years ago, you see.

190
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,500
[YOUNG LIAO] Lord Wang Yi!

191
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:56,666
Are you going to be one of
the world's greatest generals

192
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,458
and take lots of castles?

193
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:01,541
[WANG YI chuckles]
That's right.

194
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:05,375
Then I will become
a great general as well!

195
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:08,666
[YOUNG LIAO] And when I've
taken a hundred castles,

196
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:12,083
please, can you make me
your wife then?!

197
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,958
[WANG YI laughs]
All right.

198
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:18,416
[gasps in awe]

199
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,875
[LIAO] Ungh!

200
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:23,500
[LIAO] No telling me,
"Ugh, that's ridiculous!"

201
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:27,250
I was so incredibly
dead serious back then.

202
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:30,458
And I still am I think.

203
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:33,166
[LIAO] This is where
I truly belong, Gramps.

204
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,291
And I've got comrades here.

205
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:41,375
Plus from now on,
my father will be watching me.

206
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,750
I am doing this!

207
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,583
[LORD CHANGWEN] When Liao
launched an attack,

208
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:01,291
she didn't stop until
the enemy was annihilated.

209
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:05,208
Her relentless fighting
won her victory after victory.

210
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:11,125
[SOLDIERS yell]

211
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,250
[LORD CHANGWEN] Soon after
she became a general,

212
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,583
she was so powerful
that people said

213
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:20,125
she rivaled the
five great generals.

214
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,083
[LORD CHANGWEN]
And so Liao eventually became

215
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,416
the sixth great general.

216
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,416
[LORD CHANGWEN] Then some
time after that happened...

217
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,083
[SOLDIER 36D]
It's my lord Wang Yi!

218
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,333
General Wang Yi!

219
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,458
Lord Changwen as well!

220
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,583
[WANG YI] We're coming in.

221
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:59,666
It's been a
long time... Liao...

222
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,166
[WANG YI] Hm!

223
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,875
[chuckles]

224
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,291
Oh! My lord Wang Yi!

225
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:09,791
[LIAO] U-Um I...

226
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,791
I can do that
for myself, you know.

227
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,500
[WANG YI chuckles]

228
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,208
I used to bandage you

229
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,916
just like this
all the time, you see.

230
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,875
[LIAO]
And how long ago was that?

231
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:24,000
I am not a child anymore,
I will have you know!

232
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:27,333
We haven't seen each other
in a long time, have we now?

233
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:30,500
Unlike someone else,
those of us who have risen

234
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:33,708
quite high in rank
have little freedom anymore.

235
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:34,791
Yes.

236
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:35,916
[grunts]

237
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,583
[WANG YI] There.

238
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:41,500
S-Say now,
my dear lord...

239
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:44,666
[gasps] Never mind.

240
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:48,833
So what... brought you
all the way here then?

241
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:52,791
[WANG YI] I traveled here
from very far just to see you.

242
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:56,708
[WANG YI] No, I just jest.
I'm here for the next battle.

243
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,250
[LIAO] The next battle?

244
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:02,250
[WANG YI] It's been decreed that
the battle to conquer MNyáng

245
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:05,458
will be conducted by
our two joint armies here.

246
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:08,291
[gasps] You and I
will do it, my lord?

247
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,625
[LORD CHANGWEN] My army will be
there, too, in case you care.

248
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,125
[WANG YI]
I'll be second-in-command,

249
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,625
and you'll be
commanding general.

250
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,666
[WANG YI] Liao...

251
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,208
[inhales deeply, exhales]

252
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,666
[WANG YI] Soon you'll have
the last one, won't you?

253
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,708
The last one, he said?

254
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:32,916
What is it?
What's wrong, Liao?

255
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,166
[LIAO] I can't believe
he remembered.

256
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,000
And he even kept track...

257
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,416
You mean--

258
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,791
[YOUNG LIAO] And when
I've taken a hundred castles,

259
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:46,333
please, can you make me
your wife then?!

260
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:49,625
[WANG YI chuckles]
All right.

261
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,375
[LIAO] Yes I do.

262
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:57,166
The castle of MNyáng...
will be my hundredth.

263
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:01,041
[LORD CHANGWEN] But the night
before the raid on MNyáng,

264
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,333
he appeared suddenly.

265
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:08,583
That man, like a disaster in
human form, materialized.

266
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,625
[grunts]

267
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:28,750
[XIN] What's wrong?

268
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:31,791
General Wang Yi isn't moving!

269
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:36,125
[heart beating]

270
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:43,541
[heart beats rapidly]

271
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:48,333
[yells]

272
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:49,291
[XIN] Aah!

273
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:51,083
[YUAN] Wh-What's this?!

274
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,583
[PANG NUAN] This is it.

275
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:56,250
I came to fight
with this right now.

276
00:15:56,333 --> 00:16:00,833
The power I fell to
nine years ago...

277
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,958
[LORD CHANGWEN]
I don't know what Pang Nuan

278
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:06,000
was trying to do that night
to be honest with you.

279
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,125
Cut down the soldiers
at our campground

280
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,250
and then attacked Liao after.

281
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:13,666
It was as if he were
merely seeking strength...

282
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,166
[PANG NUAN grunts]

283
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,750
[LIAO gasps]

00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:19,708

00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,625
[SOLDIERS] General Liao!
General Liao!

286
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,791
General Liao!

[SOLDIERS] General Liao!
General Liao!

291
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:52,291
[PANG NUAN] There is only one on
Earth whom the heavens fear.

292
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:55,166
That is only me.

293
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,583
[LIAO SOLDIER 36A]
General Wang Yi!

294
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:04,083
[PANG NUAN] There was
another here as well?!

295
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,125
[SOLDIERS groaning]

296
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:16,208
[PANG NUAN] Whence came
this man's power?!

297
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,750
[yells]

298
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:21,125
[groans]

299
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,166
Fire!

300
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:43,750
[PANG NUAN groaning, gasping]

301
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:47,416
Why... Why did I lose?

302
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,791
Was it because
that woman wounded me?

303
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:55,125
[PANG NUAN]
No! It's irrelevant.

304
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:58,208
He was better than I was.

305
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:01,208
My battle strength
was no match for his!

306
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,291
Or so I fear!

307
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:07,833
Come, Wang Yi!

308
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:11,708
I came to crush thee
as thou art right now!

309
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,208
Pang Nuan, too...

310
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:19,916
And General Wang Yi is moving!

311
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:26,250
[commotion]

312
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,875
[PANG NUAN] It took my body
three years to fully heal.

313
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:38,750
Then I trained myself for
six years in the mountains.

314
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:42,833
And then, the man called
Li Mu appeared.

315
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:49,458
[PANG NUAN] I agreed to his
proposal because I was certain

316
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:53,500
that I had far surpassed
this man's ability!

317
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:57,416
[PANG NUAN] I'd reached heights
of warfare beyond any human!

318
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,500
Yet now, why?!

319
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:05,791
[PANG NUAN]
Why are his blows so heavy,

320
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,500
I cannot seem to even
repel his blade?!

321
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,625
What is this?!

322
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:16,125
From what source within him
flows this power?!

323
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:19,333
You seem quite
incredulous Pang Nuan.

324
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:22,833
Generals are a troublesome
lot I'll have you know.

325
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,083
[gasps]

326
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,583
[WANG YI] Since I was
thirteen I have been on

327
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,375
too many battlefields
for me to even count.

328
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,375
[WANG YI] I have lost
thousands of comrades

329
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:33,875
and slain millions
of enemies as well.

330
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:35,833
All their desires
snuffed out along with

331
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:39,000
the flame of life form an
incredible weighty mantle

332
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:41,291
on my shoulders.

333
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:44,875
Naturally, that includes
Liao's desires.

334
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:47,166
[WANG YI] I imagine that's
beyond the understanding

335
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,125
of a mountain recluse
like yourself.

336
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:51,708
The desires
of the dead are now

337
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,583
resting on his shoulders?

338
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:56,750
[XIN] Yeah, they are.
That's how we grow stronger,

339
00:19:56,833 --> 00:20:00,208
and a general who's been
through it all is real strong.

340
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,833
[ALL gasp]

341
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,833
[PANG NUAN] A waste of breath.

342
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:08,791
Your kind hath always held
this misapprehension.

343
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,333
To "carry on"
the will of the dead

344
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,541
is but a fantasy
of the survivors.

345
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,250
A dead man quite simply
turneth to dust.

346
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,833
[PANG NUAN]
The defeated fall to Earth,

347
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,291
the victors
draw near to heaven.

348
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:23,666
That is the world's
only true law!

349
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,375
[WANG YI] Pang Nuan...

350
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:35,583
It would clearly appear that we
are at odds to the very end.

351
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:38,333
Of course we are!

352
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:44,333
[ZHENG]
Wang Yi deeply loved Liao,

353
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,416
and Pang Nuan killed her.

354
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,833
The Zhao army
made him general

355
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:52,250
precisely because of
the weight of that history.

356
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:55,666
Just in order to lure
Wang Yi into battle...

357
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,000
Your Highness?

358
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,291
[ZHENG] I can't believe it...

359
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,125
[ZHENG] The aim of
this five-day battle

360
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:07,416
has purely been
to kill Wang Yi.

361
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,291
[LORD CHANGWEN] But slaying
the enemy's general

362
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:11,750
is just one of
the basics of war, sire.

363
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,750
[ZHENG]
No, that's not what I mean.

364
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:17,458
This war is something
more bizarre than that.

365
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:20,916
They are not targeting
Wang Yi for victory's sake.

366
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,833
Taking Wang Yi's
head seems to be...

367
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,916
[ZHENG]
the purpose of this war.

368
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,333
It can't be...

369
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:29,208
[ZHENG]
It's not easy to believe.

370
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:32,625
But, if Li Mu has
strategized all of this

371
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,250
as thoroughly as I fear...

372
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:38,500
[weapons clanging]

373
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,833
[AIDE 36A]
We've been breached!

374
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,333
Third position is down!

375
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:47,250
Who is that man, exactly?!

376
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:49,666
Uh! Unbelievable...

377
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:53,166
[ZHAO ZHUANG] I had no idea
he was such a monster!

378
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,708
[SOLDIERS groaning]

379
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,375
[ZHAO ZHUANG] You deliberately
kept him a secret,

380
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,083
didn't you, Wang Yi?!

381
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:03,041
[PANG NUAN] I am faster
and more powerful,

382
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,291
this time around as well!

383
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:08,625
His techniques cannot
even compare to mine!

384
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:11,083
Uh! General Wang Yi!

385
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:18,875
[PANG NUAN] So why then
can I not slay him?!

386
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:20,708
Deep in the afterworld,

387
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:23,916
[WANG YI] have Liao
explain to you why you lost!

388
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,125
[grunts]

389
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:28,791
Go!

390
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:34,583
Wh-What's wrong
with the general?

391
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:36,791
[XIN] Why did he stop?!

392
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:38,166
[WANG YI] Hmm.

393
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,583
Just wait.

394
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:42,833
Why has the ground
been rumbling nonstop?

395
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:46,958
[ZHENG] The trap that
you have been ensnared in

396
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:49,166
is indeed immensely great...

397
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:52,666
But do not die, Wang Yi!

398
00:22:52,750 --> 00:23:02,708
[intense music plays]

399
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:10,666
You are earlier than...
I expected.

400
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:14,375
[ZHENG] Xin, change
Wang Yi's fate! Do it!

401
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,541
[WANG YI] It's been a long time

402
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:56,708
since my blood
stirred in my veins!

403
00:24:56,791 --> 00:24:58,125
[NARRATOR] No way out!

404
00:24:58,208 --> 00:25:01,541
The strange bird who shook
the world falls to Earth!

405
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,708
Next Time: "I Stand
on the Verge of Death."
