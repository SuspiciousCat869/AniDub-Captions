1
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:11,083
[NARRATOR] Concerned
about the loss of contact

2
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:12,666
with Meng Wu's party,

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,583
Wang Yi advanced his
soldiers at a fast clip,

4
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:20,625
and ultimately captured
the enemy's headquarters.

5
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:23,333
However, it was obvious
neither Meng Wu's

6
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:25,708
nor the enemy's
forces were there.

7
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:33,541
Meanwhile, Meng Wu and the
others were in dire straits,

8
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:36,250
thanks to an enemy ambush when
they entered the mountains

9
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:38,166
to pursue Pang Nuan.

10
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,833
Wang Yi suspected
that the Zhao Army

11
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:44,416
had abandoned
its headquarters

12
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,041
to launch an effort to
slay Meng Wu's forces,

13
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:50,583
and he immediately
began pursuing them.

14
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,125
But even in this critical hour,

15
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:05,666
Wang Yi continued to feel
a certain "offness."

16
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09,291
[WANG YI] I still detect
the faint whiff of a plot.

17
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:13,791
[WANG YI] But given
Zhao's current positioning

18
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:17,583
as well as their battle tactics,
they can't possibly

19
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:21,791
launch anything
large-scale at the moment.

20
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:26,416
The fact that they make
me uneasy nonetheless

21
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,875
means the trap laid for us is
an awfully elaborate one.

22
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,083
[NARRATOR]
The time: The Spring &amp; Autumn

23
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:35,666
and Warring States periods.

24
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:39,333
Xin, a nameless boy who rose to
the rank of squadron commander,

25
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:42,000
carried out a string of exploits
in the midst of battle

26
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:44,541
that brought the
Qin army an advantage.

27
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:48,166
However, the enemy's commanding
general has appeared at last,

28
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,125
and has proven to be
beyond all imagination.

29
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:54,208
That man, said to have a
previous tie to Wang Yi,

30
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:55,833
is named Pang Nuan.

31
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:59,500
The war situation is on
the verge of great change!

32
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:41,541
[ZHENG] What is it that you
must tell me so urgently,

33
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:43,125
Yang Duanhe?

34
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:46,666
[YANG DUANHE] Zheng, it has been
about a year since we fought

35
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,291
and won alongside you

36
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,750
against the rebellion of
your brother Cheng Jiao.

37
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,583
We returned to
the mountain world

38
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,750
and spent all our
time waging war.

39
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:57,833
As a result, my influence
now extends further

40
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:00,666
than ever before,
wide enough even to border

41
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,250
the land of the equestrian
peoples of the north as well.

42
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:08,208
The northern equestrian
peoples, The Xiongnu?

43
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,583
That's right.

44
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,333
[YANG DUANHE] The Xiongnu
and the other northern nomads

45
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,500
are nothing at all
like the mountain folk

46
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:23,000
that we have fought previously.

47
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,625
They possess a great
combat potential,

48
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,791
their profound
understanding of strategy,

49
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,916
the large scale
of their armies...

50
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
These warring tribes
are on a different level

51
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,875
by every measure.

52
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,375
I'm aware of it.

53
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:38,250
That is precisely
why Qin, Zhao and Yan,

54
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,500
which fully border their
sphere of influence,

55
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:42,833
have built a long
string of fortresses

56
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:46,333
on our frontiers for defense.
We don't underestimate them.

57
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:49,458
This is why we raised
an army of 80,000

58
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:54,041
and invaded Xiongnu lands
to finally wipe them out.

59
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,875
But you are here now.

60
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:58,916
Does that mean you
routed the Xiongnu?

61
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,666
Did you, then?

62
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,458
[YANG DUANHE]
No. We weren't able to.

63
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:07,750
You weren't able to?
Then you lost in battle?

64
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,875
[YANG DUANHE]
Well, no, we did not lose.

65
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,375
We went to the land where

66
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:14,000
the Xiongnu's main force
was supposed to be,

67
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,208
but they weren't
there, apparently.

68
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:19,541
They were not, apparently?

69
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:23,291
In their place, we saw
something truly terrible.

70
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:24,958
Namely...

71
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:31,166
[YANG DUANHE] ...the corpses
of well over 100,000 Xiongnus.

72
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:35,541
Over 100,000 corpses...

73
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:39,625
Maybe then someone else must
have routed the Xiongnu people

74
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,625
before your people arrived?

75
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:45,750
But who? Another
equestrian tribe?

76
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,500
We call them by
the umbrella name

77
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,166
"equestrian peoples
of the north,"

78
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,083
but in truth there are
many different tribes

79
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,708
such as the Yuezhi,
the Donghu, and the Xiongnu,

80
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,125
all fighting for dominance.

81
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:58,041
[YANG DUANHE] That was exactly
my first guess as well.

82
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,166
But it seems that I was wrong.

83
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,458
The force that took
down 100,000 Xiongnu

84
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,875
was a Zhao army, you see.

85
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:09,541
What?!

86
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,750
[YANG DUANHE]
We found the Xiongnu corpses

87
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,958
near a fortress called Yanmen,

88
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:18,041
the strategic cornerstone of
Zhao's northern border defense.

89
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:21,458
In other words, a Zhao
army deployed in the north

90
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:27,333
invaded their lands and then
crushed them. Quite mercilessly.

91
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:30,208
Impossible!
We have carefully placed

92
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:34,125
all sorts of spies in Handan,
Zhao's very capital.

93
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,791
Zhao went to war against
an army of 100,000,

94
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,500
even one in the far north,

95
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:41,791
we would get word of it
here in Xianyang!

96
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,958
I imagine. And yet,

97
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,625
the fact is that
you did not know.

98
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:50,791
Doesn't that strike you
as frightening now, Zheng?

99
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:53,708
[YANG DUANHE] Why do
you think you didn't know?

100
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:56,833
Because, Zhao is
suppressing the information.

101
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,625
To what purpose?

102
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,958
[ZHENG] To hide that they
have a force in the north

103
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,541
powerful enough to
strike the Xiongnu.

104
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,625
But why would they hide it?

105
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:08,208
Well, because...

106
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:11,375
[ZHENG gasps]

107
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:15,208
So why bother to hide
that fact then, Zheng?

108
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:19,291
[ZHENG] In order to...
send it to join the war

109
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:23,166
between Qin and Zhao.
Unscrupulously.

110
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,666
[YANG DUANHE] Well then,
if Qin and Zhao are now

111
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:29,375
perfectly evenly matched
finally, this new army's

112
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:33,833
appearance would likely
end the war in short order.

113
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:37,125
The results go without saying.

114
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,708
[LORD CHANGWEN growls]
I can't believe this!

115
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:42,666
[YANG DUANHE] It's definitely
a pure assumption on my part

116
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,625
that the army will head
south, but if I'm right,

117
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:49,333
the one who came up with
and executed this whole plan

118
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:51,666
is a formidable tactician.

119
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,750
As is, the man who
commanded Zhao's slaughter

120
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,666
of the Xiongnu.

121
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:01,833
It was not the number
of Xiongnu killed

122
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:05,375
that shocked me that day.
It was how they were killed.

123
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:08,250
There was just no
indication of resistance.

124
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,166
It was a one-sided slaughter.

125
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,750
They weren't fallen
by military might,

126
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:16,208
but instead they were destroyed
by strategy, you see.

127
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,458
The two tacticians are the same?

128
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,541
[YANG DUANHE]
Very possibly.

129
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,041
According to the few
surviving warriors,

130
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,333
his name appears to be...

131
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,541
[YANG DUANHE]
...Li Mu.

132
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,541
[rumbling]

133
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:41,375
[LI MU]
Ah, here they are.

134
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,625
What is that sound?

135
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,666
It can't be...

136
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:56,958
[DIAO]
That's... a Zhao cavalry!

137
00:08:57,041 --> 00:09:00,041
What are they doing here?!

138
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:13,750
[WEI JIA] We have come to
escort you, General Li Mu.

139
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,000
Huh? A general?

140
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:20,125
[LI MU] Thank you, Wei Jia.
I appreciate it.

141
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,625
You tricked us, huh, Kaine?!

142
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,541
I thought you were
a good person!

143
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:38,083
But you're the enemy!

144
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,583
[DIAO grunts]

145
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:44,208
[KAINE] Quit talking like
this is a playground fight.

146
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:47,958
Because what is happening
here is an actual war.

147
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,666
Will you kill us? Can I know?

148
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,250
Rest easy. My lord Li Mu
won't slay anyone

149
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,916
that is not directly connected
with the battle now.

150
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,916
When the war is over,
you will promptly be released.

151
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,500
[KAINE] Well, He Liao Diao,
this is where we part.

152
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,500
If you really do end up
becoming a tactician,

153
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,541
we may meet again
on the battlefield.

154
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:12,583
As enemies, obviously.

155
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:17,416
[KAINE] Oh, and that food
that you gave me was good.

156
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,666
See you 'round!

157
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,416
[MENG YI]
Wait!

158
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,208
Please just answer
one question, Kaine.

159
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,333
Who exactly is Li Mu?

160
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,583
How is he involved
in this war now?

161
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:30,625
That's two questions really.

162
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:34,541
Very well. I'll just
answer the first one.

163
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:37,500
Have you ever heard of Zhao's
"Three Greats" or not?

164
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,791
Why yes of course.

165
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:42,666
Lin Xiangru,
Zhao She and Lian Po.

166
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,875
They were great heroes,
fierce in battle.

167
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,083
Even against Qin's
six great generals

168
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,083
they still held up to them.

169
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:52,666
[MENG YI] But Lin Xiangru and
Zhao She are no longer alive,

170
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,500
and Lian Po fled to Wei.

171
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:57,833
So the "Three Greats"
should no longer exist...

172
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:01,875
Why speak of the
past like this then?

173
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,916
It's true that the
former Three Greats

174
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,750
are long gone these days.

175
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,750
But what if a new generation
of the Three Greats

176
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,625
is being formed currently?

177
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:13,666
Don't say Li Mu is one?!

178
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,833
You've got it.

179
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:33,125
[NARRATOR] An area with
some very unique terrain

180
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:37,750
lay to the southeast of where
Zhao headquarters were located.

181
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,666
Steep cliffs encircled
a vast plain there

182
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:45,125
on three sides,
in the shape of a bell.

183
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:47,875
An army was currently
being surrounded there,

184
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,833
pressed against the cliffs.

185
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:55,875
The surrounding army was Zhao
Zhuang's army of 12,000 men:

186
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:59,083
The very core of Zhao's forces.

187
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:03,500
Naturally Zhao Zhuang and Pang
Nuan were at its headquarters.

188
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,166
The army being surrounded

189
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,916
belonged to
Meng Wu and Long Guo.

190
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,625
On their way here,
their forces had been split up

191
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,458
and continually attacked,

192
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:15,041
leaving them with less than
a thousand horsemen.

193
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,250
Furthermore, each
of these horsemen

194
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,416
was wounded and exhausted.

195
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,333
[LONG GUO] I can't see
any way out of this...

196
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:25,583
The cliff cuts off any
escape route behind us.

197
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:29,500
We can't break through
them at this moment.

198
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,375
Not even Meng Wu has
enough strength left,

199
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,708
let alone our men.

200
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:37,416
I'm afraid we're done for.

201
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,166
This is...

202
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:53,375
[ZHAO ZHUANG] He's come...
General Pang Nuan.

203
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:12,250
[NARRATOR] On the exact
fifth day of the war

204
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,833
between Qin and Zhao,

205
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:18,000
their commanding generals
faced each other at long last.

206
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,750
[WANG YI chuckles]

207
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,291
[WANG YI] It's taken
quite a long time for us

208
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:34,583
to finally get here,
wouldn't you say...

209
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,875
[WANG YI]
...Liao?

210
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:53,125
[WANG YI yells]

211
00:13:55,958 --> 00:14:00,916
[WANG YI yells]

212
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,041
[WANG YI] You've been anxiously
waiting for this, too,

213
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,041
haven't you, Pang Nuan?

214
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:09,333
Five days-- No, nine...

215
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,250
...years!

216
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:14,500
So, shall we finally
settle this, then?

217
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:29,375
I think it's finally time, sir.

218
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:30,708
Yeah.

219
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,166
Raise the flag
of the Greats now!

220
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:40,666
[SOLDIERS yell]

221
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:46,125
What's with them,
cheering all of a sudden?!

222
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:49,416
[PEI LANG]
That's the flag of the Greats!

223
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,208
Are they saying one of Zhao's
Three Greats is with them?

224
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,541
I see the name "Three Greats"
has its effect

225
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:06,375
even if the Greats are fake.

226
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,583
But of course.

227
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,958
That name is engraved
deeply inside the hearts

228
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,708
of all of their
people, you see...

229
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:15,083
Along with the
magnificent war record

230
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,708
of those three who
fought hard on even terms

231
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,875
with we six notorious
great generals of Qin.

232
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:24,083
Naturally morale will rise
if they unfurl a flag

233
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:27,041
of the Greats and
call up those memories.

234
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:29,291
So then, let's raise the flag

235
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:32,166
of the six great generals
of Qin right now, my lord.

236
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:36,833
[WANG YI] Oh, Teng,
there's no such thing!

237
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:39,791
How very nostalgic,
battling an army

238
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,833
that flies a flag like that.

239
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,166
And since I'm feeling nostalgic,

240
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,625
perhaps I'll do my
old routine again.

241
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,958
[XIN]
This is really bad news!

242
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:54,666
They got us just
totally overwhelmed...

243
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,416
We gotta get our spirits up
somehow as well now!

244
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,041
[yelling]

245
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,208
What's this shouting now?

246
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,958
I think it is coming
from our army!

247
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:16,000
[SOLDIERS yelling, cheering]

248
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:23,166
[SOLDIERS yelling, cheering]

249
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,958
[WANG YI chuckles]

250
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,916
[WANG YI] I haven't heard
these particular shouts

251
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,500
in a long time.

252
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:55,583
Well then, shall we finally
just get right to it, then?

253
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,000
[ZHENG] There was a particular
mystery to this war with Zhao.

254
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,833
[ZHENG] Who was it in
the post-Three Greats

255
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:14,750
of Zhao who led that large
army to invade our borders?

256
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,833
Ultimately we learned
that the name

257
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:20,041
of their commanding general
was indeed Pang Nuan.

258
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,583
And yet, just as you said,

259
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:26,291
Pang Nuan was a pure
crystallization of warfare,

260
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:30,333
not the sort to lead people
as a general does.

261
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,416
I can't imagine such a man

262
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,250
is a suitable commanding
general at all.

263
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,875
However, if we
assume this "Li Mu"

264
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,916
that Yang Duanhe told us of

265
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,958
has been secretly
mobilizing his army...

266
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,250
[LORD CHANGWEN]
That would solve the mystery.

267
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:49,125
[ZHENG]
But, if that's true...

268
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,375
[ZHENG]
Li Mu is no ordinary man.

269
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:58,750
He can successfully
bring down 100,000 Xiongnu,

270
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,791
yet he waits in secret for
the most advantageous time

271
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,833
to strike Qin.

272
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,166
[ZHENG] Why bother
to use such wiles then?

273
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:11,791
What exactly is Li Mu after?

274
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:14,916
Now then, might I
just kindly ask you

275
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,791
if you could battle us first,
dear Zhao Zhuang?

276
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,041

314
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,000
[WANG YI]
All troops charge!

315
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:18,083
[XIN]
Charge now!

316
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,208
[JIE SHEN] Sir, the infantry
is now advancing

317
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:23,333
from the Wang Yi Army's
right side.

318
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,041
[ZHAO ZHUANG]
Darn Wang Yi...

319
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,083
So he's realized
that our left flank

320
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,708
is the crux of our defense,
and decided to assault it.

321
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:32,083
He's attempting to
take away the shield

322
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,666
protecting headquarters first.

323
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,166
But if he thinks he's
driven a wedge into us

324
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,375
with that attack...

325
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,666
...he's underestimating us!

326
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,166
Left army, defensive stance!

327
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:46,458
Repel the enemy--
don't concede a single step!

328
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:47,541
[ZHAO ZHUANG'S COMMANDER 34B]
Here they come!

329
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,916
Forward infantry, close up ranks

330
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,958
and prepare for
the enemy's charge!

331
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:55,166
All archers behind them,
at the ready!

332
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,750
Arrows coming any second!

333
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,250
[ZHAO ZHUANG'S COMMANDER 34B]
Fire!

334
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:03,208
Okay, Fei Xin Force!
Circle left, right now!

335
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,916
[XIN]
Don't stop for nothing!

336
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,666
Run! Run!

337
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,375
Hm. Those foot soldiers...

338
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:15,458
They're coming for headquarters.

339
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,625
[JIE SHEN] So Wang Yi has
been after our headquarters

340
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:18,958
from the beginning.

341
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:20,791
But showing the enemy
your side makes you

342
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,333
the perfect target for archers.

343
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:25,166
There are more arrows?

344
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,333
What are the left army's
archers doing right now?!

345
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:36,000
[ZHAO ZHUANG] Do you
take me for a fool, Wang Yi?

346
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:39,333
If a sudden rush on
headquarters actually worked,

347
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:40,500
everyone would do it.

348
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,541
It's because that
seldom succeeds

349
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,708
that armies attack from the
sides. Perhaps you believe

350
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:48,291
that you have taken me
off-guard with this right now,

351
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:52,458
but a surprise attack
on foot will not touch me!

352
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:55,333
The left army is the
crux of our defense.

353
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:58,625
But lying in wait is
not the only way to defend.

354
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:00,833
Zhao infantry charge!

355
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:04,666
Eat a hole through the Wang Yi
infantry's flank immediately!

356
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:13,791
Great, we've divided them
successfully it seems!

357
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:17,833
[YUAN]
Sir!

358
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:20,833
The enemy has now
made its decisive move.

359
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:22,333
Yeah.

360
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:26,125
It's all going exactly according
to General Wang Yi's plan!

361
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:27,333
[XIN]
"Big job"?

362
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:29,125
[WANG YI]
As a feint.

363
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:34,416
Or in this case, perhaps "decoy"
would be the clearer term.

364
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,666
The most efficient way

365
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,083
to break down an
enemy formation,

366
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:41,583
is to prompt the enemy
itself to make a move.

367
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:43,833
You're telling us to be decoys

368
00:22:43,916 --> 00:22:46,291
and draw the enemy
out afterwards?

369
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:48,958
I predict many lives
will be lost in this,

370
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:51,375
but I do believe it's
the only way Zhao

371
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:53,541
will definitely come to us.

372
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:55,208
[XIN]
Many lives...

373
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:58,458
We are way past being
scared of losing lives,

374
00:22:58,541 --> 00:23:01,000
but if all us foot soldiers
are just decoys,

375
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:04,875
who the heck will actually
attack their headquarters then?

376
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:06,708
[WANG YI chuckles]

377
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:09,166
[WANG YI]
Who do you think?

378
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:20,333
[WANG YI]
Me, of course!

379
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:55,000
[PANG NUAN]
Wang Yi, I shall kill thee!

380
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:57,791
[WANG YI] It is I who shall
kill you, Pang Nuan!

381
00:24:57,875 --> 00:24:59,666
[NARRATOR]
Time for the violent clash.

382
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,250
Unrelenting murderous
intent fills the air!

383
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:05,625
Next Time: "Commanding
Generals Face to Face."
