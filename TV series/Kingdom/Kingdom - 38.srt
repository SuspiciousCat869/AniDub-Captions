of a historic battle.

00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:33,375
A duel between Wang Yi,
the commanding general of Qin,

and Pang Nuan, the
commanding general of Zhao.

Well, sir,
he was still breathing

when I last saw him,

29
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:40,708
but General Pang Nuan's poleax
had run through his chest,

Whatever state he is in,

it doesn't matter,
you must return him

This is why I
just loathe war.

It's completely apparent
that Wang Yi is dying,

and yet they're
fighting so hard...

61
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,750
[LI MU] Yes, because they
are fully aware of the fact

62
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:47,250
that allowing his body
to fall into Zhao's hands;

63
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,583
that would be
the ultimate shame.

64

In their shoes we would
fight like demons, as well,

without a single thought
for our own mortality.

and close your eyes
and breathe deeply.

Uh, hey, it isn't really
the time now...

I said, and deep breaths.

[XIN] Ow, okay, fine!

84
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:30,375
[WANG YI] Huang is truly
a general's horse.

85
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,875
At this moment,
here on this battlefield,

00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:36,875
you are riding a
real general's horse.

If you understand
what I'm saying now,

open your eyes slowly and
take a good look around you.

the enemy's faces, and...

[WANG YI]
...your allies' faces.

91

[WANG YI] At heaven and earth.

92
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:17,458
[WANG YI]
This is what a general sees.

93
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:20,708
Do you understand?

94
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,291
[WANG YI chuckles]

95
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,166
What do you think?

96
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,583
[XIN] Not sure what to say...

97
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:39,083
[WANG YI]
You don't quite understand?

98
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:42,500
[XIN] Actually...
I kinda feel like

99
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:45,541
I've started
to get something...

100
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:49,416
For just a second, energy
zinged through me wholly.

101
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,666
[WANG YI] A general's eyes can
see many things, young Xin.

102
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,375
For example, look...

103
00:08:56,458 --> 00:09:00,708
[WANG YI] Our non-existent
way out is right there.

Go to our lord's side, sir!

It seems another golden age
of anarchy is about to dawn.

119
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:14,791
You don't want to
pursue Wang Yi, my lord?

120
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:20,083
Our goal was
Wang Yi's death,

121
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,458
and we have achieved it.

122

Any further bloodshed
is utterly meaningless now.

meaningless deaths.

to follow me in death.

as always, but in truth,

132
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:01,708
your power is no less
than mine whatsoever.

I entrust this army's
entire future to you only.

134
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,333
Yes.

00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:19,416
Forgive me.
This is all my fault.

137
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:24,750
Is there something you
want to say before the end?

138
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,458
Meng Wu...

139
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:29,333
The problem you
must solve is clear.

140
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,541
There is surely
no need to go into it.

141
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,666
[WANG YI] You are
unquestionably among those

142
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,333
who ought to lead
the Qin Army now.

143
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:39,458
I expect you to
know what that means,

144
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:43,583
and grow further as a warrior.

145
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:47,291
After all, the Zhao general
who just appeared is

146
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:50,916
[WANG YI] more formidable
than any enemy before him.

147
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,625
He outdid us
quite brilliantly today.

148

Truthfully, now,
what a world this is.

151
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,458
In every era those lauded
as the strongest warriors are

152
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:16,833
[WANG YI] brought low by the
appearance of someone stronger.

153
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:19,541
The Kingdom's wars
will revolve around

154
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:22,291
that man for the next while.

155
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:23,791
However...

156
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:27,208
He will be slain in
turn by the next warrior

157
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:29,416
to come to the fore,

158
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,375
and pass on
control of the era.

159
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:36,791
So goes the eternal battle
we men stake our lives on.

00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:40,333
[WANG YI chuckles]

161
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:49,291
Dear me... This is why
war is so interesting.

162
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:52,583
[WANG YI inhales, exhales]

163
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,416
[WANG YI] Young Xin.

164
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,458
I believe I promised
to train you, correct?

165
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:07,000
As you see, that is
no longer possible for me.

166
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:11,208
[WANG YI] Still, expecting a
great general like myself

167
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:14,916
to personally train you
was overreaching.

168
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,791
[laughs]

169
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:19,791
You young fool, learn
by putting in your time

170
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:23,583
out on the battlefields,
understand?

171
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:26,500
[WANG YI] Go through hell
along with your men.

172
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:30,625
You have the aptitude, Xin.

173
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:42,625
Um, I... Uh!

174
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:58,041
[XIN gasps]

175
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:14,541
[WANG YI] I lived for
the battle. I built an era.

176
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:18,166
The chance to die
for battle is a gift.

177
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,958
I've met promising
seedlings of the new era,

178
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:25,000
and can die with a light heart.

179
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:30,083
At least I can join the
friends who went before me.

180
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:32,708
[chuckles]

181
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:37,541
[WANG YI]
Liao is smiling, too.

182
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:51,166
[yelling, sobbing]

183
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,666
[NARRATOR] In the third year of
the future Shi Huangdi's reign,

184
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,166
Wang Yi dies.

185
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:04,958
[QIN SOLDIERS]
Zhao is retreating!

186
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:09,583
[SOLDIERS yelling]

187
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:12,750
[NARRATOR] Because the Zhao
invaders finally withdrew,

188
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:16,583
on the surface, it almost
looked like a Qin victory.

189
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:18,291
From Qin's perspective,

190
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:22,416
they had achieved their goal
of blocking the invasion.

191
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:27,916
[NARRATOR] However, the group
who witnessed Wang Yi's death

192
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,958
was so overcome by sorrow
that their sobs were unending.

193
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:36,125
That is though,
with the exceptions of Teng,

194
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:39,916
Meng Wu, and one other person.

195
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,291
[NARRATOR]
News of Wang Yi's death

196
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:09,541
had reached the
Royal Court as well.

197
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:46,083
Wang Yi,
right before he left,

198
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:49,291
[ZHENG] told me King Zhao's
dying words.

199
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,041
[gasps]

200
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:53,208
[ZHENG]
What a king looks like...

201
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:57,000
They taught me what a king of
the Middle Kingdom looks like.

202
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:00,833
[bird caws]

203
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,625
[WANG YI] Lastly...

204
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:09,166
"Mercy has no place in wars.

205
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,666
The people of your conquered
lands are not just slaves.

206
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:17,333
So persecute them not
as people of your own kingdom.

207
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:21,500
[WANG YI] Give them an equal
measure of your love."

208
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:26,625
These were the dying words
King Zhao entrusted to me.

209
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:31,291
[ZHENG]
I'm grateful, Wang Yi.

210
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,625
My father didn't
tell me any of this.

211
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:37,000
[WANG YI] Naturally not,
since I never told him.

212
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,791
[ZHENG] What?

213
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,541
[WANG YI] These words
were left only for the king

214
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:44,416
qualified to
carry out his wishes.

215
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:49,083
And King Zhao left that
judgment to my discretion.

216
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:52,208
He said to tell them
only to a king I considered

217
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:54,958
worth serving completely.

218
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:05,500
Let's quest for the Middle
Kingdom together, my King.

219
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:15,958
[grunts]
Oh, that big fool!

220
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,541
[ZHENG] Wang Yi...

221
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,708
Mm.

222
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:50,000
Hi, Diao, I'm home now!

223
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,916
Huh?

224
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:54,708
Huh?!

225
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:57,333
[DIAO] Xin!

226
00:19:57,416 --> 00:20:01,875
Hey, Xin...
I'm so glad you're safe!

227
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:04,208
[XIN] Ow, ow!
[DIAO giggles]

228
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:05,958
That hurt, you dummy!

229
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,208
[DIAO]
Sorry, I got excited...

230
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:13,750
But I'm really glad
that you are safe!

231
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,250
Kept you waitin'.

232
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:16,875
Were you bored here
all by yourself?

233
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,958
[DIAO] Huh?
What are you talking about?

234
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,958
I was in the war, you know!

235
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,416
Huh?!

236
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,750
Did you forget?!

237
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,583
I told you I was
going to battle

238
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,708
to find the place
where I belong!

239
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:30,791
Uh... Oh! I guess you did...

240
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,625
[DIAO grunts]

241
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,041
[XIN] For real?!

242
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:37,750
I can't believe
you watched from there!

243
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,000
Oh yeah.

244
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,291
When they tied us,
I was pretty worried,

245
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:44,125
but they let us go
when the war ended.

246
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,791
Maybe I got really lucky.

247
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:49,000
Oh, I see...

248
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,208
[DIAO] It's not like
becoming a tactician

249
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,000
was just a whim before,

250
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:57,833
but this war
taught me how scary it is.

251
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,375
[XIN] Gonna give up?

252
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:04,250
What?! Like hell I am!
It's the opposite!

253
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:05,416
Wow...

254
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,166
I'm gonna be a tactician!

255
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,750
I got to stand in
the same place as you then.

256
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:12,500
No way am I
just gonna give up!

257
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:16,666
I gotta say, you've got
a new look in your eyes.

258
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,041
R-Really?

259
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,791
[XIN] You found it, right?

260
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,666
I did! I'm doing this!

261
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,416
Right!

262
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,541
Fei Xin Force, right!

263
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,833
We're cutting through
as a unit!

264
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:40,583
[ALL yell]

265
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,666
Xin, sir, a separate
enemy unit has appeared

266
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,958
on the right flank just now!

267
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:46,250
Not good!

268
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,500
[QIANG LEI] Xin!
We'll draw them to us.

269
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:49,541
You can go though!

270
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:50,291
Thank you!

271
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,125
Follow me, guys!

272
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:59,625
[XIN] You watching, Piao?

273
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:02,666
I command
three hundred men now.

274
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,250
But I'm not there yet.

275
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:06,250
The blade I got
from General Wang Yi

276
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:09,916
is still too heavy
for me right now.

277
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,541
[ZHENG] Hold onto this?

278
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:15,125
Yeah. I can't exactly leave
it at my place, you know.

279
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,083
[XIN] So you hang on to it
until I'm good enough

280
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:19,625
to use it properly.

281
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:27,416
Xin. I'll tell you about
Wang Yi, the great general.

282
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,875
Uh!

283
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:35,541
[XIN] Huh. So the general
said that to you...?

284
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:40,500
[ZHENG] Yes. Though that
dream is impossible now...

285
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:41,666
[XIN] Nope.

286
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,250
[ZHENG] Huh.

287
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:46,625
The General entrusted
the Middle Kingdom to you,

288
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:49,166
and also that weapon to me.

289
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,083
Do you know
what that means?

290
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:55,458
Huh? King and... Sword...?

291
00:23:02,791 --> 00:23:06,583
Yes. We are the King
and the Sword now,

292
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:08,875
[XIN] entrusted with
the future of Qin,

293
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:11,791
but really of the
whole Middle Kingdom!

294
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:15,541
Zheng, let's quest
for the Middle Kingdom!

295
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:17,916
Hm!

296
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,333
[ZHENG] Yes.

297
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:28,791
[XIN]
I won't stand still now.

298
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:31,625
Till I'm one of the world's
greatest generals...

299
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:33,583
I'll keep going, and going,

300
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:36,666
and going till I get there!
