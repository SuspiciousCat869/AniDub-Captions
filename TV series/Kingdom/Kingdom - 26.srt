1
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:11,250
[LORD CHANGWEN]
Why did you respond

2
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:14,416
to Lord Changping's summons?

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,166
You've strenuously refused to
lead Qin's armies in the past.

4
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,541
What brought you here?

5
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:21,958
[WANG YI]
This surprised you?

6
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:23,333
[LORD CHANGWEN]
Of course it did!

7
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:25,875
What made you want
to fight, Wang Yi?

8
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:28,291
[WANG YI]
You remember MNyáng?

9
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:34,208
[LORD CHANGWEN]
I see... That's right.

10
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:41,875
MNyáng is the castle you, I
and Liao once seized from Zhao,

11
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:45,125
and it is also where Liao fell.

12
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:47,000
That was a total nightmare.

13
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:51,708
I'd never believed Liao...
could be beaten.

14
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,958
[LORD CHANGWEN] Pang Nuan...

15
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:58,541
Who in the world
was that man?

16
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:04,958
[LORD CHANGWEN] No, let's not
talk about a dead man.

17
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:06,250
Is that it, you reckon?

18
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:07,958
You can't let another
kingdom have the land

19
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:09,625
where Liao's body lies?

20
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:12,791
[WANG YI]
Yes, something like that.

21
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:16,041
Lord Changwen,
I plan to bid farewell

22
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:18,958
to my identity as one
of King Zhao's...

23
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:21,750
six great generals.

24
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:23,333
Huh?!

25
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,041
[WANG YI] This battle
shall be at its conclusion.

26
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:28,583
"Conclusion"?

27
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:32,416
Then you have finally decided
to move on with the rest of us?

28
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:37,083
I have high hopes that
I will be able to as well.

29
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:39,333
[WANG YI chuckles]

30
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,208
[NARRATOR] On March
of the third year,

31
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:17,125
future Shi Huangdi's reign,

32
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:20,041
Commanding General
Wang Yi went to war.

33
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:23,208
Meanwhile, the infantrymen
heading for MNyáng...

34
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,333
[BATTALION COMMANDER 26A] We're
about to form five-man squads!

35
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:27,666
All corporals gather!

36
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,541
[WEI PING] Crap, they've
started making squads!

37
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:31,833
[WEI DAO]
But Xin's not here yet!

38
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:34,458
[WEI PING]
That dumbass brat!

39
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:43,791
Whoa!
So is everybody here?

40
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,458
[NARRATOR] The time:
The Spring &amp; Autumn

41
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:51,166
and Warring States periods.
The place: Qin.

42
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,833
Xin, a nameless boy,
met Zheng, a young King,

43
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,833
distinguished himself in battle,

44
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:59,541
and rose to the rank of
squadron commander.

45
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:00,791
In the midst of this,

46
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:03,000
the neighboring kingdom
of Zhao invaded,

47
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:06,250
and Qin faced
unprecedented crisis.

48
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:09,791
What manner of battle will Wang
Yi wage as commanding general?

49
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,958
And what growth
will Xin accomplish?

50
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,875
[DIAO] Are you sure
it's okay for us

51
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,416
to go visit the battlefield?

52
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,666
It is fine. I got
permission from my teacher.

53
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,291
We have the high commander's
seal of approval!

54
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,375
[DIAO gasps]

55
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,708
The Qin high
commander's?!

56
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:05,750
D-Don't tell me that
your teacher is...?!

57
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,416
Yep!

58
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,583
My teacher Lord Changping, is
one of LüBuwei's Four Pillars.

59
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,208
[DIAO screams]

60
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:15,250
[DIAO] Th-Then he's
with Zheng's enemies...

61
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:18,541
Oh, don't worry.
I don't really care about

62
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:21,458
what goes on between
the King and the Minister.

63
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:24,458
I just want to see the
battlefield and breathe its air,

64
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,500
that is all.

65
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,708
[DIAO]
Hey, Meng Yi.

66
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:34,625
[DIAO] We will win this war,
right?

67
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:38,041
There is no telling of
the war until it starts.

68
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:41,625
But I... hope we do.

69
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,250
[DIAO] Xin...

70
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:55,750
I'll tell you this right now:
This is no ordinary squadron!

71
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,708
It's a special one!

72
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,458
Sp-Special, he said?!

73
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:03,166
[XIN] That's right!
General Wang Yi himself told me

74
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,166
we are special forces
under his direct authority

75
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,875
and not under any larger unit!

76
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:10,791
[SOLDIERS gasp]

77
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:15,000
Now I don't know any more than
you do about what that means,

78
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,333
or what we'll all be doing for
him or what his plan is exactly!

79
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,500
But I can say one thing:

80
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,833
If the general singled us
out from the others,

81
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:26,666
it's 'cause he'll give us a more
important fight than the others!

82
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,583
He might send us charging into

83
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:31,000
some really messed-up
fights, you see!

84
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,833
[WEI PING gasps, whimpers]

85
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:36,250
[XIN]
But that means... Heh!

86
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:40,541
...you can bet the glory
we score will be really huge!

87
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,166
[SOLDIERS gasp]

88
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,958
Most of the men in this squad

89
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,833
are tough veterans who have
survived the She Gan Plain!

90
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:51,625
If we join forces, we can take
on any enemy that comes our way!

91
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,291
So listen up!

92
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:57,625
Those foolish Zhao warriors
wanna invade us, don't they?!

93
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,916
Well, we are all
gonna crush them!

94
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:07,791
And we will score ourselves
some glory bigger than Wei's!

95
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:13,625
[SOLDIERS yell]

96
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,125
[YUAN]
Xin is very good.

97
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:18,541
He won the whole unit's hearts
with his first pep talk.

98
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:21,166
Wow... is that really
the same old Xin?!

99
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,916
What the heck
happened to him?

100
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,416
Xin, you are...

101
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,541
Something has happened to that
brat since we last saw him.

102
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,208
Yes.

103
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,916
Next thing: I got permission

104
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,875
to have two second-in-commands
in our squad here!

105
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:37,458
The first one is Yuan there!

106
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,166
Good day, all!

107
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,958
[SOLDIERS] Sir!

108
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:43,458
Which one is the other one?

109
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,208
[XIN] Well, not here yet
it looks like.

110
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:50,666
[WEI PING] Huh?!

111
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:54,791
[XIN] But don't you worry!

112
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:59,625
We are very strong
even on our own!

113
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,125
[NARRATOR]
For Wang Yi's army,

114
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:04,666
the route from Xianyang to
MNyáng was a fifteen-day ride.

115
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,333
Meanwhile, Xin and
the marching infantry

116
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:11,083
were now nine days
away from MNyáng.

117
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:20,416
[snoring]

118
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,916
[WEI DAO] O-Ow...

119
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,250
[WEI DAO] What are
you grinning at,

120
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:36,041
all alone in the middle
of the night?

121
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,375
I-I'm not grinning.

122
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:39,791
[WEI DAO laughs]

123
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,541
Don't bother playing dumb.

124
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:45,791
You must be happy you've made
the squadron commander.

125
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,875
Of course I am.

126
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:50,875
You're the leader of
a hundred men after all.

127
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,125
Up until a year ago,
you were just Li Dian's servant

128
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,958
and the village
called you an idiot.

129
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,125
Now you command men
from that town.

130
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,958
That's really something,
you know.

131
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,083
The "idiot" part was
uncalled-for!

132
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:06,333
And Wei Ping was the
village idiot! Not me!

133
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,500
[WEI DAO laughs]

134
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:11,166
But we are happy,
too, you know.

135
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:13,708
[WEI DAO sighs] 

136
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,291
How could we not be?

137
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:18,041
We're just mere hicks from
the middle of nowhere.

138
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,125
But one of us made
squadron commander!

139
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,291
My brother is even
bragging to people

140
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,666
in the next town about it!

141
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,291
"My sidekick made squadron
commander," he says.

142
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,416
[XIN laughs]

143
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,375
"Sidekick" my butt,
that dingbat.

144
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,750
You'll get to take the
first step as a leader.

145
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,666
Just don't get too fired up
and go rushing over our heads.

146
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,958
[XIN]
Ah, sure, no problem.

147
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,958
[NARRATOR] As they grew closer
to MNyáng, however,

148
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:46,083
word of the Zhao army began to
spread among the foot soldiers.

149
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,125
[SOLDIER 26A] Have you
heard about the Zhao?

150
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,708
[SOLDIER 26B] Yeah, they rounded
up everybody in the castle

151
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,750
they took and killed them all.

152
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,791
[SOLDIER 26C] I heard they
killed the old folks, women,

153
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:02,500
and even the babies.
Not one left alive!

154
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:03,791
[SOLDIERS gasp]

155
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:06,625
[SOLDIER 26D] The Zhao army
will go that far?

156
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,791
[SOLDIER 26A] Hey, so are
we headed for a death match

157
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,916
with them now?

158
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,750
[YUAN gasps]

159
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:20,791
This is bad.

160
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:24,333
Sir, their morale is dropping.
We can't win a battle like this.

161
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,750
Ah, dammit, what are
they scared about?

162
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,791
Will you listen up,
everybody?!

163
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,333
The Zhao are just
around the corner!

164
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:40,625
We are all gonna put them
to rout, and set the MNyáng free

165
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:43,833
from the siege so the castle's
waiting for our help now!

166
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,750
You all got that?!

167
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:48,666
[SOLDIERS groan, sigh]

168
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,625
These guys...

169
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,791
[low rumbling]

170
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,791
What is that sound?

171
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,083
H-Hey! Hey! Look behind us!

172
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:01,958
[SOLDIER 26F]
What is it?

173
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,416
[SOLDIER 26E] What?

174
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,000
[WEI PING gasps]

175
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:10,166
[WANG YI] All troops...

176
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,750
[WANG YI] ...forward!

177
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:25,083
[SOLDIERS roar]

178
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,500
[XIN] You did this
with one sentence?

179
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:41,000
Only you, General Wang Yi!

180
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,125
[NARRATOR]
Qin's soldiers' spirits rose

181
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,000
when Wang Yi took the field.

182
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:53,875
But that night, disquieting
news reached the capital.

183
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,000
[MINISTER 26A]
I have a report!

184
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:08,041
We've finally discovered who's
commanding Zhao's forces.

185
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,041
[LÜ BUWEI] Hm?

186
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,041
Who is it? Speak now.

187
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,166
[MINISTER 26A]
Yes, his name is Pang Nuan.

188
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,875
[LI SI]
Pang Nuan?

189
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,541
[LORD CHANGPING] I've never
heard of him. Who is he?

190
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:21,583
[MINISTERS murmur]

191
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,041
[gasping]

192
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,833
[LORD CHANGWEN whimpers]

193
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:28,125
What is it, Lord Changwen?

194
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,375
[LORD CHANGWEN]
P-Pang Nuan?!

195
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,958
Impossible... That can't be!

196
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,708
But he died!

197
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:38,500
He was killed...
nine years ago by Wang Yi...

198
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,625
Wang Yi...

199
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:56,500
[XIN grunting]

200
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,208
Huh...?

201
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,708
[XIN]
Wrapped up your business?

202
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:31,541
[QIANG LEI] No.
The enemy left Wei for Zhao.

203
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,833
[XIN] So I guess you'll
join the fight again

204
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:36,458
to get to Zhao, huh?

205
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,833
[QIANG LEI]
I suppose so.

206
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:43,666
[XIN] Okay! Now my squadron's
truly complete at last.

207
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:48,208
Looking forward to working
with you, Qiang Lei!

208
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:49,666
[QIANG LEI]
Lu Sui...

209
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,250
[QIANG LEI]
Lu Sui is on edge.

210
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,291
[QIANG LEI] 
This will be a harsh battle.

211
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,583
Heh! That suits me fine.

212
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,750
Anyway, now that you've drawn
and shown me all that moves,

213
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:07,083
the "pum pa-rum" thing you do,
I really wanna learn it!

214
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,500
[QIANG LEI sighs]

215
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:11,125
[QIANG LEI] You are still
an idiot aren't you, Xin?

216
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,083
What?!

217
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,208
[QIANG LEI] The Chi You turned
the power of its priestesses

218
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:28,125
to soothe the savage gods
into a battle technique.

219
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,291
In a state of rapture, we dance.

220
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:33,083
We slash through
the enemies around us.

221
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:37,041
It's a technique of exorcising
gods via our bodies.

222
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,916
It's not something
anyone can imitate.

223
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,291
Uh, g-gods, huh?

224
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,750
You know, I don't really get it,
but it's kind of unfair

225
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:49,583
if only your people have
gods on your side...

226
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,416
The Chi You aren't
the only ones.

227
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,083
And there are some even
more fearsome than that...

228
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,583
Those who do not
exorcise savage gods--

229
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,708
Those who carry
gods within them.

230
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:02,375
Carry gods... within them?

231
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:05,458
[QIANG LEI] We simply
call them "gods of war."

232
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:08,041
"Gods of war"...

233
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:11,708
Pang Nuan killed Liao,
one of the six great generals

234
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:16,000
[LÜ BUWEI] I was told that Liao
fell victim to an illness.

235
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,541
Is that not right,
Lord Changwen?

236
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:26,208
[LORD CHANGWEN] The illness was
a story that was fabricated

237
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,166
by Wang Yi and me.

238
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,625
Liao was killed
by Pang Nuan.

239
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,708
That's the truth of it.

240
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,750
[gasping]

241
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,208
[LÜ BUWEI] And what
sort of general is...

242
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:42,125
this Pang Nuan you speak of?

243
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,458
[LORD CHANGWEN]
He is not a general.

244
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:47,041
[LÜ BUWEI] He's not?

245
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:50,208
[LORD CHANGWEN] Truthfully, I
know almost nothing of the man,

246
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:51,791
but I can say one thing:

247
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:56,166
He is absolutely not the sort to
lead people as a general does.

248
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:00,583
[LORD CHANGWEN] He is a man
completely apart.

249
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:03,541
No, he is more...

250
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:07,041
He's a terrifying
crystallization...

251
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,375
of pure warfare!

252
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:17,791
[LORD CHANGWEN] Nine years ago,
he appeared all alone

253
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:21,500
in the center of a
100,000-man Qin army.

254
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,166
Halt, you there!

255
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,333
These are the
general's quarters!

256
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:28,083
Stop and state
your name and affiliation!

257
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,666
Men, take aim!

258
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,083
[GUARDS scream]

259
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,416
[screaming continues]

260
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,500
[gasping]

261
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:52,208
So, all by himself, you say he
broke through the battle array

262
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,291
that was protecting
the commanding general?

263
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,250
[LORD CHANGPING] One man
demolishing an army

264
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,333
is something that
can never happen.

265
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,708
[LORD CHANGWEN]
And yet it did happen.

266
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:03,666
Pang Nuan single-handedly
demolished it,

267
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,541
then killed Liao when
he tried to stop him.

268
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:10,083
What happened to
Pang Nuan after?

269
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:15,041
[WANG YI yells]

270
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:19,125
[LORD CHANGWEN] He was cut by
Wang Yi who rushed to the scene.

271
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:22,333
I've never seen Wang Yi
in such a fit of passion,

272
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:25,666
not before or since.

273
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,250
[LÜ BUWEI] Wang Yi
cut down Pang Nuan...

274
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:31,916
But then, Pang Nuan lived after
you thought he'd died,

275
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,500
and now those same men are
about to face each other

276
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,291
as opposing generals.

277
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:39,000
That's too much
of a coincidence.

278
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,166
[LORD CHANGWEN]
I imagine that Wang Yi knew

279
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,750
from the very beginning...

280
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:46,583
And that's why he really agreed
to be the commanding general.

281
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:50,333
This battle between them was
carved into their destinies

282
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,875
nine years ago.

283
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:55,583
[ZHENG] Wang Yi must've
lost many brothers in arms

284
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:56,875
over the years.

285
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,375
Why did he choose
this time to act?

286
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,750
Because they were
members of the six?

287
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,083
No...

288
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:06,875
Was Liao... special to Wang Yi
in some way then?

289
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,375
One thing
doesn't make sense.

290
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:14,000
You say Pang Nuan attacked
Liao's headquarters

291
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:17,000
nine years ago.
Why would he do that then?

292
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,250
It's a reckless plan
for the Zhao army,

293
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:22,250
However powerful Pang Nuan
might be in reality.

294
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,583
[LORD CHANGWEN] It had nothing
to do with the Zhao army.

295
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:27,041
[LI SI] Say what?
What do you mean?

296
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,791
[LORD CHANGWEN] Pang Nuan
was not a Zhao soldier.

297
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:33,541
He attacked Liao purely for
personal reasons, you see.

298
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,708
[LORD CHANGPING]
A personal grudge?

299
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:39,083
[LORD CHANGWEN]
No, not a personal grudge.

300
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,500
[LORD CHANGPING]
How can you be so sure?

301
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:43,666
Because I heard it from
the man himself once.

302
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:51,166
[PANG NUAN] Soldiers, armies,
Qin, and Zhao:

303
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,583
These are nothing but
trivialities to me.

304
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:58,041
All that matters is that
at this very moment,

305
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,333
there are two beings
in this land

306
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:04,208
who cause even the
heavens to feel fear.

307
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:07,291
There is another here
other than myself.

308
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:10,208
That I can't let stand.

309
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:17,958
[PANG NUAN] I am Pang Nuan,
god of war!

310
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:21,375
Show thyself, mine enemy!

311
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:26,166
What did you say?
I don't understand!

312
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,291
[LI SI] The man seems to be
beyond the pale!

313
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,375
I agree it was truly insane.

314
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:33,875
But that is the man
known as Pang Nuan.

315
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:37,291
Mhm-mhm, he sounds like
a really fascinating man.

316
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,791
But as you said earlier,
Lord Changwen,

317
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,041
he certainly does not
seem like the sort

318
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,791
to lead people when
you are at war.

319
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:49,583
So why is it he would become
Zhao's commanding general now?

320
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,041
[ZHENG]
Wang Yi...!

321
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:58,500
Pang Nuan accepted in
order to slay Wang Yi.

322
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:01,458
It is very possible,
your highness.

323
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,708
[WANG YI chuckles]

324
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:20,458
Hey, there she is!
Look guys, it's MNyáng!

325
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,541
[SOLDIERS grunting]

326
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:25,666
We need backup!

327
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,583
Give me your soldiers,
or we will--

328
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,833
[MMYÁNG SOLDIER 26B]
Hey, look!

329
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,166
There! Look at that!

330
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:45,750
[MMYÁNG SOLDIER 26A] Yes!
Look, it's our reinforcements!

331
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:48,125
[MMYÁNG SOLDIERS cheer]

332
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,625
[MENG YI]
Hurry, Diao!

333
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:58,708
[DIAO]
What is this place?!

334
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:02,166
Oh good, we are on time!

335
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:06,291
[DIAO] Whoa! We can see the
whole battlefield from here!

336
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:09,750
[MENG YI] Both armies have begun
making their formations.

337
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:13,750
All troops...
advance to the right!

338
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,708
[GENERAL 26A]
Advance to the right!

339
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:19,416
Don't leave any gaps!

340
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,500
Stick tight to the
squads around you!

341
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:25,583
Form lines abreast now!

342
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:46,125
[NARRATOR] A calm but fleeting
moment of quiet passes.

343
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:50,375
The men's feelings interplay
along with their lives.

344
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:52,791
Right now.

345
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:56,458
Wang Yi and Pang Nuan...

346
00:22:56,541 --> 00:23:00,875
After nine years, the two
confront each other once more.

347
00:23:00,958 --> 00:23:02,625
What do they feel inside?

348
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:06,666
Is it hatred? Ambition? Or...?

349
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:19,958
[NARRATOR]
The fated battle now begins!

350
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:56,708
[XIN] My squadron will
take on that mission now!

351
00:24:56,791 --> 00:24:59,791
[NARRATOR] They plow straight
ahead, without wavering.

352
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:02,000
That is their strength.

353
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:05,291
Next Time:
"The FeiXin Force Is Born."
