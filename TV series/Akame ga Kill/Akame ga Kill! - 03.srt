1
00:00:02,353 --> 00:00:04,021
How many intruders and where?

2
00:00:04,326 --> 00:00:07,079
Judging by the reaction of my barrier I'd say about eight.

3
00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:10,221
They're getting a little close
to the hideout if you ask me!

4
00:00:10,407 --> 00:00:12,500
If they were clever enough to sniff us out,

5
00:00:13,195 --> 00:00:15,262
we should assume they're tribal assassins.

6
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:16,433
Move quickly!

7
00:00:16,606 --> 00:00:18,363
Don't let them leave here alive.

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,409
You're still a little new to go
up against a big group like this.

9
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:29,835
So try to be careful! The first thing is to
let your body get a good feel for the battlefield!

10
00:00:29,907 --> 00:00:30,422
Right!

11
00:00:31,155 --> 00:00:32,323
And the second thing is...

12
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:34,207
Please call me either "Handsome" or "Bro".

13
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:35,400
You got it, Bro!

14
00:00:35,519 --> 00:00:37,280
Yeah! Now we're talkin!

15
00:00:37,367 --> 00:00:38,560
Hey, check this out.

16
00:00:40,511 --> 00:00:43,582
Incursio!

17
00:00:43,607 --> 00:00:44,142
Whoa!

18
00:00:52,203 --> 00:00:53,159
Yah!

19
00:00:54,723 --> 00:00:55,990
So cool!

20
00:00:56,326 --> 00:00:59,129
This is the Imperial Arms Incursio.

21
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:02,129
I don't know what Imperial Arms
are, but, man, that was awesome!

22
00:01:02,154 --> 00:01:05,373
Ah, good, I see you recognize its greatness!

23
00:01:13,696 --> 00:01:14,424
It's them.

24
00:01:14,731 --> 00:01:17,619
Now's your chance to see what Imperial Arms are all about.

25
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:18,216
Yeah!

26
00:02:59,563 --> 00:03:01,531
That's the girl from the wanted poster.

27
00:03:01,657 --> 00:03:04,477
That means Night Raid must be around here somewhere.

28
00:03:04,627 --> 00:03:06,444
She's a pretty little thing, huh?

29
00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:08,305
Let's not bang her up too bad.

30
00:03:08,338 --> 00:03:10,522
I wanna have some fun with her first.

31
00:03:12,415 --> 00:03:12,957
Huh?

32
00:03:13,515 --> 00:03:14,097
Wha?

33
00:03:14,324 --> 00:03:15,143
Be careful.

34
00:03:15,498 --> 00:03:17,489
You've entered enemy territory, y'know.

35
00:03:17,574 --> 00:03:18,416
Oh, shit!

36
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:22,621
You bitch!

37
00:03:22,646 --> 00:03:24,323
I'm gonna make you pay for that!

38
00:03:26,376 --> 00:03:27,653
What's going on?

39
00:03:27,997 --> 00:03:29,052
It's poison?!

40
00:03:33,302 --> 00:03:34,992
It only takes one strike.

41
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,401
Crap, they spotted us.

42
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,098
But now I know Night Raid's
hideout is somewhere near here.

43
00:03:40,245 --> 00:03:42,181
That kind of Intel is worth a fortune.

44
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:43,870
I've got to get back to the base.

45
00:03:47,543 --> 00:03:49,100
Well, he's made it pretty far.

46
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,874
Bummer, I really don't like revealing my location.

47
00:03:56,325 --> 00:03:57,777
You're mine!

48
00:04:00,588 --> 00:04:01,509
I'm sorry.

49
00:04:02,191 --> 00:04:03,336
Thank you, Sheele.

50
00:04:04,187 --> 00:04:07,742
Nice timing! That was just enough danger to power up!

51
00:04:11,782 --> 00:04:12,217
Huh?

52
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:23,987
Sweet! Bullseye!

53
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,795
The bigger the trouble I'm in,

54
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,660
the more powerful my beautiful Pumpkin becomes!

55
00:04:28,745 --> 00:04:29,261
Hmm?

56
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,923
That sounded like Pumpkin just now.

57
00:04:32,155 --> 00:04:34,715
I'm surprised she puts up with that finicky thing.

58
00:04:35,153 --> 00:04:39,023
When I go into beast mode I can just
beat the living daylights outta my enemies!

59
00:04:39,048 --> 00:04:40,336
Much more fun!

60
00:04:41,457 --> 00:04:44,868
Oooh, it was a lady tugging my strings this whole time.

61
00:04:44,988 --> 00:04:46,589
Please just spare my life!

62
00:04:46,682 --> 00:04:48,182
I'll do anything you want!

63
00:04:48,207 --> 00:04:49,722
Noooo way.

64
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:53,050
I've seen way too many guys wind
up dead after a girl says that.

65
00:05:09,025 --> 00:05:10,902
Maaan, what a waste.

66
00:05:12,162 --> 00:05:15,103
Why does this job have to be so disappointing sometimes?

67
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:17,878
Yaaahh!

68
00:05:32,595 --> 00:05:33,298
Look out!

69
00:05:33,323 --> 00:05:35,131
Hyah!

70
00:05:35,724 --> 00:05:36,608
Yah!

71
00:05:39,815 --> 00:05:41,711
He's... so strong!

72
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,099
So this...

73
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:44,652
this is the power...

74
00:05:45,102 --> 00:05:46,125
of Night Raid.

75
00:05:47,844 --> 00:05:49,360
You still alive, Tatsumi?

76
00:05:49,518 --> 00:05:49,941
Huh?

77
00:05:51,188 --> 00:05:52,389
Uh, yeah!

78
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:53,924
Then everything's fine!

79
00:05:54,204 --> 00:05:56,107
I can already tell you've got some talent!

80
00:05:58,842 --> 00:05:59,396
Yep!

81
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:16,324
Night Raid...

82
00:06:17,073 --> 00:06:17,991
They're killers...

83
00:06:18,975 --> 00:06:20,750
But they're bringing about a revolution.

84
00:06:21,405 --> 00:06:24,656
Man, I really have found a crazy group of friends, huh?

85
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,013
Heh!

86
00:06:36,286 --> 00:06:38,347
Why'd I dream of him of all people?!

87
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:46,223
The Imperial Capital!

88
00:06:46,269 --> 00:06:50,535
There's a giant wall surrounding the whole
city, and the canals are full of trading ships!

89
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,870
There's so much to see!

90
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:55,427
And don't forget all those sexy, sophisticated city women!

91
00:06:55,452 --> 00:06:55,938
Oooh!

92
00:06:56,286 --> 00:06:57,209
Gross!

93
00:06:57,854 --> 00:06:59,481
Hey, what was that for?!

94
00:07:02,745 --> 00:07:04,582
Sayo... Ieyasu...

95
00:07:05,381 --> 00:07:06,984
I'll do my best for you guys.

96
00:07:07,557 --> 00:07:08,592
I promise.

97
00:07:15,265 --> 00:07:15,729
Hmm?

98
00:07:16,498 --> 00:07:17,696
Is something the matter?

99
00:07:17,908 --> 00:07:19,462
Huh? Oh hey, Sheele.

100
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:20,730
I'm fine...

101
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,890
I'm supposed to be training with Mine today,

102
00:07:22,915 --> 00:07:24,389
but she hasn't come out of her room yet.

103
00:07:24,414 --> 00:07:25,653
Spoiled little brat.

104
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,151
Yeah, well...

105
00:07:27,318 --> 00:07:29,281
Mine does have a habit of sleeping in.

106
00:07:29,306 --> 00:07:31,472
Seriously?! This is her job!

107
00:07:31,854 --> 00:07:33,915
I'm so sorry for the inconvenience.

108
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:35,184
I'll go wake her up now.

109
00:07:35,465 --> 00:07:37,900
Wait. Let Tatsumi do it.

110
00:07:37,947 --> 00:07:39,169
What? Why me?

111
00:07:39,222 --> 00:07:41,347
Because you're her subordinate for today.

112
00:07:41,611 --> 00:07:44,419
Waking up your supervisor is part of an assassin's job.

113
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:47,407
Okay, fine.

114
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:51,601
I wasn't aware that we had that rule.

115
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:54,458
Consider it another test.

116
00:07:54,562 --> 00:07:55,069
Huh?

117
00:07:56,352 --> 00:07:57,365
Hey, Mine!

118
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,052
You just gonna sleep all day or...

119
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:07,165
Hmm?

120
00:08:14,612 --> 00:08:15,909
You coulda killed me!

121
00:08:15,934 --> 00:08:16,963
Well, I missed!

122
00:08:17,113 --> 00:08:18,600
You filthy pervert!

123
00:08:18,682 --> 00:08:21,260
How dare you dodge when you know you deserve to die?!

124
00:08:21,285 --> 00:08:26,298
Oh, whatever! If you hadn't slept in so late,
then I wouldn't have been ordered to come get youuu...

125
00:08:26,323 --> 00:08:30,148
Maybe so, but haven't you ever
heard of a thing called knocking?!

126
00:08:32,162 --> 00:08:35,046
Hey, is there some kind of festival going on?!

127
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,739
She's really going all out.

128
00:08:36,764 --> 00:08:38,834
Tatsumi's in for a long day.

129
00:08:46,636 --> 00:08:48,493
I used to think the capital was great,

130
00:08:49,232 --> 00:08:51,626
but now I can see how miserable the people are.

131
00:08:52,455 --> 00:08:54,623
Hey! Pervert, hurry up!

132
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,361
What's the hold-up, country boy?

133
00:08:56,386 --> 00:08:58,368
Let's move it! Chop chop!

134
00:08:58,888 --> 00:09:01,626
Aren't you supposed to be my faithful servant for the day?

135
00:09:01,684 --> 00:09:02,463
Servant?!

136
00:09:02,488 --> 00:09:03,689
That's what the boss said.

137
00:09:03,714 --> 00:09:06,605
No, I'm just training under you.
There IS a difference, you know!

138
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,806
Yeah, and the operative word there is "under".

139
00:09:08,851 --> 00:09:10,765
C'mon, we don't have a lot of time!

140
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,269
Wha-Hey, wait!

141
00:09:13,197 --> 00:09:13,968
Hmph!

142
00:09:15,924 --> 00:09:16,645
Hey, Mine?

143
00:09:16,903 --> 00:09:17,483
What?

144
00:09:17,646 --> 00:09:19,616
Don't these people look unhappy to you?

145
00:09:20,336 --> 00:09:23,398
They live in fear of the
government. and the economy sucks.

146
00:09:23,573 --> 00:09:26,558
Most everyone's either at rock
bottom or on their way down.

147
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,684
You wouldn't be that chipper either.

148
00:09:30,107 --> 00:09:32,605
Go ahead and cry. Nobody's listenin'!

149
00:09:34,257 --> 00:09:35,658
Hey, what do you two think your do-.

150
00:09:35,683 --> 00:09:38,863
Shouldn't you two jerks be
picking on someone your own size?

151
00:09:38,888 --> 00:09:40,569
You gonna do something about it?

152
00:09:40,703 --> 00:09:43,842
It's fine. This little girl's a
refugee from outside the country.

153
00:09:43,867 --> 00:09:46,336
I mean, she could turn out to be a traitor any second.

154
00:09:46,436 --> 00:09:47,343
So could I.

155
00:09:47,492 --> 00:09:48,132
Huh?

156
00:09:48,251 --> 00:09:48,951
Tatsumi?

157
00:09:49,065 --> 00:09:49,536
Got it.

158
00:09:59,802 --> 00:10:00,492
Hmph.

159
00:10:00,789 --> 00:10:02,661
Thank you for saving me.

160
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:03,626
Don't thank me.

161
00:10:05,122 --> 00:10:08,043
Just grow up strong so you can protect yourself, okay?

162
00:10:11,094 --> 00:10:11,889
Ah...

163
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:17,611
I hate to ask, but is it safe for you to
wander around in broad daylight like this?

164
00:10:17,711 --> 00:10:19,135
Huh? Why not?

165
00:10:19,295 --> 00:10:21,597
They've only identified four of us so far.

166
00:10:22,346 --> 00:10:23,703
Guess that makes sense.

167
00:10:24,086 --> 00:10:24,571
Huh?

168
00:10:25,507 --> 00:10:26,968
Wait, who's that guy in the middle?

169
00:10:27,402 --> 00:10:28,425
That's Bulat.

170
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,216
Ohhh, Bulat.

171
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:33,241
Tha... that's bro?!

172
00:10:33,493 --> 00:10:35,541
That picture's from back in his army days.

173
00:10:35,566 --> 00:10:38,028
He changed his look whenever he signed with Night Raid.

174
00:10:40,832 --> 00:10:42,274
That looks nothing like him!

175
00:10:42,691 --> 00:10:43,471
Ah, hah.

176
00:10:43,906 --> 00:10:47,270
Oh man, that's all I need is
another image to haunt me in my dreams.

177
00:10:47,295 --> 00:10:51,169
Anyway the Boss gave this mission to you
and me, because we can walk around freely.

178
00:10:51,249 --> 00:10:52,122
Understand?

179
00:10:52,267 --> 00:10:53,190
Oh, okay!

180
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:55,391
I was wondering why we were patrolling this part of town.

181
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:58,485
Good! Now it's time for our retail investigation!

182
00:10:58,629 --> 00:11:00,902
I don't know what that means, but woohoo!

183
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,800
Ahhhh... What a day!

184
00:11:21,311 --> 00:11:24,236
Nothing makes me happier than a brand new pink dress!

185
00:11:24,261 --> 00:11:25,355
Yeah, whatever...

186
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,045
Isn't it wonderful to have a whole day to goof off?

187
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,227
Yeah, whatever...

188
00:11:29,906 --> 00:11:31,970
Well, the mission's complete!

189
00:11:31,995 --> 00:11:34,618
What the hell?! We did nothing but shop all day!

190
00:11:34,643 --> 00:11:36,216
Welp, Get over it!

191
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,110
Have you already forgotten that I'm above you?

192
00:11:40,457 --> 00:11:42,738
Good servants don't question their masters.

193
00:11:42,945 --> 00:11:46,222
You should be grateful that I deemed
you worthy enough to carry my bags!

194
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,513
Yeah well you're not gonna be my boss forever, you know!

195
00:11:48,706 --> 00:11:50,385
Plus, nothing we did counts as training!

196
00:11:50,746 --> 00:11:54,474
What? You think you can just
waltz in here and be on my level?

197
00:11:55,068 --> 00:11:58,340
You do seem pretty confident
in your skills as a swordsman...

198
00:11:59,995 --> 00:12:02,494
but you haven't seen nearly as much combat as me.

199
00:12:03,651 --> 00:12:04,418
I get it.

200
00:12:04,846 --> 00:12:05,349
Huh?

201
00:12:06,108 --> 00:12:06,928
I'm new...

202
00:12:07,414 --> 00:12:10,181
So there are going to be some things
about this job that I don't get yet.

203
00:12:11,172 --> 00:12:13,755
But still! I am gonna keep on fighting!

204
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:15,899
For Sayo and Ieyasu!

205
00:12:16,424 --> 00:12:16,809
Ah...

206
00:12:19,647 --> 00:12:21,854
Akame and Bulat have high hopes for you,

207
00:12:22,371 --> 00:12:23,823
but I have my doubts.

208
00:12:26,861 --> 00:12:28,222
So what's that all about?

209
00:12:28,797 --> 00:12:30,070
It's an execution.

210
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:32,119
They're pretty common here.

211
00:12:45,449 --> 00:12:47,384
How can they do this to people?

212
00:12:48,831 --> 00:12:51,393
It's the minister who supports this sort of cruelty.

213
00:12:51,546 --> 00:12:55,357
Ultimately, he put the child emperor
on the throne so he could be in control.

214
00:12:55,927 --> 00:12:56,876
As for me...

215
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,175
I'll never end up like this.

216
00:13:01,146 --> 00:13:04,623
I am going to survive this hell no matter what happens!

217
00:13:07,116 --> 00:13:08,346
The Minister, huh?

218
00:13:09,483 --> 00:13:11,536
What kind of monster is this guy?

219
00:13:21,764 --> 00:13:23,427
Administrator Shoi...

220
00:13:23,613 --> 00:13:28,007
For speaking out publicly against Our
policies and interfering with matters of state,

221
00:13:28,047 --> 00:13:30,552
We decree you shall be drawn-and-quartered!

222
00:13:33,598 --> 00:13:35,605
Did We make the right decision, Minister?

223
00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:39,340
Oh yes, Your Highness.

224
00:13:39,563 --> 00:13:43,009
You're the wisest ruler the Empire could ever dream of.

225
00:13:43,396 --> 00:13:44,949
Is that meat again?

226
00:13:45,174 --> 00:13:46,430
You eat that a lot.

227
00:13:46,928 --> 00:13:50,496
I want to enjoy it now, while I'm young and healthy.

228
00:13:50,556 --> 00:13:52,658
Buono, buono!

229
00:13:53,175 --> 00:13:56,060
Your Majesty, the minister is deceiving you!

230
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:00,606
Please! I implore you! Open your
ears and hear the voice of the people!

231
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:03,163
Well, Minister, did you hear what he just said?

232
00:14:03,326 --> 00:14:06,096
Seems the poor fellow's lost his mind.

233
00:14:06,151 --> 00:14:10,752
Right! You've never lead me astray
before, so this man must be insane!

234
00:14:12,086 --> 00:14:13,525
My old friend...

235
00:14:14,543 --> 00:14:16,421
Why must it end this way?

236
00:14:16,446 --> 00:14:20,707
No, please! Your Grace if you don't
stop him, he'll lead the empire into ruin!

237
00:14:21,343 --> 00:14:23,622
Please... Your Grace.

238
00:14:24,013 --> 00:14:25,333
No need to worry.

239
00:14:25,821 --> 00:14:31,402
You can count on me to look after that
beautiful wife you're leaving behind.

240
00:14:31,448 --> 00:14:34,667
I'll be sure to satisfy all her needs.

241
00:14:35,122 --> 00:14:37,728
And I do mean "all" of them.

242
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,440
Nooo! You can't let this happen!

243
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,876
He can't do this!

244
00:14:44,901 --> 00:14:46,485
He must be stopped!

245
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,234
Someone... anyone...

246
00:14:48,301 --> 00:14:50,716
I'm begging you... That man is a demon!

247
00:14:50,873 --> 00:14:52,444
Can't any of you see that?!

248
00:14:52,584 --> 00:14:56,974
Please! Pleeeaaase!!!!

249
00:14:58,139 --> 00:14:59,875
Night Raid has a new mission.

250
00:15:00,181 --> 00:15:04,712
This time our target is a distant
relative of Minister Honest: Iokal.

251
00:15:04,962 --> 00:15:09,648
He's been using the minister's name so that he can
kidnap innocent women and then beat them to death.

252
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,682
Iokal also has five mercenary guards.

253
00:15:12,707 --> 00:15:14,102
They're equally guilty.

254
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,517
I'm counting on you guys.

255
00:15:16,805 --> 00:15:18,279
Now, go take him out!

256
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:22,042
So that's Iokal's mansion.

257
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:24,326
It's enormous.

258
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,040
Hey, Mine.

259
00:15:26,165 --> 00:15:26,775
What?

260
00:15:27,031 --> 00:15:29,320
Is that one of those Imperial Arms things too?

261
00:15:29,371 --> 00:15:31,464
Yep! Its name is Pumpkin.

262
00:15:32,035 --> 00:15:35,329
It gets more deadly the more danger I find myself in.

263
00:15:35,951 --> 00:15:39,255
But a girl like me is hardly ever in any real danger.

264
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:42,085
How on earth did you figure out
how to make something like that?

265
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:44,764
Nobody makes Imperial Arms, stupid.

266
00:15:44,789 --> 00:15:47,268
Jeez, they're ancient, legendary weapons.

267
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,751
I'm amazed by the things you don't know.

268
00:15:53,068 --> 00:15:55,448
I don't need a risk factor this far away.

269
00:15:55,501 --> 00:15:57,983
I'll shoot him as soon as he sets foot outside.

270
00:15:58,482 --> 00:16:02,311
Right, and as soon as you splatter him, it's my
job to make sure you don't get hurt on the way back!

271
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,334
Leave it to me!

272
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:06,665
Heh! I'll keep my expectations low.

273
00:16:14,797 --> 00:16:16,450
She's so determined...

274
00:16:16,566 --> 00:16:18,843
I can almost feel how focused she is!

275
00:16:19,255 --> 00:16:20,155
Here he comes.

276
00:16:20,927 --> 00:16:21,410
Where?

277
00:16:23,206 --> 00:16:26,796
Ah! Okay, I see him, but those
other guys aren't on the hit list!

278
00:16:26,869 --> 00:16:27,820
That's fine.

279
00:16:28,144 --> 00:16:29,245
How is that fine?

280
00:16:29,478 --> 00:16:30,908
You'll never make the shot from here.

281
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,357
They are irrelevant.

282
00:16:32,614 --> 00:16:33,614
Irrelevant?

283
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:34,931
No, don't!

284
00:16:35,435 --> 00:16:36,542
We can't shoot innocent pe-.

285
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,799
Oh, I should let you know, I'm
kind of a badass, sniper genius.

286
00:16:48,324 --> 00:16:50,925
We must find Lord Iokal's killer at all costs!

287
00:16:51,013 --> 00:16:53,382
If we don't, the minister will have our heads!

288
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,215
Right! He can't be too far!

289
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:59,289
What do we have here?

290
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,574
Nice of you guys to save us
the trouble of chasin' you down.

291
00:17:05,421 --> 00:17:08,744
Ah, man! The escape route is not ideal.

292
00:17:09,605 --> 00:17:11,034
Think they've finished off the guards yet?

293
00:17:11,867 --> 00:17:14,635
Those guards trained at the Imperial Fist Temple.

294
00:17:15,012 --> 00:17:16,648
It may take a little while.

295
00:17:16,853 --> 00:17:19,523
That's the best martial arts temple in the Empire.

296
00:17:19,925 --> 00:17:22,709
Guess you get what's coming to you
if you mess with the minister's family.

297
00:17:22,993 --> 00:17:26,879
Yeah. He was using his family's influence to get ahead.

298
00:17:27,385 --> 00:17:29,023
I hate that more than anything!

299
00:17:32,269 --> 00:17:33,763
Sounds like there's a story there.

300
00:17:35,008 --> 00:17:38,542
I feel like being nice to you right now,
so I'll tell you the story behind that.

301
00:17:38,827 --> 00:17:40,255
Didn't even have to ask!

302
00:17:42,571 --> 00:17:45,513
I was born into one of the tribes on the western border.

303
00:17:46,628 --> 00:17:48,608
That means half of my blood is foreign.

304
00:17:48,904 --> 00:17:51,247
The villagers treated me terribly because of it,

305
00:17:51,861 --> 00:17:54,126
and no one showed me an ounce of respect.

306
00:17:55,525 --> 00:17:57,225
My childhood was a nightmare.

307
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:03,021
But the Revolutionary Army formed
an alliance with the western tribe.

308
00:18:03,952 --> 00:18:06,190
So if we do end up having a new nation,

309
00:18:06,329 --> 00:18:08,615
people will stop caring about our differences!

310
00:18:08,917 --> 00:18:12,130
And no more kids will have to
go through what I did growing up.

311
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:16,784
I will not allow anybody else
to ever suffer such intolerance!

312
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,397
Wow, Mine...

313
00:18:19,481 --> 00:18:22,584
Not to mention after everything I've
accomplished in the name of revolution,

314
00:18:22,677 --> 00:18:25,790
I'll get loads of reward money
and grow old in the lap of luxury!

315
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,193
Oh man, that felt so incredible!

316
00:18:33,616 --> 00:18:35,751
That was a rather pleasant challenge, wasn't it?

317
00:18:35,924 --> 00:18:37,151
Something's not right.

318
00:18:37,733 --> 00:18:40,069
I thought the Boss said we were supposed to kill five.

319
00:18:40,243 --> 00:18:42,303
Aw man, I didn't get to kill anybody!

320
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,623
So I guess there's one left.

321
00:18:43,648 --> 00:18:44,556
Too bad, Lubb.

322
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,833
I'm dockin' your pay.

323
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,428
What?! You can't do that!

324
00:18:48,483 --> 00:18:49,441
Wanna bet?

325
00:18:53,336 --> 00:18:54,215
Tatsumi...

326
00:18:58,093 --> 00:18:59,613
This is the rendezvous point.

327
00:18:59,948 --> 00:19:00,928
Guess we're all done.

328
00:19:01,863 --> 00:19:03,835
Not until we report back in, remember?

329
00:19:03,946 --> 00:19:06,000
Ha! You sound like Akame.

330
00:19:08,876 --> 00:19:09,465
Look out!

331
00:19:12,182 --> 00:19:12,824
Tatsumi!

332
00:19:13,495 --> 00:19:14,352
Who are you?

333
00:19:14,377 --> 00:19:17,015
I must say I've outdone myself.

334
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,052
You're a fighter from the temple.

335
00:19:19,282 --> 00:19:22,273
I am. Assistant instructor, to be exact.

336
00:19:22,511 --> 00:19:24,296
Course, that was ten years ago now.

337
00:19:24,321 --> 00:19:26,821
And look at you now, protecting a nobody!

338
00:19:26,935 --> 00:19:29,438
Oh my, how far the mighty have fallen!

339
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:31,946
Let's just say I stirred up some trouble!

340
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,775
Better say your prayers, little girl.

341
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,559
You're going straight to the minister!

342
00:19:39,886 --> 00:19:41,170
That's not gonna happen!

343
00:19:48,537 --> 00:19:50,100
Hurry, Mine! Shoot him!

344
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,935
Tatsumi...

345
00:19:53,216 --> 00:19:55,588
I can't believe you'd sacrifice yourself!

346
00:19:55,613 --> 00:19:56,874
I'm still alive, you know!

347
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,163
You said you're a genius sniper, didn't you?

348
00:19:59,381 --> 00:20:00,233
You can do it!

349
00:20:04,227 --> 00:20:06,012
Damn it, put me down right now!

350
00:20:06,036 --> 00:20:06,563
Hurry!

351
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,250
Since when do you think you can give me orders?

352
00:20:09,851 --> 00:20:11,950
Might as well give it my best shot though!

353
00:20:12,221 --> 00:20:13,603
Ah crap!

354
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:37,243
You... You bastards are gonna pay dearly for...

355
00:20:37,386 --> 00:20:41,121
for assassinating... a member
of the minister's own family...

356
00:20:49,572 --> 00:20:52,633
Hey, you. Looks like you've got some guts after all.

357
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:56,212
I suppose I ought to commend you on your braver-.

358
00:20:56,912 --> 00:20:58,698
You didn't need to cut it that close.

359
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:02,160
Look at what that Pumpkin thing did to my freakin' hair!

360
00:21:02,271 --> 00:21:04,448
Ah! What's with you?!

361
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:06,248
A genius was about to give you a compliment, dumbass!

362
00:21:06,273 --> 00:21:09,450
Oh, shut it! You're not a genius,
you're just too smart for you own good!

363
00:21:09,475 --> 00:21:12,583
I guess there was no need to rush
all the way over here, was there?

364
00:21:19,768 --> 00:21:22,738
Some fellow Imperial Arms users...

365
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:24,746
and they're killers!

366
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,343
Mmm, how utterly delightful!

367
00:21:28,757 --> 00:21:30,727
I must get my hands on them.

368
00:21:31,141 --> 00:21:32,624
Hey, you over there!

369
00:21:33,115 --> 00:21:34,345
What're you doing back here?

370
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:35,363
Don't move!

371
00:21:42,945 --> 00:21:47,495
I think the Imperial Capital's going to
be the perfect place to call my new home.

372
00:21:47,901 --> 00:21:51,649
It's so crowded there's a new victim around every corner!

373
00:21:53,436 --> 00:21:54,822
How delightful!
