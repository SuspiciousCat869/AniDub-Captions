1
00:00:02,587 --> 00:00:05,760
I am gonna get a ton of experience points for this guy!

2
00:00:07,052 --> 00:00:08,086
Behind you!

3
00:00:08,154 --> 00:00:08,903
Ugh!

4
00:00:09,254 --> 00:00:10,323
Uh!

5
00:00:14,031 --> 00:00:16,978
He slaughtered the big guy
and got the other two off his back.

6
00:00:17,972 --> 00:00:21,043
And... he did it in a split second!

7
00:00:21,068 --> 00:00:25,220
You played a vital role in getting rid of
covert operatives back then, did you not?

8
00:00:25,517 --> 00:00:28,205
It truly has been a while, hasn't it, Bulat?

9
00:00:30,174 --> 00:00:33,591
It's you, General Liver!

10
00:00:34,232 --> 00:00:36,086
Former General, actually.

11
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:41,202
Ever since Master Esdeath saved my
life. I have been her devoted servant.

12
00:00:41,629 --> 00:00:42,216
Huh?

13
00:00:43,106 --> 00:00:46,781
Is this the same guy Bro was talking
about in the story from his past?

14
00:00:59,925 --> 00:01:03,082
If things were different, I'd be
drinking a toast to our reunion.

15
00:01:04,102 --> 00:01:07,834
But since they're not, I'm going to have to kill you.

16
00:01:09,227 --> 00:01:11,036
The mission comes first!

17
00:01:11,827 --> 00:01:14,224
I couldn't have said it better myself.

18
00:01:14,284 --> 00:01:17,638
General Esdeath's wishes will be realized.

19
00:01:18,929 --> 00:01:21,010
And to ensure that I am successful,

20
00:01:21,093 --> 00:01:23,693
she gave me this Imperial Arm!

21
00:03:07,006 --> 00:03:10,086
The Black Marlin, it's a ring-type weapon.

22
00:03:10,772 --> 00:03:15,991
It was crafted from the organs of aquatic
Danger Beasts with the power to control water.

23
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:20,820
As such, whoever wears it can
manipulate any liquid at will.

24
00:03:21,817 --> 00:03:25,805
If this is our battlefield, Lady
Luck is certainly smiling upon me.

25
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:30,560
So you fight with water now.

26
00:03:30,747 --> 00:03:33,280
Rather convenient that your boss is an ice user.

27
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,806
General Esdeath can create ice out of thin air.

28
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:39,339
Do not elevate me to her level.

29
00:03:39,364 --> 00:03:40,559
She is a god!

30
00:03:41,253 --> 00:03:42,465
Water Fire!

31
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:45,291
Touchy, touchy...

32
00:03:48,037 --> 00:03:49,423
Son of a bitch...

33
00:03:50,036 --> 00:03:53,282
And it looks like Liver's got
his hands full with this guy, too.

34
00:03:53,415 --> 00:03:56,323
Well, with all this water
around, I'm sure he should be okay.

35
00:03:56,643 --> 00:03:58,433
But a little backup would be nice.

36
00:03:58,506 --> 00:03:59,751
Not if I can help it!

37
00:03:59,776 --> 00:04:01,160
Aah!

38
00:04:02,487 --> 00:04:06,556
You guys are frickin' crazy if you think I'm
just gonna sit over there and watch the whole time!

39
00:04:06,602 --> 00:04:07,740
You're in the way.

40
00:04:08,401 --> 00:04:09,529
Back off!

41
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:13,512
You Night Raid people are really freakin' annoying!

42
00:04:20,006 --> 00:04:20,506
Uh!

43
00:04:20,632 --> 00:04:22,199
Hehehe...

44
00:04:23,593 --> 00:04:24,578
Ah!

45
00:04:25,793 --> 00:04:26,253
Huh?

46
00:04:27,662 --> 00:04:28,207
Heh...

47
00:04:28,232 --> 00:04:29,560
Ahh!

48
00:04:30,573 --> 00:04:31,355
Uh!

49
00:04:31,873 --> 00:04:33,997
Damn, this kid is fast!

50
00:04:35,106 --> 00:04:35,873
Hehe...

51
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:37,918
But I've trained for this.

52
00:04:44,231 --> 00:04:46,022
Akame is faster than you!

53
00:04:46,106 --> 00:04:46,735
What?

54
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,960
Do not compare me to some assassin!

55
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,478
If he hadn't gotten in one lucky
hit, I'd have killed him already!

56
00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:03,466
How's he fighting like this when he's injured?

57
00:05:03,898 --> 00:05:07,958
These Three Beasts are so tough they
make guys like Ogre look like child's play.

58
00:05:20,249 --> 00:05:23,008
Whoa! The fight's starting to
get pretty intense over there!

59
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:24,073
Of course!

60
00:05:24,098 --> 00:05:27,501
But it's a battle near a body of
water. Sir Liver has the advantage!

61
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:30,639
Ha! Bro's about to mop the floor with that old geezer.

62
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,121
Liver shall prevail!

63
00:05:32,153 --> 00:05:33,428
He doesn't stand a chance!

64
00:05:33,453 --> 00:05:35,525
The water pressure will destroy you!

65
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,243
Say goodbye, Bulat!

66
00:05:40,828 --> 00:05:42,960
Snake from the Abyss!

67
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:53,342
Ahhh!

68
00:05:55,965 --> 00:05:56,854
Hehehe...

69
00:05:57,621 --> 00:06:02,453
It seems I correctly assumed you would
attack the snake head-on rather than dodge.

70
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:05,839
You knew there'd be countless casualties
if I destroyed the ship.

71
00:06:06,374 --> 00:06:11,686
And perhaps, you'd be able to avoid my next
technique if your feet were planted securely on the deck,

72
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,954
but you can't dodge in midair!

73
00:06:16,121 --> 00:06:18,120
Dark Water Spears!

74
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:20,813
Gah!

75
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:22,832
Aah!

76
00:06:26,393 --> 00:06:28,410
Takes more than a splash of water

77
00:06:28,435 --> 00:06:30,887
to extinguish the fire in my soul!

78
00:06:31,993 --> 00:06:33,248
But of course.

79
00:06:33,575 --> 00:06:36,718
I would never finish you off with such a simple strike.

80
00:06:37,178 --> 00:06:40,375
After all, I know what you're capable of.

81
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:44,450
The two of us have been through
many a battle together, remember?

82
00:06:44,576 --> 00:06:49,078
I know all your strengths and weaknesses
better than anyone else in the world.

83
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:54,234
And that's precisely why I'd like to
show you the power of my trump card!

84
00:06:55,287 --> 00:06:56,502
Water Dragons...

85
00:06:56,989 --> 00:06:58,801
Conquer Heaven!

86
00:07:02,149 --> 00:07:02,775
Gah!

87
00:07:02,813 --> 00:07:09,463
Aaaaah!

88
00:07:13,277 --> 00:07:15,265
Hmm, I think I got him.

89
00:07:16,056 --> 00:07:16,623
Huh?

90
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:20,114
I can't believe you actually just said that.

91
00:07:20,495 --> 00:07:22,734
You should know better old man!

92
00:07:22,828 --> 00:07:24,039
How did you survive that?!

93
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:26,051
Haaaa!

94
00:07:26,076 --> 00:07:26,918
Ah!

95
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:28,944
Huh?

96
00:07:29,545 --> 00:07:30,100
Ha!

97
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:30,905
Ugh!

98
00:07:34,497 --> 00:07:35,648
What a joke.

99
00:07:35,841 --> 00:07:37,654
You realize what you've done, right?

100
00:07:37,756 --> 00:07:40,862
You just threw away your only chance at defeating Liver.

101
00:07:43,668 --> 00:07:44,355
Bro...

102
00:07:45,243 --> 00:07:45,960
Tatsumi!

103
00:07:46,329 --> 00:07:48,844
I'm sorry, it's my fault.

104
00:07:49,418 --> 00:07:50,553
I wasn't able to

105
00:07:51,257 --> 00:07:53,278
hold him off long enough for you to finish.

106
00:07:53,303 --> 00:07:56,214
What is this? You mean you can still move?

107
00:07:56,685 --> 00:08:01,328
Why don't you just take yourself a little nap,
so I can take my precious time with you later?

108
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:02,839
Don't sweat it, okay?

109
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:04,323
Huh?

110
00:08:05,876 --> 00:08:09,418
I'm just amazed you managed to get
through all this without an Imperial Arms.

111
00:08:09,443 --> 00:08:10,706
Uh, yeah, I guess...

112
00:08:11,451 --> 00:08:13,608
Even with his armor, he got beat up pretty bad!

113
00:08:14,523 --> 00:08:19,857
I noticed your Imperial Arms deactivates itself
after you've taken a certain amount of damage.

114
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,385
We seem to have a clear winner.

115
00:08:22,698 --> 00:08:24,647
Hmm. You don't need to play it tough.

116
00:08:25,466 --> 00:08:28,570
That little drop of blood coming
from your ear is a dead giveaway.

117
00:08:28,595 --> 00:08:29,297
Uh?

118
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:35,114
Your internal organs must've taken a
huge hit when you used your trump card.

119
00:08:36,037 --> 00:08:39,718
So I doubt you're in any condition
to use your Imperial Arms anymore.

120
00:08:39,931 --> 00:08:40,690
Hmph.

121
00:08:40,715 --> 00:08:42,481
Nothing gets past you, does it?

122
00:08:42,574 --> 00:08:45,943
And here I was hoping to have
the upper hand in the negotiations.

123
00:08:47,844 --> 00:08:50,235
Well then! I must ask.

124
00:08:50,435 --> 00:08:53,232
How would you like to become a member of Esdeath's army?

125
00:08:53,585 --> 00:08:56,470
I'm sure she would be willing
to bring you on as a Lieutenant.

126
00:08:56,726 --> 00:09:00,290
Thanks, but I lost interest in
serving the Empire a long time ago.

127
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,050
Don't think of it that way.

128
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:04,674
You'd be working for Esdeath, not the Empire.

129
00:09:04,783 --> 00:09:07,061
Doing so changed my life for the better.

130
00:09:07,086 --> 00:09:10,911
Since joining forces with Esdeath,
people everywhere cower before me.

131
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:16,548
In fact, my name is so feared that all the bureaucrats
in the Capital clamour to stay in my good graces!

132
00:09:16,573 --> 00:09:19,003
I've got every single one of them under my thumb!

133
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,966
I implore you to come with me!

134
00:09:23,135 --> 00:09:26,676
If you do, the Master can erase all
of your crimes from the record books!

135
00:09:26,701 --> 00:09:27,783
I said no.

136
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:29,548
Don't you get it.

137
00:09:29,774 --> 00:09:33,882
I would find no joy in becoming the
very thing we were sworn to destroy.

138
00:09:35,162 --> 00:09:40,416
Since I know Esdeath is scratching the Minister's
back. How could I possibly live with myself.

139
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:43,630
It'd tarnish my image as a hero
to the masses, now wouldn't it?

140
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,892
A hero to the masses?

141
00:09:46,095 --> 00:09:49,746
I can't believe a known assassin
would dare to say something so arrogant.

142
00:09:50,413 --> 00:09:52,957
I was trying to make it sound like I was being modest.

143
00:09:53,476 --> 00:09:55,558
Both of them have finally reached their limit.

144
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:58,765
But what they don't know is that
we still have our trump card...

145
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,338
then it's over!

146
00:10:01,049 --> 00:10:02,399
Ah, Bro, wait...

147
00:10:03,385 --> 00:10:05,343
When Imperial Arms users face off...

148
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,602
one of them always dies.

149
00:10:08,696 --> 00:10:11,000
Neither one of us can use our weapons anymore.

150
00:10:11,025 --> 00:10:13,294
Then we'll finish this with our swords.

151
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:15,320
Ugh.

152
00:10:15,992 --> 00:10:16,612
Huh?

153
00:10:21,683 --> 00:10:23,957
It's time for a little enhancement.

154
00:10:24,643 --> 00:10:26,847
I am about to fight you after all.

155
00:10:26,872 --> 00:10:28,161
Bro. Wait a sec!

156
00:10:28,186 --> 00:10:30,015
Something's not right about this guy!

157
00:10:30,243 --> 00:10:33,441
Yeah, I'm painfully aware he's
not gonna be an easy one to beat.

158
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,150
Here we go!

159
00:10:47,558 --> 00:10:48,918
Ah!

160
00:10:48,943 --> 00:10:49,976
Uh ah!

161
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:51,287
That's crazy...

162
00:10:51,312 --> 00:10:53,907
it's hard to believe these two are both already injured.

163
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:14,836
You got him!

164
00:11:20,109 --> 00:11:21,376
My real trump card,

165
00:11:21,409 --> 00:11:23,843
Killer Blood Swords!

166
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:27,476
Of course you had something up your sleeve!

167
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,555
Keep after him!

168
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:37,866
Ugh!

169
00:11:38,036 --> 00:11:40,106
Bro, you sure you're gonna be okay?

170
00:11:40,443 --> 00:11:42,810
I don't think I let him land any fatal blows,

171
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,268
so I should be alright.

172
00:11:44,476 --> 00:11:47,599
I put all I had left into that final attack...

173
00:11:48,891 --> 00:11:51,881
and yet you still blocked it. Well played.

174
00:11:55,622 --> 00:12:00,082
If I had hesitated just a second, he would
have annihilated me before I knew what hit me.

175
00:12:00,922 --> 00:12:03,255
When I saw the spray pattern of his blood,

176
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,694
I realized it was another form of liquid.

177
00:12:07,355 --> 00:12:08,673
You were incredible, Bro!

178
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:12,988
I can't believe he was able to
wipe out two powerful enemies...

179
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:15,060
even though all I did was get in the way!

180
00:12:15,681 --> 00:12:17,528
Man, that was a really close call!

181
00:12:18,527 --> 00:12:19,405
Bulat...

182
00:12:19,727 --> 00:12:20,405
Huh?

183
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:23,580
There's one thing I wanted to tell you.

184
00:12:24,028 --> 00:12:27,327
There's a reason I decided to join General Esdeath's army.

185
00:12:27,561 --> 00:12:29,227
I didn't tell you before.

186
00:12:33,588 --> 00:12:37,388
It's a shame to allow a treasure
like you to rot away in a cell.

187
00:12:37,771 --> 00:12:41,019
I'm looking for an adjutant
with incomparable combat abilities.

188
00:12:41,601 --> 00:12:43,394
I'd like you in my army.

189
00:12:43,741 --> 00:12:44,534
Huh?

190
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,497
No, I couldn't return to the army even if I wanted to.

191
00:12:49,522 --> 00:12:51,203
I'm charged with an offense.

192
00:12:51,976 --> 00:12:53,749
Excuses are for the weak.

193
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,382
You may re-enlist...

194
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:57,848
because I want you to re-enlist.

195
00:12:57,873 --> 00:13:01,234
To put it frankly, I will not
allow anyone to raise an objection.

196
00:13:01,368 --> 00:13:03,877
But the Minister will never stand for it.

197
00:13:04,048 --> 00:13:06,101
I'm a great deal of help to the Minister.

198
00:13:06,801 --> 00:13:09,938
If you're an asset to my forces,
he'll be glad to have you back.

199
00:13:10,807 --> 00:13:12,859
Please say you'll fight with me, Liver.

200
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,123
And if you're still feeling unsure,

201
00:13:15,368 --> 00:13:17,087
allow me to ease your fears.

202
00:13:21,727 --> 00:13:24,584
I have respect and admiration for Esdeath.

203
00:13:25,422 --> 00:13:26,999
That's the real reason.

204
00:13:28,254 --> 00:13:29,019
Liver...

205
00:13:29,845 --> 00:13:30,892
And as such...

206
00:13:31,267 --> 00:13:34,557
I swear on my honor as a devout servant of General Esdeath

207
00:13:34,941 --> 00:13:37,909
that in mere moments I will be taking your life as well!

208
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,480
Hang in there!

209
00:13:40,774 --> 00:13:43,128
Ugh... Uh...

210
00:13:43,388 --> 00:13:45,496
That wasn't just an enhancement.

211
00:13:45,748 --> 00:13:48,168
You injected poison into your own blood!

212
00:13:48,193 --> 00:13:48,753
Uh...

213
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:54,007
You haven't developed a resistance to it,
so the poison is going to kill you quickly.

214
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:55,789
It'll soon be over.

215
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:57,412
As for me...

216
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,374
I must be going on ahead...

217
00:14:08,296 --> 00:14:10,797
I should have expected as much from you.

218
00:14:11,335 --> 00:14:13,366
We have defeated each other.

219
00:14:14,468 --> 00:14:15,261
Bro!

220
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,849
Let's go patch you up!

221
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,746
Tatsumi...

222
00:14:20,655 --> 00:14:24,336
We're not done yet sunshine;
I'm afraid this fight isn't over.

223
00:14:25,581 --> 00:14:26,279
Oh...

224
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:30,816
Did you really think the Killer
Blood Swords were all we had?

225
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,337
Hm. So sorry.

226
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,070
The real trump card is me.

227
00:14:36,967 --> 00:14:40,317
Trump Card: Invite the Demonic Human.

228
00:14:52,722 --> 00:14:54,288
This weapon is called Scream.

229
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,568
And it can do much more than just make people go to sleep.

230
00:14:58,056 --> 00:15:02,984
Like one little trick is making myself bigger
and stronger, so I can tear your ass to pieces.

231
00:15:03,009 --> 00:15:03,817
Oh, man.

232
00:15:04,253 --> 00:15:06,640
He made himself double in size automatically!

233
00:15:06,914 --> 00:15:08,507
That is one hell of a trump card!

234
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:09,227
Ah...

235
00:15:09,888 --> 00:15:11,930
Well now, it's been kind of a long time.

236
00:15:12,007 --> 00:15:14,352
It feels pretty good to be back in this body.

237
00:15:14,992 --> 00:15:15,958
This is bad...

238
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:18,432
He was already too hard to beat.

239
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:21,192
What the hell am I gonna do now?

240
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:23,227
Tatsumi...

241
00:15:23,408 --> 00:15:23,907
Uh?

242
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:26,584
Tatsumi, here.

243
00:15:27,014 --> 00:15:28,455
I'm leaving this to you.

244
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:30,936
Is that...?

245
00:15:31,401 --> 00:15:33,096
The key to Incursio.

246
00:15:34,206 --> 00:15:37,465
The armor will always belong
to the one who possesses the key.

247
00:15:37,821 --> 00:15:41,204
No, you can't do that! You can't give me Incursio.

248
00:15:42,688 --> 00:15:44,954
What good will it do you if you can't put it on?

249
00:15:45,122 --> 00:15:47,149
Not just anyone can wear that armor.

250
00:15:47,348 --> 00:15:51,170
The wrong person will die
instantly if they even try using it.

251
00:15:51,487 --> 00:15:53,188
You might as well just give it up.

252
00:15:53,788 --> 00:15:56,566
Wouldn't want you to die before we get a chance to play.

253
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,719
So quit being a coward and fight like normal?

254
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:00,320
Hm...

255
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:02,573
Huh?

256
00:16:02,724 --> 00:16:03,550
Uhh...

257
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,648
Are you really gonna let your
opponent tell you what to do?

258
00:16:08,721 --> 00:16:10,063
Don't be ridiculous!

259
00:16:10,246 --> 00:16:14,022
Look. You've had a lot of training
and gained some great experience.

260
00:16:14,313 --> 00:16:16,864
That's everything you need to equip Incursio!

261
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:17,537
Alright?!

262
00:16:18,655 --> 00:16:19,567
I don't know.

263
00:16:20,362 --> 00:16:21,188
Hmm.

264
00:16:21,633 --> 00:16:24,768
I want to avenge my friends by ripping this guy to shreds.

265
00:16:25,522 --> 00:16:27,474
He can't just up and die on me.

266
00:16:28,598 --> 00:16:31,455
You need an affinity for an Imperial Arms.

267
00:16:31,681 --> 00:16:34,824
Yours won't be enough, it'll kill you instantly.

268
00:16:34,849 --> 00:16:36,776
If you like the way a weapon feels...

269
00:16:36,989 --> 00:16:40,160
Or even if you simply have a
positive first impression of it,

270
00:16:41,055 --> 00:16:43,103
you can usually tell if it's a match.

271
00:16:47,495 --> 00:16:48,460
Hyaa!

272
00:16:49,863 --> 00:16:51,897
Whoa, so cool!

273
00:16:52,195 --> 00:16:54,016
I promise you can do this.

274
00:16:54,434 --> 00:16:56,280
You can! I know you can!

275
00:16:58,214 --> 00:16:59,079
Okay, Bro.

276
00:17:00,508 --> 00:17:00,987
Heh.

277
00:17:07,036 --> 00:17:09,810
There's no one in the world I respect more than you.

278
00:17:11,222 --> 00:17:14,888
So if you say I can do it then
there's no way in hell I'll let you down!

279
00:17:14,988 --> 00:17:16,488
Ahh, seriously.

280
00:17:16,588 --> 00:17:18,222
So you're really gonna put it on?

281
00:17:18,682 --> 00:17:21,663
Guess I better hurry if I wanna kill you myself.

282
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:23,263
Time to die!

283
00:17:24,374 --> 00:17:28,385
Let go and scream, Tatsumi!
With all the fire in your soul!

284
00:17:32,388 --> 00:17:36,632
Incursio!

285
00:17:42,163 --> 00:17:43,066
Amazing...

286
00:17:43,434 --> 00:17:46,496
The armor's changing its shape to fit Tatsumi's physique!

287
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:51,381
Where'd that thing come from?!

288
00:17:51,961 --> 00:17:54,938
That armor... are all the materials still alive?!

289
00:17:55,625 --> 00:18:00,712
Incursio was created from parts of a living
dragon-type Danger Beast known as "Tyrant."

290
00:18:01,298 --> 00:18:03,331
Its vitality is immensely high.

291
00:18:04,508 --> 00:18:07,901
It can also adapt its body to
survive in any type of environment,

292
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:11,217
from burning deserts to the frozen tundra!

293
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:16,806
Even after becoming an Imperial Arms, the
dragon's flesh is still alive to this day!

294
00:18:17,167 --> 00:18:19,730
Such a... such a terrifying weapon!

295
00:18:21,745 --> 00:18:26,388
Tatsumi, your emotions are causing it to evolve.

296
00:18:26,489 --> 00:18:28,912
Incursio's bonding with you!

297
00:18:33,193 --> 00:18:36,815
Esdeath's army committed
Murder-after-murder using Night Raid's name!

298
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:39,655
Now it's time for you to pay!

299
00:18:40,348 --> 00:18:43,898
Yeah? You must think you're
pretty special now, don't you?!

300
00:18:44,988 --> 00:18:46,072
I can feel it...

301
00:18:46,887 --> 00:18:49,882
this armor is making my body grow stronger.

302
00:18:52,618 --> 00:18:54,446
I'm about to finish this!

303
00:18:55,481 --> 00:18:56,790
Ahhh!

304
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,451
I dare you to try!

305
00:19:13,121 --> 00:19:14,130
Aaah!

306
00:19:30,372 --> 00:19:32,278
Ha, whaddya know?

307
00:19:32,918 --> 00:19:35,104
If that's how strong you are right here and now,

308
00:19:35,419 --> 00:19:37,514
then there's not a single doubt in my mind.

309
00:19:38,071 --> 00:19:40,613
One of these days you will surpass me.

310
00:19:40,645 --> 00:19:42,560
Ugh... Uhh...

311
00:19:44,205 --> 00:19:46,207
Go as far as you can, Tatsumi.

312
00:19:47,022 --> 00:19:49,255
I'll be watching over you.

313
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,198
I won, Bro...

314
00:20:10,286 --> 00:20:11,610
I won because of you.

315
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:16,695
I'm sorry for that little part at the end...

316
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:19,305
when I made you punch some sense into me.

317
00:20:20,117 --> 00:20:22,360
I swear, I'll get strong.

318
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,746
I promise, I'll master Incursio and make you proud.

319
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,607
So, just for now...

320
00:20:32,471 --> 00:20:35,357
Is it okay if I cry for you?

321
00:20:36,937 --> 00:20:37,951
Okay, Bro...?

322
00:20:54,780 --> 00:21:03,398
La la la...

323
00:21:03,766 --> 00:21:04,398
Hehe...

324
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:08,596
Human bodies, they're so amusing. Hehe...

325
00:21:08,889 --> 00:21:12,565
The only way to pluck out the weeds of
rebellion is pull directly from the roots.

326
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:15,924
Sending supplies to a foreign tribe is a serious crime.

327
00:21:15,967 --> 00:21:17,515
We did what needed to be done.

328
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:21,978
Kurome, I have a message for you!

329
00:21:22,378 --> 00:21:24,180
You're needed in the Imperial Capital.

330
00:21:24,691 --> 00:21:25,200
Huh?

331
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,310
They only ask for me?

332
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:31,919
That's right. Apparently you've been personally
selected to be part of a new group of six.

333
00:21:32,019 --> 00:21:33,195
Group of six.

334
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,817
I heard that they were planning on forming a new unit.

335
00:21:36,258 --> 00:21:37,158
Hmmm...

336
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,435
The Capital, huh?

337
00:21:43,996 --> 00:21:46,371
Maybe I'll get to see you again after all...

338
00:21:49,198 --> 00:21:51,805
Big Sister.
