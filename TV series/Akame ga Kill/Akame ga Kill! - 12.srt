1
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,307
Whooo, alright!!

2
00:00:06,407 --> 00:00:07,574
This feels awesome!

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:12,597
Hahaha... You're so innocent I can't
believe you're a killer, Tatsumi. It's funny.

4
00:00:13,074 --> 00:00:14,374
I'd never expect that!

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,578
Wow! This is even more of a blast than I thought!

6
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:21,366
Yeah. The view is really something. This is nice.

7
00:00:22,006 --> 00:00:24,029
This isn't nice at all!

8
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,420
The Marg Highlands are crawling with Danger Beasts,

9
00:02:04,913 --> 00:02:07,513
which makes it impossible for humans to live here.

10
00:02:08,627 --> 00:02:11,360
And that's why it's a perfect
place to build our new hideout.

11
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,482
The Revolutionary Army's recon unit is currently searching
for a more permanent place for us near the capital,

12
00:02:17,507 --> 00:02:18,840
but they haven't found anything.

13
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:22,721
So until we hear from them we'll just
stay right here and level ourselves up.

14
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,322
Hey, look!

15
00:02:27,473 --> 00:02:29,263
It's leaving; Should we try to catch it?

16
00:02:29,422 --> 00:02:32,102
It's going back to its nest at HQ, silly!

17
00:02:32,127 --> 00:02:35,148
Well, Mine, I'm surprised you
weren't smart enough to figure that out.

18
00:02:35,173 --> 00:02:36,950
Hahaha...

19
00:02:36,975 --> 00:02:39,222
Oh great. I hate you already!

20
00:02:39,523 --> 00:02:42,864
Oh yes, I haven't given our
new members a proper introduction.

21
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:44,530
I'd like you to meet-Huh?

22
00:02:46,827 --> 00:02:50,719
I already knew you were cute, but
you're adorable from up close, Akame!

23
00:02:50,744 --> 00:02:52,123
Why are you touching me?

24
00:02:52,749 --> 00:02:54,449
Oh, yes, my name's Chelsea.

25
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:57,469
Since we're going to be killing
people together, I hope we all get along.

26
00:02:57,603 --> 00:02:59,042
Here! This is for you.

27
00:02:59,069 --> 00:02:59,609
Oh!

28
00:03:00,662 --> 00:03:01,907
Welcome to the team.

29
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:04,275
Did she just win Akame's heart with a lollipop?!

30
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,562
That long flight must have made her really hungry!

31
00:03:07,143 --> 00:03:11,944
You know, Chelsea seems even less likely to be a
cold-blooded assassin than Mine and the others girls do.

32
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:13,769
Don't judge a book by its cover.

33
00:03:13,976 --> 00:03:17,862
She's an expert killer who's
completed just as many jobs as Akame.

34
00:03:17,887 --> 00:03:18,449
Eh?

35
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,610
As for this fellow, headquarters
has entrusted him with me as well.

36
00:03:22,696 --> 00:03:25,360
Everyone meet the Lightning Fast Susanoo,

37
00:03:25,385 --> 00:03:27,469
he's my new Imperial Arms.

38
00:03:27,576 --> 00:03:31,074
Organic types are mostly autonomous,
so he shouldn't be all that draining.

39
00:03:31,183 --> 00:03:33,567
Even with all my injuries I can still use him.

40
00:03:33,862 --> 00:03:36,068
Uh... Hi, I think we met earlier.

41
00:03:36,093 --> 00:03:36,681
Ah!

42
00:03:38,906 --> 00:03:40,249
Uh, hey now...

43
00:03:42,955 --> 00:03:43,822
Fixed!

44
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:45,461
I should warn you,

45
00:03:45,486 --> 00:03:46,952
he's a bit of a neat freak.

46
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,162
Yeah, no kidding...

47
00:03:49,797 --> 00:03:51,999
Well now I get why he fixed my hair before.

48
00:03:52,762 --> 00:03:55,665
Okay. So, what exactly is his primary ability?

49
00:03:55,856 --> 00:03:57,789
Does he only do hand-to-hand combat?

50
00:03:58,896 --> 00:04:00,183
Hehe...

51
00:04:00,817 --> 00:04:02,783
Allow me to demonstrate that for you.

52
00:04:03,036 --> 00:04:04,660
Try to contain your excitement.

53
00:04:05,223 --> 00:04:06,972
Susanoo, proceed!

54
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,172
Understood.

55
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:27,108
Okay I admit, that does look impressive, but...

56
00:04:27,436 --> 00:04:28,368
what is he doing?

57
00:04:28,596 --> 00:04:31,283
From where I'm standing it looks like... chores.

58
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:32,918
Wonderful, isn't he?!

59
00:04:33,256 --> 00:04:37,339
Susanoo's original purpose was to
protect royalty and others of status.

60
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,123
Not only can he fight,

61
00:04:39,148 --> 00:04:44,037
he's equipped with a full range of cleaning and
cooking skills so he never has to leave his owner's side!

62
00:04:44,062 --> 00:04:45,450
He can do it all!

63
00:04:45,929 --> 00:04:49,296
And the best part is, his menu
includes a thousand different dishes!

64
00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:51,565
How is any of that gonna help us in a fight?!

65
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:54,160
Now, now, I'm sure you'll come to appreciate it.

66
00:04:54,329 --> 00:04:58,010
Last but not least... he also
possesses a trump card for combat.

67
00:04:58,035 --> 00:04:58,837
Don't you?

68
00:04:59,043 --> 00:04:59,697
Yeah.

69
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:05,926
So these are my two new teammates, huh?

70
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,039
They seem pretty reliable.

71
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,902
Oh my goodness, you're flat as a board, aren't you?

72
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:15,349
Y'know, you may be all big and
handsome and strong and everything,

73
00:05:15,462 --> 00:05:17,776
but you're still just a glorified man-maid!

74
00:05:18,377 --> 00:05:20,073
Hope our teamwork isn't gonna suffer.

75
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:31,614
We've finished searching the doctor's residence.

76
00:05:32,003 --> 00:05:37,325
However, we were unable to find any evidence
as to what caused his sudden disappearance.

77
00:05:37,742 --> 00:05:43,434
We did notice none of his valuable research materials
or equipment went missing from the laboratory, though.

78
00:05:43,797 --> 00:05:45,543
If he hasn't deserted us,

79
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,244
that means he must have been killed.

80
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,667
And none of his enhanced soldiers
were anywhere to be found either.

81
00:05:53,016 --> 00:05:55,633
I can only assume they were all killed as well.

82
00:05:56,736 --> 00:05:57,896
I understand.

83
00:05:58,887 --> 00:06:02,138
Poor Seryu's lost another person she looked up to.

84
00:06:05,485 --> 00:06:08,858
Are you going to be able to handle your
maintenance without the doctor's help?

85
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:10,711
I think I'll be alright!

86
00:06:10,749 --> 00:06:13,490
He did leave all the materials I need in the laboratory.

87
00:06:13,885 --> 00:06:16,160
I can't make any improvements to my equipment,

88
00:06:16,185 --> 00:06:18,085
but I can keep them in working order!

89
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:18,940
That's good.

90
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:29,286
So, Seryu, tell me how Judgement-of-the-Ten-Kings
and your other new weapons have been working for you.

91
00:06:29,311 --> 00:06:31,744
Great! I'm really enjoying them, Doctor!

92
00:06:31,855 --> 00:06:35,233
I'm quite impressed with how well
your body handled the experiment.

93
00:06:35,258 --> 00:06:38,517
Now use all that newfound power
to make your dreams come true.

94
00:06:39,278 --> 00:06:41,453
And I'll be right here to fix you if you get a boo boo.

95
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:42,345
Ha...

96
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:43,859
Okay!

97
00:06:51,136 --> 00:06:52,057
My parents...

98
00:06:52,349 --> 00:06:53,449
Captain Ogre...

99
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:54,760
and the Doctor.

100
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:57,626
Everyone I care about gets killed...

101
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,663
and always by the same filth!

102
00:07:02,602 --> 00:07:03,577
Seryu.

103
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:05,631
Commander... I...

104
00:07:06,096 --> 00:07:07,823
I can't take it anymore!

105
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:09,352
All I want...

106
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,712
is to slaughter them all as soon as possible!

107
00:07:19,336 --> 00:07:21,169
If you'll stay with me, Seryu,

108
00:07:21,362 --> 00:07:23,552
I promise I will fulfill that wish.

109
00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:25,582
You can count on it.

110
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,504
Thank you!

111
00:07:29,596 --> 00:07:30,998
I swear, Commander...

112
00:07:31,762 --> 00:07:35,840
I will dedicate everything I have to you, and to justice.

113
00:07:36,517 --> 00:07:37,637
I know you will.

114
00:07:41,113 --> 00:07:45,076
Here we go! I'm gonna find Seryu
and put a great big smile on her face!

115
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,233
And what makes you so sure you can do that?

116
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:49,112
It's something my mom told me one time.

117
00:07:49,212 --> 00:07:53,499
If a girl's ever crying or acting upset
it's a man's job to make her feel better again!

118
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,213
Mm... Hmmm...

119
00:07:56,313 --> 00:07:58,180
And this is one of those times.

120
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,619
Seryu, lay your troubles on me!

121
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:06,017
Ehh... haha...

122
00:08:07,313 --> 00:08:07,816
Uh...

123
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,037
It looks like the Empire is gradually
beginning to build up its forces.

124
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,913
And there's no way we can win as we are now.

125
00:08:16,394 --> 00:08:18,114
We have to make ourselves stronger.

126
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:20,113
Revolution Day is almost here.

127
00:08:20,213 --> 00:08:22,678
Let's use what little time we have left for training.

128
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:26,304
I also wouldn't count on getting
any more new fighters if I were you.

129
00:08:26,484 --> 00:08:29,861
Please consider this the last
time we receive reinforcements.

130
00:08:30,214 --> 00:08:31,636
If we work as a team,

131
00:08:31,701 --> 00:08:34,375
we can all survive to see the coming of the new world!

132
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:35,310
Hm.

133
00:08:44,359 --> 00:08:45,745
Ah, got one!

134
00:08:47,718 --> 00:08:48,291
Huh?

135
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:52,431
Much better.

136
00:08:54,853 --> 00:08:57,897
It's gonna be a huge feast tonight! I can't wait!

137
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,259
Phew!

138
00:09:01,036 --> 00:09:05,439
Ah man, that was delicious and hit the
spot, Su! I feel like I can take on the world!

139
00:09:05,464 --> 00:09:06,617
Thank you for all your help.

140
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:09,947
Hey, Su, so you think we could train together tomorrow?

141
00:09:10,267 --> 00:09:13,909
Hmm. I knew you'd come around
once you saw how handy he can be.

142
00:09:13,934 --> 00:09:18,109
It is pretty cool that the guys back at Headquarters
would let you borrow such an awesome weapon.

143
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:21,679
They said Susanoo had been in
hibernation for quite some time.

144
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:24,380
He felt my presence, and activated immediately.

145
00:09:24,907 --> 00:09:26,049
That's really cool.

146
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:28,657
Oh, it's easy to see why.

147
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,709
My feminine charm, of course.

148
00:09:32,523 --> 00:09:35,872
Actually the General is like a
spitting image of my previous master.

149
00:09:35,897 --> 00:09:36,987
That makes sense.

150
00:09:37,012 --> 00:09:40,001
If she was like me, then she
must have been a wonderful person.

151
00:09:40,127 --> 00:09:40,766
Yeah.

152
00:09:41,573 --> 00:09:44,080
Not only a great leader, but also a good man!

153
00:09:44,112 --> 00:09:45,112
A man?!

154
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:45,701
Gah...

155
00:09:46,354 --> 00:09:47,826
Hahaha...

156
00:09:47,851 --> 00:09:51,216
See, Boss, you totally look like a dude!
That's probably why you're such a stud!

157
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:52,769
Cut it out, if you make her mad
she's gonna freak out and kill us...

158
00:09:55,147 --> 00:09:57,221
Oh! Uh... Yeah sorry.

159
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,777
Uh-oh...

160
00:10:01,396 --> 00:10:03,460
Oww...

161
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,743
Jeez, I don't get why everybody's
so quick to cozy up to that guy.

162
00:10:07,035 --> 00:10:09,409
I thought I was the Mr. Suave Awesome around here.

163
00:10:09,434 --> 00:10:13,068
Don't worry, Lubb, I'm pretty sure no one
considered you "suave" in the first place.

164
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:16,780
Oh, wow.

165
00:10:17,131 --> 00:10:18,726
Is that a baby panther cub?

166
00:10:21,381 --> 00:10:23,926
They're surprisingly comfortable
around humans, aren't they?

167
00:10:26,253 --> 00:10:29,234
Hey now, I'm not gonna share
my food with you or anything so-.

168
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:30,491
Uhh...

169
00:10:31,152 --> 00:10:33,066
Okay... maybe just one bite.

170
00:10:34,024 --> 00:10:34,708
Whoa!

171
00:10:38,043 --> 00:10:38,926
Hehehe...

172
00:10:39,587 --> 00:10:41,746
What a perfect little snack!

173
00:10:41,771 --> 00:10:43,772
Whaa?! It's you?!

174
00:10:43,872 --> 00:10:49,059
Hehehe... Oh, Mine, you always make it
so easy I just can't help myself! Mmm...

175
00:10:49,084 --> 00:10:50,581
I hate you!

176
00:10:51,252 --> 00:10:52,824
So that was your Imperial Arms?

177
00:10:52,849 --> 00:10:56,351
It sure was! I can instantly
transform into anything I want!

178
00:10:57,417 --> 00:10:58,407
Pretty cool, right?

179
00:10:58,432 --> 00:11:01,298
Gaia Foundation, it's perfect for stealth operations.

180
00:11:01,678 --> 00:11:06,132
Which I must say Mine, if you're not more careful, you'll
be the next team member to get killed on the battlefield.

181
00:11:06,157 --> 00:11:09,656
Excuse me?! If the enemy finds out
about your weapon, then you're screwed!

182
00:11:09,681 --> 00:11:14,732
Admittedly. It is a cosmetic-type Imperial
Arms, so I can't do any real damage with it.

183
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:17,499
But that's what makes the art of deception so exciting!

184
00:11:17,571 --> 00:11:20,224
Like that look of surprise on your face a minute ago...

185
00:11:20,457 --> 00:11:21,737
Makes it all worth it.

186
00:11:22,095 --> 00:11:25,344
Ahhh! God I hate you!

187
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,346
Tatsumi, you take care of the little one!

188
00:11:40,526 --> 00:11:41,246
You got it!

189
00:11:42,938 --> 00:11:44,705
All their attacks do a lot of damage.

190
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,285
I need to study their movements...

191
00:11:46,659 --> 00:11:48,311
avoid taking any direct hits...

192
00:11:51,653 --> 00:11:53,123
and take 'em down!

193
00:11:55,199 --> 00:11:55,836
Uh!

194
00:11:59,466 --> 00:12:00,488
There it is.

195
00:12:02,011 --> 00:12:05,126
Incursio's hidden polearm, Neuntote!

196
00:12:07,118 --> 00:12:08,618
I don't know where it started...

197
00:12:08,643 --> 00:12:11,298
But Tatsumi's really started to pull his own weight!

198
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:12,286
Heh!

199
00:12:13,846 --> 00:12:16,438
He'll be right up there with Bulat one of these days.

200
00:12:17,726 --> 00:12:18,166
Guh!

201
00:12:24,218 --> 00:12:26,398
There's no end to these ugly little shits!

202
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,904
It's like they keep calling for backup or something.

203
00:12:29,427 --> 00:12:31,478
The leader's gotta be around here somewhere.

204
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:42,470
Hot damn!

205
00:12:58,598 --> 00:12:59,427
Nice try!

206
00:13:00,052 --> 00:13:02,136
I guess that must be your trump card!

207
00:13:02,161 --> 00:13:02,649
Huh?

208
00:13:11,633 --> 00:13:13,366
Ha! Didn't even break a sweat!

209
00:13:14,188 --> 00:13:18,575
Well done! You've proven you can easily
kill the Danger Beasts in this area.

210
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,334
I've noticed some of the different types like to attack us
out of nowhere, so we constantly have to be on our toes!

211
00:13:23,359 --> 00:13:25,667
I like it! That makes it so much more interesting!

212
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,773
The air's pretty thin up here.

213
00:13:28,033 --> 00:13:30,319
You've been training in such a harsh environment...

214
00:13:30,553 --> 00:13:32,922
I'm sure all of you have leveled up quite a bit!

215
00:13:33,129 --> 00:13:35,935
You're right! I can already feel a huge difference!

216
00:13:36,176 --> 00:13:36,971
Chelsea.

217
00:13:37,228 --> 00:13:37,708
Hm?

218
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:41,358
Tell me. What do you think of Night Raid
now that you've been with us for a month?

219
00:13:41,505 --> 00:13:43,361
Hm. You're all strong.

220
00:13:43,613 --> 00:13:46,536
In fact I would say you're even
stronger than anyone from my old team.

221
00:13:46,561 --> 00:13:47,362
Ha!

222
00:13:47,512 --> 00:13:49,535
Aw yeah! You got that right!

223
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,375
That said...

224
00:13:51,146 --> 00:13:53,907
Just because you're strong doesn't mean you'll survive.

225
00:13:54,326 --> 00:13:56,993
I took the liberty of looking
through all your old reports.

226
00:13:57,226 --> 00:14:00,619
Sheele and Bulat were both killed in a recent battle.

227
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,438
The issue at hand isn't whether
or not they were good people.

228
00:14:03,633 --> 00:14:06,224
It's that those two were obviously incompetent.

229
00:14:06,249 --> 00:14:06,857
Hmm!

230
00:14:06,886 --> 00:14:07,583
What?

231
00:14:07,785 --> 00:14:10,331
All I'm trying to say is, if you don't get it together,

232
00:14:10,871 --> 00:14:14,527
then you're not going to last long enough
to see this fight through to the end.

233
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,154
I swear...

234
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,351
That girl pisses me off so much!

235
00:14:18,376 --> 00:14:21,594
Well, that's Chelsea for you;
She's as honest as they come.

236
00:14:22,885 --> 00:14:24,123
We should eat something.

237
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:27,686
Let's go ahead and get a head-start
on cooking everything you hunted.

238
00:14:28,053 --> 00:14:29,681
Can't work on an empty stomach.

239
00:14:30,392 --> 00:14:32,649
There is something really wrong with you guys.

240
00:14:40,242 --> 00:14:42,529
So, what did you want to talk about, Mine?

241
00:14:43,061 --> 00:14:44,946
You know it had to make you mad.

242
00:14:44,971 --> 00:14:47,796
I can't believe what she said about Sheele and Bulat!

243
00:14:49,026 --> 00:14:50,166
Yeah, I understand.

244
00:14:50,738 --> 00:14:52,734
I don't like it when people disrespect Bro.

245
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,511
We need to do something to
her that'll really screw her up.

246
00:14:55,536 --> 00:14:59,039
Something that'll scare the crap out
of her or at least make her look stupid.

247
00:14:59,326 --> 00:15:03,721
Here it is. You get her off her guard, really
shake her up, then I'll come in and deal the final blow!

248
00:15:03,746 --> 00:15:05,093
It's total genius!

249
00:15:07,054 --> 00:15:10,204
Why do I feel like nothing good can
possibly come from teaming up with you?

250
00:15:10,229 --> 00:15:14,219
What do you mean?! Don't you dare tell me
that you're gonna take her side on this one?

251
00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:15,413
You know she deserves it!

252
00:15:15,438 --> 00:15:17,480
Okay, okay, fine, whatever you want.

253
00:15:17,712 --> 00:15:20,764
But wait, you never explained how
you wanted me to surprise Chelsea.

254
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:23,559
Well, you and Lubb will have to
figure something out, won't you?

255
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,164
I've got my own brilliant revenge to prepare.

256
00:15:27,547 --> 00:15:30,041
So get busy, this mission should be completed tonight!

257
00:15:30,066 --> 00:15:32,047
And I'd better hear her scream too!

258
00:15:33,619 --> 00:15:35,042
I don't think I like her tone.

259
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,280
Hmm... Something that'll make Chelsea scream...

260
00:15:39,513 --> 00:15:40,873
I got nothin' over here.

261
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,819
If only we could use our Imperial Arms to startle people-.

262
00:15:44,593 --> 00:15:46,926
OH! I think I just had an idea!

263
00:15:46,951 --> 00:15:48,206
And it was a GOOD idea!

264
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,999
Whoaaa!

265
00:16:02,811 --> 00:16:05,257
Never thought I'd use Incursio for this.

266
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,413
Listen up! It's almost time for Chelsea to take a bath,

267
00:16:08,485 --> 00:16:09,527
so make sure you're ready!

268
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:13,290
You just need to go invisible and
sneak into the hot spring from the back.

269
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:17,678
As soon as you can get close enough... all you have
to do is grab the wash bucket and dump it over her head!

270
00:16:17,946 --> 00:16:20,979
She's totally gonna freak out, it'll be great! I promise.

271
00:16:21,004 --> 00:16:21,732
Hmm...

272
00:16:22,999 --> 00:16:25,013
Are you sure this is a good idea?

273
00:16:25,038 --> 00:16:29,208
Come on! Mine's practically forcing us
to do it, so we have the perfect excuse!

274
00:16:29,648 --> 00:16:31,469
It's a once-in-a-lifetime chance!

275
00:16:31,876 --> 00:16:33,616
Well, okay...

276
00:16:34,722 --> 00:16:36,192
But I can't let you come with me.

277
00:16:36,373 --> 00:16:37,807
You understand, right, Lubb?

278
00:16:38,358 --> 00:16:40,658
Hm... That's cool!

279
00:16:40,826 --> 00:16:42,169
I'll let you have the fun part!

280
00:16:42,492 --> 00:16:43,601
You're the best!

281
00:16:43,714 --> 00:16:49,921
This is perfect! Now I can gauge how mad Chelsea will get
at a peeping tom without having to get my own ass beat.

282
00:16:50,136 --> 00:16:53,539
If she lets him off the hook,
maybe I can get away with it too!

283
00:16:58,176 --> 00:16:59,983
I should just get this over with.

284
00:17:00,574 --> 00:17:03,418
Otherwise I could spend the
whole night just staring at her.

285
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,730
Okay. Maybe for a second.

286
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:16,499
Alright, let's do this.

287
00:17:32,806 --> 00:17:35,721
Ahhh! That's definitely a guy!

288
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:39,014
You can come out now. I know you're there.

289
00:17:41,619 --> 00:17:42,184
Uh!

290
00:17:43,232 --> 00:17:45,394
Su?! How'd you know?!

291
00:17:45,494 --> 00:17:48,562
Incursio can make you invisible, but that's all it does.

292
00:17:49,289 --> 00:17:51,679
You'll have to learn to hide your aura on your own.

293
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:52,103
Huh!

294
00:17:52,379 --> 00:17:54,783
Always bear that in mind when you fight.

295
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,009
If you forget, it's over.

296
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:01,727
Uh-huh.

297
00:18:02,641 --> 00:18:03,313
Huh.

298
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:05,490
You left yourself open!

299
00:18:06,087 --> 00:18:08,296
Huh?! Wha... What?!

300
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,821
Haha...

301
00:18:10,846 --> 00:18:13,186
Surprise ya? It was me the whole time!

302
00:18:13,211 --> 00:18:13,937
Ahh...

303
00:18:14,148 --> 00:18:17,616
Uh, you seriously need to work on
quelling that aura of yours, Tatsumi.

304
00:18:17,856 --> 00:18:20,641
The moment I sensed it, I knew
I could turn the tables on you.

305
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,681
Oh yeah, I guess that's why you were
sitting here waiting for me then, huh?

306
00:18:24,168 --> 00:18:25,186
You win this round!

307
00:18:25,211 --> 00:18:28,661
Hehe... Deception is my specialty, you know.

308
00:18:28,686 --> 00:18:31,603
To detect something like that
you'd need much more training.

309
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:35,037
I'm sorry, does it get on your nerves
when people tell you things like that?

310
00:18:35,821 --> 00:18:36,621
Not really.

311
00:18:36,705 --> 00:18:37,276
Hm?

312
00:18:37,847 --> 00:18:39,848
I understand what you're saying, Chelsea.

313
00:18:40,469 --> 00:18:42,686
There's still so many things I need to improve.

314
00:18:43,714 --> 00:18:45,427
I promise I'll take your advice to heart.

315
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,213
So, you're pretty mature, aren't you?

316
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,714
The truth is...

317
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:58,471
Not too long ago I came back from a mission
only to discover that everyone on my team

318
00:18:58,496 --> 00:19:00,227
had been murdered while I was gone.

319
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,979
I would be devastated if something like
that were to happen to the people here.

320
00:19:07,116 --> 00:19:09,662
All I'm trying to say is if you don't get it together

321
00:19:09,956 --> 00:19:13,572
then you're not going to last long
enough to see this fight through to the end.

322
00:19:14,752 --> 00:19:18,229
The only reason she said all that stuff
was because she was concerned about us.

323
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:20,913
Hmm...

324
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:22,816
How about that?

325
00:19:24,356 --> 00:19:26,871
You're a lot sweeter than I
thought you were when we first met.

326
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:27,451
Uhmm...

327
00:19:29,414 --> 00:19:30,849
How dare you say that to me!

328
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:34,273
Just looking out for my mental
well-being like anybody would!

329
00:19:34,672 --> 00:19:37,881
And the next time you try to sneak
a little peek at me when I'm naked...

330
00:19:38,727 --> 00:19:41,173
I won't hesitate to cut it off, is that clear?

331
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:45,292
Uh... did you say "cut it off"?!

332
00:19:45,432 --> 00:19:47,729
Cut what off?!

333
00:19:54,984 --> 00:19:55,684
Uh...

334
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:58,413
Hmm, Commander?

335
00:19:58,748 --> 00:19:59,246
Yeah?

336
00:19:59,842 --> 00:20:01,654
Is there anything troubling you?

337
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:06,061
Whenever there's a large crowd, I
find myself searching for Tatsumi.

338
00:20:07,242 --> 00:20:08,133
Actually...

339
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,990
If I may... I've compiled a list of eligible
bachelors who all bear some resemblance to that boy.

340
00:20:14,518 --> 00:20:17,251
If it pleases you, I could set up some meetings.

341
00:20:18,026 --> 00:20:20,159
There's no need to trouble yourself, Run.

342
00:20:21,013 --> 00:20:23,363
There can only be one Tatsumi, after all.

343
00:20:23,794 --> 00:20:25,791
No one else will ever come close.

344
00:20:26,464 --> 00:20:28,206
My humblest apologies.

345
00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:31,926
Hmm, this complicates things.

346
00:20:32,113 --> 00:20:35,866
I knew she was sadistic and that she's
tasked with the Minister's dirty work.

347
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:39,085
But she's even more powerful and depraved than I imagined.

348
00:20:39,745 --> 00:20:44,506
It should prove rather entertaining to
observe her up close for a little while.

349
00:20:47,631 --> 00:20:49,357
Why do I feel so anxious?

350
00:20:49,723 --> 00:20:52,470
Am I sensing that I'm about to see Tatsumi again?

351
00:20:53,816 --> 00:20:55,043
Or is it because...

352
00:20:56,211 --> 00:21:00,181
because the final battle against
Night Raid is drawing near.

353
00:21:05,324 --> 00:21:09,260
Or perhaps, it's something else altogether!

354
00:21:25,746 --> 00:21:28,134
Ahh! It's some new kind of Danger Beast!

355
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,088
Run!

356
00:21:29,113 --> 00:21:30,874
Ahh!

357
00:21:37,314 --> 00:21:38,447
Ahh!

358
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:44,530
Hehehe...

359
00:21:44,889 --> 00:21:48,904
Looks like I got my hands on a fun little new toy!

360
00:21:49,362 --> 00:21:52,399
Y'know, I haven't been to the Capital in ages...

361
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:54,748
Should be a wonderful time.
