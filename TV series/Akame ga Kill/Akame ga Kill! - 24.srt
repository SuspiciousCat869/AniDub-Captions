1
00:00:08,781 --> 00:00:11,047
Tatsumi died because he was weak.

2
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:13,350
It's as simple as that.

3
00:00:14,861 --> 00:00:17,927
So then... why... does it hurt?

4
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,190
It's Esdeath!

5
00:00:21,304 --> 00:00:22,305
She's the last of them!

6
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:23,192
Get her!

7
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:26,007
The Empire is weak as well...

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,857
No, don't!

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,392
It must be terminated!

10
00:00:42,228 --> 00:00:42,791
Uh?

11
00:00:48,687 --> 00:00:49,473
Akame.

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,819
Looks like you lose, Esdeath.

13
00:00:51,862 --> 00:00:53,672
No, the Empire lost.

14
00:00:54,098 --> 00:00:57,131
Regardless, my expedition is far from finished.

15
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,084
Expedition?

16
00:00:58,644 --> 00:01:00,434
But the war is already over!

17
00:01:00,754 --> 00:01:02,960
There will always be another war.

18
00:01:03,523 --> 00:01:05,924
If I have to, I'll start one myself.

19
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:08,492
This world is poised on the brink of peace.

20
00:01:08,892 --> 00:01:10,548
And that's exactly the reason...

21
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:12,557
I cannot let you stay alive!

22
00:01:12,798 --> 00:01:14,646
Oh spare me the drama.

23
00:01:14,846 --> 00:01:18,460
If you want to oppose me...
then show me how much you want it!

24
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:24,751
Esdeath, you truly are the
final obstacle to this revolution.

25
00:01:26,173 --> 00:01:28,344
Akame! Annihilate her!

26
00:01:29,674 --> 00:01:30,555
You're dead.

27
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,134
We'll see about that!

28
00:03:29,765 --> 00:03:31,127
Now freeze!

29
00:03:55,821 --> 00:03:57,971
Now I see where you get your reputation.

30
00:03:58,471 --> 00:03:59,593
Very good!

31
00:03:59,982 --> 00:04:00,912
Esdeath.

32
00:04:01,496 --> 00:04:04,849
What is it you'll gain from executing more people?

33
00:04:05,407 --> 00:04:07,128
In the end, what will be left?

34
00:04:07,153 --> 00:04:08,896
The victors, of course.

35
00:04:08,988 --> 00:04:12,449
You mean murderers standing on
top of a mountain of dead bodies.

36
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:15,201
Am I supposed to feel remorseful or excited?

37
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:19,967
If you're not ready to die, then
surrender and accept your subordination now.

38
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:20,927
Never.

39
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,453
Those who can't win must perish.

40
00:04:23,728 --> 00:04:26,183
That's the way the world operates, isn't it?

41
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:26,847
No!

42
00:04:27,093 --> 00:04:28,622
Everyone wants to live.

43
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:30,705
The ones who died wanted to live too!

44
00:04:38,413 --> 00:04:41,954
No one should ever have the right to
take the life of another human being!

45
00:04:42,061 --> 00:04:45,820
A rather silly thing to say coming
from an assassin, don't you think!

46
00:04:54,533 --> 00:04:55,441
Finish her.

47
00:05:23,121 --> 00:05:24,279
What's the matter?

48
00:05:24,385 --> 00:05:25,648
Have you had enough?

49
00:05:26,461 --> 00:05:29,122
If you're weak, then don't challenge me.

50
00:05:29,618 --> 00:05:32,479
And if you don't believe you can win, don't try.

51
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:35,998
Swine should grovel in the dirt
like the filthy livestock they are.

52
00:05:36,038 --> 00:05:38,828
Livestock? Is that all people are to you?

53
00:05:38,853 --> 00:05:41,521
I cannot concern myself with the weak!

54
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:55,960
Well? Ready to get serious yet?

55
00:06:48,394 --> 00:06:51,635
Oh! This must be your trump card.

56
00:06:51,714 --> 00:06:54,188
I've murdered a lot of people in my life.

57
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,991
Their grief... their sorrow...

58
00:06:57,317 --> 00:06:59,297
anger... hatred.

59
00:06:59,991 --> 00:07:01,704
Everyone I've ever killed...

60
00:07:02,472 --> 00:07:04,650
Murasame remembers them all.

61
00:07:08,626 --> 00:07:11,741
I'll take the full weight of that guilt upon myself!

62
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:14,588
I'm quite impressed!

63
00:07:14,873 --> 00:07:17,066
You've cast off your human skin!

64
00:07:17,306 --> 00:07:20,039
What a fitting perk for a demon sword.

65
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,711
Even if it kills me... I'll end you...

66
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:24,922
now!

67
00:08:32,493 --> 00:08:33,581
How about that?

68
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,416
Now it's getting fun!

69
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:39,411
I can't remember the last time
a fight gave me such a rush!

70
00:08:40,793 --> 00:08:44,811
Alright! It'll be even better when I tear you to pieces!

71
00:09:20,837 --> 00:09:23,275
I don't think I can keep this up for much longer...

72
00:09:24,028 --> 00:09:24,708
Right...

73
00:09:25,496 --> 00:09:26,706
it's now or never!

74
00:09:27,221 --> 00:09:30,509
Prepare yourself to face the full might of my power.

75
00:09:31,134 --> 00:09:31,709
Come!

76
00:09:59,372 --> 00:10:01,042
Mahapadma!

77
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:09,246
This is the first time I've
ever had to re-use my trump card.

78
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,079
You've done well.

79
00:10:11,434 --> 00:10:13,263
This has been so much fun.

80
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:16,186
An afterimage?!

81
00:10:20,234 --> 00:10:21,512
Where did she go?

82
00:10:24,806 --> 00:10:25,502
You're done!

83
00:10:35,745 --> 00:10:39,406
But how... did you see through Mahapadma?!

84
00:10:39,946 --> 00:10:43,161
I knew you would try the same
attack you used to beat Susanoo.

85
00:10:44,151 --> 00:10:46,631
After that, it was all just a matter of timing.

86
00:10:47,034 --> 00:10:48,467
How could you know that?!

87
00:10:48,886 --> 00:10:52,067
The afterimage you saw... that was your bloodlust.

88
00:10:52,549 --> 00:10:56,255
I used your pride and your
desperate need-to-kill against you.

89
00:11:01,934 --> 00:11:03,910
Mission complete.

90
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:13,876
You really are something, aren't you?

91
00:11:14,296 --> 00:11:16,539
Where's all that strength of yours come from?

92
00:11:16,646 --> 00:11:19,349
The burden I carry is extremely heavy.

93
00:11:19,894 --> 00:11:22,086
And because of it, I've become stronger.

94
00:11:22,859 --> 00:11:27,374
Do you intend to drag all those souls
around with you for the rest of your life?

95
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,536
I do.

96
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,349
Well... that sounds foolish...

97
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,988
In any case, you've bested me.

98
00:11:46,385 --> 00:11:47,574
It's over now.

99
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,000
Huh? Tatsumi!

100
00:11:53,229 --> 00:11:53,833
Esdeath!

101
00:12:03,143 --> 00:12:03,996
Tatsumi...

102
00:12:04,461 --> 00:12:08,498
from the moment I laid eyes on you,
all I wanted was for us to be together.

103
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,590
You really were in love with him...

104
00:12:26,763 --> 00:12:29,638
and that was the very thing you just couldn't understand.

105
00:12:37,736 --> 00:12:38,578
Commander...

106
00:12:39,603 --> 00:12:40,690
Rest in peace.

107
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:55,738
As expected, the wisest man finds his way in the end!

108
00:12:56,138 --> 00:12:59,837
Now I'll just silently sneak away somewhere safe...

109
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,265
And put all of this mess behind me!

110
00:13:02,558 --> 00:13:03,005
Huh?!

111
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,269
There you are!

112
00:13:04,872 --> 00:13:10,214
If you think I'm gonna let the nastiest shit-bag
in the Empire get away, you're sorely mistaken.

113
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:12,612
Somebody help me! Anyone, please!

114
00:13:12,637 --> 00:13:15,774
You think you're so freakin' smart, don'tcha?

115
00:13:15,884 --> 00:13:17,999
You think you can just sneak off huh?!

116
00:13:18,024 --> 00:13:19,116
Stay away!

117
00:13:21,432 --> 00:13:23,057
Uh... What the...

118
00:13:24,591 --> 00:13:25,172
Huh?!

119
00:13:27,005 --> 00:13:27,740
Oh no...

120
00:13:31,885 --> 00:13:33,397
Poor girl!

121
00:13:33,422 --> 00:13:36,504
Surprised by the power of my Imperial Arms?

122
00:13:36,637 --> 00:13:40,669
It's important to keep your trump card a secret, isn't it?

123
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:46,091
The penalty for making me cower like a fool... is death!

124
00:13:46,151 --> 00:13:46,776
Uh!

125
00:13:48,653 --> 00:13:49,162
Ugh!

126
00:13:49,668 --> 00:13:52,824
I swear, if it's not the Emperor, it's someone else.

127
00:13:53,062 --> 00:13:56,573
Dealing with stupidity drains the life right out of me!

128
00:14:04,615 --> 00:14:07,695
Ow ow oh ow ow oh!

129
00:14:07,982 --> 00:14:11,456
Why... why... why are you doing this?!

130
00:14:11,516 --> 00:14:14,816
You'd be a killer too if you'd
grown up in the dump like I did!

131
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,302
But you wouldn't know about that, would you?!

132
00:14:17,346 --> 00:14:18,008
Haha!

133
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:19,483
Ugh!

134
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:33,269
Even if you did manage to break my Imperial Arms...

135
00:14:35,444 --> 00:14:37,889
The strength of my spirit is more than enough...

136
00:14:37,934 --> 00:14:39,353
Aghh!

137
00:14:39,406 --> 00:14:42,485
To send a bastard like you to Hell!

138
00:14:56,387 --> 00:14:59,258
Phew, glad that's outta my system.

139
00:15:00,313 --> 00:15:03,764
So I guess this means Night
Raid is pretty much finished, huh?

140
00:15:04,065 --> 00:15:04,632
Hm.

141
00:15:08,733 --> 00:15:10,440
Goodbye... my friend.

142
00:15:10,817 --> 00:15:11,271
Huh?

143
00:15:12,198 --> 00:15:14,479
Leone... don't tell me-.

144
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,341
Aw, don't gimme that look.

145
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,074
Think! I'll get to see everyone again.

146
00:15:20,192 --> 00:15:20,664
Uh...

147
00:15:22,144 --> 00:15:22,846
Hmm...

148
00:15:23,133 --> 00:15:25,105
There! There's that little smile.

149
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:26,812
Goodbye!

150
00:15:33,088 --> 00:15:35,401
Bye... Leone.

151
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:59,601
Cheers to the revolution!

152
00:15:59,778 --> 00:16:02,565
Finally get to kiss our lives of poverty goodbye!

153
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:05,778
Yeah! You'll never get rich if
you don't quit bein' a lazy bum!

154
00:16:05,803 --> 00:16:07,862
Hahaha! Got that right! Come on!

155
00:16:08,665 --> 00:16:10,319
Hey, Leone!

156
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,067
Wanna knock back a cold one with us?

157
00:16:13,229 --> 00:16:15,740
Over here, Gramps, Leone needs a mug!

158
00:16:16,244 --> 00:16:18,454
Leone, it's been too long since ya...

159
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:18,930
Huh?

160
00:16:19,965 --> 00:16:20,759
Where'd she go?

161
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:04,696
A beheading.

162
00:17:06,127 --> 00:17:07,641
That should settle it, right?

163
00:17:08,588 --> 00:17:09,174
Right.

164
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:15,488
Just when you think a fallen Emperor has nothing
left to do, there's one final task to be done.

165
00:17:15,675 --> 00:17:16,396
Yes.

166
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:18,369
If one gives-in to hysterics...

167
00:17:18,655 --> 00:17:20,595
then we make fools of ourselves.

168
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:23,685
The final duty... is die with pride.

169
00:17:36,325 --> 00:17:40,941
Please, create a peaceful land with no more bloodshed.

170
00:17:42,735 --> 00:17:43,901
You have my word.

171
00:17:44,422 --> 00:17:46,856
This is the last drop of blood to be spilled.

172
00:17:54,553 --> 00:17:58,117
Kurome, I'll do my best to help everyone in the new world.

173
00:17:58,575 --> 00:18:00,368
I'll help them to be safe and happy...

174
00:18:00,741 --> 00:18:02,114
I'll do it for both of us.

175
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,017
And I'll do my absolute best as
the new Minister of Home Affairs.

176
00:18:06,462 --> 00:18:08,581
This nation will finally be at peace.

177
00:18:10,575 --> 00:18:11,497
And, Commander?

178
00:18:12,188 --> 00:18:14,472
Feel free to share some of that courage with me.

179
00:18:15,393 --> 00:18:17,573
Do you think she's caught up with Tatsumi by now?

180
00:18:18,071 --> 00:18:21,348
Ha! I betcha he's still doing whatever he can to get away!

181
00:18:21,774 --> 00:18:22,710
Hehe...

182
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:24,916
Well, we should be going.

183
00:18:25,388 --> 00:18:27,759
There's plenty of work waiting for us when we get back.

184
00:18:38,405 --> 00:18:40,338
Why, this is more than we ever had before!

185
00:18:40,489 --> 00:18:45,588
I can't believe how much Tatsumi and the others have
been able to send us, it's changed everything around here.

186
00:18:45,828 --> 00:18:51,136
And now that things have settled back down, maybe Tatsumi,
Sayo, and Ieyasu would be able to come on back home again.

187
00:18:51,168 --> 00:18:51,823
Um-hmm.

188
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,365
They shall return as heroes.

189
00:18:54,871 --> 00:18:57,957
We'll welcome them home with a glorious celebration.

190
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:28,879
It's amazing what people can live through.

191
00:19:29,272 --> 00:19:30,976
They're already rebuilding the city.

192
00:19:31,722 --> 00:19:33,982
Boss... you're okay, right?

193
00:19:34,608 --> 00:19:35,268
Yeah.

194
00:19:35,854 --> 00:19:38,276
But I can't deny I've shortened my lifespan.

195
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:41,893
So there's no telling how much
longer my body will hold out.

196
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:47,737
I'll dedicate my final days to setting up the new nation.

197
00:19:48,946 --> 00:19:52,332
It's the least I can do for these
people as one of the survivors.

198
00:19:53,365 --> 00:19:55,389
If anyone can do it, it's you.

199
00:20:01,098 --> 00:20:02,958
You're planning on leaving, aren't you?

200
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:04,811
Yeah.

201
00:20:05,608 --> 00:20:09,458
If you want to blame me for all the
Revolutionary Army's despair, I don't mind.

202
00:20:10,217 --> 00:20:13,164
Sorry you got stuck with such an ugly role in this.

203
00:20:13,289 --> 00:20:16,858
I'm sure your new mission will be just as challenging.

204
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,555
We've lost many things along the way...

205
00:20:19,957 --> 00:20:21,981
but I'm still glad I fought with Night Raid.

206
00:20:22,349 --> 00:20:23,903
Thank you for inviting me...

207
00:20:25,195 --> 00:20:26,024
Najenda.

208
00:20:26,701 --> 00:20:27,268
Yeah.

209
00:20:28,735 --> 00:20:29,973
It has been an honor.

210
00:20:35,722 --> 00:20:36,448
Farewell.

211
00:20:39,381 --> 00:20:41,731
Good luck out there, Akame.

212
00:20:48,175 --> 00:20:49,382
Night Raid.

213
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:51,942
At the fall of the Empire,

214
00:20:52,048 --> 00:20:54,964
they were remembered as a violent gang of criminals

215
00:20:54,989 --> 00:20:56,662
who terrorized the Capital.

216
00:20:57,435 --> 00:20:59,655
However, as the new society grew,

217
00:20:59,976 --> 00:21:03,175
not a single mention of their existence could be found.

218
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:06,201
As long as there is human nature,

219
00:21:06,494 --> 00:21:08,860
so too must there be malice.

220
00:21:09,108 --> 00:21:10,838
As long as there is malice,

221
00:21:10,868 --> 00:21:13,004
so too must there be evil.

222
00:21:13,389 --> 00:21:15,883
Evil beyond salvation.

223
00:21:16,383 --> 00:21:18,355
For those who don't wield a sword,

224
00:21:18,508 --> 00:21:22,266
these vile demons are silenced in the darkness.

225
00:21:22,362 --> 00:21:25,984
By a group of elite assassins.

226
00:23:03,621 --> 00:23:05,674
Somehow, I made it through to the end.

227
00:23:07,073 --> 00:23:10,667
And gathered the weight of more
souls to carry for the rest of my life.

228
00:23:11,881 --> 00:23:12,355
Huh?

229
00:23:16,887 --> 00:23:18,371
Killing is all I know.

230
00:23:19,096 --> 00:23:20,081
But I believe...

231
00:23:20,801 --> 00:23:23,645
I believe I can find my way to a new future.

232
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,473
I'm certain of it.

233
00:23:27,146 --> 00:23:29,305
So no matter where that future leads,

234
00:23:29,592 --> 00:23:33,222
I will follow this path to my destiny.

235
00:23:34,967 --> 00:23:35,953
You're done!
