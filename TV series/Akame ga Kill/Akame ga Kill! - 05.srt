1
00:00:08,632 --> 00:00:09,265
Wait...

2
00:00:10,893 --> 00:00:13,897
Sorry. It's time for us to be moving on, Tatsumi.

3
00:00:14,176 --> 00:00:15,814
The two of us will be going this way.

4
00:00:15,981 --> 00:00:17,520
And you should head back, okay?

5
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:19,249
But how could you say that?

6
00:00:19,508 --> 00:00:21,179
We've always stuck together right?

7
00:00:21,204 --> 00:00:23,903
You've got yourself a new group
of friends to look out for you.

8
00:00:24,243 --> 00:00:27,143
C'mon, Tatsumi, we can't keep babying you forever!

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,746
Take care, man.

10
00:00:29,604 --> 00:00:32,630
If there is an afterlife, I'm sure we'll meet again.

11
00:00:33,394 --> 00:00:34,451
No! Wait up!

12
00:00:34,611 --> 00:00:35,595
Don't go!

13
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,533
Please!

14
00:00:36,846 --> 00:00:38,215
Don't leave me here alone!

15
00:00:52,294 --> 00:00:53,947
What a terrible dream...

16
00:00:58,021 --> 00:00:59,522
What's she doing here?

17
00:01:03,771 --> 00:01:06,175
Today, you'll be training under me, Tatsumi.

18
00:01:06,721 --> 00:01:08,314
I look forward to working with you.

19
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,729
I guess now it's her turn.

20
00:01:10,802 --> 00:01:11,924
Okay, then...

21
00:01:18,774 --> 00:01:20,404
Good morning, friend.

22
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,282
Where are my glasses?!

23
00:01:28,164 --> 00:01:28,570
Oh!

24
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,149
Let's try this again, shall we?

25
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,127
Are you sure it's okay to leave Sheele in charge of him?

26
00:03:17,247 --> 00:03:18,491
Oh, they'll be all right.

27
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:21,305
I am positive Sheele will take a liking to him.

28
00:03:21,405 --> 00:03:22,610
So, what makes you say that?

29
00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:25,045
Tatsumi's quite popular with older women.

30
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:28,279
Yep! That's why I call dibs on being his trainer next!

31
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:30,003
See? He's a natural talent.

32
00:03:30,028 --> 00:03:33,201
Ah, dammit, that is such bullcraaaap!

33
00:03:33,301 --> 00:03:36,769
You may go so far as to say he's a lady killer.

34
00:03:38,128 --> 00:03:39,127
Y'get it right?

35
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:41,031
Because he's an assassin?

36
00:03:45,128 --> 00:03:47,112
Oh well, maybe next time.

37
00:03:47,698 --> 00:03:49,025
So then about lunch...

38
00:03:49,119 --> 00:03:51,721
I was thinking that I might make some mapo beef bowls.

39
00:03:51,944 --> 00:03:55,142
Well, I'd prefer if you decide
between mapo tofu and beef...

40
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,094
Sounds good!

41
00:03:57,393 --> 00:04:00,039
And I'll top it off with a little fried chicken, okay?

42
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,620
Fried chicken, too?!

43
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,955
Don't you think that's a little bit much...

44
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,249
Sounds good!

45
00:04:05,493 --> 00:04:07,288
Where the heck do they put it all?

46
00:04:16,716 --> 00:04:19,309
Congratulations, you learned how to swim in armor!

47
00:04:22,526 --> 00:04:25,177
So heavy... Man, that was really hard!

48
00:04:25,443 --> 00:04:29,004
It's a requirement as part of our
"How to Train Assassins" curriculum.

49
00:04:29,592 --> 00:04:34,405
I don't really do any chores or anything, so I
kinda specialize in training new recruits like you.

50
00:04:34,624 --> 00:04:36,642
So why don't you do any chores?

51
00:04:38,788 --> 00:04:40,036
I tried to cook...

52
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,795
but I burned the meat, which made Akame a little upset.

53
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,882
Not the meat...

54
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:50,067
And I caused trouble for Bulat when I tried to clean...

55
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,077
Just let me do it.

56
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:58,145
And Leone laughed at me when I went
shopping and bought sugar instead of salt.

57
00:05:00,935 --> 00:05:02,573
Why'd you buy so much?

58
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,867
We tried laundry...

59
00:05:05,198 --> 00:05:08,913
but I sorta ended up washing Mine
along with all of the dirty clothes.

60
00:05:08,952 --> 00:05:10,521
Aww, don't feel too bad.

61
00:05:10,753 --> 00:05:12,585
Yesss! Great job!

62
00:05:12,924 --> 00:05:14,311
Oh, hey, I just realized.

63
00:05:14,457 --> 00:05:14,984
Huh?

64
00:05:15,564 --> 00:05:16,939
When I first met the team,

65
00:05:17,148 --> 00:05:18,574
you were the only one who wasn't there.

66
00:05:20,177 --> 00:05:24,492
Um... I'm sure there was a reason, but I don't remember.

67
00:05:25,194 --> 00:05:26,753
I'm such an airhead.

68
00:05:27,131 --> 00:05:28,251
That's for sure.

69
00:05:28,565 --> 00:05:30,768
I really do apologize. Oh!

70
00:05:31,462 --> 00:05:33,025
Aww, not again...

71
00:05:37,308 --> 00:05:39,674
So, how did you get into this line of work?

72
00:05:40,403 --> 00:05:41,020
Hmm?

73
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:45,726
Well, it's kind of a complicated story.

74
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:50,396
I grew up in one of the older
parts of the Imperial Capital.

75
00:05:56,485 --> 00:05:59,542
I've never been able to do anything right.

76
00:05:59,997 --> 00:06:02,743
I couldn't take pride in a single thing I did.

77
00:06:04,862 --> 00:06:07,939
People would always make mean comments about me...

78
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:11,144
Like... like, maybe I was crazy or something.

79
00:06:15,386 --> 00:06:16,654
But thankfully...

80
00:06:19,365 --> 00:06:23,477
I had a friend who was... very kind to me.

81
00:06:24,263 --> 00:06:30,026
No matter what happened or how badly I
messed up, she never once made fun of me.

82
00:06:30,436 --> 00:06:35,205
The time I spent with her was the
only ray of happiness in my entire life.

83
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,823
But it... it didn't last for long.

84
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:43,222
One day I was visiting her house, like I always did...

85
00:06:44,627 --> 00:06:46,483
when a man came to the door.

86
00:06:47,818 --> 00:06:49,711
He was her ex-boyfriend.

87
00:06:50,637 --> 00:06:54,123
He was furious and yelling and breaking things.

88
00:06:54,725 --> 00:06:56,978
Then he tried to strangle her.

89
00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:00,828
I think he was drunk or on something.

90
00:07:01,694 --> 00:07:04,656
My first thought was, "I need to save my friend!"

91
00:07:11,956 --> 00:07:13,995
I was surprisingly calm.

92
00:07:14,906 --> 00:07:17,174
I couldn't believe how quickly he died.

93
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:21,400
My friend was so scared she started shaking.

94
00:07:22,492 --> 00:07:25,590
But my head was completely clear.

95
00:07:27,831 --> 00:07:32,312
When it was all said and done, the events of
that night were written off as self-defense.

96
00:07:32,802 --> 00:07:35,357
But I never heard from my friend again after that.

97
00:07:36,928 --> 00:07:37,907
And then...

98
00:07:40,434 --> 00:07:43,740
A few days later, the man's friends came to get revenge.

99
00:07:44,612 --> 00:07:48,345
They told me they'd killed my parents
and they were going to kill me next.

100
00:07:48,973 --> 00:07:51,191
Despite all the awful things they said,

101
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:53,704
I was incredibly relaxed.

102
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,096
I killed them.

103
00:08:04,441 --> 00:08:05,322
All of them.

104
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,088
One-by-one.

105
00:08:24,621 --> 00:08:27,578
That was the moment I realized what I must do.

106
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,641
I'm good at this. At killing.

107
00:08:31,883 --> 00:08:34,287
Maybe because I'm a little crazy.

108
00:08:34,906 --> 00:08:38,928
If I kill bad people, I can make the world a better place!

109
00:08:41,051 --> 00:08:45,641
I was a solo assassin in the capital
when the Revolutionary Army scouted me out.

110
00:08:46,334 --> 00:08:48,065
I guess everyone has a rough past.

111
00:08:48,345 --> 00:08:49,826
Something to carry with them.

112
00:08:50,534 --> 00:08:52,670
Do you... think I can do this?

113
00:08:52,763 --> 00:08:54,356
You'll do just fine.

114
00:08:58,737 --> 00:09:01,576
Well, unlike me, you're a very talented cook!

115
00:09:01,979 --> 00:09:03,675
That's what you thought I meant?

116
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,393
You're doing great, Tatsumi!

117
00:09:05,418 --> 00:09:05,827
Huh?

118
00:09:10,734 --> 00:09:13,031
Y'know, maybe I'm not up for this.

119
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:16,656
Tatsumi, it seems you've made a full recovery.

120
00:09:16,898 --> 00:09:19,350
We've acquired Zanku's Imperial Arms.

121
00:09:19,835 --> 00:09:21,312
I want you to try it on.

122
00:09:21,337 --> 00:09:22,525
Wow, you sure?!

123
00:09:22,994 --> 00:09:23,825
It's for me?!

124
00:09:24,227 --> 00:09:25,857
That one's all yours, sugar.

125
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:29,412
Careful, these things are known for putting
a lot of pressure on your mind and body.

126
00:09:30,747 --> 00:09:32,851
This eyeball thing may not look all that cool,

127
00:09:33,176 --> 00:09:35,426
but its abilities are actually pretty amazing!

128
00:09:37,253 --> 00:09:41,122
It wasn't in my book anywhere, so we
still don't have much information on it.

129
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:43,277
Zanku was reading people's minds with it.

130
00:09:43,346 --> 00:09:44,834
See if you can make it work.

131
00:09:46,602 --> 00:09:47,522
You're thinking...

132
00:09:54,497 --> 00:09:56,184
"I can't wait to eat meat tonight!"

133
00:09:57,079 --> 00:09:57,973
That's amazing!

134
00:09:58,008 --> 00:10:01,101
Nope. He hasn't even activated the stupid thing yet.

135
00:10:01,126 --> 00:10:03,429
Well, I sure don't want him to read my mind.

136
00:10:03,747 --> 00:10:07,012
It's supposed to have five sights
so quit stalling and try one out.

137
00:10:07,037 --> 00:10:08,973
Jeez, take a chill pill.

138
00:10:09,619 --> 00:10:10,378
Okay...

139
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:14,288
O, random ability that I don't know about...

140
00:10:14,952 --> 00:10:16,380
activate now!

141
00:10:22,739 --> 00:10:23,670
Whadda'ya see?

142
00:10:25,545 --> 00:10:26,702
Don't have a cow!

143
00:10:26,937 --> 00:10:28,753
Whoever invented Imperial Arms...

144
00:10:29,192 --> 00:10:30,899
Was an absolute genius!

145
00:10:32,736 --> 00:10:34,062
Crap, it's rejecting him!

146
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:36,099
I'm taking it off.

147
00:10:36,439 --> 00:10:38,283
Man, my head really hurts...

148
00:10:38,308 --> 00:10:39,607
It's not a match.

149
00:10:39,822 --> 00:10:41,524
Your affinity's a little off.

150
00:10:41,549 --> 00:10:44,268
You probably just didn't like
the way it looked with your sweater.

151
00:10:44,501 --> 00:10:48,811
They say your first impression of an
Imperial Arm shows how well you bond with it.

152
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,830
Let's have headquarters examine it.

153
00:10:52,415 --> 00:10:55,091
I'm sure it'll be a great
asset once we know a little more.

154
00:10:55,391 --> 00:11:01,154
Sometimes on our missions, we come across targets
who have Imperial Arms, just as Headhunter Zanku did.

155
00:11:01,351 --> 00:11:04,821
Our superiors prefer we try to steal... or destroy...

156
00:11:04,855 --> 00:11:07,014
as many of them as we possibly can.

157
00:11:07,671 --> 00:11:09,873
So with every Imperial Arms we get,

158
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,197
we're helping to further advance the revolution?

159
00:11:12,222 --> 00:11:13,061
That's right.

160
00:11:13,483 --> 00:11:16,233
Here's a book about Imperial Arms I'd like you to read.

161
00:11:18,308 --> 00:11:19,330
There's so many...

162
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,005
and they're all different!

163
00:11:21,298 --> 00:11:22,640
It's really unbelievable.

164
00:11:23,026 --> 00:11:26,250
You should memorize the details of every weapon in there.

165
00:11:26,777 --> 00:11:27,343
Wow...

166
00:11:27,764 --> 00:11:29,192
So which one is the most powerful?

167
00:11:29,752 --> 00:11:31,707
It depends heavily on the user.

168
00:11:32,476 --> 00:11:35,106
That said, if I had to make a choice...

169
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:38,294
One can manipulate ice.

170
00:11:38,783 --> 00:11:40,522
Its owner is quite strong.

171
00:11:40,877 --> 00:11:43,863
Fortunately for us, though,
she's not in the Capital right now.

172
00:11:44,254 --> 00:11:46,658
She's trying to subdue the people in the north.

173
00:11:46,856 --> 00:11:48,306
Why the people in the north?

174
00:11:48,885 --> 00:11:51,685
The prince of the northern tribe is known as Numa Seika.

175
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:56,207
He's a legendary hero who fights
with a spear and has never lost.

176
00:11:56,853 --> 00:11:59,223
Not only is he a master strategist,

177
00:11:59,429 --> 00:12:01,458
but his people trust him very deeply,

178
00:12:01,665 --> 00:12:03,438
which makes him a threat to the Empire.

179
00:12:04,581 --> 00:12:09,354
He took over the northern fortress capital
and made it into a base for his tremendous army.

180
00:12:09,866 --> 00:12:14,681
Since then, his forces have begun
to invade more and more aggressively,

181
00:12:14,978 --> 00:12:18,404
so the Empire formed a special unit to fight them off.

182
00:12:19,962 --> 00:12:21,719
I don't think we need to worry about that.

183
00:12:22,378 --> 00:12:25,178
It'll take a year to stop the
northern tribe's army, even for her.

184
00:12:25,976 --> 00:12:27,250
We can only hope.

185
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:31,267
Well, I say bring it on!

186
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:34,005
Let's go and get as many of these things as we can!

187
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:37,032
You're in an awfully good mood. What's gotten into you?

188
00:12:37,321 --> 00:12:40,055
There's still some Imperial Arms out
there that we don't know about, right?

189
00:12:40,289 --> 00:12:42,258
Well, that gives me a really great idea.

190
00:12:42,405 --> 00:12:44,359
I mean they can do all these amazing things!

191
00:12:44,714 --> 00:12:46,707
So what if... maybe...

192
00:12:47,137 --> 00:12:50,890
What if there's even an Imperial Arms
that can bring people back from the dead!

193
00:12:51,207 --> 00:12:52,690
Y'know? Right?

194
00:12:53,176 --> 00:12:55,578
If there is, I can bring Sayo and Ieyasu back!

195
00:12:55,878 --> 00:12:57,313
All we have to do is keep looking!

196
00:12:57,338 --> 00:12:58,165
Oh, honey.

197
00:12:59,300 --> 00:12:59,795
What?

198
00:13:00,483 --> 00:13:03,877
Not even an Imperial Arms can
bring the dead back to life, Tatsumi.

199
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,454
We only get one shot at life.

200
00:13:07,157 --> 00:13:09,342
No! No, you don't know that for sure!

201
00:13:09,367 --> 00:13:10,830
We just have to find it out there!

202
00:13:10,855 --> 00:13:12,932
Then what about the first Emperor?

203
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,954
If he could've done that, he'd still be alive.

204
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:20,790
He probably saw it was impossible and that's
why he made Imperial Arms in the first place.

205
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:24,678
Just forget it.

206
00:13:25,154 --> 00:13:28,781
If you don't let go of that
weakness, the enemy will surely see it.

207
00:13:29,386 --> 00:13:30,490
And if that happens,

208
00:13:30,841 --> 00:13:32,103
it'll get you killed.

209
00:13:50,427 --> 00:13:53,278
Tatsumi, shouldn't you be going to bed soon?

210
00:13:55,431 --> 00:13:57,919
I was so happy when I thought
they might come back to life.

211
00:13:58,863 --> 00:14:00,014
I knew it was crazy,

212
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,751
but I thought there might be some small chance.

213
00:14:06,077 --> 00:14:08,945
I'm really not gonna get to see them ever again, am I?

214
00:14:09,826 --> 00:14:11,473
I thought I had accepted that...

215
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:18,400
Tatsumi...

216
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,947
I promise not to tell anybody else about this.

217
00:14:33,143 --> 00:14:35,324
So go on and cry as much as you need to.

218
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:41,455
Is it okay... for you to be this nice to me?

219
00:14:41,938 --> 00:14:44,375
It's all right. I don't see any problem with it.

220
00:14:44,648 --> 00:14:45,645
Maybe.

221
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,371
Yeah, you would say that.

222
00:14:51,748 --> 00:14:52,390
Sheele...

223
00:14:53,869 --> 00:14:54,591
Thank you...

224
00:14:57,347 --> 00:14:59,383
I should be thanking you, Tatsumi.

225
00:15:00,624 --> 00:15:05,684
Because of you, I've found
another way to make myself... useful.

226
00:15:25,647 --> 00:15:28,324
You conquered the northern tribe incredibly quickly.

227
00:15:28,505 --> 00:15:30,185
Most impressive, General Esdeath!

228
00:15:30,892 --> 00:15:33,711
I can't believe you were the best they had to offer.

229
00:15:34,024 --> 00:15:35,577
How very disappointing.

230
00:15:38,554 --> 00:15:43,219
Will we ever find an enemy out
there who can satisfy my appetite?

231
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,130
Look at this place. There's a lot going on!

232
00:15:51,274 --> 00:15:53,385
Yep! It's a lively part of town.

233
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:56,179
When you're born poor, you gotta keep yourself busy.

234
00:15:56,204 --> 00:15:57,493
So how've you been, Leone?

235
00:15:57,518 --> 00:15:59,694
I could use one of your backrubs!

236
00:15:59,719 --> 00:16:01,940
Hey, we should go and get a drink sometime!

237
00:16:01,972 --> 00:16:04,368
Leone! Will you come and play with me later?

238
00:16:04,934 --> 00:16:07,252
Man, you sure are popular with these people.

239
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,803
That's because this is the part of town where I grew up.

240
00:16:10,335 --> 00:16:13,305
I know it sounds crazy but I was
famous around here for my back massag...

241
00:16:13,384 --> 00:16:14,479
Look, it's Leone!

242
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,139
Oh, crap!

243
00:16:17,163 --> 00:16:19,117
Uh, hey, wait!

244
00:16:19,142 --> 00:16:22,368
Come back here! Where's my money?! Where is it?!

245
00:16:22,393 --> 00:16:24,605
So, what do you think about my old neighborhood?

246
00:16:24,706 --> 00:16:26,269
I love it! It's really freakin' great!

247
00:16:26,294 --> 00:16:28,566
I hope I don't end up on one of your friend's hit lists.

248
00:16:30,293 --> 00:16:31,132
Reporting in!

249
00:16:31,675 --> 00:16:34,608
It appears General Nakakido
and General Hemi have defected.

250
00:16:34,904 --> 00:16:36,988
They've abandoned their posts and joined the rebel troops!

251
00:16:37,013 --> 00:16:39,681
But General Nakakido was an expert at combat.

252
00:16:39,755 --> 00:16:43,166
The number of rebel forces is
increasing at an alarming rate.

253
00:16:43,289 --> 00:16:45,423
If we don't move, they could destroy the empire.

254
00:16:45,448 --> 00:16:46,858
We must not lose faith!

255
00:16:47,258 --> 00:16:51,159
They're situated so far south that we
may contend with them at our leisure.

256
00:16:51,441 --> 00:16:54,563
If we want to completely clear out the seeds of rebellion,

257
00:16:54,588 --> 00:16:56,802
then we should begin by rounding them all up!

258
00:16:57,306 --> 00:16:59,001
Isn't that right, Minister?

259
00:17:00,574 --> 00:17:04,786
Well said, Your Highness! I
see you're keeping your composure.

260
00:17:04,915 --> 00:17:06,475
Our current issue...

261
00:17:11,373 --> 00:17:15,252
is the rogue group of assassins, not the rebels!

262
00:17:15,385 --> 00:17:19,680
They killed Captain Ogre and my dear relative Yokal.

263
00:17:19,793 --> 00:17:24,327
They murdered Headhunter Zanku and took his Imperial Arms!

264
00:17:24,421 --> 00:17:28,217
Damn Night Raid is making a mess of the capital!

265
00:17:28,851 --> 00:17:33,233
I'm gaining weight from all this undue stress!

266
00:17:34,257 --> 00:17:37,535
I'm calling back General Esdeath.

267
00:17:39,256 --> 00:17:40,736
Um, forgive me, Minister,

268
00:17:40,843 --> 00:17:42,614
but General Budo is already here.

269
00:17:42,639 --> 00:17:48,056
I'm sure the Great General has better
things to do than hunt down a gang of bandits.

270
00:17:48,278 --> 00:17:49,473
Esdeath, huh?

271
00:17:50,274 --> 00:17:54,786
Her accomplishments are equal
to that of Budo. We can trust her.

272
00:17:54,934 --> 00:18:00,265
She slaughtered 400,000 tribesmen by burying them alive.

273
00:18:00,516 --> 00:18:02,798
I don't need her to capture them.

274
00:18:02,885 --> 00:18:07,637
I want her to track down and
kill as many of them as possible!

275
00:18:15,072 --> 00:18:16,439
Whew, I think we lost 'em.

276
00:18:16,751 --> 00:18:17,668
You okay, Sis...

277
00:18:18,855 --> 00:18:19,417
Wait...

278
00:18:20,251 --> 00:18:20,764
Where's...

279
00:18:21,899 --> 00:18:22,601
Leone?!

280
00:18:24,401 --> 00:18:26,262
Oh no, I can't find her.

281
00:18:27,184 --> 00:18:29,117
And I have no idea where I am!

282
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:31,945
What's this?

283
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,933
Looks like my Justice Sensor has found something!

284
00:18:35,129 --> 00:18:35,925
You there!

285
00:18:36,771 --> 00:18:37,240
Huh?

286
00:18:38,146 --> 00:18:40,205
You seem to need assistance, citizen!

287
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,306
That uniform...

288
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,650
Proud member of the Imperial
Guard, Seryu, at your service!

289
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,151
She's a guard...

290
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:53,160
Woorf... Woorf...

291
00:18:53,248 --> 00:18:54,896
Koro, you hungry, buddy?

292
00:18:55,243 --> 00:18:56,327
We'll eat soon.

293
00:18:56,352 --> 00:18:57,253
Woof, woof?

294
00:18:57,278 --> 00:18:59,493
Sorry... what is that?

295
00:19:00,267 --> 00:19:03,522
He's my Imperial Arms, Hekatonkeiru!

296
00:19:03,585 --> 00:19:05,679
Don't worry, he only bites bad guys.

297
00:19:07,588 --> 00:19:09,027
He was in that book.

298
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:11,600
Oh, that's right, you needed help, didn't you?

299
00:19:11,626 --> 00:19:12,995
No, no, I'm fine!

300
00:19:13,245 --> 00:19:14,723
I just got a little turned around.

301
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,533
I think I remember the name of the place I was before.

302
00:19:17,827 --> 00:19:19,009
I'll help you find it!

303
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:20,993
I'm on patrol right now anyway!

304
00:19:21,771 --> 00:19:24,159
Let's go. I won't let you get lost.

305
00:19:26,327 --> 00:19:28,776
Wooofff! Woorf! Woorf!

306
00:19:29,091 --> 00:19:32,855
So uh... do all the Imperial Guards
have a weird angry pet like this?

307
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,865
Of course not!

308
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:36,989
I'm the only guard who has an Imperial Arms.

309
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,382
Koro... um...

310
00:19:38,786 --> 00:19:40,864
Well, that's the name I've given him anyway.

311
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:45,884
He won't cooperate with anyone unless he can
tell they have an extremely high affinity with him.

312
00:19:47,164 --> 00:19:50,940
Supposedly, none of the top-ranked
officers were able to click with Koro.

313
00:19:51,298 --> 00:19:54,501
So they started running tests on low-level grunts like me.

314
00:19:55,401 --> 00:19:59,551
I was told that he responded to my
righteous heart while I was getting examined.

315
00:20:00,504 --> 00:20:03,277
And he's been my cute, little companion ever since.

316
00:20:03,886 --> 00:20:04,820
Right, Koro?

317
00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:06,631
Woorf! Woof!

318
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:09,169
Oookaaay...

319
00:20:12,362 --> 00:20:15,604
Okay, I'm pretty sure this is
the place you're looking for.

320
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:17,770
Thank you so much.

321
00:20:18,112 --> 00:20:21,205
I'm honored. And let me know if you see anything evil.

322
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:23,835
You can depend on us to rip it to pieces!

323
00:20:24,649 --> 00:20:26,541
That makes me feel safe, I guess.

324
00:20:27,111 --> 00:20:30,247
Time to go, little buddy! You still hungry?

325
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:33,335
Let's pick out a few death-row
prisoners for you to snack on!

326
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:42,274
A guard with an Imperial Arms?

327
00:20:42,717 --> 00:20:44,025
This could get ugly.

328
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,404
I'd better tell the boss.

329
00:20:47,547 --> 00:20:49,466
I know it's important to help people,

330
00:20:49,725 --> 00:20:52,984
but I must be vigilant, and locate Night Raid!

331
00:20:53,981 --> 00:20:56,579
I must... for Captain Ogre...

332
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,995
Those are some nice punches there, Seryu!

333
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,228
You're getting stronger every day, aren't cha?

334
00:21:09,232 --> 00:21:11,639
I was lucky an Imperial Arms chose me.

335
00:21:12,014 --> 00:21:14,731
So now I will make myself more powerful!

336
00:21:17,097 --> 00:21:19,490
My father told me something before he died!

337
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:22,297
"Justice must never submit to evil!"

338
00:21:22,402 --> 00:21:25,135
Oh? Well if you're that eager to improve,

339
00:21:25,213 --> 00:21:28,214
I could give you a trump card. How'd ya like that?

340
00:21:28,239 --> 00:21:29,367
You'd really do that?!

341
00:21:29,527 --> 00:21:32,839
I know a doctor who's been
looking to perform a few experiments.

342
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:36,513
But I should probably warn you,
the procedure's gonna hurt like hell.

343
00:21:36,538 --> 00:21:37,634
No problem at all!

344
00:21:37,846 --> 00:21:41,070
I'm willing to do anything I
can to help the fight against evil!

345
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:44,669
Those monsters murdered Captain Ogre!

346
00:21:45,814 --> 00:21:46,769
Night Raid...

347
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:49,294
you will pay with your lives!
