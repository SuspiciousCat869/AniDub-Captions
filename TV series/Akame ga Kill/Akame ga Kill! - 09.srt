1
00:00:10,065 --> 00:00:10,651
Yes...

2
00:00:11,132 --> 00:00:12,960
Perfect! It's all better!

3
00:00:13,738 --> 00:00:16,217
It was nice taking it easy waiting for my arm to heal,

4
00:00:16,412 --> 00:00:17,897
but I'm ready to fight again!

5
00:00:19,451 --> 00:00:22,724
With Sheele and Bulat gone, I'll have to work extra hard!

6
00:01:58,085 --> 00:02:00,717
Okay! Which one of you is gonna train with me?!

7
00:02:03,376 --> 00:02:05,327
Hey, Mine! What's up?

8
00:02:05,524 --> 00:02:07,300
I'm glad your arm's feeling better.

9
00:02:07,532 --> 00:02:09,067
What are you guys doing?

10
00:02:09,301 --> 00:02:13,298
These pansies weren't getting anywhere
with their training, so we decided to help out.

11
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:15,409
I never realized...

12
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:20,550
until I actually put on Incursio, how
fast that thing can take a toll on my stamina.

13
00:02:22,348 --> 00:02:24,679
If I wanna wear it for long battles like Bro did,

14
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,215
I'm gonna have to bulk up.

15
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:27,958
With the way I am right now,

16
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:30,278
I can only go invisible for about a second.

17
00:02:32,877 --> 00:02:35,546
It's a bit unusual to see you getting all sweaty, Lubb.

18
00:02:35,687 --> 00:02:38,396
Well since the team is down to only two guys now,

19
00:02:38,884 --> 00:02:42,359
figure it's about time I started
getting a little bit more serious.

20
00:02:42,384 --> 00:02:44,092
It's cute when you talk all big,

21
00:02:44,216 --> 00:02:47,057
since you haven't done half
as many pushups as Tatsumi here.

22
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,395
But it's not his fault.

23
00:02:49,508 --> 00:02:52,836
There's a considerable weight
difference between me and Leone.

24
00:02:56,318 --> 00:02:58,278
Good, you're all here.

25
00:02:58,563 --> 00:02:59,329
Boss!

26
00:02:59,589 --> 00:03:01,882
I'm off to the Revolutionaries' main base.

27
00:03:01,955 --> 00:03:04,776
I'm thinking they'll need the
weapons we got from the Three Beasts.

28
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:05,963
By yourself?

29
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,864
And you're taking that battle axe? Isn't it kinda heavy?

30
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:11,439
Nah, I can handle it. See?

31
00:03:11,657 --> 00:03:13,680
Now there's no way I could actually use it,

32
00:03:13,705 --> 00:03:15,415
but I can at least lug it around.

33
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,776
I had no idea she was such a badass.

34
00:03:17,844 --> 00:03:20,785
Of course she's a badass. She used to be a general, man.

35
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,660
Akame, I'm leaving you in charge.

36
00:03:23,782 --> 00:03:26,357
I want everyone to buckle down and train hard.

37
00:03:26,777 --> 00:03:28,180
Okay, whatever.

38
00:03:28,281 --> 00:03:30,016
Hey! Could you be serious?!

39
00:03:30,062 --> 00:03:33,430
Ah, don't worry too much, Akame
always gets the job done either way.

40
00:03:37,773 --> 00:03:41,459
I'm also going to the base to try and
recruit a couple new members for the team.

41
00:03:41,734 --> 00:03:46,062
Although, I highly doubt they can afford to give
us anybody who's ready for combat at the moment.

42
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:50,396
I'm sorry, guys. I'm trying to get better, I promise.

43
00:03:52,993 --> 00:03:55,135
The Three Beasts you defeated on the cruise ship...

44
00:03:55,244 --> 00:03:59,309
They were at the center of the Empire's
offensive forces and members of Esdeath's army.

45
00:04:00,059 --> 00:04:02,362
But you and Bulat managed to defeat them.

46
00:04:02,726 --> 00:04:06,518
Esdeath may be a powerful foe, but
she's suffered a devastating loss.

47
00:04:06,832 --> 00:04:10,175
When the revolution begins, we will
have considerably less to worry about.

48
00:04:10,809 --> 00:04:12,845
You didn't just save passengers.

49
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:18,206
You ultimately saved thousands of revolutionaries
who will be needed in our struggle against the empire.

50
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:21,887
You are strong, Tatsumi. And you're doing a great job.

51
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,510
Yes, ma'am.

52
00:04:27,145 --> 00:04:30,100
I didn't tell you before, because
I didn't want it to go to your head.

53
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,210
But Bulat told me something.

54
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:36,751
Tatsumi's still got a lot to figure out,
but I can see he has amazing potential.

55
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:41,950
If we do a good job training him, maybe he could
even improve enough to surpass me one of these days.

56
00:04:42,195 --> 00:04:44,102
I can't wait to see what he does.

57
00:04:45,057 --> 00:04:45,948
Thanks, man!

58
00:04:49,762 --> 00:04:52,560
Take pride in yourself, and survive.

59
00:04:53,033 --> 00:04:54,360
That's all you can do.

60
00:04:54,893 --> 00:04:58,054
Try your best to become the kind
of person Bulat wanted you to be.

61
00:05:02,717 --> 00:05:05,171
Our need for more members is critical.

62
00:05:05,825 --> 00:05:11,472
Leone's report that Esdeath is forming a special
unit entirely of Imperial Arms users is disconcerting.

63
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:14,222
I have to do something.

64
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:22,895
Liver, Nyau, Daidara...

65
00:05:23,562 --> 00:05:25,372
All three of you were killed.

66
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,312
I suppose that means you were just too weak.

67
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,410
You've fallen victim to the laws of natural selection.

68
00:05:32,278 --> 00:05:34,097
Such incompetence.

69
00:05:37,382 --> 00:05:39,128
I cannot change the past,

70
00:05:39,284 --> 00:05:41,390
but I promise I shall avenge your death.

71
00:05:42,741 --> 00:05:44,813
The replacements will be arriving today.

72
00:05:46,275 --> 00:05:48,907
The word is they're a smattering of eccentrics.

73
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,880
Might as well have some fun.

74
00:05:57,363 --> 00:05:58,438
My name's Wave.

75
00:05:58,865 --> 00:06:01,869
I served in the Imperial Navy. I'm a man of the sea.

76
00:06:02,175 --> 00:06:05,076
I'm here because I got promoted
to the special police force!

77
00:06:05,316 --> 00:06:08,482
It's my first day in the capital, so I'm kinda nervous.

78
00:06:09,032 --> 00:06:14,731
But not to worry! I'm wearing this awesome cool outfit, so
I'll be in with the locals. It was a huge hit back home.

79
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,685
Yeah! I'm gonna fit in just fine.

80
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,612
He's stinky!

81
00:06:17,636 --> 00:06:18,156
Totally!

82
00:06:18,224 --> 00:06:22,557
Besides, Mom even gave me some of our
highest-quality fish to share with my new friends.

83
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:25,488
People'll be offended if ya got nothin' to offer, hon!

84
00:06:25,935 --> 00:06:26,991
But I dunno...

85
00:06:27,016 --> 00:06:27,806
What's with him?

86
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,865
Frickin' redneck.

87
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:32,596
I could be imagining things, but I
feel like everybody's staring at me.

88
00:06:33,123 --> 00:06:35,373
Maybe city people have different rules of etiquette.

89
00:06:38,817 --> 00:06:39,426
Oh well!

90
00:06:39,888 --> 00:06:43,845
If I can handle fighting pirates and
aquatic Danger Beasts, then this is nothing!

91
00:06:44,095 --> 00:06:45,937
There's no reason to stir things up!

92
00:06:53,006 --> 00:06:56,565
Okay! My future teammates are waiting behind this door.

93
00:06:57,205 --> 00:06:58,871
First impressions are everything!

94
00:06:59,132 --> 00:07:00,726
I have to show I mean business.

95
00:07:01,446 --> 00:07:04,759
Don't let 'em walk all over ya! Let 'em know who's boss.

96
00:07:05,654 --> 00:07:09,303
Greetings, friends! I'm here from the Imperial Navy...?

97
00:07:13,205 --> 00:07:15,540
I'm so sorry!

98
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:19,641
Oh God, that was probably the interrogation room!

99
00:07:19,711 --> 00:07:21,562
Man, I'm such an idiot.

100
00:07:25,277 --> 00:07:26,118
You're kidding!

101
00:07:26,537 --> 00:07:28,605
I'm gonna be working with that guy?!

102
00:07:30,089 --> 00:07:31,218
Uh... hello again!

103
00:07:33,845 --> 00:07:36,420
I should probably do my best not to piss this guy off.

104
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,784
Oh, crap, what'd I do?!

105
00:07:48,864 --> 00:07:51,203
Why is that freak still staring at me like that?!

106
00:07:51,989 --> 00:07:55,240
Oh, no... Mom, please don't
be ashamed if I come back home!

107
00:08:06,096 --> 00:08:07,733
It's a normal person!

108
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:13,472
Uh, hi!

109
00:08:13,973 --> 00:08:15,942
Nice to meet you, my name's Wa-Heeey!

110
00:08:15,967 --> 00:08:17,573
Stay away from my cookies.

111
00:08:17,924 --> 00:08:19,248
Never mind! Not normal.

112
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,107
I'm sorry I bothered you.

113
00:08:26,365 --> 00:08:28,545
Damn, these guys are wack-jobs!

114
00:08:29,508 --> 00:08:30,982
Hello, comrades!

115
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:34,821
I'm Seryu Ubiquitous,

116
00:08:34,846 --> 00:08:36,545
member of the Imperial Guard!

117
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,402
And my friend's name is Koro!

118
00:08:39,515 --> 00:08:41,326
She's probably not that crazy, right?

119
00:08:42,695 --> 00:08:45,571
Please come grace us with your presence, Dr. Stylish!

120
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,030
Ah, I love a good dramatic introduction.

121
00:08:50,075 --> 00:08:52,405
The very definition of "stylish".

122
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,537
You've captured my masculine grace.

123
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,504
Oh great, now there's this guy?!

124
00:08:57,604 --> 00:08:59,973
Oh my, you're just a little country boy!

125
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:02,388
You're just too adorable by far?!

126
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,585
I'll polish you up in no time, cowboy.

127
00:09:04,829 --> 00:09:06,122
So don't be shy.

128
00:09:06,752 --> 00:09:08,335
I think he likes me...

129
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,710
Good afternoon.

130
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,893
Oh, it would appear that I'm the last one to arrive.

131
00:09:14,234 --> 00:09:17,337
Huh? Oh yeah, nice to meet you. My name's Wave.

132
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:20,462
Hello there. Call me Run, the pleasure's all mine.

133
00:09:21,815 --> 00:09:25,250
Yes! There is a person here who doesn't freak me out!

134
00:09:26,238 --> 00:09:27,660
Uh... excuse me.

135
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:30,728
T.. The tea is ready, if anyone would like some.

136
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,215
S-Sorry.

137
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:36,208
I would have said hello before,
but I'm a little bit... shy.

138
00:09:36,562 --> 00:09:40,243
Y'know, bashful. Sorry, I... I'm sorry.

139
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:42,809
Whoo, looks like I'm the oldest one here.

140
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,957
I really need to get my act together, don't I?

141
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:48,894
I-I hope we all get to be close friends.

142
00:09:48,993 --> 00:09:52,647
Call me Bols, from the Incendiary Squad. Please.

143
00:09:52,907 --> 00:09:54,516
Didn't peg him for the shy type.

144
00:09:55,565 --> 00:09:57,164
The Incendiary Squad...

145
00:09:57,237 --> 00:10:01,541
That's the stylish unit that will
incinerate anything, even living people.

146
00:10:01,978 --> 00:10:03,874
Explains his interesting look...

147
00:10:04,035 --> 00:10:05,967
but he is not my type.

148
00:10:12,235 --> 00:10:13,710
And who might you be?

149
00:10:13,742 --> 00:10:16,028
What in the hell are you all doing in here?!

150
00:10:16,066 --> 00:10:17,234
What's your problem?

151
00:10:17,321 --> 00:10:18,736
We were all invited to come and...

152
00:10:22,877 --> 00:10:24,699
You never know who's an assassin.

153
00:10:24,794 --> 00:10:26,582
Don't ever let your guard down.

154
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,266
This one has good reaction speed.

155
00:10:35,018 --> 00:10:39,048
You can't attack from behind when
your bloodlust is so easily sensed.

156
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:44,349
I'm not gonna hold back, even if this is just a game.

157
00:10:47,163 --> 00:10:49,686
Must be the Imperial Arms Yat-su-fu-sa.

158
00:10:49,711 --> 00:10:51,462
Just as sharp as expected.

159
00:10:52,721 --> 00:10:54,212
General Esdeath!

160
00:10:56,034 --> 00:10:56,834
God...

161
00:10:58,027 --> 00:11:01,252
So... even the superior officer's a nutcase!

162
00:11:02,738 --> 00:11:04,575
I hope you found that enjoyable.

163
00:11:04,862 --> 00:11:08,147
I didn't want to bore anyone with a formal meet n' greet.

164
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,403
Nah, I'm used to a little rough-housing.

165
00:11:10,489 --> 00:11:12,847
Your advice was very helpful! Thanks a lot!

166
00:11:12,987 --> 00:11:16,361
Good. After we visit the
Emperor, we'll have a little party.

167
00:11:16,421 --> 00:11:18,156
Wha?! We're gonna meet the Emperor?!

168
00:11:18,222 --> 00:11:21,164
With all due respect, aren't we
taking things a bit too quickly?

169
00:11:21,224 --> 00:11:23,791
I prefer to get the more tedious things over with first.

170
00:11:23,854 --> 00:11:25,597
Oh, by the way, General...

171
00:11:25,683 --> 00:11:28,758
Have you decided on a super-fierce name for the squad yet?

172
00:11:28,859 --> 00:11:29,889
Yes.

173
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:36,064
We are an independently mobile team charged with
hunting down an elusive gang of vicious murderers.

174
00:11:36,432 --> 00:11:37,237
Therefore...

175
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:39,408
I'd like us to be called...

176
00:11:39,976 --> 00:11:41,242
the Jaegers.

177
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,940
I love the idea of all of us eating together,

178
00:11:45,153 --> 00:11:48,219
especially since the meal is
the seafood I brought for everyone.

179
00:11:48,898 --> 00:11:51,513
But why are we the only ones who know how to cook?

180
00:11:51,868 --> 00:11:52,657
Wave!

181
00:11:53,317 --> 00:11:54,963
The spinach goes in last.

182
00:11:55,023 --> 00:11:57,087
It'll wither if you put it in too soon.

183
00:11:57,474 --> 00:11:58,820
Uh, you're right. I'm sorry.

184
00:11:59,264 --> 00:12:00,732
Anyway, I wanted to tell you...

185
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:03,842
It's a huge relief to find out
you're such a nice guy, Bols.

186
00:12:04,061 --> 00:12:08,062
N-No, I'm afraid I'm not all that nice.

187
00:12:09,124 --> 00:12:09,912
Commander?

188
00:12:09,936 --> 00:12:10,365
Yes?

189
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:13,650
When you're not working, what sort of
things do you like to do in your free time?

190
00:12:13,856 --> 00:12:17,207
Torturing prisoners... Learning new methods of torture...

191
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:19,438
But as of just recently...

192
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,980
I've found... an interest in love.

193
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,902
Love?

194
00:12:25,701 --> 00:12:29,660
Anyway, I've heard reports that
we have an extra Imperial Arms.

195
00:12:29,719 --> 00:12:31,221
Oh! Uh, yes!

196
00:12:31,466 --> 00:12:34,254
It's a scissor-type weapon
that I have reclaimed from evil!

197
00:12:34,764 --> 00:12:36,998
But we have yet to find anyone who can use it.

198
00:12:37,642 --> 00:12:40,619
The minister will confiscate
it if we don't find a wielder.

199
00:12:41,271 --> 00:12:42,502
Which would be a waste.

200
00:12:42,527 --> 00:12:46,035
To make things interesting, we'll
turn our search into a little game.

201
00:12:51,314 --> 00:12:51,811
Yo!

202
00:12:53,662 --> 00:12:54,148
Hey!

203
00:12:54,577 --> 00:12:55,341
Come on in!

204
00:12:56,286 --> 00:12:57,105
After you.

205
00:12:59,071 --> 00:12:59,693
Whoa...

206
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,943
This really is like a secret base.

207
00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:07,111
Yup! It's my pride and joy.

208
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,472
Come on, it's not like you built the place yourself.

209
00:13:09,526 --> 00:13:12,963
Hel-looooo! Welcome to our Imperial Secret Base!

210
00:13:13,063 --> 00:13:14,705
You're not being very secretive!

211
00:13:14,765 --> 00:13:18,737
Well, the Imperial Guard's put up wanted
posters of some of us all over the city.

212
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:21,704
But there are still a few of us
who can still be seen out there.

213
00:13:22,281 --> 00:13:24,216
Yeah, and if that isn't enough for ya,

214
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:28,703
the whole capital's been going crazy. Some
kind of special police force called the "Jaegers".

215
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,753
That's because Esdeath is in charge of it.

216
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,717
She's a pretty big deal in this town.

217
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:34,263
You don't wanna mess with her.

218
00:13:35,533 --> 00:13:38,213
Is this Esdeath chick really all that dangerous?

219
00:13:38,882 --> 00:13:40,215
You have no idea.

220
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,340
Okay, maybe I should tell you the story.

221
00:13:43,468 --> 00:13:44,864
So, several years ago...

222
00:13:45,484 --> 00:13:49,566
A southwestern tribe raised the standard
of revolt against the cruelty of the empire.

223
00:13:49,847 --> 00:13:52,511
So the empire sent the army to quiet them down.

224
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:58,242
The tribe only had 10,000 men as
opposed to the Imperial Army's 120,000,

225
00:13:58,435 --> 00:14:00,350
so it seemed like the outcome would be clear.

226
00:14:00,804 --> 00:14:03,012
But it turned out to be way more complicated than that.

227
00:14:03,611 --> 00:14:06,851
Since the Imperial soldiers were
so used to their cush city life,

228
00:14:06,911 --> 00:14:09,601
they weren't able to survive in the harsh wilderness.

229
00:14:10,143 --> 00:14:14,233
Plus, the tribesmen would attack at night,
so that made it even more difficult for them.

230
00:14:14,773 --> 00:14:19,056
The Empire started to panic, so they
dispatched General Najenda and General Esdeath,

231
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:22,038
who were already extremely
talented despite being so young.

232
00:14:22,398 --> 00:14:24,935
You seem to be in a bad mood, General Esdeath.

233
00:14:25,661 --> 00:14:26,736
Can you blame me?

234
00:14:26,901 --> 00:14:30,888
The minister ordered me to use
Imperial Arms to exterminate the rebels.

235
00:14:31,028 --> 00:14:34,987
I'd hoped to take my time punishing the
forces who wiped out the Suppression Unit,

236
00:14:35,012 --> 00:14:36,989
but he doesn't share my interests.

237
00:14:37,028 --> 00:14:38,966
It takes all the fun out of the whole thing.

238
00:14:39,716 --> 00:14:40,859
But what can you do?

239
00:14:45,475 --> 00:14:48,945
No matter if it's Danger Beasts, killer insects,

240
00:14:49,265 --> 00:14:50,998
plagues or viruses...

241
00:14:52,817 --> 00:14:56,386
Anything that gets in my way... will freeze!

242
00:15:01,138 --> 00:15:03,992
Her power... it's incredible.

243
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,907
We'll take over the enemy base, okay?

244
00:15:08,411 --> 00:15:11,048
Man, I feel like a cannonball when I charge like this!

245
00:15:11,115 --> 00:15:12,990
Artillery... fire!

246
00:15:18,171 --> 00:15:22,292
As soon as you slaughter them, you can enjoy your reward!

247
00:15:22,537 --> 00:15:25,210
Have your way with this wretched city!

248
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:30,611
It's beautiful, isn't it? Your
precious home burning to the ground.

249
00:15:30,671 --> 00:15:32,512
You bitch! Just finish me off!

250
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:36,018
I feel like being merciful. I think I'll take pity on you.

251
00:15:36,085 --> 00:15:37,975
I'll allow you and your friends to go free.

252
00:15:38,075 --> 00:15:39,409
Like hell you will!

253
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:42,694
If you don't just kill me, I swear
you're gonna wish you'd never come to this...

254
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,061
Listen well.

255
00:15:44,381 --> 00:15:47,062
Such is the fate that befalls those who are weak.

256
00:15:47,163 --> 00:15:49,468
Don't like it? Make yourself strong.

257
00:15:49,964 --> 00:15:54,224
What do I do? There's no way I could
obey an order to slaughter those people,

258
00:15:54,503 --> 00:15:57,014
nor can I stand with those so ready to do so!

259
00:15:58,687 --> 00:15:59,949
Well, that's the story.

260
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:03,652
It's pretty sick how she drilled hate
into those people before letting them go.

261
00:16:04,092 --> 00:16:08,447
Hang on though, from the empire's side,
seems like she was instigating the rebellion.

262
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:11,172
Yep, that's exactly what Esdeath was trying to do.

263
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,353
She wanted to stir up another uprising.

264
00:16:13,658 --> 00:16:16,270
That way she could get her
kicks on the battlefield forever.

265
00:16:16,688 --> 00:16:18,290
She sounds like a lunatic!

266
00:16:19,332 --> 00:16:20,578
That was a close one.

267
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:23,908
I made the right choice when I
didn't pick a fight with her by myself.

268
00:16:24,855 --> 00:16:28,691
I mean, you would have to murder like
millions of people to get a reputation like hers.

269
00:16:28,716 --> 00:16:31,704
The way you guys are talking
about her, she must be a monster!

270
00:16:32,335 --> 00:16:34,336
You can check her out for yourself if you want.

271
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:36,549
She's sponsoring a martial arts tournament.

272
00:16:37,442 --> 00:16:39,144
There's a cash prize for the winner.

273
00:16:39,435 --> 00:16:41,705
So you could earn some money for
your village while you're at it.

274
00:16:44,415 --> 00:16:45,683
Uh, Minister...

275
00:16:45,783 --> 00:16:49,916
Why do you think General Esdeath is so
interested in falling in love all of a sudden?

276
00:16:49,996 --> 00:16:54,043
Everyone begins to have these
feelings once they reach a certain age.

277
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,707
General Esdeath was born to fight.

278
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,444
She has cared for nothing but war.

279
00:17:00,498 --> 00:17:04,281
Now, she's awakening to her carnal desires.

280
00:17:04,306 --> 00:17:05,169
Interesting.

281
00:17:05,269 --> 00:17:08,104
It would be wonderful to locate a match for her.

282
00:17:08,306 --> 00:17:10,532
She's an incredibly prideful woman.

283
00:17:10,557 --> 00:17:14,367
She won't waste any time on a
suitor who doesn't meet her criteria.

284
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,365
But how will we ever find a man like this?

285
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:20,980
Number One: Above all else, he must have potential.

286
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,721
I'd like to personally train him to become a general.

287
00:17:24,008 --> 00:17:28,800
Number Two: He must have composure
and be able to hunt Danger Beasts.

288
00:17:28,973 --> 00:17:33,932
Number Three: Like me, he must have been
raised in the frontier rather than the capital.

289
00:17:34,032 --> 00:17:37,908
"Number Four: I want someone
younger so I can dominate him."

290
00:17:37,982 --> 00:17:41,394
"Number Five: He must be someone
with a pure and innocent smile."

291
00:17:43,551 --> 00:17:46,821
The majority of people won't
even get past condition number one!

292
00:17:47,408 --> 00:17:51,575
Yes, there aren't many men with
the potential to become generals.

293
00:18:00,892 --> 00:18:02,950
What do you think of the contenders, General?

294
00:18:03,077 --> 00:18:06,167
They're nothing but pathetic rabble
floundering through a street fight.

295
00:18:06,397 --> 00:18:09,783
I seriously doubt we'll find
anyone who can wield an Imperial Arms.

296
00:18:10,435 --> 00:18:12,303
Oh, it looks like these two are finished.

297
00:18:12,403 --> 00:18:14,505
And the victory goes to Nobunaga!

298
00:18:14,605 --> 00:18:15,942
That's how it goes!

299
00:18:16,035 --> 00:18:18,554
This next bout is going to be the final match.

300
00:18:19,971 --> 00:18:20,963
To my left:

301
00:18:21,032 --> 00:18:22,322
Kalbi the Butcher!

302
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,589
To my right:

303
00:18:23,689 --> 00:18:25,130
Tatsumi the Blacksmith!

304
00:18:25,349 --> 00:18:26,910
He picked an interesting fake job.

305
00:18:26,956 --> 00:18:28,503
Think he knows anything about blacksmithing?

306
00:18:28,553 --> 00:18:29,955
Well, he's not as good as me,

307
00:18:30,487 --> 00:18:32,023
but I guess he's decent with his hands.

308
00:18:32,369 --> 00:18:34,396
I see one of them is pretty young.

309
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:39,472
Well, look at you, little fella!

310
00:18:39,497 --> 00:18:42,676
Looks like that prize money is as good as mine!

311
00:18:42,883 --> 00:18:45,149
I trained at Imperial Fist Temple.

312
00:18:45,174 --> 00:18:47,757
I was second degree when they kicked me out!

313
00:18:48,081 --> 00:18:51,303
The big fella's not all talk. He looks pretty strong.

314
00:18:52,084 --> 00:18:54,295
He might've intimidated me a few months ago,

315
00:18:55,032 --> 00:18:56,643
but I'm a lot different now.

316
00:18:57,356 --> 00:19:00,860
Compared to those Three Beasts I
fought before, this guy is nothing!

317
00:19:03,278 --> 00:19:04,149
You may begin!

318
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:08,203
You will feel the full force of my Explosive Iron Fists!

319
00:19:08,228 --> 00:19:10,215
I can beat this guy without Incursio!

320
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,248
Yah!

321
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,260
Hyah!

322
00:19:18,415 --> 00:19:19,401
Yaaahhh!

323
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:37,382
Yah!

324
00:19:43,134 --> 00:19:45,715
He might be small, but he's rather talented.

325
00:19:46,137 --> 00:19:47,048
Yes...

326
00:19:47,278 --> 00:19:48,639
And there you have it!

327
00:19:49,027 --> 00:19:50,319
Tatsumi wins!

328
00:19:54,506 --> 00:19:56,365
Are all these people cheering for me?

329
00:19:58,069 --> 00:19:59,231
This is awesome!

330
00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:04,965
He's the one.

331
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,267
He's our Imperial Arms candidate?

332
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:10,214
Oh, yes, that. But that's not all.

333
00:20:10,427 --> 00:20:11,305
Commander?

334
00:20:15,184 --> 00:20:17,135
She's coming into the ring herself?!

335
00:20:21,709 --> 00:20:25,359
Tatsumi? Is that right? That's a lovely name.

336
00:20:25,396 --> 00:20:26,525
Um, thank you.

337
00:20:26,945 --> 00:20:28,184
So this is Esdeath.

338
00:20:28,572 --> 00:20:30,073
The one everyone's talking about.

339
00:20:32,928 --> 00:20:35,700
If it weren't for her, we wouldn't have lost Bro.

340
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,686
You put on an impressive show.

341
00:20:37,926 --> 00:20:39,695
Now, for your reward...

342
00:20:39,981 --> 00:20:41,863
Oh, uh, thank you very much, ma'am.

343
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:44,766
No matter how you get it, money is still money.

344
00:20:45,193 --> 00:20:46,681
And I have no problem taking it.

345
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:49,549
Huh?

346
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:53,015
Starting today, you'll be mine and mine alone.

347
00:20:53,156 --> 00:20:54,221
Uh, wait a sec-.

348
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,001
Let's go somewhere we can be alone.

349
00:20:56,101 --> 00:20:57,635
Too many eyes around here.

350
00:20:57,735 --> 00:20:58,380
Stop it!

351
00:20:58,405 --> 00:21:00,004
Be a good boy. Okay?

352
00:21:00,311 --> 00:21:02,350
What'd... she do to me?

353
00:21:03,984 --> 00:21:05,849
We'll talk further in my room,

354
00:21:06,102 --> 00:21:07,569
just the two of us.

355
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,350
What the hell just happened?!

356
00:21:12,617 --> 00:21:14,934
So Esdeath took Tatsumi away with her?!

357
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:17,110
Has she figured out he's a member of Night Raid yet?

358
00:21:17,363 --> 00:21:21,124
I can't really say for sure. It's probably a 50/50 chance.

359
00:21:21,511 --> 00:21:24,595
The last thing we saw was her
trying to drag him into the palace.

360
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,241
What should we do now, Akame?

361
00:21:27,812 --> 00:21:28,631
Tatsumi...

362
00:21:28,932 --> 00:21:31,093
I won't ever make you sad again, Akame.

363
00:21:32,437 --> 00:21:35,073
Please don't say something
stupid like we need to save him.

364
00:21:35,098 --> 00:21:36,023
That won't work.

365
00:21:36,848 --> 00:21:39,743
The first thing we should do is
move our base further from town.

366
00:21:39,903 --> 00:21:42,480
Good thinking. We're too easy to spot here.

367
00:21:42,547 --> 00:21:44,282
Okay, but what about Tatsumi?

368
00:21:44,802 --> 00:21:46,451
I'm not trying to say you would, but...

369
00:21:46,551 --> 00:21:47,565
No, I understand.

370
00:21:48,105 --> 00:21:50,121
I won't go charging in without a plan.

371
00:21:50,398 --> 00:21:52,753
But Tatsumi is still a member of our team!

372
00:21:52,891 --> 00:21:54,470
Do whatever it takes!
