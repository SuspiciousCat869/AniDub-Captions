1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,186
Is this the bandit fort we've been looking for?

2
00:00:04,211 --> 00:00:05,106
Uh-huh!

3
00:00:05,434 --> 00:00:09,361
Our first mission as Jaegers
is to tear this unsightly place apart.

4
00:00:09,386 --> 00:00:10,887
How shall we go about it?

5
00:00:11,082 --> 00:00:12,908
Justice should always be direct.

6
00:00:13,029 --> 00:00:14,388
Strike from the front!

7
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:15,372
Hm...

8
00:00:16,768 --> 00:00:17,254
Hmm...

9
00:00:20,215 --> 00:00:22,783
So uh, why'd you bring me here?

10
00:00:23,243 --> 00:00:25,183
You're part of the Jaeger reserves.

11
00:00:25,368 --> 00:00:28,613
I suggest you watch and learn for future reference.

12
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:32,207
Uh! That's the bitch who killed Sheele!

13
00:00:33,388 --> 00:00:35,055
I can't lose my head right now.

14
00:00:35,188 --> 00:00:36,868
Remember what Bro said...

15
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:39,283
it takes more than passion to survive.

16
00:00:39,657 --> 00:00:41,338
I have to get back to base.

17
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,728
I have to get back and report everything!

18
00:00:44,282 --> 00:00:44,781
Oh...

19
00:00:45,915 --> 00:00:46,761
This could be...

20
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:49,295
the perfect chance to get away.

21
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:51,332
Uh...

22
00:00:52,502 --> 00:00:53,272
Mmm...

23
00:00:54,355 --> 00:00:56,256
Oh shit, not anymore!

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,837
You're pretty stupid to attack us head-on.

25
00:01:00,942 --> 00:01:02,377
Koro! Phase 5!

26
00:01:06,855 --> 00:01:07,532
Hehe...

27
00:01:07,849 --> 00:01:08,921
Kill them!

28
00:01:10,302 --> 00:01:12,153
Judgement of the Ten Kings!

29
00:01:12,362 --> 00:01:14,484
Devil King's Justice Lance!

30
00:01:14,757 --> 00:01:15,604
Next!

31
00:01:15,741 --> 00:01:17,017
Phase 7!

32
00:01:18,108 --> 00:01:20,913
Cannon of Justice!

33
00:01:23,061 --> 00:01:26,667
Hehehe. All those weapons are my fabulous designs.

34
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,938
The Hands of God, "Perfector", stylishly increases
the wearer's dexterity hundreds of times over!

35
00:01:31,963 --> 00:01:35,237
Oooh, I am just living for this Imperial Arms!

36
00:01:39,782 --> 00:01:40,949
After all the fighting,

37
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:43,011
I'll get to play with your body parts.

38
00:01:44,128 --> 00:01:45,926
Like precious little dolls.

39
00:01:47,678 --> 00:01:48,578
Ahh!

40
00:01:49,722 --> 00:01:50,258
Uh?

41
00:01:52,115 --> 00:01:54,285
You don't have to thank me for saving your ass.

42
00:01:54,441 --> 00:01:55,563
We're a team y'know.

43
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:57,351
No. I knew he was there.

44
00:01:57,376 --> 00:01:58,611
Oh yeah, right.

45
00:02:00,124 --> 00:02:02,190
The flamethrower Imperial Arms,

46
00:02:02,215 --> 00:02:04,840
"Invitation to Purgatory Rubicante."

47
00:02:05,136 --> 00:02:07,104
Nothing personal guys, okay?

48
00:02:13,181 --> 00:02:14,799
An angel...

49
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:17,592
Wing-type Imperial Arms,

50
00:02:17,617 --> 00:02:19,665
"Soaring for Miles, Mastema."

51
00:02:20,218 --> 00:02:22,582
I cannot allow a single one of you to live.

52
00:02:29,495 --> 00:02:30,161
Hmm...

53
00:04:05,262 --> 00:04:06,295
Whoa...

54
00:04:07,095 --> 00:04:07,901
Tatsumi.

55
00:04:08,322 --> 00:04:08,678
Hm?

56
00:04:08,702 --> 00:04:10,548
Soon you'll be able to do that too.

57
00:04:10,813 --> 00:04:12,227
I'm going to train you.

58
00:04:13,888 --> 00:04:15,415
That's awfully generous of you.

59
00:04:15,781 --> 00:04:18,018
I'm not like all the rumors say I am.

60
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:21,364
To be honest, I haven't been quite myself lately.

61
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:24,359
I've started to experience love.

62
00:04:25,028 --> 00:04:27,260
And well, it feels good.

63
00:04:27,407 --> 00:04:27,987
Hm...

64
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:30,627
Maybe this means...

65
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:33,452
I might be able to convince her to join our side.

66
00:04:34,262 --> 00:04:34,896
Yeah!

67
00:04:35,385 --> 00:04:35,962
I mean...

68
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:38,500
I could never forgive her for everything she's done,

69
00:04:38,926 --> 00:04:41,732
but if she could change her ways
and help us overthrow the Empire...

70
00:04:43,915 --> 00:04:45,776
Okay, I'll win her over tonight!

71
00:04:46,082 --> 00:04:48,888
Come on, Tatsumi, turn on that manly charm.

72
00:05:03,272 --> 00:05:05,843
Things got hot and heavy a little quicker than I thought!

73
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,523
Uh! Snap out of it, man!!

74
00:05:12,757 --> 00:05:14,529
Okay. Don't freak out.

75
00:05:14,756 --> 00:05:16,551
Just convince her to join the revolution!

76
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:19,839
Do it. Take control! Take her down like a tomcat!

77
00:05:20,859 --> 00:05:23,028
I must not let her intimidate me!

78
00:05:27,874 --> 00:05:29,047
Sorry for the wait.

79
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,384
No, no it didn't take that long at all!

80
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:32,362
Can I get you a drink?

81
00:05:32,462 --> 00:05:34,736
Uh, no, no! I think I'm fine.

82
00:05:34,857 --> 00:05:36,774
Hm? You seem a bit nervous.

83
00:05:36,801 --> 00:05:38,607
Huh? No! What, I'm not nervous!

84
00:05:38,693 --> 00:05:40,986
Mm... Aren't you just adorable?

85
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,109
Well, I don't know very much about these feelings either.

86
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:48,437
It'll all work out if we just let our bodies take over.

87
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,023
Uh... So, I uh...

88
00:05:51,495 --> 00:05:52,698
I wanted to ask you.

89
00:05:53,357 --> 00:05:54,382
Miss Esdeath.

90
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:57,474
You like me don't you?

91
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,732
If I didn't, then I wouldn't be in this bed with you.

92
00:06:06,758 --> 00:06:09,520
Um... in that case, could you just hear me out real quick?

93
00:06:09,567 --> 00:06:11,857
Hm? Of course, what's on your mind?

94
00:06:12,424 --> 00:06:14,403
To be intimate we must know each other.

95
00:06:16,707 --> 00:06:19,065
It's just, the Empire's kind of a mess right now.

96
00:06:19,165 --> 00:06:21,947
I imagine a lot of citizens
would agree with you about that.

97
00:06:22,247 --> 00:06:23,162
What's your point?

98
00:06:23,255 --> 00:06:24,982
If I'm gonna be doing this kind of work,

99
00:06:25,022 --> 00:06:27,657
I think maybe I should be part of the Revolutionary Army.

100
00:06:28,077 --> 00:06:30,711
And I'd really like it if you
and I could join them together.

101
00:06:31,284 --> 00:06:33,415
Just think of all the lives we could save that way!

102
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:35,330
Tatsumi.

103
00:06:37,489 --> 00:06:38,016
Uh...

104
00:06:39,802 --> 00:06:43,859
You do realize that you're speaking
to a General in the Imperial Army.

105
00:06:44,132 --> 00:06:46,729
I know this may sound completely ridiculous to you,

106
00:06:46,921 --> 00:06:48,281
but unless things change,

107
00:06:48,406 --> 00:06:50,214
we could end up having to fight each other!

108
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:51,619
Uh!

109
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:54,467
There's no need for you to worry about that.

110
00:06:55,073 --> 00:06:57,626
I'll be keeping you by my side forever.

111
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:01,180
I know you're unsatisfied with the life you once knew.

112
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:03,786
But with me you'll never need to want for anything.

113
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,129
And I promise I shall be faithful.

114
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,951
I won't even look at another man.

115
00:07:10,437 --> 00:07:12,322
You'll never feel alone again.

116
00:07:12,535 --> 00:07:13,188
Oh...

117
00:07:14,328 --> 00:07:16,461
It's not that I don't appreciate the sentiment,

118
00:07:16,929 --> 00:07:18,162
but I can't.

119
00:07:18,657 --> 00:07:21,282
It's not right if I'm the only one who finds happiness.

120
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:22,754
So you have a family then?

121
00:07:22,873 --> 00:07:25,093
I can offer them full protection too.

122
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:26,204
That's not it.

123
00:07:26,924 --> 00:07:31,272
Listen, I want to live in a nation where
everyone can enjoy their ordinary lives.

124
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:35,437
So, that's why this messed-up
Empire needs to be torn down.

125
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:36,477
Tatsumi.

126
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:38,227
Don't you understand?

127
00:07:38,252 --> 00:07:41,404
Of course not! I feel no empathy for the fragile.

128
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,838
"The strong feast upon the flesh of the weak."

129
00:07:45,012 --> 00:07:46,558
That's the law of the land!

130
00:07:46,644 --> 00:07:49,956
Those who die, are not strong enough to survive.

131
00:07:49,981 --> 00:07:53,362
No. There's no way I could fall in
love with anyone who thinks that way!

132
00:07:53,387 --> 00:07:57,579
If you care about me even a little bit,
then please! You have to learn to love life!

133
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,874
That face... I love it...

134
00:08:02,067 --> 00:08:04,939
Tatsumi, that'll never happen.

135
00:08:05,866 --> 00:08:07,216
Understand something.

136
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,322
You're never going to change who I am.

137
00:08:09,347 --> 00:08:11,382
You will be the one changing for me!

138
00:08:11,662 --> 00:08:12,918
That's all there is to it!

139
00:08:12,943 --> 00:08:16,127
You can't expect me to change what I
believe just because you tell me to!

140
00:08:16,299 --> 00:08:17,560
Even if you torture me!

141
00:08:18,013 --> 00:08:20,097
Hm, you're so headstrong.

142
00:08:20,717 --> 00:08:24,866
Perhaps that's why he was able to smile so freely.

143
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,383
I must have his heart.

144
00:08:27,723 --> 00:08:30,387
I must have Tatsumi as my own!

145
00:08:31,847 --> 00:08:35,156
Well, I'm sure you must be tired after today.

146
00:08:35,489 --> 00:08:37,045
We'll discuss it more tomorrow.

147
00:08:37,238 --> 00:08:38,862
For now we should get some sleep.

148
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:39,780
Ehh...

149
00:08:40,426 --> 00:08:42,654
Okay, I'll be over here on the sofa.

150
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:45,696
You can sleep in the bed tonight;
I won't do anything to you!

151
00:08:46,533 --> 00:08:47,628
Oh yeah!

152
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:49,070
Then I should probably take a shower!

153
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,190
Just so you know.

154
00:08:50,215 --> 00:08:54,162
If you wander around the palace or make
any attempt to leave, you will be executed.

155
00:08:54,627 --> 00:08:56,711
Please do not try anything foolish.

156
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,474
Don't worry about me...

157
00:08:59,427 --> 00:09:00,294
That's true,

158
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:03,353
the guys warned me about how dangerous the palace is.

159
00:09:06,343 --> 00:09:09,289
Ah. I should've had us shower together.

160
00:09:10,235 --> 00:09:12,674
Well, no reason to rush things.

161
00:09:14,308 --> 00:09:17,180
Therefore, not only is he a part of our reserves;

162
00:09:17,234 --> 00:09:19,708
Tatsumi here is also going to be my lover.

163
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:23,878
Now, if any of you are married or in
a relationship, please raise your hand.

164
00:09:26,226 --> 00:09:28,277
Don't tell me you have a girlfriend!

165
00:09:28,357 --> 00:09:31,214
A lovely wife of six years, actually!

166
00:09:31,433 --> 00:09:34,393
She's such a wonderful woman; I really don't deserve her!

167
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:35,952
Then maybe you can help me.

168
00:09:36,372 --> 00:09:40,095
What can I do to encourage
Tatsumi to return my affections?

169
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,188
Ooh, the trick is to never giving up!

170
00:09:42,467 --> 00:09:43,865
I'll tell you a secret.

171
00:09:44,132 --> 00:09:49,137
My dear wife turned me down twice before I
found the perfect moment and swept her off her feet!

172
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,512
So bear in mind that it may take some time.

173
00:09:52,699 --> 00:09:54,507
But it will be worth it.

174
00:09:54,567 --> 00:09:55,740
That's very helpful.

175
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,736
Well, I can certainly be determined.

176
00:10:00,668 --> 00:10:03,641
You will fall for me in the end, Tatsumi.

177
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:06,199
It'll be a fun little game.

178
00:10:10,498 --> 00:10:11,051
Hm?

179
00:10:11,608 --> 00:10:13,558
Hey! How did you sleep last ni-.

180
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:16,012
Oh wow, you didn't sleep at all.

181
00:10:16,045 --> 00:10:18,871
No, I was so nervous I stayed awake until the sun came up.

182
00:10:19,404 --> 00:10:21,105
She said she wouldn't do anything,

183
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:23,196
but when I woke up she was spooning me!

184
00:10:23,703 --> 00:10:26,135
You sure do start snacking early in the day, Kurome.

185
00:10:26,295 --> 00:10:27,684
Mind your own business.

186
00:10:27,944 --> 00:10:30,502
You should try to eat more
seafood, it's really good for you.

187
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,914
I wouldn't want to smell like
fish all the time like you do.

188
00:10:32,939 --> 00:10:35,176
What? Really? Do I smell like fish?

189
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,951
Oh, uh, no not really, yeah you kinda do.

190
00:10:38,482 --> 00:10:38,984
Hm?

191
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,061
Something about the way that girl looks...

192
00:10:43,103 --> 00:10:44,396
and her name Kurome,

193
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,569
she just seems familiar somehow.

194
00:10:46,894 --> 00:10:47,431
Uh!

195
00:10:48,571 --> 00:10:50,421
Keep your eyes off of my cookies!

196
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,878
And she's so protective of her food!

197
00:10:53,091 --> 00:10:55,430
Yep, she must be related to Akame!

198
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:56,181
Gotta problem?

199
00:10:56,206 --> 00:11:01,291
Oh, uh... Please don't be offended, but you really
look like that Akame girl from the wanted posters.

200
00:11:01,612 --> 00:11:03,837
Right! I noticed that earlier too!

201
00:11:03,884 --> 00:11:06,681
Well yeah. I'm related to that goody-two-shoes.

202
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,537
But now she's a traitor to the Empire.

203
00:11:09,963 --> 00:11:12,361
I do hope I run into her again soon.

204
00:11:12,824 --> 00:11:13,740
You know why?

205
00:11:14,178 --> 00:11:17,028
So I can be reunited with my dear sister...

206
00:11:17,122 --> 00:11:19,268
And kill her with my bare hands.

207
00:11:19,573 --> 00:11:20,079
Uh.

208
00:11:23,271 --> 00:11:25,436
Tatsumi! We're off to Fake Mount.

209
00:11:25,481 --> 00:11:27,383
We'll spend the next few days hunting.

210
00:11:27,643 --> 00:11:28,578
Where's Fake-Mount?

211
00:11:28,931 --> 00:11:30,127
You've never been there?

212
00:11:30,249 --> 00:11:32,693
It's in the range beyond the outskirts of the Capital.

213
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,234
We're going to the country!

214
00:11:34,281 --> 00:11:35,472
I can finally escape!

215
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:37,309
You two will be joining us.

216
00:11:37,469 --> 00:11:40,057
We're hunting Danger Beasts as well as bandits.

217
00:11:40,144 --> 00:11:40,924
Roger that.

218
00:11:41,044 --> 00:11:43,525
Kurome and I will take the east throughout the day.

219
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,958
Wave and Tatsumi, you're in charge of the west.

220
00:11:46,091 --> 00:11:47,580
We'll exchange partners at night.

221
00:11:47,605 --> 00:11:49,061
So Tatsumi will be with me.

222
00:11:49,085 --> 00:11:49,747
Eh?

223
00:11:49,772 --> 00:11:53,180
The monsters that come out at
night are especially vicious.

224
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,446
It'll be my chance to impress him!

225
00:12:04,294 --> 00:12:07,995
I didn't want to say this in front of the
team, but you've got it pretty rough, don't you?

226
00:12:08,755 --> 00:12:10,395
Let me know if you ever need to vent.

227
00:12:11,101 --> 00:12:12,983
Uh, thanks a lot.

228
00:12:13,361 --> 00:12:16,828
But I'll be okay; I mean, I was already
used to being treated like that anyway.

229
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:19,041
Yeah. Trust me, I understand that.

230
00:12:19,154 --> 00:12:22,169
I just get this weird feeling you
and I are kinda similar, don't you?

231
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,598
Similar? What do the two of us have in common?

232
00:12:24,623 --> 00:12:27,679
Huh? Uh... I'm not sure how to explain it.

233
00:12:28,028 --> 00:12:30,028
It's like we deal with the same problems...

234
00:12:30,128 --> 00:12:32,606
or at least gonna deal with the same problems.

235
00:12:32,631 --> 00:12:34,645
Uh yeah. I totally get it.

236
00:12:34,828 --> 00:12:37,727
We're practically like brothers,
You and I are exactly the same.

237
00:12:37,813 --> 00:12:41,372
Well, let's work together! We
can share each other's pain and-Uh?

238
00:12:42,873 --> 00:12:43,670
Tatsumi?

239
00:12:45,227 --> 00:12:45,858
Uh..

240
00:12:47,662 --> 00:12:48,638
Gah!

241
00:12:48,663 --> 00:12:49,358
Look out!

242
00:12:52,561 --> 00:12:54,133
Whoa! Thanks for that!

243
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,693
No big deal.

244
00:12:56,413 --> 00:12:58,620
I just saved his life without even thinking about it.

245
00:12:58,774 --> 00:13:01,524
But, I should probably get outta here while I still can!

246
00:13:03,025 --> 00:13:04,859
They keep popping up outta nowhere!

247
00:13:05,128 --> 00:13:07,233
And they don't look edible like the ones on the coast.

248
00:13:08,028 --> 00:13:09,971
You ready? Let's wipe these suckers out!

249
00:13:14,621 --> 00:13:16,997
Phew... That wasn't so bad was it?

250
00:13:17,512 --> 00:13:18,939
You finished over there, Tatsumi?

251
00:13:19,261 --> 00:13:20,985
Uh... Tatsumi?

252
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:23,207
Wha... Where'd he go?

253
00:13:27,147 --> 00:13:30,362
Imperial Arms users probably don't
expect people to get away from them.

254
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,543
But since I have one too, that doesn't really apply to me.

255
00:13:35,561 --> 00:13:36,694
Tatsumi?

256
00:13:37,221 --> 00:13:38,275
Where are you?

257
00:13:39,028 --> 00:13:40,757
Ah! Did he make a break for it?!

258
00:13:41,034 --> 00:13:42,983
Nooooo!

259
00:13:43,267 --> 00:13:45,116
Dammit, dammit, dammit!

260
00:13:45,141 --> 00:13:47,868
I know how you must feel, but I can't let you get away!

261
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:49,308
I'm too young to die!

262
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:52,105
I guess it's time.

263
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:56,575
Grand Chariot!

264
00:14:03,001 --> 00:14:04,369
Maybe this is far enough.

265
00:14:05,361 --> 00:14:07,253
He wouldn't chase me all the way out here, right?

266
00:14:07,921 --> 00:14:08,406
Uh!

267
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,745
Wha... what was that?!

268
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,509
It's an armor type. Just like mine!

269
00:14:14,794 --> 00:14:16,571
Well, how about that?

270
00:14:16,596 --> 00:14:18,599
I can't believe what I'm seeing right now.

271
00:14:19,286 --> 00:14:20,688
That's Incursio, isn't it?

272
00:14:21,478 --> 00:14:23,353
It's the prototype for my armor!

273
00:14:23,841 --> 00:14:25,170
And most importantly...

274
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:29,056
If you have Incursio, that must
mean you're a member of the Night Raid!

275
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:30,203
Oh!

276
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:32,713
Time for a change of plans!

277
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:36,118
Killing a member of Night Raid is
way more important than finding Tatsumi.

278
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,059
And though my model is newer.

279
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,529
And supposed to have better stats.

280
00:14:44,961 --> 00:14:46,706
I should be cautious anyway.

281
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,553
Is that Wave in there?

282
00:14:49,281 --> 00:14:50,505
Or someone else?

283
00:14:51,707 --> 00:14:52,611
Either way...

284
00:14:53,704 --> 00:14:55,382
I'm screwed if Esdeath shows up!

285
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:57,121
I gotta get outta here!

286
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:57,881
Uh!

287
00:14:58,836 --> 00:15:00,074
You're not getting away.

288
00:15:00,521 --> 00:15:02,011
Now man up and fight!

289
00:15:04,454 --> 00:15:05,110
Stop it!

290
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,178
I don't have a reason to fight you!

291
00:15:07,203 --> 00:15:08,567
Yeah maybe you don't...

292
00:15:09,218 --> 00:15:11,495
but I sure as hell have a reason to fight you.

293
00:15:11,747 --> 00:15:13,408
You're Night Raid trash!

294
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,880
I read the file on you guys.

295
00:15:18,295 --> 00:15:20,165
You assassinate people at random.

296
00:15:20,565 --> 00:15:23,136
You threaten the safety of the Imperial Capital.

297
00:15:23,425 --> 00:15:26,610
And worst of all, you're working
with the Revolutionary Army!

298
00:15:26,883 --> 00:15:29,916
Criminals like you shouldn't be allowed to live.

299
00:15:32,175 --> 00:15:32,850
Shut up.

300
00:15:33,687 --> 00:15:35,681
It may be true that we're assassins.

301
00:15:36,467 --> 00:15:37,647
But I am not...

302
00:15:38,442 --> 00:15:39,755
We are not...

303
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,850
We are not the bad guys here!

304
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:43,974
What's he doing?

305
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,646
Takes more than passion to stay alive, you know!

306
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,340
Oh...

307
00:15:51,261 --> 00:15:51,918
That's right.

308
00:15:52,788 --> 00:15:56,655
No matter what, I have to make it back to
the base so I can tell everyone what I learned!

309
00:15:57,188 --> 00:15:58,694
If you're not gonna come after me,

310
00:15:58,908 --> 00:16:00,545
I'll just have to force the action!

311
00:16:00,618 --> 00:16:01,218
Crap!

312
00:16:01,287 --> 00:16:02,372
Grand Fall!

313
00:16:05,828 --> 00:16:07,044
That was a solid hit!

314
00:16:07,361 --> 00:16:08,728
I'll have to keep track of him.

315
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:10,836
I can't let him use the water to escape.

316
00:16:12,213 --> 00:16:13,067
Wait, where'd he go?

317
00:16:13,603 --> 00:16:14,471
Aw, crap...

318
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,497
He could be using the current to slip away.

319
00:16:17,662 --> 00:16:20,694
Nice try, but that'll never work on a man of the sea!

320
00:16:27,767 --> 00:16:30,420
Ugh... I didn't have to fight him after all.

321
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:33,019
I guess Grand Chariot can't go invisible.

322
00:16:37,007 --> 00:16:37,535
Uhh...

323
00:16:41,061 --> 00:16:41,612
Damn.

324
00:16:42,285 --> 00:16:44,061
That last kick was pretty brutal.

325
00:16:44,435 --> 00:16:47,110
Good thing I focused on defense
or that would have killed me.

326
00:16:48,347 --> 00:16:50,578
At least now I think I can finally go home.

327
00:16:52,241 --> 00:16:52,726
Huh?

328
00:16:55,994 --> 00:16:56,605
Woah!

329
00:16:57,321 --> 00:16:58,673
A Danger Beast?!

330
00:16:58,881 --> 00:17:01,647
Shit! Why did you have to show up right now?!

331
00:17:01,694 --> 00:17:03,549
Ugh! This isn't good...

332
00:17:03,574 --> 00:17:05,287
I'm too weak to fight after all that.

333
00:17:05,594 --> 00:17:06,360
This is it!

334
00:17:09,088 --> 00:17:09,663
Uh!

335
00:17:10,128 --> 00:17:11,516
A-Akame?!

336
00:17:12,594 --> 00:17:14,618
Tatsumi. Are you okay?

337
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:16,224
How did you find me?

338
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,514
We were doing everything we could to keep an eye on you.

339
00:17:19,794 --> 00:17:22,047
Wow, you guys really did that?

340
00:17:22,489 --> 00:17:24,347
All that trouble just for me?

341
00:17:25,012 --> 00:17:28,483
Sorry, guess you ended up saving me again, huh?

342
00:17:29,371 --> 00:17:30,024
Ow!

343
00:17:32,003 --> 00:17:33,665
I'll always be there to save you.

344
00:17:34,118 --> 00:17:35,452
Because you're my friend.

345
00:17:39,075 --> 00:17:39,613
Hm...

346
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:41,354
Akame...

347
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:42,385
What's wrong?

348
00:17:42,794 --> 00:17:44,661
Nothing. I'm just relieved

349
00:17:45,078 --> 00:17:46,266
to see your face.

350
00:17:46,614 --> 00:17:47,163
Hm...

351
00:17:49,807 --> 00:17:51,318
Welcome back, Tatsumi.

352
00:17:52,131 --> 00:17:54,133
Yeah. Good to be back.

353
00:17:55,803 --> 00:17:57,269
Whooo!

354
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,015
C'mon, we don't have time for sweet talk!

355
00:18:00,114 --> 00:18:01,417
Hurry up, we're going this way!

356
00:18:04,285 --> 00:18:05,785
Thanks for your help back there, Lubb.

357
00:18:06,078 --> 00:18:09,617
Yeah, no sweat. It was kinda my fault
for bringing up that stupid tournament.

358
00:18:10,063 --> 00:18:12,538
If anything happened to you,
then I'd be the only guy left!

359
00:18:13,118 --> 00:18:15,441
Well, maybe that'd be okay, I'd have my own harem!

360
00:18:15,974 --> 00:18:17,379
Man, you're hopeless.

361
00:18:17,821 --> 00:18:19,147
Don't you listen to him;

362
00:18:19,172 --> 00:18:21,160
He was worried sick about you the whole time.

363
00:18:22,915 --> 00:18:24,348
Yeah, I know.

364
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,081
Night Raid...

365
00:18:26,628 --> 00:18:28,094
when I'm with these guys...

366
00:18:28,627 --> 00:18:30,306
it really does feel like home.

367
00:18:32,258 --> 00:18:34,104
Uh, I don't know what else to say.

368
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,753
Except I'm very sorry for what happened, okay?!

369
00:18:37,719 --> 00:18:40,633
General Esdeath, I humbly beg your forgiveness!

370
00:18:40,678 --> 00:18:43,520
Tatsumi got away because you weren't paying attention.

371
00:18:43,678 --> 00:18:47,899
What I cannot overlook, is that a member
of Night Raid slipped through your fingers.

372
00:18:48,144 --> 00:18:49,685
Kurome, more weight!

373
00:18:49,824 --> 00:18:50,376
M-hm.

374
00:18:50,401 --> 00:18:51,301
Ahhh!

375
00:18:51,404 --> 00:18:53,286
Oh my dear Wave.

376
00:18:53,858 --> 00:18:57,743
Your technique is impeccable but it's
worthless if you don't use your head.

377
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,203
Please try to correct this.

378
00:18:59,228 --> 00:18:59,940
Okay...

379
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,548
Oh and next time you disappoint me...

380
00:19:03,168 --> 00:19:05,936
I will be delivering your punishment myself.

381
00:19:06,262 --> 00:19:07,906
Is that perfectly clear?

382
00:19:07,931 --> 00:19:08,777
Yes, ma'am.

383
00:19:08,983 --> 00:19:11,132
Commander! Deepest apologies!

384
00:19:11,197 --> 00:19:13,163
Koro hasn't been able to track him down yet!

385
00:19:13,188 --> 00:19:15,382
Hekatonkeiru is built for combat.

386
00:19:15,593 --> 00:19:16,801
Don't let it upset you.

387
00:19:17,117 --> 00:19:18,468
Where's Dr. Stylish?

388
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:20,460
We still haven't heard from him.

389
00:19:20,991 --> 00:19:23,199
Well, I'm sure he's found nothing.

390
00:19:23,468 --> 00:19:24,241
Commander.

391
00:19:24,999 --> 00:19:28,403
May I ask a question concerning
the young man you're interested in?

392
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,675
If he did turn out to be an enemy,

393
00:19:31,097 --> 00:19:33,172
then how would you like us to proceed?

394
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:37,784
Honestly, I still care for Tatsumi very much.

395
00:19:38,124 --> 00:19:41,614
The harder something is to get,
the more desirable it becomes.

396
00:19:41,697 --> 00:19:45,111
However, the lives of my subordinates are more valuable.

397
00:19:45,615 --> 00:19:49,507
I'd prefer if you took him alive, but
I'm giving you permission to kill him.

398
00:19:49,532 --> 00:19:50,802
As you wish, Commander.

399
00:19:50,827 --> 00:19:54,579
Tatsumi's been infected with evil, so
we should just vanquish him right away!

400
00:19:54,687 --> 00:19:58,824
Tatsumi, if they actually manage to
kill you, you aren't much of a man.

401
00:19:59,994 --> 00:20:01,783
But you're stronger than that, aren't you?

402
00:20:02,921 --> 00:20:05,669
You're powerful. A survivor.

403
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:09,166
I feel it, Tatsumi.

404
00:20:09,706 --> 00:20:12,771
I can't help but believe our paths might cross again.

405
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:16,267
No, I'll make sure of it.

406
00:20:16,574 --> 00:20:21,063
And when they do, I'll force
you to accept my feelings for you.

407
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,068
I'm coming for you, my love.

408
00:20:26,301 --> 00:20:29,382
And that's everything I found out
about the Jaegers and their weapons.

409
00:20:29,707 --> 00:20:30,875
Gahhh!

410
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,390
So all of those guys can use Imperial Arms?

411
00:20:33,415 --> 00:20:34,691
Man, this blows.

412
00:20:34,722 --> 00:20:36,972
I still can't believe Kurome's one of them.

413
00:20:36,997 --> 00:20:39,834
But when you left the Empire, why
didn't you bring your sister too?

414
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:41,632
I asked her to come with me.

415
00:20:42,187 --> 00:20:43,951
But she decided to stay behind.

416
00:20:45,147 --> 00:20:47,141
So from Kurome's perspective,

417
00:20:47,515 --> 00:20:49,927
I'm just another traitor who ran from the Empire.

418
00:20:50,453 --> 00:20:52,582
I bet when Zanku showed her that illusion,

419
00:20:52,741 --> 00:20:53,886
it was of Kurome.

420
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:58,519
Well. Now that you've seen those jerks
up close and personal, what's your opinion?

421
00:20:59,107 --> 00:21:00,574
If we're talking one-on-one,

422
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:02,938
I don't think any of the Jaegers are tougher than we are.

423
00:21:03,175 --> 00:21:03,972
It's just...

424
00:21:04,373 --> 00:21:05,165
Esdeath.

425
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,969
I've never seen anything like her.

426
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:10,883
As of now, I really don't think
I stand a chance against her.

427
00:21:10,908 --> 00:21:12,663
Esdeath may have amazing power.

428
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,735
But she still has a weakness.

429
00:21:15,255 --> 00:21:16,399
And what's that?

430
00:21:16,714 --> 00:21:17,814
She's alive.

431
00:21:18,387 --> 00:21:20,216
Her heart is beating as we speak.

432
00:21:21,174 --> 00:21:23,786
Therefore, I can still kill her.

433
00:21:24,581 --> 00:21:27,320
I don't care if she's the
strongest, most evil person on Earth!

434
00:21:32,189 --> 00:21:36,153
Aw, how precious that they tried to
cover their scent and hide their footprints!

435
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:39,511
But since I brought my super-enhanced
soldiers, it won't do any good.

436
00:21:40,252 --> 00:21:44,195
Hehe... I knew there was
something trig funky about that boy.

437
00:21:44,242 --> 00:21:47,559
You wouldn't expect a blacksmith
to adjust that quickly, am I right?

438
00:21:49,211 --> 00:21:50,278
Bingo!

439
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:53,699
Peekaboo, Night Raid, I see you.
