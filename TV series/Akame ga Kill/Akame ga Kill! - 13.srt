1
00:00:01,747 --> 00:00:06,535
I heard a rumor that people have been seeing
a new type of Danger-Beast around here lately.

2
00:00:07,095 --> 00:00:10,087
Be careful. I don't want you going out by yourself.

3
00:00:10,328 --> 00:00:12,830
I know, dear, don't you worry about me.

4
00:00:28,252 --> 00:00:30,536
No... no please... don't hurt me!

5
00:02:05,507 --> 00:02:10,721
Thanks to the Jaegers, the number of bandits
near the imperial capital has drastically decreased.

6
00:02:10,858 --> 00:02:13,953
And Night Raid has kept a low profile as of late.

7
00:02:14,215 --> 00:02:16,044
They must be quite afraid of you.

8
00:02:16,338 --> 00:02:18,094
We are pleased with your work!

9
00:02:18,133 --> 00:02:22,550
Yes. Once I discover the location of
their new base, they will be punished.

10
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:25,160
We have the utmost faith in you.

11
00:02:25,227 --> 00:02:28,922
But sadly, We haven't found a
suitor who meets your criteria yet.

12
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:32,209
Though I should mention the minister
here does have an unmarried son!

13
00:02:32,266 --> 00:02:33,967
I hear he has potential.

14
00:02:34,403 --> 00:02:38,613
Your Highness, as I stated in my
report, the position has been filled.

15
00:02:38,638 --> 00:02:40,652
You needn't concern yourself further.

16
00:02:40,839 --> 00:02:43,751
But didn't you tell Us that
he had vanished without a trace?

17
00:02:44,113 --> 00:02:46,315
How can you have a relationship like that?

18
00:02:46,415 --> 00:02:49,132
The pursuit has made me want him even more.

19
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,972
It seems this love is unfamiliar to me.

20
00:02:53,147 --> 00:02:54,534
Most intriguing!

21
00:02:54,582 --> 00:02:57,298
Not as much as you think, Your Grace.

22
00:02:58,327 --> 00:03:01,438
You seem to have rubbed off on the Emperor.

23
00:03:01,495 --> 00:03:05,068
He's been very interested in romance of late.

24
00:03:05,492 --> 00:03:10,419
I think he's well on his way to a
life of corruption and debauchery.

25
00:03:11,746 --> 00:03:17,593
My plan is to make sure the Emperor
enjoys the sweetest life possible.

26
00:03:17,885 --> 00:03:20,588
Just don't allow him to fall into any bad habits.

27
00:03:20,613 --> 00:03:24,015
Right. Anyway, I have a favor to ask of you.

28
00:03:24,452 --> 00:03:25,363
I'm listening.

29
00:03:26,555 --> 00:03:30,708
A new species of Danger Beast
has appeared around the capital.

30
00:03:30,764 --> 00:03:33,100
I would like you to get rid of them.

31
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,099
Yes, I know.

32
00:03:34,542 --> 00:03:37,464
I've already started investigating that for myself.

33
00:03:38,386 --> 00:03:42,512
Until recently, creatures like these
only lived in forests and in the mines.

34
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:47,595
But just days ago, a few forced their way
into a couple's home and devoured them alive.

35
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,710
I heard that.

36
00:03:48,997 --> 00:03:52,620
They're also said to bear a resemblance to human beings.

37
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:56,476
We could have a lot of fun with these new toys, yes?

38
00:03:57,065 --> 00:04:03,459
Great General Budo has ordered that they all
be destroyed, but I would love to examine them.

39
00:04:03,926 --> 00:04:04,945
As you wish.

40
00:04:05,633 --> 00:04:09,097
After hearing how deadly they are,
I don't think I can resist hunting them.

41
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:11,830
I suppose I could catch two or three for you.

42
00:04:12,267 --> 00:04:15,711
Please forward the reward money to
the soldiers I have stationed up north.

43
00:04:16,237 --> 00:04:20,534
You truly are a benevolent leader, aren't you, General?

44
00:04:22,116 --> 00:04:26,272
A soldier is more likely to fight to
the death for a commander he respects.

45
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,405
And when you consider that idea,

46
00:04:28,442 --> 00:04:32,188
it's easy to see why my forces are
considered the strongest in the nation.

47
00:04:33,614 --> 00:04:35,074
That's comforting.

48
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,273
Please pick out a few feisty ones for me.

49
00:04:39,995 --> 00:04:40,676
Hurry up!

50
00:04:41,076 --> 00:04:42,989
We need to reach the capital before dark.

51
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:47,066
I know, I know, I'm trying to. We gotta get
outta this area as soon as we possibly can!

52
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:50,929
What's that?!

53
00:04:50,953 --> 00:04:51,654
Oh, my God!

54
00:04:57,305 --> 00:04:58,232
Just in time.

55
00:05:01,396 --> 00:05:03,688
Now then, I'd better clean up.

56
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,348
Gentlemen, is everybody all right?

57
00:05:18,938 --> 00:05:24,373
Um, I went ahead and took out the Danger
Beasts for ya. So there's no need to be afraid.

58
00:05:24,492 --> 00:05:28,351
Be afraid... be afraid... be afraid.

59
00:05:29,004 --> 00:05:31,082
Worry not citizens, you're safe.

60
00:05:31,107 --> 00:05:33,609
They've been incinerated by the flames of justice!

61
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:35,212
Oh, thank you!

62
00:05:35,237 --> 00:05:37,939
You must be imperial officers from the capital, right?

63
00:05:37,964 --> 00:05:39,179
Oh we owe you one!

64
00:05:39,486 --> 00:05:41,910
So uh, that was kinda awkward, huh?

65
00:05:42,563 --> 00:05:44,296
You did a good thing, okay?

66
00:05:44,765 --> 00:05:46,826
Those... people...

67
00:05:47,428 --> 00:05:49,030
They can feel safe now!

68
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,238
Which is wonderful!

69
00:05:51,272 --> 00:05:51,702
Right?

70
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,687
There we go.

71
00:06:05,973 --> 00:06:09,343
Freezing these creatures was the
most effective way of capturing them.

72
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:14,546
It's true. I've never seen
this kind of Danger Beast before.

73
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,358
It's not a snack.

74
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:28,494
Wave, Kurome, the tea is ready.

75
00:06:28,663 --> 00:06:29,842
Oh thanks, Bols.

76
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:31,903
Uh, thank you for always waiting on us.

77
00:06:31,947 --> 00:06:33,748
No, no, don't mention it!

78
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,230
I like being helpful.

79
00:06:37,691 --> 00:06:38,939
What's the matter, Wave?

80
00:06:39,481 --> 00:06:41,250
It still just kind of bothers me.

81
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,269
I mean, you're a really nice person.

82
00:06:43,993 --> 00:06:49,212
But even when you killed the Danger Beasts and saved those
guys' lives, they still judged you based on how you look!

83
00:06:49,363 --> 00:06:51,438
Yeah, but you did the same thing.

84
00:06:53,937 --> 00:06:55,143
Crap, I did!

85
00:06:55,423 --> 00:06:57,721
Wave, I told you before.

86
00:06:57,859 --> 00:07:00,304
I'm not a... nice person.

87
00:07:01,951 --> 00:07:04,967
I've been to inflicted and diseased villages,

88
00:07:05,006 --> 00:07:06,695
and I've burned them to the ground.

89
00:07:07,303 --> 00:07:11,538
I was an executioner. I've burned
innocent men and women to ashes.

90
00:07:12,573 --> 00:07:14,976
I've done so many horrible things.

91
00:07:15,616 --> 00:07:18,459
I've lost count of the names of those who want me dead.

92
00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:21,836
But all you did was follow the
orders you were given, right?!

93
00:07:22,017 --> 00:07:26,083
What I do may just be a job, but karma is still karma.

94
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,950
I figure I'm only getting what I deserve:

95
00:07:29,457 --> 00:07:31,659
Reminders, retribution.

96
00:07:31,961 --> 00:07:34,469
But Bols, you shouldn't torture yourself like that!

97
00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:37,882
Listen, if you ever need a shoulder
to cry on, I'm right here okay!

98
00:07:39,108 --> 00:07:40,188
Daddy!

99
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,023
Huh? My girls!

100
00:07:42,048 --> 00:07:44,208
What are you lovely ladies doing here?

101
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:48,359
You big 'ol goofball, you left your lunch
sitting on the kitchen counter this morning.

102
00:07:48,603 --> 00:07:50,012
Oh, my goodness!

103
00:07:50,098 --> 00:07:52,411
Mommy, Daddy made a boo-boo!

104
00:07:55,203 --> 00:07:57,116
You have such a demanding job, sweetie.

105
00:07:57,198 --> 00:07:59,528
If you don't eat lunch, you might get too light-headed.

106
00:07:59,553 --> 00:08:00,582
Yes, dear.

107
00:08:00,788 --> 00:08:02,823
I'll be more careful next time.

108
00:08:03,018 --> 00:08:04,852
Daddy! Hold me!

109
00:08:04,953 --> 00:08:07,338
All right, c'mere, big girl!

110
00:08:08,964 --> 00:08:11,381
Look, I appreciate your concern, Wave.

111
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:18,341
But my wife and my daughter know all about the
things I do, and well, they still love me, no matter what.

112
00:08:19,061 --> 00:08:21,373
It's because of them that, y'know...

113
00:08:21,796 --> 00:08:23,912
That nothing out there is too much for me.

114
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:25,376
God, I can't even stand it!

115
00:08:25,567 --> 00:08:27,010
Turn down the love!

116
00:08:27,395 --> 00:08:30,800
Oh man, I think this is twice in a row
I've failed at comforting someone?

117
00:08:35,663 --> 00:08:37,773
Aww, daddy's little girl!

118
00:08:53,955 --> 00:08:57,427
Do not rely on simple brute force
when you try to hit something.

119
00:09:08,998 --> 00:09:13,236
No matter how resilient your opponent may
seem, there's always a weak spot somewhere.

120
00:09:13,895 --> 00:09:14,790
Whoa...

121
00:09:16,371 --> 00:09:20,086
Try to remember that the next time you're
in battle so you can disarm your enemy.

122
00:09:20,162 --> 00:09:21,225
Yeah, I will.

123
00:09:21,876 --> 00:09:25,982
But wait, do you think I'll be able to pull off
something like that in the middle of a fight?

124
00:09:26,448 --> 00:09:29,019
It always seems to present itself eventually.

125
00:09:29,484 --> 00:09:31,686
You must be pretty observant then, huh, Su?

126
00:09:31,861 --> 00:09:35,284
Something like that. I was originally
created to look after my master.

127
00:09:35,804 --> 00:09:38,954
I have been trained to observe
every little detail around me.

128
00:09:39,248 --> 00:09:40,314
Makes sense to me!

129
00:09:40,629 --> 00:09:42,171
Well, it's great to have you around!

130
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:44,085
Y'know since you came along,

131
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,113
I've been a lot more confident that all eight of us
are gonna live to see the end of this whole thing.

132
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,617
I am an Imperial Arms.

133
00:09:50,745 --> 00:09:53,348
There's no need for you to include me in such things.

134
00:09:53,373 --> 00:09:54,338
Don't say that!

135
00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:56,673
You're a weapon AND a companion!

136
00:09:57,658 --> 00:09:59,819
Companion? Why?

137
00:10:01,922 --> 00:10:03,502
I'm not really sure I understand.

138
00:10:03,531 --> 00:10:06,363
That word refers to people
who fight alongside one another.

139
00:10:06,421 --> 00:10:10,233
Wha-? Yeah, well that too, but it's a lot more than that.

140
00:10:10,258 --> 00:10:11,200
Umm...

141
00:10:12,027 --> 00:10:14,477
Companions... just help each other out.

142
00:10:14,842 --> 00:10:15,703
Hey, I got it!

143
00:10:16,005 --> 00:10:17,705
You're a relatively handsome guy.

144
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,985
When all this fighting's over, I want you to
help me and Lubb pick up chicks. How's that sound?

145
00:10:23,229 --> 00:10:24,549
Not sure if I know how.

146
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,315
But if that really is what you want from me,

147
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,803
I'll do everything in my power to help you achieve it.

148
00:10:29,931 --> 00:10:31,056
Aw, yeah!

149
00:10:31,406 --> 00:10:32,914
Hey, Su! Tatsumi!

150
00:10:34,783 --> 00:10:38,114
The boss just called an emergency
meeting. We need to get back to base.

151
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:40,671
Emergency? What's going on?

152
00:10:40,735 --> 00:10:44,956
Apparently, some new Danger Beasts are
causing a lot of trouble in the imperial capital.

153
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,969
But before we can take care of them,
we're relocating to our new hideout.

154
00:10:50,985 --> 00:10:52,201
The Capital, huh?

155
00:11:00,176 --> 00:11:00,895
This is it?

156
00:11:01,705 --> 00:11:03,768
It doesn't look any different from the old hideout.

157
00:11:04,728 --> 00:11:10,060
Well, when you build a facility that's hard to
find and easy to flee, it pretty much looks like this.

158
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:13,464
And the best part is the new one has a hot spring, too!

159
00:11:13,621 --> 00:11:16,525
After this job, we should have a soak and get trashed!

160
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,700
Sounds like fun!

161
00:11:18,147 --> 00:11:22,885
Najenda, guess what! I set up a barrier all
the way around the perimeter of the hideout!

162
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:23,898
Okay.

163
00:11:24,153 --> 00:11:27,127
And I dug out a few traps in case of an emergency.

164
00:11:27,152 --> 00:11:29,885
Oh, that was really fast, Susanoo. Nice work!

165
00:11:32,653 --> 00:11:34,302
You'd better watch yourself, pal!

166
00:11:34,335 --> 00:11:36,878
Hm? What are you talking about?

167
00:11:39,554 --> 00:11:45,088
I hate to send you all out again so soon, but your
next job is to take out the Danger Beasts I mentioned.

168
00:11:45,134 --> 00:11:47,525
We don't know very much about them at the moment,

169
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:51,566
except that they're somewhat intelligent
and they usually like to travel in packs.

170
00:11:51,927 --> 00:11:54,614
But individually, they're still extremely strong.

171
00:11:54,985 --> 00:11:57,722
They've overpowered everyone who's tried to fight them.

172
00:11:58,442 --> 00:12:00,628
They've been attacking both humans and livestock

173
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:04,695
south of the capital in various
environments, from mines to forests.

174
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:09,838
The Jaegers and the Imperial Army are
working day in and day out to exterminate them,

175
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,233
but their numbers haven't decreased much.

176
00:12:13,128 --> 00:12:17,036
If they're giving the Empire a hard
time, then I seriously doubt this is a trap.

177
00:12:18,742 --> 00:12:22,900
Undoubtedly, we're actually
helping the Empire by taking this job.

178
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:24,331
Can you live with that?

179
00:12:24,893 --> 00:12:26,177
Absolutely, Boss!

180
00:12:26,217 --> 00:12:28,139
After all, this is a special case.

181
00:12:28,177 --> 00:12:29,578
I agree with Tatsumi.

182
00:12:29,603 --> 00:12:32,003
It sounds like we should defeat them as soon as possible.

183
00:12:33,975 --> 00:12:37,477
I just hope we don't run into any Imperial
Soldiers while we're near the capital.

184
00:12:38,582 --> 00:12:40,097
Shouldn't be an issue.

185
00:12:40,231 --> 00:12:43,708
We're Night Raid. We do our work
while the soldiers are off duty.

186
00:12:43,733 --> 00:12:45,187
Oh yeah, guess so.

187
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:51,086
So you bleeding hearts will just put yourselves
in danger just to help slay the monsters?

188
00:12:51,346 --> 00:12:53,748
Leave it to the Jaegers to get themselves killed.

189
00:12:54,022 --> 00:12:57,044
You guys really have to stop being so soft all the time.

190
00:12:59,036 --> 00:13:00,759
I understand where you're coming from.

191
00:13:01,862 --> 00:13:05,226
But what if those things are killing
more innocent people as we speak?

192
00:13:05,832 --> 00:13:07,869
Even if we are a bunch of assassins,

193
00:13:07,894 --> 00:13:09,694
we're still allies of the people!

194
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:13,488
And if we really want to help, we
have to kill those things right now!

195
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:16,767
I figured you'd say something like that.

196
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:18,907
Fine, you win.

197
00:13:22,318 --> 00:13:23,110
Tatsumi...

198
00:13:23,694 --> 00:13:26,067
There's something I really need to tell you.

199
00:13:26,989 --> 00:13:27,735
What's that?

200
00:13:28,783 --> 00:13:32,507
Could you please zip up your pants?
It's been bothering me for a while now.

201
00:13:37,836 --> 00:13:40,336
So much for trying to look all cool, Romeo!

202
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,175
We totally take you seriously!

203
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,423
You're awesome. So smooth.

204
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:44,763
It serves you right, loser.

205
00:13:44,788 --> 00:13:46,383
Come on, guys!

206
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,458
Sorry, Tatsumi.

207
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:52,589
I noticed it a while ago, but I
thought it might be intentional.

208
00:13:52,614 --> 00:13:56,018
Are you crazy?! What the hell kind
of exhibitionist do you think I am?!

209
00:13:57,453 --> 00:14:00,052
From now on, I'll watch closely to ensure it stays up.

210
00:14:00,718 --> 00:14:02,493
No thanks, I'm sure I'll be fine!

211
00:14:02,904 --> 00:14:06,040
It's an ingenious technique. A
great way to distract the enemy.

212
00:14:06,065 --> 00:14:07,663
You need to shut your stupid face!

213
00:14:07,688 --> 00:14:11,355
Oh, there's nothing to be embarrassed about.
You had your fly down for the people, right?

214
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,021
Huh?! Seriously?

215
00:14:13,168 --> 00:14:18,151
This is actually pretty normal for our crowd.
Make sure you're prepared for plenty of headaches.

216
00:14:18,176 --> 00:14:19,777
Yeah, I'm prepared for that,

217
00:14:20,001 --> 00:14:21,377
but I'm a little scared.

218
00:14:21,496 --> 00:14:25,142
I mean I can't help but be worried
after reading about Sheele and Bulat.

219
00:14:25,353 --> 00:14:27,213
Tatsumi's too nice, like they were.

220
00:14:27,648 --> 00:14:29,260
I'm afraid it's gonna get him killed.

221
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,540
Awww, don't be such a baby!

222
00:14:36,414 --> 00:14:39,742
Run, I have something very important to discuss with you.

223
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:43,304
Based on the minister's research,
those Danger Beasts were once people.

224
00:14:43,365 --> 00:14:44,272
I knew it.

225
00:14:45,407 --> 00:14:48,537
Their physiques did seem unusually human as I recall.

226
00:14:48,669 --> 00:14:50,972
Someone was turning them into monsters.

227
00:14:51,217 --> 00:14:54,591
Only an Imperial Arms user
could manage something like that.

228
00:14:54,616 --> 00:14:59,264
There's a distinct possibility that these new
Danger Beasts could have been the doctor's experiments.

229
00:14:59,821 --> 00:15:04,915
It's probably not a coincidence they started wreaking
havoc right about the same time the doctor disappeared.

230
00:15:05,421 --> 00:15:06,847
Is there more evidence?

231
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:11,735
When I went to investigate the laboratory, I remember
noticing that the place seemed surprisingly empty.

232
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:16,672
Especially knowing he was almost always
conducting experiments, I thought it rather odd.

233
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:20,862
So that means he must have had
another secret lab somewhere, right?

234
00:15:21,361 --> 00:15:26,550
Yes, and whatever he was keeping locked up in there
somehow found a way to escape after he was gone.

235
00:15:26,655 --> 00:15:30,913
It could also be an unknown third party
stole his Imperial Arms to make the monsters,

236
00:15:31,116 --> 00:15:33,347
but then again the attacks seem so random.

237
00:15:33,862 --> 00:15:38,901
I guess it's possible the doctor stumbled upon
the enemy while he was out looking for Tatsumi.

238
00:15:39,014 --> 00:15:43,087
He found their hideout and tried to capture
them and turn them into his test subjects,

239
00:15:43,112 --> 00:15:46,672
only to have the tables turned
and be killed by them instead.

240
00:15:47,704 --> 00:15:51,903
I'm beginning to think that he may have
been more insane than I ever thought he was.

241
00:15:52,614 --> 00:15:57,840
If the doctor really was the one who created those
Danger Beasts, then there should only be a limited number.

242
00:15:58,221 --> 00:16:00,701
Eventually, the problem should resolve itself.

243
00:16:01,689 --> 00:16:04,233
There's more to this than how many we're dealing with.

244
00:16:04,453 --> 00:16:08,570
For starters, were those monsters
truly capable of escaping on their own?

245
00:16:08,933 --> 00:16:12,013
Or should we assume that somebody wanted to set them free?

246
00:16:13,801 --> 00:16:18,627
Understood. I will continue to evaluate
the situation as thoroughly as possible.

247
00:16:18,757 --> 00:16:20,008
I'm counting on you.

248
00:16:20,102 --> 00:16:22,854
We don't know exactly how serious this is yet.

249
00:16:23,707 --> 00:16:25,029
All that aside...

250
00:16:25,147 --> 00:16:28,652
It's unusual to see you stopping
to admire the flowers like this.

251
00:16:28,716 --> 00:16:30,783
Hm? Oh, these?

252
00:16:31,571 --> 00:16:36,963
Well, when you rub these particular flowers
into an open wound, they cause excruciating pain.

253
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,190
I use them in light torture.

254
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,450
I'll be sure to remember that.

255
00:16:45,802 --> 00:16:48,737
How dare you terrorize the good people of this land?!

256
00:16:48,762 --> 00:16:50,384
Koro, Phase One!

257
00:16:50,418 --> 00:16:51,524
Woof!

258
00:16:52,874 --> 00:16:55,413
Purifying Ball of Justice!

259
00:16:57,153 --> 00:17:00,654
Koro! They should be all nice and tender and ready to eat!

260
00:17:05,328 --> 00:17:08,618
That's one of those Jaegers everybody's talking about.

261
00:17:09,358 --> 00:17:10,911
Living up to their reputation.

262
00:17:10,936 --> 00:17:11,917
You're good boy!

263
00:17:14,086 --> 00:17:17,658
I think I'll play with my toys just a bit longer.

264
00:17:21,723 --> 00:17:24,124
Man, how did I get paired up with a dude again?

265
00:17:24,149 --> 00:17:27,013
It's not like we're out here to
get some kissy time, ya ding dong.

266
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:28,439
We should be on the lookout.

267
00:17:28,597 --> 00:17:30,127
There might be Imperial Soldiers.

268
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,074
Why are you acting so jumpy?

269
00:17:33,169 --> 00:17:34,180
Now, listen here.

270
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:38,010
It's crucial for an assassin to be a
little bit paranoid. It helps you stay alert.

271
00:17:38,269 --> 00:17:40,691
Najenda said that herself, thank you very much.

272
00:17:40,716 --> 00:17:42,117
You might wanna try it, too!

273
00:17:44,455 --> 00:17:47,691
Now wait a minute, I've noticed you doing that before.

274
00:17:47,716 --> 00:17:49,470
Hm? You noticed what?

275
00:17:49,794 --> 00:17:51,896
Everybody else just calls her "Boss,"

276
00:17:51,957 --> 00:17:53,589
but you always call her Najenda.

277
00:17:53,689 --> 00:17:54,638
Don't you, Lubb?

278
00:17:55,263 --> 00:17:59,635
Uh... Uh, yeah, I guess I do.

279
00:18:00,562 --> 00:18:01,903
She and I go way back,

280
00:18:02,144 --> 00:18:04,879
all the way back to when she
was fighting in the Imperial Army.

281
00:18:08,265 --> 00:18:11,405
I was the fourth son of a rich
merchant who lived in the countryside.

282
00:18:12,322 --> 00:18:14,634
I mean I had all I ever wanted when I was a kid.

283
00:18:15,644 --> 00:18:19,153
I was the best at everything I did,
so the world seemed really boring.

284
00:18:19,707 --> 00:18:21,792
Wow, Lubb, sounds to me like you really had it rough.

285
00:18:21,817 --> 00:18:24,136
It's gonna be a tearjerker, okay, so shut up!

286
00:18:25,684 --> 00:18:28,808
So one day, Najenda ends up getting
assigned to the town where I live.

287
00:18:31,292 --> 00:18:32,996
It was love at first sight.

288
00:18:35,091 --> 00:18:37,602
So, of course, I decided to join the army.

289
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,531
I did whatever it took to climb
the ranks and get closer to her.

290
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:47,447
So if you used to be in the army,
then what are you doing in Night Raid?

291
00:18:47,855 --> 00:18:49,904
Everything I've done is to be with her...

292
00:18:50,292 --> 00:18:51,221
With Najenda.

293
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:56,613
When she left the Empire, I forged my
records to say I was dead so I could go with her.

294
00:18:57,619 --> 00:18:58,908
Pretty awesome of me.

295
00:18:59,054 --> 00:18:59,981
Don't you think so?

296
00:19:00,689 --> 00:19:02,738
Well anyway, she doesn't feel the same.

297
00:19:03,285 --> 00:19:04,540
It's unrequited love.

298
00:19:05,014 --> 00:19:06,523
Told you it was gonna be a tearjerker.

299
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,318
Lubb, awww.

300
00:19:09,665 --> 00:19:13,067
But if you wanna win her love, you have to
stop looking at other girls in the hot spring!

301
00:19:13,092 --> 00:19:17,244
What?! Checking out hot chicks and being
in love are two totally different things!

302
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:18,307
What's the hell's wrong with you?!

303
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,875
See, that's why she doesn't love you back!

304
00:19:19,976 --> 00:19:20,861
You don't know!

305
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:24,106
Just you wait, she's gonna come around one day.

306
00:19:24,387 --> 00:19:26,571
If that ever happens, I'll treat you to anything you want.

307
00:19:26,844 --> 00:19:28,092
I look forward to it.

308
00:19:28,197 --> 00:19:31,096
Anyway, I still haven't seen
any Danger Beasts around here.

309
00:19:31,121 --> 00:19:33,571
Do you think maybe there aren't
any left up here on the mountain?

310
00:19:33,826 --> 00:19:37,216
I set some tripwires, but it doesn't
look like anything's tripped 'em so far.

311
00:19:37,726 --> 00:19:38,363
All right...

312
00:19:38,827 --> 00:19:40,504
Well, if we're sure this area's okay,

313
00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:42,912
then I guess I should probably
take a look at the peak real quick.

314
00:19:42,937 --> 00:19:45,040
Remember if you see anything, just run.

315
00:19:45,065 --> 00:19:46,136
We can fight it together.

316
00:19:46,502 --> 00:19:47,249
Sure thing!

317
00:19:56,969 --> 00:19:58,482
Nothing really stands out.

318
00:19:58,826 --> 00:20:00,464
I don't even see any animals.

319
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:09,375
Even Danger Beasts have to go to sleep sometime, huh?

320
00:20:14,932 --> 00:20:17,882
I know that technically I'm out here on night patrol,

321
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:20,935
but I can't help notice how beautiful it is tonight.

322
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:24,135
This kind of frivolous nonsense normally doesn't suit me.

323
00:20:24,901 --> 00:20:28,138
Oh, Tatsumi, I'm just not myself lately.

324
00:20:28,675 --> 00:20:31,406
And I have you to blame, my love.

325
00:20:33,813 --> 00:20:35,625
Is that a Danger Beast down there?

326
00:20:37,817 --> 00:20:40,370
If so, it has terrible luck.

327
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:43,929
And here I was, starting to feel sorry for myself.

328
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,577
What the...

329
00:20:50,742 --> 00:20:52,251
Tonight isn't your night.

330
00:20:52,276 --> 00:20:54,259
I've got a new form of torture I've been...

331
00:20:56,663 --> 00:20:57,436
Tatsumi?!

332
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:02,873
What's Esdeath doing here?! This is crazy.

333
00:21:03,252 --> 00:21:05,760
How am I supposed to know if she's
gonna fall right out of the sky?!

334
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,784
What do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do?!

335
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:16,517
Great, this is not what I need right now!

336
00:21:16,924 --> 00:21:18,694
No wait, they look pretty tough.

337
00:21:19,018 --> 00:21:20,729
Maybe I can run away and leave this to her!

338
00:21:25,926 --> 00:21:27,261
Then again, maybe not.

339
00:21:27,481 --> 00:21:28,594
There goes that idea.

340
00:21:35,849 --> 00:21:37,744
You are in my way.

341
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,270
Is this some sort of dream?

342
00:21:42,502 --> 00:21:45,822
I've been waiting so long for the
moment we could meet again, Tatsumi!

343
00:21:46,453 --> 00:21:49,905
Nope, unfortunately this is not a dream.

344
00:21:50,868 --> 00:21:54,271
So uh, is she gonna finish that thing off or what?
