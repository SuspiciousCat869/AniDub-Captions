1
00:00:02,173 --> 00:00:03,213
How fun...

2
00:00:03,553 --> 00:00:05,870
a battle between Imperial Arms.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,203
How many will die?

4
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:16,343
The more puppets she has, the slower her reaction time.

5
00:00:17,486 --> 00:00:19,462
That works to my advantage.

6
00:00:29,086 --> 00:00:29,920
Ha!

7
00:00:32,459 --> 00:00:33,733
Haaa!

8
00:00:34,932 --> 00:00:35,602
Huh?

9
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:36,576
Natara?

10
00:00:38,762 --> 00:00:40,755
Please put him to rest, Kurome!

11
00:00:41,205 --> 00:00:42,492
You grew up together!

12
00:00:43,374 --> 00:00:45,320
How could you say that, Akame?

13
00:00:47,397 --> 00:00:50,353
I want him to stay close to me forever and ever,

14
00:00:50,453 --> 00:00:52,367
he's my special friend.

15
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:55,946
And I would love to add you to my collection.

16
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,282
'Cause that way... we could be together like the old days.

17
00:01:01,055 --> 00:01:02,780
Not on your life!

18
00:01:04,674 --> 00:01:05,541
Too bad.

19
00:01:08,213 --> 00:01:09,990
Magma Drive!

20
00:01:12,643 --> 00:01:15,189
His Imperial Arms can do ranged attacks?!

21
00:01:18,585 --> 00:01:19,825
Don't take them on alone!

22
00:01:20,462 --> 00:01:21,956
This isn't like you, Akame!

23
00:01:22,136 --> 00:01:22,622
Oh!

24
00:01:23,853 --> 00:01:24,713
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,867
These guys don't seem like they're
gonna go down without a fight, do they?

26
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,620
Big Sister...

27
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,159
it's a shame you betrayed the Empire and sided with them.

28
00:03:11,586 --> 00:03:12,553
Desta Ghoul!

29
00:03:12,578 --> 00:03:13,652
Crush them!

30
00:03:29,053 --> 00:03:31,711
S-Class Danger Beasts are worse than I thought!

31
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,200
That's incredible!

32
00:03:33,225 --> 00:03:34,011
Hehehe...

33
00:03:34,546 --> 00:03:37,223
Well, that changed the landscape at least.

34
00:03:37,373 --> 00:03:38,396
However...

35
00:03:39,173 --> 00:03:41,962
Night Raid doesn't get their reputation for nothing.

36
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,416
They did manage to dodge the blast.

37
00:03:48,227 --> 00:03:49,912
Looks like the fight's already started.

38
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,907
Najenda... Rest assured.

39
00:03:53,126 --> 00:03:55,337
I will do the best I possibly can for you.

40
00:03:56,887 --> 00:03:58,232
And when this mission is over,

41
00:03:58,754 --> 00:04:00,282
I'll tell you how I really feel.

42
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,670
If I wait any longer...

43
00:04:03,574 --> 00:04:05,204
Su's gonna nab you first!

44
00:04:07,053 --> 00:04:08,953
Its power is true to its class.

45
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:09,693
Got it!

46
00:04:09,906 --> 00:04:11,453
Everyone, work together!

47
00:04:11,766 --> 00:04:13,474
You didn't issue the proper command.

48
00:04:13,499 --> 00:04:13,941
Huh?

49
00:04:15,206 --> 00:04:18,526
This Desta Ghoul may indeed be a formidable foe.

50
00:04:21,493 --> 00:04:23,126
But I can handle it on my own.

51
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:25,462
Assign the rest of the team elsewhere.

52
00:04:25,487 --> 00:04:26,086
Ah...

53
00:04:27,306 --> 00:04:29,190
That's my Imperial Arms for ya!

54
00:04:30,674 --> 00:04:32,095
Aim for the puppeteer...

55
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:33,864
I'll get her this time!

56
00:04:35,225 --> 00:04:35,752
Ah!

57
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:40,482
Huh?

58
00:04:42,447 --> 00:04:43,513
A gunslinger?

59
00:04:43,753 --> 00:04:45,007
This should be fun!

60
00:04:50,972 --> 00:04:52,405
Is this thing a Danger Beast?

61
00:04:52,805 --> 00:04:54,505
I've never seen this type before.

62
00:04:57,373 --> 00:04:57,995
Agh!

63
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:02,536
Another one?

64
00:05:07,293 --> 00:05:08,540
Foolish...

65
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,827
If it weren't for my armor I'd be dead!

66
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:16,469
What is this guy?!

67
00:05:16,975 --> 00:05:18,729
Failure...

68
00:05:20,817 --> 00:05:22,203
These flames are so quick.

69
00:05:22,778 --> 00:05:23,969
I've had enough.

70
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:26,353
It's not wise to charge from the front.

71
00:05:29,094 --> 00:05:29,745
Uh...

72
00:05:30,547 --> 00:05:31,516
Aah!

73
00:05:35,311 --> 00:05:37,692
Murasame doesn't work on dead targets!

74
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:38,965
Ugh!

75
00:05:41,366 --> 00:05:42,262
Akame!

76
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:56,528
Congratulations.

77
00:05:56,553 --> 00:05:58,195
You've made me mad.

78
00:06:00,967 --> 00:06:04,086
I can see right through you and your cheap little tricks.

79
00:06:04,513 --> 00:06:05,233
Hey!

80
00:06:06,361 --> 00:06:09,334
Even in beast mode, my eyes can't keep up with that thing!

81
00:06:09,567 --> 00:06:11,778
It's not like it's an Imperial Arms!

82
00:06:11,851 --> 00:06:12,697
Dammit!

83
00:06:13,702 --> 00:06:16,474
Well, look at this, a battle royale!

84
00:06:16,761 --> 00:06:17,867
How exciting!

85
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,162
Kurome!

86
00:06:19,187 --> 00:06:22,039
See? Don't I have just the coolest friends ever?

87
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:27,395
Doya, the gunslinger, used to be an
assassin who worked for the northern tribe.

88
00:06:27,695 --> 00:06:30,987
You can still see that tiny
spark of confidence on her face.

89
00:06:31,645 --> 00:06:36,715
Wall was a very famous bodyguard, but he
was protecting my target, so I killed him.

90
00:06:37,034 --> 00:06:41,420
Apeman is one of my favorites, he's
easy to use and hits extremely hard.

91
00:06:41,942 --> 00:06:45,268
Henter was one of the last survivors of a savage tribe.

92
00:06:45,441 --> 00:06:49,344
His clever moves made him difficult
to beat so he's my prized possession.

93
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,981
Rokugo was an Imperial general...

94
00:06:52,081 --> 00:06:56,311
but he betrayed us and tried to join
the revolution, so I had to kill him too.

95
00:06:56,698 --> 00:06:59,857
Oh, and I found this Desta Ghoul while it was hibernating.

96
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:01,097
Talk about lucky!

97
00:07:01,494 --> 00:07:02,553
And...

98
00:07:02,728 --> 00:07:05,749
Natara's been with me ever since I was a little girl!

99
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:10,028
He does a great job of protecting
me whenever Yatsufusa is activated.

100
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:12,242
I actually have one more puppet,

101
00:07:12,534 --> 00:07:14,630
but you'll have to wait to see that one.

102
00:07:15,246 --> 00:07:16,141
No way...

103
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,073
she hasn't even brought out the full set?!

104
00:07:18,623 --> 00:07:19,102
Huh?

105
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,239
Dammit!

106
00:07:24,992 --> 00:07:25,587
Wait, what?!

107
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:26,553
That won't work.

108
00:07:26,578 --> 00:07:27,922
They're already dead.

109
00:07:28,256 --> 00:07:31,300
You can stab them all you want and they'll keep moving.

110
00:07:31,378 --> 00:07:33,600
You'll have to defeat me first.

111
00:07:35,073 --> 00:07:36,171
Ugh!

112
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,697
Okay, buddy, I'll admit it, you're pretty tough.

113
00:07:43,453 --> 00:07:44,171
But!

114
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,494
I've got your pattern down!

115
00:07:47,614 --> 00:07:50,537
I'm not gonna let you keep hitting me
with the same attacks over and over!

116
00:07:50,562 --> 00:07:52,284
Don't let go of that whip, Leone!

117
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,374
General Rokugo.

118
00:07:57,746 --> 00:08:02,280
Since you're a former colleague, I'll do my best
to free you from this curse as quickly as possible.

119
00:08:03,386 --> 00:08:07,074
Whoa! I can't remember the last
time I saw the Boss in action!

120
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,414
Alright then! Let's do this-.

121
00:08:11,807 --> 00:08:12,697
Uh...

122
00:08:15,987 --> 00:08:17,205
Hehehe...

123
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,404
Oh dear...

124
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:21,204
that's why you should never take your eyes off me.

125
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:24,494
Whenever I see an opening, I'm going to take it.

126
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,786
I'll make you pay for this... little tramp!

127
00:08:28,606 --> 00:08:31,161
You should know better than to make assumptions.

128
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:35,339
You're not the only opportunist in this battle.

129
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,367
Argh!

130
00:08:40,413 --> 00:08:44,287
Oh wow that's impressive, you can
stop the bleeding all by yourself!

131
00:08:47,718 --> 00:08:50,487
You made a mistake messing with me, little girl!

132
00:08:50,842 --> 00:08:52,465
I'm gonna eat you alive!

133
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,137
Hehe...

134
00:08:54,829 --> 00:08:56,382
Don't engage her, Leone!

135
00:08:56,942 --> 00:08:58,793
Remember, she has a bodyguard.

136
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:01,436
You'd better support Akame at least for the moment.

137
00:09:01,716 --> 00:09:03,893
When you're finished, we'll face Kurome together.

138
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,546
Let the two ex-generals duke it out.

139
00:09:06,673 --> 00:09:09,721
Rokugo doesn't have an Imperial Arms, so I should be fine.

140
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,587
Yes ma'am.

141
00:09:13,524 --> 00:09:14,883
Don't go anywhere...

142
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:16,521
I'm coming back for you.

143
00:09:17,594 --> 00:09:21,359
I'm starting to think you'd be the
perfect addition to my collection.

144
00:09:27,553 --> 00:09:29,912
I'm surprised we haven't caught up to them by now.

145
00:09:30,286 --> 00:09:31,392
I don't like it.

146
00:09:31,452 --> 00:09:33,931
It does seem like something's not right, doesn't it?

147
00:09:34,153 --> 00:09:37,679
Perhaps this is a decoy and
Kurome's group is the real Night Raid.

148
00:09:42,903 --> 00:09:46,302
And now we're running into a gang of mindless meatheads.

149
00:09:46,562 --> 00:09:48,893
Hard to believe this is a coincidence.

150
00:09:48,927 --> 00:09:50,622
Guess we heard right, boys!

151
00:09:50,755 --> 00:09:53,445
She did show up here! In the flesh!

152
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:56,615
So that must mean these evil thugs
are working with Night Raid.

153
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,155
Seryu.

154
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:57,653
Huh...

155
00:09:57,753 --> 00:09:58,213
Run.

156
00:09:58,237 --> 00:09:58,685
Hmm...

157
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,392
Destroy most of them.

158
00:10:00,632 --> 00:10:03,673
But maim two or three and keep them alive for me.

159
00:10:05,366 --> 00:10:06,926
I have a few questions.

160
00:10:09,702 --> 00:10:11,742
I can't run straight towards him...

161
00:10:12,052 --> 00:10:13,317
but I can...

162
00:10:13,472 --> 00:10:13,944
Uh...

163
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,331
She's searching for a window
while staying in constant motion.

164
00:10:21,511 --> 00:10:24,996
Very well... I'll give her what she wants!

165
00:10:28,665 --> 00:10:29,646
There it is!

166
00:10:35,658 --> 00:10:37,058
Armor on his hands?

167
00:10:37,252 --> 00:10:39,254
Did he plan to face Murasame?

168
00:10:42,245 --> 00:10:44,146
I can't believe her reflexes!

169
00:10:49,757 --> 00:10:53,306
Akame... may I ask you something?

170
00:10:54,645 --> 00:10:57,571
Why did you join the Revolutionary Army?

171
00:10:59,002 --> 00:11:02,178
It would have been so nice to have you with us.

172
00:11:15,386 --> 00:11:16,753
I chose Night Raid...

173
00:11:16,785 --> 00:11:19,334
because my heart told me it was the right thing to do.

174
00:11:19,584 --> 00:11:22,412
I simply decided to follow the path in which I believe.

175
00:11:23,072 --> 00:11:24,872
I completely understand.

176
00:11:25,341 --> 00:11:25,985
I do.

177
00:11:26,893 --> 00:11:27,966
And I'm sorry...

178
00:11:28,692 --> 00:11:31,886
I'm afraid it's still my job to eradicate you...

179
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,029
regardless of your beliefs.

180
00:11:36,448 --> 00:11:39,854
Oh I gotta get in on this! That'll make it a two-on-two!

181
00:11:40,394 --> 00:11:41,240
Leone!

182
00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:43,097
Yeah, you don't have to worry about me.

183
00:11:43,511 --> 00:11:45,494
Let's just concentrate on the mission for now.

184
00:11:46,114 --> 00:11:47,994
Be careful, they're strong.

185
00:11:48,019 --> 00:11:48,862
Whatever!

186
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:51,308
Let's waste this guy so we can get Kurome!

187
00:11:54,162 --> 00:11:58,515
Considering I'm about half as strong as I
was before I got these wounds from Esdeath...

188
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,659
I'm swifter than I expected!

189
00:12:02,358 --> 00:12:03,802
He's learned a new trick.

190
00:12:09,292 --> 00:12:10,441
Earth Shaker?!

191
00:12:12,525 --> 00:12:12,954
Ah!

192
00:12:17,749 --> 00:12:21,248
We've been fighting for so long, I
can stay ahead of anything you've got.

193
00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:25,787
Fire! Reel Assault!

194
00:12:34,305 --> 00:12:36,550
How 'bout we go out and get a drink, Naje?!

195
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:39,885
Eh!

196
00:12:46,274 --> 00:12:46,894
Uh!

197
00:12:46,973 --> 00:12:50,223
What the hell kind of Imperial Arms is this?!

198
00:12:56,552 --> 00:12:57,719
Hyaaa!

199
00:13:07,939 --> 00:13:08,510
Hm...

200
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,296
This is difficult...

201
00:13:20,265 --> 00:13:21,772
but I won't be defeated.

202
00:13:23,032 --> 00:13:25,819
Well, it is an S-Class... are you having trouble with it?

203
00:13:26,341 --> 00:13:27,478
It hits really hard..

204
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:29,478
But the main problem is right there.

205
00:13:29,553 --> 00:13:30,105
Hm?

206
00:13:31,526 --> 00:13:33,757
That little bump is getting on my nerves.

207
00:13:35,016 --> 00:13:38,237
It's disgusting how it completely breaks up the symmetry!

208
00:13:38,463 --> 00:13:41,322
If it wasn't so distracting I wouldn't have gotten hit.

209
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:42,863
You're joking.

210
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:46,385
I swear you really need to get
over this obsessive compulsive thing.

211
00:13:47,218 --> 00:13:50,072
Still, if someone doesn't get to Kurome soon,

212
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:52,570
we're going to start suffering casualties.

213
00:13:53,114 --> 00:13:57,299
Susanoo! As your master, I am giving
you permission to use your trump card!

214
00:13:57,673 --> 00:13:58,770
Understood.

215
00:14:03,283 --> 00:14:04,550
They're so in synch!

216
00:14:05,036 --> 00:14:07,547
If only one of them would hold off for just a second!

217
00:14:09,798 --> 00:14:10,372
Ugh...

218
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:24,655
T...

219
00:14:25,901 --> 00:14:26,843
Tri...

220
00:14:27,452 --> 00:14:28,985
Tribesman...?

221
00:14:35,603 --> 00:14:37,331
It's just like Akame said.

222
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,894
Yatsufusa's corpses don't have a will of their own.

223
00:14:41,052 --> 00:14:42,630
They're nothing but puppets.

224
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:47,151
But a few traces of their quirks and
their deepest feelings do remain intact.

225
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:51,867
Sorry, but I'm not actually a member of your lost tribe.

226
00:14:51,978 --> 00:14:54,519
Aaaaah!

227
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:00,100
Nice one.

228
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:02,392
He shouldn't be such a nuisance anymore.

229
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,286
Thanks for the help, Chelsea!

230
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:07,586
Welp! Guess I'll leave the big gorilla guy to you! See ya!

231
00:15:07,692 --> 00:15:08,276
Huh?!

232
00:15:10,937 --> 00:15:13,525
I can't believe I took such a big risk back there!

233
00:15:13,998 --> 00:15:17,635
And after everything I said about
Sheele and Bulat being failed assassins.

234
00:15:18,563 --> 00:15:21,661
Maybe all their sentimental
junk is starting to rub off on me.

235
00:15:21,851 --> 00:15:23,065
Oh Tatsumi.

236
00:15:23,491 --> 00:15:25,419
Hmph... It's all your fault.

237
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:29,047
Now that it's just you, I can see your tactics!

238
00:15:29,686 --> 00:15:31,994
Playing with the dead like they're a bunch of toys...

239
00:15:32,437 --> 00:15:34,653
this Imperial Arms makes me sick!

240
00:15:35,516 --> 00:15:38,002
Now... rest in peace!

241
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:47,712
Hm...

242
00:15:48,018 --> 00:15:51,722
The intervals between my snack
breaks keep getting shorter and shorter.

243
00:15:54,852 --> 00:15:56,768
I wonder if Wave's okay.

244
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:02,104
He seems fairly sturdy... I'm sure he's alive.

245
00:16:04,128 --> 00:16:04,948
Uh-oh.

246
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:07,086
Rokugo and Henter stopped moving.

247
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:08,967
Apeman too?

248
00:16:09,995 --> 00:16:11,219
Guess it's time.

249
00:16:12,115 --> 00:16:16,138
Before sending in my final corpse,
I should probably set another trap.

250
00:16:20,723 --> 00:16:22,187
That was a serious hit.

251
00:16:22,393 --> 00:16:25,561
If Grand Chariot's sword hadn't blocked it, I'd be dead.

252
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:27,528
I have to get back...

253
00:16:27,835 --> 00:16:29,778
or Bols and Kurome won't make it.

254
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:33,542
Despite what Kurome thinks of
herself, she can be pretty helpless.

255
00:16:34,615 --> 00:16:35,920
If I don't help her.

256
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,119
Dammit...

257
00:16:41,432 --> 00:16:43,753
that hit must've been even worse than I thought...

258
00:16:43,892 --> 00:16:45,075
I can't move...

259
00:16:49,114 --> 00:16:50,720
So, you're a sharp shooter.

260
00:16:51,306 --> 00:16:53,113
Too bad you're up against me.

261
00:16:53,694 --> 00:16:56,521
They don't call me a badass sniper genius for nothing!

262
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,031
Huh? Uh? Ah!

263
00:17:01,056 --> 00:17:03,023
Ew what is this nasty thing?!

264
00:17:03,048 --> 00:17:05,958
Oh! That was quick, it's already eating someone.

265
00:17:06,352 --> 00:17:08,585
This is my new recruit, the Kaiser Frog.

266
00:17:08,933 --> 00:17:12,370
Its stomach acid is capable
of dissolving anything it eats.

267
00:17:12,442 --> 00:17:13,539
It's delightfully deadly.

268
00:17:13,564 --> 00:17:14,625
Let me go!

269
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,566
Oh, Seryu told me something funny.

270
00:17:16,866 --> 00:17:19,414
She said Koro gobbled up one of your friends.

271
00:17:19,514 --> 00:17:20,096
Uh!

272
00:17:20,347 --> 00:17:23,371
It's kind of fitting that
you'd suffer the exact same fate.

273
00:17:24,424 --> 00:17:26,679
No! There is no way in hell...

274
00:17:27,014 --> 00:17:29,627
I'm gonna die in a place like this!

275
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:30,987
Ahh!

276
00:17:32,373 --> 00:17:34,732
The end comes much too easily, doesn't it?

277
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:36,940
Bye-bye! Hehe...

278
00:17:37,908 --> 00:17:40,048
Good boy... Ready for the next one?

279
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,716
Stop right there, Kurome!

280
00:17:43,122 --> 00:17:47,282
And don't think for a second I'll go easy on
you just because you're Akame's little sister!

281
00:17:47,408 --> 00:17:49,879
Well. You don't know when to quit, do ya?

282
00:17:50,242 --> 00:17:50,985
Careful.

283
00:17:51,342 --> 00:17:54,669
Natara's power is ten times more intense than Apeman's.

284
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:59,366
Magatama Manifest!

285
00:18:00,645 --> 00:18:03,183
Susanoo's trump card makes him a berserker.

286
00:18:03,663 --> 00:18:06,976
The emblem on his chest absorbs his master's life force.

287
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:09,324
And he releases that energy in combat.

288
00:18:11,432 --> 00:18:15,867
After Susanoo uses this ability
three times, his master will die.

289
00:18:17,467 --> 00:18:20,050
But the trade-off is its incredible strength!

290
00:18:25,946 --> 00:18:27,599
Eight-handed Mirror Shield!

291
00:18:46,401 --> 00:18:48,581
Sacred Sword of the Heavens!

292
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,865
He's on par with me while I'm wearing Incursio!

293
00:18:58,498 --> 00:19:00,458
No... he's even better!

294
00:19:01,446 --> 00:19:02,293
Hehehe...

295
00:19:03,446 --> 00:19:05,186
It's all running smoothly.

296
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,376
Oh?

297
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,691
What's wrong little guy?

298
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,432
She's fighting from the inside?

299
00:19:13,573 --> 00:19:16,158
But how is she still alive swimming in all that acid?

300
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:18,119
Uh?!

301
00:19:18,766 --> 00:19:20,750
Aww, it's leaking...

302
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:23,092
Oh no, that defeats the whole point.

303
00:19:23,901 --> 00:19:24,487
Uh!

304
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,400
Huh?

305
00:19:37,825 --> 00:19:40,367
Okay, I'm about ready to kill a bitch.

306
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:41,194
Mine?

307
00:19:41,576 --> 00:19:42,742
What are you doing in there?

308
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,317
Oh, just got through a living hell;

309
00:19:45,342 --> 00:19:46,759
You could've helped me, you know!

310
00:19:46,784 --> 00:19:48,727
And don't look at me like that, pervert!

311
00:19:48,752 --> 00:19:50,339
How can you even tell where I'm looking?!

312
00:19:50,639 --> 00:19:53,014
That's enough arguing for now, you two!

313
00:19:53,313 --> 00:19:55,093
We've got a battle to win, remember?

314
00:19:55,585 --> 00:19:56,334
Boss!

315
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:57,408
Huh, what happened?

316
00:19:57,433 --> 00:19:59,623
Why does Su look so cool?!

317
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,598
You wondered how many will die.

318
00:20:01,805 --> 00:20:02,846
Right Kurome?

319
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,030
I think I have the answer for you.

320
00:20:07,381 --> 00:20:09,035
Oh you think so, huh?

321
00:20:09,503 --> 00:20:10,337
I get it.

322
00:20:11,415 --> 00:20:17,191
I'll just have to kill every last one of you...
that way you can be my precious puppets forever.

323
00:20:23,357 --> 00:20:24,405
Let's take him out!

324
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,050
Right!

325
00:20:28,296 --> 00:20:30,018
Uh? Why would they jump?

326
00:20:30,507 --> 00:20:31,962
They can't dodge up there!

327
00:20:34,293 --> 00:20:35,363
Now!

328
00:20:36,189 --> 00:20:36,865
Uh...

329
00:20:37,471 --> 00:20:40,526
If the bodyguard is eventually going to be in our way...

330
00:20:40,817 --> 00:20:44,065
then we can surprise everyone by going after him first!

331
00:20:47,267 --> 00:20:47,962
No!

332
00:20:50,698 --> 00:20:54,333
He's locked in on Akame, and his
bodyguard isn't there to help him anymore!

333
00:20:54,901 --> 00:20:56,060
He's mine!

334
00:20:57,206 --> 00:20:57,799
Ugh!

335
00:21:01,104 --> 00:21:02,735
Sneaky bastard!

336
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,022
Ah, crap!

337
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,082
AAAH!

338
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:13,818
Uh?

339
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,147
Hehe...

340
00:21:17,995 --> 00:21:19,992
Tastes like you're about to lose.

341
00:21:20,324 --> 00:21:23,325
Did you actually just bite off a piece of my weapon?!

342
00:21:26,565 --> 00:21:27,197
Ah...

343
00:21:27,637 --> 00:21:31,517
What're you gonna do with your Imperial
Arms, it's nothing but a hunk of garbage now.

344
00:21:31,542 --> 00:21:33,948
She's right, I can't use it anymore.

345
00:21:34,443 --> 00:21:35,587
Alright then.

346
00:21:36,273 --> 00:21:36,714
Eh?

347
00:21:36,873 --> 00:21:37,454
Huh?

348
00:21:40,979 --> 00:21:42,312
I'll dispose of it.

349
00:21:44,593 --> 00:21:46,106
Wait! No don't!
