1
00:00:05,331 --> 00:00:06,250
Kurome...

2
00:00:06,935 --> 00:00:09,387
Unlike you, I chose to be a soldier.

3
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:11,182
It was my dream.

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,230
There was an officer who helped me,

5
00:00:14,943 --> 00:00:16,563
and I wanted to be just like him.

6
00:00:17,504 --> 00:00:19,213
Soldiers fight for what's right.

7
00:00:19,868 --> 00:00:22,878
They're supposed to work hard to
protect their country and their people.

8
00:00:26,238 --> 00:00:27,844
But now that I am a soldier...

9
00:00:29,034 --> 00:00:29,716
I don't...

10
00:00:30,262 --> 00:00:33,013
I don't have any idea what I'm protecting anymore.

11
00:00:45,191 --> 00:00:47,267
Looks like it's down to the four of us.

12
00:00:49,651 --> 00:00:51,410
This place feels really big now.

13
00:00:51,477 --> 00:00:52,517
Yeah, it does.

14
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:54,663
So, what're we doing after this?

15
00:00:55,004 --> 00:00:58,451
After the revolution's over, there won't
be much work for guys like us, y'know.

16
00:00:58,484 --> 00:01:03,345
If I recall correctly, when I got here you
practically forced me to join the team. Remember that?

17
00:01:03,839 --> 00:01:06,962
And when I did, before I knew
it, everything had gotten all crazy.

18
00:01:07,302 --> 00:01:09,396
Aw, I'm sorry sweetie.

19
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:13,379
Oh well, then I guess you'll just
have to punish me with a spanking!

20
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:19,773
No, thank you! Besides, assassins being
out of work means the world is a better place!

21
00:01:19,873 --> 00:01:21,049
I guess so.

22
00:01:21,593 --> 00:01:24,319
Well, maybe we could start a
traveling circus group or something.

23
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:25,225
Sounds good.

24
00:01:25,249 --> 00:01:26,527
No, it doesn't!

25
00:01:27,059 --> 00:01:29,310
I appreciate all you've done for the cause, team.

26
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:32,927
Whoa! That sounded way too
much like a final goodbye, Boss!

27
00:01:33,046 --> 00:01:34,829
I don't know whether we'll meet again.

28
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,785
That's completely up to you.

29
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,137
What're you talking about?

30
00:01:38,581 --> 00:01:41,412
You're gonna have a hell of a time
getting rid of these three misfits!

31
00:01:42,645 --> 00:01:43,479
Am I right?!

32
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,297
Of course! You know I'm in!

33
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:50,158
Good! Then this will be Night Raid's last assignment:

34
00:01:50,542 --> 00:01:52,608
Cut down the source of this corruption,

35
00:01:52,726 --> 00:01:55,048
assassinate Minister Honest!

36
00:01:58,912 --> 00:02:00,546
You have to survive.

37
00:02:00,828 --> 00:02:02,952
I will. You have my word on it.

38
00:03:40,856 --> 00:03:45,349
Tatsumi, your time limit depends on
how long our main forces can hold out.

39
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:47,803
Kill the minister as fast as you can!

40
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,636
Today we turn our dreams of revolution into reality,

41
00:03:51,834 --> 00:03:53,993
and pave the way for a new world!

42
00:03:54,523 --> 00:03:58,316
By the strength of our hearts, we
will abolish this debauched government,

43
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,183
and its people will finally live in peace!

44
00:04:05,854 --> 00:04:07,289
I'm counting on you.

45
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:13,804
Bingo! Hardly any guards here, just like we thought.

46
00:04:14,258 --> 00:04:15,629
Lubb's map was exactly right.

47
00:04:15,654 --> 00:04:17,097
Thanks, little man!

48
00:04:24,445 --> 00:04:25,550
Night Raid!

49
00:04:26,263 --> 00:04:28,580
I don't want to kill any more than I have to.

50
00:04:29,205 --> 00:04:30,862
Get out or get ready to die.

51
00:04:30,887 --> 00:04:32,558
We will not retreat!

52
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:35,836
Shoulda known they would keep the
toughest ones reserved to the palace.

53
00:04:36,593 --> 00:04:38,324
I guess killing them's the only way through.

54
00:04:40,755 --> 00:04:42,836
None of you can cut it against Night Raid.

55
00:04:43,025 --> 00:04:44,667
Please fall back now.

56
00:04:47,309 --> 00:04:48,546
One of the Jaegers.

57
00:04:48,864 --> 00:04:49,561
It's Run.

58
00:04:50,212 --> 00:04:51,577
It's been a while, hasn't it?

59
00:04:51,927 --> 00:04:54,063
I'm surprised you remember me, Tatsumi.

60
00:04:54,163 --> 00:04:56,274
By any chance, you think you could let us pass?

61
00:04:57,099 --> 00:04:58,105
Pretty please?

62
00:04:58,813 --> 00:05:03,537
Oh, sorry. I've always been the type of
person who prefers to finish everything I start.

63
00:05:03,665 --> 00:05:05,585
Yeah? Even if it's a mistake?

64
00:05:05,845 --> 00:05:10,192
History will ultimately decide who made
the right decision in a situation like this.

65
00:05:11,153 --> 00:05:13,221
There's no reason to throw your lives away.

66
00:05:13,364 --> 00:05:14,224
You may leave.

67
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:14,982
Huh?

68
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,478
You can't help me.

69
00:05:16,758 --> 00:05:19,743
As a matter of fact... you'd be in the way.

70
00:05:23,272 --> 00:05:24,077
Watch out!

71
00:05:26,888 --> 00:05:28,736
Those must be his Imperial Arms!

72
00:05:29,571 --> 00:05:30,807
You were right, y'know.

73
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:35,048
Just as you thought, the empire, as we
know it, has become rotten to its core.

74
00:05:35,566 --> 00:05:38,062
The current regime is on the verge of collapse.

75
00:05:38,234 --> 00:05:40,319
If you know that, why are you getting in our way?

76
00:05:40,584 --> 00:05:43,489
Because your methods of revolt cause too much bloodshed.

77
00:05:43,746 --> 00:05:45,255
Are you saying you're no different?

78
00:05:45,314 --> 00:05:47,795
Well, you see, I was once a teacher.

79
00:05:48,284 --> 00:05:50,541
How did a teacher wind up in the Jaegers?!

80
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:54,782
Not long ago, a group of bandits abducted my students

81
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:55,990
and murdered them.

82
00:05:57,195 --> 00:05:59,990
But the government didn't
treat it like a crime in any way.

83
00:06:01,008 --> 00:06:03,418
Now, the village I came from was quite poor,

84
00:06:03,653 --> 00:06:06,589
so the bureaucrats saw no reason to get involved.

85
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:08,575
Really? That happened to you?

86
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:12,849
It did. And it's precisely the
reason I despise this empire.

87
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,972
In that case, why are you not on OUR side?!

88
00:06:19,187 --> 00:06:20,424
That's where you belong!

89
00:06:20,622 --> 00:06:22,542
My plan was to infiltrate the Jaegers.

90
00:06:22,567 --> 00:06:25,217
I thought I'd be able to accomplish more from the inside!

91
00:06:25,563 --> 00:06:30,102
But Night Raid decided to resort to
violence in the name of REVOLUTION!

92
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:31,625
Man, you piss me off!

93
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,057
I'm gonna knock some sense into your thick skull!

94
00:06:38,352 --> 00:06:41,392
Keep moving, you two. I'll handle this guy on my own!

95
00:06:41,437 --> 00:06:42,134
Sis!

96
00:06:42,771 --> 00:06:45,442
It's not a good idea for us
all to be together in one place!

97
00:06:45,467 --> 00:06:46,539
I'm fine, just GO!

98
00:06:47,355 --> 00:06:48,827
Don't you go dying on me.

99
00:06:52,295 --> 00:06:55,519
Not until I get at least one good
hit on the minister, all right?!

100
00:06:56,265 --> 00:06:58,867
And AS for YOU, this is gonna be over real quick!

101
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,654
It's nothing personal, but your ass was
doomed when you chose to fight for the empire!

102
00:07:03,887 --> 00:07:05,760
You chose the wrong side!

103
00:07:11,261 --> 00:07:12,318
What the hell?!

104
00:07:12,967 --> 00:07:15,504
Divine Wings, my trump card.

105
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:19,219
You didn't actually expect me to
fight you in hand-to-hand combat?

106
00:07:19,995 --> 00:07:21,238
Oh, crap...

107
00:07:22,131 --> 00:07:23,784
What's the status, Minister?

108
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,277
Doesn't look promising.

109
00:07:26,714 --> 00:07:28,934
I hate to be the bearer of bad news,

110
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:33,572
but our forces seem to be completely overwhelmed
by the onslaught from the Revolutionary Army.

111
00:07:33,597 --> 00:07:34,792
So we're losing...

112
00:07:34,998 --> 00:07:37,142
I fear our reign's been nothing but failure!

113
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:41,130
Nonsense! Even in the wake of the
unfortunate passing of your DEAR parents,

114
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:44,094
Your Majesty has always been steadfast.

115
00:07:44,147 --> 00:07:46,035
And with me guiding your hand,

116
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,807
at what point could you possibly have made any mistakes?

117
00:07:48,832 --> 00:07:50,998
Oh yes, you're absolutely right.

118
00:07:51,274 --> 00:07:53,582
You have been a wonderful example, Minister.

119
00:07:54,664 --> 00:07:58,502
The citizens are losing their minds over a foolish dream!

120
00:07:58,622 --> 00:08:01,848
The revolution they imagine will never come to pass!

121
00:08:02,118 --> 00:08:05,354
It's your duty to teach the defectors a lesson!

122
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,769
I'm sure there will be casualties,

123
00:08:07,938 --> 00:08:11,969
BUT there are times when a leader must make sacrifices!

124
00:08:11,994 --> 00:08:15,982
A display of authority is the
remedy for this absurd rebellion!

125
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:19,792
Make it so, O Wise One!

126
00:08:27,096 --> 00:08:28,958
Well, well, what do we have here?

127
00:08:29,185 --> 00:08:30,335
It's the rebels!

128
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,688
That man's from Night Raid!

129
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:36,267
How did you get past the Royal Guards?!

130
00:08:40,329 --> 00:08:42,892
Looks like your precious guards decided to give up.

131
00:08:44,193 --> 00:08:46,339
Minister, you're my target.

132
00:08:47,149 --> 00:08:47,988
You're done!

133
00:08:55,483 --> 00:08:56,466
You're too late!

134
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:59,380
The ultimate Imperial Arms has been activated!

135
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:00,235
You lo...

136
00:09:02,097 --> 00:09:02,968
Excuse me...

137
00:09:03,665 --> 00:09:05,645
This empire is coming to an end,

138
00:09:05,888 --> 00:09:07,631
because of what YOU started!

139
00:09:07,656 --> 00:09:09,182
No! Please, listen to me!

140
00:09:09,873 --> 00:09:11,875
Things were messed up far longer than that!

141
00:09:11,975 --> 00:09:15,491
The weak and the poor have been
suffering under this tyranny for ages.

142
00:09:15,663 --> 00:09:20,205
And no matter how hard those people prayed for
things to change, you never did anything to help 'em!

143
00:09:21,597 --> 00:09:23,991
Sayo, Ieyasu, and my friends...

144
00:09:24,219 --> 00:09:25,497
they're all dead now!

145
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,825
This callous nation cannot stand any longer!

146
00:09:29,632 --> 00:09:33,886
Your Majesty, you mustn't
allow him to deceive you! Please!

147
00:09:34,022 --> 00:09:35,732
You hold your tongue, Minister!

148
00:09:36,104 --> 00:09:38,406
Your days of manipulating the emperor are over!

149
00:09:38,595 --> 00:09:43,678
What? You should stop making such
vile accusations in royal company.

150
00:09:44,439 --> 00:09:47,060
I give advice out of love and respect!

151
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,676
That's bullshit and you know it!

152
00:09:48,776 --> 00:09:50,639
Can't you hear what's happening outside?

153
00:09:50,838 --> 00:09:52,605
The capital IS finished!

154
00:09:52,655 --> 00:09:53,856
Careful, boy...

155
00:09:53,976 --> 00:09:55,784
I'd advise you to shut your mouth.

156
00:09:55,991 --> 00:09:57,390
Please, Your Highness!

157
00:09:57,415 --> 00:10:00,374
Crush these traitors in the name of the empire!

158
00:10:00,436 --> 00:10:03,248
Submit before your all-powerful Emperor!

159
00:10:06,435 --> 00:10:07,280
What's happening?!

160
00:10:10,964 --> 00:10:14,409
The empire's secret weapon, Primus Imperator!

161
00:10:14,441 --> 00:10:20,419
A machine that's as colossal and
undefeatable as the gods themselves!

162
00:10:21,924 --> 00:10:28,573
Now the infidels who dared defy
the empire will face its wrath!

163
00:10:28,831 --> 00:10:30,118
Oh God, what is that?!

164
00:10:30,503 --> 00:10:31,217
Oh, no!

165
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,781
What's going on?!

166
00:10:45,593 --> 00:10:46,997
That thing's enormous!

167
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:49,637
He's using the legendary Imperial Arms!

168
00:10:50,057 --> 00:10:50,910
Hey, wait!

169
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,197
Primus Imperator? So it actually existed?!

170
00:10:54,609 --> 00:10:55,739
Damn that minister!

171
00:10:55,951 --> 00:10:57,743
No wonder he didn't admit defeat.

172
00:10:57,868 --> 00:11:00,038
He had this up his sleeve the whole time!

173
00:11:01,095 --> 00:11:06,154
For generations, our empire has
been a flawless image of divine order.

174
00:11:06,698 --> 00:11:11,699
And anyone who should rebel
against it must atone for their sins!

175
00:11:31,252 --> 00:11:34,231
STOP IT!

176
00:11:40,055 --> 00:11:44,055
Oh, how magnificent you've become, Your Majesty!

177
00:11:44,301 --> 00:11:50,138
Had your mother and father not been taken by
an inexplicable accident, they would be so proud!

178
00:11:50,163 --> 00:11:50,884
Yes...

179
00:11:51,655 --> 00:11:56,371
Only those of royal blood are
capable of using Primus Imperator.

180
00:11:56,738 --> 00:12:02,234
There can be no denying the fact
that you are indeed the chosen emperor!

181
00:12:03,271 --> 00:12:04,331
This is true.

182
00:12:04,618 --> 00:12:07,488
We are rightful heirs to this nation.

183
00:12:07,513 --> 00:12:10,472
Yes, Your Grace! Yes! Yes! Yes!

184
00:12:20,732 --> 00:12:26,071
So this is the weapon Stylish described
as the first and strongest of all Imperial Arms.

185
00:12:31,505 --> 00:12:33,941
This... is for the best.

186
00:12:34,042 --> 00:12:35,424
There's a good lad!

187
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:42,949
With this power at your disposal, everything
around you is yours to do with as you please!

188
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:47,554
What's a little destruction
in the quest for absolute power?

189
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:51,773
The losses can always be purged from the peasants again!

190
00:12:51,866 --> 00:12:55,511
It's just me and the emperor now!

191
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:04,366
These guys are tough!

192
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,381
But I guess they are the emperor's guards.

193
00:13:11,371 --> 00:13:12,009
Tatsumi?!

194
00:13:12,433 --> 00:13:15,414
Stop! Look what you're doing to your own people!

195
00:13:15,477 --> 00:13:17,067
Night Raid has done this.

196
00:13:17,119 --> 00:13:20,568
This is merely the result of what you've created!

197
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,160
Don't you have any compassion?!

198
00:13:25,402 --> 00:13:28,077
What kind of emperor would be
able to unleash such suffering?!

199
00:13:28,102 --> 00:13:31,399
Silence! This empire is a thousand years old.

200
00:13:31,492 --> 00:13:34,395
We will never allow it to collapse during our reign!

201
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,455
Hear, hear!

202
00:13:35,597 --> 00:13:37,772
Well said, Your Majesty!

203
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:41,073
The last thousand years have led to this day!

204
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,955
As the ruler of this country,

205
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,149
we were born into a life of crushing responsibilty!

206
00:13:48,109 --> 00:13:50,689
You could never understand how that feels!

207
00:13:51,345 --> 00:13:52,684
It's bigger than you.

208
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,574
It's bigger than all of us.

209
00:13:54,922 --> 00:13:57,768
It's the anguish and agony of everyone around you!

210
00:14:03,111 --> 00:14:04,713
Look! Can't you see it?!

211
00:14:04,932 --> 00:14:06,759
Can't you see what's happening down there!

212
00:14:19,652 --> 00:14:22,650
He lies! Don't listen to such deceit!

213
00:14:22,675 --> 00:14:27,355
If you bow and show leniency,
everything will have been for naught!

214
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,997
It's time to be strong!

215
00:14:29,022 --> 00:14:31,626
Oh... guess that could be what we need.

216
00:14:31,651 --> 00:14:34,233
What're you doing? I never said you could look away!

217
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:45,624
Your Majesty!

218
00:14:50,178 --> 00:14:52,247
If you have the power to do all this,

219
00:14:52,515 --> 00:14:55,092
why not use it to fight
the real problems out there?!

220
00:14:55,116 --> 00:14:56,117
Shut up.

221
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:59,286
Are you just gonna be his
little puppet forever, is that it?

222
00:14:59,311 --> 00:15:01,898
SHUT UUUUUP!

223
00:15:07,046 --> 00:15:07,673
Wave?!

224
00:15:08,856 --> 00:15:10,315
I'm an Imperial Soldier.

225
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:12,723
It's my job to protect people!

226
00:15:13,035 --> 00:15:14,600
Man, am I happy to hear that!

227
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:19,403
And besides, I already owed you a
favor anyway. Or don't you remember?

228
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:23,080
Huh? A favor?

229
00:15:23,605 --> 00:15:24,652
Don't worry about it.

230
00:15:25,186 --> 00:15:27,785
Your Majesty, calm yourself! Please!

231
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:30,149
This crusade is our cause!

232
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:32,803
We must see it through to the end!

233
00:15:34,075 --> 00:15:35,910
He has to be stopped at all costs.

234
00:15:36,133 --> 00:15:38,204
And you and I are the only ones who can do it!

235
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,942
Yeah, you don't have to tell me!

236
00:15:40,967 --> 00:15:45,440
Infidels! Why do you fight against
your country AND your Emperor?!

237
00:15:45,465 --> 00:15:47,288
Don't try to twist what this is!

238
00:15:47,496 --> 00:15:49,472
It's not like I'm siding with the rebels.

239
00:15:49,804 --> 00:15:51,958
But a soldier is supposed to protect the innocent.

240
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,475
And that's what I'm gonna do!

241
00:15:57,038 --> 00:15:58,551
He sounds like a handful.

242
00:15:59,551 --> 00:16:00,656
Yes, he is.

243
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,124
Hmm?

244
00:16:01,636 --> 00:16:03,738
But we could use more people like him.

245
00:16:11,893 --> 00:16:14,573
We can postpone our little scrap, right, Fly Boy?

246
00:16:15,316 --> 00:16:16,942
That won't be necessary.

247
00:16:20,591 --> 00:16:21,325
Nothing!

248
00:16:23,831 --> 00:16:25,614
Grand Chariot can't even hurt it!

249
00:16:29,217 --> 00:16:30,497
We have to keep fighting!

250
00:16:31,092 --> 00:16:33,041
The second we give in, we lose!

251
00:16:43,442 --> 00:16:44,531
What was that?!

252
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,448
Look out!

253
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,475
That felt different somehow.

254
00:16:51,242 --> 00:16:55,439
No matter how resilient your opponent may
seem, there's always a weak spot somewhere.

255
00:16:56,379 --> 00:16:59,962
Try to remember that next time you're
in battle so you can disarm your enemy.

256
00:16:59,987 --> 00:17:00,628
Su...

257
00:17:01,816 --> 00:17:03,677
Wave! Make me an opening!

258
00:17:04,976 --> 00:17:05,549
Got it!

259
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:08,548
This traitor must be executed!

260
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:13,354
For betraying the emperor, you are sentenced to DEATH!

261
00:17:29,224 --> 00:17:31,364
This is the only place that seems worn down!

262
00:17:31,726 --> 00:17:32,965
It's just like you said!

263
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,684
There's gotta be a weak spot somewhere, right, Su?

264
00:17:35,924 --> 00:17:37,225
Nothing's invincible!

265
00:17:37,492 --> 00:17:39,823
DAMN YOU!

266
00:17:42,917 --> 00:17:43,655
Tatsumi!

267
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:53,476
Just give up!

268
00:17:53,717 --> 00:17:55,975
Why do you have to be so persistent?

269
00:17:56,821 --> 00:17:59,982
We're begging you, please... please surrender!

270
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,333
Don't underestimate me!

271
00:18:02,952 --> 00:18:05,324
I've been through more pain than you can imagine!

272
00:18:05,657 --> 00:18:08,544
I carry the hopes of all my friends who've gone before me,

273
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,333
and I won't allow their deaths to be in vain!

274
00:18:17,675 --> 00:18:20,540
There will always be hardships and misery, Tatsumi.

275
00:18:21,093 --> 00:18:22,542
In fact, that's all we get.

276
00:18:23,857 --> 00:18:26,463
But this is the path we chose for ourselves.

277
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:27,955
Bro?

278
00:18:28,597 --> 00:18:31,204
We should feel fortunate to do what no one else will.

279
00:18:31,476 --> 00:18:33,085
It's how the world is changed.

280
00:18:33,686 --> 00:18:35,911
And then, we simply disappear.

281
00:18:36,257 --> 00:18:36,876
Bro!

282
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:38,809
Come on and scream!

283
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,202
With all the fire in your soul!

284
00:18:42,534 --> 00:18:45,871
Yaaahhh...

285
00:18:45,944 --> 00:18:49,314
INCURSIO!

286
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:58,001
The ancient soul inside the armor is causing it to evolve!

287
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:11,522
Stay back...

288
00:19:24,645 --> 00:19:26,631
GET AWAY FROM ME!

289
00:19:26,731 --> 00:19:28,972
Yaaahhh!!

290
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,190
Are you trying to get killed?!

291
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,608
Of course I'm not!

292
00:19:39,005 --> 00:19:40,758
I made a promise, didn't I?!

293
00:19:48,512 --> 00:19:51,073
I swore I'd make it back alive!

294
00:19:51,098 --> 00:19:52,900
TATSUMI!

295
00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:08,927
He did it!

296
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,675
I'm sorry.

297
00:21:00,591 --> 00:21:02,440
I guess I broke my promise.

298
00:21:13,915 --> 00:21:15,741
You gave me your word!

299
00:21:16,268 --> 00:21:17,927
You gave me your word!

300
00:21:19,437 --> 00:21:23,061
Tatsumi... Tatsumi...

301
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:35,948
Is it over?

302
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,276
Has the empire... fallen?

303
00:21:40,191 --> 00:21:41,813
Have we failed our reign?

304
00:21:48,172 --> 00:21:48,930
Tatsumi...

305
00:21:50,035 --> 00:21:50,732
is dead.
