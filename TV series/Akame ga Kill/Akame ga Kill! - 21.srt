1
00:00:04,583 --> 00:00:05,576
I'm going.

2
00:00:05,823 --> 00:00:07,453
And I won't let you stop me.

3
00:00:07,628 --> 00:00:08,647
It's a trap.

4
00:00:08,933 --> 00:00:10,820
I don't need you to tell me that.

5
00:00:11,463 --> 00:00:15,440
But still... I won't just sit
here and watch them execute Tatsumi!

6
00:00:16,042 --> 00:00:17,587
You've really changed, Mine.

7
00:00:18,011 --> 00:00:20,196
Remember when you were trying to stop me?

8
00:00:20,807 --> 00:00:24,371
Please don't say something stupid like
we need to save him. That won't work.

9
00:00:24,743 --> 00:00:26,219
That was a long time ago.

10
00:00:26,302 --> 00:00:28,472
Tatsumi means something different to me now.

11
00:00:28,873 --> 00:00:29,884
I'm going too.

12
00:00:30,806 --> 00:00:34,080
There's no reason to put
yourself in danger. That's stupid!

13
00:00:34,152 --> 00:00:35,792
What you're planning is stupid!

14
00:00:36,334 --> 00:00:39,771
If we do this together, we have a
greater chance of making it back.

15
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:47,643
Y'know, you're starting to sound just
like him with all that pathetic optimism.

16
00:00:47,736 --> 00:00:50,051
You're just as bad as me, if not worse.

17
00:00:52,172 --> 00:00:54,738
Fine, you can tag along if it means that much to you!

18
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,116
Sounds like a plan!

19
00:00:57,297 --> 00:00:58,219
Leone!

20
00:00:58,244 --> 00:01:02,427
I'm the one who saw Tatsumi's potential and
pushed for him to join us in the first place.

21
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:07,090
If he were to get himself executed at this point
in the game, it would make me look like a jerk.

22
00:01:07,143 --> 00:01:09,113
So... Does that mean you're on board?

23
00:01:09,381 --> 00:01:10,649
We've made up our minds, Boss.

24
00:01:10,749 --> 00:01:11,922
Hope you're okay with it.

25
00:01:12,384 --> 00:01:14,012
Why would I have a problem with that?

26
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:15,618
The boss?

27
00:01:15,643 --> 00:01:20,813
If they're holding a public execution with the
intention of weakening the Revolutionary Army's morale,

28
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,428
then it's our responsibility to put a stop to it.

29
00:01:23,965 --> 00:01:28,502
Besides, I have no doubt we're going to
need Tatsumi and Incursio in the final battle.

30
00:01:28,941 --> 00:01:31,794
Awww! It's okay, we know you miss him.

31
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,566
Oh, you know I'm right.

32
00:01:34,893 --> 00:01:37,309
Then consider this an emergency mission.

33
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:39,076
Let's go get Tatsumi.

34
00:01:49,222 --> 00:01:50,138
Tatsumi...

35
00:03:24,781 --> 00:03:26,461
It's been a while, Tatsumi.

36
00:03:28,345 --> 00:03:30,526
I can't believe you were part of Night Raid.

37
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,583
I came in here ready to destroy you,

38
00:03:34,305 --> 00:03:37,040
but all my anger was gone once I saw your face.

39
00:03:37,254 --> 00:03:38,868
You must be so unhappy.

40
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:41,071
It's not too late to join me.

41
00:03:41,453 --> 00:03:44,856
If you do, I promise I'll forgive all your transgressions.

42
00:03:45,783 --> 00:03:47,966
Never! I will not fight for the Empire.

43
00:03:52,425 --> 00:03:55,512
If you won't accept my offer,
then you know what must happen.

44
00:03:55,537 --> 00:03:57,350
I will die for what I believe.

45
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,382
I won't ask where your friends are.

46
00:04:04,862 --> 00:04:07,475
All I want is for you to stand beside me.

47
00:04:08,292 --> 00:04:10,277
Why are you so fixated on me?

48
00:04:11,228 --> 00:04:13,365
My heart was drawn to you.

49
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,517
I want us to be together, Tatsumi.

50
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:17,433
No!

51
00:04:18,816 --> 00:04:23,200
I could never be with someone who's only desires
in this world are creating war and destruction!

52
00:04:25,308 --> 00:04:26,294
Is that right?

53
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:28,174
Then have it your way.

54
00:04:30,793 --> 00:04:33,712
I will perform your execution with my own hands.

55
00:04:34,172 --> 00:04:37,593
That way I can see for myself
the strength of your resolve.

56
00:04:38,622 --> 00:04:41,230
The commander said she was in love with Tatsumi, right?

57
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:43,268
So why is she doing this?

58
00:04:43,382 --> 00:04:46,211
Well, I suppose you could
think of it as an act of passion.

59
00:04:47,517 --> 00:04:49,108
Our orders were very clear.

60
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:53,470
Tomorrow during the execution, palace
defenses will be thinner than usual.

61
00:04:53,495 --> 00:04:55,373
We'll be expected to provide backup.

62
00:04:57,975 --> 00:05:00,951
But what is she thinking, killing the one she loves?

63
00:05:03,565 --> 00:05:05,419
It just doesn't make sense to me.

64
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:07,716
I understand how she feels.

65
00:05:08,405 --> 00:05:10,480
Instead of letting somebody else kill him,

66
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,612
she wants to be the one to do it.

67
00:05:14,145 --> 00:05:16,364
Just like how I want to kill my sister.

68
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,875
It's because I love her.

69
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,121
But now... it's...

70
00:05:27,471 --> 00:05:28,671
It's too late.

71
00:05:32,609 --> 00:05:34,990
I'm out of time. I can't...

72
00:05:35,806 --> 00:05:37,307
My sources have informed me that

73
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,684
the Great General Budo will be attending
the public execution along with Esdeath.

74
00:05:41,784 --> 00:05:42,716
Who's Budo?

75
00:05:43,053 --> 00:05:47,402
He's the only great general in the empire
and he has the loyalty of all the guards.

76
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,560
And his weapon, Adramelech, is quite terrifying.

77
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,476
Wow!

78
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,300
Susanoo?

79
00:05:52,373 --> 00:05:54,282
Are you ready to use your trump card?

80
00:05:54,415 --> 00:05:58,478
Yes, once you've given me the
word, I can activate it as needed.

81
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:05,791
We must complete this mission and
prove our comrades didn't die in vain.

82
00:06:05,869 --> 00:06:07,777
Thank you for your loyal service.

83
00:06:08,158 --> 00:06:09,311
Thank you, Lubbock.

84
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,537
People of this great nation!

85
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,849
We are most distraught by the rebels spreading
unfounded rumors about the fall of our empire.

86
00:06:29,213 --> 00:06:31,368
Disregard these allegations.

87
00:06:31,468 --> 00:06:35,612
We would like to assure you
that the empire is alive and well!

88
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:41,630
Today, one of their members shall be put to
death, in atonement for this traitorous behavior!

89
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:47,695
The Revolutionary Army has caused great unrest,
with these murderous criminals as their spearhead!

90
00:06:48,192 --> 00:06:50,487
And by brandishing the blade of greed,

91
00:06:50,512 --> 00:06:52,397
they've deceived honest people.

92
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:55,684
They're nothing but a violent gang of assassins!

93
00:06:58,574 --> 00:07:00,382
No matter what your numbers,

94
00:07:00,407 --> 00:07:02,901
and no matter what falsehoods you perpetuate,

95
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,741
We will not allow you to poison Our city!

96
00:07:06,048 --> 00:07:09,876
Mark my words: Our great empire will never fall!

97
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,649
We've done well, haven't We, Minister?

98
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:22,533
Impeccable as always, Your Majesty.

99
00:07:23,071 --> 00:07:27,768
General Esdeath, you may lop
off his head whenever you're ready.

100
00:07:28,483 --> 00:07:30,986
Hold on. Where do you think you're going?

101
00:07:31,046 --> 00:07:33,253
Excuse us, it's time for lunch.

102
00:07:33,722 --> 00:07:35,252
Come along, Your Grace.

103
00:07:36,154 --> 00:07:37,234
Lunch already?

104
00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:41,001
Then, could you oversee the execution, Budo? Please?

105
00:07:41,026 --> 00:07:41,761
Of course.

106
00:07:41,785 --> 00:07:43,045
Oh, I'm quite famished!

107
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,307
So the minister's making his escape.

108
00:08:13,937 --> 00:08:18,133
I know precisely where to cut whether
I want to maim or I want to kill.

109
00:08:20,623 --> 00:08:23,940
You told me you were prepared to die, did you not?

110
00:08:24,781 --> 00:08:29,458
If you're the man I think you are, then
you'll show me how strong your spirit is!

111
00:08:35,369 --> 00:08:36,644
Way to go, dummy!

112
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:38,195
You weren't supposed to get caught, y'know!

113
00:08:38,295 --> 00:08:40,102
Oh, no. What're you doing?!

114
00:08:40,382 --> 00:08:43,087
You are not allowed to worry me like that ever again!

115
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,175
Hey, watch where you're aiming that thing!

116
00:08:48,245 --> 00:08:49,627
Well, look who's here.

117
00:08:56,312 --> 00:08:58,502
So you finally came out to play.

118
00:08:58,882 --> 00:09:01,084
Well, you didn't leave me much of an option.

119
00:09:02,062 --> 00:09:03,755
Spoken like a true coward.

120
00:09:04,412 --> 00:09:05,745
It's been a long time.

121
00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:07,769
Whaddya say we do some catching up?

122
00:09:08,524 --> 00:09:10,086
In my torture chamber.

123
00:09:10,305 --> 00:09:12,941
Thanks, but I'm not really into that stuff.

124
00:09:13,109 --> 00:09:14,440
I think I'll pass.

125
00:09:17,984 --> 00:09:21,020
I'm glad you set up those
charges before you left, Lubbock.

126
00:09:21,234 --> 00:09:23,862
We didn't plan this, but they're being put to good use!

127
00:09:27,457 --> 00:09:32,395
I'd never suspect you'd enter the fray
without a strategy. It's so much fun.

128
00:09:32,473 --> 00:09:36,083
You must be here to rescue your
little partner, eh, Night Raid?!

129
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:38,458
Let's go!

130
00:09:38,603 --> 00:09:39,338
Understood.

131
00:09:42,002 --> 00:09:44,314
You handle General Budo for me, okay?

132
00:09:44,414 --> 00:09:46,907
What? But how am I supposed to
fight a guy with hair like that?

133
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:53,747
Revolutionary filth like you should never be
permitted to set foot inside the sacred coliseum!

134
00:09:54,487 --> 00:09:57,805
Prepare to be destroyed by my Imperial Arms!

135
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:00,884
Since you won't surrender...

136
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:02,968
You must die.

137
00:10:05,681 --> 00:10:07,817
Is that your Imperial Arms?

138
00:10:07,918 --> 00:10:08,900
It is.

139
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:10,768
I am Susanoo.

140
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,663
I don't care what it's called.

141
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:16,019
It won't need a name... after this!

142
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,092
Back off!

143
00:10:28,171 --> 00:10:29,762
Very nice! Keep it up!

144
00:10:34,064 --> 00:10:36,938
Man, you'd be easier to save if you weren't so damn tiny!

145
00:10:37,025 --> 00:10:39,124
Do you really think this is
the time to start picking on me?

146
00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:39,905
Look out!

147
00:10:41,251 --> 00:10:42,663
Ow, that hurt!

148
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,442
You must be their close-range fighter!

149
00:10:48,204 --> 00:10:49,657
Take the shot, hurry!

150
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,216
If she does, it'll surely kill you too!

151
00:10:52,403 --> 00:10:55,009
Oh no, my healing ability is pretty badass.

152
00:10:55,098 --> 00:10:56,710
Guess I have to trust you!

153
00:11:06,326 --> 00:11:09,035
I didn't expect it to paralyze my whole body!

154
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:11,028
An impressive team you have here.

155
00:11:11,595 --> 00:11:14,770
First that young man on the crucifix, and now you two.

156
00:11:14,994 --> 00:11:18,303
It's regrettable that you've chosen
the path of wickedness and treason.

157
00:11:18,328 --> 00:11:19,756
Who cares what you think?!

158
00:11:19,781 --> 00:11:23,630
Whether it's the right one or not, the
path will be my own, thank you very much!

159
00:11:25,295 --> 00:11:26,006
Mine!

160
00:11:28,531 --> 00:11:31,069
Oh really now? You finished already?

161
00:11:31,168 --> 00:11:33,678
Clearly, you don't realize what my weapon can do.

162
00:11:33,911 --> 00:11:36,290
This is my Adventurous Bunker Pumpkin.

163
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:40,137
And its firepower gets deadlier
the more dangerous the situation!

164
00:11:41,037 --> 00:11:43,780
It's to my advantage to have my back up against the wall!

165
00:11:44,134 --> 00:11:46,388
The greater the threat, the stronger I get!

166
00:11:54,517 --> 00:11:56,186
It's not charged enough yet!

167
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:58,336
You're not getting through!

168
00:12:06,324 --> 00:12:07,122
Found it!

169
00:12:07,713 --> 00:12:09,082
Hang in there, Tatsumi.

170
00:12:13,013 --> 00:12:14,096
Now freeze.

171
00:12:20,476 --> 00:12:21,484
Susanoo!

172
00:12:21,843 --> 00:12:25,819
What a shame. And to think I used to
have so much respect for you as a general.

173
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:27,843
I hope you have more to offer.

174
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,557
Why was I saving my energy?

175
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,235
This is Esdeath I'm dealing with!

176
00:12:32,048 --> 00:12:33,775
Magatama Manifest!

177
00:12:39,452 --> 00:12:40,682
What are you up to?

178
00:12:40,742 --> 00:12:44,616
Night Raid must be more resilient than
you think if we've survived this long.

179
00:12:44,985 --> 00:12:48,996
Even if he is frozen solid, I
wouldn't let my guard down just yet.

180
00:12:49,622 --> 00:12:51,321
Are you ready now, Susanoo?

181
00:12:51,817 --> 00:12:54,080
It's time to defeat Esdeath!

182
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:58,242
Must be your trump card. This should be good.

183
00:13:02,608 --> 00:13:04,992
But it won't be enough to overpower me.

184
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,636
You must realize that you're outmatched!

185
00:13:08,033 --> 00:13:09,661
Eight-Handed Mirror Shield!

186
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:15,861
She always has something.

187
00:13:18,457 --> 00:13:19,966
Man, this guy's annoying!

188
00:13:19,991 --> 00:13:21,461
Look out, he's gaining on you!

189
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,765
Don't worry, Tatsumi!

190
00:13:22,881 --> 00:13:24,938
I know it looks pretty serious from where you are,

191
00:13:24,963 --> 00:13:28,153
but I'm getting ready to turn the
tables on this loser and save you!

192
00:13:28,178 --> 00:13:32,981
Well then, it appears you possess everything
it takes to master that Imperial Arms.

193
00:13:33,027 --> 00:13:36,385
It seems to be fluently
resonating with your every emotion!

194
00:13:36,943 --> 00:13:38,156
Eat this!

195
00:13:40,472 --> 00:13:42,572
Either way, you're not going to win!

196
00:13:42,635 --> 00:13:45,009
You're about to eat those words, you pile of crap!

197
00:13:51,158 --> 00:13:52,698
Mine, no!

198
00:13:53,894 --> 00:13:55,244
I'm okay, Tatsumi.

199
00:13:56,169 --> 00:14:01,668
Don't you remember? I made a promise to myself,
I was gonna make something of my life, didn't I?

200
00:14:02,368 --> 00:14:05,459
My strength... is Pumpkin's strength!

201
00:14:10,369 --> 00:14:11,748
I'm not finished yet!

202
00:14:14,447 --> 00:14:18,092
Out of mercy, I'll go ahead
and put you out of your misery.

203
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:21,058
I don't need mercy from you.

204
00:14:24,415 --> 00:14:27,528
All of my people are going to
walk out of this place alive.

205
00:14:27,773 --> 00:14:30,673
I'm not losing any more friends! I'm not!

206
00:14:30,776 --> 00:14:35,290
Allow me to demonstrate the ultimate
power of Adramelech's trump card!

207
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,831
Solid Shooter!

208
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:45,378
This is bad!

209
00:14:45,858 --> 00:14:46,755
Mine, don't!

210
00:14:50,904 --> 00:14:53,075
Please, Pumpkin... Please.

211
00:14:53,385 --> 00:14:54,808
Channel my feelings!

212
00:14:54,841 --> 00:14:56,703
Say goodbye, little girl!

213
00:15:01,746 --> 00:15:02,622
Tatsumi!

214
00:15:10,063 --> 00:15:13,763
YOU CAN'T KILL ME!

215
00:15:18,904 --> 00:15:19,719
What? No!

216
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:48,958
I... won...

217
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,184
Hold on!

218
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:54,703
Tatsumi!

219
00:15:56,349 --> 00:15:57,230
Mine!

220
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:09,762
Please... not this!

221
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,429
Oh no...

222
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:15,212
The mission's complete!

223
00:16:15,412 --> 00:16:17,000
Get back to base, NOW!

224
00:16:18,713 --> 00:16:21,543
Tatsumi, I won't let you leave!

225
00:16:23,634 --> 00:16:26,180
Sacred Sword of the Heavens!

226
00:16:32,522 --> 00:16:33,395
I gotcha!

227
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,087
Everything in sight will be encased in ice.

228
00:16:41,479 --> 00:16:42,705
Mahapadma!

229
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:52,594
That ability puts such enormous strain on me,
I'm not capable of using it as often as I'd like.

230
00:16:54,376 --> 00:16:56,737
Too much would be overkill, anyway.

231
00:16:59,321 --> 00:17:00,998
What... what happened?

232
00:17:01,677 --> 00:17:03,327
Esdeath, what did you do?!

233
00:17:03,493 --> 00:17:05,643
Oh, I just froze time and space.

234
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:09,301
It's my special trump card that I
developed for just such an occasion.

235
00:17:09,647 --> 00:17:14,659
I wanted something that would not only keep
Tatsumi from escaping, but effectively slay my enemies.

236
00:17:16,074 --> 00:17:18,222
SUSANOO, GET OUT OF THERE!

237
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:22,916
I suppose I should congratulate
you for inspiring me to use it.

238
00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:25,502
Susanoo's core!

239
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,459
You lose.

240
00:17:37,336 --> 00:17:40,371
Now if you'll accompany me to the torture chambers...

241
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:46,018
What?! Impossible!

242
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,437
It's regenerating itself!

243
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:52,645
This makes three times. It's our last shot.

244
00:17:53,192 --> 00:17:55,132
It'll take everything I have left.

245
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,008
If I exhaust my life force,

246
00:17:57,353 --> 00:17:59,745
I'm sure I can make him even more powerful.

247
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:05,404
If General Budo is dead, then my life was well spent.

248
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,974
I can die peacefully knowing that.

249
00:18:08,745 --> 00:18:10,837
The rest is up to you, Susanoo.

250
00:18:11,243 --> 00:18:13,032
Burn in Hell, Najenda!

251
00:18:14,071 --> 00:18:16,543
Celestial Treasure Magatama!

252
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,167
Well, he just boosted his power.

253
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,023
Su, let me help you!

254
00:18:25,207 --> 00:18:26,471
Run away, Tatsumi.

255
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:29,523
But he's powered up now!

256
00:18:29,883 --> 00:18:31,956
It's just the way his attacks overlapped.

257
00:18:32,317 --> 00:18:35,581
It's making it appear as though
Susanoo's strength increased by double.

258
00:18:36,268 --> 00:18:40,165
But the level he is right now, he'll
never even come close to defeating Esdeath.

259
00:18:42,117 --> 00:18:42,808
Su!

260
00:18:43,217 --> 00:18:46,737
It looks like you've gotten tougher,
but you're still not strong enough.

261
00:18:47,176 --> 00:18:50,223
Despite your best efforts, you're still losing this fight.

262
00:18:50,981 --> 00:18:51,827
Don't do it!

263
00:18:51,921 --> 00:18:55,445
Please try not to forget the reason
we came here in the first place.

264
00:18:56,021 --> 00:18:57,151
Run, Tatsumi.

265
00:18:57,784 --> 00:18:58,590
But, Su...

266
00:18:58,977 --> 00:19:04,602
In my thousand years as an Imperial Arms, my time
with this group has been the most fun I've ever had.

267
00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:06,450
I have no regrets.

268
00:19:07,323 --> 00:19:08,389
Susanoo...

269
00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:10,382
I bid you farewell.

270
00:19:17,175 --> 00:19:18,183
Stop right there!

271
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,428
I don't think so!

272
00:19:22,941 --> 00:19:24,371
That mirror again.

273
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:27,306
I will never let you catch up to them!

274
00:19:27,473 --> 00:19:31,827
So you're using yourself as a shield in
order to buy time for your companions to escape.

275
00:19:32,167 --> 00:19:35,566
Where does Najenda find all these mushy little softies?

276
00:19:35,606 --> 00:19:37,383
I am nothing more than a weapon.

277
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,525
And now I have no trump card.

278
00:19:40,035 --> 00:19:43,888
Given my situation, wouldn't you agree
that this is my best possible option?

279
00:19:43,987 --> 00:19:46,293
You said your name was Susanoo, yes?

280
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:49,645
So you WERE listening.

281
00:19:50,182 --> 00:19:55,218
I will forever remember it as the name of a
legendary warrior, and NOT an Imperial Arms.

282
00:19:55,921 --> 00:20:01,565
Now, as you face your demise, I will enjoy watching
your sad attempts to avoid your inevitable end!

283
00:20:07,543 --> 00:20:08,840
We're going back to the base.

284
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,367
Just hang in there!

285
00:20:10,508 --> 00:20:11,830
You'll be all healed up in no time.

286
00:20:11,855 --> 00:20:12,879
Put me down.

287
00:20:13,121 --> 00:20:14,046
Don't be an idiot.

288
00:20:14,278 --> 00:20:15,729
Your injuries are serious.

289
00:20:16,094 --> 00:20:17,875
Just do it, okay?

290
00:20:27,432 --> 00:20:28,298
Tatsumi?

291
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,832
I'm right here.

292
00:20:30,703 --> 00:20:33,721
Ever since you saved me back in Kyoroku,

293
00:20:34,447 --> 00:20:36,641
I've been trying to find a way to repay you.

294
00:20:36,816 --> 00:20:37,438
That's why I...

295
00:20:37,463 --> 00:20:39,385
No... You didn't have to do that!

296
00:20:40,984 --> 00:20:42,960
We can... call it even now.

297
00:20:42,985 --> 00:20:46,040
Yeah, sure! We're even. Just
don't give up on me, all right?!

298
00:20:46,405 --> 00:20:47,674
You're so stupid.

299
00:20:47,902 --> 00:20:50,506
I can't just heal myself like Leone does.

300
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:53,200
I wanted to be...

301
00:20:53,797 --> 00:20:56,084
I wanted to be by your side 'til the end.

302
00:20:56,164 --> 00:20:57,386
Don't talk like that!

303
00:20:57,697 --> 00:20:59,936
'Cause we're supposed to be... together...

304
00:21:00,265 --> 00:21:01,282
Together forever!

305
00:21:01,766 --> 00:21:04,212
You're such a bad liar, Tatsumi.

306
00:21:05,072 --> 00:21:08,334
And you're... the biggest crybaby I ever met.

307
00:21:08,613 --> 00:21:09,731
I can't believe you...

308
00:21:10,342 --> 00:21:11,837
Why did you have to save me?

309
00:21:12,103 --> 00:21:13,389
If it meant you were gonna...

310
00:21:14,002 --> 00:21:14,880
You can't just...

311
00:21:16,614 --> 00:21:19,790
A man... should never let anyone see him cry.

312
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:21,461
Hey...

313
00:21:22,553 --> 00:21:23,551
Tatsumi?

314
00:21:23,775 --> 00:21:24,256
Yeah?

315
00:21:24,342 --> 00:21:25,284
I'm glad I...

316
00:21:25,843 --> 00:21:27,833
I'm glad I fell in love with you.

317
00:21:28,193 --> 00:21:28,687
Mine...

318
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,116
You can't die...

319
00:21:30,228 --> 00:21:31,376
PLEASE don't die!

320
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:34,410
You have to survive and make
something of your life, right?!

321
00:21:34,828 --> 00:21:36,165
