1
00:00:02,207 --> 00:00:06,000
I wanted... to spend more time with everyone.

2
00:00:10,531 --> 00:00:12,625
I wish we could've kept fighting together.

3
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,885
If only I was... I don't know...

4
00:00:19,313 --> 00:00:21,815
Hey, Tatsumi, you gonna sleep all day?

5
00:00:21,973 --> 00:00:22,428
Oh!

6
00:00:23,659 --> 00:00:25,125
No, I'm up!

7
00:00:26,073 --> 00:00:27,862
Sorry you guys, I overslept.

8
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:32,667
It's time to infiltrate the Path of Peace headquarters.

9
00:00:32,874 --> 00:00:33,693
Get it together!

10
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,227
Yeah yeah, I know!

11
00:00:35,647 --> 00:00:37,694
And after we clean out the filth in Kyoroku,

12
00:00:37,782 --> 00:00:40,322
that's when the Revolutionary
Army will make its move, right?

13
00:00:41,912 --> 00:00:43,958
There's no time to dwell on the past right now.

14
00:00:44,515 --> 00:00:46,801
I have to overthrow this disgusting Empire.

15
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,187
This madness must be stopped at the source!

16
00:02:26,076 --> 00:02:27,243
Counselor Bolic.

17
00:02:27,422 --> 00:02:29,775
Via direct orders from Minister Honest,

18
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,959
the Jaegers Special Police force
is here to ensure your safety.

19
00:02:34,026 --> 00:02:35,512
My my.

20
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,785
Who would've guessed he'd send
the one and only all-powerful

21
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,685
General Esdeath of all people
to look after this great estate?

22
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,309
I must tell you I've never felt safer in my life.

23
00:02:45,334 --> 00:02:48,992
We've received a report stating
that Night Raid is already in the city.

24
00:02:49,017 --> 00:02:51,885
We'll need to use your guest rooms until the hunt is over.

25
00:02:52,054 --> 00:02:53,364
It's my pleasure.

26
00:02:53,404 --> 00:02:57,968
Heh, I think you'll find our hospitality quite satisfying.

27
00:02:58,994 --> 00:03:01,373
I have no interest in playing with your pets.

28
00:03:01,427 --> 00:03:05,569
But, as for those spies watching
my team since we walked in...

29
00:03:05,594 --> 00:03:06,847
I'd love to meet them.

30
00:03:06,974 --> 00:03:09,350
Ooh, well played.

31
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,486
I should've expected you'd notice.

32
00:03:12,832 --> 00:03:13,927
Who are those guys?

33
00:03:13,965 --> 00:03:18,154
I borrowed these highly disturbed
individuals from the Imperial Fist Temple

34
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,147
to keep this religion under my control.

35
00:03:21,258 --> 00:03:24,690
Say hello to the Four Rakshasa Demons!

36
00:03:24,831 --> 00:03:28,997
Oh! So that's why I hadn't seen them in
the Capital; I wondered where they went.

37
00:03:29,022 --> 00:03:30,771
It actually works out nicely,

38
00:03:30,796 --> 00:03:32,794
they usually work as my bodyguards,

39
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:37,487
but since you're here, I can put them on the
offensive and let them handle those assassins for you.

40
00:03:37,512 --> 00:03:41,642
Wait a second! How can they go against
Night Raid without Imperial Arms...

41
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,058
Oh don't worry your pretty little head!

42
00:03:44,232 --> 00:03:48,086
Taking out Imperial Arms users
just happens to be our specialty.

43
00:03:48,231 --> 00:03:49,766
It's what I live for...

44
00:03:50,713 --> 00:03:53,508
No matter how unbeatable an Imperial Arms might seem...

45
00:03:53,548 --> 00:03:56,938
you can't escape the fact the
wielder's only flesh and blood underneath.

46
00:03:57,012 --> 00:03:59,926
So like, there's a million
different ways to defeat one, y'know?

47
00:04:00,801 --> 00:04:04,150
These four just happen to be the
Minister's personal executioners.

48
00:04:04,175 --> 00:04:06,473
And as their name implies, they're good at it.

49
00:04:06,498 --> 00:04:09,126
He ain't lyin'. We can handle this.

50
00:04:09,338 --> 00:04:12,248
So just sit back, relax, have a few cocktails and...

51
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:17,115
While it may be true that you've built up an
impressive résumé... you shouldn't let your guard down.

52
00:04:17,448 --> 00:04:19,201
Ooh, so sinister.

53
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:21,314
You're giving me chills, General Esdeath.

54
00:04:21,602 --> 00:04:23,185
I think I'm falling for you.

55
00:04:23,549 --> 00:04:24,715
That's strange...

56
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:29,574
if the Minister's favorite pawns already had
it under control, why did he choose to send us?

57
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,071
This religious group must mean
a lot more to him than I thought.

58
00:04:40,253 --> 00:04:41,086
Kurome!

59
00:04:41,626 --> 00:04:42,533
Please no...

60
00:04:42,774 --> 00:04:44,783
If only I'd gotten here a little sooner...

61
00:04:44,923 --> 00:04:46,762
Maybe Bols would still be alive...

62
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,028
And and what about his wife and his daughter?

63
00:04:49,786 --> 00:04:52,580
God how in the hell am I supposed to report this?!

64
00:04:54,109 --> 00:04:55,022
I don't know...

65
00:04:55,075 --> 00:04:58,687
but the reason you were attacked was
because you were trying to save Kurome, right?

66
00:04:58,807 --> 00:05:02,298
That's why the Commander said you wouldn't
be held responsible for what happened.

67
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:05,259
I understand how you feel, but please stay calm.

68
00:05:07,978 --> 00:05:08,545
Damn it...

69
00:05:09,045 --> 00:05:09,933
Damn it!

70
00:05:11,683 --> 00:05:12,603
How's Kurome?

71
00:05:13,477 --> 00:05:14,600
She's still sleeping.

72
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,990
But the doctor believes she's healed
enough that she can recover soon.

73
00:05:18,015 --> 00:05:23,360
That's good. I'm trying to identify the body of
the girl who attacked her, but I'm coming up short.

74
00:05:23,806 --> 00:05:27,124
She was probably one of Night Raid's Imperial Arms users.

75
00:05:27,652 --> 00:05:28,512
I agree.

76
00:05:28,922 --> 00:05:29,712
Commander?

77
00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:33,215
Is it okay if I feed that evil lady's remains to Koro?

78
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,508
Sure, why not?

79
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:35,770
Haa!

80
00:05:36,112 --> 00:05:37,074
Time to get up!

81
00:05:37,099 --> 00:05:37,887
Ah!

82
00:05:38,581 --> 00:05:39,542
K-Kurome!

83
00:05:40,422 --> 00:05:41,739
I feel a lot better.

84
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:43,640
Now that I've had a little nap.

85
00:05:43,665 --> 00:05:45,327
What? You're kidding me!

86
00:05:45,447 --> 00:05:47,953
But your wounds... they were... fatal.

87
00:05:47,978 --> 00:05:48,786
Commander!

88
00:05:49,491 --> 00:05:52,418
If it pleases you, I'd like
to continue with my mission now.

89
00:05:55,533 --> 00:05:57,400
As you can see, I'm ready to fight!

90
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,727
That's fine.

91
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:02,259
But if you're coming with us, you can't fall behind.

92
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,276
In thirty minutes we're leaving with or without you.

93
00:06:05,316 --> 00:06:05,869
Right!

94
00:06:10,848 --> 00:06:12,581
Wave? Is something wrong?

95
00:06:12,675 --> 00:06:14,234
Huh? Uh, no!

96
00:06:17,985 --> 00:06:19,905
Hey, you okay in there?

97
00:06:20,032 --> 00:06:21,858
You're not feeling better at all, are you?

98
00:06:22,265 --> 00:06:24,738
I'm really thinking you need to sit this mission out.

99
00:06:24,787 --> 00:06:26,604
No! I'm fine.

100
00:06:27,015 --> 00:06:28,342
How can you say that?

101
00:06:28,508 --> 00:06:30,703
I'm gonna let the Commander know you're not ready for...

102
00:06:31,187 --> 00:06:31,587
Ah...

103
00:06:31,688 --> 00:06:32,382
Uhh...

104
00:06:32,538 --> 00:06:33,078
Kurome!

105
00:06:37,763 --> 00:06:39,077
In my old squad,

106
00:06:39,355 --> 00:06:41,537
if they find out you can't fight anymore...

107
00:06:41,591 --> 00:06:44,376
they simply killed you to be sure that you'd never talk!

108
00:06:44,756 --> 00:06:46,450
What? Kill you?

109
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:48,557
If I get kicked out of the Jaegers...

110
00:06:48,794 --> 00:06:50,594
I might... I might...

111
00:06:50,621 --> 00:06:51,676
You'll be okay!

112
00:06:51,701 --> 00:06:53,786
If you tell the Commander, she'll protect you!

113
00:06:53,811 --> 00:06:55,311
She can't help me with this!

114
00:06:55,795 --> 00:06:57,695
The only way is to keep fighting.

115
00:06:57,809 --> 00:06:59,978
I won't allow myself to be discarded.

116
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:02,782
I didn't come into this terrible
world to go out like that!

117
00:07:02,807 --> 00:07:05,197
If anyone kills me, it will be in battle.

118
00:07:05,574 --> 00:07:08,078
Just like my friends who died when we were kids.

119
00:07:09,809 --> 00:07:10,748
Kurome.

120
00:07:13,581 --> 00:07:15,467
Sorry I made you worry, Wave.

121
00:07:15,715 --> 00:07:17,046
I really am alright.

122
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:20,990
Just let me recover a little more; And
I should be back to my old self again.

123
00:07:21,948 --> 00:07:22,778
Hmm...

124
00:07:25,722 --> 00:07:28,295
Good news is: We're pretty far away from the Capital,

125
00:07:28,402 --> 00:07:31,009
so we probably don't need to
worry about wanted posters, do we?

126
00:07:31,222 --> 00:07:34,405
We can't be sure the Jaegers haven't
been going around posting new ones.

127
00:07:34,472 --> 00:07:35,530
Let's try to be caref-.

128
00:07:35,774 --> 00:07:38,889
Are you frickin' serious, you couldn't
even let me get the words out of my mouth?!

129
00:07:39,535 --> 00:07:41,126
Look I understand what you're saying.

130
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:42,519
Hm... Oh...

131
00:07:42,992 --> 00:07:45,265
But isn't there such a thing as being too careful?

132
00:07:46,429 --> 00:07:48,866
The enemy might notice if we start acting all jumpy.

133
00:07:48,974 --> 00:07:50,423
So we have to be natural.

134
00:07:50,933 --> 00:07:52,783
He was crushed when Chelsea died...

135
00:07:53,547 --> 00:07:56,613
but now here he is, taking the
assignment with a brave face.

136
00:07:57,316 --> 00:07:59,045
Hmph! He's growing up.

137
00:07:59,773 --> 00:08:02,227
Whatever, I guess you do kinda have a point.

138
00:08:03,061 --> 00:08:03,727
Oh!

139
00:08:04,034 --> 00:08:05,741
Wow, this is really good!

140
00:08:05,841 --> 00:08:08,540
Yep! You can't get ice cream this good just anywhere.

141
00:08:11,047 --> 00:08:12,121
Speaking of which,

142
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,749
have you noticed how much busier it is here than the city?

143
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,460
Thanks to their underground resources and that religion.

144
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,599
Religion?

145
00:08:18,974 --> 00:08:20,308
Yeah, it's big bucks.

146
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,122
But the way they've got it set up right now,

147
00:08:22,174 --> 00:08:25,468
the vast majority of the profits
go straight to the Minister's wallet.

148
00:08:25,574 --> 00:08:26,375
That pig.

149
00:08:26,721 --> 00:08:28,810
These people have no idea they're being taken.

150
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:31,748
Everyone in the resistance knows the truth,

151
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,707
but Bolic keeps their hands pretty much tied.

152
00:08:35,323 --> 00:08:37,576
That's why we're gonna teach that bastard a lesson.

153
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:42,041
Yep. But we can't do anything until we
figure out our way around town, right?

154
00:08:42,066 --> 00:08:42,672
Oh yeah!

155
00:08:43,087 --> 00:08:44,678
Let's see what's outside the city next!

156
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,067
Sounds good.

157
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,675
Since Lubb was all gung-ho about it, we'll let
him handle the danger zone around the cathedral.

158
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,823
Jeez! This place is like a maze.

159
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,693
Well, at least it's fairly easy to get
lost in the crowd and feel things out.

160
00:09:00,527 --> 00:09:02,600
Oops, careful.

161
00:09:03,686 --> 00:09:06,148
Luckily the Empire doesn't know my face or my name.

162
00:09:06,741 --> 00:09:10,610
And the more info I bring back the
more points I can score with Najenda!

163
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,252
You've made me so happy...

164
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,718
Hehaheha...

165
00:09:16,135 --> 00:09:17,049
Hey, Shuten.

166
00:09:17,508 --> 00:09:20,648
That guy down there totally
looks like he's sniffing around.

167
00:09:20,954 --> 00:09:24,444
My intuition tells me, he's got to be an enemy for sure.

168
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,530
The way he's moving is a dead giveaway.

169
00:09:26,815 --> 00:09:29,660
The guy carries himself as if
he's already seen a lot of action.

170
00:09:29,685 --> 00:09:32,883
He probably thinks he's being pretty
cautious, but he can't hide it from me.

171
00:09:32,908 --> 00:09:34,304
Meaning he's guilty!

172
00:09:34,476 --> 00:09:36,025
Are you ready to kill him then?

173
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:37,840
Don't call it that. Please.

174
00:09:38,247 --> 00:09:40,108
I like to think of it as 'freeing his spirit.'

175
00:09:40,849 --> 00:09:42,251
Based on our observations,

176
00:09:42,276 --> 00:09:47,870
we believe there's an underground path near this cemetery
that passes through Bolic's mansion to the cathedral.

177
00:09:47,895 --> 00:09:50,270
So if we found the entrance to the tunnel...

178
00:09:50,295 --> 00:09:52,560
we could easily slip into Bolic's basement.

179
00:09:53,202 --> 00:09:54,728
It'll take a while to find it.

180
00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:56,963
Since there is quite a lot of land to cover.

181
00:09:57,369 --> 00:09:58,070
Hmm...

182
00:09:59,035 --> 00:10:01,710
We should also bear in mind
that it might be full of traps.

183
00:10:02,215 --> 00:10:03,810
Hehe...

184
00:10:04,455 --> 00:10:06,055
Well, well, well.

185
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:10,095
Did you think no one would notice you were here, Akame?

186
00:10:10,742 --> 00:10:13,309
Ibara. So you're in Kyoroku too.

187
00:10:13,824 --> 00:10:17,679
Oh, you mean you remember me? I'm touched.

188
00:10:17,749 --> 00:10:21,768
It's not like we really knew each
other back on the assassination squad.

189
00:10:21,882 --> 00:10:25,486
I knew we'd see the Four Rakshasa
Demons by going for the Minister...

190
00:10:25,815 --> 00:10:28,263
but I wasn't expecting this until the final battle.

191
00:10:28,288 --> 00:10:32,189
Hehe... Such a naughty girl for betraying the Empire...

192
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:35,048
I'm kinda honored to be the one to punish you!

193
00:10:38,253 --> 00:10:39,419
I don't think so!

194
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,939
Oh, really!

195
00:10:42,912 --> 00:10:43,672
Ha!

196
00:10:46,086 --> 00:10:47,120
Haa!

197
00:10:48,045 --> 00:10:49,759
Haha...

198
00:10:50,071 --> 00:10:53,728
On top of all our training, we
were given another little advantage!

199
00:10:53,795 --> 00:10:57,927
We drank a special broth made from
mountain Lake-Krakens living near the temple.

200
00:10:57,952 --> 00:11:01,255
It lets me do some 'unusual' things with my body!

201
00:11:03,566 --> 00:11:05,828
Crap! He just came at me out of nowhere!

202
00:11:05,961 --> 00:11:07,297
How did I blow my cover?!

203
00:11:07,322 --> 00:11:10,155
Hehe... Come back and fight like a man, you coward?

204
00:11:13,786 --> 00:11:15,553
Uh-oh, you dead already?

205
00:11:15,728 --> 00:11:16,932
Well hell you're no fun.

206
00:11:16,957 --> 00:11:18,899
Come on, get outta here.

207
00:11:19,485 --> 00:11:24,977
My string armor blocked that attack, but I managed to
stop my pulse by using Cross Tail around my blood vessels.

208
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:28,305
It's not very comfortable, so
you can be on your way now, alright?

209
00:11:28,763 --> 00:11:32,694
In the end, you were just an insignificant
little pest not even worth my time.

210
00:11:32,928 --> 00:11:33,681
Ah, well.

211
00:11:33,706 --> 00:11:35,541
That's it, walk away.

212
00:11:35,566 --> 00:11:37,873
I'm getting a little tired of playing dead in the street.

213
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:40,178
Hey Shuten there's another one headed your way.

214
00:11:40,203 --> 00:11:42,928
And it looks like she's a revolutionary spy too.

215
00:11:43,294 --> 00:11:44,094
Uh-oh...

216
00:11:44,607 --> 00:11:46,895
I bet that's the girl I was supposed to meet up with.

217
00:11:47,435 --> 00:11:49,268
Sorry babe, you're on your own.

218
00:11:49,888 --> 00:11:53,163
Well, if she's a spy she should
be prepared for stuff like this.

219
00:11:54,101 --> 00:11:58,370
Well now, another poor lamb
lost in this frightening world.

220
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:03,826
I'd be happy to help you out and free your
spirit for you, you should be thanking me!

221
00:12:04,245 --> 00:12:07,846
Ah! Please let me go...

222
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:13,298
Nope, I can't do it!

223
00:12:13,825 --> 00:12:16,773
I won't let you kill an ally,
especially a cutie like that.

224
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:20,023
But I checked you, you didn't have a pulse.

225
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:24,346
That was dumb! If you had stayed
still we would've had like no idea!

226
00:12:24,906 --> 00:12:25,773
Here's the thing.

227
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:27,888
Because of the role I play on the team...

228
00:12:28,172 --> 00:12:31,468
I usually avoid as many head-on
confrontations as possible.

229
00:12:32,358 --> 00:12:32,995
But...

230
00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:35,585
When push comes to shove, I don't play around.

231
00:12:35,712 --> 00:12:37,185
And I don't hold back!

232
00:12:42,247 --> 00:12:44,654
I'll kick both of your asses at the same time!

233
00:12:50,278 --> 00:12:52,600
That is one freaky weapon of yours!

234
00:12:52,706 --> 00:12:56,035
Murasame is the perfect sword for damaged goods like you!

235
00:12:56,201 --> 00:12:59,561
C'mon, c'mon, I know you can
move faster than that little lady!

236
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:04,406
It's too bad you left before completing your training!

237
00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:06,914
Thanks! I'll be taking that!

238
00:13:07,547 --> 00:13:08,503
Hehe...

239
00:13:12,338 --> 00:13:15,078
Huh? What the hell's wrong with this thing?!

240
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,926
Huh? Ah!

241
00:13:21,044 --> 00:13:22,054
Don't tell me...

242
00:13:22,318 --> 00:13:27,139
you planned all this from the beginning
and actually let me take your weapon from you!

243
00:13:27,293 --> 00:13:30,940
The answer was clear as soon as
you couldn't understand Murasame.

244
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,204
There was no way it would bond with you.

245
00:13:34,316 --> 00:13:36,244
Arrrgh, damn you!

246
00:13:36,312 --> 00:13:38,578
You little bitch!

247
00:13:41,808 --> 00:13:44,618
Looks like my cursed blade didn't take a liking to you.

248
00:13:49,397 --> 00:13:52,470
It may have something to do with your winning personality.

249
00:13:52,838 --> 00:13:56,745
Heh. You're a pretty messed up chick, aren't you?

250
00:13:57,066 --> 00:13:59,614
Careful, I think I might be falling in love.

251
00:14:00,412 --> 00:14:02,555
I'm kinda into that sorta thing...

252
00:14:07,174 --> 00:14:09,651
Surprise attacks don't work on you, I see.

253
00:14:09,676 --> 00:14:11,104
A Jaeger I presume.

254
00:14:11,345 --> 00:14:12,030
Yes.

255
00:14:12,524 --> 00:14:15,229
Now I know Akame of Night Raid is in the city.

256
00:14:15,712 --> 00:14:17,627
Handling recon is my job.

257
00:14:17,778 --> 00:14:19,045
I was watching you fight...

258
00:14:19,098 --> 00:14:21,670
so I've just learned a great deal about Murasame.

259
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,077
The Four Demons and the Jaegers.

260
00:14:28,512 --> 00:14:30,425
I hope everyone's okay.

261
00:14:31,578 --> 00:14:33,000
Well? Come at me!

262
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,087
Yeah I don't think so!

263
00:14:35,112 --> 00:14:38,114
That string will slice me to
pieces if I get too close to it.

264
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,093
Oh, I guess you noticed.

265
00:14:42,518 --> 00:14:45,405
I'm gonna free your spirit like I should've done before.

266
00:14:46,358 --> 00:14:47,443
Fist Temple...

267
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,765
Hundred Fists! Aah!

268
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,223
Thanks, but I didn't ask for that!

269
00:14:54,369 --> 00:14:56,660
Whoa. You're very good with your hands.

270
00:14:57,219 --> 00:14:59,596
I guess that thread is your Imperial Arms.

271
00:15:00,189 --> 00:15:03,251
If it is, then that makes you a member of Night Raid.

272
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:06,908
This time I'll split your head open
to be totally positive you're dead.

273
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:10,018
Sorry, you're cute and all;
But I'm not into that kinda thing!

274
00:15:11,129 --> 00:15:11,715
Hm...

275
00:15:12,152 --> 00:15:13,572
Strings, bind together!

276
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:19,000
Now... centrifugal force!

277
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:20,754
That was stupid.

278
00:15:20,858 --> 00:15:22,601
You left yourself wide open!

279
00:15:24,551 --> 00:15:25,898
Yeah, but it's no big deal.

280
00:15:26,338 --> 00:15:27,338
Watch this!

281
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:30,434
Ultimate move: Wire Impact!

282
00:15:36,765 --> 00:15:38,029
Is that all you got?

283
00:15:38,723 --> 00:15:42,015
If this is your trump card, it's
the saddest one I've ever seen.

284
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,412
Oh, you think so?

285
00:15:43,588 --> 00:15:46,973
Well if you haven't noticed, it just
let me accomplish exactly what I wanted.

286
00:15:47,695 --> 00:15:48,788
Take a look behind you.

287
00:15:48,891 --> 00:15:49,481
Hm?

288
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,248
Uh, wait...

289
00:15:51,338 --> 00:15:52,201
Aw crap.

290
00:15:52,371 --> 00:15:54,004
See ya later, suckers!

291
00:15:54,429 --> 00:15:55,308
Whoo!

292
00:15:55,653 --> 00:16:00,225
That whole time he was creating a diversion so we
wouldn't notice that the other one was getting away.

293
00:16:00,632 --> 00:16:01,575
I'm an idiot.

294
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:08,644
Well if nothing else, I can at
least chase you down now can't I?!

295
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:11,082
You sure it's a such good idea to come after me like that?

296
00:16:12,256 --> 00:16:17,588
My string is made from the fur of an S-Class Danger Beast
that hails from the high clouds over the Eastern Sea.

297
00:16:17,821 --> 00:16:21,088
The fibers protect its vital organs,
and they're ridiculously strong.

298
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:27,619
These incredible, resilient strands are razor-sharp,
and lovingly known as "World Severing String."

299
00:16:28,827 --> 00:16:30,208
I'm coming!

300
00:16:30,307 --> 00:16:31,627
They have never let me down.

301
00:16:31,814 --> 00:16:33,793
And there's no way you can cut through it.

302
00:16:38,378 --> 00:16:40,212
Ahh!

303
00:16:40,358 --> 00:16:41,416
You're finished!

304
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,520
It's gonna take more than that.

305
00:16:44,687 --> 00:16:46,787
My body has had decades of training.

306
00:16:47,055 --> 00:16:48,288
I won't die from this!

307
00:16:48,668 --> 00:16:51,612
In a few seconds it won't matter how strong your body is.

308
00:16:51,692 --> 00:16:56,280
Cross Tail's already finding its way around inside
you, and once it wraps around your heart it's over.

309
00:16:56,518 --> 00:16:57,193
Hmm?

310
00:17:02,352 --> 00:17:02,943
Ugh!

311
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,653
Never thought much about training your guts, did ya?

312
00:17:09,705 --> 00:17:11,712
Ooh, that was cool!

313
00:17:11,737 --> 00:17:12,188
Huh?

314
00:17:12,213 --> 00:17:13,750
You just killed Shuten.

315
00:17:13,884 --> 00:17:16,205
The Minister's gonna yell at me for like ever.

316
00:17:16,778 --> 00:17:19,048
Nah, you won't have to worry about that.

317
00:17:20,763 --> 00:17:21,872
Sorry about this.

318
00:17:22,158 --> 00:17:24,907
But you've seen my weapon, so
there's no way I can let you live.

319
00:17:25,191 --> 00:17:26,690
Aw, don't be sorry!

320
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:29,208
I'm an assassin too; I totally get it.

321
00:17:37,205 --> 00:17:38,309
Arrrh...

322
00:17:38,677 --> 00:17:39,222
Huh?!

323
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,654
What's all that liquid?

324
00:17:47,444 --> 00:17:49,300
Crap! It's weighing down my strings,

325
00:17:49,748 --> 00:17:50,922
the barrier's ruined!

326
00:17:51,605 --> 00:17:54,258
It's my body oil, more like sweat really.

327
00:17:54,511 --> 00:17:58,138
The Rakshasa Demons are experts at
doing weird stuff with our bodies.

328
00:17:58,198 --> 00:18:00,802
So yeah, that's what happened to your little web thingy.

329
00:18:04,091 --> 00:18:06,053
Whoa! She's fast!

330
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,306
Uh, uh, ah!

331
00:18:07,344 --> 00:18:08,016
Hehe...

332
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:15,568
Ugh, I can't move...

333
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:17,755
If I take one more hit...

334
00:18:18,071 --> 00:18:19,196
I'm a dead man.

335
00:18:21,504 --> 00:18:22,702
Uhh...

336
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:27,691
Oh don't do that, it's so desperate.

337
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,157
Damn, you sure are pretty.

338
00:18:33,303 --> 00:18:35,900
If things were different, I'd totally ask you out.

339
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:40,097
Hehe... And you're just the kinda guy I
like, so I probably would've been interested.

340
00:18:41,381 --> 00:18:42,312
But oh well!

341
00:18:42,551 --> 00:18:43,840
Maybe in another life.

342
00:18:45,012 --> 00:18:45,986
Good night.

343
00:18:49,178 --> 00:18:49,700
Uh...

344
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:52,678
Uuuh...

345
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:56,127
I kinda used my strings to grab those knives from earlier.

346
00:18:56,429 --> 00:19:01,608
And then I just bided my time for the right moment
to rewind it back in and well, you know the rest.

347
00:19:03,762 --> 00:19:04,920
Ugh!

348
00:19:07,758 --> 00:19:08,495
Sorry.

349
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:13,809
Guess I should get outta here.

350
00:19:15,105 --> 00:19:15,641
Hm...

351
00:19:17,259 --> 00:19:19,101
Aw, man, it's not fair!

352
00:19:19,307 --> 00:19:21,471
The one time a girl actually likes me!

353
00:19:24,532 --> 00:19:25,932
We covered a lot of ground today,

354
00:19:26,245 --> 00:19:29,495
but we still need to check all the
backstreets and byroads and everything else.

355
00:19:29,658 --> 00:19:31,793
This city's way too big!

356
00:19:31,818 --> 00:19:33,648
Yeah but isn't that why we're searching it?

357
00:19:35,231 --> 00:19:38,468
This would be a heck of a lot more
fun if we included some shopping.

358
00:19:39,055 --> 00:19:40,201
Maybe for you.

359
00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:42,769
It's a nightmare to be the one following you around.

360
00:19:42,944 --> 00:19:44,742
Err! You got a problem with it?

361
00:19:45,332 --> 00:19:49,143
If a man can't appreciate a lady's
retail needs, he has poor character.

362
00:19:49,168 --> 00:19:53,337
And I think women who come up with stupid reasons
for calling a man's character poor have poor character,

363
00:19:53,362 --> 00:19:53,910
how 'bout that?

364
00:19:53,935 --> 00:19:58,825
Now you're asking for it! Do I need to remind you
who's in charge here? You need to remember your place!

365
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:00,526
Jeez, when are you gonna get it through your head?

366
00:20:00,551 --> 00:20:02,584
You're not in charge of me; We're the same rank!

367
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,171
Please, cease this foundless quarreling.

368
00:20:06,403 --> 00:20:07,124
Who are you?

369
00:20:07,245 --> 00:20:08,345
Apologies.

370
00:20:08,445 --> 00:20:12,404
I know it's none of my business... but
I simply could not help but intervene.

371
00:20:12,489 --> 00:20:14,897
By any chance are you with...

372
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,390
the Path of Peace.

373
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:17,054
I am.

374
00:20:17,285 --> 00:20:21,591
In sooth I'm the Founding Lord; On
occasion I make a sojourn to the city.

375
00:20:22,245 --> 00:20:23,544
I have had a vision.

376
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:26,265
I see you two joined by the red string of fate.

377
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:29,486
Cast off your differences and confess your love!

378
00:20:29,511 --> 00:20:30,420
Huh? Huh?

379
00:20:30,658 --> 00:20:35,265
Upon forming your bond.. The occasional
healthy disagreement can be quite beneficial!

380
00:20:35,972 --> 00:20:36,842
Huh? Huh?

381
00:20:37,211 --> 00:20:38,815
Whaaat?!

382
00:20:38,885 --> 00:20:41,116
I would never marry a jerk like him?!

383
00:20:41,141 --> 00:20:42,949
Oh yeah, like you're a trophy wife!

384
00:20:43,044 --> 00:20:45,582
You truly are made for one another.

385
00:20:47,096 --> 00:20:48,756
Good news, dear.

386
00:20:48,869 --> 00:20:52,904
I'm bestowing upon you the coveted
honor of serving as the Lord's assistant.

387
00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:54,130
Oh! Really?

388
00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:59,877
I'm so happy I get to see the Lord performing
his miracles up close! This is a dream come true!

389
00:20:59,902 --> 00:21:03,989
However, you still haven't completely
cleansed your mind of evil thoughts.

390
00:21:04,043 --> 00:21:05,824
You're not yet fit for the task.

391
00:21:05,855 --> 00:21:07,182
O-oh no!

392
00:21:07,772 --> 00:21:12,991
Not to worry, child; Simply remove your
clothes and I will purify you with a sacred ritual.

393
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,011
Yes, Counselor Bolic.

394
00:21:15,639 --> 00:21:17,012
Please help me.

395
00:21:17,472 --> 00:21:20,424
Soon this religion will be under my thumb.

396
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,440
I'm going to enjoy this very much.

397
00:21:23,506 --> 00:21:24,526
Counselor Bolic!

398
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:26,050
What is it?

399
00:21:26,544 --> 00:21:28,205
I'm in the middle of a ceremony!

400
00:21:28,292 --> 00:21:29,902
It's the Four Demons.

401
00:21:29,927 --> 00:21:30,766
Uh...

402
00:21:32,248 --> 00:21:35,145
It seems three of them were eliminated in one night.

403
00:21:35,517 --> 00:21:37,593
They underestimated Night Raid.

404
00:21:37,913 --> 00:21:39,325
I knew it from the start;

405
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:44,180
We're the only ones capable of crushing those
nasty sinners beneath the mighty Hammer of Justice!

406
00:21:45,023 --> 00:21:48,663
Najenda, I fell for your tricks on the way here,

407
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,716
but I'll turn this place into a slaughter house.

408
00:21:51,963 --> 00:21:53,624
For you and your team.
