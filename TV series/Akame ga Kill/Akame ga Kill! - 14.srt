1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:02,207
Is this some sort of dream?

2
00:00:02,786 --> 00:00:06,068
Nope... unfortunately this is not a dream.

3
00:00:07,592 --> 00:00:10,354
Huh? Looks like someone's coming up from the valley.

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,371
He's pretty fast too!

5
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:13,737
Who is this guy?!

6
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:18,405
They practically wiped out all of Stylish's creations!

7
00:00:18,938 --> 00:00:20,358
I should probably hide for now.

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,486
Tatsumi's not back yet.

9
00:00:23,008 --> 00:00:24,761
I'm starting to get a really bad feeling.

10
00:00:24,902 --> 00:00:27,042
Hello, Imperial Capital?

11
00:00:27,084 --> 00:00:30,177
So good to be back! Hehe...

12
00:02:02,176 --> 00:02:06,408
Hehe... I'd know your scent
anywhere; Good to see you Tatsumi!

13
00:02:06,433 --> 00:02:09,647
So tell me why you ran away. I've missed you so much.

14
00:02:09,672 --> 00:02:11,394
Wha?! What're you doing here?!

15
00:02:11,782 --> 00:02:15,719
Silly boy. I'm here to capture the
Danger Beasts attacking the Capital.

16
00:02:16,179 --> 00:02:19,256
Uh... Which leads me to the question of why you're here.

17
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:19,769
Uh!

18
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:21,497
She's onto me!

19
00:02:22,382 --> 00:02:24,394
I'm dead if I can't come up with something good.

20
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:29,770
Oh yeah about that, um, before I tell you
do you think maybe you could let go of me?

21
00:02:29,795 --> 00:02:30,797
I will not.

22
00:02:31,142 --> 00:02:33,844
Um, please it makes me nervous
when we're close together like this.

23
00:02:33,869 --> 00:02:35,258
I'm not letting you go.

24
00:02:36,515 --> 00:02:38,048
Uh... I'm testing myself!

25
00:02:38,622 --> 00:02:40,991
I heard that there were some
Danger Beasts on the mountain!

26
00:02:41,163 --> 00:02:43,166
A man after my own heart.

27
00:02:43,422 --> 00:02:46,161
Well? Did you join the Revolutionary Army yet?

28
00:02:46,523 --> 00:02:47,165
Uh...

29
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:48,763
No, not yet.

30
00:02:49,276 --> 00:02:51,551
But I'm still planning to enlist as soon as I can.

31
00:02:52,335 --> 00:02:55,516
I guess you could say that's the reason
I'm out here trying to hone my skills.

32
00:02:56,369 --> 00:02:57,964
Yes. I see that.

33
00:02:58,429 --> 00:03:03,332
Judging by the amount of muscle you've built up
I'd wager your abilities have exponentially grown.

34
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,871
You've obviously been working hard!

35
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:08,061
And with so much room to improve!

36
00:03:08,262 --> 00:03:09,496
You really think so?

37
00:03:09,962 --> 00:03:12,158
I do not have time for any of this!

38
00:03:12,682 --> 00:03:15,184
The Danger Beasts are almost all gone.

39
00:03:15,436 --> 00:03:17,459
They have really been a nuisance...

40
00:03:18,108 --> 00:03:21,520
But honestly, thanks to them we're together again!

41
00:03:21,545 --> 00:03:23,024
Love is a strange thing!

42
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:23,721
Uh, eh...

43
00:03:25,196 --> 00:03:28,846
How can there be so many
interruptions on a deserted mountain?

44
00:03:29,062 --> 00:03:29,793
You there!

45
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,537
The coward trying to hide.

46
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:32,774
Show yourself.

47
00:03:33,262 --> 00:03:35,944
If you refuse, you'll get no mercy from me!

48
00:03:37,755 --> 00:03:40,698
Well shit, I thought you wouldn't notice me.

49
00:03:40,828 --> 00:03:42,198
Not too shabby.

50
00:03:42,276 --> 00:03:45,890
Now I understand why everyone
is so bloody terrified of you.

51
00:03:45,965 --> 00:03:49,085
Anyway, now that the two of us
have finally exchanged pleasantries...

52
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:52,876
it's probably a good time for me
to stop playing with my little toys.

53
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:56,605
Sounds like you know something about
why Danger Beasts are roaming this area.

54
00:03:56,845 --> 00:03:59,086
I'd be more than glad to torture it out of you.

55
00:03:59,111 --> 00:04:01,770
Sorry madam, but that's not my cup of tea.

56
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:06,500
But if you're in need of a little excitement
I'm willing to let you play with my toys as well!

57
00:04:06,798 --> 00:04:09,439
Behold my Imperial Arms!

58
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:10,723
Shambala!

59
00:04:13,718 --> 00:04:14,871
What's happening?!

60
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:22,045
Now then...

61
00:04:22,551 --> 00:04:26,207
I wonder what kind of game we should play next.

62
00:04:29,795 --> 00:04:30,628
Uhhh...

63
00:04:31,014 --> 00:04:32,841
Where are we?!

64
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:35,782
Uh.. Miss Esdeath...

65
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:37,870
could you hit me really hard?

66
00:04:38,217 --> 00:04:41,128
Tatsumi... I didn't know you were into that.

67
00:04:41,507 --> 00:04:44,737
We really are perfect for each other, isn't it wonderful?

68
00:04:44,777 --> 00:04:46,061
Oh god, that's not what I meant!

69
00:04:46,315 --> 00:04:49,938
I just want to find out if that guy trapped
us in some kind of illusion, that's all!

70
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,350
So if you were to hurt me, maybe
I'd snap out of it, you know?!

71
00:04:53,948 --> 00:04:54,748
Understood.

72
00:04:55,252 --> 00:04:56,312
As you wish.

73
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,367
Uh!

74
00:04:58,713 --> 00:05:00,300
Mmm...

75
00:05:03,574 --> 00:05:04,987
It's not an illusion.

76
00:05:05,161 --> 00:05:07,086
Our surroundings feel too real.

77
00:05:07,346 --> 00:05:09,461
The cool breeze blowing on the waves...

78
00:05:09,486 --> 00:05:10,786
The warm sunshine...

79
00:05:10,994 --> 00:05:12,828
Everything around us is true.

80
00:05:13,024 --> 00:05:14,198
Then what happened?

81
00:05:14,436 --> 00:05:17,285
I assume this was somehow caused by that man we saw.

82
00:05:17,825 --> 00:05:20,056
How did he manage to teleport us?

83
00:05:20,269 --> 00:05:21,773
That can't be possible, right?!

84
00:05:22,724 --> 00:05:27,204
The Empire has 48 legendary
weapons known as Imperial Arms.

85
00:05:27,524 --> 00:05:34,047
Rumor has it that the secret art of a lost nation was
used to create one that could manipulate space itself.

86
00:05:34,627 --> 00:05:36,195
Uh! That's crazy!

87
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,751
Wait, hang on.

88
00:05:38,364 --> 00:05:41,321
Isn't that basically what Incursio
does every time I summon its armor?

89
00:05:43,566 --> 00:05:44,453
Oh man...

90
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,046
when I think about it like that it kinda freaks me out!

91
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:53,868
Of all the Imperial Arms, I can only think
of a handful with the power to control space.

92
00:05:55,183 --> 00:05:56,823
Who was that man?

93
00:05:57,529 --> 00:05:58,800
Let's take a look around.

94
00:06:03,118 --> 00:06:03,758
Ah!

95
00:06:04,123 --> 00:06:06,349
Oh crap, there's nothing but ocean!

96
00:06:06,535 --> 00:06:08,650
But isn't this a gorgeous view?

97
00:06:09,544 --> 00:06:12,978
It's starting to feel kind of like
we're on a date, isn't it, my darling?

98
00:06:13,337 --> 00:06:15,088
I'd rather start with dinner first.

99
00:06:15,455 --> 00:06:18,298
You never know what can happen
when dealing with Imperial Arms.

100
00:06:18,323 --> 00:06:21,308
In my line of work you have
to be able to adapt immediately.

101
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,433
I'm sure you do.

102
00:06:22,763 --> 00:06:24,472
Now, where were we?

103
00:06:25,087 --> 00:06:27,433
Right, we're on a date! Wanna cuddle?

104
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:28,428
Hey, stop it!

105
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,870
Well he's a big fella.

106
00:06:33,285 --> 00:06:36,715
It looks just like Dr. Stylish
after he used that trump card!

107
00:06:37,162 --> 00:06:40,659
Even with everyone in Night Raid working
together, it was still a close fight!

108
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:43,482
Do the two of us even stand a chance?

109
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:46,870
He's after us!

110
00:06:46,895 --> 00:06:49,423
I won't let him ruin our time together.

111
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,960
You are interrupting!

112
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:54,094
You deserve to be impaled!

113
00:06:54,254 --> 00:06:55,676
Weiss Schnabel!

114
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,140
She's even stronger than I thought.

115
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,403
You're still standing.

116
00:07:07,573 --> 00:07:09,174
This is getting interesting.

117
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:12,007
Hey... you see that weird spot on his forehead?

118
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,775
Doesn't it look kinda weak?

119
00:07:14,402 --> 00:07:16,370
I was thinking the same thing.

120
00:07:16,661 --> 00:07:18,445
We must be soulmates!

121
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:20,000
Grau Horn!

122
00:07:21,085 --> 00:07:22,343
He's quite stubborn.

123
00:07:22,368 --> 00:07:24,712
Ahhhhh!

124
00:07:24,737 --> 00:07:25,612
Tatsumi?!

125
00:07:28,028 --> 00:07:29,193
Ah!

126
00:07:33,929 --> 00:07:35,164
Well done!

127
00:07:35,231 --> 00:07:39,150
Though I had originally planned on
winning your heart with my own skills...

128
00:07:39,505 --> 00:07:41,845
you wound up deepening my love for you.

129
00:07:42,185 --> 00:07:45,171
And here I used some of my favorite moves and everything!

130
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:46,823
There's another one!

131
00:07:48,171 --> 00:07:51,617
Leave it to me, Tatsumi, I'll give him what he deserves!

132
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:00,721
Hagel Sprung!

133
00:08:03,503 --> 00:08:03,996
Heh!

134
00:08:05,529 --> 00:08:08,373
Wow, I cannot believe the size of that attack.

135
00:08:08,872 --> 00:08:10,594
She's on a whole different level.

136
00:08:11,898 --> 00:08:14,029
So this is how General Esdeath fights.

137
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:18,107
Akame... how the heck are you going to kill her?!

138
00:08:22,281 --> 00:08:23,881
Those two must have been the last of them.

139
00:08:24,374 --> 00:08:27,554
So that was what he meant by "picking up his toys."

140
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:32,013
Which means this was where he was
hiding that new breed of Danger Beast.

141
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:33,804
So what do you want to do after our break?

142
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:38,759
First we'll explore the area so we can
develop a better understanding of our situation.

143
00:08:39,521 --> 00:08:40,372
Good idea.

144
00:08:40,407 --> 00:08:42,222
We still don't know what we're dealing with.

145
00:08:42,393 --> 00:08:44,802
We'll only make things worse if we panic.

146
00:08:44,887 --> 00:08:46,635
It's best to remain calm.

147
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,485
You're right! Let's get to work!

148
00:08:49,577 --> 00:08:51,244
Wait, did I really just say that?

149
00:08:51,613 --> 00:08:53,724
She's the enemy, remember?!

150
00:08:55,073 --> 00:08:57,998
Mmm... not quite right.

151
00:09:18,594 --> 00:09:21,496
We searched the island for so long the sun went down huh.

152
00:09:22,004 --> 00:09:24,576
Yes... and it's been a lovely time.

153
00:09:25,096 --> 00:09:26,463
Uh... oh, yeah.

154
00:09:27,145 --> 00:09:28,488
Not only that,

155
00:09:28,554 --> 00:09:31,023
but I also managed to figure out where we are.

156
00:09:31,048 --> 00:09:31,554
Oh!

157
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:35,302
This island is several miles
to the southeast of the Empire.

158
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,455
What? You've gotta be kidding me.

159
00:09:38,021 --> 00:09:40,303
Wow, I had no idea we were so far away.

160
00:09:40,403 --> 00:09:41,660
Which means...

161
00:09:42,327 --> 00:09:45,757
You and I are the only two people on this island, Tatsumi.

162
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:48,101
So, then... what would you like to do?

163
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:50,729
You're in charge. Go ahead, choose your fate.

164
00:09:56,227 --> 00:09:58,784
Well, don't all those options mean about the same thing?!

165
00:09:58,857 --> 00:10:00,784
Aw, you're no fun at all.

166
00:10:00,957 --> 00:10:03,514
How can you be so calm and easy-going about this?

167
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:04,863
Of course I'm calm;

168
00:10:04,888 --> 00:10:06,524
I'm the one who knows how to get back.

169
00:10:06,549 --> 00:10:07,430
Don't worry.

170
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:08,361
Huh?!

171
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:11,554
However, I'll need you to give me your full cooperation.

172
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:12,625
Is that clear?

173
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:13,562
Uh, yeah!

174
00:10:14,644 --> 00:10:17,147
I've got a really bad feeling about this.

175
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,404
But if things get chaotic I might
have a chance to make a break for it.

176
00:10:21,238 --> 00:10:22,293
All I can do is hope!

177
00:10:28,021 --> 00:10:32,067
Just as I thought, the secret
was in where he transported us.

178
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:36,410
So, does that mean he can only teleport
to places that have this mark?

179
00:10:36,721 --> 00:10:41,584
Based on the size of the light when it activated,
I'd say it only works on a few people at a time.

180
00:10:41,713 --> 00:10:45,874
And it must use a large amount of
energy, so he can't do it very often.

181
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:48,196
So you think.. If we stay by this spot...

182
00:10:48,477 --> 00:10:50,404
The gate should open again eventually.

183
00:10:50,921 --> 00:10:53,152
But this is only the first way I found.

184
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:57,366
Now. Before I tell you the second way
back, there's something I'd like to do.

185
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:58,359
Sure, what is it?

186
00:10:59,227 --> 00:11:01,050
Now that we're all by ourselves,

187
00:11:01,075 --> 00:11:02,949
let's learn more about each other.

188
00:11:06,348 --> 00:11:07,948
Whoa whoa whoa, time out!

189
00:11:07,993 --> 00:11:10,522
If that's all you want then
there's a lot of other ways to do it!

190
00:11:11,141 --> 00:11:12,282
Want me to stop?

191
00:11:12,721 --> 00:11:15,290
Okay. Then you have to answer my questions.

192
00:11:15,699 --> 00:11:18,299
First off: Where did you learn to fight with a sword?

193
00:11:18,691 --> 00:11:21,926
Uh, well, there was this veteran
who used to live in my village.

194
00:11:21,954 --> 00:11:24,287
Apparently he was a pretty good martial arts teacher.

195
00:11:24,387 --> 00:11:25,896
Anyway, I trained under him.

196
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:27,324
Interesting.

197
00:11:28,006 --> 00:11:30,388
Did he teach you about blacksmithing as well?

198
00:11:30,854 --> 00:11:34,028
I tried to master as many skills as
I could so I'd make a lot of money.

199
00:11:35,598 --> 00:11:39,374
To accomplish something like that takes
a lot of diligence. You're very talented!

200
00:11:39,796 --> 00:11:43,197
I, uh, get the feeling that you
could accomplish just about anything.

201
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:48,062
Not true. For example, I'll never
have an appreciation of say, the arts.

202
00:11:48,087 --> 00:11:52,134
The first time I heard Nyau play the flute,
I couldn't understand what was so special.

203
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,594
This could be my chance to
get some information out of her.

204
00:11:54,887 --> 00:11:57,781
I mean, she's crazy about me, how hard can it be?

205
00:11:57,952 --> 00:12:01,687
Maybe I can find something in our conversation
that'll help me convince her to join our side.

206
00:12:01,886 --> 00:12:02,987
To fight for us.

207
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,240
Let's face it...

208
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,770
I'd much rather have her as a friend than a foe!

209
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:09,226
So uh, Miss Esdeath..

210
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,360
You didn't grow up in the Capital, did you?

211
00:12:11,654 --> 00:12:12,524
That's right.

212
00:12:12,549 --> 00:12:14,488
I was born close to the Northern border.

213
00:12:14,862 --> 00:12:17,067
I don't suppose you've heard of the Partas clan?

214
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,216
I haven't.

215
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,288
They were a hunting clan that
specialized in killing Danger Beasts.

216
00:12:22,313 --> 00:12:24,307
And I was the daughter of their chief.

217
00:12:25,254 --> 00:12:29,324
Since you were kind enough to tell me
about your past.. I guess I'll share mine.

218
00:12:35,893 --> 00:12:38,012
Father! I caught my prey!

219
00:12:38,454 --> 00:12:39,612
Ah! Well done!

220
00:12:39,821 --> 00:12:41,700
You're a good little hunter for your age...

221
00:12:41,944 --> 00:12:44,104
but I think your old-man's got you beat!

222
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:45,329
Wow!

223
00:12:45,354 --> 00:12:47,462
We're about to begin the butchering process.

224
00:12:47,721 --> 00:12:48,406
Are ya ready?

225
00:12:48,624 --> 00:12:49,331
Mm-hm...

226
00:12:50,094 --> 00:12:51,394
I went ahead and weakened it.

227
00:12:51,493 --> 00:12:53,730
And it's tied down so it can't hurt us.

228
00:12:53,793 --> 00:12:55,938
But let's be quick just in case, okay?

229
00:12:57,053 --> 00:12:59,444
It hurts my ears when they scream like that.

230
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:04,479
Yeah, I can't do much for the pain, but the
eggs are more valuable if the beast is still alive.

231
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,512
Y'see, it used to survive by devouring our people.

232
00:13:08,172 --> 00:13:10,821
Not anymore, this time the predator loses.

233
00:13:11,062 --> 00:13:12,587
The hunter may have been strong,

234
00:13:12,687 --> 00:13:16,601
but in this case the hunted ended up being
just a little bit stronger in the end.

235
00:13:16,998 --> 00:13:19,175
It's what it deserves for being weaker than me.

236
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:22,828
Esdeath. Carve out the eyes and the crest.

237
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:23,574
Mm-hm...

238
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,378
I'll do my best, Father!

239
00:13:26,413 --> 00:13:28,722
She never hesitates to kill a target,

240
00:13:28,787 --> 00:13:31,192
even if it's weak or trying to run away.

241
00:13:31,286 --> 00:13:32,929
She's a natural hunter.

242
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,301
But that being said...

243
00:13:36,028 --> 00:13:38,659
I can't help but wonder if she's missing something.

244
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:41,534
I can only hope it won't be a problem.

245
00:13:42,552 --> 00:13:44,128
Eat or be eaten.

246
00:13:44,253 --> 00:13:47,612
That's the kind of wonderful
lifestyle in which I was raised.

247
00:13:47,687 --> 00:13:49,896
It was just us and the Danger Beasts.

248
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:54,034
The way both sides desperately
fought for their lives was so much fun.

249
00:13:54,621 --> 00:13:56,330
Oh, an insect war?

250
00:13:56,786 --> 00:13:57,426
Yeah.

251
00:13:57,765 --> 00:14:00,027
It seems to me like the fighting's already over.

252
00:14:00,243 --> 00:14:03,624
Look over there, the enemy soldiers
have dragged the queen out of the fortress

253
00:14:03,691 --> 00:14:05,157
and they're getting ready to lynch her.

254
00:14:05,715 --> 00:14:07,696
That's what happens to the weak, right?

255
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:08,736
Yes, Esdeath.

256
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:13,539
This situation is exactly the same as it was
when your mother was eaten by the Danger Beast.

257
00:14:13,729 --> 00:14:16,170
Make no mistake, this is how the world works.

258
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:20,799
It may be sad, but your mother died because she was weak.

259
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,109
The strong survive; The weak become prey.

260
00:14:28,006 --> 00:14:30,521
Camping in the mountains these past few days paid off!

261
00:14:30,566 --> 00:14:32,532
I caught this guy all by myself!

262
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:34,666
Father is gonna be so proud of me!

263
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:41,040
What happened...?

264
00:14:43,339 --> 00:14:44,714
What's going on?!

265
00:14:44,739 --> 00:14:49,362
The northern tribe just came from across
the border and started attacking our people.

266
00:14:49,553 --> 00:14:52,984
The chief took charge and
killed a few dozen of the bastards,

267
00:14:53,009 --> 00:14:56,369
but then they ganged up on him all
at once and he couldn't hold 'em off.

268
00:14:57,528 --> 00:14:58,548
Father!

269
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,703
Esdeath...

270
00:15:01,126 --> 00:15:02,671
it's like I've told you...

271
00:15:02,787 --> 00:15:05,706
We were defeated because we weren't strong enough.

272
00:15:06,054 --> 00:15:07,319
This was our fate.

273
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,080
Never let yourself be of the weak, Esdeath.

274
00:15:12,254 --> 00:15:14,766
Never become the prey.

275
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:18,257
I continued to hunt Danger Beasts on my own,

276
00:15:18,369 --> 00:15:22,077
but eventually I ran out of prey,
so I became an Imperial officer.

277
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:26,929
So somewhere along the line I switched
from preying on monsters to targeting humans.

278
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:29,197
And well, that's my story.

279
00:15:29,493 --> 00:15:30,176
I get it.

280
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,396
You wanted revenge on the northern tribe.

281
00:15:32,421 --> 00:15:34,451
I can understand why you hated them so much.

282
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:36,961
Hmm? I suppose that's what it must look like...

283
00:15:37,115 --> 00:15:38,996
but I don't necessarily hate them.

284
00:15:39,262 --> 00:15:39,818
What?

285
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,401
Well then what about all those rumors of
you burying hundreds of northerners alive?

286
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:47,254
I wanted to be efficient when I made an example of them.

287
00:15:47,603 --> 00:15:50,554
Besides, I would have done that
regardless of what my feelings were.

288
00:15:50,914 --> 00:15:52,634
I couldn't disobey orders, you know.

289
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,560
Huh?

290
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:59,615
What happened to my father was regrettable, but
it doesn't change the fact that he was a weak man.

291
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,913
Is there anything else you wanted to ask me?

292
00:16:02,938 --> 00:16:05,870
I'm more than willing to tell you
whatever you want to know, Tatsumi.

293
00:16:05,895 --> 00:16:08,084
Uhh... actually...

294
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:11,625
I was kinda wondering if maybe I could
see what your Imperial Arms looks like.

295
00:16:12,487 --> 00:16:13,288
Oh, that?

296
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,603
My Imperial Arms...

297
00:16:15,921 --> 00:16:16,570
Ahh...

298
00:16:16,687 --> 00:16:17,330
Look.

299
00:16:18,021 --> 00:16:18,962
It's right here.

300
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:19,862
What?!

301
00:16:21,344 --> 00:16:23,229
It happened several years ago.

302
00:16:23,297 --> 00:16:29,670
Hmm... I've offered a variety of weapons,
but your affinity seems poor with all of them.

303
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:35,286
Well, I am impressed with how enormous
this axe is... but nothing's caught my eye.

304
00:16:36,503 --> 00:16:37,054
Huh?

305
00:16:37,403 --> 00:16:39,955
Is that an Imperial Arms in that urn over there?

306
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,522
Yes, the Demon's Extract.

307
00:16:42,547 --> 00:16:46,158
The blood of an S-Class Danger-Beast from the far north.

308
00:16:46,183 --> 00:16:47,663
A blood-type weapon?

309
00:16:47,819 --> 00:16:51,746
The legends say if you drink the
extract and it resonates properly,

310
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:55,938
you'll be able to obtain the Danger
Beast's ability to manipulate ice.

311
00:16:56,045 --> 00:17:01,887
However, every warrior to attempt to
do so has lost his mind in the process.

312
00:17:02,338 --> 00:17:04,454
That all sounds rather fascinating, doesn't it?

313
00:17:04,554 --> 00:17:06,167
You're not going to drink that!

314
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:10,254
You may have a dangerous reputation,
but that doesn't mean it'll bond with you!

315
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:11,982
I feel so drawn to it...

316
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:14,229
as if it's beckoning me to drink.

317
00:17:14,381 --> 00:17:15,930
That's a good sign.

318
00:17:15,955 --> 00:17:18,121
Perhaps the Extract is right for you.

319
00:17:18,221 --> 00:17:19,147
Maybe.

320
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:22,715
For some reason I feel certain I was meant for this.

321
00:17:22,788 --> 00:17:25,254
I honed my intuition out in the wild;

322
00:17:25,354 --> 00:17:27,687
If I'm wrong, I deserve to die.

323
00:17:28,102 --> 00:17:30,752
It should only take a sip to know for sure.

324
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:32,704
No reason not to drink the whole thing.

325
00:17:32,729 --> 00:17:34,729
I bet that'll make me even stronger.

326
00:17:35,535 --> 00:17:39,359
I guess it can't drive you insane if you already are.

327
00:17:42,827 --> 00:17:43,588
Ahh...

328
00:17:46,025 --> 00:17:48,220
My, that tasted so...

329
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:48,867
Gah!

330
00:17:50,962 --> 00:17:51,561
Huh?!

331
00:17:52,027 --> 00:17:55,254
Kill! Steal! Murder!

332
00:17:55,354 --> 00:17:57,221
Destroy! Humiliate!

333
00:17:57,314 --> 00:17:59,876
Break! Slaughter!

334
00:17:59,908 --> 00:18:01,645
Hehe... haha...

335
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:04,335
The urge to destroy is overwhelming!

336
00:18:04,544 --> 00:18:07,301
Now I understand why everyone else went crazy...

337
00:18:07,681 --> 00:18:09,354
but I will not!

338
00:18:09,638 --> 00:18:10,787
This is nothing!

339
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,179
I won't be bested by a mere goblet of blood!

340
00:18:15,557 --> 00:18:17,576
I will always be on top.

341
00:18:17,736 --> 00:18:19,654
I will always be victorious...

342
00:18:19,987 --> 00:18:21,784
no matter what gets in my way!

343
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:25,061
And I will answer to no one but myself!

344
00:18:28,135 --> 00:18:30,503
I'm feeling truly delightful now, Minister.

345
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,978
The power's surging through my entire body.

346
00:18:33,285 --> 00:18:35,311
You seem to have already merged.

347
00:18:36,226 --> 00:18:39,121
To the birth of the world's most powerful warrior...

348
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:40,885
Esdeath!

349
00:18:41,947 --> 00:18:45,161
So after all this time that
monster's blood is still in your body?

350
00:18:45,535 --> 00:18:46,428
That's correct.

351
00:18:47,023 --> 00:18:49,594
But I mastered it long ago, you don't need to worry.

352
00:18:49,966 --> 00:18:52,051
So that's what made you like to torture people?

353
00:18:52,313 --> 00:18:54,428
Oh, no.. I've always enjoyed that.

354
00:18:55,061 --> 00:18:56,716
She didn't do it for revenge,

355
00:18:56,823 --> 00:18:59,719
and it's not because that Demon's
Extract thing makes her go berserk.

356
00:19:00,113 --> 00:19:01,993
Either of those would've been better than this.

357
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,747
She's been true to herself from the very beginning...

358
00:19:06,369 --> 00:19:08,880
nothing could change someone with a personality like that!

359
00:19:09,923 --> 00:19:12,418
I can't believe I was gonna try to win her over again!

360
00:19:12,796 --> 00:19:14,114
I'm such an idiot!

361
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:15,547
Hmm.

362
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,972
I wonder how those two are doing.

363
00:19:18,138 --> 00:19:20,482
I'm sure they haven't gotten themselves killed yet.

364
00:19:20,836 --> 00:19:24,059
Perhaps it's about time I re-opened the portal, yes?

365
00:19:24,084 --> 00:19:26,696
Shambala Point B, release.

366
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:29,746
That oughta do it.

367
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,957
Hmm... What are you doing over there?

368
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:35,052
Huh? Excuse me, bitch?

369
00:19:35,506 --> 00:19:41,302
You know, despite your language,
you seem oddly... refined.

370
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:42,759
Ha, well, no shit.

371
00:19:42,784 --> 00:19:45,327
I mean, Minister Honest is my father, so...

372
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:47,588
Huh, that man is your father?

373
00:19:47,613 --> 00:19:48,618
Grrr...

374
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:50,641
Guh...

375
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:54,297
What the hell does a whore have to say about it, huh?!

376
00:19:54,322 --> 00:19:58,928
I happen to have great respect for
him... but I can do far better than he has.

377
00:19:59,148 --> 00:20:04,069
I consider surpassing your parents to be
a good show of filial piety, don't you?!

378
00:20:04,889 --> 00:20:05,589
So uh...

379
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,714
about that second way back you found...

380
00:20:08,214 --> 00:20:10,489
Oh yes, I'm sure I can tell you now.

381
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,230
We just need to secure a ride.

382
00:20:12,371 --> 00:20:16,096
There are quite a few species of Danger
Beasts that will let you ride on their backs.

383
00:20:16,689 --> 00:20:20,626
Although.. Sometimes it's a little
difficult to train them not to throw you off.

384
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:21,847
You'd better let me do it.

385
00:20:22,063 --> 00:20:23,852
Wait, isn't that one up there?

386
00:20:24,364 --> 00:20:26,328
Huh? I guess it is.

387
00:20:26,353 --> 00:20:28,341
That's too bad. Be right back.

388
00:20:28,366 --> 00:20:30,450
Wait, what? How are you planning on catching it?

389
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,227
It's way too far up in the sky!

390
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:34,122
I'll train it after I shoot it down!

391
00:20:34,147 --> 00:20:35,017
Just watch!

392
00:20:39,397 --> 00:20:40,431
Whoa, it opened!

393
00:20:41,091 --> 00:20:43,082
This is my perfect chance to get outta here!

394
00:20:43,914 --> 00:20:44,402
Hmm...

395
00:20:45,267 --> 00:20:47,949
But, she did look after me this whole time.

396
00:20:48,669 --> 00:20:50,130
I should return the favor.

397
00:20:50,522 --> 00:20:51,722
Look, Miss Esdeath!

398
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,621
The portal's opening up again!

399
00:20:53,807 --> 00:20:55,270
I'm going through, okay?!

400
00:20:55,302 --> 00:20:57,817
Ah! Tatsumi, wait!

401
00:20:58,251 --> 00:20:59,479
Don't go in there!

402
00:21:03,353 --> 00:21:07,097
This is the same mountain we were on yesterday.

403
00:21:07,816 --> 00:21:09,556
Tatsumi, are you here?

404
00:21:09,956 --> 00:21:12,971
Did he really get that far
ahead of me in those few seconds?

405
00:21:13,151 --> 00:21:15,685
Impossible, he didn't have that much time.

406
00:21:16,494 --> 00:21:17,787
Even though I'm invisible,

407
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,710
she'll feel my aura if I move.

408
00:21:20,383 --> 00:21:23,203
All I can do now, is wait 'til she leaves.

409
00:21:23,228 --> 00:21:24,403
He's not here.

410
00:21:25,389 --> 00:21:28,180
Could it be... he was sent to another location?

411
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:30,023
I lost him again.

412
00:21:30,845 --> 00:21:32,189
But one thing is certain...

413
00:21:32,578 --> 00:21:34,933
now that we've found each other a second time,

414
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,950
I'm sure it won't be the last.

415
00:21:37,177 --> 00:21:39,943
Fate will bring you back to me... I can feel it.

416
00:21:41,407 --> 00:21:42,613
I can feel it too.

417
00:21:44,142 --> 00:21:48,131
But now, I know for sure I'll
never persuade you to join us.

418
00:21:49,551 --> 00:21:51,415
So the next time the two of us meet...

419
00:21:52,263 --> 00:21:55,112
it will be as enemies.
