1
00:00:12,659 --> 00:00:16,139
So this is the Capital's red-light
district. I'm a little nervous.

2
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,613
Aww. Tatsumi, you're so cute when you act all bashful!

3
00:00:21,092 --> 00:00:25,034
Anyway. That money ain't gonna
make itself, so I say we get cooking!

4
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:27,697
Lionel, transform!

5
00:00:35,832 --> 00:00:40,274
Ha! When I get into beast mode I feel
like I can just take on the whole world!

6
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,017
C'mon, let's get in there and make a mess of things.

7
00:00:45,499 --> 00:00:45,921
Wha?

8
00:00:49,473 --> 00:00:51,652
Wait, hold on! Ahhh!

9
00:00:51,746 --> 00:00:54,479
Not so fast!

10
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,047
Whew. It looks like we made it!

11
00:02:47,825 --> 00:02:49,839
But I thought we were gonna "sneak in"...

12
00:02:55,581 --> 00:02:56,763
Look at this.

13
00:02:56,799 --> 00:02:57,461
Huh?

14
00:03:05,892 --> 00:03:06,546
Uh...

15
00:03:08,545 --> 00:03:11,221
Ooh, they sure are goin' to town!

16
00:03:11,779 --> 00:03:16,347
If you want me to bring you more, better
keep bein' good little girls, you understand?

17
00:03:16,372 --> 00:03:17,961
Okay!

18
00:03:18,306 --> 00:03:19,683
Huh?

19
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,222
Hey Boss, what about that one over there?

20
00:03:23,106 --> 00:03:24,866
Eh, I'm done with her.

21
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,563
Her mind's gone and she stinks of fish.

22
00:03:27,736 --> 00:03:30,852
Just get rid of her. These
bitches are pretty easy to replace.

23
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:31,814
Please... I need more!

24
00:03:31,839 --> 00:03:32,843
Hm? Here.

25
00:03:33,181 --> 00:03:33,796
Ow!

26
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:38,635
I guess we need to go and pick
up a few more from the slums.

27
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,706
Yeah, these bitches are a dime a dozen.

28
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,751
Show 'em a little money, and they'll do whatever you want.

29
00:03:43,939 --> 00:03:46,271
This is even more sick than the client said it was.

30
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:47,928
Those bastards!

31
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,616
That girl he was just hitting...

32
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:53,397
she was a friend of mine from back home.

33
00:03:53,917 --> 00:03:55,114
Now I'm pissed!

34
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:57,658
Let's just slaughter these pukes and be done with it!

35
00:03:57,823 --> 00:03:58,685
Roger that!

36
00:03:59,278 --> 00:04:04,052
It looks like we're in prime position to
move and expand the drug route a little bit, huh?

37
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,677
Yeah, probably so.

38
00:04:05,857 --> 00:04:09,020
I'll have a talk with Mr. Chiburu
and see how he feels about it.

39
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,166
Huh?

40
00:04:11,676 --> 00:04:13,936
We're here to send every single one of you...

41
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,496
straight to Hell!

42
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:17,735
Get those punks!

43
00:04:17,776 --> 00:04:19,128
Bring back their heads!

44
00:04:25,773 --> 00:04:28,490
Every person in this trafficking ring is our target,

45
00:04:28,596 --> 00:04:30,640
which means all of you are about to die.

46
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,690
Get ready for some pain, fellas!

47
00:04:32,715 --> 00:04:34,473
Uh... Kill her!

48
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,786
I'm-I'm not gonna die...

49
00:04:50,392 --> 00:04:52,056
I'm not gonna let you kill me!

50
00:04:54,095 --> 00:04:56,523
Then you'll have to move faster than that, dick?

51
00:05:03,854 --> 00:05:08,006
Please, take whatever you want.
You want money? You want drugs?

52
00:05:08,068 --> 00:05:12,554
I'll give you anything. I'll give
you everything. Just let me go, please!

53
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:13,953
Anything I want, huh?

54
00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:17,417
Thanks, but the only thing I want from you is your life.

55
00:05:17,933 --> 00:05:20,028
Who the hell are you people anyway?!

56
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:22,185
Hehe...

57
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:24,489
Oh, we're just "bitches"!

58
00:05:30,711 --> 00:05:34,819
I mean, honestly... who better than
a couple of "bitches" to take you out?

59
00:05:35,272 --> 00:05:37,790
Uh, could you come up with
something else to call us, please?

60
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:45,414
So, what's gonna happen to all those girls?

61
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,111
They're really messed up now.

62
00:05:47,937 --> 00:05:50,248
Unfortunately, that's not really our call.

63
00:05:51,065 --> 00:05:52,165
I know, but still.

64
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:56,021
There's a retired doctor who still lives around here.

65
00:05:56,621 --> 00:05:58,058
I'll let him know what happened.

66
00:05:58,794 --> 00:06:01,105
He'd probably be more than happy to lend a hand.

67
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:04,277
The doc always was fond of
pretty girls, so everybody wins.

68
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:05,547
Know what I'm sayin?

69
00:06:05,987 --> 00:06:06,940
That's great.

70
00:06:08,237 --> 00:06:10,890
Heh. See, I knew you had a little soft side.

71
00:06:11,084 --> 00:06:14,102
I used to be friends with one
of those women, that's all it is.

72
00:06:14,257 --> 00:06:15,969
That's the only reason I wanted to help.

73
00:06:16,482 --> 00:06:17,906
Well, I don't care why.

74
00:06:18,152 --> 00:06:18,587
Uh?

75
00:06:19,174 --> 00:06:22,354
All that matters is that those girls
get another chance to start over.

76
00:06:24,746 --> 00:06:25,581
Tatsumi.

77
00:06:25,832 --> 00:06:26,247
Hm?

78
00:06:26,272 --> 00:06:27,803
I've been meaning to tell you something...

79
00:06:28,109 --> 00:06:30,969
When you let yourself smile... you're really sweet.

80
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:32,566
Ah!

81
00:06:32,843 --> 00:06:34,263
Wh-wh-what??!

82
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:38,447
You can't run away now, I've already marked my territory!

83
00:06:38,507 --> 00:06:41,479
Once you finally grow up, you're gonna be all mine, baby.

84
00:06:42,014 --> 00:06:46,429
Well anyway, I wonder how the
other group's doing right about now?

85
00:06:49,504 --> 00:06:53,381
That Chiburu guy was so obnoxiously careful
I thought we'd never track him down!

86
00:06:53,406 --> 00:06:56,759
Yeah that's true, but at least
we completed the mission on time!

87
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:03,259
Uh?

88
00:07:07,017 --> 00:07:07,767
Tehe...

89
00:07:10,795 --> 00:07:11,799
Who is that?

90
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:13,512
Is it an enemy?

91
00:07:14,118 --> 00:07:15,556
I couldn't sense her at all!

92
00:07:16,556 --> 00:07:20,454
The other guards can't conceal their auras,
so she must be on a completely different level!

93
00:07:23,174 --> 00:07:24,080
I know you...

94
00:07:24,353 --> 00:07:26,333
you're the one from the wanted posters.

95
00:07:26,593 --> 00:07:28,516
Sheele of Night Raid, I presume?

96
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:33,190
And judging by your friend's weapon
I'd guess that she's from Night Raid too.

97
00:07:34,226 --> 00:07:38,132
I'm so glad I spent the night on watch
or I never would have found the two of you.

98
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,091
Finally...

99
00:07:40,944 --> 00:07:44,342
Oh, how badly I've been wanting to meet you, Night Raid!

100
00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:47,846
I'm Imperial Guard member Seryu Ubiquitous!

101
00:07:47,878 --> 00:07:52,634
And in the name of absolute justice...
I'll banish your evil right here and now!

102
00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:10,020
Well now that you've blown my cover, you can either
die where you're standing or you can come with us.

103
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,266
They say you're wanted dead or alive.

104
00:08:12,499 --> 00:08:14,711
So that means I can execute you!

105
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:18,946
Bandits like you are the reason my
Father was killed in the line of duty!

106
00:08:19,486 --> 00:08:22,838
And you were the ones who
murdered my mentor, Captain Ogre!

107
00:08:23,326 --> 00:08:25,533
I'll never forgive you, Night Raid!

108
00:08:25,913 --> 00:08:27,916
So you're that eager to fight us, huh?

109
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,961
Fine. I'll make it quick!

110
00:08:36,994 --> 00:08:38,107
Did I get her yet?

111
00:08:49,547 --> 00:08:51,634
Y'see that... is that what I think it is?

112
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,007
I'm afraid so.

113
00:08:53,307 --> 00:08:56,001
This girl has an organic type of Imperial Arms.

114
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:58,016
Tonfa guns!

115
00:09:01,662 --> 00:09:04,368
Looks like shooting won't be effective from this distance.

116
00:09:04,947 --> 00:09:06,465
Koro! Suppertime!

117
00:09:14,374 --> 00:09:15,411
I'm sorry.

118
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,574
Heh...

119
00:09:43,903 --> 00:09:46,211
Don't you even remember what the book said, Sheele?!

120
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:50,299
Organic type Imperial Arms always
have a hidden core you have to destroy;

121
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:52,211
Otherwise they just keep regenerating!

122
00:09:52,251 --> 00:09:55,784
And it doesn't have a heart so
Akame's sword won't do any good either.

123
00:09:56,017 --> 00:09:58,410
This is a surprisingly nasty opponent!

124
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:00,753
Koro. Bulk up.

125
00:10:07,887 --> 00:10:10,251
Bleh. That's not cute.

126
00:10:10,364 --> 00:10:11,239
Crush her!

127
00:10:13,633 --> 00:10:15,377
Mine! Just stay behind me.

128
00:10:19,507 --> 00:10:21,583
Ugh! Ah!

129
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:25,714
Huh?

130
00:10:28,112 --> 00:10:29,876
This thing is too strong to defeat...

131
00:10:30,176 --> 00:10:32,055
and she just called in reinforcements.

132
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:35,341
That means we're in big trouble... perfect!

133
00:10:36,824 --> 00:10:38,460
You still hungry, little guy.

134
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:39,935
Eat this!

135
00:10:44,194 --> 00:10:46,598
Uh! Did her weapon just improve?

136
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:54,253
Damn! It's already starting to regenerate again.

137
00:10:54,586 --> 00:10:55,739
This is not good.

138
00:10:58,801 --> 00:11:01,667
You should never underestimate an Imperial Arms!

139
00:11:02,946 --> 00:11:03,459
Huh?

140
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,852
One thing about weapons,

141
00:11:05,066 --> 00:11:07,289
they can't keep moving if the wielder is dead.

142
00:11:08,576 --> 00:11:10,229
They were after me all along!

143
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,390
Better use my trump card!

144
00:11:12,614 --> 00:11:13,796
Extase!

145
00:11:16,046 --> 00:11:18,275
How is that thing giving off so much light?!

146
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,791
You've run out of time.

147
00:11:26,957 --> 00:11:28,110
Ugh!

148
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:31,122
She's even strong without her weapon!

149
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:36,785
Hey you.

150
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:38,957
You're supposed to be fighting me.

151
00:11:38,982 --> 00:11:40,764
Stop getting sidetracked.

152
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:44,033
Pumpkin's not as powerful now
that the threat's cooled off.

153
00:11:44,777 --> 00:11:46,377
But I can still keep him busy!

154
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:50,461
Now that I've hit him a few times,
I'm starting to narrow down where the core is.

155
00:11:51,334 --> 00:11:52,027
Ugh!

156
00:11:53,707 --> 00:11:54,169
Ah!

157
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:58,829
Ah!

158
00:11:59,641 --> 00:12:00,189
Uh!

159
00:12:02,895 --> 00:12:06,809
Ahh!

160
00:12:06,834 --> 00:12:09,587
She sacrificed her arms to block that fatal strike!

161
00:12:11,603 --> 00:12:14,609
True justice... always wins!

162
00:12:14,756 --> 00:12:16,242
That's part of her body?!

163
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:18,668
It was a special gift from Captain Ogre!

164
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,076
Just for you!

165
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,460
She blocked it!

166
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,083
Ahh!

167
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:43,337
Ugh...

168
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,283
I'm not done yet!

169
00:12:46,293 --> 00:12:50,302
If I do this, Koro will overheat and
he won't be able to move for a while.

170
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,170
Heh. Screw it.

171
00:12:52,307 --> 00:12:54,756
Koro, use your trump card!

172
00:12:54,787 --> 00:12:56,213
Go berserk!

173
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,010
It's got a trump card?!

174
00:13:21,547 --> 00:13:22,483
Sheele!

175
00:13:22,728 --> 00:13:23,656
Hold on!

176
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:28,142
Good boy... now squeeze!

177
00:13:32,581 --> 00:13:34,905
Ah!

178
00:13:41,474 --> 00:13:42,100
Uh...

179
00:13:44,795 --> 00:13:45,856
You did it!

180
00:13:47,254 --> 00:13:48,442
That was a close one!

181
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,077
What's happening?

182
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,233
I can't move...

183
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:11,885
Justice prevails!

184
00:14:23,477 --> 00:14:23,985
No...

185
00:14:26,553 --> 00:14:29,422
Sheele!

186
00:14:35,287 --> 00:14:36,629
Goddamn you...

187
00:14:36,782 --> 00:14:39,030
You just killed Sheele, you bitch.

188
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,871
Ah! Dammit, my arm.

189
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:47,473
Aaah!

190
00:15:04,387 --> 00:15:05,098
What?!

191
00:15:05,207 --> 00:15:07,171
What the hell, I can't see!

192
00:15:07,218 --> 00:15:09,764
Aagh! Careful, men! We don't know what it is!

193
00:15:30,486 --> 00:15:32,526
Extase...

194
00:15:33,121 --> 00:15:35,680
Sheele, no!

195
00:15:37,781 --> 00:15:38,737
That demon!

196
00:15:38,962 --> 00:15:40,883
How can she possibly keep on fighting?!

197
00:15:40,908 --> 00:15:43,654
Get out of here, Mine... while you still have a chance!

198
00:15:43,887 --> 00:15:44,507
Hurry!

199
00:15:45,187 --> 00:15:47,510
No, I... I can't!

200
00:16:05,654 --> 00:16:06,533
Oh, Mine...

201
00:16:07,719 --> 00:16:12,316
I'm glad... I could be useful in the end.

202
00:16:14,034 --> 00:16:15,169
Koro!

203
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,150
Finish her!

204
00:16:23,693 --> 00:16:24,590
Night Raid...

205
00:16:26,996 --> 00:16:28,689
You were always home to me.

206
00:16:54,874 --> 00:16:56,838
I loved every one of you...

207
00:16:57,214 --> 00:16:58,936
from the bottom of my heart.

208
00:17:08,354 --> 00:17:10,882
I had so much fun.

209
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,759
Tatsumi... I'm sorry.

210
00:17:30,665 --> 00:17:34,352
I won't be able to hold you ever again.

211
00:18:08,508 --> 00:18:11,097
What? What happened to the light? Where'd it go?

212
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,930
You gonna be okay? We really need to get back.

213
00:18:18,595 --> 00:18:19,540
I did it!

214
00:18:19,888 --> 00:18:23,895
It would've been even better if she'd
abandoned her friend like the traitor she is.

215
00:18:24,153 --> 00:18:26,234
I guess she was just too stupid!

216
00:18:28,368 --> 00:18:32,273
Daddy? Are you proud, now that I
took down one of the bad people?

217
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,617
Do you see how brightly the light of justice was shining?!

218
00:19:12,392 --> 00:19:13,551
Who did this?

219
00:19:14,377 --> 00:19:15,771
Tell me who did it, now!

220
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:16,938
Mine!

221
00:19:17,538 --> 00:19:20,075
Mine! Tell me, dammit!

222
00:19:20,378 --> 00:19:21,678
Calm down, Tatsumi.

223
00:19:21,978 --> 00:19:23,611
Why do you need to know that now?

224
00:19:24,084 --> 00:19:25,835
So we can get our revenge!

225
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,997
Don't you get it?!

226
00:19:27,283 --> 00:19:28,176
Not yet.

227
00:19:28,485 --> 00:19:31,158
Act too quickly and you'll only add to the body count.

228
00:19:31,318 --> 00:19:33,700
Then how do you expect me to act?! Huh?!

229
00:19:33,993 --> 00:19:35,979
I'm not just gonna sit on my ass and-.

230
00:19:36,004 --> 00:19:36,392
Ugh...

231
00:19:37,983 --> 00:19:39,631
That's enough, Tatsumi!

232
00:19:40,024 --> 00:19:41,782
Now pull yourself together!

233
00:19:41,991 --> 00:19:44,991
We warned you that any one of us can die at any time.

234
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,182
You accepted that risk the moment you decided to join us.

235
00:19:57,465 --> 00:19:58,741
It was your mission.

236
00:19:59,477 --> 00:20:01,774
You wanted payback for what we did to you...

237
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,884
I know that.

238
00:20:03,971 --> 00:20:06,283
But you took Sheele away from us.

239
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:10,366
And I'm sure you'll be coming for the rest of us too.

240
00:20:10,983 --> 00:20:12,466
But when that time comes...

241
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:17,758
I swear on my life, Seryu
Ubiquitous... I will have your head!

242
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:21,076
Our associate's death was by no means in vain.

243
00:20:21,935 --> 00:20:24,181
The Empire's seen what weapons we have.

244
00:20:24,917 --> 00:20:28,190
They'll be attacking with more and more Imperial Arms.

245
00:20:28,277 --> 00:20:32,671
This means that our chances to obtain
Imperial Arms will vastly increase.

246
00:20:33,411 --> 00:20:34,551
Remember, Tatsumi.

247
00:20:34,831 --> 00:20:36,846
These battles are always to the death.

248
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:52,764
I'm finally back. I'm home.
