1
00:00:00,853 --> 00:00:03,220
Another castle surrendered without a fight!

2
00:00:03,626 --> 00:00:06,819
Cowards. Don't these people have any loyalty anymore?

3
00:00:06,844 --> 00:00:10,281
The viceroys of these castles
were relocated to the countryside

4
00:00:10,306 --> 00:00:14,727
because their behavior showed signs
of insubordination against His Majesty.

5
00:00:15,027 --> 00:00:17,220
It comes as no surprise.

6
00:00:17,374 --> 00:00:20,488
But Minister, if this continues, the
rebel army will reach the Imperial...

7
00:00:20,513 --> 00:00:22,316
There's no need to panic.

8
00:00:22,871 --> 00:00:24,286
Great General Budo!

9
00:00:24,311 --> 00:00:27,531
A general should refrain from
getting involved in politics.

10
00:00:27,762 --> 00:00:30,267
I've lived by those words for quite some time now.

11
00:00:30,292 --> 00:00:34,927
However I'm finding it a challenge to keep my mouth
shut when it comes to something like this, Minister.

12
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:38,198
Hohoho... I'm not sure what to say!

13
00:00:38,223 --> 00:00:39,862
I will protect this Empire.

14
00:00:39,887 --> 00:00:44,647
It is a responsibility handed down through
my family line for the past thousand years.

15
00:00:44,672 --> 00:00:50,353
As such, I will personally annihilate anyone who
dares to disrupt the peace of this great nation...

16
00:00:50,453 --> 00:00:52,544
regardless of who may interfere.

17
00:00:52,601 --> 00:00:56,084
Admirable! But there's no reason for concern.

18
00:00:56,109 --> 00:01:01,407
Even if the citizens rise in rebellion,
we have plans in place to overpower them.

19
00:01:02,279 --> 00:01:03,809
Gentlemen...

20
00:01:04,055 --> 00:01:09,470
Allow me to introduce an elite force
I've assembled to protect the Capital.

21
00:01:09,789 --> 00:01:12,045
Hello Hellooo.

22
00:01:15,553 --> 00:01:17,607
This is my son, Syura.

23
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,470
I've decided to appoint him to
serve as the company's commander.

24
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:26,065
Hm? You must be the "Great"
General I've heard so much about.

25
00:01:26,118 --> 00:01:29,964
You're like tied with Esdeath for scariest in the Empire.

26
00:01:30,104 --> 00:01:34,413
Anyway, you shouldn't waste time worrying
about some commoners and their revolution bullshit.

27
00:01:34,613 --> 00:01:36,313
Why not let me handle it?

28
00:01:36,528 --> 00:01:38,720
Oh? Going out?

29
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,587
If there's one thing I've learned from battle,

30
00:01:40,687 --> 00:01:45,695
it's that you can always find a few rats around
before the entire swarm makes an appearance.

31
00:01:45,953 --> 00:01:47,020
Seriously.

32
00:01:47,294 --> 00:01:50,011
Can't he just sit in the castle and look pretty.

33
00:01:50,553 --> 00:01:51,648
Listen, Son.

34
00:01:51,787 --> 00:01:54,241
This is your chance to prove yourself.

35
00:01:54,268 --> 00:01:58,613
Whether or not I choose you to be my
successor will depend on your performance.

36
00:01:58,638 --> 00:02:01,178
Very well. Hope you enjoy the show.

37
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:06,887
But first, I have a few rats
of my own to hunt down. Hehe...

38
00:03:46,543 --> 00:03:48,243
It's so empty in here lately.

39
00:03:50,056 --> 00:03:52,713
Kurome, do you feel better now? Honestly?

40
00:03:53,536 --> 00:03:55,045
I'm... okay.

41
00:03:56,589 --> 00:03:57,425
Hmm...

42
00:03:58,043 --> 00:03:59,395
I did the best I could,

43
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,945
but I doubt it'll taste as good as what Bols used to make.

44
00:04:04,063 --> 00:04:06,726
Wave, have you heard about the new security force?

45
00:04:06,826 --> 00:04:09,265
Apparently they report directly to the Minister.

46
00:04:09,597 --> 00:04:10,103
Yeah?

47
00:04:10,128 --> 00:04:12,502
Well, I suppose we probably should've seen it coming.

48
00:04:12,857 --> 00:04:16,806
The Commander's on an expedition, and
half our team members have been assassinated.

49
00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:21,205
But isn't that even more of a reason to
move the rest of the Jaegers to the frontline?

50
00:04:21,842 --> 00:04:23,682
Why would they put us on standby?

51
00:04:24,151 --> 00:04:28,031
It tells me that there must be some
disagreement in the Capital's central command.

52
00:04:28,444 --> 00:04:29,731
What the hell are they thinking?!

53
00:04:30,084 --> 00:04:32,192
It's times like these we have to pull together.

54
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,707
It's the only way to bring down the Revolutionary Army.

55
00:04:35,929 --> 00:04:36,342
More please!

56
00:04:36,366 --> 00:04:37,473
Are you serious?

57
00:04:38,093 --> 00:04:40,978
Jeez. How can you even eat at a time like this?

58
00:04:42,183 --> 00:04:43,158
Help yourself.

59
00:04:46,563 --> 00:04:47,052
Uh...

60
00:04:48,335 --> 00:04:49,156
She fainted!

61
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:49,942
Oh God!

62
00:04:50,377 --> 00:04:50,990
Kurome!

63
00:04:51,014 --> 00:04:51,849
What's wrong?!

64
00:04:51,943 --> 00:04:52,828
Can you hear me?

65
00:04:52,952 --> 00:04:53,576
Kurome!

66
00:04:53,601 --> 00:04:54,115
Wake up!

67
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:54,791
Open your eyes!

68
00:04:54,816 --> 00:04:55,471
Kurome!

69
00:04:57,818 --> 00:04:59,277
They're sending out more soldiers.

70
00:04:59,377 --> 00:05:02,030
Yeah. This place is starting to look like a battlefield.

71
00:05:02,243 --> 00:05:06,220
So the plan is to wait out here for the
perfect moment and sneak into the palace.

72
00:05:06,453 --> 00:05:07,917
And then we can kill the Minister.

73
00:05:08,129 --> 00:05:10,374
Are you sure you're ready to do this, Tatsumi?

74
00:05:10,596 --> 00:05:11,929
It's what we have to do.

75
00:05:12,318 --> 00:05:16,401
Remember, it's important that we minimize
the number of innocent people involved.

76
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:20,079
The best way to do that is get rid
of the Minister as quickly as possible.

77
00:05:20,643 --> 00:05:21,237
Well put.

78
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:25,403
Oh, it's almost time for our meeting with the resistance.

79
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:26,727
Let's go.

80
00:05:29,697 --> 00:05:32,530
It's hard to believe how complex these waterways are.

81
00:05:32,756 --> 00:05:35,636
I think they got bigger as the
Imperial Capital got bigger...

82
00:05:35,977 --> 00:05:36,862
pretty wild.

83
00:05:37,152 --> 00:05:40,672
But their maintenance is crap, and
it's impossible to find a good map.

84
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:44,446
Well on the bright side, I bet there's
a way we can use it to our advantage.

85
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,115
So... Mine.

86
00:05:47,352 --> 00:05:50,140
Hmm? Uh-oh, why the sudden change in tone?

87
00:05:50,165 --> 00:05:51,253
Hehehe!

88
00:05:51,278 --> 00:05:53,748
So like what is the story on you and Tatsumi?

89
00:05:53,773 --> 00:05:54,998
Ah! Whaaat?!

90
00:05:55,023 --> 00:05:57,229
Oh come on, you don't think I wasn't gonna notice.

91
00:05:57,254 --> 00:06:01,218
I mean seriously, you two've been all
cute and awkward since we left Kyoroku.

92
00:06:01,243 --> 00:06:03,072
Hey now you wait just a minute!

93
00:06:03,097 --> 00:06:07,308
There's nothing going on between me and that idiot,
are you looking for a punch in the face or something?!

94
00:06:07,342 --> 00:06:10,006
Aww, it's okay, you don't have
to get all flustered about it!

95
00:06:10,031 --> 00:06:12,744
What?! Whatever, I'm not getting all flustered!

96
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:16,553
Well, if that's how you're gonna be about
it... Then I guess he's up for grabs then!

97
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,490
Uh?

98
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:18,876
Oh hell no!

99
00:06:22,179 --> 00:06:23,899
You are really pathetic.

100
00:06:24,331 --> 00:06:27,457
That's adorable, but I'm still taking Tatsumi for myself!

101
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:30,233
Hmph!

102
00:06:30,462 --> 00:06:33,236
Quit screwing around and get back to work! Let's go!

103
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,891
Not flustered at all.

104
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:37,597
Got it.

105
00:06:37,783 --> 00:06:39,510
Continue the mission as planned.

106
00:06:39,843 --> 00:06:41,953
Right! You can count on us.

107
00:06:42,933 --> 00:06:45,743
Apparently we're no longer in
contact with the western tribe.

108
00:06:45,843 --> 00:06:47,321
Hm? Really?

109
00:06:47,403 --> 00:06:49,869
It's fine. I was expecting this.

110
00:06:50,171 --> 00:06:52,159
Let's not deviate from the plan.

111
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:54,214
When we storm the palace...

112
00:06:54,518 --> 00:06:56,554
I would like the two of you to take the lead.

113
00:06:56,677 --> 00:06:57,977
Don't fail me!

114
00:06:58,077 --> 00:06:59,086
Understood.

115
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,541
Tatsumi, Lubbock.

116
00:07:01,783 --> 00:07:03,236
Please get through this.

117
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,242
Hey, Tatsumi.

118
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:05,860
Hm?

119
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,306
What are you gonna do when the revolution's over?

120
00:07:09,126 --> 00:07:11,320
Uh... hmm... I dunno...

121
00:07:11,571 --> 00:07:13,017
I guess I never really thought about it.

122
00:07:13,395 --> 00:07:15,565
What about you? You got plans?

123
00:07:15,947 --> 00:07:18,200
Well, I've been running that bookstore on the side.

124
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,960
I'll probably just stick with that.

125
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:22,239
Maybe I could make it a national chain or something.

126
00:07:22,747 --> 00:07:23,410
Wow.

127
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:24,528
And then!

128
00:07:24,806 --> 00:07:27,389
When the timing's right I'll ask Najenda to marry me!

129
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,283
Oh, is that so? That sounds nice.

130
00:07:30,308 --> 00:07:33,286
While we're on the subject,
what's going on with you and Mine?

131
00:07:33,311 --> 00:07:35,520
Huh?! What does she have to do with this?!

132
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,962
Aw, don't be shy!

133
00:07:36,987 --> 00:07:38,814
Everybody can tell there's been a little spark

134
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:41,794
between the two of you love birds
ever since we got back from Kyoroku.

135
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:42,854
So spill it!

136
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,386
Tell me how far have you gotten with her.

137
00:07:44,411 --> 00:07:46,819
Ooh, you've at least landed a smooch, right?

138
00:07:46,844 --> 00:07:47,619
Cut it out!

139
00:07:47,793 --> 00:07:49,223
Uh, pardon me...

140
00:07:49,248 --> 00:07:49,696
Huh?

141
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,031
You're uh...

142
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,495
members of Night Raid, right?

143
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:55,762
Uh...

144
00:07:56,115 --> 00:07:56,656
Ah!

145
00:07:56,706 --> 00:07:58,678
Lemme guess you must be with the resistance.

146
00:07:58,746 --> 00:07:59,511
I am.

147
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,130
Once we go inside, we'll have to be very quiet.

148
00:08:10,486 --> 00:08:11,071
Okay.

149
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:17,201
I gotta say I'm surprised a high-class
lady like you would be part of the resistance.

150
00:08:17,374 --> 00:08:19,840
My father was one of the Emperor's instructors,

151
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,626
but the Minister accused him of having
ulterior motives against the Empire.

152
00:08:24,173 --> 00:08:26,481
He threw my father and my mother in prison.

153
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,860
Well now I get it.

154
00:08:27,885 --> 00:08:29,204
So that means...

155
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:32,048
even more people in the palace
must support the revolution.

156
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:33,191
Yes.

157
00:08:33,671 --> 00:08:39,301
They've united under a group of anti-Minister bureaucrats,
who stay in close contact with the Revolutionary Army.

158
00:08:40,057 --> 00:08:44,323
And it's up to us to help those guys get the
revolutionaries gathered together from the inside,

159
00:08:44,554 --> 00:08:46,853
once the siege on the palace actually goes down.

160
00:08:47,798 --> 00:08:49,300
Alright. Perfect.

161
00:08:49,784 --> 00:08:51,041
Good to know we're not alone.

162
00:08:51,138 --> 00:08:55,340
We were chosen over everyone else for this
job because of my stealth and your invisibility.

163
00:08:56,065 --> 00:08:57,295
We can't screw up!

164
00:08:59,466 --> 00:09:00,103
Hm. Hm.

165
00:09:04,385 --> 00:09:05,206
This is it.

166
00:09:13,392 --> 00:09:14,203
Huh?

167
00:09:14,445 --> 00:09:15,078
You alright?

168
00:09:15,525 --> 00:09:16,683
Something's wrong.

169
00:09:17,092 --> 00:09:21,195
Whenever I knock twice, someone's supposed
to respond back with a password knock.

170
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:21,881
Uh!

171
00:09:22,792 --> 00:09:23,574
Stand back.

172
00:09:27,988 --> 00:09:28,595
Hm?

173
00:09:29,045 --> 00:09:29,590
Huh?

174
00:09:32,937 --> 00:09:34,390
Whoa.. What happened here?!

175
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,742
This isn't good guys; They already found the hideout.

176
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,287
Huh?!

177
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:38,674
Get out, NOW!

178
00:09:45,192 --> 00:09:45,766
Uuh...

179
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:47,640
Huh?

180
00:09:50,026 --> 00:09:50,477
Hm!

181
00:09:51,479 --> 00:09:52,503
Hehe...

182
00:09:53,085 --> 00:09:57,002
Took you long enough; I've been waiting forever.

183
00:09:57,059 --> 00:10:01,630
Hate to be the one to break it to you, but I had
to eliminate all those idiots with the "resistance".

184
00:10:02,012 --> 00:10:05,028
You may call me the Great Syura!

185
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,839
You two are with the Night Raid, yes?

186
00:10:09,085 --> 00:10:11,562
You had better be worth all the trouble.

187
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:13,039
Huh?

188
00:10:13,901 --> 00:10:20,950
Oh! You must be the little shit with General Esdeath
when I sent her to that deserted island or whatever?

189
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,649
So I guess you must've been
responsible for the Danger Beasts!

190
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,447
Why'd you do it?

191
00:10:26,706 --> 00:10:28,172
Why do anything?

192
00:10:28,392 --> 00:10:30,907
'Cause it's amusing, young man!

193
00:10:31,302 --> 00:10:34,872
There's nothing in this world that
bothers me more than being bored.

194
00:10:34,937 --> 00:10:38,690
And those creatures kept me pretty well entertained.

195
00:10:38,715 --> 00:10:41,224
That's enough... eat this!

196
00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:42,075
Tatsumi!

197
00:10:49,804 --> 00:10:51,318
Wh... what the?!

198
00:10:51,343 --> 00:10:55,098
Just as I thought, a few rats have found their way in.

199
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:00,265
Uh...

200
00:11:00,805 --> 00:11:04,298
Oh! I'm always up for a visit from my Uncle Budo.

201
00:11:04,444 --> 00:11:06,465
I'll let you take care of the pipsqueak.

202
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,690
Exactly what I had in mind.

203
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,873
I am known as Budo.

204
00:11:12,126 --> 00:11:16,168
His Majesty the Emperor granted
me the title of Great General.

205
00:11:16,201 --> 00:11:18,177
I've heard rumors about this monster.

206
00:11:18,508 --> 00:11:22,892
You are villainous trash threatening
the Empire... you are finished.

207
00:11:23,325 --> 00:11:24,827
Now face your judgment.

208
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:28,250
And feel the Wrath of the Lightning God Adramelech!

209
00:11:34,726 --> 00:11:35,426
Tatsumi!

210
00:11:36,952 --> 00:11:40,192
Uh... How did he manage to do that?

211
00:11:40,705 --> 00:11:41,966
He never even touched me!

212
00:11:41,991 --> 00:11:43,093
Impressive.

213
00:11:43,118 --> 00:11:45,079
Not many men can dodge my attack.

214
00:11:45,634 --> 00:11:47,698
I see determination in your eyes.

215
00:11:47,785 --> 00:11:48,211
Errr..

216
00:11:48,771 --> 00:11:51,770
Incursio!

217
00:11:57,254 --> 00:11:58,508
Be careful with that guy!

218
00:11:58,848 --> 00:11:59,695
Hehehe...

219
00:12:00,567 --> 00:12:01,110
Huh?

220
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,276
What?! How'd you do that?!

221
00:12:07,301 --> 00:12:09,945
I think you're gonna be a fun one to mess with.

222
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:12,024
Leave him to me, guys!

223
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,740
This precious little victim is all mine.

224
00:12:15,252 --> 00:12:15,928
Err...

225
00:12:17,058 --> 00:12:18,830
I quite enjoyed that.

226
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:24,246
As one might expect, the atmosphere of the
battlefield suits me far better than bodyguard duty.

227
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:34,608
It's time to return to the Capital.

228
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:39,020
It won't be long, Night Raid.

229
00:12:45,412 --> 00:12:45,860
What?!

230
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,765
Don't forget to look behind you, Night Raid!

231
00:12:51,728 --> 00:12:52,754
Well now!

232
00:12:53,447 --> 00:12:54,660
What do we have here?

233
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:55,979
A seamstress?

234
00:12:56,952 --> 00:12:59,447
Ooh, don't get such a pouty face;

235
00:12:59,493 --> 00:13:01,859
I'm about to share with you a secret.

236
00:13:01,884 --> 00:13:04,329
I call this little toy "Shambhala."

237
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:08,661
It gives me the ability to teleport
either myself or my adversaries...

238
00:13:08,762 --> 00:13:09,224
Huh?!

239
00:13:09,584 --> 00:13:12,300
To anywhere I've left my pretty little mark!

240
00:13:13,327 --> 00:13:14,884
He can manipulate space!

241
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:19,967
But the damn thing does wear me out. I couldn't
use it in quick succession until just recently.

242
00:13:23,212 --> 00:13:26,437
Then I found this juicy-stuff when I got to the Capital.

243
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:31,109
It really lets me "cut loose", if you will!

244
00:13:32,068 --> 00:13:36,562
As you can see... I got a little carried
away and put markers all over the place!

245
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:41,661
What's wrong?

246
00:13:41,686 --> 00:13:42,814
Not gonna run?

247
00:13:47,721 --> 00:13:48,992
Aww, man!

248
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:51,423
You giving up already? Hehe...

249
00:13:51,448 --> 00:13:53,249
Getting away from him won't do any good!

250
00:13:53,402 --> 00:13:55,930
No matter where I run, he can warp right up to me!

251
00:13:57,687 --> 00:13:58,118
But...

252
00:13:58,701 --> 00:14:00,797
He can't follow me somewhere he hasn't marked!

253
00:14:01,517 --> 00:14:02,077
Ha!

254
00:14:07,921 --> 00:14:09,310
Aaah... Urg!

255
00:14:09,335 --> 00:14:11,274
Did that get you all pissy?

256
00:14:11,424 --> 00:14:14,257
So I guess you can put up markers in midair can't ya.

257
00:14:14,282 --> 00:14:16,445
Bingo, smarty pants.

258
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,654
Think I'd leave you a safe place to hide?

259
00:14:19,035 --> 00:14:20,756
You've nowhere to run!

260
00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:31,461
He hits hard but his movements are exaggerated.

261
00:14:31,692 --> 00:14:32,617
I can take him!

262
00:14:34,425 --> 00:14:35,223
Ah!

263
00:14:44,264 --> 00:14:46,463
Young man, I'm curious what is your name?

264
00:14:46,488 --> 00:14:46,955
Huh...

265
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:48,954
Tell me who you are.

266
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:51,931
Or perhaps assassins like you don't have names?

267
00:14:51,956 --> 00:14:52,895
It's Tatsumi!

268
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:54,679
Tatsumi.

269
00:14:54,991 --> 00:14:58,134
Seems to be a sincere boy; And honest enough.

270
00:14:59,093 --> 00:15:01,699
And not a hint of hesitation in his posture.

271
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:06,731
I can only imagine the amount of training
it took for him to achieve this level of skill.

272
00:15:07,451 --> 00:15:08,839
Even so...

273
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:10,527
Uh!

274
00:15:12,922 --> 00:15:18,086
I am charged with the termination of any
who mean to bring harm to his Imperial Majesty!

275
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:29,880
Tatsumi!

276
00:15:30,235 --> 00:15:31,346
Uh... Huh?

277
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:32,405
Hey, what're you doing?

278
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:34,553
I'm sorry! I have to do this...

279
00:15:34,585 --> 00:15:35,661
I have to, for my mother...

280
00:15:35,686 --> 00:15:37,287
Stop it, let me go!

281
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:38,280
I'm sorry...

282
00:15:44,307 --> 00:15:46,508
Didn't I tell you to stay out of this?

283
00:15:46,948 --> 00:15:50,596
Huh... Stupid toys should not
be interfering with my plans.

284
00:15:51,073 --> 00:15:53,377
She's a... a toy?

285
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:58,064
Uh-huh. Everything from these morons
to the Capital itself, are my toys!

286
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:02,464
Pretty soon I'll leave my old man in the
dust, and they'll be crowning me emperor!

287
00:16:03,965 --> 00:16:06,502
Hey now, don't tell me you're quitting.

288
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:08,948
We're only just getting started, sonny!

289
00:16:08,973 --> 00:16:10,701
No... it's over.

290
00:16:11,154 --> 00:16:12,725
And it looks like you lose.

291
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:13,532
Huh?

292
00:16:15,594 --> 00:16:16,173
Uh?

293
00:16:19,714 --> 00:16:21,300
Owwwww!

294
00:16:22,227 --> 00:16:23,027
Don't move!

295
00:16:23,624 --> 00:16:25,812
Or I'll have to take off something bigger next time.

296
00:16:25,896 --> 00:16:27,185
Damn you!

297
00:16:27,858 --> 00:16:29,336
Huh? What's this?!

298
00:16:29,815 --> 00:16:31,870
A barrier of World-Severing String.

299
00:16:32,346 --> 00:16:36,128
I'd already used a lot, but I had
just enough left to pull this together.

300
00:16:36,153 --> 00:16:39,332
Son of a bitch! You set this up while you were running!

301
00:16:39,357 --> 00:16:40,686
You gave me plenty of time.

302
00:16:40,865 --> 00:16:44,922
And all of your bragging and showing off gave me a
pretty good indication of where all the markers were.

303
00:16:44,947 --> 00:16:46,652
You little shit!

304
00:16:46,677 --> 00:16:49,085
Listen up! All of you, drop your weapons now!

305
00:16:49,385 --> 00:16:52,936
Syura, I've got a few questions that I need to ask you.

306
00:16:53,014 --> 00:16:53,477
Guh!

307
00:16:56,441 --> 00:16:58,003
Uh... You...

308
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,461
Please, Lord Syura...

309
00:17:02,932 --> 00:17:04,487
I did as I was ordered...

310
00:17:04,801 --> 00:17:08,517
now please, release my family...

311
00:17:08,542 --> 00:17:10,714
Hehehe...

312
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:13,603
No can do, sweetie!

313
00:17:13,663 --> 00:17:20,247
Haha... Sorry to tell you, but
Mommy and Daddy died a long time ago!

314
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:22,087
Hahaha...

315
00:17:22,112 --> 00:17:25,372
Okay, Night Raid, I've really had a marvelous time. But...

316
00:17:25,397 --> 00:17:27,503
It's time we wrapped this up.

317
00:17:27,784 --> 00:17:32,021
I'd like to express my gratitude
by letting you see my trump card.

318
00:17:32,487 --> 00:17:33,841
Bon voyage!

319
00:17:33,866 --> 00:17:35,749
You're off to the ends of the Earth!

320
00:17:46,705 --> 00:17:49,942
No one's ever made it back from out there!

321
00:17:49,967 --> 00:17:54,039
You're gonna die alone in the
emptiness of space, Night Raid!

322
00:17:54,064 --> 00:17:56,243
Hahahaha...

323
00:17:56,268 --> 00:17:56,776
Huh?

324
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,629
No!

325
00:17:59,149 --> 00:18:01,195
That son of a bitch!

326
00:18:01,782 --> 00:18:05,963
Nothing in this world or the next could
possibly break the World-Severing String!

327
00:18:06,223 --> 00:18:08,980
Not even an Imperial Arms that controls space!

328
00:18:12,671 --> 00:18:14,699
So, here we go again.

329
00:18:14,724 --> 00:18:17,251
God dammit... Ah!

330
00:18:18,242 --> 00:18:20,139
You cannot get away!

331
00:18:22,862 --> 00:18:24,984
It's only right that we finish this fairly.

332
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,528
If I'm going to die, then you're going down with me.

333
00:18:27,553 --> 00:18:29,340
The hell I am!

334
00:18:29,514 --> 00:18:32,077
I won't allow myself to die with rabble like you!

335
00:18:32,102 --> 00:18:36,611
I haven't had time to take this boring bland
vanilla nation and give it the fun it deserves!

336
00:18:36,643 --> 00:18:38,160
Kind of a crazy sentiment...

337
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,982
but believe it or not, I do think I understand.

338
00:18:41,774 --> 00:18:44,573
No, I'm not supposed to die yet!

339
00:18:44,598 --> 00:18:46,369
I have so much to do!

340
00:18:46,515 --> 00:18:48,914
So you wanna change the world? Huh?

341
00:18:49,367 --> 00:18:50,693
Course you do.

342
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,149
Everybody wants to do that, asshole.

343
00:18:54,597 --> 00:18:55,390
But still...

344
00:18:56,084 --> 00:19:01,068
none of that gives you the right to treat your fellow
human beings like they're your own personal playthings

345
00:19:01,155 --> 00:19:02,818
and to treat them like they're nothing!

346
00:19:21,068 --> 00:19:21,502
Uh...

347
00:19:23,504 --> 00:19:24,077
Uh...

348
00:19:26,181 --> 00:19:30,447
Thanks for protecting me so long, Cross Tail.

349
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,561
I'm sorry, Najenda.

350
00:19:46,475 --> 00:19:48,712
This was as far as I could go.

351
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:53,024
I'm leaving the rest to you, Tatsumi.

352
00:20:02,255 --> 00:20:02,988
Uh...

353
00:20:12,081 --> 00:20:12,865
Oh, Lubb...

354
00:20:13,707 --> 00:20:17,090
Aaaugh!

355
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,083
He's dead!

356
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:32,273
How could you leave me?!

357
00:20:35,077 --> 00:20:35,969
Oh well!

358
00:20:36,383 --> 00:20:40,135
Can't change anything by grieving over the fallen, can we?

359
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,726
Well he did manage to eliminate a Night Raid assassin.

360
00:20:43,751 --> 00:20:46,220
Rather fair trade if you ask me.

361
00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:50,339
I took the liberty of confining the
other Night Raid member to the dungeon.

362
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,136
Excellent work.

363
00:20:52,396 --> 00:20:54,017
Let's see... now...

364
00:20:56,481 --> 00:20:59,216
If we wish to subdue the rebels,

365
00:20:59,289 --> 00:21:02,999
I imagine we need to make an example of that boy.

366
00:21:03,283 --> 00:21:04,770
It must be bold.

367
00:21:04,808 --> 00:21:09,135
So I wonder what's the best
form of torture to make a point.

368
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:14,532
Hmm... You're still as depraved
as ever, aren't you, Minister?

369
00:21:14,904 --> 00:21:18,879
Listen. Punishing a rebel calls
for a higher grade of cruelty.

370
00:21:19,156 --> 00:21:20,723
I have a few suggestions...

371
00:21:21,292 --> 00:21:21,725
Hm?

372
00:21:22,136 --> 00:21:24,674
I couldn't help but overhear your conversation.

373
00:21:25,063 --> 00:21:27,863
And if I may, I'd like that job to be mine.

374
00:21:27,894 --> 00:21:29,115
Ohh?

375
00:21:29,315 --> 00:21:33,101
Tatsumi, I won't let anyone take you from me!

376
00:21:47,603 --> 00:21:50,398
An execution? Oh no...

377
00:21:50,536 --> 00:21:53,446
Uh! Oh God... no...
