1
00:00:01,653 --> 00:00:03,186
Wait! No don't!

2
00:00:14,966 --> 00:00:17,795
What the hell?! Where'd that come from?

3
00:00:33,432 --> 00:00:34,533
Kurome's gone.

4
00:00:36,963 --> 00:00:38,798
That was quite a blast wasn't it.

5
00:00:38,849 --> 00:00:40,838
I guess Rubicante must have exploded.

6
00:00:42,586 --> 00:00:45,530
Without Bols backing me up, I
would've had a much harder time

7
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,732
trying to hold my own back there.

8
00:00:49,307 --> 00:00:52,328
Big Sister... did you make it out alive?

9
00:00:55,411 --> 00:00:56,838
The meds are wearing off!

10
00:01:02,681 --> 00:01:03,656
That was bad.

11
00:01:04,028 --> 00:01:04,947
Are you okay?

12
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:06,590
Yeah, I'll be all right.

13
00:01:07,032 --> 00:01:10,404
I just wanted to make sure that you
would still be in commission for later.

14
00:01:10,956 --> 00:01:11,984
But, Leone...

15
00:01:12,491 --> 00:01:13,790
Oh, you know how I am.

16
00:01:14,213 --> 00:01:18,182
I like to show off my amazing ability to... heal...

17
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:21,930
Come on now...

18
00:01:22,367 --> 00:01:24,052
You're... You're okay, right?

19
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:26,498
Leone!

20
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,749
I think I'm clear now.

21
00:03:07,135 --> 00:03:09,935
But I didn't do right by my guard, did I?

22
00:03:12,645 --> 00:03:14,291
I sure hope Kurome's safe.

23
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:18,961
I'm curious, Bols.

24
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:23,540
Why do you prepare such a feast only to
excuse yourself when it's time for dinner?

25
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,047
I...

26
00:03:26,461 --> 00:03:30,613
If I joined you, I'm sure it would just ruin the meal.

27
00:03:31,506 --> 00:03:36,203
Oh? So you don't want to show your face?
That makes me even more curious, you know.

28
00:03:36,228 --> 00:03:37,236
No, please stop!

29
00:03:41,728 --> 00:03:45,040
Is that it? You had me thinking it was a lot worse.

30
00:03:45,106 --> 00:03:47,584
I must admit I'm a little disappointed.

31
00:03:47,822 --> 00:03:48,491
Huh?

32
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:51,463
Nobody's going to bat an eyelash over something like that.

33
00:03:54,075 --> 00:03:55,915
Now, let's all have a meal together.

34
00:03:56,865 --> 00:03:58,316
What took you so long, Bols?

35
00:03:58,341 --> 00:04:01,415
Jeez, Koro, calm down! I'll feed you in a minute!

36
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,187
The wine is quite stylish!

37
00:04:03,212 --> 00:04:06,365
Bad dog, bad! Koro, please!

38
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,315
I wish...

39
00:04:11,874 --> 00:04:14,447
we could all eat together one more time.

40
00:04:18,603 --> 00:04:20,540
Oh no, what is this?!

41
00:04:20,565 --> 00:04:24,040
What are you doing here, sweetie?
This isn't a safe place to play!

42
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,628
Ahhhhh! Monster!!

43
00:04:26,653 --> 00:04:30,603
Oh no, I'm not a monster! It's okay, please don't cry!

44
00:04:31,048 --> 00:04:32,762
Oh goodness, you're hurt!

45
00:04:33,155 --> 00:04:35,214
Just sit still for me okay?

46
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:37,814
Now, now, be a big girl!

47
00:04:37,838 --> 00:04:40,066
Please don't eat me!

48
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:42,458
Now, that's not very nice.

49
00:04:43,467 --> 00:04:44,427
There you go!

50
00:04:44,871 --> 00:04:46,801
It'll be all better before you know it.

51
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:49,383
Just leave it alone and let it heal, okay?

52
00:04:50,867 --> 00:04:53,242
Thank you! I feel much better!

53
00:04:53,267 --> 00:04:55,195
Such a big brave girl.

54
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:00,889
Y'know what?

55
00:05:01,442 --> 00:05:03,555
All those places you burned down...

56
00:05:06,745 --> 00:05:08,265
They're gone forever.

57
00:05:11,037 --> 00:05:12,143
The girl you saw...

58
00:05:12,668 --> 00:05:15,045
she lived in one of the villages you destroyed

59
00:05:15,595 --> 00:05:18,157
under suspicion of aiding the Revolution.

60
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,468
Of course, you've slaughtered so many,

61
00:05:21,747 --> 00:05:24,231
I doubt you even remember faces anymore.

62
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,319
This is it.

63
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:38,951
The retribution for what I've done.

64
00:05:39,897 --> 00:05:43,050
The retribution I've always deserved.

65
00:05:44,557 --> 00:05:45,123
But I...

66
00:05:46,614 --> 00:05:47,505
I can't...

67
00:05:48,295 --> 00:05:50,406
I must go home!

68
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,891
My girls... are waiting... for me!

69
00:05:55,161 --> 00:05:56,756
My girls...

70
00:06:01,897 --> 00:06:03,590
My girls...

71
00:06:14,393 --> 00:06:18,126
Honestly, that's the most disturbing
thing about this line of work:

72
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:20,536
When you feel your target's pain.

73
00:06:21,434 --> 00:06:23,438
You got a clean kill before he could run away.

74
00:06:23,935 --> 00:06:25,037
I'm impressed, Chelsea!

75
00:06:25,391 --> 00:06:26,063
Hey, Lubb.

76
00:06:26,088 --> 00:06:28,178
Let's go ahead and meet up with everybody else all right.

77
00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:34,772
Nah, you go on without me. I'm going to track down Kurome
and finish her off before she can get back to Esdeath.

78
00:06:35,558 --> 00:06:39,451
Kurome's already gone outside my barrier, but
I think I know which direction she was headed.

79
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,129
You could probably catch her.

80
00:06:42,263 --> 00:06:43,918
But it's way too dangerous!

81
00:06:43,943 --> 00:06:46,236
It's not like you to bite off more than you can chew!

82
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:47,620
I don't have a choice.

83
00:06:47,693 --> 00:06:52,036
If we let Kurome get away this time, she'll
just come right back with eight more puppets for us.

84
00:06:52,089 --> 00:06:53,582
I cannot let that happen.

85
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,948
Do me a favor and let the rest of
the team know what I'm up to, okay?

86
00:06:57,034 --> 00:07:00,779
And if you could, see if you can convince
a couple of the others to come back me up.

87
00:07:03,183 --> 00:07:04,210
All right, fine.

88
00:07:04,603 --> 00:07:06,407
But don't do anything stupid, Chelsea.

89
00:07:06,574 --> 00:07:07,603
Of course not.

90
00:07:07,787 --> 00:07:12,247
Don't worry. If Kurome and Esdeath have already
found each other, I'll come right back. I promise.

91
00:07:13,301 --> 00:07:14,884
I'll send someone as soon as I can.

92
00:07:15,715 --> 00:07:17,395
That would be great!

93
00:07:19,803 --> 00:07:21,458
But it's way too dangerous!

94
00:07:21,485 --> 00:07:23,751
It's not like you to bite off more than you can chew!

95
00:07:24,113 --> 00:07:27,039
He's right. I really have been out of sorts lately.

96
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,681
It's crazy.

97
00:07:32,777 --> 00:07:34,608
C'mon, Chelsea, focus.

98
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,891
It's time to take care of business!

99
00:07:40,821 --> 00:07:42,407
Kurome, you're next.

100
00:07:43,593 --> 00:07:46,120
I swear I'm gonna take you out.

101
00:07:49,288 --> 00:07:51,258
The medication's all worn off.

102
00:08:00,826 --> 00:08:04,536
We agreed to purchase a hundred
young children from across the country

103
00:08:04,582 --> 00:08:07,896
and train them to be members
of a new assassination squadron,

104
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:11,080
but this is obviously much more than that.

105
00:08:11,315 --> 00:08:12,857
What's the big deal?

106
00:08:13,408 --> 00:08:15,545
You need to start with a few extras.

107
00:08:16,444 --> 00:08:20,143
We'll lose dozens of 'em once we
begin the weeding-out process anyway.

108
00:08:20,168 --> 00:08:21,390
Hmm, yes.

109
00:08:21,415 --> 00:08:24,259
Naturally, the weakest ones will drop out on their own.

110
00:08:24,284 --> 00:08:25,286
Exactly.

111
00:08:26,604 --> 00:08:30,280
I will take the seven most elite survivors under my wing.

112
00:08:38,369 --> 00:08:44,041
It's always interesting to see what type of child
is the first to make it out of the forest alive.

113
00:08:46,376 --> 00:08:49,129
Akame, I can't run any farther.

114
00:08:49,261 --> 00:08:51,888
Almost there, Kurome. Try to keep moving!

115
00:08:53,347 --> 00:08:55,558
No, they're gonna eat us!

116
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:58,368
Then we'll go this way! Hold on to me!

117
00:08:58,581 --> 00:09:01,087
Don't be scared! I won't let anything hurt you.

118
00:09:08,955 --> 00:09:09,857
Kurome!

119
00:09:18,401 --> 00:09:20,241
Don't touch my sister!

120
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:24,623
I must protect Kurome!

121
00:09:24,905 --> 00:09:27,008
I have to help my big sister!

122
00:09:42,252 --> 00:09:43,972
You both passed the test.

123
00:09:46,475 --> 00:09:47,511
Did you hear that?

124
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:49,629
It looks like we made it, Kurome.

125
00:09:50,164 --> 00:09:53,225
Thank you. Thank you for helping me, Akame.

126
00:09:54,449 --> 00:09:57,197
Are you including those sisters in the seven?

127
00:09:57,331 --> 00:10:00,887
Oh no, I think it's a bad idea to keep siblings together.

128
00:10:01,327 --> 00:10:05,019
They'll be nothing but trouble if
they start relying on each other.

129
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:11,891
Seeing as you're sisters, we've
decided to split you two up from now on.

130
00:10:12,343 --> 00:10:14,041
Akame, you're with me.

131
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:16,093
Kurome, you're going to the capital.

132
00:10:16,118 --> 00:10:18,365
You can't! Kurome needs to stay with me!

133
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,986
Please don't make me go!

134
00:10:20,838 --> 00:10:21,593
Kurome!

135
00:10:21,836 --> 00:10:23,016
Akame!

136
00:10:25,621 --> 00:10:28,783
NO! Kurome!

137
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,394
We will now begin the experimentation.

138
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,857
You may not have all the innate skills of the Elite Seven,

139
00:10:41,971 --> 00:10:44,743
but these drugs will make up the difference.

140
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:50,864
It's only a matter of time until I
create the perfect assassination squad.

141
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:59,054
When can I see you, Big Sister?

142
00:11:04,712 --> 00:11:06,170
I'm so tired.

143
00:11:09,911 --> 00:11:13,095
Aww, hurry up, I wanna change my dress already!

144
00:11:13,328 --> 00:11:15,409
Not 'til I'm finished patching you up.

145
00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:18,106
Um, Leone, are you sure you'll be all right?

146
00:11:18,355 --> 00:11:20,866
Uh-huh! Can't you see how much better I look?

147
00:11:21,112 --> 00:11:25,277
When Lubb gets back, he can use Cross Tail
to sew my arm back on and I'll be good as new!

148
00:11:25,302 --> 00:11:27,588
Uh, did you say "sew it back on"?!

149
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:30,478
It's a special combo skill only Lubb and I can use.

150
00:11:30,503 --> 00:11:32,000
Pretty handy, don't you think?

151
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:32,606
Uhh...

152
00:11:33,144 --> 00:11:35,501
Healing super quickly is Lionel's trump card!

153
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,660
It's called Regenerator!

154
00:11:37,685 --> 00:11:39,644
Well, that's nice I guess.

155
00:11:39,669 --> 00:11:42,679
Although, my precious Susanoo
can regenerate automatically.

156
00:11:42,704 --> 00:11:45,198
Yeah, whatever. He's still a maid.

157
00:11:45,223 --> 00:11:48,722
Well anyway, it's a relief to find out
that she's not gonna lose her arm forever.

158
00:11:49,035 --> 00:11:49,857
Uh, isn't it?

159
00:11:53,178 --> 00:11:57,156
Still, I gotta say, it's kinda lame
that your trump card doesn't do any damage.

160
00:11:57,222 --> 00:12:00,299
That's cute, you're just mad
'cause you don't have a trump card.

161
00:12:00,359 --> 00:12:02,915
Pumpkin doesn't need a trump card, thank you.

162
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,149
The greater the threat, the stronger its power,

163
00:12:05,174 --> 00:12:07,320
which means it can get me out of almost anything.

164
00:12:07,345 --> 00:12:08,625
I'm putting on the ointment.

165
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,142
It might sting a little.

166
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:11,386
OW OW OW OW OW OW OW!

167
00:12:11,411 --> 00:12:14,929
It's pretty embarrassing when you try
to act cool and end up failing, huh, Mine?

168
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:16,236
I feel your pain.

169
00:12:16,776 --> 00:12:21,477
Don't you dare take pity on me! Least I can
keep my pants on! You're the loser here, not me!

170
00:12:22,872 --> 00:12:24,191
Oh, hey there, Lubb!

171
00:12:24,604 --> 00:12:26,154
Listen, I need to ask you a favor...

172
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:27,166
It's Chelsea!

173
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:35,745
Natara and Doya are the only two friends I have left.

174
00:12:37,177 --> 00:12:40,120
I don't think I'll ever be able to get that many again.

175
00:12:42,663 --> 00:12:44,839
At least my snacks are really tasty.

176
00:12:46,313 --> 00:12:48,640
Ah, Kurome, it's you!

177
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,632
Thank goodness you're not injured!

178
00:12:52,046 --> 00:12:54,014
I can't believe you're still alive.

179
00:12:54,127 --> 00:12:55,859
That was a huge explosion.

180
00:12:55,884 --> 00:13:00,156
The Incendiary Squad put me through a
ritual that made me resistant to fire.

181
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,578
Well, that's good.

182
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:02,997
Glad to hear it.

183
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:05,212
But I lost my Imperial Arms.

184
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:07,188
Are you disappointed in me?

185
00:13:07,267 --> 00:13:08,281
No.

186
00:13:09,015 --> 00:13:13,302
Tatsumi gave me a rundown of the personalities
and speech patterns of all the Jaegers.

187
00:13:13,746 --> 00:13:15,012
Looks like he nailed it.

188
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,382
She's not even going for her weapon.

189
00:13:19,987 --> 00:13:21,797
But I should wait for the right moment.

190
00:13:22,275 --> 00:13:24,458
Akame said she's using enhancements.

191
00:13:25,169 --> 00:13:28,430
If I attack now, she could flip
out and make things difficult.

192
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:32,025
I'll play it safe and wait for a clear opening.

193
00:13:33,434 --> 00:13:36,270
I see. So Chelsea killed Bols.

194
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,027
And then she ran off to face Kurome by herself?

195
00:13:39,229 --> 00:13:42,915
You guys, I saw the way she moved whenever I engaged her.

196
00:13:43,368 --> 00:13:46,984
It seems to me like there's a lot more
going on with her than just a few drugs.

197
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:50,297
Those people may have done some stuff
to her that Akame doesn't even know about.

198
00:13:52,007 --> 00:13:54,210
Chelsea might not be able to do anything to her.

199
00:13:54,302 --> 00:13:56,437
We need to hurry up with those reinforcements.

200
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:59,187
Akame, Tatsumi, that's your cue.

201
00:13:59,318 --> 00:14:01,342
I know you haven't had much time to rest up,

202
00:14:01,367 --> 00:14:03,702
but I need you to find Chelsea and help her win!

203
00:14:03,727 --> 00:14:04,728
Right, you got it!

204
00:14:04,819 --> 00:14:06,200
You can count on us!

205
00:14:07,127 --> 00:14:09,232
I think we're almost to a village now.

206
00:14:09,858 --> 00:14:12,010
But there could be an ambush waiting for us.

207
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,738
Hmm, what is this?

208
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:16,333
I don't know why,

209
00:14:16,483 --> 00:14:19,096
but something about this girl feels a little off.

210
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,747
And I haven't found any golden opportunities.

211
00:14:21,848 --> 00:14:24,292
Maybe I should make a break for it while I still can.

212
00:14:24,505 --> 00:14:27,214
The commander should be coming back this way eventually.

213
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,280
Let's just play it safe until she...

214
00:14:30,896 --> 00:14:32,983
Oh no! Are you in pain, Kurome?!

215
00:14:34,188 --> 00:14:36,116
I guess I should've had more snacks.

216
00:14:38,146 --> 00:14:40,952
Um, what can I do to make you feel better?

217
00:14:41,342 --> 00:14:44,349
I'm fine. I just need to eat something.

218
00:14:44,924 --> 00:14:48,325
Poor thing, you're suffering, aren't you?

219
00:14:48,995 --> 00:14:52,802
I know, I have a trick that'll stop the pain.

220
00:15:01,962 --> 00:15:02,581
See?

221
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:05,054
Nothing can hurt you ever again.

222
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:07,720
It's all over.

223
00:15:11,746 --> 00:15:14,171
Big... Sister...

224
00:15:17,211 --> 00:15:19,701
Both targets... eliminated.

225
00:15:21,015 --> 00:15:24,206
So the last words to come out
of your mouth are "Big Sister."

226
00:15:25,432 --> 00:15:27,181
I really do feel bad for you,

227
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:31,132
but consider it karma for everyone you murdered.

228
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:34,552
Your grades are exceptional, Chelsea!

229
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:37,097
I expect great things from you.

230
00:15:37,177 --> 00:15:40,314
Thank you, Your Excellency! I'll keep doing my best.

231
00:15:40,343 --> 00:15:42,560
Hmm, I'm sure you will.

232
00:15:45,238 --> 00:15:49,130
I'll use my brains to get a decent job
and then marry into lots of money!

233
00:15:50,457 --> 00:15:52,590
Well, that is interesting.

234
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:55,329
Please accept this small gift, Your Excellency.

235
00:15:55,436 --> 00:15:57,403
Perfect, just leave it there and go.

236
00:15:57,428 --> 00:15:59,535
A bribe? How could you?

237
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,101
I saw nothing.

238
00:16:02,918 --> 00:16:03,469
Keep running!

239
00:16:03,494 --> 00:16:04,455
That's it, run!

240
00:16:14,127 --> 00:16:15,521
He's hunting people.

241
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,896
He's... insane!

242
00:16:20,487 --> 00:16:23,606
Is there... anything I can do about it?

243
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:32,125
What is that?

244
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:34,628
Oh, the box in the basement?

245
00:16:34,795 --> 00:16:36,456
That's an Imperial Arms.

246
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,653
It's called Gaia Foundation.

247
00:16:39,108 --> 00:16:43,136
Supposedly, it's been set aside because no one can use it.

248
00:16:43,437 --> 00:16:45,917
Really? No one could?

249
00:16:47,487 --> 00:16:50,370
I feel like... it's calling to me.

250
00:16:54,808 --> 00:16:57,715
It... It wants me to use it!

251
00:17:00,876 --> 00:17:03,355
The viceroy, he's dead!

252
00:17:04,892 --> 00:17:06,250
Everyone's happier now.

253
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,347
They're even cheering!

254
00:17:09,777 --> 00:17:11,900
I've made the world a better place.

255
00:17:13,846 --> 00:17:16,029
If I put my ability to good use,

256
00:17:16,456 --> 00:17:18,789
maybe I can change this messed-up world.

257
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,563
I am bringing peace to this corrupted land.

258
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:26,555
It's too bad you won't be around to see it.

259
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:30,516
Hey!!!

260
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:34,397
How'd you get my sword?!

261
00:17:34,774 --> 00:17:37,121
It's too bad your trick didn't work!

262
00:17:37,454 --> 00:17:40,653
I'm in so much pain right now I'm not sure I can take it!

263
00:17:41,113 --> 00:17:43,297
But my needle insertion is normally fatal!

264
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,258
Right after my sister ran away,

265
00:17:45,283 --> 00:17:48,615
the scientists developed an
even more specialized medicine.

266
00:17:49,388 --> 00:17:54,824
It makes my entire body incredibly
strong, though it does take a bit of a toll.

267
00:17:55,695 --> 00:17:58,398
Even I didn't know I'd survive that though.

268
00:17:59,299 --> 00:18:01,540
If you want to kill me for real,

269
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:07,287
then it looks like your only two options are to
cut off my head or pierce me through the heart.

270
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,518
She's not even human anymore!

271
00:18:15,896 --> 00:18:17,884
I need to transform and get out of here!

272
00:18:24,051 --> 00:18:25,717
Ah... no...

273
00:18:29,728 --> 00:18:30,960
It's hard to move.

274
00:18:31,298 --> 00:18:32,667
I'm running out of energy.

275
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:33,980
Fine.

276
00:18:34,387 --> 00:18:39,318
But if it's the last thing I do, I will
make sure that girl dies right here and now!

277
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:43,025
Earlier she said both targets had been eliminated.

278
00:18:43,784 --> 00:18:46,480
That means she's the one who murdered Bols!

279
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,322
Natara! Doya! Get her!

280
00:18:50,444 --> 00:18:52,261
Chop her into little pieces!

281
00:19:35,627 --> 00:19:37,733
So, it was me.

282
00:19:38,955 --> 00:19:41,332
I was the one who needed to be punished.

283
00:19:45,796 --> 00:19:47,813
I wanted to show you what I can do.

284
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,150
I wanted you to be proud of me.

285
00:19:52,203 --> 00:19:52,992
Tatsumi...

286
00:19:53,764 --> 00:19:55,662
I wanted to see you smile again.

287
00:20:02,587 --> 00:20:03,317
And I...

288
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:06,093
I...

289
00:20:27,204 --> 00:20:29,291
Oh wow, it's really pouring.

290
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:34,089
Hey, I'm gonna go invisible and take
a good look around town real quick.

291
00:20:34,498 --> 00:20:35,748
Stay out of trouble.

292
00:20:36,487 --> 00:20:38,611
You just need to check the status of things.

293
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:39,278
Yeah.

294
00:20:42,488 --> 00:20:45,452
That trail of blood on the
highroad leads all the way into town.

295
00:20:46,449 --> 00:20:49,053
If they caught Chelsea, we've gotta go save her!

296
00:20:49,926 --> 00:20:52,152
Then again, she knows what she's doing.

297
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,569
Maybe we missed each other and
she's already back at the base.

298
00:21:01,018 --> 00:21:02,520
Yeah, I bet that's it.

299
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,672
She wouldn't have done anything crazy.

300
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,205
Must've been enemy blood.

301
00:21:11,335 --> 00:21:12,654
What's going on here?
