1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,656
General Esdeath...

2
00:00:02,756 --> 00:00:08,590
For your success in conquering the northern tribe,
we have arranged a reward of 10,000 gold coins.

3
00:00:08,615 --> 00:00:10,089
I'm grateful, Your Highness.

4
00:00:10,321 --> 00:00:13,549
I'll send it to the soldiers
still fighting to protect our land.

5
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:15,144
They will be pleased.

6
00:00:15,169 --> 00:00:18,790
Esdeath truly doesn't care for money or power.

7
00:00:18,815 --> 00:00:22,376
She is only concerned with war and victory.

8
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,347
As long as I'm in control, she
can destroy whatever she wishes.

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,723
Our interests can coexist.

10
00:00:28,914 --> 00:00:31,638
She is the ideal puppet.

11
00:00:31,718 --> 00:00:37,070
Now that I've returned to the capital from the
northlands, Your Majesty can once again rest at ease.

12
00:00:37,102 --> 00:00:39,481
I shall be terminating Night Raid next.

13
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:40,686
Quite an undertaking.

14
00:00:40,872 --> 00:00:45,553
We would like to compensate you for such an
ambitious achievement with more than just money.

15
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,183
Is there something else you'd prefer?

16
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:50,210
Actually, there is. If I could choose anything...

17
00:00:50,376 --> 00:00:51,330
Go on.

18
00:00:51,637 --> 00:00:53,973
I believe I'd like to try falling in love.

19
00:00:56,971 --> 00:00:59,255
Uh, yes, that sounds reasonable!

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,075
You are a single woman of marriageable age, after all!

21
00:01:02,234 --> 00:01:04,023
I will serve as your matchmaker!

22
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,112
So what is your opinion of the minister here?

23
00:01:06,137 --> 00:01:07,491
Huh? Wait, what?!

24
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:10,361
The Minister doesn't take very good care of himself.

25
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:11,816
He will not live much longer.

26
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:14,440
Preposterous! I'm in perfect health.

27
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,614
Well then, would you be so kind
as to tell us what you'd like?

28
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:21,598
First, let me warn you that I can be terribly selective.

29
00:01:21,645 --> 00:01:24,744
Very few men will come close to my expectations.

30
00:01:25,292 --> 00:01:29,298
Once I'm ready, I will present you with
an extensive list of my preferences.

31
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:12,577
Here.

32
00:03:12,627 --> 00:03:14,325
I don't need you to spoon-feed me!

33
00:03:14,435 --> 00:03:15,858
But it'll get cold.

34
00:03:20,321 --> 00:03:21,743
Okay, I guess you win.

35
00:03:26,587 --> 00:03:27,954
Even after what happened...

36
00:03:28,495 --> 00:03:29,983
Akame's so calm.

37
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:32,602
I still can't believe it.

38
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,212
I can't believe that girl killed Sheele.

39
00:03:36,623 --> 00:03:38,476
I'm finally starting to realize...

40
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:41,473
how painful this job really is.

41
00:03:43,397 --> 00:03:44,832
You know, it's strange.

42
00:03:45,086 --> 00:03:48,790
I don't normally take an interest
in anything besides war and bloodshed.

43
00:03:48,815 --> 00:03:51,651
Oh, we're talking about love, I presume?

44
00:03:51,676 --> 00:03:56,424
I don't even understand this myself, but
I'm feeling a desperate need for romance.

45
00:03:56,449 --> 00:04:00,849
Desire for the opposite sex is
something all living creatures feel.

46
00:04:01,062 --> 00:04:04,874
I don't know if I'd use the word "romance" in your case.

47
00:04:04,899 --> 00:04:08,358
It's interesting, yet it's still an animalistic instinct.

48
00:04:08,896 --> 00:04:12,859
But for the moment, I must channel all
my energy into eliminating Night Raid.

49
00:04:12,884 --> 00:04:15,087
Ah, while we're on the subject.

50
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:18,515
I've come up with a new idea that I think you'll like.

51
00:04:20,967 --> 00:04:24,148
I have a special assignment
for you, my precious Three Beasts.

52
00:04:24,173 --> 00:04:27,292
We will do anything you command us to do, General Esdeath.

53
00:04:27,317 --> 00:04:31,067
Yes ma'am, all of us are your
loyal and devoted servants forever!

54
00:04:31,092 --> 00:04:34,455
No matter what you wish, we will
carry out any order at any time.

55
00:04:34,776 --> 00:04:35,572
Good.

56
00:04:38,721 --> 00:04:40,062
Man, it's cold.

57
00:04:40,235 --> 00:04:42,363
How am I supposed to sleep like this?

58
00:04:43,063 --> 00:04:44,097
I'll get some water.

59
00:04:45,158 --> 00:04:45,911
Akame?

60
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:48,153
Late-night snack?

61
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:52,092
No, but they were always one of Sheele's favorites.

62
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,373
It's an offering.

63
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,248
Since our work's always been done behind the scenes,

64
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:59,894
Sheele's name probably isn't in
the Revolutionary record books.

65
00:05:00,195 --> 00:05:04,403
So if I don't hold on to her memory,
then it'll be just like she was never here.

66
00:05:05,312 --> 00:05:07,083
She might have been absentminded,

67
00:05:07,294 --> 00:05:09,895
but she was the kindest person on the team.

68
00:05:11,843 --> 00:05:12,618
I agree.

69
00:05:12,892 --> 00:05:16,966
And I see you still leave flowers at Sayo
and Ieyasu's graves sometimes too, don't you?

70
00:05:16,991 --> 00:05:17,513
Yeah.

71
00:05:17,812 --> 00:05:20,190
Akame, you're pretty amazing.

72
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,744
You're handling your friend's death so calmly.

73
00:05:24,051 --> 00:05:25,311
I guess you're used to it.

74
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,718
I still can't-.

75
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:29,431
You think that I'm...

76
00:05:30,217 --> 00:05:31,410
I'm used to it?

77
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:32,435
Akame?

78
00:05:39,012 --> 00:05:43,224
Sure... maybe I've witnessed
more deaths than I care to count.

79
00:05:43,497 --> 00:05:46,632
But this... you don't ever get used to it!

80
00:05:46,741 --> 00:05:50,391
Godammit! You just hide it and you finish the mission!

81
00:05:50,637 --> 00:05:55,527
I have to act like everything is okay,
but on the inside, I've been falling apart!

82
00:05:58,392 --> 00:06:00,306
We're assassins, Tatsumi,

83
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:03,034
we have to be able to switch things on and off.

84
00:06:03,577 --> 00:06:06,462
You... You think that I'm calm?

85
00:06:07,181 --> 00:06:12,622
Well you're wrong! You don't know what it's
like! You don't know what losing her means to me!

86
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:13,864
You don't know...

87
00:06:16,517 --> 00:06:18,954
I've never seen Akame break down like this.

88
00:06:20,401 --> 00:06:22,113
I guess I shouldn't be surprised.

89
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:24,710
She was pretty worried about me on my first mission.

90
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:28,029
What the hell's wrong with me?

91
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:30,652
Feeling sorry for myself isn't gonna bring Sheele back!

92
00:06:30,764 --> 00:06:33,067
I just need to move on and remember why I'm here!

93
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:35,393
I need to grow up and just be a man!

94
00:06:40,387 --> 00:06:43,136
It's a dirty job, but money is money,

95
00:06:43,557 --> 00:06:47,154
and I have to keep my village from
starving until the revolution is over.

96
00:06:47,842 --> 00:06:50,884
I have to do what I can for the people I care about most!

97
00:06:51,966 --> 00:06:54,945
What did you do that for?! Tatsumi, are you all right?

98
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:58,578
Yeah, I just needed to get my head
back together. Don't worry about me.

99
00:06:58,865 --> 00:07:01,028
I also wanna tell you that I'm sorry.

100
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,045
That was insensitive of me.

101
00:07:03,504 --> 00:07:05,054
And I wanna renew my pledge to you:

102
00:07:05,652 --> 00:07:09,594
I promise you I won't die and I
won't ever make you sad again, Akame!

103
00:07:10,324 --> 00:07:11,356
Tatsumi...

104
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,189
We're gonna make it through to the end.

105
00:07:14,314 --> 00:07:16,139
I want to see the new nation together!

106
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:19,503
Yeah. I'd like that.

107
00:07:34,515 --> 00:07:36,036
YAH!

108
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:37,576
Crap!

109
00:07:41,555 --> 00:07:42,695
One more round, all right?

110
00:07:43,037 --> 00:07:45,899
Don't you think you might need
to rest up a little bit first?

111
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:47,152
I don't have time for that!

112
00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:51,135
Remember, we're pretending this
is a real fight, so don't hold back!

113
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:52,712
Here I coooome...

114
00:07:57,525 --> 00:07:59,253
Dammit, Bro, what was that for?!

115
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:02,741
If you want to pretend it's for real, you
should pay more attention to what's around you.

116
00:08:02,766 --> 00:08:05,773
There could always be another enemy nearby. Understand?

117
00:08:07,982 --> 00:08:10,417
Well, somebody seems a little on edge today.

118
00:08:10,877 --> 00:08:11,475
What's up?

119
00:08:11,687 --> 00:08:12,720
Not much.

120
00:08:12,745 --> 00:08:14,850
I just want to level up as fast as I can.

121
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:17,292
I have to keep my promise to Akame!

122
00:08:17,317 --> 00:08:19,469
No matter what happens, I have to survive!

123
00:08:21,588 --> 00:08:22,444
I hope so...

124
00:08:22,824 --> 00:08:25,339
Now that's the kind of attitude I like to see!

125
00:08:25,364 --> 00:08:27,267
You've come pretty far! Say!

126
00:08:27,292 --> 00:08:29,517
Why don't you try sparring with me for a little while?

127
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:30,959
I can whip you into shape!

128
00:08:30,984 --> 00:08:32,199
Sure! Great!

129
00:08:32,786 --> 00:08:35,173
You watch yourself! I'm pretty good with a spear!

130
00:08:35,198 --> 00:08:35,993
Heads up!

131
00:08:36,944 --> 00:08:38,508
Is that really all you got?!

132
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,540
Takes more than passion to stay alive, you know!

133
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,895
Yeah! Yaaahhh!

134
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,997
Now come at me!

135
00:08:47,044 --> 00:08:47,881
Good luck.

136
00:08:50,651 --> 00:08:52,686
Yet another devastated village.

137
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,468
A nation is nothing without its people.

138
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,669
You really do care, don't you, Father?

139
00:08:57,885 --> 00:09:00,981
Enough to return to the snake pit of the capital.

140
00:09:01,006 --> 00:09:02,223
It makes me proud.

141
00:09:02,248 --> 00:09:05,806
This is no time to cower in
retirement and let life pass me by.

142
00:09:05,831 --> 00:09:08,868
I intend to fight that minister till my very last breath.

143
00:09:08,893 --> 00:09:11,778
And I intend to watch over you every step of the way!

144
00:09:11,803 --> 00:09:13,669
I'm lucky to have such a brave daughter.

145
00:09:14,007 --> 00:09:16,544
Now, if only you wouldn't scare away all of your suitors.

146
00:09:16,569 --> 00:09:19,496
Wha-?! Now what does that have to do with anything?!

147
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:23,181
What's happening out there?!

148
00:09:25,256 --> 00:09:26,522
More bandits...

149
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,986
This area's getting worse all the time!

150
00:09:29,011 --> 00:09:31,090
Don't worry, Father. I'll take care of this!

151
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:32,859
Everyone, ready!

152
00:09:34,648 --> 00:09:35,716
Daidara...

153
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:36,162
Yep!

154
00:09:37,317 --> 00:09:38,418
Take 'em out!

155
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:42,240
YAH-HA!

156
00:09:49,257 --> 00:09:51,031
I'm sorry, Father...

157
00:09:51,056 --> 00:09:53,959
Well, you're a feisty one, aren't cha?

158
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,444
But considering everything I'm about to do to you,

159
00:09:56,469 --> 00:09:58,804
you're probably gonna wish you'd been killed already.

160
00:10:04,158 --> 00:10:07,227
You... you're an Imperial officer!

161
00:10:07,395 --> 00:10:10,907
I am, and I once had a deep
respect for your diplomacy, sir.

162
00:10:10,932 --> 00:10:13,893
Then why in God's name would you do something like this?!

163
00:10:14,122 --> 00:10:16,130
Because my master ordered it.

164
00:10:20,668 --> 00:10:24,270
And the wishes of my master shall always be realized.

165
00:10:25,332 --> 00:10:28,630
Look at this. We took out like 15 guys.

166
00:10:28,659 --> 00:10:32,046
Sweet, man! I'm gonna get so
many experience points for this!

167
00:10:32,071 --> 00:10:33,523
Don't forget the notices.

168
00:10:34,594 --> 00:10:37,284
If you ask me, the minister's idea's a pain in the ass.

169
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:40,379
Why not pin it on his political
enemies like he usually does?

170
00:10:40,404 --> 00:10:44,826
Because this plan would have no effect on
officials under the protection of Great General Budo.

171
00:10:44,851 --> 00:10:46,626
Ah, are we done already?

172
00:10:46,651 --> 00:10:48,625
Nyau, stop screwing around!

173
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:50,842
You did make sure to finish her off, didn't you?

174
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:55,578
I was just in the middle of skinning her face
when she died of shock.

175
00:10:55,603 --> 00:10:57,631
You are one messed-up kid, you know that?

176
00:10:58,238 --> 00:11:01,183
The mission is now complete. Let's be on our way.

177
00:11:11,511 --> 00:11:14,630
Now that everyone is here,
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

178
00:11:14,655 --> 00:11:18,716
Esdeath has taken the northern tribe, and
has now returned to the Imperial Capital.

179
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,692
Leone I would like you to make your way to the
capital and figure out what General Esdeath is up to.

180
00:11:25,717 --> 00:11:28,678
You got it! I've been wondering what that chick is like!

181
00:11:30,642 --> 00:11:33,432
She's a disturbed psychopath obsessed with killing.

182
00:11:33,587 --> 00:11:34,560
Don't be careless.

183
00:11:34,621 --> 00:11:36,149
All right, don't worry.

184
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,856
That means I can waste her if
I get the chance, doesn't it?

185
00:11:39,973 --> 00:11:43,060
I heard that wackjob is the
strongest person in the empire.

186
00:11:43,401 --> 00:11:46,405
That puts her right up there
with the minister on our hit list!

187
00:11:49,268 --> 00:11:51,997
Also, ever since her arrival in the capital,

188
00:11:52,051 --> 00:11:55,352
there's been an increase in
assassinations of imperial officials.

189
00:11:55,987 --> 00:12:00,259
As of today, four officers and
61 bodyguards have been murdered.

190
00:12:00,445 --> 00:12:03,080
What concerns me are these flyers
they've been scattering around

191
00:12:03,162 --> 00:12:05,862
that claim Night Raid is responsible for the homicides.

192
00:12:05,932 --> 00:12:08,268
So they're trying to stick the whole thing on us, huh?

193
00:12:08,474 --> 00:12:10,780
But doesn't this sorta stuff always get straightened out?

194
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,171
Those posters really don't look all that legit.

195
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,955
That's how most people felt about it at first.

196
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,597
But now, public opinion is starting to change.

197
00:12:18,622 --> 00:12:19,311
But why?!

198
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:22,957
All of the victims had first-rate
guards when the crimes were committed.

199
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,949
They couldn't have been overpowered by ordinary thugs.

200
00:12:26,024 --> 00:12:29,300
So basically, these guys are
going after the big fish on purpose.

201
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,351
Only a few people could pull that off.

202
00:12:31,437 --> 00:12:33,872
That would only be us or someone equally skilled.

203
00:12:33,897 --> 00:12:35,664
It's safe to assume two things:

204
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:39,252
They probably have Imperial Arms,
and they're working for General Esdeath.

205
00:12:39,277 --> 00:12:40,758
What is she trying to accomplish?

206
00:12:40,783 --> 00:12:42,185
She's trying to trick us.

207
00:12:42,435 --> 00:12:44,938
She wants to lure us out in the open so she can strike.

208
00:12:44,963 --> 00:12:48,103
Now that we know it's a trap, I
want to throw one more thing out there.

209
00:12:48,302 --> 00:12:51,070
The people they're assassinating
are all competent individuals

210
00:12:51,223 --> 00:12:55,093
who disagree with the minister's policies
and recognize the need for revolution.

211
00:12:55,202 --> 00:12:56,818
After we create the new nation,

212
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:59,777
allies like them will be crucial to its success.

213
00:13:01,841 --> 00:13:02,876
To put it simply:

214
00:13:03,569 --> 00:13:05,633
We cannot afford to continue losing them.

215
00:13:06,777 --> 00:13:08,554
I'd like to hear everyone's thoughts.

216
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:10,201
Listen...

217
00:13:10,864 --> 00:13:13,189
I don't know very much about all this political stuff,

218
00:13:13,367 --> 00:13:17,143
but the idea of somebody abusing Night
Raid's name like that really pisses me off!

219
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:19,129
Tatsumi...

220
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:21,271
You know, you're exactly right.

221
00:13:21,314 --> 00:13:22,158
Thanks, man.

222
00:13:24,756 --> 00:13:26,550
Good! That settles it.

223
00:13:26,699 --> 00:13:29,395
Show the bastards what happens when they use our name.

224
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,324
Night Raid will not be sullied.

225
00:13:32,098 --> 00:13:34,884
There are two of us that they'll likely target next:

226
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,258
Akame and Lubbock.

227
00:13:36,656 --> 00:13:40,076
Tatsumi and Bulat, you will
guard the person I assign to you.

228
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,500
Sounds good to me. Just tell us where to
meet him, and we'll take care of everything.

229
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:48,802
Your charge will be boarding a cruise ship currently
docked at the grand canal near the Imperial Capital...

230
00:13:49,222 --> 00:13:50,235
the Ryusen!

231
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,548
It's... It's huge!!

232
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,855
Looks more like a fortress than a cruise ship.

233
00:14:02,249 --> 00:14:04,716
Should be an interesting place to intercept our targets.

234
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:08,801
Rice reserves, huh? Must be pretty smart.

235
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:12,503
All that rice will make a lot of people happy.

236
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,928
I guess I made myself hungry just looking at it.

237
00:14:16,953 --> 00:14:20,450
You can have my rations if you take out
any enemies that pop up. We got a deal?

238
00:14:23,628 --> 00:14:24,628
No action here.

239
00:14:25,357 --> 00:14:27,513
Looks like we completely missed the mark this time.

240
00:14:27,802 --> 00:14:29,260
Don't let your guard down yet.

241
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,364
I know, I won't.

242
00:14:32,052 --> 00:14:33,692
Tatsumi... Bulat...

243
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:36,042
If they're going after your target...

244
00:14:38,558 --> 00:14:40,981
Please... come back safe!

245
00:14:49,035 --> 00:14:51,453
The guy we're protecting is surrounded by bodyguards.

246
00:14:52,272 --> 00:14:54,432
There's no way anyone could even get close to 'em.

247
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:56,163
They probably aren't gonna show up.

248
00:14:57,077 --> 00:14:57,907
The hell was that?

249
00:14:57,931 --> 00:14:59,914
Don't be so quick to assume, Tatsumi.

250
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:01,305
Wait... Bro?!

251
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:04,546
My trump card is invisibility, remember?

252
00:15:04,917 --> 00:15:07,072
And you never know what our foes might do.

253
00:15:08,055 --> 00:15:08,916
Yeah, you're right.

254
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:11,064
I guess I didn't think that through, did I?

255
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,358
How many times would you say you've
smacked me in the head, by the way?

256
00:15:14,383 --> 00:15:17,015
Eh, sometimes you need a little tough love.

257
00:15:17,097 --> 00:15:19,046
Love... love...

258
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,985
Did you really have to make it echo?!

259
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:24,051
Well anyway, I bet this armor
is really cool to have around.

260
00:15:24,896 --> 00:15:27,070
It certainly made it easy to sneak up onto the ship.

261
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:30,356
That's right. Got me through
the battle with the southern tribe.

262
00:15:30,649 --> 00:15:33,210
I kinda like to think of it as my partner.

263
00:15:33,772 --> 00:15:38,436
However, when it comes to partnerships,
sometimes things aren't always so simple.

264
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,137
Sir! I don't understand!

265
00:15:43,256 --> 00:15:45,994
I mean how can they just discharge you from the capital?!

266
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,257
I couldn't stand the thought of having
to bribe the new minister, so I refused.

267
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:54,392
So if you want to move up in rank,
you just have to give him some money?!

268
00:15:54,514 --> 00:15:55,711
That's bullshit!

269
00:15:56,809 --> 00:15:58,195
Calm yourself, Bulat.

270
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,105
I am going back to the capital to plead my case.

271
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:05,413
Despite the position I'm in at the
moment, I have done nothing wrong.

272
00:16:05,511 --> 00:16:07,935
I am confident that the court will see that.

273
00:16:08,095 --> 00:16:08,748
General...

274
00:16:09,055 --> 00:16:11,967
It wasn't fair that you were
placed under an officer like me.

275
00:16:12,357 --> 00:16:13,915
I hope you can forgive me.

276
00:16:15,261 --> 00:16:17,643
Of course... I admire you.

277
00:16:19,306 --> 00:16:23,028
But as you can imagine, the court
didn't end up ruling in his favor.

278
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:28,046
And then some people who were jealous of
my ability started saying I was a criminal.

279
00:16:29,508 --> 00:16:30,866
I was getting sick of it.

280
00:16:31,197 --> 00:16:34,118
So I used Incursio to escape before they could catch me.

281
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:35,655
Man, that's so messed up.

282
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:38,959
Looks like my invisibility's wearing off.

283
00:16:39,411 --> 00:16:40,663
Better remove my armor.

284
00:16:41,078 --> 00:16:45,128
But they know your face from all the posters.
You can let me handle the open public areas, okay?

285
00:16:45,318 --> 00:16:48,023
Good thinking! I'll go check the ship's hold.

286
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,921
I'd better keep an eye out for
anybody who looks suspicious.

287
00:16:56,122 --> 00:16:58,840
Ha! Though I guess I look pretty suspicious myself.

288
00:17:01,849 --> 00:17:03,114
Who's playing a flute?

289
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,884
I'll have your best dessert.

290
00:17:05,978 --> 00:17:07,531
Uh yes, comin' right up.

291
00:17:11,483 --> 00:17:13,653
She's sitting right out in the open.

292
00:17:13,786 --> 00:17:14,988
I can sense it.

293
00:17:15,181 --> 00:17:17,045
This is a trap to draw us out!

294
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,439
That evil woman!

295
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:21,208
She's oozing with the scent of hatred!

296
00:17:21,233 --> 00:17:23,387
I can smell it all over her!

297
00:17:24,683 --> 00:17:28,657
It was stupid of me to think I could take
her out just because she was easy to find!

298
00:17:29,053 --> 00:17:32,787
It kills me, but I must follow my instincts and withdraw.

299
00:17:33,126 --> 00:17:34,972
The aura's gone.

300
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,171
I guess they didn't take the bait.

301
00:17:37,696 --> 00:17:40,632
And I'd hoped to test out some new torture techniques.

302
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:44,294
My, that's pretty good.

303
00:17:46,012 --> 00:17:48,572
Perhaps I'll treat everyone when this job is done.

304
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:56,356
Your sweet melody sounds as elegant as ever.

305
00:17:56,602 --> 00:18:00,779
The cruise ship has left the Imperial Capital
and no one can see us from the shore.

306
00:18:00,804 --> 00:18:02,659
It appears the timing will be perfect.

307
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:07,492
I've been playing for a long time now, so
all the passengers should be nice and drowsy!

308
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:11,330
There may be people on board who don't
appreciate the beauty of your music.

309
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:12,865
You'll have to be wary.

310
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:13,720
Of course...

311
00:18:15,487 --> 00:18:16,916
What the heck is going on?

312
00:18:18,591 --> 00:18:20,151
That flute must be causing this.

313
00:18:21,293 --> 00:18:22,464
I gotta get outside!

314
00:18:25,358 --> 00:18:27,244
I can still hear it out here!

315
00:18:27,353 --> 00:18:28,996
It has to be an Imperial Arms.

316
00:18:29,469 --> 00:18:32,664
Hey little fella, it's supposed to be nap time.

317
00:18:32,991 --> 00:18:35,874
And here I was gonna let you live if you were sleepin'.

318
00:18:36,222 --> 00:18:38,899
You must be one of those Night
Raid posers I've heard about.

319
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,874
Does that mean you think you're the real deal?

320
00:18:41,899 --> 00:18:42,958
This should be good.

321
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,271
Heads up!

322
00:18:45,978 --> 00:18:47,188
Hey, what's the sword for?

323
00:18:47,386 --> 00:18:48,512
Gotta fight fair.

324
00:18:48,655 --> 00:18:51,096
I wanna make sure I get experience points for this.

325
00:18:51,284 --> 00:18:52,878
Always looking to get stronger.

326
00:18:53,026 --> 00:18:54,321
Come at me, little man!

327
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:55,715
Uh, fine.

328
00:18:56,063 --> 00:18:57,526
I'll give you some experience.

329
00:18:57,697 --> 00:18:59,328
But it's not gonna be pretty!

330
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:02,537
Ah, nice! I like that confidence!

331
00:19:02,581 --> 00:19:04,577
Man, it's gonna be fun to crush you!

332
00:19:07,483 --> 00:19:08,553
Heh, heh!

333
00:19:10,131 --> 00:19:13,037
Amazing you could dodge that after the music debuff.

334
00:19:13,493 --> 00:19:14,654
That's okay.

335
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:18,224
Let's see how you handle this!

336
00:19:27,649 --> 00:19:29,645
Are those things your Imperial Arms?

337
00:19:30,023 --> 00:19:32,469
Yup! Double Great Axes Belvaac.

338
00:19:32,524 --> 00:19:35,253
Bet a low-level punk like you can't even hit it!

339
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:38,636
In that case...

340
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:41,354
I guess I'll just have to make it hit you!

341
00:19:42,774 --> 00:19:44,485
Tatsumi, you idiot!

342
00:19:45,605 --> 00:19:48,511
That guy was obviously getting
ready to finish you off and you just

343
00:19:48,535 --> 00:19:50,439
barreled right in there without even thinking about it!

344
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,165
You need to learn to be more responsible!

345
00:19:53,396 --> 00:19:55,728
Hang on! How do you have so much energy?

346
00:19:55,948 --> 00:19:59,480
The Song of Lethargy was supposed
to put everybody on the boat to sleep.

347
00:20:00,027 --> 00:20:02,015
So that's what all that racket was about?

348
00:20:02,121 --> 00:20:04,281
Cheap crap like that doesn't work on me.

349
00:20:04,305 --> 00:20:04,857
What?

350
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:08,580
If you think playing a little tune is enough
to smother the burning passion in my soul,

351
00:20:08,605 --> 00:20:10,886
then you've got another thing coming, my friend!

352
00:20:11,806 --> 00:20:12,830
Wait a sec...

353
00:20:12,855 --> 00:20:15,197
Okay, I see what you did there.

354
00:20:15,222 --> 00:20:18,703
You stabbed yourself so you'd be
too distracted to hear the lullaby.

355
00:20:18,728 --> 00:20:20,664
The name's Bulat of Night Raid.

356
00:20:20,689 --> 00:20:22,264
You can also call me "Handsome".

357
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:24,119
Yeah, I don't think so, jackass.

358
00:20:24,144 --> 00:20:26,125
I'm Daidara, servant of Esdeath.

359
00:20:26,553 --> 00:20:27,269
Tatsumi...

360
00:20:28,388 --> 00:20:32,188
It's very important for you to pay
close attention to how I fight, okay?

361
00:20:33,552 --> 00:20:34,191
Bro?

362
00:20:37,413 --> 00:20:40,189
Incursio!

363
00:20:48,642 --> 00:20:51,862
I am gonna get a ton of experience points for this guy!

364
00:20:53,108 --> 00:20:54,162
Behind you!

365
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,716
He's mine! I'm gonna crack his skull open!

366
00:21:05,445 --> 00:21:06,082
See?

367
00:21:06,586 --> 00:21:10,254
This is what I meant when I told you
to always be aware of your surroundings.

368
00:21:11,225 --> 00:21:14,093
He slaughtered the big guy AND
got the other two off his back.

369
00:21:15,255 --> 00:21:18,405
And... he did it in a split second!

370
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:23,892
Whoa, I always knew you were a good fighter,

371
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,432
but that was awesome!

372
00:21:25,512 --> 00:21:29,953
Damn straight! Back in my soldier days,
they used to call me Hundred-Man Slayer.

373
00:21:30,284 --> 00:21:33,258
I believe it was a 128, to be exact.

374
00:21:33,573 --> 00:21:37,866
You played a vital role in getting rid of
covert operatives back then, did you not?

375
00:21:37,999 --> 00:21:40,745
I'd know that power and that armor anywhere.

376
00:21:40,889 --> 00:21:43,537
It truly has been a while, hasn't it, Bulat?

377
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,145
It's you...

378
00:21:48,862 --> 00:21:50,660
General Liver!
