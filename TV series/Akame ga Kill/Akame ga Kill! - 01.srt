1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,091
Whoa!

2
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:13,226
It's an Earth Dragon!

3
00:00:22,425 --> 00:00:25,025
Class One Danger Beast... Right.

4
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:26,771
An Earth Dragon.

5
00:00:26,921 --> 00:00:27,984
This should be fun.

6
00:00:33,214 --> 00:00:34,402
Aah, don't be mad.

7
00:00:36,596 --> 00:00:37,695
I'll take care of ya!

8
00:00:52,566 --> 00:00:55,118
That was incredible, kid!

9
00:00:55,143 --> 00:00:58,366
You took down a Class One Danger Beast all by yourself!

10
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,373
Aww, it was nothing!

11
00:01:01,413 --> 00:01:03,715
Kinda like taking candy from a big, scaly baby!

12
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,373
Uhh...

13
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,513
Oh yeah, and the name's Tatsumi by the way.

14
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,228
The whole capital's gonna know my name before too long,

15
00:01:09,449 --> 00:01:10,682
so you might wanna remember it.

16
00:01:10,852 --> 00:01:14,321
So you're going to the Imperial
Capital to seek your fortune?

17
00:01:14,421 --> 00:01:18,395
Yep! Where I come from, everyone
dreams of making it big in the capital.

18
00:01:18,435 --> 00:01:22,250
Look kid, the Imperial Capital
isn't some perfect dreamland.

19
00:01:22,276 --> 00:01:27,465
Sure it's the big city, but it's been overrun with
monsters even more vicious than this Earth Dragon here.

20
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:28,263
I don't get it;

21
00:01:28,476 --> 00:01:30,476
How can the city be full of Danger Beasts?

22
00:01:30,646 --> 00:01:34,615
Not those monsters. They're humans,
but with the hearts of monsters.

23
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,430
Damn place is crawling with them.

24
00:01:37,706 --> 00:01:39,346
Thanks for the warning, guys,

25
00:01:39,525 --> 00:01:42,055
but there's no way I'm gonna turn around and go back now.

26
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,312
You see, me and my friends,

27
00:01:44,725 --> 00:01:45,692
we have a mission:

28
00:01:46,087 --> 00:01:47,191
To make a fortune,

29
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,151
and save our village!

30
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:54,216
All people must one day turn to ash,

31
00:01:54,435 --> 00:01:57,593
so too must nations fall to ruin.

32
00:01:58,059 --> 00:02:01,033
Despite the capital's wealth and prosperity,

33
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,628
it has become mired in corruption.

34
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:08,473
The pompous, and the vile,
run rampant throughout the city.

35
00:02:08,784 --> 00:02:11,453
These demons are beyond salvation.

36
00:02:11,626 --> 00:02:15,265
And are therefore silenced in the darkness

37
00:02:15,429 --> 00:02:18,702
by an elite group of assassins.

38
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:55,993
Oooh maaan...

39
00:03:56,546 --> 00:03:58,612
The capital's even bigger than I thought!

40
00:03:59,192 --> 00:04:02,215
If things work out here, I can just BUY the village!

41
00:04:02,482 --> 00:04:04,537
All right, I better get to the barracks.

42
00:04:06,648 --> 00:04:08,893
So you'd like to enlist, would ya?

43
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:12,366
All right, just fill out the form and bring it back to me.

44
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:13,774
Wait, wait, wait, wait...

45
00:04:14,405 --> 00:04:16,285
This says I'd be starting as a private.

46
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:17,788
You think you're special?

47
00:04:17,813 --> 00:04:19,166
Not starting from the bottom!

48
00:04:20,113 --> 00:04:21,552
I'm way too good for that.

49
00:04:21,945 --> 00:04:25,045
I was thinking something more
along the lines of a, say, captain!

50
00:04:25,561 --> 00:04:27,195
Get the hell outta here!

51
00:04:27,755 --> 00:04:29,847
Hey, c'mon, can I at least take the test?!

52
00:04:29,872 --> 00:04:32,823
There's a depression going on! I already
got more applicants than I can handle!

53
00:04:32,848 --> 00:04:35,217
I'm not gonna waste a spot on some stupid kid!

54
00:04:35,677 --> 00:04:37,334
Huh? A depression?

55
00:04:37,614 --> 00:04:38,929
Now get outta here! Beat it!

56
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:46,893
Maybe I could stage like a kidnapping
and save the day just in time...

57
00:04:47,513 --> 00:04:48,943
Nah, that's too obvious.

58
00:04:48,968 --> 00:04:50,462
Hellooooo!

59
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:51,568
Hmmm?

60
00:04:52,287 --> 00:04:54,335
What's with the long face there, little guy?

61
00:04:54,542 --> 00:04:56,747
It'll be all right, Big Sis is here to cheer you up!

62
00:04:56,772 --> 00:04:59,216
Aaaahhhh...

63
00:04:59,496 --> 00:05:01,946
I think I love this place!

64
00:05:01,971 --> 00:05:02,431
Hm?

65
00:05:02,694 --> 00:05:04,104
Try to focus here, buddy.

66
00:05:04,523 --> 00:05:05,288
Ahhhhh...

67
00:05:05,606 --> 00:05:06,794
So, let me guess!

68
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:09,924
You came in from the countryside in
search of fame and fortune, didn't you?

69
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:10,778
How'd you know that?!

70
00:05:11,035 --> 00:05:12,830
I've lived here for a long time.

71
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:15,206
By now, it's super easy to spot a new face.

72
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:19,973
Hey! I know the secret to becoming
an officer in the army super quick.

73
00:05:19,998 --> 00:05:20,687
Tell me!

74
00:05:20,798 --> 00:05:21,923
You really wanna know?

75
00:05:21,948 --> 00:05:23,015
Ahuh, ahuh.

76
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,545
Well... first you gotta treat me to lunch.

77
00:05:29,986 --> 00:05:33,340
Man! Never too early in the
day for some hooch, am I right?!

78
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,214
Go ahead, drink up! There's still a little more left.

79
00:05:36,239 --> 00:05:39,061
Look, just forget the drinks and
tell me how to become an officer!

80
00:05:39,341 --> 00:05:41,887
Yeah... well, about that, uh...

81
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,002
First you're gonna need a lot of money.

82
00:05:46,052 --> 00:05:46,659
Money?

83
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:50,275
Ya' see I... just happen to know someone in the army.

84
00:05:50,549 --> 00:05:53,066
He could hook you up if you make it worth his while.

85
00:05:53,366 --> 00:05:54,272
Okay then.

86
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:55,748
Let's see...

87
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:57,132
Will this be enough?

88
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:59,079
Whoo! Whadda we have here?!

89
00:05:59,104 --> 00:06:02,769
It's just some reward money from
killing a Class One Danger Beast, no biggy.

90
00:06:02,914 --> 00:06:03,475
Hmmm?

91
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:04,876
Big guy...

92
00:06:05,487 --> 00:06:07,310
You might just jump straight up to captain!

93
00:06:07,335 --> 00:06:08,810
Yeah? Let's hope so!

94
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:14,459
I believe our little encounter's been
educational in more ways than you know, kid.

95
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:16,769
Right, I'm gonna talk to him.

96
00:06:17,034 --> 00:06:18,045
You wait here, okay?

97
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,584
Seee yaaa!

98
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,977
Hey buddy, I'd like to go home sometime tonight, ya know.

99
00:06:34,002 --> 00:06:36,124
Oh, I'm just waiting here for somebody.

100
00:06:36,331 --> 00:06:39,123
Yeah, sorry to tell you this son,
but she took your money and ran.

101
00:06:40,265 --> 00:06:40,676
Huh?

102
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:43,213
HUH?!

103
00:06:43,238 --> 00:06:45,969
Don't you know better than to just
hand some stranger everything you got?

104
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,473
I gotta go find her! Which way did she go?!

105
00:06:48,498 --> 00:06:49,687
Don't waste your time.

106
00:06:49,844 --> 00:06:51,499
It's your own fault you got scammed.

107
00:06:51,524 --> 00:06:53,464
Aaaaaaaa...

108
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:56,635
Aaww, this totally sucks!

109
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,049
That was every penny I had!

110
00:06:58,452 --> 00:06:59,520
Damn that rack!

111
00:06:59,662 --> 00:07:04,145
No wait, better yet damn that girl! I
guess that was my "educational experience".

112
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:06,720
Awww...

113
00:07:07,641 --> 00:07:10,423
None of the people back at the village are such liars.

114
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:12,604
Guess...

115
00:07:13,071 --> 00:07:14,504
I'm sleeping outside.

116
00:07:14,711 --> 00:07:16,262
Don't really have a choice, do I?

117
00:07:16,901 --> 00:07:17,849
Stop right here!

118
00:07:21,495 --> 00:07:23,410
Are we really doing this again, milady?

119
00:07:23,499 --> 00:07:24,946
You know I can't help it!

120
00:07:25,152 --> 00:07:26,645
This is just the way I am.

121
00:07:27,415 --> 00:07:28,427
Excuse me.

122
00:07:28,775 --> 00:07:32,599
Um, if you need some place to rest your head
tonight, you're welcome to come home with me?

123
00:07:34,653 --> 00:07:36,644
Uh... thanks, but I'm broke.

124
00:07:37,796 --> 00:07:40,054
Well if you weren't, you wouldn't be here, now would you?

125
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:43,935
Lady Aria has a bit of a weakness
for helping those with nowhere to go.

126
00:07:44,035 --> 00:07:45,594
You really should accept her offer.

127
00:07:45,619 --> 00:07:46,639
Pretty please.

128
00:07:47,878 --> 00:07:51,462
Well, uh, it's better than
sleeping out on the street I guess.

129
00:07:51,487 --> 00:07:52,952
Great, let's go home!

130
00:07:53,359 --> 00:07:56,118
Oh! Looks like Aria brought home another guest.

131
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,359
Oh my! So it would seem.

132
00:07:58,384 --> 00:07:59,472
How many does this make?

133
00:07:59,496 --> 00:08:00,259
Mother!

134
00:08:00,284 --> 00:08:03,343
Uh... oh! Thank you so much for having me.

135
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:05,716
Those guys are really big.

136
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:09,874
Must make it easier to let complete strangers
stay at your house with security like that.

137
00:08:10,549 --> 00:08:11,968
You can feel pretty safe.

138
00:08:13,422 --> 00:08:17,579
And just when I thought everyone in the
capital were all a bunch of evil scumbags!

139
00:08:18,286 --> 00:08:19,976
I really appreciate all of this!

140
00:08:27,023 --> 00:08:28,016
So your plan is...

141
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,628
to make a name for yourself in the Imperial Capital.

142
00:08:30,771 --> 00:08:31,813
Is that correct?

143
00:08:31,838 --> 00:08:32,231
Right!

144
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,071
As you may know,

145
00:08:34,172 --> 00:08:36,709
the capital is a wonderful and peaceful place.

146
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:40,726
However, it is bordered by
squabbling tribes on three sides.

147
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:42,617
If you are to enlist,

148
00:08:42,703 --> 00:08:44,869
you may be expected to go and join the fight.

149
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:46,664
I'm prepared for that.

150
00:08:47,084 --> 00:08:48,515
Yes, I'm sure you are!

151
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,792
Seems you've got spirit.

152
00:08:49,817 --> 00:08:51,494
I like to see that in a young man.

153
00:08:51,621 --> 00:08:54,295
Did you come all the way here by yourself, Tatsumi?

154
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,826
No, I'm not alone.

155
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:57,628
There's three of us.

156
00:09:02,386 --> 00:09:03,779
We're gonna hit the road now, Mayor!

157
00:09:04,226 --> 00:09:08,194
Well, you three have been pushing
each other since you were just children.

158
00:09:08,353 --> 00:09:11,272
It's time to use that energy to
make something good of yourselves.

159
00:09:11,297 --> 00:09:14,102
You can count on us, sir! We'll
bring fortune back to the village.

160
00:09:14,127 --> 00:09:16,678
That's right, nobody's gonna starve on our watch!

161
00:09:17,004 --> 00:09:21,352
Give it about ten years or so, and everybody
for miles around'll know the name Ieyasu!

162
00:09:21,505 --> 00:09:24,844
Sure, as long as you don't get arrested
and have your head chopped off before then.

163
00:09:24,889 --> 00:09:27,965
Jeez, Sayo, do you always have to be so morbid?!

164
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:29,201
They're as spirited as always.

165
00:09:29,295 --> 00:09:30,884
You should try working on that!

166
00:09:31,057 --> 00:09:33,451
Oh and Tatsumi, I have something for you.

167
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,264
It's a parting gift.

168
00:09:36,174 --> 00:09:37,434
If times get tough...

169
00:09:37,654 --> 00:09:38,257
I'll sell it.

170
00:09:38,281 --> 00:09:39,562
The hell you will!

171
00:09:39,862 --> 00:09:43,074
Look just keep it on you at all times.

172
00:09:43,703 --> 00:09:46,126
It ensures God will protect you.

173
00:09:46,633 --> 00:09:48,666
Okay... Thank you very much!

174
00:09:50,576 --> 00:09:53,012
At first, it seemed like
everything was going pretty smoothly.

175
00:09:53,307 --> 00:09:55,489
But then we got attacked by bandits, and well...

176
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,017
We lost each other.

177
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,057
Ooh...

178
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:01,335
Both of them are decent fighters
at least, so I'm not too concerned.

179
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:04,864
It's just that Ieyasu still can't
navigate his way out of a paper bag.

180
00:10:04,964 --> 00:10:06,043
What was that?!

181
00:10:06,217 --> 00:10:09,244
We planned to meet each other at the
capital, but I don't think he's gonna make it.

182
00:10:09,844 --> 00:10:10,773
Then it's settled.

183
00:10:11,406 --> 00:10:14,135
I think I have a friend in the military who can help you.

184
00:10:14,345 --> 00:10:17,393
I'll give him your name, and ask
him to look for your two friends.

185
00:10:17,853 --> 00:10:18,812
That'd be great!

186
00:10:19,617 --> 00:10:21,011
Again thank you so much!

187
00:10:21,036 --> 00:10:23,269
I have an extremely keen intuition.

188
00:10:23,562 --> 00:10:26,728
So I just know you'll see your friends again very soon.

189
00:10:26,846 --> 00:10:27,914
That'd be great.

190
00:10:32,522 --> 00:10:33,846
I've been so lucky...

191
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:36,454
I ended up finding some great people to look out for me.

192
00:10:37,736 --> 00:10:39,493
Now there's just Sayo and Ieyasu.

193
00:10:40,748 --> 00:10:43,723
I hope they found their way to the capital safe and sound.

194
00:10:46,448 --> 00:10:48,650
Oh! We should go to that shop next!

195
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,074
Please wait, milady!

196
00:10:51,001 --> 00:10:54,591
Whoa, Lady Aria's a pretty serious shopper, isn't she?

197
00:10:54,998 --> 00:10:58,246
I mean, I don't think I've ever seen so much stuff before.

198
00:10:58,707 --> 00:11:02,855
The young lady does enjoy it, but I
assume all women behave this way, yes?

199
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,755
I don't know.

200
00:11:04,032 --> 00:11:07,142
I have this other female friend and
she just kinda wears whatever she has.

201
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,789
That's because I'm poor, you jerk!

202
00:11:08,814 --> 00:11:09,866
Oh, and Tatsumi...

203
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:10,333
Yeah?

204
00:11:10,358 --> 00:11:11,763
You see the castle over there?

205
00:11:11,787 --> 00:11:12,115
Huh?

206
00:11:12,483 --> 00:11:15,284
That is the center of the entire empire.

207
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:16,919
It's where everything happens.

208
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:18,004
Whoa!

209
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:21,907
I've always wanted to see where the emperor
lives and makes decisions for the whole country!

210
00:11:22,294 --> 00:11:24,444
Well... not exactly.

211
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,402
Uh...

212
00:11:26,188 --> 00:11:29,332
There is an emperor, but he's only a child.

213
00:11:29,574 --> 00:11:32,115
Our land is plagued by corruption.

214
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:34,983
It's the minister who controls
the emperor from the shadows.

215
00:11:35,007 --> 00:11:35,748
Minister?!

216
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,074
Do not let yourself be heard.

217
00:11:38,411 --> 00:11:40,684
Those who oppose are beheaded.

218
00:11:41,584 --> 00:11:45,441
So... he's the one who ordered
all those heavy taxes on my village.

219
00:11:45,466 --> 00:11:47,656
The entire capital knows.

220
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:52,922
On top of that, we're dealing with this scum.

221
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:56,856
Night Raid?

222
00:11:56,881 --> 00:11:59,818
A band of assassins terrorizing the area.

223
00:11:59,963 --> 00:12:02,920
As the name implies, they tend to attack at night.

224
00:12:03,433 --> 00:12:07,485
High-ranking officials and the upper
class make up most of their targets.

225
00:12:07,757 --> 00:12:10,619
It's only wise to be very cautious.

226
00:12:10,644 --> 00:12:11,211
Right!

227
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,048
But for the time being...

228
00:12:13,193 --> 00:12:15,017
let's do something about that.

229
00:12:16,939 --> 00:12:18,393
What'm I s'posed to do?!

230
00:12:24,675 --> 00:12:27,890
Well, well. Now I can add another entry to my diary.

231
00:12:28,643 --> 00:12:31,131
What an addicting little hobby this is!

232
00:12:33,701 --> 00:12:34,245
Ah...

233
00:12:46,427 --> 00:12:47,237
I'm sorry.

234
00:12:47,816 --> 00:12:48,231
Huh?!

235
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:50,181
What was that?

236
00:12:50,866 --> 00:12:51,527
Trouble.

237
00:12:54,662 --> 00:12:55,595
There's no way...

238
00:13:01,202 --> 00:13:01,993
It's them.

239
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:16,635
It's Night Raid.

240
00:13:19,045 --> 00:13:20,045
What do they want?

241
00:13:20,378 --> 00:13:23,355
I can only assume they've targeted
this family because they're rich.

242
00:13:24,455 --> 00:13:25,397
What do I do?

243
00:13:26,163 --> 00:13:28,960
Help the guards fight, or protect the family?

244
00:13:29,132 --> 00:13:31,340
Hey, Akame, those three guards are targets too.

245
00:13:33,795 --> 00:13:34,763
I'll take care of it.

246
00:13:38,781 --> 00:13:39,288
Woah!

247
00:13:47,463 --> 00:13:49,880
Do not let that sword touch you.

248
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,155
Let's go!

249
00:14:01,042 --> 00:14:04,799
I knew of the corruption, yet could not escape it's grasp.

250
00:14:06,514 --> 00:14:09,420
Who the hell are these monsters?! No!

251
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,815
Not much of a bodyguard, if he's gonna just run away.

252
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,513
Yeah? I think anyone would probably run from that.

253
00:14:17,793 --> 00:14:20,041
They were wiped out... in seconds...

254
00:14:21,356 --> 00:14:22,802
I have to save Miss Aria!

255
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:26,688
Please, spare me!

256
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,635
Please, I have a little girl.

257
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,353
It's okay. You won't for much longer.

258
00:14:31,466 --> 00:14:33,108
No, please don't kill her.

259
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:34,949
I beg you, have mercy on us!

260
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:36,080
"Mercy"?

261
00:14:36,564 --> 00:14:38,595
I'm not sure I'm familiar with that word.

262
00:14:42,745 --> 00:14:44,000
Hurry, Milady, this way!

263
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,626
What's happening?!

264
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,977
Just get to the shed for now, you'll be safe there!

265
00:14:48,957 --> 00:14:49,674
There you are!

266
00:14:51,905 --> 00:14:52,760
Tatsumi?

267
00:14:54,237 --> 00:14:55,638
Okay, great, you made it.

268
00:14:55,915 --> 00:14:58,029
I'll hide the young lady and wait for the guards.

269
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,340
See what you can do to stall the enemy until then.

270
00:15:00,486 --> 00:15:01,039
Got it?

271
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,192
You really expect me to take out...

272
00:15:05,753 --> 00:15:08,326
Well... Looks like it's too late to complain!

273
00:15:10,979 --> 00:15:12,188
You're not a target.

274
00:15:16,218 --> 00:15:16,857
Dammit!

275
00:15:17,853 --> 00:15:18,801
But you are.

276
00:15:24,813 --> 00:15:25,733
You're done.

277
00:15:39,847 --> 00:15:41,017
You deserve this.

278
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:42,030
Stop right there!

279
00:15:44,438 --> 00:15:46,147
I told you, you're not a target.

280
00:15:46,515 --> 00:15:47,858
You don't have to die.

281
00:15:47,883 --> 00:15:50,160
Yeah? Well, I can't let you murder a helpless little girl.

282
00:15:50,185 --> 00:15:50,945
Mm-hm.

283
00:15:50,969 --> 00:15:51,403
Uh...

284
00:15:52,127 --> 00:15:53,702
So you won't step aside?

285
00:15:53,727 --> 00:15:55,226
Well, I'm not gonna back down now!

286
00:15:56,104 --> 00:15:58,219
Hmmph. Then you've made your choice.

287
00:15:59,174 --> 00:16:01,035
Ahhh, that was easy!

288
00:16:03,065 --> 00:16:03,944
That's weird.

289
00:16:04,092 --> 00:16:06,074
It's not like Akame to take this long.

290
00:16:06,761 --> 00:16:07,740
Wait, what?!

291
00:16:08,223 --> 00:16:09,514
Ah, jeez.

292
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,426
That poor guy can't catch a break can he?

293
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,468
She's better than me.

294
00:16:16,067 --> 00:16:17,811
I don't stand a chance against her.

295
00:16:18,893 --> 00:16:20,540
But I don't have time to worry about that.

296
00:16:21,069 --> 00:16:22,537
If I can't save one girl,

297
00:16:22,868 --> 00:16:25,502
how can I possibly expect to save my entire village?

298
00:16:33,607 --> 00:16:34,310
What the...

299
00:16:37,949 --> 00:16:38,901
Tatsumi!

300
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,344
Why'd you back off all of a sudden?

301
00:16:49,489 --> 00:16:52,044
Because it felt like I hit some kind of armor.

302
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,954
I guess the villagers were looking out for me after all.

303
00:16:56,493 --> 00:16:57,433
Well now...

304
00:16:57,739 --> 00:17:00,550
He's lasted quite a while in a fight against Akame.

305
00:17:01,202 --> 00:17:02,570
He must be pretty decent.

306
00:17:04,326 --> 00:17:05,470
She must die.

307
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:09,562
Hey, wait a minute, lady, you just said you
wanted to steal this girl's money, don't you?!

308
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:10,789
You don't have to kill her!

309
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:13,490
This isn't a war; There's no
reason to kill innocent people!

310
00:17:13,675 --> 00:17:14,497
Please!

311
00:17:15,043 --> 00:17:16,883
I don't think she's listening to me.

312
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,401
What are you doing?

313
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,080
We've got some time left.

314
00:17:25,382 --> 00:17:27,308
And I kinda owe this guy a favor.

315
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:29,985
I'm pretty sure he'd like to cash it in now.

316
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,669
Hey, you're that girl with the boobs!

317
00:17:34,117 --> 00:17:35,764
Yep, that's what they call me!

318
00:17:37,021 --> 00:17:40,231
Listen, earlier you were concerned
we were here to kill innocent people.

319
00:17:40,891 --> 00:17:44,507
I think you might see things differently
when you find out what's behind that door.

320
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,854
Here it is.

321
00:17:49,304 --> 00:17:50,808
Welcome to the capital, kid.

322
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,366
What... is all this?

323
00:17:57,238 --> 00:18:01,293
We learned that they fancied picking up
out-of-town newcomers from the countryside,

324
00:18:01,318 --> 00:18:04,804
and then torture them to death for
their own sick, twisted entertainment.

325
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:08,776
That's the reality of this "poor,
innocent, happy little family".

326
00:18:10,225 --> 00:18:11,104
Sayo...

327
00:18:12,139 --> 00:18:15,338
No... that's... that's Sayo...

328
00:18:15,363 --> 00:18:17,007
Do you know who that girl is?

329
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:20,068
Oopsy!

330
00:18:20,245 --> 00:18:23,432
You didn't really think we were through
with you yet, did you, sweetie pie?

331
00:18:23,457 --> 00:18:24,946
These people really did this?

332
00:18:25,715 --> 00:18:29,075
Yes, they did, and their guards are
just as guilty for keeping it hidden.

333
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:29,953
She's lying!

334
00:18:30,005 --> 00:18:32,555
I had no idea anything like that was going on!

335
00:18:32,724 --> 00:18:33,912
Who would you believe?

336
00:18:34,045 --> 00:18:35,725
These... these murderers,

337
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:37,475
or the one who saved you?!

338
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,307
Tatsumi?

339
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,681
Is that... Is it you?

340
00:18:42,631 --> 00:18:43,425
It's me...

341
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,293
Ieyasu?!

342
00:18:46,948 --> 00:18:49,164
She invited us to stay at her house.

343
00:18:49,717 --> 00:18:53,250
She gave us something to eat,
and then everything went black.

344
00:18:53,656 --> 00:18:54,753
Then we woke up here...

345
00:18:55,436 --> 00:18:57,374
And... and then that girl...

346
00:18:57,556 --> 00:18:59,889
That girl tortured Sayo to death!

347
00:19:02,973 --> 00:19:05,163
Fine, fine so I did it, okay?!

348
00:19:06,056 --> 00:19:08,617
These trash are just worthless filth.

349
00:19:08,738 --> 00:19:12,430
They're nothing but, but...
livestock for me to use as I see fit!

350
00:19:12,683 --> 00:19:15,926
Garbage like her doesn't have
the right to such beautiful hair.

351
00:19:16,016 --> 00:19:19,926
Mine is always giving me trouble,
so I treated her extra special!

352
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:22,300
She should be honored that I gave her so much attention!

353
00:19:22,405 --> 00:19:24,326
Ungrateful pig!

354
00:19:24,351 --> 00:19:27,239
Sorry honey, I don't mean to
interrupt your little tantrum here.

355
00:19:28,099 --> 00:19:29,854
But you are kind of disturbing.

356
00:19:30,364 --> 00:19:31,232
I'll kill her.

357
00:19:31,306 --> 00:19:31,749
Wait.

358
00:19:32,897 --> 00:19:35,152
You're kidding? You're still going to defend her?

359
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,145
No.

360
00:19:36,944 --> 00:19:37,998
I'll do it!

361
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,021
Hmm... Well, that was quick.

362
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,194
He didn't even hesitate.

363
00:19:58,007 --> 00:19:59,671
Granted, she was pretty heinous.

364
00:20:00,835 --> 00:20:02,076
Thank you, Tatsumi...

365
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:03,617
I needed to see that...

366
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:06,159
Ieyasu!

367
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:09,000
No...

368
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:10,866
It's the Lebola virus.

369
00:20:11,221 --> 00:20:14,299
The mother enjoyed poisoning
people with different medicines.

370
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:17,464
She even kept a diary detailing each victim's reactions.

371
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:19,626
It's too late for him.

372
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:21,831
Tatsumi...

373
00:20:22,396 --> 00:20:23,202
Ieyasu!

374
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:24,466
You should know...

375
00:20:24,764 --> 00:20:26,401
that Sayo never did break...

376
00:20:26,455 --> 00:20:28,186
She never let herself give in...

377
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,652
She was incredible...

378
00:20:31,432 --> 00:20:33,176
So, I wanted to...

379
00:20:34,047 --> 00:20:36,226
to go out a hero...

380
00:20:38,749 --> 00:20:41,950
His strong will was the only thing that kept him alive.

381
00:20:43,295 --> 00:20:45,252
What the hell is wrong with this place?!

382
00:20:46,908 --> 00:20:47,640
Let's go.

383
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:48,540
Hey.

384
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,204
Don't you think we should bring him with us?

385
00:20:51,828 --> 00:20:52,346
Hmm?

386
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:55,189
We could use an extra pair of hands.

387
00:20:55,356 --> 00:20:57,908
Plus he seems to have potential
and a little luck on his side.

388
00:20:57,933 --> 00:20:59,321
Wait! I need to bury my friends!

389
00:20:59,448 --> 00:21:02,867
Oh, if you want, I can take the
bodies back to the hideout later, okay?

390
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:04,674
Just relax!

391
00:21:04,698 --> 00:21:05,328
I told you, I need to bury my friends!

392
00:21:05,372 --> 00:21:07,737
You're late! What took you so long?

393
00:21:07,977 --> 00:21:09,156
And who's this guy?

394
00:21:09,482 --> 00:21:10,449
A new recruit!

395
00:21:10,474 --> 00:21:10,884
Huh?

396
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:13,004
Oh, yeah, I forgot to tell you.

397
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,250
Starting today, you're part of the team!

398
00:21:16,704 --> 00:21:20,003
Congratulations, you just joined the Night Raid!

399
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,948
Wait, don't I get a say in this?!

400
00:21:22,979 --> 00:21:23,826
Just give up.

401
00:21:24,099 --> 00:21:25,701
Leone always gets her way.

402
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:28,877
Look at that, my best friend knows how it works!

403
00:21:29,197 --> 00:21:31,017
Bulat, he's all yours.

404
00:21:32,139 --> 00:21:33,087
Put me down!

405
00:21:33,112 --> 00:21:34,535
I don't wanna murder people!

406
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,504
Aww! It gets easier.

407
00:21:36,604 --> 00:21:38,353
Huh? What does?

408
00:21:38,533 --> 00:21:40,116
The mission is now complete.

409
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,176
We're heading back.

410
00:21:44,879 --> 00:21:47,148
Huh?! Where are we going?!

411
00:21:50,751 --> 00:21:53,748
Awww, how did I get myself into this?!
