1
00:00:09,351 --> 00:00:12,551
But why? Why would you allow them to die just to save me?

2
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:14,231
Get over yourself.

3
00:00:16,194 --> 00:00:20,911
If we hadn't stopped that execution it would've
seriously damaged the Revolutionary Army's morale.

4
00:00:21,477 --> 00:00:24,490
Besides, everyone participated of their own free will.

5
00:00:24,515 --> 00:00:25,957
Yeah, well that's not the point.

6
00:00:27,137 --> 00:00:32,500
Furthermore... we managed to eliminate a
long-standing obstacle when we killed Great General Budo.

7
00:00:32,951 --> 00:00:34,718
We've gained a lot from this mission.

8
00:00:34,908 --> 00:00:36,519
Is that all that matters to you?!

9
00:00:36,552 --> 00:00:40,241
Tatsumi, you do realize this whole
thing's been hard on the Boss too, right?

10
00:00:40,451 --> 00:00:41,778
She lost Susanoo.

11
00:00:42,318 --> 00:00:43,488
These things happen.

12
00:00:43,597 --> 00:00:46,150
It was doing its job as a weapon, that's all.

13
00:00:47,918 --> 00:00:48,909
Poor Su.

14
00:00:50,099 --> 00:00:52,258
As the living it is our responsibility

15
00:00:52,363 --> 00:00:54,840
to carry out the wishes of the ones who are gone.

16
00:00:55,477 --> 00:00:56,851
I don't know if I can.

17
00:00:57,166 --> 00:01:01,307
It may be heavy, but it's a burden
that none of us have the right to abandon.

18
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:02,798
Akame...

19
00:01:03,191 --> 00:01:05,185
In other words, if we quit now...

20
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:07,910
then all the dead will have died for nothing!

21
00:01:09,477 --> 00:01:10,375
Yeah, you're right!

22
00:01:12,151 --> 00:01:14,719
I guess somebody has to put an end to all this sadness.

23
00:01:24,816 --> 00:01:29,055
In order to use his trump card,
Susanoo needed to take my life.

24
00:01:29,668 --> 00:01:31,001
But I'm still here...

25
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:37,137
Susanoo, did you burn through your
own life energy to keep from killing me?

26
00:01:42,806 --> 00:01:45,456
You were never just an Imperial Arms.

27
00:01:45,825 --> 00:01:49,273
You were an irreplaceable... companion.

28
00:01:54,367 --> 00:01:57,120
Do you... remember what you told me?

29
00:01:58,428 --> 00:02:01,991
You said that you were gonna make something
of your life and rid this world of intolerance.

30
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,700
I'll do it, Mine.

31
00:02:05,741 --> 00:02:07,168
I'll make your wish come true.

32
00:02:09,058 --> 00:02:09,894
I promise.

33
00:03:48,472 --> 00:03:49,206
Lemme go!

34
00:03:49,278 --> 00:03:51,987
Keep up this rebellious crap
and I'll put you under arrest!

35
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:55,541
This place is a joke; Can't you
see it's falling apart around us!

36
00:03:55,662 --> 00:03:56,454
What was that?!

37
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:57,644
No! Don't!

38
00:03:58,212 --> 00:03:59,091
Hm...

39
00:03:59,897 --> 00:04:00,321
Hmph!

40
00:04:01,525 --> 00:04:03,623
How much longer do we have to put up with this?!

41
00:04:04,156 --> 00:04:05,479
It'll be over soon.

42
00:04:05,654 --> 00:04:07,423
The Empire's on its way down.

43
00:04:07,777 --> 00:04:11,544
Most of the people we were supposed to
protect are now siding with the Revolution.

44
00:04:12,136 --> 00:04:14,191
Is there still a place for us here anymore?

45
00:04:14,718 --> 00:04:16,147
Try to stay calm.

46
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,864
The chaos probably won't stop even after the revolution.

47
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:23,477
And when the time comes, the
people are going to need our help.

48
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:26,219
It kinda sounds like you knew this would happen.

49
00:04:27,348 --> 00:04:29,729
Well, it came a little earlier than I thought it would.

50
00:04:29,754 --> 00:04:30,241
Huh?

51
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,954
I was desperately hoping for reform.

52
00:04:33,005 --> 00:04:37,229
That's why I joined the Jaegers, to try to
make a difference in this nation from the inside.

53
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,846
To make a difference?

54
00:04:39,324 --> 00:04:41,399
This Empire has become corrupt.

55
00:04:41,792 --> 00:04:44,872
That said, I think this kind of rebellion is unacceptable.

56
00:04:45,205 --> 00:04:47,595
So you chose to work under General Esdeath.

57
00:04:48,074 --> 00:04:48,607
Yes.

58
00:04:49,325 --> 00:04:51,398
I actually find her quite fascinating.

59
00:04:51,593 --> 00:04:53,299
You are a strange guy y'know that.

60
00:04:53,373 --> 00:04:55,040
Hm... I get that a lot.

61
00:04:55,609 --> 00:05:00,113
Y'know my initial intention for joining was
to rise up in the ranks, but I got sidetracked.

62
00:05:00,176 --> 00:05:03,437
Because I've enjoyed my time with everyone here so much.

63
00:05:07,591 --> 00:05:10,382
Speaking of which, Kurome, what are you planning on doing?

64
00:05:10,755 --> 00:05:12,746
Since you've got one foot in the grave.

65
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:16,372
Huh? Wait a minute, how did you find out about Kurome?!

66
00:05:16,753 --> 00:05:18,793
You shouldn't be all that surprised, Wave.

67
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,674
It's obvious by the way you've been acting.

68
00:05:21,835 --> 00:05:22,355
Ah!

69
00:05:25,022 --> 00:05:29,712
At this point, you could probably be free from
the Jaegers without becoming a target, yourself.

70
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,000
Be free?

71
00:05:31,836 --> 00:05:32,442
Yes.

72
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:35,742
I don't have any need for a brief taste of freedom.

73
00:05:36,563 --> 00:05:39,169
There's only one thing I care about in this world.

74
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,080
Now this is the kind of battle I enjoy the most!

75
00:05:47,443 --> 00:05:53,193
If any of you neophytes are unsatisfied with
your destiny, I invite you to put me in my place!

76
00:05:53,224 --> 00:05:54,826
You can go to Hell!

77
00:05:54,851 --> 00:05:57,799
As soon as you're dead this corrupt nation is finished!

78
00:05:58,345 --> 00:06:00,240
Oh, an Imperial Arms?

79
00:06:00,265 --> 00:06:01,127
How cute.

80
00:06:10,921 --> 00:06:14,281
Is there not a single one of you who can challenge me?

81
00:06:16,357 --> 00:06:19,792
Tatsumi escaped certain death against unbelievable odds.

82
00:06:20,192 --> 00:06:22,105
We're simply meant to be together.

83
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,146
Wait for me, my love.

84
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:27,647
I'm coming for you.

85
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,638
Once I've cleaned up this mess.

86
00:06:32,951 --> 00:06:35,627
The Imperial Capital is almost completely surrounded now!

87
00:06:35,733 --> 00:06:37,366
What the hell is going on out there?!

88
00:06:37,391 --> 00:06:42,117
Not even General Esdeath is capable of leading
an army in every direction at the same time!

89
00:06:42,723 --> 00:06:43,760
Your Highness!

90
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:48,402
The Empire is crumbling under our reign...

91
00:06:49,417 --> 00:06:51,298
have we not been good rulers?

92
00:06:51,323 --> 00:06:54,335
There's nothing wrong with your rule, Your Majesty.

93
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,092
Oh, Minister Honest!

94
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:59,164
You idiots should be more supportive.

95
00:06:59,447 --> 00:07:02,112
They've let their fear get the best of them.

96
00:07:02,537 --> 00:07:07,563
I hate to say it, but I am painfully
aware of your feelings on this matter.

97
00:07:07,588 --> 00:07:09,532
These men are fools!

98
00:07:09,557 --> 00:07:14,380
They don't understand all the strides
you've taken to keep our land peaceful.

99
00:07:14,487 --> 00:07:17,266
The citizens have started to rebel against us.

100
00:07:17,406 --> 00:07:19,132
Please tell me what we should do!

101
00:07:19,157 --> 00:07:25,202
There comes a time when a nation's ruler is
called to show his leadership with an iron fist.

102
00:07:25,295 --> 00:07:28,662
You must make your authority known to your people!

103
00:07:28,735 --> 00:07:30,640
Show your strength!

104
00:07:30,665 --> 00:07:32,513
Huh? It couldn't be...

105
00:07:33,473 --> 00:07:37,207
Now they'll see the Emperor's power...

106
00:07:41,982 --> 00:07:44,140
I don't... have much time.

107
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:49,168
So... let's finish this... Big Sister.

108
00:07:51,034 --> 00:07:52,829
Revolutionary spies.

109
00:07:52,976 --> 00:07:54,629
I take it this is a warning.

110
00:07:55,315 --> 00:07:57,063
I cannot believe what I'm seeing.

111
00:07:59,822 --> 00:08:02,037
Huh?! It's a message for me.

112
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:04,241
Huh? It's a message?

113
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,638
I'm being challenged to a duel.

114
00:08:06,758 --> 00:08:08,478
Uh? What does it say?

115
00:08:09,466 --> 00:08:12,231
"Come to the Kadai Forest Institution ruins."

116
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:15,149
This is stupid! You know it's a trap!

117
00:08:15,575 --> 00:08:18,734
If it was a trap they wouldn't
have waited this long to come for me.

118
00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:20,596
It's a personal grudge.

119
00:08:21,181 --> 00:08:23,056
A grudge? Then who is it?

120
00:08:24,028 --> 00:08:26,641
Kurome's ready to settle things between us.

121
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:27,136
Uh!

122
00:08:27,993 --> 00:08:29,546
Does it have to be right now?

123
00:08:29,571 --> 00:08:31,899
Is this fight really all that important to you two?

124
00:08:32,515 --> 00:08:33,132
Mm-hm.

125
00:08:33,407 --> 00:08:37,460
Akame I'm sure you know that the lives of
thousands of people are resting on our shoulders!

126
00:08:37,622 --> 00:08:40,384
How can you put this personal
vendetta over everything else?

127
00:08:40,823 --> 00:08:42,879
That's exactly why I have to do this.

128
00:08:43,455 --> 00:08:46,171
No matter what, I can't ignore Kurome's feelings.

129
00:08:46,729 --> 00:08:47,879
She's the enemy.

130
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,594
She's my sister. Hm.

131
00:08:50,922 --> 00:08:53,942
I'm the only person she knows who can truly understand...

132
00:08:54,689 --> 00:08:55,788
what she's going through.

133
00:08:58,255 --> 00:08:59,312
If you say so.

134
00:08:59,703 --> 00:09:00,780
But I'm coming too.

135
00:09:01,182 --> 00:09:01,999
You can't.

136
00:09:02,024 --> 00:09:05,649
The revolution is going to need every
bit of your strength for the final siege.

137
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,413
Do not forget what your mission is.

138
00:09:07,438 --> 00:09:10,046
Okay fine, but promise me you'll come back alive.

139
00:09:11,349 --> 00:09:12,649
Tatsumi, please.

140
00:09:12,856 --> 00:09:14,478
That's what you're always telling me to do.

141
00:09:15,223 --> 00:09:17,170
So I expect the same thing from you.

142
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:22,484
Fine... you have my word.

143
00:09:53,664 --> 00:09:54,910
I knew you'd show up...

144
00:09:55,635 --> 00:09:56,443
Akame.

145
00:09:59,723 --> 00:10:00,767
Hello Kurome.

146
00:10:02,588 --> 00:10:03,690
You wanna snack?

147
00:10:04,388 --> 00:10:04,845
Hm.

148
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:20,427
You remember this place, don't you?
This isn't the first time we've met here.

149
00:10:21,728 --> 00:10:23,095
It's also the place...

150
00:10:23,343 --> 00:10:24,959
where you turned your back on us.

151
00:10:26,563 --> 00:10:29,067
Seems like the perfect place for me to kill you.

152
00:10:30,535 --> 00:10:32,019
It sure takes me back.

153
00:10:32,676 --> 00:10:36,129
No matter what happened to us, you were
always right there looking out for me.

154
00:10:37,249 --> 00:10:39,384
We didn't have anyone but each other,

155
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:42,314
and this was the only place we felt needed.

156
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,457
They trained us to be assassins for the Empire.

157
00:10:46,997 --> 00:10:50,647
We learned to stop uprisings before they started.

158
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:54,259
That was the way we were taught to protect the peace.

159
00:10:56,269 --> 00:11:00,838
Under orders, we learned to kill
anyone who might be a threat to the Empire.

160
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:06,549
As far as we knew, we were doing the right thing.

161
00:11:09,275 --> 00:11:11,155
Big Sister! Haha!

162
00:11:12,434 --> 00:11:13,167
Kurome.

163
00:11:13,762 --> 00:11:15,007
I missed you.

164
00:11:18,043 --> 00:11:20,523
After being raised in two different squads,

165
00:11:20,696 --> 00:11:23,115
we finally got the chance to be together again.

166
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,654
You came as a replacement for someone who'd been killed.

167
00:11:29,196 --> 00:11:31,662
After that, the two of us were inseparable...

168
00:11:32,075 --> 00:11:34,983
like we were trying to make up
for all the time we'd been apart.

169
00:11:36,755 --> 00:11:38,367
We were the ultimate team.

170
00:11:39,756 --> 00:11:43,269
Some of our missions were difficult,
but I made it through because I had you.

171
00:11:44,415 --> 00:11:47,047
If you were with me, I was happy.

172
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,565
But... then...

173
00:11:56,663 --> 00:12:00,035
But then you betrayed the Empire and joined Night Raid.

174
00:12:00,947 --> 00:12:04,470
Why?! I tried so hard to stop you!

175
00:12:07,772 --> 00:12:11,619
Being abandoned by my own sister absolutely crushed me.

176
00:12:11,885 --> 00:12:16,412
Every day since you left, I've been
imagining more and more ways to kill you.

177
00:12:16,443 --> 00:12:18,600
Is killing me gonna solve your problems?

178
00:12:18,634 --> 00:12:20,467
There is no solution.

179
00:12:20,492 --> 00:12:22,322
However, if I kill you...

180
00:12:22,715 --> 00:12:25,496
then you can be beside me for all eternity.

181
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:32,175
Using an Imperial Arms is very strenuous.

182
00:12:32,912 --> 00:12:35,061
It must be unbearable when you're so weak.

183
00:12:35,685 --> 00:12:37,007
I can end your suffering.

184
00:12:37,032 --> 00:12:42,006
Haha! Sister, it's time for us to fight... to the death.

185
00:12:44,604 --> 00:12:45,570
Kurome.

186
00:12:47,277 --> 00:12:48,583
I guess she's gone.

187
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,440
She needed to take care of some unfinished business.

188
00:12:53,275 --> 00:12:55,812
Why would she leave without saying anything about it?

189
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,934
If she'd said something, you would have tried to stop her.

190
00:13:01,231 --> 00:13:03,359
Do you have any idea where she could've gone?

191
00:13:03,388 --> 00:13:05,454
Maybe a place that's important to the two of them?

192
00:13:27,989 --> 00:13:30,478
Why did you have to leave and betray the squad?

193
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:33,612
Everything would have been fine
between us if you hadn't run away!

194
00:13:33,637 --> 00:13:36,072
I learned a lot about life from going on my own.

195
00:13:36,257 --> 00:13:39,261
And I realized that we were never
fighting for the good of the nation!

196
00:13:40,242 --> 00:13:42,439
We were only doing the Empire's dirty work!

197
00:13:42,732 --> 00:13:44,496
Murdering people without question!

198
00:13:45,309 --> 00:13:48,639
The way things stand, no good is
ever going to come from this government.

199
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,616
It's why I wanted you to leave with me.

200
00:13:51,641 --> 00:13:56,437
How could you expect me to do that when so many
others were forced to die for the sake of their missions?!

201
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,187
All that sadness was caused by the leaders of the Empire!

202
00:13:59,212 --> 00:14:03,861
If we can bring happiness to people by overthrowing
the leadership, I know our comrades would understand!

203
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:05,634
That's a selfish excuse!

204
00:14:09,397 --> 00:14:09,918
Huh?

205
00:14:22,052 --> 00:14:23,066
Danger Beast.

206
00:14:23,272 --> 00:14:26,594
It must've come out of hiding
when it sensed our desire to fight!

207
00:14:30,528 --> 00:14:31,245
Kurome!

208
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:31,822
Ah!

209
00:14:35,471 --> 00:14:36,202
Natara!

210
00:14:39,551 --> 00:14:41,792
You will pay for hurting my friends!

211
00:14:42,597 --> 00:14:43,249
Doya!

212
00:14:49,547 --> 00:14:50,261
No!

213
00:14:52,076 --> 00:14:53,442
Alright that's it!

214
00:14:53,469 --> 00:14:56,052
I don't have any more time to waste on you!

215
00:15:06,485 --> 00:15:08,587
That was really close. Are you okay?

216
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,341
Akame.

217
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:14,157
Let's go get him.

218
00:15:15,403 --> 00:15:15,963
Hm.

219
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:35,839
You're done!

220
00:15:47,998 --> 00:15:50,484
Looks like you and I still have what it takes.

221
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:54,492
The two of us always were pretty good at this weren't we?

222
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,907
You remember don't you, Big Sister?!

223
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,890
Haha...

224
00:16:07,514 --> 00:16:08,437
Get her!

225
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:24,908
I should've known my pawns couldn't handle it.

226
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:28,467
This battle... IS OVER!

227
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,118
I won't let you hurt Kurome!

228
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:37,604
Wave?!

229
00:16:37,681 --> 00:16:39,868
C'mon, Night Raid, I'm your target now!

230
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:43,011
What the?!

231
00:16:46,293 --> 00:16:47,334
Move, Tatsumi!

232
00:16:47,421 --> 00:16:48,337
You move, Wave!

233
00:16:48,362 --> 00:16:48,879
Huh?

234
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:53,115
But you're my teammate; I can't just walk away from you!

235
00:16:53,661 --> 00:16:55,096
But I want you to.

236
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:56,820
Kurome...

237
00:16:57,233 --> 00:16:59,158
What are you doing here, Tatsumi?!

238
00:16:59,371 --> 00:17:01,811
I came to make sure no one interferes with your fight.

239
00:17:02,297 --> 00:17:02,737
Huh?

240
00:17:03,597 --> 00:17:04,037
Hm.

241
00:17:05,097 --> 00:17:07,569
Tatsumi, we don't have time for this!

242
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:08,967
I wish I could stop them too!

243
00:17:09,147 --> 00:17:12,254
But if I did that, then they'd never
be able to finally sort this thing out!

244
00:17:12,306 --> 00:17:15,186
Is this how Night Raid assassins
settle their differences?!

245
00:17:15,858 --> 00:17:17,469
I cannot allow it to happen!

246
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:19,029
This a matter of the heart!

247
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:24,049
Sometimes there are problems that can only
be solved by yourself... without any help!

248
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:30,467
A matter of the heart?

249
00:17:37,847 --> 00:17:38,380
I...

250
00:17:41,473 --> 00:17:42,100
Wave.

251
00:17:46,873 --> 00:17:48,540
Thank you for coming to help me.

252
00:17:49,606 --> 00:17:53,531
Maybe if things had gone differently... The
two of us could've been friends or something.

253
00:17:56,859 --> 00:17:57,796
But Kurome...

254
00:17:58,397 --> 00:18:03,102
It's time for us to finally deal with all
the regret and pain we've had for so long.

255
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,297
It's time to end this.

256
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,436
Are you ready? Let's go.

257
00:18:17,828 --> 00:18:20,765
Kurome... my little sister.

258
00:18:22,407 --> 00:18:22,960
Mmhmm.

259
00:18:24,073 --> 00:18:26,284
You know I've always loved you, Big Sister.

260
00:19:17,806 --> 00:19:21,310
This couldn't be the only way for
them to resolve their differences.

261
00:19:24,478 --> 00:19:26,078
I wasn't able to help her...

262
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:28,181
I couldn't do anything to stop it!

263
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:31,668
You came to look after my little sister.

264
00:19:33,012 --> 00:19:33,848
That's enough.

265
00:19:40,397 --> 00:19:43,003
No... no...

266
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:45,349
Damn it!

267
00:19:51,328 --> 00:19:52,526
I don't understand.

268
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,067
I don't know why...

269
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:56,115
why we're even fighting each other anymore.

270
00:19:56,512 --> 00:19:59,938
If you can't find a reason to
fight then you shouldn't be fighting.

271
00:20:00,713 --> 00:20:05,910
Only those who fully comprehend the
implications of war can be capable of bearing arms.

272
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:07,469
Implications?

273
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:10,247
You'll bear this weight for the rest of your life.

274
00:20:26,598 --> 00:20:27,305
Akame!

275
00:20:28,672 --> 00:20:30,468
Didn't I tell you to stay back?

276
00:20:31,493 --> 00:20:32,985
Yeah, maybe during the fight.

277
00:20:33,425 --> 00:20:37,222
But you never said anything about coming to
take care of an injured companion, now did you?

278
00:20:37,298 --> 00:20:37,765
Huh?

279
00:20:41,399 --> 00:20:44,020
I've said goodbye to so many of my friends along the way.

280
00:20:45,252 --> 00:20:46,175
But that's nothing...

281
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,145
compared to all the loss you've
been through your whole life.

282
00:20:49,678 --> 00:20:51,922
I couldn't even begin to comprehend your pain.

283
00:20:51,947 --> 00:20:52,495
Huh!

284
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:54,783
Akame...

285
00:20:55,239 --> 00:20:57,309
you're not gonna lose any more loved ones.

286
00:20:57,745 --> 00:20:58,537
Ever again.

287
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,698
I'm so pleased you came to this decision!

288
00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:31,257
What a wise ruler you are!

289
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:37,583
Now, open your Imperial Arms passed
down through generations of royalty!

290
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:42,228
Those insufferable revolutionaries...
as well as the brainless masses...

291
00:21:42,253 --> 00:21:44,883
soon they'll know your supremacy!

292
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,006
This is our Empire.

293
00:21:48,486 --> 00:21:52,288
We must use our powers to defend this land.
