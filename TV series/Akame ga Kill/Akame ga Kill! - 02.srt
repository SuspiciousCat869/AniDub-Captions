1
00:00:02,226 --> 00:00:05,635
Let's make a pact, that when we die, we die together!

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,223
We're gonna be leaders in the Imperial Capital!

3
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:11,542
And make enough money to save
the village! We'll be heroes!

4
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:13,771
So much for that.

5
00:00:16,714 --> 00:00:18,110
Now I'm out here all alone.

6
00:00:20,622 --> 00:00:21,095
Huh?

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,197
Hehehe...

8
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:24,637
Whoa! Don't sneak up on me like that!

9
00:00:24,952 --> 00:00:27,411
So, have you decided to officially join yet?

10
00:00:27,436 --> 00:00:28,495
I told you guys...

11
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,659
You really do have the makings of an assassin, you know!

12
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:35,158
It's not a matter of whether or
not I'd be good at it, alright.

13
00:00:35,915 --> 00:00:37,890
I just don't... wanna kill people.

14
00:00:38,713 --> 00:00:40,846
Well, I'm gonna introduce you to the guys anyway!

15
00:00:40,871 --> 00:00:41,482
My neck!

16
00:02:23,107 --> 00:02:27,106
Oh? He still doesn't want to be part of
the team in spite of all that's happened?

17
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,572
He's a bit hesitant.

18
00:02:29,046 --> 00:02:32,490
So I was hoping maybe you could give
him a few words of encouragement, okay?

19
00:02:32,633 --> 00:02:33,337
Hmm...

20
00:02:33,899 --> 00:02:36,541
Well, since we showed you the location of our hideout...

21
00:02:36,712 --> 00:02:39,258
if we can't convince you to
join the team, then you'll be dead.

22
00:02:39,283 --> 00:02:41,798
Uh, is that supposed to be encouragement or a threat?

23
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,206
Just give it plenty of thought, okay?

24
00:02:44,386 --> 00:02:47,061
Huh? "Mend Your Airheaded Ways"?

25
00:02:47,748 --> 00:02:50,048
Oh my god these guys are a bunch of circus freaks.

26
00:02:50,073 --> 00:02:51,219
What the hell?

27
00:02:51,244 --> 00:02:51,599
Hmm?

28
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:55,754
Leone! Why'd you bring this loser back to the hideout?

29
00:02:55,986 --> 00:02:57,178
He's one of us now.

30
00:02:57,293 --> 00:02:59,810
And did no one think to ask for my opinion?

31
00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:01,394
Uh... Okay.

32
00:03:03,546 --> 00:03:04,782
I won't allow it.

33
00:03:05,092 --> 00:03:08,783
It's obvious you're not cut from the same
professional cloth as the rest of the group.

34
00:03:09,386 --> 00:03:10,731
I mean, just look at you.

35
00:03:11,284 --> 00:03:12,833
What's that supposed to mean?!

36
00:03:13,286 --> 00:03:16,923
Aw, don't let it get to you;
That's Mine's way of saying hello.

37
00:03:16,948 --> 00:03:17,363
Hmph!

38
00:03:18,473 --> 00:03:21,146
This is our practice field
where we go to let off some steam.

39
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:25,081
Oh! And look who's already out
here trying to work up a sweat.

40
00:03:25,645 --> 00:03:26,689
That's Bulat.

41
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:27,941
Hyaaaaa!

42
00:03:27,966 --> 00:03:30,838
Incredible. He's really good with that spear.

43
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:33,051
Oh...

44
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:35,773
Oh...

45
00:03:40,373 --> 00:03:42,515
Hey! Oh!

46
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,950
Aren't you the fella we picked up the other day?

47
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,952
Wait, how do you know about that?

48
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:51,140
Huh? Oh... I should've known you
wouldn't recognize me like this.

49
00:03:51,382 --> 00:03:53,601
I was wearing my armor the first time we met.

50
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,178
Uh... Oh!

51
00:03:55,279 --> 00:03:57,313
Name's Bulat. Pleasure's mine.

52
00:03:57,338 --> 00:03:58,919
Uh... hi there.

53
00:03:59,813 --> 00:04:01,243
And yes he's gay.

54
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,470
Geh! Haha...

55
00:04:02,933 --> 00:04:04,715
Now don't give him the wrong idea...

56
00:04:05,113 --> 00:04:06,082
Yet.

57
00:04:06,285 --> 00:04:08,599
I can think of a lot of wrong ideas.

58
00:04:08,973 --> 00:04:13,624
Hehe... It's almost time for Leone's bath.

59
00:04:14,256 --> 00:04:17,680
I'd do just about anything for a
sneak peek at that smokin' hot body!

60
00:04:17,705 --> 00:04:18,631
In that case...

61
00:04:18,656 --> 00:04:19,079
Huh?

62
00:04:19,104 --> 00:04:21,182
How about you give up two fingers?

63
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,372
You never learn, do you?

64
00:04:26,397 --> 00:04:28,408
Owowowowow!

65
00:04:28,446 --> 00:04:30,066
Next time I'll break your arm.

66
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:31,195
Owww!

67
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,991
This is Lubbock. As you can see, he's an idiot.

68
00:04:35,307 --> 00:04:37,114
Let's see, who's next?

69
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:38,809
I don't know how many more I can take.

70
00:04:38,834 --> 00:04:42,335
Hehe. The next one's a cutie, so try not to stare.

71
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,943
She's stuffing her face over there by the fire.

72
00:04:45,197 --> 00:04:46,230
Hey, Akame!

73
00:04:48,084 --> 00:04:48,466
Hm?

74
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:49,903
And there's this freak!

75
00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:53,078
I'm just now realizing she's eating a giant bird.

76
00:04:53,246 --> 00:04:54,818
Did she kill that thing herself?!

77
00:04:54,843 --> 00:04:56,982
Akame's our resident wild child.

78
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,702
Leone, have some.

79
00:04:58,727 --> 00:05:00,778
Huh? Thanks!

80
00:05:03,313 --> 00:05:05,260
Well? Have you joined us yet?

81
00:05:05,285 --> 00:05:08,614
Uh, no...

82
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,815
Then I'm sorry but I won't be
sharing any of my dinner with you.

83
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,713
I'm okay with that!

84
00:05:14,053 --> 00:05:16,232
This chick's already tried to kill me twice.

85
00:05:16,373 --> 00:05:17,505
I'd better watch out for her.

86
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,764
Is it just me or is everyone
a little extra jacked up today?

87
00:05:21,104 --> 00:05:22,766
That's 'cause the boss is back.

88
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,639
Uh? The boss?

89
00:05:26,705 --> 00:05:27,591
Boss!

90
00:05:27,615 --> 00:05:28,205
Hey!

91
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,897
Welcome back! Did you bring me anything good?

92
00:05:30,922 --> 00:05:32,398
Now why would I do that?

93
00:05:32,873 --> 00:05:35,088
About one of your most recent assignments...

94
00:05:35,141 --> 00:05:37,607
I was told you completed it three days overdue.

95
00:05:37,641 --> 00:05:39,018
Ah, crap!

96
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:47,636
When facing a powerful opponent,
it's unwise to get caught up in the fun.

97
00:05:47,706 --> 00:05:49,715
Shouldn't you know better than that by now?

98
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,873
Okay, I've learned my lesson, now please let go of me!

99
00:05:52,902 --> 00:05:55,092
Anyway. Tell me about the boy.

100
00:05:55,212 --> 00:05:58,141
Oh! That's right! He's going to be joining us.

101
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,475
I haven't agreed to anything!

102
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,967
Does he seem promising?

103
00:06:01,745 --> 00:06:02,845
Absolutely.

104
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:09,467
See? All we want you to do is try. 'Kay?

105
00:06:09,514 --> 00:06:10,642
S'not what you said before!

106
00:06:12,113 --> 00:06:14,260
Akame, go get everyone together.

107
00:06:14,563 --> 00:06:17,414
I want to hear about everything, including that boy.

108
00:06:19,693 --> 00:06:22,679
Thank you all. I think I understand the situation here.

109
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:26,020
Tatsumi! How would you like to
be the newest member of Night Raid?

110
00:06:26,045 --> 00:06:28,315
You're gonna kill me if I refuse to join, right.

111
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,881
No, we won't kill you.

112
00:06:29,983 --> 00:06:30,373
Huh?

113
00:06:30,397 --> 00:06:32,225
But we wouldn't let you leave, either.

114
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,535
You'd have to remain here and work in our factory.

115
00:06:36,373 --> 00:06:38,472
Either way, we won't take your life,

116
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:40,674
but I do encourage you to join.

117
00:06:41,361 --> 00:06:42,302
Your choice.

118
00:06:42,973 --> 00:06:43,907
I, uh...

119
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,755
I just wanted to make a lot of money in the Imperial
Capital so I'd be able to save my village from starvation.

120
00:06:50,127 --> 00:06:51,881
But the Capital wasn't what I thought.

121
00:06:52,107 --> 00:06:52,885
Tatsumi.

122
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:53,383
Huh?

123
00:06:54,034 --> 00:06:57,708
Corruption in the Capital is creating
mass-poverty all over the countryside.

124
00:06:58,226 --> 00:07:00,953
Don't you want to uproot all
that corruption at the source?

125
00:07:01,418 --> 00:07:02,552
Like a man would?

126
00:07:02,577 --> 00:07:06,168
Bulat used to be a high-ranking
officer in the Imperial Army,

127
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:10,185
but he joined us when he realized
what was really going on in the Capital.

128
00:07:10,907 --> 00:07:15,401
If we don't do something about the scum terrorizing
the Capital, then it's never gonna get cleaned up.

129
00:07:15,426 --> 00:07:18,980
So it's our job to take out those
bastards whenever we get the chance.

130
00:07:19,193 --> 00:07:19,973
That's fine...

131
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:25,118
But I don't think you can make a real big difference by
just eliminating a couple of rotten eggs here and there.

132
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:29,112
I mean, doing things this way
won't save places like my village.

133
00:07:29,273 --> 00:07:33,102
That's correct. And that's exactly
why Night Raid's the perfect fit for you.

134
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,964
Uh... why is that?

135
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:40,371
There's an anti-Empire group called the Revolutionary
Army that has a hideout south of the Capital.

136
00:07:41,008 --> 00:07:42,111
A whole army?

137
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:44,498
They started out small,

138
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,720
but they've grown in to a rather formidable organization.

139
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:54,382
They needed a separate unit to specialize in covert
operations, such as recon and assassinating targets.

140
00:07:54,739 --> 00:07:57,311
That's why they created Night Raid!

141
00:07:58,553 --> 00:08:01,005
We're only putting out one fire at a time right now...

142
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,122
but when the Revolutionary
Army decides to make its move...

143
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:07,206
amidst the chaos we'll head
straight for the cause of this mess...

144
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,296
the Minister!

145
00:08:08,727 --> 00:08:10,622
So you're gonna... kill him?

146
00:08:11,027 --> 00:08:14,097
Only then will our nation truly see change.

147
00:08:15,933 --> 00:08:17,814
So if our nation had a new start...

148
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,524
you really think all of the
people would be safe and happy again?

149
00:08:20,764 --> 00:08:21,832
I am certain.

150
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,803
I... I love it.

151
00:08:24,034 --> 00:08:25,862
It's like you guys are taking out the trash...

152
00:08:26,193 --> 00:08:28,131
killing off the bad guys one by one.

153
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,803
You're a rogue team of assassins for the sake of justice!

154
00:08:34,933 --> 00:08:37,432
Huh? What'd I say?! Why's everyone laughing?

155
00:08:37,841 --> 00:08:40,687
Tatsumi, no matter how you describe it,

156
00:08:40,907 --> 00:08:42,784
we're still murderers.

157
00:08:43,173 --> 00:08:46,127
And there's no justice to be
found in the way we do things.

158
00:08:46,152 --> 00:08:47,260
Any given moment...

159
00:08:47,721 --> 00:08:51,048
every one of us could be forced to
atone for the blood that we've spilled.

160
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:53,281
Man! He has no idea.

161
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,885
It'll be a thousand years before he can handle it.

162
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:56,991
Hold on.

163
00:08:57,421 --> 00:08:58,180
Uh?

164
00:08:58,707 --> 00:08:59,341
I, uh...

165
00:09:00,161 --> 00:09:02,609
Every team member fights for a different reason,

166
00:09:02,847 --> 00:09:04,917
but each bares a strong resolve.

167
00:09:05,894 --> 00:09:07,799
Are you prepared to risk your life?

168
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:10,808
You guys are gonna pay me for this, aren't you?

169
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,103
Yes. And if you work hard enough,

170
00:09:13,128 --> 00:09:15,461
I think you'll make more than enough to save your village.

171
00:09:15,561 --> 00:09:16,559
Then I wanna do it!

172
00:09:16,706 --> 00:09:18,573
Please allow me to be part of Night Raid!

173
00:09:18,807 --> 00:09:21,814
You probably won't be going back
to them as some hero, you know.

174
00:09:21,845 --> 00:09:25,340
I know. But that doesn't matter to
me as long as they'll be taken care of.

175
00:09:25,841 --> 00:09:26,373
Hmph.

176
00:09:27,231 --> 00:09:28,124
Works for me.

177
00:09:28,454 --> 00:09:30,950
Prepare yourself for a life unlike any other.

178
00:09:31,273 --> 00:09:32,532
Welcome to Night Raid.

179
00:09:32,846 --> 00:09:34,153
You're dismissed for the night.

180
00:09:34,994 --> 00:09:35,553
Akame...

181
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,157
Hm?

182
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,659
You're in charge of training him for now.

183
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,678
Ugh?

184
00:09:39,974 --> 00:09:42,249
If he becomes a nuisance, feel free to kill him.

185
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:43,500
No problem.

186
00:09:43,907 --> 00:09:44,910
No problem?!

187
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,825
Better do a good job if you wanna live!

188
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:48,311
Uh...

189
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,162
It had to be her... I am so dead.

190
00:09:55,193 --> 00:09:57,442
The more skills we can start learning right now

191
00:09:57,467 --> 00:09:59,768
the quicker we'll be able to get ahead in the military!

192
00:09:59,793 --> 00:10:01,843
And if we ever run out of provisions or something,

193
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:04,842
maybe knowing how to prepare
food might actually save us someday.

194
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,046
Sayo... Ieyasu...

195
00:10:07,477 --> 00:10:10,201
Who knew learning to cook with
you guys would come in so handy?

196
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,040
I said I want seconds!

197
00:10:12,065 --> 00:10:12,990
Oh! Me too!

198
00:10:13,014 --> 00:10:13,704
I'll take some!

199
00:10:13,729 --> 00:10:14,679
Oh yes if you don't mind!

200
00:10:15,821 --> 00:10:17,225
They're running me ragged!

201
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:19,022
Come on...

202
00:10:19,281 --> 00:10:21,848
I thought I was supposed to become
an assassin, not a stupid chef!

203
00:10:21,873 --> 00:10:22,628
Don't look at me.

204
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,132
I just put food on the plates. M'kay?

205
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:28,464
Oh, so they won't let you cook because
you kept sampling the food, is that it?

206
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,761
I don't know what you mean.

207
00:10:30,674 --> 00:10:32,456
You are not a very good liar.

208
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,282
Aww, look, you're right at home
in the kitchen, aren't you, rookie?

209
00:10:36,488 --> 00:10:37,208
What?!

210
00:10:37,594 --> 00:10:38,848
Later, Sunshine!

211
00:10:38,968 --> 00:10:39,583
Bulat?

212
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,948
Wait a sec...

213
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:42,573
are you guys heading out on a mission?

214
00:10:42,598 --> 00:10:44,688
Yeah, this one's a special request.

215
00:10:44,793 --> 00:10:46,048
Shouldn't I come too?

216
00:10:46,287 --> 00:10:47,954
You stay here in the kitchen!

217
00:10:47,979 --> 00:10:50,911
Now you be a good cook and chop a few cucumbers for me.

218
00:10:50,961 --> 00:10:53,410
Why does she always have to be like that?

219
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,265
See ya!

220
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,523
Grrr...

221
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,239
Wow, this place is great!

222
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,054
Today we'll start by catching fish for dinner.

223
00:11:04,266 --> 00:11:06,011
Whoa!

224
00:11:09,106 --> 00:11:10,787
What seems to be the problem?

225
00:11:16,046 --> 00:11:17,458
Thank god it's just a swimsuit.

226
00:11:17,483 --> 00:11:19,076
The target is Koga Tuna.

227
00:11:19,173 --> 00:11:20,444
See how many you can get.

228
00:11:20,558 --> 00:11:23,976
Aren't those things extremely rare
and stupidly hard to get a hold of?

229
00:11:33,865 --> 00:11:34,402
Wha-?

230
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:42,381
First you have to swim all the way down to the bottom.

231
00:11:42,704 --> 00:11:45,214
Then conceal your aura and make your attack.

232
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,190
You have to act very quickly.

233
00:11:47,738 --> 00:11:48,512
Give it a try.

234
00:11:48,692 --> 00:11:51,013
Hmm... Whatever you say!

235
00:11:51,793 --> 00:11:56,029
Wow. So in the end our little
Tatsumi caught two whole fish, huh?

236
00:11:56,335 --> 00:11:59,610
Akame said you ripped off your shirt
and said some shit like "I got this!"

237
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:00,794
This'll take some time.

238
00:12:02,076 --> 00:12:05,242
Man... why the hell would she say something like that?

239
00:12:05,868 --> 00:12:07,302
I can't stand her.

240
00:12:07,395 --> 00:12:09,971
Anyway Leone. What did you find out?

241
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:14,926
Here's the deal. The targets are Ogre of
the Imperial Guard and Gamal the Oil Merchant.

242
00:12:15,286 --> 00:12:17,112
And according to the client...

243
00:12:18,545 --> 00:12:22,252
Ogre has been accepting bribes
from an oil merchant named Gamal.

244
00:12:22,859 --> 00:12:26,007
So whenever he manages to get himself into trouble...

245
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:29,939
Ogre finds a way to pin all of the blame on someone else.

246
00:12:30,587 --> 00:12:32,614
My fiancé fell victim to this.

247
00:12:32,739 --> 00:12:34,322
And he was sentenced to death.

248
00:12:35,115 --> 00:12:38,670
Please... I'm begging you, you must do something.

249
00:12:39,001 --> 00:12:42,591
Understood. That son of a bitch will get what he deserves.

250
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:45,512
Thank you! Thank you so much!

251
00:12:48,995 --> 00:12:51,561
Here it is. She paid it all up front.

252
00:12:51,734 --> 00:12:53,787
I'm amazed she could give us that much.

253
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,500
She smelled sickly.

254
00:12:56,673 --> 00:12:58,360
I think she's been selling her body.

255
00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:00,723
Huh? Is that right?

256
00:13:00,748 --> 00:13:02,214
Sure she's not lying?

257
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,653
My senses have never steered me wrong yet, Boss..

258
00:13:04,893 --> 00:13:05,826
He's guilty.

259
00:13:06,838 --> 00:13:10,247
Hmm. Then Night Raid accepts this assignment.

260
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,681
In the new nation we wish to create..

261
00:13:12,706 --> 00:13:14,314
S'no room for his trash.

262
00:13:14,671 --> 00:13:16,263
He needs divine punishment.

263
00:13:16,636 --> 00:13:18,931
We shouldn't have too much trouble with the oil merchant,

264
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:21,502
but I betcha Ogre'll be a pain in the ass.

265
00:13:22,332 --> 00:13:23,610
Ogre is a demon.

266
00:13:23,745 --> 00:13:26,969
He's very skilled with a sword,
even the hit men are scared of him.

267
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:30,928
And he's always surrounded by
a huge crowd of subordinates,

268
00:13:31,115 --> 00:13:32,843
he's never seen alone.

269
00:13:33,157 --> 00:13:37,061
He's so careful that Gamal delivers
all payments to his personal chambers.

270
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,467
But on his days off he goes drinking
on Main Street, right by the palace.

271
00:13:41,976 --> 00:13:44,799
Okay. Sounds like we know when we'll have to strike.

272
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,738
But, that area is heavily guarded.

273
00:13:47,891 --> 00:13:50,893
We can't send Akame; They
already know what she looks like.

274
00:13:51,196 --> 00:13:54,801
Hellooo! They don't have any wanted posters of me yet!

275
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,010
Can you do it?

276
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:58,450
Targets like these pukes are the ones I live for.

277
00:13:58,843 --> 00:14:00,972
I think we should wait 'til the others are here.

278
00:14:01,109 --> 00:14:04,482
But at the moment we still have no
idea when they're coming back, am I right?

279
00:14:05,336 --> 00:14:08,055
Fine! Then I say we set out on this mission without 'em!

280
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:11,889
Oh? You think you're capable of killing Ogre yourself?

281
00:14:11,914 --> 00:14:12,183
What?

282
00:14:12,207 --> 00:14:13,620
Careful how you answer that!

283
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:16,632
Keep pretending you're a bigshot
and we might just make you back it up!

284
00:14:16,807 --> 00:14:17,405
Oh!

285
00:14:17,781 --> 00:14:19,740
As you are now, you can't do it.

286
00:14:19,765 --> 00:14:20,197
Wha-?!

287
00:14:20,521 --> 00:14:22,204
But I'm an expert swordsman!

288
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:24,953
What I mean is that you can't kill people.

289
00:14:24,978 --> 00:14:27,627
Uh... I did it once.

290
00:14:29,546 --> 00:14:31,325
You were blinded by rage that night.

291
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,862
Can you kill a person under any
circumstances without stopping to think about it?

292
00:14:36,234 --> 00:14:37,275
I don't know,

293
00:14:37,512 --> 00:14:41,912
but what if Ogre is framing another innocent person
while the four of us are sitting here arguing about it?!

294
00:14:42,228 --> 00:14:43,733
That's why I don't want us to wait!

295
00:14:44,021 --> 00:14:46,612
I know how much it hurts to
lose someone for no good reason.

296
00:14:46,706 --> 00:14:47,887
And it's not fun!

297
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,742
I don't want anyone else to have to feel like that!

298
00:14:50,021 --> 00:14:50,995
Then it's settled.

299
00:14:51,219 --> 00:14:53,295
I admire your conviction, Tatsumi.

300
00:14:53,481 --> 00:14:54,603
Take him down.

301
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:57,818
Now that's what I like to
hear! You've got spunk, dontcha?!

302
00:14:58,334 --> 00:15:01,285
I'd like you two ladies to focus on the oil merchant.

303
00:15:01,427 --> 00:15:02,180
You got it!

304
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:03,420
Understood.

305
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,125
See Akame, I can take care of
business when push comes to shove.

306
00:15:08,894 --> 00:15:13,260
I'll withhold judgement of your ability
until you complete the mission and report back.

307
00:15:13,808 --> 00:15:16,395
If you begin with over-confidence and arrogance...

308
00:15:16,728 --> 00:15:17,472
you'll die.

309
00:15:17,497 --> 00:15:18,012
Uh!

310
00:15:21,348 --> 00:15:22,666
She'll change her tune.

311
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:25,125
I just have to prove myself by killing Ogre.

312
00:15:29,568 --> 00:15:30,575
This is Main Street.

313
00:15:31,481 --> 00:15:33,327
Did you memorize the map like I told you?

314
00:15:33,794 --> 00:15:35,120
Yeah. Yeah I got it.

315
00:15:36,134 --> 00:15:38,737
If you begin with over-confidence and arrogance...

316
00:15:39,094 --> 00:15:39,858
you'll die.

317
00:15:42,647 --> 00:15:46,781
Tatsumi, I think I should tell
you a few things about Akame's past.

318
00:15:47,467 --> 00:15:50,766
When she was a kid, she and her
sister were sold to the Empire.

319
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:56,640
They were placed in an assassin
training camp with other abandoned kids.

320
00:15:57,075 --> 00:16:01,080
She learned how to survive the harsh
surroundings as well as the art of murder.

321
00:16:02,914 --> 00:16:06,666
She grew up an assassin, blindly
doing the Empire's dirty work.

322
00:16:06,691 --> 00:16:10,743
But as Akame got older, she started to
see the darkness the Empire was hiding.

323
00:16:11,281 --> 00:16:13,970
One day, she was sent to kill... the Boss.

324
00:16:14,601 --> 00:16:15,815
But it didn't happen.

325
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:19,940
Somehow, she convinced her to join the Revolutionary Army.

326
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,773
And join the side of the people.

327
00:16:23,254 --> 00:16:25,005
But, by the time she could do it,

328
00:16:25,074 --> 00:16:28,229
most of the kids she had grown up with were already dead.

329
00:16:29,028 --> 00:16:30,719
Do you see what I'm getting at Tatsumi?

330
00:16:31,261 --> 00:16:36,135
Yeah yeah, as a professional killer, you're saying
there are things a rookie like me doesn't understand yet.

331
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:39,750
Well, if you manage to live through today,

332
00:16:39,775 --> 00:16:40,920
then you'll know a little more.

333
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:47,867
Whooo! That bathroom will never be the same.

334
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:50,989
Anyway, time to get back to living the dream!

335
00:16:51,054 --> 00:16:53,363
Wait a second. I've got a better idea.

336
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,204
Killed by two hot babes, you lucky dog!

337
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:06,135
Now then, I wonder how the newb's
doing with his part of the job?

338
00:17:06,721 --> 00:17:11,996
Ahhh. Nothing like finishing off a long
day of torture than knocking back a cold one.

339
00:17:12,021 --> 00:17:13,560
Excuse me, Master Ogre.

340
00:17:13,585 --> 00:17:14,240
Uh-huh?

341
00:17:14,982 --> 00:17:17,908
I have a matter of utmost importance
I'd like to discuss with you.

342
00:17:18,028 --> 00:17:19,779
That so? Let's hear it.

343
00:17:21,114 --> 00:17:22,456
We need to speak privately.

344
00:17:22,734 --> 00:17:23,263
Huh?

345
00:17:28,288 --> 00:17:29,952
This kid doesn't have an aura.

346
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:33,024
Alright start talkin'. I wanna get home.

347
00:17:33,247 --> 00:17:33,964
Of course.

348
00:17:35,367 --> 00:17:38,512
Sayo, Ieyasu, please watch over me.

349
00:17:39,394 --> 00:17:39,900
Huh?

350
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:43,233
Please, sir, I beg you to let me join the Imperial Guard!

351
00:17:43,314 --> 00:17:46,761
I have to earn money to send
back to my family in the country!

352
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,281
Uh... I shoulda known it was something like that.

353
00:17:50,306 --> 00:17:53,010
Follow the procedures like everyone else, jackass.

354
00:17:53,035 --> 00:17:53,865
I tried,

355
00:17:55,022 --> 00:17:57,464
but they wouldn't even take my application.

356
00:17:57,801 --> 00:17:59,594
That's not my problem.

357
00:18:05,106 --> 00:18:08,251
It's not my fault you're a puny little weakling!

358
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:11,415
That was quick!

359
00:18:11,894 --> 00:18:13,381
He acted without fear.

360
00:18:14,128 --> 00:18:16,505
Been awhile since somebody defied me.

361
00:18:21,127 --> 00:18:22,274
Just like that!

362
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:27,319
I'll withhold judgement of your ability
until you complete the mission and report back.

363
00:18:27,663 --> 00:18:28,843
Oh! That's right.

364
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,867
I better be getting back to base now.

365
00:18:34,249 --> 00:18:34,657
Huh?

366
00:18:34,876 --> 00:18:35,797
Ah!

367
00:18:35,962 --> 00:18:36,481
Uh!

368
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,433
Did you really think you could slay the mighty Ogre?!

369
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:44,583
A pathetic little snot-nosed brat like you?

370
00:18:45,776 --> 00:18:46,527
Ugh!

371
00:18:46,902 --> 00:18:48,209
Okay, lemme guess.

372
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:52,608
You're one of those Night Raid punks that goes
around killing all the people in power, right?

373
00:18:52,934 --> 00:18:54,811
The weak can squeal all they want,

374
00:18:54,996 --> 00:18:57,888
but the strong will always rule in this Empire, boy!

375
00:18:58,335 --> 00:19:00,863
Who you deem worthy means nothing!

376
00:19:00,936 --> 00:19:03,067
I judge the fate of the people!

377
00:19:04,883 --> 00:19:06,983
I won't let you kill anyone else!

378
00:19:15,338 --> 00:19:17,813
On whose order have you come to me, boy?!

379
00:19:17,997 --> 00:19:21,337
The fiancée of the little worm I just had executed?

380
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:24,109
Guess I was right!

381
00:19:24,389 --> 00:19:28,238
I told myself I shoulda knocked
off that wench while I had the chance!

382
00:19:28,338 --> 00:19:31,338
Well, I still could if I really wanted to.

383
00:19:31,383 --> 00:19:33,853
First thing I'll do is chase that bitch down.

384
00:19:33,878 --> 00:19:37,105
I'll find everyone she knows, bring 'em up on charges

385
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:40,324
and take my time torturing
them to death while she watches!

386
00:19:40,349 --> 00:19:42,895
But not until I kill you first!

387
00:19:45,501 --> 00:19:46,887
These guys are all the same.

388
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:50,798
They throw their weight around and
use their power for nothing but evil.

389
00:19:52,278 --> 00:19:54,918
I want nothing more than to take scum like him...

390
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:57,899
and slash it...

391
00:19:58,884 --> 00:20:00,310
to pieces!

392
00:20:14,096 --> 00:20:16,625
You've defeated a powerful adversary on your own.

393
00:20:16,756 --> 00:20:17,709
I'm impressed.

394
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:19,510
Yep! Hear that, Akame?

395
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:23,192
I did exactly what you wanted me to,
And I came out without a scratch on me!

396
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,115
Now, tell me how wonderful I am!

397
00:20:26,623 --> 00:20:27,046
Hmm?

398
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:28,699
Ah!

399
00:20:28,836 --> 00:20:30,576
What the hell are you doing to me?!

400
00:20:30,601 --> 00:20:32,442
Leone, Boss, grab him.

401
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,370
Ah!

402
00:20:35,281 --> 00:20:39,114
Uh...

403
00:20:41,436 --> 00:20:42,436
Thank goodness.

404
00:20:42,461 --> 00:20:42,988
Oh...

405
00:20:46,702 --> 00:20:51,192
I've seen people die from infection because
they were too proud to report their wounds.

406
00:20:51,863 --> 00:20:53,410
It's good you didn't get hurt.

407
00:20:53,891 --> 00:20:56,768
It's hard for most people to
survive past their first mission.

408
00:20:57,242 --> 00:20:58,510
I'm glad you survived.

409
00:20:58,535 --> 00:20:59,898
Uh... Hm.

410
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:07,223
The only reason Akame was so hard on you before
was because she was worried about your safety.

411
00:21:07,561 --> 00:21:09,967
Learning to cook helped with your communication.

412
00:21:10,123 --> 00:21:12,713
And hunting taught you basic killing techniques.

413
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:16,929
Do you not realize everything we made
you do was for a very specific reason?

414
00:21:16,963 --> 00:21:18,771
Oh, uh, I guess not.

415
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:23,289
Sorry Akame. I got... I got the wrong idea.

416
00:21:23,756 --> 00:21:24,578
It's okay.

417
00:21:24,718 --> 00:21:25,238
Huh?

418
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:28,254
Just try to keep coming back alive, Tatsumi.

419
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:31,580
Sure! S'long as you keep looking after me, Akame.

420
00:21:32,343 --> 00:21:36,263
Oh my god this is so adorable and cheesy and the fact
that you're almost naked makes it even more ridiculous.

421
00:21:36,343 --> 00:21:38,243
Hey, you're the ones who took my shirt off!

422
00:21:38,863 --> 00:21:42,855
Well, you're working with Mine on your
next assignment so I expect your best.

423
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,390
Ugh!

424
00:21:43,661 --> 00:21:46,129
Yeouch, out of the frying pan, and into the fire!

425
00:21:46,154 --> 00:21:46,556
Ah!

426
00:21:47,524 --> 00:21:49,544
She's even worse!

427
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,763
I have a bad feeling all of a sudden.
