1
00:00:06,813 --> 00:00:08,112
Oh God...

2
00:00:08,579 --> 00:00:12,786
We may have celebrated a little too
hard last night for Tatsumi's return.

3
00:00:13,892 --> 00:00:15,670
Guess we all crashed out here.

4
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:21,102
Sleepy, sleepy...

5
00:00:33,637 --> 00:00:35,550
I've done it, Master Stylish!

6
00:00:37,588 --> 00:00:40,647
Your trusty assistant Trauma has done iiiit!

7
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:42,913
Good work, now let's continue the mission.

8
00:00:43,573 --> 00:00:45,500
He got the first one, Doctor Stylish.

9
00:00:45,525 --> 00:00:51,124
Marvelous! That's my little knight in shining
armor, flying straight into enemy headquarters.

10
00:00:51,415 --> 00:00:52,268
All right...

11
00:00:52,561 --> 00:00:54,653
Go, Beautiful Team Stylish!

12
00:00:54,678 --> 00:00:57,642
The Dapper Offensive is officially underway!

13
00:02:29,585 --> 00:02:32,129
The soldiers have made their way into Night Raid's base.

14
00:02:32,154 --> 00:02:36,525
Ah, let the show begin! I'm tingling with anticipation!

15
00:02:37,398 --> 00:02:38,399
Holy crap!

16
00:02:38,766 --> 00:02:40,536
Where'd they come from all of a sudden?!

17
00:02:40,762 --> 00:02:41,895
They're already on top of us!

18
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,081
How the hell did they even get in?

19
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,829
The enemy... must be killed.

20
00:02:53,735 --> 00:02:56,826
This is bad. I need to find the rest of the team, now!

21
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:08,001
It sounds like they got one.

22
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,826
Well, my enhanced fighters are more resilient than humans.

23
00:03:12,007 --> 00:03:15,325
It takes serious finesse to put even a scratch on them.

24
00:03:16,664 --> 00:03:18,033
Is there some kind of problem?

25
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,546
Not really. But they seem pretty resilient themselves.

26
00:03:22,157 --> 00:03:25,893
You'd be amazed how many awesome tricks
I can do with this little bit of string.

27
00:03:26,001 --> 00:03:27,553
Check this out! Hyah!

28
00:03:29,184 --> 00:03:31,485
KYAH!!!!

29
00:03:32,948 --> 00:03:35,282
All I have to do is bind them all together, and...

30
00:03:35,723 --> 00:03:36,621
Voila!

31
00:03:38,114 --> 00:03:40,391
So creative...

32
00:03:41,396 --> 00:03:42,818
Saw that in a manga one time.

33
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:47,276
You wouldn't believe it, but those crazy things
are full of ideas of how to manipulate string.

34
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:49,722
Crap, another one.

35
00:03:52,861 --> 00:03:54,136
Nope. More than one.

36
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:57,444
Ah, sorry I'm not so good with groups.

37
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,163
I think I'm just gonna pass on you guys, if that's cool.

38
00:04:04,022 --> 00:04:06,223
Ah, dammit, they're pretty fast!

39
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,671
Stay behind me Lubbock.

40
00:04:10,926 --> 00:04:11,824
Yeah, I can do that!

41
00:04:20,297 --> 00:04:21,472
Nice one, Akame!

42
00:04:24,106 --> 00:04:24,594
Wait!

43
00:04:24,853 --> 00:04:25,874
You want some too?!

44
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:28,206
Impressive for a couple of thugs.

45
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:32,194
He's strong.

46
00:04:32,901 --> 00:04:34,422
You can call me Toby.

47
00:04:34,635 --> 00:04:37,277
And I'm here to battle you one-on-one, Akame!

48
00:04:47,115 --> 00:04:48,202
This one's different.

49
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:54,111
I felt it when I attacked. His entire body is mechanical!

50
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:55,098
Akame!

51
00:05:00,195 --> 00:05:01,398
Giants, huh?

52
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:02,551
Okay!

53
00:05:16,731 --> 00:05:18,667
Hey, you in the tin can!

54
00:05:20,702 --> 00:05:22,790
Nice of you to show yourself.

55
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:26,664
Seems you're the fella I'm s'posed
to kill, so let's get down to it!

56
00:05:27,431 --> 00:05:28,477
Those scissors!

57
00:05:29,017 --> 00:05:32,485
Oh, these? The Shears of Creation Extase.

58
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:34,793
Just picked these up.

59
00:05:35,317 --> 00:05:36,697
Give those back.

60
00:05:37,065 --> 00:05:38,899
They don't belong to you!

61
00:05:45,975 --> 00:05:47,754
These babies'll cut anything!

62
00:05:51,913 --> 00:05:55,791
Pretty good reflexes boy. I
was gonna take your whole arm off!

63
00:05:57,298 --> 00:06:01,184
No matter how thick that armor
is, I can cut right through it.

64
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:05,460
So, how's it feel to know your
armor is useless against me?

65
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:08,180
Your little outfit won't do you any good!

66
00:06:08,803 --> 00:06:11,758
Sounds like we have the upper
hand over Murasame AND Incursio.

67
00:06:11,783 --> 00:06:13,352
Exactly how I planned it.

68
00:06:13,561 --> 00:06:16,791
It's easy to defeat somebody
you have a strong aversion to.

69
00:06:17,372 --> 00:06:20,621
But still, we've already lost quite a few soldiers.

70
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:24,208
There's too much noise in the area
for me to determine the exact number,

71
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:26,481
but the death count is extremely high.

72
00:06:27,175 --> 00:06:29,136
Oh dear, what a tragedy.

73
00:06:31,126 --> 00:06:32,184
Just kidding!

74
00:06:32,857 --> 00:06:35,732
Those silly pawns are wonderfully dispensable.

75
00:06:35,914 --> 00:06:37,657
They're just criminals anyway.

76
00:06:38,234 --> 00:06:43,167
Poor dolts are always happy to cut a deal with
me if they think it'll shorten their sentence!

77
00:06:43,232 --> 00:06:44,669
Little do they know,

78
00:06:44,745 --> 00:06:47,393
they're nothing but fancy fodder waiting to die!

79
00:06:47,735 --> 00:06:49,374
Those belong to Sheele!

80
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:51,938
Give 'em to me NOW!

81
00:06:51,963 --> 00:06:54,386
Huh? Who the hell is Shell?

82
00:06:58,353 --> 00:07:00,746
You must really feel like dying today.

83
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,572
How about I start cuttin' some stuff off?

84
00:07:04,245 --> 00:07:06,416
Real brave, picking on a pipsqueak.

85
00:07:06,848 --> 00:07:07,475
Huh?

86
00:07:08,003 --> 00:07:10,281
You're even more pathetic than I thought.

87
00:07:14,603 --> 00:07:15,253
Mine!

88
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:22,951
So those pieces of crap couldn't handle
you by yourself, and now it's my job?!

89
00:07:23,138 --> 00:07:24,817
I'm ready to get this over with.

90
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:29,111
Seeing Extase in your big, ugly
hands is starting to piss me off.

91
00:07:29,136 --> 00:07:31,211
So you wanna get this over with?

92
00:07:31,236 --> 00:07:34,565
Be careful what you ask for,
cause you're gonna get it, sweetie!

93
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,359
In case you haven't noticed, we took over your base!

94
00:07:37,384 --> 00:07:39,636
You've been made, and it's all but done!

95
00:07:39,755 --> 00:07:41,170
That's why I'll make it quick.

96
00:07:43,425 --> 00:07:45,677
Do you know who you're talking to?!

97
00:07:49,171 --> 00:07:50,558
Stupid little girl!

98
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:53,636
She knows I was able to withstand Incursio's attacks!

99
00:07:53,661 --> 00:07:56,150
What's she gonna do with that pea-shooter?

100
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,962
Nooooo...

101
00:08:12,681 --> 00:08:14,123
The more intense my fight,

102
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,606
the more intense my weapon.

103
00:08:16,731 --> 00:08:18,743
You should not have underestimated me.

104
00:08:43,104 --> 00:08:45,007
You're coming home, Sheele.

105
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:52,184
Kaku has been defeated.

106
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:54,975
And they've almost finished off the whole infantry.

107
00:08:55,181 --> 00:08:58,055
Oh my goodness gracious, what a tragic turn of events.

108
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,380
I'm afraid that does it. Time for Plan B.

109
00:09:02,477 --> 00:09:05,223
Doctor, there's something flying over us.

110
00:09:05,314 --> 00:09:05,903
Huh?

111
00:09:09,885 --> 00:09:12,292
That must be Danger Beast Air Manta!

112
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:14,171
And someone's riding on its back.

113
00:09:15,017 --> 00:09:16,053
Wait a second...

114
00:09:17,086 --> 00:09:18,659
It's ex-General Najenda!

115
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:22,113
Looks like she's got two other people with her, too.

116
00:09:22,138 --> 00:09:24,624
Oooh, delightfully dramatic!

117
00:09:24,696 --> 00:09:27,929
Valiantly riding on a Danger Beast she tamed herself?!

118
00:09:27,988 --> 00:09:30,446
Now don't get yourself all worked up!

119
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:33,368
Headquarters was proud of their fortune-telling Arms.

120
00:09:33,515 --> 00:09:35,332
It predicted trouble near the hideout,

121
00:09:35,496 --> 00:09:36,867
and it came to pass.

122
00:09:37,405 --> 00:09:39,635
Glad I flew back as soon as I found out.

123
00:09:39,721 --> 00:09:41,421
This is your shot, recruits.

124
00:09:41,502 --> 00:09:43,318
Time to show me what you're made of!

125
00:09:44,338 --> 00:09:46,355
Well, isn't THIS a fun surprise?

126
00:09:46,455 --> 00:09:48,154
It actually works out great for me.

127
00:09:48,396 --> 00:09:52,156
Every one of you is going to become
a test subject for my experiments!

128
00:09:52,661 --> 00:09:54,959
It's time to unveil my trump card!

129
00:10:06,141 --> 00:10:09,936
If I can't finish you in a single hit,
then I'll have to chop you into pieces.

130
00:10:10,045 --> 00:10:13,067
And it's gonna hurt. You better get ready.

131
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:15,315
That's where you're mistaken.

132
00:10:15,817 --> 00:10:18,672
Given my condition, I can't feel pain anymore!

133
00:10:20,722 --> 00:10:21,589
Hyah!

134
00:10:23,378 --> 00:10:24,033
Yah!

135
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,874
Damn you! This wasn't even your fight!

136
00:10:48,971 --> 00:10:51,189
My home and all of my friends are in danger.

137
00:10:51,214 --> 00:10:53,626
Do you honestly expect me to just sit back and watch?

138
00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:00,176
Well... As it was going, I
would have lost that battle anyway,

139
00:11:00,575 --> 00:11:02,606
even if he hadn't interfered.

140
00:11:03,438 --> 00:11:06,333
Akame... please tell me...

141
00:11:06,968 --> 00:11:10,037
Why was it impossible for me to win against you?

142
00:11:10,425 --> 00:11:12,610
Your fighting style was extremely aggressive,

143
00:11:13,195 --> 00:11:14,989
but you left me too many openings.

144
00:11:16,071 --> 00:11:16,986
Obviously.

145
00:11:17,913 --> 00:11:20,891
I should've focused more on defense. Right?

146
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,986
A sense of pain is quite the useful luxury after all.

147
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:36,519
What is that?

148
00:11:37,785 --> 00:11:38,751
More enemies?

149
00:11:38,869 --> 00:11:40,099
Hang on, I'll check.

150
00:11:46,241 --> 00:11:48,233
Whaddya know?! It's the boss!

151
00:11:48,258 --> 00:11:52,180
Sweet, perfect timing! Wait, that's not fair!

152
00:11:52,205 --> 00:11:53,266
What's not fair?

153
00:11:53,577 --> 00:11:55,768
How come they get to ride on a giant fish?!

154
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:57,886
I wanna ride a fish!

155
00:11:57,978 --> 00:12:01,425
Umm... I'm not sure I know exactly how to respond to that.

156
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,695
Oh, you adorable little lady!

157
00:12:10,543 --> 00:12:13,425
You seem to have left yourself wide open!

158
00:12:15,471 --> 00:12:17,646
You really caught me off-guard didn't you?

159
00:12:20,644 --> 00:12:23,666
I was passed out and hung over
and you throw a knife at me?

160
00:12:23,752 --> 00:12:26,438
That is grounds for a serious ass-kicking my friend!

161
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:31,274
Put me down! I can't breathe!

162
00:12:31,299 --> 00:12:32,534
Word of advice.

163
00:12:32,574 --> 00:12:37,160
I'm a huge fan of surprise attacks, but if there's
one thing I hate about them, it's when they happen to me!

164
00:12:37,185 --> 00:12:41,814
Your body looks like it's been enhanced, but I
wouldn't expect that to make your death come any easier!

165
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:45,371
A-ha!

166
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,938
Well, she's just full of surprises isn't she?

167
00:12:52,743 --> 00:12:56,834
Ow... He did manage to get in a
good one, and man does it hurt!

168
00:12:57,222 --> 00:12:58,566
Oops! Oh crap!

169
00:12:58,965 --> 00:13:00,166
I think I killed him.

170
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,737
Um... Sis?

171
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:03,928
You're okay now, right?

172
00:13:04,154 --> 00:13:06,482
Yeah, he just surprised me at first, that's all.

173
00:13:06,696 --> 00:13:10,832
But I can regenerate pretty fast when
I'm in my beast form, so I'll be just fine!

174
00:13:11,338 --> 00:13:12,487
Everybody okay?

175
00:13:12,511 --> 00:13:13,044
Yeah!

176
00:13:13,231 --> 00:13:14,718
Good, I think we're all here.

177
00:13:19,927 --> 00:13:21,924
Looks like we've still got some work to do.

178
00:13:22,591 --> 00:13:26,141
This doesn't make sense. How did they
get in without setting off my traps?!

179
00:13:26,623 --> 00:13:29,066
I'm not picking up anyone else's smell either.

180
00:13:29,193 --> 00:13:32,431
Whatever, we're all together so
let's just knock these losers out, okay?

181
00:13:32,456 --> 00:13:33,025
Right!

182
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,413
Akame!

183
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,184
Wha... what's wrong with you guys?!

184
00:13:39,597 --> 00:13:43,467
I can't... move my body... argh!

185
00:13:43,827 --> 00:13:47,308
This sensation... it's just
like what happened on that boat!

186
00:13:47,604 --> 00:13:48,861
Hypnosis, maybe?

187
00:13:49,373 --> 00:13:50,991
No... I think...

188
00:13:52,076 --> 00:13:53,992
it's... it's...

189
00:13:55,482 --> 00:13:59,422
Seems to be working perfectly on all
targets except the one wearing Incursio.

190
00:14:00,222 --> 00:14:02,157
That's the effect of my trump card.

191
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:05,620
A fast-acting paralysis agent
I made all by my stylish self.

192
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:08,417
Aaah! But won't our allies be poisoned too?!

193
00:14:08,464 --> 00:14:12,032
Obviously, the good doctor remembered
to treat them with the antidote, moron.

194
00:14:12,112 --> 00:14:15,817
Oooh, Master Stylish, you're like a super genius!

195
00:14:16,003 --> 00:14:21,302
It's not like I intended to try out my latest
concoction on such promising subjects, you know?

196
00:14:21,495 --> 00:14:26,401
See? It's a very valuable creation
and I went to great lengths to make it!

197
00:14:26,467 --> 00:14:28,142
But I had no other option!

198
00:14:28,295 --> 00:14:31,087
They were wiping out my lovely cohorts so quickly!

199
00:14:31,112 --> 00:14:32,483
We understand, Master!

200
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,692
You're so kind!

201
00:14:33,938 --> 00:14:37,770
Yes, and the poison has no smell, so it's easy on my nose!

202
00:14:46,697 --> 00:14:49,138
I'm holding up better than anyone else right now.

203
00:14:49,808 --> 00:14:51,298
So it's all up to me!

204
00:15:13,433 --> 00:15:15,515
Is he... with us?

205
00:15:17,486 --> 00:15:20,798
Now! Exterminate every foe you see, Susanoo!

206
00:15:21,191 --> 00:15:22,082
Understood.

207
00:15:45,331 --> 00:15:46,692
What... the...

208
00:15:46,924 --> 00:15:51,508
Sir! One of them has jumped down and
is now pulverizing the entire infantry!

209
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:55,232
But that's impossible, the poison should
affect every living being in the area!

210
00:15:55,825 --> 00:15:58,969
Maybe not. He might have an unlisted Imperial Arms.

211
00:15:59,322 --> 00:16:03,294
In which case, I guess I don't really
need to include him in my research.

212
00:16:03,492 --> 00:16:04,227
Oops!

213
00:16:11,836 --> 00:16:14,198
Do you like my deluxe human explosive?!

214
00:16:14,344 --> 00:16:15,870
Ha! One down!

215
00:16:28,453 --> 00:16:30,724
Oh my god... don't tell me...

216
00:16:31,377 --> 00:16:32,974
I've only heard of these.

217
00:16:34,005 --> 00:16:35,220
He's an organic.

218
00:16:35,967 --> 00:16:38,155
He's a human Imperial Arms!

219
00:16:49,296 --> 00:16:50,907
Um... what are you...

220
00:16:56,973 --> 00:16:57,724
Fixed.

221
00:16:57,787 --> 00:16:58,682
Wait, what?

222
00:17:01,494 --> 00:17:05,136
Whoever did this found a spot
where he could easily spy on everyone.

223
00:17:05,522 --> 00:17:08,906
He's probably hiding somewhere
upwind so the poison can't get to him.

224
00:17:09,426 --> 00:17:12,054
If there's somebody calling the shots from above...

225
00:17:12,978 --> 00:17:15,148
then he must be somewhere over...

226
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:19,474
There!

227
00:17:20,092 --> 00:17:22,890
Susanoo! They're on the cliff to the southeast!

228
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,156
Don't let them get away!

229
00:17:24,328 --> 00:17:25,071
Understood.

230
00:17:25,588 --> 00:17:27,024
We've been discovered sir!

231
00:17:27,243 --> 00:17:28,851
Nothing to be done, is there?

232
00:17:29,078 --> 00:17:30,826
All we can do now is run!

233
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,853
Poison doesn't affect organic types!

234
00:17:33,878 --> 00:17:37,001
You must either destroy the
core or immobilize the wielder!

235
00:17:38,903 --> 00:17:41,597
My, my, she's even more tenacious than I thought!

236
00:17:48,172 --> 00:17:50,855
There's nothing to be afraid of, Master Stylish!

237
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:54,863
We are your guardians until the bitter
end! I promise you're in good hands!

238
00:17:55,196 --> 00:17:57,456
Oh, please, you don't stand a chance.

239
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:00,657
I designed you three for recon, not hand-to-hand combat.

240
00:18:00,962 --> 00:18:02,676
Now that it's come to this...

241
00:18:03,694 --> 00:18:05,275
I'll have to protect myself!

242
00:18:05,308 --> 00:18:10,043
And play my second trump card, Danger
Beast Shot! Sorry, but you leave me no choice!

243
00:18:11,948 --> 00:18:13,648
You okay, Master Stylish?

244
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:14,628
What's wrong?

245
00:18:15,322 --> 00:18:15,935
Sir?

246
00:18:16,668 --> 00:18:18,874
Oh, what an impeccable sensation!

247
00:18:18,934 --> 00:18:21,404
This is the ultimate in nouveau riche!

248
00:18:21,658 --> 00:18:26,938
I've successfully merged my body with a
Danger Beast, so I may personally kick your ass!

249
00:18:26,963 --> 00:18:28,571
He is GORGEOUS!

250
00:18:28,596 --> 00:18:30,202
Very impressive, Master!

251
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,860
But first I'm going to need a little sustenance, yes?

252
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,297
Time for us to become one!

253
00:18:46,147 --> 00:18:51,693
Just as I expected, scarfing down all
this nutritious meat is helping me level up!

254
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:53,486
What is that thing?!

255
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,157
He's a mutation.

256
00:19:02,523 --> 00:19:04,100
And he's totally gross!

257
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,540
Well this isn't bad,

258
00:19:05,593 --> 00:19:07,828
but I'd still like to be a scoche bigger.

259
00:19:08,173 --> 00:19:11,278
That Imperial Arms guy got me
pressed even when I'm a giant!

260
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:14,171
I suppose if I truly desire to win this battle,

261
00:19:14,241 --> 00:19:16,544
I'll have to grow even larger!

262
00:19:16,604 --> 00:19:20,691
Prepare yourself, to be devoured alive!

263
00:19:25,639 --> 00:19:26,502
Interesting.

264
00:19:28,442 --> 00:19:31,061
Oh crap, I'd better go help him!

265
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,859
Wait! Tatsumi...

266
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,993
I can't walk, but I need you to take me with you, okay?

267
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:37,184
Akame?

268
00:19:42,116 --> 00:19:42,771
Sure!

269
00:19:43,611 --> 00:19:44,913
You might wanna hold on tight.

270
00:19:45,252 --> 00:19:46,640
Now, let's do this!

271
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,910
Where are you going, Mr. Fancy Pants?

272
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:57,243
Are you too afraid to attack me?

273
00:20:06,887 --> 00:20:09,297
And you two! Playing some piggyback?

274
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:12,920
I'm sorry. But that's just tacky!!

275
00:20:20,443 --> 00:20:22,584
You're wasting your time, darling!

276
00:20:22,837 --> 00:20:27,698
The One-Hit Killer Murasame won't do
much good if it can't pierce my skin!

277
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:31,435
Now, perhaps it's time to give up...

278
00:20:38,463 --> 00:20:39,473
Damn you!

279
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,196
You've lost all your little pawns.

280
00:20:47,408 --> 00:20:49,571
You do know its almost over, don't you?!

281
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,350
I'm not done yet!

282
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,556
I bet you can reach his flesh from here!

283
00:21:02,682 --> 00:21:03,943
Go for it, Akame!

284
00:21:09,384 --> 00:21:10,190
You're done.

285
00:21:11,886 --> 00:21:17,090
No... there were still so many people
on which I wanted to experiment...

286
00:21:18,726 --> 00:21:21,758
I... I never thought it would end for me this way.

287
00:21:22,423 --> 00:21:24,108
I pictured more panache.

288
00:21:47,197 --> 00:21:49,654
You were lucky to die with all your parts intact.

289
00:21:50,324 --> 00:21:52,361
Don't take something like that for granted.
