1
00:00:01,813 --> 00:00:06,040
Livestock... livestock... livestock...

2
00:00:06,113 --> 00:00:09,447
All those stupid, miserable faces, are priceless!

3
00:00:09,547 --> 00:00:12,322
A herd of sheep to fill my coffers!

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,704
I do believe their taxes make
my wine taste even more sweet!

5
00:00:20,026 --> 00:00:20,957
Hello, Master.

6
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:22,332
Good afternoon.

7
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:27,887
Ooh! Hope you're ready, my dear. I'll
need a nice, long full-body rub today.

8
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,869
Mission successful.

9
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,775
So what kind of massage did you have in mind?

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,976
We're the Jaegers, sir!

11
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:41,685
We're here to protect you. We need to search the mansion.

12
00:00:43,033 --> 00:00:43,882
Look at this.

13
00:00:45,367 --> 00:00:46,430
We were too late.

14
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:51,189
I don't what happened, but we must've
had a leak somewhere down the line.

15
00:00:51,413 --> 00:00:52,979
The Jaegers walked in on me.

16
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,182
I'm amazed you made it out safely.

17
00:00:55,213 --> 00:00:56,751
Those guys are a real threat.

18
00:00:57,271 --> 00:01:01,295
He had a few cats, so turned into one
and just acted casual 'til they left.

19
00:01:02,803 --> 00:01:05,757
So I guess your Imperial Arms does have its uses then.

20
00:01:05,824 --> 00:01:08,390
I'm not sure how I would've
gotten out of a pinch like that.

21
00:01:08,517 --> 00:01:11,149
It's harder for you now, since
they know what you look like.

22
00:01:11,349 --> 00:01:14,148
Feel free to leave missions
like that to me from now on, okay?

23
00:01:14,613 --> 00:01:16,780
Wow, thanks, Chelsea.

24
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,546
Well, while I'm out saving the day, you
be sure to guard the house... like a puppy.

25
00:01:22,313 --> 00:01:27,249
Just when you're being nice, you turn
into a piece of crap! Oh my god, I hate you!

26
00:01:27,861 --> 00:01:30,634
Yeah, I remember when Mine used
to say the same kinda shit to me.

27
00:01:30,807 --> 00:01:32,425
Well, based on what happened,

28
00:01:32,572 --> 00:01:35,552
it would seem the Jaegers might
be starting to hone in on us.

29
00:01:35,577 --> 00:01:37,999
Well, now that they've run out of Danger Beasts to hunt,

30
00:01:38,292 --> 00:01:41,447
maybe Night Raid is the last group
of enemies they have left to fight.

31
00:01:41,949 --> 00:01:45,615
But since Tatsumi decided to take
an island vacation with their leader,

32
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:47,461
maybe they'll decide to go easy on us!

33
00:01:48,894 --> 00:01:51,764
Leave me alone! I was sent
there against my will, remember?!

34
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:54,923
Sure, you were just alone in
paradise with a beautiful woman.

35
00:01:55,283 --> 00:01:57,605
It's not like I'm totally jealous of you or anything.

36
00:01:57,745 --> 00:02:01,274
You coulda just left her there. I mean she
is the most dangerous killer in the Empire.

37
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:04,882
Boy, am I glad that wasn't me. Whoo, I sure am lucky.

38
00:02:04,907 --> 00:02:05,888
Lucky, lucky me!

39
00:02:05,913 --> 00:02:07,355
Don't hurt yourself there, Lubb.

40
00:02:07,521 --> 00:02:10,806
C'mere, Tatsumi, just forget all about that nasty lady!

41
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:11,991
Squishy squishy...

42
00:02:13,271 --> 00:02:15,626
Esdeath was always a resilient one.

43
00:02:16,179 --> 00:02:18,447
Even if you'd left her, she would've found a way back.

44
00:02:18,696 --> 00:02:21,011
So forget about owing her any favors,

45
00:02:21,036 --> 00:02:25,288
because when you go up against her in combat,
I expect you to do so with all you've got.

46
00:02:25,347 --> 00:02:26,898
Did you say "always"?

47
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:29,378
Hold on, Boss, how old are you anyway?

48
00:02:29,403 --> 00:02:31,542
In my mid-twenties, if you must know.

49
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:33,524
Esdeath is actually a bit younger.

50
00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:35,655
No way! You're only in your mid-twenties?!

51
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,984
I thought you were way older!

52
00:02:40,649 --> 00:02:44,797
Tatsumi, you should know better than
to ask a woman how old she is. It's rude.

53
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:49,413
Yeah, but when you talked about Sis being fat,
how come you didn't get your face smashed in?

54
00:02:49,513 --> 00:02:51,550
Hm? What are you talking about?

55
00:02:51,864 --> 00:02:53,313
Food's ready, everyone.

56
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,565
I know it's sudden, but let's
have a strategy meeting after we eat.

57
00:03:02,143 --> 00:03:05,243
It's time to move out. The Revolution is finally here.

58
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:08,968
We're ready to take the first step
towards overthrowing this corrupt government,

59
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,498
once and for all!

60
00:04:47,393 --> 00:04:50,059
Look, we are not with Night Raid, I swear!

61
00:04:50,168 --> 00:04:52,668
I promise, we only stole what we needed to eat!

62
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:54,433
We would never kill anyone!

63
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,369
So you admit that you were stealing.

64
00:04:56,489 --> 00:04:59,290
I'm afraid once you've been
tainted, you must be slaughtered.

65
00:05:00,372 --> 00:05:01,903
Koro, snack time.

66
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,626
Wait, please listen to me!

67
00:05:05,732 --> 00:05:09,181
I never wanted to take anything, but they
threatened to kill me if I didn't help them!

68
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,514
You gotta believe me!

69
00:05:10,558 --> 00:05:12,783
Please just give me a fair trial, I'm begging you!

70
00:05:13,812 --> 00:05:17,260
And yet you helped them anyway. A crime is still a crime.

71
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,466
Well, there's no reason for my
commander to concern herself with you.

72
00:05:20,646 --> 00:05:23,232
I will punish you myself for your poor judgement!

73
00:05:27,862 --> 00:05:29,466
Justice be served!

74
00:05:31,366 --> 00:05:33,240
Seryu! There you are!

75
00:05:35,226 --> 00:05:37,259
So, what happened to the thieves you found?

76
00:05:37,826 --> 00:05:39,593
Don't worry, Wave. I took care of it.

77
00:05:43,106 --> 00:05:45,012
Stop. You just...

78
00:05:45,193 --> 00:05:46,719
executed them, didn't you?

79
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:50,041
Listen, just because the
Jaegers have special jurisdiction,

80
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:52,906
it doesn't mean we can go around
murdering people whenever we wa...

81
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:58,966
They weren't Night Raid, but they were admitted criminals,
so I removed them from the population. Justice was served.

82
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:02,260
Let's keep working. There's still so much evil to purge.

83
00:06:04,026 --> 00:06:05,009
C'mon, Koro.

84
00:06:05,793 --> 00:06:06,823
Seryu...

85
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:10,889
I won't pretend this is a pretty job,

86
00:06:11,282 --> 00:06:14,090
but I never knew the imperial capital was this twisted.

87
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,552
This is seriously messed up.

88
00:06:17,526 --> 00:06:19,613
But I must repay my debt of honor!

89
00:06:21,206 --> 00:06:24,643
All I can do is fulfill my duty as a soldier.

90
00:06:26,293 --> 00:06:28,817
The Revolutionary Army is rising up!

91
00:06:28,966 --> 00:06:33,614
As such, I would like to take this opportunity
to explain our first order of business.

92
00:06:34,246 --> 00:06:38,900
I assume you're all familiar with the popular
religion among citizens known as Path of Peace?

93
00:06:38,925 --> 00:06:43,561
They're the one's who believe a person's good
deeds determine their happiness and longevity of life.

94
00:06:43,586 --> 00:06:46,485
Oh, yeah! They used to practice
that religion in my village!

95
00:06:46,968 --> 00:06:51,039
In fact, the day I left for the capital,
the mayor even gave me a statue of their god.

96
00:06:51,926 --> 00:06:55,111
In the past ten years, more
and more people have been joining.

97
00:06:55,136 --> 00:06:57,926
Its influence is quite high in
the eastern part of the capital.

98
00:06:58,026 --> 00:07:00,693
We have reason to believe that they're taking up arms.

99
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,422
They're looking to launch a religious rebellion!

100
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:07,714
The plan is for us to use that to our fullest advantage.

101
00:07:08,074 --> 00:07:09,582
Hey now, wait just a second!

102
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:13,259
Don't you understand how many people
could die if there's a religious rebellion?!

103
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:15,578
Shouldn't we try to stifle it or something?!

104
00:07:16,005 --> 00:07:19,733
The capital's let its backwards
government push the people over the edge.

105
00:07:20,933 --> 00:07:23,276
Even if we managed to stop the rebellion,

106
00:07:23,385 --> 00:07:26,707
then the angry masses would simply explode somewhere else.

107
00:07:26,899 --> 00:07:30,407
This forsaken empire's already living out its last days.

108
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:31,056
Finally.

109
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,453
Do you really think so?

110
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,829
You should've at least let her
finish before you threw a tantrum.

111
00:07:37,961 --> 00:07:42,215
Just think back to that story we told you
about the rebel tribe and the hero from the north.

112
00:07:44,277 --> 00:07:46,626
Didn't Esdeath put a stop to both of those though?

113
00:07:47,187 --> 00:07:50,526
They failed because they tried to
confront the empire by themselves.

114
00:07:51,518 --> 00:07:53,564
The powers that be are pretty capable.

115
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:57,592
Give 'em a little time, and they'll
snuff out the Path of Peace rebellion too.

116
00:07:57,679 --> 00:07:59,345
And when they do it, it won't be pretty.

117
00:08:01,768 --> 00:08:04,374
And that's where the Revolutionary Army comes in.

118
00:08:04,861 --> 00:08:06,626
We're allied with a tribe in the west

119
00:08:06,726 --> 00:08:10,782
that's set to begin their invasion the
moment the religious uprising starts to move.

120
00:08:11,502 --> 00:08:16,370
When they do, the empire will be forced to
defend itself on both sides of the border.

121
00:08:16,665 --> 00:08:18,620
But that won't be enough to bring it down.

122
00:08:18,813 --> 00:08:20,330
So for the finishing blow,

123
00:08:20,644 --> 00:08:23,901
the Revolutionary Army will stage a riot in the south.

124
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:25,934
As soon as we march into the capital,

125
00:08:26,155 --> 00:08:28,293
we'll bring the empire to its knees.

126
00:08:28,393 --> 00:08:29,259
Now I get it.

127
00:08:29,557 --> 00:08:31,285
We're planning a three-way offensive.

128
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:34,315
The empire has a long history of underestimating us.

129
00:08:34,522 --> 00:08:39,197
And now, they're grateful to the Revolution for
gathering all the people who oppose them into one place.

130
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:43,004
The Revolutionary Army's stronghold
is located at the empire's border.

131
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:47,023
They'll have to break through a lot of checkpoints
along the way to get to the Imperial Castle.

132
00:08:47,369 --> 00:08:51,889
Lucky for us, we're already in secret
talks with several of the castle viceroys.

133
00:08:52,181 --> 00:08:56,292
Many of them used to work diligently at
Central only to wind up getting relegated.

134
00:08:56,965 --> 00:08:58,844
So they were happy to cooperate.

135
00:08:59,319 --> 00:09:00,886
It should be quite a sight!

136
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:06,259
Our forces will storm the capital and claim castle
after castle without spilling an ounce of blood.

137
00:09:06,664 --> 00:09:10,322
Of course, the empire will probably respond by sending

138
00:09:10,346 --> 00:09:12,914
their trump cards: Great
General Budo and the Royal Guards.

139
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,426
But that'll drain the palace
defenses, which works in our favor.

140
00:09:16,549 --> 00:09:20,110
Making it the perfect time to
assassinate the source of all this.

141
00:09:21,281 --> 00:09:23,596
We'll charge into the Imperial Palace head-on,

142
00:09:23,682 --> 00:09:25,089
and we'll kill the minister!

143
00:09:26,034 --> 00:09:28,091
Rip the empire apart from the inside!

144
00:09:28,116 --> 00:09:32,041
The minister's pretty slick, so I'm sure
he'll try to sneak away at the very last second.

145
00:09:32,066 --> 00:09:34,652
Not if I can help it! This is his mess.

146
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:37,381
And I'll make sure he pays for it with his face.

147
00:09:37,734 --> 00:09:39,348
We do have debts to pay.

148
00:09:39,373 --> 00:09:43,479
We promised the western tribe we would return
their land in exchange for their assistance.

149
00:09:43,832 --> 00:09:44,659
"Return"?

150
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:49,875
Some parts of the empire's western territory
were originally owned by foreign tribes.

151
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:53,337
I know how desperately they must want that land back.

152
00:09:54,165 --> 00:09:55,432
Oh yeah, I forgot.

153
00:09:55,672 --> 00:09:58,175
Half of Mine's blood comes from a western tribe.

154
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:03,034
After the empire falls and its laws are
abolished, the people's anger will subside.

155
00:10:03,214 --> 00:10:05,742
And the quicker we can overthrow the imperial capital,

156
00:10:06,102 --> 00:10:08,106
the less blood will have to be spilt.

157
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,068
Is that all right with you, Tatsumi?

158
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,948
Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry I interrupted you.

159
00:10:13,973 --> 00:10:14,919
Now then...

160
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,838
You should know there's just
one problem with the Path of Peace,

161
00:10:17,979 --> 00:10:19,178
and it's a pretty big one.

162
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:29,235
A man named Bolic serves as the assistant
to the charismatic figure they call their lord.

163
00:10:29,308 --> 00:10:32,277
However, he's actually a spy sent by the minister.

164
00:10:33,012 --> 00:10:38,329
Bolic seeks to take control from the religion's founder
and prevent the church from rebelling against the empire.

165
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:40,610
So here's what I'd like you to do.

166
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,587
Sneak into the Path of Peace headquarters and kill Bolic.

167
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,452
He's also been secretly drugging his
followers through their food, a little at a time,

168
00:10:49,512 --> 00:10:52,407
getting them addicted and making them into his slaves.

169
00:10:52,593 --> 00:10:54,134
Don't go easy on him.

170
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:58,003
So that bastard gets to hop
around from one hot girl to the next!

171
00:10:58,028 --> 00:11:01,619
And slipping things into someone's meal
is an unspeakable insult to the food!

172
00:11:01,644 --> 00:11:03,321
This guy is going down!

173
00:11:03,407 --> 00:11:06,840
Nice enthusiasm, but I think
it might be a little misplaced.

174
00:11:07,114 --> 00:11:10,719
If we don't do something soon, he's
gonna keep drugging more and more people.

175
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,068
We need to finish this fast.

176
00:11:13,093 --> 00:11:15,227
We can't forget about the Jaegers either.

177
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:20,363
As long as they have Esdeath calling the shots,
they might as well be the minister's own private army.

178
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,371
We should eliminate them first.

179
00:11:22,645 --> 00:11:25,195
That way we can be sure the mission runs smoothly.

180
00:11:25,772 --> 00:11:29,719
Right now, the Jaegers are doing everything
in their power to get their hands on us.

181
00:11:29,744 --> 00:11:33,533
So we need to draw them out of the
capital... and strike them all down!

182
00:11:33,573 --> 00:11:36,585
Sounds fun! Let's hit those jerk-wads with all we've got!

183
00:11:37,513 --> 00:11:43,001
If the opportunity presents itself, HQ
specifically wants us to kill Bols and Kurome.

184
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,622
You should be able to fight people you're familiar with,

185
00:11:45,647 --> 00:11:46,724
right, Tatsumi?

186
00:11:47,524 --> 00:11:50,648
Wave was a good guy, and he's not one of our targets,

187
00:11:50,768 --> 00:11:52,526
so it's not like I have a reason to hurt him.

188
00:11:53,978 --> 00:11:56,863
But if I know Wave, he'll do anything
to protect the rest of his team.

189
00:11:57,632 --> 00:11:59,456
So I'll probably have to face him anyway.

190
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,337
Above all else, I'm an assassin.

191
00:12:02,675 --> 00:12:04,168
I chose this for myself,

192
00:12:04,414 --> 00:12:07,263
and I knew exactly what I was
getting into when I decided to join.

193
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:08,862
I'll do what must be done.

194
00:12:09,248 --> 00:12:12,705
I will complete this mission, even if I
have to kill someone who's not a target!

195
00:12:12,812 --> 00:12:14,071
I won't hold back!

196
00:12:18,423 --> 00:12:19,126
Good!

197
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,011
I can feel the resolve in those eyes of his.

198
00:12:22,864 --> 00:12:26,361
Hopefully, he won't get all sympathetic
for the enemy and get himself killed.

199
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,020
Wait, what?

200
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,375
Why am I always troubling myself with Tatsumi?

201
00:12:34,682 --> 00:12:35,391
It's like,

202
00:12:36,111 --> 00:12:38,211
I can't help but worry about him.

203
00:12:47,532 --> 00:12:48,252
Commander.

204
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,349
Two unidentified women have been spotted on the Highroad.

205
00:12:52,415 --> 00:12:55,793
We have reason to suspect they're
Akame and Mine from Night Raid.

206
00:13:00,806 --> 00:13:02,850
Gather the Jaegers immediately.

207
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:09,844
All people must one day turn to
ash, so too must nations fall to ruin.

208
00:13:10,103 --> 00:13:13,103
There are those who seek to create a new world,

209
00:13:13,176 --> 00:13:16,093
and those who wish to protect the world they know.

210
00:13:16,499 --> 00:13:19,228
With opposing ideals and philosophies,

211
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,709
the two forces are drawn by fate

212
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:24,822
to their inevitable confrontation.

213
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,558
With deadly armaments in their hands

214
00:13:27,698 --> 00:13:30,215
and determination in their hearts,

215
00:13:30,305 --> 00:13:33,520
they march toward their final battle.

216
00:13:47,138 --> 00:13:48,278
It's the Jaegers.

217
00:13:48,591 --> 00:13:52,224
All six of them, headed east.
Everything's exactly as Najenda planned.

218
00:13:53,564 --> 00:13:54,888
All right, marg falcon,

219
00:13:55,185 --> 00:13:57,127
get this information to Night Raid. Go.

220
00:13:59,675 --> 00:14:03,219
So the plan is to murder a leader of
the church and challenge the Jaegers.

221
00:14:03,652 --> 00:14:05,552
They're gonna need all the luck they can get.

222
00:14:06,842 --> 00:14:08,800
I hope you survive, Night Raid!

223
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:10,119
We need you.

224
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,992
We need you to help set this world right again.

225
00:14:14,944 --> 00:14:16,260
Six of them, huh?

226
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,725
That means they've sent out the whole team.

227
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:22,700
Considering how fast Esdeath tends to move,

228
00:14:22,967 --> 00:14:25,921
even if she has to ask around a
little to find out where we are,

229
00:14:26,034 --> 00:14:28,042
I bet she'll be here by tomorrow afternoon.

230
00:14:31,433 --> 00:14:32,295
All set.

231
00:14:33,894 --> 00:14:36,711
I've just received word from the revolutionary spies.

232
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:38,042
As I said before,

233
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:40,643
try to casually draw attention to yourselves today.

234
00:14:40,745 --> 00:14:41,590
Roger that.

235
00:14:44,807 --> 00:14:49,628
Aww, yeah! I can't believe we get to
watch the girls bounce around in bikinis!

236
00:14:49,967 --> 00:14:51,452
Can you control yourself?

237
00:14:51,547 --> 00:14:53,664
Try to focus, dude. This is all part of the mission.

238
00:14:53,698 --> 00:14:56,037
What?! Are you crazy?! Or impotent?!

239
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,276
Neither jackass!

240
00:14:57,301 --> 00:14:58,134
Tatsumi!

241
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,455
We'd like your opinion about something.

242
00:15:00,662 --> 00:15:02,898
Do you like my swimsuit or Chelsea's better?

243
00:15:02,923 --> 00:15:04,963
Ooh, careful how you answer that!

244
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,089
So? Which is it?

245
00:15:08,349 --> 00:15:10,554
Uh, let's see, I, uh...

246
00:15:10,817 --> 00:15:12,483
Would ya look at that, Su's here!

247
00:15:12,508 --> 00:15:13,827
How ya doin' there, buddy?!

248
00:15:14,185 --> 00:15:16,199
Aww, he dodged the question.

249
00:15:16,224 --> 00:15:19,689
Why didn't you ask me? I would have
given you an honest, non-biased critique

250
00:15:19,713 --> 00:15:23,080
and said both are amazing and beautiful, and
I wanna just touch 'em and squeeze 'em forever!

251
00:15:23,138 --> 00:15:24,471
Why didn't you ask me?!

252
00:15:24,512 --> 00:15:27,107
'Cause we already knew what you would say, dumb-ass!

253
00:15:27,949 --> 00:15:30,584
She's right. It means nothing coming from you! Sorry.

254
00:15:30,624 --> 00:15:31,825
What's that supposed to mean?!

255
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,692
Why does Tatsumi get all the action?

256
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:34,585
Why?!

257
00:15:34,609 --> 00:15:35,798
Why do you think?!

258
00:15:35,823 --> 00:15:39,835
Great, the rest of the team is having the
time of their lives down there on the beach.

259
00:15:39,979 --> 00:15:43,958
Ah, man, this is bullcrap. How
come they get to have all the fun?

260
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,878
Are you doing okay, Akame?

261
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,863
Oh, I'm fine.

262
00:15:52,455 --> 00:15:55,164
Guess you're probably thinking
about your sister, aren't you?

263
00:15:59,302 --> 00:15:59,980
Yeah.

264
00:16:02,643 --> 00:16:05,379
I know she'll be coming after me sooner or later,

265
00:16:05,703 --> 00:16:07,913
so my thoughts are all over the place right now.

266
00:16:11,745 --> 00:16:12,330
I...

267
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:15,713
Uh, Mine?

268
00:16:16,306 --> 00:16:17,946
Once your sister is gone,

269
00:16:18,053 --> 00:16:21,043
you'll need to find a way to
remember that you're not alone.

270
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:22,291
Okay?

271
00:16:23,154 --> 00:16:24,868
You still have us, you know.

272
00:16:24,893 --> 00:16:26,845
You should be grateful for that.

273
00:16:29,425 --> 00:16:30,180
Thanks.

274
00:16:32,235 --> 00:16:35,423
Najenda is still heading east,
and Akame went to the south.

275
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:40,441
We have witnesses who testify that the two of
them came to town together but left separately.

276
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:41,393
You can have a little treat later.

277
00:16:41,504 --> 00:16:45,598
If they're going east, they'll reach
the Path of Peace headquarters in Kyoroku.

278
00:16:45,623 --> 00:16:49,312
If they go south, they'll be in a city
that supports the Revolutionary Army.

279
00:16:49,337 --> 00:16:51,335
Either way, it's very suspicious.

280
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,445
We can cut them off if we move quickly.

281
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,303
Let's go!

282
00:16:54,328 --> 00:16:55,706
Not so fast, Wave.

283
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:58,045
Night Raid is well-known around the capital.

284
00:16:58,638 --> 00:17:01,426
And they're fully aware of the
wanted posters around the city.

285
00:17:01,451 --> 00:17:04,463
Our guards have been able to
track them ever since they showed up.

286
00:17:04,688 --> 00:17:07,889
So, why exactly would they allow themselves to be seen?

287
00:17:08,471 --> 00:17:10,025
It feels too easy.

288
00:17:10,157 --> 00:17:12,979
Right. That's why I think it's probably a trap.

289
00:17:13,254 --> 00:17:15,082
They must have wanted us to see them.

290
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:18,243
They were trying to get us out of
the castle so they could defeat us.

291
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:21,145
That's the way Najenda fights,

292
00:17:21,503 --> 00:17:23,764
with a cool head and a burning heart.

293
00:17:23,871 --> 00:17:26,116
Are you saying it's too dangerous to follow her?

294
00:17:26,141 --> 00:17:28,165
Oh, no, she's not getting away.

295
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:33,715
After playing it safe and hiding for so long, Night
Raid has finally decided to come out into the open.

296
00:17:33,894 --> 00:17:35,756
I don't care if it is a trap.

297
00:17:35,856 --> 00:17:37,460
We'll destroy the trap too!

298
00:17:37,553 --> 00:17:39,943
Seryu, Run, you help me locate Najenda.

299
00:17:40,322 --> 00:17:42,920
Kurome, Wave, and Bols, go find Akame.

300
00:17:44,675 --> 00:17:46,830
Always be aware of your surroundings.

301
00:17:46,904 --> 00:17:49,205
If you feel there are too many of them lying in wait,

302
00:17:49,305 --> 00:17:50,745
you are free to retreat.

303
00:17:51,285 --> 00:17:54,379
Fight hard, but don't resort to suicide attacks.

304
00:17:55,099 --> 00:17:57,352
These are the last threats to the capital.

305
00:17:57,638 --> 00:18:00,130
Trap them in a corner and finish them off!

306
00:18:00,155 --> 00:18:01,055
Roger that!

307
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,955
We're about to face the toughest criminals in the capital.

308
00:18:08,248 --> 00:18:10,001
Do you think I'll match up against them?

309
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:11,421
Yeah, you'll be okay!

310
00:18:11,654 --> 00:18:14,279
I already fought against a
member of Night Raid once before.

311
00:18:14,738 --> 00:18:16,548
For some reason, he wouldn't fight back.

312
00:18:16,948 --> 00:18:20,008
But I still got the impression
we were pretty much evenly matched.

313
00:18:20,563 --> 00:18:22,675
I'm sure we can win if we work together!

314
00:18:23,195 --> 00:18:25,954
Luckily your weapon is good for
fighting multiple people at once.

315
00:18:26,237 --> 00:18:27,510
You're gonna be a big help.

316
00:18:28,189 --> 00:18:29,536
I sure hope so.

317
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:34,451
You're really sweet and all for saying that, Wave, but
you're probably the most worthless member of the group.

318
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:37,988
What?! Are you trying to tell me
you don't think I have what it takes?!

319
00:18:38,013 --> 00:18:40,690
Seems pretty obvious. You won't last five minutes.

320
00:18:40,715 --> 00:18:43,349
Well, you've obviously never seen me use my Imperial Arms!

321
00:18:43,374 --> 00:18:44,849
Why don't you show it to me, then!

322
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,601
Oooh, now you're asking for it!

323
00:18:46,633 --> 00:18:47,259
So let's see it!

324
00:18:47,284 --> 00:18:49,006
Please don't argue, you guys.

325
00:18:50,665 --> 00:18:52,831
Hey, look. What the heck is that?

326
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,917
Some sorta scarecrow?

327
00:18:54,942 --> 00:18:55,779
I think so.

328
00:18:56,126 --> 00:18:58,308
Once again, very suspicious.

329
00:18:58,521 --> 00:19:00,020
Something isn't right here.

330
00:19:00,335 --> 00:19:02,128
Okay, guys, keep your eyes open.

331
00:19:04,649 --> 00:19:07,330
Targets in sight. I only see three.

332
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:09,635
Esdeath must have split the team in half.

333
00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:12,112
I guess she couldn't resist going after the boss.

334
00:19:12,782 --> 00:19:14,449
The plan seems to be working.

335
00:19:19,582 --> 00:19:21,494
She looks so much like Akame.

336
00:19:21,849 --> 00:19:23,291
You can tell they're related.

337
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:26,763
Which is exactly why Akame
shouldn't be the one to kill her.

338
00:19:27,449 --> 00:19:28,354
All I need...

339
00:19:28,848 --> 00:19:31,409
is one clean shot.

340
00:19:39,202 --> 00:19:40,395
She dodged that?!

341
00:19:41,126 --> 00:19:43,168
That kind of speed isn't even possible!

342
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:48,919
Look out!

343
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:55,085
Wave?!

344
00:19:55,532 --> 00:19:58,698
Well, the sniper may have missed,
but at least we got rid of one of you.

345
00:19:59,362 --> 00:20:03,077
Oddly enough, that poor unfortunate
fellow wasn't even on our hit list.

346
00:20:03,561 --> 00:20:04,532
Night Raid?

347
00:20:04,767 --> 00:20:06,547
And the entire team is together?!

348
00:20:07,142 --> 00:20:09,149
So the other group was a decoy.

349
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,682
Kurome and Bols...

350
00:20:10,782 --> 00:20:13,961
You have been selected as prime targets among the Jaegers.

351
00:20:14,022 --> 00:20:15,534
Get ready to die!

352
00:20:15,635 --> 00:20:16,591
Targets?

353
00:20:17,661 --> 00:20:20,096
I've burned countless people alive,

354
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:23,331
so I always knew a reckoning would come for me one day.

355
00:20:25,935 --> 00:20:26,706
However...

356
00:20:27,792 --> 00:20:30,351
I cannot allow myself to die.

357
00:20:32,682 --> 00:20:33,930
Big Sister!

358
00:20:34,855 --> 00:20:35,939
Hello, Kurome.

359
00:20:36,082 --> 00:20:39,240
I've been dying to see you again! How nice!

360
00:20:40,942 --> 00:20:42,846
If I kill you myself,

361
00:20:43,335 --> 00:20:46,140
then I can add you to Yatsufusa's collection.

362
00:20:46,165 --> 00:20:48,099
Now wouldn't that be just wonderful?

363
00:21:04,675 --> 00:21:05,860
Is this an earthquake?

364
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,915
I've improved a lot since last we met.

365
00:21:11,259 --> 00:21:14,050
Now I can command any corpse I choose.

366
00:21:16,497 --> 00:21:17,632
Pretty neat, right?

367
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,824
I mean, look at this.

368
00:21:27,849 --> 00:21:31,213
I can even control S-Class Danger Beast Desta Ghoul.

369
00:21:31,631 --> 00:21:34,724
I took a gamble on whether
Esdeath would split up her party.

370
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:40,810
Now I see why she did. If she's using Yatsufusa,
it'll take more than a little trap to throw her off.

371
00:21:41,044 --> 00:21:41,949
How fun...

372
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:44,532
a battle between Imperial Arms.

373
00:21:49,055 --> 00:21:51,782
How many do you think will die?
