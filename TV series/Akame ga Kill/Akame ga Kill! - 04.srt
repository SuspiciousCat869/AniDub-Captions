1
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:12,488
Please! Don't kill me!

2
00:00:12,575 --> 00:00:14,144
No can do, sweetie,

3
00:00:14,495 --> 00:00:17,312
this is what you two get for being out at this hour.

4
00:00:17,686 --> 00:00:22,720
Didn't your parents ever teach you that
dangerous men roam the streets at night? Hm?

5
00:00:23,081 --> 00:00:25,103
Please let me go.

6
00:00:25,243 --> 00:00:27,078
I'll do anything you want!

7
00:00:27,103 --> 00:00:30,162
Is that so? Well, I'm a bit of a talker.

8
00:00:30,566 --> 00:00:32,079
Will you have a little chat with me?

9
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:34,651
Yes! I will! I'll talk!

10
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:35,545
Great!

11
00:00:35,728 --> 00:00:38,728
Then tell me, how does it feel to be without a body?

12
00:00:40,075 --> 00:00:42,430
What's wrong, feeling torn?

13
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:47,612
Mmm, simply delightful!

14
00:00:48,076 --> 00:00:50,200
The perfect end to a perfect day!

15
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,329
That's enough for me, Bro.

16
00:02:40,576 --> 00:02:41,642
My arms really hurt.

17
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:43,015
Hm?

18
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:47,685
Come on! You've still got some excess
movement in those muscles of yours.

19
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,042
Just concentrate.

20
00:02:51,176 --> 00:02:52,876
You have to sharpen up your focus.

21
00:02:52,969 --> 00:02:56,858
If you can cut out all that extra movement
you'll be able to hang in there twice as long.

22
00:02:58,730 --> 00:02:59,848
I got it...

23
00:03:00,095 --> 00:03:02,599
You'll be an unstoppable force before you know it.

24
00:03:02,624 --> 00:03:04,116
You just need a firm touch.

25
00:03:04,141 --> 00:03:05,240
Oh... OH!

26
00:03:05,296 --> 00:03:05,935
Tatsumi.

27
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:09,996
It's time for you to help me make breakfast.

28
00:03:11,369 --> 00:03:12,240
Ah!

29
00:03:13,203 --> 00:03:13,713
Hm...

30
00:03:16,012 --> 00:03:16,865
What are we making?

31
00:03:17,593 --> 00:03:19,363
It's croquettes and rice.

32
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,171
Croquettes and rice for breakfast?

33
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,250
She really is a psychopath.

34
00:03:24,242 --> 00:03:26,318
Whooo! That hit the spot!

35
00:03:26,343 --> 00:03:28,391
Ah gawd. My poor stomach.

36
00:03:29,016 --> 00:03:29,715
Hold on.

37
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,097
Are Mine and Sheele still in bed?

38
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,567
Yeah. They always sleep this late.

39
00:03:39,963 --> 00:03:43,442
I just witnessed the speed of a true assassin. No doubt.

40
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,667
Tatsumi.

41
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:47,181
We'll be serving tuna and rice for lunch.

42
00:03:47,406 --> 00:03:49,137
Akame, behind you...

43
00:03:49,488 --> 00:03:52,533
Hm? What happened to my breakfast?

44
00:03:55,523 --> 00:03:57,785
You did well. What about the others?

45
00:03:57,931 --> 00:04:01,164
I think I'm the only one who was able to make it this far.

46
00:04:01,264 --> 00:04:02,021
I see.

47
00:04:02,464 --> 00:04:06,637
This is a list of everyone in power
who swears to help us when we rally.

48
00:04:06,697 --> 00:04:08,211
It's in my hands now.

49
00:04:08,421 --> 00:04:09,741
You can rest easy.

50
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:13,391
Please, help the revolution...

51
00:04:16,044 --> 00:04:18,064
Right. I promise.

52
00:04:19,121 --> 00:04:22,533
Your next target is the serial
killer everyone's been talking about.

53
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:27,023
He appears at night and decapitates
people seemingly at random.

54
00:04:27,664 --> 00:04:30,093
Right now, the number of victims is unknown.

55
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:33,290
I'm pretty sure a third of the
people he killed were guards...

56
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:34,278
must be strong.

57
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:35,422
No doubt about it;

58
00:04:35,447 --> 00:04:37,639
Definitely sounds like Headhunter Zanku's work.

59
00:04:37,892 --> 00:04:39,625
Huh? Who's Zanku?

60
00:04:39,824 --> 00:04:40,783
You don't know?!

61
00:04:40,896 --> 00:04:43,291
Wow, you really are from the sticks, aren't you?

62
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:46,457
Sorry, but I don't think I've ever heard of him either.

63
00:04:46,517 --> 00:04:49,030
Seriously, you probably just forgot, Sheele.

64
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:49,789
Ahh...

65
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,640
Okay, so what's so terrible about this guy anyway?

66
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,759
It's worse than you can imagine.

67
00:04:56,187 --> 00:05:00,546
Headhunter Zanku used to be the executioner
at the biggest prison in the Empire.

68
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:04,070
The Minister orders a lot of decapitations.

69
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,417
Over and over, day in and day out.

70
00:05:08,817 --> 00:05:10,064
And one by one,

71
00:05:10,245 --> 00:05:13,560
Zanku chopped off their heads
as they begged for their lives.

72
00:05:14,109 --> 00:05:16,131
Over the years it became an addiction...

73
00:05:16,486 --> 00:05:18,034
and now he can't stop.

74
00:05:19,064 --> 00:05:20,796
That's enough to drive anyone crazy.

75
00:05:21,295 --> 00:05:25,862
Uh-huh. And eventually killing prisoners wasn't
enough anymore, so he took it to the streets.

76
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:29,913
Zanku disappeared shortly after a
subjugation force was organized to catch him.

77
00:05:30,366 --> 00:05:32,529
I never thought he would turn up in the city.

78
00:05:32,983 --> 00:05:34,567
Then what are we waiting for.

79
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,601
Let's take this bastard out!

80
00:05:36,626 --> 00:05:38,137
Whoa, easy, tiger!

81
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:39,006
Yeah, but...

82
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:43,655
Zanku's also equipped with an Imperial
Arms he stole from the warden a few years ago.

83
00:05:44,317 --> 00:05:46,297
We'd better travel in teams of two...

84
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,039
in case it's a rough ride.

85
00:05:48,064 --> 00:05:50,605
Jeez, why did he have to say it like that?

86
00:05:51,004 --> 00:05:52,003
By the way...

87
00:05:52,155 --> 00:05:55,794
do we have any idea which Imperial
Arms he might be fighting with?

88
00:05:55,905 --> 00:05:57,872
No, we're still looking into that.

89
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,662
Not about to reveal his hand then, is he?

90
00:06:00,952 --> 00:06:01,972
That's annoying.

91
00:06:02,165 --> 00:06:05,584
So uh... what IS an Imperial Arms anyway?

92
00:06:05,609 --> 00:06:06,230
Ah!

93
00:06:06,405 --> 00:06:07,739
Something like this.

94
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,646
That's... not that helpful.

95
00:06:09,955 --> 00:06:11,167
Very well then.

96
00:06:11,274 --> 00:06:13,334
Why don't we get Tatsumi up to speed?

97
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,239
A thousand years ago,

98
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:19,470
the Emperor who built the
Great Empire was deeply troubled.

99
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:24,639
I wish I could defend this nation until
the end of time, but someday I will die.

100
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:30,506
However, weaponry and armor can
last generation after generation.

101
00:06:30,832 --> 00:06:35,367
We will combine our wisdom and create
weapons to protect my empire forever!

102
00:06:36,207 --> 00:06:39,288
He gathered materials from S-Class Danger Beasts

103
00:06:40,181 --> 00:06:42,576
and rare metals such as Orichalcum.

104
00:06:43,282 --> 00:06:46,232
Artisans from around the world were summoned to help him.

105
00:06:47,285 --> 00:06:51,100
The Emperor's wealth and power
allowed him to forge 48 weapons-

106
00:06:51,306 --> 00:06:53,348
a feat that would be impossible today.

107
00:06:54,317 --> 00:06:57,056
He called them the "Imperial Arms."

108
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,953
Each one is equipped with amazing abilities,

109
00:07:00,113 --> 00:07:02,799
and some are able to wipe out entire armies.

110
00:07:03,747 --> 00:07:08,116
Ministers who used the Imperial Arms
were quite successful on the battlefield.

111
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:16,135
But a large civil war 500 years ago caused nearly
half of the weapons to be scattered across the land.

112
00:07:17,734 --> 00:07:19,974
And that's how it all began.

113
00:07:20,433 --> 00:07:23,402
Is Akame's sword really one of those 48 weapons?

114
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,269
The One-Hit Killer: Murasame.

115
00:07:27,633 --> 00:07:32,910
When someone is cut by this sword, a poisonous
curse enters the body and kills within seconds.

116
00:07:33,236 --> 00:07:34,602
There is no antidote.

117
00:07:35,161 --> 00:07:38,132
Hundred-Beast King Transformation Lionel.

118
00:07:38,179 --> 00:07:42,198
This belt gives the wearer all the
strength and swiftness of a wild animal.

119
00:07:42,413 --> 00:07:44,637
It also enhances the sense of smell,

120
00:07:45,004 --> 00:07:46,777
making it perfect for recon.

121
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,545
The Adventurous Bunker, Pumpkin.

122
00:07:50,004 --> 00:07:53,084
A gun that fires mental energy in the form of a shockwave.

123
00:07:53,743 --> 00:07:55,612
The more danger its wielder is in,

124
00:07:55,729 --> 00:07:57,452
the more deadly it becomes.

125
00:07:58,587 --> 00:08:00,715
The Demon Armor, Incursio.

126
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,836
A suit of armor with impregnable defense.

127
00:08:04,316 --> 00:08:09,428
Wearing it causes such great strain that any
normal person who attempts to put it on will die.

128
00:08:10,325 --> 00:08:12,039
The Protean Cross-Tail.

129
00:08:12,565 --> 00:08:16,705
A string-based Imperial Arms that
can be used to set traps and barriers,

130
00:08:16,937 --> 00:08:18,983
as well as attack enemies directly.

131
00:08:19,136 --> 00:08:22,366
It's just as versatile and dangerous as the name suggests.

132
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,416
The Shears of Creation, Extase.

133
00:08:26,635 --> 00:08:30,212
A giant pair of scissors sharp
enough to cut anything in half.

134
00:08:30,926 --> 00:08:33,825
They are also strong enough to be used defensively.

135
00:08:34,678 --> 00:08:37,726
Some Imperial Arms also have trump cards.

136
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:41,820
Incursio maximizes the abilities
of the beast used to create it,

137
00:08:41,845 --> 00:08:44,740
allowing its user to become temporarily invisible.

138
00:08:45,544 --> 00:08:46,712
Most importantly...

139
00:08:47,056 --> 00:08:51,398
the Imperial Arms have followed one
iron-clad rule from time immemorial.

140
00:08:52,186 --> 00:08:56,145
These weapons are so incredible
that whenever two of them clash,

141
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,247
it always ends in death.

142
00:08:59,313 --> 00:09:05,362
Therefore, if two Imperial Arms users choose
to fight... one of them will definitely perish.

143
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,943
We know Zanku has an Imperial Arms.

144
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,773
While mutual death is a possibility,
mutual survival is clearly not.

145
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,410
Okay, I see...

146
00:09:15,781 --> 00:09:19,729
Uh-oh! Looks like we've revealed
way too much to let you outta here now.

147
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:23,250
So unless you wanna die, I guess
you're just stuck with us for life.

148
00:09:23,277 --> 00:09:24,456
Uh... yeah!

149
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,095
That's a good thing, Tatsumi.

150
00:09:26,327 --> 00:09:29,129
It means that the Boss considers
you a part of the team now.

151
00:09:29,428 --> 00:09:34,437
While it's true that Night Raid is lacking in
numbers we make up for it with our individual abilities.

152
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:37,355
I believe we're the heart of the revolution.

153
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,472
What about me?

154
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,552
Do I get one?

155
00:09:39,781 --> 00:09:43,489
What?! You really think we have
a weapon we can just give you?

156
00:09:43,514 --> 00:09:44,881
Huh? You don't?

157
00:09:45,441 --> 00:09:50,196
Haha... If the opportunity arises, I'm
sure you'll be getting your own soon enough.

158
00:09:50,221 --> 00:09:50,953
Hm...

159
00:09:51,607 --> 00:09:53,253
Nothing further at this time.

160
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,238
Now let's go punish this scumbag. Move out!

161
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,172
Roger that!

162
00:10:03,224 --> 00:10:05,690
This is the area we're supposed to be checking out.

163
00:10:06,444 --> 00:10:09,803
All the locals are so terrified of
Zanku that they're staying inside.

164
00:10:09,891 --> 00:10:10,958
But he could still get-

165
00:10:12,703 --> 00:10:13,979
Keep an eye out for guards.

166
00:10:14,003 --> 00:10:14,491
Hm-hm...

167
00:10:15,646 --> 00:10:17,719
Hey, Akame, can I ask you something?

168
00:10:17,871 --> 00:10:18,741
Not to worry.

169
00:10:19,024 --> 00:10:21,065
I made sure to bring enough food for both of us.

170
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,333
Oh... no, not that.

171
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:25,975
Is it true that your sword kills with one strike?

172
00:10:26,591 --> 00:10:27,345
That's right.

173
00:10:29,271 --> 00:10:32,146
Oh, man... it's a miracle I'm even alive right now.

174
00:10:32,334 --> 00:10:34,786
I've been using Murasame for a very long time...

175
00:10:34,952 --> 00:10:39,353
and over the past few years it's built
a reputation as the "One-Hit Kill Sword".

176
00:10:39,392 --> 00:10:40,705
Shouldn't that be a secret?

177
00:10:41,238 --> 00:10:43,571
Well I guess it's invincible either way though, huh?

178
00:10:43,939 --> 00:10:46,422
No. It still has some drawbacks.

179
00:10:46,705 --> 00:10:47,921
Some drawbacks?

180
00:10:48,046 --> 00:10:49,880
It's almost impossible to clean.

181
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,426
If I cut my finger, I'm dead.

182
00:10:53,764 --> 00:10:58,051
I must cut directly into my opponent's
flesh or the curse won't get into the body.

183
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:02,113
It must be tough if the enemy's
got thick armor. Like Bro does.

184
00:11:02,732 --> 00:11:05,238
For me everything depends on one-hit-kills.

185
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:08,890
That's why I can't afford to
rely on just my Imperial Arms.

186
00:11:08,944 --> 00:11:11,838
Akame is probably somewhere near the same age as me...

187
00:11:12,751 --> 00:11:16,084
but I have to wonder how many
battles she's already had to fight?

188
00:11:17,972 --> 00:11:19,230
Hmm!

189
00:11:19,316 --> 00:11:23,501
Now we have some assassins and a serial
killer running loose in the Capital.

190
00:11:24,464 --> 00:11:26,797
My, what a jungle this city can be!

191
00:11:27,095 --> 00:11:28,527
How exciting!

192
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:31,402
Good evening, Night Raid!

193
00:11:31,748 --> 00:11:34,727
I wonder, which head should I go after first?

194
00:11:35,215 --> 00:11:38,830
Ooh, look at the sense of purpose in those eyes!

195
00:11:39,161 --> 00:11:40,270
I'm impressed.

196
00:11:41,308 --> 00:11:42,594
I know what I'll do!

197
00:11:42,788 --> 00:11:45,348
I'll go after the tastiest morsels first.

198
00:11:46,168 --> 00:11:48,698
It's not like he's just gonna waltz right up to us.

199
00:11:49,061 --> 00:11:50,995
Guess all we can really do is be patient.

200
00:11:51,435 --> 00:11:51,815
Uh...

201
00:11:52,555 --> 00:11:53,382
I'll be right back.

202
00:11:54,026 --> 00:11:55,214
Is nature calling?

203
00:11:59,235 --> 00:12:00,562
I must be nervous.

204
00:12:01,308 --> 00:12:01,877
Huh?

205
00:12:06,428 --> 00:12:07,313
Sayo!

206
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:10,219
Hey! Where're ya going?!

207
00:12:10,808 --> 00:12:12,334
What's taking so long?

208
00:12:22,834 --> 00:12:25,587
I can't believe it. It's really you!

209
00:12:26,255 --> 00:12:28,155
I-I thought you were dead.

210
00:12:28,668 --> 00:12:30,582
Thank God, you're okay.

211
00:12:31,341 --> 00:12:33,363
Oh how touching!

212
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:33,882
Uh?

213
00:12:34,108 --> 00:12:36,675
I must've shown you something very nice.

214
00:12:36,801 --> 00:12:37,248
Oh?

215
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,748
Good evening, my friend.

216
00:12:39,821 --> 00:12:42,578
Wh-what the hell did you do with Sayo?!

217
00:12:42,772 --> 00:12:45,295
I would prefer you to call me a different name...

218
00:12:45,961 --> 00:12:47,715
and please say it with love.

219
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,400
My name is Headhunter Zanku.

220
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,182
So you're the one.

221
00:12:52,595 --> 00:12:54,102
I've been looking for you.

222
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,242
"Uh-oh! Looks like he managed
to separate me from the others!"

223
00:13:00,342 --> 00:13:02,475
"Maybe I'll be able to stall him for a minute!"

224
00:13:02,535 --> 00:13:03,796
Is that what you're thinking?

225
00:13:05,008 --> 00:13:06,780
Did he just read my mind?!

226
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:09,810
That must be his Imperial Arms.

227
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:11,236
Bingo!

228
00:13:11,328 --> 00:13:13,442
You're right, it's called Spectator.

229
00:13:13,508 --> 00:13:16,408
And one of its five special gifts is known as "Insight."

230
00:13:16,508 --> 00:13:20,654
It allows me to read your every thought
by gazing at your facial expressions.

231
00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:24,292
Obviously, it's blessed me
with keen powers of observation.

232
00:13:24,317 --> 00:13:27,613
Should I give you a shiny gold
star for guessing correctly?

233
00:13:27,638 --> 00:13:31,038
Don't bother! And you can stop talking any time now!

234
00:13:31,063 --> 00:13:33,785
Oh no, I love a good chit-chat.

235
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,550
Do you want to know how I managed to find you?

236
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:38,777
No matter how dark or how foggy it is,

237
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:42,096
my "Far-Sight" can see clearly for miles!

238
00:13:43,075 --> 00:13:44,311
Delightful!

239
00:13:44,577 --> 00:13:47,992
Did you think you could land a
hit if you attacked me mid-monologue?

240
00:13:48,242 --> 00:13:49,358
Only one problem.

241
00:13:49,383 --> 00:13:51,509
I'm still reading your mind like an open book;

242
00:13:51,534 --> 00:13:52,703
Have you forgotten that?

243
00:13:53,694 --> 00:13:56,500
First you're gonna come right at me with a downward slash!

244
00:13:57,442 --> 00:13:59,786
Then you're going to try your finishing move!

245
00:14:00,342 --> 00:14:03,005
Then try to fake me out and go straight for my throat!

246
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,557
Heh! You really are so predictable.

247
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,913
He's on a different level than anyone else I've faced!

248
00:14:14,095 --> 00:14:17,161
I love the look on people's
faces when I remove their heads...

249
00:14:17,186 --> 00:14:19,310
it never ceases to give me such a rush!

250
00:14:19,881 --> 00:14:21,478
The thing that gets me most.

251
00:14:21,671 --> 00:14:24,117
Is how they always look so surprised.

252
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:28,289
I wonder what kind of delightful expression you'll make?

253
00:14:29,561 --> 00:14:31,879
You're not gonna live long enough to find out!

254
00:14:32,722 --> 00:14:33,179
Huh?

255
00:14:34,254 --> 00:14:34,852
Tatsumi...

256
00:14:38,607 --> 00:14:41,891
Ooh, I do appreciate ambitious young people like you!

257
00:14:42,004 --> 00:14:46,552
In fact, I think you're gonna be a perfect
new addition to my collection of shrunken heads!

258
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:50,240
Just delightful!

259
00:14:50,521 --> 00:14:54,508
I must say I've really done a
number on that firm resolve of yours.

260
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:55,468
Agh... what?

261
00:14:55,742 --> 00:15:00,588
That pitiful sound of a "tough guy" like
you begging for mercy is music to my ears.

262
00:15:00,613 --> 00:15:03,112
That's why I'm compelled to take my time.

263
00:15:03,661 --> 00:15:06,202
Yes! Please feel free to beg!

264
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:09,899
Maybe you can buy enough time for your
little friend to catch up with you, eh?!

265
00:15:13,608 --> 00:15:14,947
Don't hold your breath.

266
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:19,072
You're just some filthy bastard who
gets his kicks from chopping off heads.

267
00:15:19,394 --> 00:15:22,105
There's no way in hell I'm begging you for anything!

268
00:15:23,641 --> 00:15:26,570
If he can read my mind, I'll have to keep things simple.

269
00:15:27,757 --> 00:15:29,273
I'll try one more attack...

270
00:15:29,641 --> 00:15:31,184
and give it everything I've got!

271
00:15:32,023 --> 00:15:34,605
Oh... aren't you courageous?

272
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,727
And you're in so much pain too!

273
00:15:36,986 --> 00:15:40,117
It's a good thing you're in the
hands of an expert executioner.

274
00:15:40,921 --> 00:15:41,721
This is it!

275
00:15:41,768 --> 00:15:42,272
Huh?

276
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:43,642
Ugh!

277
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:45,115
Ah!

278
00:15:46,215 --> 00:15:48,605
Uh! That little shit.

279
00:15:49,025 --> 00:15:50,889
He's quicker than I anticipated.

280
00:15:51,555 --> 00:15:53,728
Ha! It's about time I got one in.

281
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:54,555
Ugh!

282
00:15:55,365 --> 00:15:57,327
An expert executioner, huh?

283
00:15:58,127 --> 00:16:00,157
An expert wouldn't have missed my neck!

284
00:16:00,235 --> 00:16:02,266
Some Headhunter you turned out to be!

285
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,665
Shut your mouth!

286
00:16:14,914 --> 00:16:16,314
He looks pretty upset.

287
00:16:16,617 --> 00:16:19,175
You must've used some of your own psychological tactics.

288
00:16:19,275 --> 00:16:20,108
Akame!

289
00:16:20,283 --> 00:16:21,744
Glad I got here in time.

290
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:25,916
Just sit tight while I finish him off
and then I'll tend to those wounds of yours.

291
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:26,470
Hehe...

292
00:16:28,325 --> 00:16:32,368
Well if it isn't Akame and her infamous Murasame.

293
00:16:32,568 --> 00:16:35,275
How delightful! Nice to meet you, dear.

294
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,275
It's so nice to meet you as well.

295
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,901
Since you're my target.

296
00:16:39,283 --> 00:16:40,274
X-Ray!

297
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:44,448
Hmm... she's not concealing any weapons.

298
00:16:44,473 --> 00:16:46,462
Ugh... Be careful, Akame!

299
00:16:46,795 --> 00:16:48,667
That eyeball thing can read your mind!

300
00:16:48,921 --> 00:16:49,731
I see.

301
00:16:49,915 --> 00:16:53,317
I wondered which Imperial Arms he'd be using. No matter.

302
00:16:53,557 --> 00:16:56,063
It makes no difference whether he can read my mind,

303
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:57,454
if he can't keep up!

304
00:17:01,907 --> 00:17:04,532
He's good. He's seen his share of combat.

305
00:17:05,028 --> 00:17:08,060
She's not just fast, she's powerful too!

306
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:15,302
Wow, so this is what combat between
two Imperial Arms users is like.

307
00:17:16,232 --> 00:17:18,750
If he can read my mind, we're evenly matched.

308
00:17:19,576 --> 00:17:20,629
In that case...

309
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:25,699
Well done, you've cleared your mind!

310
00:17:26,127 --> 00:17:28,742
But Spectator has "Foresight" as well.

311
00:17:29,773 --> 00:17:32,103
I already know what your next move will be...

312
00:17:34,874 --> 00:17:35,863
Exactly!

313
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:36,296
Uh!

314
00:17:36,479 --> 00:17:37,191
Ah!

315
00:17:44,668 --> 00:17:46,679
He actually put a scratch on her!

316
00:17:46,812 --> 00:17:48,232
Come on, now!

317
00:17:48,338 --> 00:17:52,757
It wouldn't be very fair if I didn't get
to rough you up a little bit, now would it?

318
00:17:52,997 --> 00:17:55,652
You can see what I'm thinking and what I'm about to do.

319
00:17:56,145 --> 00:17:57,142
I'd say we're even.

320
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,993
So, Akame.

321
00:17:59,133 --> 00:18:01,230
Tell me, how do you deal with the voices?

322
00:18:01,255 --> 00:18:03,179
Huh? Voices?

323
00:18:04,185 --> 00:18:07,415
Listen! When it's quiet you can hear them.

324
00:18:07,975 --> 00:18:10,719
The people I've killed are screaming at me from Hell.

325
00:18:11,942 --> 00:18:13,375
They sound so angry

326
00:18:13,474 --> 00:18:16,554
and they're constantly telling me
to hurry and join them down there!

327
00:18:17,121 --> 00:18:20,520
I've been hearing them every
day since I became an executioner

328
00:18:20,852 --> 00:18:22,777
and it keeps getting worse!

329
00:18:22,897 --> 00:18:27,062
I just keep talking to drown out the
noise. So tell me what you do about the...

330
00:18:27,087 --> 00:18:27,993
I don't hear them.

331
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,550
Your voices.

332
00:18:30,003 --> 00:18:31,661
I don't hear anything like that.

333
00:18:31,901 --> 00:18:33,180
Interesting.

334
00:18:33,747 --> 00:18:37,399
You're such an experienced assassin,
I thought for sure you'd understand.

335
00:18:39,155 --> 00:18:41,855
You have disappointed me!

336
00:18:50,691 --> 00:18:51,462
Kurome.

337
00:18:53,052 --> 00:18:54,305
What's wrong, Akame?

338
00:18:54,612 --> 00:18:55,994
Hey, snap out of it!

339
00:18:56,074 --> 00:19:02,175
She can't. "Illusionary Sight" creates a mirage
of the person you care most about in this world.

340
00:19:03,036 --> 00:19:08,417
Right now she's looking at a vision of someone so
important to her she can't bring herself to do harm to me.

341
00:19:08,442 --> 00:19:10,999
Huh? So that's why I thought I saw Sayo!

342
00:19:11,211 --> 00:19:12,585
Akame please!

343
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:13,973
Don't let him get to you!

344
00:19:14,213 --> 00:19:15,250
It's not real!

345
00:19:15,639 --> 00:19:16,799
Don't bother!

346
00:19:16,824 --> 00:19:20,276
It may only work on one target
but it's extremely hypnotic.

347
00:19:20,402 --> 00:19:23,197
Besides, no matter how much skill you have...

348
00:19:23,236 --> 00:19:26,706
Nobody can make themselves kill
the one they love the most, can they?!

349
00:19:27,134 --> 00:19:31,576
This is the last thing you'll see
before you die, Akame... Enjoy it!

350
00:19:36,515 --> 00:19:37,575
What the...?!

351
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,491
She didn't even hesitate!

352
00:19:44,972 --> 00:19:46,094
What the hell?!

353
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:48,909
You were supposed to see the one person you love the most!

354
00:19:49,308 --> 00:19:51,060
My desire to kill her.

355
00:19:51,495 --> 00:19:53,764
Is because I love her so dearly.

356
00:19:55,592 --> 00:19:56,938
What is she saying?

357
00:19:57,152 --> 00:19:59,182
Now it's time for this battle to end.

358
00:20:00,513 --> 00:20:02,050
No, it's about to break!

359
00:20:02,508 --> 00:20:04,745
I'll destroy that weapon first!

360
00:20:05,798 --> 00:20:07,475
I refuse to die!

361
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:11,374
Reading her mind gives me the upper hand!

362
00:20:11,646 --> 00:20:13,764
No, I can't kill her quick enough!

363
00:20:13,999 --> 00:20:15,577
My sword won't last that long!

364
00:20:15,863 --> 00:20:17,297
Ah!

365
00:20:17,921 --> 00:20:18,554
Gah!

366
00:20:21,008 --> 00:20:22,869
Ugh!

367
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:26,770
You are done.

368
00:20:34,778 --> 00:20:35,705
You did it!

369
00:20:37,393 --> 00:20:39,381
Akame. She saved me...

370
00:20:40,382 --> 00:20:42,332
I need to get stronger.

371
00:20:43,975 --> 00:20:44,860
Zanku...

372
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:48,008
those voices will never haunt you again.

373
00:20:52,746 --> 00:20:53,746
The voices...

374
00:20:55,341 --> 00:20:56,280
they're gone.

375
00:20:58,728 --> 00:21:01,706
It's delightful...

376
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,260
I thank you...

377
00:21:05,629 --> 00:21:06,669
Akame.

378
00:21:15,284 --> 00:21:16,118
Sayo.

379
00:21:17,432 --> 00:21:18,478
What are you doing?

380
00:21:18,999 --> 00:21:20,366
It's time for dinner.

381
00:21:20,418 --> 00:21:23,022
You may be injured but you can still pull your weight.

382
00:21:23,275 --> 00:21:24,690
Hey, Akame?

383
00:21:25,343 --> 00:21:27,940
Who was it you saw when you were hypnotized by Zanku?

384
00:21:27,965 --> 00:21:28,498
Hm?

385
00:21:31,145 --> 00:21:33,123
I'll tell you when the time comes.

386
00:21:34,265 --> 00:21:35,822
I will tell you this much:

387
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:38,131
Everyone in Night Raid.

388
00:21:38,571 --> 00:21:40,119
They're all important to me.

389
00:21:41,862 --> 00:21:43,107
That includes you too.

390
00:21:43,132 --> 00:21:43,749
Gah!

391
00:21:44,633 --> 00:21:45,347
Let's go.

392
00:21:45,913 --> 00:21:47,474
Uh, hey, wait up!

393
00:21:47,721 --> 00:21:49,495
It's all meat dishes tonight.

394
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,425
No way; That can't be healthy!

395
00:21:51,465 --> 00:21:53,240
Can't you throw in a few vegetables here and there?

396
00:21:53,265 --> 00:21:53,559
Nope.

397
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:54,227
Come on!
