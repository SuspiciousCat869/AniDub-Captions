1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,450
I don't get it. I feel like we've looked everywhere.

2
00:00:03,774 --> 00:00:05,240
Where could their hideout be?!

3
00:00:05,497 --> 00:00:07,884
Well, Kyoroku is an extremely large city.

4
00:00:07,909 --> 00:00:13,370
And since this religious organization is a fairly peaceful
one, we can't do anything drastic to lure them out.

5
00:00:13,448 --> 00:00:16,211
It's going to take more than simply attacking someone.

6
00:00:17,941 --> 00:00:18,541
Here!

7
00:00:20,014 --> 00:00:21,407
Kids are so cute!

8
00:00:21,714 --> 00:00:25,201
They're still so young and pure,
they haven't been tainted with evil!

9
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:29,389
Wow, I never realized she could actually smile like that.

10
00:00:29,575 --> 00:00:31,691
Yeah, she'd been stressed for quite a while.

11
00:00:32,379 --> 00:00:35,044
So Esdeath told her she should
try a little change of pace.

12
00:00:35,764 --> 00:00:38,479
By the way, you've been hanging around a lot lately.

13
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,625
Have you decided to join us or what?

14
00:00:41,151 --> 00:00:43,939
Hmm... I guess we're "partners."

15
00:00:44,243 --> 00:00:47,765
Whatever it takes to get General
Esdeath to put me in my place.

16
00:00:50,058 --> 00:00:51,202
I'm not sure why,

17
00:00:51,488 --> 00:00:54,541
but something about this girl reminds me of Dr. Stylish.

18
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:59,700
See ya! Remember to have fun playing
and never cheat. Okay, boys and girls?

19
00:00:59,983 --> 00:01:01,470
Okay!

20
00:01:01,757 --> 00:01:06,358
It's so nice to guide them down the path of
righteousness while they're young and impressionable!

21
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:10,522
Yes, this is what is right. This is my country!

22
00:01:11,225 --> 00:01:13,137
I'll protect it at all costs.

23
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:47,201
That's all the info the spies gathered.

24
00:02:47,465 --> 00:02:50,812
We will launch the plan the day
of the Path of Peace celebration.

25
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,171
Wow, going out with a bang, huh!

26
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,511
During the festival,

27
00:02:54,881 --> 00:02:57,484
we'll slip through the crowds and sneak into the palace.

28
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:58,998
Then we'll go in for the kill!

29
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,771
Serves him right.

30
00:03:02,338 --> 00:03:05,308
This job will send the Revolutionary Army into action!

31
00:03:05,745 --> 00:03:07,714
Failure is not an option!

32
00:03:08,956 --> 00:03:10,429
Dinnertime, everyone.

33
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:12,757
I pulled out all the stops today.

34
00:03:13,753 --> 00:03:15,836
Is everyone ready to have their minds blown?!

35
00:03:15,861 --> 00:03:17,249
Yeah!

36
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:23,492
Najenda gets ramen. The noodles are extra firm
and the balance of chicken and salt is just right!

37
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,049
Mine gets strawberry parfait.

38
00:03:26,184 --> 00:03:28,175
I even added a little something extra.

39
00:03:29,161 --> 00:03:31,889
And for Lubbuck, I've prepared a fresh Bohai shrimp.

40
00:03:32,628 --> 00:03:35,905
Leone gets oden and assorted local brands of sake!

41
00:03:37,072 --> 00:03:41,802
For Akame, I have a collection of meats
from every beast I could find in the forest.

42
00:03:42,515 --> 00:03:46,733
And Tatsumi said he's not picky so he gets, well... this.

43
00:03:46,757 --> 00:03:47,418
Huh?

44
00:03:47,491 --> 00:03:49,564
But this looks like it's for little kids!

45
00:03:50,428 --> 00:03:54,036
As a special treat, I had Susanoo
cook up everyone's favorite food.

46
00:03:54,282 --> 00:03:56,830
So go ahead and chow down; You're going to need energy.

47
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:59,457
Oh, no need to tell you twice.

48
00:03:59,646 --> 00:04:01,183
I'm glad everyone's hungry.

49
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,362
Mmm! So sweet! I love it!

50
00:04:04,387 --> 00:04:06,130
Tatsumi, you gotta try a bite of this.

51
00:04:06,155 --> 00:04:10,493
Tatsumi, you do know what you're s'posed to
do when my cup starts getting empty, don't 'cha?

52
00:04:10,524 --> 00:04:12,494
Yeah, yeah, okay, I'll pour you some more.

53
00:04:13,556 --> 00:04:15,503
That's right; You're such a good boy!

54
00:04:17,855 --> 00:04:19,680
Good God! You ate all that?!

55
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,768
Another amazing meal. Thank you, Su!

56
00:04:22,968 --> 00:04:25,866
Yeah! Seriously, I don't know what we'd do without you.

57
00:04:25,952 --> 00:04:26,715
You're awesome!

58
00:04:27,014 --> 00:04:29,192
I'm deeply honored to know I've pleased you.

59
00:04:30,076 --> 00:04:31,031
But, Tatsumi...

60
00:04:32,078 --> 00:04:34,239
You didn't eat the last grain of rice.

61
00:04:34,373 --> 00:04:35,997
I don't know if I can stand it.

62
00:04:36,316 --> 00:04:40,223
Sure is a shame. This guy would be perfect
if he wasn't such a ninny all the time.

63
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:55,606
If Night Raid plans to strike, it'll be today.

64
00:04:56,397 --> 00:04:59,200
But that goes without saying, doesn't it, Seryu?

65
00:04:59,385 --> 00:05:02,968
Suzuka, do not let those demons into the cathedral, okay?

66
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:04,717
Yeah, I know.

67
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,605
That girl's got combat experience.

68
00:05:09,678 --> 00:05:12,562
I can tell by those eyes and the way she walks.

69
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,213
Damn! Didn't take 'em very long to spot us.

70
00:05:20,914 --> 00:05:22,776
They won't chase us all the way out here.

71
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:25,726
Yeah, well, we had to get out of the city.

72
00:05:26,394 --> 00:05:28,450
I hope we created a good enough distraction.

73
00:05:28,475 --> 00:05:32,722
All we can do now is cross our fingers and
pray the boss and everyone else pulls through.

74
00:05:35,876 --> 00:05:39,525
It feels like I still have makeup all over me. Ugh...

75
00:05:40,646 --> 00:05:42,186
Did I get all of it off?

76
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,550
Y-yeah... yeah, I think so!

77
00:05:45,865 --> 00:05:47,556
Why are you getting all red?

78
00:05:49,304 --> 00:05:52,288
You're not taking all that
"string-of-fate" crap seriously, are you?!

79
00:05:52,313 --> 00:05:55,964
Oh, you wish! But it sounds like YOU‘’ve been
thinking about it since you're bringing it up!

80
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:57,137
Ugh, shut up!

81
00:05:57,162 --> 00:05:59,693
Don't be ridiculous! If you're my "soulmate",

82
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:04,092
then explain why you didn't try to save me
when I almost got eaten by that giant frog thing!

83
00:06:04,117 --> 00:06:05,284
Where were ya on that one?!

84
00:06:05,336 --> 00:06:08,144
Hey now, I kinda had my hands full, remember?!

85
00:06:08,548 --> 00:06:10,852
There's that Night Raid girl I fought before.

86
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:15,097
So why in God's name is Tatsumi
with her? What in the hell?

87
00:06:16,628 --> 00:06:19,065
He's been corrupted by evil.

88
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,086
Koro, Phase 9!

89
00:06:23,396 --> 00:06:24,901
Justice City Detector!

90
00:06:26,752 --> 00:06:28,753
There aren't any civilians in the area.

91
00:06:30,742 --> 00:06:34,694
At last, destiny has reunited us once again, Night Raid!

92
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,731
Koro and I will erase your kind,

93
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:40,066
with the swinging Hammer of Justice!

94
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,151
Koro!

95
00:06:45,152 --> 00:06:51,044
I'll give them a taste of my explosive weapon
that combines Judgement of the Ten Kings 2, 7, and 8!

96
00:06:51,198 --> 00:06:55,191
The great commander showered you with
affection and you repay her with betrayal.

97
00:06:55,252 --> 00:07:00,053
And now, you return with the girl whose
partner hacked off my arms and tried to kill me!

98
00:07:00,427 --> 00:07:03,445
You shall be punished by fire for your sins!

99
00:07:06,738 --> 00:07:08,329
I smell gunpowder!

100
00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:09,944
Justice...

101
00:07:10,843 --> 00:07:12,281
VOLLEY!!

102
00:07:20,143 --> 00:07:21,330
They survived that?

103
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:23,571
Stubborn little devils!

104
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,384
They certainly seem to be after us.

105
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,713
Right? If you ask me, they're trying to
keep us as far away from the town as possible.

106
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:32,980
Must've struck a nerve.

107
00:07:33,373 --> 00:07:35,077
Here comes another round! Get ready!

108
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:46,004
The attacks have slowed down,

109
00:07:46,234 --> 00:07:47,482
so I guess we're out of range.

110
00:07:47,861 --> 00:07:49,199
I got a look at the shooter.

111
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,161
It's definitely Seryu Ubiquitous.

112
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,862
Seryu Ubiquitous, huh?

113
00:07:57,478 --> 00:07:59,403
Which way is that bitch shooting from?

114
00:08:02,122 --> 00:08:03,955
It's the fourth Rakshasa Demon!

115
00:08:04,376 --> 00:08:10,091
Suzuka. But I don't suppose it makes much difference
what you call me since you're about to be dead.

116
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:11,279
Oh, really now!

117
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:13,552
Get outta here, Mine!

118
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:18,560
I don't think so! After what she said,
there's no way I could just- Ah! Tatsumi!

119
00:08:18,627 --> 00:08:20,145
There's been a change of plans.

120
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:22,046
You get to fight me instead!

121
00:08:22,528 --> 00:08:24,146
Oh, aren't you brave?

122
00:08:24,205 --> 00:08:27,740
All right, I'll let you be the
first to die. How does that sound?

123
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,303
Tatsumi!

124
00:08:33,507 --> 00:08:34,525
Stupid.

125
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:37,370
Okay, you take care of her...

126
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:41,847
And I'll deal with Seryu.

127
00:08:43,042 --> 00:08:46,934
After I finish my business with
her, I'll come back to help you.

128
00:08:51,944 --> 00:08:53,425
Koro, Phase 6!

129
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:55,280
Woof!

130
00:08:59,724 --> 00:09:02,496
What's that?! Does she ever run out of stuff?!

131
00:09:02,782 --> 00:09:05,025
The rebellion will never find peace!

132
00:09:05,554 --> 00:09:08,816
Those with no value for justice will meet their end!

133
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:11,893
Thanks for the big target.

134
00:09:14,488 --> 00:09:19,036
What?! She took down my most powerful
attack with a single shot! Fine!

135
00:09:22,322 --> 00:09:23,717
Koro, Phase 1!

136
00:09:36,272 --> 00:09:39,936
I came here to personally ensure
the condemnation of Night Raid.

137
00:09:40,314 --> 00:09:42,416
So, we finally meet again.

138
00:09:42,729 --> 00:09:46,361
Koro's gonna eat your corpse,
just like he did your two friends.

139
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:47,918
TWO friends?

140
00:09:48,828 --> 00:09:53,112
We put a woman's head on display in the
middle of Romaly, a redhead I do believe.

141
00:09:53,273 --> 00:09:55,227
And Koro ate the rest of her!

142
00:09:55,704 --> 00:09:58,092
The same with that purple freak in the glasses.

143
00:09:58,117 --> 00:10:01,108
They both ended up in a little pile on the back lawn.

144
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,665
And now it's your turn!

145
00:10:05,718 --> 00:10:09,322
You know, you like to consider
yourself a fighter for justice,

146
00:10:09,422 --> 00:10:11,965
but you blindly followed Ogre and Stylish.

147
00:10:12,092 --> 00:10:15,307
You never even stopped to think
about how messed up they were, did you?

148
00:10:16,503 --> 00:10:18,398
But then again, so are you.

149
00:10:18,972 --> 00:10:21,877
You laugh exactly how those two sick freaks used to laugh.

150
00:10:22,661 --> 00:10:23,974
You're just like them.

151
00:10:25,678 --> 00:10:28,679
That's why I have absolutely no problem taking your life.

152
00:10:28,988 --> 00:10:30,594
I'm gonna put a hole through you!

153
00:10:30,945 --> 00:10:33,414
Do you feel better getting all that off your chest?

154
00:10:33,456 --> 00:10:34,593
Koro, Phase 5.

155
00:10:35,723 --> 00:10:36,786
Don't forget the arms.

156
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:40,643
All you managed to do was give
Koro enough time to regenerate.

157
00:10:40,737 --> 00:10:42,918
The evil of this world are so stupid.

158
00:10:43,094 --> 00:10:44,570
Let's go, Koro!

159
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:48,680
How is it so powerful?!

160
00:10:48,705 --> 00:10:50,629
Maybe because I've been holding back.

161
00:10:50,795 --> 00:10:53,830
This fight'll be more entertaining
if it's a true two-on-one!

162
00:10:54,374 --> 00:10:59,217
The best thing about Pumpkin is it fires
with more power if I find myself in a tight spot!

163
00:10:59,431 --> 00:11:00,683
Don't give up, Koro!

164
00:11:00,957 --> 00:11:03,677
She can't possibly keep up a surge like that forever!

165
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:08,615
Maybe not! But thanks to our last battle,
I've almost figured out where the core is!

166
00:11:08,722 --> 00:11:11,447
I don't need much more time! And then it's over.

167
00:11:11,472 --> 00:11:14,824
Damn you! Koro, use your trump card!

168
00:11:22,836 --> 00:11:24,259
I'm prepared for this.

169
00:11:24,477 --> 00:11:27,138
I've seen everything this Imperial Arms can do!

170
00:11:29,984 --> 00:11:32,308
Devil King's Justice Lance!

171
00:11:42,794 --> 00:11:44,398
She's more dangerous now.

172
00:11:44,783 --> 00:11:48,008
Her personal weapon's not an
Imperial Arms, but it's really strong!

173
00:11:57,703 --> 00:11:59,884
I'll BEAT YOU TO DEATH!

174
00:12:09,351 --> 00:12:11,143
I took on too much damage.

175
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,922
Shit, I should've just finished her off.

176
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,946
This girl is really freakin' fast.

177
00:12:25,017 --> 00:12:26,096
She's all over the place.

178
00:12:31,637 --> 00:12:33,507
Aw, you made me break a nail.

179
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:34,601
Son of a...

180
00:12:35,267 --> 00:12:37,409
Killing Mez, that was one thing,

181
00:12:37,434 --> 00:12:40,044
but I was surprised one of you took out Ibara.

182
00:12:40,303 --> 00:12:42,469
Though it clearly couldn't have been you.

183
00:12:42,494 --> 00:12:45,778
It's painfully obvious how
little combat experience you have.

184
00:12:45,878 --> 00:12:48,401
Once again, I'm not strong enough.

185
00:12:49,521 --> 00:12:52,056
I've dealt with this regret too many times.

186
00:12:52,284 --> 00:12:54,910
Over and over and over!

187
00:12:55,253 --> 00:12:58,294
No matter how tough she is, I cannot let it happen again.

188
00:13:10,014 --> 00:13:12,350
Are you back at a hundred percent now, Koro?

189
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:18,326
Good. It's time to destroy this demon once and for all.

190
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:29,861
Natara! Doya!

191
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:32,819
Oh, hey Su! How are things going?

192
00:13:33,072 --> 00:13:34,424
So far, so good.

193
00:13:34,793 --> 00:13:37,716
We just need to stick to the plan and lure the enemy here.

194
00:13:39,192 --> 00:13:42,632
You must understand, I don't
have time to play around with you!

195
00:13:43,262 --> 00:13:44,851
Now where's my big sister?

196
00:13:44,876 --> 00:13:50,150
Oh, you wanna know? Okay, but before I tell
you, you're gonna pay for cutting off my arm!

197
00:13:52,204 --> 00:13:54,264
I'm still not healed from the last fight.

198
00:13:54,405 --> 00:13:56,252
Say your prayers, kid!

199
00:14:01,206 --> 00:14:02,535
Stop picking on her...

200
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:05,118
and fight me.

201
00:14:07,445 --> 00:14:08,755
Sorry I'm late, Kurome.

202
00:14:10,356 --> 00:14:13,367
What? Do you want Su to send your ass flying again?

203
00:14:13,832 --> 00:14:15,489
Come and get me, Night Raid.

204
00:14:16,428 --> 00:14:19,134
I'm not gonna let you hurt my teammates anymore!

205
00:14:20,071 --> 00:14:22,049
Grand Chariot!

206
00:14:29,521 --> 00:14:32,524
General Esdeath, I need the Jaegers; Where are they?!

207
00:14:32,618 --> 00:14:35,388
Shut up. You're getting just what you deserve, Bolic.

208
00:14:35,413 --> 00:14:37,773
If you'd listened, you wouldn't be in this mess.

209
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,357
You must protect me!

210
00:14:39,388 --> 00:14:41,211
The minister himself commanded you to...

211
00:14:42,461 --> 00:14:44,529
You're right, orders are orders.

212
00:14:44,663 --> 00:14:46,897
I will continue to keep you safe.

213
00:14:47,176 --> 00:14:49,812
However, I must forbid you to leave this room.

214
00:14:49,843 --> 00:14:51,584
Yes! Of course!

215
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:54,993
If your plan was to lose me in the ruins, it won't work.

216
00:14:55,114 --> 00:14:58,271
You'll just tire yourself out
and make your death too easy.

217
00:14:58,644 --> 00:15:00,188
Yeah? Well sorry,

218
00:15:00,264 --> 00:15:02,173
but you're going down one way or another!

219
00:15:02,614 --> 00:15:04,423
Get ready to join your little friends!

220
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:08,939
What the hell? This guy's gonna kill us both.

221
00:15:08,964 --> 00:15:10,223
You're not getting away!

222
00:15:10,501 --> 00:15:12,228
This is your end!

223
00:15:30,488 --> 00:15:34,243
This... This brings back some memories.

224
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,906
How they called me a half-breed
while they trampled me in the street...

225
00:15:39,714 --> 00:15:41,794
I just kept gazing into the sky.

226
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:45,931
No one ever stopped. No one ever helped.

227
00:15:47,512 --> 00:15:48,797
Then, I realized...

228
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:51,338
the only one who could save me...

229
00:15:53,324 --> 00:15:54,286
was me.

230
00:15:56,681 --> 00:16:01,138
I made a promise to myself that I would
never live such dark days ever again.

231
00:16:01,723 --> 00:16:04,961
And I would never let anyone
else suffer such discrimination.

232
00:16:07,059 --> 00:16:08,028
Which is why...

233
00:16:13,564 --> 00:16:16,395
I will not die here in the middle of nowhere!

234
00:16:23,474 --> 00:16:24,096
Now!

235
00:16:24,628 --> 00:16:26,525
I'll have my revenge!

236
00:16:29,286 --> 00:16:29,982
Koro!

237
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:34,347
The Ten Kings are out of
ammunition, but I still have these!

238
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:39,639
Justice must prevail!

239
00:16:40,806 --> 00:16:41,685
This is it!

240
00:16:51,812 --> 00:16:54,679
No! How could I let this happen?

241
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:06,500
My weapon creates power out of emotional energy.

242
00:17:07,282 --> 00:17:10,566
The more intense my feelings, the more fuel for Pumpkin.

243
00:17:14,577 --> 00:17:16,477
So the moment you pissed me off...

244
00:17:17,175 --> 00:17:18,705
that was when you lost.

245
00:17:25,652 --> 00:17:27,814
Justice will always prevail.

246
00:17:27,994 --> 00:17:30,982
No matter what the cost, all evil must be cast out.

247
00:17:32,855 --> 00:17:34,692
Judgement of Ten Kings.

248
00:17:35,143 --> 00:17:38,673
Final Phase: Godotenrin's Furnace.

249
00:17:40,178 --> 00:17:41,608
You've got one minute.

250
00:17:42,637 --> 00:17:44,984
What the hell?! You bitch!

251
00:17:45,437 --> 00:17:47,925
The doctor was kind enough to give it to me,

252
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,028
the ultimate weapon against sin!

253
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:55,099
As long as it lives inside my
head, I can never truly lose!

254
00:17:55,353 --> 00:17:56,250
Damn you!

255
00:17:57,068 --> 00:17:59,035
Oh no, it's overheated!

256
00:18:02,033 --> 00:18:03,794
You're too weak to get away!

257
00:18:04,109 --> 00:18:05,604
You're not gonna make it!

258
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:08,572
You'll burn like the demon you are!

259
00:18:15,787 --> 00:18:16,541
Koro...

260
00:18:17,545 --> 00:18:19,367
You can't heal yourself anymore.

261
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:23,156
It's not fair; There's still
so much evil left in the world.

262
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,162
I can't die until it's gone.

263
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:30,103
Not yet...

264
00:18:37,601 --> 00:18:39,981
Shit, my... my legs!

265
00:18:40,178 --> 00:18:41,800
I cannot accept this.

266
00:18:42,013 --> 00:18:45,901
If I die, how will I ever
fulfill my promise I made to myself!

267
00:18:46,074 --> 00:18:49,278
And I have to keep living for
the sake of Sheele and Chelsea!

268
00:18:51,489 --> 00:18:53,648
Why would I suddenly think of everyone?

269
00:18:53,837 --> 00:18:57,911
I can't leave them alone; They wouldn't
have a clue how to do anything without me.

270
00:19:04,955 --> 00:19:06,151
Here it comes!

271
00:19:27,391 --> 00:19:29,217
I was too weak when we lost Bro.

272
00:19:30,632 --> 00:19:32,803
And I was too slow when we lost Chelsea.

273
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:36,508
But that's it.

274
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,703
I will not lose anyone else.

275
00:19:40,678 --> 00:19:41,605
Tatsumi...

276
00:19:42,952 --> 00:19:44,203
Looks like you'll be okay.

277
00:19:50,253 --> 00:19:53,306
Oh yeah, I did exactly what you told me to do.

278
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:56,649
You said I should be there to help
out whenever you're in trouble, right?

279
00:19:57,858 --> 00:19:59,993
So that's what I did. How about that?

280
00:20:00,486 --> 00:20:02,390
Your bullcrap actually made an impression on me.

281
00:20:03,465 --> 00:20:07,060
Y'know, Tatsumi? You can be a real patronizing asshole.

282
00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:08,848
But...

283
00:20:10,573 --> 00:20:12,268
I really do appreciate it.

284
00:20:13,402 --> 00:20:14,271
Thanks a lot.

285
00:20:15,792 --> 00:20:17,936
Uh... yeah, sure.

286
00:20:21,271 --> 00:20:21,910
Bolic!

287
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:24,684
Where is that pig?

288
00:20:25,455 --> 00:20:27,025
He already ran away.

289
00:20:28,157 --> 00:20:29,017
Najenda...

290
00:20:29,117 --> 00:20:31,197
It seems he didn't take your advice.

291
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,578
I'm sure my subordinates are silencing him as we speak.

292
00:20:36,188 --> 00:20:37,190
Nice try.

293
00:20:37,215 --> 00:20:38,075
Horimaca!

294
00:20:38,801 --> 00:20:40,976
But it barely even scratched me!

295
00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:49,171
You always did come up with clever little schemes.

296
00:20:49,809 --> 00:20:53,910
Oh, yes. I like to think I have a better
understanding of your talent than anyone.

297
00:20:54,825 --> 00:20:57,951
So I wouldn't be so foolish as to try to take you head-on.

298
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:03,320
I guess the fight's over for now, huh?

299
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,054
Yeah.

300
00:21:05,918 --> 00:21:06,988
Hey, Tatsumi.

301
00:21:07,637 --> 00:21:09,248
Hmm? What's up?

302
00:21:11,174 --> 00:21:13,050
As soon as this is all behind us,

303
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,157
I need to tell you something.

304
00:21:16,934 --> 00:21:18,269
Can't you just tell me now?

305
00:21:18,369 --> 00:21:19,950
No, I can't.

306
00:21:19,975 --> 00:21:21,303
Wha... Why not?

307
00:21:21,462 --> 00:21:24,412
I'm feeling so confused, so conflicted.

308
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:28,173
I never imagined I'd want to
live for someone besides myself.

309
00:21:30,614 --> 00:21:31,870
Promise me something.

310
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,426
Promise me you'll survive.

311
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:37,301
Yeah, of course I will.

312
00:21:43,513 --> 00:21:45,263
If these feelings are driving me,

313
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:50,331
then I should be able to tap into some
powers far beyond any I ever have before.

314
00:21:50,853 --> 00:21:54,583
From now on, my battles will be even more intense.
