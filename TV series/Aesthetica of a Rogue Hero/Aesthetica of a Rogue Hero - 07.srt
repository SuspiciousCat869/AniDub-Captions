1
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:12,708
- IT LOOKED LIKE MORE FABRIC
ON THE HANGER!

2
00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:15,208
- Chikage: HEY, SLOWPOKE!

3
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:17,333
WE PICKED OUT OUR SWIMSUITS,
SO WE'RE GOOD TO GO.

4
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:18,458
HURRY UP, OKAY?

5
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:20,583
- Kuzuha: WE'LL WAIT
FOR YOU OUTSIDE!

6
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:22,416
- WAIT, YOU'RE LEAVING?

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,708
COME ON, SELF, YOU CAN DO THIS!

8
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:30,833
- ( rattling )

9
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:36,416
- OH, MY GOODNESS.

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,000
- Volk: SO, IT APPEARS THERE'S
NO LONGER ANY ROOM FOR DOUBT.

11
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:43,583
THE DARK LORD GARIUS
HAS MET HIS DOOM.

12
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:45,625
BUT THERE ARE THOSE
WITHIN HIS CURSED CLAN

13
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:47,291
WHO WOULD STILL DO US INJURY.

14
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:49,958
AND WE CANNOT ALLOW
THIS CANKER TO GROW.

15
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:52,250
WE MUST QUELL THIS REBELLION
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

16
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:54,458
- WELL SAID.

17
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:56,458
KNOW THAT THE SHELLFEED
KINGDOM HAS NO OBJECTIONS

18
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:58,791
TO THAT WHICH YOU
PROPOSE, EMPEROR...

19
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:00,416
FOR THE SAKE OF
PEACE IN OUR WORLD,

20
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,416
WE WILL PLEDGE OUR
SWORD TO THIS FIGHT.

21
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,583
- MMM.

22
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:07,000
AND YOU, LORD BARAM.
WHAT SAY YOU?

23
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:10,208
- I WILL STAND FAST WITH YOU
ON THIS DECISION, YOUR HOLINESS.

24
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:12,125
- BUT I THINK WE HAVE
A BIGGER PROBLEM.

25
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:14,291
THE FATE OF THE
DARK LORD'S CHILD.

26
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:15,958
SHE HAD GONE TO GROUND,

27
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:17,583
BUT I HAVE DISCOVERED
WHERE SHE'D BEEN HIDING

28
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:20,333
IN THE DAYS SINCE HIS DEATH.

29
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:22,166
WE CANNOT AFFORD TO SIT IDLE.

30
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,666
WE MUST SEND A SEARCH PARTY
TO APPREHEND HER IMMEDIATELY.

31
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,083
- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
SINCE HIS DEATH,

32
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:30,750
MOST OF GARIUS'S CLANSMEN
HAVE KEPT TO THEMSELVES

33
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:33,166
DEEP WITHIN THE DARKNESS
OF GALEPANE FOREST.

34
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,125
TARGETING HIS DAUGHTER WILL ONLY
SERVE TO PROVOKE THEIR ANGER.

35
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:37,666
- YOU WOULD HAVE
US DO NOTHING?

36
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,916
SO LONG AS THE DARK
LORD'S HEIR IS ALIVE,

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,875
WE MUST WAIT FOR THE VENGEANCE
THEY WILL UNDOUBTEDLY SEEK OUT.

38
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:45,791
- YOU MAY BE RIGHT, BUT EVEN SO.

39
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:47,583
- YOUR MAJESTY,
IT IS TRUE

40
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:50,375
THAT GARIUS'S DAUGHTER
HAS DONE US NO WRONG.

41
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:53,000
BUT THERE IS WISDOM
IN WHAT LORD BARAM SAYS.

42
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:56,166
THE GIRL'S VERY EXISTENCE IS A
THREAT TO THE NEWFOUND PEACE

43
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,458
SO MANY HAVE FOUGHT
AND DIED FOR.

44
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:01,000
- I KNOW.

45
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:04,000
- WELL, ALL RIGHT, THEN. IT
SEEMS WE'VE REACHED AN ACCORD.

46
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:06,375
LORD BARAM, YOU BELIEVE
THE DARK LORD'S DAUGHTER

47
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:08,541
HAS LEFT GALEPANE
FOREST, CORRECT?

48
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:11,833
- THAT'S RIGHT. NOT ONLY
HAS SHE LEFT GALEPANE,

49
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:15,875
BUT I BELIEVE SHE'S
DEPARTED ALAYZARD ITSELF.

50
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:17,083
- ( theme song playing )

51
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:18,750
- ( singing in Japanese )

52
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,041
- Haruka: HONESTLY, NOW!

53
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,833
- GOTTA STOP COMPLAINING
ABOUT IT EVENTUALLY.

54
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,333
- VERY FUNNY! YES,

55
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,625
THEY GAVE US SOME DOWN-TIME
BEFORE THE RANKING MATCHES,

56
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,875
BUT WE STILL HAVE OTHER
EXAMS TO PREP FOR!

57
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,916
- CALM DOWN. IT'S
OUTTA OUR HANDS.

58
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,208
THE FAMILY OF THE
GIRL WE RESCUED

59
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:08,791
WANTED TO THANK US
FOR OUR BRAVERY

60
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,416
WITH A FUN-IN-THE-SUN
GETAWAY, SO HERE WE ARE.

61
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,291
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN RUDE TO
TURN 'EM DOWN. YOU EVEN SAID SO.

62
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:17,166
I KNOW I DID, BUT STILL.

63
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,750
- HARUKA, DO YOU NOT ENJOY
THE BEACH OR SOMETHING?

64
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:23,708
- NO, THE BEACH ITSELF
IS FINE. I JUST DON'T...

65
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,291
- HEY, DON'T FORGET,

66
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,750
YOU TOLD THE GIRL'S MOM OUSAWA'S
THE ONE WHO REALLY SAVED HER.

67
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,791
IT'S ONLY NATURAL HE'S GONNA
GET INVITED ON OUR BEACH TRIP.

68
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:33,458
FACE IT, HARUKA, YOU
DID THIS TO YOURSELF.

69
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:36,458
- HEY! SORRY FOR THE WAIT!

70
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,083
- AH! THERE YOU ARE!

71
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,083
- YOU'RE A GUY.

72
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,666
DO OUR SUITS MEET WITH
YOUR MANLY APPROVAL?

73
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,833
- YEAH! ON BEHALF OF ALL MEN,

74
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,791
I GIVE YOU LADIES
TWO THUMBS WAY UP.

75
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,666
BUT AREN'T WE MISSING SOMEONE?

76
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,208
- DON'T YOU WORRY,
SHE'S RIGHT HERE.

77
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:55,125
- YOUR SISTER FEELS A LITTLE
SELF CONSCIOUS, THAT'S ALL.

78
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,750
SHOW 'EM THE GOODS!

79
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,291
- HERE GOES.

80
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:02,750
UH, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

81
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,625
- WELL, I'M SURE
NOT COMPLAINING.

82
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,583
BUT IF YOU'RE SO
UNCOMFORTABLE WEARING IT,

83
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,333
WHY'D YOU CHOOSE IT
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

84
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:10,208
- SHE HAD A BIT OF TROUBLE
PICKING OUT A SUIT.

85
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:11,666
THEN SHE JUST
CLOSED HER EYES

86
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,625
AND SNAPPED THIS
ONE UP AT RANDOM!

87
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,500
- THERE'S NO NEED TO
BLUSH. CHECK IT OUT!

88
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,250
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE
THE ONLY GIRL ON THE BEACH

89
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,833
WHO'S SHOWING SOME SKIN.

90
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,166
IT'S NOTHIN' TO BE
EMBARRASSED ABOUT.

91
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,583
- SO, IT'S OKAY?

92
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,125
- UH-HUH!

93
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:29,250
JUST LEMME KNOW IF ANY OF THE
GUYS START CREEPIN' YOU OUT.

94
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:32,708
- CREEPIN' ME OUT? HEY!

95
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,416
- ( laughing )

96
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,958
SHALL WE, LADIES?

97
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,291
- YOU'RE COMING WITH
US, AREN'T YOU, MIU?

98
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,166
- YEAH! YOU GO
ON AHEAD, I'LL CATCH UP.

99
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,541
UH... HI.

100
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,250
- OH, IT'S YOU.

101
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,583
- SINCE WE'RE ALL HERE,

102
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,083
I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU'D
LIKE TO HANG OUT WITH US!

103
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,291
- NO. WE DON'T WANNA
IMPOSE ON YOU.

104
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:56,958
- Ryohei: DON'T BE SUCH
A STICK IN THE MUD.

105
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,708
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
THE GIRL'S INVITATION?

106
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,625
- UM, REALLY THAT'S OKAY.

107
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,291
RYOHEI, IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T
NOTICED I DON'T WANNA GO!

108
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,875
- GIMME ONE GOOD REASON WHY
YOU SHOULD BLOW HER OFF THEN.

109
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:09,583
- YOU WANT A REASON?
HOW ABOUT SHE'S OUSAWA'S SISTER?

110
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,708
- YOU'RE WAY TOO HUNG
UP ON THAT GUY, HARUKA.

111
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,750
IT MIGHT BE NICE TO IRON
OUT SOME OF THE DRAMA

112
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,250
BETWEEN YOU TWO.

113
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,000
- Haruka: HE'S BEEN NOTHING
BUT AN INSUFFERABLE SHOW-OFF

114
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,791
SINCE THE DAY HE...
- HE SAVED THAT LITTLE GIRL,

115
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,166
RIGHT?

116
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,583
GOING OUT OF YOUR WAY TO
AVOID HIM IS GONNA LOOK LIKE

117
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,500
YOU'RE JEALOUS THAT
HE STOLE YOUR SPOTLIGHT.

118
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:24,833
DON'T WANNA SEEM PETTY.

119
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:29,833
BUT YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU
WANNA. YOU'RE A BIG GIRL.

120
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:32,708
- FINE, THEN! I'M SO SORRY
TO HAVE MADE YOU WAIT.

121
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:35,375
IF THE OFFER STILL STANDS, WE
WOULD LOVE TO HANG OUT WITH YOU.

122
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,958
- OF COURSE!

123
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,500
- HEY, WHAT'S THE
HOLD-UP, YOU TWO?

124
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,250
IF WE'RE GOING TO DO
THIS, THEN LET'S GO.

125
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:44,291
ABOUT THAT. I THINK I'M GONNA
STAY HERE AND WATCH OUR STUFF.

126
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:45,875
- Haruka: HUH?
- WHAT ABOUT YOU, MINAMI,

127
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,000
YOU IN?

128
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,625
- Minami: NO CAN DO.
WORKING ON MY TAN.

129
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,041
- GUESS YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

130
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,791
- WHAT? SO I HAVE TO GO
BY MYSELF? YOU SET ME UP!

131
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,333
- IT'S ALL GOOD.

132
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,416
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S HARBORING
A MAJOR BEEF AGAINST OUSAWA,

133
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,500
SO YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
NEEDS TO HANG OUT WITH HIM.

134
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,708
- ( chuckling )

135
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,208
- ( giggling )

136
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:06,666
- TAKE THIS!

137
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,375
- YOU GOT IT, MIU!

138
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:12,250
- YOU SURE THIS IS THE WAY BACK
TO THE BEACH HOUSE, CHIKAGE?

139
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:15,541
- YEAH, I THINK SO.
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

140
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,666
- MAYBE THEY'RE ABOUT TO
HOLD A CONCERT OUT HERE.

141
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,958
- Motoharu: NOPE. SORRY!
IT'S NOT A CONCERT,

142
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,750
BUT IT'S DEFINITELY
WORTH STICKING AROUND.

143
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,208
- HUH?

144
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,750
- AKKI! HOW'S IT HANGING?

145
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:27,666
- JUST GETTING SOME SUN.
WHAT'RE YOU DOING OUT HERE?

146
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,458
- Motoharu: MAKING SOME COIN,
BELIEVE IT OR NOT.

147
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,875
CAME TO THE BEACH TODAY
ON MY PART-TIME JOB.

148
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:35,125
- ISN'T HE THE ONE WITH THE
HUGE MAN-CRUSH ON YOUR BROTHER?

149
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,708
- YEAH.

150
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,875
- LADIES, ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE
YOU TO MOTOHARU KAIDOU.

151
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,750
HE'S KIND OF
A LONE WOLF, I GUESS.

152
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:45,041
- BETTER THAN WHAT I USUALLY
GET CALLED. AND TOTALLY TRUE!

153
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:48,291
YEAH, LIKE HE SAID, THE NAME'S
MOTOHARU. ME AND HIM ARE BUDS!

154
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:49,500
PLEASED TO MEET YOU!

155
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,750
- SO, WHAT'S THIS
PART-TIME JOB, ANYWAY?

156
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,125
- YOURS TRULY
IS ON THE EVENT STAFF!

157
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:57,083
- JUST WHAT IN THE WORLD
AM I LOOKING AT HERE?

158
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,958
- REALLY, YOU'VE
NEVER HEARD OF IT?

159
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:02,000
THEY HOLD THIS BEACH SWIMSUIT
TAG EVENT EVERY YEAR.

160
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:05,000
THEY AIR IT ON PAY-PER-VIEW
TV, AND THERE'S A CASH PRIZE.

161
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,250
IT'S KIND OF A BIG DEAL!

162
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,833
- HELL, I'D WATCH IT!

163
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,083
- SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

164
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,916
AND IT SAYS HERE THAT
THERE'S NO ENTRY FEE.

165
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,333
- SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

166
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,708
WANNA GIVE IT THE OLD
COLLEGE TRY THERE, AKKI?

167
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:17,416
- Akatsuki: SURE. SOUNDS LIKE
A GOOD WAY TO KILL SOME TIME.

168
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,125
YOU FEELIN' LUCKY, GIRLS?

169
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,833
- HMM. IT IS TEMPTING.

170
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,500
- WELL, I'LL DO IT!

171
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,291
- ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

172
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,583
- I DON'T WANT THEM TO THINK
I'M SOME SHY LITTLE GIRL.

173
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:27,916
I CAN BE FUN TOO!

174
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,125
- WELL, IF MIU'S GONNA DO IT,
THEN COUNT ME IN!

175
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:33,166
- OKAY. ME TOO! BUT WHAT
ABOUT OUR VICE-PRESIDENT?

176
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,875
- HUH? FINE!

177
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,416
IF I'M GOING TO
FRATERNIZE WITH YOU

178
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,625
I SUPPOSE I'VE NO CHOICE

179
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,125
BUT TO SEE IT THROUGH
TO THE BITTER END!

180
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,416
WHO'S READY FOR SOME TAG?

181
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,666
MAKE SOME NOISE, 'CAUSE THE
BEACH SWIMSUIT TAG EVENT

182
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,875
IS ABOUT TO GO LIVE,
PARTY PEOPLE!

183
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,625
EARLIER, WE HAD YOU
FINE-LOOKIN' FOLKS

184
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,666
STICK NUMBER-TAGS
ONTO YOUR SWIMSUITS.

185
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,083
NOW WE'RE GONNA HOLD A
DRAWING TO PICK THE TARGET

186
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,291
AND WE'RE CHANGING THINGS
UP A BIT THIS YEAR!

187
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,041
WHOEVER COMES BACK
HOLDING THE TARGET'S SUIT

188
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:01,041
AT THE END OF THE
HOUR IS THE WINNER!

189
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,541
LADIES, IT'S ALL GOOD!

190
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,208
ONLY THE GUYS' NUMBERS WENT
INTO THE DRAWING, SO CHILL!

191
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:08,250
YOUR T AND A ARE SAFE
WITH US! AND HERE WE GO!

192
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,833
- GET READY!
- ROLLING THE GRAPHIC!

193
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,333
- CROSS YOUR FINGERS, FELLAS.

194
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:19,708
- WAIT. SO IT'S ME?

195
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,666
- CONGRATULATIONS, 88!

196
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,958
YOU'VE WON A FUN-FILLED HOUR
OF RUNNING AS FAST AS YOU CAN

197
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,541
FROM EVERYONE AROUND YOU!

198
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,833
- WELL, AT LEAST FOUR OF
'EM WILL BE ON MY SIDE.

199
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:29,291
RIGHT, GIRLS?

200
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:32,291
- WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU
A TEN SECOND HEAD START!

201
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:33,666
YOU'RE ALLOWED TO GO
WHEREVER YOU WANT,

202
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,291
SO LONG AS IT'S ON THE BEACH!

203
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:38,083
CHANGING ROOMS, BEACH HOUSES,
THEY'RE ALL IN BOUNDS.

204
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:40,250
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT
AS FAR AS RULES GO.

205
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:43,333
IT'S YOU VERSUS EVERYONE, 88,
SO DO WHATEVER YOU GOTTA!

206
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,375
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO
TELL ME TWICE.

207
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,750
AND NOW THAT YOU ALL
KNOW WHAT I LOOK LIKE,

208
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,958
TIME TO GTFO!

209
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:53,208
- WE'RE STARTING THAT TEN-SECOND
TIMER! GOOD LUCK TO YA!

210
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,125
- HEY, MINAMI, HOW COME
YOU'RE SO GUNG-HO

211
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,041
ABOUT GETTING ALL GOLDEN
TAN ALL OF A SUDDEN?

212
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:59,000
- PEOPLE KEEP TELLING ME
THAT I'M TOO PALE.

213
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,375
I'M JUST TIRED OF THEM ASKING ME

214
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,916
IF I'VE COME DOWN
WITH SOMETHING.

215
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,541
- IF YOU COME HOME
WITH TOO MUCH COLOR,

216
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:04,875
THEY'LL THINK YOU
WERE UP TO SOME

217
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:06,625
CRAZY BEACH SIDE SHENANIGANS
WHILE YOU WERE HERE.

218
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,541
- SO EITHER WAY,
YOU'RE KINDA SCREWED.

219
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,041
- IT'S A CONUNDRUM.

220
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,625
- WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO?

221
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,166
- RINSING OFF MY SUNTAN OIL.
WHITE IT IS.

222
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,458
- OKAY, THEN.
YOU HAVE FUN WITH THAT.

223
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:24,041
HM?

224
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,916
- Akatsuki: THIS REMINDS ME
OF THE FUN I USED TO HAVE

225
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,333
WITH VALKYRIE AND THE GIRLS.

226
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,416
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO
FOR AN HOUR?

227
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,166
JUST RUN AROUND AND KEEP THEM
FROM GETTING ME BARE-ASSED?

228
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,708
HEY, WAIT A SEC.

229
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,416
THE RULES ONLY SAID THAT
WHOEVER HAS MY TRUNKS

230
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,500
AT THE END OF THE
HOUR IS THE WINNER.

231
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:40,208
NOT THAT I HAVE TO RUN.

232
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,625
- TAKE THIS!

233
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,916
- GIVE ME THE SUIT!
- YOU HEARD HER!

234
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:47,625
- YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY.

235
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:50,000
WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE GOOSE
IS GOOD FOR THE GANDER.

236
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:53,583
IF YOU'RE GONNA TRY SOMETHING AS
BARBARIC AS SWIPING MY SWIMSUIT

237
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,458
I'M COOL WITH PULLING
TIT FOR TAT!

238
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:59,000
- THAT WENT WELL!
- WE GOTCHA!

239
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,958
- JUST KNOW THAT IF YOU'RE
GONNA GET ALL GRABBY WITH ME,

240
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,208
MY GRAB-FU IS STRONG!

241
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,541
- YOU DON'T THINK SOMEBODY'S
ALREADY GOTTEN THEM, DO YOU?

242
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,083
- I CAN'T IMAGINE YOUR BROTHER
RELINQUISHING HIS SWIM-TRUNKS

243
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,125
SO EARLY IN THE HOUR.

244
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,083
- ( people screaming )

245
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,291
- WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

246
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,708
- WEREN'T THOSE SOME OF
THE FOLKS CHASING AKATSUKI?

247
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,583
- WE'VE GOT TROUBLE.

248
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:26,916
- Baram: INDEED WE DO.

249
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,125
- INTO ANOTHER WORLD?

250
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:35,208
LORD BARAM, DO YOU SUGGEST
THAT THE DARK LORD'S DAUGHTER

251
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,208
HAS TRAVELED THROUGH
THE OTHERWORLD GATE?

252
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,583
AS YOU KNOW,

253
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,458
ONLY THOSE FROM OTHER LANDS
CAN EMPLOY THAT MEANS.

254
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:43,416
- I AGREE. YOUR THEORY
HAS MERIT, SIR,

255
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,333
BUT IT GOES AGAINST EVERYTHING
WE KNOW ABOUT THESE PORTALS.

256
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:49,416
- NOT AT ALL. AS QUEEN LISTY
WAS SO KIND TO REMIND US,

257
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,958
ONLY THOSE WHO TRAVEL HERE
FROM BEYOND ALAYZARD

258
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,375
CAN MAKE USE OF THE GATE.

259
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,458
AND MAKE USE OF IT HE DID.

260
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:58,375
- HE WHO? WAIT.
SURELY YOU DON'T MEAN...

261
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:03,625
- THAT'S RIGHT.
THIS CRISIS IS AKATSUKI'S DOING.

262
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,958
- ( sighs )

263
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,708
- THIS GAME IS CRAP. INSTEAD OF
US GETTING A PEEK AT HIS JUNK,

264
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,583
HE'S GETTIN' PEEKS
AT EVERYONE ELSE'S!

265
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:13,666
I DIG IT IN PRINCIPLE,
BUT COME ON!

266
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,291
- I DON'T MEAN TO
ALARM ANY OF YOU

267
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,583
BUT WE'RE THE ONLY GIRLS
WHO STILL HAVE TOPS.

268
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:20,500
- WE'VE ALL SEEN THE WAY HE
FIGHTS AGAINST MALE OPPONENTS.

269
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:23,250
HOW'S ANYONE THAT STRONG
SO QUICK WITH HIS HANDS?

270
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,416
- CHICKS IN A TWO-PIECE
ARE AN EASY MARK.

271
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,666
I COULD'VE TOLD YOU THAT.

272
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,166
- SO, WHAT DO WE DO?

273
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,125
HE'S COMING FOR US.
YOU KNOW HE IS.

274
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,458
LISTEN, YOU AND THE VP
GO HIDE SOMEWHERE.

275
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:35,375
KUZUHA AND I CAN TAKE
CARE OF STICKY FINGERS.

276
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,250
BACK WHILE EVERYONE
WAS CHARGING AT 'EM,

277
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,666
SHE AND I MADE
SOME PREPARATIONS,

278
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,333
IF YA CATCH MY DRIFT.

279
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:43,166
- ON SECOND THOUGHT,
STAY FOR THE FUN. HE'S HERE.

280
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,666
- FOUND YA, GIRLS. HUH?

281
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,958
- SORRY, PERVERT! TIME TO EVEN
THE ODDS WITH SOME MAGIC!

282
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:55,416
- LITTLE KUZUHA'S AN EARTH TYPE,
AND I LIKE TO ROCK THE H2O.

283
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,958
YOU'RE FIGHTIN' THE HOME TEAM.

284
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,583
KISS THOSE SHORTS GOODBYE!

285
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,500
- ( scoffs ) SHOW ME
WHAT YOU GOT!

286
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,583
- I'LL BE TAKIN' THAT!

287
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,000
- I DON'T THINK SO!

288
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,416
- OWW!

289
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,708
- TRAPS ARE ONE OF THE MANY
PERKS OF BEING THE HOME-TEAM.

290
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,666
- NOW ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IS RUN DOWN THE CLOCK

291
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,833
UNTIL THE HOUR IS UP

292
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,250
AND OUR SWIMSUITS
WILL BE SAFE AND SOUND.

293
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,625
OR IF YOU'RE FEELING BALLSY,

294
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,333
WE COULD MAKE A GRAB
FOR THOSE TRUNKS.

295
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,125
SPLIT THE PRIZE MONEY TWO WAYS?

296
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:34,666
- HOW ABOUT THREE? I THINK WE'LL
NEED MIU'S HELP TO GET THEM OFF.

297
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,791
HE'S GONE!

298
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,083
CHIKAGE!

299
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,583
THAT WAS DESIGNED TO FALL
IN ON YOU! HOW'D YOU ESCAPE?

300
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,625
- Akatsuki: I CAN WALK ON WATER,
FOR CRYIN' OUT LOUD.

301
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,708
YOU THINK SAND'S GONNA
HARSH MY MELLOW?

302
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:49,666
NOW, THEN. THAT'S A REAL
NICE ONE-PIECE YOU'VE GOT.

303
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,375
- Y-YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

304
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:53,625
- HEY, WHERE'S THE FAITH?

305
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,416
I'VE PULLED OFF TOUGHER
ONES THAN THAT.

306
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,708
I'LL HAVE YOU OUTTA THAT
WITHOUT RIPPING A STITCH!

307
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:02,125
- HEY, NOW!
COOL YOUR JETS, COMPADRE!

308
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,625
THEY'RE GONNA AIR THIS THING
ON PAY-PER-VIEW, REMEMBER?

309
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,875
I KNOW A LITTLE JIGGLE
MAKES THE RATINGS GO AROUND,

310
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:07,875
BUT THEY'RE GONNA CAN US

311
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,458
IF YOU START GOING
FULL PEDO-BEAR.

312
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:12,458
- OH, YEAH. YOU DID SAY
SOMETHING ABOUT A TV PROGRAM.

313
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:15,666
YOU'RE PRETTY FAST FOR A DUDE
AT THE BEACH IN SANDALS, I MEAN.

314
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,333
- WELL, I CAN'T RUN ON THE OCEAN
LIKE SOME PEOPLE, BUT I DO OKAY.

315
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:22,458
ALL RIGHT! FORTY MINUTES DOWN,
TWENTY TO GO. WHAT'S THE PLAN?

316
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,375
- NOBODY LIKES A QUITTER, RIGHT?

317
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,625
WELL THEN, LET'S GO GET
SOME GIRLS NAKED.

318
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:29,166
MAN, IF THERE ARE ANY GIRLS
OUT THERE STILL PLAYING THE GAME

319
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,541
THEY'D BETTER RUN.

320
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:33,458
- HMM. SO IT'S COME DOWN
TO YOU VERSUS AKATSUKI, HUH?

321
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,333
AT LEAST THEY'RE HANGING OUT.

322
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:40,375
- HEY.

323
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,458
- HARUKA?

324
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,500
- MINAMI? WHAT'RE YOU DOING
IN THE SHOWERS?

325
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,916
- I'M RINSING OFF
THIS SUNTAN LOTION.

326
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,541
ISN'T THAT WHAT
YOU'RE DOING IN HERE?

327
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:52,791
- YEAH! LOOK AT THIS SAND.
I'D BETTER GET CLEAN ASAP!

328
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,333
- THEY DID SAY BUILDINGS ON
THE BEACH WERE FAIR GAME.

329
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,250
SO TOO BAD FOR HIM IF HE
DOESN'T THINK TO LOOK HERE.

330
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,875
- ( door opens )

331
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,458
- HEY. THERE YOU ARE.

332
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,916
THIS SHOULD BE OLD HAT
TO YOU BY NOW, RIGHT?

333
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,250
- HA! HOLD IT!

334
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,250
STATE FOR THE RECORD
WHERE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW!

335
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:09,333
- UH, IN A SHOWER-ROOM
FULL OF NAKED, WET WOMEN?

336
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:10,541
- Haruka: CORRECT!

337
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,375
WHICH I'M SURE IS A
DISQUALIFIABLE OFFENSE!

338
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,333
- OH, I WOULDN'T COUNT ON
THAT IF I WERE YOU.

339
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:17,166
THAT HOST CHICK SAID I COULD GO
ANYWHERE ON THE BEACH I WANTED

340
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,125
AND SHE DIDN'T SAY NO BUILDINGS.

341
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,833
- BUT THEY CAN'T LET YOU
DO THAT, IT'S ILLEGAL.

342
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,916
- SURE, AND TWENTY
MINUTES FROM NOW

343
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,375
IF YOU STILL SEE
ME STANDIN' HERE,

344
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:26,791
FEEL FREE TO CALL THE COPS.

345
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:29,791
UNTIL THEN, THE RULES OF
SWIMSUIT TAG SAY IT'S ALL GOOD.

346
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,208
- I DUNNO, MAN.

347
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:33,041
- THAT'S A PRETTY
CONVOLUTED INTERPRETATION

348
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,250
OF THE RULES, AKKI.

349
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,458
THOUGH I GOTTA ADMIT,

350
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:37,208
I'M GETTING SOME GREAT
FOOTAGE OUT OF THIS.

351
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,958
HEY!

352
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:41,583
- IF YOU THINK YOU'RE GETTING
MY TOP AS EASILY AS THE OTHERS,

353
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:42,958
YOU'RE IN FOR A DISAPPOINTMENT!

354
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,625
- THAT'S THE SPIRIT!
I'M IN THE MOOD FOR A CHALLENGE!

355
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:49,458
- MUCH BETTER.

356
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:51,750
- OOH.

357
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,416
- YES! VICTORY IS MINE!

358
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,583
- OOPS-A-DAISY.

359
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,291
- WELL. I'M NOT GOING TO
THANK YOU, SO THERE.

360
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:05,291
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
THESE ARE THANKS ENOUGH.

361
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,416
- WHAT ARE?

362
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,625
( screaming )

363
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:11,708
- SWIMSUIT GET!
- GIVE 'EM BACK! IMMEDIATELY!

364
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,750
- STANDING UP JUST
SHOWS ME EVERYTHING, YOU KNOW.

365
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:18,083
- HUH? YOU DIDN'T TAKE
ANY OTHER BOTTOMS, SO WHY MINE?

366
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:19,583
- JUST FELT LIKE IT.
- ARGH!

367
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:22,041
- I HAD FUN HANGING OUT.
LET'S DO IT AGAIN!

368
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,250
- Haruka: YOU GET BACK HERE,
AKATSUKI OUSAWA!

369
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,791
- HE'S NEVER GONNA FIND ME
WAY OUT HERE.

370
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:29,041
- 'SUP.
- HUH?

371
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,625
YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING ME!

372
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:34,166
- I CAN SENSE YOUR ENERGY
FROM A MILE AWAY, YOU KNOW THAT.

373
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,916
SO, HOW THEY HANGING?

374
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:39,666
- ( burbling )

375
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,750
- THANKS FOR THE HELP.

376
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,875
- HEY, NOW, JUST BEING A HERO.
THE PLEASURE WAS ALL MINE.

377
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,250
- WHAT KIND OF A HERO
GRABS A GIRL LIKE THIS?

378
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:55,958
- DON'T FORGET, YOU
DID ALMOST DROWN

379
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,833
TRYING TO KEEP THEM
COVERED YOURSELF.

380
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,500
I'M MERELY TAKING
TWO FOR THE TEAM.

381
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,583
- YOU KNOW THERE'S
A BETTER WAY TO DO THAT!

382
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:04,208
- ACTUALLY, I THINK
YOU'RE RIGHT. VOILA!

383
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,750
THIS FABRIC'S WAY TOO SLIPPERY.

384
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,125
THE BEST WAY TO GET A FIRM GRIP

385
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,583
IS TO GO UNDERNEATH IT
AND OPT FOR SKIN-ON-SKIN.

386
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:11,666
- ( screaming )

387
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,250
YOU'RE AWFUL!

388
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,500
- Announcer: THAT'S IT,
PARTY PEOPLE!

389
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:15,875
THE HOUR OF TAG IS UP!

390
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,333
UNFORTUNATELY FOR OUR TARGET,

391
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,125
THE WATER ITSELF
IS OUT OF BOUNDS!

392
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:22,083
SORRY, 87 AND 88,
BUT WE GOTTA DISQUALIFY YOU!

393
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,916
NO ONE WINS THE
CASH MONEY THIS YEAR!

394
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,333
- HUH? DISQUALIFIED?

395
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:29,375
OH, NO! I'M SORRY
I MADE YOU LOSE.

396
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:32,458
- AT LEAST I'M WALKING AWAY
WITH THE BOOBY PRIZE!

397
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:35,041
WASN'T RION THE DESIGNER WHO
MADE THOSE SEE THROUGH UNDIES

398
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,291
THAT FREAKED YOU OUT?

399
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,333
- WAIT, CAN YOU SEE EVERYTHING?

400
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,166
- THIS OUGHT TO KEEP
YOU COVERED UP.

401
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,791
MAKE SURE THAT YOU
HOLD ON TIGHT NOW.

402
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,375
'CAUSE HERE WE GO!

403
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:51,833
- I ASK YOU TO MAKE A LIFE
WITH WHOMEVER ENDS ME.

404
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,333
- I'M SORRY, DAD,
BUT I DON'T THINK I CAN DO IT.

405
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:58,166
I MEAN, HE'S A HERO AND I'M...

406
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,291
- Miranda: THE
DARK LORD'S DAUGHTER.

407
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,583
AND WE'RE TO BELIEVE
THAT AKATSUKI, OF ALL PEOPLE,

408
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,750
SPIRITED HER
AWAY TO HIS REALM?

409
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,333
LORD BARAM SEEMED SO SURE,
BUT WHAT OF THAT?

410
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:09,041
AKATSUKI DEFEATED GARIUS,

411
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:11,375
THE MOST POWERFUL DARK LORD
OUR WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN,

412
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:12,750
IN SINGLE COMBAT.

413
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:16,041
TO TRY AND BRAND HIM A TRAITOR,
IT SITS ILL WITH ME.

414
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:19,208
- Listy: INDEED. WHY WOULD HE
SUGGEST SUCH A THING?

415
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,541
- Ludie: IF THE ACCUSATION
IS FOUND TO LACK MERIT,

416
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:24,750
HE KNOWS HE'LL BE TAKEN TO TASK
FOR HIS SLANDEROUS WORDS.

417
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:27,708
- Zechs: YET HE IS STILL
CONFIDENT, FOR ALL OF THAT.

418
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:30,625
- Baram: I HOPE YOU CAN
FORGIVE MY LATE ARRIVAL.

419
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,291
- Miranda: OF COURSE,
LORD BARAM.

420
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,291
AND NOW THAT YOU'RE HERE,
PERHAPS YOU MIGHT TELL US

421
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:37,541
HOW YOU INTEND TO SEND A
SEARCH PARTY THROUGH THE GATE.

422
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,208
THE OTHERWORLD
GATE ONLY RESPONDS

423
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:40,875
TO THOSE FROM REALMS UNKNOWN

424
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:43,083
SUCH HAS ITS NATURE ALWAYS BEEN.

425
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:45,583
WHO, THEN, CAN TREK
TO AKATSUKI'S LAND BEYOND

426
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,958
AND PROVE THE GUILT
YOU ASSIGN HIM?

427
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,125
- I HAVE TAKEN THAT
INTO ACCOUNT.

428
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,750
MIGHT I INTRODUCE PHIL BURNETT?

429
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:55,208
FORTUNATELY, HE HAILS FROM
THE SAME WORLD AS THE TRAITOR.

430
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:59,041
- I AM HONORED TO MEET YOU,
MY FAIR QUEEN LISTY.

431
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,083
- PHIL SHALL RETURN
FROM WHENCE HE CAME.

432
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:03,750
THERE HE WILL TRACK
DOWN GARIUS'S SPAWN

433
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,375
AND PROVE TO YOU SHE
IS NO HARMLESS GIRL.

434
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,416
I TRUST NONE OF YOU
HAS AN OBJECTION

435
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,750
TO THIS COURSE OF ACTION.

436
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:12,166
IF YOU DO, I SUGGEST
THAT YOU SPEAK IT NOW

437
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,458
OR I WILL INTERPRET
YOUR SILENCE AS CONSENT.

438
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:17,041
- DO AS YOU WILL.

439
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,750
- I'M COUNTING ON YOU, PHIL,

440
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,541
TO SEEK OUT THE
DARK LORD'S DAUGHTER

441
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,666
AND BRING HER BACK HERE
TO FACE HER FATE.

442
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,500
- AS YOU WISH, MY LORD.

443
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,791
- LORD BARAM! DON'T TELL ME
YOU INTEND TO HAVE THE GIRL

444
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,250
BROUGHT BACK HERE IN SHACKLES!

445
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,708
EVEN IF OUTSIDERS COULD
TRAVEL HERE A SECOND TIME,

446
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,250
WHICH THEY CANNOT,
I FIND THIS-

447
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,583
- AND WHO'S TO SAY THEY CANNOT?

448
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,791
- YOU'RE SAYING
THERE IS A WAY TO DO IT?

449
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,083
( thinking ) HE COULD
COME BACK TO ME.

450
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,791
- Phil: I TAKE MY LEAVE OF YOU,
QUEEN LISTY.

451
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,708
I ALMOST FORGOT.

452
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,333
SAY THIS HERO TRIES
TO PREVENT ME

453
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:51,208
FROM CARRYING OUT YOUR
ORDERS, WHAT AM I TO DO?

454
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,916
- IF IT SHOULD EVER COME
TO THAT, STRIKE HIM DOWN.

455
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,750
- YOU WOULD HAVE HIM KILLED?

456
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,250
IN A HEARTBEAT. THE DARK
LORD'S DAUGHTER IS A THREAT

457
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,541
TO THE GOOD
OF OUR WORLD.

458
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,541
ANYONE WHO AIDS HER IN
HER ESCAPE FROM US

459
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:02,916
IS A FOE TO US ALL.

460
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,625
ARE THEY NOT?

461
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:08,416
- BUT HE WOULD NEVER! AKATSUKI
OUSAWA IS OUR GREATEST HERO!

462
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,666
- YOU KNOW THE TRUTH
OF THE MAN, QUEEN LISTY.

463
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,458
HE'S NO HERO FROM ON HIGH.

464
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:15,583
HE'S A ROGUE! YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN
YOUR KINGDOM'S TRUE HERO,

465
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,416
MAY HIS SOUL FIND ETERNAL REST.

466
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,625
YOU WRONG THE GHOST
OF LEON ESPERIO.

467
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:22,916
LEON, WHO DIED PROTECTING YOUR
AKATSUKI FROM THE DARK LORD

468
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,291
HE WOULD EVENTUALLY
SLAY, AND THEN,

469
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:28,208
WHEN THE SO-CALLED HERO
OF SHELLFEED RAN LIKE A DOG,

470
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,125
YOU WERE FORCED TO
ABANDON YOUR CAPITAL,

471
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,708
AND MAKE FOR THE
SAFETY OF ALECLASTA.

472
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,375
YOUR HERO IS A COWARD.

473
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,333
- THE ONLY REASON ANY
OF US ARE ALIVE

474
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,458
TO LISTEN TO THIS
FOUL-TONGUED VITRIOL

475
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,791
IS THAT THE MAN YOU CONDEMN
AS A COWARD

476
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,458
LED THE CHARGE
TO RETAKE OUR LAND

477
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,083
IN THE FACE OF CERTAIN DEATH!

478
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:47,166
HE ACCEPTED THE
TITLE OF ROGUE HERO

479
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,125
OUT OF REMORSE FOR
LEON'S SACRIFICE,

480
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,625
WITHOUT WHICH AKATSUKI
SURELY WOULD HAVE DIED!

481
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,333
YOU WRONG A GREAT MAN
WITH YOUR WORDS, LORD BARAM.

482
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:57,166
FALL SILENT, LEST YOU DISHONOR
YOURSELF FURTHER!

483
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,208
- PAINT YOUR FORMER CHAMPION
IN WHATEVER LIGHT YOU DEEM FIT.

484
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,125
BUT DO NOT EXPECT ME
TO SHARE YOUR FAITH

485
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:03,708
IN HE WHO IS FAITHLESS.

486
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:06,791
I WILL TAKE BACK MY WORDS WHEN
HIS INNOCENCE HAS BEEN PROVEN

487
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,125
AND NOT A MOMENT BEFORE,

488
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,041
THOUGH HELL ITSELF
MAY RAGE AT ME.

489
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,708
THAT WILL HAVE TO SUFFICE.

490
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,708
- Ludie: LORD BARAM,
A QUESTION, IF I MAY.

491
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,041
- WHAT IS IT?

492
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:18,250
- IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER
TO SEND OUT YOUR MAN

493
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,791
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

494
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:22,583
YET SEVERAL DAYS HAVE PASSED
SINCE OUR TRILATERAL CONFERENCE.

495
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:25,208
THIS DELAY CAN ONLY HAVE SERVED
TO MUDDY THE TRAIL.

496
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:28,208
- AH, THE BLAME FOR THAT
LIES SQUARELY ON MY SHOULDERS,

497
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:29,291
I'M AFRAID.

498
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,333
MY LORD BARAM
IMPLORED ME TO HURRY,

499
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,791
BUT MY PREPARATIONS
TOOK SOME TIME.

500
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,583
- I SEE. ONE LAST QUESTION THEN.

501
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:39,041
PROVIDED YOU DON'T
OBJECT TO THE ASKING.

502
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:41,666
- NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST.
ASK AWAY.

503
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,958
- YOU MEAN TO BEST A HERO.

504
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:47,125
CAN YOU PROVE YOU'RE ABLE?

505
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:48,708
- ( theme song playing )

506
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:50,041
- ( singing in Japanese )

507
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:19,791
- Listy: LORD BARAM
THINKS AKATSUKI

508
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:23,166
SECRETED GARIUS'S DAUGHTER AWAY
TO THE WORLD OF HIS BIRTH,

509
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,625
AND NOW HE SPEAKS OF
BRINGING HER BACK TO ALAYZARD,

510
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:28,291
WHICH SHOULDN'T EVEN
BE POSSIBLE TO BEGIN WITH!

511
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:31,708
WHAT HAS INSPIRED LORD BARAM
TO ENTERTAIN THESE THOUGHTS?

512
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:33,541
AND WHY DOES HIS
CHAMPION CARRY HIMSELF

513
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:36,041
WITH SUCH AN EERIE
AIR OF CONFIDENCE?

514
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:38,375
HE ACTS AS THOUGH HE KNOWS
HE CAN BEST AKATSUKI,

515
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,500
SLAYER OF THE DARK LORD.

516
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:43,625
NEXT EPISODE,
BABEL'S RANKING MATCHES BEGIN.

517
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:45,041
IT SOUNDS AS THOUGH
WAR IS BREWING

518
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:46,916
ON BOTH SIDES OF THE GATE!
