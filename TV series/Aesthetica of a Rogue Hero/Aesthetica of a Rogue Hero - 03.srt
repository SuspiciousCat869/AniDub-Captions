1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,625
- ( shuts shower tap )

2
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:18,500
- Akatsuki: MORNING.

3
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:21,208
- ( yawning )

4
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:23,416
- HMPH!

5
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:35,000
- OKAY.
- HMPH!

6
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:39,416
- Akatsuki: WHERE'S THE FIRE?

7
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,875
HELLO?

8
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:48,875
ALL RIGHTY.
PREDICTABLE REACTION.

9
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:50,958
I'M LUCKY SHE HASN'T
PUNCHED ME IN THE CROTCH.

10
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,708
- ( bell ringing )

11
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:01,375
- ( people chattering )

12
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:04,833
- Onizuka: SUP, TANAKA?

13
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:07,625
WAY TO RESERVE MY PLACE.

14
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:09,583
I'D DO IT MYSELF, BUT
SOMETHING ABOUT WAITING

15
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:11,041
BRINGS OUT THE WORST IN ME.

16
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:12,875
- SURE. NO PROBLEM.

17
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:21,416
- GOT SOMETHING YOU WANNA
SAY ABOUT IT, DICK WEEDS?

18
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,625
- Akatsuki: SUP, ONIZUKA?

19
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:28,500
THANKS FOR RESERVING MY PLACE.

20
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:30,291
I'D WAIT MYSELF, BUT
SOMETHING ABOUT LINES

21
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:32,291
JUST BRINGS OUT THE WORST IN ME.

22
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:40,500
- ( chuckling )

23
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:43,041
- YO, TANAKA.

24
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:46,958
- HEY. YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO DO THAT.

25
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:48,000
- NOPE.

26
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:50,500
- WOW.

27
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:52,416
- MOVE OVER, ONIZUKA.
THERE'S A NEW SHERIFF IN TOWN.

28
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,291
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU GUYS,
BUT I SMELL LEGEND.

29
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:56,583
- ( grunting )

30
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:57,708
THAT BASTARD!

31
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,625
- ( theme song playing )

32
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:01,666
- ( singing in Japanese )

33
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:39,041
- Chikage: SHRIMP, HUH?
DON'T MIND IF I DO.

34
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:41,500
- THAT'S MINE!

35
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,083
- MMM. MMM.

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,041
- HEY.

37
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,541
- WHERE IS KUZUHA?

38
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,333
- I BET SHE'S GETTING
THE THIRD DEGREE.

39
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:53,166
THE STUDENT COUNCIL TENDS
TO FROWN ON PEOPLE

40
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,708
RUNNING AMOK
ON YOUR WATCH, YOU KNOW?

41
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:58,541
YUP, POOR THING'S GONNA
HAVE TO ANSWER FOR THE HI-JINX

42
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:01,500
OF A CERTAIN DOOR-KICKING,
BULLY-BAITING, PANTY-SNATCHING

43
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:04,625
LOOSE CANNON
WHO SHALL REMAIN NAMELESS.

44
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:07,333
I'M PRETTY SURE LURING INNOCENT
GIRLS INTO THE EQUIPMENT ROOM

45
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,208
WAS THE FINAL STRAW.

46
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:12,416
- BUT, I MEAN,
THAT WASN'T ALL HER FAULT.

47
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,291
SHE'S GONNA GET IN TROUBLE
FOR THAT?

48
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,750
- SOUNDS LIKE IT'S
KINDA EATING YOU.

49
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,208
DON'T GET ME WRONG.
I'D BE PRETTY TWISTED

50
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,666
IF THE STUDENT COUNCIL
HAD IT IN FOR MY BIG BROTHER.

51
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:30,208
- YEAH, I'M NOT SURE
IF THAT'S REALLY IT.

52
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,791
THIS MAY SOUND WEIRD,

53
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:35,208
BUT I THINK THE AMNESIA MAKES IT
HARD TO SEE HIM AS A BROTHER.

54
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:38,541
- AH. WELL, NO POINT
IN FORCING IT, I GUESS.

55
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:41,583
YOUR MEMORIES ARE BOUND TO COME
CRAWLING BACK SOONER OR LATER.

56
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,041
I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

57
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,875
MAYBE YOU JUST NEED TO BE
AROUND HIM A WHILE LONGER.

58
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:47,083
- YEAH. MAYBE.

59
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:54,958
- OH! THERE SHE IS!

60
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,208
- ( door shuts )

61
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,375
SO. THEY PUT THE SCREWS TO YOU?

62
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:03,958
- SORRY, BUT,
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

63
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,875
THAT WOULD BE NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

64
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,375
- JEEZ. FINE.

65
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,208
- IF THERE'S ANYTHING WE CAN
SAY TO GET YOU OUT OF THIS,

66
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:13,000
ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS ASK.

67
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,208
- WHAT IS THAT?
- HMM?

68
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,333
- YOU'RE AWARE THE SCHOOL
BYLAWS STRICTLY PROHIBIT

69
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,041
ACCESSORIZING OF ANY KIND.

70
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,750
- OH! I'M SO SORRY,
I HAD NO IDEA.

71
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:24,208
IT'S NOT HER FAULT, I GAVE
THAT DOLL TO HER AS A PRESENT

72
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,916
DON'T BE MAD.

73
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,458
- HEY, SOMETIMES A GESTURE
IS WORTH BREAKING THE RULES,

74
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,791
AND SHE MADE ONE FOR YOU, TOO,
SO MAYBE EASE UP.

75
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,333
- I ACCEPT THE GESTURE,
BUT NOT THE PRESENT.

76
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,625
- LOOK, DON'T
TAKE IT PERSONALLY.

77
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,750
SHE'D BE THAT WAY
WITH SANTA CLAUS.

78
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:51,166
- ( piano music playing )

79
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,250
- HO-HO.

80
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,833
THIS ONE IS DELICATE.

81
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,166
- Kuzuha: ONCE UPON A TIME,
THERE WAS A LITTLE GIRL

82
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,291
WHO WOKE UP IN A STRANGE
WORLD ALL ALONE.

83
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,333
AFTER SHE'D FOUND HER WAY BACK,

84
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:04,666
SHE WAS DROPPED INTO A WORLD
JUST AS STRANGE.

85
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,750
ONE WHERE SHE STOOD
OUT LIKE A SORE THUMB.

86
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,333
I'M TOO YOUNG
TO BE HERE ANYWAY.

87
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:13,375
MAYBE I OUGHT TO
CALL THE COUNCIL'S BLUFF.

88
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:19,583
- ROOM FOR ONE MORE?

89
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,750
- Akatsuki: SO WHAT'LL
CALL OFF THE DOGS?

90
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,416
- HUH?

91
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,041
- YOU AND ME BOTH KNOW THE
HIGHER UPS HAVE YOU CORNERED.

92
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,416
I'M NOT A DOUCHE.

93
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,041
IT'S MY FAULT
YOU'RE IN THIS MESS.

94
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,083
SO LET ME HELP YOU
GET THEM OFF YOUR BACK.

95
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,333
WHATEVER THEY WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT ME, YOU'VE GOT IT,

96
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,500
FREE OF CHARGE.

97
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,958
LOOK, I'M NOT AN EASY TARGET
FOR SPYING.

98
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,708
IF YOU WANNA REACH
THE CARROT THEY'RE DANGLING

99
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:55,250
I SUGGEST WE, UH,
YOU KNOW, COME TO TERMS.

100
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,958
- HUMBLING THOUGHT.

101
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,541
AM I THAT TRANSPARENT?

102
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,791
THEY EXPECT A REPORT
EVERY MORNING.

103
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,333
YOUR HABITS,
YOUR MOOD, EVERYTHING.

104
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:11,291
THE "CARROT" IS ME NOT GETTING
SHIPPED BACK TO MY OLD SCHOOL.

105
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,125
- Akatsuki: AND?

106
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:16,958
- AND I'M THINKING ABOUT TELLING
THEM EXACTLY WHERE TO SHOVE IT.

107
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,500
- Chikage: LOOK, DON'T
TAKE IT PERSONALLY.

108
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,625
SHE'D BE THAT WAY
WITH SANTA CLAUS.

109
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,166
- HANGING AROUND
WITH A BUNCH OF OLDER KIDS

110
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,791
ISN'T HOW I WANT
TO GROW UP ANYWAY.

111
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:29,708
WHEN YOU GET RIGHT DOWN TO IT,
I DON'T BELONG HERE.

112
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,166
SEE YOU AROUND.

113
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,291
- NO. YOU'RE NOT A QUITTER.

114
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,833
DON'T PACK YOUR BAGS YET.

115
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,125
- Miu: I APPRECIATE YOU
WALKING HOME WITH ME.

116
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:48,708
- ( both exclaim )

117
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:55,375
- EASY, LOVE. I ENJOY AFTERNOON
DELIGHT AS MUCH AS THE NEXT GAL.

118
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:58,000
BUT, SAVE THE COME-ONS FOR
A BETTER NEIGHBORHOOD, HUH?

119
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,041
- LOOK, SILLY!
- HUH?

120
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,000
- UNLIKELY PAIRING.

121
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,208
OOH! THAT'S NOT
GONNA END WELL FOR HER.

122
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,208
- Miu: WHAT IS THAT PLACE?

123
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:20,375
"MANGA CAFE WAI-WAI: COUPLE'S
ROOMS, COMPLETE WITH SHOWERS."

124
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,208
- YOU THINK WE SHOULD GO IN?

125
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:23,333
- YOU BET I DO!

126
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:28,375
- Kuzuha: THIS IS
OFFICIALLY CREEPY. I'M OUT.

127
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:29,500
YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF NERVE

128
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,416
DRAGGING ME TO
A PLACE LIKE THIS.

129
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,333
GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME!
I'M GOING HOME!

130
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:36,458
- SHUT UP.
PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO UNWIND.

131
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:37,833
GIVE THEM A BREAK, HUH?

132
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,458
- ( Kuzuha groaning )

133
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,625
- LOOK.

134
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,708
PLEASE. WHATEVER
YOU'RE GONNA DO, JUST...

135
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:11,500
YOU WANNA FIT IN WITH THE COOL
KIDS? THIS IS HOW IT'S DONE.

136
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:26,000
- Chikage: WELL? YOU HEAR THEM
GETTING IT ON, OR WHAT?

137
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,833
- NOTHING. AT LEAST,
I DON'T THINK SO.

138
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,833
- ( she gasps )

139
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,208
- Chikage: KEEP IT DOWN.

140
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,208
YOU GET TOO LOUD AND THE
OTHER GUESTS WILL GET PISSY.

141
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:37,541
- STOP IT!

142
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:40,583
HUH? WHAT'RE YOU DOING?
THIS ISN'T WHY WE'RE HERE!

143
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:43,541
- OH, WHATEVER, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO PICKED THIS PLACE OUT.

144
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,416
RELAX, EH?
I ONLY BITE IF YOU ASK.

145
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,875
- THIS... THIS IS EXACTLY
THE KIND OF THING I MEANT

146
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,458
WHEN I SAID I DIDN'T BELONG.

147
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,125
- AGE IS JUST
A NUMBER, SWEETHEART.

148
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:56,833
- NO.

149
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:57,916
NO, IT'S NOT.

150
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:00,625
AGE IS...

151
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,375
AGE IS THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN SOMEONE

152
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:03,833
WHO CAN TAKE THE
TEMPERATURE OF THE ROOM

153
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,125
AND SOMEONE WHO CAN'T.

154
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,166
- OH, REALLY?
THEN I'M SCREWED.

155
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,958
ESPECIALLY SINCE I'M
ABOUT TO DO THIS TO YOU

156
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,625
WHEN YOU'RE CLEARLY NOT ON
BOARD WITH THE WHOLE IDEA.

157
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,666
TAKING THE TEMPERATURE
OF THE ROOM?

158
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,875
IF THAT WERE TRUE,

159
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,750
THEN ADULTHOOD WOULD
MEAN INDULGING EVERYONE

160
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,291
IN EXACTLY THE KIND OF
PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE BULLSHIT

161
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,041
THAT KEEPS THEM FROM
BEING ABLE TO COMMUNICATE

162
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,916
LIKE ADULTS
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

163
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,458
IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.

164
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,291
IT'S ABOUT BEING HONEST
WITH YOURSELF.

165
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,375
- Miu: I'M ASKING YOU
NICELY TO STOP.

166
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,791
- Chikage: YEAH, BUT,
NOT SUPER CONVINCINGLY.

167
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,916
NOTHING WRONG BEING
FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS.

168
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,958
- Miu: NO! PLEASE!

169
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,166
- Akatsuki: IF YOU'RE ANGRY,
BE ANGRY.

170
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,916
IF YOU'RE SAD, BE SAD.

171
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,083
- THANK YOU.
I THINK I GET IT NOW.

172
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,291
I HAVE TO LEARN
TO SPEAK UP FOR MYSELF.

173
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,333
THERE'S MORE TO YOU
THAN MEETS THE EYE.

174
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:02,208
- BE MY GUEST IF YOU WANNA
INCLUDE THAT IN TODAY'S REPORT.

175
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:03,916
IN FACT, JUST TO SPICE
THINGS UP A LITTLE BIT,

176
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,458
MAKE ME OUT TO BE A TOTAL JERK.

177
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:06,625
- ( Miu groaning )

178
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,250
- I TOLD YOU
I DON'T WANNA DO THAT.

179
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,666
- Chikage: LIGHTEN UP!
I WAS JUST KIDDING AROUND.

180
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:13,833
- YEAH, RIGHT.

181
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:14,833
- Akatsuki: WHAT IS
THIS ALL ABOUT?

182
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,750
- OH, JUST DOING
WHAT FRIENDS DO.

183
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:19,416
- MIND TELLING US WHAT YOU TWO
ARE UP TO IN A PLACE LIKE THIS?

184
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,291
- DID HE TOUCH YOU, KUZUHA?

185
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:24,041
JUST SO YOU KNOW, IT'S TOTALLY
OKAY FOR YOU TO SMACK HIM!

186
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,166
- IT'S OKAY.

187
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,500
I'M AWARE OF WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE,

188
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,541
BUT ALL HE DID WAS
TEMPORARILY IMMOBILIZE ME.

189
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:31,750
- YOU BASTARD! UGH!

190
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,333
- SHE'S A LITTLE YOUNG TO BE
"IMMOBILIZED," DON'T YOU THINK?

191
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:35,750
- PERVERT!

192
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,375
- Kuzuha: HE'LL EXPLAIN
THINGS BETTER THAN I COULD.

193
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:38,458
SURELY.

194
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,166
- ( Haruka screaming )

195
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:45,416
I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE HAS
THE AUDACITY TO BE LATE

196
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,000
WHEN WE MADE IT EXPRESSLY CLEAR

197
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:50,708
WHAT WAS AT STAKE SHOULD SHE
TREAT THIS ASSIGNMENT LIGHTLY!

198
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:53,250
- COME ON, SHE'S NOT THAT LATE.
LET'S JUST CUT HER SOME SLACK.

199
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,958
- I DON'T THINK IT'S WORTH
GETTING UPSET.

200
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:57,208
- FINE. WE'LL DETERMINE
HER PUNISHMENT LATER.

201
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,958
BUT AS FOR AKATSUKI,

202
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,583
THERE IS NO SLACK!
I WILL NOT STAND BY

203
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:05,916
AND CONTINUE LETTING HIM
MAKE US LOOK LIKE FOOLS!

204
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,041
- THAT GUY REALLY
GETS UNDER YOUR SKIN.

205
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,500
- IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD
THAT HE SAW YOUR PANTIES.

206
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:13,000
- SEE THEM?
HE TOOK THEM OFF MY...

207
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,708
IN ANY EVENT, AS OF NOW,

208
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,500
I'M REFERRING HIS CASE DIRECTLY
TO THE DISCIPLINE COMMITTEE.

209
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:18,000
- ( door opens )
- ( footsteps )

210
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:23,791
- MR. PRESIDENT!

211
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,583
WE NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT THIS, UH...

212
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,875
- ALL ISSUES RELATING
TO AKATSUKI OUSAWA

213
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,291
ARE TO BE DEALT WITH BY ME.

214
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,250
I TRUST YOU HAVE NO OBJECTIONS?

215
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,291
- LIKE THAT?

216
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,625
- GOOD. THAT'S AN ARMS DEVICE,
OR A.D. FOR SHORT.

217
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,625
WHEN PROPERLY EQUIPPED,
IT'LL MATERIALIZE

218
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,000
IN THE FORM OF WHATEVER WEAPON

219
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,541
BEST SUITS YOUR
SITUATION AND APTITUDE.

220
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,833
YOU CAN CONSCIOUSLY WILL IT
TO VANISH WHEN YOU'RE DONE,

221
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,208
OR, WORST CASE SCENARIO,

222
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,375
IF YOU'RE KNOCKED OUT
IT'LL DO SO AUTOMATICALLY.

223
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:28,333
- LET ME SEE.

224
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,375
HUH! WELL, THAT WAS EASY.

225
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:35,041
- AND HOW ABOUT YOU?
ANY LUCK THERE?

226
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,916
- YEAH. NOT SO MUCH.

227
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,916
- YOU HAVE TO REALLY
CONCENTRATE DON'T OVERTHINK IT.

228
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,250
THIS IS NO DIFFERENT
THAN EVERYDAY MAGIC.

229
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,875
- THAT DOESN'T DO US
A LOT OF GOOD.

230
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:46,375
ME AND MAGIC AREN'T
NECESSARILY BEST PALS.

231
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:47,875
- ( sighing )

232
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,833
YOU KNOW, I AM SINCERELY
LOOKING FORWARD TO THE DAY

233
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:52,875
WHEN SOMETHING ABOUT YOU
DOESN'T THROW ME FOR A LOOP.

234
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,666
BEFORE WE START
WITH YOUR COMBAT TRAINING,

235
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,500
I WANT EVERYONE TO SPLIT OFF
INTO TWO GROUPS.

236
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,041
IF YOU WANNA FIGHT AS A TEAM,

237
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,625
GET WITH ONE OR MORE
OF YOUR CLASSMATES

238
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,291
AND HIKE IT TO STADIUM ONE.

239
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,708
IF YOU FEEL LIKE GOING SOLO,

240
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:06,500
SCARE UP AN OPPONENT AND
STAY RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE.

241
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,416
- ( chattering )

242
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,041
- AH.

243
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,375
- KNOW WHAT? I THINK WE MIGHT
JUST BE THE HOTTEST TEAM HERE.

244
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:16,041
- DEFINITELY, IF YOU
LET ME JOIN.

245
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,083
- Together: HMPH!

246
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,541
IF THAT'S HOW
IT'S GOTTA BE.

247
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,083
- MAKE ME LOOK BAD
AND IT'S YOUR ASS.

248
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,625
- Akatsuki: ONIZUKA.

249
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,166
- WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT?

250
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,291
- YOU WANNA GO?

251
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:32,666
- YEAH, RIGHT,

252
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,750
LIKE I'D JUST SIGN UP TO HAVE
MY ASS HANDED TO ME.

253
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,500
- SAY YES OR I'LL KILL YOU.

254
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,083
DUDE, DON'T WET YOURSELF. I'M
YANKING YOUR CHAIN, ALL RIGHT?

255
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:45,000
I CAN'T EVEN USE
A REAL A.D., YOU KNOW.

256
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,625
THEY STUCK ME WITH
THIS PIECE OF CRAP

257
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,625
TILL WE CAN FIGURE OUT
SOMETHING LESS AWKWARD.

258
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,125
MAGIC ISN'T REALLY MY THING.

259
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,416
- WAIT, WHAT?

260
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,541
- SERIOUSLY.

261
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:55,458
- ( sniggering )

262
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,875
LET'S DANCE.

263
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,750
- Male Instructor: ALL RIGHT.
TODAY, YOU'LL BE SQUARING OFF

264
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,625
WITH CLASS FAVORITE,
THE COCKATRICE.

265
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:02,750
- ( all exclaim )

266
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,041
- Male student:
AW, I HATE THESE THINGS.

267
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,708
WE EVER GONNA FIGHT
SOMETHING LESS LAME?

268
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:09,041
- Miu: IS THIS LIKE
THEIR ENTRY LEVEL MONSTER?

269
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,416
- Chikage: KINDA. AT FULL POWER
HE CAN TURN YOU TO STONE,

270
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,750
BUT THEY'VE GOT HIM TURNED
WAY DOWN FOR US.

271
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:14,958
STAY CLEAR OF THE SHARP PARTS

272
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,250
AND YOU'VE GOT THIS
IN THE BAG, TRUST ME.

273
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,750
Kuzuha: THE CLASS HAS DEALT
WITH THEM SO OFTEN

274
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,666
WE GOT THE STRATEGY DOWN PAT.

275
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,083
IF YOU'RE A MAGE TYPE,
YOU GO WITH RANGE ATTACKS.

276
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,291
IF YOU'RE A FIGHTER TYPE,

277
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,625
WHEN THERE'S AN OPENING,
YOU STRIKE AND RUN.

278
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:27,875
- MOCK BATTLE COMMENCING,

279
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,708
SHOW ME SOME SPUNK,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!

280
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,750
- ( cockatrice screeching )

281
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,500
- Male Instructor:
OUSAWA, ONIZUKA, YOU'RE UP!

282
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,125
- DAMN.

283
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,791
I WAS BANKING ON HIM
FIGHTING THIS THING

284
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:49,750
WITH HIS FRIGGING HAREM
BEFORE MY NUMBER GOT CALLED.

285
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,083
DOESN'T MATTER.

286
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:54,750
THE BIRD AIN'T MY ONLY WEAPON.

287
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:58,083
I CAN TAKE HIM OUT MYSELF!

288
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,791
- NOW REMEMBER, THE BARRIER
CONVERTS ANY PHYSICAL INJURY

289
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,708
TO LOW LEVEL
BIO FEEDBACK SIGNALS

290
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:05,125
THAT MIMIC EMOTIONAL
DISTRESS IN YOUR AMYGDALA.

291
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:07,166
ENOUGH DAMAGE
WILL CAUSE YOU TO PASS OUT,

292
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,083
SO FOCUS ON ECONOMY OF MOVEMENT.

293
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,041
- LET'S DO IT.

294
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,375
- Male Instructor:
KEEP IT CLEAN, GUYS!

295
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,291
- ( chuckling )

296
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:21,750
OH, MAN, THAT WAS TOO EASY!

297
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:24,250
- OBVIOUSLY, ONIZUKA HERE
THOUGHT HIS BEST CHANCE TO WIN

298
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:27,666
WAS BY STARTING HIS SPELL BEFORE
I GAVE THE OKAY TO BEGIN. RIGHT?

299
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,083
- HEY, IN THE REAL WORLD,
FAIR PLAY GETS YOU DIDDLY.

300
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,625
- Akatsuki: ALL'S FAIR
IN LOVE AND WAR, RIGHT?

301
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,166
NOT THAT IT MATTERS
WHEN YOUR TIMING IS CRAP.

302
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,500
- ( shouting )

303
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:48,250
- ( swords clang )

304
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:50,916
- SO, THAT IT FOR YOU, THEN?

305
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,583
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW
LONG I CAN WATCH THIS

306
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,625
BEFORE I KICK YOUR ASS!

307
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,083
- ( he whimpers )

308
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,333
WHOA. NAP TIME ALREADY?

309
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,750
- I WARNED HIM TO FOCUS
ON ECONOMY OF MOVEMENT.

310
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,666
HE REALLY ONLY
HAS HIMSELF TO BLAME.

311
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,000
- SO UNFAIR.

312
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,500
WHY DOES THIS THING
WORK FOR HIM?

313
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:20,541
IT'S LIKE I'VE BUILT UP A
TOLERANCE FOR THEM OR SOMETHING.

314
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,375
MATTER OF FACT, LET ME
JUST TEST THAT OUT.

315
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,166
MAYBE THESE THINGS
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH JUICE.

316
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:33,458
NO WAY!

317
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:34,666
- ( cockatrice screeching )

318
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,791
- WHAT THE?

319
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,916
IT'S NEVER BEEN THIS
STRONG BEFORE!

320
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,958
- Miu: COACH, THIS IS DANGEROUS!

321
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,750
- I KNOW, I KNOW!

322
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,041
I'M TRYING TO SHUT IT DOWN, BUT
THE SECURITY SYSTEM IS OFFLINE!

323
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,041
EVERYONE, TAKE COVER!

324
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:52,583
THIS IS UGLY, SOMEONE'S
HACKED INTO THE MAINFRAME.

325
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,958
- DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO
I CAN BUY US A FEW SECONDS.

326
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,208
- BRING IT ON!

327
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,208
WHEW, THAT WAS
A CLOSE ONE, HUH?

328
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,750
- UH, THANK YOU,
MUCH APPRECIATED.

329
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,416
I SUGGEST YOU MAKE A RUN FOR IT.

330
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,958
- HERE WE GO WITH THE
SELF-RIGHTEOUS MARTYRDOM THING.

331
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:33,500
- CAN YOU PLEASE NOT ARGUE
WITH ME FOR ONCE?

332
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:34,666
- THERE'S NO ARGUMENT.

333
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,500
WE'RE NOT ABANDONING
YOU AND THAT'S THAT.

334
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,916
- YEAH. AND DON'T GO THINKING
WE'RE DOING THIS FOR YOU,

335
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,750
IT'S JUST THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA
LET YOU BE THE ONLY HERO, MISSY.

336
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,583
- MAYBE I REALLY
DO BELONG HERE.

337
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,083
- CRAZY WAY TO FIND OUT.

338
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,333
- IZUMI? OUSAWA?

339
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,500
LET'S HANDLE IT.

340
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,750
- HEY. CHECK YOU OUT!

341
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,500
- YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD REALLY
SHOW THAT SMILE MORE OFTEN.

342
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:04,541
- STOP IT.

343
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:09,000
I THINK NOW MIGHT BE A GOOD
TIME TO EVACUATE EVERYONE ELSE.

344
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,333
- OF COURSE.

345
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:13,250
I WANT EVERYONE MOVING
CALMLY TOWARD STADIUM TWO.

346
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,208
- UGH! AT THIS RATE OUR
MAGIC WILL BE TAPPED

347
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,791
BEFORE WE CAN SUBDUE HIM.

348
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,916
- THEN WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO
FOCUS WHATEVER WE'VE GOT LEFT

349
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,041
AND HIT FUGLY WHERE IT HURTS.

350
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,958
SOUND LIKE A PLAN TO YOU, CHIEF?

351
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,083
- YEAH.

352
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,250
THREE. TWO. ONE.

353
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,791
ZERO!

354
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,625
- BULL'S EYE!

355
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,208
- I WOULDN'T CELEBRATE YET.

356
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:40,541
- NOT TO BE NEGATIVE,

357
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:43,333
BUT I THINK WE JUST MADE
THINGS CONSIDERABLY WORSE.

358
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,333
- Chikage: HOORAY US. WAY TO
LET HIM FEED OFF OUR POWER.

359
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,416
- ( cockatrice screeching )

360
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:53,791
- LOOK OUT!

361
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:59,625
- IZUMI! KUZUHA, NO!

362
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,708
- ( cockatrice roars )

363
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:15,833
- THE BARRIER IS SUPPOSED TO
PROTECT US FROM PHYSICAL DAMAGE.

364
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,916
THIS SHOULDN'T EVEN BE POSSIBLE.

365
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,125
HOW IS IT TURNING
EVERYONE TO STONE?

366
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:22,958
I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING BEFORE
IT SMASHES THEM TO PIECES.

367
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:25,916
I WON'T LET THEM DIE.

368
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,291
NO! I WON'T LET YOU!

369
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:54,625
- Akatsuki: SORRY IT TOOK ME
SO LONG. YOU'RE GOOD, RIGHT?

370
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,041
TRY THIS ONE ON FOR SIZE.

371
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:02,958
- YOU DID IT!

372
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,166
UH-OH.

373
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:08,333
- YOU JUST HAD TO GO
AND PUSH YOURSELF.

374
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,916
HEY, YOU KICKED
SOME MAJOR ASS.

375
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,916
HOW ABOUT YOU REST
AND LEAVE THE KILL SHOT TO ME?

376
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,208
- CAREFUL! EVERY TIME
YOU THROW A SPELL AT IT,

377
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,375
THE STUPID THING JUST SEEMS
TO SOAK UP THE ENERGY.

378
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,541
- OH, IS THAT ALL?

379
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,500
COULD BE WORSE.

380
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,166
I JUST HAVE TO MAKE THIS COUNT.

381
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:42,000
HEY, BIRD!

382
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:46,250
BRING IT!

383
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,625
- ( theme music playing )

384
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,041
- ( singing in Japanese )

385
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:20,625
- Listy: EAGER TO PROVE
HIS METTLE

386
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:23,166
AS A CREDIT TO THE WARRIOR
AESTHETIC OF ALAYZARD,

387
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,291
THE ROGUE STOOD
AT THE FOREFRONT OF BATTLE,

388
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:27,041
LEADING THE CHARGE.

389
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:28,458
AN ARMY AT HIS BACK,

390
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:31,041
HE INSPIRED BY ACTION
RATHER THAN WORD.

391
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:34,791
EACH WARRIOR PROUD
TO FIGHT ALONGSIDE HIM.

392
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:37,333
'TIS A GIFT, ROUSING COURAGE
WITH MERELY A LOOK.

393
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,041
NEXT EPISODE, "THE HERO'S BACK"

394
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:42,416
HIS APPETITES ARE SUSPECT,

395
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,583
BUT LET THERE BE
NO QUESTION OF HIS VALOR.
