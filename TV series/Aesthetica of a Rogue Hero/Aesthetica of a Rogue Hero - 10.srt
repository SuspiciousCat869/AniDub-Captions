1
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:09,166
Akatsuki: BAD MOVE.

2
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:11,791
REAL BAD.

3
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:12,875
A PRETTY YOUNG THING CRYING

4
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:15,375
ON A BEAUTIFUL MOONLIT
NIGHT LIKE THIS?

5
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:17,166
THAT'S WHEN I STEP IN.

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,625
UNDERSTAND THIS,

7
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:20,750
YOU HURT HER AND
YOU ANSWER TO ME!

8
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,041
( yells )

9
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:33,375
JUST SIT TIGHT.

10
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:35,416
BIG BROTHER'S GOT
SOME ASS KICKING TO DO.

11
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:40,083
( grunts )

12
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,208
( yells )

13
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,333
- ( theme song playing )

14
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:47,041
- ( singing in Japanese )

15
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,333
- Akatsuki: NICE OUTFIT.

16
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:28,041
OFF THE RACK OR WHAT?

17
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:30,708
- Phil: I HAPPENED ACROSS
SOME VERY GENEROUS DONORS.

18
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:32,416
MY LUCKY DAY, REALLY.

19
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,708
- OH, YEAH? AND WHO HELPED
YOU TAKE DOWN THE BARRIER?

20
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,666
- BARRIER? OH YES, THAT.

21
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,500
NO ONE, MORE DUMB LUCK.

22
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:42,083
THE BRAT RESPONSIBLE DID
IT OF HIS OWN VOLITION.

23
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:44,208
COINCIDENCE. THOUGH I'M
THE FIRST TO ADMIT

24
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:45,958
I COULD NOT HAVE
PLANNED IT BETTER.

25
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,250
MERCENARY HEAVEN.

26
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,083
ONE SCARCELY MOVES
TWO FEET IN THIS PLACE

27
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,750
WITHOUT STUMBLING
ON SOMEONE USEFUL.

28
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:51,791
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

29
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,333
- Phil: THEY RESISTED
AT FIRST, AS PEOPLE DO.

30
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,541
BUT THEY HAD NO HOPE IN THE END.

31
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,916
NOT WITH ALL THAT I
HAVE LEARNED IN ALAYZARD.

32
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:01,833
- YOU BASTARD!

33
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:04,583
- OH, DEAR. IS MY
PREDECESSOR TROUBLED?

34
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:05,791
COME!

35
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,291
SURELY YOU'RE NOT ANGRY.

36
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:08,541
THE IRONY?

37
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:11,250
HERE WE ARE, BOTH BORN
OF THE SAME NATIVE SOIL.

38
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,458
YET YOU FIGHT TO PROTECT HER.

39
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:16,375
DAUGHTER OF A DARK LORD
KILLED BY YOU LANDS AWAY.

40
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:17,666
AND WHY?

41
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,833
WE'RE THE BALANCE OF
EACH OTHER, REALLY.

42
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:22,166
OUR FULCRUM POINT, THE GIRL.

43
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,541
ASK YOURSELF, IS SHE REALLY
WORTH DEFENDING TO THE DEATH?

44
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,791
WORTH KILLING A
VERITABLE KINSMAN OVER?

45
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,000
- NONE OF THAT CRAP MATTERS.

46
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,083
AND DON'T EVEN TRY TO
TALK TO ME LIKE THE FACT

47
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:36,000
WE'RE BOTH FROM HERE MEANS A
DAMN THING, 'CAUSE IT DOESN'T.

48
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,250
GET THIS.

49
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:39,791
I NEVER IGNORE A
GIRL'S TEARS. EVER.

50
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,083
IT'S MY THING. MY AESTHETIC.

51
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,291
SO'S DECORATING THE GROUND

52
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,625
WITH THE INSIDES OF
BASTARDS LIKE YOU!

53
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,166
- IS THAT A FACT?

54
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,791
WELL, I'LL MAKE IT A POINT
OF BEATING YOU TO THE PUNCH.

55
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,208
THUS IS MY AESTHETIC.

56
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:53,791
- ( grunts )

57
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,541
ENOUGH OF THIS!

58
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,000
( grunts )

59
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,333
- YOU DISAPPOINT ME.

60
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,166
COME ON! STEP UP!

61
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,750
YOU CAN DO SO MUCH BETTER!

62
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:13,875
- YOU MEAN LIKE THIS?

63
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:20,416
( yells )

64
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,500
HA! WHAT'S WRONG, BLONDIE?

65
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,250
NOT AS EASY AS YOU
THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE?

66
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,375
- Phil: LINKED
ENERGY MANIPULATION.

67
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,708
I APPLAUD YOUR LEVEL OF MASTERY.

68
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:33,083
STILL, WITHOUT PROPER
MAGIC I FEEL YOUR CHANCES

69
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,125
IN THIS FIGHT ARE NEGLIGIBLE.

70
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:37,833
BLOCK THIS WITH YOUR CHI!

71
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:43,416
- ( yells )

72
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,458
I HAD GOOD REASON
FOR TURNING MY BACK

73
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:50,375
ON HOCUS POCUS TO STUDY
ENERGY MANIPULATION, DUDE.

74
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,583
SEE, IT'S HANDS DOWN
THE BEST WAY FOR MAKING

75
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,000
ANTI MAGIC BARRIERS
WITH WHATEVER'S AROUND.

76
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:59,583
IF I USE IT ON ME, I CAN MAKE
MY BODY A SHIELD AGAINST YOU.

77
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:00,875
COMES IN A HELLUVA LOT HANDIER

78
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,833
THAN RELYING ON SPELLS
TO DO THE HEAVY LIFTING.

79
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,041
FOR EXAMPLE, I CAN
DO STUFF LIKE THIS.

80
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,208
TELL ME WHATCHA THINK.

81
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:10,958
- YOU'RE A LIGHT MAGIC WIELDER?

82
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,291
- THIS AIN'T MAGIC.

83
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,541
IT'S AN ENERGY BOMB!

84
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,083
AND IT DOESN'T FEEL
GOOD, I PROMISE.

85
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,791
YOU MIGHT WANNA FIND SOME COVER!

86
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,375
AND HE'S TOAST.

87
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:28,583
- ( screams in pain )

88
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:34,791
- DUDE, YOU TOTALLY USED AN
ANTI MAGIC BARRIER, DIDN'T YOU?

89
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,250
DON'T YOU LISTEN?

90
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,083
I TOLD YOU IT WASN'T MAGIC.

91
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:39,416
I GOTTA HAND IT TO YOU, THOUGH.

92
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,458
YOU TOOK IT LIKE A CHAMP.

93
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,458
NO WAY! WHAT WAS THAT ENERGY?

94
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,458
- DEAR, OH, DEAR.

95
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:52,375
SEEMS I'VE UNDERESTIMATED YOU.

96
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:56,875
HEH, TO THINK YOU'D GO TO SUCH
LENGTHS FOR A DARK LORD'S ISSUE.

97
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,500
QUEEN LISTY WILL BE
HEARTBROKEN, I FEAR.

98
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:00,708
- S'CUSE ME?

99
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:03,166
- SHE'S NOT FAR
FROM IT EVEN NOW.

100
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,250
HEAVY IS THE HEAD
THAT WEARS THE CROWN.

101
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,791
- BULLSHIT.

102
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,333
WHAT THE HELL HAVE
YOU DONE TO HER?

103
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:11,166
- OH, TO HER MAJESTY?
NOTHING DIRECTLY.

104
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,583
JUST, AN IMPISH BIT OF
VANDALISM, ONE MIGHT SAY.

105
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:18,416
THE GRAVE OF LEON ESPERIO
IS NOW SO MUCH RUBBLE.

106
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,291
EVEN IN DEATH, THE MAN
WHOSE END YOU BROUGHT ABOUT

107
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,791
STYMIED MY CLAIM
TO THE TITLE HERO.

108
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:30,750
YOUR OWN GLORY IS TOO DISPUTED
TO THREATEN MY ASPIRATIONS

109
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,250
IN ANY REAL WAY.

110
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,000
GALLANT LEON, HOWEVER,

111
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:37,541
HE PERSISTED IN THWARTING
ME FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE.

112
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,791
HIS GLORY LIVED ON AFTER HIM.

113
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,500
HIS GRAVE WAS A
BLIGHT ON MY ATTEMPTS

114
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,416
TO WIN A SHARE OF IT FOR MYSELF.

115
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,875
AN ATROCITY!

116
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:47,125
- YOU DESTROYED
ANOTHER MAN'S GRAVE?

117
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:48,375
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

118
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,916
- NOW, NOW. ALL IS NOT LOST.

119
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,958
I'M SURE SHELLFEED HAS
PUZZLED ME OUT AS THE CULPRIT.

120
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,250
JUSTICE WILL BE
NO DOUBT BE SERVED.

121
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,541
OF COURSE, SHOULD I
SUCCEED IN DISPOSING OF YOU

122
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:01,166
AND DRAGGING YOUR LITTLE
WHORE BACK TO ALAYZARD,

123
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,041
MY REPUTATION
WILL FAR OUTSTRIP

124
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:05,583
ANY CHARACTER ASSASSINATION
THEY THROW AT ME.

125
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:08,625
IN THE END, A GOOD NAME IS ALL
THAT REALLY MATTERS, ISN'T IT?

126
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:11,166
- I DUNNO.

127
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,458
- ( Phil grunts )

128
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,208
- IS A GOOD NAME
WORTH DYING OVER?

129
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:26,833
- YOU ARE INCREDIBLY FAST.

130
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:28,333
ALAS.

131
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,041
AS YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE,

132
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:35,416
A GIFT FOR SPEED IS SOMETHING
I HAPPEN TO POSSESS, AS WELL.

133
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,708
NOW, THEN.

134
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,041
IF YOU WOULD BE SO KIND
AS TO DROP YOUR WEAPON.

135
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,375
DID YOU NOT HEAR ME?

136
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,333
DROP YOUR WEAPON.

137
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:48,708
THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.

138
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,833
I MUCH PREFER YOU DISARMED.

139
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:53,916
OH, AND, THE A.D. WILL
HAVE TO GO AS WELL.

140
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,333
DON'T WANT ANY MORE TOYS
APPEARING OUT OF THIN AIR,

141
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:57,041
DO WE?

142
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,333
- SOMEBODY'S INFORMED.

143
00:07:58,416 --> 00:07:59,708
- Phil: ANOTHER PIECE
OF INTELLIGENCE

144
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:02,583
I OWE TO YOUR
GENEROUS CLASSMATES.

145
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,958
FOR WHATEVER THE CONSOLATION
MAY BE TO YOU, YOUR DEATH,

146
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:15,458
LIKE HERS, WILL SIGNAL AN
END TO ALAYZARD'S STRIFE.

147
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:17,666
- Akatsuki: YOU MEAN ONCE ITS
ENEMIES ARE OUT OF THE WAY,

148
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,458
DISDIA WILL BE FREE TO DO WITH
ALAYZARD WHATEVER IT WANTS.

149
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,708
- PERHAPS. BUT HONESTLY
THE POLITICAL MACHINATIONS

150
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:25,291
INTEREST ME VERY LITTLE.

151
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:29,458
MY FIRST AND ONLY REAL CONCERN
IS ATTAINING MY RIGHTFUL TITLE.

152
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,041
- WHAT ABOUT YOUR "NATIVE SOIL?"

153
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,541
YOU JUST GONNA LIVE OUT THE
REST OF YOUR DAYS IN ALAYZARD?

154
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,208
- IS THAT SO WRONG?

155
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:36,958
YOU CAN'T BLAME ME, CAN YOU?

156
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:39,958
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS WORLD HOLDS
IN STORE FOR PEOPLE LIKE US.

157
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,166
LOOK AROUND YOU.

158
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,166
THE QUARANTINE,
THE COMPULSORY TRAINING,

159
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,166
THE MILITANT IDEALISM DRIVEN
BY THREADBARE CLICHES

160
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,625
OF THE WORST KIND.

161
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,750
AND THE ONLY THING THAT
BAFFLES ME MORE THAN THOSE

162
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,791
WHO ACCEPT A LIFE
OF SUBSERVIENCE

163
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,125
IS THE IGNORANCE OF THOSE

164
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:56,375
WHO THINK TO SWAY THEIR
WARDENS THROUGH TERRORISM.

165
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,625
BETTER TO LIVE IN
ANY WORLD BUT THIS.

166
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,875
- FOR THE RECORD,
I SEE YOUR POINT.

167
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,708
MATTER OF FACT, I AGREE.

168
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:07,708
NO DOUBT THIS WORLD
IS AN INSANE MESS.

169
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,208
STILL, I HAVE WHAT
YOU MIGHT CALL

170
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,458
UNFINISHED BUSINESS WITH IT.

171
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:14,250
I'M NOT READY TO TURN
MY BACK ON HER JUST YET.

172
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,833
- THAT IS A SHAME.

173
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,208
- Akatsuki: I TOTALLY GET WHY
YOU SEE PEOPLE LIKE ME AND LEON

174
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,708
AS OBSTACLES TO
YOUR LIFE'S AMBITION.

175
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,958
TROUBLE IS, I'M NOT
REALLY FEELING YA

176
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,000
ON WHY YOU'VE GOT TO KILL HER.

177
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,375
- OH, IT'S QUITE SIMPLE, REALLY.

178
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,291
YOU SEE, IF I'M
TRULY TO SURPASS YOU,

179
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,791
THERE'S A CRUCIAL
STEP I DAREN'T IGNORE.

180
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,916
SOMETHING EVERY HERO REQUIRES.

181
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,500
A NEW DARK LORD TO VANQUISH.

182
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,041
BEING OF THE PROPER BLOODLINE,

183
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,208
THIS LITTLE DARLING
FITS THE BILL.

184
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,750
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON.

185
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,541
NO MORE, NO LESS.

186
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,833
- ( laughing )

187
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,833
- WHAT DO YOU FIND SO AMUSING?

188
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:50,125
- I'M LAUGHING 'CAUSE I EXPECTED
TO BE THROWN FOR A LOOP.

189
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,583
DUDE, PLEASE!

190
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,625
AFTER ALL THE BIG TALK,
THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOU TICK?

191
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,458
WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT.

192
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,250
I FIGURED YOU'D BE IN THIS
FOR A BETTER REASON

193
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,916
THAN PETTY JEALOUSY.

194
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,083
I SAW IT COMING FROM A MILE
AWAY, YOU'RE ALL THE SAME.

195
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,750
TRUTH IS YOU'RE JUST A PEON
WHO THINKS PUSHING PEOPLE AROUND

196
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,958
WILL GIVE HIM THE RIGHT
TO CALL HIMSELF A HERO.

197
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,000
-( grunts )

198
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:11,916
( gasps )

199
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,583
IMPOSSIBLE!

200
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,250
- TOO BAD SO SAD, CHIEF.

201
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,875
I KNOW YOU DON'T
WANNA ACCEPT IT,

202
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,916
BUT ENERGY MANIPULATION
TRUMPS MAGIC AT EVERY TURN.

203
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,291
IT'S CALLED BEING AT
HOME IN YOUR OWN SKIN,

204
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:25,291
NOT SOMETHING LEARNING AN
INCANTATION BY HEART CAN TEACH.

205
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,333
( grunts )

206
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:33,833
( yells )

207
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,916
DUDE, TALK ABOUT NOT
KNOWING YOUR LIMITS.

208
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:55,125
YO. COAST IS PRETTY MUCH CLEAR.

209
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,500
MIU! WHY THE HELL
ARE YOU RUNNING?

210
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:58,833
THE BAD GUY'S GONE NOW!

211
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,541
DOOFUS.

212
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,583
YOU'RE NOT S'POSED
TO RUN AWAY FROM ME.

213
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,833
DO YOU MIND TELLING ME
WHAT THE BIG DEAL IS?

214
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:17,916
- Miu: I'M SORRY.
- HA?

215
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,000
- I DON'T BELONG
HERE ANYMORE.

216
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,333
I DON'T BELONG ANYWHERE.

217
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,666
- EXCUSE ME?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

218
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:30,041
- LISTEN, THIS WHOLE THING
IS BETWEEN ME AND ALAYZARD.

219
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,625
I'M SORRY.

220
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:34,208
BUT AS LONG AS I'M ALIVE, THE
PEOPLE I LOVE ARE IN DANGER.

221
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,666
I'M THE DAUGHTER
OF A DARK LORD.

222
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,208
THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT.

223
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:42,125
IF I STAY HERE, PEOPLE LIKE HIM
WILL JUST KEEP COMING FOR ME.

224
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,500
IF I GO BACK HOME, THE
SIMPLE FACT OF MY EXISTENCE

225
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,958
WILL GUARANTEE THAT EVERYONE
GOES ON KILLING EACH OTHER.

226
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,666
THERE'S NO OTHER
WAY OUT OF THIS MESS.

227
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,166
- HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

228
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,583
- I HAVE NOWHERE TO GO.

229
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:54,750
PLEASE UNDERSTAND.

230
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:56,625
FORGIVE ME.

231
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:02,333
WHEN HE AWAKENS, TELL THE
MERCENARY WHAT'S BECOME OF ME.

232
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:03,708
THAT WILL BE AN END TO IT.

233
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:11,833
LET IT BE DONE.

234
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,166
NO! WHY?

235
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,416
- ( Akatsuki grunts )

236
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,208
- WHY DID YOU SAVE ME?

237
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:36,958
- WHY ARE YOU SUCH AN IDIOT?

238
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,958
YOU'RE GONNA LET SOME
SMARMY BASTARD'S GIBBERISH

239
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,375
GET TO YOU LIKE THAT?

240
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:43,083
- HE'S RIGHT! WHAT WOULD
YOU HAVE DONE IN MY POSITION?

241
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,833
YOU WANT ME TO KEEP DRAGGING
OUR FRIENDS INTO THIS?

242
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:48,541
YOU WANT THE PEOPLE OF THIS
WORLD TO SUFFER BECAUSE OF ME?

243
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,875
ANIMALS LIKE HIM ARE NEVER
GOING TO GIVE UP THE HUNT.

244
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:55,500
THEY WON'T REST UNTIL I'M
HAULED BACK TO ALAYZARD!

245
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:56,750
DON'T YOU GET IT?

246
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,041
I HAVE TO DIE!

247
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:01,125
BY LIVING, I BRING RUIN
TO MY WORLD AND YOURS!

248
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:03,500
I DON'T WANNA BE THE
REASON PEOPLE PERISH!

249
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,875
SACRIFICING MYSELF IS THE
ONLY DECENT THING TO DO!

250
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,291
- ARE YOU DONE?

251
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,875
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
DEATH IS THE EASY WAY OUT.

252
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:13,500
IT'S NOT A SOLUTION, IT'S YOU
BEING A SPOILED LITTLE PRINCESS!

253
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:16,500
HELLUVA LOT SIMPLER TO JUST WALK
OFF A CLIFF THAN TURN AROUND

254
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:19,291
AND FIGHT LIKE THE PEOPLE
YOU LOVE DESERVE, RIGHT?

255
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,833
YOU THINK DEAR OLD DAD JUST
THREW HIMSELF ON MY SWORD?

256
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,291
YOU THINK THE MAN
JUST HANDED YOU OFF

257
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,833
WITHOUT MAKING ME PROVE MYSELF?

258
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,291
OR THAT HE DIDN'T CARE
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

259
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,541
TO HIS ONLY DAUGHTER?

260
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,166
ANSWER ME!

261
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,041
OR BETTER YET, KEEP THAT TRAP
SHUT AND THINK ABOUT THE FACT

262
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,916
THAT HE LET HIMSELF BE KILLED
TO GIVE YOU A BETTER LIFE!

263
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,583
EITHER WAY, HE SURE AS HELL

264
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:44,208
DIDN'T THINK THAT YOU
DYING WAS THE BEST OPTION.

265
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,125
YOU HEAR ME?

266
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,166
IF YOU EVEN THINK
ABOUT KILLING YOURSELF,

267
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,500
YOU'RE INSULTING HIS MEMORY,

268
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:52,083
AND I'LL NEVER LET
YOU SINK THAT LOW.

269
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,416
DON'T YOU GET IT?

270
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,666
YOU'RE HIS VALIDATION!

271
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,208
HIS SURVIVAL!

272
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:59,750
THE LEGACY OF AN INDOMITABLE
SOUL WRITTEN IN FLESH AND BLOOD!

273
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,833
- YOU COULD'VE DIED
TRYING TO RESCUE ME.

274
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:06,333
IF YOUR CHI HAD BEEN EVEN
THE TINIEST BIT WEAKER,

275
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:07,666
THAT MONSTER WOULD'VE HAD YOU

276
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,333
AND THERE WAS NOTHING
I COULD'VE DONE ABOUT IT.

277
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:10,875
- I DON'T DIE.

278
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,958
I MEAN, COME ON, IT'S
ME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

279
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:14,583
HE DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE.

280
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,458
- I COULD'VE BEAT HIM
WITH MY EYES CLOSED.

281
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:17,708
- YEAH?

282
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:19,291
AND WHAT ABOUT THE NEXT
GUY WHO COMES AFTER ME?

283
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:22,208
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN HE TURNS
OUT TO BE STRONGER THAN YOU?

284
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,125
NO. I WON'T LET YOU!

285
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:27,083
DYING ISN'T THE EASY WAY
OUT, IT'S THE ONLY WAY OUT!

286
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,083
- YOU KNOW THAT ISN'T TRUE.

287
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,000
THAT'S THE MONSTER TALKING.

288
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,083
BESIDES, THINK ABOUT IT.

289
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,791
WHO SAYS YOU HAVE
TO HAVE A WAY OUT?

290
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,958
STICK AROUND AND FIGHT
FOR THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE.

291
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,250
- I CAN'T.

292
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,083
- I GET IT, OKAY? REALLY.

293
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,625
FINE, I'LL DO THE
FIGHTING FOR BOTH OF US.

294
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,875
IF I'VE TOLD YOU ONCE I'VE
TOLD YOU A THOUSAND TIMES,

295
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,458
THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE FOR.

296
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:47,916
IF THIS MESS IS ANYONE'S FAULT,

297
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,041
IT'S MINE FOR BRINGING
YOU HERE AT ALL.

298
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,583
IF I'D HAVE KNOWN THIS WOULD
COME TO YOU JUMPING OFF A CLIFF.

299
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,291
I'D HAVE TOLD YOUR
FATHER TO SUCK IT

300
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:57,083
AND LEFT YOUR ASS IN ALAYZARD.

301
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,333
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY, I GUESS,

302
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,000
IS THAT NONE OF THIS
IS YOUR FAULT.

303
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,750
IT'S NOT THAT BLACK
AND WHITE, OKAY?

304
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,791
I KILLED HIM, AND
I BROUGHT YOU HERE,

305
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,375
SO IT'S MY PLACE
TO FIGHT FOR YOU

306
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:08,458
WHICH IS WHAT YOUR FATHER
WANTED IN THE FIRST PLACE.

307
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,166
THIS IS THE PATH
I CHOSE FOR MYSELF

308
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,666
AND I'M NOT GONNA LET
ANYONE KNOCK ME OFF IT.

309
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,083
NOT EVEN YOU, SWEETHEART, SO
YOU MIGHT AS WELL GIVE IT UP.

310
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,166
YOU CHOSE THIS, TOO.

311
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,000
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO REACHED
UP AND TOOK MY HAND.

312
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,208
HAVE A LITTLE FAITH IN ME.

313
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:26,208
HAVE FAITH IN YOUR DAD'S
VISION, HELL, IN YOURSELF.

314
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,000
YOU'RE NOT ALONE HERE.

315
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,833
SO GET THAT THROUGH
YOUR THICK SKULL.

316
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,750
WE'RE IN THIS THING
TOGETHER, YOU AND I.

317
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,541
- GET AWAY FROM ME!

318
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,208
STOP BEING SO NICE!

319
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:41,541
NOTHING ABOUT YOUR
ATTITUDE MAKES SENSE!

320
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:44,250
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST FORGET ABOUT
ME AND GET ON WITH YOUR LIFE?

321
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,000
IT'D BE SO MUCH EASIER!

322
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,708
JUST STOP ACTING LIKE MY
GUARDIAN AND LEAVE ME ALONE!

323
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:52,500
- NOT USED TO BEING TREATED
WITH LOVING KINDNESS, HUH?

324
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:55,291
YOU SAID EARLIER THAT
YOU DON'T BELONG ANYWHERE.

325
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,333
PERSONALLY, I KNOW
THAT'S A BUNCH OF CRAP,

326
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:58,666
BUT, BEAR WITH ME A SEC

327
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,708
AND WE'LL BREAK IT DOWN
FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT.

328
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,250
IF YOU ASK ME,

329
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:06,500
THE WHOLE IDEA THAT YOU NEED
TO BELONG ANYWHERE IS BUNK.

330
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:10,083
SEE, YOU'RE THINKING IN TERMS
OF A PLACE, A PHYSICAL PLACE,

331
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:13,333
LIKE ALAYZARD OR HERE,
AND THAT'S MISLEADING.

332
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:16,000
IT'S NOT ABOUT "WHERE".
IT'S ABOUT WITH "WHO".

333
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,208
IN YOUR CASE THE
"WHO" HAPPENS TO BE ME.

334
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,333
- ( gasps )

335
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,083
- LISTEN, IF YOU EVER
NEED A REMINDER,

336
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:25,333
JUST LOOK INTO MY EYES AND
YOU'LL KNOW WHERE HOME IS.

337
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:26,916
AND HEY,

338
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,916
IF THE NICE GUY PART CONFUSES
YOU, I CAN ALWAYS BE A JERK.

339
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,958
EASY-PEASY.

340
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:33,625
- WHA... WHAT ARE YOU DO...

341
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,541
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

342
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:36,916
TRYING TO REINFORCE
TODAY'S LESSON

343
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,083
WITH A LITTLE SENSORY
AUGMENTATION.

344
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,166
- WELL, CUT IT OUT ALREADY!

345
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,125
- HA! THE MOUTH ON YOU.

346
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,625
LET'S GIVE IT
SOMETHING BETTER TO DO.

347
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,125
BRACE YOURSELF, SWEET CHEEKS.

348
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:55,375
- MAYBE HE'S RIGHT.

349
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,541
MAYBE THIS IS HOME.

350
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,291
- Akatsuki: COME ON.
HOW YOU DOING, YOU OKAY?

351
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:07,916
- UM, YEAH.

352
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:11,041
LISTEN, ARE YOU...

353
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,333
ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY
SURE ABOUT THIS?

354
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:14,750
- HUH? ABOUT WHAT?

355
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,625
- COME ON. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

356
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:18,875
ALL THE DRAMA,

357
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,458
THE TROUBLE THAT'S BOUND
TO FOLLOW US FROM NOW

358
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:21,833
UNTIL THE DAY WE DIE.

359
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,166
- YOU THINK
I CAN'T DEAL WITH IT?

360
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,583
MIU, TRUST ME,
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED

361
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,125
YOUR OLD MAN'S
LEGACY WASN'T A CURSE.

362
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,166
IT WAS LUCK.

363
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,750
WELL, WE PROBABLY OUGHTA BE
HEADING BACK RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

364
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,416
IZUMI AND THE OTHERS
WILL BE WORRIED,

365
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,333
AND I'VE GOT ME A MERCENARY
TO INTERROGATE, SO...

366
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,041
( grunts )

367
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,541
- WHAT IS IT? WHAT'S WRONG?

368
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:50,125
( gasps )

369
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,000
HE POISONED YOU!

370
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:56,041
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I JUST NEED TO LAY DOWN.

371
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:58,958
NOTHING MY BODY HASN'T
DEALT WITH BEFORE.

372
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:01,375
- DON'T BE A MORON!
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS!

373
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:04,166
COME ON, DON'T DO THIS.
STAY WITH ME.

374
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,833
OH, NO! HIS BODY
TEMPERATURE IS DROPPING!

375
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:10,500
OKAY, YOU JERK!
IT'S MY TURN TO HELP YOU.

376
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,708
HIS CLOTHES ARE DRENCHED.

377
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,541
HE'LL FREEZE IF
HE STAYS LIKE THIS.

378
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:42,666
IT'S OKAY. I'M JUST
GONNA WARM YOU UP.

379
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:53,583
WHA... WHAT AM I DOING?

380
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:54,625
THIS ISN'T ME.

381
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:58,583
AH!

382
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:05,375
OKAY, NOW THIS IS GETTING
A LITTLE OUT OF HAND.

383
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:07,416
( screams )

384
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,791
DEFINITELY NOT WHAT
I MEANT TO HAPPEN!

385
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,958
OH, MY GOD! WHAT IS THAT?

386
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,541
WAIT, HOLD ON.

387
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,500
THIS ISN'T... WE CAN'T.

388
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:20,958
( screams )

389
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:22,416
- EASY.

390
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,541
- WAIT, YOU'RE AWAKE?

391
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,083
- THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE, HUH?

392
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,375
WHEW, GOOD JOB
GETTING THE POISON OUT.

393
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,000
GLAD YOU'RE ON TOP OF THINGS.

394
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:41,166
- ( gasps )

395
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:45,916
( grunts )

396
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,500
YOU PROUD OF YOURSELF?

397
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,083
YOU PROUD OF WHAT YOU JUST PUT
ME THROUGH, YOU SON OF A BITCH?

398
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,458
YOU'RE SUCH A PERVERT.

399
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,500
HOW MUCH OF THAT WERE
YOU CONSCIOUS FOR?

400
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:56,916
- EVERY SECOND OF IT.

401
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,375
I HAD TO KEEP THE
POISON FROM SPREADING

402
00:19:58,458 --> 00:19:59,958
TO THE REST OF MY BODY, RIGHT?

403
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,916
YOUd KINDA NEED TO BE AWAKE AND
FOCUSED TO MANIPULATE YOUR CHI.

404
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,125
HEY, DON'T GET ALL TICKED.

405
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,666
I TOLD YOU I COULD HANDLE IT.

406
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,708
I'VE BEEN POISONED
HUNDREDS OF TIMES.

407
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,833
NOT THAT I DON'T APPRECIATE
YOU TRYING TO HELP.

408
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,833
- YOU'RE A TERRIBLE PERSON.

409
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,166
MAYBE YOU CAN TAKE IT EASY

410
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,083
WHILE SOMEONE'S GOING
THROUGH WHATEVER THAT WAS.

411
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,125
BUT I'M NOT AS
CALLOUS AS YOU ARE!

412
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,791
UGH! YOU'RE HEARTLESS!

413
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,166
EXPLOITING MY SYMPATHY
TO COMPROMISE MY VIRTUE

414
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,875
BEFORE I KNEW
WHAT WAS HAPPENING!

415
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,083
- LOOK, I'M SORRY.

416
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,083
HMM.

417
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,541
I'M NOT MADE OF STONE, YOU KNOW?

418
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,416
THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH
"CUTE" I CAN TAKE.

419
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,458
FORGIVE ME.

420
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,375
- WHY AM I FALLING FOR THIS?

421
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:36,791
- NOW, THEN.

422
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,125
LET'S GET GOING, HUH?

423
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:43,416
- UH-UH. YOUR BODY
ISN'T READY FOR A HIKE!

424
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,833
- GOTTA STAY ON THE MOVE.

425
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,416
POISON'LL GET IT'S HOOKS
INTO ME AGAIN IF I DON'T.

426
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,916
HEY, I'M GONNA BE FINE.

427
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,750
THE TRICK NOW IS TO STAY ON
THE OLD FEET, WALK IT OFF.

428
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:52,875
- I DON'T BUY IT!

429
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,125
YOU NEED TO SIT DOWN AND REST

430
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,291
BEFORE YOU EVEN THINK
ABOUT GOING ANYWHERE!

431
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:57,708
- REALLY WISH I COULD.

432
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,666
TIME'S JUST NOT ON
OUR SIDE RIGHT NOW.

433
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,208
- ( gasps )

434
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,250
- Phil: I REALLY LET
MY GUARD DOWN.

435
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,458
IN MY DEFENSE, IT'S NOT
EVERY DAY YOU MEET SOMEONE

436
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:09,666
WHO CAN WIELD SUCH
POWER BARE HANDED.

437
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,208
OR WHO CAN SURVIVE A VENOM

438
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,583
DESIGNED TO FELL
A MAN INSTANTLY.

439
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,958
YOU'RE ALMOST
INHUMAN, AREN'T YOU?

440
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,375
- FUNNY, I WAS GONNA
SAY THE SAME TO YOU.

441
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,625
I WASN'T AT FULL POWER
BACK THERE, BUT STILL.

442
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:23,000
YOUR ENERGY FLOW SHOULD BE
ALL OVER THE MAP RIGHT NOW,

443
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,666
I'M AMAZED YOU CAN STAND.

444
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,583
I'M KIND OF AMAZED
YOU'RE EVEN CONSCIOUS.

445
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:29,375
IMPRESSIVE STUFF, MAN. RESPECT.

446
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:32,875
- YES, WELL, IF YOU'RE
IMPRESSED, NOW, JUST YOU WAIT.

447
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:36,250
I WAS HOPING NOT TO
RESORT TO THIS, BUT,

448
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,208
IT WOULD APPEAR YOU'VE
LEFT ME PRECIOUS LITTLE

449
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:41,208
IN THE WAY OF OPTIONS.

450
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:42,250
- ( Miu screams )

451
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,916
- ( Phil screams )

452
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:48,166
- ( theme song playing )

453
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,541
- ( singing in Japanese )

454
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:19,791
- Listy: I KNOW NOT WHY,

455
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:21,458
BUT DESPITE MY
STEADFAST CONVICTION

456
00:23:21,541 --> 00:23:24,583
THAT AKATSUKI WILL PREVAIL,
MY HEART IS ILL AT EASE.

457
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:25,958
PHIL BURNETT IS
NOT THE SORT OF MAN

458
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:28,541
TO ENGAGE WITHOUT A
TRUMP CARD READY IN HAND,

459
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:31,708
AND ONE SHUDDERS TO IMAGINE WHAT
THAT WILL BE IN THIS INSTANCE.

460
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:33,333
IF THE WEDDING OF
BLOODLUST AND CUNNING

461
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:36,250
HE DISPLAYED AT THE OTHERWORLD
GATE IS ANY INDICATION,

462
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:39,250
HE MAY WELL TRANSCEND
HUMAN LIMITS ERE LONG.

463
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:40,916
IN WHAT STATE WOULD
SUCH A TRANSFORMATION

464
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,791
LEAVE A MAN LIKE HIM?

465
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:45,458
NEXT EPISODE. "BEFORE DAYBREAK."
