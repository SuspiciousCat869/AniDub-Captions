1
01:00:19,333 --> 01:00:22,125
GUYS, I CAN'T TAKE
THIS ANYMORE, I THINK...

2
01:00:22,208 --> 01:00:23,291
- Kuzuha: I KNOW.

3
01:00:23,375 --> 01:00:25,041
HE SHOULDN'T BE OUT THERE ALONE.

4
01:00:25,125 --> 01:00:27,750
JUST TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE,
I VOTE ALL THREE OF US GO.

5
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:28,916
- BEST HURRY.

6
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,916
- YOU KNEW WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY?

7
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,375
- Kuzuha: COME ON, GIVE US A
LITTLE CREDIT, WILL YOU, MIU?

8
01:00:33,458 --> 01:00:35,208
WE KNOW WHAT THAT LOOK
ON YOUR FACE MEANS.

9
01:00:35,291 --> 01:00:36,541
- Chikage: AND DON'T
THINK WE'RE DONE

10
01:00:36,625 --> 01:00:38,375
TALKING ABOUT HOW YOU
WANTED TO GO ALONE,

11
01:00:38,458 --> 01:00:40,375
WE'RE ALONG FOR THE RIDE
WHETHER YOU'RE LIKE IT OR NOT,

12
01:00:40,458 --> 01:00:41,875
SO YOU MIGHT AS
WELL GET USED TO IT.

13
01:00:41,958 --> 01:00:44,458
- IT'S NOT FAIR FOR ME
TO DRAG YOU INTO THIS.

14
01:00:44,541 --> 01:00:46,750
NOT IN THE MIDDLE
OF RANKING EXAMS!

15
01:00:46,833 --> 01:00:48,333
- Kuzuha: HEY, IF YOU'RE
WILLING TO RISK EVERYTHING

16
01:00:48,416 --> 01:00:49,500
TO HELP YOUR BROTHER,

17
01:00:49,583 --> 01:00:51,708
WE CAN TAKE THE SAME
RISK TO HELP YOU.

18
01:00:51,791 --> 01:00:53,041
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

19
01:00:53,125 --> 01:00:54,583
- BECAUSE WE'RE A TEAM?

20
01:00:54,666 --> 01:00:56,000
- NO, SILLY.

21
01:00:56,083 --> 01:00:57,541
THIS IS WHAT YOU
CALL FRIENDSHIP.

22
01:01:00,208 --> 01:01:01,541
- BUT, FOR THE RECORD,

23
01:01:01,625 --> 01:01:03,250
HE'D BETTER APPRECIATE THIS.

24
01:01:03,333 --> 01:01:05,041
YOUR BROTHER'S GONNA
HAVE MAJOR BRAGGING RIGHTS

25
01:01:05,125 --> 01:01:06,625
FOR THE NUMBER OF
GIRLS ON HIS TRAIL.

26
01:01:06,708 --> 01:01:08,833
- Chikage: HEY, COME ON,
IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE GROUPIES.

27
01:01:08,916 --> 01:01:11,250
WE'RE CHASING HIM TO
SAVE HIM FROM HIMSELF.

28
01:01:11,333 --> 01:01:14,583
STILL, I HAVE TO ADMIT I GET
WHY ALL THE GIRLS DIG 'IM.

29
01:01:14,666 --> 01:01:15,791
- WAIT. WHAT?

30
01:01:15,875 --> 01:01:17,208
- Kuzuha: DON'T TELL
ME YOU DON'T SEE IT.

31
01:01:17,291 --> 01:01:18,541
COME ON, HE'S ON THE FAST TRACK

32
01:01:18,625 --> 01:01:20,333
TO BECOMING A
LEGEND AROUND HERE.

33
01:01:20,416 --> 01:01:22,208
HE FACED OFF WITH
THE STUDENT COUNCIL.

34
01:01:22,291 --> 01:01:24,125
HE HANDLED THE
BERSERKER COCKATRICE.

35
01:01:24,208 --> 01:01:26,583
THAT KIND OF STUFF TENDS
TO IMPRESS SOME PEOPLE.

36
01:01:26,666 --> 01:01:29,208
GIRLS WANT HIM,
GUYS WANNA BE HIM.

37
01:01:29,291 --> 01:01:31,625
- YEAH. I GUESS I DO SEE IT.

38
01:01:31,708 --> 01:01:34,583
- Chikage: NO QUESTION HE'S
A PERVIE BASTARD, SURE,

39
01:01:34,666 --> 01:01:36,708
BUT YOU'D HAVE TO BE
MADE OF STONE TO HATE HIM.

40
01:01:36,791 --> 01:01:38,583
THERE'S JUST SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT DUDE.

41
01:01:38,666 --> 01:01:40,625
MATTER OF FACT, DON'T
TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY,

42
01:01:40,708 --> 01:01:43,750
BUT I'M THINKING YOU DIG ON HIM
MORE THAN YOU LIKE TO LET ON.

43
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:46,250
- WHAT? WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

44
01:01:46,333 --> 01:01:47,291
LIKE?

45
01:01:48,208 --> 01:01:50,125
EW! GROSS! HE'S MY BROTHER!

46
01:01:50,208 --> 01:01:51,916
I DON'T EVEN BEGIN TO
LOOK AT HIM THAT WAY!

47
01:01:53,541 --> 01:01:54,833
- Kuzuha: NOW WHAT?

48
01:01:54,916 --> 01:01:55,875
- Chikage: UH-OH.

49
01:01:57,208 --> 01:01:58,666
- AH, EXCELLENT.

50
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:00,333
THIS WILL BE QUICK WORK.

51
01:02:00,416 --> 01:02:01,375
- WHO ARE YOU?

52
01:02:02,625 --> 01:02:04,416
A DISDIAN PALADIN!

53
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:06,541
- BY THE ALMIGHTY
POWER VESTED IN ME

54
01:02:06,625 --> 01:02:09,583
BY THE TRIPARTITE
ALLIANCE OF ALAYZARD,

55
01:02:09,666 --> 01:02:11,125
I, PHIL BURNETT,
HAVE COME TO BRING

56
01:02:11,208 --> 01:02:14,041
THE DAUGHTER OF DARK LORD
GARIUS BACK TO HER HOMELAND,

57
01:02:14,875 --> 01:02:17,500
SO, SHALL WE, LADY MIU?

58
01:02:17,583 --> 01:02:18,958
- ( theme song playing )

59
01:02:19,041 --> 01:02:20,166
- ( singing in Japanese )

60
01:03:54,291 --> 01:03:56,125
- Male Operator: NO,
NO, NO! THIS IS NUTS!

61
01:03:56,208 --> 01:03:57,291
I CAN'T ACCESS ANYTHING!

62
01:03:58,291 --> 01:03:59,375
COME ON!

63
01:03:59,458 --> 01:04:00,541
- SIR!

64
01:04:00,625 --> 01:04:01,583
- PROFESSOR KUBOTA!

65
01:04:03,125 --> 01:04:04,333
- WHERE DO WE STAND, GUYS?

66
01:04:04,416 --> 01:04:05,791
- THE BARRIER GRID
WENT OFFLINE

67
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:07,708
APPROXIMATELY THIRTY
MINUTES AGO, SIR,

68
01:04:07,791 --> 01:04:09,791
WE DON'T KNOW WHY YET,
BUT THE MAIN OS CRASHED

69
01:04:09,875 --> 01:04:12,125
AND WE'VE HAD A HELL
OF A TIME RECOVERING IT.

70
01:04:12,208 --> 01:04:13,916
- AND THE ANCILLARY NETWORKS?

71
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,166
- UH, STILL RUNNING.

72
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:16,416
- RIGHT.

73
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:19,333
LET'S SET UP PARALLEL
EXECUTION BYPASSES.

74
01:04:19,416 --> 01:04:21,958
WE'LL USE THEM TO SUPPORT
THE NETWORKS THAT'RE UP.

75
01:04:22,041 --> 01:04:23,875
FOR THE TIME BEING I
WANT EVERYONE FOCUSED

76
01:04:23,958 --> 01:04:26,125
ON RUNNING THE BACKUPS SMOOTHLY.

77
01:04:26,208 --> 01:04:27,333
THERE'S A BATTLE OUT THERE,

78
01:04:27,416 --> 01:04:29,583
AND WE NEED TO MAKE
SURE IT GOES OUR WAY,

79
01:04:29,666 --> 01:04:31,458
LET'S GIVE IT
EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT!

80
01:04:31,541 --> 01:04:32,500
- Staff: YES, SIR!

81
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,750
- Haruka: UNBELIEVABLE.

82
01:04:37,833 --> 01:04:39,708
- Ryohei: MINAMI,
TALK TO BASE CAMP.

83
01:04:39,791 --> 01:04:41,166
HAVE THEM PINPOINT
MIU'S COORDINATES

84
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:42,625
USING HER A.D. SIGNALS.

85
01:04:42,708 --> 01:04:44,583
THE GIRLS THAT
ARE WITH HER, TOO.

86
01:04:44,666 --> 01:04:46,125
- Minami: BASE CAMP. COME IN.

87
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:48,541
- Haruka: THIS IS APPALLING.

88
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:54,958
- ( grunts )

89
01:04:56,541 --> 01:04:57,500
HERE THEY ARE.

90
01:04:59,333 --> 01:05:01,208
CHIKAGE! KUZUHA!

91
01:05:01,291 --> 01:05:03,791
- OH MY GOODNESS.
WHO COULD'VE DONE THIS TO THEM?

92
01:05:03,875 --> 01:05:05,208
ARE YOU OKAY?

93
01:05:05,291 --> 01:05:08,166
- Kuzuha: I... I DON'T
REMEMBER EVERYTHING,

94
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:10,791
BUT, I KNOW IZUMI
TOOK THE BRUNT FOR US.

95
01:05:12,125 --> 01:05:13,458
I'M SORRY.

96
01:05:13,541 --> 01:05:17,375
WE... WE TRIED, BUT HE...

97
01:05:17,458 --> 01:05:19,583
- I WANT A NAME AND I
WANT IT THIS INSTANT!

98
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:21,791
- WHO DID THIS TO YOU?

99
01:05:21,875 --> 01:05:24,833
- I DON'T KNOW,
BUT, HE WAS STRONG.

100
01:05:24,916 --> 01:05:29,625
AND I THINK MAYBE HE WAS
LOOKING FOR YOUR SISTER.

101
01:05:29,708 --> 01:05:32,416
SHE RAN OFF TO LURE
HIM AWAY FROM US.

102
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,000
HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
FROM THE WORLD

103
01:05:34,083 --> 01:05:36,333
THE TWO OF YOU REUNITED IN.

104
01:05:36,416 --> 01:05:38,250
SHE CALLED HIM SOMETHING, TOO.

105
01:05:38,333 --> 01:05:39,541
I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT MEANT.

106
01:05:39,625 --> 01:05:41,000
BUT SHE WAS PRETTY UPSET.

107
01:05:41,083 --> 01:05:42,500
WHAT WERE THE WORDS?

108
01:05:42,583 --> 01:05:44,166
DISDIAN PALADIN, I THINK?

109
01:05:49,708 --> 01:05:52,125
- ( panting )

110
01:05:56,333 --> 01:05:58,333
- YOU'RE ONLY PROLONGING
THE INEVITABLE.

111
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:04,375
OH, PLEASE.
WHY BOTHER TO STRUGGLE?

112
01:06:10,375 --> 01:06:12,666
- I'VE GOT TO GET SOME
DISTANCE BETWEEN US!

113
01:06:12,750 --> 01:06:14,250
I'M SORRY, MY FRIENDS.

114
01:06:14,333 --> 01:06:15,458
PLEASE BE OKAY!

115
01:06:20,083 --> 01:06:21,000
- Onizuka: HA!

116
01:06:25,125 --> 01:06:26,416
- WHAT'S THAT YOU'RE
DOING TO THEM?

117
01:06:27,166 --> 01:06:28,416
- Akatsuki: FIRST AID,

118
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:30,541
LONG STORY SHORT,
I STABILIZED THEIR CHI.

119
01:06:32,166 --> 01:06:33,333
( sighs )

120
01:06:33,416 --> 01:06:34,500
HARUKA!

121
01:06:34,583 --> 01:06:36,291
- Haruka: YES, SIR?

122
01:06:36,375 --> 01:06:38,666
WAIT, WHERE DO YOU GET OFF
YELLING AT ME LIKE THAT?

123
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:40,500
I ADVISE YOU TO
REMEMBER YOUR PLACE!

124
01:06:40,583 --> 01:06:42,625
- GET THESE GIRLS TO THE ICU,

125
01:06:42,708 --> 01:06:44,916
YOU'RE OUR FASTEST
OPTION AT THIS POINT.

126
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,416
- SO, YOU BARK ORDERS AT ME
AND THEN CALL ME AN OPTION?

127
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:51,750
FINE, BUT I ONLY SUBMIT
BECAUSE I AGREE WITH YOU.

128
01:06:51,833 --> 01:06:53,458
- THE KEYBOARD JOCKEYS
BACK AT BASE CAMP

129
01:06:53,541 --> 01:06:54,666
WERE KEEPING TABS
ON THE MATCH

130
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:56,500
THROUGH OUR A.D. SIGNALS, RIGHT?

131
01:06:56,583 --> 01:06:58,791
HAVE 'EM PULL THE DATA FROM
JUST BEFORE THINGS WENT DOWN

132
01:06:58,875 --> 01:07:01,458
AND LOCATE THE OTHER STUDENTS
WHO WERE ON THE BATTLEFIELD.

133
01:07:01,541 --> 01:07:04,333
WE NEED TO GET
EVERYBODY CORRALLED ASAP.

134
01:07:04,416 --> 01:07:07,291
AIHARA, YOU'RE PRETTY HANDY
WITH EARTH MAGIC, AREN'T YOU?

135
01:07:07,375 --> 01:07:09,500
I'M ASSUMING YOU CAN MAKE
GOLEMS THAT FOLLOW ORDERS?

136
01:07:09,958 --> 01:07:11,416
- YES.

137
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,500
- HOW MANY CAN YOU CONJURE WITH
WHAT YOU FIND IN THE FOREST?

138
01:07:13,583 --> 01:07:16,458
- I'D SAY 300 IS A FAIRLY
DECENT PROJECTION.

139
01:07:16,541 --> 01:07:18,333
- GOOD, GOOD.
SHOULD BE MORE THAN ENOUGH.

140
01:07:18,416 --> 01:07:21,416
COOK 'EM UP AND ORDER THEM TO
SHEPHERD EVERYONE TO BASE CAMP.

141
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:22,458
THE SOONER, THE BETTER.

142
01:07:23,958 --> 01:07:25,916
UESAKI, I NEED YOU ON THIS, TOO.

143
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,166
GO WITH HER AND INVOKE A FLARE

144
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:29,250
WHENEVER YOU GUYS FIND
SOMEBODY WHO'S INJURED.

145
01:07:29,333 --> 01:07:31,583
MAKE SURE YOU GET IT HIGH
ENOUGH FOR HARUKA TO SEE.

146
01:07:31,666 --> 01:07:33,541
- Ryohei: HOLD UP, WAIT A SEC.

147
01:07:33,625 --> 01:07:36,041
YOU'RE GONNA GO FIND
THIS GUY BY YOURSELF?

148
01:07:36,125 --> 01:07:38,583
- Akatsuki: YOU HAVE A JOB
TO DO, I HAVE A JOB TO DO.

149
01:07:38,666 --> 01:07:40,291
LET'S JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT.

150
01:07:40,375 --> 01:07:42,708
- I APPRECIATE YOUR
ENTHUSIASM, OUSAWA,

151
01:07:42,791 --> 01:07:45,208
BUT I CAN'T ALLOW YOU TO
WANDER OFF ON YOUR OWN.

152
01:07:45,291 --> 01:07:47,250
YOU'RE TIRED OF ME PULLING
RANK, I'M WELL AWARE,

153
01:07:47,333 --> 01:07:50,625
BUT NONETHELESS, AS VICE
PRESIDENT I MUST INSIST.

154
01:07:50,708 --> 01:07:54,208
- WOW, CALL ME CRAZY, BUT
THAT SOUNDS LIKE CONCERN.

155
01:07:54,291 --> 01:07:56,916
- YES, AND I WILL THANK YOU
NOT TO READ TOO MUCH INTO IT.

156
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,583
IT IS MY DUTY TO KEEP
STUDENTS OUT OF HARM'S WAY.

157
01:07:59,666 --> 01:08:01,000
- Akatsuki: YEAH, WELL,

158
01:08:01,083 --> 01:08:02,791
I'LL LET THOSE WORDS PROP
ME UP WHILE I'M OUT THERE.

159
01:08:02,875 --> 01:08:03,833
MY SISTER NEEDS ME.

160
01:08:04,916 --> 01:08:06,875
- Haruka: OUSAWA!

161
01:08:06,958 --> 01:08:08,791
- Akatsuki: YOU'RE NOT GONNA
KEEP ME FROM GOING.

162
01:08:08,875 --> 01:08:10,541
HAVEN'T YOU LEARNED
YOUR LESSON BY NOW?

163
01:08:16,041 --> 01:08:17,166
WISE MOVE.

164
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:19,333
I EXPECT YOU TO TAKE
GOOD CARE OF MY FRIENDS.

165
01:08:21,666 --> 01:08:25,458
- INSOLENCE. LET'S GET THE
OTHER STUDENTS TO SAFETY.

166
01:08:25,541 --> 01:08:27,250
AND ONCE WE'VE
"CORRALLED" EVERYONE.

167
01:08:27,333 --> 01:08:28,875
WE WILL COME FOR YOU, OUSAWA.

168
01:08:28,958 --> 01:08:29,916
REST ASSURED.

169
01:08:31,375 --> 01:08:34,083
ALL RIGHT THEN, WE'VE
GOT A JOB TO DO, PEOPLE.

170
01:08:34,166 --> 01:08:35,833
HERE'S THE BREAKDOWN
AS I SEE IT.

171
01:08:35,916 --> 01:08:39,125
I'LL CARRY YOU BOTH TO BASE
CAMP ON MY WAY TO THE ICU.

172
01:08:39,208 --> 01:08:40,666
IF WE'RE GONNA
DO THINGS HIS WAY,

173
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:43,125
THEN WE'RE GONNA NEED A HUB
TO OPERATE FROM EFFECTIVELY.

174
01:08:43,208 --> 01:08:46,000
I WANT US RUNNING LIKE A WELL
OILED MACHINE WITHIN THE HOUR.

175
01:08:46,083 --> 01:08:47,833
- ( Miu panting )

176
01:08:52,666 --> 01:08:55,250
- HELLO, MY DEAR SIR.

177
01:08:55,333 --> 01:08:57,208
PLEASE, STEP OUT OF MY WAY.

178
01:08:57,291 --> 01:08:59,666
WE HAVE NO BUSINESS
WITH EACH OTHER.

179
01:08:59,750 --> 01:09:01,666
THERE'S NO POINT IN
GETTING ONESELF INVOLVED

180
01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:03,958
IN ANOTHER MAN'S GAME,
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE?

181
01:09:04,041 --> 01:09:06,458
MY QUARREL LAYS WITH
THE GIRL, NOT YOU.

182
01:09:06,541 --> 01:09:08,208
SO IN THE INTEREST
OF YOUR GOOD HEALTH...

183
01:09:08,708 --> 01:09:09,833
- SHUT UP!

184
01:09:09,916 --> 01:09:11,708
I'M NOT DOING
THIS FOR MY HEALTH!

185
01:09:11,791 --> 01:09:13,208
AND YOU'RE WRONG IF
YOU THINK YOU HAVE

186
01:09:13,291 --> 01:09:15,416
NO BUSINESS WITH ME, HOTSHOT.

187
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:16,583
YOU AREN'T GOING ANYWHERE.

188
01:09:18,541 --> 01:09:20,375
- HOW UNFORTUNATE.

189
01:09:20,458 --> 01:09:23,083
I RATHER HOPED IT WOULDN'T'VE
COME TO THIS, ACTUALLY.

190
01:09:23,166 --> 01:09:25,000
YOU DO KNOW THAT SINCE
I'VE DEACTIVATED

191
01:09:25,083 --> 01:09:28,541
THE PROTECTIONS BARRIER,
INJURIES ARE PROBABLE, YES?

192
01:09:29,708 --> 01:09:31,625
- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
CATCH ME FIRST, DOUCHEBAG.

193
01:09:31,708 --> 01:09:32,666
- I ACCEPT.

194
01:09:38,833 --> 01:09:39,791
YOU POOR FOOL.

195
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:42,583
TRAGIC.

196
01:09:42,666 --> 01:09:44,333
WAS THAT MOVE A
LAST DITCH EFFORT

197
01:09:44,416 --> 01:09:46,333
TO CLOSE THE GAP
BETWEEN OUR ABILITIES?

198
01:09:46,416 --> 01:09:49,833
BECAUSE IF SO, I DON'T SUSPECT
IT WILL BE OF MUCH HELP TO YOU.

199
01:09:49,916 --> 01:09:52,000
IF YOU'RE SERIOUS
ABOUT FIGHTING ME,

200
01:09:52,083 --> 01:09:53,625
DON'T EXPECT ME TO SHOW MERCY.

201
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:56,916
CLEVER.

202
01:10:10,041 --> 01:10:11,333
- OH, CRAP.

203
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:13,041
DUDE, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TRYING TO PROVE?

204
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:14,083
YOU'RE AN IDIOT!

205
01:10:19,208 --> 01:10:20,791
- Phil: TINKERING WITH
BAROMETRIC PRESSURE

206
01:10:20,875 --> 01:10:22,208
SO THAT THE HEAT
FROM MY SPELL

207
01:10:22,291 --> 01:10:24,875
CREATES THIS LITTLE HALL
OF MIRRORS FOR YOU?

208
01:10:24,958 --> 01:10:26,041
VERY NICE.

209
01:10:26,125 --> 01:10:27,250
VERY NICE INDEED.

210
01:10:27,333 --> 01:10:28,750
FORGIVE ME.

211
01:10:28,833 --> 01:10:31,083
I THOUGHT SUCH A DELICATE
MANEUVER OUT OF YOUR RANGE.

212
01:10:32,416 --> 01:10:34,541
EVIDENTLY, THE
CUNNING LITTLE VIXEN

213
01:10:34,625 --> 01:10:37,166
INSPIRES YOU TO OUTSTRIP
YOUR LIMITATIONS.

214
01:10:37,250 --> 01:10:38,541
- Onizuka: TO HELL WITH THAT!

215
01:10:38,625 --> 01:10:41,416
I'M NOT DOING THIS FOR
HER, I'M DOING IT FOR ME!

216
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:44,125
I'VE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT
MYSELF THESE PAST FEW WEEKS.

217
01:10:44,208 --> 01:10:46,416
SEE, I'VE ALWAYS BEEN THE KIND
OF GUY WHO THUMPED HIS CHEST,

218
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:48,000
ACTED LIKE EVERYONE
ELSE WAS LUCKY

219
01:10:48,083 --> 01:10:49,750
TO BREATHE THE SAME AIR AS HIM.

220
01:10:49,833 --> 01:10:51,458
FACT IS, THOUGH, I'M A COWARD.

221
01:10:51,541 --> 01:10:53,541
I'M AFRAID OF PEOPLE
STRONGER THAN ME.

222
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:56,791
AND BECAUSE I COULDN'T STAND
TO BE CALLED OUT ON MY BULLSHIT,

223
01:10:56,875 --> 01:10:59,083
I WOUND UP OPENING THE
DOOR FOR A TERRORIST.

224
01:11:00,541 --> 01:11:02,541
NOT AN EASY THING TO LIVE WITH.

225
01:11:02,625 --> 01:11:05,125
IT'S GONNA HAUNT ME
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE!

226
01:11:05,208 --> 01:11:06,500
IF OUSAWA HADN'T STEPPED UP,

227
01:11:06,583 --> 01:11:08,791
THINGS WOULD'VE BEEN A
HELLUVA LOT WORSE.

228
01:11:08,875 --> 01:11:10,458
IT'S HUMBLING TO FIND
OUT YOUR PETTINESS

229
01:11:10,541 --> 01:11:12,333
COULD'VE COST INNOCENT
PEOPLE THEIR LIVES.

230
01:11:13,541 --> 01:11:15,208
WELL, THAT'S THE OLD ME!

231
01:11:15,291 --> 01:11:17,625
I'M NOT THAT ASSHOLE ANYMORE.

232
01:11:17,708 --> 01:11:21,166
I'M DONE WITH BEING AFRAID OF
PEOPLE WHO'RE STRONGER THAN ME!

233
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:22,208
I'M A NEW MAN!

234
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:24,583
- BORING.

235
01:11:24,666 --> 01:11:26,875
AND HERE I HAD YOU
PEGGED FOR A STRAY,

236
01:11:26,958 --> 01:11:28,833
WHEN TRULY YOU'RE NOTHING
MORE THAN A QUIVERING,

237
01:11:28,916 --> 01:11:30,875
BROKEN DOWN HOUSE MUTT.

238
01:11:30,958 --> 01:11:32,916
OH, WELL. NEITHER
HERE NOR THERE.

239
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,416
AT DAY'S END,

240
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:36,750
THE HOWLING OF ONE IS MUCH LIKE
THE YELPING OF THE OTHER.

241
01:11:36,833 --> 01:11:39,875
REALLY, ALLOW ME THIS KINDNESS.

242
01:11:39,958 --> 01:11:42,041
STAND DOWN BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

243
01:11:42,125 --> 01:11:44,791
CHEAP TRICKS AND SNEAK ATTACKS
WILL AVAIL YOU PRECIOUS LITTLE

244
01:11:44,875 --> 01:11:46,791
AGAINST SOMEONE OF MY CALIBER.

245
01:11:46,875 --> 01:11:48,250
DON'T DO THIS TO YOURSELF.

246
01:11:48,333 --> 01:11:49,458
- TO HELL WITH YOU!

247
01:11:49,541 --> 01:11:52,291
THING IS, EVEN A
MUTT HAS ITS PRIDE!

248
01:11:52,833 --> 01:11:53,791
( grunts )

249
01:12:00,083 --> 01:12:01,166
- ( Phil smirks )

250
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:02,750
THE DOG THAT ROARED, EH?

251
01:12:02,833 --> 01:12:03,791
SUCH A PITY.

252
01:12:08,708 --> 01:12:10,166
- ( yells )

253
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,250
- AGONIZING, I'M SURE.
BUT NOT NECESSARILY FATAL.

254
01:12:23,166 --> 01:12:25,125
RECALL THIS MERCY, MY FRIEND.

255
01:12:25,208 --> 01:12:27,500
SINCE YOU ONLY FIGHT TO SPARE
SOME TATTERED VESTIGE

256
01:12:27,583 --> 01:12:28,958
OF YOUR WOUNDED PRIDE.

257
01:12:29,041 --> 01:12:31,458
T'WOULD BE UNCOUTH OF
ME TO KILL YOU OUTRIGHT.

258
01:12:31,541 --> 01:12:33,333
I HUNT ONLY DARK CLANSMEN.

259
01:12:36,333 --> 01:12:39,666
AFTER ALL, SUCH IS
MY DUTY AS A HERO.

260
01:12:49,291 --> 01:12:52,500
- HEY, GET YOUR DAMN
HANDS OFF ME.

261
01:12:52,583 --> 01:12:55,041
SAVE THE SHAMAN
ACT FOR YOUR SISTER,

262
01:12:55,125 --> 01:12:56,916
I THINK SHE RAN OFF THAT WAY.

263
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,125
- I KNOW. SHUT UP.

264
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:00,625
- STOP IT.

265
01:13:00,708 --> 01:13:02,583
HE'S AFTER HER.
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY TIME.

266
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:05,083
SHE'S IN TROUBLE.

267
01:13:05,166 --> 01:13:07,791
QUIT WORRYING ABOUT
ME AND GET OUT OF HERE.

268
01:13:07,875 --> 01:13:10,875
- CALM DOWN. I KNOW
YOU'RE OUT THERE.

269
01:13:10,958 --> 01:13:12,041
COME OUT.

270
01:13:12,125 --> 01:13:13,583
- Motoharu: DAMN IT.

271
01:13:13,666 --> 01:13:16,333
MAN, YOU GET YOUR JOLLIES
OFF SPOILIN' MY FUN, DON'T YA?

272
01:13:16,416 --> 01:13:18,208
I WAS AT FULL CAMO!

273
01:13:18,291 --> 01:13:20,041
HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN
I WAS FOLLOWING YOU?

274
01:13:20,125 --> 01:13:22,375
- SINCE FOREVER.
WHAT KINDA QUESTION IS THAT?

275
01:13:22,458 --> 01:13:23,583
YOU'VE BEEN ON ME LIKE A SHADOW

276
01:13:23,666 --> 01:13:25,458
FROM THE MOMENT THIS
THING KICKED OFF.

277
01:13:25,541 --> 01:13:28,500
SORRY, MAN. HATE TO TELL YA,
BUT STEALTH AIN'T YOUR THING.

278
01:13:28,583 --> 01:13:30,000
- DUDE, SERIOUSLY?

279
01:13:30,083 --> 01:13:31,541
WELL NOW THAT'S JUST RUDE.

280
01:13:31,625 --> 01:13:34,291
IF STEALTH AIN'T MY THING,
TACT SURE AS HELL AIN'T YOURS.

281
01:13:34,375 --> 01:13:35,583
I MEAN, JEEZ.

282
01:13:35,666 --> 01:13:38,458
- WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.
GET DOWN HERE.

283
01:13:38,541 --> 01:13:40,458
I NEED YOU TO TAKE
THIS GUY TO THE ICU.

284
01:13:41,291 --> 01:13:42,250
DON'T SCREW IT UP.

285
01:13:44,750 --> 01:13:46,958
- UGH, SUCH A TEASE,

286
01:13:47,041 --> 01:13:48,333
SO MUCH FOR SNEAKING
A FRONT ROW SEAT

287
01:13:48,416 --> 01:13:50,500
TO YOUR PYROTECHNICS, I SUPOSE,

288
01:13:50,583 --> 01:13:53,208
OH, WELL. LET'S GET YOU TO
THE NURSE'S OFFICE, CHAMP.

289
01:13:53,291 --> 01:13:56,291
- HEY, DON'T TAKE
ORDERS FROM HIM.

290
01:13:56,375 --> 01:13:59,250
BASTARD WHO DID THIS TO
ME IS A TOTAL NUTCASE.

291
01:13:59,333 --> 01:14:01,708
YOUR BOYFRIEND'S GONNA NEED
YOU BEFORE THIS IS OVER.

292
01:14:02,625 --> 01:14:04,333
- AH, SENSE OF HUMOR!

293
01:14:04,416 --> 01:14:05,666
DUDE, SHUT THE HELL UP.

294
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:06,833
SAVE YOUR ENERGY.

295
01:14:06,916 --> 01:14:09,708
IF YOU DIE ON ME,
I'M THE ONE IN TROUBLE.

296
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:12,000
WHEN THE MAN SAYS, "JUMP",
YOU JUMP.

297
01:14:12,083 --> 01:14:14,583
'SIDES, MISSIONS DON'T
GET MUCH EASIER, DO THEY?

298
01:14:14,666 --> 01:14:17,000
HOW PATHETIC WOULD I COME
OFF IF I COULDN'T DO THIS?

299
01:14:17,708 --> 01:14:18,916
RIGHT, AKKI?

SERIOUS DAMAGE AND IS

01:14:40,833 --> 01:14:43,166
DUE TO WHAT YOU JUST HEARD
THE NICE LADY TALKING ABOUT,

311
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:44,625
THE RANKING MATCHES UNDERWAY

312
01:14:44,708 --> 01:14:47,291
ARE IMMEDIATELY SUSPENDED
UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.

313
01:14:47,375 --> 01:14:48,875
THAT MEANS EVERYBODY STOP.

314
01:14:48,958 --> 01:14:51,333
THIS IS NOT A HOAX,
THIS IS NOT A DRILL.

315
01:14:51,416 --> 01:14:53,958
ALL COMBAT NEEDS TO CEASE
AND DESIST RIGHT NOW.

316
01:14:54,041 --> 01:14:56,208
PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPONS
AND HIKE IT TO BASE CAMP.

317
01:14:57,958 --> 01:15:00,708
THE DETAILS OF THE ATTACK ARE
A LITTLE SKETCHY AT THE MOMENT,

318
01:15:00,791 --> 01:15:02,750
BUT IT'S AN EXTREMELY
COMPLEX SITUATION,

319
01:15:02,833 --> 01:15:04,416
I CAN TELL YOU THAT MUCH.

320
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,791
ALL HANDS ON DECK.

321
01:15:05,875 --> 01:15:08,000
- THAT'S WHAT I CALL
A QUICK TURNAROUND.

322
01:15:08,083 --> 01:15:09,833
- Ryohei: OH, AND OUSAWA?

323
01:15:09,916 --> 01:15:11,833
IN CASE YOU'VE GOT DESIGNS
ON HOGGING THE GLORY,

324
01:15:11,916 --> 01:15:13,041
JUST SO YOU KNOW,

325
01:15:13,125 --> 01:15:14,791
WE WILL REEL YOU IN
IF YOU GO TOO FAR OFF

326
01:15:14,875 --> 01:15:16,791
THE RESERVATION ON YOUR OWN.

327
01:15:16,875 --> 01:15:18,041
NO MAN'S AN ISLAND, DUDE.

328
01:15:18,666 --> 01:15:20,083
REMEMBER THAT.

329
01:15:20,166 --> 01:15:21,125
- APPRECIATE THE CONCERN,

330
01:15:22,041 --> 01:15:23,708
BUT GOOD LUCK TRACKING ME DOWN.

331
01:15:23,791 --> 01:15:24,750
ADIOS!

332
01:15:30,166 --> 01:15:32,666
- THIS SHOULD BE FAR ENOUGH TO
KEEP EVERYONE OUT OF HARM'S WAY.

333
01:15:34,041 --> 01:15:35,291
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

334
01:15:35,375 --> 01:15:36,875
- Haruka: SPIRIT MAGIC
PROVIDES A METHOD

335
01:15:36,958 --> 01:15:39,583
FOR DIVINING ONE'S PATH
IN LIFE. WE USE IT HERE

336
01:15:39,666 --> 01:15:42,583
AS A MEANS OF RUNNING BACKGROUND
CHECKS ON NEW RECRUITS.

337
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:46,833
SOMETHING ROBBED YOU
OF YOUR HAPPINESS,

338
01:15:46,916 --> 01:15:48,291
IN A LAND CALLED ALAYZARD,

339
01:15:48,375 --> 01:15:51,291
EVERYTHING YOU KNEW AND
LOVED WAS CRUELLY DESTROYED.

340
01:15:51,375 --> 01:15:53,375
LIFE, AS YOU ONCE
UNDERSTOOD IT CHANGED,

341
01:15:53,458 --> 01:15:55,875
AND NOW FOLLOWS
A DOWNWARD SPIRAL.

342
01:15:55,958 --> 01:15:57,666
WHEREVER YOU TREAD,
THE CRUEL SPECTER

343
01:15:57,750 --> 01:15:59,875
OF ISOLATION SHADOWS
EVERY FOOTFALL.

344
01:16:00,791 --> 01:16:03,041
ENEMIES SHADOW THAT SPECTER,

345
01:16:03,125 --> 01:16:04,791
AND FRIENDS GIVE
YOU A WIDE BERTH.

346
01:16:05,791 --> 01:16:07,583
I'M SORRY.

347
01:16:07,666 --> 01:16:10,041
NOT A PARTICULARLY UPLIFTING
FORTUNE, IT WOULD SEEM.

348
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,333
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

349
01:16:12,416 --> 01:16:13,416
I STRONGLY ADVISE AGAINST

350
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,958
EXPECTING TOO MUCH
OF YOUR ALLIES.

351
01:16:19,416 --> 01:16:20,583
- Miu: I'VE WEATHERED
MORE THAN MY SHARE

352
01:16:20,666 --> 01:16:23,333
OF ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS.

353
01:16:23,416 --> 01:16:25,750
WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS ONE
THAT'S GOT ME SO SCARED?

354
01:16:31,083 --> 01:16:32,041
( gasps )

355
01:16:34,125 --> 01:16:36,791
OF COURSE. OH, GOD. OF COURSE!

356
01:16:38,250 --> 01:16:41,750
THIS ONE'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE,
BECAUSE I'M ALONE.

357
01:16:43,541 --> 01:16:45,041
- Phil: MADE OUR PEACE, HAVE WE?

358
01:16:46,750 --> 01:16:47,708
- ( exhales )

359
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,291
- ALLOW ME TO
REINTRODUCE MYSELF.

360
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:55,375
MY NAME IS PHIL BURNETT.

361
01:16:55,458 --> 01:16:58,416
ON BEHALF OF THE TRIPARTITE
ALLIANCE OF ALAYZARD,

362
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:00,458
I HAVE COME HERE TO RETRIEVE
THE ERRANT DAUGHTER

363
01:17:00,541 --> 01:17:02,333
OF FALLEN DARK LORD, GARIUS.

364
01:17:02,416 --> 01:17:04,000
AND SO BE A HERO.

365
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:11,833
- Miu: YOU WEAR THE EMBLEM
OF THE DISDIA EMPIRE.

366
01:17:13,458 --> 01:17:14,708
- I DO.

367
01:17:14,791 --> 01:17:17,083
IT WAS BESTOWED UPON
ME BY MY RESCUERS,

368
01:17:17,166 --> 01:17:19,500
UPON MY UNTIMELY
SUMMONS TO YOUR WORLD.

369
01:17:20,833 --> 01:17:23,416
OH, YES. I'M NATIVE
TO THIS WORLD.

370
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:25,000
BORN, BUT NOT BRED.

371
01:17:25,083 --> 01:17:26,708
- I DON'T CARE
WHERE YOU'RE FROM!

372
01:17:26,791 --> 01:17:28,458
ALL I CARE ABOUT IS
THE FACT THAT YOU THINK

373
01:17:28,541 --> 01:17:29,958
YOU'RE GOING
TO TAKE ME BACK!

374
01:17:30,041 --> 01:17:32,875
- THAT'S RIGHT, MY LADY.
INDEED, I AM.

375
01:17:32,958 --> 01:17:35,000
- NONSENSE! THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

376
01:17:35,083 --> 01:17:36,791
NO ONE WHO RETURNS
TO THEIR HOME WORLD

377
01:17:36,875 --> 01:17:38,208
CAN CROSS BACK TO ALAYZARD,

378
01:17:38,291 --> 01:17:40,916
AND THE OTHER WORLD GATE
DOES NOT OPEN FOR MY KIND!

379
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,791
- LISTEN TO YOURSELF, CHILD.

380
01:17:42,875 --> 01:17:45,583
DOES THAT NOT FLY IN THE
FACE OF YOUR EXPERIENCE?

381
01:17:45,666 --> 01:17:47,583
THE UNIVERSE IS MYSTERIOUS.

382
01:17:47,666 --> 01:17:50,041
THE OTHERWORLD
GATE ESPECIALLY SO.

383
01:17:50,125 --> 01:17:52,666
THUS, DO YOU STAND
BEFORE ME NOW?

384
01:17:52,750 --> 01:17:56,083
PERHAPS YOUR BELOVED ROGUE
HERO HAS A SPECIAL TALENT?

385
01:17:56,166 --> 01:17:59,083
PERHAPS I, BEING A HERO,
HAVE SOMETHING SIMILAR.

386
01:18:00,375 --> 01:18:02,666
HEROES MOVE BETWEEN WORLDS.

387
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:05,916
HOW ELSE COULD THIS CONVERSATION
WE'RE HAVING EVEN BE POSSIBLE?

388
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:08,041
- I DON'T KNOW.

389
01:18:08,125 --> 01:18:10,416
- DID YOU REALLY THINK THERE
WOULD BE LASTING REFUGE

390
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:11,708
FOR YOU IN THIS WORLD?

391
01:18:11,791 --> 01:18:14,291
YOU, THE SCION OF A DARK LORD?

392
01:18:14,375 --> 01:18:16,708
WHAT WOULD POSSESS A LADY
WITH YOUR HERALD TO BELIEVE

393
01:18:16,791 --> 01:18:18,125
EVEN FOR A MOMENT

394
01:18:18,208 --> 01:18:21,125
THAT SHE COULD LIVE OUT
HER DAYS FREE FROM CARE?

395
01:18:21,208 --> 01:18:23,083
OR WAS THIS SIMPLY A LARK?

396
01:18:23,166 --> 01:18:25,166
- YOUR WORDS TWIST
EVERYTHING AROUND!

397
01:18:25,250 --> 01:18:27,041
I WILL NOT LISTEN TO YOU!

398
01:18:27,125 --> 01:18:28,083
( grunts )

399
01:18:30,083 --> 01:18:31,791
- BACK HOME IN ALAYZARD,

400
01:18:31,875 --> 01:18:34,291
YOU WILL BE GIVEN
A PUBLIC EXECUTION.

401
01:18:34,375 --> 01:18:35,333
- ( grunts )

402
01:18:36,083 --> 01:18:37,500
( screams )

403
01:18:40,166 --> 01:18:41,750
- Phil: DESPITE YOUR
FATHER'S DEMISE,

404
01:18:41,833 --> 01:18:44,625
MANY OF HIS CLANSMEN
CONTINUE TO RESIST.

405
01:18:44,708 --> 01:18:46,458
SO IT SHALL ALWAYS BE.

406
01:18:46,541 --> 01:18:49,458
UNLESS, OF COURSE, HIS
BLOODLINE IS EXTINGUISHED.

407
01:18:49,541 --> 01:18:50,791
THAT MIGHT STAY THEM.

408
01:18:51,750 --> 01:18:53,625
CAN YOU NOT LET GO OF YOUR LIFE,

409
01:18:53,708 --> 01:18:56,333
KNOWING THAT YOUR
SACRIFICE WILL SECURE PEACE?

410
01:18:56,416 --> 01:18:58,083
- DO YOU HEAR YOURSELF?

411
01:18:58,166 --> 01:18:59,625
WHAT'S THE ADVANTAGE
TO KILLING ME THERE

412
01:18:59,708 --> 01:19:01,333
AS OPPOSED TO DOING IT NOW?

413
01:19:01,416 --> 01:19:04,708
A PUBLIC EXECUTION IN ALAYZARD
WOULD SERVE NO PURPOSE!

414
01:19:04,791 --> 01:19:06,291
DON'T TALK TO ME
OF SECURING PEACE.

415
01:19:06,375 --> 01:19:07,791
I SEE THROUGH YOU!

416
01:19:07,875 --> 01:19:10,208
THERE'S ONLY ONE POSSIBLE REASON
FOR DOING THINGS YOUR WAY!

417
01:19:10,791 --> 01:19:12,125
OH, YES. I KNOW.

418
01:19:12,208 --> 01:19:13,625
YOU WOULD USE ME AS BAIT!

419
01:19:13,708 --> 01:19:15,416
YOU WOULD LURE THE
DARK CLAN TO MY RESCUE

420
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:17,333
AND SLAUGHTER THEM LIKE CATTLE!

421
01:19:17,416 --> 01:19:20,041
THE ONLY PEACE YOU WANT
IS THE PEACE OF GENOCIDE!

422
01:19:20,125 --> 01:19:22,875
MY, MY. YOU ARE A
CLEVER SHREW, AREN'T YOU?

423
01:19:22,958 --> 01:19:25,833
IT IS A HARSH REALITY,
I REALIZE, BUT,

424
01:19:25,916 --> 01:19:27,791
DOES IT REALLY CHANGE
THE BIGGER PICTURE?

425
01:19:27,875 --> 01:19:30,375
WHAT PRECISELY ARE YOU
IN A POSITION TO DO?

426
01:19:30,458 --> 01:19:32,250
YOUR OPTIONS ARE LIMITED.

427
01:19:32,333 --> 01:19:35,000
BE CONTENT WITH THE
PEACE YOUR LIFE WILL BRING.

428
01:19:35,083 --> 01:19:37,458
EVEN IF YOUR CLANSMEN WON'T
BE AROUND TO WITNESS IT.

429
01:19:37,541 --> 01:19:40,333
- NO! I'D SOONER DIE RIGHT
NOW THAN ALLOW THAT!

430
01:19:40,416 --> 01:19:42,208
- OH, AND ON THE OFF
CHANCE YOU'RE THINKING

431
01:19:42,291 --> 01:19:44,333
OF ENDING YOUR FIGHT HERE,

432
01:19:44,416 --> 01:19:47,916
KNOW THAT IF YOU DIE IN
THIS WORLD, BY YOUR OWN HAND,

433
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,500
I'LL KILL YOUR FRIENDS.

434
01:19:49,583 --> 01:19:50,583
- COWARD!

435
01:19:50,666 --> 01:19:52,833
AND YOU CALL YOURSELF A HERO?

436
01:19:52,916 --> 01:19:54,041
YOU SICKEN ME!

437
01:19:54,125 --> 01:19:56,000
- SAYS THE SPOILED
BRAT WHO CURRIED FAVOR

438
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:58,875
WITH DADDY'S MURDERER
TO SAVE HER OWN SKIN.

439
01:19:58,958 --> 01:20:02,125
KINDLY EXCUSE YOUR INSULT IF IT
HAS DIFFICULTY HITTING THE MARK,

440
01:20:02,208 --> 01:20:03,833
YOU RANK, TRAITOROUS WHORE!

441
01:20:07,041 --> 01:20:08,500
- HOW DARE YOU!

442
01:20:08,583 --> 01:20:11,541
I WILL KILL YOU FOR THOSE WORDS
IF IT'S THE LAST THING I DO!

443
01:20:11,625 --> 01:20:12,875
YOU BASTARD!

444
01:20:12,958 --> 01:20:14,166
TAKE IT BACK RIGHT NOW!

445
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:17,625
- DEAR ME. DID I EXPOSE
AN UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTH?

446
01:20:17,708 --> 01:20:18,708
SO SORRY.

447
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:21,000
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

448
01:20:21,083 --> 01:20:23,541
-HOW WAS HE PERSUADED
TO BE YOUR RESCUER?

449
01:20:23,625 --> 01:20:26,166
HIS PASSION FOR YOUNG
MAIDENS IS WELL KNOWN.

450
01:20:26,250 --> 01:20:29,458
YET HIS INTEREST IN YOU IS
TO THOSE OF US ON THE OUTSIDE

451
01:20:29,541 --> 01:20:31,625
MORE THAN A TRIFLE PERPLEXING.

452
01:20:31,708 --> 01:20:35,416
I AM INTRIGUED TO FIND OUT WHAT
MAGNIFICENT CHARMS YOU COMMAND.

453
01:20:36,458 --> 01:20:38,250
OH, DON'T DISCRIMINATE NOW.

454
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:39,833
YOU MIGHT CHARM ME.

455
01:20:39,916 --> 01:20:41,625
WHO KNOWS, MAYBE I'LL
BE IMPRESSED ENOUGH

456
01:20:41,708 --> 01:20:43,791
TO LET YOU LIVE A BIT LONGER.

457
01:20:43,875 --> 01:20:45,333
- NO! STOP!

458
01:20:45,416 --> 01:20:48,250
- STILL CLAWING FOR A WAY
AROUND THIS, ARE YOU?

459
01:20:48,333 --> 01:20:50,458
YOU DEAR, SWEET, DELUDED GIRL.

460
01:20:50,541 --> 01:20:54,291
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU FULLY GRASP
THE FINALITY OF YOUR SITUATION.

461
01:20:54,375 --> 01:20:56,875
YOU ARE THE ISSUE OF
A FALLEN DARK LORD,

462
01:20:56,958 --> 01:20:59,583
WERE I SUDDENLY DEALT OUT OF
YOUR SAD FATE, THERE WOULD BE

463
01:20:59,666 --> 01:21:02,041
A LONG LINE OF MEN CUT
FROM THE SAME CLOTH,

464
01:21:02,125 --> 01:21:04,375
WAITING TO BE YOUR EXECUTIONER.

465
01:21:04,458 --> 01:21:06,250
WILL YOU FEND THEM OFF FOREVER?

466
01:21:08,291 --> 01:21:10,500
- Akatsuki: BUT I'M HERE
FOR YOU EITHER WAY.

467
01:21:10,583 --> 01:21:11,916
JUST KNOW THAT.

468
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,500
IF YOU EVER NEED TO CRY,
BUT THE TEARS WON'T COME,

469
01:21:15,583 --> 01:21:16,750
I CAN MAKE IT SO THEY DO,

470
01:21:16,833 --> 01:21:19,125
AND NOBODY ELSE CAN DO
THAT FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.

471
01:21:19,208 --> 01:21:20,166
NOT EVEN YOURSELF.

472
01:21:22,583 --> 01:21:26,625
- THE LONGER YOU LIVE,
THE MORE PEOPLE WILL PERISH.

473
01:21:26,708 --> 01:21:28,458
BOTH HERE AND IN ALAYZARD.

474
01:21:28,541 --> 01:21:29,541
- PLEASE, NO.

475
01:21:35,375 --> 01:21:36,333
- Akatsuki: BAD MOVE.

476
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:38,875
REAL BAD.

477
01:21:38,958 --> 01:21:40,166
A PRETTY YOUNG THING CRYING

478
01:21:40,250 --> 01:21:42,750
ON A BEAUTIFUL MOONLIT
NIGHT LIKE THIS?

479
01:21:42,833 --> 01:21:44,083
THAT'S WHEN I STEP IN.

480
01:21:46,291 --> 01:21:49,791
UNDERSTAND THIS, YOU HURT
HER AND YOU ANSWER TO ME!

481
01:21:50,666 --> 01:21:52,166
- ( theme song playing )

482
01:21:52,250 --> 01:21:53,375
- ( singing in Japanese )

483
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,666
- Listy: THIS BODES ILL
FOR ALL INVOLVED, I FEAR.

484
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:27,458
SHOULD BURNETT AND THE
ROGUE SCRAPE SHIELDS,

485
01:23:27,541 --> 01:23:29,708
YOU CAN BE SURE IT
WILL NOT END WELL.

486
01:23:29,791 --> 01:23:32,583
THOSE WHO PREY UPON AKATSUKI
OUSAWA OR HIS LOVED ONES

487
01:23:32,666 --> 01:23:35,625
FIND THEMSELVES AT ODDS
WITH A MERCILESS WARRIOR.

488
01:23:35,708 --> 01:23:38,291
WOE BETIDE BARAM'S WOLF
IF HE'S FOOLHARDY ENOUGH

489
01:23:38,375 --> 01:23:40,625
TO DRAG AKATSUKI'S
FRIENDS INTO THE ROW

490
01:23:40,708 --> 01:23:42,208
OR FOR THAT MATTER,
IF HE WRINGS A TEAR

491
01:23:42,291 --> 01:23:44,000
FROM SOME COMELY
YOUNG MAIDEN'S EYE

492
01:23:44,083 --> 01:23:45,875
WHILE THE CUR IS IN EARSHOT.

493
01:23:45,958 --> 01:23:48,541
NEXT EPISODE. "WHERE I BELONG."

494
01:23:48,625 --> 01:23:49,583
UH-OH.
