WE THANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,375

8
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:40,458

9
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,375
IF THE BRASS FINDS OUT YOUR
ABSENCE SLIPPED THE NOTICE

10
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:43,583
OF EVERY MAN ON MY TEAM,

11
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:46,708
THEY'LL END UP USING ME
FOR TARGET PRACTICE!

12
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:49,250
- I RECOMMEND A SWEEP
OF THE BATHROOMS.

13
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:53,458
- OH, MY GOD. PRATT! WE
HAVE A SITUATION DOWN HERE!

14
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:04,750
- HA! TIME FOR ACTION!
WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THIS IS.

15
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:07,083
OUR ESTEEMED LEADER MEANS
TO GAUGE OUR ABILITY

16
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:09,750
TO PERFORM IN HIS ABSENCE!

17
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:12,333
AND YOURS TRULY LITERALLY
WROTE THE BOOK ON THIS.

18
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:15,000
SO THEN WE WILL SIMPLY FOLLOW
THESE SECURITY MANUALS

19
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:16,458
TO THE LETTER, AND VOILA!

20
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:20,916
ORDER WILL PREVAIL!
YOU ARE DISMISSED.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,291
- ( theme song playing )

22
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:23,916
- ( singing in Japanese )

23
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,500
- RIGHT. ONLY ONE MINUTE LEFT.

24
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:11,958
REMEMBER, YOU FORGET TO PUT
YOUR NAME DOWN AND IT'S A ZERO.

25
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,416
- ( snoring )

26
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,208
- ( exclaims )

27
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:32,666
HOW THE? HE ACED IT!

28
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,583
- ( bell ringing )

29
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:44,208
- Kuzuha: TOO LATE TO WORRY
ABOUT FAILING NOW, I SUPPOSE.

30
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,833
- OH, SURE, WHATEVER.
LIKE YOU BROKE A SWEAT.

31
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:50,125
LITTLE MISS SCHNOZ IN
A BOOK NEVER FAILS.

32
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,041
THINK YOU HAD IT IN THE BAG?

33
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,458
- EH, I DON'T KNOW.

34
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:59,875
EITHER YOU BOMBED, OR YOU'RE
NOT A FAN OF THE RAIN.

35
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:03,250
- MUST BE THE RAIN. YOU CAN'T
HAVE TANKED THAT BADLY.

36
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,083
- NOT TO ADD TO YOUR WOES, MIU,

37
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:06,583
BUT KEEP IN MIND
THE RANKING MATCHES

38
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,166
ARE JUST ROUND THE CORNER.

39
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,208
YOU'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT
THROUGH THE WEEK LIKE THIS.

40
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,083
- KNOW WHAT I THINK
WILL LIFT YOUR SPIRITS?

41
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,208
THREE LITTLE WORDS.
CHANGE OF SCENERY.

42
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:15,916
- NICE TRY, GIRLS!

43
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:21,958
BUT I'M AFRAID AKKI HAS
OTHER ENGAGEMENTS.

44
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,833
LOOK ALIVE, BRO, YOU'RE WITH ME.

45
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,500
- FOR WHAT?

46
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,125
REMIND ME YOUR NAME?

47
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,916
- WHY YOU GOTTA PLAY
A BROTHER LIKE THAT?

48
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,166
YOU KNOW THE NAME'S KAIDO!

49
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,541
COME ON, DUDE! MOTOHARU?
BABEL'S SOCIAL PARIAH?

50
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,500
WE HAD A LITTLE SPARRING
MATCH ON THE ROOF.

51
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,250
YOU GOT TICKED I WANTED
TO SHAKE YOUR HAND.

52
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:43,291
WE WOUND UP AGREEING TO HOOK
YOU UP WITH A BUDDY OF MINE!

53
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:47,291
- OH YEAH. THAT MIDDLE PART'S
DEFINITELY RINGING SOME BELLS.

54
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:48,666
- A FRIEND OF YOURS?

55
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,083
- UH-UH.

56
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,875
- YEAH, WELL THEY'RE SURE
BUSTING EACH OTHER'S BALLS

57
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,208
LIKE THEY'RE OLD PALS.

58
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,041
- YOU THINK MAYBE IT'S A
LITTLE TOO SOON FOR THIS?

59
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,875
- Chikage: LET'S LEAVE 'EM TO
THEIR BONDING RITUAL.

60
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,583
HEY, WHO'S IN THE
MOOD FOR ICE CREAM?

61
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,250
- Miu: ME!
- Akatsuki: SERIOUSLY?

62
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,791
- WHOA. PRETTY SWANK
DIGS, BLONDIE.

63
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,958
- NO WAY. THIS IS YOUR
FIRST TIME OVER HERE?

64
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,583
- THINGS HAVE BEEN KINDA HECTIC
SINCE WE TRANSFERRED.

65
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,291
I DON'T GET OUT VERY MUCH.

66
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,583
THERE'S PARTS OF THIS PLACE
I AIN'T SEEN ON A MAP,

67
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,916
LET ALONE BEEN INTO.

68
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,958
- THE SHOP BUILDING'S MY
PARADISE. AWESOMELY RETRO.

69
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,458
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

70
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:32,083
- IT'S NOT EXACTLY MY STYLE.

71
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:35,750
SO WHERE'S THIS BUDDY OF YOURS
YOU WANT TO SHOW ME OFF TO?

72
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,625
- YOU'LL SEE. THIS JOINT'S
KIND OF HIS CLASSROOM.

73
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:41,000
- YO, KAIDOU!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

74
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,666
- YOU SEEN THE OLD MAN?

75
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,958
- OUT BACK, DICKING AROUND.

76
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:46,125
ANY IDEA WHAT THE PISSY
MOOD'S ALL ABOUT?

77
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,875
DUDE'S BEEN ICE COLD.

78
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:48,916
- ( laughs )

79
00:05:56,166 --> 00:06:01,958
- YOU'RE KIDDING ME.
BABEL'S GOT A RACE TRACK?

80
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:04,833
- SWEET, HUH? OF COURSE IT'S
NOT SO MUCH FOR RACING

81
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:07,916
AS IT IS FOR SCHOOL
EXPERIMENTS AND STUFF.

82
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,291
A-HA, THERE HE IS.
WHAT'S UP, POPS?

83
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:16,541
SO THAT BADASS I'VE BEEN TELLING
YOU ABOUT? TOTALLY BROUGHT HIM.

84
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:20,125
AKATSUKI. COME HERE.
SAY HI TO THE MAN.

85
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,041
- DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
HE'D GIVE A DAMN.

86
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,625
- THIS BETTER BE GOOD.

87
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,291
- DON'T BE SUCH A HARD-ON.

88
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,000
I ASKED YOU IF WE COULD
CHECK THE THING OUT

89
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,708
AND YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T CARE.

90
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:48,250
I'VE GOT A FEELING
AKKI CAN TAME HER.

91
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,750
- I DON'T THINK SO.

92
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,833
HE'LL JUST WIND UP LIKE YOU,
HOLED UP IN THE INFIRMARY.

93
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,083
- YOU DON'T KNOW THAT
UNLESS YOU LET HIM TRY!

94
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:00,250
YOU'RE JUST AFRAID IT'LL
BE HIM INSTEAD OF YOU!

95
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:14,791
- I WOULDN'T...

96
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,166
- MIND TELLING ME WHAT
THE HELL THAT THING IS?

97
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:37,916
- THE SLEIPNIR.
RUNS ON SPIRITUAL ENERGY.

98
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,250
ENGINE'S PURE ORICHALCUM.

99
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,458
MAXIMUM OUTPUT OF
SIXTEEN MILLION,

100
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:45,458
SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY
THOUSAND HORSEPOWER.

101
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,708
TOP SPEED'S RUMORED TO
BREAK THE SOUND BARRIER,

102
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:50,000
BUT NO ONE'S CONFIRMED IT YET.

103
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,625
- THE THING IS SHE HASN'T
FOUND THE RIGHT MATCH YET.

104
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,125
I MEAN YOU SAW IT.

105
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:57,208
HELL, ANYONE SHE DOESN'T TAKE
A SHINE TO GETS JACKED UP.

106
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,416
- YOU'RE TELLING ME IT
DECIDES WHO RIDES?

107
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,583
- THAT'S PRETTY MUCH
THE LONG AND SHORT OF IT.

108
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,166
I TRIED TO RIDE HER FOR
THE LONGEST TIME

109
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,083
TILL I DECIDED IT
WASN'T WORTH DYING.

110
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:08,333
- THE JOLT SHE GAVE YOU JUST
NOW WAS JUST A WARNING.

111
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:11,041
TOUCH HER AGAIN AND SHE'LL FIRE
ENOUGH JUICE THROUGH YOUR VEINS

112
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,125
YOU'LL BE DEAD 'FORE YOU
HIT THE GROUND.

113
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,958
- HE'S NOT LYING, MAN. REMEMBER,

114
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:18,500
THAT'S OVER SIXTEEN MILLION
HORSEPOWER YOU'RE DEALING WITH.

115
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:22,000
STILL, THOUGH, SHE'S GONNA
WARM TO YOU, I CAN FEEL IT!

116
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:25,291
- HOLD ON A SEC.
NOT TO BE A DOUCHE BUT, YEAH.

117
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,666
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO EXPLAIN TO ME

118
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,000
WHY THIS BIKE IS WORTH
RISKING MY LIFE.

119
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,416
- HELL IF I KNOW.

120
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:36,250
A REAL MAN WOULD WANNA
FIND OUT, THOUGH.

121
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,916
MAYBE YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

122
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,666
- ( sighs )

123
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,666
- ARE YOU DUMB ENOUGH
TO TRY AGAIN?

124
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,833
- YEAH, I'M NOT REALLY SURE.

125
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,250
- HEY, WORD OF ADVICE.

126
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,458
NO MOTORCYCLE'S WORTH
GETTING YOURSELF KILLED.

127
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,666
AND NO ONE EXPECTS
YOU TO BE YOUR DAD.

128
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:55,083
- DUDE, YOU DON'T
WANT TO GO THERE.

129
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,583
- SORRY, KID.

130
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,708
THE SLEIPNIR'S ONLY HAD ONE
MASTER LONG AS I BEEN HERE.

131
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:01,833
AND THAT'S GOUKI OUSAWA.
YOUR DEAR OLD FATHER.

132
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:06,458
- OH, YEAH? AND HOW
DO YOU KNOW HIM?

133
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:10,000
- SPOKE WITH HIM A FEW TIMES,
BUT THAT WAS A WHILE BACK.

134
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,625
SO, GET WHAT I'M
TELLING YOU NOW?

135
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,166
THE NEXT PERSON
WHO RIDES THIS BIKE

136
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,416
WILL HAVE TO BE ON
PAR WITH A LEGEND

137
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,541
AT A BARE MINIMUM.

138
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,750
SOMETHING TELLS ME THE HONOR
AIN'T GONNA GO TO HIS SON.

139
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,833
- NICE TRY.

140
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,916
NOW I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

141
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,791
BRING IT ON, LEGEND!

142
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,583
- WHAT ON EARTH IS CAUSING
THESE SHOCK WAVES

143
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,750
EMANATING FROM THE LABORATORY?

144
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,541
WELL, WHATEVER THE CASE,
IT'S MY DUTY TO LOOK INTO IT.

145
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,458
I-IS THAT...

146
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,083
- ( sonic boom )

147
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,250
- UGH. OF COURSE IT'S HIM.

148
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:14,250
HOW IN THE?
SUPERSONIC WAVES?

149
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:17,791
I CAN SCARCELY BREAK THE SOUND
BARRIER AND I'M A WIND WIELDER!

150
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,250
THIS KIND OF
SPEED ISN'T POSSIBLE!

151
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:23,250
LOOK AT HIM. LIKE
THERE'S NOTHING EASIER!

152
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,625
CONGRATULATIONS, YOU'VE
EARNED COMPLAINTS

153
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,041
FROM EVERY QUARTER
OF THE SCHOOL, OUSAWA.

154
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,583
PLEASE GATHER YOUR THINGS.

155
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:51,375
YOU WILL BE ACCOMPANYING ME
TO THE HEAD OFFICE IMMEDIATELY.

156
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:54,000
- WOW. TALK ABOUT OVERREACTING.

157
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,375
- I WILL HAVE YOU KNOW

158
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,375
THAT YOU'RE IN SERIOUS
BREACH OF BABEL POLICY, SIR!

159
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,166
THIS RACETRACK
ISN'T A PLAYGROUND!

160
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,583
TO CONDUCT AN EXPERIMENT
OF THIS MAGNITUDE,

161
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,958
ONE REQUIRES THE STUDENT
COUNCIL'S APPROVAL.

162
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:08,041
- OH, YEAH? FIRST I'VE HEARD
OF IT. OKAY. FINE. NOTED.

163
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,583
- RIGHT!

164
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:10,791
- I'D CONSIDER IT
A PERSONAL FAVOR

165
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,000
IF YOU'D LET HIM OFF
WITH A WARNING.

166
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,791
BLAME'S ON MY HEAD ANYWAY
WHEN YOU GET RIGHT DOWN TO IT.

167
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,291
I AM THE ONE WHO
LET HIM TEAR-ASS

168
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,166
ALL OVER THE PLACE
ON THIS THING.

169
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,250
- WAIT, YOU? BUT THAT'S...

170
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:28,541
- WELL, KID. LOOKS LIKE THE
SLEIPNIR IS KINDA FOND OF YA.

171
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:31,541
THAT'S A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY,
BUT I THINK YOU CAN HANDLE IT.

172
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,166
HEY, HOP OFF SO
I CAN FINE-TUNE HER

173
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,583
AND MAYBE YOU CAN RIDE HER HOME.

174
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:38,166
- UM, EXCUSE ME. NO! I'M
AFRAID IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

175
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,625
THE STUDENT COUNCIL WILL BE
CONFISCATING THIS MACHINE

176
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:45,708
AS EVIDENCE FOR WHEN AKATSUKI'S
CASE GOES TO TRIBUNAL.

177
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,458
( screaming )

178
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,250
HOW DARE YOU? YOU, YOU ANIMAL!

179
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,791
- IT'S NOT ALWAYS MY FAULT
WHEN YOUR CLOTHES VANISH.

180
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:58,708
BUT THEN AGAIN I DID WAKE HER
UP, SO MAYBE THIS ONE IS ON ME.

181
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:01,625
HONESTLY IT'S GETTING
HARD TO KEEP TRACK.

182
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:04,000
ANY-WHO, WHAT'S IT GONNA BE, VP?

183
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,416
YOU WANT THIS BABY?
SHE'S ALL YOURS.

184
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,125
- NO! KEEP IT AWAY!

185
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,500
I WANT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO

186
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:10,791
WITH A CHEAP PIECE
OF ENGINEERING

187
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:13,458
THAT'S AS DEPRAVED AS
THE BASTARD WHO OWNS IT!

188
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:14,625
- ( phone ringing )

189
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,000
- HELLO?

190
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,125
YES.

191
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:26,625
BUT THAT'S VIRTUALLY IN THE
HEART OF THE COMMERCE DISTINCT.

192
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:30,833
NO, I UNDERSTAND. I'LL BE
THERE AS SOON AS I CAN.

193
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,250
LUCKY YOU, DOG.

194
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:35,291
A SITUATION FAR MORE IMPORTANT
REQUIRES MY ATTENTION.

195
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,250
BUT MARK MY WORDS.

196
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,666
SOON YOU'LL FEEL THE
FULL WEIGHT OF MY WRATH.

197
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,208
THE HOUR WILL CO-

198
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:56,125
THIS GESTURE DOESN'T
EXCUSE YOU. DON'T THINK IT DOES.

199
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:59,166
BUT I PROMISE, IT WILL BE
RETURNED FULLY LAUNDERED.

200
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,500
- WHATEVER, BABE.

201
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,708
- Pilot: PEACE EYE TO BABEL.
COME IN, BABEL.

202
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:28,375
WE'VE GOT A GROUP OF TERRORISTS
HOLED UP ON THE 47TH FLOOR.

203
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,250
EXACT NUMBER UNKNOWN,
BUT A ROUGH ESTIMATE

204
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,416
OF SOMEWHERE IN THE
NEIGHBORHOOD OF TWENTY.

205
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:39,208
ALL OF THEM APPEAR TO BE ARMED.
ASSAULT RIFLES OR COMPARABLE.

206
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:42,708
WE'VE CONFIRMED AT LEAST FIFTY
HOSTAGES BEING HELD AT GUNPOINT.

207
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,708
NO IDEA IF THIS CHECKS OUT,
BUT THE BASTARDS

208
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,583
ARE CLAIMING AFFILIATION
WITH CRIMSON TWILIGHT.

209
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,083
WE'RE GOING TO ERR ON
THE SIDE OF CAUTION

210
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,500
AND TURN THE REIGNS
OVER TO YOU GUYS

211
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:53,458
AS PER SECTION E-35 OF
THE HOMELAND DEFENSE MANUAL.

212
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,791
WE'LL BE STANDING BY IF YOU
NEED US. GOOD LUCK IN THERE.

213
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,791
- Ryohei: CORRECT
ME IF I'M WRONG,

214
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,333
BUT WITH THE CRIMSON
TWILIGHT OUTFIT,

215
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:05,416
AREN'T SUPERHUMAN ABILITIES
A CONDITION OF MEMBERSHIP?

216
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,750
SEEMS LIKE
OVERKILL TO HAVE

217
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:09,000
TWENTY OF THEIR PEOPLE
ON FIFTY HOSTAGES.

218
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,541
JUST SAYING.

219
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,041
- Minami: MY BET IS THEY'RE
A BUNCH OF PISS-ANT NOBODIES

220
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,125
WAVING A CT BANNER
FOR THE PRESTIGE.

221
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,041
- THAT'S LIKELY THE CASE.

222
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,166
- Ryohei: YEAH, WELL PISS-ANTS
CAN STILL BE PLENTY HAZARDOUS

223
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,750
TO YOUR HEALTH.

224
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,958
- Woman: I HOPE OUR VIEWERS
AT HOME CAN SEE THIS!

225
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,791
ONE OF THE MEN HAS... I THINK
THAT'S A SUB-MACHINE GUN!

226
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:31,375
- UNLESS OUR DEMANDS ARE
MET TO EVERY LAST DETAIL,

227
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,250
THESE PEOPLE ARE GONNA DIE!

228
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:36,541
THE POWER OF CRIMSON TWILIGHT
WILL BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY!

229
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,458
- DO WE KNOW WHAT
THEIR DEMANDS ARE?

230
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,666
- Ryohei: THEY WANT THE SUMMIT
POSTPONED INDEFINITELY,

231
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,208
AND FOUR OF THEIR
BUDDIES WHO GOT BAGGED

232
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:47,375
IN THIS MORNING'S SWEEP
RELEASED FROM POLICE CUSTODY.

233
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,458
- NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

234
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:50,833
WE'LL TAKE OUT
THE SENTRIES FIRST

235
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,166
SO WE CAN DROP THROUGH THE ROOF.

236
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,416
- LET'S DO THIS.

237
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,291
- ROCK ON.

238
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,208
BUT, YEAH, BEFORE WE DO,
I WAS SORT OF CURIOUS.

239
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,416
WHAT'S WITH THE ENSEMBLE?

240
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,791
- KINDLY FOCUS ON
THE TASK BEFORE US!

241
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,583
- ( thudding )

242
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,291
- THE ROOFTOP HAS BEEN SECURED.

243
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,958
WE'RE ABOUT TO PASS
THROUGH THE 48TH FLOOR.

244
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,750
EVERYBODY ON HIGH ALERT.

245
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:43,958
- ( groans )

246
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,041
- ( chuckles )

247
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,041
WE'RE JUST OUTSIDE THE SCENE.

248
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,583
COMMENCING WITH
CLEAN-UP OPERATION.

249
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,041
- ( both groaning )

250
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,625
- ( yelling )

251
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,333
- ( hostages gasping )

252
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,458
- ( screaming )

253
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,416
- RIGHT! NOBODY BE A HERO!

254
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,416
- Man: UH-UH! STAY THERE!
DON'T THINK WE WON'T DO IT!

255
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,166
- ( gasping )

256
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:03,916
- OKAY, TELL THEM TO
TOUCH DOWN ON THE ROOF.

257
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,416
LIKE IT OR NOT, THEY'RE GIVING
US A LIFT OUT OF THIS PLACE.

258
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,958
- Pilot: WAITING ON YOUR
INSTRUCTIONS, MA'AM.

259
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,791
- DO IT.

260
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,958
THAT LITTLE GIRL'S SAFETY IS OUR
NUMBER ONE PRIORITY RIGHT NOW.

261
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,166
WHEN THEIR ATTENTION
IS ON THE HELICOPTER,

262
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,000
I WANT US IN DELTA FORMATION
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

263
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,000
- UNDERSTOOD, MA'AM.
- TCH.

264
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,541
GREAT. I LOVE NOT
HAVING OPTIONS.

265
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:44,125
- ( crying )

266
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,291
- ( rotors whirring )

267
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:19,916
- ( gasping )

268
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,291
- ( grunting )

269
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,583
- COME ON, GUYS. SHE'S
BARELY OUTTA PRESCHOOL.

270
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,500
DIDN'T THINK IT
THROUGH, DID YOU?

271
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:39,833
YOU'RE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT,
SWEETIE. NO MORE TEARS, OKAY?

272
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,583
- UESAKI! MINAMI!

273
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,250
- ( terrorists groaning )

274
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,208
- YOU RECKLESS LUNATIC!

275
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,875
I HOPE YOU'RE AWARE OF THE
TRAGEDY YOU MIGHT'VE CAUSED!

276
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,208
THE NEXT TIME YOU FEEL LIKE
DOING SOME GRANDSTANDING,

277
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,625
WE'LL ALL THANK YOU TO DO IT

278
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,750
SOMEWHERE OTHER THAN THE MIDDLE
OF A HOSTAGE SITUATION!

279
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:09,041
- AND WHAT IF I HADN'T BEEN
HERE? WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE?

280
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,958
THING IS, I NEVER
IGNORE A GIRL'S TEARS.

281
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:14,333
THAT'S JUST KIND
OF A RULE I HAVE.

282
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:16,125
I DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO UNDERSTAND.

283
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,875
- YOU'RE IMPOSSIBLE.

284
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,333
- Woman: MY BABY!

285
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,791
- MOMMY!

286
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,208
- ( both crying )

287
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,958
- HOLD IT! YOU CAN'T
JUST SWAGGER OFF!

288
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,541
I'M NOT DONE WITH YOU!

289
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,333
YOU INSUFFERABLE PIG!

290
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:42,291
- THANK YOU! YOU SAVED MY GIRL!
IT WAS LIKE A MIRACLE.

291
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:45,666
- UH, ACTUALLY I
CAN'T TAKE THE CREDIT.

292
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,500
- I'M IN YOUR DEBT FOREVER!

293
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,833
- ( indistinct muttering )

294
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,250
- HA! I'LL BLOW ALL OF US
STRAIGHT TO HELL.

295
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,875
- ( footsteps approaching )

296
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,291
- WHY DO THEY
NEVER CHECK TO SEE

297
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:18,250
IF MORE THAN ONE OF YOU IS
MASQUERADING AS A HOSTAGE?

298
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,125
YOU'D EXPECT PEACE
EYE TO MISS THAT,

299
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:23,666
BUT THE STUDENT COUNCIL
REALLY OUGHT TO KNOW BETTER.

300
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,458
FOR THAT MATTER,
AKKI SHOULD, TOO.

301
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,291
- WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

302
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:31,166
- ME? NOBODY YOU'D
HAVE HEARD OF.

303
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,083
SPEAKING OF WHICH, ABOUT THE
WHOLE CRIMSON TWILIGHT TAG...

304
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
NOT A GOOD PLAY, MAN.

305
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,750
- ( screaming )

306
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,208
- ( humming )

307
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,291
( sighing )

308
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:49,833
- ( water splashing )

309
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,750
- ( door bell ringing )

310
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:56,041
- Miu: I GOT IT.

311
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:02,916
UH. OH, NO. HE'S DONE SOMETHING
REALLY TERRIBLE, HASN'T HE?

312
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:07,583
- NO, I...

313
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,916
I AM RETURNING HIS
FRESHLY LAUNDERED JACKET.

314
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,750
- AH. THAT WAS NICE OF YOU.

315
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,708
- I HAD THEM USE
EXTRA DETERGENT.

316
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:18,541
- OKAY.

317
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,916
UM, YOU'RE WELCOME TO COME IN
AND HAVE A BITE TO EAT IF YOU...

318
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,458
- THANK YOU, NO. I'VE EATEN.

319
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,541
I MUST BE GOING
INSANE. JUST WALK.

320
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,333
- ( theme song playing )

321
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,416
- ( singing in Japanese )

322
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:19,375
- Listy: WITHOUT A DOUBT,

323
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:21,291
THE MOST DISQUIETING TRAIT
I'VE NOTICED IN AKATSUKI

324
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:22,750
DURING OUR TRAVELS TOGETHER

325
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:24,583
IS HIS COMPLETE AND UNABASHED
CALM BEFORE WOMEN OF,

326
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:27,208
SHALL WE SAY,
COMPROMISED MODESTY.

327
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:28,541
THE GENERAL RUN OF MEN

328
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:30,541
WOULD GO FLUSH-CHEEKED AND
AVERT THEIR EYES INSHAME

329
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:33,666
AT THE SIGHT OF A YOUNG MAIDEN
INAUSPICIOUSLY AU NATURALE,

330
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,875
BUT NOT THE CHURL.

331
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:36,500
HE JUST STANDS FIRM
WITH A GLEAM IN HIS EYE

332
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,083
LIKE A SHREWD CONNOISSEUR.

333
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,541
ARE ALL MEN LIKE THAT
IN HIS WORLD, I WONDER?

334
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:43,375
NEXT EPISODE, A CRUDE
PANIC ON THE BEACH.

335
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:46,375
PERHAPS IT'S MY IMAGINATION,
BUT I DISTINCTLY HEAR SCREAMING.
