1
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
( loud splash )

2
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:28,958
- ( puffing and panting )

3
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,041
- THANKS FOR THE VOTE
OF CONFIDENCE.

4
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:40,375
SENDING A WHOLE TEAM AFTER ME,

5
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:42,500
BUT I DOUBT YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO ACTUALLY KILL ME!

6
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:47,541
- ( explosions )

7
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:56,666
- KNOW WHAT?
I TAKE THAT BACK.

8
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,041
I'M A LITTLE INSULTED THAT YOU
THINK A COUPLE HUNDRED ARROWS

9
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,291
WOULD GET THE JOB DONE.

10
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:06,875
- BULL'S EYE!

11
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:11,791
IMPOSSIBLE.

12
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:29,458
- ( theme song playing )

13
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:30,625
- ( singing in Japanese )

14
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:14,458
- WE DOING THIS THE
EASY WAY OR THE HARD WAY?

15
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:17,666
- THE EASY WAY HAS YOU SAFE
IN SOMEONE'S BED BEFORE SUNRISE.

16
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,916
- Both: ANSWER CAREFULLY!

17
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,333
- ( both shout )

18
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:24,500
- OH, SCRUMPTIOUS LOOKING
EARLOBE YOU GOT THERE.

19
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:25,625
- ( whimpers )

20
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,791
- ( exclaims )

21
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,333
- WELL, IF IT'S THAT
IMPORTANT TO YOU.

22
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,708
- AKATSUKI! YOU ARE
AN ABSOLUTE ROGUE!

23
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,666
- BABY, YOU'VE GOT NO IDEA.

24
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,583
I'M KINDA LIKING THE PET NAME.

25
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:02,625
ADD "HERO" TO THAT,
AND IT'S A DEAL.

26
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:06,500
REALLY? SURE HOPE YOU FIGHT
BETTER THAN YOU HIDE, VALKYRIE.

27
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:09,708
- ( footsteps )

28
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:14,083
- I SHALL ASK YOU
ONCE MORE, SIR KNIGHT.

29
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,541
RETURN WITH US
TO THE PALACE,

30
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,833
SO THERE MAY BE
AN END TO THIS.

31
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,458
- YOU REALLY KNOW HOW
TO SEND A GUY OFF,

32
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:20,833
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT MUCH.

33
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,208
HOT DAMN, LADIES, WISH
THE MAID CAFES BACK HOME

34
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:26,250
HAD HALF THE FINE LOOKING
TAIL I SEE RIGHT HERE.

35
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,041
- I TAKE IT FROM THAT
COMMENT YOU TRULY INTEND

36
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,708
TO RETURN TO YOUR OWN REALM,
AKATSUKI THE BRAVE?

37
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,625
HOW UNFORTUNATE.

38
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,250
DAMN HIM!

39
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,666
- AND THE FLOWERS
ARE STILL STANDING!

40
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,875
- CHILDISH TACTICS!

41
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,166
- ( she whimpers )

42
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,458
- ON YOUR FEET, WARRIOR!

43
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,250
- WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

44
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,958
YOU SPRAIN YOUR ANKLES
TRYING TO CATCH THE BOUQUET?

45
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,458
IT'S OKAY.

46
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,916
MAYBE WE JUST ROLL DOWN THOSE
STOCKINGS AND PLAY DOCTOR.

47
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,250
- ( maids scream nervously )

48
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,833
- YOU LECHEROUS BASTARD.

49
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:02,041
I WAS WRONG TO
ADDRESS YOU AS "KNIGHT."

50
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,958
HOW CAN YOU BE CALLED SUCH
WHEN NO MAN WORTHY OF THE TITLE

51
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:08,875
WOULD LET TALES OF THIS LEWD
BEHAVIOR TRAIL IN HIS WAKE?

52
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,791
- YOU DON'T THINK STORIES
ABOUT WHIP-BRANDISHING,

53
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:13,791
MAN-HUNGRY MAIDS
WOULD CATCH LIKE WILDFIRE?

54
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,500
- MY ORDERS COME FROM
PRINCESS LISTY HERSELF.

55
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,625
YOU'RE NOT TO PASS THROUGH
THE OTHERWORLD GATE.

56
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:21,625
I'M TO STOP YOU BY
ANY MEANS NECESSARY.

57
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,958
- HER HIGHNESS IS JUST
GONNA HAVE TO BE DISAPPOINTED.

58
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,291
- READY YOURSELF!

59
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,250
- DONE AND DONE.
BRING IT ON.

60
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:30,791
- ( rapid footsteps )

61
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:31,916
- ( swords clang )

62
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,375
- ( birds chirping )

63
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,083
- CLEARLY I UNDERESTIMATED
YOUR GIFT

64
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,750
FOR CATCHING THE
FAIRER SEX OFF GUARD

65
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,666
IF YOU CAN TROUNCE
VALKYRIE.

66
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:53,708
- ( she exclaims )

67
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,250
- THAT WAS A COMPLIMENT,
I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW!

68
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,583
I DON'T DISPENSE
THEM LIGHTLY!

69
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:01,458
YOU WILL ACKNOWLEDGE
YOUR BETTER! AKATSUKI!

70
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,083
- SORRY, PRINCESS.
I DON'T REALLY APPRECIATE

71
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,291
HAVING YOUR PARTY GALS
UNLEASHED ON ME.

72
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,583
NO MATTER WHAT YOUR
INTENTIONS WERE.

73
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:17,041
- DO YOU REALLY MEAN
TO ABANDON THIS WORLD?

74
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,208
- I'VE KILLED
A DARK LORD, SWEETHEART.

75
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:22,291
IF EVER THERE WAS A TIME
TO DISAPPEAR, IT'S NOW.

76
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:25,375
I STICK AROUND, GARIUS' PALS,
HIS ENEMIES, FOR THAT MATTER,

77
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:28,500
WILL BE FALLING ALL OVER
THEMSELVES FOR A PIECE OF ME.

78
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:31,208
DON'T FORGET, I'M NOT
FROM AROUND HERE.

79
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:34,000
I'M ON MY OWN WHEN THINGS
GET UGLY. THINK ABOUT IT.

80
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,750
TRUTH IS, EVEN IF
I WERE FREE AND CLEAR

81
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:42,250
OF THIS SIDE OF THE GATE,
I'VE GOT OBLIGATIONS BACK HOME.

82
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,916
- I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO.

83
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:56,125
WHAT IS THE MEANING
OF THIS? YOU ROGUE!

84
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,750
- ONLY THING I COULD THINK OF
TO DO TO STOP THE WATERWORKS.

85
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,375
KINDA WHAT I DO.

86
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:06,541
- ONE DOES NOT SIMPLY STEAL A
KISS FROM THE LIPS OF ROYALTY!

87
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,291
SUCH LIBERTIES COME DEAR!

88
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,416
- LOOK, I'M NOT A REALLY
COMPLICATED GUY.

89
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,333
THINK OF ME EVERY NOW
AND THEN WHEN I'M GONE

90
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:13,708
AND THAT'LL BE
PAYMENT ENOUGH.

91
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,666
- YOU INCORRIGIBLE VAGABOND!

92
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,583
I'LL THINK OF YOU WHEN I
CHANCE TO LOOK UPON A CRIMINAL!

93
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,208
- AH, FLATTERY.

94
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,916
REALLY WISH I WAS AS GOOD AT
FARE-THEE-WELL AS YOU ARE, BABE.

95
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,291
BUT, YOU KNOW MY RIDE'S HERE,
SO I PROBABLY BETTER GET GOING.

96
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,000
- GOOD RIDDANCE, AKATSUKI!

97
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,875
I'D WISH YOU A
SAFE VOYAGE, BUT...

98
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:33,208
I HALF WISH YOU'LL CATCH YOUR
DEATH ON THE WAY. GET THEE GONE.

99
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,666
- JUST SO YOU KNOW, I STILL
MEAN WHAT I SAID THAT DAY.

100
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,750
IF YOU EVER NEED
ME FOR ANYTHING,

101
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,291
CALL ME AND I'M THERE.

102
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,083
ALL I'M ASKING FOR
IS A LITTLE GOOD FAITH.

103
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:47,875
IF WE HAVE TRUST,

104
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,833
IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT
WE'LL BE WORLDS APART.

105
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,791
YOU KNOW THAT.

106
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:56,416
HEY! I'M ALWAYS GONNA
BE THERE FOR YOU, OKAY?

107
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,333
ALL RIGHTY, THEN.

108
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:36,125
HMMM. I WONDER IF SHE'D MIND
A FRIENDLY SQUEEZE.

109
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,708
I MEAN, COME ON. BE GOOD.

110
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:41,250
WAKEY-WAKEY. HOW
YOU FEELING?

111
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,166
OH, HEY! SO, YOU'RE NOT
ALL MANGLED. THAT'S A PLUS.

112
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,166
- ( Miu screams )

113
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,666
- OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
TRY NOT TO FREAK.

114
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,166
I REALIZE THIS IS
PROBABLY A SITUATION

115
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,291
BEYOND YOUR UNDERSTANDING,
BUT LET'S TRY TO STAY COOL.

116
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,458
- THEN QUIT LOOKING
AT ME LIKE THAT!

117
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:08,500
- SECOND OF ALL, THIS
IS MY HOUSE, MY WORLD.

118
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,208
- Akatsuki:
YOU'RE IN GOOD HANDS.

119
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,916
- WAIT, WHERE AM I?

120
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:24,708
AND, IF I'M IN GOOD HANDS,
WHY AM I NAKED?

121
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,916
- SIDE EFFECT OF CROSSING
DIMENSIONAL BARRIERS.

122
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,166
LOOK, MORE ON ALL
THAT STUFF LATER.

123
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,125
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE
INTRODUCE OURSELVES?

124
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:36,250
AKATSUKI OUSAWA.
FRIENDS CALL ME AKATSUKI.

125
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,541
IN YOUR HOME
WORLD OF ALAYZARD,

126
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:38,833
THE LADIES USED TO SPIN YARNS

127
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,625
ABOUT ME BEING SOME
KIND OF ROGUE HERO

128
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:42,416
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

129
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,000
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

130
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,000
- WELL, I... I GUESS
YOU CAN CALL ME MIU.

131
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:09,791
- ( she sighs )

132
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,625
- Akatsuki: THESE GUYS
DON'T MESS AROUND.

133
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:32,875
I'VE BEEN BACK JUST OVER A DAY

134
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:35,125
AND THEY'RE ALREADY
UP OUR BUTTS.

135
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,833
YOU REMEMBER OUR STORY, RIGHT?

136
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,083
YOUR NAME'S MIU OUSAWA

137
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,375
AND YOU'RE TOTALLY MY
LONG LOST LITTLE SISTER.

138
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:42,750
I FINALLY FOUND YOU.

139
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,666
- WE REUNITED IN ALAYZARD,

140
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,416
WHERE I'D BEEN SINCE
VANISHING FROM MY BEDROOM

141
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,958
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL.

142
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,083
- AND, AFTER WE FINALLY
RECOGNIZED EACH OTHER,

143
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,291
WE CAME BACK HOME THROUGH
THE OTHERWORLD GATE.

144
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,541
ANYBODY PRODS YOU FOR
MORE INFORMATION THAN THAT,

145
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,250
JUST TELL THEM
YOU'VE GOT AMNESIA.

146
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,166
DOWNCAST EYES ARE THE
MARK OF A TERRIBLE LIAR.

147
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,541
WHEN YOU WALK INTO A ROOM,

148
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,291
ACT LIKE YOU OWN THE
PLACE, OR THEY'LL CATCH ON.

149
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,541
BUCK UP. TRY STICKING
THAT CHEST OUT.

150
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,458
- ( Miu yells )

151
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,583
- Female voice: THE SUMMONING
SYNDROME AND YOU, AN OVERVIEW.

152
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,333
WHILE THE BEST MINDS
OF THREE GENERATIONS

153
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:21,916
HAVE YET TO FIND AN EXPLANATION

154
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,458
FOR THIS
STARTLING PHENOMENON,

155
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,375
ITS EFFECTS ARE
WELL DOCUMENTED.

156
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,833
THIRTY YEARS AGO, YOUNG
PEOPLE ACROSS THE GLOBE,

157
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,791
BEGAN DISAPPEARING
FROM OUR WORLD,

158
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,500
SUMMONED TO DIMENSIONS
ONLY IMAGINED

159
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,833
IN THE ANNALS OF FANTASY.
CURRENT ESTIMATES

160
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:36,458
PUT THE NUMBER OF
SUMMONED IN THE THOUSANDS.

161
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,541
THESE OTHER DIMENSIONS
CONTAIN PORTALS,

162
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,000
KNOWN AS OTHERWORLD GATES,

163
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:42,083
THROUGH WHICH A "SUMMONED"
CAN RETURN HOME,

164
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:45,375
THOUGH TO DATE ONLY ABOUT HALF
HAVE MANAGED TO REACH THEM.

165
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:46,833
AMONG THOSE WHO'VE RETURNED,

166
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,916
MANY HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED
TO POSSESS UNIQUE,

167
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,833
OCCULT-BASED FIGHTING TECHNIQUES
ACQUIRED WHILE AWAY.

168
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,833
TECHNIQUES INFINITELY
USEFUL IN OUR WORLD.

169
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:54,875
- ( she exclaims )

170
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,583
- MAGICAL ABILITIES, AS YOU
MIGHT IMAGINE,

171
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,791
ARE ESPECIALLY
INTERESTING TO US.

172
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,291
TO HELP RE-ACCLIMATE
THOSE EFFECTED

173
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,791
BY THE SUMMONING SYNDROME,

174
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:09,041
THE NEW UNITED NATIONS HAS
ESTABLISHED AN AUTONOMOUS STATE,

175
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,000
WHERE THESE YOUNG
PEOPLE CAN THRIVE,

176
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,458
GUIDED BY CUTTING EDGE SCIENCE
TO HARNESS THEIR POWERS

177
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,708
TO THE GREATER
BENEFIT OF HUMANKIND.

178
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,708
AND BECOME FINE, UPSTANDING
MEMBERS OF SOCIETY.

179
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,583
AS WELL AS POTENTIAL HEROES.

180
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:22,791
AS ONE OF THE SUMMONED,

181
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,416
YOU HAVE BEEN SINGLED
OUT FOR THE PRIVILEGE

182
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,166
OF ENROLLMENT INTO BABEL,

183
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,541
OUR STATE-OF-THE-ART
TRAINING FACILITY,

184
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,916
DESIGNED TO HELP YOU
FINE-TUNE THE ABILITIES ACQUIRED

185
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,666
DURING YOUR TIME ABROAD.

186
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,125
WELCOME, AND GOOD LUCK!

187
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,291
- SURE. "FOR THE
PRIVILEGE OF ENROLLMENT."

188
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:38,166
MORE LIKE THE PRIVILEGE OF
BEING DRAGGED OUT OF BED

189
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,666
AT THE ASS CRACK OF DAWN.

190
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,625
OH, AND LET'S NOT FORGET
BEING QUARANTINED

191
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:44,250
FROM EVERYTHING YOU KNOW
AND LOVE. THESE PEOPLE.

192
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:47,500
- YEAH, I TOTALLY AGREE.
UM, BROTHER.

193
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,125
OR SHOULD I SAY, BRO?

194
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,000
- OKAY. NOT THE WAY
TO TALK

195
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,625
IF YOU WANNA KEEP OUR CHARADE
UNDER THE RADAR, SIS.

196
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:56,125
- ABOUT THAT, I'M REASONABLY
SURE FROM ALL THE TESTING

197
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,833
THEY'VE DONE ON ME
THE PAST TWO HOURS,

198
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,416
THEY'RE GOING TO REALIZE
THAT I'M NOT LOCAL.

199
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,041
- I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

200
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,291
YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND, IN THIS
WORLD, HAVING COLOSSAL MANGOES

201
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,083
ISN'T A DEAD GIVEAWAY
THAT YOU'RE A FOREIGNER.

202
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:08,333
- THOSE AREN'T THE ONLY
THINGS THEY POKED!

203
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,166
- SORRY TO KEEP YOU
WAITING FOR SO LONG.

204
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,250
THERE WERE A COUPLE OF
IRREGULARITIES I NOTICED.

205
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,416
- ( he clears his throat )

206
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,541
- Akatsuki: DON'T FREAK
OUT. PLAY IT COOL.

207
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:21,166
- WHO'S FIRST, THEN?
AKATSUKI OUSAWA, IS THAT YOU?

208
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,291
- YO. WHAT'S UP? GIVE
IT TO ME STRAIGHT.

209
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,916
- YES, WELL. YOU'RE
THE PICTURE OF HEALTH.

210
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,875
TAKE THIS FILE TO THE ROOM
AT THE END OF THE HALL,

211
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,041
AND THEY'LL DIRECT
YOU FROM THERE.

212
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,166
- I APPRECIATE IT, DOC.
YOU DO GOOD WORK.

213
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,541
- Doctor: MIU OUSAWA?

214
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:36,625
- THAT'S ME.

215
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,375
- ( gasps )

216
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,625
- DID I OR DID I NOT TELL
YOU THAT IT'D BE OKAY?

217
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,666
THING IS, WHEN YOU'VE HOPPED
DIMENSIONS IT'S NORMAL

218
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,166
FOR THEIR INSTRUMENTS
TO GO A LITTLE HAYWIRE

219
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,875
TRYING TO GET A LOCK ON YOU.

220
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,500
THEY EXPECT WONKY RESULTS.

221
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:07,666
- HOW CAN YOU
BE SO RELAXED?

222
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,791
- NO BIG SECRET. SEE,
I KNEW YOU'D ACE THE EXAM,

223
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,375
SO THERE WAS NOTHING
TO GET TENSE ABOUT.

224
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,666
- YEAH THANKS, BROTHER.

225
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:20,083
I MEAN, THANK YOU, BIG
BRO OR WHATEVER IT WAS.

226
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,000
I CAN'T DO THIS!

227
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,875
- JUST CALL ME AKATSUKI
TILL YOU GET USED TO IT.

228
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,500
YOU'LL ADJUST, I PROMISE.

229
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:31,208
- Kyoya: INTERESTING.

230
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,500
- Haruka: "TRUE
HERO," "OVERLORD?"

231
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,208
LAVISH PROSE INDEED.

232
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:40,500
MAY I ASK WHAT THE PROPHECY
MEANS, MR. PRESIDENT?

233
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,208
- IT SEEMS PRETTY
CUT AND DRY TO ME.

234
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:43,458
- DOES IT?

235
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,208
- WELL, YEAH.
I MEAN, I'M NO EXPERT,

236
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:46,791
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE
THIS AKATSUKI GUY

237
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,458
IS GONNA BE THE BIG
CHEESE ONE DAY.

238
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:51,708
- Minami: SO IT WOULD BE
ACCURATE TO SAY HE'S A THREAT?

239
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,250
- Haruka: THAT'S ABSURD. HOW DO
WE KNOW ANY OF THIS IS TRUE?

240
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:57,666
SIR?

241
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:02,166
- I'M OFF TO GREET
OUR NEW OVERLORD.

242
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,750
- Instructor: EVERY NOOK
AND CRANNY OF THE SCHOOL

243
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,541
HAS BEEN INFUSED WITH
A MAGICAL BARRIER.

244
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,250
IT ESSENTIALLY KEEPS
OUR STUDENTS SAFE,

245
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:11,125
BY TRANSMUTING ANY PHYSICAL
DAMAGE THEY SUSTAIN IN BATTLE,

246
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:14,833
TO MOSTLY LOW-LEVEL BIOCHEMICAL
FEEDBACK IN THE BRAIN.

247
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,291
DON'T GET ME WRONG, IT'LL
STILL SMART LIKE THE DICKENS

248
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,041
WHEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY HIT, IT
JUST WON'T LEAVE YOU INJURED.

249
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,541
YOUR BRAIN WON'T KNOW
THE DIFFERENCE, THOUGH.

250
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:22,791
SO, TAKE A BIG ENOUGH WALLOP

251
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:25,375
AND IT IS POSSIBLE
TO DIE FROM SHOCK.

252
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,041
ALL RIGHT, KIDDOS. LET'S
GAUGE YOUR COMBAT SKILLS.

253
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:35,333
HOP TO. PICK ANY
WEAPON YOU LIKE.

254
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:45,416
NOT A BAD DECISION. YOU
GONNA TAKE ALL DAY, OR WHAT?

255
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,583
- I'M GOOD.
I GOT THESE.

256
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:50,041
- IF I HAD A DIME FOR EVERY
KID WHO SWAGGERED IN HERE,

257
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,458
EXPECTING TO WOW ME WITH
A BARE KNUCKLE BRAWL.

258
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:55,000
BUT I'M NOT GONNA TRY
TO TALK YOU OUT OF IT.

259
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,875
OKAY, LET'S GET THIS
SHOW ON THE ROAD.

260
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,708
SHOW ME WHATCHA GOT.
THAT'S RIGHT, YOU.

261
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:02,250
- PLEASE BE GENTLE.
I HAVE AMNESIA!

262
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:03,333
- Akatsuki: HOLD UP.

263
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:19,583
- OH, I AM LOVING THAT
YOU'RE A MAGE TYPE.

264
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:20,833
LOOK ALIVE, SLOWPOKE!

265
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:22,666
- ( grunts )

266
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:29,500
- EXCELLENT FORM.
LIGHTNING REFLEXES.

267
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:30,916
HOW COULD SHE
CAST SO QUICKLY

268
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,500
WHILE MAINTAINING A
PROTECTIVE SHIELD?

269
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,250
- THIS MEAN SHE PASSED?

270
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,000
- I WASN'T SURE
ABOUT THE RULES.

271
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,500
AM I ALLOWED TO DISTRACT MY
OPPONENT WITH A DECOY BARRIER

272
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,333
WHILE I CONJURE AN
ATTACK, OR IS THAT CHEATING?

273
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:45,625
- HE'S NOT COMPLAINING.

274
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:48,291
SO, UH, DO I GET A TURN
NOW, OR WHAT?

275
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,708
I MEAN, I'LL WAIT.

276
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,500
- Kyoya: PERHAPS YOU'D BE
BETTER MATCHED WITH ME.

277
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,250
- YOU THE RESIDENT BIG SHOT?

278
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:12,125
- A PLEASURE TO MAKE YOUR
ACQUAINTANCE, AKATSUKI OUSAWA.

279
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:15,250
I AM KYOYA HIKAWA, PRESIDENT
OF BABEL'S STUDENT COUNCIL.

280
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:18,625
SO SORRY IT TOOK ME THIS
LONG TO INTRODUCE MYSELF.

281
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:21,708
- OUR APOLOGIES FOR
DISRUPTING YOUR DAY OFF, SIR.

282
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,125
- YES, YES.

283
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,791
GET THIS MAN TO THE INFIRMARY
AS SWIFTLY AS POSSIBLE.

284
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,500
- WHY'S A FACULTY MEMBER
TREATING THIS GUY

285
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,250
LIKE HE OWNS THE PLACE?

286
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,541
- WISH I KNEW.

287
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:31,958
TAKES A PRETTY
TOUGH CHARACTER

288
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,416
TO STAY AT THE TOP IN A
PLACE LIKE THIS, THOUGH.

289
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,208
JUST LOOK AT HIM. HE
KNOWS HOW GOOD HE IS.

290
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,375
- INDEED.

291
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,541
BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU
KNOW IT FOR YOURSELF AS WELL.

292
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,041
TAKE YOUR BEST SHOT.

293
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:46,166
- YOU GOT IT. JUST REMEMBER
THIS IDEA WAS YOURS.

294
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,125
- Kyoya: WHAT AN
EXCEPTIONAL GAME FACE.

295
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,083
WOULDN'T WANT TO MEET
YOU IN A DARK ALLEY.

296
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,750
FOR THE RECORD, YOU ARE AWARE
THIS IS TO BE A TEST OF SKILL

297
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,250
NOT A COMPETITION FOR
THE TITLE ALPHA MALE.

298
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,166
WE JUST WANT TO TAKE A LITTLE
SURVEY OF YOUR BATTLE PROWESS.

299
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,541
NICELY DONE, AKATSUKI,
YOU HAVE VERY GOOD REFLEXES.

300
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:06,708
- YOU SON OF A BITCH!

301
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,791
YOU TRYING TO DRAG MY
SISTER INTO THIS?

302
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,500
- LET'S JUST SAY,
GIVEN YOUR REPUTATION,

303
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:13,250
I DOUBTED SHE WOULD BE IN
MUCH DANGER OF GETTING HURT.

304
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,041
INDULGE ME A BIT FURTHER.

305
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,416
I'VE BEEN LED TO BELIEVE
THAT YOU SCOFFED AT THE IDEA

306
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,416
OF BRANDISHING A WEAPON
FOR THIS EXAM?

307
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,375
ARE YOUR FISTS SO IMPRESSIVE?

308
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:24,750
IF SO, I'D LOVE TO SEE THEM MAKE
SHORT WORK OF THAT ICE PILLAR.

309
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,375
IF YOU THINK THEY CAN.

310
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,625
- DUDE, SERIOUSLY?

311
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,416
I COULD SHATTER A GLACIER
WITH THESE THINGS.

312
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,416
- HOLD ON, THAT'S
NOT ORDINARY ICE!

313
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,958
THIS THING'S FULL OF MAGICAL
POWER. IT'S A TRICK!

314
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,166
IF YOU GO
AT IT BARE-HANDED,

315
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,166
YOU'LL SHATTER EVERY
BONE IN YOUR BODY.

316
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,041
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT,
I'M BEGGING YOU!

317
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,708
- OH, I GOTCHA. LET'S
SAY I WAS ABLE TO OBLITERATE

318
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,833
YOUR LITTLE POPSICLE
HERE WITH MY BARE HANDS,

319
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,458
THEN WOULD YOU LEAVE
THE GIRL OUT OF THIS,

320
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:51,000
SO WE CAN FIGURE THIS THING OUT
MAN TO MAN? JUST CURIOUS.

321
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:54,083
- I THINK SO. SOUNDS
QUITE REASONABLE, ACTUALLY.

322
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,500
- I'M GONNA HOLD
YOU TO THAT.

323
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,708
- Garius: WARRIOR FROM
LANDS UNKNOWN.

324
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:18,291
I LEAVE MY DAUGHTER, FLESH
OF MY FLESH, TO YOUR CARE.

325
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,083
- ( screams )

326
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,541
- WOW. HE'S SO STRONG.

327
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:34,208
- WHAT AN INCREDIBLE
PIECE OF WORK YOU ARE.

328
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,500
WITH RAW TALENT
LIKE THAT, MY FRIEND,

329
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:39,625
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE WE SQUARE OFF PROPERLY.

330
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,500
IT'S MY PLEASURE TO REPORT
THAT YOU HAVE PASSED

331
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:45,875
YOUR ENTRANCE EXAMS
WITH FLYING COLORS.

332
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,541
WELCOME TO THE BABEL FAMILY.

333
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:50,000
I THINK YOU'LL MAKE
EXCELLENT ADDITIONS.

334
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,958
- WELL IF THAT'S EVERYTHING,
I'LL BE GOING NOW, SIR.

335
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,666
- YES, THANK YOU.
THAT'S EVERYTHING.

336
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:10,791
- Kyoya: NOBLE OF YOU TO WANT
YOUR SISTER OUT OF HARM'S WAY.

337
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:14,458
I ADMIRE THAT YOU'D BARGAIN FOR
HER SAFETY WITH YOUR OWN SKIN.

338
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,541
LET US HOPE SHE'S WORTH IT.

339
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:19,583
- THAT WAS PRETTY RECKLESS.

340
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,416
YOU'RE LUCKY YOU DIDN'T
BREAK EVERY SINGLE JOINT

341
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,166
IN YOUR HAND, YOU KNOW.

342
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:25,583
- ( chuckles )

343
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:27,666
- Kyoya: A "TRUE HERO."

344
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,000
WELL, HE'LL SOON FIND

345
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:34,583
HIS POWER IS MINE.

346
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,666
- Miu: OH, WOW! IT'S LIKE
I'M AT A WEDDING BANQUET!

347
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,250
- ( he chuckles )

348
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,500
- THINK OF IT AS YOUR REWARD
FOR A WHOLE DAY AT BABEL

349
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,416
WITHOUT LETTING THE
CAT OUT OF THE BAG.

350
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,041
BETTER EAT UP BEFORE
IT GETS COLD. ENJOY!

351
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:49,041
- THANKS! YOU'RE SUCH
AN AWESOME BROTHER!

352
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,458
- Garius: WARRIOR FROM
LANDS UNKNOWN,

353
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,041
I LEAVE MY DAUGHTER,

354
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,708
FLESH OF MY FLESH,
TO YOUR CARE.

355
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:06,458
LET NOT HER AGE NOR
HER INNOCENCE DECEIVE YOU.

356
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:09,666
SHE IS THE SCION
OF A DARK LORD.

357
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,500
WHETHER SHE BE SLAIN IN
TURN, AS HER FATHER,

358
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:15,875
BY MAN, OR LAUDED
AS HIS SUCCESSOR,

359
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,416
HER DESTINY IS DESTRUCTION.
THUS I IMPLORE YOU...

360
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,375
- Miu: WHAT'S
WRONG? HEY. HELLO?

361
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,000
- SORRY, IT'S NOTHING.

362
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,666
- IT'S GONNA GET
COLD, RIGHT?

363
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,791
- RIGHT. DIG IN.

364
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,666
I'VE DONE WHAT YOU
ASKED, OLD MAN.

365
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,833
JUST REMEMBER, IT'S ME.

366
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:38,583
DON'T GET MAD IF THINGS DON'T
PAN OUT THE WAY YOU'D HOPED.

367
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:48,541
- ( theme song playing )

368
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:49,791
- ( singing in Japanese )

369
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:21,166
- Listy: I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE
THE CUR HAS LEFT.

370
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,625
TRICKING MY GIRLS INTO SENDING
HIM OFF WITH THEIR PANTIES

371
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:26,625
AND STEALING A KISS
FROM ME IN THE OFFING!

372
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:29,250
I HAVE BUT TO CALL HIM
AND HE'LL RETURN, YES?

373
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:31,541
HE BETTER HOPE I
NEVER HAVE CALL TO!

374
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:33,750
IS IT FOOLISH OF ME TO WONDER
WHAT SORT OF HI-JINX

375
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:36,500
HE'S GETTING HIMSELF INTO
BACK WHEREVER HE'S FROM?

376
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:39,583
NO DOUBT HE'S A MENACE TO
THE FAIRER SEX THERE AS WELL!

377
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:42,375
NEXT EPISODE,
"BONDS OF HOLY WATER."

378
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:45,291
HOLY WATER? HOW CAN
WATER HAVE HOLES IN IT?
