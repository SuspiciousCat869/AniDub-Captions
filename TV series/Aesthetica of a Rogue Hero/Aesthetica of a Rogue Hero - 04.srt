1
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,458
- YOU JUST HAD TO GO
AND PUSH YOURSELF.

2
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:11,958
HEY, YOU KICKED
SOME MAJOR ASS.

3
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:14,041
HOW ABOUT YOU REST
AND LEAVE THE KILL SHOT TO ME?

4
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:16,250
- CAREFUL! EVERY TIME
YOU THROW A SPELL AT IT,

5
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:18,791
THE STUPID THING JUST SEEMS
TO JUST SOAK UP YOUR ENERGY.

6
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:22,291
- OH, IS THAT ALL?

7
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:23,666
COULD BE WORSE.

8
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,083
- Akatsuki: I JUST HAVE TO
MAKE THIS COUNT.

9
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:41,833
HEY, BIRD!

10
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:45,750
BRING IT!

11
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:57,750
- ( theme song playing )

12
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:07,750
- ( theme song playing )

13
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:17,791
- ( theme song playing )

14
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:27,791
- ( theme song playing )

15
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:37,791
- ( theme song playing )

16
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:47,791
- ( theme song playing )

17
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:57,833
- ( theme song playing )

18
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:07,833
- ( theme song playing )

19
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:21,750
- ( theme song playing )

20
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,833
- ( cockatrice screeching )

21
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:26,083
- HERE IT COMES!

22
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:36,250
- OKAY. TIME TO EIGHTY-SIX
THIS FREAK SHOW.

23
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,208
- I CAN HELP YOU TAKE IT OUT.

24
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,625
- SORRY. NO TIME FOR TEAMWORK.

25
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:42,666
CHECK IT.

26
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:46,500
I'LL BE BACK.

27
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:51,875
HERE COMES ONE!

28
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,083
C'MON. GIVE ME THE DAMN THING!

29
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:57,416
YOU READY FOR TWO?

30
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,416
YOU CAN GET ANOTHER ONE.
DON'T BE A PUSS.

31
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,875
THREE!

32
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:04,125
SHIT, GUYS!
JUST HAND THEM OVER ALREADY!

33
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:07,541
AND A FOUR! AND A FIVE!
AND A SIX!

34
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,416
ALL RIGHT! AND IF SEVEN
OF THEM AIN'T ENOUGH,

35
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,000
I'M DEAD MEAT ANYWAY!

36
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,250
NOW WE'RE TALKING! TIME TO STOP
FOOLING AROUND, AKATSUKI!

37
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,375
JUST STICK IT IN!

38
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,291
- ( cockatrice screeching )

39
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:26,875
- SEE YOU AROUND.

40
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,916
I THINK I COULD GET
USED TO THIS THING.

41
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:43,333
- HOW LONG WAS I OUT?

42
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,291
- WHERE'S THE COCKATRICE?

43
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:48,625
- THANK GOODNESS! I'M SO
GLAD YOU TWO ARE OKAY!

44
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:52,666
- WAIT A SECOND. DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SAVED US ALL.

45
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,666
- KINDA. BUT ONLY BECAUSE MIU
HERE KEPT YOU ALL IN ONE PIECE.

46
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,750
IF SHE HADN'T BLOCKED ITS PATH,

47
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:01,375
WE'D BE SWEEPING YOU
UP WITH A BROOM.

48
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,041
THAT WAS GOOD WORK, SIS.

49
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,791
- I SEE. WELL, THAT'S
GOOD TO KNOW.

50
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,083
THANKS FOR THE UPDATE.

51
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,916
KEEP ME INFORMED
IF YOU FIND OUT ANYTHING...

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,958
- IT SOUNDS PRETTY OPEN
AND SHUT IN MY OPINION.

53
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:15,166
- WE HAVE A STUDENT WHO'S
BEEN GETTING PUSHED AROUND

54
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,541
SO HE TWEAKS THE PROGRAM
TO GET HIS REVENGE.

55
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,666
- I NEED TO GET RID
OF THIS THING.

56
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,666
- STUDENT COUNCIL HAS ACCESS
TO ALL OF THE SYSTEM LOGS.

57
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,125
DOESN'T HE REALIZE
WE HAVE THE ABILITY

58
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:27,916
TO SEE WHO LOGGED IN WITH A
MASTER KEY MOST RECENTLY?

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,291
- HE'S IN B CLASS. OF COURSE,
HE CAN'T COVER HIS TRACKS.

60
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,166
- DON'T HATE ON B CLASS
TOO MUCH.

61
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,250
THEIR NEWEST GUY
JUST SAVED THE DAY.

62
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,083
- IT WAS A COCKATRICE,
THAT'S ALL!

63
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,833
- I'M SORRY!

64
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:41,208
BUT IF HE'S ALREADY THAT GOOD
AND HE ONLY JUST GOT TO BABEL.

65
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,833
THEN HE MIGHT BE CLIMBING
THE RANKS BESIDE US

66
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,166
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

67
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,625
- THAT COCKY MEATHEAD
IS NOWHERE NEAR OUR LEVEL.

68
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,666
- Akatsuki: FIRST RULE
OF BORROWING SOMETHING,

69
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,791
MAKE SURE YOU PUT IT BACK
WHERE YOU FOUND IT.

70
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:14,083
- WHAT'RE YOU GETTING AT?
I DON'T FOLLOW.

71
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,750
- YOU WERE GONNA SLIP IT
INTO ONIZUKA'S POCKET.

72
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,083
TOO BAD FOR YOU,

73
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:21,000
THEY CARTED HIS DUMB ASS
TO THE INFIRMARY ALREADY.

74
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,875
SUCKS TO BE YOU, MAN.

75
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,666
NOT ONLY DO YOU GET STUCK
WITH THE SMOKING GUN,

76
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,625
BUT YOUR JUICED UP COCKATRICE
WAS A REAL DUD.

77
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:31,750
- LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

78
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,583
- AW, DON'T SELL YOURSELF SHORT.
SURE YOU DO!

79
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,458
KIND OF A SHAME.

80
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:41,250
I THOUGHT YOU WERE A GOOD GUY
WHEN I SAW YOU IN THAT LINE.

81
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,291
PRETTY COOL HOW YOU DEALT
WITH ONIZUKA'S CRAP

82
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:44,916
WITHOUT CAUSING A FUSS.

83
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,541
I THOUGHT IT SPOKE WELL OF YOU,
BUT I GUESS I WAS WRONG, HUH?

84
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:52,291
- I'M NOT STUPID. I KNOW IT ONLY
GETS WORSE IF YOU FIGHT BACK.

85
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,125
BETTER TO TAKE MY LUMPS
AND RIDE IT OUT.

86
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,250
- YEAH, THAT'S
A PRETTY GOOD OUTLOOK.

87
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:01,291
EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT YOU
ARE WAY STRONGER THAN HIM.

88
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:06,708
LIKE I COULDN'T TELL.
I WASN'T BORN YESTERDAY.

89
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,708
HE ISN'T HALF AS TOUGH AS
HE MAKES HIMSELF OUT TO BE.

90
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:12,291
ESPECIALLY THE ONES WHO GET
THEIR ROCKS OFF ACTING ALL BOSS.

91
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,083
YOU KNOW THE TYPE,
ACTING LIKE THE REST OF US

92
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,333
ARE LUCKY TO BREATHE
THE SAME AIR?

93
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,458
HE TRIED TO
START CRAP WITH ME IN CLASS.

94
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,458
I HEARD THE GEEK SQUAD
MADE HIM CLEAN THE STADIUM

95
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:21,916
AS A PUNISHMENT.

96
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,541
HE SWIPED A KEY, MADE THE
COCKATRICE ALL "OVER 9,000".

97
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:29,583
AND THEN JUST WAITED FOR THE
THING TO GET UP TO NO GOOD.

98
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,125
- Tanaka: UH, ONIZUKA,

99
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,791
YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T BE MESSING
WITH THE PROGRAM LIKE THIS.

100
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,250
- Onizuka: SHUT UP ALREADY!

101
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,791
TAKE THIS BACK TO THE KEY
ROOM, YOU LITTLE WHINER!

102
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,000
MOVE YOUR ASS!

103
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,625
- Tanaka: WHAT EXACTLY
ARE YOU IMPLYING, OUSAWA?

104
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:44,541
THAT I DOUBLED BACK TO THE
PROGRAM ROOM AFTER THE FACT,

105
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:47,333
AND MODIFIED THE COCKATRICE
TO BE EVEN DEADLIER.

106
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,666
- ( grunting )

107
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,875
- I HAVE TO ADMIT,
I'M RATHER SURPRISED BY YOU.

108
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,666
I DIDN'T HAVE YOU PEGGED
AS THE CLEVER TYPE.

109
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,250
- ( groaning )

110
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,583
- Tanaka: YOU MIGHT
AS WELL STAY DOWN!

111
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,625
MY ATTACKS ARE UNBLOCKABLE!

112
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:26,041
AS FUN AS IT IS, I NEED
TO WRAP THIS UP

113
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,000
BEFORE SOMEONE ELSE COMES BY.

114
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,583
I EXPECTED BETTER FROM YOU.

115
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,291
SO PASSING OUT,
YOUR WEAPON DISAPPEARING.

116
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:43,416
THAT WAS ALL JUST A RUSE?

117
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,916
- I PREFER TO
CALL IT "STRATEGY."

118
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,708
IT TURNS OUT IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF THEY'RE UNBLOCKABLE

119
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,458
ONCE YOU STOP THROWING THEM.

120
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:54,541
- HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE? AFTER
ALL THE ABUSE I JUST DISHED OUT,

121
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,375
HOW ARE YOU EVEN STANDING UP?

122
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,333
- WELL, SEE, MY LINKED
ENERGY MANIPULATION'S

123
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,125
A PRETTY HANDY SKILL.

124
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,875
IT HELPS ME KICK ASS
AND PROTECT MY OWN.

125
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,541
- I'M NEVER GONNA BE
ABLE TO TAKE YOU OUT

126
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:07,500
WITH MAGICAL ATTACKS,
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME?

127
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:08,958
SO BE IT!

128
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:12,291
- UH! SON OF A...
- THAT'S RIGHT.

129
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,958
THIS NEXT BARRAGE ISN'T
MEANT FOR THE LIKES OF YOU.

130
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:18,583
I'VE GOT THE BABEL BUILDING
ITSELF CAUGHT IN MY CROSSHAIRS.

131
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,583
IT WOULD SEEM THAT YOU CAN
WITHSTAND MY ATTACKS

132
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,041
WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM.

133
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,291
BUT ARE YOU SURE ABOUT
ALL THE OTHERS?

134
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,416
- THEY'LL BE OKAY.

135
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,666
THE BARRIER IS STILL IN PLACE,

136
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,791
SO THE WORST YOU'LL DO
IS KNOCK THEM ALL OUT.

137
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,791
- FUNNY THING ABOUT
THE SCHOOL BARRIER.

138
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:35,291
SURE, IT KEEPS MAGIC
FROM BEING LETHAL.

139
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,666
IT NEGATES THAT DAMAGE
LIKE A CHARM.

140
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,916
BUT IT WON'T HELP AGAINST

141
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,416
SEVERAL TONS OF BUILDING
MATERIALS CRASHING DOWN.

142
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,000
- WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL
OFF YOUR CLASSMATES, TANAKA?

143
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:48,958
- BECAUSE MY "CLASSMATES" ARE
TOO DANGEROUS TO BE LEFT ALIVE.

144
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:51,958
DO YOU KNOW WHERE THEY GO
ONCE THEY LEAVE THIS ACADEMY?

145
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:54,291
THEY'RE SENT TO BATTLEFIELDS
AROUND THE WORLD.

146
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:57,750
ALL I'M DOING IS NEUTRALIZING
FUTURE MURDERERS.

147
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,333
- AND YOU DON'T CARE HOW
MANY INNOCENT PEOPLE

148
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:00,791
YOU'RE GONNA WIPE OUT?

149
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,166
- REVOLUTION DEMANDS
A SACRIFICE.

150
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,458
YOUR SWORD AGAINST MY MAGIC.

151
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:10,291
WE'RE ABOUT TO DISCOVER
WHO'S FASTEST ON THE DRAW.

152
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,333
- Kyoya: THAT'S QUITE ENOUGH.

153
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,541
- CARE TO EXPLAIN
WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE?

154
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,500
- WHAT YOU WERE ABOUT TO DO,
FROM THE LOOKS OF IT.

155
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,625
JUST MORE CONCLUSIVELY.

156
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,916
TRULY, I DIDN'T WANT
TO INTERFERE.

157
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,583
BUT, MY DUTIES DEMANDED
I TAKE ACTION.

158
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,333
I COULD HARDLY RISK
THE COLLATERAL DAMAGE

159
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,250
IF YOU WERE FASTER.

160
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,375
NO OFFENSE.

161
00:09:58,541 --> 00:09:59,833
UH-OH.

162
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:02,583
- YOU OWE ME A WIN,
AND I'D LIKE TO COLLECT.

163
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,958
BUT IF I'M GONNA BE
A RESPONSIBLE BIG BROTHER,

164
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,333
KICKING YOUR ASS WILL JUST
HAVE TO WAIT.

165
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,125
- WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE
THE WOUNDED.

166
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,875
TAKE THE WORST HURT
TO THE I.C.U.

167
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,916
- I GRABBED ALL THE FIRST-AID
KITS I COULD FIND,

168
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,041
JUST LIKE YOU TOLD ME.

169
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:26,083
- ANYBODY WHO'S NOT INJURED,
PLEASE GIVE MIU A HAND.

170
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,250
- DON'T OVERDO IT WHEN YOU

171
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,750
- APPLY THE DISINFECTANT,
- OW! CAREFUL!

172
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:31,083
- DUDE, QUIT YOUR BELLYACHING
OR TURN IN YOUR MAN CARD.

173
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,583
- WE'RE STILL
WAITING ON BANDAGES!

174
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,833
- Miu: TRY NOT TO WORRY.
YOU'RE GOING TO BE JUST FINE.

175
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,125
- Female student: CAN SOMEONE
PLEASE GO ON A BANDAGE RUN?

176
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:40,083
- YEAH, I'LL DO IT!

177
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,333
- FIGURED YOU COULD USE THESE.

178
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,166
KINDA RANSACKED
THE NURSE'S OFFICE.

179
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,166
- WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
I WAS WORRIED SICK!

180
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,833
- I HAD TO TAKE CARE
OF SOMETHING.

181
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:49,708
- YOU JUST FOUGHT A SUPER
DANGEROUS MONSTER, YOU DUMMY!

182
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:52,250
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TAKE A
MINUTE TO RELAX AND NOT...

183
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,375
- Garius: KNOW THIS,
MY PRECIOUS DAUGHTER.

184
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:06,208
I SHALL MEET MY DOOM ONE DAY.

185
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,583
IF IT BE NOT A BURDEN TOO HEAVY,

186
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:12,291
I ASK YOU TO MAKE A LIFE
WITH WHOMEVER ENDS ME.

187
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:16,416
HOWEVER, IF YOU FEEL THIS FOE
UNWORTHY OF YOU,

188
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,208
I COMMAND YOU TO
STRIKE HIM DOWN.

189
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28,375
- ( door opens )

190
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,208
- FEELING ANY BETTER?

191
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,416
- UH-HUH.

192
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,458
I FEEL FINE.

193
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,625
- QUIT IT!
- YOU'RE A REALLY CRAPPY LIAR.

194
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:53,500
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SEEING
TO EVERYONE ELSE'S INJURIES.

195
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,333
NOT IF YOU WERE
MESSED UP YOURSELF.

196
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:03,208
- WHAT IS THIS? SOME KIND OF
HEALING MAGIC YOU PICKED UP?

197
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:06,708
- I WISH.
I CAN'T USE MAGIC, REMEMBER?

198
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,708
IT'S CALLED VIVIFICATION.

199
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:12,125
BASICALLY, I AWAKEN THE ENERGY
YOU'VE ALREADY GOT INSIDE YOU,

200
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,458
AND YOUR BODY
HEALS ITSELF WITH IT.

201
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:17,791
- I GOTTA ADMIT MY SHOULDER
DOES FEEL PRETTY GOOD.

202
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,125
LISTEN.

203
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,250
IF THIS ENDS UP BEING MORE
OF YOUR PERVERT HOODOO,

204
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:22,666
I'M GONNA HURT YOU.

205
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,291
I'M NOT PEEING MYSELF AGAIN.

206
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:25,666
- TAKE IT EASY.

207
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,333
I'M TRYING TO DO YOU A
FAVOR, OKAY? TRUST ME.

208
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,500
YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE
GONNA ASSUME THE WORST,

209
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,166
I'LL ROCK YOUR WORLD
WITH ONE POKE OF MY FINGER.

210
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,208
OBSERVE!

211
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,333
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

212
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:38,750
TELL ME, PERV!

213
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,250
WHAT SORT OF DEVIANT
SHENANIGANS ARE YOU UP TO?

214
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:44,083
- CALM DOWN. I JUST MADE
YOU HONEST WITH YOURSELF.

215
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,000
- GIVE IT UP!

216
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,625
I'M ON TO YOUR
KINKY MIND CONTROL.

217
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,083
WHY AM I...

218
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,083
- CRY IF YOU WANNA.

219
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,708
- HUH?

220
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,541
- OPEN THE FLOODGATES.

221
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:01,916
I'M BETTING YOU HAVEN'T
HAD A GOOD CRY

222
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,416
SINCE GARIUS DIED, AM I RIGHT?

223
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,375
- WHY WON'T YOU LEAVE ME ALONE?

224
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,416
WHAT DO YOU CARE
IF I CRY OVER HIM?

225
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:10,750
YOU DON'T.

226
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,791
SO, STOP ACTING AS THOUGH
YOU GIVE A DAMN ABOUT IT.

227
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:17,041
- WELL, AREN'T WE DADDY'S
SURLY LITTLE PRINCESS?

228
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,208
LOOK, ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT

229
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:19,750
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
BE MAGICALLY FINE

230
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,125
WITH YOUR OLD MAN BEING GONE.

231
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,458
YOU SHOULDN'T BE.

232
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:24,958
AND WHATEVER
YOU'RE SADDLED WITH,

233
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:27,916
SADNESS, DESPAIR, HATE,

234
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,250
HIT ME WITH IT. SERIOUSLY,
GIVE ME YOUR BEST SHOT.

235
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:34,041
AFTER ALL, IT'S MY FAULT
YOU'RE FEELING IT.

236
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,083
Akatsuki: I KILLED
YOUR DAD, MIU.

237
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,875
IT MUST'VE BEEN SO SUDDEN.

238
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,375
ONE DAY, HE'S ALIVE.
THE NEXT DAY, HE'S...

239
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:50,083
BUT DON'T BOTTLE IT UP, OKAY?
BETTER JUST TO LET IT OUT.

240
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:51,750
I MEAN IT.

241
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,250
I'M NO FOOL, OKAY?

242
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,625
I KNOW YOU COULD HATE ME
FOR WHAT I DID

243
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,125
BUT I'M HERE
FOR YOU EITHER WAY.

244
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,208
JUST KNOW THAT.

245
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,666
IF YOU EVER NEED TO CRY,
BUT THE TEARS WON'T COME,

246
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,166
I CAN MAKE IT SO THEY DO.

247
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,000
AND NOBODY ELSE CAN DO THAT
FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.

248
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,750
NOT EVEN YOURSELF.

249
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,916
THAT'S WHY I TAPPED IN TO
YOUR TRUE FEELINGS JUST NOW.

250
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,708
YOU NEED A GOOD CRY, AND THIS
IS AS GOOD A TIME AS ANY.

251
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:23,625
- ( Miu sobbing )

252
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:26,125
- THAT'S IT.
JUST LET EVERYTHING OUT.

253
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,708
I'M HERE FOR YOU
AND I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

254
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,500
- ( alarm ringing )

255
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,166
- ( button popping )

256
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:52,333
- THESE THINGS COULDN'T HAVE
GOTTEN BIGGER, COULD THEY?

257
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:56,291
I MEAN, THEY'RE
SO HUGE ALREADY. JEEZ.

258
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:57,583
- ( she sighs )

259
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,291
- I'LL MAKE THE PERV TAKE
ME CLOTHES SHOPPING

260
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,416
NEXT TIME WE GET A DAY OFF.

261
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,125
ON SECOND THOUGHT,

262
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,291
MAYBE I'D BETTER HAVE KUZUHA
AND IZUMI TAKE ME INSTEAD.

263
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:14,000
- Akatsuki: LET ME GUESS.
SHOPPING TRIP?

264
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,583
- YEAH.

265
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,333
I JUST HOPE YOUR WORLD HAS
TOPS THAT'LL ACTUALLY FIT ME.

266
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,125
- OH, DON'T MIND ME.

267
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:30,916
I'M JUST KNOCKING OUT ONE OF MY
ENERGY MANIPULATION EXERCISES.

268
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,833
FOR THIS PARTICULAR ONE,
YOU SEND ENERGY INTO YOUR FEET

269
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,291
AND USE IT TO STAND
PERPENDICULAR

270
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:36,916
TO A VERTICAL SURFACE.

271
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,666
- ( Miu screaming )

272
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:53,750
Newscaster: IN OTHER NEWS,
THE UPCOMING G7 SUMMIT

273
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,666
SCHEDULED FOR
THE IMPERIAL PALACE...

274
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:59,708
- Miu: I KNOW HE WAS UP THERE
FIRST AND ALL, BUT STILL...

275
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:02,375
WOULD IT HAVE KILLED HIM TO SAY
SOMETHING BEFORE I WAS NAKED?

276
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:03,666
- Newscaster: ATTENDEES
FROM ARRIVING IN JAPAN,

277
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:07,041
INCLUDING SEVERAL
MEMBERS OF COCOON.

278
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,750
THE COCOON REPRESENTATIVES
CAME EARLY,

279
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,583
PRESUMABLY TO ATTEND
THE SECRET TALKS

280
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,166
- WHAT'S WRONG?
- WHICH CERTAIN COUNTRIES

281
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,791
ARE SAID TO HOLD PRIOR TO THE
OFFICIAL START OF THE SUMMIT.

282
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,791
WHEN ASKED IF THIS WAS THE CASE,
COCOON DECLINED TO COMMENT.

283
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:29,208
- Chikage: KUZUHA. IS THAT
FORBIDDEN BLING I SEE?

284
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,958
- CLASS REPRESENTATIVES SHOULD
BE ALLOWED CERTAIN PERKS.

285
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:33,333
- HUH?

286
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:36,791
WHAT THE HECK? GET A
LOAD OF MINI MUSSOLINI.

287
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,166
- Chikage: HELLO?
- SORRY.

288
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,916
- Kuzuha: EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

289
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,625
- HEY. MAYBE THIS IS
A STUPID QUESTION.

290
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,916
BUT WHAT'S COCOON ABOUT?

291
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,916
- WELL, THAT'S PRETTY
DARN RANDOM.

292
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,333
- IT'S JUST,

293
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,500
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT IT
ON THE NEWS THIS MORNING,

294
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:53,750
AND I WAS WONDERING.

295
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,458
- I FORGOT!

296
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,666
SUMMONING SYNDROME DID A
REAL NUMBER ON YOUR MEMORY

297
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,541
OF HOW THINGS WORK
AROUND HERE, HUH?

298
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:02,333
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE HOW TRIPPY
IT MUST BE TO HAVE AMNESIA

299
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,250
AND YOU HARDLY EVER
TALK ABOUT IT.

300
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,791
- I GUESS. THEY'RE THE BEST
OF THE BEST OF US.

301
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:10,250
AND AS SUCH, THEY HELP
PRESERVE THE GLOBAL PEACE.

302
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:14,375
COCOON STANDS FOR "CHILDREN
OF CROSS OVER OTHER NATIONS".

303
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,458
YOU SEE, IT'S AN ACRONYM.

304
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:19,916
MEMBERS OF COCOON
ARE STRONG. CRAZILY SO.

305
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,125
EACH ONE IS MORE POWERFUL

306
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:24,541
THAN THEIR NATION'S
COMBINED MILITARY MIGHT.

307
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,000
AS THE LEADERS OF BABEL,

308
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,708
IT'S UP TO THEM TO SUPERVISE
AND EDUCATE KIDS LIKE US

309
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,583
WHO'VE RETURNED
FROM OTHER WORLDS.

310
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:34,666
AND TO HELP KEEP THIS WORLD AS
PEACEFUL AS IT CAN POSSIBLY BE.

311
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,458
KEEPING THE PEACE IS THE
REASON THEY SEND US HERE

312
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,208
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

313
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,208
TO MAKE SURE OUR ABILITIES
AREN'T EXPLOITED

314
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,750
BY THOSE WHO'D LOOK
TO GAIN FROM THEM.

315
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,666
AND, SO THAT BABEL CAN DEPLOY
US TO QUASH WHATEVER WARS

316
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:50,208
OR REGIONAL CONFLICTS MIGHT
FLARE UP AROUND THE GLOBE.

317
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,583
- Cocoon male 4A: LOOK.

318
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,291
I DON'T SEE THE NEED FOR US
TO CONVERGE LIKE THIS

319
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:56,791
JUST BECAUSE SOME "HERO"
HAS STEPPED ONTO THE BOARD.

320
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,208
- Cocoon female A:
IT'S POINTLESS.

321
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,666
WE'LL SEE EACH OTHER
AT THE OFFICIAL SUMMIT ANYHOW.

322
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,333
DOES THIS REALLY MERIT
A CLANDESTINE MEETING?

323
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,875
- Cocoon female B:
SO THE NORN CHECK DETERMINED

324
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,166
THIS GUY IS A "TRUE HERO," HUH?

325
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,958
HOW VERY MELODRAMATIC.

326
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:12,250
AS THOUGH WE'RE MERE INTERLOPERS
KEEPING THE THRONE WARM FOR HIM.

327
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,125
DOES THAT BOTHER ANYONE ELSE?

328
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,583
- Cocoon male B:
WHAT IF THAT'S ALL WE ARE?

329
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,916
PRETENDERS TO THE THRONE.

330
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,708
EVERY LAST ONE OF US.

331
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,958
- Cocoon male C: YOU CAN'T GIVE
IN TO THOUGHTS OF SELF-DOUBT.

332
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,791
WHAT MATTERS IS THAT WE ACT IN
ACCORDANCE WITH OUR BELIEFS.

333
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:28,125
WE MUST KEEP TO THE PATH
WE'VE CHOSEN.

334
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,500
- Cocoon female C: SO, WHAT
DO YOU MAKE OF THIS HERO?

335
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:33,125
- Kyoya: I'VE SEEN A
BIT OF WHAT HE CAN DO.

336
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:37,041
BUT AS OF YET, I CAN'T SPEAK
TO HIS FULL POTENTIAL.

337
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:40,416
FOR NOW, I'LL WATCH HIM FROM
HIS SPOT IN THE CLASS B FISHBOWL

338
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,625
AND DECIDE WHETHER HE'S WORTHY
OF JOINING OUR RANKS.

339
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,583
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER,

340
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:49,500
I DO NOT THINK AKATSUKI OUSAWA
SHALL PROVE A DISAPPOINTMENT.

341
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,458
- I GET IT NOW.

342
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:57,625
- Kuzuha: I'M A LITTLE WORRIED
ABOUT YOUR BROTHER, MIU.

343
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:00,708
I DON'T KNOW, SOMETHING SEEMS
OFF ABOUT HIM. HE'S TENSE.

344
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,166
DO YOU KNOW IF HE'S
BEEN STRESSING OUT

345
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,000
ABOUT ANYTHING RECENTLY?

346
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,541
- KIND OF.

347
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,791
AS SOON AS THEY MENTIONED
THOSE COCOON GUYS ON THE NEWS,

348
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,166
HE CLAMMED UP
AND GOT ALL WEIRD.

349
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,750
- GUESS HE'S GOT BEEF WITH THEM.

350
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,708
I'M NOT USED TO HIM
KEEPING STUFF TO HIMSELF.

351
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,166
AKATSUKI IS LIKE...

352
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,250
LIKE A BIG DUMB OPEN BOOK, ALL
DOUBLE-SPACED AND OBNOXIOUS.

353
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,250
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN,
DON'T YOU, KUZUHA?

354
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:22,458
HE'S NOT THE KIND OF GUY

355
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:25,416
I CAN IMAGINE KEEPING
ANYTHING TO HIMSELF.

356
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,500
MAN, FOR ALL HIS FAULTS,
THAT GUY SURE IS ONE OF A KIND.

357
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,958
I CAN SEE WHY
YOU'RE HUNG UP ON HIM.

358
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,166
- HUNG UP HOW?

359
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,958
- I JUST MEAN THEY CAN'T
STICK YOU IN A HOUSE

360
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,833
WITH THIS RIPPED YOUNG HOTTIE,

361
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,791
AND THEN TELL YOU THAT
YOU'RE BROTHER AND SISTER

362
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,916
AND EXPECT YOU
TO FEEL A FAMILY BOND.

363
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,083
OF COURSE, YOU'RE GONNA THINK
ABOUT DOING THE NASTY.

364
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,333
- ( she gasps )

365
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,666
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I'M NOT THINKING THAT!

366
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,500
WHY WOULD I THINK THAT
ABOUT MY BROTHER?

367
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,083
BESIDES, EVEN IF
WE WEREN'T RELATED,

368
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:53,958
I THINK HE LIKES SOMEBODY.

369
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:55,416
AND EVEN IF WE
WEREN'T AND HE DIDN'T,

370
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,791
I DON'T LIKE HIM LIKE
THAT, SO WHATEVER!

371
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,458
ON A TOTALLY UNRELATED NOTE,

372
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,583
COULD I MAYBE GET THE TWO OF
YOU TO GO SHOPPING WITH ME

373
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,500
SOMETIME IN THE NEAR FUTURE?

374
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,208
- SURE THING.
SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

375
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:07,958
- SHOPPING? FOR WHAT?

376
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,291
- UH, SOME BRAS?

377
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,833
- COUNT ME IN!

378
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:14,416
YOU'LL BE THE SEXIEST THING
ON TWO FEET WHEN WE'RE DONE.

379
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,333
- I WAS THINKING, SIMPLE.

380
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:19,541
- SHE DOESN'T NEED A SEXY BRA,
JUST ONE THAT FITS HER.

381
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:20,708
I MEAN LOOK AT THEM.

382
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:21,833
- SAY WHAT?

383
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,250
WHO DO YOU THINK SHE'S
GONNA TRUST MORE

384
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:27,083
WHEN IT COMES TO BRAS?
THE LESBIAN OR THE FLAT GIRL?

385
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,791
- PLEASE JUST LET IT GO!

386
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,125
PEOPLE ARE WATCHING.

387
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,166
I COULD GO SHOPPING WITH HIM.

388
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,875
BUT HE'S TOO MUCH OF A PERVERT.

389
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:37,083
IT'D NEVER WORK OUT.

390
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:44,791
- THE GUY ON THE PLANE.

391
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,458
I'VE SEEN HIM BEFORE.

392
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:51,791
- ( door opening )

393
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,250
- OH! SOMEBODY BEAT ME
TO THE PUNCH.

394
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,625
THIS IS MY FAVORITE SPOT
ON THE CAMPUS.

395
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,083
WELL, SO MUCH FOR HAVING
IT ALL TO MYSELF, I GUESS.

396
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,000
HUH.

397
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:06,791
CALL ME CRAZY, BUT I FEEL LIKE
I'VE SEEN YOU SOMEWHERE BEFORE.

398
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:10,166
NOT JUST IN PASSING, MIND YOU.
LIKE, I KNOW YOU FROM SOMEWHERE.

399
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,958
I DON'T GUESS
THE FEELING IS MUTUAL?

400
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:14,875
- LOOK, PAL. I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GOING ON ABOUT, OKAY?

401
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,625
MAYBE YOU GOT ME
CONFUSED WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

402
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,791
- AH! I REMEMBER!

403
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:22,791
THE NEW GUY, AKATSUKI
OUSAWA, THAT RIGHT?

404
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,208
- YEAH, WHAT'S IT TO YOU?

405
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:25,958
- ( he chuckles )
- FUNNY GUY.

406
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,208
YOU KNOW YOU'RE ALL ANYONE
CAN TALK ABOUT LATELY.

407
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,333
I READ UP ON YOUR LITTLE BRUSH
WITH THE STUDENT COUNCIL

408
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:32,791
IN THE SCHOOL PAPER.

409
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,208
PUT HER THERE!
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

410
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:41,083
- SO, YOU KINDA FAIL AT
SHAKING HANDS THERE, BLONDIE.

411
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,416
- ( theme music playing )

412
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,958
- ( singing in Japanese )

413
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:21,041
- Listy: FOR REASONS I CAN'T
BEGIN TO FATHOM,

414
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:23,208
AKATSUKI IS POPULAR
WITH THE GIRLS.

415
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:24,541
HE DEFENDED A BROTHEL ONCE,

416
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:26,125
AND ENDED UP ON
VERY FRIENDLY TERMS

417
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,791
WITH THE LADIES
PLYING THEIR TRADE.

418
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:30,916
NOT ONLY DID THAT DUNDERHEAD
HAVE THE GALL TO HELP THEM

419
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,333
PICK OUT THEIR UNDERTHINGS,

420
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:33,666
BUT HE'D LEND A READY HAND

421
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,750
WHEN THEY NEEDED HELP
GETTING INTO THEM.

422
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:38,166
JUST THINKING ABOUT IT
SETS MY BLOOD ABOIL.

423
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,875
I REALLY HOPE HE
GETS HIS COMEUPPANCE.

424
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:43,750
NEXT EPISODE,
"JUST A SHORT REPOSE".

425
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:45,000
AND I ALWAYS DRESSED MYSELF,

426
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:46,958
IN CASE THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING.
