1
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:11,375
- AH! I REMEMBER! THE NEW GUY,
AKATSUKI OUSAWA, THAT RIGHT?

2
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:13,583
I READ UP ON YOUR LITTLE BRUSH
WITH THE STUDENT COUNCIL

3
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:15,750
IN THE SCHOOL PAPER!

4
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:18,041
SO, PUT HER THERE!
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

5
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:24,416
- SO YOU KINDA FAIL AT SHAKING
HANDS THERE, BLONDIE.

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,375
- DON'T BE THAT WAY, BRO. BY
THE WAY, I'M LIKING THE STYLE.

7
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:29,875
YOU'RE A GUY WHO
CAN THINK ON HIS FEET!

8
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:32,083
- SORT OF MY SPECIALTY, BRO.

9
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,833
- ( both grunting )

10
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:45,250
- WOW! TIME OUT. WE'RE COOL!

11
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:47,375
I REALLY DID JUST WANT
TO INTRODUCE MYSELF.

12
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:50,333
I WASN'T LOOKING FOR A FIGHT.

13
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:53,000
- I'M SURE YOU WEREN'T.
SO WHAT WILL IT BE?

14
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:55,291
WANNA KEEP THIS INTRODUCTION
GOING FOR A WHILE?

15
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:57,208
- SEEING AS I'M NOT
A BIG FAN OF PAIN,

16
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,291
THINK I'LL TAKE A
RAIN CHECK ON THAT.

17
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:07,750
LINKED ENERGY
MANIPULATION. NICE.

18
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:11,791
SEEMS LIKE THAT COULD COME
IN REALLY HANDY TO SOMEONE.

19
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:13,541
- NOT MAKING MUCH
SENSE THERE, BUDDY.

20
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:16,708
- CHECK IT. YOU AND ME ARE
TOTALLY HANGING ON MONDAY.

21
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:18,958
THERE'S SOMEONE I GOTTA
GET YOU ON FIRST NAMES WITH.

22
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:20,958
- I'LL THINK ABOUT IT,
BUT FIRST OF ALL,

23
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:22,916
MIGHT BE NICE IF I
KNEW WHO YOU WERE.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,458
- RIGHT. MY BAD.

25
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:27,125
I'M WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL
BABEL'S OFFICIAL OUTCAST.

26
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:29,666
MOTOHARU KAIDOU. WORD UP!

27
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:36,083
- ( theme song playing )

28
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:37,583
- ( singing in Japanese )

29
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,708
- NICE TO SEE YOU'RE GETTING
THE HANG OF HOW STUFF WORKS

30
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:15,750
IN THIS WORLD, LITTLE SIS.

31
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,333
- DON'T PATRONIZE.

32
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:20,833
IT'S NOT LIKE THIS IS ROCKET
SURGERY OR ANYTHING.

33
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:23,708
- AH OF COURSE. AND
AUTOMATIC DOORS ARE A BREEZE.

34
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,958
- THAT WAS LOW.

35
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,333
- DON'T SWEAT IT. BABY STEPS.

36
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,000
OH, YEAH! THAT REMINDS ME.

37
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,583
YOU, UH, SAID YOU NEED
NEW UNMENTIONABLES?

38
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:39,541
- OH, YEAH, I DO. SORT OF.

39
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:42,208
YOUR SISTER'S THINGS ARE
A LITTLE TOO SNUG FOR ME.

40
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,833
- SWEET! I GET
TO INTRODUCE YOU

41
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,958
TO THE PLEASURES
OF MALL-CRAWLING.

42
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:51,750
- WAIT. MALL WHAT?
I DON'T GET IT.

43
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:58,583
OH! MY! GOODNESS!

44
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,416
EVERYTHING'S UNDER ONE ROOF?

45
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,583
- NO OFFENSE, BUT YOU'RE
EASILY IMPRESSED.

46
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,125
FOR SHEER SIZE AND VARIETY,

47
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:09,041
THE ONES DOWNTOWN BLOW THIS
LEMONADE STAND OUT OF THE WATER.

48
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,291
- YOU KNOW, IF THE WHOLE IDEA IS
TO JUMP-START HER MEMORY,

49
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:14,000
I'M SURPRISED YOU HAVEN'T LET
HER LOOSE IN HERE BEFORE NOW.

50
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,500
I MEAN, THIS IS THE SORT OF
THING A GIRL DOES QUITE A BIT OF

51
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,000
WHEN SHE'S YOUNGER,

52
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,125
SO IT'S BOUND TO HELP HER RECALL
LIFE BEFORE YOU-KNOW-WHAT.

53
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:21,916
- YEAH, TYPICAL GUY.

54
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,541
I UNDERESTIMATED THE APPEAL
OF CLOTHES SHOPPING.

55
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,166
I'VE REALLY GOT TO
GET YOU OUT MORE.

56
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,916
- NAH, IT'S OKAY.
I DON'T WANNA BE A PAIN.

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,208
- MIU, PLEASE.
YOU'RE KILLIN' ME HERE.

58
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:32,833
YOU DO NOT SAY NO TO THIS.

59
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,541
IF A MAN WANTS TO BUY YOU
THINGS, YOU TAKE HIM UP ON IT.

60
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,541
- SPOKEN LIKE A BOUTIQUE SAGE.

61
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,166
POINT IS, IF WE'RE
GONNA GET YOU BACK...

62
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,250
- ( thinking ) HE'S BEEN GOOD
ABOUT TAKING CARE OF ME SO FAR,

63
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:42,500
I GUESS.

64
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,416
BUT STILL, I DON'T KNOW.

65
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,458
- ...THIS IS WHAT FAMILY DOES.

66
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,791
- IF IT GETS YOU CLOSER
TO THE LIFE I THINK YOU DESERVE,

67
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,375
THEN I'M ALL FOR IT.

68
00:04:58,208 --> 00:04:59,333
- THIS ISN'T FAIR.

69
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,875
- WHAT'S UP? IS
ANYTHING WRONG, MIU?

70
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:04,166
- NO, NO. JUST
THINKING OUT LOUD.

71
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:10,875
LOOK AT HIM BEING
ALL SUPPORTIVE.

72
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:14,166
WHAT IF HE'S ONLY DOING
IT SO I DON'T HAVE AN OUT?

73
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,291
- I'M NOT LOOKING
FORWARD TO THE PHASE

74
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,791
WHEN I HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
FITTING INTO STUFF LIKE THIS.

75
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,250
- HUH?
- SHE MEANS HAVING BOOBS.

76
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,333
- OH.

77
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,833
- Kuzuha: I DON'T
MEAN TO BE CREEPY,

78
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,125
BUT YOURS DON'T SEEM TO WANNA
FIT INTO YOUR OLD CLOTHES.

79
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:29,291
- Miu: UH, WELL, YOU KNOW.

80
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,208
PUBERTY'S HIT ME
WITH A VENGEANCE.

81
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,833
MAYBE 'CUZ I DRINK MILK
LIKE IT'S GOING OUT OF STYLE.

82
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:34,958
( laughing sheepishly )

83
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,666
- AH. THERE WE GO.
THE PROMISED LAND.

84
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,625
ALL RIGHT. SINCE WE
DON'T KNOW YOUR SIZE,

85
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,875
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU FELT UP
BY ONE OF THE GALS ON STAFF

86
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,291
SO WE KNOW WHAT
WE'RE WORKING WITH.

87
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,625
- BEFORE WE DO THAT,
THIS WOULD BE AN IDEAL TIME

88
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:53,416
FOR YOU TO FIND
SOMETHING ELSE TO DO.

89
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,458
- OH, NOT COOL FOR ME TO HANG?

90
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:58,041
- WELL, UH, IT MIGHT BE
A LITTLE AWKWARD, YEAH.

91
00:05:58,541 --> 00:05:59,583
- SIS?

92
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,208
- ( gasping )

93
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,708
- DO YOU THINK YOU CAN HANDLE
THIS IF I BUZZ OFF FOR A WHILE?

94
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,166
- I DON'T WANT YOU TO LEAVE.

95
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,083
- WELL, YOU HEARD THE LADY,
I'M STICKING AROUND.

96
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,791
BESIDES, YOU MIGHT
NEED MY FASHION SENSE

97
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,166
IN CASE YOU HIT ANY SNAGS.

98
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,583
I WAS A BOUNCER ONCE FOR
THIS SUPER HIGH-END BROTHEL

99
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:23,750
ON THE OTHER SIDE,

100
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,250
SO I'M NOT BAD AT
THIS STUFF, ACTUALLY.

101
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:26,500
THE GIRLS THERE USED TO SHOW OFF

102
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,250
THEIR GET-UPS FOR
ME ALL THE TIME.

103
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:31,125
SAID THEY VALUED MY OPINION.

104
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,750
- (thinking ) SHARE THAT
A LITTLE LOUDER NEXT TIME.

105
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,875
NOT EVERYONE IN THE STORE HEARD.

106
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,458
- Woman: VOILA. WE'VE GOT
YOUR MEASUREMENTS.

107
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,916
NOW JUST GIVE ME A FEW MINUTES
TO SCROUNGE UP SOME SAMPLES

108
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,500
AND WE'LL GET STARTED.

109
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,583
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT
WOULD LOOK ADORABLE ON YOU.

110
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:47,541
- OH. THANKS, I APPRECIATE IT.

111
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:51,583
( sighs )

112
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,916
MAYBE I'M PARANOID,

113
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,708
BUT IT FEELS LIKE THESE THINGS
ARE GETTING OUT OF CONTROL.

114
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:05,166
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

115
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,458
- I'M COMING IN.
- OH, OKAY.

116
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:11,500
- UM, THESE SEEM LIKE THEY
MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIG FOR ME.

117
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,708
- AND, A COUPLE OF THESE
DESIGNS ARE A BIT LOUD

118
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:14,583
FOR MY TASTE, SO...

119
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,000
- DON'T YOU WORRY, SWEET PEA,

120
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,208
I KNOW JUST WHAT DRIVES
ALL THE MEN CRAZY.

121
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,375
YOUR BOYFRIEND IS GONNA FLIP!

122
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,500
- WHOA, WHOA! IF YOU
MEAN THE GUY OUT THERE,

123
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,041
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT!

124
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,958
- OH, I THINK I GET
THE PICTURE, HON.

125
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,541
HASN'T MADE A MOVE YET, HUH?

126
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:30,500
WELL, ALL THE MORE REASON TO TRY
A FEW OF THESE LITTLE HELPERS!

127
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,666
SERIOUSLY, A GIRL WITH
A FRACTION OF YOUR LOOKS

128
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,833
AND THIS KIND OF LIFT

129
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:36,166
WOULD BE BEATEN THEM
OFF WITH BOTH HANDS!

130
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,791
- ( whimpers )

131
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,083
- DON'T WORRY, IT'S FINE.

132
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,708
NO SHAME IN EMBRACING YOUR
GENETIC ADVANTAGES.

133
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,708
TELL YOU WHAT, I DON'T
WANNA OVERLOAD YOU,

134
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,708
SO LET'S JUST FOCUS ON
GETTING YOU IN ONE

135
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:48,375
AND THEN WE'LL TALK STYLE, OKAY?

136
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:51,583
- IS IT THAT HARD
TO GET INTO ONE?

137
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,791
- AFTER YOU'VE GOT THE
STRAPS OVER YOUR SHOULDERS,

138
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,458
LEAN FORWARD EVER SO SLIGHTLY

139
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,083
AND MOVE THE CUPS AROUND
TILL YOU'VE FILLED THEM OUT.

140
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,916
NEXT YOU CLASP THE HOOKS.

141
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,708
THEN WE STAND UP STRAIGHT
AND ADJUST THE STRAPS LIKE SO.

142
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,250
NOW COMES THE TACTICAL PART.

143
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,291
WHILE ONE HAND HOLDS
THE CUP IN PLACE,

144
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,375
THE OTHER HAND DOES SOME
TUCKING AND SHIFTING,

145
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,166
AND THEN WE HIKE THE GOODS UP.

146
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,583
THINK OF IT LIKE
MAKING A PASTRY.

147
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,166
LAST BUT NOT LEAST,

148
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:21,291
PULL THE BAND BELOW THE SHOULDER
BLADES AND YOU'RE GOOD TO GO.

149
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,416
- UH, YEAH. I DON'T REALLY
THINK I'M COMFORTABLE

150
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,958
WITH THEM POKING UP LIKE THIS.

151
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:27,125
- OH, HONEY BUN, YOU'RE
JUST TOO ADORABLE.

152
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,458
BELIEVE ME, I'VE GOT STYLES
OUT THERE THAT SQUEEZE YOU

153
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:30,500
LIKE A TORTURE DEVICE.

154
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:31,458
- THIS ONE IS NOTHING.

155
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,833
- WHAT? WHY WOULD YOU WEAR THAT?

156
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:36,000
- OH IT'S ADORABLE!
- AWW!

157
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,666
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

158
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,250
- I WONDER IF THIS WOULD
REALLY MAKE HIM FLIP

159
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,916
OR IF SHE WAS JUST SAYING THAT.

160
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,666
WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?

161
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,833
HEY, HOW DO YOU
GET THIS THING OFF?

162
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:57,875
- ( ripping )

163
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,583
- Akatsuki: UH-OH, PARTY FOUL.

164
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,458
HEY.

165
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,125
- ( Miu screaming )

166
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,916
- THANK GOODNESS NO
ONE SAW YOU COME IN.

167
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,541
UGH! HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
UP THERE WATCHING ME?

168
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,541
- I GAVE YOU THE OPTION
TO SHOO ME AWAY.

169
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,625
- I DIDN'T WANT TO
BE HERE ALONE!

170
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:29,125
- CALM DOWN. THE REAL ISSUE
IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO

171
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,208
ABOUT YOUR WARDROBE MALFUNCTION.

172
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:35,000
- YEAH. HOW DO I HANDLE THIS?

173
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:37,041
- JUST BE HONEST AND 'FESS UP.

174
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,708
THEY'LL PROBABLY MAKE
YOU PAY FOR IT.

175
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:39,791
- HOW MUCH?

176
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,166
- THAT'S A LOT OF
MONEY, ISN'T IT?

177
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,000
- JUST CHECKING IN. IF YOU
NEED ANYTHING, HON,

178
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,083
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS ASK, OKEY-DOKEY?

179
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,833
- OH, NO! IF SHE
SEES YOU IN HERE,

180
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:52,000
SHE'S GOING TO THINK
WE'RE DOING SOMETHING!

181
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:55,166
- AW, COME ON. MAYBE SHE'LL
THINK I GOT LOST ON MY WAY OUT.

182
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,875
- HIDE OR YOU DIE!

183
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,416
- FINE! SHOW ME
WHERE AND I'M ON IT.

184
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,541
- STOP BEING DIFFICULT!
- Woman: SWEET PEA?

185
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,416
I'M COMING IN, ALL RIGHT?

186
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:18,208
SWEET PEA?
I'M COMING IN, ALL RIGHT?

187
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:25,666
OH, DEAR. THE IDEA IS TO TRY OUT
SEVERAL, NOT GET COZY WITH ONE.

188
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,125
- OH, REALLY? I, UH...

189
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,750
- WE FEELING BASHFUL?

190
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:34,750
- UM, KINDA? YEAH. I NEED A
LITTLE MORE TIME, THAT'S ALL.

191
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,250
- FOR THE RECORD, I HAVE THE
SAME EQUIPMENT AS YOU DO, DEAR.

192
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,166
- SHE'S GOT YA PAINTED
INTO A CORNER.

193
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,416
PROB'LY BETTER TAKE
YOUR MEDICINE.

194
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,750
LOOK, I KNOW YOUR BACKGROUND
MAKES THIS HARD FOR YOU.

195
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,666
YOU WERE A PRINCESS IN ALAYZARD.

196
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,916
OF THE DARK CLAN, NO LESS.

197
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,916
I'M GUESSING IT'S A SAFE BET
NOBODY EVER TAUGHT YOU

198
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,166
HOW TO NAVIGATE
BEING IN THE WRONG.

199
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:59,708
THAT WAS YOUR OLD LIFE. IN THIS
WORLD, YOU'RE MY LITTLE SISTER.

200
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:02,791
WHICH MEANS EVERY NOW AND AGAIN,
YOU'RE GONNA GET IT WRONG.

201
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:06,625
WHEN YOU GET IT WRONG, YOU
OWN UP TO THE FACT. PERIOD.

202
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,750
WELL? THIS WOULD BE THE
TIME TO SAY SOMETHING.

203
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,958
- Chikage: HEY, MIU.
YOU IN THERE?

204
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:14,083
- Kuzuha: IT'S US.
MIND IF WE JOIN YOU?

205
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,083
- I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S
BEEN GOING ON IN HERE,

206
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,875
BUT I DON'T LIKE IT ONE BIT!

207
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,875
THE LADIES' FITTING ROOMS
ARE FOR LADIES, MISTER!

208
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,458
- MIU, IF THIS IT TOO MUCH
FOR YOU, WE CAN GO.

209
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,333
- CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT
ALL THIS RACKET IS ALL ABOUT!

210
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,083
- OH, HEY, WHAT'RE
YOU DOING HERE?

211
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:30,416
- YOU MUST BE KIDDING ME.

212
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,875
YOU PERVERT! WHAT
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

213
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,583
- WELL YOU'RE THE ONE DRESSED
LIKE A CENTERFOLD MODEL.

214
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:36,625
- ( gasps )

215
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,791
- WOULD YOU MIND
COMING OVER HERE,

216
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,000
IF IT ISN'T TOO MUCH TROUBLE?

217
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,833
- SURE.

218
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,541
- IT'S JUST, WHEN I ASKED FOR
UNDERGARMENTS

219
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,916
THAT ARE HARD TO REMOVE
THIS ISN'T WHAT I HAD IN MIND.

220
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,583
- BUT MA'AM, THE ONES YOU'VE GOT
ON ARE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED

221
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,875
TO KEEP EVEN THE MOST
NIMBLE-FINGERED DON JUAN

222
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,000
BUSY FOR HOURS.

223
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,583
- I SPEAK FROM EXPERIENCE.

224
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:02,250
- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, MADAM,
I LOOK LIKE A STREET WALKER!

225
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:05,083
- YES. VERY FLATTERING ON YOU.
- I'M NOT WEARING THIS...

226
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,083
- DO I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?

227
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,291
- Woman: OH, DON'T BE SHY.

228
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,083
- YOU'RE GONNA DO WHAT
NEEDS DOING, RIGHT?

229
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,375
- ...SLIPPING INTO THAT?

230
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,583
- AND THAT'S WHY
YOU MAKE ME PROUD.

231
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:18,083
TRUTH IS, THOUGH, THIS WHOLE BRA
DEBACLE ISN'T ENTIRELY ON YOU.

232
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:22,583
SO HOW'RE WE GOING
TO APPROACH THIS?

233
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:25,333
UH, EXCUSE ME, MISS? SORRY
TO GATE-CRASH THE PARTY,

234
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:26,708
BUT WE NEED YOU.

235
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,583
MY LITTLE SIS KNOWS SHE
WANTS TO BUY SOMETHING

236
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,666
FROM THIS FINE ESTABLISHMENT.

237
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,333
THING IS, THOUGH, THE
BRAS YOU GAVE HER DON'T FIT.

238
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,416
- NOT POSSIBLE.

239
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,041
MIND YOU, I DON'T MEAN
TO BE RUDE, SIR,

240
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,375
BUT I DID TAKE HER
MEASUREMENTS MYSELF...

241
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,583
- YOU NEED TO TAKE
HER UP THREE SIZES.

242
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:42,916
- YOUNG MAN, I WILL
HAVE YOU KNOW

243
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,333
I'VE BEEN FITTING
LADIES FOR BRAS

244
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,166
SINCE BEFORE YOU'D EVER
SEEN ONE IN PERSON.

245
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,958
I WOULD HARDLY BE OFF BY THREE
SIZES FOR CRYING OUT LOUD,

246
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,708
A NEWBIE WOULDN'T
MAKE A GAFFE LIKE THAT!

247
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:53,583
- NO ONE'S SAYING THIS IS
ON YOU. INDULGE ME, PLEASE.

248
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:56,166
EVEN A SEASONED EXPERT
CAN BE SURPRISED, EH?

249
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,833
- I REALLY HOPE YOU'RE NOT
JUST SENDING HER AWAY

250
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,000
SO YOU CAN JUST TEAR OFF

251
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,833
AND MAKE US ALL
ACCESSORIES TO VANDALISM.

252
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,875
- HAVE A LITTLE FAITH, OKAY?

253
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:08,333
NOW, TURN YOUR BACK
TOWARD ME IF YOU WOULD.

254
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:12,333
- OH, AS IF! I'M FAMILIAR
WITH THAT LOOK.

255
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,583
THE SECOND I TURN AROUND YOU'RE
GOING TO PUSH MY BUTTONS

256
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:15,833
AND DO SOMETHING NAUGHTY.

257
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,250
- COME ON, DON'T BE THIS WAY.

258
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,250
I'M JUST GONNA ENHANCE
YOUR LUSCIOUS LITTLE BOD

259
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,500
WITH A TOUCH OF
ENERGY MANIPULATION.

260
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,833
NO FUNNY BUSINESS. I SWEAR.

261
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:33,791
- OKAY.

262
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:36,166
- ALL RIGHTY, THEN.
LET'S GET YOU LOOSENED UP.

263
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:39,958
- ( moans )

264
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,208
- DON'T PUT UP ANY RESISTANCE.

265
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,875
- ( cracking )

266
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,166
- Woman: HERE YOU GO.

267
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,208
- OKAY. READY TO SQUEEZE
YOU INTO THIS THING

268
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,458
WHENEVER YOU'RE FEELING IT.

269
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,208
- ARE YOU SURE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

270
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:03,041
- TRUST ME ON THIS, BABE.
I'M A BIT OF AN EXPERT.

271
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,291
BACK IN MY BROTHEL DAYS,

272
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:07,208
THE GIRLS OFTEN NEEDED
AN EXTRA PAIR OF HANDS.

273
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:10,083
THEY DON'T TRUST THEIR
BODIES TO JUST ANYONE.

274
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,375
SOUNDS COUNTER-INTUITIVE,
I KNOW. BUT THINK ABOUT IT.

275
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,250
IF THEY EXPECT TO MAKE RENT,

276
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,833
THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO LET
THEIR GOODS GET BRUISED

277
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:19,000
BY SOME HAM FISTED
TOMMY TIGHT FLY, OH NO.

278
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,291
OF COURSE, EVERY
NOW AND THEN

279
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,333
THEY ENJOYED MY ATTENTIONS
A BIT TOO MUCH,

280
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,750
SURE, BUT WHAT'RE YOU GONNA DO?

281
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:27,125
- ( moans )

282
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,958
- THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKIN' ABOUT.

283
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,750
DO I OR DO I NOT KNOW HOW
TO STUFF SOME T INTO A B?

284
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,291
- YOU'VE GOT AN EYE, SIR.

285
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,500
NOT EVERY DAY THAT I'M
OUTDONE BY A MAN.

286
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,958
- I DO WHAT I CAN, MY LADY.

287
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,666
SO ABOUT THE SET YOU
BROUGHT IN HERE EARLIER.

288
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,041
I HATE TO KICK YOUR NEWFOUND
RESPECT FOR ME IN THE NUTS,

289
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:45,416
BUT I'M AFRAID WE KINDA, SORTA,
MAYBE BUSTED IT.

290
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,750
- HUH?

291
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:49,291
- I HAD A FEELING SOMETHING
LIKE THAT WAS UP.

292
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:50,833
DON'T WORRY ABOUT PAYING.

293
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,083
IT'S MY FAULT FOR BRINGING
THE WRONG SIZE TO BEGIN WITH.

294
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,875
GUESS IT'S JUST
ONE OF THOSE DAYS.

295
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:57,083
- WAIT, I CAN'T LET
YOU TAKE THE RAP.

296
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,791
THIS IS GONNA SOUND
A LITTLE WEIRD,

297
00:14:58,875 --> 00:14:59,958
BUT I MADE SOME
CHANGES TO HER

298
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:02,083
WHILE YOU WERE ON
THE SALES FLOOR.

299
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,541
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

300
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:06,166
- YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
THE GIRL'S GOT ISSUES.

301
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,458
WHEN SHE OVER THINKS THINGS
SHE GETS SUPER TENSE.

302
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:11,375
REALLY DOES A NUMBER ON
HOW SHE CARRIES HERSELF.

303
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,666
SEE, OUR BODIES
CONTRACT UNDER STRESS.

304
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,125
WHEN I HELPED HER LET GO OF
SOME OF THAT PENT-UP ENERGY,

305
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,166
SHE WENT UP A SIZE.

306
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,166
POOR THING'S ALSO SUPER
SELF-CONSCIOUS ABOUT HER TA-TAS.

307
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,041
MAKES HER SLOUCH
SOMETHING AWFUL.

308
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,750
SO I MADE HER RAM-ROD
THE OLD SPINE

309
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,666
TO TAKE HER UP ANOTHER SIZE.

310
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,250
- WHY THE THIRD SIZE?

311
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:29,416
- THAT'D BE A TRADE SECRET.

312
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,541
I'D TELL YOU, BUT I'D
HAVE TO KILL YOU.

313
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:31,875
- A LITTLE HELP, PLEASE.

314
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,791
OR WOULD YOU PREFER I TAKE
MY BUSINESS ELSEWHERE?

315
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,958
- SORRY, MA'AM. ONE MOMENT.

316
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,875
- ANYWAY. SO YEAH,
THAT'S THE LOW-DOWN.

317
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,083
YOU SEEM LIKE A NICE LADY,

318
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,958
SO I DIDN'T WANT ANYONE
PINNING THIS ON YOU.

319
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,958
THIS WAS MY SCREW-UP,
PLAIN AND SIMPLE.

320
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,833
IF IT'S STORE POLICY
FOR CUSTOMERS

321
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,833
TO PONY UP ON
DAMAGED MERCHANDISE,

322
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,833
I'LL TAKE THE HIT. NO BIG DEAL.

323
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,750
ALL I ASK IS THAT YOU
TAKE CARE OF MY SISTER

324
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,291
NEXT TIME SHE COMES IN.

325
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:55,041
- DON'T LISTEN TO HIM, HE'S
LYING! I'M THE ONE WHO TORE IT.

326
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,708
IT SHOULD BE ME WHO
FESSES UP AND PAYS

327
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,125
OR WHATEVER IT IS
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO

328
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,666
TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT,
NOT HIM! OKAY?

329
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,000
- BUT I THOUGHT...

330
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,791
- LOOK, IT WASN'T THAT I DIDN'T
WANNA COME CLEAN.

331
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:07,083
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT.

332
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,250
I DIDN'T WANNA LOOK
LIKE A STUPID BRAT.

333
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:10,291
( sobbing )

334
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:16,333
- MIU, YOU'RE SUCH AN
ADORABLE MESS. LISTEN TO ME.

335
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:19,041
HERE, IN THIS WORLD, NO MATTER
WHAT HAPPENS, YOU AND ME,

336
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:19,958
WE'RE IN IT TOGETHER.

337
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,416
THAT'S THE WHOLE
POINT OF FAMILY,

338
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,291
SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
GONNA DO, OKAY?

339
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:27,166
JUST KNOW, WHENEVER THE
RIGHT THING TO DO IS HARD,

340
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,458
BIG BRO'S GOT YOUR BACK.

341
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:32,208
- TALK ABOUT YOUR 180. A MINUTE
AGO HE WAS YANKING HER MANGOS,

342
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,166
NOW HE'S BEING ALL SENTIMENTAL.

343
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,166
- WELL, I FOR ONE THINK
IT'S RATHER SWEET.

344
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,041
A LITTLE ODD THAT IT'S TAKING
PLACE IN THE FITTING ROOM

345
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,666
OF A LINGERIE SHOP WHILE MIU
IS STANDING HERE HALF-NAKED,

346
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,500
MAYBE, BUT WHATEVER.

347
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,000
- AH! FANTASTIC!

348
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:49,333
YOU LOOK GREAT! IT'S THE
HOTTEST THING RIGHT NOW.

349
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:52,291
FABRIC THAT GOES TRANSPARENT AS
YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE RISES!

350
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:53,458
SUPER TRENDY!

351
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,875
( screaming )

352
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:59,083
- I'VE HAD QUITE ENOUGH!
YOUR NERVE ASTOUNDS ME.

353
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:02,041
UGH! OUSAWA,
HAVE YOU NO DECENCY?

354
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,291
- I'M THINKING THIS
WOULD BE A GOOD TIME

355
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:04,583
FOR US TO WAIT OUTSIDE.

356
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:05,666
- YEAH, SURE.

357
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,208
- NOT SO FAST, GIRLS.
YOU'RE UP NEXT.

358
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:09,958
- WHEN THE HECK DID
YOU GO GET THOSE?

359
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,041
- CLEARLY THAT WHOLE SPIEL

360
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,041
ABOUT YOU NOT USING
MAGIC WAS CRAP.

361
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,625
- ( scoffs ) LET THIS
BE A LESSON TO YOU

362
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,083
NEVER TO LET YOUR GUARD DOWN.

363
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:18,541
WE LADIES MUST BE EVER
CAUTIOUS OF OUR VIRTUE.

364
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:21,250
- ACTUALLY I WAS HOPING
YOU COULD JOIN US.

365
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,916
- ( screaming )

366
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,333
- SORRY, LADIES. SIS IS
IN TEARS. SHE'S MORTIFIED.

367
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,125
UNLESS YOU CAN STEP UP AND
SHOW HER THERE'S NOTHING

368
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,916
TO BE EMBARRASSED ABOUT,
SHE'S LIKELY TO AVOID YOU.

369
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,250
FROM THIS MOMENT FORWARD,

370
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:40,416
THE THREE OF YOU WILL BECOME
THE BOOB ALLIANCE!

371
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,083
- ( all whimpering )

372
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,416
- Miu: WANNA KNOW WHAT
MORTIFIES ME MOST?

373
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,458
THE FACT THAT MY BROTHER
KNOWS MORE ABOUT BOOBS

374
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,708
THAN HE HAS ANY RIGHT TO!

375
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,625
- ANY CLUE WHAT YOU'RE DOING FOR
THE RANKING MATCHES THIS WEEK

376
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,333
OR YOU PLAYING IT BY EAR?

377
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:01,333
- HMM? UH, COME AGAIN?
- YOU'RE SUCH A DOOFUS.

378
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:02,916
DOES IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU

379
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,541
THAT THE REASON OUR TEACHERS GO
TO THE TROUBLE OF LECTURING US

380
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,416
IS BECAUSE ONCE IN A WHILE
WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY

381
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,208
IS ACTUALLY WORTH TAKING IN?

382
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:11,083
AFTER THE WRITTEN EXAMS NEXT
WEEK, THERE'S A BIG COMBAT EXAM

383
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,291
ALL THE CLASSES ARE
SUPPOSED TO PARTICIPATE IN.

384
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,208
HOW YOU HANDLE YOURSELF
DETERMINES WHAT LEVEL

385
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:17,250
THEY BUMP YOU TO NEXT YEAR.

386
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:18,708
- OH. COME TO THINK OF IT,

387
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,666
I DO REMEMBER HEARING
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.

388
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,666
ANY SPECIAL REASON
YOU BRING IT UP?

389
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,166
- WELL, IF WE'RE GOING TO FORM
TEAMS LIKE WE'RE ENCOURAGED TO,

390
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,291
WE'D BETTER START
THINKING ALONG THOSE LINES.

391
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,125
- THEY TOLD US WE CAN PICK
WHOEVER WE WANT,

392
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,500
JUST THAT NO TEAM'S SUPPOSED
TO EXCEED FOUR PEOPLE.

393
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,666
OTHERWISE IT'D BE UNFAIR
TO EVERYBODY ELSE.

394
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,208
OF COURSE, THERE'S A REASON FOUR
HAPPENS TO BE THE MAGIC NUMBER.

395
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:39,125
- AH, BECAUSE THAT STACKS UP
NICE WITH THE STUDENT COUNCIL.

396
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,750
- YEP. YOU GOT IT.

397
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,708
- SO, WHAT'RE YOU
PLANNING TO DO?

398
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,458
- NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT ME.
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS GONNA DO?

399
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,833
- WELL, WE TALKED IT OVER
AND WE DECIDED THAT

400
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,625
THE THREE OF US OUGHTA
COMBINE FORCES FOR THE DAY.

401
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:50,583
- YEAH?

402
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:51,708
- BUT THEN WE STARTED THINKING

403
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,375
MAYBE THREE WOULDN'T
REALLY BE ENOUGH.

404
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,333
I MEAN GO BIG OR GO HOME, RIGHT?

405
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:58,583
ANYWAY, THE POINT IS WE DECIDED
YOU SHOULD JOIN UP WITH US, TOO.

406
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:01,041
- HOLD ON A SEC. YOU
WANT ME ON YOUR TEAM?

407
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,333
- HEY! DON'T GET ALL WEIRD.
IT'S NOT LIKE WE NEED YOU,

408
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:05,791
WE'RE NOT FALLING ALL OVER
OURSELVES TO HAVE YOU ON BOARD.

409
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,083
WE JUST THOUGHT

410
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,416
SINCE YOU OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T
HAVE A BACKUP PLAN,

411
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,791
WE'D SAVE YOU FROM YOURSELF.

412
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,708
- I GUESS I COULD. SURE,
I DON'T SEE WHY NOT.

413
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,833
- SERIOUSLY?

414
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,625
( gasps )

415
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,666
UH, I MEAN, WISE CHOICE.

416
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,791
- YEAH. FOR YOU NOT FOR US.
WE WERE COOL EITHER WAY.

417
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:22,833
- ( both giggling )

418
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,916
- HEY, SO THANKS.

419
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,875
YOU GUYS WERE REAL SPORTS
TO TAG ALONG LIKE THIS.

420
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:34,833
- EH, IT'S COOL. HEY, AS A
MATTER OF FACT I ENJOYED IT.

421
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:37,375
- IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE
I GAVE MYSELF A DAY OFF.

422
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,166
LET'S DO IT AGAIN SOMETIME.

423
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,291
- CATCH YA LATER.

424
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:46,416
- SEE YA.

425
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:18,916
- ( door opens and closes )

426
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,416
- WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?

427
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,833
- UH. WELL, I...

428
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:29,083
JUST WANTED TO SHOW OFF
THE PAJAMAS YOU BOUGHT ME.

429
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,791
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

430
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:34,166
- OH. OKAY. TURN AROUND.
LET'S HAVE A PROPER LOOK AT YOU.

431
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,416
REAL NICE.

432
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,083
THE CUT SUITS YOU AND THE YELLOW
REALLY BRINGS OUT YOUR EYES.

433
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,166
- ( gasps ) YOU THINK SO?
THANK YOU!

434
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,375
I NEVER KNOW WHAT
I LOOK GOOD IN,

435
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,208
SO I'D HAVE NEVER PICKED
THESE UP FOR MYSELF.

436
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:46,500
LUCKY I'VE GOT YOU, HUH?

437
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:49,500
ANYWAY, I JUST WANTED
YOU TO SEE ME IN THEM.

438
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,958
- SERIOUSLY. YOU'RE TOO CUTE.
YOU'RE KILLING ME HERE.

439
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:57,916
- OH! THAT REMINDS ME!

440
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,958
THERE'S THIS SHOW ON TV
I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT.

441
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,875
THE WHOLE REASON I
CAME IN HERE, ACTUALLY.

442
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,458
- ( girls grunting )
- ( swords clanging )

443
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,625
- FUNNY, WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT
YOU'D BE INTO THIS KINDA THING.

444
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,500
- ( girl moans )

445
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,000
- ( gasps )

446
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,583
- DON'T SWEAT IT. NO JUDGMENT.

447
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,791
YOU'RE A YOUNG GIRL ON THE
THRESHOLD OF WOMANHOOD,

448
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:15,375
IT'S ONLY NATURAL YOU'D BE
CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT GOES ON

449
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:18,375
BETWEEN HOT LADY PIRATES
IN THE AFTER-DARK TIMESLOT.

450
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:20,458
- NO!

451
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,750
- Motoharu: SO, YOU IN OR OUT?

452
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,916
CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR
THIS BABY SING.

453
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,041
YOU'RE A FREAKING GENIUS, POPS.

454
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,041
OH, BY THE WAY.
GUESS I SHOULD

455
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:38,416
GIVE YOU THE NAME OF THE DUDE
I WANT RIDING THE THING.

456
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,583
IT'S OUSAWA. AKATSUKI OUSAWA.

457
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:48,666
- ( theme song playing )

458
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,916
- ( singing in Japanese )

459
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,625
- Listy: FOR SOME REASON
BEST KNOWN TO THEMSELVES,

460
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:22,291
THE FAIR FOLK OF ALAYZARD
NEVER ONCE SCOFFED AT THE CUR

461
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:24,416
FOR HIS INABILITY TO USE MAGIC.

462
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,250
THE MERMAIDS ESPECIALLY
SURPRISED ME.

463
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:27,791
I THOUGHT THEY'D BE MERCILESS.

464
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,708
THEIR DISDAIN FOR
MY PEOPLE IS LEGENDARY,

465
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:33,291
YET AKATSUKI NOT ONLY NEGOTIATED
AN HISTORIC TREATY BETWEEN US,

466
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:36,000
HE SECURED AN INVITATION
TO THEIR SACRED VILLAGE.

467
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,416
TO THIS DAY, THE MAN CARRIES
A KNIGHTHOOD BESTOWED ON HIM

468
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,958
BY THE MOST IMPLACABLE
CREATURES IN THE REALM.

469
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:43,625
NEXT EPISODE,
SUPERSONIC SLEIPNIR!

470
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:46,166
JUST ONCE, I'D LIKE TO SEE
HIM FALL ON HIS FACE.
