1
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:12,458
YOU MEAN TO BEST A HERO.
CAN YOU PROVE YOU'RE ABLE?

2
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:14,166
- ZECHS, NO!

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,916
- Phil: HE'S WELL WITHIN
HIS RIGHTS TO ASK ME.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,458
THIS MISSION IS IMPORTANT,

5
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:21,625
AND THUS IT'S IMPORTANT THAT
YOU ALL HAVE FAITH IN MY SKILLS.

6
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:23,416
THIS SHOULD GIVE YOU
AN IDEA.

7
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:33,416
WELL, NOW.
WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT?

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,416
IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE, I JUST
GAVE OFF AS MUCH BLOOD LUST

9
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,458
AS AN ENRAGED DRAGON KIN,

10
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:41,541
BUT IF ANY OF YOU STILL
HARBOR ANY DOUBTS ABOUT ME,

11
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,208
SAY THE WORD.

12
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:44,708
- Baram: YOU HAVE MADE
YOUR POINT, PHIL.

13
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:49,791
OUR ENEMY LIES BEYOND THE GATE.
SAVE YOUR STRENGTH.

14
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:52,375
- RIGHT YOU ARE,
MILORD. FAREWELL.

15
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:04,958
- AKATSUKI.

16
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:06,500
- ( theme song playing )

17
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:08,750
- ( singing in Japanese )

18
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,625
- Motoharu: HOW'S IT
HANGING, MAN?

19
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,208
YOU'RE NOT SWEATING THIS,
ARE YA?

20
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,500
- HEY. I'M SURPRISED
TO SEE YOU HERE.

21
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:48,916
- DON'T BE TOO SHOCKED, NOW.

22
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,541
TAKING PART IN THE RANKING
BATTLES IS MANDATORY.

23
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:53,583
I'M A STUDENT HERE,
JUST LIKE THE REST OF YOU.

24
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:54,916
- YEAH, I KNOW YOU ARE.

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,541
IT'S JUST WEIRD HOW I DIDN'T
SENSE YOUR PRESENCE

26
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:57,875
UNTIL A MOMENT AGO.

27
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,208
- GUESS I'M PART NINJA.

28
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:00,708
NOW LOOK,

29
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,000
I'M NOT TELLING YOU ANYTHING YOU
DON'T ALREADY KNOW, AKKI,

30
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,583
BUT SOME OF THESE
KNUCKLEHEADS ARE GONNA TRY

31
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,000
AND WHUP YOU FOR
THE STREET CRED.

32
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:06,541
SO YOU MIGHT WANNA
WATCH YOUR BACK.

33
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:07,916
- I HOPE THEY TRY IT!

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,500
EVERY CHALLENGER
I LEAVE IN THE DUST

35
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,500
IS ONE MORE NOTCH IN MY BELT.

36
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:13,583
I'M DEFINITELY NOT ABOVE
CRACKING SOME HEADS

37
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,750
TO MAKE IT INTO A CLASS.

38
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:18,041
SO, YOU GIVING ME
THE HEADS UP ABOUT THIS

39
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,083
BECAUSE YOU AND I
ARE ALL BUDDY-BUDDY,

40
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,916
OR YOU GOING FOR IT TOO?

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,458
- GOOD QUESTION. LET'S JUST
SAY I DON'T LIKE TO FIGHT

42
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,458
WHEN THE OUTCOME IS OBVIOUS.

43
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:29,083
- THAT'S A NON-ANSWER
IF EVER I HEARD ONE.

44
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,583
- YEAH, WELL UNLIKE A CERTAIN
SHOW-BOATER IN B CLASS,

45
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:34,500
I'M NOT THE SORT WHO LIKES
DRAWING ATTENTION TO MYSELF.

46
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:37,083
I'LL BE TAKING THIS
BATTLE ROYALE NICE AN' EASY.

47
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,666
- OH! I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU!

48
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,375
- SORRY, HE'S ALL YOURS!
DIDN'T MEAN TO BOGART YOUR BRO!

49
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,375
- YOU ARE A SLOWPOKE!

50
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:50,416
I'VE BEEN LOOKING ALL OVER,
MR. "OH, I'LL FIND YOU"!

51
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,791
- CHILL OUT.

52
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,583
WHY ARE YOU IN SUCH A PISSY
MOOD ALL OF A SUDDEN?

53
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,375
- SHE GETS A LOT OF UNSOLICITED
ATTENTION FROM THE OTHERS.

54
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:57,791
- HOW COME?

55
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:00,041
- WELL, SHE DID JUMP STRAIGHT
INTO CLASS B LIKE YOU,

56
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,083
WHICH IS A RELATIVELY
UNPRECEDENTED FEAT.

57
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,166
BUT MIU STANDS OUT
IN OTHER WAYS.

58
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:09,458
- IT'S NOT LIKE I WANT MY BOOBS
ON DISPLAY WHEN I WEAR THIS TOP!

59
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,208
- IT'S MORE THAN JUST
HER CHEST, THOUGH.

60
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,041
THE BOYS REALLY
DIG HER LOOKS.

61
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:16,208
ACCORDING TO THEM,
MIU HERE IS THE WHOLE ENCHILADA.

62
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:17,875
- YEAH? WHO WOULD'VE THUNK IT?

63
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,291
THEY'RE CERTAINLY NOT TRIPPING
OVER EACH OTHER TO CHAT HER UP.

64
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,250
- 'CAUSE THEY WANNA LIVE.

65
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,000
HER BIG BROTHER'S A BAD ASS.

66
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,000
NO ONE WANTS TO RISK
GETTING EFFED UP.

67
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:32,000
- THAT'S RIGHT, HORN DOGS.
JUST KEEP WALKING.

68
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:34,416
- GUESS THE ONLY FOLKS AT BABEL
WHO'VE GOT THE STONES

69
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,333
TO TANGLE WITH YOU ARE A COUPLE
OF THE OTHER KIDS FROM A CLASS,

70
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:40,166
AND SOME OF THE BIGWIGS
ON THE STUDENT COUNCIL, HUH?

71
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,416
-WAIT A SECOND.
ARE THEY FAIR GAME?

72
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,833
- UH-HUH. I MEAN, YEAH,
THEY'RE HELPING THE FACULTY

73
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,833
RUN THE EXAMS BEHIND
THE SCENES AND ALL,

74
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:49,833
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,
THEY'RE STUDENTS JUST LIKE US.

75
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:53,291
STILL, THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE ON
THE MENU UNTIL THE SECOND DAY.

76
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,125
- LOOK AT THAT DUMB GRIN!
THE STRONGEST FIGHTERS

77
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,125
IN THE WHOLE DARN SCHOOL ARE
GONNA BE GUNNING FOR HIM,

78
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,083
AND HE JUST STANDS
THERE LICKING HIS CHOPS!

79
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,500
- COME ON. WHAT'RE YOU
SO WORRIED ABOUT?

80
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,625
IF I SAY I CAN
TAKE 'EM, THEN I CAN TAKE 'EM.

81
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:05,875
- Motoharu: GOOD TO KNOW,

82
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,833
'CAUSE THEY'RE MAKING A
BEELINE FOR YA, BUDDY.

83
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:12,791
- HOW YOU DOING VP? "TOP" AND
BOTTOM OF THE MORNING TO YA.

84
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,416
- OH, VERY SUBTLE! THANK
YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT!

85
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,041
- Kyoya: SOMETHING I SHOULD
KNOW ABOUT, HARUKA?

86
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,208
- UM, NO. SORRY.

87
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:20,791
- GOOD TO SEE YOU, OUSAWA.

88
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,500
ALL SET FOR THE BIG DAY?

89
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,791
- Akatsuki: DON'T YOU SWEAT IT,
PREZ. I WAS BORN READY.

90
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,541
MATTER OF FACT, I CAN'T WAIT
TO GET OUT THERE

91
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,458
AND SHOW YOU GUYS WHAT I CAN DO.

92
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,166
- Kyoya: I APPLAUD YOUR
COMPETITIVE SPIRIT,

93
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,833
THOUGH I HAVE NO DOUBT
YOU'LL COME THROUGH UNSCATHED.

94
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,833
YOUR TEAM LOOKS STRONG, TOO.

95
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:37,708
AND I SEE YOU'VE ENLISTED
MOTOHARU TO YOUR CAUSE.

96
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:39,083
YOU'RE FULL OF SURPRISES.

97
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,625
- ( laughs )

98
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,041
- WELL, LOOK AT YOU.

99
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,000
MUST BE DOING SOMETHING RIGHT
IF HE KNOWS WHO YOU ARE.

100
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,666
- WELL, WE'RE BOTH IN A CLASS.

101
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,583
WHY? DOES THIS MEAN MY STOCK
JUST WENT UP WITH YOU

102
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:49,750
OR SOMETHING?

103
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,458
- Haruka: DON'T LOOK
SO PROUD, MOTOHARU.

104
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:53,166
GIVEN HOW MUCH WE'VE
HAD TO DISCIPLINE YOU

105
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,291
FOR SKIPPING CLASS, OF
COURSE WE KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

106
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:56,416
- ( laughs )

107
00:05:57,875 --> 00:06:00,958
- LUCKY ME. GETTING
A CRACK AT YOU AT LAST.

108
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:04,083
ONCE THE MATCHES START UP,
EVERYBODY'S FAIR GAME, PREZ.

109
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:07,166
YOU AN' ME ARE GONNA
HAVE US A RUMBLE.

110
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,083
- AS MUCH AS I WOULD ENJOY
PUTTING YOU IN YOUR PLACE,

111
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,500
IT WILL HAVE TO WAIT.

112
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:14,208
I'M NOT SCHEDULED TO PARTICIPATE
IN THIS ROUND OF FIGHTS.

113
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,250
- WHAT?

114
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,791
- Kyoya: AS A MEMBER OF COCOON,

115
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:19,625
MY PRESENCE AT THE UPCOMING
SUMMIT MEETING IS COMPULSORY.

116
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,333
HOWEVER, THE OTHER
THREE COUNCIL OFFICERS

117
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,250
WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY
TO TAKE YOU ON.

118
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,708
- Akatsuki: YOU'RE GOING
TO THE SUMMIT?

119
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,875
I'D ALMOST FORGOTTEN
ABOUT THAT WHOLE THING.

120
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,291
- Kyoya: FOR
WHATEVER IT'S WORTH,

121
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,625
EVERY COCOON MEMBER
WILL BE IN ATTENDANCE.

122
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:33,333
- Haruka: IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
THAT HE BE THERE, YOU SEE.

123
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:34,750
- FAIR ENOUGH,

124
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,291
BUT HE'S NOT GONNA BE IN
MEETINGS THE WHOLE TIME, RIGHT?

125
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,708
- COME ON, AKATSUKI,
CAN'T YOU GIVE IT A REST?

126
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:40,750
IT'S NOT LIKE THIS IS A
CLASS REUNION, YOU KNOW?

127
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,625
HE CAN'T JUST SLIP OUT WHENEVER.

128
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,166
SORRY, MAN,

129
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,666
BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO HAVE YOUR
SPARRING MATCH ANOTHER TIME.

130
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,541
- WITH THE MEETING IN JAPAN,
HE'S KIND OF LIKE THE HOST.

131
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,583
THE PRESIDENT HAS
A LOT ON HIS PLATE.

132
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,000
- CHICKEN, FROM THE SOUND OF IT.

133
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,583
- Haruka: WHAT? WHY, YOU LITTLE!

134
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:56,125
- Kyoya: I ONLY NEED BE AT THE
SUMMIT UNTIL TOMORROW NIGHT.

135
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,833
ASSUMING THINGS
END AS SCHEDULED,

136
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,333
THERE SHOULD BE PLENTY OF TIME
AT THE END OF THE BATTLE EXAMS

137
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,708
FOR ME TO OBLIGE YOU.

138
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,250
I TRUST THAT'LL SUFFICE?

139
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,916
- OH, HELL YEAH.
WHERE DO WE MEET?

140
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,625
- VERY FEW OF OUR
PEERS WILL ENDURE

141
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,958
TO THE END OF THE FINAL
DAY OF FIGHTING.

142
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,375
WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT,

143
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:16,666
I HAVE NO DOUBT ONE OF US WILL
HAPPEN UPON THE OTHER.

144
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,125
- SPEAKING OF CHICKEN,

145
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,958
YOU SHOULDN'T COUNT YOURS
BEFORE IT HATCHES, AKATSUKI.

146
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:22,166
A LOT CAN HAPPEN
BETWEEN NOW AND THEN.

147
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,125
THE THREE OF US CAN PARTICIPATE
STARTING TOMORROW MORNING,

148
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:27,833
AND THE MOMENT WE'VE SUITED UP,
I'M COMING FOR YOU.

149
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,541
YOU'LL BE ELIMINATED LONG
BEFORE THE PRESIDENT GETS BACK.

150
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,125
- BETTER DOUBLE DOWN ON BRAS!

151
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:34,833
- UGH! PUMMELING YOU INTO THE
GROUND IS GOING TO BE A VICTORY

152
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,083
FOR ALL WOMANKIND, YOU SAVAGE!

153
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,250
- WELL, THEN. I WILL
LOOK FOR YOU TOMORROW.

154
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:43,541
- Haruka: UH, MIU?

155
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,250
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

156
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,708
- YEAH, UM, SURE!

157
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:52,291
- HEY, MAN, I'M GONNA GO
MAKE MYSELF SCARCE.

158
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:53,833
YOU KICK SOME ASS.

159
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:56,708
AND IF THE ASS IN QUESTION COULD
MAYBE NOT BE ATTACHED TO ME,

160
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,625
YOU'D BE DOING ME A BIG FAVOR.

161
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:01,375
- I'M NOT MAKING ANY
PROMISES EITHER WAY.

162
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,583
- YOU'RE A REAL GIVER.

163
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,875
- SO, WHAT DID THE V.P.
WANNA TALK ABOUT?

164
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:09,041
- SHE, UH... IT WAS NOTHING
IMPORTANT, REALLY.

165
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:12,250
- ( bells dinging )

166
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,583
- Male Announcer: ALL RIGHT.

167
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:16,083
TIME TO EXPLAIN THE RULES
FOR THE RANKING BATTLE.

168
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,750
THE EXAM PERIOD
WILL LAST 48 HOURS.

169
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,416
YOU'LL BE EVALUATED ON HOW LONG
YOU REMAIN IN THE RUNNING,

170
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,375
AND HOW WELL YOU FIGHT.

171
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:27,166
YOU'RE ALLOWED TO SLEEP DURING
THE EXAM IF YOU SEE FIT,

172
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,666
BUT BE AWARE THAT
YOUR FELLOW STUDENTS

173
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,500
ARE ALLOWED TO ATTACK
YOU AT ANY MOMENT,

174
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:33,000
INCLUDING VULNERABLE
ONES SUCH AS THAT.

175
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,708
IF YOU DEFEAT SOMEONE WHOSE
RANK IS HIGHER THAN YOUR OWN,

176
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,500
YOUR RANK WILL BE
INCREASED IN ACCORDANCE

177
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,208
WITH THE GRADING METRIC.

178
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:42,125
EVERY STUDENT IS CONSIDERED AN
ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN THE EXAM

179
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,333
UNTIL THE POINT AT WHICH

180
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,083
THEY'RE KNOCKED UNCONSCIOUS
BY AN OPPONENT,

181
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:48,916
AT WHICH TIME THEIR FINAL SCORES
WILL BE CALCULATED.

182
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,625
ANY UNSPORTSMANLIKE CONDUCT
WILL RESULT IN DISQUALIFICATION.

183
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:55,083
THE FACULTY IS MONITORING
THE BATTLE AREA CLOSELY

184
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,291
TO KEEP THINGS ON THE UP AND UP.

185
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,916
STAY TUNED FOR A SUBSEQUENT
BROADCAST IN WHICH I'LL EXPLAIN

186
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,208
THE CONCEPT OF A.D.
POWER DELIMITING.

187
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,250
- WHAT'S "A.D.
POWER DELIMITING" MEAN?

188
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,375
- OH, YEAH. I FORGET YOU
AND AKATSUKI ARE NEW

189
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:08,791
TO THIS WHOLE BATTLE EXAM DEAL

190
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:11,083
SO I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T ASSUME
YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT'S UP.

191
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,416
- "POWER DELIMITING"
DOESN'T MEAN

192
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,916
OUR WEAPONS GET ANY STRONGER,

193
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,791
SO DON'T GET TOO
EXCITED ABOUT IT.

194
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:18,291
ALL IT MEANS IS THAT OUR A.D.
BRACELETS ARE GOING TO SYNC UP

195
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,250
WITH THE FABRIC OF
OUR GYM UNIFORMS.

196
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,791
- Chikage: EACH OF OUR BRACELETS
CONTAINS ORICHALCUM.

197
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,250
IT'S THE GOOD STUFF THAT MAKES
OUR WEAPON SUMMONING POSSIBLE.

198
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,083
TODAY, IT'LL RESPOND
TO YOUR MENTAL STATE

199
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,291
AND TURN YOUR CLOTHES
INTO COMBAT THREADS.

200
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,708
- ( gasps )
- ( smirks )

201
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,458
- LOOKS LIKE OUR OUTFITS ADAPT
TO OUR PERSONALITIES,

202
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,625
JUST LIKE OUR
WEAPONS TEND TO DO.

203
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,083
- YEAH, THAT'S THE IDEA.

204
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,791
THOUGH IT DOES CHECK
YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS, TOO,

205
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,041
SO SOMETIMES YOU GET
SOME UNUSUAL...

206
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,958
- WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

207
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:58,000
WHAT THE... WHY AM I
WEARING THIS THING?

208
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,291
- Akatsuki: CUT IT OUT,
YOU GUYS!

209
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,958
OR DO I HAVE TO START
BUSTING HEADS ALREADY?

210
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,458
SHOW SOME COMPASSION!

211
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:06,333
SHE MAY WATCH KINKY ANIME
AND WEAR ITTY BITTY SWIMSUITS,

212
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:09,666
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN SHE WANTED
TO BE SLUTTED UP LIKE THIS!

213
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,458
- HUH?
- EH?

214
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,291
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

215
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,916
- Male Announcer: THIS
YEAR'S RANKING BATTLE EXAM

216
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,541
WILL NOW BEGIN!

217
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:25,083
- ( all yelling )

218
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,625
- MOUNTING A FRONTAL ATTACK!

219
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,375
- WAS A BIG OLD MISTAKE!

220
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,250
- ( grunts )

221
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,208
- SORRY, BUT HERE IT COMES!

222
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,458
- MAN, I DIDN'T GET
TO HIT ANYBODY.

223
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:39,000
- WELL, THAT'S ONE GROUP OF
CHUMPS WE SHUT DOWN IN A HURRY,

224
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,208
NOW EXACTLY HOW MANY TEAMS ARE
THERE DOING THIS THING AGAIN?

225
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,958
- THERE ARE 39 TEAMS IN ALL,

226
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:45,083
RANGING FROM CLASS
A DOWN TO CLASS E.

227
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,250
- THIRTY SEVEN TEAMS
SOUNDS LIKE A LOT TO BEAT,

228
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,291
BUT IF WE WORK TOGETHER,
I'M SURE WE CAN DO IT!

229
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,541
- BETTER GET STARTED, THEN!

230
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,333
- ( both gasp )

231
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,208
- YOU'RE TELLING ME THOSE GUYS
WERE HIDING IN THE GROUND?

232
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,666
- ANOTHER TEAM BITES
THE DUST, LADIES.

233
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,291
OH, AN' BY THE WAY, I KNOW
YOU JOKERS ARE OUT THERE,

234
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:06,333
SO DON'T EVEN TRY IT.

235
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,375
- HUH?

236
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,666
- IF YOU KEEP HIDING
IN THE BUSHES

237
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,250
LIKE A BUNCH OF 'FRAIDY CATS,

238
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,708
I'M GONNA KICK YOUR ASSES EVEN
HARDER THAN I WAS PLANNING ON.

239
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,833
AND THAT WAS PRETTY
DAMN HARD TO BEGIN WITH!

240
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,791
- OH, NO! THEY'RE EVERYWHERE!

241
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,833
I THINK WE SHOULD
START TO WORRY NOW!

242
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,791
- I DIDN'T THINK WE'D HAVE
TO FIGHT SO MANY OF 'EM

243
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:22,750
BACK-TO-BACK!

244
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,375
- THERE'S NO TIME TO RECOVER.

245
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,833
- YOU GIRLS HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

246
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:29,000
THESE GUYS ARE ABOUT AS
THREATENING AS A STUBBED TOE,

247
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,291
SO CHILL.

248
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:31,916
WE'LL FLATTEN THEIR ASSES
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

249
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,041
- HEAR THAT, FELLAS?

250
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,583
HOTSHOT WITH THE
OVER SIZED SWORD

251
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,000
THINKS WE'RE GONNA
BE AN EASY MARK!

252
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,250
- ( laughing )

253
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:38,541
- HE'S IN FOR A BIG...

254
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,125
- WOW, AMAZING!

255
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,750
- YA SEE? THAT WAS TOTALLY
DOABLE... WHAT'D I TELL YA?

256
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,833
NOW LET'S PUT THESE
REJECTS TO BED!

257
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:52,333
- KICK HIS ASS ALREADY!

258
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,166
- Male Operator: THE FIGHTING AT
DELTA POINT HAS CEASED FOR NOW.

259
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,166
ONE TEAM HAS ELIMINATED
14 OTHERS SO FAR

260
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,166
FOR A TOTAL OF 51 PARTICIPANTS!

261
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:05,041
- NO WAY! IT HASN'T EVEN BEEN
AN HOUR YET, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

262
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,583
WHICH TEAM ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT HERE?

263
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,666
- TEAM 8, WHICH IS
NOTHING BUT B CLASSERS.

264
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,708
IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S THEIR CLASS
REP KUZUHA DOUMOTO

265
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,416
AND THREE OTHER STUDENTS.

266
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,333
- IT'S KUZUHA DOUMOTO,
CHIKAGE IZUMI, MIU OUSAWA,

267
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:18,916
AND AKATSUKI OUSAWA.

268
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,125
THEY'RE ALL GOOD, BUT THAT LAST
ONE'S A CERTIFIED SHOW STOPPER.

269
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,416
WE'LL BUMP HIM TO A CLASS, BUT
HE'S REALLY BEYOND EVEN THAT.

270
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,333
THIS GUY COULD DEFINITELY
GIVE THE STUDENT COUNCIL

271
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:28,833
A RUN FOR THEIR MONEY.

272
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,958
- Haruka: GUESS THIS EXPLAINS
WHY MY EARS WERE BURNING!

273
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,125
I WILL BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT

274
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:36,041
THAT AKATSUKI'S A HIGHLY
SKILLED COMBATANT.

275
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:38,333
BUT SUGGESTING HE'S ON
PAR WITH THE FOUR OF US

276
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,750
IS TO GIVE THAT GRINNING
DELINQUENT FAR TOO MUCH CREDIT.

277
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:43,166
- I DUNNO.

278
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,666
THINK ABOUT IT.

279
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,791
THE FOUR OF US VERSUS HIM
WOULD BE A PRETTY GOOD FIGHT.

280
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,208
- OH, COME ON!

281
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,291
WE DON'T NEED TO GANG UP.

282
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:50,750
ANY ONE OF US COULD
TAKE HIM OUT!

283
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:53,166
- THERE'S MORE TO AKATSUKI
THAN I THOUGHT AT FIRST.

284
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,708
HE TALKS A BIG GAME,

285
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,000
WHICH LED ME TO BELIEVE THERE
WAS NOTHING TO HIM BUT EGO.

286
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,083
BUT HE HAS THE SKILL
TO BACK UP HIS WORDS.

287
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,625
- MINAMI!

288
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:03,708
- BUT, GUESS YOU'D KNOW BEST.
I MEAN, AFTER ALL THAT TIME

289
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,458
YOU GUYS SPENT
TOGETHER AT THE BEACH.

290
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,958
- NOT FAIR! I WASN'T WITH
HIM BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE!

291
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,125
- NO NEED TO GET UPSET.

292
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,375
- NO! JUST STOP IT!

293
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:11,708
I'VE HAD ENOUGH!

294
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,625
IT'S WAY PAST TIME WE PUT
AKATSUKI IN HIS PLACE

295
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:14,916
ONCE AND FOR ALL!

296
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,291
LISTEN UP, YOU TWO.

297
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,000
WE'RE GOING TO FINISH UP OUR
WORK AS FAST AS WE CAN

298
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,750
AND JOIN THE RANKING
BATTLE TONIGHT!

299
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,958
I'M SICK AND TIRED OF PEOPLE
GLORIFYING AKATSUKI,

300
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,333
AND THE SOONER WE PROVE
THEM WRONG, THE BETTER!

301
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:27,166
LEST YOU'VE FORGOTTEN, WE ARE
OFFICERS OF THE STUDENT COUNCIL!

302
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,541
WE MAINTAIN ORDER
WITHIN BABEL.

303
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,416
IF WE CAN'T DEFEAT A GUY FROM
CLASS B, WHAT GOOD ARE WE?

304
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,750
- Akatsuki: ( sighs ) COULDN'T
EAT ANOTHER BITE!

305
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,708
- Miu: ARE YOU SURE THIS
IS A GOOD IDEA?

306
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,000
HAVING A FIRE OUT
IN THE OPEN LIKE THIS?

307
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,750
THE OTHERS WILL
KNOW WHERE WE ARE!

308
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,083
- THE OTHERS ARE
PROBABLY JUST THANKFUL

309
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,583
WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN AROUND
TO BEATING THEM UP

310
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:53,875
AND TAKING THEIR LUNCHES YET.

311
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,458
AFTER THE SHOW WE PUT ON TODAY,

312
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:58,000
I REALLY DON'T THINK ANYONE'S
GONNA COME LOOKING FOR TROUBLE.

313
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,708
- YEAH, PROBABLY NOT.

314
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,500
- WE DID KICK A LOT OF ASS.

315
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:04,500
- NOW, THEN. TIME TO STRIP DOWN
AND HAVE OURSELVES A GOOD SOAK.

316
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,000
- Girls: HUH?

317
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:08,958
- KUZUHA USES HER EARTH MAGIC
TO WHIP US UP A BIG TUB,

318
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,291
CHIKAGE USES HER WATER
MAGIC TO FILL IT UP,

319
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,625
WE TOSS IN SOME HOT ROCKS
TO KEEP IT NICE AND TOASTY

320
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,291
AND BAM, OPEN AIR BATH!

321
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:19,125
- YOU WANNA BATHE WITH US?

322
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,750
- Akatsuki: THIS IS GONNA ROCK
AFTER THE SWEATY DAY WE ALL HAD.

323
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:24,083
- I AGREE WITH YOU
IN THEORY, BUT...

324
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,291
- PEEL 'EM OFF, LADIES,

325
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,291
THIS LESBIAN DIDN'T DIG
A HOLE FOR NOTHING.

326
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:28,541
- FAIR ENOUGH!

327
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,541
YOU HEARD HER, GIRLS.
MAKE YOURSELVES AT HOME.

328
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:31,791
- WAIT, YOU'RE SERIOUS?

329
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,333
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

330
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,250
YOU DON'T THINK I'M GONNA PEEK
AT YOUR NAKED BODIES, DO YA?

331
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,916
LOOK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY.
I GIVE YOU MY WORD I'LL BE GOOD.

332
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,041
- YEAH? YOU REALLY DO MEAN IT?

333
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,833
I'VE GOT A BAD
FEELING ABOUT THIS.

334
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,125
- Chikage: THE MAN
AIN'T PERFECT,

335
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,333
BUT HE DID GIVE US HIS WORD
THAT HE'D BEHAVE.

336
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,083
- ( Miu screams )

337
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,583
WHAT THE...

338
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:54,625
- ( Kuzuha grunts )

339
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,291
- YOU TOTALLY LIED TO US!

340
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,791
- HEY, I DIDN'T PEEK!
COME ON, YOU'RE SO TENSE!

341
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,000
- WHY ARE YOU TOUCHING ME?

342
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,458
- AW, NOW, YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT.

343
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,708
AFTER ALL THAT FIGHTING
YOU DID, YOU NEED MASSAGES!

344
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,291
- HUH? I DON'T WANT ONE!
LEMME GO!

345
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,750
- DON'T BE SHY!
WHO WANTS A GOOD RUB DOWN?

346
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,583
- Girls: NO!

347
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,166
- NO BATHING!
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS!

348
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,666
WHAT IF SOMEBODY ATTACKS US
WHILE WE'RE IN THE WATER?

349
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,750
WE'D BE AT A HUGE DISADVANTAGE!

350
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,625
- YOU THINK SO? WE WOULD GET
TO SOAK IN THE MEANTIME.

351
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,416
AND WORST CASE SCENARIO, WE
COULD JUST FIGHT 'EM OFF NAKED!

352
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,541
- Girls: WE COULD WHAT?

353
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,000
- WHAT WAS THAT?

354
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,541
- SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY BROKE
THROUGH MY WIND BARRIER!

355
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,916
- Haruka: YOU'RE NONE THE WORSE
FOR WEAR. LUCKY YOU.

356
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:42,916
- Chikage: WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

357
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,208
- HEY, YOU GUYS!

358
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,666
WHAT HAPPENED TO NOT
BEING ABLE TO MAKE IT OUT

359
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,916
FOR THE FIRST DAY?

360
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,375
I FIGURED YOU WOULDN'T
ROLL IN ON MY CAMPFIRE

361
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,083
UNTIL 12:01 AT THE EARLIEST.

362
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,833
- Ryohei: WE WERE GONNA TO WAIT
UNTIL TOMORROW MORNING

363
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:54,333
TO CHALLENGE YOU,
BUT HARUKA GOT IMPATIENT.

364
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:55,750
- YEAH, SHE COULDN'T
HOLD HERSELF BACK.

365
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,416
- UH, MINAMI, CAN YOU NOT
MAKE IT SOUND SO SEXUAL?

366
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,833
- All: AW...

367
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,458
- Haruka: A THOUSAND
PARDONS, AKATSUKI,

368
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,791
BUT COULD I BOTHER YOU FOR
A MOMENT OF YOUR TIME?

369
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:06,041
I TRUST I DON'T HAVE
TO EXPLAIN MYSELF.

370
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,166
- 'COURSE YA DON'T, AND LUCKY
FOR YOU I'M A REAL SUCKER

371
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,750
FOR AN INVITATION
FROM A PRETTY GIRL.

372
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,916
- WAIT A SECOND! YOU CAN'T
FIGHT HER BY YOURSELF!

373
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,333
- THE OTHERS ARE FREE TO HELP

374
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:16,375
IF YOU DON'T THINK YOU'RE
UP TO THE TASK, AKATSUKI.

375
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:17,875
- NO NEED TO BRING 'EM INTO IT.

376
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,666
TOMORROW'S GONNA BE
A FULL DAY OF FIGHTING,

377
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,666
AND THE LAST THING I WANT
IS FOR THESE LOVELY GIRLS

378
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,666
TO GET KNOCKED AROUND
TONIGHT ON ACCOUNT OF ME.

379
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,041
- YOU CALL THAT LOGIC?

380
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,166
IN CASE YOU FORGOT, YOU HAVE
TO FIGHT TOMORROW, TOO!

381
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,458
- WE BECAME A TEAM SO WE
COULD DO THIS TOGETHER.

382
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:31,291
JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE
CALLS YOU OUT FOR A FIGHT

383
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,916
DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE
TO FACE THEM ALONE!

384
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,958
- AND YOU GUYS!

385
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,291
YOU STUDENT COUNCIL MEMBERS ACT

386
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,250
LIKE HE'S GOT A TARGET
ON HIS BACK ALL THE TIME!

387
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,166
WHY DO YOU WANNA
DEFEAT HIM SO BADLY?

388
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,791
- UH, IT'S BECAUSE OF
THE THINGS HE DOES.

389
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:47,875
- WAIT A MINUTE. THAT LOOK ON
HER FACE. I KNOW THAT FEELING.

390
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:50,541
- HE TOOK A LITTLE EXTRA FROM
HER DURING SWIMSUIT TAG.

391
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,500
- THAT'S ENOUGH!

392
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:55,291
- TOOK A LITTLE EXTRA
DURING TAG?

393
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:57,916
( grunts )

394
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,458
GROSS!

395
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,750
I HOPE SHE KICKS YOUR BUTT INTO
NEXT WEEK, YOU SLEAZE BALL!

396
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,083
- Haruka: HOW'D YOU LIKE
YOUR FIRST TASTE

397
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:05,416
OF THE RANKING BATTLE?

398
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,666
- Akatsuki: I DUNNO.

399
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,458
DIDN'T REALLY LIVE UP
TO THE HYPE, I GUESS.

400
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:09,625
I HOPED IT'D BE TOUGHER.

401
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,291
THOUGH, I GOT A FEELING
I MAY GET MY WISH

402
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,583
ONCE THE COCOON SUMMIT WRAPS UP.

403
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,166
- YOU DON'T NEED TO WAIT
FOR THE PRESIDENT.

404
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,458
IF YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR A CHALLENGE,

405
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:19,083
I'M SURE THAT THE THREE OF
US CAN OBLIGE YOU!

406
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,000
- Akatsuki: WHAT WAS
THAT HOODOO?

407
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,375
- Ryohei: WE PUT UP A BARRIER
TWO KILOMETERS ACROSS.

408
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:25,750
BASICALLY, IT KEEPS THE SOUND

409
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,708
AND VIBRATION OF US FIGHTING
FROM LEAVING THE AREA

410
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,708
AND BEING A NUISANCE
TO ANYONE AROUND US.

411
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,375
- WE CAN FIGHT TO
OUR HEARTS' CONTENT,

412
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,208
AND NOBODY WILL
INTERFERE WITH US.

413
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,666
- NOT GONNA LIE, I DIG THE WAY
YOU'RE SETTING THE STAGE.

414
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,166
JUST, ONE QUESTION
BEFORE WE ROCK THIS OUT.

415
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,458
IS THIS GONNA COUNT TOWARDS
MY RANKING EXAM RESULTS,

416
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,291
OR IS THIS BATTLE OFF THE BOOKS?

417
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,958
- Ryohei: OH, IT
DEFINITELY COUNTS.

418
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,333
BUT I DOUBT THAT SORT OF THING
SHOULD BE MUCH OF A CONCERN

419
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:46,875
FOR YOU GUYS ANYMORE.

420
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,083
- NO?

421
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,708
- LOOK, YOU AND YOUR
TEAMMATES EARNED

422
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:52,666
EXCEEDINGLY HIGH MARKS DURING
TODAY'S PORTION OF THE EXAM.

423
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,083
ANY WAY YA SLICE IT,

424
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,333
YOU AND THE OTHERS ARE GETTING
BUMPED UP TO A CLASS.

425
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,791
IN OTHER WORDS,
THIS LOSS WON'T HURT YOU.

426
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,041
- GOOD TO KNOW.

427
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,666
LOOKS LIKE OLD KYOYO AN'
I WILL BE CLASSMATES.

428
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,000
THAT SHOULD MAKE FOR SOME FUN.

429
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,375
THAT SAID, IT IS KIND OF A
BUMMER THAT WINNING THIS

430
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,500
WON'T NET ME
ANYTHING, BUT HEY...

431
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,791
AT LEAST I'LL BE READY WHEN
KYOYA FINALLY GETS HERE.

432
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,500
NO POINT IN LOOKING A GIFT WARM
UP IN THE MOUTH, AM I RIGHT?

433
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,958
MAKING THAT BARRIER
WAS A BIG MISTAKE, PRINCESS.

434
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,083
NOW THAT I CAN WHUP ON
YOU WITHOUT INTERRUPTION,

435
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,000
THIS BATTLE IS AS GOOD AS OVER.

436
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,333
- SUCH ARROGANCE!

437
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:26,041
MINAMI! UESAKI!
THIS IS MY FIGHT!

438
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,958
I'LL BE THE ONE
TO TAKE HIM DOWN.

439
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:31,458
AKATSUKI OUSAWA!
PREPARE YOURSELF FOR DEFEAT!

440
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:33,791
WHERE'D HE GO?

441
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:34,833
- Akatsuki: YOU MISS ME?

442
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,500
COME ON, WHO DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE MESSING WITH?

443
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:42,041
- NOW I'VE GOT YOU!

444
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,750
HUH?

445
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,666
HE'S A GOOD FIGHTER,
BUT AS LONG AS WE'RE AIRBORNE,

446
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,166
THE ADVANTAGE IS MINE!

447
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,875
- Akatsuki: YOU READY?
'CAUSE HERE IT COMES!

448
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:58,583
- ( screams )

449
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,000
- THIS WOULD BE A GREAT TIME
TO WAVE THE WHITE FLAG.

450
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,875
- WHAT THE...

451
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,208
WHY DID YOU INTERFERE?

452
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,458
DIDN'T I TELL YOU BOTH THIS
WAS MY FIGHT TO WIN?

453
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,333
- MAYBE YOU SAID SOMETHING
TO THAT EFFECT,

454
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:17,750
BUT I DON'T REMEMBER AGREEING.

455
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,541
- YOU'RE LETTING YOUR PERSONAL
FEELINGS GET IN THE WAY

456
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,708
OF YOUR RESPONSIBILITY
AS A STUDENT COUNCIL MEMBER,

457
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:23,958
WHEN YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING
AT THE BIG PICTURE.

458
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,875
- THIS GUY IS POWERFUL.
ALL THERE IS TO IT.

459
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,958
AND YOU'RE OUR VICE
PRESIDENT, HARUKA.

460
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,833
WHAT HAPPENS IF HE DEFEATS YOU?
CAN YOU IMAGINE IT?

461
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,500
ONCE WE'RE NOT TOP OF THE HEAP,

462
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,041
THE ORDER WE'VE
WORKED HARD TO MAINTAIN

463
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:37,000
GOES RIGHT
OUT THE DAMN WINDOW!

464
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:40,041
- AND NOW? IT TOOK THREE OF US
TO BEAT HIM ISN'T THAT JUST AS-

465
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,500
- AKATSUKI ISN'T UNBEATABLE!

466
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,083
AND HE'S BEEN ACTING LIKE HE IS.

467
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,291
YOU SAID YOU'D
PUT HIM IN HIS PLACE.

468
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,708
THAT'S ALL THE THREE
OF US DID RIGHT NOW.

469
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,583
WE SHOWED A JACKASS WHO'S BOSS.

470
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:53,916
- Akatsuki: SURE YEAH,
LESSON LEARNED.

471
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I FIGURED YOU THREE
WOULD GANG UP ON ME,

472
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,500
SO IT WASN'T MUCH OF A SHOCK.

473
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,125
- Ryohei: HOW IS HE
EVEN CONSCIOUS?

474
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,791
- Akatsuki: I CAN PUT UP
AN ANTI MAGIC FIELD

475
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,375
WHEN THE MOOD STRIKES
ME, YOU KNOW.

476
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,375
- GOOD TO KNOW. SINCE
THAT'S THE CASE,

477
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,208
I GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO DO THIS
THE OLD FASHIONED WAY,

478
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:07,791
WITH WEAPON BASED ATTACKS.

479
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,333
- Haruka: THERE ARE
TIMES TO WORRY ABOUT

480
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:14,208
THE FAIRNESS OF A FIGHT,
BUT THIS ISN'T ONE OF THEM.

481
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:18,583
- Akatsuki: INFUSING YOUR
WEAPONS WITH MAGIC! I DIG IT!

482
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,000
YOU'RE FINALLY STARTING
TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY!

483
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:24,583
IN WHICH CASE I AIN'T
GONNA HOLD BACK!

484
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:25,958
- WHETHER YOU HOLD BACK OR NOT,

485
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:28,083
YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE
TO US EITHER WAY!

486
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,666
- HA!

487
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:33,458
- WHAT'S HE DOING?

488
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,791
NO, THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING.

489
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:42,583
BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

490
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,875
- SAY GOODNIGHT,
STUDENT COUNCIL!

491
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:55,333
COME ON, MAN, I WAS ABOUT TO
PULL OFF AN EPIC TRIPLE K.O.

492
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:57,000
WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA, MOTOHARU?

493
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,708
- HEY, YOU KNOW I
WOULDN'T SPOIL YOUR FUN

494
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,708
UNLESS IT WAS IMPORTANT, RIGHT?

495
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,875
WE'VE GOT A BIT OF AN
EMERGENCY ON OUR HANDS.

496
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,541
I'M SURPRISED HARUKA HASN'T
ALREADY PICKED UP ON IT.

497
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,458
I TAKE IT YOU HAVEN'T
NOTICED THAT LITTLE CUT

498
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:08,916
ON YOUR CHEEK, AKKI?

499
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,708
- Akatsuki: NO, BUT IT'S
JUST A SCRATCH. SO...

500
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:13,541
- SO IT SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
POSSIBLE TO RECEIVE IT

501
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:14,708
IN THE FIRST PLACE,

502
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,416
THANKS TO THE BARRIER
OVER ALL OF BABEL

503
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,125
THAT CONVERTS PHYSICAL
DAMAGE INTO MENTAL TRAUMA.

504
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:21,333
YET, THERE IT IS ANYWAY.

505
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,041
- WAIT, THE CONVERSION
FIELD IS GONE?

506
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,041
- AND SO FAR,
THE FACULTY MEMBERS

507
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:30,083
HAVEN'T SAID SQUAT ABOUT THIS
RATHER IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT.

508
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:31,708
SOMETHING IS GOING DOWN,
YOU GUYS.

509
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,375
PROBABLY SOMETHING SINISTER.

510
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,333
- ( heavy crashing )

511
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:38,083
- THAT CRASHING SOUND!
IT CAME FROM WHERE MIU WAS!

512
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,166
( gasps )

513
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,208
AKATSUKI! NO!

514
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:48,166
- ( theme song playing )

515
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,791
- ( singing in Japanese )

516
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:20,708
- Listy: I TOOK STOCK OF PHIL
BURNETT BEFORE HE LEFT,

517
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:24,041
AND IN HIM I SEE A MAN WHO WILL
SACRIFICE WHATEVER IS NECESSARY

518
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:26,291
IN ORDER TO CARRY THE DAY.

519
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:28,833
GARIUS'S DAUGHTER AND
AKATSUKI ARE IN DANGER,

520
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:32,250
BUT HE MAY WELL BRING HARM
TO ANY WHO STAND IN HIS WAY.

521
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:34,541
OF COURSE, IT REMAINS TO BE
SEEN IF GARIUS' DAUGHTER

522
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:36,500
HAS INDEED FLED TO
THE OTHER WORLD.

523
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:40,416
I HOPE NOT. BUT IF WHAT
LORD BARAM SAID IS TRUE...

524
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,083
NEXT EPISODE. "ON SUCH A
BEAUTIFUL MOONLIT NIGHT."

525
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:45,500
THIS WILL NOT END WELL.
