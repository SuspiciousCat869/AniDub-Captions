1
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,083
- ( groaning )

2
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:43,583
- ( gasping )

3
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:46,875
- Akatsuki: SO.

4
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:54,583
NOT TOO BAD, HUH?

5
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:55,666
- ( chuckles )

6
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:58,625
- ( explosion )

7
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:05,750
- ( growling )

8
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:11,291
- ( theme music playing )

9
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:13,250
- ( singing in Japanese )

10
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,666
- NO. I, I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

11
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,958
- ( crackling )
- (gasping )

12
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:04,625
- ( gasps ) DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT IT. THIS IS BEYOND STUPID.

13
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,625
HOW'RE YOU SUPPOSED
TO FIGHT WITHOUT A WEAPON?

14
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:08,750
YOU CAN'T GO AT HIM
WITH YOUR BARE HANDS.

15
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,000
- IT'S HAPPENING, OKAY?

16
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:14,750
I ACCEPT THAT IT'S STUPID
THOUGH THAT WORD'S A TAD HARSH.

17
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,958
RECKLESS MIGHT BE BETTER.
MORE MY STYLE.

18
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,375
ANYWAY, POINT IS
THIS AIN'T ABOUT ODDS.

19
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,583
IT'S ABOUT DOING WHAT
I GOTTA DO DESPITE THEM.

20
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:24,208
- SORRY, BABE.
- DAMN YOU.

21
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,791
- A LITTLE FAITH GOES
A LONG WAY, YOU KNOW.

22
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,416
TIMES LIKE THESE,

23
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,333
SOMEONE BELIEVING IN ME TENDS
TO BE WORTH IT'S WEIGHT IN GOLD.

24
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,166
BESIDES, IF YOU'RE ONLY GONNA
PUT STOCK IN SOMETHING

25
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,000
WHEN IT'S A SURE THING,
THAT'S NOT REALLY FAITH, IS IT?

26
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,416
KINDA THE OPPOSITE, ACTUALLY.

27
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,291
PLEASE.

28
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:45,000
WHAT I NEED FROM YOU MORE
THAN ANYTHING IS CONFIDENCE.

29
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,166
I REALIZE ON THE SURFACE
THINGS LOOK BAD,

30
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,666
BUT IT ALL REALLY BOILS DOWN

31
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,166
TO TRUSTING YOUR INSTINCTS
ABOUT ME. YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE

32
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,833
THE GUY FIGHTING FOR YOUR LIFE
HAS GOT A CHANCE.

33
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,750
- DON'T YOU KNOW IT'S A GIRL'S
PREROGATIVE TO HAVE FAITH

34
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,166
AND BE WORRIED SICK
AT THE SAME TIME?

35
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,833
JUST TRY NOT TO GET
YOURSELF KILLED.

36
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,041
- Haruka: OUSAWA!

37
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,333
- WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE FOR YOU
TO LEARN YOU CAN'T STOP ME?

38
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,250
C'MON, VP.

39
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,750
- OH, SHUT UP.

40
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,291
I HAVE NO INTENTION OF TRYING
TO STOP YOU, BARBARIAN.

41
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:34,083
HERE. TAKE IT. CONSIDER IT
MY TOKEN CONTRIBUTION.

42
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,666
- THANK YOU.

43
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,458
- MADE PEACE WITH YOUR FATE,
I PRESUME?

44
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:43,250
- I GUESS.
YOU MAKE PEACE WITH YOURS?

45
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,625
- ( snorting )
- LET'S DO THIS.

46
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,958
- MEET YOUR END!
- ( Akatsuki screaming )

47
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:07,625
- FARE THEE WELL, LOSER.
- FARE THEE WELL, HAS-BEEN.

48
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,291
- ( grunting )

49
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,041
- ( gasps )

50
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,083
- ( groaning )

51
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:27,708
- OH, NO.

52
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,000
- ( roaring )

53
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,000
- ( gasping )

54
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,791
- THIS HAD BETTER NOT BE
WHAT I GET FOR HAVING FAITH.

55
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,791
WE BELONG TOGETHER.

56
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:42,291
FIGHT IT. PLEASE.

57
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,416
- HEY, LOOK ALIVE, ASSHOLE.

58
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,375
- ( gasps )

59
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:05,583
- ( screams )

60
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,625
- ( screams )

61
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,666
- ( groaning in pain )

62
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,125
- ( both gasp )

63
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:46,750
- ( panting )

64
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:08,041
- ( whimpers )
- YOU CRYING?

65
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,375
- ( snickers )

66
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,791
- Male: THIS IS THE HERO
WE'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT?

67
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,666
WELL, I GIVE HIS
LITTLE DISPLAY CREDIT

68
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:46,041
FOR RELIEVING THE TEDIUM OF THIS
GATHERING, AT LEAST.

69
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,833
- Female: QUITE. IT'S
NOT EVERY PERSON

70
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,875
WHO CAN TAKE ON A HIGHER
LIFE FORM LIKE THAT,

71
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:53,333
WITHOUT THE LUXURY OF MAGIC.
HE HAS CONSIDERABLE SKILL.

72
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:54,833
THAT MUCH IS PLAIN.

73
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:57,541
I AM REASONABLY,
IF CAUTIOUSLY, IMPRESSED.

74
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,375
- Second Female:
HIGHER LIFE FORM?

75
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,541
HIS ADVERSARY WAS A CHARLATAN
BOUND BY THE PHYSICAL LAWS

76
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,250
OF THIS UNIVERSE.

77
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,833
- Third Female: I CONCEDE
THE TITLE IN THIS CASE.

78
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:08,708
THE CREATURE IN QUESTION
WAS MORE OF A PARASITE.

79
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:12,083
ONE APPROPRIATELY LEFT FOR
AN AMATEUR TO DEAL WITH.

80
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,791
IN A WORD, TRIVIAL.

81
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:16,583
THE HIGHER LIFE FORM WE SEEK
WOULD NOT BE SO EASILY BEATEN

82
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,666
BY THIS NON ENTITY.

83
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,333
- Michael: PRECISELY.

84
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,083
AS WE SPEAK TOWERS OF BABEL,

85
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,791
THE WORLD OVER ARE
WORKING TO EQUALIZE

86
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,708
THE SUB-TERRANEAN VEINS.

87
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,583
TWO ARE ON THE VERGE
OF COMPLETION.

88
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:28,750
WHEN CONSTRUCTION IS FINISHED,

89
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:31,416
PROJECT Y WILL ENTER
IT'S FINAL PHASE.

90
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,583
LET US HOPE YOU ARE ALL
PREPARED FOR THAT DAY.

91
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,375
- Male: WHAT OF
CRIMSON TWILIGHT?

92
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,541
DO WE HAVE LEAVE
TO NEUTRALIZE THEM?

93
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,041
- Michael: IF YOU WISH.

94
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,666
IN POINT OF FACT, YOU HAVE
EXPRESS PERMISSION TO DEAL WITH,

95
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,291
AS YOU SEE FIT
ANYONE YOU DEEM A THREAT.

96
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:49,000
HOWEVER, YOU WILL LEAVE
THEIR LEADER TO ME.

97
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,708
DO WHAT YOU WILL TO HIS
LACKEYS, I DON'T CARE.

98
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:54,041
KILL HIM AND YOU ANSWER TO ME.

99
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,333
- Kyoya: A CREATURE,
BY RIGHTS IMPERMEABLE

100
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,291
TO THE ANTICS OF
LOWER FORMS, DESTROYED.

101
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:07,583
A BEING ENTANGLED WITH THIS
WORLD'S LAWS ONLY IN SO FAR AS

102
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,708
IT PULLS THE STRINGS.

103
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:10,833
- Kyoya: TO THINK AN OPPORTUNITY

104
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:13,125
WOULD PRESENT ITSELF
SO SUDDENLY.

105
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:18,250
- Michael: HIKAMI.
- YES, MICHAEL?

106
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:21,291
- I'M BAFFLED THAT YOU LEFT
THIS PROBLEM TO SOMEONE ELSE.

107
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:26,875
FRAUD OR NO, THE PARASITE
WAS ENORMOUSLY POWERFUL.

108
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,791
YOU KNEW THIS. A DIRECT HIT

109
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:31,666
AND YOUR TOWER WOULD'VE BEEN
A DOLL-HOUSE IN A HURRICANE.

110
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,125
YET, YOU CHOSE TO STEP DOWN

111
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:36,208
AND ALLOW THE "HERO" TO SOAR
IN ON A WING AND A PRAYER.

112
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,583
HAD HE FAILED,
THE PLAN WOULD'VE SUFFERED.

113
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,625
- I DO NOT DENY IT.

114
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:42,666
THE LIGHT OF BABEL COULD'VE
OBLITERATED THE CREATURE

115
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,000
IN AN INSTANT.

116
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,083
EXCEPT, EVERYTHING WITHIN
A THREE-KILOMETER RADIUS

117
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,083
WOULD'VE BEEN
COLLATERAL DAMAGE.

118
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,208
THERE WERE STUDENTS
STILL WITHIN THE VICINITY,

119
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:54,208
INCLUDING THREE WHO SERVE
WITH ME ON THE COUNCIL BOARD.

120
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:57,958
I COULD NOT IN GOOD CONSCIENCE
CONDEMN THEM.

121
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,916
- YOU KNOW YOUR CONSCIENCE
IS OF NO CONCERN TO THE PROJECT.

122
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,583
SACRIFICES ARE SOMETIMES
CALLED FOR.

123
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,833
PERSONAL FEELINGS CANNOT
BE ALLOWED TO TAKE PRECEDENCE.

124
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:09,000
- YOU WOULD CERTAINLY
KNOW BETTER THAN I.

125
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,250
YOUR LITTLE BROTHER
WAS ONE SUCH SACRIFICE.

126
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:20,666
- THIS BLOWS.

127
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,958
I WAS ITCHING TO GO
MANO Y MANO WITH KYOYA.

128
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:27,125
- Motoharu: AH,
FIGURED YOU'D BE UP HERE.

129
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,750
WHATEVER YOU DID,
THE V.P. IS ON THE WAR PATH.

130
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,916
SHE'S MOVING HEAVEN
AND EARTH TO FIND YOU.

131
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,458
PEOPLE ARE GETTING SCARED.

132
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:36,625
- OH, YEAH. SHE PROBABLY WANTS
HER WRIST BAND THINGY BACK.

133
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,833
- ( scoffing )

134
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,291
- Motoharu: NOT THAT
YOU'D BE INTERESTED,

135
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:46,208
BUT THEY POSTED EVERYONE'S
RANK. SEEN YOURS YET?

136
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,208
- Akatsuki: WAIT, WHAT?
HOW'S THAT POSSIBLE?

137
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,791
I THOUGHT THE WHOLE THING
WAS CANCELED AFTER DAY TWO.

138
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,666
- I THINK THEY JUST WENT OFF
OF EVERYONE'S SCORES

139
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,250
UP TO THE SYSTEM CRASH.

140
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,250
SEEMS FAIR ENOUGH
TO ME, I GUESS.

141
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,375
I WOULDN'T RAISE A STINK
ABOUT IT IF I WERE YOU.

142
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:01,083
WHATEVER THEIR MODEL, YOU AND
THE GALS WON FIRST PLACE.

143
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:05,000
- NO KIDDING? HUH.
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

144
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:08,083
- MEH. I DIDN'T BOMB IT,
BUT, YOU KNOW.

145
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,541
- YEAH, WELL I GUESS
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS,

146
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,791
WHEN YOU SPEND THE WHOLE EXAM
TAILING ONE GUY.

147
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,708
- HEY, WHATEVER, BIG SHOT.

148
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,791
AND I GUESS WE'RE NOT COUNTING

149
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,125
ME SCHLEPPING
ONIZUKA TO THE ICU.

150
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,291
I'D HAVE BEEN ON TOP OF
THINGS ACCEPT FOR THAT.

151
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,291
SORRY, I COULDN'T
HELP YA DO MORE.

152
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:22,666
- YOU'RE SO FULL OF IT.

153
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,791
LIKE I DON'T KNOW WHOSE
FANCY FOOTWORK IT WAS

154
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,958
THAT PLAYED HAVOC
WITH THE DRAGON.

155
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,958
THOSE CHAINS HAD
YOUR NAME ALL OVER THEM.

156
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:35,208
- HOLY CRAP, I'M GETTING TIRED
OF BEING SO OBVIOUS.

157
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,041
AND I DIDN'T MEAN TO CROWD
YOUR MOMENT, DUDE,

158
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,875
IT'S JUST KEEPING THINGS
COVERT ISN'T MY STRONG SUIT.

159
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,833
HEY, NO HARD FEELINGS, RIGHT?

160
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,250
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

161
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,291
I'D HAVE FINISHED HIM WITH
OR WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE.

162
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:48,125
- ( chuckles ) STRENGTH,
LOOKS, AND HUMILITY.

163
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,583
- TELL ME SOMETHING.

164
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:52,625
WHEN YOU SAY YOU WERE TRYING
NOT TO CROWD MY MOMENT,

165
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:56,083
YOU MEAN 'CAUSE YOU FIGURED THE
DRAGON WAS MY PROBLEM, RIGHT?

166
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,541
WHAT IF IT HADN'T BEEN?
WOULD YOU HAVE STEPPED UP?

167
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:02,666
- ( both snickers )

168
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,833
- I'M A LOT OF THINGS, BROTHER,

169
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:06,000
BUT BADASS DRAGON SLAYER
AIN'T ONE OF THEM.

170
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,291
IF IT HORNS IN ON
THE TRANQUILITY OF ME-TIME,

171
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,291
MY POLICY IS TO AVOID IT
LIKE THE PLAGUE.

172
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:13,583
BESIDES, I TOLD YA, I DON'T TAKE
UP ARMS WHEN THE OUTCOME IS SET.

173
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,500
THAT KIND OF STUFF IS ABOUT
AS FAR FROM MY STYLE

174
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:16,708
AS YOU CAN GET.

175
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:17,958
ANYWAY, PEACE OUT.

176
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:19,958
- ( phone vibrating )

177
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,708
- ( beeps )

178
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,833
- Motoharu: TO WHAT DO I OWE
THE PLEASURE, CAPTAIN?

179
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,291
YOU NEVER CALL ME.

180
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,958
YEAH. THAT'D BE THE
UNDERSTATEMENT OF THE YEAR.

181
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,166
THE CRAZY SON OF A BITCH
CUT A HIGHER LIFE FORM

182
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,166
THE SIZE OF A FREIGHTER
IN TWO WITHOUT USING MAGIC.

183
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,541
SHAME HE AND KYOYA DIDN'T GET
TO FIGHT. IT WOULDA BEEN EPIC.

184
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,875
TRUST ME, THOUGH, THE DUDE
ISN'T GONNA WANNA JOIN US.

185
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,166
PRETTY SURE O' THAT.

186
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,833
HUH?

187
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,166
SURE, WHY NOT?

188
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,958
IT'S BEEN A BREEZE KEEPING
AN EYE ON HIM SO FAR.

189
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,666
UNDERSTOOD, TILL
TWILIGHT HERALDS NIGHTFALL.

190
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,916
- ( beeps )

191
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,416
- WELL, HUH, THINGS
ARE FINALLY STARTING

192
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,166
TO GET A LITTLE INTERESTING.

193
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,083
- AM I GIVEN TO UNDERSTAND,
LORD BARAM,

194
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:10,000
THAT YOU KNEW FULL WELL THIS
MAN WAS CONTRACTED TO A DRAGON,

195
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,291
AND THAT YOU PERSONALLY
RECOMMENDED HIM TO OUR ALLIANCE

196
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,083
WITHOUT A WORD
OF WARNING THEREOF?

197
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:18,041
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY UNFORGIVABLE.
EXPLAIN YOURSELF.

198
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:20,416
- WE'RE DEALING WITH
THE DAUGHTER OF A DARK LORD.

199
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,500
SURELY FIGHTING FIRE
WITH FIRE IS PERMISSIBLE

200
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,208
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

201
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,750
- WE WILL NOT BE PERSUADED
BY SUCH THREADBARE ATTEMPTS

202
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,791
TO JUSTIFY
YOUR ULTERIOR MOTIVES.

203
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,916
- MAY I ASK WHAT PRECISELY
BOTHERS YOU

204
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,083
ABOUT THE ENLISTMENT
OF ZAHHAK'S AID, YOUR MAJESTY?

205
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,625
WHAT DOES IT MATTER IF THE
DRAGON OF WOE CARRIES OUT

206
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:40,250
OUR JUSTICE FOR US SO LONG AS IT
IS DONE FOR THE GREATER GOOD?

207
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,375
THIS MORAL QUIBBLING IS ABSURD.

208
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:45,250
THE HIGH ROAD LEADS NOWHERE
IF WE FEAR TO MOVE.

209
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,375
- ( sighing )

210
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:51,333
- PRAY CONTINUE. HOW MIGHT
THE ACTIONS OF YOUR MAN,

211
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:54,416
FOR GOOD OR ILL, BE JUDGED
BY THE LIGHT OF DAY?

212
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,833
- BY THEIR RESULTS, OF COURSE.
WHAT ELSE?

213
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,208
HISTORY IS WRITTEN
BY THE SIDE THAT TRIUMPHS.

214
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:03,333
SHOULD BURNETT RETURN TO US
WITH THE GIRL IN HIS POSSESSION,

215
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:06,000
IT WILL BE AN EASY BUSINESS
TO RAISE HIM UP.

216
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:09,708
WHATEVER HIS DEEDS, A HERO LENDS
HIMSELF WELL TO PROPAGANDA.

217
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,250
- I AGREE WITH
YOUR SHREWD ASSESSMENT

218
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,083
OF THE MATTER, LORD BARAM.

219
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,291
I WOULD ADD A CAVEAT
TO THAT, HOWEVER.

220
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,791
IT CAN ONLY SERVE
TO DEEPEN OUR PLIGHT

221
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:19,291
SHOULD HE NOT RETURN WITH
THE DARK LORD'S DAUGHTER.

222
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:22,500
- THEN HERE IS OUR REMEDY.
I SHALL TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY

223
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:25,500
FOR THE MORAL OVERSIGHT SHOULD
OUR HERO BE PROVEN LACKING.

224
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,625
WILL THIS SUFFICE, YOUR MAJESTY?

225
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,416
- ( footsteps approaching )

226
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,458
- WHAT IS IT? WE'RE DISCUSSING
MATTERS OF GREAT IMPORT HERE.

227
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,875
- OUR APOLOGIES.
WE'VE ILL TIDINGS. VERY ILL.

228
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,416
MY LADY,

229
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,708
WORD HAS JUST TRAVELED DOWN
TO US FROM THE BLACK MOUNTAIN.

230
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,083
THE FELL CREATURES
RESIDING THERE

231
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,166
HAVE DECLARED WAR ON EACH OTHER.

232
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,958
THE BALANCE HAS SHIFTED.

233
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,500
YOUR SEERS BELIEVE
THE DEATH OF ZAHHAK

234
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:49,833
HAS NULLIFIED THEIR TRUCE.

235
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,625
HE WAS THE MOUNTAIN'S MASTER.

236
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:54,958
AS IT SEEMS HIS PLACE KNOWS
HIM NO MORE, ALL IS CHAOS.

237
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,500
- IMPOSSIBLE!

238
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:59,291
- IF THE RESULTS OF OUR INQUIRY
STRIKE YOU AS QUESTIONABLE,

239
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:02,500
- I SUGGEST YOU CONDUCT
YOUR OWN INVESTIGATION.

240
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:03,875
- DAMN YOUR EYES.

241
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,875
I SAY PHIL AND ZAHHAK
CANNOT HAVE BEEN DEFEATED!

242
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:09,541
- AND IF THEY HAVE,
LORD BARAM? WHAT THEN?

243
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,916
I AM INCLINED TO ACCEPT
THE NEWS GIVEN US,

244
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,250
AND I THINK THAT WE MUST MOVE
ON AND ADDRESS YOUR IMPRUDENCE.

245
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:22,083
FIRST, THERE IS THE UNSETTLING
MATTER OF YOUR MALICIOUS REMARKS

246
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:25,708
CONCERNING OUR YOUNG HERO,
AKATSUKI. WILL YOU RECANT?

247
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,833
- ( sighing )

248
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:31,250
- AKATSUKI.

249
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:36,750
- I'VE FURTHER DARK NEWS TO LAY
AT YOUR FEET, YOUR MAJESTY.

250
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,791
ACCORDING TO OUR
FINEST INTELLIGENCE,

251
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:42,166
THE DISDIAN FORCES STATIONED AT
THE BORDER HAVE BEEN WIPED OUT.

252
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,500
REPORTS SAY THEY
AND THE SHELLFEED ARMY

253
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,791
WERE DESCENDED UPON
BY THRALLS OF THE DARK CLAN.

254
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:49,833
- ( gasping )

255
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:52,500
- ( giggling )

256
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,500
- THANK YOU, SLEIPNIR.

257
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,458
YOU REALLY CAME THROUGH FOR US
BOTH AT THE MOMENT OF TRUTH.

258
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:05,333
AND YOU. AREN'T YOU WORRIED
ABOUT CATCHING A COLD?

259
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,583
- AH. I FELL FOR THIS
ONCE BEFORE.

260
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:15,208
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT ASLEEP,
RIGHT? WHATEVER.

261
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:20,833
- Soldier: 36TH CAVALRY IS READY
TO DEPART. TO ARMS, SOLDIERS.

262
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,833
- Second Soldier: WIZARD
BATTALION, READY TO DEPART.

263
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,875
TO ARMS, SOLDIERS.

264
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:26,291
- Third Soldier: LOOK SHARP.

265
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,625
DON'T WANT TO KEEP THOSE
DARK CLAN RUFFIANS WAITING.

266
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:33,458
- JUST SO YOU KNOW, I STILL
MEAN WHAT I SAID THAT DAY.

267
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:37,916
IF YOU EVER NEED ME FOR
ANYTHING, CALL ME AND I'M THERE.

268
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,833
ALL I'M ASKING FOR
IS A LITTLE GOOD FAITH.

269
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,625
- ( sobs ) AKATSUKI.

270
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,166
- GUESS IT'S TIME
TO GET A MOVE ON.

271
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,458
- Miu: SO, YEAH.

272
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:58,000
THIS MIGHT BE A TEENSY BIT
DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN.

273
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,583
UM, IN YOUR SHOES,

274
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,583
I'D BE KINDA CURIOUS
ABOUT THE BIG BLOW-UP

275
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,458
DURING THE RANKING
MATCHES AND ALL, TOO.

276
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:08,208
AND, YOU KNOW,
ABOUT WHO I REALLY AM.

277
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,416
( screaming )

278
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,666
- OH, GOOD.
THEY'RE SQUISHY.

279
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,958
SORRY. YOU WERE STARTING
TO ACT KINDA WOODEN THERE.

280
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:16,208
I NEEDED TO FONDLE
THESE PUPPIES

281
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,083
TO GET A SENSE OF YOUR
EMOTIONAL STATE,

282
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:20,000
WOUND UP GETTING
A LITTLE WOODEN MYSELF.

283
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,416
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?
I'M TRYING TO BE SERIOUS HERE.

284
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,958
- ( Akatsuki grunting )

285
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:27,250
- BOOBS ARE SQUISHY REGARDLESS
OF EMOTIONAL STATE, MORON.

286
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:30,041
- HOW ABOUT THAT?
YOUR POSTURE'S IMPROVED.

287
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,458
- WHAT?

288
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:34,458
- LOOK, I REALIZE COMING CLEAN
ISN'T EASY FOR YOU, BUT,

289
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:37,041
IZUMI AND KUZUHA AREN'T
EXACTLY GOBSMACKED

290
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:39,166
BY WHAT THEY'VE SEEN SO FAR.

291
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,625
- WORTH BEARING IN MIND.
- OH.

292
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:46,750
- I'M SORRY. IT'S JUST...
- AW, C'MON, SWEETS.

293
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:49,500
- AT THIS POINT WE'RE IN FOR THE
LONG HAUL, SO NO WORRIES, YEAH?

294
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,250
WHATEVER YOU GOT TO SAY,
WE'RE HERE TO LISTEN.

295
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,708
JUST TAKE YOUR TIME.

296
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:55,000
THERE'S LIKE ZERO PRESSURE.
YOU'RE AMONG FRIENDS HERE.

297
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,375
- NOT THAT WE'RE NOT PLEASED
YOU BROUGHT US HERE, OUSAWA,

298
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,958
BUT IT'S PROBABLY BEST IF YOU
WAIT OUTSIDE WHILE WE TALK.

299
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,250
SOMETIMES IT'S EASIER FOR A GIRL

300
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,750
TO GET IMPORTANT
STUFF OFF HER CHEST

301
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:05,333
WHEN THERE'S NOT A GUY
IN THE ROOM FONDLING IT.

302
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:08,416
- OKAY. NO PROB, LADIES.
I'M OUTTA HERE.

303
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,458
- ( door closing )

304
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:11,583
- OKAY, YOU GUYS.

305
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,083
( Miu crying )

306
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,833
- ATTA GIRL, MIU.
GET IT OUTTA YOUR SYSTEM.

307
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,500
- RIGHT, GANG, LISTEN UP.

308
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,208
I HAVE TO BOOK IT TO SOME
UNFINISHED BUSINESS

309
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,666
QUITE A WAYS OFF FROM HERE.

310
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,875
MAY TAKE A WHILE.

311
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,375
ALTHOUGH I GUESS FROM
YOUR POINT OF VIEW,

312
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,166
I'LL ONLY BEGONE FOR A MOMENT.

313
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:34,250
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? HOLD ON
A SEC. YOU DON'T MEAN THERE?

314
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:35,458
- ALAYZARD, YEAH.

315
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,083
I HAVE TO NIP THIS
WHOLE THING IN THE BUD

316
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,666
BEFORE THEY SEND SOMEONE ELSE.

317
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,125
NOT TO WORRY YOU, BUT THE FACT
THEY TRACKED YOU DOWN SO QUICKLY

318
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,625
MAKES ME THINK SOMEBODY
MEANT FOR ME TO BRING YOU HERE.

319
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,250
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

320
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,000
- THE SMART MONEY SAYS
THERE'S TROUBLE BREWING

321
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,583
OVER THERE IN A MAJOR WAY.

322
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,541
I NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S GOING DOWN.

323
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:54,875
YOU COMING WITH?

324
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:00,416
- HUH?
- NO. SERIOUSLY?

325
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,166
ALL RIGHT THEN.

326
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,791
- ( sighs) THIS IS ABSURD.

327
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,125
WHAT ON EARTH DO I HOPE
TO ACCOMPLISH?

328
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,666
HE'S GOING TO THINK I'M...

329
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,125
- Motoharu: HEY, HEY, HEY.
'SUP, FANCY MEETING YOU HERE.

330
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:18,791
- ( screams )

331
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,041
- DON'T, DON'T SNEAK UP
ON ME LIKE THAT.

332
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,958
WHY IN HEAVEN'S
NAME ARE YOU HERE?

333
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,875
- YOU KNOW, I COULD
ASK A CERTAIN VICE PREZ

334
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:27,458
THE SAME THING, ACCEPT I
WOULDN'T SHRIEK IT AT HER.

335
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,666
- I'M SORRY.

336
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,291
I'VE SIMPLY COME
TO HAND SOMETHING OFF

337
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,458
AS A FAVOR TO PROFESSOR KUBOTA,
NOTHING MORE.

338
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,208
- OUT OF CURIOSITY, HOW
LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE?

339
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,208
- OH. JUST WALKED UP.

340
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,541
- NEVER MIND, THEN.
I WAS JUST WONDERING.

341
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,375
FUNNY THAT WE SHOWED UP
AT THE SAME TIME.

342
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,458
- YEAH, ACTUALLY I'VE
BEEN CHILLING IN THE TREE

343
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:46,833
FOR AN HOUR.

344
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:49,666
- YOU WERE SPYING ON ME?
TO WHAT PURPOSE?

345
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,125
- HEY, NOW.

346
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:52,500
I'D HAVE SAID SOMETHING BUT
YOU WERE ACTING SO WEIRD,

347
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,166
I WASN'T REALLY SURE
HOW TO BREAK THE ICE.

348
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,708
- OH MY GOD.

349
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,500
WELL, AT LEAST HAVE THE TACT
TO PRETEND YOU DIDN'T SEE ME

350
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,375
ACTING ALL STRANGELY.

351
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:00,875
- ( metallic buzzing )

352
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,833
- IS THAT?
THAT'S A DIMENSIONAL SHIFT.

353
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:09,125
- UGH. OF COURSE IT IS.
- WAIT FOR ME!

354
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:18,791
- GOOD. NICE, DEEP BREATHS.

355
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,750
FORM A PICTURE OF ALAYZARD
IN YOUR MIND AND HOLD IT.

356
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,416
- ( theme song playing )

357
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,125
- THAT'S THE WAY.
- STOP THIS INSTANT.

358
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,458
- JUST WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

359
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:33,958
- Miu: OH, IT'S THE VP,
AND MOTOHARU?

360
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,666
- Akatsuki: YO, APPRECIATE
YOU COMING TO SEE US OFF.

361
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,541
CATCH YA LATER.

362
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,583
- Motoharu: MM, HM. WHOOPSIE.

363
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,833
- WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?
- CUT ME SOME SLACK, AKKI.

364
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,833
THE BEST OF US
ARE KLUTZES SOMETIMES.

365
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,041
MY HAND SLIPPED, I SWEAR.

366
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,333
- DO YOU THINK
I WAS BORN YESTERDAY?

367
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:58,666
- OH, GREAT. LOOKS LIKE
THEY'RE ALONG FOR THE RIDE.

368
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,208
- SHOULD BE INTERESTING.

369
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:03,666
- DAMN IT, PEOPLE. THIS ISN'T
A TRIP TO THE MALL YOU KNOW.

370
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,666
- ( gasps )

371
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,791
- JUST HAVE A LITTLE FAITH
IN ME, ALL RIGHT?

372
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,458
BY THE TIME YOU
SECOND-GUESS YOURSELF,

373
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,041
WE'LL HAVE IT ALL SORTED OUT.

374
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,541
OKAY, FOLKS, LET'S DO THIS.

375
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,333
- ( singing in Japanese )
