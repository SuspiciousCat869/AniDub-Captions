1
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:20,583
- WHERE AM I?
- Kuzuha: BABEL'S I.C.U.

2
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:25,166
- KUZUHA.
- HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

3
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,541
- LIKE I TOOK A HIT.

4
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:31,916
- Miu: KUZUHA!

5
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:37,375
- Miu: I'M SORRY, I
DRAGGED YOU INTO THIS.

6
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:38,833
- DID SHE ESCAPE?

7
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:43,000
- THEN WE GOTTA GET HER.

8
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:44,250
- SLOW DOWN.

9
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:46,541
- YOU'RE NOT READY TO BE UP
AND ABOUT.

10
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:48,916
I'M SURE SHE'S ALL RIGHT,
SO, TRY TO RELAX.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,208
AKATSUKI SHOWED UP RIGHT AFTER
IT HAPPENED, SO HE'S ON IT.

12
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:53,833
- HE'LL SAVE HER, YEAH?

13
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:57,291
- OF COURSE HE WILL. THIS IS
AKATSUKI WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

14
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,375
MEANWHILE, YOU JUST TRY
AND GET SOME REST.

15
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,500
NOW, I BETTER FIND THE DOCTOR.

16
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:05,166
THEY'LL WANNA KNOW YOU'RE AWAKE.

17
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:15,000
YOU'RE ONLY IN HERE BECAUSE YOU
PROTECTED ME. I OWE YOU ONE.

18
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:27,291
- Student 1: SO WHAT'S GOING ON?

19
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:34,541
- Student 2: WHATEVER IT IS,
THEY SAID IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

20
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:39,125
- STILL NO LUCK, I KEEP TRYING,
BUT, I JUST CAN'T REACH KYOYA.

21
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:40,666
- WE CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER.

22
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,166
I THOUGHT WE COULD
AT LEAST FILL HIM IN

23
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,500
ON THE SITUATION HERE
BUT I GUESS NOT.

24
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:45,916
SPEAKING OF WHICH,

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,208
HOW ARE THINGS COMING
TOGETHER IN THE CONTROL ROOM?

26
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:51,458
THAT REPAIR WORK NEEDS TO BE
COMPLETED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

27
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:54,750
- THEY'RE 60% OF THE WAY THROUGH
GETTING THE SHIELD BACK ONLINE.

28
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:57,291
- THEY'RE GOING MUCH FASTER
THAN WE HAD EXPECTED THEM TO,

29
00:01:57,375 --> 00:02:01,875
BUT NO MATTER, WE MUST
ACT WHETHER IT'S ON OR NOT.

30
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:03,166
- ( building rumbles )

31
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:07,791
- ( low growl )

32
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:09,416
- Haruka: WHERE IS
IT COMING FROM?

33
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,583
- Minami: OVER THERE.

34
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,333
- WHATEVER IT IS,
IT MUST BE HUGE.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,708
- MAN, YOU'VE GOT
TO BE KIDDING ME.

36
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:23,875
HOW DID THAT LITTLE CHUMP
EVER FORGE A PACT IN ALAYZARD

37
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,916
WITH AN EVIL DRAGON
THE LIKES OF ZAHHAK?

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,791
- ( roars )

39
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,333
- ( theme song playing )

40
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:35,708
- ( singing in Japanese )

41
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:06,916
- ( roaring )

42
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,416
- ZAHHAK EXISTS ON A PLANE
BEYOND THAT OF HUMANITY.

43
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,333
THAT PALADIN COULDN'T
HAVE FORMED A PACT WITH IT.

44
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:17,500
- I GUESS I SHOULD BE IMPRESSED

45
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,666
THAT HE PULLED OFF
THE IMPOSSIBLE.

46
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,583
MAYBE AFTER I BEAT HIM.

47
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,000
- NO, WAIT.

48
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,250
YOU CAN'T SERIOUSLY BE THINKING
OF FIGHTING RIGHT NOW.

49
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,958
- YOU'RE STILL WEAKENED
FROM THE POISON.

50
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,666
- YEAH, I'M AWARE OF THAT.

51
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,583
- BUT HE'S NOT GONNA SIT BACK
AND WAIT FOR ME TO FEEL BETTER,

52
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,625
I'LL CLEAN HIS CLOCK SOMEHOW.

53
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,375
- AKATSUKI, LISTEN TO ME.

54
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:37,583
YOU'RE THE ONLY
PERSON IN THIS WORLD

55
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,041
WHO HAS A CHANCE OF BEATING HIM,

56
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,125
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED
ALL YOUR STRENGTH TO DO IT.

57
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:44,083
AND THAT MEANS THAT, I'M GOING
TO SERVE AS YOUR DECOY.

58
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,541
I'LL KEEP HIM DISTRACTED
AS LONG AS I CAN.

59
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,666
ONCE YOU'VE RECOVERED,
THEN YOU TAKE OVER.

60
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,125
- MIU, THAT'S CRAZY TALK.
YOU CAN'T FIGHT HIM.

61
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,375
- STUPID POISON.

62
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:01,416
- COME JOIN ME AS SOON AS
YOU'RE BETTER, OKAY?

63
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,250
DON'T MAKE ME WAIT TOO LONG.

64
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,875
I'M THE ONE YOU
CAME HERE TO KILL.

65
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:26,666
SO, COME AND GET ME.

66
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,666
- LISTEN UP. CRAZY REPORTS
ARE COMING IN FROM BASE CAMP.

67
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,208
SOMETHING ABOUT A HUGE DRAGON
APPEARING IN THE MOUNTAINS.

68
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,708
THEY SAY IT'S TAKEN TO THE AIR,

69
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,625
AND IT'S HEADED STRAIGHT FOR
THE URBAN TRAINING DISTRICT.

70
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:37,833
- A DRAGON?

71
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:39,458
- WHAT IN THE HELL IS GOING
ON OUT THERE?

72
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:43,083
- DON'T LOSE FOCUS. THE MORE WE
KNOW, THE SAFER THE KIDS ARE.

73
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,208
- I HOPE, YOU'RE UP TO
THIS FIGHT, AKATSUKI.

74
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,833
HELL OF A LOT IS RIDING ON IT.

75
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,833
- ( growls)

76
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:05,250
- Miu: I'M SORRY,
I DRAGGED YOU INTO THIS.

77
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,208
- IF YOU THINK I'D
LET YOU GO IT ALONE,

78
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,666
THEN YOU DON'T KNOW ME VERY
WELL AT ALL, MIU.

79
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,500
IS THAT AKATSUKI?

80
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:20,125
- I SEE. SO, YOUR SISTER
IS FIGHTING EVEN AS WE SPEAK?

81
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,500
- YEAH.

82
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,166
- THAT STUFF
HE POISONED YOU WITH,

83
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,166
WILL IT GO AWAY ON IT'S OWN
OR DO YOU NEED AN ANTIDOTE?

84
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,125
- NEITHER, SEE, I'VE CRANKED UP
MY METABOLISM.

85
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:33,041
IT'S LIKE A CHEAT-CODE THAT
ALLOWS ME TO PROCESS THIS CRAP.

86
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,708
ENERGY MANIPULATION
COMES IN HANDY AGAIN.

87
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,291
THE MOMENT I'M FEELING
BACK TO NORMAL,

88
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,750
I'M KICKING HIS SCALY ASS.

89
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:43,833
- I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT.
BUT IN THE MEANTIME...

90
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,625
- ( sighs ) LEMME GUESS.

91
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:49,875
YOU WANT IN ON THE DECOY THING.
LOOK, YOU ARE A LITTLE BAD-ASS.

92
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:52,708
BUT HOW CAN I SEND A KID
TO DO MY JOB FOR ME?

93
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,333
- TWO OF US OUT THERE
IS BETTER THAN ONE.

94
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,791
MIU'S ODDS OF SURVIVAL
GO UP THIS WAY.

95
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,916
- Chikage: YOU KNOW, GIRL?
NOT TO ONE-UP YOU,

96
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,958
BUT THREE OF US
WOULD BE BETTER THAN TWO.

97
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:04,625
AS YOU WERE LEAVING
MY HOSPITAL ROOM,

98
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,166
YOU HAD THIS LOOK IN YOUR EYES,

99
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,875
LIKE YOU WERE GONNA
DO SOMETHING FOOLISH

100
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:09,791
AND WAY OUTSIDE YOUR PAY-GRADE.

101
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:12,333
- SO, I GOT OUT OF BED
AND FOLLOWED YOU HERE.

102
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:13,916
- IZUMI.

103
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,541
YOUR SISTER'S DAMN HOT
AND SHE'S A GOOD FRIEND.

104
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,583
IF SHE NEEDS HELP,
COUNT ME IN.

105
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,625
- WHAT IS WITH YOU
CHICKS TONIGHT?

106
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,541
- I HATE TO BREAK IT
TO YOU, BUDDY,

107
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,041
BUT WE'VE ALREADY
MADE UP OUR MINDS

108
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,666
THAT WE'RE GOING TO HELP MIU.

109
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,041
THAT SAID, WOULD
IT REALLY KILL YOU

110
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,041
TO GIVE US A LITTLE
VOTE OF CONFIDENCE?

111
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,000
- DAMN IT ALL.

112
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,541
FINE, KNOCK YOURSELVES OUT.

113
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,666
BUT DON'T DO ANYTHING
ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS,

114
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,083
OR SO HELP ME I WILL SPANK
THE BOTH OF YOU.

115
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,083
AND THAT GOES DOUBLE
FOR YOU, SHORT-STUFF.

116
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,500
DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR?

117
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,916
- YES. WE'LL BE CAREFUL.
LET'S HOP ON, IZUMI.

118
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
- RIGHT.

119
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,375
- AW, COME ON.

120
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,750
SHE GETS A RIDE, AND I HAVE
TO WALK TO THE DRAGON?

121
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,958
- YOU'RE STILL POISONED,
YOU SAID SO YOURSELF.

122
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:53,375
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE FOR YOU
TO PROCESS WHAT'S LEFT?

123
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,083
- I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I'M PRACTICALLY BETTER...

124
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,250
- YOU NEED TO GIVE ME
A NUMBER, AKATSUKI.

125
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,875
WE NEED TO KNOW EXACTLY HOW
LONG WE HAVE TO HOLD OUT

126
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,041
BEFORE YOU'LL BE BATTLE READY.

127
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,041
- ( sighs )
I GUESS YOU HAVE A POINT.

128
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:29,291
- THAT'S ENOUGH.

129
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,875
JUST AS I THOUGHT.
LIKE ANY DRAGON,

130
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,791
THIS ONE HAS INBORN
PROTECTIONS AGAINST MAGIC.

131
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,166
- ( roars )

132
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:44,000
ALL RIGHT THEN,
HOW ABOUT THIS.

133
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,833
- ( groans )

134
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,833
IT NULLIFIED MY MAGIC STAFF
WITH A SINGLE TOUCH.

135
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,333
- ( roars )

136
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,916
- HARUKA, WHY ARE YOU HERE?

137
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,208
- JUST BE GLAD I DIDN'T
GET HERE ANY LATER.

138
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:04,541
- YEAH, I'LL SAY.

139
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,125
- WHERE'S THAT HOT SHOT BROTHER
OF YOURS, ANYWAY?

140
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,208
HE SHOULD BE THOROUGHLY
ASHAMED OF HIMSELF.

141
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,541
LETTING YOU GO HEAD TO HEAD WITH
A CREATURE OF THIS MAGNITUDE

142
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:18,625
ALL ON YOUR OWN.

143
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,875
I MEAN, HOW COULD
HE BE SO COWARDLY?

144
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:23,708
- AKATSUKI'S STILL GETTING OVER
A POISON ATTACK FROM EARLIER.

145
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:27,166
HE NEEDS A LITTLE MORE TIME TO
RECUPERATE SO HE CAN BE AT 100%.

146
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,875
I'M TRYING TO KEEP
THE DRAGON DISTRACTED

147
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,708
UNTIL HE'S READY TO FIGHT AGAIN.

148
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,750
- FAIR ENOUGH, THEN.

149
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,250
THOUGH I HOPE HE'S NOT OFFENDED

150
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:38,500
IF WE TAKE CARE OF THIS
THING BEFORE HE WAKES UP.

151
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,041
- Ryohei: HERE WE GO,

152
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,458
DIDN'T THINK I'D BE DOING THIS
WHEN I GOT UP THIS MORNING.

153
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,250
- BE CAREFUL, EVERYONE.

154
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,333
AGAINST A CREATURE
OF THIS MAGNITUDE,

155
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:49,833
MAGIC WON'T DO ANYTHING.

156
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:52,375
- THANKFULLY, THAT ONLY
APPLIES TO MAGICAL ATTACKS

157
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,791
THAT AREN'T ANCHORED
TO A PHYSICAL CATALYST,

158
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,333
THESE SHOULD KEEP HIM BUSY.

159
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:04,708
- ( growls )

160
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,333
- LET'S DO SOME DAMAGE.

161
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:19,833
- HA.

162
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,041
- ( roars angrily )

163
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,791
- LET'S SEE IF YOUR BARK
IS WORSE THAN YOUR BITE.

164
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,083
IT'S FOUR AGAINST ONE,
SO YOU HAD BETTER GET READY.

165
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,083
- OH, MAN, YOU FELL FOR THAT?

166
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,458
WHOA, NOT GOOD.

167
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,000
- IT'S MY TURN.

168
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,416
WAIT, KUZUHA?

169
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:09,750
AND CHIKAGE.

170
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,875
- HOW'S IT HANGING?
MIND IF WE TAG IN?

171
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,583
- DON'T EVEN BOTHER.
MAGIC DOESN'T WORK AGAINST IT.

172
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,416
- THEN HOW ABOUT SCIENCE?

173
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:29,291
- THAT SPELL GATHERS HYDROGEN
FROM THE AIR AROUND IT,

174
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:32,625
PACKS IT TOGETHER AS TIGHTLY AS
IT CAN, AND LIGHTS IT ON FIRE.

175
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,083
I'M ROCKING THAT DRAGON'S WORLD

176
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,541
WITH SOME NATURALLY
OCCURRING PYROTECHNICS.

177
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,125
LET'S HEAR IT FOR
CHEMISTRY CLASS.

178
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,416
- ( growls )

179
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,541
- THIRTY MINUTES
TILL WE CAN RETREAT.

180
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:43,333
- HUH?

181
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:44,625
- THIRTY MINUTES FROM NOW,

182
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:45,458
YOUR BIG BROTHER WILL
HAVE NEUTRALIZED

183
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,041
THE LAST OF THE POISON.

184
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,208
UNTIL HE DOES,
WE HAVE TO BE STRONG.

185
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,208
- SO, YOU RAN INTO HIM
ON THE WAY OVER?

186
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:52,375
- UH, HUH. THAT'S RIGHT.

187
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,083
HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT
US GETTING INVOLVED,

188
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,750
BUT HE COULDN'T ARGUE
WITH OUR LOGIC.

189
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,541
- THANK YOU BOTH.
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

190
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,708
THIRTY MINUTES LEFT,
WE CAN DO IT.

191
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:02,708
- ( yells )

192
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:13,916
- HUH?

193
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,541
- NOT ON MY WATCH.

194
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,666
- I DON'T WANNA PULL MY PUNCHES.

195
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,166
- THEN LET'S GIVE
IT ALL WE'VE GOT.

196
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:43,375
- ( roars )

197
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:56,125
- ( grunts )
LET'S HEAT THINGS UP.

198
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,916
- I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DO IT,

199
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,791
BUT DADDY'S SPECIAL MOVE
COULD BE WHAT WE NEED.

200
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,833
IT'S NOT ENOUGH,
I NEED MORE POWER.

201
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:19,958
I NEED MORE.

202
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,083
NOW, DIE.

203
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,375
- EVERYONE, ATTACK.

204
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,000
- IT'S A TRAP.
RUN FOR COVER.

205
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:42,375
- TOO LITTLE TOO LATE.

206
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,666
- WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

207
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,791
OH, NO, PLEASE.

208
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,875
- HOW DOES IT FEEL, WENCH?

209
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,708
HAVING VICTORY WELL
WITHIN YOUR GRASP,

210
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:11,000
ONLY TO HAVE IT YANKED AWAY
IN THE FINAL MOMENT?

211
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:14,041
NOW, THEN, YOU'VE HAD YOUR FUN.

212
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,833
IT'S HIGH TIME WE RETURNED
TO ALAYZARD.

213
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,041
- THIS ISN'T OVER.

214
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:21,125
I'LL NEVER SURRENDER TO
SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

215
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,333
- I ADMIRE YOUR RESOLVE.

216
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,166
EVEN AFTER
SUBJECTING YOUR FRIENDS

217
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,833
AND A SCHOOL FULL OF PEOPLE

218
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:31,208
WITH WHOM I HAD NO QUARREL,
TO MY DEADLY WRATH, YOU DENY ME.

219
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,000
SHALL I END MORE LIVES THEN?

220
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,666
UNTIL YOUR ATTITUDE GROWS
MORE TRACTABLE?

221
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,583
OR WILL YOU COME QUIETLY?

222
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,375
WHAT WILL IT BE, DARK ONE?

223
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,666
YOU HAVE CHOSEN WISELY.

224
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,000
GO TO YOUR DOOM,

225
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,041
KNOWING THAT YOUR SACRIFICE
PRESERVES THE WORLD

226
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,666
IN WHICH YOU TRIED
TO FIND REFUGE.

227
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:58,416
- WHY DID YOU FIGHT ME?
YOU COULD NOT WIN.

228
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,166
- NO, MAYBE I COULDN'T.

229
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,666
- BUT, I DON'T CARE.
I HAD TO TRY EITHER WAY.

230
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,708
EVER SINCE MY FATHER DIED,
I'VE BEEN RUNNING AWAY.

231
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,625
RUNNING FROM THE
PAIN OF LOSING HIM

232
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,458
AND FROM MY BIRTHRIGHT.

233
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:13,500
BUT THEN I STOPPED RUNNING,
THANKS TO AKATSUKI.

234
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,750
- YOUR HUBRIS IS LAUGHABLE.

235
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,208
WHAT COULD THAT MEDDLING
FRAUD POSSIBLY HAVE SAID

236
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,583
TO BUOY YOUR SPIRIT?

237
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:22,208
- YOU HAVE NO RIGHT
TO SPEAK ILL OF HIM.

238
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:23,541
FOR ALL HIS FAULTS,

239
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:26,125
HE'S MORE OF A HERO THAN
YOU COULD EVER HOPE TO BE.

240
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,791
HE'S GENUINE AND HE'S BRAVE,

241
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:31,166
AND HE DOESN'T CARE WHAT
PEOPLE THINK OF HIM.

242
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,458
EVEN IF YOU DRAG ME
BACK TO ALAYZARD

243
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,416
AND HANG ME FROM
THE HIGHEST TOWER,

244
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,875
YOU WILL NEVER BE A HERO
THE WAY AKATSUKI IS!

245
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,666
YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A SHAM.

246
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,666
A FAKER, WITH ASHES
IN YOUR HEART.

247
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:47,416
KNOW THIS, NO MATTER HOW MUCH
THE PEOPLE MAY PRAISE YOU,

248
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,083
YOU'RE NOTHING BUT
A THUG WITH A SWORD.

249
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,416
WHEN A WARRIOR RISKS LIFE

250
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,583
AND LIMB TO DO BATTLE
WITH A DARK LORD,

251
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,916
ONLY THEN WILL
THEY BE DEEMED A HERO.

252
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,083
IT IS AN HONOR THEY BESTOW
UPON VALIANT FOES,

253
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,833
FOES LIKE AKATSUKI.

254
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:05,125
BUT YOU? I'LL NEVER
ACKNOWLEDGE YOU AS A HERO.

255
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:07,833
N MATTER WHAT SORT OF PAIN
YOU PUT ME THROUGH.

256
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:10,333
AKATSUKI OUSAWA
IS ALL THE HERO I NEED.

257
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,333
NEXT TO HIM, YOU'RE NOTHING.

258
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:15,666
- STRANGE HOW YOU HEAP PRAISE
UPON YOUR FATHER'S KILLER

259
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:19,083
IF HE IS INDEED A HERO,
WHY HAVE YOU NOT SLAIN HIM?

260
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,625
I THOUGHT A DARK LORD
WOULD EXHIBIT

261
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,791
MORE LOYALTY TO HER KIND?

262
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:25,291
- IT'S TRUE THAT I'M
THE CHILD OF A DARK LORD

263
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,333
BUT MY FATHER WAS THE LAST.

264
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:30,416
THE PEOPLE OF ALAYZARD DON'T
HAVE TO LIVE IN FEAR ANYMORE.

265
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,666
I DON'T WANT TO FOLLOW
IN MY FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS,

266
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,166
I'M GIVING UP ON ALL THAT.

267
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,833
I JUST WANNA STAY
HERE WITH AKATSUKI

268
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,916
AND LIVE LIKE ANY OTHER
HIGH SCHOOL GIRL.

269
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,166
WHY ISN'T THAT GOOD ENOUGH,
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO DRAG ME BACK?

270
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:46,083
- DO YOU THINK YOU CAN ABANDON
YOUR PAST SO EASILY?

271
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:49,291
- I NEVER SAID IT WOULD BE EASY.
BUT I'VE MADE MY CHOICE.

272
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,416
- YOUR LOGIC IS THAT
OF A SOFT-MINDED CHILD.

273
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,791
IF YOU ARE NO DARK LORD, THEN
YOU CANNOT DEEM HIM A HERO,

274
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:59,500
NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU
MAY WHINE TO THE CONTRARY.

275
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,416
- YOU MAY BE RIGHT.

276
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,875
BUT I DON'T CARE ABOUT
THE TECHNICALITIES.

277
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,291
HE'S A HERO TO ME, AND
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS

278
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:10,333
EVEN IF NO ONE ELSE SEES IT,
HE'S MY KNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOR.

279
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:13,333
AND THE WORDS DON'T EXIST
THAT'LL CHANGE MY MIND.

280
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:16,083
- IN THAT CASE, I SUPPOSE
THERE'S NOTHING MORE TO SAY.

281
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:21,625
- YOU'RE GONNA TAKE ME BACK
TO ALAYZARD HERE AND NOW?

282
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,916
- TO HE WHO HAS FORGED
A PACT WITH A DRAGON,

283
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,458
SUCH A TASK IS SIMPLE.

284
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,875
I CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH YOU DIE,

285
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:32,500
TALK OF AKATSUKI'S HEROISM
DYING ON YOUR LIPS.

286
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:35,125
AS YOUR SOUL SPIRALS
INTO THE DARKNESS,

287
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:38,541
YOU'LL FINALLY REALIZE THAT
NEITHER YOUR WORLD NOR THIS ONE,

288
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,416
HOLDS ANY PLACE FOR YOU.

289
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,750
- I DON'T BELONG IN EITHER
WORLD, I KNOW THAT.

290
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:46,000
BUT I DON'T CARE ANYMORE.
BECAUSE WHEN I'M WITH HIM,

291
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,416
WHEN I'M WITH AKATSUKI OUSAWA,

292
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,250
I'M IN THE RIGHT PLACE
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

293
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,791
- I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF YOUR
INANE BLATHERING.

294
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,416
- ( grunts )

295
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:17,666
- ( screams )

296
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:26,208
- YOU CAME FOR ME.
- YEAH.

297
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:34,583
TAKE THE OTHERS
AND GET TO SAFETY.

298
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,333
- YOU'VE FOUGHT MY BATTLE
FOR LONG ENOUGH.

299
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,875
- PLEASE, BE CAREFUL.

300
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:41,041
- DON'T WORRY. YOUR FATHER
DIDN'T MAKE A MISTAKE

301
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,625
WHEN HE ENTRUSTED YOU TO ME.

302
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,875
- I'M NOT GONNA LET
YOU DOWN, MIU.

303
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,708
- HMM.

304
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,416
- HOW DISAPPOINTING.

305
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,708
I WAS RATHER HOPING
YOU'D FOLLOW US BACK,

306
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,333
AND I'D GET THE CHANCE
TO CUT YOU OPEN

307
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,666
IN FRONT OF QUEEN LISTY HERSELF.

308
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,125
THE LOOK ON HER FACE
WOULD'VE BEEN PRICELESS.

309
00:18:57,208 --> 00:19:01,666
BUT NO MATTER, KILLING YOU RIGHT
HERE WILL MORE THAN SUFFICE.

310
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,125
- ( grunts )

311
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,791
- HERE'S A LITTLE LOVE-TAP
TO GET THE PARTY STARTED.

312
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,625
SO, NOW YOU'RE TRYING
TO POISON MY SWORD?

313
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:27,083
FINE. I'VE GOT A FEW
TRICKS UP MY SLEEVE TOO.

314
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,666
LET'S SEE HOW YOU LIKE THEM.

315
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,958
THIS IS GETTING OLD REAL FAST.

316
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:49,291
- ( grunts )

317
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,416
- BASTARD!

318
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,375
- ( screams )

319
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,500
- WAS THAT SUPPOSED TO HURT?
- COME ON ALREADY.

320
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:47,208
- IT'S TIME WE BRING
THIS GAME TO AN END.

321
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,375
WHAT THE...

322
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,541
- HUH. LOOKS LIKE MY SURPRISE
IS STARTING TO TAKE EFFECT.

323
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:00,000
- SO, WHAT IF MY HITS

324
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,750
DIDN'T TAKE ANY OF
THE OOMPH OUT OF YOU?

325
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,875
IT LOOKS LIKE MY ENERGY MADE
IT'S WAY INTO YOUR BODY

326
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,958
JUST FINE, YOU LIKE THAT?

327
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,333
- DON'T DELUDE YOURSELF
INTO THINKING YOUR ATTACKS

328
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,916
ARE EQUAL TO MINE.

329
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,500
- MINE ARE BETTER,
AS YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE.

330
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,541
BRING IT ON! I'M GONNA DEFLECT
YOUR ATTACK SO HARD,

331
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,541
IT WILL KNOCK YOUR
DAMN TEETH OUT.

332
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:23,500
- ( growls )

333
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:36,375
- ( gasps )

334
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:41,541
- GET OUT OF HERE!

335
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,250
- ( theme song playing )

336
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:50,750
- ( singing in Japanese )

337
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:20,125
- Listy: SAY WHAT YOU WILL,
BUT AKATSUKI BEGRUDGED NO ONE,

338
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:22,916
WHEN HIS STATUS AS HERO
CAME UNDER DISPUTE.

339
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,250
HE MAY BE SHOWY,

340
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:26,708
AND LOUD AND BURDENED
WITH A SURFEIT OF LIBIDO,

341
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:29,083
BUT AS THE PERSON HERE
WHO KNEW HIM BEST,

342
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:31,708
I BELIEVE THAT AT HIS CORE
HE WILL NEVER WAVER,

343
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:34,250
NO MATTER HOW DIRE
THE SITUATION.

344
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:37,541
THERE ARE BELIEFS TO WHICH
THAT MAN SHALL ALWAYS SUBSCRIBE.

345
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,708
HE MUST.

346
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:42,750
NEXT EPISODE:
"THE WORLD IS WATCHING YOU."

347
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:44,291
I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN
THE PROMISE YOU MADE

348
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:46,583
WHEN WE PARTED WAYS, AKATSUKI.
