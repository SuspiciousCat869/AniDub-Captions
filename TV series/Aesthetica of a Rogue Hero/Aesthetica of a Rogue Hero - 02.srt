1
00:00:08,416 --> 00:00:12,625
- ( clock ticking )

2
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:35,416
- Garius: WARRIOR
FROM LANDS UNKNOWN,

3
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:38,791
I LEAVE MY DAUGHTER,

4
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:41,583
FLESH OF MY FLESH,
TO YOUR CARE.

5
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:51,125
- Akatsuki: COME ON.

6
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:59,666
- FATHER, I DON'T
THINK I CAN DO THIS.

7
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:00,916
- ( sobs )

8
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:06,541
- ( theme song playing )

9
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:07,833
- ( singing in Japanese )

10
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,041
- ( door opens )

11
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,375
- TREAD LIGHTLY, ROGUE HERO.

12
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:53,041
MY FATHER GAVE ME EXPRESS
PERMISSION TO SLAY

13
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,750
WHOSOEVER PRESUMED
TO BE MY GUARDIAN

14
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,916
IF I FOUND THEM WANTING.

15
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,750
FAIL TO MEASURE UP,
AND YOUR HEAD IS MINE.

16
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:19,375
- ( gasps )

17
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,291
- Miu: YOU STAY BY ME,

18
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,583
I CAN'T GUARANTEE
YOUR SURVIVAL.

19
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:40,583
DID HE SENSE THAT DARKNESS?

20
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:43,875
- ( screams )

21
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:58,000
- TIMID BABES JUST DO IT
FOR ME, SWEET CHEEKS.

22
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,583
AND IT'S GOTTA BE
SAID, RED SUITS YOU.

23
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:03,833
- STOP! WHATEVER YOU'RE
THINKING I WANT NO PART OF IT!

24
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:06,833
- AW, BUT YOU'RE
SO HOT. PLAY FAIR.

25
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,875
AT LEAST GIMME A NAME.

26
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,083
- WAIT A SECOND.

27
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:14,625
HE'S SAYING ALL
THIS IN HIS SLEEP!

28
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:17,041
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!
I'M NOT THAT KIND OF GIRL!

29
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,625
YOU HAVE TO WAKE UP!

30
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,625
- DON'T FIGHT IT, YOU
MIGHT ENJOY YOURSELF.

31
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,375
- THAT'S NOT THE POINT!

32
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,416
WAIT! THAT'S MY
BLOUSE! GIVE IT BACK!

33
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,333
- ( she screams )

34
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,875
- NO!

35
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,666
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS,
BUT I KNOW IT'S NOT RIGHT!

36
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,916
OH, MY GOODNESS.
WHAT DO I DO?

37
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,958
BROTHER!

38
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:39,250
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
I'M YOUR KID SISTER,

39
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,166
YOU CAN'T TREAT ME LIKE THIS!

40
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,166
YOU SHOULD PROTECT ME,
NOT VIOLATE ME. CREEP!

41
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,000
DID IT WORK?

42
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,583
- I LIKE YOUR STYLE,
BUT THAT'S PRETTY LOW.

43
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,291
MY KID SISTER IS DEAD.

44
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,208
- ( shrieks )

45
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,125
STOP! WHAT ARE
YOU DOING TO ME?

46
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,625
I'M NOT OKAY WITH THIS!

47
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:11,500
OH, MY. IT DOES FEEL
KIND OF AMAZING, THOUGH.

48
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,750
- ( yells loudly )

49
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:20,916
- Akatsuki: OH! MY HEAD
FEELS LIKE A MOSH PIT.

50
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,375
NOT A GOOD THING.

51
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,125
COULD BE CATCHING A COLD.

52
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,625
- I'M SURE IT'S NOTHING. YOU
PROBABLY JUST SLEPT WRONG.

53
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,208
WHY IS EVERYONE
STARING AT US?

54
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,208
- OH, YOU KNOW.
"NEW KID" THING.

55
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,000
- (door opens )

56
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,666
- DON'T LET IT GET TO YA.

57
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,666
NEW KIDS ALWAYS FASCINATE
THE PEANUT GALLERY.

58
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,083
IT'S THE SAME EVERYWHERE,
STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND,

59
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,166
PEOPLE ARE GONNA GIVE YOU THE
THIRD DEGREE WITH THEIR EYES.

60
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,500
PLAY IT OFF AND
EVENTUALLY THEY'LL LET YOU

61
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,208
BLEND INTO THE BACKGROUND.

62
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,500
- SO, SHOULD I JUST
SIT DOWN ANYWHERE?

63
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:12,083
- PARK YOUR BUTT IN
WHATEVER EMPTY SEAT YOU LIKE.

64
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,041
NEWBIE PRIVILEGE.

65
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,750
- Chikage: I'M LIKING THE
ATTITUDE, BONNIE AND CLYDE.

66
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:19,500
APPARENTLY THE RUMOR MILL
GOT IT RIGHT THIS TIME,

67
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,500
THE TWO OF YOU ARE
GONNA BE A HANDFUL.

68
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,000
ROOKIES ALWAYS GET
TALKED ABOUT, SURE.

69
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,958
BUT, I DON'T KNOW. MY INSTINCTS
TELL ME YOUR REPUTATION

70
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:31,958
FOR BEATING AN INSTRUCTOR'S
ASS IS RIGHT ON THE MONEY.

71
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,791
AND YOU, NOT JUST ANYBODY
COULD CINCH AN ENDORSEMENT

72
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,250
FROM THE STUDENT COUNCIL
PREZ THEIR FIRST TIME OUT.

73
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,958
YOU'VE GIVEN YOURSELF
A LOT TO LIVE UP TO.

74
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,041
BLENDING IN? GOOD LUCK.

75
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,416
- Miu: I DIDN'T MEAN TO...

76
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,250
- LOOK, I'M NOT TRYING TO MAKE
THE TRANSITION HARD FOR YOU,

77
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:48,458
I'M JUST SAYING MAKING B
CLASS YOUR FIRST DAY IS BIG.

78
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,916
MOST OF US HAD TO CLAW ALL
THE WAY UP FROM E CLASS,

79
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,916
BUT IT'S WHATEVER.

80
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,791
- NICE JOB BUTTERING US UP
BEFORE YOU DEAL OUT THE WARNING.

81
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,500
YOU GONNA TELL US A
LITTLE ABOUT YOURSELF?

82
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,541
OR YOU PREFER WE
USE OUR IMAGINATIONS?

83
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,583
- MY NAME'S IZUMI CHIKAGE.

84
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,000
DEFINITELY AN ACQUIRED TASTE,

85
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,250
BUT MAYBE SOMEONE
YOU'LL COME TO RELY ON.

86
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:07,291
NICE TO MEET YOU.

87
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,708
- AKATSUKI OUSAWA.

88
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:12,125
THIS, IS MY LITTLE SISTER MIU.

89
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,375
- I'M VERY PLEASED
TO MEET YOU.

90
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,958
- IF YOU TWO WOULDN'T
MIND SOME ADVICE,

91
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,583
THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

92
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,583
NORMALLY IT'S COOL FOR THE
NOOBS TO SIT ANYWHERE,

93
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,166
BUT HOW SHOULD I PUT THIS?

94
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,791
YOU MIGHT WANNA CONSIDER
PARKING YOUR BUTTS ELSEWHERE.

95
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,333
- ( both exclaim )

96
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:26,791
- Onizuka: HEY, DEAD GUY!

97
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,666
I SURE HOPE YOUR ASS
CAN SETTLE THE TAB

98
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,750
IT JUST OPENED BY
SWIPING MY SEAT!

99
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,791
OUTTA MY WAY, PENIS BREATH.

100
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:35,166
YOU GOT TILL I GET UP THERE
TO MOVE IT OR LOSE IT.

101
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,958
- I DID TRY TO WARN YOU.

102
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,541
THAT'D BE OUR RESIDENT
NEANDERTHAL, ONIZUKA.

103
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,000
HE GOT BOOTED DOWN FROM A
CLASS FOR BEING A DOUCHE NOZZLE.

104
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,625
- HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU!

105
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:44,833
LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY
NEEDS A BREAKDOWN

106
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,791
OF THE UNOFFICIAL RULES.

107
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:50,666
- ( coughs )

108
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,875
WELL, AT LEAST
YOU GOT A PAIR.

109
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,333
YOU'LL NEED
THEM ON MY TURF.

110
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,083
THERE AIN'T NO FREE...

111
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,750
WHOA, DUDE. YOU GOT, LIKE,
A VICE GRIP. EASE UP!

112
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,958
- IN ANOTHER LIFE, DUDE.
WE'D HAVE HAD SOME FUN.

113
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:05,291
SEE, I HAVE THING FOR
BULLYING PEOPLE, TOO.

114
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,000
ESPECIALLY ONES WHO GET THEIR
ROCKS OFF ACTING ALL BOSS.

115
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:10,000
YOU KNOW THE TYPE. ALWAYS
THUMPING THEIR CHEST,

116
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,291
LIKE THE REST OF US ARE LUCKY
TO BREATHE THE SAME AIR?

117
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,333
- ( he groans in pain )

118
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:15,500
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

119
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:16,666
I GOT THE RULES DOWN?

120
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,125
OR WAS THERE SOMETHING
YOU WANTED TO ADD

121
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,333
BEFORE I CRUSH THIS
EMPTY SKULL OF YOURS?

122
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,333
- STOP IT! YOU'VE MADE YOUR
POINT. JUST LET HIM GO!

123
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,000
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO
BE THE PROBLEM CHILD

124
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,791
BETWEEN THE TWO
OF US. LOOK AT YOU!

125
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,250
- UH! HERE COMES THE
JERK-WAD BRIGADE.

126
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,958
- Miu: WHO ARE THEY?

127
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,666
- DISCIPLINE COMMITTEE.

128
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,250
JUST A BUNCH OF CHODES WHO ONLY
ANSWER TO THE STUDENT COUNCIL.

129
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,958
- THIS ISN'T HIS FAULT! YOU
SAW IT, HE WAS PROVOKED!

130
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,500
HE HAS A RIGHT TO
DEFEND HIMSELF!

131
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,166
- Akatsuki: DON'T
WORRY ABOUT IT, SIS.

132
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:51,166
IT'S GOOD FOR ME.

133
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,291
- Girl: YOU WILL TAKE A
SEAT AND WAIT QUIETLY.

134
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:54,666
THE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
WILL ARRIVE

135
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,916
TO DISCUSS THE ISSUE
WITH YOU SHORTLY.

136
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,708
- Akatsuki: HMMM.
TAKE A SEAT, HUH?

137
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:12,041
- Kyoya: NICELY DONE, AKATSUKI.
YOU HAVE VERY GOOD REFLEXES.

138
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,291
- Akatsuki: YOU SON OF A BITCH!

139
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,916
YOU TRYING TO DRAG MY
SISTER INTO THIS?

140
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,708
- Kyoya: LET'S JUST SAY,
GIVEN YOUR REPUTATION,

141
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,250
I DOUBTED SHE WOULD BE IN
MUCH DANGER OF GETTING HURT.

142
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:22,916
- I TRUST YOU'VE
NOT WAITED LONG?

143
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,541
- ( she exclaims )

144
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:27,208
- NO WORRIES. THERE ARE
WORSE WAYS TO SPEND TIME.

145
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,791
- I BEG YOUR PARDON!

146
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,916
THAT CHAIR IS NOT
FOR THE LIKES OF YOU!

147
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,166
KINDLY REMOVE YOURSELF TO
A MORE APPROPRIATE SPOT

148
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,750
AND WE'LL DISCUSS THE INCIDENT
THAT BROUGHT YOU HERE!

149
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,541
- OH, I'M SORRY,
AM I OUT OF LINE?

150
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:40,125
I FIGURED SINCE NO
ONE WAS HERE...

151
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,500
IT'S A CHAIR, RIGHT?
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL

152
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,041
ABOUT SITTING ON A PIECE OF
FURNITURE MEANT TO BE SAT ON?

153
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,958
- VALID POINT. BUT
HARUKA'S ARGUMENT

154
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,291
HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH FURNITURE DESIGN.

155
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,208
- RIGHT. THAT
CHAIR IS RESERVED.

156
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,166
- ( she gasps )

157
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:12,625
- ( she screams )

158
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,250
- WHOA! HE'S
PRETTY GOOD.

159
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,375
- LET'S SEE HOW GOOD!

160
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:29,250
- IF YOU'RE QUITE
DONE TESTING US,

161
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:32,583
BE ADVISED THAT FOR
NOW, WE'RE PLAYING NICE.

162
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:35,333
- Kyoya: WHAT IS THE
MEANING OF THIS, PLEASE?

163
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:38,333
- SERIOUSLY? DON'T TRY TO PULL
THE WHOLE "WHO ME" THING NOW.

164
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:39,958
YOU CALLED ME INTO
YOUR LITTLE OFFICE

165
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,416
TO PICK UP WHERE
WE LEFT OFF YESTERDAY, RIGHT?

166
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,416
- DON'T BE ABSURD.
TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST,

167
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,166
I HAVEN'T THE FAINTEST IDEA
WHY YOU'RE EVEN HERE.

168
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,625
- NO REASON YOU
SHOULD, SIR, I SENT FOR HIM.

169
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,166
THIS ONE IS A MENACE.

170
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,666
THE DISCIPLINE COMMITTEE
APPRISED ME OF HIS OUTBURST.

171
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,125
IT WOULD SEEM HE'S
HAVING DIFFICULTY

172
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,458
ADJUSTING TO LIFE HERE
WITHOUT CAUSING MISCHIEF.

173
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,541
NOT THAT WE'RE UNAPPRECIATIVE.

174
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:02,166
BUT YOUR INTERFERENCE WITH
THAT STUDENT WAS UNNECESSARY,

175
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,208
NOT TO MENTION INAPPROPRIATE.

176
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,541
- HOLD ON A SEC.

177
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,875
I PUT THAT BULLY DOWN, YOU
SHOULD BE THANKING ME.

178
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,916
- I AM WARNING YOU.

179
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,750
YOUR TENURE AT BABEL WILL
BE RIGOROUSLY SCRUTINIZED.

180
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,250
DON'T EXPECT LENIENCY.
IS THAT CLEAR?

181
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,791
THINGS WILL NOT
BODE WELL FOR YOU

182
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,291
SHOULD YOU STEP
OUT OF LINE AGAIN.

183
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,708
WHETHER YOU ACTED IN
SELF-DEFENSE IS NOT THE POINT.

184
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,375
WE RUN A VERY TIGHT SHIP HERE.

185
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,416
THOSE WHO HAVE CONTEMPT
FOR AUTHORITY,

186
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,791
ESPECIALLY STUDENTS
WHO THUMB THEIR NOSES

187
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,708
AT MEMBERS OF THE
STUDENT COUNCIL,

188
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,583
WILL NOT BE AFFORDED MERCY.

189
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:31,666
REMEMBER THAT.

190
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,708
- Kuzuha: I WOULDN'T
DO THAT IF I WERE YOU.

191
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,333
TRY TO GO BACK
IN THERE, I MEAN.

192
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,791
- WELL HEY, LOOK AT THAT.
YOU LOST, LITTLE GIRL?

193
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,833
- WE HAPPEN TO BE
IN THE SAME CLASS.

194
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,083
SO NO, THANK YOU.

195
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,125
MY NAME IS KUZUHA DOUMOTO.

196
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,500
I'M HERE TO TAKE YOU TO
YOUR NEXT PERIOD CLASSROOM.

197
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,958
AND I'M ALSO YOUR
CLASS REPRESENTATIVE.

198
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:15,625
- MUST BE SOMETHING. SKIPPING
SO MANY GRADES LIKE THAT.

199
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:18,666
- I DO OKAY. BUT, JUST
SO YOU'RE AWARE,

200
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,291
THE STUDENT COUNCIL OFFICERS YOU
PICKED A FIGHT WITH BACK THERE

201
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,500
KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

202
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,708
THEY MAKE ME LOOK
LIKE A TOTAL BEGINNER.

203
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,875
MATTER OF FACT, THEY'RE
PRACTICALLY MIND READERS

204
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,750
WHEN IT COMES TO
THEIR OPPONENTS.

205
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,375
- YOU DON'T SAY.
WELL, DAMN.

206
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:34,291
SO MUCH FOR TRYING TO LIGHT A
FIRE UNDER THEIR FEET, I GUESS.

207
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,916
- YOU MUST BE PSYCHOTIC.

208
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,791
- WHAT KIND OF "FIRE"
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

209
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,375
- WATCH AND LEARN, KID.

210
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,541
- AKATSUKI OUSAWA!

211
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,333
THIS CLASSIFIES AS ASSAULT!

212
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,500
- REFERRING TO THESE?

213
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,791
- OUR PRESIDENT MAY HAVE
CHOSEN TO IGNORE YOUR ANTICS,

214
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,708
BUT I AM NOT SO TOLERANT!

215
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,750
YOU'LL BE AN EXAMPLE OF
WHAT HAPPENS TO STUDENTS

216
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,500
WHO ABUSE THEIR PEERS, SIR!

217
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,125
- WHOA! OVERKILL MUCH?

218
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,916
- I'LL MAKE YOU RUE
THE DAY YOU WERE BORN!

219
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,750
THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS TO
INCUR THE WRATH OF THE WIND!

220
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:28,958
HOW DARE HE HUMILIATE ME
WITH HIS CHEAP LITTLE TRICKS?

221
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,291
PERHAPS THIS MOMENT
WILL TEACH HIM A LESSON.

222
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,125
- ( gasps )

223
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,916
- MARK MY WORDS, DELINQUENT.

224
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
THE STUDENT COUNCIL WILL
NOT STAND FOR THIS...

225
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,583
THIS INSOLENCE!

226
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,375
YOUR DAYS AT BABEL
ARE NUMBERED!

227
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:54,125
- SO, MORE LIKE
A BONFIRE, HUH?

228
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,583
- LIKE IT'S ANY FUN JUST
RUBBING TWO STICKS TOGETHER.

229
00:13:58,416 --> 00:13:59,458
- ( all exclaim )

230
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:08,083
- YOU'RE FILLING OUT THAT SUIT
LIKE A PROFESSIONAL, SWEETHEART.

231
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,375
- WHY'RE YOU HIDING
BEHIND YOUR BRO?

232
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,583
- AM I THE ONLY GIRL
THIS DOESN'T FIT?

233
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:18,458
- OH, COME ON. JUST TREAT IT
LIKE YOU'RE WEARING A SWIMSUIT.

234
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,958
NOTHING WRONG WITH SHOWING
OFF THE ASSETS, AM I RIGHT?

235
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:22,625
- IF YOU MAKE A BIG
DEAL OUT OF THIS,

236
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,541
IT'LL ONLY DRAW MORE ATTENTION.

237
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,416
THE WAY TO PULL THIS OFF IS TO
ACT LIKE IT DOESN'T FAZE YOU.

238
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,125
- DOES THAT REALLY WORK?

239
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,375
- I KNOW A LITTLE TRICK TO
HELP YOU RELAX, IF YOU WANT.

240
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,291
- I'LL PASS, THANK YOU!
LAST NIGHT'S TASTE

241
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:36,125
OF YOUR RELAXATION TECHNIQUES
WAS MORE THAN ENOUGH!

242
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,125
- WHAT'RE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

243
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,875
- NOTHING! FORGET I SAID
ANYTHING, JUST IGNORE ME!

244
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,041
- ( bell tolls )

245
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,000
- Miu: OKAY, SO...

246
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,250
THEY ALL GO IN
THIS CAGE-LIKE THING?

247
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:52,375
- YEAH. THANKS FOR THE HELP,
BY THE WAY. I APPRECIATE IT.

248
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:55,166
- Akatsuki: NO PROB. LET'S
FINISH UP AND GET OUTTA HERE.

249
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,375
- ( moans )

250
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,666
- ( giggles )

251
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,458
I'M SORRY, YOU WERE
JUST SO RANDOM.

252
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:08,375
- AH, GUESS THAT'S
A WORD FOR IT.

253
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,458
I DIDN'T MEAN TO POP THE BALL.

254
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,041
SOMETIMES I JUST DON'T
KNOW MY OWN...

255
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:14,416
- COULD THE TWO OF YOU FINISH
UP A LITTLE QUIETER, PLEASE?

256
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:16,208
- SORRY.

257
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,666
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

258
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,833
- Kuzuha: DID YOU HEAR THAT?

259
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:22,000
I THINK SOMEONE ELSE
IS IN HERE WITH US.

260
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,250
- ( moaning )

261
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,041
- MAYBE SHE'S CHECKING
HER FOR LICE?

262
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,750
- SHE'S SURE THOROUGH AS HELL.

263
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,791
- THAT'S A GOOD WAY
TO GET SUSPENDED!

264
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,458
THERE'S LIKE A HUNDRED OTHER
PLACES YOU COULD DO THIS.

265
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,083
GET UP!

266
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,916
- WHY YOU GOTTA BE
SUCH A KILLJOY? JEEZ.

267
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,541
- THIS IS AGAINST THE RULES.

268
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:49,041
- Chikage: ONLY AGAINST
THE RULES IF YOU GET CAUGHT.

269
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,416
- EXACTLY HOW MANY GIRLS
HAVE YOU LURED HERE?

270
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,416
P.E. STANDS FOR PHYSICAL
EDUCATION, NOT PERSONAL EATERY!

271
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,000
- CHILL. I ONLY INDULGE
ON DODGE BALL DAY.

272
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,291
- I'M OUT OF HERE!

273
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,750
- Both: WAIT, HOLD THE DOOR!

274
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:05,333
- WE'RE TOTALLY TRAPPED
IN HERE, AREN'T WE?

275
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:07,750
- TOTALLY. THE FASCISTS
WHO DESIGNED THIS PLACE

276
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,833
MADE IT SO THESE STUPID DOORS
ONLY OPEN FROM THE OUTSIDE.

277
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,708
I USUALLY WEDGE A
HANDKERCHIEF IN THE CORNER

278
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,041
TO KEEP IT FROM CLOSING
ALL THE WAY, BUT...

279
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,166
- NO SWEAT.
I GOT THIS.

280
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,791
- HOLD ON. TRAPPED OR NOT,
IT IS SCHOOL PROPERTY.

281
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,666
DAMAGE IT AND
THEY'LL MURDER YOU.

282
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,750
BESIDES, YOUR BICEPS AREN'T
OUR ONLY TICKET OUT OF HERE.

283
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,291
- OH YEAH?

284
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,333
- WE'LL JUST HAVE TO SIT TIGHT
TILL SOMEONE ELSE COMES IN.

285
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:33,916
LUNCH WILL BE OVER SOON,

286
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,916
THE OTHER REPS WILL HAVE TO
CLEAN UP AFTER THEIR CLASSES.

287
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,416
SHOULDN'T BE LONG.

288
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,333
NOT MUCH WE CAN DO ABOUT IT.
THANKS TO LADY ROMEO HERE.

289
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,625
- DON'T PIN THIS ON ME,

290
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,791
YOU COULD'VE GONE WITH
DON'T ASK DON'T TELL.

291
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:46,208
- YOU'RE NOT SERIOUSLY
HOPING I'LL IGNORE THE FACT

292
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,791
THAT YOU TREAT THIS ROOM LIKE
A TRUCK STOP PARKING LOT.

293
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,458
- OW. WAY TO TWIST THE
KNIFE, LITTLE MISS RULEBOOK.

294
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,708
CAN'T WE JUST
CALL IT BAD LUCK?

295
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:56,416
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE TRYING
TO ARGUE WITH ME ABOUT THIS.

296
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,916
- OH, WOW.
NOT TO SOUND WEIRD,

297
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,208
BUT I'M SORTA JEALOUS OF
THE CHEMISTRY YOU TWO HAVE.

298
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:03,333
- All: "CHEMISTRY?"

299
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:25,583
- YOU'RE SHIVERING. IS IT COLD
IN HERE TO YOU? I'M SORRY.

300
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,458
- I'M FINE. DON'T
WORRY ABOUT IT.

301
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,708
- I THINK SOMEBODY
NEEDS TO PEE.

302
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,041
- NUH-UH!

303
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:33,916
- FINE. BE THAT WAY.

304
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,750
BUT YOUR EYES ARE
TURNING YELLOW.

305
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,041
- IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS,

306
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,250
BUT YOU REALLY DO
SEEM UNCOMFORTABLE.

307
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,583
- DROP IT, PLEASE.

308
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,333
- IF YOU REALLY HAVE
TO GO THAT BADLY,

309
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,416
I SAW SOME SANDBAGS
IN THE CORNER.

310
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,833
I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH
WITH EARTH MAGIC

311
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,875
TO MAKE A PROPER
LATRINE, THOUGH.

312
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:56,083
- NO, THAT'S A GREAT IDEA,
WE MAKE A TOILET OUTTA DIRT!

313
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,333
EARTH MAGIC IS LITTLE
MISS SQUIRMY'S THING!

314
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,125
BOOM! BLADDER
ISSUE RECTIFIED!

315
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,083
- Miu: COME ON.
NO BIG DEAL.

316
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,416
WE'LL STAND IN THE CORNER
WITH OUR HANDS OVER OUR EARS.

317
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,625
IT'LL BE FINE!

318
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,875
- YEAH. MIGHT EVEN TAKE
YOU DOWN A FEW PEGS.

319
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,166
I'M SO LOVING THIS IDEA.

320
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,208
- SHUT UP! JUST FORGET
ABOUT IT, OKAY?

321
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,916
- ( squirming )

322
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,375
- OKAY. LOOK, I WAS JUST
BUSTING YOUR CHOPS,

323
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:20,916
BUT I HATE TO SEE
YOU LIKE THIS.

324
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,458
IF NATURE'S CALLING,
ANSWER! LIGHTEN UP.

325
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,375
MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER,
I'LL TAKE THE BLAME.

326
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:28,625
- THERE YOU GO. SHE'S
ACCEPTED FULL RESPONSIBILITY.

327
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,625
YOU CAN TRUST HER
NOT TO TELL ANYONE.

328
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:33,083
- Chikage: ABSOLUTELY. WE'RE
ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

329
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,666
ALL FOR ONE
AND ONE FOR ALL!

330
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,625
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

331
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,416
IF I TRY TO MOVE
FROM THIS SPOT...

332
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,583
I'LL LEAVE A TRAIL.

333
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,375
- NOT DIGGING
ON THE TEARS.

334
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,833
- WELL, IF YOU HAVE A
SOLUTION, WE'RE GAME.

335
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:52,583
- I DO, ACTUALLY, BUT
YOU MAY NOT LIKE IT.

336
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,375
SEE, IN MY BOOK
WHEN A GIRL'S CRYING,

337
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,041
DRASTIC MEASURES
ARE IN ORDER.

338
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:57,791
IF YOU LADIES ARE
WILLING TO HELP ME OUT,

339
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:58,916
I'VE GOT JUST THE THING.

340
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:03,000
IT'S NOT AN ELEGANT FIX,
THOUGH. YOU STILL GAME?

341
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,916
THAT'S THE SPIRIT.

342
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,416
I NEED YOU TO STAND
ON EITHER SIDE OF HER.

343
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,583
- Miu: ALL RIGHT.
LIKE THIS?

344
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:11,666
- MMM-HMM.

345
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,500
- ( both gasp )

346
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:28,250
- WHAT THE HELL?
I CAN'T STAND UP.

347
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:32,166
- OH, NO!
I HAVE TO GO.

348
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,000
HOW IS THIS SUPPOSED TO HELP?

349
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,958
- I DIDN'T PICK UP ANY MAGIC
FROM THE OTHER SIDE,

350
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,250
BUT I DID LEARN ONE THING.

351
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,625
A TECHNIQUE CALLED
LINKED ENERGY MANIPULATION,

352
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:42,041
WHICH I SEEM TO
HAVE A KNACK FOR.

353
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,666
SEE, BASICALLY, IT ALLOWS ME
TO REDIRECT THE ENERGY

354
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,083
FLOWING THROUGH YOUR BODIES.

355
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:47,208
- ( both gasp )

356
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,166
- WAIT, BUT...

357
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,750
WHAT'S OUR KIDNEY'S BURSTING
GOTTA DO WITH HELPING HER?

358
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:53,916
- ( she screams )

359
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,375
- COME ON, LET THE
GOOD TIMES FLOW, EH?

360
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:57,583
NO NEED TO HOLD IT IN.

361
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,125
THERE'S NO SHAME IF
YOU ALL HAVE TO GO.

362
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,125
- ARE YOU OUT
OF YOUR MIND?

363
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,958
- IT'S HAPPENING!

364
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,041
- I'M GONNA BLOW!
- BE STRONG, IZUMI!

365
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,541
DON'T GIVE THIS JERK
THE SATISFACTION

366
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:08,250
OF SEEING YOU URINATE!

367
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,208
- HERE. I'LL GIVE YOU
A LITTLE KICK START.

368
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,541
- ( moans )

369
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,541
- WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?

370
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,916
I ASSUME THERE'S A GOOD REASON
THAT THIS DOOR IS LOCKED.

371
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:33,500
AND THAT YOU'RE INCREDIBLY
RUDE! INSOLENT GIRLS.

372
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,916
- ( sighs )

373
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,916
- WELL, I GUESS THIS ANSWERS
THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT

374
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,625
HE'S WORTHY OF BEING MY
GUARDIAN. HE'S TOTALLY NOT!

375
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:52,291
- HEY. THIS WILL NEVER BE
SPOKEN OF, EVERYONE CLEAR?

376
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:55,791
- Miu: NO WAY! I WON'T
BLAB IF YOU DON'T.

377
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:59,500
- ME NEITHER. SORRY I
GOT YOU INTO THIS MESS.

378
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,541
- Chikage: WHAT'RE YOU
APOLOGIZING FOR?

379
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,500
FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
IT'S HIS MESS.

380
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,958
I SAY WE LET BYGONES BE
BYGONES BETWEEN US CHICKS.

381
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,666
WE NEED TO POOL OUR RESOURCES
AND MAKE HIS LIFE HELL!

382
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,125
- OF COURSE!

383
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,500
WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER, ALL
FOR ONE AND ONE FOR ALL!

384
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,000
- DO YOU MEAN YOU WANT
ME TO BE PART OF THE GROUP?

385
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,541
- Chikage: DAMN
SKIPPY, SWEETHEART.

386
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,583
- Kuzuha: COOL?
- YES! VERY COOL.

387
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:23,916
THANK YOU, GUYS!

388
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,375
- Chikage: SOMETHING WRONG?

389
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,791
- OH, IT'S NOTHING.
I JUST ZONED OUT.

390
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,416
IF I DIDN'T KNOW BETTER,

391
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,458
I'D SWEAR HE SET HIMSELF
UP AS THE BAD GUY,

392
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:36,000
SO THE THREE OF
US WOULD BOND.

393
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,416
NAW!

394
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,708
- I AM GETTING THOROUGHLY
SICK OF RUNNING INTO YOU.

395
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,375
AH! YOU ARE AN ANIMAL!

396
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:48,750
- ( theme song playing )

397
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:49,958
- ( singing in Japanese )

398
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:21,291
- Valkyrie: I BELIEVE AKATSUKI
MENTIONED IN PASSING ONCE,

399
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:23,208
THAT HE WAS A
STUDENT BACK HOME.

400
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:25,666
- Listy: IN WHICH CASE I
WEEP FOR HIS ACADEMIC PEERS,

401
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,250
NO DOUBT HE'LL LEAD
THEM OFF A CLIFF.

402
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:28,875
- Valkyrie: DISASTER
DOES SHADOW HIM.

403
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:31,416
- Listy: THE IRONY OF IT IS,
THAT THE MAN SCARCELY INTENDS

404
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,791
THE TROUBLE HE STIRS UP.

405
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,458
- Valkyrie: I SUPPOSE FROM
A CERTAIN PERSPECTIVE,

406
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:36,083
WE MAY CALL THAT
A SAVING GRACE.

407
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:37,541
- Listy: IF WE MUST.

408
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:40,375
IF ONE IS INCLINED TO LOOK
PAST HIS TIRELESS AUDACITY!

409
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:42,875
NEXT EPISODE,
"TO BECOME AN ADULT."

410
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:44,750
- Valkyrie: UM, HOW DOES
ONE BECOME AN ADULT

411
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:46,333
WHEN STILL A CHILD?
