1
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,583
Two tribes sworn to hate...

2
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:32,208
Their bloodstained bodies
left out in the open to rot.

3
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:37,041
Their souls longing for a
peace that they failed to find.

4
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,458
As they sought to break
the shackles of darkness

5
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:42,125
and heal the
wounds of the past,

6
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:47,208
Fate denied their quest
and thrust them into war.

7
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:59,208
The bridges of
hope some dared to

8
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:02,750
build between
them were torn asunder.

9
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:07,750
Their dreams were ripped from
their hearts with a sword...

10
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:11,750
with their destiny
revealed at last.

11
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,166
Don't you worry...

12
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:14,166
Just relax. This'll
only hurt for a second.

13
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:26,125
It's stronger than
Katana! And sharper!

14
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:29,583
Ogen, what is this?
What is your Ninja using?

15
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,500
Wielding his Kokujo Technique,

16
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:37,458
Yashamaru controls
his opponent's fate.

17
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:40,375
Coated in animal oil,
the shiny, black strands from

18
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:43,333
young women will
slice you in half!

19
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,500
But there is one drawback.

20
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:49,750
Kokujo is only lethal
if he hits his target,

21
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,250
otherwise it's useless.

22
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,000
You're a pitiful sight
old man! Now, prepare to die.

23
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:59,416
I think it may be too early
to claim the victory, young one.

24
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:21,000
Danjo, something spewed
from your ninja's mouth!

25
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,583
That was Kazamachi's phlegm.

26
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:26,333
What kind of creature is he?!

27
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,916
Don't be fooled
by appearances that

28
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,750
pest can't overcome
Yashamaru's Kokujo.

29
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:37,333
You think I'd appoint an
insect to represent the Kouga?

30
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:41,166
Kazamachi's phlegm is a hundred
times stickier than any glue.

31
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,708
I'd like to see
your Ninja cut through

32
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,375
his impenetrable web of death.

33
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:52,791
Come on cry like the bitch
you are! I'll go easier on you!

34
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:56,166
You know, make sure
it's quick and painless.

35
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,375
Damn you!

36
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,250
Adding insult to injury...
Your head is mine!

37
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:18,000
Not if I rip your
intestines out first!

38
00:06:55,875 --> 00:07:00,541
Danjo, leader of the Kouga
clan. And Ogen of the Iga,

39
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:03,041
filled with such bitter hatred.

40
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:06,416
Both sinister and their
fighters just as vicious.

41
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,750
It's obvious why the
first Hanzo forced them

42
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:11,208
into a no-hostilities pact.

43
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:14,583
Peace cannot bring back
what anger has driven away.

44
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,791
Why would Lord Ieyasu
summon them to Sunpu to

45
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:20,541
reopen old wounds?
Is there another reason for

46
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:23,250
this demonstration of technique?

47
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:31,583
Ninja?

48
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,916
A good sword is one
left in the scabbard.

49
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,333
You suggest to
whittle away the Ninja to

50
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:39,250
determine the
next Tokugawa Shogun?

51
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,916
Wretched within the Edo Castle,

52
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,041
loyalties have been
severed into two factions.

53
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:47,625
The rooted partisan siding with
Hidetada's heir and first-born,

54
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:51,333
Takechiyo, fear the untried
insurgence backed by those

55
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:54,333
devoted to his
younger son, Kunichiyo.

56
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:58,000
Even high-ranking ministers are
turning against their own kin.

57
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,875
If this rupture
goes unresolved,

58
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:03,125
the Tokugawa
kingdom will be torn apart.

59
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,708
That is why I have come.

60
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:08,958
Your wisdom goes well
beyond your years Tenkai.

61
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:12,833
I have meditated on this matter
for countless hours, my lord...

62
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:15,708
A fallen blossom
doesn't return to its branch.

63
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:17,666
What is done is done.

64
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,500
Hidetada's sons are not
interested in sentimental plans.

65
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:25,666
It is clear both desire to
inherit the next seat of power.

66
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,791
You must offer a solution that
is befitting a samurai family.

67
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,625
Settle this treachery
with the clashing of swords.

68
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:36,541
But the Tokugawa
Samurai must not perish

69
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,291
if others are expendable.

70
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:43,166
So... you suggest the Ninja?

71
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,166
I do my lord.
Give them a reason to fight

72
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,250
and they will eagerly
accept the challenge

73
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:52,208
and slay each other in a
sea of blood. Heh, heh, heh...

74
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:56,458
A victor will be decided and
it won't hurt us in the least.

75
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,708
I've seen enough.
Call them off.

76
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:13,333
Stop! Enough!

77
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:28,583
Kouga and Iga Clans.
That was truly extraordinary.

78
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,375
Who could have
guessed that lethal Ninjas

79
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:33,166
lurked so close to Yagyu lands.

80
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,583
I am both
amazed and wary of this.

81
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:38,125
I had heard stories of these
extraordinary techniques from

82
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:41,333
my predecessor, but the skills
displayed by these two today,

83
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,541
are beyond
anything I've ever seen.

84
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,541
Mmm! A fine
demonstration indeed.

85
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:50,791
Ogen of the Iga... Kouga
Danjo, I commend you both.

86
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:53,166
Know that I am
well pleased today.

87
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,333
Thank you, Lord Ieyasu.

88
00:09:55,916 --> 00:10:02,958
Now then... An adverse rift has
ruptured the Tokugawa faction.

89
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,958
A battle between your clans
will determine the next Shogun.

90
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,833
Do you accept?

91
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,875
May I be so bold, my Lord?

92
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:14,541
Speak, Danjo.

93
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:18,416
We Kouga have been enemies
of the Iga for 400 years.

94
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,500
Even if the Tokugawa
weren't in penitent disarray

95
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,583
we'd fight to the death.

96
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:26,666
But our clans are bound by
the no-hostilities pact that

97
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,750
was forced upon us by
the former Hattori Hanzo.

98
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:33,000
Now if this
pact was abolished...

99
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,083
As you wish, my Lord.

100
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:45,666
Mmm. Wise choice,
Hanzo. It is settled.

101
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,708
Let us proceed. The Kouga
and the Iga shall hereby

102
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:55,666
inscribe the names of
ten Ninja on these two scrolls.

103
00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:00,083
The Kouga will fight for Lord
Kunichiyo, Hidetada's second son

104
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,875
and the Iga will
fight on behalf of

105
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:05,416
the long-standing
heir, Lord Takechiyo.

106
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,541
This fight will
last to the bitter end,

107
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:11,708
and the clan whose proponents
avoid the clutches of death,

108
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,333
shall inherit the spoils.

109
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:20,833
The victor will bear favored
status, for a thousand years.

110
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,458
Kazamachi. Go now to the Kouga.

111
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:28,500
Take this to the Iga, Yashamaru.

112
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,375
It seems we find ourselves
right where we began.

113
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:42,958
Indeed. Our Grandchildren
are so in love...

114
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:46,166
Just when I thought there
might be peace between us.

115
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,833
What a shame. Knowing
them, they're probably meeting

116
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,375
at this very moment.

117
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,208
It's a tragedy.
I guess they were

118
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:55,291
born under the
wrong star, Danjo.

119
00:11:55,375 --> 00:12:00,666
The wrong star...?
Yes, I suppose that's it.

120
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,541
Fate has spoken.

121
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:10,083
And Fortune's
delivery is frightening.

122
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,375
Danjo-sama!

123
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,125
Ogen-dono.

124
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:47,208
Sorry, I'm late.

125
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:58,208
When we're together, life
seems so simple and unwavering.

126
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:01,833
Yes. Sometimes I wish
the Kouga and Iga clans

127
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:03,708
were no more and
we no longer had to

128
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,291
hide our love for one another.

129
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,916
That we were the
only ones in this world.

130
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,416
We won't have to
hide it much longer.

131
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,083
The Kouga elder is on my side.
Even Hattori Hanzo wants our

132
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:17,583
families to make amends and
stop this senseless fighting.

133
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,250
We could ask him to mediate.

134
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:24,416
If anyone can work out a treaty
between our people, it's Hanzo.

135
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,750
Yes. I hope you're right.

136
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:32,375
The sun's setting. We
should go. It won't be long.

137
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:35,791
We'll be together
soon. I promise.

138
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:39,041
What's the matter, Ogen-dono?

139
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,708
Will it really come to pass?

140
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:42,375
Of course it will.

141
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:46,000
Will there be peace?
In our lifetime!

142
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,708
Will there be
peace between us?!

143
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:50,166
Never give in to
your fear or doubts.

144
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,833
You and I have to
be strong, Ogen-dono.

145
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,000
We have to keep
talking to our families.

146
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:58,291
We'll get through. And
peace will come, I promise.

147
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:01,541
But we have to know
this in our hearts.

148
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,500
Ogen-dono.

149
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:10,041
Don't worry, Danjo-sama.
I'll be strong.

150
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,750
As long as you're with me.

151
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,375
You're so dear to me.

152
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:19,208
You are my life. Ogen my love.

153
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,291
You've said my name
as if you were family!

154
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:28,416
Ours will start soon, my love.

155
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:33,583
I purified my body
just for you before I came.

156
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:49,750
Is that...?!

157
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,541
Tsubakagure!
We're under attack!

158
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,208
Who could destroy
the Tsubagakure Watchtower

159
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,291
so easily?!

160
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,833
This was no ordinary assault!

161
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:22,541
This is war!
But why the Iga?!

162
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,250
The Oda!

163
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,458
I'll finish this one.

164
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:59,208
Ogen, where is the Elder?

165
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,458
Ogen!

166
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,541
Are you hurt!

167
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:17,041
My shoulder. It's nothing.
They just grazed it.

168
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,500
Grandfather!

169
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,041
Ogen... He's gone.

170
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:35,666
We rushed over here but
it was too late. I'm sorry.

171
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,500
A Kouga? Here? Danjo?

172
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,833
What's the meaning of this?

173
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,083
So that's how it is.

174
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:01,041
We must leave before
the the Iga are annihilated!

175
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,458
Take the survivors and run!

176
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:03,958
I'll kill them! 

177
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:07,666
Ogen! No! Please!
There are too many!

178
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,125
Nobunaga must be mad!

179
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,833
A sane man would not
commit such a heinous act!

180
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:20,458
He will be crushed
for this night of plunder!

181
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,333
Go now! To the gate!

182
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,625
You must go back
to the Kouga now.

183
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:37,958
I'll come to you someday.
I promise, Danjo-sama.

184
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:42,708
I won't leave you. Not until
I get you to a safe place.

185
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:44,833
Now, let's tend to your wound.

186
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,416
Sagenta!

187
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:56,291
Hinnojo! Hikoza!

188
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:06,583
That's a Kouga Star! Why would
we be involved this attack!

189
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,291
Danjo-sama!

190
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:09,375
Renbu?

191
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,083
What were you
doing in Tsubagakure?

192
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:14,166
My business is my own.
Why are you attacking the Iga?!

193
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,583
Do we Kouga need a reason for
that... You've gotten too soft.

194
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:21,125
The elder has given me
the mandate to execute all Iga!

195
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,500
What?!

196
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,875
The Oda have launched
a full-scale attack.

197
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:31,291
We're just picking off
the ones that try to escape.

198
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,916
The Elder realized that
if we helped the Oda,

199
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,416
we could destroy
the Iga once and for all!

200
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,666
I am your Chief!
I order you to stop this!

201
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,041
We were told not to obey
your orders tonight, Danjo!

202
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,750
Every last Iga
must be destroyed!

203
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,083
I won't allow it!

204
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:51,875
It was all a lie.
I was blind!

205
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:55,166
The Kouga never wanted
peace. You lied to me.

206
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,541
Ogen! What are you saying?!

207
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:01,708
Wait! Please! This has
to be a mistake! Ogen!

208
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:05,250
Your wound! Let me see!

209
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,583
Take your hand away.

210
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,041
That's more than just a graze!

211
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:16,000
It's close to one
of your vital points.

212
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:20,875
Please! You have
to let me see! Ogen!

213
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:48,541
We were lost in a dream.
Our love was not meant to be.

214
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:54,083
I will hunt you...
to the death... Danjo!

215
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,291
I fear for you, Old Ogen...

216
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,458
You are not familiar
with the shinobi of

217
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,833
the Kouga Manjidani, are you?

218
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,416
Fear for yourself, Danjo.

219
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,458
You know nothing of
the Iga Tsubagakure Ten.

220
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,625
Don't you mean nine?

221
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,666
You let your guard down.

222
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,125
It had to be done
at some point anyway.

223
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:37,250
I'd just as soon
get it over with now.

224
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:49,666
This isn't about
love... it's survival.

225
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:00,416
Farewell, my love.

226
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:06,416
This is the fate of
those born into war, Ogen.

227
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:17,750
Ogen!

228
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:38,958
I'm sorry I'm so late.

229
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,333
Oboro-dono.

230
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:47,000
Gennosuke-sama.

231
00:23:56,666 --> 00:24:01,166
The Kouga and the Iga. A path
of serenity woven together by

232
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:06,250
the footsteps of innocence.
But rained on ground hardens.

233
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:09,375
Now two secret scrolls
tread through a sea of blood,

234
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:11,833
desperate to reach
their destination.

235
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:14,458
And treachery has no smell.

236
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:19,666
On the next Basilisk,
"Last Rendezvous."
