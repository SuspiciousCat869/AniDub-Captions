1
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:28,708
Two tribes sworn to hate...

2
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:32,416
Their bloodstained bodies
left out in the open to rot.

3
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,208
Their souls longing for a
peace that they failed to find.

4
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:39,625
As they sought to break
the shackles of darkness

5
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:42,250
and heal the
wounds of the past,

6
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:47,333
Fate denied their quest
and thrust them into war.

7
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,291
The bridges of
hope some dared to build

8
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:02,833
between them were torn asunder.

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,875
Their dreams were ripped from
their hearts with a sword...

10
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:11,875
with their destiny
revealed at last.

11
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,708
Kagero... That's enough.

12
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:26,500
What now? Will you
still proceed to Sunpu?

13
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,166
In your condition?

14
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,625
Entering there without
sight may not be a wise move.

15
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,208
Wise or not, I have a mission.

16
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:35,833
I need to ask Lord Ieyasu
the meaning nehind this.

17
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,833
Until I discover
his true motive,

18
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:40,375
there is no turning
back for any of us.

19
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,083
We've known from the
beginning they would attack.

20
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,166
If we let this
sway us from our path,

21
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,500
then the Iga can
rightly claim victory.

22
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:56,750
And we will never make it
to Sunpu to learn the truth.

23
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:04,916
Forgive me. I allowed
my fears to speak for me.

24
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,875
Upon Saemon's return,
we will make our departure.

25
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,041
I expect you both to be ready.

26
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,125
Gennosuke-sama...

27
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:30,333
Fear is only the concern
for an unknown future...

28
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:34,291
and I sincerely hope
my fears are unfounded.

29
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:38,750
For there is a way before us
that has every possibility of

30
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,625
bringing about
the type of carnage

31
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:43,500
we have only
heard about in legend.

32
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:59,583
You actually did it?
You killed them all?

33
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,125
This should be a
time of celebration.

34
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:04,416
I killed Gennosuke.

35
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,375
And the rest of the Kouga
were even easier than him.

36
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,333
He died by your hand?

37
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:17,291
Seems his mysticism
couldn't help him very much.

38
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,708
What about Hyoma?

39
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:22,333
A blind ninja? He was
easier than any of them.

40
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:25,208
I've cut radishes that
put up more resistance.

41
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:30,833
And while she was distracted
by your butterflies,

42
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:34,958
I made very short work of the
female ninja they call Kagero.

43
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,875
Which leaves one...

44
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,708
Saemon... Does that
mean he still runs free?

45
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:50,750
He was the one
slippery fish that got away.

46
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:54,833
But, I will find him,
just like I found the others.

47
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,541
I expected much more
from you, Nenki-dono.

48
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,500
We all have weak moments.

49
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:05,291
I'll find you Saemon.
You will not live for long.

50
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,375
Oh, and I almost forgot.

51
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,916
With her dying breath,
the female ninja

52
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,791
told to me something.

53
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:15,250
The ninja who
killed Yashamaru...

54
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,291
was none other than Saemon.

55
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:33,791
Nenki-dono, how could you
do that?! You let him escape?!

56
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,875
You killed them all but him.

57
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:38,833
The man who
murdered Yashamaru-dono.

58
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:42,291
We'll find him.
And make him suffer.

59
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,916
He's the one...

60
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,750
You should have
found him, and cut him

61
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:57,000
in two before you bothered
with any of the others.

62
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,708
This must... be fate.

63
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:13,958
My fate... The heavens
charge me to this...

64
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:19,333
I will track him. And then
I will slay him like a dog.

65
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:22,208
You think you can, Hotarubi?

66
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,083
Saemon is a
man of disguise with

67
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,750
many faces you
would never question.

68
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,500
I will see through
any falsehoods that

69
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:32,791
scum puts in front me.
I'm going to kill him.

70
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:42,291
This I swear. If
it's the last thing I do.

71
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:15,875
So...

72
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,500
You'll see
through my falsehoods.

73
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:33,000
But you didn't... Did you?

74
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:38,666
You... Saemon...
You... killed...

75
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,375
Ya-sha...

76
00:09:55,833 --> 00:10:00,541
Yashamaru... dono...

77
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,291
Let me... go...

78
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:28,583
Go with you... Yashamaru-dono...

79
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:41,000
Ya... sha... maru... dono...

80
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:29,083
Why the hell do we
have to get on a boat?!

81
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,416
Traveling over
seven leagues of ocean.

82
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:40,750
It's enough to make me want
to stay here. All by myself.

83
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,208
What's wrong with the ocean?

84
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,791
You act like it would
kill you if it had the chance.

85
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,833
Of course it would kill me!
Salt can liquefy my body

86
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:50,625
and there's gonna be a
whole sea of it under our boat!

87
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,750
Better believe I'm nervous.
I can't even stop shaking.

88
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,666
Calm down, Jingoro.
You'll be safe.

89
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,291
It's not as if you
have to do any swimming.

90
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,333
I know that. I'm not an idiot.

91
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,833
But it doesn't
make me any less scared.

92
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,208
In looking around...

93
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,416
I see no sign that the
Kouga boarded a boat here.

94
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,000
If they chose
to stick to the land

95
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,791
and travel the Tokaido Road
only, then we should be able to

96
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,000
get ahead of them and

97
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,541
overtake their
position by use of the sea.

98
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:26,333
But Tenzen-sama, Nenki-dono

99
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:28,833
and Hotarubi have
still not returned.

100
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,625
I don't consider it very
wise to move on without them.

101
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,208
If they haven't
shown up by this point,

102
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,291
then we must assume the worst.

103
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,916
We do not have the time to wait
for those who may be lost...

104
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,791
or dead... And so we move on.

105
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:37,166
My desire to fight is
absent, but I will in no way

106
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,750
alter my own path
to avoid an attack.

107
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:43,875
If you attack, you will leave
us with no choice but to resist.

108
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,208
And if before we
reach the gates of Sunpu,

109
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,791
we engage in a battle to the
death between the Kouga Five

110
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,875
and the Iga Seven,
then so be it.

111
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:56,083
I am one of the Iga Seven.

112
00:14:56,166 --> 00:15:00,416
And to Gennosuk-sama, all he
sees are his remaining enemies.

113
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,416
It is a world of black
and white to him now.

114
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,833
The elders say the absent
get further off every day.

115
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:09,458
And to him this must be true.

116
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,375
I assume that in his
mind I am nothing more than

117
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:14,791
the Iga woman who knowingly
lured him into a trap.

118
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:20,541
If only he knew this was
not the truth, not even close.

119
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:25,375
My feelings are deeper.
My feelings are real.

120
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,833
Be careful, these
waves can be very harsh.

121
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:35,958
Koshiro... Thank you
for staying close to me.

122
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,333
Oboro-sama?

123
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,541
It's getting rough out
here. You should come in.

124
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:54,625
Here, let me help you.
I've prepared some tea.

125
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,583
I'd like to stay out here.

126
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:57,583
Are you sure?

127
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:58,791
Yes.

128
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,625
I have never been
on a boat before.

129
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:07,000
I want to take in as
much of this as I can.

130
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,958
The smell of the water is nice.

131
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,541
The splashing of the waves...

132
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,875
The crying of the gulls,
and the salt of the ocean

133
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:22,375
soaking into my skin.
This is all very new to me.

134
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:26,208
And I am wondering
why am I here.

135
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,958
Why am I a part in all of this?

136
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,541
Thank you and enjoy
the rest of your trip.

137
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:14,916
Thank you!

138
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,708
They were fantastic. I'd
love for them to play more.

139
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,125
Gennosuke-sama...

140
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:58,583
Akeginu?

141
00:17:58,666 --> 00:17:59,791
Yes.

142
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,500
Take Jingoro and go
to the back of the boat.

143
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,500
Of course. Why?

144
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,666
Because I need to
speak with Oboro-sama alone.

145
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,041
I don't want any
disturbances, so have Koshiro

146
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:14,416
guard the main cabin. No one
is to enter while we are inside.

147
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:18,333
What's wrong? Just have
him sit there and stay still.

148
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:21,208
People won't approach
someone who looks like him.

149
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:26,250
I will tell him.
But what matter are you

150
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,541
going to discuss
with Oboro-sama?

151
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:32,041
Once we reach the port in Miya,
we may find the Kouga waiting.

152
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:35,958
Unfortunately, Oboro-sama's
thoughts seem to be elsewhere.

153
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,125
She still has doubts,
ever critical of

154
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:40,666
the dissolution of
the No-Hostilities Pact.

155
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,958
Her heart is not
with us, and each second

156
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,666
brings us closer to our destiny.

157
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,333
I must ensure that she
is completely prepared for

158
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,916
the fate that awaits us all.

159
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,208
No matter the cost, I need
to make sure she is strong.

160
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,708
Now do as I ask.

161
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,166
Tenzen-sama...

162
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,833
What is it?

163
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:07,750
What if... What if she
does not heed your advice?

164
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:10,416
What do you plan to do then?

165
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:21,083
She is headstrong.
More than anyone I know.

166
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:25,958
She knows reason. And she
will hear what I have to say.

167
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,458
I am sure of this.

168
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:37,208
I haven't heard a
flute that fine in ages.

169
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,625
You know, we should offer
him a drink of our wine later.

170
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,416
That's a great idea.

171
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,250
I don't know how much
longer I'll be able to last.

172
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,333
When do we get there?

173
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,250
Who is there?

174
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,375
Is that you, Tenzen?

175
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:52,041
Tenzen... Where
are all the others?

176
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,833
I asked them to wait
at the back of the boat.

177
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:59,208
Why would you do that?
Is there a problem?

178
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,166
Tenzen?

179
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:14,666
You and I have a very important
matter we need to discuss.

180
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,708
A lovers bond has been
shredded by words both

181
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:03,083
spoken and unspoken. While
old enemies rise up again like

182
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:06,416
the coming of a squall, a
grieving woman has set sail

183
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,458
across a sea of uncertainty.
One ninja is driven to

184
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:13,541
desperation from inside
his own locked cage,

185
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:16,625
as sacred rules governing
the master and servant are

186
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:19,541
scattered to the wind
like the ashes of the dead.

187
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:23,000
On the next Basilisk,
"Fallen Flower."
