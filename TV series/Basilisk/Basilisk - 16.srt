1
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,666
Josuke!

2
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:04,125
Keep your mouth quiet!
You'll scare the fish away!

3
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,291
Kazamachi, the
stars tell me there is

4
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,500
bad luck for you with water.

5
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:17,875
You would be better suited doing
anything besides fishing today.

6
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,750
That Jyubei, so full of lies.

7
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,958
Very nicely done Kazamachi-dono.

8
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,583
Where's my bad
luck with water now?

9
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,875
Looks like I
proved Jyubei wrong.

10
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,208
Hold it right there!

11
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,583
There's nowhere to run, Josuke!

12
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:58,166
Gyobu? Okoi? What's going on?

13
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,875
I am so sorry Okoi-dono...

14
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:05,458
But my hand has a very good
reason for doing what it did.

15
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:06,583
What's that?

16
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,375
Your read-end was
talking to my hand,

17
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:11,666
begging it to
reach out and say "hi."

18
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:18,208
Come here... Please touch ...
Please... touch...

19
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:22,250
Cancel boar stew for dinner.
Let's have Josuke stew instead.

20
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:25,166
That sounds like it would
be way too fatty for my taste.

21
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,750
But the good news is that
we'll have food for months.

22
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,583
You don't want to do that.
With fatty meat like this,

23
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:33,833
those lovely buttocks of
yours might expand too much.

24
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:45,291
Do that again Josuke
and you're a dead man!

25
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,333
You never learn, do you?

26
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,875
If I were you, I'd be
sick of getting beat up.

27
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:02,875
I was joking but Okoi-dono
has no sense of humor.

28
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,916
You should just be happy
she didn't follow through with

29
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,416
her plans to
cook you for dinner.

30
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,916
I was going to ask Saemon
to disguise himself as me

31
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
so that I wouldn't didn't get
hurt... but I never asked him.

32
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,333
Wise up. Saemon's
skills have limits.

33
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,250
He couldn't transform
into a body like yours

34
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,041
even if he wanted to.

35
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,000
It was worth a shot.

36
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:27,541
I know, you don't want
to escort Gennosuke-sama.

37
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:30,041
Of course not.
Think of where he's going.

38
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,875
Why would anyone want
to go to that awful place?

39
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,625
I never would've imagined.

40
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,125
Gennosuke-sama agreeing to

41
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,708
an arranged
marriage with the enemy.

42
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:44,916
The rump of an Iga princess.
It sounds so unappealing.

43
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,625
It's probably tough and
lumpy. Who would want that?

44
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,750
Don't worry. No one
will find us out here.

45
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:03,166
All the men are at their posts
keeping watch for any sign of

46
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,875
the approaching Kouga, so
we're safe from curious eyes.

47
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,333
But you are not keeping watch.

48
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,166
Shouldn't you be
with the other men?

49
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:13,625
Another set of eyes
out there will do no good.

50
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:18,041
I'd rather be right here. Where
I know what I am looking for.

51
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:22,583
Yashamaru... dono.

52
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,666
On second thought...

53
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,500
Maybe this is not the
best time to steal away.

54
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:50,500
Yashamaru-dono!

55
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,125
I ask you to help
me to calm my nerves.

56
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:02,375
I fear doing anything
embarrassing or clumsy.

57
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:05,500
Give me guidance so
I do not shame my people.

58
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:09,125
Please, watch over
me in my time of need.

59
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,000
Ogen-sama...

60
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,750
When I agreed to present
Oboro-sama to Hattori,

61
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:34,541
I had expected
something a bit more proper.

62
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:37,791
Tenzen. Why is
your hair all curly?

63
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:38,875
I was not made aware that

64
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,708
the Kouga would
be represented as well.

65
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:43,250
We are bound by
the No-Hostilities Pact.

66
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,541
There is no
need for such concern.

67
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:46,666
Very well.

68
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,000
Pardon me. Ogen-sama.

69
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:53,000
The palanquin is ready
for departure anytime.

70
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,458
Wanna go play?

71
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,750
I have no understanding
of why you would choose

72
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,791
such a young child as
the heir of Tsubagakure.

73
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:12,166
Especially since she
is not even your own child.

74
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,583
This bloodline has many
more who are better suited for

75
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:18,958
such a position. Not
that silly little girl.

76
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,375
When you see the heir of
the Kouga, you will know why.

77
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,083
Danjo of the Kouga
and Ogen of the Iga...

78
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:47,083
neither has ever found
a mate among their own.

79
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:50,875
Each chose their successors
from their distant bloodline.

80
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:55,208
But both these children
possess the power of the eyes.

81
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,708
Kyohachiro...

82
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:05,916
Yes.

83
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:13,708
It will be boring to listen to
grown-ups. Let's go outside.

84
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,625
It's a beautiful day to play.

85
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,500
Someone will come along
to get you when we're done.

86
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:42,166
I... uh... Do... you...

87
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,375
I heard that the Iga are nothing
but disgusting and cruel.

88
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,333
Cruel? No...

89
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,875
Yeah... and your
village stinks too.

90
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,958
But... That's not true...

91
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,833
Our village is a
wonderful place to live.

92
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,083
Why do you say that?

93
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,000
For one, we have wild rabbits.

94
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,166
We have those
in our village too.

95
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,125
But... our rabbits are colorful.

96
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,958
I've seen brown
ones, gray ones

97
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,791
and sometimes, even black.

98
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,500
Back home we have
white ones all over.

99
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:29,208
Yeah, well... um... We have...

100
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:32,416
The sunshine in our
village is always sparkling!

101
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,458
Sparkling... sunshine?

102
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:42,583
Everyone back home
treats me very well.

103
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:46,375
Nenki, swings me high
into the air with his hair.

104
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:51,500
Koshiro... Koshiro carves
me little statues and things.

105
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,541
And Akeginu...

106
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:57,375
She likes to tell me stories.

107
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,291
That sounds really nice.

108
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:09,333
If I can, I'd
like to visit sometime.

109
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,166
Sure!

110
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,250
Is the young
lady your daughter?

111
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,458
Perhaps there was a
time when we had such a bond.

112
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,708
But those memories have faded.

113
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,958
I see her growing
so quickly into a woman.

114
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:06,541
Oboro-sama, you should rest
your feet inside the palanquin.

115
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,958
But I like walking with you!

116
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:16,375
That boy was a Kouga. He
said they had a nice village.

117
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,541
I would think that they do.

118
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:23,500
Um... Can I play with him again?

119
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:28,041
Yes. Of course.

120
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,416
Oboro-sama...

121
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:47,083
Oboro-sama?! Oboro-sama?!

122
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,583
Oboro-sama?!

123
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,666
There you are!

124
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,208
I'm sorry I'm late!

125
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,375
You're sweating
right through your clothes.

126
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,083
And your makeup
is completely ruined.

127
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,416
It's running down
your cheeks like water.

128
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:04,916
Can you fix it?

129
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
We will be cutting
it close but I think so.

130
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,875
I have been able to
handle much worse situations.

131
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,083
Take a look.

132
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,375
Never in my life have
I seen a prettier face.

133
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,541
Thank you, Akeginu.

134
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,958
That's it! I can't
stand this anymore!

135
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,208
Kagero?

136
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:58,541
Seems I am quite
in demand today.

137
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,125
What is wrong with Kagero?

138
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,708
She asked me to
look at the stars

139
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:02,916
and tell her what
would happen with

140
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,833
Gennosuke-sama's
marriage meeting.

141
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:07,000
I said I would not.

142
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:10,250
Well, that's the same
reason I am visiting you.

143
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:13,541
Whatever the stars may
say regarding his marriage

144
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:17,083
it is not for you, Kagero,
or anyone else to know.

145
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,958
I could reveal what fate has
in store for Gennosuke-sama,

146
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,666
but nothing will
have any effect on

147
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,333
the feelings
churning inside him.

148
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:28,208
You are right about that.

149
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,375
These eyes... They may be blind,

150
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:36,291
but the visions I have
behind them are vivid.

151
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,875
I can see the fixed
intensity of Gennosuke-sama.

152
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,958
What lies beyond his
decisions are becoming reality,

153
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:46,791
for that is where the future
of the Kouga people awaits.

154
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:54,333
Gennosuke, only you
can decide for yourself,

155
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,666
and I will not say
that your beliefs are wrong.

156
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,500
But this hatred
between our people is

157
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:03,041
four hundred years old. It
will not simply cease overnight.

158
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:06,958
I understand. But my desire
is still holding strong.

159
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,666
I forsee a day in
the very near future

160
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,500
when the Kouga and
the Iga can shed the shackles

161
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,916
of this long-standing feud.

162
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,750
We will move
forward into a new world.

163
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:21,125
A united clan to
change the future for all.

164
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:31,250
You are still so young.

165
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,041
Oh, no...

166
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:47,375
Oboro-sama is headed right
for us. On my signal, Nenki.

167
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:50,458
Right. You can
count on me old man.

168
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:07,250
Well? Did it stop
your hiccups or not?

169
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,375
We could scare you again.

170
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:15,500
I got it. We can sneak
up during the marriage meeting

171
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,166
and lop off
Gennosuke's head.

172
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,916
That'll give her a good scare.

173
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,958
Nenki! The Iga will
not be responsible for

174
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,083
breaking the
No-Hostilities Pact!

175
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,958
Ha! I was just kidding.

176
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:28,666
Even I wouldn't do
something as crazy as that.

177
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,208
That's not a wager I would make.

178
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:37,791
Drink this.

179
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,125
Now take at least four sips

180
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,541
without any
breaths in between them.

181
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:46,708
Did it work?

182
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,666
It feels like they've stopped.

183
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:54,916
Danjo has just arrived with
the rest from the Kouga clan.

184
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,125
Oh, no, Akeginu...

185
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,500
There's no need
to worry, Oboro-sama.

186
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,625
I'll bring the tea
and bid them welcome.

187
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:05,000
No, I want to do that.

188
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,166
You have too much
on your mind to bother.

189
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,833
No, please let me do it!

190
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,041
Oboro--

191
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,958
Uh. Jingoro-dono...

192
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:37,041
After your little trick, I
guess there's no need for mine.

193
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:43,458
I guess he was trying to scare
the hiccups out of her too.

194
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:52,083
Tsubagakure...
It has not changed.

195
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:56,708
Ever since that day, time
has ceased in our village.

196
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:02,833
But no force on earth can hold
back these determined wrinkles.

197
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,125
You are not the only
one who has aged, Ogen.

198
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,291
I have brought tea for us.

199
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,708
Forgive me! I am so sorry!

200
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,250
Oboro-sama, what's wrong?

201
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,958
What? Did he not like you?

202
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:40,416
Wow. Those Iga guys are
so serious about their women.

203
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,458
Oboro...

204
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,708
Please, I ask your forgiveness.

205
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,916
I brought shame upon our people.

206
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,916
I don't deserve
what I have been given.

207
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,208
That is quite
enough of that, my dear.

208
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:19,708
It seems that Gennosuke
has taken a real liking to you.

209
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,083
I was told to tell you that

210
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:25,791
he wants very
much to see you again.

211
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:30,291
I have always known
that your womanly ways

212
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,500
would bring you good fortune.

213
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,666
Grandfather, there was
something different about

214
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,375
the eyes of Oboro.
I could not place it.

215
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,750
Ah, yes. You noticed.

216
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:57,958
Oboro has what we have come
to know as the mystic eye.

217
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,750
This means that her
eyes can dispel every form

218
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,416
of ninja art known to us.

219
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,416
However, she has
no knowledge of how to

220
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,041
control this extraordinary
power with which she was born.

221
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:13,000
Even her own people, her
allies, can be destroyed by it.

222
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:16,791
She was brought up as a child,
ignorant of the world that

223
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:20,833
exists between our clans.
She was chosen by Ogen as

224
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:23,458
the successor of the Iga people,

225
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:26,541
but she has never
been told of that day.

226
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:29,208
I for one would love
to see what happens if

227
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:32,083
you cast your ninja
eyes upon that Iga princess.

228
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,625
What do you say?

229
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:37,625
Her eyes are the key to
a life without bloodshed.

230
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:40,541
A simple glance from
her was all it took.

231
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,750
That hawk belongs to Ogen.

232
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:58,750
I pray now...

233
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:03,125
I pray that the Kouga and
the Iga will truly shed their

234
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:07,833
animosity and move forward
into a new world as one.

235
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:11,416
A united clan to
change the future for all.

236
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
One united clan to
change the future for all.

237
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:59,666
As the suspect tread
cautiously down Tokaido Road,

238
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,041
the spilled blood of
kinsmen pushes a band of

239
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:03,875
warriors to
their breaking point.

240
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:06,791
The mind's eye reflects
upon the horrors of the past,

241
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:10,791
and the only emotion that
rises to the surface is torment.

242
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:13,750
Facing nothing but a dark
future, those peering into

243
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:18,541
the abyss find tenuous prayers
that mask stealthy blades.

244
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:22,291
On the next Basilisk,
"Wandering Hearts."
