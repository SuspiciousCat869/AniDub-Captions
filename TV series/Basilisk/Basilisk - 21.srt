1
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,750
Two tribes sworn to hate...

2
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:32,500
Their bloodstained bodies
left out in the open to rot.

3
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:37,250
Their souls longing for a
peace that they failed to find.

4
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,625
As they sought to break
the shackles of darkness

5
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:42,375
and heal the
wounds of the past,

6
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:47,458
Fate denied their quest
and thrust them into war.

7
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,375
The bridges of
hope some dared to build

8
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:02,916
between them were torn asunder.

9
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:07,958
Their dreams were ripped from
their hearts with a sword...

10
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:11,958
with their destiny
revealed at last.

11
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,291
She said you will
never die from any wounds

12
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:09,750
because you are
an immortal ninja.

13
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:10,916
What?!

14
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:14,833
Immortal?

15
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:18,000
There are only two
ways to keep you dead.

16
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:21,291
Burning, if your
corpse is reduced to ashes,

17
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:24,375
or slicing your
head from your body.

18
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:28,041
Tenzen cannot be
killed? But no one knew.

19
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:32,208
Why can you not be seen? Is
it that you have been killed?

20
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:38,791
Tenzen-sama is not dead. It's
impossible if you didn't know.

21
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:45,541
You have such vast knowledge.
Akeginu told you this?

22
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,041
Yes.

23
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,375
I find it hard to believe
that one of the Iga ten would

24
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:52,750
reveal such a valuable
secret to a stranger.

25
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:56,166
It cannot be.
He is still alive.

26
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,750
All wounds on
you heal completely.

27
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:02,000
When they do, you awaken
like a bear from the winter.

28
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,791
Such an art...

29
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:08,166
This is something I feel I must
witness to in order to believe.

30
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,333
Now show us.

31
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:51,375
Yakushiji... Ten... zen...

32
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,541
But wait...

33
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:58,416
I thought that was your name.

34
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,208
You were dead...
I saw... your body...

35
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:06,708
That was nothing... Those
wounds were mere insect bites

36
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,666
against my power.

37
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,666
What's that?

38
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,458
Long ago, during
the Tensho Era wars,

39
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:48,916
one of the Iga possessed
the same ability as you.

40
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,083
Being proficient enough
to deceive the Kouga,

41
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,875
he performed his part without
as much as a second glance

42
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:56,291
from your people,
assuming the identity of

43
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,458
a leader of Manjidani.

44
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,625
The Tensho...

45
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:07,041
You... lie...

46
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:35,250
Kisaragi Saemon...

47
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,541
This is the
fate you chose when

48
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:41,166
you decided to
steal my identity.

49
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:04,958
Yes, Kagero...

50
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,541
Gennosuke-sama.

51
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:20,166
Oboro of the Iga is no more.

52
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:30,458
I see... Very well done.

53
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,375
Have you been injured?

54
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:37,166
I'm fine.

55
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:42,083
As is Saemon. He fought
well. He has infiltrated the

56
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,666
Ofuku party using his technique.

57
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,583
Gennosuke-sama...

58
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:01,791
As this bloody feud
finally comes to its end...

59
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:06,958
my one desire is to stay by
your side if you will have me.

60
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:12,125
Keep your touch from me
forever, I would still be happy.

61
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:17,208
My only wish is to see to
your every need. That's all.

62
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:24,500
Please... Please tell me
my request is not impossible!

63
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:29,000
If that's your wish...
It is not.

64
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,958
I know that once
the Iga are destroyed

65
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,708
and we take dominion
over Tokugawa,

66
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:37,041
peace will blanket the land.

67
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,291
There will be
no need for ninja,

68
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:42,000
no need for me
to continue living.

69
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:45,708
My sole wish is to serve
you. To give my life over

70
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,958
to your daily satisfaction.

71
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:53,041
In this, my duty will
finally be complete.

72
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,708
Of the Iga Ten,
only one remains.

73
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,750
Death is coming to you Oboro.

74
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,958
My hands will see to it.

75
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,916
Well... I assume you have
already heard what happened.

76
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,583
Yes, I have. Did
you forget the ninja code

77
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,166
forbids revealing
one's art to strangers?

78
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,791
I must. How very foolish
of me to forget such a thing.

79
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,875
In truth, it has not
been terribly long since I

80
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:40,833
became a ninja
for the Iga people.

81
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:45,125
I stumbled upon their
village a mere one hundred

82
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:50,000
and eighty years ago. I'm
still a tenderfoot I suppose.

83
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,833
You shouldn't
sell yourself short.

84
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:58,583
Immortality has greatly
sharpened your wits.

85
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,375
My wits were not the
only sharp thing that

86
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:04,500
Kouga felt as he
coughed up his bowels.

87
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,041
Wonderful.

88
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,416
You should know that
my men have been talking.

89
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,458
They say that they saw the slash
to your cheek heal on the spot.

90
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,458
Most of your men
have never taken a life.

91
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:24,208
They were so shocked by
this new experience I feel they

92
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:28,041
may have jumped to conclusions.
In their turmoil, they must have

93
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:31,375
seen things that
weren't necessarily there.

94
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,250
Oh, yes...

95
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:45,250
Very soon... At
Hamamatsu or Maisaka...

96
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:49,583
A Kouga woman will come seeking
me and I ask of you one thing.

97
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:53,458
Instruct your men to show her no
hostility or hinder her arrival.

98
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,791
Allow her to pass.

99
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,875
It will be done.

100
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,166
He rubs me, the wrong way.

101
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,375
Akeginu...

102
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:33,625
Please come back
to me. I need you.

103
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,375
Saemon-dono...

104
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,083
You're inside.

105
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:23,291
We'll see how crafty you are
when I defile your womanhood.

106
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:12,041
Saemon-dono... Where is Oboro?

107
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,500
You must stay
close to me, Kagero.

108
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:22,041
Be careful.
They are watching us.

109
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:25,208
But why? They didn't
seem suspicious of me.

110
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,750
Do they think you're
not who you appear to be?

111
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:30,041
They believe their eyes.
It's not me these people

112
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,625
don't trust,
Kagero... It's you.

113
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,541
By these
people, you mean Oboro.

114
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:37,750
She has no concept
of mistrust for anyone.

115
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,083
Then who?

116
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:42,583
Lady Ofuku. She does not
believe that a Kouga could

117
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:45,625
show disloyalty to
her people so easily.

118
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:02,291
After I told her the story
of how I stole your virginity,

119
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:05,166
she said that you were
an extremely shrewd woman

120
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,583
and that it was me who was the
one taken being advantage of.

121
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:12,625
Her suspicious nature
runs deep in her veins.

122
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:16,500
But then why was I even
allowed entry to this place?

123
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:20,291
To keep an eye
on you... Kagero...

124
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,000
Wait... Saemon-dono...

125
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:25,125
We must do whatever it
takes to earn their trust.

126
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,291
What are you doing? Tell me.

127
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,166
I told them all, that
I made you into a woman who

128
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,833
begged for the
flesh of the Iga.

129
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,791
If we are to prove
ourselves what we claim to be,

130
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:49,208
then we must show
them that I am not a liar.

131
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,208
You must allow this!

132
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,083
Please, wait--

133
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,833
Kagero...

134
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:11,708
Saemon-dono... You
must stop... My breath...

135
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:17,291
Yes, your breath.
Use it. Breathe deeply.

136
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:23,416
Moan with passion
and cry out in ecstasy.

137
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,750
No...

138
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:28,500
This is not
Saemon-dono. It can't be.

139
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,541
I do not know
how it is possible,

140
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,583
but I know who this is.

141
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:34,958
Tenzen!

142
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:39,583
But how?! How
is this happening?!

143
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:42,208
He's supposed to be dead!

144
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,666
Saemon-dono...

145
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,958
Saemon-dono is dead.

146
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:58,625
Damn you... Damn you, Tenzen!

147
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:24,916
Kagero...

148
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,250
Gennosuke-sama...

149
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,250
Gennosuke-sama...

150
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,625
Kagero...

151
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,791
Gennosuke-sama!

152
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,500
Sir! Tenzen-sama!

153
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,083
What is the problem?

154
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:50,125
Lady Ofuku! Something
awful has happened!

155
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:53,500
This Kouga wench we allowed
in has murdered Tenzen!

156
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:54,791
She did?

157
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,875
Did you find her
carrying a ninja scroll?

158
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,458
We found nothing.

159
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:08,125
Oboro... I want you to
cut this woman's throat!

160
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:13,000
You, are a cheat, Oboro! You
brought outsiders into this war

161
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,666
between the Iga
and Kouga peoples.

162
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,833
You've wrapped both
of our clans in shame!

163
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,833
And now you've
blinded yourself.

164
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:26,500
Don't you think
Tsubagakure deserves better?

165
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,208
You're no leader.

166
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,041
Oboro, listen to me.

167
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,500
I told Gennosuke-sama
that I killed you myself

168
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,083
and do you know
what his response was?

169
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,958
It surprised even me.

170
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:45,250
I doubted it would ever
come out of his mouth.

171
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,750
Any guess as to what
his words might have been?

172
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:01,375
He praised you. He
praised you for killing me.

173
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:11,041
Oboro, you foul-stinking
wench! I will kill you!

174
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:14,208
I'll strip your soul from your
body if I have to use my last

175
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:17,041
breath to do it! I will send
you to hell like I did Akeginu.

176
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:20,458
Why are you stalling?
Get over there and kill her!

177
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:21,833
These men cannot
hold me forever!

178
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:24,125
I can't stand to
listen to this any more!

179
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,833
I will not kill her.

180
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:31,125
Perhaps she is more useful
to us alive than dead.

181
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:32,791
How is that?

182
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,416
You see...

183
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,416
If we hold this woman hostage,
Gennosuke will certainly

184
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,375
come for her. This will bring
us our opportunity to kill him.

185
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:44,291
He must be dead
before we reach Sunpu.

186
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:47,791
Only then can we take
back the ninja scroll.

187
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:51,958
Without this in our possession,
the Iga will not claim victory.

188
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,500
I don't need that.

189
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,291
You have great potential.

190
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,625
Wait, mister...

191
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,750
Do you know how to play this?

192
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:38,791
What is your name young man?

193
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,166
Shinnosuke.

194
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:43,708
A good name. I am Gennosuke.

195
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:46,666
Well, it's nice to meet you.

196
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,250
Do you mind if I try it out?

197
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,541
Can you play
like my papa did?

198
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,000
Did this belong to him?

199
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,416
Gennosuke-sama...

200
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,750
I don't care if
my people hate me.

201
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:48,250
I only care that just once...

202
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:53,041
just one more time...
I want to see you.

203
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:58,250
I want to feel
you next to me.

204
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:05,541
I want to be in your
arms, one last time.

205
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:59,541
As an immortal takes away
life in an abandoned temple,

206
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:03,041
the one he seeks most,
journeys through darkness.

207
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:06,458
Iron needles pierce flesh,
carving dark letters onto

208
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:10,416
the snow-white canvas.
Cries of sheer mortal pain

209
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,750
shatter the silence of the
night, and a hero wanders.

210
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:18,541
His journey is long,
but his destination imminent.

211
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:22,000
On the next Basilisk,
"The Haunted."
