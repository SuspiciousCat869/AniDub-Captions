1
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:28,583
Two tribes sworn to hate...

2
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:32,250
Their bloodstained bodies
left out in the open to rot.

3
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:37,041
Their souls longing for a
peace that they failed to find.

4
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,458
As they sought to break
the shackles of darkness

5
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:42,166
and heal the
wounds of the past,

6
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:47,250
Fate denied their quest
and thrust them into war.

7
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:59,333
The bridges of
hope some dared to build

8
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:02,875
between them were torn asunder.

9
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:07,791
Their dreams were ripped from
their hearts with a sword...

10
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:11,791
with their destiny
revealed at last.

11
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,541
Damn! Now every
Kouga bastard in

12
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:07,291
Manjidani knows
of our intentions!

13
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,375
We have to hurry
back to Tsubagakure.

14
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:12,083
If we want to survive,
Gennosuke must die.

15
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,875
What is it?

16
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,250
She moves like a ninja.

17
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:52,916
We must approach with caution.

18
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
She may very well be one of the
Kouga Ten on Ieyasu's scroll.

19
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:33,666
I take it you are
a Kouga from Manjidani.

20
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:40,416
Please, do not be alarmed.
As you can see, we are Iga.

21
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,250
I'm sure you're
well aware that the Kouga

22
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:45,500
and the Iga are
no longer enemies.

23
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:50,625
Forgive me for not introducing
myself... I'm Tenzen.

24
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,916
It's a pleasure to
make your acquaintance.

25
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,708
I'm Okoi.

26
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,125
We actually just
came from Manjidani.

27
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:06,916
We were sent there
by Gennosuke-dono to

28
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,791
deliver a message
to your people.

29
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:12,875
I must say I have
seen warmer receptions.

30
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:15,583
They attacked us and we
barely escaped with our lives.

31
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:19,125
Hmm! Well, you shouldn't
take the Kouga so lightly!

32
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:22,291
But you see our dilemma.
We can't face Gennosuke

33
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:25,750
after failing him
like that. Not alone.

34
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:30,125
But if you came with us, I'm
sure he'd be more understanding.

35
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,250
Is Gennosuke-sama all right?

36
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,375
Young woman, your
question shows a lack of

37
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,041
faith in your leader.

38
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:39,208
Even if we had evil intentions,
his skill would prevent us

39
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:43,041
from acting on them.
Wouldn't you agree?

40
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,291
We agree on something.

41
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:51,416
So, will you accompany
us to Tsubagakure then?

42
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm sure Gennosuke-dono will
enjoy seeing a familiar face.

43
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,583
Thanks, but I think I'll pass.

44
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,333
She's mine!

45
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,833
That'll teach you!

46
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,916
You shouldn't get a
head of yourself young lady!

47
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,833
Didn't your elders
teach you confidence

48
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,916
is the quickest way to defeat!

49
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:13,875
Not yet, Nenki...
Let's keep her alive for now.

50
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,083
She may be of use to us.

51
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,708
Why show mercy? She's a Kouga.

52
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:21,625
We can use her as bait
when we kill Gennosuke.

53
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:25,750
Perhaps the compassion he shows
her may serve as his undoing.

54
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:59,750
I've fallen a full
day behind Kazamachi.

55
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,458
The Kouga are bound
to have the scroll by now.

56
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:27,541
Stay alive, Hotarubi!
Please! Stay alive!

57
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,541
Yashamaru-dono.

58
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,916
We must attack now!

59
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,416
You saw how many
men we lost out there!

60
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,291
What are we waiting for?!
Let's slay them all!

61
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:54,833
No, Gyobu.
That we can not do.

62
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:58,166
What do you mean?!
Why the hell not?!

63
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,625
Do you not remember?

64
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:03,458
Our future leader is visiting
Tsubagakure right now.

65
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:07,208
And besides, isn't that
what they expect from us?

66
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,375
To attack their
village in return?

67
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:12,500
Surely, the Iga have
laid some sort of trap for us.

68
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,583
Are we to leave
Gennosuke-sama in their

69
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:19,916
wretched village to die?!
Just because you fear a trap?!

70
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,458
Gennosuke-sama is not
one that the Iga can slay.

71
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,541
We must have
faith in his judgment.

72
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:26,625
But!

73
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,583
Listen. We won't
attack Tsubagakure but

74
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:33,291
we will go to make
sure he's well. But...

75
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:36,791
first there is something that
we must verify for ourselves.

76
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,250
It's Sunpu, isn't it?

77
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,416
Something unexpected
must have happened.

78
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,125
Why would they
attack us if the Iga

79
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,625
and Kouga are
in a time of peace?

80
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:48,416
Perhaps these particular Igas
were acting of their own accord.

81
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,750
It may have been their way of

82
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,000
rejecting the
standing peace agreement...

83
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:55,916
Some of us would do the
same if not for Hattori's Pact.

84
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,833
That's it. The
No-Hostilities Pact.

85
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:01,625
Could the treaty have
been nullified at Sunpu?

86
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,125
What?! How?!

87
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,791
Gyobu, you overheard
the Iga scheming.

88
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,625
You said that
their leader was intent on

89
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,625
attacking us
from the beginning.

90
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:16,208
That's right... I
overheard their plan.

91
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:19,250
They were clearly
intent on staging an attack.

92
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:22,458
Lets not take
unnecessary chances.

93
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:25,750
Kazamachi was a
formidable opponent alone.

94
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,666
The Iga came from
the North on Tokaido Road.

95
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,958
They sought to intercept
Kazamachi on his way back

96
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:35,500
from Sunpu, planning to kill
the courier bearing a secret

97
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:38,666
from Danjo-sama.
He engaged them in battle,

98
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,708
but death has claimed him.

99
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:43,583
They know something
that we do not.

100
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:46,541
But how? Tsubagakure
is much farther from

101
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,916
Sunpu than Manjidani.
Their messenger should

102
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,875
still be on the way there.

103
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:54,041
So then! We'll beat
them at their own game!

104
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:04,208
Let me kill the first.

105
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,375
Yashamaru! Yashamaru!

106
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,291
Who goes there?!

107
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:49,708
Yashamaru. Don't
you recognize my voice?

108
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:52,125
It is I. Tenzen.

109
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:55,291
Where are you?!
Show yourself!

110
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:58,875
Tenzen-sama!
Come out! I beg you!

111
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:05,583
Do not be alarmed
by my absence, Yashamaru.

112
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:08,625
Impeding circumstances
prohibit me.

113
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:11,958
Now, why have you
returned from Sunpu?

114
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:16,083
It's of the utmost
importance, Tenzen-sama!

115
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,541
I see... Tell me
what took place at

116
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,541
Sunpu that
hastened your return.

117
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,916
But you must tell
me something first!

118
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,791
Why can you not be
seen? I fear I know.

119
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,625
Could you have been killed?

120
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,708
Killed?

121
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,708
I should have
known... Who did it?

122
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:37,416
It wasn't that Kouga
named Kazamachi, was it?

123
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:44,041
Yes, it was he... an
opponent too strong to defeat.

124
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:47,625
I beg your
forgiveness Tenzen-sama...

125
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,750
It's all my fault.
All because I...

126
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,500
I wasn't able
to stop Kouga Danjo.

127
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:55,750
Ieyasu's ninja
scroll got to them first.

128
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,083
Ieyasu's ninja scroll?!

129
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:03,333
Hotarubi! Is she... Have
the Kouga killed all our clan?!

130
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,958
Rest assured. They are all well.

131
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:11,541
Yashamaru... Tell me..
What was on the scroll?

132
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,958
Ten names from
each clan were forged.

133
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:18,541
Now after all these years the
Iga can finally show no mercy.

134
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,583
The time has
come Tenzen-sama.

135
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,833
With Hattori-sama
present, the Retired Shogun

136
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,875
nullified the
No-Hostilities Pact!

137
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:25,875
What?!

138
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:29,125
He's found us out!

139
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,000
I've got you, Kouga!

140
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,041
He must be one
of the Kouga Ten!

141
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:48,708
I can make up for my failures
if I can bring back his head!

142
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,416
Now feel the
agony of my Kokujo!

143
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,583
Yasha... maru...

144
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,875
I'm indebted to you.
You saved my life.

145
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,500
I wanted to keep
him alive so we could

146
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:22,791
get more information out
of him, but I had no choice.

147
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,666
He was too dangerous.

148
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,625
He made an amazing
revelation, didn't he?

149
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:31,208
Yes, It's just
as Hyoma thought.

150
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:34,458
The No-Hostilities
Pact has been dissolved.

151
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,708
But why would Lord
Ieyasu forge the names of

152
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:39,625
ten ninjas from each clan?

153
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,375
I don't know.

154
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,291
You were in such a
hurry. Is everything okay?

155
00:16:57,375 --> 00:17:02,000
Yes, just fine...
Hot jasmine. Who's that for?

156
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,000
Oh, this. Didn't you hear?

157
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,750
Tenzen and the
others just got back.

158
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:06,875
Really?!

159
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:35,916
Gennosuke-sama!
My scout! He returned!

160
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,291
Take a deep breath.

161
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:53,333
Udono-sama is safe and
sound in Kouga Manjidani.

162
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:56,750
Apparently, he arrived
there early this morning.

163
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,458
That's good news.

164
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,000
Very good...

165
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:03,958
Tenzen and the others you met in
the forest got back as well.

166
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,875
I was a little worried
to tell you the truth.

167
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:08,208
I-I think they're all
trying hard, but I know there

168
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:11,166
are some who still
disapprove of the truce.

169
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,375
Are you listening to me?

170
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,083
Huh. O-Oh.

171
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:20,333
I-I must have let my
thoughts wander again.

172
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:23,125
Thank you for granting
my favor, Oboro-dono.

173
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,375
All is well on my end.

174
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:53,208
The Kouga girl is tied up and
hidden away in the Salt-locker.

175
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,666
Nobody saw me.

176
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,291
Well done... And Gennosuke?

177
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,875
He's suspicious all right.

178
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:02,375
He had Oboro-sama send a scout
to Manjidani to check on Udono.

179
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,416
But we intercepted him.

180
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,583
He told her that he
saw Udono and he's just fine.

181
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:10,583
She's telling this
to Gennosuke as we speak.

182
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,208
Will he believe her?

183
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,500
Why wouldn't he?
She's not lying.

184
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:18,250
As far as she knows, Udono
is as happy as a pig in slop.

185
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,833
How can he suspect
treachery in those

186
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:22,625
crystal-clear eyes
when there is none?

187
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,375
Those beautiful, adoring
eyes so full of devotion.

188
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,083
To think that they
will send her true love

189
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,125
straight to his death.

190
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:35,250
Heh, heh. You must admit
that it's terribly amusing.

191
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:38,500
And risky. How
long must this go on?

192
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,125
This was not isn't our doing.

193
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:43,333
Wouldn't it be better
to tell Oboro-sama the truth?

194
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,375
I'm afraid this bodes ill.

195
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,375
If Yashamaru
hasn't returned by now,

196
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:57,291
we can probably count
him among the dead.

197
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:03,958
Look at her. She'll be
crushed if he doesn't return.

198
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:07,416
I hope it doesn't
affect her ability to fight.

199
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,041
Gennosuke-sama!

200
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,500
What? I was being serious!

201
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:20,000
Listen to how happy she is.
Ignorance can be merciless.

202
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:23,625
When we do kill Gennosuke,
that will be Oboro-sama.

203
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:27,833
Numb to the world, feeling only
the pain of her longing heart.

204
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:30,750
Mmm.

205
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,875
Should we go back to Manjidani

206
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,666
and tell them
what we've learned?

207
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,125
Time is too precious.

208
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,333
Mmm...

209
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,166
I know we have scouts
lurking along this road but

210
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,208
it will be best if we
go to Tsubagakure alone.

211
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:01,083
You and I are the only
Kougas who have any chance of

212
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:05,000
rescuing Gennosuke-sama.
Brute force isn't the answer

213
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:08,750
on this mission. It's going
to take cunning and guile.

214
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:20,166
Go ahead, tell me... How's it
feel to be a member of the Iga?

215
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,875
Young woman...

216
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,625
Warriors in disguise set out
to unearth the hidden deception.

217
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:01,458
Accepted as one of their own,

218
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:04,416
the freedom to
roam is granted.

219
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,916
Beauty bound and shackled.

220
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,625
Silent cries for help
escape into the night.

221
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:14,833
Hope evanescent, an innocent
maiden about to be violated,

222
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:18,541
transforms into
a dungeon of flesh.

223
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:22,875
On the next Basilisk,
"The Bloodsucking Seductress."
