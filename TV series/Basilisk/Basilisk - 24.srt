1
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:18,125
Through all these years,
you have never changed.

2
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:24,583
Hey... Wake up, Kouga.

3
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:31,708
We've arrived at
Hattori Hanzo-sama's estate.

4
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:51,666
Oboro of the Iga.
May I enter?

5
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,958
Yes.

6
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:11,375
I am Kyohachiro,
son of Masanari...

7
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:17,416
Hanzo the II... Adopted by
Masahiro... or Hanzo the IV.

8
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,166
It is an honor to
make your acquaintance.

9
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:25,083
You don't remember me.
I suppose you were quite young.

10
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:48,041
This horrible war...

11
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:51,083
It has sent your clans
spinning out of control.

12
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,166
And we are responsible.

13
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,041
You must hate us
for what we've done.

14
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:03,708
I wish that none of
this had ever happened.

15
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,333
Do you carry a sword with you?

16
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,166
No, I do not.

17
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,250
Very well.

18
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,375
You will use this.

19
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:26,750
Please take it.
It's a fine sword.

20
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:35,083
I am grateful. Thank you.

21
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:43,291
Use it well. Is there
anything you desire?

22
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,125
Where is Gennosuke
of the Kouga?

23
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:05,208
Not too far from here.
He is conscious.

24
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:07,375
But I don't
know for how long.

25
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:10,125
Bring him to me. The
only thing the man needs to

26
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,958
be able to do is stand.

27
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,583
Yes, my lady.

28
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:33,541
These events, have struck
across time like lightning.

29
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,791
Ten days and nights have

30
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:38,625
brought this wretched
concept to a brutal end.

31
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,583
The frost is finally melting.

32
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:24,250
This harsh winter
will soon be over.

33
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,875
I've longed for spring...

34
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:29,541
So many things that were
old become new once again.

35
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,125
Oboro-dono.

36
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:51,083
It's no matter. I'd wait
forever, Oboro-dono.

37
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:43,333
I was on my way to Ise.

38
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,791
That is when by coincidence,

39
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,083
I stumbled upon
this clan conflict.

40
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,416
But I assure you
I have not interfered.

41
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,708
I have not favored
one faction over the other,

42
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,791
and I ask you to be
my witness to this fact.

43
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:57,583
As this conflict's referee,
it is your duty to

44
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:01,250
report these dealings
to Retired Shogun Ieyasu.

45
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,458
My only wish is that you

46
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:05,625
represent my
position to him truthfully.

47
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:08,458
Is this something
you will be able to do?

48
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,208
As you say, it is my duty.

49
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,916
Good. Kouga Gennosuke
seems to have been blinded by

50
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,791
the Iga at some point. Possibly
when they beat him into the

51
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:19,958
condition in which we found
him. I don't believe this to be

52
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,708
a problem considering
this is a ninja duel.

53
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,125
Would that be correct?

54
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:27,208
Yes. However, you're continuing
insistence that you have

55
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:29,125
been uninvolved
in this ninja war

56
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,500
may cause suspicions in some.

57
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,833
Perhaps I should
tell him, you seem anything

58
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,916
but honest in
this matter, my lady.

59
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:46,625
Is there anything you desire?

60
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,916
There is little I can do now.

61
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,333
But I can at
least hear a request.

62
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:56,916
Thank you, but no.
There is nothing I desire.

63
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,708
Very well then.

64
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,375
Hattori-sama?

65
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:14,541
There is something...

66
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,916
If you would be so kind...

67
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,791
there is something I would
like for you to hold for me.

68
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,041
Yes...

69
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,375
This...

70
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,250
Please keep it safe.

71
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,708
Is this an
heirloom of your people?

72
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,833
Or is this special to you?

73
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:49,291
This is my people's. It
is our prayer for the future.

74
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:57,583
You'll have it
when this is over.

75
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,291
But if I fall...

76
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:04,500
If I fall... I do
not know to whom it goes.

77
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,791
With all certainty,
you will walk away today.

78
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,833
Kouga Gennosuke is
in no condition to fight.

79
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,250
The battle is half won.

80
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,416
Oboro...

81
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,500
It would be merciful of
you to strike him down quickly.

82
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:24,125
Send him into death with honor.

83
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,916
Yes...

84
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,833
Gennosuke-sama...

85
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,125
What is going on here?!

86
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:34,041
Oboro! Raise your sword
and strike down that Kouga!

87
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:24,541
I love you...
Gennosuke-sama.

88
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:08,625
Someone cut his
head off before she dies!

89
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,500
This cannot happen!

90
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,750
Fools...

91
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,791
Oboro...

92
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,416
Oboro...

93
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,916
Father?

94
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:37,416
Were those two... in love?

95
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,666
Kyohachiro.

96
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,125
Yes.

97
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:58,625
It reads, "The last on to
write on this scroll is I..."

98
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,083
"The Iga leader... Oboro."

99
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:14,250
Who would have imagined,
that in this final moment,

100
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:19,333
in this manner, the Takechiyo
faction would emerge victorious.

101
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:24,625
This is the end of me.
My glorious life is over.

102
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:28,875
That woman surely
has the devil's luck.

103
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:38,083
The Iga have won the war.
Now go inform Sunpu.

104
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:55,083
I see a time when you
and I could stand together

105
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:57,708
and feel the
breeze across our face.

106
00:18:57,791 --> 00:19:00,083
A time when our
dreams were the same.

107
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:03,750
Of the same place.
Of the same feelings.

108
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:13,083
Sometimes this thought crosses
my mind, when I least expect it.

109
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:17,916
This thought is that you
and I were once a single soul.

110
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,208
One soul split
into two equal parts,

111
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:23,041
which now longs
to be together again.

112
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:26,458
I feel this as truly as I
feel the rain in the spring,

113
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:29,708
or the love for
all of my ancestors.

114
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:35,750
And that is why... That is why
I feel so strongly toward you.

115
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:40,708
If we are indeed one soul...
we will bond without fail.

116
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:46,125
Such a journey may
take a thousand lifetimes.

117
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:50,083
Across the vast
expanse of as many worlds.

118
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:53,666
But... it will happen.

119
00:19:58,041 --> 00:19:59,916
It will happen.

120
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:13,375
Are you going to Aekuni Temple?

121
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:17,583
I am. I would like
to make an offering.

122
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:24,333
Perhaps you should consider
traveling with a companion.

123
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:25,833
I would rather not.

124
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:29,250
This is something
I feel I should do myself.

125
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:31,916
That is very admirable of you.

126
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:35,250
But, father... tell me...

127
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:38,833
The scroll that the
late Lord Ieyasu possessed,

128
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:41,000
the one from the ninja war.

129
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:44,625
Do you know what became of it?

130
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,125
I do not.

131
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:19,000
The time of peace
has finally arrived.

132
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:22,458
Iga Tsubagakure and
Kouga Manjidani fought

133
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:25,541
and died for the
sake of the Tokugawa.

134
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:30,000
Each told that glory and
prosperity awaited the victor.

135
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:36,541
These days, distance is
still kept between the clans,

136
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:40,333
but I do hear word of some
who associate with the other.

137
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,541
Oboro... Gennosuke... And
all of your fallen comrades who

138
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:52,541
have faded into the
darkness of history...

139
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I will live each day the
rest of my life, remembering.

140
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:05,000
For the least I can do...

141
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:09,083
is to never forget.
