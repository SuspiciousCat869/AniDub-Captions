1
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:28,916
Two tribes sworn to hate...

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,625
Their bloodstained bodies
left out in the open to rot.

3
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:37,375
Their souls longing for a
peace that they failed to find.

4
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:39,750
As they sought to break
the shackles of darkness

5
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:42,458
and heal the
wounds of the past,

6
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:47,541
Fate denied their quest
and thrust them into war.

7
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,541
The bridges of
hope some dared to build

8
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:03,083
between them were torn asunder.

9
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:08,083
Their dreams were ripped from
their hearts with a sword...

10
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:12,083
with their destiny
revealed at last.

11
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,333
Gennosuke-sama...

12
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,666
The darkest places
inside me expected this

13
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,833
to unfold as it has...

14
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:25,750
I know this is difficult
to hear, but you must...

15
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:28,666
You were being deceived
by Oboro of the Iga.

16
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,541
She is Ogen's granddaughter
and she will always think of

17
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,708
her own people first.
As the leader of the clan now,

18
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:37,750
there is no way she was ignorant
of her subordinates' plans.

19
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:40,833
She invited you to Tsubagakure
for her own reasons.

20
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:44,916
While she may be
right... consider this...

21
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,375
Oboro we do not see clearly.

22
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:51,083
So we need to concern ourselves
with her subordinates.

23
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:54,291
The orders to attack may have
come from behind Oboro's back.

24
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,666
Most likely from Tenzen.

25
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,291
I believe it is
possible that Oboro was

26
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,291
ignorant of this all along.

27
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:01,791
You're defending her?!

28
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,541
The engagement
between Gennosuke-sama

29
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,875
and that woman was
a tragedy and a farce.

30
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,500
She used his trust
to facilitate an attack!

31
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,541
Can you not
see what happened?!

32
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,458
His desire for
peace was his weakness

33
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,958
and she got close enough
to him to manipulate that.

34
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:17,416
I see many ways
this may have happened.

35
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,250
But the man of whom you speak
sits in this room, and I serve

36
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:23,291
him alone. I will not
allow you to disrespect him by

37
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:26,833
pointing out unfounded
weaknesses in his constitution.

38
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:30,208
Keep on this path and you will
end up no better than the Iga.

39
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:33,375
Does it even matter
who did what?! It's done!

40
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,541
The day has arrived.
We strike while

41
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,708
the iron is hot and end this.

42
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:38,875
Gennosuke-sama, please...

43
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,041
Attacking now
is the best option!

44
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,541
They are still shaking
in their skins from

45
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,458
the fear you put
to in them earlier.

46
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:47,625
They wouldn't expect us
to attack in a second wave.

47
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:52,416
Please... Gennosuke-sama,
speak to us.

48
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:07,791
Now Saemon. I need you to
bring me a brush and some ink.

49
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,041
Yes.

50
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,458
And about Okoi...

51
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,166
I am sorry.

52
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:20,583
Okoi... She
was a Kouga ninja...

53
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:24,000
Like all of us.

54
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:32,833
Right. But we must not forget
that we are all human beings.

55
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,875
The Kouga and the Iga...

56
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:37,083
We are all the same
in birth and in death.

57
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,583
All of us human, we need
to break these bindings of

58
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,583
hatred and revenge
which hold us.

59
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,000
We need to open our
eyes to the other side.

60
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:47,541
To the Iga... even if
it is only one of them.

61
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,958
Then that one we will try
to know and better understand.

62
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,625
Upon my return, those
are the words I intend to

63
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,875
speak to whoever will listen.

64
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,666
What's the matter with you?

65
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,708
Why aren't you
opening your eyes?

66
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,375
My grandmother
told me something

67
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:26,291
many years ago that
I have never forgotten.

68
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,541
That's enough, Oboro.

69
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,875
Don't strain yourself
to the point of injury.

70
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:36,000
That's not what we want.

71
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,916
No one knows
more than I the effort

72
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,541
you've put into your training.

73
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:43,000
How serious you take all of this
will never come into question.

74
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:51,875
This is embarrassing. I am the
future leader of Tsubagakure.

75
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,833
You are. And yet
you lack the power to

76
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:58,083
master a single
one of the ninja arts.

77
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:04,041
There is no shame
in being... unskilled.

78
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,583
What you lack in physical
prowess, you make up for

79
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:12,833
with a mysterious power.
And it is no ninja art.

80
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:15,916
It is something dwelling
deep within your eyes.

81
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,458
And it spells out the end.

82
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:24,208
The downfall of the Tsubagakure
ninja. That is what I fear.

83
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,166
You will witness this day.

84
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,625
You will see the darkness.

85
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:32,125
As it falls, our people
will be called into battle

86
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:36,041
in ways never seen before.
And we will be forced to

87
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,166
entertain thoughts
we never imagined.

88
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,083
When these days
are upon you, you must

89
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:43,125
apply this yamishichiya
potion to your eyes.

90
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,625
The seven nights' darkness.

91
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:48,041
It will seal your
vision from the inside out,

92
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,541
making pitch the
woes of your eyes.

93
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:53,625
Yami... shichiya?

94
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:56,083
It will cause
you no pain, my dear.

95
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:59,208
But your eyes will stay closed.

96
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:04,500
Seven days and seven nights...
my eyes will be sealed shut.

97
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,208
And you have done this?

98
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:10,416
You sealed your eyes, blinding
yourself to everything!

99
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,875
Our words here are
of value to this clan.

100
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,500
Have you not heard
one thing we said?!

101
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,500
I am the leader
of the Iga people

102
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:21,208
and every single member
of my clan is valuable to me.

103
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,208
I have heard what
you said and know that

104
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,708
I can say nothing
to change your mind.

105
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,666
I understand the pain
that has been inflicted on

106
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:31,500
our clan by the Kouga, but I
cannot fight Gennosuke-sama.

107
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:35,583
I will not betray my heart.
Neither can I forsake my people.

108
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:39,041
I must convince you that this
is the right course of action.

109
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,166
And so with the
choice that I've made,

110
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,500
I can neither deceive my
people nor cause any harm.

111
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:55,458
All that I fear...
All that I fear is coming true.

112
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,750
What has she done?

113
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,791
Tenzen-sama!

114
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:06,000
What is the reason
for this interruption?

115
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,208
This box was left at the gate.

116
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,666
Why would they return
Ieyasu's ninja scroll?

117
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,125
I guess Gennosuke
just finally lost his mind.

118
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:28,583
I don't think so.
Look at Koshiro's name.

119
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,791
It hasn't been crossed out.

120
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,541
Damn him.

121
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,166
He knew Koshiro would live.

122
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,041
The injuries he sustained
certainly looked fatal.

123
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:42,083
But Gennosuke knew better.
He hasn't lost his mind at all.

124
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,958
So why return
the scroll to us?!

125
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,166
He would be a fool to ignore

126
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,000
the only way to
legitimize a Kouga victory.

127
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:54,125
Tenzen-sama.
What does the letter say?

128
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:59,166
It is from Gennosuke.
A challenge to us.

129
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,500
A what?!

130
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:05,041
The No-Hostilities Pact
that has bound our people for

131
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:08,333
so long has been nullified.
However, I do not intend to

132
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:11,666
resume this fight because
I see no purpose behind it.

133
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,000
Why should I
kill in the name of

134
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,375
something I do
not believe nor see?

135
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:18,625
Questions such as this have
compelled me to travel to Sunpu

136
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:21,458
and ask retired Shogun
Ieyasu and Hattori-dono for

137
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:26,333
guidance in these matters. And
so, I return the scroll to you.

138
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:29,291
On this journey I
take with me Kasumi Gyobu,

139
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:33,125
Kisaragi Saemon,
Muroga Hyoma, and Kagero.

140
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,625
You might have thought we
would come to your village,

141
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:39,958
but we will not. We are
already on the Tokaido Road.

142
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:44,291
Know this, if in your anger and
purity of rage you decide to

143
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:48,458
slay a single Kouga, all the
wrath of the next world will

144
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:51,791
fall upon the Iga
and destroy you all.

145
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,000
My desire to fight is
absent, but I will in no way

146
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:58,666
alter my own path
to avoid an attack.

147
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,833
We know there
are seven of you left.

148
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:05,166
If you do attack, you will leave
us with no choice but to resist.

149
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,375
And if before we
reach the gates of Sunpu,

150
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,000
we engage in a battle to the
death between the Kouga Five

151
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:13,250
and the Iga Seven,
then so be it.

152
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,791
If you have no fear,

153
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:18,041
take your whips to your horses
and get on the Tokaido Road.

154
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:21,125
We eagerly await your response.

155
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:25,333
Tenzen!

156
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,666
We leave. And hunt them down.

157
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,833
He counts me among the seven.

158
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:39,333
Nenki. Hotarubi.
Find out where they are on

159
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,541
the Tokaido Road
and report back.

160
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:42,458
Yes, Tenzen-sama.

161
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:43,875
And hurry.

162
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:47,958
Time is a luxury we cannot
afford today. Understand?

163
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,125
I understand completely.

164
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:54,250
Oboro-sama, I will make
all necessary preparations.

165
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:37,083
No one is following us.

166
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,791
You can let your
guard down some, Hyoma.

167
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,500
Surely they wouldn't
take the chance of

168
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,833
pursuing us through
the Kouga Valley.

169
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:48,166
You're right. They will
most likely use the Iga route.

170
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,916
The road to Sunpu is long.

171
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,625
I wonder, when
will our paths cross?

172
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:57,833
You should let that go. In war,
the victor always moves first.

173
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,333
I can't understand why
Gennosuke-sama returned the

174
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:03,250
scroll to the Iga. And then
he wants to trek all the way to

175
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,750
Sunpu to find out
the reason for fighting?!

176
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,750
To think that we have been
anything other than enemies for

177
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:10,000
the past four
hundred years is absurd!

178
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:13,416
We don't need a reason
to avenge our parents' deaths!

179
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,541
If I hadn't been such a runt,

180
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,583
I could have done
something that day.

181
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:23,541
I am not going to let
this chance pass me by.

182
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:24,791
You must understand why

183
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:27,083
Gennosuke-sama
returned the scroll.

184
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:29,416
He knows how the Iga think,
and he is sure that they

185
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,666
will come after us
once the message is read.

186
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,375
Which part of the message?

187
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:36,291
The challenge of course.
There isn't an Iga alive who

188
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:39,000
would stay away from
a fight after reading that.

189
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:41,083
When they find us,
we slaughter them.

190
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,625
Then take back the scroll.

191
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,000
I doubt you'll
take issue with that.

192
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,333
My issues don't
rest with Iga blood.

193
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,458
I fear Gennosuke-sama
might not have it in him

194
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:53,041
to kill Oboro
when the time comes.

195
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,541
Gyobu? Gyobu where did you go?

196
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,916
We shall meet again, Hyoma.

197
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:10,000
Damn, Tenzen. Who is he to
order me around like his lackey?

198
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,708
That certainly
sounds like Gyobu.

199
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,750
Rushing out on
his own like that.

200
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:24,208
Gennosuke-sama was very
angry when he found out.

201
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:28,333
I'm surprised he got so upset.
Usually he's much calmer.

202
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:31,083
I really should give Gyobu
credit. There is something to

203
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:34,166
be said for circling
back around on the enemy.

204
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,916
It is a classic move.

205
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,375
A part of me wishes I had
thought of the plan myself.

206
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:42,958
Gyobu is definitely a
force to be reckoned with.

207
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,541
The Iga killed his father.

208
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:47,541
Therefore, he harbors
a deep hatred for them.

209
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,375
This vengeance mentality
he has makes me fear that

210
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,458
he may act too hastily.

211
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,958
You do not
cause me such fear,

212
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,791
for you are of a
much gentler temperament.

213
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,041
That's not it.

214
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:03,708
We have another
that warrants concern.

215
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,041
You mean Kagero.

216
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,083
I do.

217
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,916
She is deeply in
love with Gennosuke-sama.

218
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Once his engagement
to Oboro was announced,

219
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,750
Kagero had to bottle
her feelings. But with the

220
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:17,833
way things are moving,
they are surfacing again,

221
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:21,208
only now she does not
realize their intensity.

222
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,583
Her desire will overwhelm her.

223
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,916
I have heard that she is the
same as her mother before her.

224
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,791
At the height of ecstasy,
the cry of passion becomes

225
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:34,625
the sigh of death. Her breath,
hot with sensual desires,

226
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:38,833
transforms into poison, slaying
her partner within seconds.

227
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:41,625
At least that is the
way I understand it to be.

228
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:45,541
Fate has always been Kagero's
bitter enemy. Then again,

229
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:49,041
women are frightening creatures
no matter how you look at them.

230
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,041
You may enter.

231
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,458
What's wrong?

232
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,958
I was curious. Will
we be taking a boat out of

233
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,833
the Kuwana port tomorrow?

234
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,708
The weather will decide that
for us. It is possible that

235
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,541
moving on the mountain
paths around Sayaji

236
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:36,958
might be less dangerous.
If that's all then, goodnight.

237
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:40,875
Not yet. I mean, I wanted to
know what you were thinking.

238
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,375
Is it not obvious?

239
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:43,750
Gennosuke-sama,

240
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,916
you must stop thinking
about that Iga woman.

241
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,791
Danjo-sama said
something interesting to me

242
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:53,250
before he left for Sunpu.
He said the time had come to

243
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:57,208
find Kagero a mate.
A man to share herself with.

244
00:17:57,291 --> 00:18:00,291
Why? So she can have
a baby girl all of her own?

245
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,833
A noble cause, I suppose,

246
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:05,375
but how many men are
going to have to die for it?

247
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,333
Like all women,
she wants a child.

248
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:09,083
And I hear there
are many men willing to

249
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,708
put it on the line for her.

250
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:15,041
She is beautiful. I doubt you
could find anyone to disagree.

251
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,708
But that is what
makes her so frightening.

252
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,416
Uh, Kagero?

253
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,333
Gennosuke-sama...

254
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:26,333
Please hold me in your arms.

255
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,375
Kagero look into my eyes.

256
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:46,708
Kagero... why?

257
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:51,041
Because I want to die.
I want to die with you.

258
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:54,125
Don't be a fool. If you
want to die, wait until

259
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:57,625
after we've removed every Iga
name from the Ieyasu's scroll.

260
00:18:58,625 --> 00:18:59,416
And then...

261
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,208
It ends.

262
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:04,625
I cannot use my technique
on any of the Iga women.

263
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:07,250
Which begs a question.

264
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:12,750
When face to face with
her, can you kill Oboro?

265
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,666
I can.

266
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,625
I know my place.

267
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:27,625
I will gladly give my body
over to all of the Iga men.

268
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,125
And one by one,
they will meet their doom

269
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:33,250
in a fit of stolen rapture.

270
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,541
No! The poison!

271
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,333
Gennosuke-sama!

272
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:43,875
Saemon!

273
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,750
What happened to you?!

274
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,166
Gennosuke-sama!

275
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,750
My eyes... The poison
got into my eyes.

276
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,333
You're blind?

277
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,375
Finding them didn't
prove to be too difficult.

278
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:04,750
Wouldn't you agree?

279
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,291
Yes.

280
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,375
I don't see Gyobu
down there with them.

281
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,166
I know what he did.

282
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,500
He doubled back to try
and get Oboro from the rear.

283
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,625
Sneaky bastard.

284
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,333
Hotarubi, you have to
get to the others immediately

285
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:23,375
and warn them that danger is
on the way. And watch your back.

286
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,333
What about those remaining?

287
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:29,041
Yes... Just leave them to me.

288
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,875
And so I shall.

289
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:44,166
When I finish
this single-handedly,

290
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,958
Tenzen will look
like a red-faced fool.

291
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,166
You are one of the Iga.

292
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:05,166
You're looking at the man
who will slay all the Kouga!

293
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,750
But I guess that doesn't mean
much to the ones who can't see!

294
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:11,750
So... What do you say, Hyoma?

295
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:15,041
Whose head is going to be
the first one on the platter?

296
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,458
Look... Hyoma...

297
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:20,000
What?! Have you lost
your mind, Gennosuke?

298
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,458
Don't you realize he's just
as blind as you are?

299
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:26,125
I had no idea the leader
of the Kouga was such a fool!

300
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,250
We move on.

301
00:23:57,291 --> 00:24:01,625
As tears of blood stain smooth
skin, a lone warrior sets out

302
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:04,875
on a quest for vengeance,
which boils inside,

303
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:10,333
cursing his fate as well as his
journey. Inside quiet minds,

304
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:12,708
despair for the loss of
what they never controlled

305
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:15,416
moves like eels
beneath the surface...

306
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,583
and their hearts become
as blind as their eyes.

307
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,833
On the next Basilisk,
"Remembrance."
