1
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:28,791
Two tribes sworn to hate...

2
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:32,500
Their bloodstained bodies
left out in the open to rot.

3
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:37,250
Their souls longing for a
peace that they failed to find.

4
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,666
As they sought to break
the shackles of darkness

5
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,333
and heal the
wounds of the past,

6
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:47,416
Fate denied their quest
and thrust them into war.

7
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,416
The bridges of
hope some dared to build

8
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,958
between them were torn asunder.

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,958
Their dreams were ripped from
their hearts with a sword...

10
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:11,958
with their destiny
revealed at last.

11
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:09,041
Kunichiyo-sama, please
pull yourself together!

12
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:12,291
Kunichiyo-sama!
Kunichiyo-sama?!

13
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:26,083
My, my... Lady Oeyo,
you look concerned.

14
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:27,541
What is the matter?

15
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,500
What is the matter? Someone
tried to poison Lord Kunichiyo!

16
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,250
I'm sure of it!

17
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,625
We must all give thanks
that his life was spared.

18
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:39,291
But we have to find
the saboteur who did this.

19
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:41,125
I shall report this to

20
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,541
the retired Shogun
Ieyasu in Sunpu right away.

21
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,708
You will do no such thing.

22
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,833
With the matter of
succession at the forefront of

23
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:50,791
all thoughts these
days, I feel that unwise.

24
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:53,750
Stirring up emotions
during such volatile times

25
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,500
would only come
back to haunt us.

26
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:59,166
Well then,
what do you suggest?

27
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:05,416
Lord Takechiyo, you have
such a powerful swing.

28
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:08,416
I have an idea.

29
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,833
Perhaps you could tell
that she-fox out there

30
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:13,625
the same words you
have spoken to me.

31
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:59,916
Kouga. Kouga Gennosuke...

32
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:04,333
It's one of the Igas!

33
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,791
Gennosuke-sama...

34
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:45,083
Kagero, lead Gennosuke-sama as
far away from here as you can.

35
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,625
But what will you do?

36
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,500
Hyoma, please.

37
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:51,458
Gennosuke-sama,
you must look deeply into

38
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:55,125
the heart of this
world if you seek truth.

39
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:02,833
Hyoma...

40
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,666
Take him and go!

41
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,041
Kagero!

42
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,458
We must go!

43
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,083
Gennosuke!

44
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,000
Stop!

45
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,750
Koshiro! Look at me!

46
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:35,916
Hawk, where have
you taken position?

47
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Use your wings and reveal
the location of my enemy.

48
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,250
It is as I suspected.

49
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:46,666
This is the one whose eyes
Gennouske-sama rendered useless.

50
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,875
I do not fare well.

51
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:16,666
How I wish to gaze
upon that view again.

52
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,333
Gennosuke-sama...

53
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:50,166
Where are you Kouga? From
which direction will you attack?

54
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,625
I've made a mistake.

55
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:58,541
Hyoma, you've arrived.

56
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:09,291
Danjo-sama, I received
word that you summoned me.

57
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:13,250
Yes I did. Do you
know this young boy here?

58
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:24,375
This boy is his mother's
son through and through.

59
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:28,416
Your older sister's blood flows
strongly through his veins.

60
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,958
I want you to train him.

61
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:35,750
Train him in the
manner of your eyes.

62
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:43,625
I want him strong.
Stronger than I've ever been.

63
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,375
Do you feel you
can accomplish this?

64
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,375
I do. Though we must
consider...

65
00:10:56,458 --> 00:11:01,916
Sometimes a keen vision
can create more problems.

66
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:32,375
What do you
think of him? Hyoma?

67
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,000
I think he is
a perfect candidate.

68
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:40,250
That child has
greatness inside him.

69
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:17,041
Do you enjoy the birdcalls
before dusk, Gennosuke-sama?

70
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:25,250
I don't need birds.
They're useless to me!

71
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:28,250
Don't be such an oaf.
In order to become a man,

72
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,791
you must first
learn to appreciate

73
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,125
the lovely details of life.

74
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,875
Is something bothering
you Gennosuke-sama?

75
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,375
You're distracted.

76
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,250
Yes, something's bothering me! I
hate being treated like a baby!

77
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,208
I want to learn your
skill like I was promised!

78
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,875
All I do every day is walk.

79
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:03,375
Walk around Manjidani
with this stupid blindfold on!

80
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:06,500
I am curious.
Do you dislike walking?

81
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,458
I want to become stronger.

82
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,875
For the sake
of the Kouga people.

83
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,666
And this... This isn't
making me stronger at all.

84
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:19,208
When your enemy discovers
you use the art of your eyes,

85
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,750
his first move
will be to remove them.

86
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:24,416
This is one of the
basic rules of martial arts.

87
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,166
It is vital to
train this way in case

88
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,750
your sight is ever
taken away from you.

89
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,916
I don't care about that!

90
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,375
I want to be taught how
to use the art of my eyes!

91
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:49,583
Hyoma!

92
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:53,708
Let us continue your
training, Gennosuke-sama.

93
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,666
You must sharpen your remaining
senses. Once this is done,

94
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,625
even a mountain
path such as this will be

95
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:40,083
an easy one to cross.

96
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,333
I'm not an idiot!

97
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:46,250
You must be more careful.

98
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:50,000
We are in a dangerous
position on this mountainside.

99
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,791
Oh, is it dangerous?!

100
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:14,833
I only speak the truth when I
tell you it's dangerous up here.

101
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:18,750
One misstep and you
can die in an instant.

102
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:29,250
This world is one of
mysteries and complex ideas.

103
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:32,000
It is filled with a variety
of men, from the tranquil

104
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:36,416
to the crazed. And everything
is constantly changing.

105
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,000
However...

106
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,666
If you choose to look deeply
into the heart of this world,

107
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,583
you will find
truth in the chaos.

108
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:46,500
It is then that you will see
the reality with those eyes.

109
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,000
That's all?

110
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:51,083
That is all I know of the
way behind the art of my eyes.

111
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:54,791
The truth behind the lives that
all of us lead on this earth.

112
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:57,916
Well, what is
the truth behind it?

113
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,333
If I actually knew that I
would sleep better at night.

114
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,375
Thanks for nothing, Hyoma.

115
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,083
Gennosuke-sama!

116
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,375
Did the animal
hurt you anywhere?

117
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,666
Gennosuke-sama...

118
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:21,166
Danjo-sama was
correct in his judgments of

119
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,791
Gennosuke-sama's character.
He has great potential in his

120
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:28,375
mastery of the doujutsu,
the art of the eyes.

121
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:32,083
However, my heart cannot shield
the fear that grows there.

122
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,458
If there exists
justice in this world,

123
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,958
injustice must also exist.

124
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,958
There is beauty and
comfort in this world,

125
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:43,583
and so there must also be
the ugly and the frightening.

126
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:47,333
I fear that Gennosuke-sama's
eyes are too pure to be able to

127
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:51,375
deal with both sides,
the white and the black.

128
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:04,916
But then again, there may
be no need to cover those eyes.

129
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,250
They may be exactly
what this world needs.

130
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:13,000
Gennosuke-sama, how are
you feeling this morning?

131
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,833
Hyoma?

132
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,416
Gennosuke-sama...

133
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,958
Hyoma... You saved me.

134
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,083
We've arrived.

135
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:50,375
It is now time for
you to remove your blindfold.

136
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:57,416
No. I can see
just fine. I see, Hyoma.

137
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:01,500
This is the truth of the world.

138
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,375
Absolutely.

139
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:07,291
The sun is simply magnificent.

140
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:12,083
It's glorious and
it shines over all.

141
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:17,416
Not just the Kouga, but
over the Iga people as well.

142
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,083
And that, is
the truth of the world.

143
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:24,166
Thank you. For
showing me the truth.

144
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,833
You cannot die,
Gennosuke-sama.

145
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:43,375
You must live past this day.

146
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,458
Hyoma...

147
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:54,000
I know that I hit my enemy.
But I cannot hear him fall.

148
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:58,125
Did I miss him?
Is that possible?

149
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,000
Where are you, Kouga ninja?!

150
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:09,333
Where are you?!
Where are you?!

151
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,875
Grandmother's hawk.
Does that mean Tenzen

152
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,333
and Koshiro have returned?

153
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,083
I don't know.
But it seems to me

154
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,750
that the hawk has
retuned on its own accord.

155
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,833
Oh no. What if something
horrible has happened

156
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:28,875
to both of them?
I have a bad feeling inside.

157
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,541
Koshiro-dono...

158
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,958
Where have you disappeared?!

159
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:42,208
I can't afford to waste any more
time fighting with a dead man!

160
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:45,291
I exist only to
protect the princess.

161
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:48,375
I must hurry! I must
hurry to Oboro-sama!

162
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,500
Koshiro-dono...

163
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:51,916
What?! Who's there?!

164
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:56,375
Koshiro-dono...

165
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:57,875
Akeginu!

166
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:58,750
In the darkness, at the
foot of the ladder to the sky,

167
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:01,833
a man is cradled
by his unspoken love.

168
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:05,791
The path to death is without
mercy as he cries out her name.

169
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:08,583
As an eerie moon
shines over the living,

170
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:12,208
the female flesh of
destiny waits to steal forth.

171
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:14,583
And with her double-edged
sword will strike the hearts

172
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:17,458
of those who remain to
reveal the truth behind

173
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:19,708
the Kouga and the Iga.

174
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,750
On the next Basilisk,
"Consipiracy."
