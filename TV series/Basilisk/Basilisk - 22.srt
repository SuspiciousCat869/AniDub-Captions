1
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,791
Two tribes sworn to hate...

2
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:32,500
Their bloodstained bodies
left out in the open to rot.

3
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:37,250
Their souls longing for a
peace that they failed to find.

4
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,708
As they sought to break
the shackles of darkness

5
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:42,375
and heal the
wounds of the past,

6
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:47,458
Fate denied their quest
and thrust them into war.

7
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,416
The bridges of
hope some dared to build

8
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,958
between them were torn asunder.

9
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:08,041
Their dreams were ripped from
their hearts with a sword...

10
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:12,041
with their destiny
revealed at last.

11
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,625
Men are such fools.

12
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:53,416
That's it. Your shift
is over. It's my turn.

13
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,541
What happened?!

14
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,958
He's... He's dead!

15
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:13,416
Kill or be killed...
to the very end.

16
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,208
Finally...

17
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,625
The Kouga are victorious.

18
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:27,958
And now, Oboro,
is your time to die.

19
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,750
What is this?

20
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:36,750
A proclamation?

21
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:37,750
What does it say?

22
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,416
Now let's see.
This thing says...

23
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,791
"To where has
Kouga Gennosuke escaped?"

24
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:46,208
"We have the only
other remaining Kouga,

25
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:49,250
Kagero, in our custody.
For the time being she will

26
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,625
be interrogated to
the breaking point,

27
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:54,375
and in two days
she will be executed."

28
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:55,708
Executed?

29
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,250
"If you are truly the
leader of the Kouga as

30
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,708
so many have claimed
you to be, then you will

31
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:05,041
emerge from your cowardly hiding
place to save this poor woman.

32
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,500
Do you have the skills
of a warrior and leader

33
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,041
as you have professed?

34
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:13,000
If so, then bring the
scroll and come to us."

35
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:16,333
"We will gladly bind you like
a hog the way we did Kagero

36
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,916
and drag you both to Sunpu."

37
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:23,041
"Signed, Oboro of the Iga."

38
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,708
What is this about anyway?

39
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:28,708
I don't know, but
I saw this same sign

40
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:31,250
posted in Kanaya
yesterday afternoon.

41
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,625
Who cares?

42
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,958
Sounds like
someone's pretty angry.

43
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,875
He's forsaken you, Kagero.

44
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,625
Don't you think?

45
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:29,625
You actually caught
me by surprise.

46
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:30,916
I would have
never thought that

47
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,083
your sickly sweet
breath was poison.

48
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,375
Oboro-dono!

49
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,416
Tenzen!

50
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,125
I cannot speak for Oboro,
but I am almost impressed at

51
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:29,041
how urgent and nasty
this war has become.

52
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,750
Were that not the case,
I would have gladly spent

53
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,583
a few more days sucking
at your venomous breath

54
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:37,250
and dying in your arms.

55
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:43,541
Why don't you finish
this? Just kill me.

56
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:48,041
Of course, that is the idea.
But why rush the fun part?

57
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:52,083
Give me a few more
hours of of enjoyment,

58
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:56,291
and then tomorrow morning, I
promise to grant you your wish.

59
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:04,000
Stop! Tenzen
you must stop this!

60
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:43,833
Tenzen...

61
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,750
Even blind, you managed to
climb all this way on your own.

62
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:50,708
A feat that proves your
worthiness of being a leader.

63
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:55,166
Tenzen you have to stop.
It has gone too far.

64
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:59,541
I can't take it. This
torture cannot continue.

65
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,500
Oboro-sama.

66
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:05,708
I must express my
renewed admiration for you.

67
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,041
After all, using
this Kouga woman to

68
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,500
lure Gennosuke from
the shadows was your idea.

69
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:16,583
I could not have forged
a better plan myself.

70
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:19,833
Lady Ofuku is just as
impressed with you as I am.

71
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,583
She says you are
a true ninja leader.

72
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:25,583
She is, however, surprised
that such an innocent face

73
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:28,208
could devise
such a devious plan.

74
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:35,083
Tenzen, regardless
of who she is,

75
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:38,291
allowing her a quick
death would be merciful.

76
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:39,750
Merciful?

77
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,083
We are trapped
in a living hell.

78
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:45,041
This woman may be our
enemy, but she's human.

79
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,750
You must show her compassion!

80
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:52,875
Compassion? And mercy?
I find it odd...

81
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:55,333
I hear those words dripping
from the mouths of warriors

82
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,041
so much these days.

83
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,875
But as for me, I have
no concept of such

84
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:04,958
useless things as these. I only
know what I've always known.

85
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,750
No... Tenzen...

86
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:37,125
What is this?!
What are you doing?!

87
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:39,791
Just altering the plan a bit.

88
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,500
Kagero is special.

89
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,583
She possesses the
ability of a toxic breath

90
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:51,750
during times of sexual arousal.

91
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:56,083
We'll let her watch as we
consummate our relationship.

92
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:59,250
Then, when she is aroused
and her breath turns lethal.

93
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:03,041
You will use your mystic eye
and strip her of her power.

94
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:06,208
Tenzen... Let me go, please!

95
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,875
When you're done, I will be
able to take Kagero in any way

96
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:14,291
I please and I won't have
to worry about dying again.

97
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:15,500
No!

98
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:22,083
I will never do
such a thing! My eyes--

99
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,833
Oboro-sama... Do you
know how many days it has been

100
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,916
since we left our village?

101
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:32,041
The Iga are the
victors in this war.

102
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:36,083
And tomorrow, you will walk
with me into Sunpu as my wife.

103
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,416
The way it was destined to be.

104
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,583
No! No!

105
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:44,250
Tenzen, stop! Please! No!

106
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,291
Yakushiji Tenzen.

107
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,833
He's here...

108
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,833
You're alive...
Why did this happen?

109
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,666
Why am I alive? You should
know the answer to that.

110
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,416
It's simple.

111
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:46,583
I am alive so I can
send you to hell myself!

112
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,208
Gennosuke-sama!

113
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:59,250
Oboro-sama, I am
quite proud of you.

114
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:02,416
This sad, blind
Kouga fell feet first

115
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,625
right into the
trap you set for him.

116
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:13,166
You have brought an end
to this war for our people.

117
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,583
This moment will be considered

118
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:17,541
a great turning
point in Iga history.

119
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:26,208
But... You must leave
this final kill to me.

120
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:52,416
It is my understanding that you
were trained by Muroga Hyoma.

121
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:55,791
However...

122
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:58,458
Without your Dojutso,
you would lose even a battle

123
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,041
with a falling
tree in the forest.

124
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,708
No, Gennosuke-sama...

125
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,875
You're not holding together
very well, Gennosuke.

126
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:39,833
If I were you, I would
try begging for my life.

127
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:42,583
Depending on how pathetic
you are, I might consider

128
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:45,708
dragging you only
half-dead to Sunpu. Once our

129
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:48,750
audience with Retired
Shogun Ieyasu is complete,

130
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:51,791
if you are still breathing, I
would even consider allowing you

131
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:55,458
to tag along with Oboro-sama
and me as our servant.

132
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:59,125
You can never have too many.

133
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,250
Oboro-sama...

134
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:08,166
Just a while ago
you said you felt as if

135
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,041
you were inside
of a living Hell.

136
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:16,166
If such a thing
as Hell truly exists,

137
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,500
my knowledge of
it surpasses yours.

138
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:25,666
Hell is enduring the pain
of death, only to be reborn.

139
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:29,666
This limbo I suffer has the
persistence of the rising sun.

140
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:34,125
Never a sign of salvation or
deliverence into the next world.

141
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,500
To me, that is Hell!

142
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:27,833
You Kouga bastard!

143
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,500
Gennosuke-sama?

144
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:02,333
This fight is over.
You should see that.

145
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,000
No, Tenzen.

146
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,916
The time for last
requests has passed.

147
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,041
Tell me. Why are you
filled with such loathing?

148
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:23,458
There was a time when
the Iga were focused.

149
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:26,916
They did nt question
their hated toward the Kouga.

150
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,041
However, over time

151
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:32,708
these feelings began
to fade like a bad dream.

152
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,791
The reason being, fewer
and fewer of our people had

153
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:39,083
personal experiences
of this hatred.

154
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:43,750
Then it was you. Was it not?

155
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:49,791
You were the one so long
ago who betrayed the Kouga.

156
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,833
It was near the
end of the Tensho wars,

157
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,416
and you had
formulated a plan.

158
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:03,041
It was the perfect opportunity
and I had to take advantage.

159
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:07,250
The Iga people were on
the edge of annihilation.

160
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,833
If the attack from
the Oda had never happened,

161
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:12,041
Tsubagakure would
have been shackled by the

162
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:16,458
relationship of
Kouga Danjo and Ogen-sama.

163
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:19,500
Then Hattori Hanzo
the first had to step in.

164
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:23,791
I must say that I
didn't see this move coming.

165
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,416
I had not one
notion he would

166
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,083
draw up the No-Hostilities
Pact between us.

167
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,875
It was a
simple miscalculation.

168
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:44,791
Ogen-sama... and Danjo-sama...

169
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:50,916
Tenzen... You
manipulated our families.

170
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,416
I would not say
that I "manipulated" them.

171
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,041
No. I simply made sure
that they would continue to

172
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:01,375
hate each other for
as long as they lived.

173
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,375
Gennosuke-sama...

174
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:15,083
The Iga and Kouga will
put an end to this rivalry.

175
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,250
Here and now!

176
00:23:57,041 --> 00:24:00,625
In war, first blood
must always be drawn before

177
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:04,833
the final drop falls.
The time between is a world of

178
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:08,666
tears glimmering with
the hope for life itself.

179
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:13,000
Forbidden love binds both sides
lost in the madness of hate.

180
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:16,125
Yet this distant spark of light
in the darkness may well be

181
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:19,041
the ember of
hope still glowing.

182
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:22,750
On the next Basilisk,
"Emancipation."
