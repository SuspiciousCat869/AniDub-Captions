1
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:28,500
Two tribes sworn to hate...

2
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:32,250
Their bloodstained bodies
left out in the open to rot.

3
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:36,583
Their souls longing for a
peace that they failed to find.

4
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:39,166
As they sought to break
the shackles of darkness

5
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,750
and heal the
wounds of the past,

6
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:46,833
Fate denied their quest
and thrust them into war.

7
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,458
The bridges of
hope some dared to

8
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:02,000
build between
them were torn asunder.

9
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:07,333
Their dreams were ripped from
their hearts with a sword...

10
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:11,333
with their destiny
revealed at last.

11
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:09,666
Was that a hoot or what?!

12
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,791
Believe it or not I'm
always this funny! Yep!

13
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:16,875
Just think about all the fun the
two of us could have together.

14
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:18,833
I know I'm a little
on the chubby side

15
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:20,750
but I've always dreamt
my future wife to be

16
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,500
a beautiful and slender
woman like yourself!

17
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:26,333
So whatd'ya say,
should we follow Oboro-sama

18
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:29,791
and Gennosuke-sama's
bold lead and tie the knot?

19
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:32,750
Stop, Udono, that's
enough. You're being crude...

20
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:36,041
Can't you see that you're making
Akeginu-dono uncomfortable?

21
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,416
Sorry about that!

22
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,791
I guess I've had a
little too much to drink.

23
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,916
Eee-hee, hee, hee, hee!

24
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:50,708
Mmm! This is delicious.
Pickled perfectly.

25
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:53,583
Why is the flavor so
different from what I'm used to?

26
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,833
Well, you may prepare it the
same, but the salt's different.

27
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:58,791
The Iga don't
harvest it on our own.

28
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,958
Our salt is imported from Ako.

29
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:02,958
Please! Try it!

30
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,958
Take some back to
Manjidani with you!

31
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:08,375
We have mountains of it stored
out in our old salt-locker.

32
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:12,333
Ooh, hoo, hoo! That's right!
Stay prepared! I always say!

33
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,583
Salt is a valuable
commodity in times of war!

34
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:22,666
Udono... Didn't I tell
you to watch your tongue?

35
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:28,541
It's not his fault.

36
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,625
It will take time
for peace to take root.

37
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,916
My people aren't willing
to trust yet either...

38
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,666
Like the two of you...
When I told them about the salt.

39
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,916
But, uh... well,
yes... that is true.

40
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's just our instinct...
Please forgive us.

41
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:44,958
Oboro-dono.

42
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,666
We must demonstrate unity.

43
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,916
Let us show your people the
results of all our practice.

44
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,416
Wait a second. I
thought we were saving our

45
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,916
performance for
the wedding ceremony.

46
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,541
On that day we can add
something new I promise.

47
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:08,041
This dance is a
celebration of harmony between

48
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:11,875
the Kouga and the Iga. I hope
that it is to your liking.

49
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,208
We've practiced many hours.

50
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,916
You've got to be kidding me?!

51
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,833
That's what you were doing
all those times you two met?

52
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,333
Practicing a dance?!

53
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,833
Is that so shocking
to you? Come now...

54
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,583
Why else do you think
Oboro-sama and I would be

55
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,166
meeting up all those nights?

56
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:30,791
Um... uh... You don't
know? I can't say it out loud!

57
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,583
Can I, Akeginu-dono?!

58
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,291
Why are you asking me?

59
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,750
Akeginu-dono...

60
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,541
He'll get what
he asks for soon.

61
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:50,791
I apologize for Udono's
behavior. He has neither manners

62
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:53,666
nor etiquette. But he
does have a good heart,

63
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,583
and I trust him with my life.

64
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,416
Don't apologize...

65
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,625
He was a little crude but
he was very entertaining...

66
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:03,416
It's funny... I
always thought the Kouga

67
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,041
were mean and ruthless...

68
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:08,125
But Udono is like a big lovable
bear and it's obvious that

69
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,625
he has a great
deal of respect for you.

70
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,916
It's kind of you to
see past his faults.

71
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,541
And I understand
what you mean.

72
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,625
My people have always believed
that the Iga are nothing

73
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,625
but heartless savages.
But you're really

74
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,541
no different than us.

75
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,666
I think my people
see that now too!

76
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,166
Some perhaps ... But
what of your loyal kinsmen

77
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,666
we met along Toki Pass?

78
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,708
I'm not sure.

79
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:34,125
They should have
been here hours ago.

80
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,375
They've used their absence to

81
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:38,625
cloak their animosity
toward our union.

82
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:42,708
Is that so?
Have I been so blind?

83
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:44,875
Some hearts are
not ready for this.

84
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:48,625
It can't be helped. I'm sure
they're not the only ones.

85
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:51,833
No. There were others
who refused to join us.

86
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:54,416
Try not to be
discouraged... Please.

87
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,208
We'll take our time.

88
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:59,500
We can't let their
disapproval weaken our resolve.

89
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:02,458
Right.

90
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,791
All eyes are
upon us, Oboro-dono.

91
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:08,250
If we remain confident,
they'll eventually come around.

92
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,416
I'll harness your strength.

93
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:19,750
We, the Kouga Manjidani
and you, the Iga Tsubagakure,

94
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:23,666
are one in the same.
Masters of fierce Ninja arts.

95
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,208
We were reared from
birth as sworn enemies,

96
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:29,041
caused by dissension years ago.

97
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:34,416
It's foolish how over time
reason was lost to hatred.

98
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,541
Yes.

99
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:36,791
It can't last...

100
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,333
You and I must change
it together Oboro-dono.

101
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:43,125
We must become the bridge
that unites Kouga and Iga.

102
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:46,125
Our love for one another will
break the chains of the past

103
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:49,250
and establish harmony
between our people.

104
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:52,166
Yes. I hope you're right.

105
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:02,416
Josuke is locked
in the guest room.

106
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,208
Mmm... We must
move cautiously...

107
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,458
Don't tell the others
about the scroll.

108
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:10,916
If Oboro-sama suspects
anything, there'll be trouble.

109
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,958
Right. I won't speak a word.

110
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,166
You always have been
able to keep a secret.

111
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,375
Now what do you say we come
up with a plan of our own?

112
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,625
What do you mean?

113
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:22,291
I mean they must have
killed Kazamachi by now.

114
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,333
It's time to
take the next step.

115
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:27,375
But Tenzen-sama said not to
do anything until they get back!

116
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:30,041
They can't have all the fun...

117
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:36,041
All right... I'll take
care of that filthy pig Udono.

118
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,625
It's reinforced with iron.

119
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:54,000
Heh! Do they
really think they can

120
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:57,708
hold me in this old
shack? Not a chance!

121
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,041
So this how they treat
their honored guests?

122
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:09,125
I wonder why Akeginu
would want to lock me up?

123
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,500
Maybe she had
something else in mind!

124
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:21,125
You should've seen the look
on your face when I said that!

125
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:24,208
I thought you were serious!
What did you expect?

126
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,500
Now take back what you said!

127
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,833
I can do whatever I
want! This is my village!

128
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:31,291
You have to obey
my command here!

129
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:34,416
You must do as I say
or I'll call the guards!

130
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,875
Well. Since I have no say,
tell me what you want.

131
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:39,125
Whatever you want.

132
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,750
What do you mean?
You must be tired.

133
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,666
I mean I'm turning Tsubagakure
Village over to you for

134
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,250
this one night!
Whatever you desire is yours!

135
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,083
But I'm perfectly content.

136
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:53,791
Is there anything we
Iga may offer you as a gift?

137
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:56,583
Being here with
you is all that I want.

138
00:10:56,666 --> 00:11:00,208
Let me grant what you
wish, nothing left unturned.

139
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:04,291
Oboro-dono! I wish I
could see your lovely face.

140
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,500
That's it...
That's all you want ...

141
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:11,458
I gave Tsubgakure to
you tonight, remember?

142
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,000
I'll do anything.

143
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:15,625
Very well then...
my order is...

144
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,625
What would you have me do?

145
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,666
Be your true self...

146
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,583
Always cherish the
love we have together.

147
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,041
How dense is he?

148
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,208
Opportunity is
knocking on his door,

149
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,125
is he out of his mind or what?

150
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:32,291
Huh?

151
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,750
Udono-sama it's me, Akeginu.
Please forgive my candor,

152
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:41,375
but I couldn't resist my
urges of seeing you tonight...

153
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,958
I know I was rude
but that's because my people

154
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:47,541
would not understand. If they
knew I had feelings for you,

155
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:50,958
they would've torn you to
shreds without thinking twice.

156
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,750
He's gone!

157
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,541
Where did he go?

158
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:58,958
Put me down!

159
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,583
Josuke-dono... You beast!

160
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:06,041
Well I guess you just couldn't
keep yourself away from me huh?!

161
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,083
How did you get out?
You were locked in!

162
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:11,125
Don't you know!
I used the power of love!

163
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,416
Disgusting pig!

164
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,541
Come on! Be my
wife Akeginu-dono!

165
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:19,541
My! What do we have
here?! So soft and plump!

166
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:22,583
I can't help myself.
Let's do it right now!

167
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:37,750
Ooooooooh! You look delicious.

168
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,791
Let's have a challenge
of the Ninja Arts!

169
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:46,416
Whatd'ya say? You win, you
can do what you want with me...

170
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,166
I'll be your slave!

171
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,208
You sure you can handle me?!

172
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:53,791
Be careful, my queen!
I won't hold back!

173
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:57,291
Nor will I, Udono! Nor will I!

174
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,416
Is that blood?

175
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:30,416
Good night Gennosuke-sama.
I'll see you in the morning.

176
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:26,125
Wh-What did you do to me?!

177
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:29,083
Things are getting a little
hazy, aren't they, Udono?

178
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,833
You're in my world now.

179
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:36,041
How did you do
that?! Where'd you go?!

180
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,375
Damn!

181
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,041
Where is she?!

182
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:53,750
Well it Looks like we
can mark Udono off the list!

183
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,791
You almost killed me,
Akeginu-dono...

184
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,166
That wasn't very nice...

185
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,958
What would you
have done if I had died?

186
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:13,625
I won't make the same mistake
twice, you fat bastard!

187
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:24,833
Hmm?

188
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,625
Unless you have
another trick up your sleeve,

189
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:41,666
I'd say this
challenge is over!

190
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,750
Now keep your
promise, my little slave!

191
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,166
Who's there?!

192
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,875
Oboro-sama!

193
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,375
Uh-oh! We're in trouble!

194
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:54,708
Akeginu? Udono-sama?
What's going on here?

195
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:57,250
U-um... Nothing really.

196
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:00,666
Oh, come now! It's pretty
obvious that we were fighting!

197
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,125
Don't try to protect
me, Akeginu! It's not

198
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:06,500
her fault, Oboro. I made
another ungentlemanly advance

199
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:09,416
and she finally got
fed up and let me have it.

200
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,083
Right. I see.

201
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:14,125
Uhh. Please don't tell
Gennosuke-sama about this!

202
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:17,416
No, I guess I'll
let it go... Just once...

203
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,750
But promise it
won't happen again.

204
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,750
I give you my
solemn word as a Kouga.

205
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,166
Hmm!

206
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:40,750
Good evening. It's a
lovely night, don't you think?

207
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,166
It's obvious what
your intentions are.

208
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,166
I could see
that at the banquet.

209
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,250
Hatred controls your soul.

210
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,375
It's like a terrible thirst.

211
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,958
The only way to
quench it is to kill.

212
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,416
But it can never be satisfied.

213
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,291
Even if all the Kouga
were destroyed you would find

214
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:02,500
someone else who was different
from you-- someone else to hate.

215
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,333
But you even you can change.

216
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,416
It doesn't have
to be like this.

217
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,166
Why don't you
let go of old grudges

218
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,750
and help us start a
new future together?

219
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,791
Oboro-dono and I
could use your help.

220
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:17,125
Won't you trust in
us and lend us a hand?

221
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,750
Akeginu...
Udono-sama can be vulgar

222
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,333
and I'm sure he
crossed the line...

223
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:27,041
But you went too
far using your arts.

224
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:30,583
Oboro-sama, please. Forgive me.

225
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:37,791
What's this? A trail? It
leads to the salt locker...

226
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,125
Wait! Oboro-sama!

227
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,666
Are you alright?!

228
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,416
Of course I am.
What's the matter?

229
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:58,375
Forgive me, Gennosuke-sama!
I'm so sorry!

230
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,750
You have nothing
to be sorry for.

231
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:10,625
Please forget that I
disturbed you. Goodnight.

232
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,500
Alright, Jingoro! I know
you're here somewhere!

233
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,458
Show yourself!

234
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:23,000
Jingoro! Get
down here right now!

235
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:38,541
Oboro-sama!
Please don't look at me!

236
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:46,541
Water! Please! Water!

237
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:50,541
I want the truth...
Jingoro... Did you attempt to

238
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:55,041
assassinate
Gennosuke-sama? Did you?

239
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,833
Water! Water!

240
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:02,333
Answer me! Yes or No?!

241
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,583
Oboro-sama! You can't just
leave him like this! He'll die!

242
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:14,875
After what he did,
he deserves to suffer!

243
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:18,000
Leave him be! Don't help him!

244
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:27,375
Water! I beg of you!
Please! Help me!

245
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:42,333
I guess Akeginu didn't want me.

246
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:50,625
She was really
trying to kill me.

247
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:51,833
What is that?

248
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:57,333
Water! I need water!

249
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:04,541
Well, if it isn't Jingoro.
Taking an evening stroll I see.

250
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:13,291
Water! I need water!

251
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,708
I see you've paid a
visit to Gennosuke-sama!

252
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:18,791
Did you really think you
could kill him in that form?!

253
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:23,750
Help me! Help me!
I need water please!

254
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,208
All right.
I'll give you water...

255
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:34,375
But first tell me why you
tried to kill Gennosuke-sama...

256
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:37,250
Why would you do that
when there's about to be peace?

257
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:41,500
I'll tell you! Please!
Just give me some water first!

258
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,541
I need water or
I'm going to die!

259
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:46,250
No deal, Jingoro...
Answer me first...

260
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:49,250
Then you can have
all the water you want.

261
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:52,125
Can't talk, huh?
Should we go back to shore?

262
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,375
No! There is no peace!

263
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:57,083
The No-Hostilities Pact
has been dissolved!

264
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,916
That's why I tried
to kill Gennosuke!

265
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,625
Really ... The Hattori
relinquished the pact!

266
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,833
But why now?!

267
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:11,750
The former Shogun! Kouga! Iga!

268
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,833
The Kouga and Iga what?!

269
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,833
What about the
Kouga and the Iga?!

270
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:20,625
We're at war and you're dead!

271
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:24,208
Damn! He got away!

272
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:11,333
I've slain one of
the Kouga Manjidani Ten!

273
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:15,416
Udono Josuke!
Hell welcomes you!

274
00:23:56,958 --> 00:24:00,958
A creeping morning mist
suffocates the Kouga village.

275
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:03,208
As an impetuous threat
approaches from the north,

276
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:05,875
led by violent
malevolence, the thoughts of

277
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:09,000
an ancient tree
calm the disheartened.

278
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:12,750
Devious tactics are
the way of the Ninja.

279
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:17,541
And in hopes of survival,
siege warfare is unavoidable.

280
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:22,625
On the next Basilisk,
"The Surprise Attack."
