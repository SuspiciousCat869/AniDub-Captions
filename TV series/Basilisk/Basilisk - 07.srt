1
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:28,583
Two tribes sworn to hate...

2
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:32,291
Their bloodstained bodies
left out in the open to rot.

3
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:37,083
Their souls longing for a
peace that they failed to find.

4
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:39,500
As they sought to break
the shackles of darkness

5
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:42,208
and heal the
wounds of the past,

6
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:47,291
Fate denied their quest
and thrust them into war.

7
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:59,250
The bridges of
hope some dared to build

8
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:02,791
between them were torn asunder.

9
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:07,750
Their dreams were ripped from
their hearts with a sword...

10
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:11,750
with their destiny
revealed at last.

11
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,000
Oboro-sama.

12
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,583
Koshiro. What is it?

13
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:34,083
Tenzen-sama. He
wishes to speak with you.

14
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,791
I see.

15
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:40,833
Gennosuke-sama. I
must meet with my cousin.

16
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,166
Your carvings are well adorned.

17
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,375
What?!

18
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:08,125
Impressive craftsmanship.

19
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,208
I wanted to know
who among the Iga could

20
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:14,458
carve such charming owls.
So I asked Oboro-sama.

21
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,833
It's something that I
hope you may someday teach

22
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,750
to the children of Kouga.

23
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:25,291
Your name is Koshiro-sama, yes?

24
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:30,291
Oboro-sama and you grew up
together, if I'm not mistaken.

25
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,875
I have my share of siblings.

26
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,750
It's frustrating to
care for them sometimes.

27
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,166
I don't have time for this.

28
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:01,083
You filthy Kouga.

29
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,708
You will answer all of
my questions truthfully.

30
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,083
If you are dishonest,

31
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:11,125
you will not leave this
place alive or in one piece.

32
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,625
Now out of the Kouga Ten...

33
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:26,125
First, there's
this Muroga Hyoma.

34
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,791
I have heard
much about that one.

35
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,833
It is said that
he's a blind ninja.

36
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:34,958
What I want to know is,
what are his specialties?

37
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,708
There is the woman, Kagero.

38
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:39,125
What techniques
does she employ?

39
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:42,458
And let's not
forget Kisaragi Saemon.

40
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:52,083
Ah, nature is calling
is she? I will be happy to

41
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:56,125
provide assistance, as
soon as you provide answers.

42
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:59,208
Do you actually think
I'd tell you anything?

43
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:03,375
If you don't tell me,
you know what happens.

44
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,375
Tell me something
first, old man...

45
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:06,541
What is it?

46
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,666
The more I look at
you, the more I wonder.

47
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,750
What the Hell's crammed
into that head of yours

48
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,833
to make it look like that?

49
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:17,875
Why don't you tell me that while
I think up answers for you?

50
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:31,333
You should know this.
My head is packed tight.

51
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,083
Filled with
loathing for the Kouga,

52
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,708
it swells with
each breath you take.

53
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:39,291
For me, the memories echo
as if sent from yesterday.

54
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,291
You treacherous
Kouga took advantage of

55
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:44,791
the Oda's surprise attack
and you massacred the Iga with

56
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,875
no regard for what
the future would hold.

57
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,000
That's a filthy lie!

58
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,708
I think the liar here is Danjo.

59
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:02,125
He's kept so
much hidden from you.

60
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:05,250
He would never
lie to us! The Kouga...

61
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,875
We're more honorable than that!

62
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,250
We treat our
enemies with respect!

63
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:12,000
You don't know what
you're talking about!

64
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,125
I can't criticize you for
your loyalty. It's natural.

65
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:19,041
Quite honestly had the Iga
been in the place of the Kouga,

66
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,125
we would have
done the same as you.

67
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:26,166
Then how in the Hell can
you Iga call us underhanded?

68
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:40,875
Now then. It's
time for you to answer.

69
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:45,208
I don't think I need to ask
you about your skills, do I?

70
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:49,916
Cutting off your
ears will be first.

71
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,416
Then I wslice off your
right arm. Then your left arm.

72
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,625
Then on to those
voluptuous breasts.

73
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:03,791
Somehow, I doubt you're up
to such an unending torture.

74
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,583
Now...

75
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,666
It's time for you to speak.

76
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:21,083
My hand it's...
it's... stuck!

77
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,333
Let go of me you...

78
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:50,208
You really should
have asked my specialty.

79
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,708
You... bitch!

80
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:16,875
I hope your journey
to Hell is a swift one.

81
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,583
The Igas are up to something.

82
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:44,625
I must see if
Gennosuke-sama is safe.

83
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:48,625
Then back to Kouga. If
I can make it there alive.

84
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:56,916
Gennosuke has told me
many things about this place.

85
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
He was right about this
much. The layout is amazing.

86
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:08,875
They've been attacked
by the Oda in the past.

87
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,708
They've ensured they're very
well-protected at this point.

88
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,250
We must take care.

89
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:18,208
It's likely they have
scouts all over the area.

90
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:25,208
I'm going in through the
front. We should meet inside.

91
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,125
Unless you have an objection.

92
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,041
See you inside.

93
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:30,875
Saemon!

94
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,666
Remember that
Gennosuke-sama's safety

95
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,416
is at the center
of our concern.

96
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:44,583
You think for one
second that I've forgotten?

97
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,166
I am counting on you, Okoi.

98
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,791
I know.

99
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,791
Go on! Get out of here!

100
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:48,041
That girl is hopeless.

101
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:57,791
Goodbye, my brother.
I won't fail.

102
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:33,333
Yashamaru-dono...

103
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:15,541
Rousai. Are you in here?

104
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,541
Tell me something, wench...

105
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:42,375
Has my friend Rousai
been through here tonight?

106
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:46,500
You know, the old man
with the long white beard.

107
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,166
Kill me.

108
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,375
Well it looks like
you've already gone ahead

109
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:58,166
and told him
everything that you know.

110
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,125
No Kouga woman who
has been humiliated by

111
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:04,041
an Iga can
allow herself to live.

112
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,375
What?

113
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,500
That old dog.

114
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,083
I didn't think he
could get it up anymore.

115
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:14,833
But what do you know.
He's still got some life left.

116
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,500
I'm surprised.

117
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,791
And he was nice
enough to leave you behind

118
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,791
so I could take a turn myself.

119
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:36,958
Is it really you, my love?

120
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:40,000
Well. No use in hiding.

121
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,375
This is the same woman.

122
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:03,041
She was part of the Iga who
attacked Manjidani this morning.

123
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,083
What does she see?

124
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,625
What?!

125
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:47,875
It really is you. I knew it.

126
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:56,625
I knew you'd be alive.
I never gave up hope.

127
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:01,458
So these two were in love.

128
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:07,708
You came back
to me. You're alive.

129
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:11,916
Of course, I am. But just
who do you believe me to be?

130
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,541
If she's testing me,
there's only one other

131
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:32,083
course of action
I can to take.

132
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,083
Uh... Thank you.

133
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:58,833
Did I raise my
suspicions too early?

134
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:05,000
It... It must be the
shock. Or the snakebite.

135
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,583
But I just
wasn't completely sure

136
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:09,041
that you even recognized me.

137
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:15,750
I'm so sorry. It was just
because when you left for Sunpu,

138
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,125
you hair was so
different than it is now.

139
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:21,375
I was just confused, my love.

140
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,166
Really?

141
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,250
I tried to make sure
everything was the same.

142
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,083
It's Kouga Danjo.

143
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:33,583
And that beast Kazamachi Shogen
who are behind all of this.

144
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:36,125
The signs do point to that.

145
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:39,291
I do have some
good news though.

146
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:43,875
There is word circling
that Danjo is dead.

147
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,458
What?!

148
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:49,291
And as for Shogen, I
think you'll be proud of me.

149
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:53,125
I killed him myself.
No mercy spared.

150
00:18:56,875 --> 00:19:01,500
I killed him...
for you, my love.

151
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:08,333
I see. You've
done... very well.

152
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:19,750
Now I see Jyubei's prophecy.
It seems his sight is pure.

153
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,666
You have to
tell me the truth.

154
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,833
Don't you prefer
me so much more than

155
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:40,291
that wrinkled old
bag of wind. Don't you?

156
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,500
No!

157
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,250
Are you still turned on?

158
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:16,250
Get off me!
You spell-binding leech!

159
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:21,125
You're right. You do have
more to offer than that old man.

160
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:26,666
I'm going to suck every ounce
of your blood right out of you.

161
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:17,416
I'm sorry to
have kept you waiting.

162
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:26,666
Tenzen. Is there something
you need to tell me?

163
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:28,791
Tenzen?

164
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,833
I've given this
matter much thought.

165
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,458
And I'll be as forward
with you as I can.

166
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:38,166
I hope you can
forgive my bluntness.

167
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:43,583
Oboro-sama. You must
listen very carefully.

168
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:46,333
The retired
Shogun Ieyasu has ordered

169
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:51,125
that the pact be dissolved.
It has come to an end and so

170
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:55,333
the hostilities between
Iga and Kouga will rise again.

171
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:59,000
We are at war.

172
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:59,833
A hapless beast coaxed
into rapturous encounter,

173
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:02,375
as a stranger goes unnoticed.

174
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:05,458
One mind ignores
what another fears.

175
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:09,708
Innocent eyes torment
the dark horse of deceit.

176
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:12,375
The pangs of Hell prick.

177
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:14,458
As death yearns to cut through,

178
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:18,041
a final flicker moves through
the fading light of life.

179
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:22,583
On the next Basilisk,
"Cage of Blood."
