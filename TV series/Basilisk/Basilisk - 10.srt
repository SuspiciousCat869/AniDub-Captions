1
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:28,541
Two tribes sworn to hate...

2
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:32,208
Their bloodstained bodies
left out in the open to rot.

3
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:37,041
Their souls longing for a
peace that they failed to find.

4
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,375
As they sought to break
the shackles of darkness

5
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:42,125
and heal the
wounds of the past,

6
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:47,208
Fate denied their quest
and thrust them into war.

7
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:59,041
The bridges of
hope some dared to build

8
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:02,583
between them were torn asunder.

9
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:07,708
Their dreams were ripped from
their hearts with a sword...

10
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:11,708
with their destiny
revealed at last.

11
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:08,875
So the Iga are leading?
Nine to six?

12
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:10,875
Yes.

13
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,208
I'm surprised to hear that

14
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:15,041
the Kouga have lost
four of their finest.

15
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:20,708
Yes. Both clans have suffered.

16
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,208
Their leaders have fallen.

17
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:26,833
Danjo of the Kouga
and Ogen of the Iga.

18
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:30,208
Both dead. They killed each
other outside these walls,

19
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:32,666
on the banks of
the Abekawa river.

20
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,250
After they left here.
It was then...

21
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,833
Do you have word of what
happened to their bodies?

22
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:40,708
Are they at rest?

23
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:45,000
After they killed
each other, I saw them.

24
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,958
They were gone. And I
left them as they lay.

25
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:02,250
Very well. It's intriguing.

26
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:06,250
This matter may be settled much
sooner than we had anticipated.

27
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,750
The pact has only
been lifted two days

28
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,541
and look at the bloodshed.

29
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:15,583
The odds seem to weigh heavily
in the favor of Takechiyo.

30
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,625
Mataemon-dono...

31
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:22,375
You forget. This is no ordinary
feud we're witness to. Is it?

32
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:25,166
We do not yet know the outcome.

33
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,541
Right.

34
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:33,416
One can easily judge a ninja...
But they are like sorcerers.

35
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:49,250
Don't you worry.

36
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:55,458
Just relax. This'll
only hurt for a second.

37
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,333
Adding insult to injury.

38
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,166
Your head is mine!

39
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:17,000
Not if I rip your
intestines out first!

40
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,750
Simply thinking about that
chills me to the bone.

41
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,541
Such intensity.
Ordinary swordplay is

42
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,041
a child's game to those two.

43
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,666
But still... They were not the

44
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,666
only fighters
to face each other.

45
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,416
Tell me who were
the next of the clan's

46
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,250
to meet each other in battle.

47
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:13,583
Yes. One was of a girth
too massive to seem a ninja...

48
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:16,625
the other so old it would
appear the wind could kill him.

49
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,208
Go on.

50
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,958
Neither man knew of the
dissolution concerning the

51
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:25,583
No-Hostilities Pact or of
the deaths of Ogen and Danjo.

52
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,083
They fought for sport.

53
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,291
Come on old man, let me
show you what Kouga means!

54
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,625
I'm going to teach
you rotten Kouga all about

55
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,500
the humiliation of defeat!

56
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:46,166
And we'll see
about that damn wedding!

57
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,750
Peace with the
Kouga makes me sick!

58
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,833
That's cheap.
Damn Balloon Technique.

59
00:06:55,916 --> 00:07:00,250
Get down here you
spineless abomination!

60
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:03,083
You think I'm afraid of you?

61
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:15,916
You're mine!

62
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,416
You really had me
going there old man,

63
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,166
it looks like you still got it.

64
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,958
And you have amazingly,
quick movements...

65
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:31,166
for a bloated rhino.

66
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:45,500
Strange... An old man with
elastic arms and legs...

67
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,666
Which of the two
was left standing?

68
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,666
As they battled in the
mountains at the border of

69
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,333
the Iga and Kouga lands,
their paths crossed with

70
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:57,000
that of Gennosuke, grandson
of Danjo. He stopped them.

71
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:59,916
The two men of course claimed
their spar was only for sport,

72
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,166
but we all know
there was more to it.

73
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,291
The perfect opportunity.

74
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:09,083
This fight for the successorship
is blossoming the hatred that

75
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:12,500
has smoldered beneath
the surface for generations.

76
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,916
This is a war. A war for
nothing other than vengeance.

77
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,708
Now! Quick!
Throw Koshiro's sickle!

78
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,291
No?!

79
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,333
Jyubei!

80
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,166
Damn he's fast!

81
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:08,125
You seem to be in a dilemma.
You need to get by me,

82
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:11,708
but you can't do it
without dropping the scroll.

83
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,416
How else will you be
able to use the dagger that's

84
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,250
hidden in your throat?
That's it, right?

85
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,250
That's your secret.

86
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:32,000
One copy should be enough.

87
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:35,250
We have no need for two scrolls.

88
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:45,625
So Tenzen actually
burned the Kouga scroll?

89
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,000
If the only Kouga who knew of

90
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,083
the scroll have been
slaughtered...

91
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,833
then the rest
of them are ignorant,

92
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:53,791
completely unaware
that this battle has begun.

93
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,375
True.

94
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:58,875
So, the Kouga know nothing
of the pact dissolution.

95
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,833
And their demise has
become as clear as crystal.

96
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:06,625
Their loss of ground cannot
be overcome. It's unfortunate.

97
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,458
I don't understand
your dissatisfaction,

98
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,416
Mataemon-dono...

99
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,583
Deception and strategy are
brothers in the world of war.

100
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,916
You may be mistaking
these people for samurai.

101
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,250
Which they are not.
Nobility is not a factor here.

102
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:34,916
Damn!

103
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,000
Where is she?!

104
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:47,708
Well! Looks like we can
mark Udono off the list!

105
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:54,791
You almost killed me,
Akeginu-dono.

106
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:57,166
That wasn't very nice.

107
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,833
What would you have
done if I had died?

108
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,625
All right. I'll give
you water.

109
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:07,833
But first tell me why you
tried to kill Gennosuke-sama.

110
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:11,166
Why would you do that when
there's about to be peace?

111
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,083
No! There, is no peace!

112
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,791
The No-Hostilities Pact
has been dissolved!

113
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,791
That's why I tried
to kill Gennosuke!

114
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:22,500
Really?! The Hattori
relinquished the pact!

115
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,333
But, why now?!

116
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:30,166
The former Shogun...
Kouga, Iga...

117
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,250
The Kouga and Iga what?!

118
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,291
What about
the Kouga and Iga?!

119
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,250
We're at war! And you're dead!

120
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,625
Damn! He got away!

121
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:44,916
What the hell
is happening to you?

122
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,125
Rousai what are you doing?!

123
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:55,208
That wall! It spoke to me!

124
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:06,458
Alert! Intruders! Intruders
have entered Manjidani!

125
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,583
Go! Show no mercy!

126
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:39,708
You there, Iga! Tell me.
What sort of madness is this?

127
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:43,541
I can assure you, any
madness lies with you Kougas.

128
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,791
This is our first
time to Manjidani.

129
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:48,750
Is this how you
receive your visitors?

130
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:53,125
We detain only
those who act suspicious.

131
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:01,833
It's quite clear to us
now how you Kouga operate.

132
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:03,416
If you and your
Kouga Ninjas should

133
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,416
ever pay a visit
to Tsubagakure,

134
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,541
you will be embraced with

135
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:09,166
the same greeting
we've received here.

136
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:13,833
Only you won't walk
away to tell about it!

137
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,666
I wish I knew more,
but that's all I have

138
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,541
to relay at this time.

139
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:23,125
As more develops, I shall
receive reports from my men.

140
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,791
News should come quickly.

141
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,541
By now the violence
is will be boiling over.

142
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,416
Speaking of violence...

143
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,291
The feud among the women
in the Edo Inner Chambers for

144
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:36,833
successorship of their
sons is escalating briskly.

145
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,750
Lord Takechiyo, the
eldest son of Shogun Hidetada

146
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:52,125
is backed by his
wet nurse, Lady Ofuku.

147
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:58,041
However, Takechiyo's
younger brother Lord Kunichiyo

148
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:02,416
is supported the
Shogun's consort, Lady Oeyo.

149
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,500
Both women are
of impeccable bloodlines

150
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,041
and their animosity
for each other

151
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,916
runs as deep as their ancestry.

152
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,083
This hostility has
spread like a disease

153
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,250
through everyone
that surrounds them,

154
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:17,541
from their ministers to
their highest ranking aides.

155
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:20,125
It encompasses their every move.

156
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,125
Last winter, Lady Ofuku was

157
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,625
ambushed by an
unknown assailant.

158
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:28,541
Shortly after that, Lord
Kunichiyo was attacked at night.

159
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:32,583
More recently, Lord
Takechiyo's tea was poisoned.

160
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:36,708
Without hesitating for a moment,
Lady Ofuku placed herself

161
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:39,083
into harm's way
and sucked the poison

162
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:42,625
directly out of her
ward, saving his life.

163
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,541
I'm afraid Edo
will soon crumble

164
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:49,208
if these days continue.

165
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,041
Do not worry.

166
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,833
I have understood
from the beginning

167
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,541
the gamble I am taking.

168
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:55,416
I see.

169
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,500
I have also taken steps in Edo.

170
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,541
Taken steps? In what way?

171
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,583
By sending Tenkai inside.

172
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,916
Considering the Inner
Chambers is off limits to men,

173
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,333
I felt a priest could better
get inside and spy for me.

174
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:09,833
This way I could
end their fighting.

175
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:14,541
Which will buy us time
until this blood bath is over.

176
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,916
Is there a problem Kyohachiro?

177
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,916
You have come
back to tell us that

178
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,625
the war is over, haven't you?

179
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:42,041
Unfortunately, no...
The ninja war has spread

180
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,875
to Tsubagakure village in Iga.

181
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:48,250
We have not been able
to verify all reports.

182
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,666
They may be
nothing but conjecture.

183
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:10,666
That'll teach you!

184
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,666
He must be one
of the Kouga Ten!

185
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:39,416
I can make up for my failures
if I can bring back his head!

186
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:57,416
It's time for you to speak.

187
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:04,791
My hand... it's stuck!

188
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,791
Let go of me, you...

189
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,166
You... bitch!

190
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:45,291
I hope your journey
to hell is a swift one.

191
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:55,000
They've actually locked
away a Kouga woman?

192
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:56,916
You whore!

193
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,291
You're dead!

194
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:15,458
You certainly have some
fine skills, Kouga wench...

195
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:16,833
But you can take that as

196
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:20,208
the last compliment
you'll ever receive.

197
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,083
What's happening?

198
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:31,416
I need more of his skin.
I have to touch him.

199
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,208
What is that?!

200
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,833
I've had enough of your
trickery, you whore.

201
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,458
I was ordered not to kill you.

202
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:49,916
But you don't leave
me much of a choice.

203
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:57,333
I've heard few tales
that were more horrifying.

204
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:58,833
Kyohachiro...

205
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,291
Yes?

206
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:11,625
Koshiro! No! Please stop
this! I don't want him to die!

207
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,583
Currently, of the
ten ninja on each side,

208
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:49,041
there are now seven Iga
and five Kouga remaining.

209
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,833
And as for the, latter...

210
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,375
They are aware the
No-Hostilities Pact has ended.

211
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:58,208
It was a secret that could
only be kept for a short time.

212
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:02,583
And now...
I shall take my leave.

213
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,416
Where are you going?

214
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,166
So far, my eyes
have been unused.

215
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,916
I have left my subordinates
to witness this feud.

216
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,916
But not this time. You'll
be going out there yourself.

217
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,666
Yes.

218
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,916
Good journey to you.

219
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,208
I shall return.

220
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,833
The Iga have fought well.

221
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,666
As have all the Kouga.

222
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:51,250
From twenty fighters,
twelve still standing.

223
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,583
These times are a
true contribution to

224
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:02,125
the strengthening of
the Tokugawa shogunate.

225
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,666
A quivering soul tormented by
an incorrigible curse longs for

226
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:04,833
true love's embrace.
As orders befall the unaffected,

227
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:08,541
a startling harbinger of the
past reveals a looming threat.

228
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:11,916
The mouth at the
front-gate of all misfortune.

229
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,541
Five Kouga ninja.
Seven Iga ninja.

230
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:18,708
The path to death
continues on Tokaido Road.

231
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:22,333
On the next Basilisk,
"On Their Own."
