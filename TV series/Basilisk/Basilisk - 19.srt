1
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:28,500
Two tribes sworn to hate...

2
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:32,166
Their bloodstained bodies
left out in the open to rot.

3
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,166
Their souls longing for a
peace that they failed to find.

4
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,875
As they sought to break
the shackles of darkness

5
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:41,708
and heal the
wounds of the past,

6
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:46,791
Fate denied their quest
and thrust them into war.

7
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:59,083
The bridges of
hope some dared to build

8
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:02,625
between them were torn asunder.

9
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:07,750
Their dreams were ripped from
their hearts with a sword...

10
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:11,750
with their destiny
revealed at last.

11
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,916
Koshiro-dono...

12
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,875
That was Akeginu-dono's
voice. I know it.

13
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,458
Akeginu-dono,
what are you doing here?

14
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,791
Koshiro-dono, behind you!

15
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:23,041
The man who died
standing in the road,

16
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,250
is Muroga Hyoma of the Kouga.

17
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,000
He is?!

18
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:31,375
I understand. That is why
I did not sense him fall.

19
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:34,041
He stayed true to the end.

20
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:37,958
Muroga Hyoma,
this was all my pleasure.

21
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,166
Akeginu-dono, why are you here?

22
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,416
Has something
gone wrong at the Inn?

23
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,583
Is she... Is Oboro-sama
still hiding safely with you?

24
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:51,375
Now matter how bad
the truth, please tell me.

25
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:54,166
I must know of
Oboro-sama's fate!

26
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:57,833
Koshiro-dono...

27
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,875
It was the Kouga. Kisaragi
Saemon appeared at the Inn like

28
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:07,500
a flash of lightning.
In no time at all, he had...

29
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:10,541
He had viciously
slaughtered Oboro-sama.

30
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,416
There is nothing left
of her in this world.

31
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,750
Not my princess...

32
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,500
What now?!

33
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,458
What am I going to do now?!

34
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,500
I swore to protect her
with my life and I failed!

35
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:40,208
I failed in my sole obligation!

36
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:46,083
Dammit! Dammit!

37
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,708
I hate them!
I hate all of them!

38
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,666
Every single one
of those evil Kouga

39
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,333
will pay for
this with their lives!

40
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,125
Koshiro-dono...

41
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:57,958
You must tell me.

42
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:02,250
At the Inn... when
Oboro-sama was slain...

43
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,250
what were you doing?

44
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,750
Tell me.

45
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:12,541
I was bound hand and foot. Tied
up a like a boar for slaughter.

46
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:16,666
But I was able to free myself.
I was overcome with desperation

47
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,666
to find you and Tenzen-sama
and report what had happened.

48
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,541
I didn't think I could
evade them well enough to

49
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:25,750
make it here,
but somehow I did.

50
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:31,541
My princess is dead...
I can't bear to hear this!

51
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:34,833
Akeginu-dono,
I fear this is the end!

52
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,416
It is.

53
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,583
But now I have no regrets for I
can see the path I must follow.

54
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:47,166
Please, Koshiro-dono...

55
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,541
You must use your hands.

56
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,791
Akeginu-dono...

57
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:03,333
Use your hands and kill me.

58
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,375
Kill me. You must kill me.

59
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:13,291
I-I don't know if I can.

60
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:18,625
Please, Koshiro-dono. Kill me.

61
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,541
Koshiro-dono...

62
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:44,041
It's over. The Iga have lost.

63
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:50,166
And so, we must do
the honorable thing.

64
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:57,708
Let us die... together.

65
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,583
Koshiro!

66
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:40,583
It's tiring. The
seductive voice of a woman.

67
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:43,833
Chikuma Koshiro, all you
need to know in moving from

68
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:48,083
this world to the next is
that you died in Akeginu's arms.

69
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,750
Hyoma...

70
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:06,875
Oboro's hawk must
have made its way back

71
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,833
to the Inn where she stays.

72
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,041
We must find them.

73
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,583
Koshiro-dono?

74
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,708
Koshiro-dono? Koshiro-dono!

75
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:46,583
He's gone. Koshiro-dono.
They killed him. He's dead!

76
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,083
Akeginu.

77
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:53,708
Koshiro...

78
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:58,125
But... how?

79
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,875
They came here
just as we expected.

80
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:10,083
Saemon, if you hold
on to your current guise,

81
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:13,583
you can approach close
enough to kill them both.

82
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,166
Oboro...

83
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,791
Koshiro-dono...

84
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:32,541
They killed you, and
somehow they did not leave

85
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,250
a single mark on your body.

86
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,750
You bastard. You
killed Koshiro-dono!

87
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:54,541
Akeginu? Do you see someone?

88
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:59,458
I see a Kouga ninja who died
standing on his own two feet.

89
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,166
This sewer rat
and Koshiro must have

90
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,500
killed each other in battle.

91
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:10,333
I must take this opportunity
to use your body, Hyoma.

92
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,166
Please forgive me.

93
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,166
His face is shredded
like goose-meat,

94
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,916
but his hair hangs loose...

95
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
If memory serves, this is
a member of the Kouga clan

96
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,541
known as Muroga Hyoma.

97
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,000
Akeginu. What are you doing?

98
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:38,166
Akeginu! Stop now!

99
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,833
Akeginu, please. 
You must stop!

100
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,750
Dishonoring the dead
goes against everything that

101
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:57,583
we as Iga believe.
You should know this.

102
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:01,833
Listen... When Tenzen
humiliated Kasumi Gyobu

103
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:04,916
by staking his body
in front of that bridge,

104
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,125
I was disgusted by it.

105
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,625
Hyoma may have been our enemy,

106
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,208
but his skill
was great enough to

107
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,375
take Koshiro
with him into death.

108
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:16,916
And to disrespect that struggle,
would disrespect everything

109
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,208
that Koshiro worked
toward in his final moments.

110
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:26,791
You can see. Hyoma
didn't fall even in death.

111
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:31,500
Which says his heart must
have ached deeply for someone.

112
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,375
Do you not
agree with me on this?

113
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,583
Where is Tenzen?

114
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:45,958
Could the same fate
have befallen him?

115
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:49,541
Tenzen-sama is not dead.

116
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,291
It's impossible
if you didn't know.

117
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:10,875
Saemon-dono, are you
confident in Tenzen's death?

118
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,875
Of course I am.
I have seen enough death

119
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,791
to know it when I see it.

120
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,416
That woman is mad with grief.

121
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,541
She's doesn't know
what she's saying.

122
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:24,583
We must destroy them,
and now is the time.

123
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,916
Oboro--

124
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,875
Something is wrong.

125
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,375
What is it, Saemon-dono?
What are you waiting for?

126
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,750
People are approaching
from the east.

127
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,541
It's rather late to
be traveling with so many.

128
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,125
Father...

129
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:55,166
I assume you have
heard that Lady Ofuku has

130
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,666
secretly taken
her leave for Ise.

131
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,041
Is that the reason
for your return?

132
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,500
I suspect that she will
try and force the results

133
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,541
between Kouga and Iga.
I can deploy my men.

134
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,041
Do not.

135
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,583
As, you wish...

136
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,375
Koshiro-dono.

137
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:40,083
Put down the weapon and
identify yourself immediately.

138
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,958
Something's wrong!

139
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,583
Stay on guard. We don't know
if they are friend or foe!

140
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:55,375
We are travelers on our way
to Sunpu under the orders of

141
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:59,083
retired Shogun Ieyasu, and
I demand to know who you are

142
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:02,916
as well. There are many
enemies on this road tonight.

143
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:04,750
Wait, what's that?

144
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,250
On their way to the Shogun?

145
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,750
You dare utter his name?!

146
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:10,416
Only an insolent person
would toss his name around!

147
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,291
That's enough!
Tell us who you are!

148
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:15,333
We are Iga, traveling
from Tsubagakure.

149
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:16,416
Iga?

150
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,250
What was that?!
What did she just say?

151
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:28,458
Did you just say that
you are Iga from Tsubagakure?

152
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,791
Lady Ofuku, please.

153
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:43,125
Enough, men.
You may stand down.

154
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:48,000
I hear the truce was
nullified by Hattori Hanzo

155
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:52,083
and your people now fight
with the Kouga. Is this true?

156
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:55,708
Are you and your traveling
companion part of this war?

157
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,458
Tell me who you are.

158
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,541
I am wetnurse and caregiver to

159
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:03,083
the Shogun's
heir, Lord Takechiyo.

160
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:05,250
My name is Ofuku.

161
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:11,000
I suspect I know who you are.

162
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,916
Are your names
Oboro and Akeginu?

163
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:16,375
What do you know of us?

164
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:19,125
I know much more
than you might think.

165
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,750
Ogen herself
made a list of the

166
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:23,625
ten best ninja
she had in her clan.

167
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:27,333
This register was passed on
to Retired Shogun Ieyasu who

168
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:31,208
in turn passed it on to me. The
Iga ten have been trusted with

169
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:34,916
an important duty.
You were chosen especially

170
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,333
to serve Lord Takechiyo.

171
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,000
I would like to know,

172
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,625
who is this dead
man lying in the road?

173
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:48,541
An enemy. He was
one of the Kouga ten

174
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:51,250
and he went by the
name of Muroga Hyoma.

175
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,958
Well done! You slaughtered
one of the Kouga!

176
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:57,333
Tell me, my Iga women,
what of your comrades in this?

177
00:15:57,416 --> 00:16:00,166
Surely you do not travel
this late at night alone.

178
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,875
Where are the other
eight from Ogen's list?

179
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:10,583
They're dead.
We are all that remain.

180
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,583
How could that be?

181
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:17,208
The No-Hostilities Pact was
dissolved only a few days ago.

182
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,833
There is something
I do not understand.

183
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:54,375
A moment ago you said we were
chosen to serve Lord Takechiyo,

184
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,416
which is the first
I have heard of this.

185
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,000
Can you explain these
duties of which you speak?

186
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,958
How can you not know?

187
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,333
That's impossible.

188
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,958
You are saying that you
and the Kouga have been

189
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,750
killing each other
and no one has been

190
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:12,250
informed of a reason for this?

191
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,958
Very well.

192
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:21,625
I will explain to you. There
are extremely grave consequences

193
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,375
resting on the
shoulders of your war.

194
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,625
Are you certain
that leaving Lady Ofuku to

195
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:32,250
her own devices
is a wise move?

196
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:35,375
We let her run rampant and
unwanted conflict may surface.

197
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:38,291
It will be quite
the opposite, I believe.

198
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,875
In the interest of
preventing further strife,

199
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:44,500
I have decided to
leave Lady Ofuku alone.

200
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,083
Perhaps you did
not know that she was

201
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:52,125
the second wife of
Lord Inaba of Sado.

202
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,333
One day she discovered
that he had a concubine

203
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:55,916
who had borne him a child,

204
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,833
and he intended this
child to be his heir.

205
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:01,125
While Lord Inaba
was away from home,

206
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:05,125
Ofuku invited the concubine and
child to move into the estate.

207
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:08,416
Once there, she stabbed
them both to death,

208
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,875
calmly climbed into
her palanquin, and left.

209
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,833
The fact is that the more
you try to rein this woman in,

210
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:19,083
the angrier she becomes. And
at that point, she will cross

211
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:23,583
any bridge to spite you. It
is wiser to simply let her be.

212
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:26,041
This way there will be
less trouble for all of us.

213
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,291
Are you sure in this plan?

214
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:32,750
Kyohachiro, as the fourth
Hattori, I, Hanzo Masahiro

215
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,208
will guarantee it.
Regardless of what

216
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:38,625
conniving tricks Ofuku has
up her sleeve, there is no one

217
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:41,041
in the world who can
step in between two warring

218
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:45,750
ninja factions and wield
any kind of true influence.

219
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:57,166
Do you see now? Is it
not the most noble of causes?

220
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,750
Oboro... Akeginu...
I would be most honored

221
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:05,625
if you both joined
me on my trek to Sunpu.

222
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:08,166
In fact, given the
dangerous circumstances,

223
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,708
I must insist upon it.

224
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,416
These are the only two left.

225
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:18,333
For the sake of Lord Takechiyo,
I cannot let these two perish!

226
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,291
Ladies, what do you say?

227
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:23,791
I promise the journey will be
a worthy one for both of you.

228
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,583
The No-Hostilities Pact
that has bound our people for

229
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,958
so long has been nullified.
However, I do not intend to

230
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:34,166
resume this fight because
I see no purpose behind it.

231
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,666
Why should I
kill in the name of

232
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,958
something I do
not believe nor see?

233
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:41,250
Questions like these have
compelled me to travel to Sunpu

234
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:43,083
and ask retired Shogun Ieyasu

235
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,750
and Hattori-dono for
guidance in these matters.

236
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:48,500
We will go to Sunpu.

237
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,333
A wise decision!

238
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:53,333
Oboro-sama, we cannot run
with our tails between our legs

239
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:54,583
and let the Kouga win!

240
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:58,041
Of course not. I will
oversee their demise.

241
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:02,000
Also, I will ensure
the two of you stay alive.

242
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:07,791
The woman is right. Getting
Oboro-sama to Sunpu as quickly

243
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,875
and as safely as possible
should take priority.

244
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:16,750
As for myself,
I have other plans.

245
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:22,416
If we go to Sunpu, I can have an
audience with the Retired Shogun

246
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,375
and Hattori-sama.
Then, even if I must

247
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,250
sacrifice my own life,
I will make sure the

248
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:31,250
No-Hostilities Pact
is reinstated.

249
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,041
I would have never thought the
end of the No-Hostilities Pact

250
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:50,041
was an effort to
determine the next Shogun.

251
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:53,125
I don't know whether to
be intrigued or offended.

252
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,166
I see...

253
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,875
Finally, I understand.

254
00:23:57,541 --> 00:24:00,958
With pain and darkness
closing in from all sides,

255
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:05,083
a woman waits patiently at
Imurebashi, on the Tokaido Road.

256
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:07,375
Stoking the raging
fire within her breast

257
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:10,750
are vengeful thoughts.
Compassion grows in the

258
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:14,125
faces of those we
see and those we do not.

259
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:18,541
But humanity is most potent
in the eyes of one's foe.

260
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:22,458
On the next Basilisk,
"River of Mercy."
