1
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:28,375
Two tribes sworn to hate...

2
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:32,083
Their bloodstained bodies
left out in the open to rot.

3
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:36,833
Their souls longing for a
peace that they failed to find.

4
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:39,208
As they sought to break
the shackles of darkness

5
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:42,000
and heal the
wounds of the past,

6
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:47,083
Fate denied their quest
and thrust them into war.

7
00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:58,958
The bridges of
hope some dared to build

8
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:02,500
between them were torn asunder.

9
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:07,583
Their dreams were ripped from
their hearts with a sword...

10
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:11,583
with their destiny
revealed at last.

11
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:18,041
All this rain...
falling on Kouga and Iga...

12
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,208
Eventually it will cease.

13
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:29,666
For at some point, the clouds
must make room for the sun.

14
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:34,583
Tenzen, is there something
you need to tell me?

15
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:36,833
Tenzen?

16
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,333
I've given this
matter much thought...

17
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:42,166
And I'll be as
forward with you as I can.

18
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,833
I hope you can
forgive my bluntness.

19
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:50,500
Oboro-sama... You
must listen very carefully.

20
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,500
The retired Shogun
Ieyasu has ordered

21
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:58,583
that the pact be dissolved.
It has come to an end...

22
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,000
And so...

23
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:03,833
the hostilities between
Iga and Kouga will rise again.

24
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,416
We are at war.

25
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:15,041
You're not...
You're not serious...

26
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,041
The shackles that
suppressed the hatred between

27
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:21,833
the Kouga and the Iga for four
hundred years have been broken.

28
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:23,958
The retired Shogun
Lord Ieyasu has ordered

29
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,916
both clans to gather strength.

30
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,791
He said, "we
face each other..."

31
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,958
And to fight to the bitter end.

32
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,083
What?

33
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,791
If you doubt the
news that I bring,

34
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,708
read Lord Ieyasu's
scroll for yourself.

35
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,541
What scroll?

36
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:49,458
Oboro-sama the time has come
for you to harden your heart.

37
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,375
This is all a lie!

38
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:07,208
The Iga and the
Kouga are at war.

39
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,500
Even if the
truce is nullified...

40
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:15,375
we can't fight each other...
We can't allow this to happen!

41
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,958
Gennosuke-sama would agree.
I have to go tell him.

42
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,416
Wait!

43
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,666
You can tell him if you wish,

44
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,333
but your efforts to inform
the enemy will be in vain.

45
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,708
It has already begun.

46
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:45,916
You're right.

47
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,708
You do have more to
offer than that old man.

48
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:02,625
I'm going to suck every
ounce of blood out of you.

49
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,916
Stop whatever it
is you're doing, Rousai.

50
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,291
Tenzen needs the
ninja scroll immediately.

51
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:14,833
You, whore!

52
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,041
You're dead!

53
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:28,250
They've actually
locked away a Kouga woman?

54
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:31,666
Yes. A younger
woman named Okoi.

55
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,000
She was listed as one of

56
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:36,916
the Manjidani ten
on the ninja scroll.

57
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,125
Listed on the ninja scroll?

58
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,458
Yashamaru, you can't
tell me you know nothing of

59
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:45,208
the register or its purpose.

60
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:49,041
Of course, I know about it.

61
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,333
What are you going to do?

62
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:57,375
I'm... I'm going
to find that Kouga girl.

63
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,833
You certainly have some
fine skills, Kouga wench.

64
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,166
But you can take that as

65
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,583
the last compliment
you'll ever receive.

66
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,208
What's happening?

67
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:24,041
I need more of his skin.

68
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,958
I have to touch him.

69
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,750
What is that?!

70
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:41,583
I've had enough of
your trickery, you whore.

71
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,500
I was ordered not to kill you.

72
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:47,125
But you don't leave
me much of a choice.

73
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:08,333
After all, your name is
on Ieyasu's ninja scroll.

74
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:19,291
This body will be of no use
to you anymore, my young one.

75
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:41,125
Now that the truce is
broken, coming to this place

76
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:44,916
means certain death.
That's what is being said.

77
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,500
I can't believe
that Kouga girl.

78
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,416
Sneaking into Tsubagakure.

79
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,041
She's either brave or foolish.
Don't you think so, Yashamaru?

80
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,583
Okoi...

81
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,500
My brother...

82
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,291
My brother...

83
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,958
Okoi...

84
00:11:55,916 --> 00:12:01,416
Oh... Greetings Yashamaru...
Are you just now returning?

85
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,291
Nenki, what happened?

86
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:13,166
Keep your mouth shut about this.

87
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:20,708
You didn't answer me.
Did you just get back?

88
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:25,541
Yes.

89
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,625
This is the first I've seen.

90
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,125
Since I've
returned to this place.

91
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,416
What the hell are
you sitting down for?

92
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:43,833
I think some of
Hotarubi's snake venom

93
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:46,708
may still be coursing
through my veins.

94
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:51,166
Fooled around with
another woman, did ya now?

95
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,750
Come on. I'm
just playing with you.

96
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:02,208
Enough with the glaring? Look!
I said it was just a joke.

97
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:06,666
Hey! I'm just kidding
Hotarubi! Put that knife away!

98
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:15,708
Okoi... Okoi...

99
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,583
Okoi...

100
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:37,541
My... brother...

101
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:42,583
Please forgive me, Okoi.
I was too late.

102
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:51,708
Brother... I killed
one of them... he was old.

103
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,833
An old man.

104
00:13:54,583 --> 00:14:00,375
You did? I'm proud of you.
You've always been strong.

105
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,166
Even stronger than me.

106
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:11,625
Between the bales...
there is a scroll...

107
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:18,041
Do you hear?
You have to find it.

108
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,166
I will.

109
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,416
Brother... My dear brother...

110
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:53,750
My brother...
My brother... My brother...

111
00:14:56,916 --> 00:15:07,208
My brother... My brother...

112
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:23,458
Woman, I've
had enough of you...

113
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:26,666
Yashamaru, what
happened in Sunpu?

114
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:37,166
I cannot speak a word of
it until I see Oboro-sama.

115
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,208
You've haven't
talked to her yet?

116
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,583
That should've been
the first thing you did.

117
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,541
Tenzen-sama sought
her for a private meeting

118
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:48,916
some time ago, and she's
still there, I think.

119
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,625
Yeah, he really has
his work cut out for him if

120
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,125
he's trying to
put the moves on her.

121
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:57,333
It's actually kind of
funny if you think about it.

122
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:58,666
Even though the
war between the Kouga

123
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,791
and the Iga has finally begun,

124
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,750
Oboro-sama still
spends her time trying to

125
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:06,041
convince herself she's
in love with Gennosuke!

126
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:09,708
From what I hear...
Gennosuke's being kept alive.

127
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:12,791
That's right.
Tenzen-sama's too afraid of him

128
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,791
to bother doing
anything about it.

129
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,041
That's probably because
we don't have a clue as to

130
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,916
what Gennosuke's
really capable of.

131
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,666
Doesn't look like much to me.

132
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,750
Let me go and get
some medicine for you.

133
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,791
I often question
Tenzen's motives,

134
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,375
but that ninja
scroll is evidence of

135
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,125
our battle superiority.

136
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:37,000
Following him, we've killed
Kazamachi, Jyubei and Udono.

137
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:40,250
And let's not forget my
excellent handling of Okoi.

138
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,208
But still...
I don't understand..

139
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:45,208
Why is he holding back
from defeating Gennosuke?

140
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:48,875
I forgot about the ninja scroll.

141
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,958
I need to go find out what
the hell Rousai did with it.

142
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,291
Jingoro? What happened?
How'd you get that way?

143
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:10,375
Water...
Please help, me... Water!

144
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,166
Out you go, drink up.

145
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,583
That should be
enough water for you.

146
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,375
Rousai!

147
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,416
Hotarubi, what is it?

148
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,541
Is that Rousai?

149
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,208
Oboro-sama, please wait!

150
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,208
No! I cannot allow this!

151
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,791
Keeping that woman from
Manjidani locked up in here!

152
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:37,250
This is not how we operate!
I will not be a party to this!

153
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:38,458
Who is that?

154
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:41,166
Oboro-sama, listen!
We must not turn back!

155
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,666
Oboro-sama!

156
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,541
Yashamaru?

157
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,541
What's wrong with him?

158
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,750
Yashamaru-dono?

159
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:17,500
He's a Kouga!

160
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,458
I'll kill the bastard!

161
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:36,666
Princess!

162
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,250
The scroll!

163
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,041
It's the register!

164
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:50,833
Jingoro-dono! Turn around!

165
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,750
What? Yes, I've got it!

166
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,750
What the hell's that!

167
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,416
Ha!

168
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,250
Impossible...

169
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,625
That looks like...

170
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:23,416
Kasumino... Gyobu.

171
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,708
Where is he?

172
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:27,666
The one who disguised
himself as Yashamaru?!

173
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,625
We must not let
the Kouga escape!

174
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,083
After him!

175
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,500
You won't get away from me!

176
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:41,583
Koshiro...

177
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:42,875
Yes?

178
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,291
Gather everyone.

179
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:56,750
Gyobu...

180
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,458
Saemon...

181
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:07,625
The time has come for
our return... to Manjidani.

182
00:23:55,916 --> 00:24:00,000
A man stands in the rain,
shimmering through the drops.

183
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:02,375
His heart, all that he is,

184
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:05,458
sinks deeply into
anger and resentment.

185
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:09,791
Quiet in its remorse. Now,
this young leader will ignore

186
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:13,500
the powerful call of love to
make a choice, as he stands

187
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:15,708
balanced only
for the time being,

188
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:18,875
between life and extinction.

189
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:22,291
On the next Basilisk,
"Farewell."
