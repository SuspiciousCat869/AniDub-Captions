1
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:28,500
Two tribes sworn to hate...

2
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:32,208
Their bloodstained bodies
left out in the open to rot.

3
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:37,000
Their souls longing for a
peace that they failed to find.

4
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:39,375
As they sought to break
the shackles of darkness

5
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:42,125
and heal the
wounds of the past,

6
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:47,208
Fate denied their quest
and thrust them into war.

7
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:59,083
The bridges of
hope some dared to build

8
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:02,625
between them were torn asunder.

9
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:07,750
Their dreams were ripped from
their hearts with a sword...

10
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:11,750
with their destiny
revealed at last.

11
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:32,291
Okoi is no more.
They killed her.

12
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,166
Gyobu...

13
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:00,833
Saemon...

14
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:09,208
It's time for our
return... to Manjidani.

15
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,583
How cruel!

16
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,958
Oboro-sama...

17
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:32,583
Akeginu, you've been
deceiving me this whole time.

18
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,333
Did you kill Udono-sama, too?!

19
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,875
Yes.

20
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,916
Oboro-sama!

21
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,416
Gennosuke-sama! I'll
die if they've hurt you!

22
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:13,291
Why is he hesitating?
We have the advantage!

23
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,291
Make haste! What
are you waiting for?!

24
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:18,125
Attack us or
move out of our way!

25
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:29,208
Oh, I see... Terror has frozen
you cowards in your tracks.

26
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,208
Igas! Attack!

27
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,500
No! Wait!

28
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,000
Tenzen!

29
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,416
Tenzen?

30
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,125
What's the matter?
What are we waiting for?

31
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,500
We must attack!

32
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:48,583
Don't be hasty! We must
wait for Kouga Gennosuke

33
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:53,750
to make the first move. His
intentions are still unclear.

34
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,625
Heh! Hanzo's
pact is finally broken

35
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,916
and they're too scared to fight.

36
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,708
They're not always fearful...

37
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,083
not when they
have the advantage.

38
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:13,125
Like when they killed my sister.

39
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,000
Did it please you to murder

40
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,416
an innocent woman,
you twisted bastard?

41
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,625
You killed Yashamaru-dono!

42
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:23,750
Yashamaru? That's right.

43
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:31,666
Damn you. Murderers!

44
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,250
Control yourself, Hotarubi.

45
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:38,125
Who are you to give me orders,
you disgusting filthy Kouga?!

46
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:41,250
You spoke to me earlier
of killing Kazamachi.

47
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:45,125
Tell me, does that not
make you a murderer as well?

48
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,583
Don't pity that whore
Okoi. She tried to kill me!

49
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,041
Jingoro! That's Enough!

50
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:56,166
Now control yourself!
Do not be provoked!

51
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,416
Atta-aa-ck! In the
name of Iga honor kill them!

52
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,666
All of them!

53
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,958
Nenki!

54
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,416
Gennosuke-sama!

55
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:33,041
I knew that he had hidden powers
but this! This is madness!

56
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,916
We cannot allow him to
make it off of Iga soil alive,

57
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,250
or defeat may be certain. But
who could withstand his Dojutso?

58
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,708
Koshiro!

59
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,541
No! Koshiro!

60
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,583
Oboro-sama. You must be strong.

61
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:59,916
This war...
It cannot be stopped.

62
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:05,666
Stop! That's far
enough, Gennosuke!

63
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,791
Turn and fight, you coward!

64
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,500
You're making a
mistake Koshiro-sama.

65
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,625
We'll see... won't we?!

66
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,083
Yes, we will. 

67
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,583
Do you really think those
blades are going to save you?

68
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,250
Your tricks may work
on the weak-minded, Kouga.

69
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,166
But they won't work on me!

70
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,708
Well, he's got guts,

71
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,500
but he's obviously
lacking in brains.

72
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,000
Those burning eyes!

73
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:49,541
I have seen this sort of thing
before but this is unparalleled.

74
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:52,750
The terror on their faces.
What force could overcome

75
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:56,583
the mind that would make
another take their own life?

76
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:59,333
Koshiro can defeat Gennosuke...

77
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:02,583
But it's sure to take
more than sickles and knives.

78
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,291
Gennosuke-sama...

79
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:29,791
This next attack will decide
the outcome of the battle.

80
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,250
Yes, that's it. Use
your Cyclone Death Song!

81
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:38,041
No man can defend
himself against this attack.

82
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:41,291
Not even Gennosuke
has a chance of survival.

83
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:44,791
Its sheer force will rip
his head right from his body!

84
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:13,833
The vacuum will steal their
air in a matter of seconds.

85
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:16,500
And then comes
the finishing blow!

86
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,541
Stop, Koshiro! Please!

87
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:22,583
Oboro-sama!

88
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,208
Please! I beg you! No more!

89
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,416
Akeginu! Why didn't
you hold her back?!

90
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm sorry. I-I wasn't thinking.

91
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:37,375
This isn't the time!
Move out of the way!

92
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:40,333
Please don't ask
me to move. I can't.

93
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:44,500
I don't want either
one of you to die.

94
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:50,291
Oboro-sama! You'll get
him killed! Look behind you!

95
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,583
He's the one! Gennosuke!

96
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:56,750
It's his lethal technique that
you need to stop! Not Koshiro's!

97
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:02,791
Why do you think he has his
eyes closed?! It's a defense!

98
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:05,208
He's protecting
himself against you!

99
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:08,125
He knows your gaze
will mean his death!

100
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:21,958
Oboro-sama! Stand behind
Koshiro as he attacks!

101
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:25,500
Look at Gennosuke and
we can end this war now!

102
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,375
Koshiro's Cyclone
Death Song pitted against

103
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,916
Gennosuke's
mind-stripping Dojutsu.

104
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,208
We'll see whose skill
will come out victorious!

105
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:44,916
Koshiro! No! Please stop this!
I don't want him to die!

106
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,791
Koshiro!

107
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:19,458
Damn! She'll be
the death of us all!

108
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,708
Gennosuke-sama!

109
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:56,208
No! Please! Don't go!

110
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:03,375
Love has turned a deaf ear...

111
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:07,333
Gennosuke-sama,
please, come back to me.

112
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:59,000
He lives. But he
has permanent damage.

113
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,583
He punished his eyes with
his unforgiving Death Song.

114
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:12,000
I see... Stay by
his side night and day.

115
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,625
As you wish, Tenzen-sama.

116
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:18,458
Oboro-sama... Your
behavior out there...

117
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:23,333
It was inexcusable. Damn
it! You should know better!

118
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,000
If you were not
Old Ogen's successor,

119
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,750
you would have no place here!

120
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:30,083
I'm sorry, Tenzen. Truly.

121
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,750
Don't apologize! Not to me!

122
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,750
Apologize to your Ancestors
and your Grandmother!

123
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:39,208
To the 400 year old
Iga Clan that you betrayed!

124
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,708
Three of the Iga
Ten have been slain...

125
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:50,916
Ogen-dono... Rousai...
and Yashamaru as well.

126
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,875
And now, Koshiro has
suffered serious injury.

127
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:59,083
To make matters worse, they made
off with Ogen-dono's scroll.

128
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:02,583
According to the terms of
the war we must have it to win.

129
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:05,500
Why must you
insist on complaining.

130
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,208
We've waited our
whole lives for this day,

131
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:08,666
we should be celebrating!

132
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:12,833
We'll slay every last one
of them! Death to the Kouga!

133
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,375
Years from now
the Kouga will be

134
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:17,083
nothing more
than a distant memory!

135
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:20,833
You're right, Nenki. But
in order to achieve victory

136
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:25,375
Oboro-sama must agree to take
her place and stand at our helm.

137
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:28,166
It's your birthright...
You're our chieftess...

138
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,875
We can not defeat
Gennosuke without you.

139
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:33,125
On the grave of
your Grandmother Ogen,

140
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:37,416
swear that you'll use your
power to help us slay him!

141
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,750
Oboro-sama!

142
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:52,416
I can not...

143
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,750
I can not use my power
to kill Gennosuke-sama.

144
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:58,875
You must! How can you think
of denying your own people?!

145
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,083
What about all of
our innocent children?!

146
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,708
Whether they live
or die depends on

147
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,541
you and the power
of your Mystic Eye!

148
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:11,250
I don't understand, Tenzen.
Why all this hatred?

149
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:14,583
Why are the Kouga
considered our mortal enemy?

150
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:20,333
I know why you have
asked this question.

151
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,625
Because of your Grandmother...

152
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:25,041
She raised you
as an innocent girl.

153
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,416
She chose not to
speak of bad things.

154
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,750
Such what the
Kouga did to us...

155
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:33,791
after the Oda army
attacked Tsubagakure.

156
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:43,208
What do you mean
after the Oda attacked?

157
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:46,291
What'd they do? Tell me.

158
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,791
Your Grandmother
insisted that we were

159
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:50,166
not to speak of such things.

160
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,041
She didn't want
you to be troubled.

161
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:54,500
That's why you
never heard the story.

162
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:57,958
Yes... None of us
knew why that was so.

163
00:18:58,041 --> 00:18:59,833
The Oda destroyed our village.

164
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:02,166
The Kouga had
nothing to do with it.

165
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,416
That's true, Oboro-sama...

166
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,708
But the Kouga learned about

167
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:08,166
the Oda's surprise
attack before it occurred.

168
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,458
So they waited for
us in the forest.

169
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:13,458
They killed our
survivors as they fled.

170
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:17,666
Of course, they were too
cowardly to own up to it.

171
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,875
That's right.
The Kougas denied that they

172
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,000
were ever there that night.
But your Grandmother saw them

173
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,583
attack us with her own eyes.

174
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:27,125
If not for the Hattori's
No-Hostilities Pact,

175
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,958
we would have killed them
all long ago. Spineless scum.

176
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,375
But even so... Gennosuke-sama
and the others had

177
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:37,041
nothing to do with that!
Nor did we, for that matter!

178
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:40,500
We are the descendants!
We must avenge our ancestors!

179
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:44,750
And you're our leader!
What more needs be said?

180
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,958
Before the horrors
of that night took place,

181
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,000
your Grandmother
Ogen-dono was planning to

182
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,833
marry Danjo of the Kouga.

183
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:58,125
Ogen's situation was not unlike
the one you're facing now.

184
00:19:58,208 --> 00:19:59,541
Danjo begged
her to continue their

185
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,750
love affair but
she wouldn't have it.

186
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,416
She forsook her
own heart's desire

187
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,250
for the good of her people.
She knew it was her duty

188
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:09,583
to lead the Iga and
she dedicated her life to it.

189
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:13,083
And Danjo, the same man
that begged her for her love,

190
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,833
is the one who
murdered her in Sunpu.

191
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,833
So bury your emotions
and become the leader that

192
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,875
you were born to be!

193
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,875
Your Grandmother
will be proud if you do.

194
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:32,000
I need a little time.
Please, excuse me.

195
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,916
I think that did it.

196
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:04,208
I wish I was like you,
Grandmother. So strong and wise.

197
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,958
Please, forgive me.

198
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,208
I don't see Udono.

199
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:30,250
Okoi isn't with them either.

200
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:31,625
Saemon-dono is
covered in blood!

201
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:52,625
What is your
decision, Oboro-sama?

202
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:04,000
Chieftess. Have you taken
ill? You don't look well.

203
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:08,666
Oboro-sama!

204
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:59,875
The secret chambers resonate
with tales of bloodshed,

205
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:02,375
while the architects
of war watch coldly from

206
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:04,916
their seats of power.

207
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,666
Innocents, ignorant of
the unseen river of blood

208
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,458
are unaware that
ambitious serpents

209
00:24:09,541 --> 00:24:13,250
are waiting to strike
and shape their destiny.

210
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:16,375
Like ninja shadows,
skillful spies become

211
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:18,833
the eyes of a fading ruler.

212
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:22,750
On the next Basilisk:
"Divine Mandate."
