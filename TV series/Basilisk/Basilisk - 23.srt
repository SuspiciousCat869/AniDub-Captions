1
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:28,791
Two tribes sworn to hate...

2
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:32,500
Their bloodstained bodies
left out in the open to rot.

3
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:37,291
Their souls longing for a
peace that they failed to find.

4
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:39,666
As they sought to break
the shackles of darkness

5
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,375
and heal the
wounds of the past,

6
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:47,458
Fate denied their quest
and thrust them into war.

7
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,500
The bridges of
hope some dared to build

8
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:03,041
between them were torn asunder.

9
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:07,958
Their dreams were ripped from
their hearts with a sword...

10
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:11,958
with their destiny
revealed at last.

11
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:12,041
Do not feel any bitterness
toward me Gennosuke.

12
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:15,291
You should direct those
feelings at Tokugawa.

13
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:18,375
Hate the Retired Shogun.

14
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:22,541
He used us to
determine his successor.

15
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,916
But above all things...

16
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,791
hate yourself for
being born Kouga!

17
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,125
Gennosuke-sama!

18
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:38,750
I've waited... so long.

19
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,708
But the day is finally upon us.

20
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,166
Hyoma...

21
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,625
Gennosuke-sama?

22
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,958
Gennosuke-sama...

23
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:50,625
Gennosuke-sama!

24
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,250
No...

25
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:18,250
Gen... no... suke!

26
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:44,041
Gennosuke-sama.
Are you alright?

27
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,000
I am, Oboro-dono.

28
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:52,916
Good.

29
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,250
It's time.

30
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,625
Do you have as sword?

31
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:09,958
What?! What do you
mean Oboro has vanished?!

32
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:21,875
You have all heard swords
clashing... but here you sit...

33
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,250
You look like
trembling barmaids.

34
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:30,750
If she ends up dead,
you will all pay dearly for it!

35
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:38,000
No... I do not have a sword.

36
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:42,083
Then take up
his sword, Oboro-dono.

37
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:46,666
We must finish this.

38
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:54,125
It is not certain
that I will win.

39
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,375
There is a chance
that you may best me.

40
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:03,833
As I stand here,
my eyes have been blinded.

41
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:07,750
Mine as well.
I am also blind.

42
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:12,083
What?! By one
of your own people?

43
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:15,833
No... I sealed them myself.

44
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:20,958
I've had no desire to help
this war from the beginning.

45
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,000
Oboro-dono...

46
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,666
Gennosuke-sama...

47
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,666
I beg of you...

48
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,500
Please, kill me...

49
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:58,166
Before these eyes open
again, I ask you to kill me.

50
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,583
Oboro-dono...

51
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:10,875
I am the only one of
the Kouga who remains.

52
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:14,708
And there are
no more of the Iga.

53
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:23,000
Hurry and take
the sword, Oboro.

54
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:28,916
Gennosuke-sama...
What is this?

55
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,083
Kagero?

56
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:34,041
Why? Why don't
you kill her now?

57
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:42,125
The Kouga... of Manjidani...
are trusted... to you...

58
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,250
Gennosuke-sama...

59
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,250
Are you going to betray us?!

60
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,833
Kagero...

61
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:10,375
That Iga woman deceived you.
This was all her plan.

62
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:13,291
She used me to lure you here!

63
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:15,791
I know.

64
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,375
Kill her... kill her now...

65
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:40,291
Kill her... You must.

66
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,125
Let us leave.

67
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:06,041
There is no safe place...
Nowhere for you and I to go.

68
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:10,250
Nowhere we
can be... together...

69
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,375
Gennosuke-sama?!

70
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,583
Gennosuke-sama!

71
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,791
Oboro...

72
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:41,541
Leave here and live
the rest of your life alone.

73
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:51,875
Don't do it... He can't die...

74
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:54,833
Get away from him!

75
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,000
Gennosuke-sama!

76
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,041
My breath.

77
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,750
I have no more.

78
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:26,916
Gennosuke-sama!

79
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,125
Gennosuke-sama...

80
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,500
Oboro...

81
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,333
Gennosuke-sama...

82
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,583
Oboro...

83
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,166
Gennosuke-sama...

84
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:46,125
I... never...
wanted... to kill anyone...

85
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:57,416
I never...
wanted anyone... to die...

86
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,875
I cannot lose you.

87
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,166
Tenzen-dono!

88
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,250
What happened to him?!

89
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,666
It was the Kouga!

90
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,791
Gennosuke must have been here!

91
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,583
Tenzen-dono!

92
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:38,708
He's dead again!
Tenzen-dono's dead!

93
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:42,500
Enough! All of you calm down!

94
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,750
Tenzen is an immortal ninja...

95
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:58,083
I thought we were
all clear on this.

96
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,458
Yes, my lady!

97
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,750
Now get Tenzen
back on his feet.

98
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:06,041
And stick that severed
head back on his shoulders.

99
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,583
Don't tell me you're
afraid of a little blood?!

100
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:17,125
Takechiyo-sama's
future is at stake here!

101
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,458
And with that, my future
and the future of each and

102
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:23,208
every one of you! Now,
grab his head and lift him up!

103
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,791
Grandmother...

104
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:10,250
One word of
caution for you, Oboro.

105
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,208
In all of your
dealings with Tenzen,

106
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,583
I want you to remain guarded.

107
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:21,166
So far, you have never
witnessed it with your eyes.

108
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:25,291
You see, Tenzen uses something
that makes him immortal.

109
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:29,166
To call it a ninja
technique would be a lie.

110
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,375
Something lives inside of him.

111
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:34,541
His body is nothing
but a host to a parasite.

112
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,500
Since it happened many
years before I was born,

113
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,250
I cannot tell you with any
certainty what it is that

114
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:44,791
swims in him, how it got there,

115
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:47,833
or where it came
from in the first place.

116
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,958
However... It is my
personal belief that

117
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:55,208
the thing nesting
inside him is a...

118
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:58,291
Is...

119
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:01,000
Can you not
tell me what it is?

120
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,458
I may have said too much.

121
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,208
Let us forget this subject
was even mentioned.

122
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:10,208
You are only starting
your life in this world.

123
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:13,791
There is no benefit in you
knowing so much, so early.

124
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,458
Alright...

125
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,458
It's my old brain.

126
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:21,541
I fear senility is
causing me to ramble.

127
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,583
Grandmother...

128
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,875
You tried to warn me.

129
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,041
O... bo... ro...

130
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:59,375
Oboro? Your eyes...

131
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,541
They've been unsealed!

132
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,583
Will this work?

133
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,833
Wait. Something's wrong.
It's not working.

134
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,583
Tenzen-sama?

135
00:17:56,208 --> 00:18:02,208
The Kouga... Gennosuke...

136
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:12,416
Behind Oboro... He is
hidden... Under the stairs...

137
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:45,625
You are only starting
your life in this world.

138
00:18:56,416 --> 00:19:00,666
There is no benefit in
your knowing so much, so early.

139
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,500
We, the Kouga Manjidani...

140
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,583
And you, the Iga Tsubagakure...

141
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:36,250
are one in the same.
Masters of fierce Ninja arts.

142
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,583
We were reared from
birth as sworn enemies

143
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:44,250
caused by dissension years ago.

144
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:51,250
It's foolish how over time
reason was lost to hatred.

145
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:59,166
You are only starting
your life in this world.

146
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,833
We must become the bridge
that unites Kouga and Iga.

147
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:10,166
There is no benefit in
your knowing so much, so early.

148
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,833
They'll eventually come around.

149
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:16,541
I never wanted to kill anyone.

150
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,916
Why? Why?

151
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:26,250
Tell me!

152
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:47,791
Is he... Is he actually dead?

153
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:58,541
Now, Oboro, tell me...

154
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:03,416
Was Tenzen speaking
truth with his last words?

155
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:10,083
He was. Behind me
lies one of the Kouga,

156
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:13,250
broken and collapsed from
Kagero's poisonous breath.

157
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,666
That is wonderful!

158
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:19,208
No! He is unable
to defend himself.

159
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:25,416
Killing him would bring us
no honor. That is not our way.

160
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,458
Well, I did not expect to
hear such words from a ninja.

161
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,208
Very well, then.

162
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,833
Send a messenger
to Hattori Hanzo.

163
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:41,625
Yes, my lady.

164
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:42,916
Prepare a horse!

165
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Right away!

166
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:50,500
You and Gennosuke will face each
other and fight to the death

167
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:53,458
before an audience
with Hattori Hanzo-dono.

168
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,375
Do you object to this?

169
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:10,250
I do not.

170
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,125
I will fight him.

171
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:58,916
Above all others exist
two untarnished souls.

172
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,833
They fall into the
widening chasm of sorrow,

173
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:05,583
while the choking grasp of those
hellbent on power takes hold.

174
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:10,458
As all slips away, these two
still seek to bind their love.

175
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:12,791
How many lifetimes
must be journeyed?

176
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:15,083
How many loves must be lost?

177
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:19,250
How many generations must
pass for there to be peace?

178
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:22,625
On the final Basilisk,
"Requiem."
