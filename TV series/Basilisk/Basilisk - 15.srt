1
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:28,916
Two tribes sworn to hate...

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,375
Their bloodstained bodies
left out in the open to rot.

3
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:37,166
Their souls longing for a
peace that they failed to find.

4
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,541
As they sought to break
the shackles of darkness

5
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:42,250
and heal the
wounds of the past,

6
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:47,333
Fate denied their quest
and thrust them into war.

7
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:59,416
The bridges of
hope some dared to build

8
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,958
between them were torn asunder.

9
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:07,875
Their dreams were ripped from
their hearts with a sword...

10
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:11,875
with their destiny
revealed at last.

11
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:27,041
We will reach the port
very soon, but the Igas...

12
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,958
You predicted they would go
ahead. Do you think they did?

13
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:34,208
Yes. If they had not, our
journey across the land

14
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:38,458
would have been pointless.
They would have found us.

15
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:47,708
He is there... on board.

16
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:53,625
At this moment, Gyobu is
crossing swords with the Iga.

17
00:03:57,375 --> 00:04:00,208
Once that man has his mind
and heart set on something,

18
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:04,916
no one can stand before him.
He is an impassible force.

19
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,458
But... you're dead!

20
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:17,166
Trickery usually doesn't work
on me. I'm impressed Gyobu.

21
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,833
I killed you myself
with my own hands!

22
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:23,375
You're dead! I felt
the life leave you!

23
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,875
Is that so? Well then I
suppose you have a ghost

24
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:30,833
standing before you now.
No, I am very much alive.

25
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:33,041
And you have failed again.

26
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:45,208
Yes. Great skill.
Perfect for running away.

27
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,041
This boat is simply
too small for you to

28
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,625
keep hiding like a coward.

29
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:53,166
If you must resort to words
to hurt me, your cause is lost.

30
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:57,875
My excitement to slay you Iga is
almost boiling through my skin!

31
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,666
Jingoro-dono...

32
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:47,291
Now. Hurry and climb the rope.

33
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:54,541
Your death will not pass
unnoticed. I will avenge you.

34
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,458
Your aim is off since
coming back from the dead.

35
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,958
Is that so?
You should know this.

36
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,750
My sword was not forged to kill
filth from the Kouga world,

37
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:36,708
but I have no other means.
Especially if your way...

38
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:39,583
is to hide in
the darkest shadows...

39
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,083
cowering from the
face of your enemy.

40
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:45,708
You forget your history.
It is the gutless Iga who

41
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,333
wait in hiding
as they have done

42
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,708
since the betrayal
of the Tensho Era.

43
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,500
What are these lies you speak?

44
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:55,458
Before the Oda army attacked
the Iga, my father was ambushed

45
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:58,166
and slaughtered
outside of our village.

46
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,291
That is the way of your people!

47
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:09,625
Perhaps you are right. Now, what
are you going to do about it?

48
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,500
Father...

49
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,166
Just stay by me.

50
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:36,375
You're cruel... Gyobu... Hiding
while an innocent is killed.

51
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:41,250
This is on your shoulders.
Since you refuse to face me.

52
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,875
An Iga ninja
preaching about cruelty?!

53
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,125
Your soul is as
lost as your mind!

54
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:50,625
Even if you forget your people's
evil deeds, fate will not.

55
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,875
And today I am your fate.

56
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:04,625
I will never forget
that day. Never...

57
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,666
You hesitated. Why, Gyobu?

58
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,875
Did you feel it cowardly
attacking from behind?

59
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:13,625
Or somewhere inside, do you
have sympathy for you enemy?

60
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:18,125
My son. Such actions betray
your weakness.

61
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:23,375
The kind of weakness that
will dig your grave someday.

62
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:27,333
There is no talk of
compassion in the ninja code.

63
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,583
If you wish to
survive in this world,

64
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:34,333
you must be able to overcome
this weakness of empathy.

65
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:40,833
Yes, father. It
won't happen again.

66
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:12,833
Father, are you
going to Tsubagakure?

67
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,500
The constant squabbles
between the Kouga

68
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:18,291
and the Iga have
become far too abundant.

69
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:21,583
Both sides are worn thin.
I have been ordered by

70
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:24,916
Danjo-sama to meet with
them as a representative.

71
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:35,125
Father please... Please
take caution on your journey.

72
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:39,291
I am a ninja. Do you think
that I would forget my training?

73
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:01,041
I am going to be
around a long time.

74
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:06,166
The rift between our
clans is not a cloth to be

75
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,750
sewn back together
in an afternoon.

76
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:12,541
But more blood spilled is
not a way of life for either.

77
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:15,958
Only a fool would continue
the clash past this point.

78
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:18,791
We've planned a path to harmony.

79
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:29,291
It is my desire to have a long
life of peace with you, my son.

80
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:33,708
That is why I take my
leave today. I will be back.

81
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:47,291
Father? How would you like
a hot pot of forest greens for

82
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:50,166
dinner when you come back?
They're perfectly in season.

83
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,416
I'll even use
mother's special recipe.

84
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,250
Down!

85
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:09,500
It was an Iga trap! Bastards!

86
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,250
Father...

87
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,541
Father...

88
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,291
Gyobu, my... son...

89
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:59,416
Father don't die...
You can't die!

90
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:08,250
No crying... Ninja's have...
no need for... compassion.

91
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,750
You can't die, father...

92
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,708
After that bloody day,
the No-Hostilities Pact was

93
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:58,333
forged by the first Hattori
Hanzo. I would never be able to

94
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:02,625
avenge the murder of my
greatest mentor, my own father.

95
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:05,750
That day changed me
from the inside-out,

96
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,666
and I made my decision.

97
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:18,750
I would thrive on one thing
above all others: my hatred.

98
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,708
The one thing that
pushes me forward is

99
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:26,291
my undying loathing
for the Iga.

100
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,458
Hatred... that extends to all
of their people.

101
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:33,083
It is my food. It is
my water. It is my shelter.

102
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:36,000
It is my lack
of any compassion.

103
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:47,125
The boy has become a man.

104
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:56,625
Your mouth flaps
about with such pettiness.

105
00:14:57,583 --> 00:15:01,250
Can't you see?
I feel no sorrow for you,

106
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,458
casting away your compassion.

107
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:06,875
It is a useless
emotion in our world.

108
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,000
As for your father,
I have a strong sense that

109
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,125
you will be
with him quite soon.

110
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,833
Don't you speak of him!

111
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,416
The crate. It's moving!

112
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:37,375
Hurry son, come on!

113
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:41,625
Wait, no!

114
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:11,291
Nice to see you again. I had
forgotten what oafs look like.

115
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:15,000
Name calling. You've sunk
low in your play to break me.

116
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,625
But you won't forget my face.

117
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,083
You're dead!

118
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:46,875
What have you done?!

119
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,083
Papa!

120
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:53,125
Papa?! Papa, no!

121
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,250
Please don't die!

122
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:58,416
Papa!

123
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,125
Gyobu!

124
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,708
No more hiding!

125
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,416
Such perfect timing!

126
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:33,833
Say hello to your father...
Kasumi Gyobu.

127
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,375
Having heard no
word from these two,

128
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:21,541
I fear they must also be dead.
You fought well my friends.

129
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,416
Iga and Kouga.

130
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:35,458
We have each four pawns, and
the end game is drawing near.

131
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:49,083
We may act alone, but
we are a clan above all.

132
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:58,166
In this game... Iga shall reign.

133
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:34,833
I don't know what that is.
Is that some kind of art?

134
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,833
It looks like a
man is in the boards.

135
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,000
Let's go. I don't like this.

136
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,333
Gyobu...

137
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:52,250
Gyobu...

138
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:58,250
Another member of our
great clan has fallen.

139
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:11,916
Grandfather... Kazamachi...
Jyubei... Josuke... Okoi...

140
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:21,333
Oboro-dono...

141
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:59,166
A distant past resurfaces
where the innocence of

142
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,708
youth clears the way to
an understanding of the lives

143
00:24:01,791 --> 00:24:03,833
and trials of enemies.

144
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:06,833
Time can wring hatred
from the bones of the old,

145
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:10,250
but the children hold no such
convictions in their hearts.

146
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:13,791
Two youths, much too young
to recall anything but peace,

147
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:18,791
see past the denials of history
and lay a plan for their future.

148
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:22,833
On the next Basilisk,
"First Impressions."
