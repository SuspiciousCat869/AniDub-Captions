1
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:28,750
Two tribes sworn to hate...

2
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:32,541
Their bloodstained bodies
left out in the open to rot.

3
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:37,333
Their souls longing for a
peace that they failed to find.

4
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:39,708
As they sought to break
the shackles of darkness

5
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:42,375
and heal the
wounds of the past,

6
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:47,458
Fate denied their quest
and thrust them into war.

7
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,458
The bridges of
hope some dared to build

8
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:03,000
between them were torn asunder.

9
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:08,000
Their dreams were ripped from
their hearts with a sword...

10
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:12,000
with their destiny
revealed at last.

11
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,041
An Iga!

12
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,625
She is wounded. I
can handle her by myself.

13
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,416
Are you sure?

14
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,791
Kagero. You need to go back

15
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:37,458
and keep close watch
over Gennosuke-sama.

16
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:10,291
Yashamaru? That's right.

17
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:14,833
Control yourself, Hotarubi.

18
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,375
Kisaragi... Saemon!

19
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,583
These damn spring rains,
they chill me to the bone.

20
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:06,375
I wonder if Nenki and Hotarubi
have had any success in

21
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:09,000
tracking the Kouga clan
to where they've been hiding.

22
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:14,125
I only hope they have not dug
their own graves in the process.

23
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,833
To think what we've missed.

24
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,250
We should have killed Gennosuke

25
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,166
when that chance
fell at our feet.

26
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:29,208
But I suppose our noble
leader never wanted that.

27
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,500
That doesn't surprise me.

28
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:35,458
Perhaps she wasn't
meant to be a leader.

29
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:44,291
Uh... I... It's cold as death!

30
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,166
Are you alright?

31
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,833
I've been wanting
to apologize to you.

32
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:36,708
Before I saw you at our marriage
meeting, I had my mind made up.

33
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:39,500
I told myself that no matter
what kind of man you were,

34
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:43,125
if you would have me,
I would give myself to you.

35
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,625
I'm sorry for making
that decision too soon.

36
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:48,916
Now that I know my feelings
for you run as deep as they do,

37
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,500
I need you to tell me
that you feel the same.

38
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,875
Am I alone in the
feelings I have... or...

39
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,166
Your eyes are what drew me...

40
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,875
The first time I
gazed into them, I knew.

41
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,708
You are the one for me.

42
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:23,125
Thank you, Gennosuke-sama.

43
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:27,666
I feel I'm a novice in
this kind of conversation.

44
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,458
No more than I.

45
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,791
We're two of the same.

46
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,625
Oboro-dono.

47
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,291
The frost is finally melting.

48
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,750
This harsh winter
will soon be over.

49
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,375
I've longed for spring.

50
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:00,750
So many things that were
old become new once again.

51
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,750
This has been
nothing but a ruse.

52
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,791
Who are you to give me orders,
you disgusting filthy Kouga!

53
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,625
Don't worry. He's dead.

54
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:48,541
Do you bring word
of Hotarubi? Saemon?

55
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,708
I do. She used those
butterflies of hers as a decoy.

56
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:56,041
Which direction
did they take you?

57
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,875
To the east.

58
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,583
Which means, Hotarubi
will most likely be

59
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,541
traveling in the
exact opposite direction.

60
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,458
She's moving west to Suzugako.

61
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,125
What do we do now?

62
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:10,041
Even if Oboro-sama
had never come between us,

63
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,958
I still would have
been defeated by those eyes.

64
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,833
Such a deep fury.

65
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:20,583
Is he a man... or is he a demon?

66
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,958
Who's... there?

67
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:46,791
Someone... behind me...
I can feel it...

68
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:51,833
Who is it?
Who's there? Who is it?!

69
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,250
Who is it?! Who's there?!

70
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,583
Who are you?!

71
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:18,750
Wait... Koshiro-dono...

72
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,041
What's the matter with you?

73
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,875
Koshiro-dono.

74
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,875
Disgusted.

75
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,916
I'm disgusted with myself.
I'm such an embarrassment.

76
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,916
Hotarubi! Hotarubi!

77
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,083
The trip to Sunpu!
I can't believe it!

78
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,958
Ogen-sama has asked me
to take the journey with her!

79
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,666
See, you never know
about old people.

80
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,583
I guess she hasn't
gone senile just yet.

81
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:05,916
I'll shut up.

82
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,375
Smart.

83
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:11,375
Of course I'll coming
back with a gift for you.

84
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:12,875
Wh-What do you
want it to be?

85
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,458
A nice, new hair ornament?

86
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:17,583
Or perhaps the finest sash strap
the seamstresses have to offer?

87
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:18,833
I am a ninja girl.

88
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,958
I don't think I could
use any of those things.

89
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:25,333
Hotarubi... You can't train
every second of every day!

90
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:28,541
There's always time to be a
woman! Just look at Oboro-sama!

91
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,333
Wait! Where are you going?

92
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,291
Someplace...

93
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:47,750
The No-Hostilities Pact is
a good thing, I believe.

94
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,958
I believe it when
I look at you, my love.

95
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,250
Yahamaru-dono...

96
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:56,125
These are the
most beautiful hands.

97
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:58,625
I never want to
see blood on them.

98
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,375
I will never forgive them.

99
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,166
We should go now.

100
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,125
But... We should
head back separately.

101
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,750
Yes.

102
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,750
Is something wrong?

103
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,625
It's nothing.

104
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,333
I have a question for you.
It's about Oboro-sama?

105
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,041
What do you think of her?

106
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,250
Gennosuke has
resolved to part ways with

107
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,875
the Iga, and with Oboro-sama.

108
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:31,458
That leaves the responsibility
resting on her shoulders

109
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,875
to feel the same about him.

110
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:42,166
Oboro-sama must help us. We
need her to make sure that

111
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,083
Gennosuke is dead
before he reaches Sunpu.

112
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:49,125
I am deeply sorrowful
for what she must endure.

113
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:55,916
As a woman, I know her pain.
And truth be told, I pity her.

114
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:01,958
My wish is for her to one day
truly forget about Gennosuke.

115
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:06,500
But I don't know if it is
in her to do what is necessary.

116
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:09,125
That is where
I agree with you.

117
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:13,416
I thought... I thought
I knew every expression

118
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,833
Oboro-sama's
face had to offer.

119
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:20,250
From happy to sad, fearful
to angry... I was wrong.

120
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:29,333
With him, I had never
seen an expression on her face

121
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,708
like when she was with him.

122
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,875
I cannot describe it.

123
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,000
Koshiro-dono...

124
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:52,208
Thanks to him I will
never have to see her.

125
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:59,208
I will never have to see her
getting drenched by the rain.

126
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,375
Is that you, Akeginu?

127
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,375
Yes, it's me.

128
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:40,791
You're soaking wet. What
have you been doing outside?

129
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,083
Akeginu?

130
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,791
I'm fine.

131
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:47,625
Oboro-sama, it's late. You
have got to get some rest.

132
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:51,041
Please Akeginu,
don't leave me alone.

133
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,541
I couldn't bear it...
losing any more of

134
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:59,458
those who mean
so much... My people...

135
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,000
Gennosuke-sama...

136
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:20,916
Oboro-dono...

137
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:02,333
It looks like I've finally
caught up to you, Hotarubi.

138
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:07,333
I've got good news for you.

139
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:12,208
I managed to wipe out Gennosuke
along with all the others.

140
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:57,958
Heading west without
a moment to spare,

141
00:23:58,041 --> 00:24:00,833
a young female warrior comes
face to face with a man who

142
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:03,750
may not exactly
be what he appears.

143
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:06,208
As he bears his teeth
to cut through flesh,

144
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:09,125
lovers embrace on a
threshold of tragedy.

145
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:13,000
A road that knows only to place
turmoil before its travelers.

146
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:15,833
And the fate that awaits all
is something much too cruel to

147
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:18,708
be called anything but carnage.

148
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:23,000
On the next Basilisk,
"A Swarm of Butterflies."
