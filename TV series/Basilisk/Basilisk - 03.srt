1
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:28,500
Two tribes sworn to hate...

2
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:32,208
Their bloodstained bodies
left out in the open to rot.

3
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:36,791
Their souls longing for a
peace that they failed to find.

4
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:39,458
As they sought to break
the shackles of darkness

5
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:42,166
and heal the
wounds of the past,

6
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:47,250
Fate denied their quest
and thrust them into war.

7
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:59,083
The bridges of
hope some dared to

8
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:02,625
build between
them were torn asunder.

9
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:07,750
Their dreams were ripped from
their hearts with a sword...

10
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:11,750
with their destiny
revealed at last.

11
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:24,541
This is the original
scroll granted to Danjo.

12
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,333
There's no doubt a
replica was given to

13
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,625
Kazamachi to
deliver to the Kouga.

14
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:33,375
We must intercept him...

15
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:36,666
To rid a web you
must eliminate the spider.

16
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,750
There is no room for chivalry in
a war between Ninjas, Koshiro.

17
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:45,000
If we fail our people
will die. Do you understand?

18
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,583
Yes.

19
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,125
Tenzen-sama...

20
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:51,083
Do you think Yashamaru-dono
has made it home, yet?

21
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,541
Hmm...

22
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:55,541
Yes, judging by the hawk's
return to the encampment...

23
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,583
He should arrive
at Iga Tsubagakure

24
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:00,291
late tonight or
early tomorrow morning.

25
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,458
Well, hopefully.
That's if he managed to

26
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:05,000
make it out of
Sunpu with his life.

27
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:12,416
Jingoro.

28
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,750
Hmm?

29
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,375
Oboro-sama may cause
trouble if she finds out...

30
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:19,375
It's best if we leave
her in the dark for now...

31
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:22,166
As long as the contents of
the scroll are kept hidden from

32
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:26,000
Gennosuke and Udono,
they pose no threat.

33
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,750
I understand. Treat
them as honored guests.

34
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,666
But, if I get the chance,

35
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,625
do I have permission
to kill Gennosuke?

36
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:36,125
Hmm. Don't fool yourself.

37
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:39,916
Gennosuke is not someone
who can be killed so easily.

38
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:44,583
Those eyes of his... there's
something unnerving about them.

39
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:47,500
He is a frightening adversary.

40
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,916
We can't afford
to make mistakes...

41
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,458
Don't do anything until
we get back. Understood?

42
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,458
Hmm... Don't worry.

43
00:04:57,291 --> 00:05:02,750
Good... Now then...
Let us find Kazamachi...

44
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:07,458
Remember, no mercy will
be spared to our enemy...

45
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,916
What's wrong?

46
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,250
That carriage next to
us is transporting a Kouga!

47
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,541
Kill the carriage bearers only!

48
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:05,041
You are a Kouga I presume...

49
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:08,666
Step out of
the carriage... Now.

50
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,208
And what would
you do, if I told you no?

51
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:43,625
I recognize you... that face...
Are you not Jimushi Jyubei?

52
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,583
I didn't know I was
so well known out here...

53
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:50,083
I guess a beautiful face
like mine is hard to forget.

54
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,208
Where were you
heading in the carriage?

55
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:56,666
Heh... What carriage? The
one you so rudely destroyed?

56
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,875
Enough!

57
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:02,583
My apologies... We
were under the impression

58
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:05,083
you were someone else.
That's why we attacked...

59
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,666
I am Tenzen of the Iga clan.

60
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,083
Hmm.

61
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:12,458
We're all on edge. Ogen
hasn't returned from Sunpu...

62
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:16,291
We fear that something dreadful
may have happened to her.

63
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,791
Yes... I understand...

64
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,708
I saw misfortune in his stars

65
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:23,500
and I too fear
for Danjo-sama's life.

66
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,333
Astrology...

67
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,833
So that is your talent?

68
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,541
I can handle this alone.
I want the four of you to go...

69
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:36,416
Find Kazamachi
Shogen and kill him.

70
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,208
Now...

71
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,041
I know that you're one of

72
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:51,291
the Kouga Manjidani Ten.
You didn't become one of

73
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:54,708
the best Kouga Ninjas
with your Astrology...

74
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:59,333
No. You have
many special talents.

75
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:04,875
Tell me what techniques are
used by the Kouga Manjidani Ten!

76
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:09,833
Answer! Or I'll
chop off your head!

77
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,625
Why do you laugh?

78
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:19,291
Your stars show
misfortune as well!

79
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,458
If my enemies learned
of my secret technique...

80
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:58,291
I wouldn't last
more than a day.

81
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:05,583
So the Iga are annihilating
the Kouga Ninjas...

82
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:10,791
Why now? Something unexpected
must have happened at Sunpu.

83
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,833
And I'm going
to find out what.

84
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,000
I think marriage
between the Kouga

85
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,458
and the Iga is a
great idea! Don't you?

86
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,166
He's a mess... Sorry.

87
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,750
Hmm? Hmm.

88
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,333
Look, Akeginu-dono!

89
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:12,708
The ancient Ninja hand-holding
technique! Let's try it!

90
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,750
This is it! It's begun!

91
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,958
You're Igas... You would
defy the No-Hostilities Pact

92
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,541
and attack a helpless Kouga?

93
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:05,041
We know the pact has been
broken and you have the scroll.

94
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,500
Hand it over!

95
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:10,500
Scroll? Now how
did you know about that?

96
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,625
Do not underestimate
the Iga Clan.

97
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:15,458
We know all about the
scroll and its contents.

98
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,791
Well since you put it
that way, I guess I only have

99
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:24,333
one option don't I? To cross out
your names with your own blood!

100
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,916
Not a chance!

101
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,791
I thought I was going
to have to miss dinner...

102
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:10,500
What an unexpected treat...
I love eating brains...

103
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:13,500
and Iga brains all the more.

104
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:20,250
Now... who wants
to be the first course?

105
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:39,208
Look at the size of that head. I
must say, you are well endowed.

106
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:42,125
You must have a brain
the size of a watermelon.

107
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:46,750
I usually save the best for last
but this is too good to pass up.

108
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,791
Now how do you
want to be eaten?

109
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:52,250
Dead... or alive?

110
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,458
It is you who will be food!

111
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:06,125
Arise, arise,
my sleeping flies.

112
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,166
Latch onto his web and
light a path. Then eat away at

113
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,875
his silken thread. And finish
him off like a smothering wind.

114
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,750
You must not sway,
don't let him fight.

115
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,416
Devour this spider,
savor each bite!

116
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,791
Now! Quick!
Throw Koshiro's sickle!!

117
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,041
Did I not mention?!

118
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:56,125
My hair's more dangerous
than my hands and feet!

119
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:59,666
We all have our secrets!
Now you know mine!

120
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:07,916
No!

121
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,291
Damn!

122
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,333
Huh?

123
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:25,916
Jyubei!

124
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,916
Death awaits you Kouga!

125
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,916
Is Yashamaru-dono still alive?

126
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:13,916
Tell me!

127
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:36,000
Tell me! Tell me, damn you!

128
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:18,291
Yashamaru-dono.

129
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,125
Got you now!

130
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,791
Damn he's fast!

131
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,916
You seem to be in a dilemma.
You need to get by me,

132
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,666
but you can't do it
without dropping the scroll.

133
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,875
How else will you be
able to use the dagger that's

134
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:30,833
hidden in your throat?
That's it, right?

135
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,208
That's your secret.

136
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,375
What do the stars
say now, Jyubei?

137
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:08,166
That trick only works once.

138
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:13,041
Tenzen!

139
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:19,000
Jyubei won't be
troubling us anymore.

140
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:44,041
One copy should be enough.

141
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:47,333
We have no
need for two scrolls.

142
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,166
What became of Kazamachi?

143
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:07,041
He's dead... I made sure of it.

144
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,916
Seven still remain.

145
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,500
Indeed. We're well ahead.

146
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:30,875
It appears Fortune is on
our side... it's Destiny.

147
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:33,708
The Iga will conquer the Kouga.

148
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:01,208
You're excited.
Now who's walking fast?

149
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,791
Come in...
Welcome to Tsubagakure.

150
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,875
You beat us back.

151
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,875
Goodness. You came, too?

152
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:35,416
I left early to make
preparations for the feast.

153
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,208
Jingoro spares no expense
when he throws a party.

154
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,708
Especially for
such important guests.

155
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,666
We're honored to be here.

156
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,500
I wish Grandmother was back.

157
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,750
She'd be happy
to see you again.

158
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:53,416
I smell sake... Is
Iga sake sweet? Or sour?

159
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:59,083
Amid a maelstrom of hatred,
a piercing enemy takes flight.

160
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:01,250
Blinded by loyalty and trust,

161
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:05,000
forgiveness will be the
end of one ninja's life.

162
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:08,333
Brethren, ignoring true
love's unwavering path,

163
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:11,291
cloud the night
like a dark crimson mist

164
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:14,000
drenched with
treachery and deceit.

165
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:18,625
Weak and worn, a cunning
assassin laughs mockingly.

166
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:22,375
On the next Basilisk,
"The Horned Owl."
