1
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:28,458
Two tribes sworn to hate...

2
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:32,208
Their bloodstained bodies
left out in the open to rot.

3
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:36,958
Their souls longing for a
peace that they failed to find.

4
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,333
As they sought to break
the shackles of darkness

5
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:42,041
and heal the
wounds of the past,

6
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:47,125
Fate denied their quest
and thrust them into war.

7
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:59,041
The bridges of
hope some dared to

8
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:02,583
build between
them were torn asunder.

9
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:07,708
Their dreams were ripped from
their hearts with a sword...

10
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:11,708
with their destiny
revealed at last.

11
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:08,208
I'm sorry I'm so late.

12
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:11,333
Oboro-dono.

13
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,583
Gennosuke-sama.

14
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,500
I can't do this.
Not now... Sorry.

15
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:02,500
What is it, Oboro-dono?
Tell me what's wrong.

16
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:07,041
Please forgive me... Ever since
grandmother left for Sunpu,

17
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:11,958
I've been so worried...
I fear the worst has come.

18
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:16,375
I couldn't bear it if we
never saw each other again...

19
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,875
I would rather die.

20
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,208
Let's try not to
worry about things that

21
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,958
are out of our control.

22
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:28,666
Our happiness lies within
ourselves, in the way we

23
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,750
feel for each other. No one
can take that away from us.

24
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,666
The long standing feud
between our families

25
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,166
has been put to rest.

26
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,625
The Kouga and Iga are bound
by the No Hostilities Pact.

27
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:42,500
You have little to
fear in the way of war.

28
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,125
I too had my doubts
when Lord Ieyasu requested

29
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:55,541
a demonstration of each
clan's Ninja techniques...

30
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:58,833
But when I heard Hattori
Hanzo-dono would be there...

31
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:02,750
All worries dissipated, you
knew he was there, didn't you?

32
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:06,291
Yes... Of course I did.

33
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,708
Fate has given our
families the opportunity to

34
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:21,208
step into the light and
establish lasting peace.

35
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,416
I believe this is
Hanzo-dono's intent in

36
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,916
calling our elders
to meet with Ieyasu.

37
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,583
My Grandfather
was convinced of this

38
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:32,083
as well when he
set off for Sunpu.

39
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:39,375
I feel so foolish... My
weakness got the best of me...

40
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:43,333
I don't know what I'd
do if a war ever broke out...

41
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,000
I was born into a Ninja clan
and yet I've never mastered

42
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:49,750
any of the Martial Arts.
Isn't that pitiful?

43
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,458
No, there's nothing
wrong with that...

44
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:54,125
The Arts are for
defense, not for war.

45
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,750
Yes, but it's a
shameful thing for a Ninja.

46
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,708
Especially when your
Grandmother happens to be

47
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,333
the Elder and
leader of the tribe.

48
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:03,875
Grandmother tried so hard to
train me but I still managed

49
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:07,083
to let her down. I guess
I'm just a hopeless case.

50
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:10,958
You just weren't suited
for it. Oboro-dono. Besides...

51
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:13,291
I believe the day will
soon come when the Kouga

52
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:16,208
and Iga will finally live
in harmony and Ninja skills

53
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:19,458
and even war itself
will be forgotten.

54
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:22,666
Gennosuke-sama?

55
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,208
Yes?

56
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,208
What could have
caused the Kouga and Iga to

57
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:29,333
bear such hatred for 400 years?

58
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:33,208
I don't know... and
perhaps there is no answer.

59
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,083
But instead of
being mired in the past

60
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,916
we should look to the future...

61
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,333
Our future. We
must ask my Grandfather

62
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:42,000
and Ogen-dono to set
a date for our wedding.

63
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:45,250
We will. We'll ask them
the moment they return.

64
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:16,833
Heh! So what do we have here?

65
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:20,208
Hmm? A hawk with a scroll...

66
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:23,208
News traveling so
quickly must be important.

67
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,625
Hmm. Looks official.

68
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:31,541
Who did that?! Who's there?!

69
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:36,666
You have no claim
on that scroll, Udono...

70
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,666
Hand it over to me.

71
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,125
Well! If it
isn't Azuki Rousai!

72
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,833
You never know who you'll
meet out here these days...

73
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:47,625
Who'd you kill to get
such lavish clothes, old man?

74
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:50,625
Lavish? And I thought
this was a modest choice.

75
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:55,000
Now hand it over. That
hawk belongs to Ogen-sama.

76
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:58,291
It was transporting a
scroll. Now even a man of

77
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:01,083
your intelligence can figure
out the scroll belongs to

78
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:03,166
Ogen-sama as well.

79
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,458
Ohhh?

80
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,500
Perhaps I'm not
being clear enough.

81
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,958
That scroll was intended
for Ogen which means

82
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,083
it's off limits to the Kouga.

83
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,041
Oh really, let's read it?

84
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:16,625
I'll bet it contains a
message from Sunpu Castle.

85
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:19,333
Well I'm curious... Aren't you?

86
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,583
A message straight from Sunpu!

87
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,500
Udono!

88
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,833
Calm down, Rousai, or you're
sure to break a blood vessel...

89
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:29,125
Let's be civil. You know as
well as I do that we're bound by

90
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:32,708
the pact made with the Hattori.
And besides, Gennosuke-sama

91
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,541
and Oboro-sama are
engaged to be married

92
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:37,458
and soon we'll
all be a happy family.

93
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:42,500
So if you insist on battling
for this, let's do it for sport!

94
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,208
Even in sport death is certain.

95
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,583
Are you so dense
as to think otherwise?

96
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:49,375
No worries here.
Just a friendly contest...

97
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:54,500
We'll see who's better... me
or you... The Kouga or the Iga!

98
00:08:58,666 --> 00:08:59,750
Come on old man.

99
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,083
Let me show you
what Kouga means!

100
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,375
I'm going to teach
you rotten Kouga all about

101
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,625
the humiliation of defeat!

102
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,416
And we'll see about
that damn wedding!

103
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,833
Peace with the
Kouga makes me sick!

104
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,666
That's cheap...
Damn Balloon Technique...

105
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:39,916
Get down here you
spineless abomination!

106
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,666
You think I'm afraid of you?

107
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,208
I see you!

108
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:09,625
You're mine!

109
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,083
You really had me
going there old man,

110
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,791
it looks like you still got it.

111
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,541
And you have amazingly,
quick movements...

112
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,958
for a bloated rhino.

113
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:01,375
Udono!

114
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,083
Danjo-sama had to
have gained control of

115
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:47,791
the Iga scroll by now. Soon
this Ninja war will be over...

116
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,833
and death will
come quick in the night...

117
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:53,041
Long before they've
even found out it's begun.

118
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:06,208
Danjo-sama's star
has met grave misfortune.

119
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,583
I fear we are in danger.

120
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,958
The stars have
more to tell us...

121
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,791
a dark shadow over Kazamachi.

122
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,708
Don't worry. I'll find
them and bring them back.

123
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:22,000
No, I'll go myself.

124
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,083
Gennosuke-sama!
I fell asleep!

125
00:12:57,166 --> 00:13:02,041
Why didn't you wake me up? My
people will think that we've...

126
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:06,958
So... As long as we know the
truth, that's all that matters.

127
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:10,166
Besides, you seemed
like you needed the rest.

128
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:14,458
You haven't been sleeping
too well lately, have you?

129
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:15,875
No.

130
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,500
We had better be leaving now...

131
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,666
I'm sure your
people are worried...

132
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,000
Let's get you back home.

133
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:24,000
We can't go. We never even...

134
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,833
We'll save it for
our next meeting...

135
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:28,250
Sometimes rest
is more important.

136
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:31,000
You're right.
We should get back.

137
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,375
What's wrong? Are you okay?

138
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,583
I'm fine...
I just can't keep up...

139
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:05,416
You're just walking
a little too fast for me.

140
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,000
Oboro-dono, I'm Sorry.

141
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,541
Don't worry.

142
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,291
The same thing
happened the other day.

143
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,416
My mind starts to
wander and I don't realize

144
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,375
how fast I'm going.

145
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:17,458
Truly, It's nothing.
I'll try to keep up.

146
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:20,000
Oboro-dono.
Please. Take my hand.

147
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,083
That way we won't
become separated.

148
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:25,583
Forgive me for being so
careless. I think too much.

149
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:29,166
I get so absorbed that I forget
where I am. You understand.

150
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,750
Yes.

151
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:41,833
Gennosuke-sama? What is it?

152
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:53,416
Oboro-sama. Thank
goodness you're safe.

153
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,000
Akeginu, what
are you doing here?

154
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,083
You shouldn't be
alone in a place like this.

155
00:14:57,166 --> 00:15:00,291
It's too dangerous...
Ogen-sama would never approve.

156
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:03,958
I wasn't alone, I promise
I've been in good company.

157
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,333
Nenki?

158
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:11,833
We were getting worried because
you were late returning home.

159
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:14,916
So we just decided
to form a little search party.

160
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,708
Hotarubi? You came as well?

161
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,125
I beg your pardon.

162
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,833
I understand your
concern for Oboro-dono.

163
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:28,166
We're glad you're safe...
But you left us no choice...

164
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,333
What were you thinking staying
out the whole night like that?

165
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:34,041
I'm sorry, Akeginu...
But there's nothing to be

166
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:37,166
worried about when
I'm with Gennosuke-sama.

167
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:41,083
Jingoro? Is the
whole village here?

168
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:44,000
Ogen-sama still has
not returned from Sunpu.

169
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:47,125
Until she does, you're
our leader... Perhaps you

170
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:50,583
should bear this fact in
mind and behave accordingly.

171
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,166
No I am the one to blame...

172
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,666
Please forgive me. I
will not let it happen again.

173
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,916
No, please.

174
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,458
By the way Oboro-sama...

175
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:00,250
Did you happen to see Rousai
anywhere since you've been out?

176
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:01,458
Huh?

177
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,083
He left Tsubagakure
to check on something

178
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:06,291
he spotted in the sky...
He's been gone ever since.

179
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:09,416
No... I haven't seen Rousai.

180
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,875
Hmm?

181
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,500
Josuke!

182
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,583
Oboro!

183
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,125
Josuke! What are
you doing here?

184
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:46,208
Gennosuke-sama! Have
Oboro-sama look the other way!

185
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,583
Please. I don't
want her to look at me.

186
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,625
What's the matter
with him? Is he...

187
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,083
He's in fear of
your gaze, Oboro-dono...

188
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:56,791
It's your Mystic Eye. He knows
that you mean him no harm

189
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:59,541
but the effect of your
eyes is still the same.

190
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:02,166
You have the power to
break any ninja hold or

191
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,458
technique simply by looking
into the eyes of your attacker.

192
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:08,541
It's a very
special gift, your power.

193
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,500
Grab him! Grab Udono!

194
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,875
He has a scroll with
him that belongs to us!

195
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:19,875
He stole it! It's
Ogen-sama's scroll from Sunpu!

196
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:32,333
Is this true,
Udono... Speak plainly.

197
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,625
Well, sort of...
I didn't take it.

198
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:37,375
A bird dropped it. And then
we decided to duel for it.

199
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:38,333
What?!

200
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,541
Oh, no! We just did it
for sport! It wasn't serious...

201
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:43,625
You fool!

202
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:48,708
Gennosuke-sama, please forgive
me! I didn't mean any harm!

203
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:51,041
Here Oboro-dono.
See what it says.

204
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:55,083
No! Get back! That
scroll belongs to the Iga!

205
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:57,333
Don't open it in front of him!

206
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,500
Jingoro! Why not
he's to be my husband...

207
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:03,791
That may be so, Oboro!
But he is still a Kouga!

208
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,750
If we allow a Kouga
to read Ogen-sama's scroll,

209
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,250
then we have
failed in our duty to

210
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,708
protect the
Iga in her absence!

211
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:13,583
Enough! You know
that we plan to marry!

212
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:16,333
Yes, but there hasn't been
a formal announcement yet...

213
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,958
Has there?

214
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:23,791
No... There hasn't
been... Not yet anyway.

215
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,000
Who do you think
you're talking to?

216
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:29,541
Gennosuke-sama is the
heir to the Kouga Manjidani!

217
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:33,958
This is a grave insult.
Piss on your Iga Scroll! We...

218
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,625
Gennosuke-sama,
I-I was just trying to...

219
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,958
Start a fight?
We've had plenty of that.

220
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,541
Come, Udono. Let's go.

221
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:46,208
My love don't leave! Look!

222
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,708
See what
you've done?! Take it!

223
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:53,541
Gennosuke-sama!
Udono-sama! Wait!

224
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,875
Please! Forgive
their ill temper!

225
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:57,458
I don't blame them.

226
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:01,000
This river of animosity
between our two clans has been

227
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,541
flowing for centuries.
We can't expect to

228
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,666
change its course
in a single day.

229
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:09,250
Tempers are bound to
flare but we must remain calm

230
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:12,583
and patient and set the example
we want others to follow.

231
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:16,500
I did the exact opposite.
You must think I'm so weak.

232
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,833
I even threw the scroll.

233
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:21,291
You told me earlier you aren't
suited to the Martial Arts

234
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:22,750
and that you lack ability...

235
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,500
But that throw you
made was right on target.

236
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:42,708
What is it?
What did Grandmother say?

237
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,125
What's so funny?

238
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,875
Oh everything is
just fine Oboro-sama!

239
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,666
The news is very good indeed!

240
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:52,000
Lasting peace was negotiated
between the clans at Sunpu!

241
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:54,333
Your Grandmother and
Danjo-sama are taking in

242
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,708
the sights at Edo
at this very moment!

243
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:59,916
Wonderful! It sounds
too good to be true!

244
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:06,541
Forgive us for being
so rude. We were obliged to

245
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:09,416
remain guarded until we
received word from Sunpu.

246
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,000
I understand completely.

247
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:13,666
Well, why don't you come
with us? What better way to

248
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,375
announce peace than for Kouga's
heir to visit Tsubagakure.

249
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,458
That's an excellent
idea, Nenki! Of course!

250
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,083
It'd mean so
much, Gennosuke-sama.

251
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,750
Will you please come.

252
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,916
Very well.
How could I say no?

253
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,416
That's right. What?! Hey,
you shouldn't go Gennosuke!

254
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,250
You haven't heard from
Danjo-sama! It's not safe!

255
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,625
It's not?

256
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,916
You can come and look
after Gennosuke-sama...

257
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,208
Just to be safe.

258
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:50,291
Y-Yeah... Well...
I guess I could... Why not?

259
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:54,458
We'll celebrate!
Drink sake! Do some dancing!

260
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:55,750
We'll meet
you at the village.

261
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,916
We're going to do
some hunting for the feast.

262
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,208
Take good care of our
honored guests, Akeginu.

263
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:05,500
I will... You know me.
I aim to please.

264
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:11,041
Hotarubi...
We must inform Tenzen.

265
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,958
Yes, I understand.

266
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,583
Ogen-sama is dead.

267
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:42,583
It appears Kouga
Danjo is also dead.

268
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:45,375
They must have
killed each other.

269
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:48,791
That's probably
how they wanted it.

270
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:53,875
Tenzen-sama?
I don't understand.

271
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,541
That's because you are
still too young, Koshiro.

272
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:12,041
Finally it has been broken!

273
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:16,083
Since the Tensho Era,
the No-Hostilies Pact has

274
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:19,041
tied the hands
of the Iga and Kouga...

275
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:22,500
But now... our hands are free.

276
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:58,333
The No Hostilities Pact has
been broken and the race to

277
00:23:58,416 --> 00:24:01,041
finish an unsettled
score has begun.

278
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:02,958
As the wheel of fortune turns, 

279
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:06,958
two bloodthirsty warriors
speed down a perilous path.

280
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:10,875
Meeting is only the
beginning of separation.

281
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:14,000
While a spider spins
his web strand by strand,

282
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:18,250
the smallest insect
may cause death by one bite.

283
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:22,833
On the next Basilisk,
"The Onslaught of War."
