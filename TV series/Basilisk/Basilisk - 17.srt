1
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:28,833
Two tribes sworn to hate...

2
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:32,583
Their bloodstained bodies
left out in the open to rot.

3
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:37,333
Their souls longing for a
peace that they failed to find.

4
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:39,791
As they sought to break
the shackles of darkness

5
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:42,458
and heal the
wounds of the past,

6
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:47,541
Fate denied their quest
and thrust them into war.

7
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,500
The bridges of
hope some dared to build

8
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:03,041
between them were torn asunder.

9
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:08,041
Their dreams were ripped from
their hearts with a sword...

10
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:12,041
with their destiny
revealed at last.

11
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:32,041
It's Ogen's hawk.
And it's carrying a scroll.

12
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,500
Stay here. I'll get it!

13
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,916
Kagero... Do not
pursue it too far.

14
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Of course not. I understand.

15
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,333
Wait here.
I'll go with her.

16
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:55,416
That is the hawk that once
belonged to Ogen of the Iga.

17
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,000
Now that she is
in the next world,

18
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:59,541
only one person
can be controlling it.

19
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:00,875
Oboro.

20
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:20,458
Two of them stayed behind.

21
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:23,500
From what I could hear,

22
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,083
it appears Hyoma is
the one to my left.

23
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:29,166
So the one to my
right must be Saemon.

24
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,250
Nenki had his opportunity.

25
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,166
He could have finished
off each one of them,

26
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,208
but here they stand
while his remains

27
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,458
have become part of the earth.

28
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:45,500
I will succeed where he failed.

29
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,000
You can stop trying
to hide yourself, Tenzen.

30
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,625
I can sense
every step you take.

31
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:59,208
I know that voice.

32
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,500
The hawk flies
as if to lead us.

33
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:15,291
Saemon-dono...

34
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:16,291
Over there.

35
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:17,458
I see.

36
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,541
Our enemy has escaped.

37
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:54,791
But not too far. She must
be keeping an eye on us.

38
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:57,083
She would not be so careless
as to attack the two of

39
00:05:57,166 --> 00:06:00,416
us while we stand together.
We must let this go for now.

40
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,750
But why?

41
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,166
If she is nearby and we
cannot sense her presence,

42
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,833
then I am certain we are
not being lured by Oboro.

43
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:10,791
Aside from being born into this
world with her Mystic Eye,

44
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:14,750
Oboro possesses no other skill
or knowledge of the ninja arts.

45
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,500
She knows no stealth.

46
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:19,500
It's too quiet.

47
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,125
I fear the Iga
have lured us away

48
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,875
in order to trap the others.

49
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:28,791
Wait.

50
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:34,208
How shrewd. The Gennosuke
who chased the hawk...

51
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,750
He was actually Saemon.

52
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:40,708
And here we stand.

53
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,000
It is you.

54
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,875
I commend your work
with Nenki and Hotarubi.

55
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:06,125
They were worthy opponents
and you bested them with ease.

56
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,375
Both of you are blind. Pity.

57
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:14,791
You missed seeing
your friend Gyobu.

58
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,916
I left him the way he died
and placed him in your path.

59
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,083
No.

60
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,833
Both of us saw him
with our mind's eyes.

61
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:25,458
And we bid our farewells.

62
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:28,458
We prayed for him on his
journey to the next world.

63
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:31,708
And we thank you for
allowing us this honor.

64
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:37,000
So you mock me. Do you?

65
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,666
Then why don't you see
this with your mind's eye!

66
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:52,375
Kouga Gennosuke...
It has been my desire to

67
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:55,583
allow you to live right
up until the very end.

68
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,583
That way you could
witness the extinction of

69
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:00,708
the Kouga as well as
my marriage to Oboro-sama.

70
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,958
Only then would I kill you.

71
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:05,416
But it appears...
the stars have fated your

72
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,541
moment of death to be now!

73
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,958
Sheathe your sword, Tenzen.

74
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,791
We are traveling to
Sunpu only to confirm the

75
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:22,000
intentions of retired Shogun
Ieyasu. Find your remaining Iga,

76
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:25,666
escort them back to
your village, and wait there.

77
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,500
We desire a true end to
the violence erupting from

78
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:33,875
the dissolution of
the No-Hostilities Pact.

79
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,125
This vicious hatred
that has permeated

80
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:39,041
both our people's since
the battle of the Tensho Era

81
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:42,916
could well be forgiven
and forgotten very soon.

82
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:47,500
This rivalry has been
four hundred long years

83
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:50,500
and both sides have
sacrificed too much blood.

84
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:54,208
With this blood soaked deeply
into the soils of the earth,

85
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,583
many still know very little of

86
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:58,708
why we remain
locked in this turmoil.

87
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,541
We would like to
see a different end than

88
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,875
the digging of
countless graves.

89
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:05,750
And so... We are
asking you, Tenzen,

90
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:09,791
as the leader of your people and
as Oboro's chief confidant...

91
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:13,041
Let us sever these
ancient binds of hatred.

92
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:18,166
All of which I speak is the will
of the Kouga leader Gennosuke.

93
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,500
Hyoma...

94
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:29,125
Of all the ridiculous
things to bring up now!

95
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,833
Gennosuke, are you a coward?

96
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,916
What about your letter
challenging us to find you?

97
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,125
He had no choice.

98
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:41,791
There are many among us
who loathe the Iga people.

99
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:46,791
Now Hyoma. I feel you
compensate your lack of sight

100
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:50,833
with a clever tongue and
an even quicker parade of ideas.

101
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,375
I've misjudged the Kouga!

102
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:23,000
Yakushiji Tenzen...
You are wrong about one thing.

103
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,583
I will not witness
your marriage.

104
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:29,833
Ha. You accept your death?

105
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:35,625
No. Your blood will be
spilled before that happens.

106
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,375
Not only are you blind,
but you are mad as well.

107
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,291
Now, Gennosuke-sama...

108
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:48,041
Yes, Hyoma, I permit
you. Look upon him.

109
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:31,083
It is difficult to surpass.
Such an incredible mentor.

110
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,458
I do not deserve such praise.

111
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:37,625
I am merely your substitute
while darkness holds your eyes.

112
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,583
That is not true.

113
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:44,041
You know me. You've
seen through my walls.

114
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,333
I have built them around
myself to the point where

115
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:52,583
I even worry Saemon and Kagero.
They see me as a useless leader.

116
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,791
We all understand
how you feel.

117
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:58,041
It is not a weakness
that we see in you.

118
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:03,208
It's just that... There is
such a deep hatred for the Iga.

119
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,500
This hatred has warped
any perspective we might have

120
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:10,083
on these matters. It is
the sole emotion we have felt

121
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,791
toward the Iga our entire lives.

122
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:16,833
It is not something
trivial. It is very real.

123
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:20,041
And it has lead us
to where we now stand.

124
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:23,500
We have crossed
a line in the sand.

125
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,250
I do not want to
lose you to this fight.

126
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,083
The Kouga have cared
for me since birth.

127
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,375
You are all precious to me.

128
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,666
Gennosuke-sama!

129
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,125
Please, tell us you're not hurt!

130
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,125
Calm yourselves. We are fine.

131
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,625
I am just glad
both of you are safe.

132
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,458
Tenzen has fallen.

133
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,791
Here... Nenki and Hotabrubi...

134
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,291
As well as
Jingoro have all had

135
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,625
their names
crossed out in blood.

136
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:02,666
It must be...
the blood of Gyobu.

137
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,833
He fought like a warrior.

138
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:09,583
Gennosuke-sama... forgive us...

139
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,750
we let the hawk
get away from us.

140
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,625
And we could
not find its master.

141
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:22,375
When you find this
hawk again, I want it dead.

142
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:25,333
Along with the one
who is leading its way.

143
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:32,041
Even if it is Oboro?

144
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:35,166
Are you ordering her
death through our hands?

145
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,791
Yes I am. She is
nothing but an Iga woman.

146
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:44,041
Saemon. Kagero. You
need not appear so surprised.

147
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,500
Gennosuke-sama ordered me to

148
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,208
look upon
Tenzen with my Dojutso.

149
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:52,208
It is important that we take
all opportunities that arise.

150
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:00,250
Hyoma. Kagero. Would
you please go on ahead

151
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:03,500
and accompany
Gennosuke-sama to Okazaki?

152
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:07,333
Saemon-dono.
What will you do here?

153
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:11,125
This corpse and I have
some unfinished business.

154
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:14,625
I feared him most. For
I did not know his skills.

155
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:17,666
I had thought him to be
superior in his techniques.

156
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:21,875
But in the end, he was as weak
as a pig in line for slaughter.

157
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,458
Thank you, Akeginu.

158
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:54,333
I'm sorry I insisted on bathing.

159
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:55,916
No need for apologies.

160
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,083
The salt in the
air can be very dry.

161
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:01,458
You're right for wanting
to protect your delicate skin.

162
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:04,125
It must have been uncomfortable
for you out on the sea,

163
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,125
I should have noticed.

164
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,666
Oboro-sama, I am going to
take you and make you my wife.

165
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,875
You were raised to be the
next leader of the Iga people.

166
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,208
If we are to ensure our
bloodline into the future,

167
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,750
then you must
take a worthy husband.

168
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:23,208
These breasts have gone
untouched by Gennosuke,

169
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:26,416
but I can feel them
growing warm under my touch.

170
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,291
I can feel their longing.
Seducing a woman is an

171
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:33,208
ancient ninja technique.
And I am very skilled.

172
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,208
Akeginu...

173
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:39,583
Yes?

174
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,541
Would you please scrub harder?

175
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,541
The flautists...

176
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,166
The ones that were
playing on the boat.

177
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,500
Were they traveling
minstrels do you think?

178
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:04,833
Papa?! Papa, no!

179
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,958
I wonder what
has become of them.

180
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:13,708
Oh. I wouldn't
know that. Maybe...

181
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,541
maybe they have
continued their journey

182
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,750
on to the next performance.

183
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:21,041
I wish to hear
that music again.

184
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,250
Our paths could cross
any time in the future.

185
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:37,083
Has Koshiro retired
for the evening?

186
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:40,458
I never had the chance
to express my gratitude.

187
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:46,000
I know he had to endure
great pain in following orders.

188
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:49,625
I was hoping that before Tenzen
returned from his patrol of

189
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:53,375
the area, I would have
a chance to thank Koshiro.

190
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:55,708
Well, I am afraid...

191
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,708
that the two of them have
gone out to scout together.

192
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:02,875
By now they must be
nearing the city of Komaba.

193
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,625
They plan on slaying
Hyoma this night.

194
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:09,416
But how? Koshiro does
not have use of his eyes!

195
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,375
I know that. I
tried to stop him, too.

196
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,083
You say this
because you fear for me?

197
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:19,791
No... I... It's Koshiro.

198
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:22,625
You know this is not
a journey for pleasure.

199
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:26,125
Yes... Right...
Please forgive my concerns.

200
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:31,375
It is a fact that on the
road a traveling companion can

201
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:34,875
sometimes become
much more than a friend.

202
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:37,625
That... That's not it at all.

203
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,666
Once we kill off
all of the Kouga,

204
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,125
we can enjoy two
wedding ceremonies.

205
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:45,791
One for Oboro and myself,
and one for you and Koshiro.

206
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:48,541
No. That's not what I meant.

207
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:59,500
Do not worry Oboro-sama.
Koshiro-dono is well.

208
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:03,291
I'm sure. I feel it inside.

209
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,541
You do?

210
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,041
I've never been more sure.

211
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,500
Tenzen-sama...

212
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,125
What happened on the
boat was simply an act to

213
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:24,125
draw out the Kouga I knew
to be lurking in the shadows.

214
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:27,208
It is now time to put
this out of your mind.

215
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:48,125
Where have you
gone Tenzen-sama?!

216
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:52,166
You cannot leave
me alone! Tenzen-sama!

217
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,291
Ogen's hawk!

218
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:02,458
Have you seen
Tenzen-sama? Is he all right?

219
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:05,791
Where are you going?

220
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,750
To what are you leading me?

221
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,875
I don't understand
why this has happened.

222
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:15,833
How did I ever come
to hate the Kouga?

223
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,625
I walk down this
path toward death

224
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:20,250
and I don't know
the reasons we fight.

225
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:23,416
My princess.

226
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:28,458
I will protect my princess
as well as the Iga.

227
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,666
The honorable Iga
people, who raised me to

228
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,791
be the man I've become.

229
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,291
My princess...

230
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:43,166
Yes. I will take the princess
away from this world of horror

231
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,125
and blood. And I
will stay by her side,

232
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:50,375
forever protecting
her. This is my oath.

233
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:21,291
What can I do
in this condition?

234
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,500
Gennosuke...

235
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:27,041
I do not doubt love
you feel for Oboro-sama.

236
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:32,916
But how can you
be satisfied with

237
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,416
the nightmare we
are putting her through?!

238
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,750
No, please don't go!

239
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:44,583
Gennosuke-sama, please.
Come back to me.

240
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:50,916
You are nothing but a Kouga.
If the Kouga were dead,

241
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,333
my princess wouldn't
have to endure such pain!

242
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,333
You are still
unsure of yourself

243
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:05,375
and it reflects in
your heavy footsteps.

244
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:09,375
Gennosuke-sama, I do not
blame you for how you feel.

245
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:13,083
It is a result of youth,
this uncertainty, but

246
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:15,791
time mercilessly carries
on without regard to

247
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:19,500
anyone's desires.
Even those of a leader.

248
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:22,125
As the man entrusted
to protect you,

249
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,250
I may be wrong in saying this,

250
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,958
but I feel you should stay
unsure of yourself until

251
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:30,541
you are the last
remaining Kouga in this world.

252
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:33,291
When I see Danjo-sama
in the next life,

253
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,416
I will apologize
to him personally for

254
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,333
harboring these thoughts.

255
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,291
But since Danjo-sama
is not here to guide you,

256
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:43,916
I stand alone in my duties.

257
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,291
What is it that you sense?

258
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:55,541
A presence.
Someone is approaching.

259
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,541
Are you Kouga?

260
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:14,583
I know that voice...
It is Koshiro.

261
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:58,708
A displaced soul,
swallowed by his vow to

262
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:00,708
protect what innocence remains,

263
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:03,916
revels in the eyes
of chance and misfortune.

264
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,250
Pressured to surrender
the reigns to the past,

265
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:08,666
another must leap
to selflessness alone.

266
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:12,541
For a sacrifice must be made
to ensure the safety of another.

267
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:16,166
Cloaked in the moonlight, the
pale rider with fiery eyes of

268
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,750
death will unravel the fated.

269
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:22,625
On the next Basilisk,
"A Dawn Without Light."
