1
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,916
Two tribes sworn to hate...

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,583
Their bloodstained bodies
left out in the open to rot.

3
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:37,333
Their souls longing for a
peace that they failed to find.

4
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:39,666
As they sought to break
the shackles of darkness

5
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,458
and heal the
wounds of the past,

6
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:47,541
Fate denied their quest
and thrust them into war.

7
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,375
The bridges of
hope some dared to build

8
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:02,916
between them were torn asunder.

9
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:08,041
Their dreams were ripped from
their hearts with a sword...

10
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:12,041
with their destiny
revealed at last.

11
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:17,791
Pardon me.

12
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,666
Tenzen-sama.

13
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:32,958
You summoned me, Ogen-sama.

14
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,291
Yes, Tenzen. I must ask you...

15
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,791
When the Oda made their
initial attack against us,

16
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,916
where in the battle were you?

17
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,083
I am ashamed to
say that I missed it.

18
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:47,791
The moment fighting commenced,

19
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:52,041
I received a single
gunshot wound and died.

20
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,583
I heard something Ogen-sama.

21
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:59,166
Apparrently, you missed
the perfect opportunity

22
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,541
to kill Kouga Danjo.

23
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,208
A pity. I assume that

24
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:07,333
taking such harsh
action proved too much.

25
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,125
You were deceived
by someone for whom

26
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,375
you held such strong feelings.

27
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,500
Even the boldest
of warriors could find

28
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:17,375
such a thing overwhelming.
But please do not consider this

29
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,083
a failure by any means.

30
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,750
Danjo being alive has
unified the Iga more than

31
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:24,000
his death ever could.

32
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,291
I take my leave of you.

33
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,541
Tenzen, please wait.

34
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,458
Forgive my weakness.

35
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:52,500
Ogen-sama. The
insults are over.

36
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:56,250
I will not allow the
past mistakes to be repeated.

37
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:02,791
Oboro-sama will be mine.
And Gennosuke...

38
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:06,083
I will bury him
with my own hands.

39
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:34,000
The sounds of
the wind are chilling.

40
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,041
Perhaps they bother
you because they are

41
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,958
actually curses
of the dead.

42
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,791
Tell me, Gennosuke-sama...

43
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:46,416
After the things
we heard tonight,

44
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,083
are you having
any second thoughts?

45
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,250
This cannot be stopped.

46
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:59,000
The bloodshed of both
Kouga and Iga will continue

47
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:01,833
until one is eradicated
from this world.

48
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:06,208
Only on that day
will this war end.

49
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,041
Where is Gennosuke-sama?

50
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:18,458
I asked him to get some rest and
stay out of sight for a while.

51
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,958
If the Iga are being
protected by the Tokugawa,

52
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:24,750
the tide will hasten
a turn in our direction.

53
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,500
But Gennosuke-sama
has made up his mind.

54
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,625
He said himself
that he is prepared to

55
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,958
kill Oboro and the Iga.

56
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,125
Even more reason to hide him.

57
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,791
We need our leader
to survive at all costs.

58
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,791
It is he who carries us.
We need him to follow through

59
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:44,166
with the goal that we
may be unable to complete.

60
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,666
Listen... Kagero.

61
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,750
The sun will always rise
and set. This is a constant.

62
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,291
But during the next few cycles,

63
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,875
how many more
lives will be lost?

64
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:01,791
I do not wish to appear
this way any more than

65
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,208
Gennosuke-sama wishes to hide.

66
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:07,833
But we do our part so those
in Kouga can live their lives.

67
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,833
Do you believe
we can win?

68
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:17,750
Be alert. We must
assure our guests' safety.

69
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:29,958
Oboro-sama!

70
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:32,583
No, you can't.
You must stay inside.

71
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:36,875
Akeginu, I am sorry,
but I wish to walk.

72
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:40,000
I want to feel the
earth beneath my feet.

73
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:43,416
I do not want to
forget this one thing.

74
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,375
That we are truly alive,
and part of the world.

75
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:51,875
Just what do you
think are you doing?!

76
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:55,250
Don't you realize the Kouga
could attack at any second.

77
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,458
You must exercise more caution.

78
00:07:57,541 --> 00:08:00,416
We're moving right now!
To your positions men!

79
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,916
Yes, sir.

80
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,875
She refused breakfast

81
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,000
and has not touched
the dinner before her.

82
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:26,666
Let her do as she pleases.
She need only survive until

83
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,583
the successorship
has been made official.

84
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,333
Halt, right there!

85
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,916
This inn houses a
important person who

86
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,500
enjoys their privacy.
There are no vacancies.

87
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:51,458
Interesting... Now what
important person would that be?

88
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,791
A vagrant like you
doesn't need to know.

89
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:57,250
Now get out of here
before I remove you myself!

90
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,750
What are you doing?!

91
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,500
We need help!

92
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,250
There's an intruder, men!

93
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,000
Tenzen-sama!

94
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,791
You're mistaken.
He's our ally.

95
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:52,291
I am sorry for the
confusion, Tenzen-sama.

96
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:55,291
But... these men
are merely vassals.

97
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:00,166
They're with Lady Ofuku,
who is the wetnurse for

98
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,375
Lord Takechiyo, the
Shogun's firstborn.

99
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:05,833
Their party came upon Oboro
and I when we found Koshiro.

100
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:08,000
Then she is in
line with the Shogun?

101
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:12,333
Please, Tenzen-sama.
Listen. We must tell her.

102
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:15,000
Explain it. Why we are here.

103
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:18,875
There is no time. I
have other pressing issues.

104
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,250
I have located a Kouga.

105
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:24,916
The woman who is known
to her people as Kagero.

106
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,458
I saw her at Imurebashi,
waiting, or so it seemed.

107
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,791
It is likely that the
ones for whom she is waiting

108
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:34,500
are none other than Kouga
Gennosuke and Kisaragi Saemon.

109
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,333
If you're going on
a hunt for Kouga blood,

110
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,958
we would like
to lend our support.

111
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,208
You would be wise to
leave war to the soldiers.

112
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,375
The fight that
rages is not yours.

113
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,625
The Kouga are much
too formidable an opponent

114
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,166
for the likes of you.

115
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:51,208
Do not forget that
we are Iga by birth.

116
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:52,750
Our pride would
never allow us to

117
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,833
have anyone hurt
our enemies but us.

118
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:04,333
If you did not know, Kagero
is the one who killed Koshiro.

119
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,250
Koshiro-dono...

120
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:13,291
But I saw him there. He
died while fighting Hyoma.

121
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,708
So you were to understand.
But from what I know

122
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,791
this Kagero woman
is a stealthy type,

123
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,708
who will gladly
steal a kiss from a man

124
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:22,708
just before turning
her breath into poison.

125
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:27,375
You didn't find any wounds
on Koshiro's body, did you?

126
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:32,125
This treacherous art
takes no effect on women.

127
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,708
So I'm afraid I must ask you--

128
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,291
Tenzen-sama!

129
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:40,666
You must wait for a moment
while I retrieve something.

130
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,625
We can't.

131
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,666
Oh, Tenzen-sama!

132
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:15,083
Akeginu. Is that
what I think it is?

133
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:18,083
Please forgive me! I
know that he is our enemy,

134
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:21,666
but to Oboro-sama,
he is the man she loves!

135
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,708
I didn't think it right to
send her into the world with

136
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,916
nothing to remember him by.

137
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,166
Think nothing of it.

138
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:40,583
I will allow this, but
we will speak no more of it.

139
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,833
This woman you call Ofuku,
is she prepared to use

140
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:03,583
all her resources to
kill the Kouga herself?

141
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,000
Yes.

142
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,708
Then she is a fool. The
succession is not something that

143
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:11,875
any Kouga or Iga would consider.
What exists between our people

144
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,458
is hatred and vengeance,
a drive to bring

145
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:17,083
this age-old feud to a close.

146
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,416
If any of us were to use
outsiders to bring about

147
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,041
victory, we would disgrace all
of those who died before us.

148
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,875
Their souls could
never rest in peace

149
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,208
after such an indiscretion.

150
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,750
I agree... I've felt that
way about this conflict since

151
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,791
I was just a young girl.

152
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:38,833
I want to ensure no Kouga
ever see the sun rise again.

153
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:44,708
This war... It is my war and it
will only end when they all die.

154
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,458
I wish, though, that
through these dark days

155
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:50,375
Oboro-sama would
not be without sight.

156
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:56,333
I worry for her. Her eyes...
She must make it to Sunpu.

157
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,875
They are a serious
problem for all our interests.

158
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,833
I don't much want to be
in a war between two clans.

159
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:10,458
But Lady Ofuku has ordered this.

160
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:49,208
This flute of Kouga Gennosuke...

161
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:52,875
You have had it with you
since last being in Tsubagakure?

162
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,458
Yes.

163
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:57,583
From what I've come to
understand, it was given to

164
00:14:57,666 --> 00:15:00,000
Oboro-sama as
a token of farewell

165
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,000
and remembrance from Gennosuke.

166
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,333
Then why do you keep it?

167
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:06,708
It is not your gift to
give and receive at will.

168
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:10,500
If it is Oboro-sama's,
then she should have it.

169
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:14,500
This flute might quell
the longing inside her.

170
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,541
It may do the opposite.

171
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,375
The human heart is
more difficult to understand

172
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:23,291
than anything. Especially
the heart of your enemy.

173
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:26,666
No matter how you may
meditate over the subject,

174
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,458
the answers simply do not come.

175
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:32,416
It is one of
the oldest mysteries.

176
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,250
Is something wrong?

177
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,208
Oh, it's nothing.

178
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:42,541
It's time. Are you ready?

179
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:44,583
Yes.

180
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:06,833
Where is Gennosuke?
He's not here to protect you?

181
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,583
I challenge you.

182
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,708
That's funny, because
I've been waiting for you...

183
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,375
Akeginu.

184
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,208
Die!

185
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:40,083
Ogen-sama, Rousai-dono,
Nenki-dono, Jingoro-dono,

186
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,291
Hotarubi, Yashamaru-dono!

187
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,083
This is for Koshiro!

188
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,625
You're dead!

189
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,541
Tenzen-sama!

190
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:43,208
Oboro will be
joining you very soon.

191
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,750
And I hope your blood
stains the road to hell,

192
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:49,083
leading her back to you.

193
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,291
The Kouga and the Iga...

194
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,458
We are all the same
in birth and in death.

195
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:40,500
All of us human, we need to
break these bindings of hatred

196
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,041
and revenge which hold us.

197
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:45,708
We need to open our eyes
to the other side. To the Iga.

198
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,041
Even if it is
only one of them,

199
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:51,583
then that one we will try
to know and better understand.

200
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:57,500
It is not possible. The time to
know the other side has passed.

201
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:03,291
It is time to finish...
this bloody war.

202
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:06,916
You did a very nice job gaining
her trust. I commend you.

203
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,625
Thank you.

204
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:12,416
Only one remains alive. Oboro.

205
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,000
If you don't mind, I would
like to be the one to kill her.

206
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,208
It would be my honor.

207
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,791
Perhaps you are unaware.

208
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,333
Oboro's eyes have been blinded.

209
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,541
Well, do you
think we should go?

210
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:30,125
Greetings men. Please forgive
me for my earlier rudeness.

211
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,875
I did not know you
were the Lady's vassals.

212
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,166
I was raised in a place
where niceties are seldom used,

213
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,708
so I ended up a bit
rough around the edges.

214
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:44,083
I hope you understand.

215
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:48,375
I do not see Akeginu.
Is she with you here?

216
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:53,000
No. She has gone.
Went Kouga hunting.

217
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,916
Specifically for
their leader Gennosuke.

218
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,250
She did? Where is he?

219
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:02,333
We know he was seriously
injured in a conflict.

220
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:06,208
All likelihood points to
him ending up dead on some road.

221
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:09,458
Akeginu went
searching just to be sure.

222
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,583
According to Akeginu-dono,

223
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:15,625
one Kouga woman also remained.

224
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,958
She said that this
woman is a crafty one

225
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,041
who goes by the name of Kagero.

226
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,750
I know this woman.

227
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:25,375
I have been holding
her captive for some time.

228
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,375
And what have
you done with her?

229
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,375
First I tied her up.

230
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:32,708
Then I went about
making her into a woman.

231
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,208
And the strangest
thing happened.

232
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:38,541
She now favors solely
the flesh of the Iga.

233
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:44,000
Interesting... Yes...
You are truly a warrior.

234
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:47,541
I should have known. Your
strength back at the Inn was

235
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:50,000
the first clue to your
greatness. We are all quite

236
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:53,708
fortunate to have such
staggering power on our side.

237
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:57,625
But there is something about you
that I am most overwhelmed by.

238
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,291
Akeginu-dono told us that

239
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:03,916
you have a great
ability, don't you?

240
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,750
She said no matter
how many wounds are

241
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:12,041
inflicted on your body,
you will never die.

242
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:16,625
She said that you
are an immortal ninja.

243
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,166
What?

244
00:23:56,625 --> 00:24:00,458
Tears for those lost
fall like blood from a blade.

245
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:03,208
Aware of deception,
a warrior's baited breath

246
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:05,750
hangs heavy in the air.
The flesh of those loved

247
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:08,250
and lost can
tempt like moth to flame,

248
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:10,500
as the fires of
passion burn brighter than

249
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,583
even those of revenge.

250
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:16,333
All roads lead to death,
but passion may prove

251
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:18,750
an even quicker
path to the end.

252
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:22,625
On the next Basilisk,
"With All Her Heart."
