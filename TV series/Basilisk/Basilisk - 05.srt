1
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:28,625
Two tribes sworn to hate...

2
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:32,333
Their bloodstained bodies
left out in the open to rot.

3
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:37,000
Their souls longing for a
peace that they failed to find.

4
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:39,500
As they sought to break
the shackles of darkness

5
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:42,250
and heal the
wounds of the past,

6
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:47,333
Fate denied their quest
and thrust them into war.

7
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:59,291
The bridges of
hope some dared to build

8
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:02,833
between them were torn asunder.

9
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:07,833
Their dreams were ripped from
their hearts with a sword...

10
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:11,833
with their destiny
revealed at last.

11
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,458
Gennosuke-sama's
in Tsubagakure?

12
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,291
The word came last
night. And apparently,

13
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,958
he'll be spending a few
days at Ogen-dono's Villa.

14
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,083
Can you pass the soup, please?

15
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,333
He's not alone, is he?

16
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:21,000
I believe Udono is with him.

17
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:23,583
I don't know if that
makes you feel any better...

18
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,666
I'm curious as
to how they met up.

19
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,125
Well, who knows with him?

20
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:30,291
He probably ran out of hot
air and fell out of the sky.

21
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:33,333
Mm, hmm... What?

22
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:37,875
I wanted to go! I've
never been to Tsubagakure!

23
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,875
Don't worry.
You'll get your chance.

24
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:42,333
There'll be plenty of
opportunities in the future.

25
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:44,666
That's the future!
What about the present?

26
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,083
What am I supposed to do?

27
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:49,625
What do you mean
"what are you supposed to do?"

28
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:52,541
I'm dying of boredom!

29
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:56,166
It's not fair, Saemon.

30
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,000
You men aren't allowed
to leave the compound.

31
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,583
You're like prisoners.

32
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:02,625
And it's all because of
that demonstration in Sunpu.

33
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:05,916
Even Jyubei got to go. I can't
even take a walk with him.

34
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,166
I beg your pardon...

35
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,375
When have you ever
taken a walk with Jyubei?

36
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,708
Please. Refresh my memory.

37
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,416
Well, what about Gyobu?!

38
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,416
He promised to
take me boar hunting!

39
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,708
Well, that's true. And I know
he was looking forward to it.

40
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,083
But duty first.
We must be vigilant

41
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:22,000
while Danjo-sama's gone.

42
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,250
You can wait longer.
You'll survive.

43
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,916
Hey! Why don't you
go boar hunting with

44
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,500
us when he gets back?!

45
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:31,916
Thanks. But I don't think
so. It sounds like fun.

46
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,666
But... I'd prefer
a nice relaxing day of

47
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,458
fishing to cleanse the soul.

48
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:39,416
Come on brother...
you could be our decoy!

49
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,750
You mean you would feed
me to a boar? Shame on you.

50
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:46,125
You should show your older
brother more respect than that.

51
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,333
Hmm!

52
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:57,583
Oh, by the way, Okoi. I have
a special request to ask of you.

53
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:08,041
I can't believe
this is happening.

54
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,750
How can he marry an Iga woman?

55
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,250
What a slap in
the face. It's not right.

56
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,500
 Stop. That's enough, Kagero.

57
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:18,458
Put your personal
interests aside for once.

58
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:21,375
Gennosuke-sama has thought
this through carefully...

59
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:24,083
with all of us in mind.
You may not accept it,

60
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,875
but it's the best
thing for our future.

61
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:31,583
Is it, Hyoma? I'm not
sure. It's nice talk but

62
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:32,958
it sounds like
you're still trying to

63
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,000
convince yourself of that.

64
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:39,625
Maybe so... But perhaps that
stems from my own weakness.

65
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,666
It's easy to cling
to old ways but what

66
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,875
Gennosuke-sama is
doing takes true courage.

67
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,166
I still think that he's wrong.

68
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,750
No one wants this
peace with the Iga.

69
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,541
There's no need
for this marriage.

70
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:57,583
I'm not even sure Gennosuke-sama
is in love with Oboro.

71
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,750
If he truly respected her
he wouldn't be meeting her

72
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,791
before a ceremony is even held.

73
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,416
What kind of woman
would consent to that?

74
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,208
We should kill
that little tramp!

75
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:11,958
Kagero! That's enough! We'll
have no more talk like that!

76
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,125
We will all support
Gennosuke-sama's

77
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,291
decision and that's final.

78
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:22,625
But still... That doesn't mean
we should blindly trust the Iga.

79
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:25,333
Jyubei saw ominous
signs for Danjo-sama

80
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:26,916
and he still hasn't returned.

81
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,416
Gennosuke-sama's safety
is as vital as our own breath.

82
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,541
Do you wish for me to go
and check on him at Tsubagakure?

83
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,416
There's no need, to worry.

84
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,208
I've already sent Okoi.

85
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:45,208
She should be on
her way there now.

86
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:49,291
A wise choice Saemon...
She'll attract less attention.

87
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,875
The Iga won't
be as wary of a woman.

88
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,000
True... And
Gennosuke-sama won't be

89
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:58,625
nearly as angry if Okoi
comes for him. He'd kill me.

90
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,625
Yes, my thoughts exactly.

91
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,583
Then we'll
wait for her return.

92
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:03,875
Hmm?

93
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,541
Someone's approaching!

94
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:15,666
They're Ninja Footsteps!
Coming from the North!

95
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,250
Sunpu is North. Maybe
it's Danjo-sama returning.

96
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:24,333
No... The head count
is different... Let's see...

97
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,708
There are five
and one is a woman.

98
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,833
I sense aggression
in their stride...

99
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,041
They are definitely not Kouga!

100
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,875
Have either of you
seen Udono this morning?

101
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:44,791
No, not this morning.
But I did see him last night.

102
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,500
I wasn't going to say anything.

103
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,625
But he paid several
imprudent visits to

104
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,291
my room late in the night.

105
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:51,333
He didn't?

106
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,625
What happened?

107
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:58,333
Akeginu! What is it?
Don't tell me you--

108
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:01,750
Oh, no. I promise
you that he's just fine.

109
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:02,791
But I'm afraid that perhaps

110
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:06,125
my rejection may
have been too harsh.

111
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,958
Too harsh? What
did you say to him?

112
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:13,875
Well, I... I called him a fat
pig and said he was repulsive.

113
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,041
It was awful...

114
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:19,166
He suddenly grew silent.
And that look on his face...

115
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,958
 Akeginu! That's terrible!

116
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,833
I thought you would be angry.

117
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:30,666
For what? We can't
blame Akeginu for

118
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,458
telling Udono that
she's not interested in him.

119
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,250
No, I guess not...

120
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:38,000
But she could have
told him in a nicer way.

121
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,958
Josuke's not one
to take subtle hints.

122
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:44,125
Trust me...
It was good for him.

123
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:47,625
Akeginu-dono, I am sorry that
he caused you so much trouble.

124
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:50,708
Please! Do not bow,
Gennosuke-sama!

125
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:53,291
Now that the mystery
is solved, I'd be honored if

126
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,958
you showed me
Ogen-dono's prized garden.

127
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,750
I'd love to.

128
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,041
Akeginu?

129
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,541
Yes!

130
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:08,125
Do you know if Tenzen and
the others have returned yet?

131
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:12,125
Uh, no. I don't
think so. Not yet.

132
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:15,291
That's strange.
Where could they have gone?

133
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:25,083
So many years have passed...

134
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,916
What a fine tree it has become.

135
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:29,833
Now!

136
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,208
Right!

137
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:39,625
Hmm!

138
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:56,625
One Kouga is dead...
He is but the first of many.

139
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:11,750
Move quickly.

140
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,458
It seems too quiet.

141
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,375
There's no need for concern...

142
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,500
We are merely
humble couriers sent to

143
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,500
deliver a message
from Gennosuke.

144
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:58,291
Yes I like it, excellent plan.

145
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,291
Since we know the
names of the Kouga Ten

146
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,166
it might be possible
to lure them out.

147
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,833
We can say that the
message we have is for them.

148
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,041
Hmm.

149
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,833
Let's go.

150
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,583
This fog will
work to our advantage.

151
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,000
Yes! It will provide
the perfect cover!

152
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:32,583
Let us slay the Kouga
Ten before it clears!

153
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:35,791
Let's not take
unnecessary chances...

154
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:39,125
Kazamachi was a
formidable opponent alone.

155
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,666
What is it, Koshiro?!

156
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,625
Someone's here.

157
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,541
Rousai! What the
hell is happening to you?

158
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,916
Damn!

159
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,250
Rousai! What are you doing?

160
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,625
 That wall! It spoke to me!

161
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:18,333
It said there are no secrets
from the walls of Manjidani!

162
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:35,583
Alert! Intruders! Intruders
have entered Manjidani!

163
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,208
Damn it!

164
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:29,375
Please wait... You're
making a big mistake...

165
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,541
Our presence
here is peaceful...

166
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:35,583
We come from Tsubagakure bearing
a message from Gennosuke-sama.

167
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:42,250
Fool! Do you really think we're
going to fall for that trick?

168
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:45,583
Tell us friend. If you
were sent from Tsubagakure,

169
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,750
why did you come
in from the North?

170
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,291
And if you're
really messengers...

171
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:53,583
then why were you
masking your words?

172
00:13:57,541 --> 00:14:00,875
Don't let them
get away! Attack!

173
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,125
Prepare yourselves!

174
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,458
Go! Show no mercy!

175
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,000
Hmm!

176
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:36,666
You've felt the wrath
of my Cyclone Death Song.

177
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,666
Now, which one of
you Kougas is next?

178
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:19,666
I never fall for
the same trick twice.

179
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,083
Huh?!

180
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,083
Tenzen-sama!

181
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,916
You must stand firm!

182
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,416
Those who dare to attack
Manjidani must pay the price!

183
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,416
Mark my words, Iga.

184
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,000
You won't leave here alive.

185
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:34,416
Is that so?

186
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,458
Hmm!

187
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,500
Let's get them!

188
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,125
Gyobu! That's enough!

189
00:17:56,041 --> 00:18:00,083
You there, Iga! Tell me,
what sort of madness is this?

190
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:03,666
I can assure you, any
madness lies with you Kougas.

191
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,125
This is our first
time to Manjidani.

192
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,875
Is this how you
receive your visitors?

193
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:13,291
We detain only
those who act suspicious.

194
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,041
Surely, you
can understand that.

195
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:18,375
We've done nothing since we
arrived but defend ourselves!

196
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:25,750
You gave us no choice...
I believe this belongs to you.

197
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:43,416
Be gone! You have
no business in this place.

198
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,583
It's quite clear to us
now how you Kouga operate.

199
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:49,166
If you and your Kouga Ninjas
should ever pay a visit to

200
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,125
Tsubagakure you
will be embraced with

201
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:54,041
the same greeting
we've received here.

202
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:58,416
Only you won't walk
away to tell about it!

203
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:16,416
Damn you!

204
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,833
Gyobu!

205
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,416
Arise, arise,
my sleeping flies.

206
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,750
Flit and flutter,
before their eyes.

207
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,250
Blind our foe,
I know they doubt.

208
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,875
You are our shield,
now spread throughout.

209
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,333
Conceal us with
your florid light.

210
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:33,791
Now swarm, you must,
disguise our flight.

211
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,375
Gennosuke-sama...

212
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,375
Who's there?!

213
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:20,083
He must be an Iga...
What are you doing here?!

214
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,291
Stop!

215
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,375
He's good!

216
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,208
Damn! I missed him!

217
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:37,541
Oboro-dono?

218
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:38,625
What is it?

219
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:40,083
I need a favor...

220
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:43,666
Would you send a messenger
to Manjidani for me please?

221
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:48,166
It's not like Josuke
to leave suddenly...

222
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,208
I'm worried about him.

223
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:02,458
I just want to be certain
that he returned safely.

224
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:06,541
I pray that my
fears are unfounded.

225
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,666
Of course...
Consider, it done.

226
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,083
Thank you.

227
00:23:56,541 --> 00:24:00,750
The darkness pervading the
sky seeps into the souls of men.

228
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:04,375
As pounding rain falls,
fervent prayers rise...

229
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:07,958
Sinister hearts, plagued
with heinous desires long for

230
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:12,125
the pure and forbidden fruit.
The innocent shall be defiled,

231
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:14,583
and another life will be lost.

232
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:17,041
The truth struggles
to find illumination

233
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:19,375
but the sun
withholds its light.

234
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:23,166
On the next Basilisk,
"Longing in the Rain."
