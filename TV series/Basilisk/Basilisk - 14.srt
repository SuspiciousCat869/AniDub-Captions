1
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:28,708
Two tribes sworn to hate...

2
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:32,416
Their bloodstained bodies
left out in the open to rot.

3
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,208
Their souls longing for a
peace that they failed to find.

4
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:39,541
As they sought to break
the shackles of darkness

5
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:42,250
and heal the
wounds of the past,

6
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:47,333
Fate denied their quest
and thrust them into war.

7
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:59,333
The bridges of
hope some dared to build

8
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:02,875
between them were torn asunder.

9
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:07,916
Their dreams were ripped from
their hearts with a sword ...

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,916
with their destiny
revealed at last.

11
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:15,375
You seem troubled.
What weighs on your mind?

12
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:18,041
Words that I heard
spoken so long ago from

13
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,958
a person I trusted
above many others.

14
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:24,125
"The Kouga and the Iga. Were
they to only know each other,

15
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,958
the road to peace
would open before them."

16
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,125
Those words...

17
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:31,791
Dono...

18
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,916
Those words
I must ignore.

19
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,625
For I must shed blood
to expose the wrongdoings.

20
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:52,166
This is how we will know
each other during these times.

21
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,458
No other reasonable path exists.

22
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,458
I see a time when you
and I could stand together

23
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:25,125
and feel the breeze
across our face.

24
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,625
A time when our
dreams were the same.

25
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:31,458
Of the same place.
Of the same feelings.

26
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:36,208
Sometimes this thought crosses
my mind when I least expect it.

27
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:40,666
This thought is that you
and I were once a single soul.

28
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,791
One soul split into
two equal parts,

29
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:45,791
which now longs
to be together again.

30
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:50,125
I feel this as truly as I
feel the rain in the spring or

31
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:53,041
the love for
all of my ancestors.

32
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:00,375
And that is why... That is why
I feel so strongly toward you.

33
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,916
Please forgive me saying
something so foolish.

34
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,750
Oboro-dono...

35
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:14,291
If we are indeed one soul,
we will bond without fail.

36
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:17,458
Gennosuke-sama,
you believe me?

37
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:29,666
Such a journey may
take a thousand lifetimes.

38
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,625
Across the vast
expanse of as many worlds.

39
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:37,083
But... It will happen.

40
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,500
You should know...
I understand why you

41
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:00,625
felt the need to turn your
back to me the other night.

42
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:06,166
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have.

43
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:14,750
Oboro-dono... Will you
close your eyes for me?

44
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,916
Oh... Yes.

45
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,541
Oboro-sama...

46
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,166
Koshiro. What is it?

47
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,625
Tenzen-sama. He wishes
to speak with you.

48
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:24,000
Sorry for staring
but that's great!

49
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,250
What's he doing?

50
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:42,541
Son?!

51
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,000
Hey, father, look!

52
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,666
You've gotta see this
guy's wood carvings!

53
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:51,333
Sorry to bother you. He's a
just bit curious. Let's go, son.

54
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:01,208
Thanks, mister!

55
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:14,958
Oboro-sama...

56
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,583
You said you could
not fight Gennosuke.

57
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:19,583
That it went against
everything you felt inside.

58
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,000
Do those emotions
still keep you twisted?

59
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,541
Or will you fight
when the time comes?

60
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:28,041
No matter what I feel, my lack
of vision renders me useless.

61
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:31,625
True... but only
for seven nights.

62
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:36,083
Two nights have passed since
then. After only five more,

63
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,500
your vision will return
and at that moment you will

64
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:41,333
need to make an
important decision.

65
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,291
I can foresee my destiny.

66
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:47,625
Within five days, I shall
die by Gennosuke-sama's hand.

67
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,916
Just as I suspected.

68
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,291
You still have that
Kouga sickness in your head.

69
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,541
I'm disappointed in you.

70
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:58,666
Tenzen... are you
going to kill me?

71
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,375
No...

72
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:04,541
I'll make you live.
Despite yourself.

73
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,083
Tenzen!

74
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:13,708
I am going to put the spirit
of life back into you myself...

75
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,625
The Iga spirit...

76
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:21,333
The... Spirit? How?

77
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:25,583
Oboro-sama, I am going to take
you and make you my wife.

78
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,416
No.

79
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:31,541
No!

80
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:40,333
Tenzen! You've lost your
mind! Stop.

81
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:41,833
Calm yourself.

82
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:45,250
You will forget all about
Gennosuke when I'm done.

83
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:52,916
You must accept him for what
he is. There is no other way.

84
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,375
Now, give yourself over to me.

85
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,416
No!

86
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:18,291
Tenzen, get off me!

87
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,375
This must happen.
It is far more noble than

88
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:24,041
your undying
love for our enemy.

89
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,750
You were raised to be the
next leader of the Iga people.

90
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:30,083
If we are to ensure our
bloodline into the future,

91
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,708
then you must
take a worthy husband.

92
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,041
Of the ten Iga ninjas
selected by your grandmother,

93
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:40,375
only three men remain.
Jingoro, Koshiro, and myself.

94
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:41,791
Who will it be?

95
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,416
Which one of us would
you have as your husband?

96
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,125
None!

97
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,958
Don't do this! Just kill me!

98
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:53,333
Never! How could I slay the
pillar of the Iga's future?

99
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,791
You must live! And
so shall your children!

100
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:58,541
Akeginu! Koshiro! Jingoro!

101
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,625
No one will help you!

102
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:03,833
They all know exactly
what is going on in here.

103
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,750
These breasts have gone
untouched by Gennosuke,

104
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,875
but I can feel them
growing warm under my touch.

105
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:14,625
I can feel their longing.

106
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,083
Seducing a woman is
an ancient ninja technique

107
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:20,333
much older than any
of our other practices.

108
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,500
And I am very skilled.

109
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,750
No!

110
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:44,958
Tenzen-sama... this is wrong...
you must turn back...

111
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,583
How could you?
How could you do this?

112
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:48,833
No!

113
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:53,833
Tenzen-sama, you must
stop. Please. Stop this.

114
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,708
Something is happening outside.

115
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,625
So? I'm not going out there.

116
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:16,166
Besides, shouldn't we be
docking in Miya real soon?

117
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,750
We haven't even been
on the water an hour.

118
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,291
Have some patience.

119
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,041
Little froggy, little
froggy, use those legs

120
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,625
and fly high into the sky!

121
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:52,666
Nice move kid.

122
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,666
You should have
a great future, my boy.

123
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:09,041
Oh why? Why does the ocean
water have to be so salty?!

124
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,208
I mean...
it doesn't make sense...

125
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,333
Jingoro-dono?

126
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,083
What is it?

127
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,791
A wooden frog.

128
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,375
I was scared by that?

129
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:44,583
I think you may have dropped
something. Here you go.

130
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,208
What are you looking for?

131
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,000
Someone's missing.

132
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,291
What?

133
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,708
There's one less person in here.

134
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,541
We should take a look around.

135
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:17,666
Very well, but
we do this quietly.

136
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,708
Wait! Don't go!

137
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,583
Do you want to do this or not?

138
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:30,541
Fine... I'll...
I'll go out there with you!

139
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,916
No!

140
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,000
Tenzen-sama is my master.

141
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:46,041
I should rejoice that he
and Oboro-sama would marry.

142
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:49,041
But not like this. Even
though I want him to stop,

143
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,916
I cannot defy him.

144
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,375
But Oboro-sama is
my master above him.

145
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:56,291
She is the leader of
the Iga, and Tenzen-sama is

146
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,041
prepared to violate
all of her wishes.

147
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,166
No!

148
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:14,958
Oboro-sama, I am sorry.
I don't know what to do.

149
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:18,750
Akeginu! Jingoro!

150
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:27,708
My... princess... No...

151
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,958
Koshiro.

152
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,291
Koshiro.

153
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,541
Koshiro!

154
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,666
No... I can't!

155
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,500
Koshiro!

156
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,208
No!

157
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,500
Princess...

158
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:07,958
Koshirooooo!

159
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:14,666
No. Tenzen-sama!
Stop this! Tenzen-sama!

160
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,625
Tenzen-sama...

161
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:57,833
Oboro-sama...

162
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,291
Ko... Koshiro?

163
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:08,833
He... He tried to...

164
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,833
What? What is this?

165
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:20,291
Is he dead, Koshiro?

166
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:23,750
Did you do this
to him? Did you?

167
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:26,708
No. I thought
that you saved me.

168
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,083
Tenzen!

169
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,625
Oboro-sama!

170
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:51,125
Akeginu...
Please... Help us...

171
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,000
What happened to Tenzen?!

172
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:10,041
I know the man who did this.

173
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,958
He's on the boat.

174
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:18,041
We have to
find him. He's here.

175
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,541
Who are you talking about?

176
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,916
Jingoro-dono...

177
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,458
Where are you going?!

178
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:55,916
You stay here.

179
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,916
Protect Oboro-sama at all costs.

180
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,625
Where are you?! Show yourself!

181
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,541
You're a dead man!

182
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,500
There you are!

183
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:35,666
Get out here you coward!

184
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,250
Have you lost it?!
Put that sword away!

185
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,250
I know you're here!

186
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:51,666
Show yourself...

187
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,750
Gyobu, it is you!

188
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:06,041
You wanted me to show
myself. Well here I am!

189
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,500
Jingoro-dono!

190
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,958
Man overboard. Port!

191
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,500
Where did he go?!

192
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:39,666
Help me! The salt water!
Get me out of here!

193
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,416
What... What's
the matter with him?

194
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:47,625
No! You can't die now!

195
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:52,541
Akeginu-dono...

196
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:09,000
Jingoro-dono!

197
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,833
I'm coming for you!

198
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:24,583
No... No...

199
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:39,000
Jingoro-dono...

200
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,708
Impossible.

201
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:59,708
Across the sea a
ship sails toward death.

202
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:02,958
While one man passes
on, another is reborn,

203
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:06,583
and the coming battle
is staged in subterfuge.

204
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:10,083
As a young boy trains in the
art of stealth, the caveat of

205
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:13,958
hesitation to a father's
son will be a seated omen.

206
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:18,500
And the end, by its very nature,
is one of startling abruptness.

207
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:22,333
On the next Basilisk,
"Reckoning."
