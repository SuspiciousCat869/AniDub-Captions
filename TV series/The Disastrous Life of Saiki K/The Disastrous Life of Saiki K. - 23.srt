[NENDOU]
For me to be your lackey,

598
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,666
you'd have to buy me
at least 100 ramen.

599
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,375
[METORI]
This could buy that easily!

600
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,791
[NENDOU] Really? You can eat
that much on this kind of cash?

601
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:15,750
[METORI] This is 150 million
yen we're talking about.

Nendou has no concept of money.

Are you going to agree

Yeah, sure.
Give that case to me.

Once he understood its value,

608
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,833
he sure changed his tune.

609
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,041
Well, that settles it.

Hey, kid!
Can you hear me?

Here! Hold on to this!

Don't move, okay?

What the--? Seriously?

616
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,750
He gave up all that money
just to rescue a kid?

617
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:45,333
Guess he didn't understand
how much it was worth after all.

618
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:46,583
No, he knew.

00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,083
He sacrificed it,
despite knowing.

And all for some kid
he's never even met.

There's no way an aluminum case

is buoyant enough
to keep a child afloat.

[NENDOU] Of course, now I
gotta become Saiko's lackey.

[SAIKI] I don't think you
have to worry about that.
