00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:35,333
How about we draw straws?
[SAIKI] Where'd you get those?

151
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:36,625
If you have the same length,

152
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,500
you pair up, and short
straw goes out alone.

153
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,291
Sure. Sounds like a fair way
to decide

154
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:41,791
[TORITSUKA]
Saiki, you pick first.

155
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,166
Please help a brother out
and take the short one.

156
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,416
[SAIKI] I hate doing
what Toritsuka says,

157
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,583
but I would rather be alone.

158
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:48,666
[TORITSUKA]
You're up, Arisu.

159
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,125
Oh. You got the medium one.

160
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,375
Guys, I wonder
which straw Chiyo will pick.

161
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:53,666
Middle one. The middle one.

162
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,666
Let's see, which one.
Middle, got it.

163
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,708
[SAIKI] Stop using telepathy.
You're scaring me.

164
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,875
[YUMEHARA] Oh, I got a long one.
[SAIKI] What a farce.

165
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,666
Okay. I'll pick next.
Hey, hang on.

166
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,916
[TORITSUKA] All I have to do is
pick the medium one and she's--

167
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,666
Long one? How. Aah!

168
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,000
[SAIKI] You started to annoy me.
I turned back time on them.

169
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,458
[TORITSUKA] Saiki!
[SAIKI] Sorry.

170
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,958
[both moaning]

171
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,708
[YUMEHARA]
God, he's so creepy.

172
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,833
And what am I even doing here?
It's summer.

173
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,416
I should be at the beach, not in
a forest full of murder ghosts.

174
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,833
Whoa, watch out. You've gotta be
careful with every step here.

175
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:22,958
Oh, thank you.

176
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,541
Well, let's go get this
over with.

177
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,833
Hey, how come none of this
scares you?

178
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:29,583
I told you guys,
I was born in that temple.

179
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,583
[YUMEHARA] What's throbbing?
I don't love him, do I?

180
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:35,041
But I kind of like how strong
and decisive he is.

181
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,291
Hey, wait for me.

182
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,708
[SAIKI]
Now she likes Toritsuka?

183
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,083
She hops from one crush
to another too easily.

184
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,375
Too bad for her,

185
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,291
he still has his own weird crush
on Arisu.

186
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:44,791
[TORITSUKA]
Ah. Arisu.

187
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:46,791
Huh?

188
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,375
Will you hold my hand?
I'm so nervous.

189
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:49,583
[TORITSUKA]
What is this throbbing?

190
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,041
[SAIKI]
We're not that kind of anime.

191
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:54,250
[TORITSUKA] I can't like her.
I want Arisu.

192
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,625
Ugh. Who is that?

193
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,041
[SAIKI]
The fog has lifted.

194
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,208
Let's go.
Sure.

195
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,875
[SAIKI] The scariest thing
in these woods

196
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,041
is how quickly desperate
teenagers hook up.

197
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,208
You're not scared at all?

198
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:05,041
Don't worry, I'll protect you.

199
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,750
Aah! A wild boar!

200
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:10,916
Thankfully, my Reita is fearless
and ready to protect me. What?

201
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,125
[SAIKI] Kaidou ended up
being the one to save Yumehara,

202
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,000
so her feelings
for Toritsuka disappeared.

203
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,208
[KAIDOU] Are you okay, Yumehara?
[SAIKI] The end.

204
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:19,458
[HAIRO] These are my bros,
Nendou and Saiki!

205
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,375
They're joining on short notice.
Don't go too hard on them.

206
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,750
If you wanna know anything,
you can just ask me.

207
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,041
[SAIKI]
Huh. He invited Nendou.

208
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,708
[COACH]
Less standing, more serving!

209
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:28,916
Sorry about that, coach.

210
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,583
I was just introducing
my friends.

211
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:33,750
I take it this is the gifted man
you told me about,

212
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,125
who will lead Japan back
to the top of the tennis world?

213
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,333
[SAIKI]
That's too much.

214
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,000
Hmph.
He looks a bit raw to me.

215
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,500
Give me 50 laps
around the court!

216
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,125
[SAIKI]
He's demanding.

217
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,333
Fifty? Are you sure?

218
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,666
If you got a problem,
then quit.

219
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,583
I think you're going
way too easy on us

220
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:48,791
before the tournament.

221
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,708
Let's do 100!
[SAIKI] Let's not.

222
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,916
I'll raise you to 105.
[HAIRO] Yes, sir.

223
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,041
[SAIKI]
Don't indulge him.

224
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,125

Let's see some hustle!

225
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,250
Bad return!
[grunts]

226
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,375
All right, who's up now?

227
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,375
Uh... Me.

228
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:00,458
[COACH]
Hmph. Goodie.

229
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,416
Return this! Ha!

[grunts]

231
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,875
[COACH] Wha--?
His speed and flexibility

232
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:09,125
are incredible.
But can he hit these?

233
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,125
[Nendou grunting]
[COACH] No! He's getting it!

234
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,083
But there's not enough time
to get the second,

235
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,125
[Nendou laughing]
[COACH] What? This one too.

236
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,291
His movements are inhuman.
[Nendou laughing]

237
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:18,666
[COACH]
This boy is an ogre.

238
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,833
I wonder
if his friend is too?

239
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,000
[SAIKI]
I'm not special.

240
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:22,583
So, what do you think
of them?

241
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:23,583
Play a match with your friend.

242
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,208
What, right now?

243
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,875
He might just lead Japan back
to the top of the tennis world.

244
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,833
I told you that. That may be,
but he's got a lot to learn.

245
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,583
Did you know you're supposed
to hit the balls

00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:35,333
with this net thing? All this
time I've been whacking them

Heh.

to join the club.
This match confirms everything

I already thought earlier.
