Why would your dad
deprive you like that?

Well, my dad's dead.

"Indubitably"?

309
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,375
Well, time for me to
go converse with the heavens.

310
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,541
[SAIKI]
So you do believe there's a god?

311
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,333
[KURUMI] Kaidou seems
like a good kid.

312
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,833
[KUNIHARU] Yeah, he does. Even
if he is dragging his scarf.

313
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,875
[SAIKI] You guys have
such low standards.

314
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,375
[KAIDOU] Saiki's parents are
a bit on the strange side,

315
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,708
but I guess
they seem nice enough.

316
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,833
Please let me have
more friends this year.

317
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,875
[SAIKI]
You too, huh?

318
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,125
[Kaidou laughs]

319
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:16,250
I didn't expect to engage
in a battle with God today.

320
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,333
[SAIKI]
Why did you bow so low?

321
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,666
[KURUMI] So what was
your prayer about, Kaidou?

322
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,583
[KAIDOU] Well, it's
a secret. Indubitably!

323
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,000

Sounds like you decided

324

to kind of play
your character part-time.

325
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,291
Now you really sound weird.

--[HAIRO] What's up, Kaidou?
--[KAIDOU] Huh?

327
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,875
Oh, wow. Saiki's here too?

328
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,208
How you doing?
Happy New Year, guys.

329
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:34,500
[SAIKI]
What are you wearing?

330
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:35,791
[KAIDOU]
If he's here,

331
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,375
does that mean
my prayer was heard?

332
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:38,708
Oh. Uh, thanks.

333
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,333
You do the shrine thing?

334
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:44,166
To be honest, I-- Saiki,
who are these people with you?

335
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,250
[SAIKI]
Ugh.

00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,625
[HAIRO]
Oh, you're his parents!

337
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,583
Good to meet ya! An honor.

338
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,916
Kusuo may have mentioned that
I'm the class three rep.

339
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,583
Name's Kineshi Hairo.

340
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,791
Your son is always quick to help
me out at school.

341
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,458
[KUNIHARU &amp; KURUMI]
He's a good kid!

342
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,791
[KURUMI] And Hairo is such
a well-mannered young man.

343
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,541
[SAIKI] Who dresses
like he's at the gym.

344
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:04,208
To think that my little
Kusuo has so many nice friends!

345
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,125
Your mother is
just so very happy!

346
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,583
Yeah. You've turned into
Mister Charisma, son!

347
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:11,291
[SAIKI] They're not my friends,
they all just follow me around.

348
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,875
Although, I am curious
to hear what he's praying for.

349
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,333
[HAIRO] A friend and rival who
will get on the court with me

350
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:18,875
and push me
to become a stronger man.

351
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,875
That's what I need
in my life.

352
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,541
[SAIKI] That's a
passionate request.

353
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,000
So, Hairo,
what did you pray for?

354
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,666
Ha-ha-ha. It's a secret.

355
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,666
[SAIKI] What is the deal
with everyone praying

356
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,708
at the shrine for more friends?

at the shrine today?

[KUNIHARU]
Nendou?

[NENDOU] Oh! Hey,
buddy's mom and dad!

[HAIRO]
Is-- Is it possible?

362
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:41,666
The man destined to become
my rival is Nendou?

363
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,958
Nendou! Do you play tennis?

364
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:47,000
[NENDOU] Never! But I'm
probably pretty amazing at it!

365
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,333
[SAIKI] Does make me wonder
why so many of their prayers

366
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,625
are getting answered today.
Oh, well.

367
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,875
Probably just a coincidence,
because my prayer,

368
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,958
to be left alone,
hasn't been answered at all.

♪

370
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,041
So, Nendou,
have you prayed yet?

371
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,250
Oh, you mean like
ringing that big bell?

372

Sure, I'll do it.

373

[SAIKI] Ugh. Now he's going?
I hope for all our sakes

374
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,750
that Nendou doesn't
pray for anything weird.

Unh. All right! Ha-ha-ha-ha.

Okay, now it's time for ramen!

What was that about?

379

Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
Nendou, you're funny.

380
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,250
You only rang the bell once.

381
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,666
I'll show you how
to do the whole ritual.

382
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,708
[KUNIHARU] First, you
throw the money in there.

383
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:35,375
Then, you ring the bell.

384
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,541
After ringing the bell,
you have to bow twice. And then

385
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:41,125
you clap your hands twice,
like this, and say a prayer.

386
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,750
[KUNIHARU] I hope Kusuo
finds a girlfriend next!

just ask for?

I must be hearing things.
Even if he did say it,

and this was all real,

00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:52,208
he already prayed once before.
No way it'll happen.

Is that who I think it is?

At least it's finally quiet.

I was talking about.

When I erase a memory,
a blank space appears.

550
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,958
And when that happens, the
brain's natural repair mechanism

kicks in and fills that void
with a different memory.
