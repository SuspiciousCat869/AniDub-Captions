What does he want now?

Sorry about before.

Huh?

00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,583
I was so forward
and I didn't take

your feelings
into consideration.

Huh?

[SAIKI] I don't know if it's
'cause Rentarou's that nice,

I thought that you weren't
such a bad guy after all, but...

I won't be making
