1
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:45,583
[SAIKI] Ah, phys ed.
My least favorite class.

2
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:47,291
Don't get me wrong.
I'm good at sports.

3
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:49,666
Like, medal-in-just-
about-any-event good.

4
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,416
But that's exactly why...

5
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:55,041
[BOY STUDENT A]
What the hell was that?

6
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:56,625
[BOY STUDENT B]
Was that a meteor?

7
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:58,750
[SAIKI] ...it's so hard for me
to play at a normal human level.

8
00:01:58,833 --> 00:01:59,958
[MATSUZAKI]
All right, losers, listen up!

9
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:01,250
We're playing dodge ball!

10
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:02,416
Dodge ball in high school?

11
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,958
Aw, what about soccer?

12
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,875
Hey, quit complaining! Let's
give it everything we've got!

13
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:09,666
So what if it's childish? It'll
be fun to relive our youth!

14
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,708
Let's go out there and
dodge till we drop! Eh?

15
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:16,458
Well, if Hairo really
wants us to, then I guess.

16
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:18,208
Yeah, we gotta give
it a shot, right?

17
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:20,875
[SAIKI] That's Kineshi Hairo,
our class rep.

18
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:23,791
He's a little too relentlessly
gung-ho for my taste.

19
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:25,875
But the rest of the class
seems to respect him.

20
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:27,500
[HAIRO] Okay, who wants
to be on my team?

21
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,625
[MATSUZAKI] We'll decide
teams with rock-paper!

22
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:32,000
[HAIRO] All right!
We're gonna win this thing!

23
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,166
Yeah!

24
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,875
[SAIKI]
I'm on Hairo's team.

25
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:36,208
Beats the alternative.

26
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:38,375
[NENDOU chuckles]

27
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,250
[MATSUZAKI]
We'll start with a jump ball.

28
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,541
[SAIKI] And with that.
The game is on.

29
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:46,000
[yelling]

30
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,333
--Yeah!
--We got one out!

31
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:48,916
We got one out!

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,458
[SAIKI] Getting one player out
is worth that much excitement?

33
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:52,416
And how is he sweating
that much already?

34
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,583
We just started.

35
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,916
All right, guys,
we got the ball this time.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,916
Hey there, Saiki.

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,208
We're takin' you first!

38
00:02:58,291 --> 00:02:59,375
[SAIKI]
Already?

39
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,666
[SAIKI]
Might as well go with it.

40
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,666
Dude, are you okay?

41
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,125
[SAIKI sighs]

42
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:08,666
[SAIKI] Least I can sit out
the rest of the game now.

43
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,125
The more time I spend
on the bench, the better.

44
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,791
[HAIRO]
Hold it, Saiki!

45
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,291
Were you actually trying
to get hit by that ball?

46
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:18,083
[SAIKI]
Guess I made it too obvious.

47
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,750
[HAIRO]
For real? Well...

48
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,041
Hey, where you going?
You're not out.

49
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,333
Face-safe rule. Hmph.

50
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:27,958
[SAIKI]
Seriously, that's the rule?

51
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,916
Great. And now I've
gotta throw the ball?

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,500
This is ridiculous.

53
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:32,791
Throwing balls is where I have

54
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,250
the most trouble
masking my power.

55
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,333
Saiki! Give it all you got!

56
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,458
[SAIKI]
I'd rather not do that.

57
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,416
You say it like
it's no big deal,

58
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,916
but if I really
gave it all I've got,

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,416
somebody'd wind up dead!

60
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,583
Forget the face-safe rule.

61
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,583
They won't have a face anymore!

62
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:53,291
I'll try my best to throw it
weakly, but just in case...

63
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:55,291
...I'll aim for Nendou.

64
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:56,375
Uh.

65
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:57,125
[NENDOU]
Huh?

66
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,416
[SAIKI]
Too weak, maybe?

67
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,666
What the heck kinda
wussy-ass throw was that?

68
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,208
This isn't a game,
kid, it's serious!

69
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,625
Put some heart into it!

70
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,250
[SAIKI]
'Kay, I get it. Calm down.

71
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,750
Hey now, buddy, thanks
for goin' easy on your boy,

72
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:09,833
but right now, we're
s'posed to be enemies.

73
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,166
Did you really go easy on
him 'cause he's your friend?

74
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,500
[SAIKI]
No part of that is true.

75
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,041
All right!

76
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,208
Heh, they don't call me "Nen
the Dodgeballer" for nothing!

77
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:21,250
Take that! And that!
Bam! Boo-yah! Twofer!

78
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,250
[KIJIMA] Whoa, he took
out six players at once!

79
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,583
[BOY STUDENT G] The Paper
Team's only got two guys left!

80
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:26,666
[HAIRO growls]

81
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,666
Obviously gotta
save my pal for last.

82
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,666
Which makes you my
next target, captain!

83
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,166
Dodge ball!

84
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,000
[screaming]

85
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,458
[HAIRO]
I'll catch it!

86
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,291
For my brave teammates
who sacrificed themselves,

87
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,541
I'll catch it even
if it kills me!

88
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:44,125
[BOY STUDENTS]
Whoa. Saiki?

89
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,041
[SAIKI]
I should go out before you.

90
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:49,375
Sorry I couldn't play harder,
Hairo, but I've got my reasons.

91
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:50,875
Hey, don't give up now!

92
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:54,791
We're still in this! Let's go!

93
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:56,833
[KASHIMURA]
Whoa! Look!

94
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:58,375
[UKAI]
He caught the ball!

95
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,666
[BOY STUDENT H]
He saved Saiki's butt!

96
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,000
[SAIKI]
You've gotta be kidding me.

97
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,083
[YUASA]
Oh, no! Hairo's knee is busted!

98
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:07,208
[UKAI] That means Saiki's the
only one left on Team Paper!

99
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,208
[SAIKI]
You have got to be kidding me.

100
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,500
[HAIRO]
Looks like this is it for me.

101
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,125
[SAIKI]
Don't you give up!

102
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,083
[HAIRO]
I entrust this ball to you.

103
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,458
I know that you're
hiding something, Saiki.

104
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:20,625
You've got a power deep inside
you that you're not using.

105
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,625
What's stopping you?

106
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:23,791
Now's the time!

107
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,958
I wanna see you let
loose and unleash--

108
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:28,000
[SAIKI] You do realize you
only scraped your knee, right?

109
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,500
[HAIRO]
Help us, Saiki.

110
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,041
You're our only hope.

111
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,916
[HAIRO retches]

112
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,250
Yo, Saiki. I believe in you!

113
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,791
[BOY STUDENT I]
We're counting on you, Saiki!

114
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:37,875
[KIJIMA]
Kick their butts, Saiki!

115
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,791
[SAIKI]
You have got to be kidding me.

116
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:48,708
[SAIKI]
There's nothing I hate more

117
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:51,166
than being the
center of attention.

118
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,125
And yet here I am,
all eyes on me.

119
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,833
So what do I do now?

120
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:58,125
Looks like Saiki's found himself
in a difficult spot here.

121
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:58,916
Uh-huh.

122
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,500
Saiki's on the Paper Team,

123
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:01,625
which originally had the upper
hand when they started playing,

124
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:02,958
thanks to Hairo's killer
opening attack,

125
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:04,291
but then Nendou took out
six players with one shot.

126
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,625
Then while trying to save
Saiki from getting out,

127
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:06,875
Hairo got hurt and was
forced to leave the game.

128
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:07,916
So now Saiki's the only
one left on Paper Team!

129
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,125
That's right.

130
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,458
[SAIKI] Wow, thanks
for that detailed recap.

131
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,333
Though what makes this
situation difficult for me

132
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,083
isn't that I'm one
man against seven.

133
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:17,166
Not to brag, but winning
this would be a breeze.

134
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,041
Problem is, if I do,
my likability will skyrocket,

135
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:23,291
and everyone's gonna be
watching me 24/7, which sucks.

136
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,416
On the other hand,
if I throw the game and lose,

137
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,333
I'll be about as
popular as a stinkbug.

138
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:31,250
In which case, I'll attract the
merciless attention of bullies.

139
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,625
Either way,
I'm in the spotlight,

140
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:35,250
so I'm not really concerned
with winning or losing.

141
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,916
For me, it's all about
getting out of this

142
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,416
as unremarkably as possible.

143
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,916
That's the challenge.

144
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,458
[SAIKI]
Forty-one? That's a tad low.

145
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:45,500
[NARRATOR B]
Likability Meter.

146
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,166
It is an applied
telepathic ability.

147
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,000
By reading the minds
of everyone around him,

148
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,541
it calculates his likability
and quantifies it!

149
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,166
[SAIKI]
My goal here is 50.

150
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,333
To get that,
I have to at least...

151
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:56,833
...take out one guy!

152
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,750
[BOY STUDENTS]
Stop screwing around, you jerk!

153
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:00,541
[SAIKI]
Twenty, huh?

154
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:01,666
Well, that went down fast.

155
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,083
[NARRATOR B]
With that score,

156
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,500
a girl would scream if
assigned the seat next to you.

157
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,541
[SAIKI] Figuring out how
hard to throw is tricky.

158
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,000
[KOBAYASHI]
Put some muscle into it!

159
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,750
[SAIKI] If I really tried,
it'd break the sound barrier

160
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,291
and do catastrophic damage.

161
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,250
But this slow ball's
different than the last one.

162
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,166
[TAKEDA]
Got it!

163
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,833
Ugh, Saiki is so the worst.

164
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,250
Try harder, bro!

165
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,416
[SAIKI]
This time I threw...

166
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,875
Got it. Got it!

167
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:20,708
[SAIKI]
...a spin ball.

168
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:21,750
Whoa!

169
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,291
[SAIKI]
Nice. My likability's back up.

170
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:30,208
Even if I get out now,
I can end up around 50.

171
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,666
Just gotta get hit next time.

172
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,958
[KAIDOU] Hmph! Finally
it's my turn to show you

173
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,375
what I've got.

174
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:36,875
Do you have any idea what
that means for you, Saiki?

175
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,791
It means that
you're in big trouble!

176
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,208
[SAIKI] Jeez, I have to
let this kid take me out?

177
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,708
Here's my Meteor
Spark Genocide Ball!

178
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:44,791
Ow!

179
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,083
[BOY STUDENTS]
You call that a throw?

180
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,541
[TAKAHASHI]
What the hell was that, Kaidou?

181
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,250
It looks like Saiki got lucky.

182
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,541
If he can't catch that,
that's just sad.

183
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:52,916
[SAIKI]
If I don't catch this one,

184
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,500
my likability's gonna plummet.

185
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,708
[NARRATOR B] With a score
of 36, the students won't put

186

they're done cleaning.

187
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,583
[FURUKAWA] All right!
We got the ball again!

188
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:02,791
--What's wrong with you, Kaidou?
--[SAIKI] If I throw another

--My wrist is acting up.
--that'll look suspicious.

191
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,625
Hey, Saiki, over here I'm open!

192
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,208
Toss it here! Bring me in!

193
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,041
[SAIKI] If I pass the ball to
the outfield and gain a player,

194
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,458
then I'll stand out less!

195
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:12,750
Gotta make sure
it gets to him, though,

196
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,916
so I'll put a little
strength behind this one.

197
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,541
[BOY STUDENTS yelp]

198
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,208
[SAIKI] Shoot, that was
a little too much strength.

199
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,458
[NARRATOR B]
With a score of 73,

Sorry, buddy!

203
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,083
[SAIKI]
Time to end this.

204
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:31,958
[KIJIMA]
No!

205
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,291
Guess he couldn't pull it off.

206
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:34,500
Well he gave it his best.

207
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:35,916
[SAIKI] Fifty-five.
I can live with tha--

[HAIRO]
I got it!

209
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,791
[BOY STUDENTS]
Ah! That butt. It's...

210
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:40,958
Just in time.

211
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,583
[BOY STUDENTS]
...Hairo!

212
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:43,625
[SAIKI]
Not you again.

213
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:44,875
[BOY STUDENT T]
Hairo's back!

214
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,083
Saiki, I saw the spirit
you put into that throw!

215
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,958
It really moved me!

216
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,791
[SAIKI] Yeah, I don't
care about your likability.

217
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,500
[HAIRO]
I'll handle things from here!

218
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,541
[yells]

219
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:57,500
Direct hit! Bull's-eye!
Yeah, suck it!

220
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:00,000
Sorry, but your little
comeback ends here.

221
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,500
I won't be dropped as
easy as those puny wimps.

222
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,625
Yeah, me neither.

223
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:06,000
Fine, let's finish
this then. Bring it!

224
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,666
[SAIKI] With that injury,
Hairo probably

225
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,333
can't catch Nendou's
ball right now.

226
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:12,416
[NENDOU]
Take this!

227
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,833
[SAIKI]
I've got no choice.

228
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,916
The kid wounded
his knee 'cause of me.

229
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,208
Much as I hate
to draw attention...

230
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,958
...I hate being in debt
to someone even more.

231
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:26,875
No, you take it!

232
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,041
[BOTH yelp]

233
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,875
[BOY STUDENT T]
He did it! It's a miracle!

234
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,875
[SAIKI] Oh, great.
It wound up at eighty-two.

235
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:36,000
I'll just have to chip
away at it over time.

236
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,291
Saiki's so amazing!

237
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:38,541
Nice job, Saiki!

238
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:39,625
[NENDOU]
Buddy!

239
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,750
That was a really
great match, man.

240
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:42,916
[SAIKI]
Likability...

241
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,375
It can free-fall in
the blink of an eye.

242
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,375
[BOY STUDENT V]
What? Minako said yes?

243
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,250
[SAIKI] In high school,
love is always in the air,

244
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,000
which is something
I consider entirely pointless.

245
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,750
These romantic
feelings elude me.

246
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,125
Take Teruhashi for example.

247
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,625
Every boy in school wants her.

248
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:09,666
[GIRL STUDENT D]
Come on, Teruhashi.

249
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,166
When are you gonna
get a boyfriend?

250
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,541
Well, I guess I just think
I'm too young to be dating.

251
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:15,833
[GIRL STUDENTS]
Seriously?

252
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:16,916
[SAIKI] Meanwhile,
I have zero interest in her

253
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,541
because I know
who she really is.

254
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:19,708
So when she says something like:

255
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,583
Studying should be
our focus as students.

256
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,416
[SAIKI]
The only thing I hear is:

257
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,791
[TERUHASHI]
Actually, I don't get involved

258
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:25,958
with immature brats.

259
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,666
[SAIKI] And this is
how she looks to me:

[TERUHASHI]
His annual income should be

261
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,500
at least 40 million yen.

262
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,708
[SAIKI] Oh yeah, I can't
control this ability to see

263
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,208
through objects, just like
I can't control my telepathy.

please read <i>The Disastrous</i>
<i>Life of Saiki K</i> .

Anyway, that's the main reason

267
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:43,083
I'll probably never wanna
be in a relationship,

268
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:46,750
and it's why I'm currently
facing a serious dilemma.

Yup.

Oh, Saiki.

Lately, I just can't
stop thinking about you.

such a huge crush on y--

[SAIKI]
No, this won't work at all.

278
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,500
I'll stand out as a freak.

279
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,041
I know I'm repeating myself,

280
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,541
but I really don't
wanna stand out.

281
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:14,708

what he's thinking right now.

Just remember the plan!

All right, next up.
The handkerchief plan!

First, I casually drop this
handkerchief by Saiki's feet.

Then, he sees it and says:

00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,833
Smells like a sunny day!

311
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:13,750
[NARRATOR A]
Just in love.

312
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,291
[YUMEHARA giggles]
Best thing about this plan is,

313
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,166
even if he doesn't
notice the handkerchief,

314
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,791
I still have an
excuse to talk to him.

315
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,583
You can do it, self!

316
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,083
[YUMEHARA] Now to see
if Saiki takes the bait.

317
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,208
[YUMEHARA]
Hmm, he's not saying anything.

318
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,083
Oh well, that's okay.
On to Plan B!

319
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,791
Oh my goodness,
that's really bizarre.

320
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:37,125
My pink handkerchief is...
Right here?

321
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,750
How'd that happen?

322
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,458
[YUMEHARA]
Another disaster!

323
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,333
[NARRATOR B] Undeterred,
Chiyo continued on her mission

324
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,250
to engage Saiki, however...

325
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,416
Did someone knock?

326
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,666
I made way too many
cookies in home ec.,

327
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,208
and I was wondering
if you wanted s--

328
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:50,041
Yeah, I'd love some.

329
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,375
[YUMEHARA]
Who's this guy?!

330
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,833
[NARRATOR B] Every single
one of her plans failed.

331
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,166
[YUMEHARA]
Maybe Saiki and I just

332
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,791
aren't meant to be together?

333
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,166
Great, on top of everything,

334
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,125
I forgot my umbrella.

335
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:01,875
That's it!

336
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,375
[GIRL STUDENT G]
See ya!

337
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:04,625
[BOY STUDENT Y] Man, it's
raining cats and dogs out here!

338
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:05,791
[YUMEHARA] I bet Saiki
brought his umbrella.

339
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,625
He seems like the
responsible type.

340
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:12,333
Wow, it's really
coming down. Huh? I, um...

341
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,416
Hi, would you like to
join me under my umbrella?

342
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,916
[YUMEHARA sighs]

343
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,958
[YUMEHARA] His smile is as
warm and as bright as the sun.

344
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,250
Finally, the perfect plan!

345
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:31,083
Huh, the rain just stopped?
Ah... Saiki.

346
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:32,458
[YUMEHARA]
I give up.

347
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:35,333
It seems Saiki and I are
destined to always be apart.

348
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,416
Goodbye, Saiki.

349
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,916
[SAIKI]
Goodbye, Yumehara.

350
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,708
Please forget about me
and find somebody else.

351
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:43,083
I'm sure another guy
will come along soon, so--

352
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,541
[TAKERU]
Wanna share my umbrella?

353
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,166
[YUMEHARA]
But the rain stopped.

354
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,208
[TAKERU] Not the rain of tears
falling inside your heart.

355
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:52,125
Please, let me be the umbrella
for your overcast heart.

356
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,666
[YUMEHARA] This boy!
I just met my soul mate.

357
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,916
[SAIKI]
Okay, that's a little too soon.

358
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:03,666
[KUNIHARU]
Kusuo!

359
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,208
Gimme a hand
moving some furniture.

360
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,750
Won't take long
with your powers.

361
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,291
[SAIKI]
Move it yourself.

362
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,583
[KUNIHARU] Huh? I would, but
I've got other things to carry.

363
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:11,625
Ah!

364
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:13,958
[KUNIHARU]
See, like your mother!

365
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,666
I've got my hands full
carrying her around!

366
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,333
You're so strong, honey.

367
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,750
[SAIKI]
I repeat. Move it yourself.

368
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,208
[NARRATOR A]
Due to a marital spat,

369
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,916
this couple has been sleeping
in separate bedrooms.

370
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,666
However, that's
all about to change,

371
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,166
thanks to the help
of a craftsman who--

372
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,125
[SAIKI]
I'm not a craftsman.

373
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,166
[KUNIHARU]
Whoa!

374
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,666
[KURUMI]
You really are amazing, Kuu!

375
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,083
Yeah, seriously, what do people
without a psychic son do?

376
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,125
Woo-hoo! Flying bed!

377
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,000
[grunting]

378
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,208
Oh my.

379
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,791
[SAIKI] Some of you,
like this idiot here,

380
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:41,458
may be getting the wrong idea,
so let me clear a few things up.

381
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:44,291
If you think my power's always
convenient, you're wrong.

382
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:47,500
Most of my abilities come with
limitations and drawbacks.

383
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,416
For instance,
some can only be used

384
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,500
under certain circumstances.

385
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:54,416
Oops, I don't know how
that picture got in there.

386
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,000
So yeah, I'm not all-powerful.

387
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,500
[KUNIHARU]
Hey, look at me!

388
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,333
I'm the strongest man
in the world!

389
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:00,791
[KUNIHARU groans]

390
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,000
[KURUMI]
Oh, my goodness!

391
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,625
[SAIKI] See? Lost my
strength for a second.

392
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:04,916
[KUNIHARU]
Phew.

393
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,541
Well, that's the last of it.
I'm all done now.

394
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,291
Good job.
Here, you must be thirsty.

395
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,583
[SAIKI]
Don't act like you did anything.

396
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,416
I moved everything myself.

397
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,833
[KUNIHARU groans]

398
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:13,708
[KUNIHARU] The bed's blocking
access to the balcony.

399
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:14,750
[KURUMI]
Oh no, you're right.

400
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:15,833
I'd love to move it,

401
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,458
but it's too heavy
to move by myself.

402
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,041
[KURUMI] Hmm, if only
there was someone

403
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,500
who could move it really easily.

404
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:21,541
[KUNIHARU]
Well, to do that,

405
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:22,708
they'd prob'ly need
psychic powers.

406
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,208
[KURUMI] Yeah, I wish
there was someone

407
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,375
--with psychic powers around.
--[SAIKI] Stop this farce.

408
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,250
[KUNIHARU]
Is there anyone like that here?

409
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:28,125
[BOTH gasp]

410
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,458
[SAIKI]
Just stop.

411
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:30,750
[KUNIHARU]
Ah, this is perfect!

412
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,833
[KURUMI] Now we can
get to the balcony again!

413
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,208
How can we thank you?

414
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:35,583
How 'bout we give you
a little brother or sister?!

415
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,083
Which would you prefer?

416
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,291
[SAIKI] Please don't imply
whatever you're implying.

417
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,958
Anyway, if that's all,
I'll be in my room.

418
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,041
[KURUMI]
Uh-oh.

419
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,208
Now we can't get
the closet door open.

420
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,166
What a travesty!

421
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,208
[BOTH]
Ah!

422
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:49,666
Wow, that's so much better!

423
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,250
Oh yeah, this time
it's definitely perfect!

424
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,333
Now let's go have some...

425
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,041
Huh?

426
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,416
[BOTH]
Ah!

427
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,916
[SAIKI]
Are they stupid or what?

428
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,458
[KUNIHARU] Maybe we should
knock this wall down?

429
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,375
[KURUMI]
Let's do it!

430
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,041
[KUNIHARU]
Kusuo!

431
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,375
Make it happen!

432
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,083
[SAIKI] Just remember,
you asked for this.

433
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,625
[loud crash]

434
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,125
[SAIKI]
All done.

435
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:08,333
Okay.

436
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,583
Uh. Thanks, I guess.

437
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,500
[SAIKI]
Hey, what did you expect?

438
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,333
[KUNIHARU yelps]

439
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:15,416
[SAIKI]
Yeah, that's a good reaction.

440
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,458
[KUNIHARU]
This is nice!

441
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:17,916
Knocking it down
was the right call!

442
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,583
[KURUMI] The room's
a lot more spacious now!

443
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,583
[KUNIHARU]
Yeah, it really is!

444
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,125
All this space overwhelms me!

445
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,541
[SAIKI]
I'm about to lose it.

446
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,750
[KURUMI] This emptiness
right here bothers me.

447
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,125
[KUNIHARU]
Then let's put something there.

448
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:29,250
[KURUMI]
What about a TV?

449
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,166
[KUNIHARU]
That's not quite right.

450
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,041
I'm thinking... tiger rug.

451
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,500
[SAIKI]
Disgusting.

452
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,583
Well, all we have
in the house is a sofa.

453
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,916
Let's bring it in here, Kusuo.

454
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,250
That's a terrible
place for a couch!

455
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,750
Who's gonna wanna
sit in the corner?

456
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,416
We can't have our
heads facing north!

457
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,750
What the hell is that?

458
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:45,500
[KUNIHARU grunting]

459
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:46,375
[KUNIHARU]
Too humid!

460
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:47,875
What do we need two beds for?

461
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,625
I've never seen
that ceiling before!

462
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,291
Something feels off!

463
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,125
This isn't working!

464
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:54,958
Let's take a break.

465
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,375
Honey, look at this.

466
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:57,875
The room on the
left is our bedroom,

467
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:00,500
and we tore down the wall
'cause it was too small, right?

468
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:01,958
But it looks like
the room on the right

469
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,250
was already much bigger.

470
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,833
So instead of tearing
down the wall,

471
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:07,541
maybe we should've just made the
one on the right our bedroom?

472
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:08,708
[KUNIHARU]
That's it!

Oh, you did very good!

476
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:13,750

is our last request!

It better be. 'Cause I'm done.

483
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:27,458

your original state!

I love you.

488
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,166
[SAIKI]
I forgot to mention,

489
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,375
my restoration ability
has a drawback, too.

490
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:40,916
[KUNIHARU]
Huh?

491
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,166
Where's the bed?

492
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,125
[SAIKI] See, it doesn't
actually revert things

493
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,666
to their former state.

494
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,500
All it does is turn back time
for that object by one day.

495
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:51,833
Problem is, time rewinds for
things that are nearby, too.

496
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,333
In this case,
we're dealing with a wall,

497
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,750
so, the whole house might've
gone back to the way it was.

Uh, sorry, sir.

Looks like Matsuzaki's on
the warpath again. Great.

511
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:28,458
[SAIKI]
A surprise inspection.

512
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:29,958
Lemme ask you.

513
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:33,000
Think I can pass the dress code
check, looking like this?

514
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,083
The answer, of course, is...

515
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,541
Hey, stop right there!

516
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:37,666
[SAIKI]
...obviously.

517
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,875
[MATSUZAKI]
That hair is unacceptable!

518
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,250
Oh?

519
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,041
[SAIKI] It's to be expected,
since, by all accounts,

520
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,291
I'm a perfectly normal student.

521
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,083
The other day,
I received some fan mail,

522
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:49,250
asking the question, "If Saiki
doesn't want to stand out,

523
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,500
why is his
appearance so strange?"

524
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,208
Well, here's the answer.

525
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,833
In "this world,"
my look is natural.

526
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:57,166
Now of course,
when you think about it,

527
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,958
I'm not normal at all.

528
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,458
Yet, I'm the most
inconspicuous kid in school.

529
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:05,500
How? I'll tell ya. Mind control.

530
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:08,416
I can alter people's thoughts,
at least to some extent.

531
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,416
I mean, I can't completely
control somebody's actions.

532
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,250
If I could, this guy
would shut up already.

533
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,583
Right?

534
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,666
[SAIKI] But what I can do
is make others perceive

535
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,833
"unnatural things" as
something "totally natural."

536
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:21,916
Antennae? Huh.

537
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,791
Wait is it possible
they're just hairclips?

538
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:26,458
Oh, yeah, sure.
That's what they are.

539
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,833
[SAIKI] Thus, I can go
through life and not stick out.

540
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:30,291
Simple, right?

541
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,250
But I've gotta use
this power sparingly,

542
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:34,208
'cause if I change
someone's way of thinking,

543
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:37,250
it'll affect the people
around them, too.

544
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,166
Take a look around.
In "this world,"

545
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,291
you almost never see
people with black hair.

546
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,083
This phenomenon,
believe it or not,

547
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,583
is all due to my psychic powers.

548
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:49,708
For some unknown reason,
I was born with pink hair.

549
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:52,291
Meanwhile, all the
other kids had black hair.

550
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,750
Or, on occasion, brown.

551
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:58,625
Since I didn't wanna stand
out, I used mind control.

552
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:01,333
As a result, pink became
a common hair color,

553
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:04,125
and it's pretty normal now to
see hair in all sorts of colors.

554
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,666
And their hair is natural.

555
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:10,833
I altered human biology, right
down to the genetic level.

556
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:13,500
Are you starting to get the
potential risk of my power?

Don't you think it's strange,

567
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,875
how his injury healed
so abnormally fast?

568
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:32,708
That's right.

569
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:33,958
As you've no doubt guessed,

570
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,625
this is the result of
my psychic powers, too.

571
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,833
When I was little,
a kid skinned his knee,

572
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:39,833
I healed it.

573
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,791
Needless to say,
he was surprised.

574
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,916
So I used mind control.

575
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,875
[SAIKI] Since people stopped
suffering from mild injuries,

576
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,375
they started to
think it was natural

577
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,791
for them to heal right away.

578
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,208
As a result,

579
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,666
people's ability to self-heal
increased dramatically.

580
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,625
Maybe you've noticed other
freakish behavior, like this.

[BATTER A] Here it comes!
Is it a fastball?

582
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,750
Or his favorite, the curveball?
According to his stats,

583
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:01,833
he usually throws
a curveball first.

584
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:02,833
I should adjust my angle.

585

00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,666
[SAIKI]
Yup, that's all because of me.

588
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,416
Humans have evolved
to think fast

589
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,583
when they need
to react instantly.

590
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:12,708
Now clothes can be torn off,

while the crotch
remains covered.

Tiny folks can be super strong.

You can knock someone
out with just a chop.

594

All these unnatural phenomena
were caused by me.

00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:23,416
And yeah, sure, I feel some
guilt for changing the world

00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,291
like I have, but it's too late
to change things back now.

597
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:28,583
Still, at the same time,
I've shown some restraint,

See? This isn't too bad, right?

621
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:43,666
[SAIKI]
Since the show's called

622
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,000
<i>The Disastrous</i>
<i>Life of Saiki K.</i> ,

623
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:47,375
I'll try to
realistically present

624
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:49,375
the many disasters I face.

625
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:53,291
[SAIKI] Next time, on <i>The</i>
<i>Disastrous Life of Saiki K.</i> :

626
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:55,833
Each chapter of the
manga gets an episode!
