[BOY A]
You got a crush on someone.

461
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:24,625
[BOY B]
Teruhashi, is it one of us?

462
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,958
It's someone I ran
into over vacation.

463
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:29,958
[TERUHASHI chuckles]
You know who I mean, right?

464
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:32,250
I know he wasn't a
figment of my imagination.

465
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:35,416
It was the sixth of August when
I first fell in love with him.

466
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,708
[TERUHASHI] That's a day you'll
never forget, either, Saiki.

467
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:39,875
I remember seeing
you that day, too.

468
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,250
And the guy you were
talking with...

469
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,458
...was Nendou!

470
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:46,791
[TERUHASHI]
You are way off, idiot. Uh...

471
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,458
Yeah, his name's Uri Offidiot.

472
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,125
He's a Russian exchange student.

473
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,708
[SAIKI]
Nope.

474
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:54,375
[KAIDOU]  Hey, Saiki, just me,
or is Nendou acting weird today?

475
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:55,791
[SAIKI]
You're the one being weird.

476
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,458
Like usually
he's always saying,

477
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,500
[MOCKS] "We should do stuff
after school, buddy."

478
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,375
[SAIKI]
He is quieter than normal.

479
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:05,166
Oh, my look? Don't worry
about it. It's a long story.

480
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,791
[SAIKI] I'm not worried about
it. I just think it's stupid.

481
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:11,041
[grunting]

482
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,041
[SAIKI]
What's that all about?

483
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,458
[KAIDOU]
Pretty fishy, right?

484
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:15,875
[SAIKI]
My interest is piqued.

485
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,791
All right, all right.
I'll tell you. It all started--

486
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:20,125
[SAIKI] Stop it. I don't
care about your new look.

487
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,333
[KAIDOU]
His house isn't this way.

488
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:26,541
He's got something
going on. Heh, heh.

489
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:29,541
[SAIKI]
Why are you so excited by this?

490
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:30,875
Heh heh.

491
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:32,708
[SAIKI] And why are you so
good at tailing people?

492
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:36,083
Hey, Saiki, check it.
What's Nendou looking at?

493
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:37,833
[GIRL laughs]

494
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:38,833
[chuckles]

495
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,416
[BOTH]
Creepy.

496
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,083
[KAIDOU] Nendou has a
thing for little girls?

497
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,083
[SAIKI]
Doesn't look good.

498
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,041
We should probably
call the police.

499
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,333
[KAIDOU]
He's going into a store.

500
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:49,250
Looks like a flower boutique.

501
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,750
Don't tell me he's got a girl.

502
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,625
[SAIKI, KAIDOU]
No, not Nendou.

503
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:53,375
Huh?

504
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,333
[BOTH laughing]

505
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,416
[BOTH]
Another one.

506
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,958
[KAIDOU]
That's just gross.

507
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,375
[SAIKI] We'll confirm it
after we call the police.

508
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,208
No, we need more
proof than this.

509
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,958
I mean, lots of people
like sunflowers,

510
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:04,041
and it's natural to smile when

511
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,541
you see a cute
little kid, right?

512
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,291
[SAIKI]
Good point. Let's not be rash.

513
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,750
[KAIDOU]
Hm, another shop.

514
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:10,875
Cakes!

515
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,625
Women and children
can't resist sweets.

516
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:15,208
When you combine a woman and
a child, you get a little girl.

517
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,666
[SAIKI] Now you're
jumping to conclusions.

518
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,208
[KAIDOU] Have you ever
seen Nendou eat that?

519
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,458
Or like flowers?

520
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:20,708
It's all meant to
be given to someone,

521
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:23,125
but he has no girlfriend
to give them to.

522
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,166
That can only mean
that they're bait

523
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,333
and that he's using them
to lure away little girls.

524
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:30,208
[SAIKI] Any girl it works
on has her own problems.

525
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,750
[NENDOU] Bummer. They were
all out of shortcake.

526
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:36,416
Oh, well. It's not like
anyone will ever eat this.

527
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,125
[SAIKI, KAIDOU] If it's not
for eating, it must be bait.

528
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:40,708
--[KAIDOU] Nendou.
--Huh?

529
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:43,541
Your secret's out. How dare you
hurt little kids, you monster.

530
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,291
[SAIKI] Is that what
his punches sound like?

531
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:48,750
Wait. What secret?
You mean my dad? Wha... ?

532
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,041
[KAIDOU]
He's dead?

533
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,333
I visit on the anniversary
of his bus accident.

534
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:53,708
But the flowers and the cake?

535
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,541
Respectful offerings
to the dead.

536
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,458
It's normal to bring cakes
and flowers to a family grave.

537
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,916
[SAIKI] To think Nendou's
lecturing us on normal.

538
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,625
I get it now. Those weren't
creepy looks he was giving.

539
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:06,541
Seeing kids with their dads
just made him think of his own.

540
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,916
Nendou has a very
misleading face.

541
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,625
When did your dad die, Nendou?

542
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,708
Well, it was before I was born.

543
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,166
He died trying to save
a little girl

544
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,250
who'd run in front of a bus.

545
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:19,458
Huh. Maybe that means
he was into little girls?

546
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,291
[KAIDOU]
Uh, hope not. Heh, heh.

547
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,791
[SAIKI]
That's a dark joke.

548
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,250
So if he died
before you were born,

549
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,791
he must've been pretty young.

550
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,875
He was only 18 or 19 years old.

551
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:29,916
Here, look. I got his picture.

552
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,916
Hey. This is just
a picture of you.

553
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,250
No. It's him.

554
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,791
My mom says I look more
like him each year. Weird.

555
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:37,791
You don't just look like him.
You're the same.

556
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,958
[SAIKI] I've seen pictures
of Nendou's dad before,

557
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,875
and they really do look like
they could be identical twins.

558
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,083
The only difference is that

559
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:46,208
while Nendou has a
scar over his left eye,

560
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:47,750
his father had one
over his right.

561
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:50,625
Cake, mmm.

562
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:54,583
[SAIKI] Uch. That's not
a real ghost, right?

563
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:56,375
Wanna go get some ramen?

564
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:59,250
[SAIKI] I know my powers
are literally supernatural.

565
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:01,083
But personally
I don't believe in ghosts,

566
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:04,125
so I'll pretend today at the
graveyard never happened.

567
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:06,083
Hmm?

568
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:08,666
It's for me. Weird.
I never get mail--

569
