[KUBOYASU] I'm a former punk,
and my folks were punks, too.

32
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,125
My old man was head
of a biker gang,

33
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:45,291
and Mom led a women's gang.

34
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:46,791

in their footsteps.

36
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:49,416
In third grade,
I ruled my school.

37
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,416
One time, this lug
pulled out my hair.

38

but I turned the tables on him.

39
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:55,958
All through high school,
I kept fighting

40
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:57,875
and kept growing my hair,
until eventually,

41
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:00,791
I had my own gang and
my hair touched the ground.

42
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,458
I wasn't really thinkin'
straight back then.

43
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:05,208
I wouldn't say
I regret those days,

44
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:08,250
but I did get sick of stepping
on my own hair all the time.

45
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,875
Now that I've changed schools,
my punk days are behind me.

46
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,541
I ain't gotta fight no more.

47
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,750
I'ma study hard and
live the straight and narrow.

48
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,333
Just you watch!

49
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:19,541
And if anyone gets in my way,
I'll beat the crap out of 'em!

So much for not fighting.

51

Everyone has a past and secrets
they wanna keep to themselves.

52

I have no problem with that,

change over night.

like that and weren't a punk,

That's exactly what he is.

was chase mosquitoes
around with a mosquito coil.

How dare that goody-goody

156
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:48,625
give me such an annoyed look!
Though I did learn something.

157
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,583
I got nothin' in common
with these people.

158
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:53,541
[KAIDOU] Hey, newbie. You can
call me The Jet-Black Wings.

159
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,291
This world is an illusion
for sheep waiting on...

160
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:56,625
[KUBOYASU]
This is hopeless.

161
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,291
I can't understand a word
these normal people say!

162
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:02,208
[SAIKI] Yeah, there's nothing
normal about that guy.

163
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:03,791
[KAIDOU] To house the
engraved seal of Cross,

164
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,916
we must immediately
complete the "Grand Cross"!

165
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,250
[KUBOYASU] "Grand Cross"?
I've heard of that!

166
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:09,958
[KUBOYASU]
Oh, right! The legendary group!

167
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,250
[KAIDOU]
What? You know about it?

168
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,833
[SAIKI]
Not the same thing.

169
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:15,000
Oh, yeah, they completely wiped
out "Samantha" and "Paramount"!

170
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,125
[KAIDOU]
Whoa, I can't believe you know

171
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,875
about "Samantha" and
"Paramount," too!

172
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,458
[SAIKI]
Quite the coincidence.

173
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:22,250
[KUBOYASU] Glad I finally found
somebody with common interests.

174
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,958
[TORITSUKA] Hey!
You the new transfer student?

175
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,041
Uh, yeah.

176
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,041
I transferred here, too.

177
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,250
[KUBOYASU]
Who the hell's this kid?

178
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,583
[KUBOYASU] You came
second term of Year Two?

179
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,125
No, it was a long time ago.

180
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,833
Let's see, it was
second term of Year Two.

181
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,833
Anyway, this school is crawling
with cute girls. It's awesome!

182
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,041
[KUBOYASU]
Don't act like we're buds!

183
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,291
Oh, by the way,

184
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,500
were there any hot
chicks at your old school?

185
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,041
If so, I'd love it if
you could hook me...

186
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,833
[KUBOYASU]
Well, I guess at this point

187
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:44,333
I need all the
friends I can get.

188
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:47,750
Well, I actually went
to an all-boys school, so...

189
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:51,833
Huh?!

190
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:54,041
[KUBOYASU] What a creep! Only
interested in hitting on girls!

191
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,791
And he calls himself a man?

192
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:59,375
Ah, you're Kuboyasu.
That right?

193
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,416
Uh. Uh. Oh, hell.

194
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,625
Are you settling in okay?
I'm Kokomi Teruhashi.

195
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:06,958
I'm in your class.
Hope you'll remember me.

196
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,750
[TERUHASHI] As if you could ever
in a million years forget me.

197
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,750
Why'd he say, "Oh, hell"
and not "Oh, wow"?

198
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,875
[KUBOYASU] I ain't never
seen a chick as hot as her.

199
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,041
Hell, I'm feelin' the urge

200
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,375
to tattoo "I live for
Kokomi" on my arm!

201
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,375
I sound like that creep!
Don't give in to your urges!

202
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,458
--[HAIRO] Never give in!
--[KUBOYASU] Huh?

203
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,625
You can do it!
Come on, push yourself!

204
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:22,958
[KUBOYASU]
This guy's our class rep.

205
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:25,291
Why the hell's he doin'
sit-ups in the hallway?

206
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:28,375
Whatever. I gotta keep my
distance from weirdoes like him.

207
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:29,458
[BOY STUDENT N]
Go, Hairo!

208
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,583
[BOY STUDENT O]
You're on fire, dude!

209
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:32,916
[KUBOYASU]
Wait, he's popular?

210
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,916
How's that possible?

211
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,958
[HAIRO]
Hey, Kuboyasu!

212
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,875
You wanna do some
sit-ups with me?

213
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,125
[BOY STUDENT N]
Forget it, Hairo.

214
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,875
Kuboyasu doesn't look
like he's into sports.

215
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,500
[BOY STUDENT O]
Yeah, he's all skin and bones.

216
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:42,500
[KUBOYASU]
Let's see how you feel

217
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:43,791
after I break all your bones.

218
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,375
[HAIRO]
Not cool, you guys.

219
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,958
You shouldn't judge someone you
don't know based on appearance.

220
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,416
Honestly, it's wrong
to judge anybody,

221
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,958
whether you know them or not!

222
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,958
Only you can decide
what your limits are.

223
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,041
[KUBOYASU]
This guy...

224
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,666
Who cares what
anyone else tells you?

225
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,166
In the end, it's all up to you.

226
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,333
[KUBOYASU] He sounds
just like my old gang leader!

227
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,166
Who'da thought I'd find
someone like him here.

228
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,333
Aren Kuboyasu. A pleasure.

229
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:04,500
[KUBOYASU]
He's the first person

230
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,208
I've actually wanted
to be friends with.

231
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,541
By the way, why were you
doing sit-ups in the hallway?

232
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,750
There's this really
strong guy I need to beat.

233
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,333
[KUBOYASU]
Whoa, someone stronger than him?

234
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,000
Wonder who it could be.

235
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,333
--[NENDOU] Uhh...
--[KUBOYASU] Him?

236
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,083
[KUBOYASU] Wait, is he so
crazy that beating guys

237
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,500
doesn't even count
as a war story?

238
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:20,958
My fighting senses are tingling.

239
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,708
--I gotta see who's stronger!
--Hey, buddy! What's up?

240
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:23,958
[KUBOYASU]
"Buddy"?

241
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,166
You mean there's another
kid at the same level

242
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,958
as a guy even Hairo can't beat?

243
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:30,125
Him? I've gone full circle
and come back to him?

244
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,375
I know we're not
s'posed to judge people,

245
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,250
but this can't be right!

246
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,000
So how's Plan Alpha
coming, Saiki?

247
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,166
Hey, Saiki!

248
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,708
How you doing, Saiki?

249
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,125
Hey there, Saiki!

250
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,416
[KUBOYASU]
What's going on?

251
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,541
Everybody's fawning
all over that goody-goody.

252
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,791
Could it be he's the
one pulling the strings?

253
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,125
[SAIKI] I'm never using
my annoyed face again.

254
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,250
[SAIKI]
Who on earth will win?

255
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,500
Foretell it.

256
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,041
[NENDOU]
Hey, sorry to drag you guys

257
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,666
out to my dad's grave like this.

258
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,291
Eh, it was on the way.

259
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,375
[SAIKI] This is more
annoying than normal.

260
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,666
I tagged along 'cause
Kaidou really wanted me to,

261
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,125
but now I wish I hadn't.

262
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:12,625
Who're you even praying to
there? Your dad's over here.

263
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,250
Hey, whatchu guys doing?

264
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,708
[SAIKI]
Visiting your grave.

265
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,875
Even though I'm a psychic,
I don't usually see ghosts.

266
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,041
But for some reason,
I keep seeing this guy.

267
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,750
You know, one Nendou
is already too many.

268
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,791
I can't handle two of 'em.

269
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,000
[MIDORI]
Hello, boys.

270
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,166
[SAIKI]
And now there are three.

271
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,333
--[NENDOU] Mom!
--Oh, you came here, too?

272
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,458
[MIDORI]
Thanks for looking after Riki.

273
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:34,875
He's lucky to have
good friends like you.

274
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,875
[SAIKI] Kaidou, I know
the feeling, but don't stare.

275
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,750
[MIDORI] What is it?
Do I have something on my face?

276
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,166
[KAIDOU]
Ah! No! 'Course not!

277
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,916
I'm lucky to have him,
too, ma'am!

278
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
[SAIKI]
That's the wrong Nendou.

279
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,166
[KAIDOU]
Sorry, my mistake!

280
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,333
[NENDOU laughs]
Darn right, you're lucky!

281
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:48,750
[KAIDOU]
Shut your mouth, dummy!

282
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,250
[SAIKI]
That's the dummy's mom.

283
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,916
I'm so sorry about that, ma'am,
this might sound rude,

284
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,083
but you and your son
look exactly alike.

285
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,458
[SAIKI]
That definitely sounds rude.

286
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,416
What? My son and I look alike?

287
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,458
Ha, please,
stop your kidding, you.

288
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:01,916
[SAIKI]
He really wasn't kidding.

289
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,125
[MIDORI]
He resembles his father.

290
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,875
Doesn't look a thing like me.

291
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,708
Now, wouldn't you
agree with that, Riki?

292
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,666
Huh? You grow your
hair out, Riki?

293
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,958
[SAIKI]
Um, that's you.

294
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,708
They do look alike!
What funny faces! Ha!

295
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,250
[SAIKI]
Look who's talking! Oh, right.

296
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,750
Since he's a ghost, mirrors
won't show his reflection.

297
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,666
And he's got no memories
from when he was alive,

298
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,291
so he has no clue
what he looks like.

299
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,666
If he did, he'd know instantly

300
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,666
that those guys
are related to him.

301
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,333
Huh, for some reason,
I'm curious about these two.

302
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:29,291
[MIDORI] You boys should
come to our place for dinner.

303
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:30,416
[NENDOU]
Come on in.

304
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,708
[KAIDOU]
So, is this your room?

305
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:32,875
[NENDOU]
Sure, is.

306
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,791
This is the chance
I've been waiting for.

307
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,333
I'm gonna find all
of the porno mags

308
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,625
that I know you've got
hidden around here!

309
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:41,583
[SAIKI] You could just ask
Toritsuka if you want it bad.

310
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,333
[KAIDOU] Where are they?
I know they're here!

311
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:47,041
Jackpot! Heh. So, this is
the kinda filth he's into.

312
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,708
I'm just gonna
put this back here.

313
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,208
[SAIKI]
What are you trying to do?

314
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,500
Whoops, I forgot
the reason I came here.

315
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:53,916
To look for clues
that might tell me

316
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,250
what's keeping Nendou's
dad in this world.

317
00:11:56,333 --> 00:12:00,333
Hmm? What's he staring at?
Oh, a picture of himself.

318
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:01,916
What now?

319
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,208
[NENDOU'S DAD laughs] His ol'
man looks just like him, too!

320
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:05,916
[SAIKI] Well, that didn't help.
I'm going home.

321
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,625
It's been 17 years now.

322
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:10,041
The loneliness and
sadness may have passed,

323
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:13,958
but I can't help feeling
like he's still close by.

324
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,958
[SAIKI] He is. In fact,
you're sitting on him right now.

325
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:20,041
[MIDORI] Maybe it's just because
our son looks so much like him.

326
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:22,625
Hey, boys, please make
yourselves at home!

327
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:23,500
[SAIKI]
What's going on?

328
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,000
He's gone quiet.

329
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,500
Hey. Something wrong?

330
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:27,500
[NENDOU'S DAD]
...with her.

331
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:28,375
[SAIKI]
Huh?

332
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,833
I've fallen in love with her!

333
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,583
I felt deep love
towards that woman!

334
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:33,916
[SAIKI]
Hold on a sec!

335
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,458
Guess it makes sense.
I mean, they were married.

336
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:36,708
I'm begging you, kid!

337
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,458
You gotta tell that lady
how I feel about her!

338
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,333
[SAIKI] I don't wanna get
involved in your drama.

339
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,083
[NENDOU'S DAD] I just wanna
talk to her. That's all.

340
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,375
Then I can depart happily!

341
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:47,083
Oh, wow. Aaa! Hey, Saiki!
I wasn't doing anything!

342
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,833
[SAIKI] I don't care.
Hey, where's Nendou?

343
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,375
He's lying right over there.

344
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,666
He fell asleep, even
though he's got friends over.

345
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,541
[SAIKI]
That's convenient.

346
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,125
I'll be in the bathroom. Okay?

347
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,666
[MIDORI]
Oh, what's that in your hand?

348
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,958
[KAIDOU]
Ah! Nothing!

349
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,083
[NENDOU'S DAD]
Hey, what are you doing to him?

350
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,708
Ahhh! What in the
heck are you doin'?

351
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:03,625
[SAIKI] Oh, calm down. I'm just
creating an astral projection.

352
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:06,458
I can extract the astral body
from anyone who's unconscious.

353
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:07,708
Other than myself.

354
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,791
Though if I don't put it
back within 44 seconds,

355
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,750
they're pretty screwed.

356
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,083
What are you waiting for?
Nendou's body's available.

357
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,625
Huh?

358
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:18,083
Whoa! This is crazy! My body
feels heavy, and I can touch it!

359
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,125
[SAIKI] Now you can tell her
how you feel yourself. So, go.

360
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,208
[NENDOU'S DAD] Just wish you'd
put me in a good-looking body.

361
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,666
[SAIKI]
Go!

362
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,666
[NENDOU'S DAD] All right,
I'm off to profess my love!

363
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,750
[SAIKI]
You have 30 seconds left.

364
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,000
[NENDOU'S DAD]
Hey, you!

365
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,791
Excuse me? That's no way
to speak to your mother!

366
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,125
I'm in love!

367
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,708
[MIDORI]
Hmm?

368
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,250
I don't know the right words to
say, but I'm absolutely smitten!

369
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,500
A single glance makes
my heart beat like a drum.

370
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,958
I'm telling you, I love...

371
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,833
[MIDORI]
Oh, no! Riki, what's wrong?

372
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,416
[SAIKI]
He departed?

373
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,750
Guess telling her how he felt
was what he'd left unresolved.

374
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,625
Well, rest in peace.

375
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,041
What was that all about?

376
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,458
So, my little boy's
becoming a man, huh?

377
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,833
I didn't realize the girl in
this magazine he was hiding

378
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,041
meant so much to him.
I should give it back.

379
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,250
You've got it wrong!

380
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,041
[SAIKI]
I said rest in peace.

381
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,416
[MERA] Oh, Saiki!
Didn't know you were here.

382
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,625
Thanks for spending so
much money at our café!

383
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,583
[SAIKI]
You need to work on your tact.

384
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,625
I've become a
regular at this café.

385
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,875
Their coffee and
coffee jelly aren't bad.

386
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:20,500
Plus, it's nice and quiet.
There aren't too many custom--

387
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:23,125
Oh. I'm the only one here.

388
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,791
We don't get many
customers these days.

389
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,666
Ever since that place opened up,
business has really slowed down.

390
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,416
My manager's taking
it pretty hard.

391
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,208
"Tall," my ass! And "Grande"?
It's "small" and "medium"!

392
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,833
Who are they trying to impress?

393
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,583
[MERA] He's furious one minute,
andt hen calm the next.

394
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,958
Cafés like this are
a thing of the past.

395
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,666
[MERA] And then he
just starts mocking them.

396
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,458
Yes, two Grande Strawberry
Macchiatos please!

397
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,125
[SAIKI]
Seems like an emotional wreck.

398
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:45,583
I had to apologize
a lot at first

399
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,500
'cause I was always
dropping plates and stuff.

400
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:48,833
But now I've learned
to apologize

401
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,375
before the dishes
even hit the floor!

402
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,291
[SAIKI] Maybe you should work
on not dropping them at all.

403
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:53,458
[MANAGER]
That's enough chitchat.

404
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:54,583
You're on the clock, you know.

405
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,166
I'm sorry!

406
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,750
[MANAGER] When you're not busy,
you should refill water glasses

407
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,458
and bus dirty plates from
other customers. Got it?

408
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:03,000
Yeah, but there's
no one else here, so...

409
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,833
[SAIKI]
Well, I should get home now.

410
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:06,708
You're going to that
new place, aren't you?

411
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,666
[SAIKI]
No, I'm going home.

412
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,958
I get so worried when
I think about how this café

413
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,416
could be going out
of business soon.

414
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,000
[MANAGER] Aw, Chisato.
Our shop means that much to you?

415
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,833
I can't memorize
all those sizes.

416
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,500
I mean, "Tall," "Grande,"
and "Piccolo"? Plus "Enorme"?

417
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,583
You'll work for the competition
as soon as we go bust?

418
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,000
[MERA] Well, I still
need to earn a living.

419
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,208
[MANAGER] It's all over!
Might as well close up shop now!

420
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,208
Hey, let's all brainstorm
ways to boost business

421
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,458
and win back customers!
We've got Saiki right here,

422
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,500
so we can ask him
what patrons want.

423
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,000
[SAIKI]
I just wanna pay.

424
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,541
[MERA] We'll now commence
the meeting to discuss

425
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,083
how to revive Café Mami.

426
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,583
Or how to drive that other
coffee shop out of business.

427
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,875
No, we can't do that
since I may have to work there.

428
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:42,000
[SAIKI]
What a pain.

429
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,875
I've actually been
thinking about this.

430
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,458
The exterior turns people off.

431
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,541
Plus, the name makes
it sound like it's a bar.

432
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,541
Maybe, but we don't have
the money to renovate.

433
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,333
[MERA] We don't have
to pay for renovations!

434
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:52,541
We can just cover up the front

435
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,416
with flyers advertising
our new low prices!

436
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,250
[SAIKI] That'll turn
people off even more.

437
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,500
[MANAGER] It's not a bad idea,
but we can't lower the prices.

438
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,625
[MERA] Don't worry,
we'll just lower 'em

439
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,958
by one yen to make
it seem cheaper!

440
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,125
[SAIKI]
Like a used car dealer.

441
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,875
All right then, I'm game!
Let's do this!

442
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,625
No! Don't be stupid!

443
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:07,083
[SAIKI]
This guy's a mess.

444
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,208
[MANAGER] I've kept the
prices the same for all 26 years

445
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,083
this place has been open,
and I'm proud of that!

446
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,375
I have no desire to lower
them, even by one yen!

447
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:14,625
Or see them raised.

448
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,041
[SAIKI] Sorry, I didn't
catch that last part.

449
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,916
But we do have to
make some changes.

450
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,291
If we were as modern
as that new place is...

451
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,958
Oh! How about we turn
this into a maid café?

452
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:23,875
Those are pretty unique!

453
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,291
[BOTH]
They <i>were</i> .

454
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,666
[MANAGER] We'll just put
you in a maid outfit, Chisato.

455
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,875
Huh?! No way!

456
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,333
I could give you a 20-yen raise.

457
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:32,541
[gasps] Make it 30, okay?

458
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,083
[MANAGER]
Looks good on you!

459
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,625
[SAIKI]
I'm never coming back.

460
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,125
On second thought, this outfit--

461
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,416
In fact, you look so good,
let's make it a 50-yen raise.

462
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,958
Welcome home, master.

463
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,500
[SAIKI]
She's getting into it now.

464
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:48,458
[MERA] But can you really afford
to give me that big a raise?

465
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:49,833
Oh, yeah, it'll be fine.

466
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,833
I'll just raise all the
prices by a hundred yen.

467
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,166
[SAIKI]
What happened to your pride?

468
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,833
Ah! Then we can use
my 99-yen idea from earlier!

469
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:56,833
[MANAGER]
Ooh, perfect!

470
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,750
Hey, we're doin'
pretty well here!

471
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,666
[MERA]
Now let's start making flyers!

472
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,458
[door closes]

473
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:03,041
[BOTH]
Huh?

474
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:05,666
[SAIKI] Sure, I could easily use
my powers to bring customers in.

475
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,125
But even if it's to help
a café I like going to,

476
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,791
why should I bother?
That place has no future.

477
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,625
Huh, I guess Saiki
musta gone home.

478
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,166
Yeah, I wonder why he left.

479
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,166
[MERA] Well, what should
we change up next?

480
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,666
We could redecorate the
inside and make it look cute.

481
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,375
Or better yet, change
the name of our coffee

482
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:23,041
to something catchy like
"Angel's Sweet Respite"!

483
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:23,791
[MANAGER]
No.

484
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:24,666
Huh?

485
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,583
I think. I'll keep it as it is.

486
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:29,416
We may have fewer customers
now, but they still come.

487
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,875
And for the sake
of our regulars,

488
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,625
I don't want to change anything.

489
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,125
Sure!

490
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,916
We'll stay true to ourselves
till the day we go belly up!

491
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,333
[MANAGER]
Wait, what?

492
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,875
[SAIKI] Good decision.
People aren't stupid. They know.

493
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,625
No matter how
unstable that guy is,

494
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:44,416
his coffee and coffee jelly
have always been great.

495
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,375
And that's the mark
of a true professional.

496
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:47,791
[MAN A]
Hey, I like this place.

497
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:50,125
They've got good coffee,
and it's quiet, too.

498
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:51,625
[MAN B]
Man, I ain't been here in ages.

499
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,166
Aw, they're closed?

500
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,333
[MAN A] What? But I was really
craving their coffee jelly.

501
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:56,250
[SAIKI]
Oh, fine.

502
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:56,791
[click]

503
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,291
[MAN B]
Huh?

504
00:17:58,375 --> 00:17:59,250
[SAIKI] Guess it couldn't hurt
to give 'em a little help.

505
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:00,666
[MAN A]
Hey, they're open now!

506
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,500
Let's go in!

507
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:04,625
[SAIKI]
Now, who's gonna win?

508
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:05,708
[TERUHASHI]
Why, me, of course!

509
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:07,625
[SAIKI]
I'm still not saying "Oh, wow."

510
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,166
Ah, I see.

511
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,916
Forensics has revealed that this
in fact Mister Hattori's blood,

512
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,708
which means the golf club
was the murder weapon.

513
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,250
[YAMANAKA]
Damn it!

514
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,208
There's no mystery so opaque
that I cannot see through it.

515
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:25,000
[KAIDOU] For I am
the Magic Eye Detective.

516
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,291
Shun Kaidou!

517
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:29,875
You stupid or somethin'?

518
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,416
[KAIDOU] I don't want to
hear that coming from you!

519
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,000
[SAIKI] Ah, he's been
watching that show,

520
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,958
<i>Joker, the Magic Eye Detective</i> .

521
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:37,250
It's pretty popular right now,
but I couldn't get into it.

522
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,666
Maybe it's 'cause of
that dumb catchphrase

523
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,375
they keep trying to make happen.

524
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:41,875
Ah, I see.

525
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:42,916
[SAIKI]
He says it every episode.

526
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,041
It's annoying.

527
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,958
And worse,
he's played by Toru Mugami,

528
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,000
so that's another reason
for me not to watch.

529
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,500
Ah, I see.

530
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,541
[SAIKI] But it looks
like Kaidou is all in.

531
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:52,875
Ah, I see.

532
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,708
[SAIKI]
That's not how he says it.

533
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,375
[KAIDOU]
There's a commotion.

534
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:58,500
[KAIDOU grunts]

535
00:18:58,583 --> 00:18:59,833
It sounds like it's
being caused by...

536
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:02,291
My eye! It's twitching!
I smell a big crime here!

537
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:05,541
[SAIKI]
Is it your ears, eye, or nose?

538
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,250
Whoa! The glass is broken!

539
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,708
[SAIKI]
Who did this?

540
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:09,916
Ah, I see!

541
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,958
[SAIKI]
He seems happy.

542
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,333
[KAIDOU]
Inspector Hairo!

543
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,166
Oh, hey, there! Good morning,
Kaidou! "Inspector"?

544
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,125
Tell me what we know
about the case so far.

545
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,666
[HAIRO]
Well, I don't know much myself,

546
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,333
but I heard Mister Matsuzaki
was the one who discovered it.

547
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:21,583
He noticed first
thing this morning

548
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,125
when he came
to unlock the doors.

549
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,208
He was also the last person
to lock up last night,

550
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,333
and he says the door wasn't
broken when he left here.

551
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,750
So then, it occurred sometime
between when he went home

552
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,125
at 11 o'clock last night

553
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:32,708
and when he got back
to school at five this morning.

554
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,041
[SAIKI]
You actually know a lot.

555
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:35,791
[KAIDOU]
Anything else seem strange?

556
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,166
Well, I heard the vase

557
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,083
that was in front of the
principal's office is gone.

558
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,625
[KAIDOU]
Ah, I see.

559
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,333
The perp waited
for Matsuzaki to leave,

560
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:45,333
and then broke the glass door
in order to get inside.

561
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:48,166
All so he could steal the
principal's cherished vase,

562
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,333
the treasure he was
really after this entire time!

563
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:52,750
[SAIKI] Yeah, everyone figured
that out, Mister Detective.

564
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,458
Well, the police can handle
it now. I'll file a report.

565
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,416
[SAIKI] I thought you
were the detective here?

566
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,166
[HAIRO] It may not be
as simple as that, though.

567
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,458
See all that broken glass?
Doesn't something look off?

568
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:02,583
Ah-ha! Of course!

569
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:03,166
[HAIRO]
Right?

570
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,416
T.K. Takahashi?

571
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,083
No, no, not that. Notice
how most of the shards

572
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,750
are on the outside,
not the inside?

573
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,208
Huh? Oh! You mean that!

574
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,708
[HAIRO] If it was broken
from the inside,

575
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:14,500
the only one who could've
done it was Mister Matsuzaki.

576
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,583
[KAIDOU]
Where... is... he... now?

577
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:17,833
[HAIRO]
In the principal's office.

578
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,708
They realized what
the situation was earlier.

579
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:22,000
But he's refusing to say
anything about the vase.

580
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,125
Oh, so Matsuzaki
broke the glass door?

581
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,500
[SAIKI] Not sure. To be honest,
I can't tell who did it.

582
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:27,541
[KAIDOU]
My eye is twitching.

583
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:28,750
[TAKAHASHI]
Hey, move it!

584
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,166
[KAIDOU]
T.K.hashi!

585
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,666
Go find somewhere else to
crouch, you're in my way!

586
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,041
What's wrong with your hands?

587
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,125
[TAKAHASHI grunts]

588
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,458
[TAKAHASHI]
Nothin'! Just some cuts!

589
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,750
[KAIDOU] Huh. Seems
like he's hiding something.

590
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,041
"Just some cuts"?

591
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,166
Hey, man! Matsuzaki
scold you good yesterday?

592
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,541
You said you'd come find us
afterwards, but you never did.

593
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,166
[TAKAHASHI]
I mean, something came up.

594
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,708
[KAIDOU]
"Scold"? "Something"?

595
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:48,666
[gasps] Takahashi is the perp!

596
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,750
[TAKAHASHI]
What?

597
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:50,625
What's the matter
with you, Kaidou?

598
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,083
Even if it is just Takahashi,

599
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,750
it's not nice to throw out
wild accusations like that!

600
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,708
[SAIKI] Yeah, I don't
think that's nice, either.

601
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,583
What the hell are
you people talking about?

602
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,125
I'm talking about how
you took the vase

603
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,791
from the principal's
office, didn't you?

604
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:01,875
[yelp]

605
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,583
That reaction was
like a confession!

606
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:04,541
Is it true? Did you?

607
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:05,958
[TAKAHASHI]
How did you know?

608
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,208
[chuckles] Your hands told me.
Here's what happened.

609
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:11,000
You were mad at Matsuzaki
for scolding you yesterday.

610
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,500
So, when you broke
into the school last night,

611
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,250
you moved some of
the glass shards outside

612
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,291
in order to
incriminate Matsuzaki!

613
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,541
[chuckling]

614
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,375
And that's how you got
those mysterious cuts

615
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,666
all over your hands.

616
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,083
On top of that, it's clear

617
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,000
that you're still carrying
the stolen vase with you!

618
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,458
Ah! There it is!

619
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,333
[grunts] Wait. Huh?

620
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:29,541
I still don't know what
you guys are talking about.

621
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,000
[KAIDOU]
Huh?

622
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,250
[MALE PRINCIPAL A]
In addition...

623
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,791
[BOTH]
I'm so sorry, sir!

624
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,250
[TAKAHASHI] When Mister
Matsuzaki was scolding me

625
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,500
yesterday, I got so startled,
I broke your vase.

626
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,083
[MATSUZAKI] Then I promised
to apologize with him

627
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:40,375
if he fixed it.

628
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:41,958
That's why I couldn't say
anything until now.

629
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,458
[TAKAHASHI, MATSUZAKI]
I sincerely apologize!

630
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:46,208
In addition, don't
worry about it you two.

631
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:47,541
So, Takahashi got those cuts

632
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:49,333
when he was fixing
the vase, huh?

633
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:52,000
Yeah, okay, but then who
the heck broke the glass door?

634
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,500
[SAIKI]
I can answer that.

635
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:56,125
I finally figured it out using
psychometry on the glass.

636
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:57,500
See, last night,

637
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,041
I remembered that I'd
left my umbrella at school.

638
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,833
So, I apported it with
a tennis ball of equal value.

639
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:03,791
But the tennis ball got wedged
into the umbrella rack

640
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:08,166
in a precarious manner,
causing it to shoot out.

641
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,666
The culprit is me.
I sincerely apologize.

642
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:45,250
[SAIKI] Seriously,
all I want is to be left alone,

643
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:46,625
and yet here I am,

644
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:48,958
stuck with another annoying
person joining the gang.

645
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:53,208
[SAIKI] Next time on <i>The</i>
<i>Disastrous Life of Saiki K.</i> ,

646
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:55,750
get ready for the
fall school event episodes.
