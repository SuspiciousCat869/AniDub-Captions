00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,000
Hey, Kuusuke! How's it--?

153
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:01,958
Hey there, Kusuo.

154
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,625
Looks like
you're doing well.

155
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,166
[SAIKI] If I were,
I wouldn't be here.

156
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,208
[KUUSUKE] Been a while, Dad?
What? Yeah!

157
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,625
[KUUSUKE] Did you gain weight?
[KUNIHARU] I'm here.

158
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,541
Just kidding. How've you been?
Oh, fine.

159
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,000
[SAIKI]
Look at him toying with Dad.

160
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,708
I really hate being
around my brother.

161
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,875
Kusuo's control device
is completely broken now.

162
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,916
[SAIKI] At first glance,
he doesn't seem so bad.

163
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,875
Well, even if I manage
to fix it,

164
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:23,666
that's never gonna resolve the
underlying problem with him.

165
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,458
[SAIKI] My brother isn't worried
about me one bit.

166
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:29,041
The reason I don't like him
is that he doesn't like me.

167
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,166
...slip up in there
since I don't like Kusuo.

168
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,541
[SAIKI] But it's only natural
that he resents me.

169
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,000
Eighteen years ago,

170
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,791
an ordinary couple
welcomed a baby boy

171
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,291
into the world.
You're so darn cute.

172
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,708
[SAIKI] The reason why
my parents weren't surprised

173
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,958
when I was born was because
they already had my brother.

174
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,875
See, when he was only
a month old--

175
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:45,916
I grasp it.

176
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,541
[SAIKI]
--he spoke his first words.

177
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,833
By age 2, he'd mastered
simple calculations

178
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:53,375
and could read and write.
A test said his IQ was 218.

179
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,541
Basically, he was a genius.

180
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:55,916
But at the age of 3,

181
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,708
that genius would already hit
a big wall.

182
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,125
I'm bored of this puzzle now.

183
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,000
I think I'll read
<i>Young Jump</i> instead.

[crashing]

185
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:04,000
[SAIKI] That wall was none other
than me.

186
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,375
He felt humiliated.

187
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,750
As he projected his jealousy,
inferiority complex,

188
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:10,541
and hatred onto me,
I started to dislike him too.

189
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,041
Then, when he was 14...

190
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,708
A younger brother never
surpasses his older brother.

191
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:18,208
...he uttered that phrase
and left to go study in the UK.

192
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,750
It's been four years

193
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,625
and I haven't seen him
even once since then.

194
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:24,250
[chuckles]
I'm kidding.

195
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,583
I could never hate
my precious baby brother.

196
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,250
You brought the parts.
Let me have a look.

197
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,583
[SAIKI] I'm wearing
my telepathy-blocking ring.

198
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,208
I don't know if he means that.

[SAIKI] Don't tell me.

You lost your bag?

201
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,416
And I'm guessing
all of the parts

202
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,000
for the control device
were in it?

203
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,625
[KUNIHARU] And the travel guide
with the tourist spots! No!

204
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,791
[SAIKI] Why does that matter?
I know for sure I had it

205
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,250
when we arrived in England.

206
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,750
[SAIKI] In other words,
you don't remember anything?

207
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,333
At least we know
it's in London.

208
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:50,916
That's all the information
I need.

209
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,625
[KUNIHARU] What's that?
[KUUSUKE] From the city's CCTV.

210
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,291
The UK is a total
surveillance state now.

211
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,916
They've got cameras installed
in every nook and cranny.

212
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,291
They even caught you picking
your nose an hour ago.

213
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,625
[KUNIHARU] Don't look!
Wait, I still have the bag!

214
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,791
Where'd we go after that?
Maybe the souvenir shop.

215
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,833
[KUNIHARU] How'd you know?
What you're wearing.

216
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,708
You had on a different one
an hour ago.

217
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:11,166
You must've bought it some time
after that and changed.

218
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,791
But you don't have the clothes
you were originally wearing,

219
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,416
which means
you still had the bag then.

220
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,791
So the only possible place
is here at the London Eye.

221
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,291
They check bags
before you get on,

222
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,666
so if you had it here,
it should be at the bag check.

223
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,375
[KUNIHARU]
Woo-hoo, I found it!

224
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,791
Now then, get to it,
Kuusuke.

225
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,666
Well, I'll try my best.
[KURUMI] Please do.

You fixed it already?

Yeah,
wasn't too complicated.

00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,833
[KUNIHARU] Whoa! Kusuo's back
on his feet, good as new!

[SAIKI] Huh, he fixed it
without making a big fuss.

But a superficial gesture
of good will won't work on me.

Huh? Wait, what's going on?
What's wrong?

Is something not working
for you, Kusuo?

I'm an ordinary person

that I have a little brother

I refused to give up,
challenging him over and over,

yet still, I was never able
to win even once.

270
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,958
When I was in the seventh grade,
I created a device

00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,750
that would weaken
my brother's powers.

lost all hope,
skipped several grades

and escaped to the University
of Cambridge in England.

received a master's degree.

Since then, I've spent
all my time researching

Why are you acting like that?

[KUNIHARU]
Well, see you!

Heh.
Those two never change, huh?

I'm not interested
in visiting your lab.

[SAIKI] Don't ignore me.
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,083
Oh, look at that.
I lost, huh?

309
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,166
[SAIKI] Are you happy now?
I'm going back.

310

[KUUSUKE] I'm zero
for 725 against you

You've thrown rock less often
than the other two.

313
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,208
Now I think about it, that's
because I used scissors least.

A hundred four times,
to be exact.

No, it can't be.

Oh, I see you've noticed.
That's right.

[NENDOU]
Whoa! Check it out, runt!

The buildings look
like the kind in manga!

Why were we brought all the way
here for some surprise?

Ah! Could be a trap set
by Dark Reunion?

[SAIKI] Ugh. What the hell
are they doing here?

"Kusuo's coming to London.

How'd you like to go too
and surprise him?"

00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,625
I sent plane tickets
and everything.

[SAIKI] They'd never fall for
something obvious-- Actually.

339
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,041
So why'd you bring them here?

340
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:22,541
Play a game with me, Kusuo.

A game?

00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,875
[KUUSUKE]
A game of tag across London.

343

I lost at rock, paper, scissors
so I'll be it.

what happens to those guys.

On my signal,
they'll be whisked away

We're gonna play tag now.

He was surprised.

It was a success.
[KAIDOU] That's it?

Something very important
is at stake.

[KAIDOU] It's folly to challenge
me in this child's game,

00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,958
I'm used to being pursued
by Dark Reunion,

but it could be interesting,
so I'll play.

It looks like
they still haven't noticed yet.

[KAIDOU] Doesn't this seem
a little too easy?

London is bigger than all 23
of Tokyo's wards put together.

[SAIKI] There are probably lots
of cameras in the subway too,

387
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,291
but it is efficient
traveling long distances.

Hey, where we going?
We're gonna use the subway.

Huh. The gate's closed.

Bus, taxi, subway.

[SAIKI] He knew the whole time.
How about a bus or taxi?

The bus line goes on
forever.

396
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,458
If we don't move,
we'll be caught.

[SAIKI] Yeah, probably sooner
than you think.

all the cameras,

so we should be okay.

In fact,
moving around haphazardly

415

can only help him find us.

How did he find us

when we were avoiding
the cameras?

422
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,541
That was fast.
Maybe he's got psychic powers.

[SAIKI] No, that's me.
Maybe he planted a transmitter?

How stupid could I be?

where we are now,
