1
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,041
[SAIKI] Kokomi Teruhashi
is universally acknowledged

2
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:47,000
to be the absolute,
perfect pretty girl.

3
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:50,083
[TERUHASHI] Heh. Won't you be
surprised to see me?

4
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:54,041
No, I can't do it!

5
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:55,666
Come on,
get it together, Kokomi.

6
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,458
After all, you didn't
come here to see Saiki.

7
00:01:57,541 --> 00:02:00,250
You came to get cooking lessons
from his mother.

8
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:01,583
Oh, no, I rang
the neighbor's bell.

9
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:03,041
[SAIKI]
However, there is something

10
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:04,625
that even
she can't deal with.

11
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,750
[TERUHASHI] I'm sorry,
I rang your bell by mistake.

12
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:08,083
Hey, who are you?

13
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:09,375
[SAIKI]
And that would be children.

14
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:10,750
[TERUHASHI]
I'm sorry.

15
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:12,250
I went to the wrong house.

16
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,250
He saw me
and then ran away?

17
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,250
[SAIKI] Her beauty has
no effect on children.

18
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:17,625
Hey, what are you--?

19
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,541
Here, come quick,
Cyborg Cider-man Number Two.

20
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:20,958
[SAIKI]
Hey, let go. Seriously.

21
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,625
[YUUTA] Look, there's
a strange lady here.

22
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,041
[TERUHASHI]
Saiki, what are you--?

23
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,375
[SAIKI]
Everything goes her way.

24
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:27,416
I sensed her coming,
so I fled next door.

25
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,916
I never thought
she'd show up here.

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,125
[KURUMI] Oh, hi there, Kokomi.
Nice to see you again.

27
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,416
Sorry it's been so long.

28
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,083
Aw, and you've got Yuuta
with you.

29
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:36,791
You two look like
a married couple.

30
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:38,916
Huh? What? No!
What are you trying to say?

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,250
[SAIKI]
Give it a rest, Mom.

32
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,083
[KURUMI] So, do you have a date
with Kuu today?

33
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,583
No, no, no.
Remember, a while back

34
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,583
you offered to give me
a cooking lesson, so here I am.

35
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,666
Just for lessons.
[KURUMI] You came to see me?

36
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,583
That makes me so happy.
I'll go set up then.

37
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:50,958
I'm sorry
to just barge in.

38
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,916
Married couple?
Yeah, right.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
There's no way a girl like me
would ever wind up

40
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,208
with a guy like Saiki.

41
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,583
I mean, give me a break.

42
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,583
Why's that kid
staring at me?

43
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:04,000
Oh, of course,
I must be his first crush.

44
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,291
Well, hello, Yuuta.

45
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,416
[shudders]
[TERUHASHI] You little brat!

46
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,833
Oh, right,
I've got this.

47
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,208
I brought cake.

48
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,750
Does that sound like something
you might like?

49
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,416
Cake?
[TERUHASHI] He took the bait!

50
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,000
There's an extra one for Yuuta
if he wants it.

51
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,291
[YUUTA] Yay! Cake! Cake!
[TERUHASHI] Good thing that guy

52
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:18,708
at the pastry shop
threw in a free one.

53
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,375
Wow, they look delicious.
[TERUHASHI] What?

54
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,291
That's what he gave me?

55
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,833
I guess this one must be
for Kuu, huh?

56
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:25,958
No, no, no! I just told them to
give me whatever they had.

57
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:28,125
I didn't pick it out,
so it doesn't mean anything.

58
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,375
[KURUMI]
Oh, all right.

59
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,458
You can have whichever one
you like.

60
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:32,875
[YUUTA] Yay!
[TERUHASHI] Of all things,

61
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,625
I can't believe they gave me
a heart cake.

62
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:38,000
Still, I hope that's the one
that Saiki chooses.

63
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,791
Yummy. It's my favoritest kind.

64
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,166
[scoffs]

65
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,375
Boy, that was great.

66
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:44,958
[KURUMI]
As delicious as it looked.

67
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:47,083
[SAIKI] Wasn't bad.
[TERUHASHI] Glad you liked it.

68
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,416
Did you enjoy that, Yuuta?

69
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,750
Yep, it's the kind I like most.

70
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,625
Then you should say thank you
to Kokomi.

71
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,500
Okay. Thank you
for the cake, ma'am.

72
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,833
[TERUHASHI]
Ah! Who are you calling "ma'am?"

73
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:58,083
Me? How old do you think I am?
[SAIKI] You're overreacting.

74
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,500
[TERUHASHI] This rude little
pipsqueak just said number four

75
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,833
on my list of things no one
will ever say to me!

76
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,666
[SAIKI]
That's a weird list.

77
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,375
[phone rings]
[KURUMI] The phone's ringing.

78
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:07,833
[TERUHASHI]
This will not go unpunished.

79
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,500
I'll get my revenge
10 years from now,

80
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,041
when you can appreciate
my beauty.

81
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,583
Oh, man, I'm so bored.

82
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,708
[TERUHASHI] I'll strut up
to you, all sexy-like.

83
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,916
[YUUTA]
Who's that beautiful goddess?

84
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,333
I-- I love you.

85
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,125
[TERUHASHI]
And then I'll whisper softly.

86
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,416
Oh, no, we can't be together.
After all, I'm an old lady.

87
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,125
In your face!

88
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,375
[SAIKI] I really don't enjoy
seeing Teruhashi like this,

89
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:29,458
but I might be able to use this
as a weapon against her.

90
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,333
Oh, I'm sorry,
I forgot that I had to go

91
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,958
to the Neighborhood Association
meeting.

92
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,041
[TERUHASHI] That's okay,
I'll come back some other time.

93
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,458
If you don't mind waiting, it
should only take half an hour.

94
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,500
Kuu, entertain her
while I'm gone.

95
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:42,333
[TERUHASHI] That means
I'll be all alone with Saiki...

96
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:43,958
except for the brat.

97
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,208
Hey, can we watch some TV now?
[TERUHASHI] Watch at your house.

98
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,458
Oh, nothing. Come on,
let's watch some TV, okay?

99
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:49,958
I need to be careful.

100
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,375
Can't get worked up
over a child.

101
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,916
Now we can have
a grown-up conversation

102
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,541
while the twerp's busy
watching TV.

103
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:55,958
So, do you like children?

104
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,166
I love 'em.

105
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,375
You're watching it with him?

106
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,166
Seriously,
what are you doing, Saiki?

107
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,125
So much for our
grown-up conversation.

108
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,375
He's pretty cool, huh?

109
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,750
Be quiet,
I'm trying to watch.

110
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,791
[TERUHASHI] He just said
number 31 on my list!

111
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,750
[SAIKI]
How long is this list?

112
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,875
Um, I just remembered something,
so I'm gonna go home now.

113
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,125
Okay, bye.

114
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,250
Please apologize
to your mom for me.

115
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,041
[SAIKI]
I feel bad, but it worked.

116
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:22,000
I owe Yuuta a coffee jelly.

117
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,958
<i>You just leave the protecting</i>
<i>to me, Cider-Man.</i>

118
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,625
[CIDER-MAN]
<i>That sweet scent, it must be--</i>

119
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:28,208
<i>Go on ahead and take care</i>
<i>of Baron Cola.</i>

120
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,291
[CIDER-MAN] <i>I'm counting on you,</i>
<i>Peach T Girl.</i>

121
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,750
[SAIKI]
Hey, what are you thinking?

122
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,333
They're two totally
different people.

123
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,916
[YUUTA] That's the girl
who was just here!

124
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,583
[SAIKI] They look nothing alike.
[YUUTA] Come back, Peach T Girl!

125
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:41,666
[SAIKI] Looks like Yuuta
has a new obsession.

126
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,875
[SAIKI]
I forgot my wallet at home.

127
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,916
A normal person would be
freaking out right now,

128
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,625
but I'm a psychic.

129
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:56,291
All I have to do is duck into
the bathroom and teleport home.

130
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:57,708
Not a problem.

131
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,500
There are plenty
of other ways.

132
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,708
I just thought of 182.

133
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:04,416
Only problem is,
they're all either illegal

134
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,791
or highly immoral.

135
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,625
So I won't be doing
any of those.

136
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:10,625
Causing trouble for others
goes against my principles.

137
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,625
Unfortunately, I can't think
of any safe methods

138
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,000
given where I am.

139
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,375
There are people everywhere,

140
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,916
and they all have a clear view
of my table.

141
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,041
Plus, of all days, I had to pick
today to wear this.

142
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,416
It makes me stand out,

143
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,041
which means I can't teleport
from here.

144
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,625
And making myself transparent
takes at least a minute.

145
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:28,000
Maybe I can use telepathy to ask
someone to bring me money.

146
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,250
I could ask Mom.

147
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:30,666
Kuu, you need money?
What happened?

148
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,625
Are you all right?
I emptied out our bank account--

149
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,583
[SAIKI] No, I don't wanna
worry her. What about Dad?

150
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:37,916
Kusuo, you gotta be more
responsible, kid, you big goof.

151
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,500
[SAIKI]
No, that'd be annoying.

152
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,291
What about Nendou,
Kaidou, or Toritsuka?

153
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:42,583
Out of the question.

154
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:43,916
It's not that I mind
bothering them,

155
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,375
it's just that I'd rather die

156
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,000
than ask any of them
for a favor.

157
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,583
That leaves only
one method: apport.

158
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,625
The perfect solution
for this situation.

159
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,791
But I need to send something
of equal value

160
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,000
in exchange for what
I apport here.

161
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,708
And even
in a post-apocalyptic world,

162
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,000
these wouldn't be worth
980 yen.

163
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,125
But there's
a loophole I can use.

164
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,875
See, what you send doesn't have
to have the exact same value

165
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:04,875
as what you get.

166
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,416
There's a little wiggle room,

167
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,916
so you can exchange
a 100-yen item

168
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,875
for something anywhere
in the 90-to-110-yen range.

169
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:13,583
If I start with 100 yen,
I can get to 980

170
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,000
in as few as 25 exchanges.

171
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,375
That's a lot.

172
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,416
How many times will it take
if I start with 2 yen?

173
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,583
I need something
of higher value.

174
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,750
Clothes could work,
but can't use my pants.

175
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,958
Can't use this cardigan either.
Too noticeable.

176
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,458
[WAITER]
How about "Zebra Cardie"?

177
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,083
[SAIKI] Waiters are already
coming up

178
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,125
with a nickname based on it.
They'd definitely notice.

179
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,041
Not wearing a shirt
would be awkward too.

180
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,500
Can't even imagine the nicknames
they'd come up with then.

181
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:37,041
Guess I'll have
to lose those.

182
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:40,875
Feels breezy down there
without my socks.

183
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,125
Oh, what did you think
I was talking about?

184
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,750
There's no way
I'd do something as stupid

185
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,583
as exchanging
my own underwear.

186
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,125
The last time 500 yen seemed
this valuable to me

187
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,500
was in second grade.

188
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:53,208
Now to exchange it for something
worth 550 yen.

189
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:54,458
Apport.

190
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:55,958
Okay...apport.

191
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:58,875
That's odd.
Why is there underwear in here?

192
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:01,458
[SAIKI] Okay. I've increased
the value by 100 yen.

193
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,250
Now let's keep going.
Apport.

194
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,291
This is <i>The Disastrous Life</i>
<i>of Saiki K.</i>

195
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,833
<i>Extra Story of Psychics.</i>

196
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:09,750
I bought it on impulse,
since the name matches mine.

197
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,250
Weird coincidence, huh?

198
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:14,125
But wait, this was on
my bookshelf, which means...

199
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,291
Eh, probably best
not to think about it.

200
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,000
Next is...oops.

201
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:21,125
There's nothing at home that
cost between 650 and 715 yen.

202
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:25,208
I have no choice. I have to
cause trouble for them. Apport.

203
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,125
You called about pitching
your manga, right?

204
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:28,583
Right, that's me.

205

[KUNIHARU] Then let's see
what you've got.

206

Um, I don't really wanna see
what you've got.

207
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:35,916
[SAIKI]
So this is Dad's belt.

208
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,625
I guess he did buy
a pretty cheap one.

209
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,583
But moving on. Apport.

210

Alrighty, it's chow time.

Hey, Kaidou, what are you doing

spectacular, and her-- Huh? Pi?

from the Editorial Department?

[KUNIHARU]
What? Of course I am.

nothing for a psychic to fear.

00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,541
Are you trying to sneak away?

607
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,416
- [SAIKI] I'm not doing this.
- A duet?

608
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,791
[all scream]

609
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,333
[BOY]
I gotta go to the bathroom!

610
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:07,708
[GIRL]
Me, too. I'm about to burst!

611
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:09,291
[SAIKI]
Finally I can eat.

612
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:11,750
Yeah, buddy, let's jam!

613
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,541
[singing in Japanese]

614
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:43,958
[SAIKI] To recap,
I forgot my wallet,

615
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:46,250
shrunk down to tiny size,
and almost went wild.

616
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:47,708
Another crazy episode.

617
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:49,500
But I got to eat
a grand chocolate parfait,

618
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:51,125
so it wasn't all bad.

619
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:53,291
On the next <i>Disastrous Life</i>
<i>of Saiki K.,</i>

620
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:56,041
we'll go to the countryside, and
you get to meet my grandparents.
