on festival day.

Hell, no.
[TORITSUKA] Here's our lineup.

158
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,083
On lead guitar,
Takeru.

159
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,375
Takayuki,
thunder broom.

160
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,875
Shinya,
keeping the beat.

161
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:17,958
And me, lead vocals!

162
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:19,750
But when assembled,
you can call us,

163
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,333
Eternal Diamond Veronica!

164
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:22,708
[silence]

165
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:24,583
[SAIKI] That's nice.
Wait, bro, we need you

166
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,166
to perform with us.
[SAIKI] Not a chance.

167
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,541
Why not? Do you prefer
a different kind of music?

168
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,458
[SAIKI] I prefer
a different kind of person.

169
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:31,875
Besides,
five's too crowded.

170
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,291
Band size might be
the least of our problems.

171
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,791
[SAIKI] None of you know
how to play?

172
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,958
[TORITSUKA] When we started,
Takeru was the singer,

173
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,125
but since he dislocates his jaw
on high notes,

174
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,458
we moved him to guitar.

175
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,125
Takayuki doesn't even know
what a bass is.

176
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,500
He tried to blow in it.
Shinya's only played drums

177
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,333
in that one video game
no one plays anymore.

178
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,666
[SAIKI]
You're all delusional.

179
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,208
I can't play anything,
either,

180
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:52,458
but that's no problem
when you're the front man.

181
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,041
[SAIKI]
That attitude is a problem.

182
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,708
[SAIKI] Why even bother forming
a band if none of you can play?

183
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,333
To rock the sheets with girls!

184
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,000
What other reason is there
to start a band?

185
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,666
[SAIKI]
The only thing rock about you

186
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,500
is your confidence.
[TORITSUKA] Anyway,

187
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,125
since we get worse
every time we practice,

188
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,083
you could use your powers
to make us awesome.

189
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:08,750
[SAIKI] You're pathetic
and naïve.

190
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:11,083
Why should I use
my powers to help you?

191
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,750
Wow. That school trip
to Okinawa sure was nuts.

192
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,250
Would suck for
the school to learn

thanks to a sleeping psychic.

194
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,541
[SAIKI] What? Are you trying
to threaten me?

195
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,000
You're certainly
courageous.

I was just talking to myself.

198
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,333
I do owe him for
helping me on Okinawa.
