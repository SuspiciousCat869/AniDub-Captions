622
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,125
What's so great
about seeing naked bodies?

623
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,916
[KAIDOU] They're foggy.
[SAIKI] I see 'em

624
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,166
all the time, and they
don't seem that special.

625

[NENDOU]
This thing is amazing!

626
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,166
[TAKAHASHI] Shut up, Nendou!

627
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,166
And get your grubby--
[all gasp]

628

It's not possible.

One, two. Good evening!

Let's play <i>Uno!</i>

00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,375
A bunch of guys showed up
at our room for some reason,

636
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,000
so is it cool
if we hang out in yours?

637
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,625
[YUMEHARA]
That was perfect!

638
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,375
[TERUHASHI]
Yeah, we nailed the timing!

639
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,625
[YUMEHARA] That's enough
practice, let's go for it!

[SAIKI] Sorry, girls,
but I'm not really into <i>Uno.</i>

00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,333
I should be safe here.

Man, I'm beat.

644
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:53,583
When I made
that typhoon disappear

645
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:54,958
and when I carried
the plane,

646
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,166
I removed my
control device both times,

647
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,250
so it's gonna be
a long trip.

Oh! Saiki!
Is he asleep?

652
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,583
Yes!
This is my chance!

653
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,625
Before he wakes up.

654
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,208
Wait, what was I just
about to do?

655
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,500
How could I, the world's
most perfect pretty girl,

656
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,666
do the kind of thing
a creepy, gross, unpopular guy

657
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,166
would do to a girl
like me?

658
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,041
[KURUMI]
Wonder if Kuu's doing okay.

659
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,041
Why is that?

660
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:22,458
He might have an accident.

661
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,166
He hasn't done that
since fourth grade.

662
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,625
[KURUMI] Was it
the fifth grade?

663
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,166
Around the time
he started wearing

664
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,250
that thing on his head.
[KUNIHARU] You're right.

665
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:31,708
If that's what's preventing him
from having an accident,

666
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,208
what'll happen
if it comes off?

667
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,791
Heh, heh! You worry
too much, honey.

668
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,083
Guess you're right.

[TERUHASHI] Here we go.
Hope it's okay

670
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:39,666
I took it off
without asking.

671
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,333
But if he fell on it,
this hairpin

672
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:44,333
could really
hurt him, so-- Huh?

673
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:46,375
Saiki, wake up!
We got a big problem!

674

[SAIKI] What?
I must've fallen asleep.

This is no time
to be taking a nap!

676
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:52,375
[SAIKI] Stop yelling in my ear.
What time is it?

677
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:53,666
We have to return
to the hotel.

678
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,458
You mean
return the hotel!

679
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:57,416
[SAIKI] What? No, I meant
return to the hotel.

680
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,083
Now calm down.
[TORITSUKA] Calm down?

681
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:00,500
Are you out of
your mind?

682
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,208
The hotel we were
staying in is gone!

683
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:03,791
And I've got
a pretty good feeling

684
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,500
that you're
behind this somehow!
