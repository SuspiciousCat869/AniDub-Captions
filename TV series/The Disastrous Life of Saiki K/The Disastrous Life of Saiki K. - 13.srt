1
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:44,875
[SAIKI] When I woke up,
our hotel had vanished!

2
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:46,416
Is this all your fault, Saiki?

3
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,958
What happened to
everyone inside the building?

4
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,958
Did you just kill an
entire high school class?

5
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:52,416
[SAIKI] Shut up. I have
to concentrate on bringing back

6
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,250
the hotel exactly how it was.

7
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,500
Looks like it came off the
foundation in one piece,

8
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,166
so everyone should be alive.

9
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,375
Had I used psychokinesis,
they'd all be dead.

10
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:03,166
I must've just teleported
it somewhere else.

11
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,500
Hey, Saiki, I see
something down there!

12
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,416
How can you be sure
everyone's still alive?

13
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,625
[SAIKI]
Well, I'm pretty sure.

14
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:10,416
I mean, in all
likelihood they're fine.

15
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,125
Look, there's nothing there.

16
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:15,125
Aaaah! They are dead!
You killed them, you jerk!

17
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:17,166
And not just the dumb guys,
but all the hotties, too!

18
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,250
[SAIKI] Calm down. These aren't
our classmates from the hotel.

19
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:22,458
High school girls are
a treasure that... Uh?

20
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:24,208
Augh! What the hell is that?

21
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,166
[SAIKI] An old shipwreck,
and if it's here,

22
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,083
it must contain treasure
equal in value to the hotel.

23
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:31,625
In paranormal terms,
the two objects switched places

24
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:35,833
or "apported," which means
the hotel is now--at sea!

25
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:38,791
Weird. Guess the power
was out. That sucks.

26
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,833
I don't sleep well
if it's pitch black.

27
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:43,125
[KASHIMURA] Maybe they turn
off the power for "lights-out"?

28
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:44,500
[ZOLBE] Whoa. Do you
think they would do that?

29
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,541
[MATSUO] Power-schmower,
let's talk about girls!

30
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,291
[ZOLBE]
No! The AC's off, too!

31
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:49,750
[MATSUO]
Don't change the subject, Zolbe.

32
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,708
You're the only one here
who hasn't said who he likes!

33
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,291
[ZOLBE] Hairo never
answered you, either!

34
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,250
[MATSUO] We couldn't ask him,
'cause he went to bed at eight!

35
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,458
You can say any girl you
want, except Teruhashi.

36
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,833
I mean, she's the obvious
choice, so that's dumb.

37
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,291
Has to be from school.

38
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:04,291
Aren't you guys hot in here?
I'm gonna open the window.

39
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:07,750
Um, what's with the water?

40
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,500
What? Earlier you
were complaining

41
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,708
we couldn't see any of
the ocean from our hotel!

42
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,041
But now it's like,
there's water everywhere.

43
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,166
[MATSUO]
What're you saying,

44
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,500
there's been a
tsunami or something?

45
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:19,708
No, it's like our room moved.

46
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:20,708
[MATSUO]
What water?

47
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:22,250
[ZOLBE]
We were just in the ocean!

48
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,791
[MATSUO]
You really do need a nightlight.

49
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:25,833
Hey! Right on cue!

50
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,583
[SAIKI]
What a pain. That was close.

51
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,541
Holy crap! It came
back instantaneously!

52
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:31,875
So everything's
fixed now, right?

53
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:32,458
[SAIKI]
Not yet.

54
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:33,791
Huh?

55
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,083
[SAIKI] Give me back
the antenna you pulled out.

56
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,958
What? Oh, your little
barrette thingy's gone?

57
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,000
I didn't notice.

58
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,458
[SAIKI]
Give it.

59
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:40,375
Hey! Don't hurt me. I didn't
take your pink head ball,

60
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:41,041
I swear!

61
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:41,916
[SAIKI]
Eh? What?

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,125
With ghosts-as-my-witness,

63
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:44,458
I don't know anything
about your antenna!

64
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm telling the truth!

65
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,791
[SAIKI] I actually do believe
him now. So who did take it?

66
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,250
[YUMEHARA] Kokomi still
isn't back, and it's already

67
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:50,916
lights out! She's broken
curfew and then some!

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,083
I hate to tattle, but
it's time to tell a teacher.

69
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,666
I agree.

70
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,625
Plus, Kokomi isn't the type to
just disappear without telling.

71
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:57,875
I'll go find someone!

72
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,375
[SAIKI]
So it was Teruhashi!

73
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,291
She's the one who
took my control device,

74
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,833
and now she's vanished!

75
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:05,291
Well, more like, my powers
made her disappear.

76
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:06,625
Just like the hotel
and the ship,

77
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,083
she must've switched
with something.

78
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:11,833
But what? Nothing
suddenly appeared over here.

79
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:15,333
Okay, calm down. I can use
clairvoyance to find her.

80
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:17,875
[gasps]

81
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,125
[SAIKI]
Good! She's okay!

82
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,625
Oh, what kind of face
is that supposed to be?

83
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:21,500
[TERUHASHI whimpers]

84
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:22,833
[SAIKI]
She's not okay!

85
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:25,291
It'll get stuck that way.
Hey, where did you go?!

86
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,125
Saiki?

87
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,416
[SAIKI] Uh-oh. I don't have
any cover story this time.

88
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,958
I guess I'll have to tell
Teruhashi about my powers.

89
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,666
Is this a dream?

90
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,833
[TORITSUKA] Hey, Saiki!
What is wrong with you, man?

91
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,875
You disappear more
than the ghosts I see.

92
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,333
[YUMEHARA]
There you are!

93
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,125
Where on Earth have you been?

94
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,750
You had us so worried,
we broke curfew

95
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,333
and snuck outta
the room to find you!

96
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:50,500
[TORITSUKA]
You're worried about me?

97
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:51,666
I'm so glad!

98
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,791
Me, too!

99
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:53,958
[TORITSUKA]
Whatever's going on here,

100
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,208
it looks like the
chicks finally dig me!

101
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:58,000
But... never scare us
like that again, Kokomi.

102
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,125
[MERA] And you know, you still
haven't told us where you went.

103
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,166
You think I'm
Teruhashi? Serious?

104
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,250
[YUMEHARA]
Did you lose your memory?

105
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,791
[MERA]
I bet she's sleepwalking.

106
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,958
[TORITSUKA] No. Saiki
must've done something!

107
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,791
[SAIKI]
Indeed, mass hypnosis.

108
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,333
To the girls, you appear
and sound like Teruhashi.

109
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,458
I would've used it
for myself, but I can't.

110
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:14,666
Trust me, this was the best way

111
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,250
to keep things from
getting out of hand.

112
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,041
[TORITSUKA] Now all the guys
are gonna be drooling after me,

113
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:21,000
and I want the girls! Why do I
get stuck being your guinea pig?

114
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:21,750
[YUMEHARA]
Well, let's go.

115
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:22,958
What? Go, where?

116
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,708
Where else, Kokomi?
Back to our hotel room!

117
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,750
We gotta be back in
time for bed checks!

118
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,375
[TORITSUKA]
Saiki. Thank you so much!

119
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,208
[MERA] Teruhashi,
your nose is bleeding!

120
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,541
[SAIKI]
So long as he doesn't ruin this

121
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:33,875
by doing anything stupid,

122
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,041
I've got things back
there cleaned up.

123
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,416
Now, I just need to swap him
with the real Teruhashi.

124
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,791
[TERUHASHI]
Oh, Saiki.

125
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:42,166
[SAIKI]
Provided I can get her off me.

126
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,291
[SAIKI] What a pain. How'm
I gonna get outta this one?

127
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:52,708
Oh, wow, I've never had
a lucid dream before,

128
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,166
it feels so realistic!

129
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,708
[SAIKI] In a lucid dream,
you're asleep,

130
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,333
but you're still aware
that you're dreaming.

131
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:59,333
This means that you
can do anything you want.

132
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,500
Teruhashi has mistakenly
convinced herself

133
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:02,541
she's in the middle of one.

134
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:03,958
Saiki.

135
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,916
[SAIKI] Normally, I could
turn this to my advantage.

136
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,333
What do you think of
our dream date so far, Saiki?

137
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:09,708
[SAIKI]
But there's one problem.

138
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,875
Wow, everything feels
like it's really happening!

139
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:14,250
I'm playing with
your face because I can!

140
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,500
[SAIKI] I still don't have
my control device back.

141
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,833
And that means I can't use
any of my psychic powers

142
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:21,000
without hurting her.

143
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,250
For example, normally
I'd just chop her on the neck

144
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,666
to knock her out and then
take her back to the hotel.

145
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,791
That sounds creepier
than I meant it to.

146
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:28,916
Anyway, without that device,

147
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,625
it doesn't matter
which power, I use.

148
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,250
Anything I touch
could be destroyed,

149
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,666
so knocking her out
is a definite no-no.

150
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,666
Even the slightest tap
could pop her head clean off!

151
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,541
And as for the arm
I mentioned earlier,

152
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,250
the tiniest muscle
spasm could rocket her

153

00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,791
Oh, he said he was
goin' up ahead to do stuff.

305
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,875
[YUMEHARA]
He didn't even check me out!

306
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,291
[YUMEHARA]
Well, it's all over now.

307
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,708
All that sacrifice for nothing.
Trip's a total waste.

308
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,750
Hey. Aren't you
gonna go swimming?

309
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,833
No. Go away, I don't feel good.

310
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,416
Um, are you saying
that you can't swim?

311
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,041
Because I know someone
with the same problem.

312
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,833
I can swim,
I just wanna be alone.

313
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:38,708
Go without me.

314
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:39,833
I would, if I hadn't been cursed

315
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,583
by mighty Poseidon,
God of the Ocean!

316
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,291
Whenever seawater
touches my chaste body,

317
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:44,958
it burns like a thousand suns!

318
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,750
Curse those petty
tyrants of Olympus!

319
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,416
That sounds like a stupid way
of saying you can't swim.

320
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,750
[KAIDOU]  Huh...? That's
not true, I can swim!

321
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,125
[YUMEHARA] Wait. Did he just
blush when he saw my body?

322
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,666
He did, didn't he?!

323
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,333
And now he's looking away in
shame at how I made him feel!

324
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,166
[TERUHASHI]
Kaidou!

325
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,500
Hey. Did a ball roll over here?

326
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,875
[KAIDOU] No! No, I didn't
see anything! I'm innocent!

327
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,125
[YUMEHARA]
He rolled backwards three times?

328
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,583
I can't believe how
much bigger his reaction is

329
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,208
to her than to me!

330
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,291
Life is so unfair! Someone!
Please say I'm cute!

331
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,166
[MAN A] Dude.
That girl over there's cute!

332
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,125
What's that?

333
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,000
[MAN A]
Hey! You in the blue!

334
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:19,791
Huh?

335
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,041
Whoa, you look pretty hot.

336
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:22,833
Come with us, and we'll
buy you a shaved ice.

337
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,375
[TERUHASHI]
What?

338
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,000
These beach bros really think
they have a chance with me?

339
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,083
[MAN A] What are you waiting
for? We'll cool you off, hottie.

340
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,375
[TERUHASHI]
Got more muscles than sense

341
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,041
if they think
I'm in their league.

342
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,458
I know I'm every
guy's dream girl,

343
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,416
but going after a
perfect ten-plus like me

344
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,791
makes them seem like idiots.
Then again,

345
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,000
just 'cause they look dumb
doesn't mean they're poor.

346
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:41,500
If one of them has a net worth
of at least 40 million yen,

347
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,166
I'll look the other way
on this pick-up.

348
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,541
[SAIKI]
Who are these two idiots?

349
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:47,000
[TERUHASHI] Yeah, what
if their families are rich?

350
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,458
[SAIKI] Fine. I'll help
before she gets hurt.

351
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,416
[KAIDOU]
Let her go!

352
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,333
She's doesn't want it,
now get lost!

353
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,416
[BOTH]
Huh?

354
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,666
[SAIKI]
Huh?

355
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:03,875
[SAIKI]
We're halfway through day two

356
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,916
of our big school
trip to Okinawa,

357
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,666
and there's a situation
with Teruhashi

358
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,958
and some "guys"
on Emerald Beach.

359
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,083
She's doesn't wanna!
Now get lost!

360
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:12,791
Huh?

361
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,666
Who the hell are you?

362
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,291
Uh, I'm just saying
she doesn't wanna go,

363
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:17,666
so leave her alone.

364
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,000
[MAN A] No, you leave,
this ain't your scene, bro!

365
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,875
No, she's my classmate, and
if you don't leave her alone,

366
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,708
I'll be forced to get
physical with you and stuff.

367
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,083
[MAN B]
Huh?! "Physical" with us?

368
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,750
Yeah. You guys'll
really regret it.

369
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:30,791
[YUMEHARA]
Cut it out, jerks!

370
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,041
[MEN]
Huh?

371
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,458
We're a group of students
on a school trip,

372
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,166
and if you don't stop putting
the moves on my friend,

373
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,875
I'll have no choice
but to tell a teacher!

374
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,083
Wow. I'm shakin'
in my boat shoes.

375
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,625
No one was talking to you, girl.

376
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,041
[MAN A] Yeah, we're
not interested in talking

377
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,083
to an ugly chick like you.

378
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,666
Bet you don't even
care about her.

379
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,208
You're just jealous
she gets hit on.

380
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,458
[MAN A laughs]

381
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:52,041
Take that back!
Apologize to Chiyo!

382
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,333
[MAN A]
The hell was that for?!

383
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:54,791
[KAIDOU] Say you're sorry,
or I keep punching!

384
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,625
Oh, you are really
asking for it now.

385
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,166
That hurt-- Huh?

386
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,708
Actually it doesn't hurt at all.
Did you even make contact?

387
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:03,166
From this angle, it looks
more like a tiny mosquito bite.

388
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,625
First I was mad you punched me,

389
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,791
but now I'm madder at
what a weakling you are!

390
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:07,833
[KAIDOU squeaks]

391
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,458
[SAIKI]
No, it wasn't a weak punch.

392
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,666
Owwww!

393
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,416
What's wrong?

394
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,666
[SAIKI]
Delayed pain.

395
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,333
Courtesy of the
"Jet Black Wings Fist of Rage."

396
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,458
[KAIDOU]
Uh... Is this my fault?

397
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:22,875
Ha-ha! Those guys really
weren't so tough, after all.

398
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:24,083
Are you okay?

399
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,708
I can't believe some
people are that rude.

400
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:26,750
[NARRATOR A]
What Yumehara sees.

401
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:29,250
Yumehara, don't
let them bother you.

402
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,500
[NARRATOR A]
What Yumehara hears.

403
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:33,583
[KAIDOU] You're lookin'
kinda cute today, Chiyo.

404
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:38,166
[YUMEHARA]
Kaidou. You're amazing!

405
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,208
[SAIKI]
Good job, Kaidou.

406
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,916
[NARRATOR A] And with that, the
second day of their trip ended.

407
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,541
And their final day
on Okinawa began.

408
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,750
Hard to believe this
trip's almost over, buddy.

409
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,750
It felt like we were
here just a few days.

410
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:54,250
That's 'cause we were
here just a few days.

411
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,375
[SAIKI] It's felt like
a few weeks to me.

412
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,208
[KAIDOU yawns]

413
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,708
Hey! You need more sleep, man,
that's why you're so short.

414
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:03,041
It's your fault I didn't
sleep on this trip!

415
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,708
[SAIKI] This is how Kaidou
remembers last night.

416
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,708
You snore as loud
as a lawn mower!

417
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,291
You sounded so bad I got worried

418
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,041
and went to check on you,
but that's when...

419
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,666
...you scared the hell outta me!

420
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,541
Why do you sleep with
your eyes rolled back?

421
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:16,166
Hey, look who's talkin', pal,
you were pretty noisy yourself!

422
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,541
[KAIDOU]
No way!

423
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,291
You've been muttering in
your sleep every night here!

424
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:21,208
[SAIKI] Great.
Now you're doing a flashback?

425
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,541
[KAIDOU]
What's this power?

426
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,125
It's out of control!

427
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:27,083
[NENDOU] I wanted to shut you
up, but then I saw your face!

428
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:28,416
I can't breathe.

429
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,833
[NENDOU]
Creepy!

430
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:31,333
[KAIDOU] I can't sleep
without a blanket on my head!

431
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,791
At least my sleep talking
is better than your snoring!

432
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,250
Yeah, but it's even
louder than my snoring!

433
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,625
[SAIKI] I had to
sleep through both of you.

434
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,291
I'm the real victim.

435
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:39,208
Well, that's in the past.

436
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,583
Let's enjoy our last day here.

437
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,625
Yeah! It's time to
buy some souvenirs!

438
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:43,958
[SAIKI]
You buy your knickknacks.

439
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,666
I've still got something
far more important to do.

440
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,083
On the way here, I read--

441
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,291
Oops, I guess I'm doing
a flashback now, too.

442
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,958
Anyway, I read a magazine
and I discovered this!

443
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,125
That's right. The best and
rarest dessert available

444
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,166
on Okinawa's
International Avenue:

445
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,916
Coffee Red Bean <i>Anmitsu</i> .

446
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,125
They only make five
of them a day,

447
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:01,500
at one hole-in-the-wall joint.

448
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:02,750
Although, after
it's been featured

449
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,250
in a major airline's magazine,

450
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,791
it can't really be called a
"hole-in-the-wall." Anyway!

451
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,083
I vowed right then and there

452
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,291
I wouldn't go home
until I try this dessert.

453
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,833
But in order to do so,
I need to split from the group.

454
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,500
I mean, you've seen
what those two are like.

455
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:15,458
They'll ruin the
whole experience.

456
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:16,666
Hey. Where'd the ladies go?

457
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,083
Yeah, I haven't seen 'em today.

[SAIKI]
Thanks to a certain stomach,

459
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,458
the girls never get
anywhere on time,

460
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,916
which is good for me.

461
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,458
[YUMEHARA] Mera! We're late
meeting up with the guys!

C'mon, it's our
last day, let's go!

464
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,458
You really have to
learn some self-control

465
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,458
when you see a
"free sample" sign, Mera!

466
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,125
Y'know, I can't think
of a moment this trip

467
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,875
when she hasn't had
food in her mouth.

468
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:37,125
Uh! We'll never catch up
with the guys now!

469
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:38,541
Yumehara, if you're that bored,

470
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,333
why don't you go ahead,
and I'll stay with Mera?

471
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:41,583
What?

472
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:42,291
[TERUHASHI] I want you
to have fun with them.

473
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,166
Especially Kaidou.

00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,666
[YUMEHARA]
What?! Uh... No!

475
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,583
I don't have a crush on
Kaidou, don't be silly...

476
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,125
Oops! I'm sorry.

477
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:51,916
I've been under the impression
you had feelings for Kaidou.

478
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,291
[SAIKI]
All right, so I'm not gonna have

479
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,125
to worry about the girls,
but as for them...

480
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,041
[NENDOU] Do I like bitter
melon? Or do I hate it?

481
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,583
[KAIDOU] You ate
a whole plate at the hotel!

482
00:17:58,666 --> 00:17:59,916
[SAIKI] I gotta ditch
them no matter what

483
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,083
if I wanna get one
of those <i>Anmitsu</i> .

484
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,791
[KAIDOU] I take it you sensed
my powerful wave energy?

485
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,041
[SAIKI]
Oh, shut up!

486
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,291
[SAIKI] We're right
back where we left off:

487
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,958
The last day of the
school trip to Okinawa.

488
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,666
And there is only one thing
I want to do, or rather eat,

489
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,958
before I go home:
Coffee Red Bean <i>Anmitsu</i> .

490
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,750
But to eat that,
I need to lose them...

491
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:28,000
...because they
are complete idiots.

492
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,416
[YUMEHARA] Ah! I can't
believe Teruhashi figured out

493
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,125
I like Kaidou so easily!

494
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,166
I didn't know I was
so obvious about it.

495
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,416
Sort of, yeah.

496
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,708
But don't worry,
I won't tell anyone!

497
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,041
No, you certainly will not,

498
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,666
because I know
who you like, Kokomi.

499
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,333
What?

500
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:41,125
You like Nend--

501
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,166
No, stop! Don't say it!

502
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,333
I won't tell who you like,

503
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,208
so long as you
never tell who I like!

504

[TERUHASHI]
If she says his name out loud,

505

I think I'll have
a total meltdown!

'Kay, deal.

Then whaddaya say we catch up
with the boys, together?

508
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:55,041
Yeah, and let's grab Mera
before she ends up hurt.

509
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,875
[YUMEHARA] She really
abused the free sample policy.

510
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:00,791
Hey, um, shouldn't you call
me by my first name now?

511
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:01,833
Huh?

512
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,375
Yumehara, sounds
kinda formal, right?

513
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,916
You know who my crush is,
for crying out loud.

514
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,208
Call me Chiyo!

515
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,708
We've totally bonded this trip.

Um, sure... Chiyo.

517
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,166
[YUMEHARA]
Doesn't that feel right, Kokomi?

518
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,708
That's so sweet.

519
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,541
I said stop eating!

520
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:19,333
[SAIKI] So, the girls are still
fine, but as for these two...

you were givin' it to me!

I already bought snake powder
with my souvenir money.

it down to three grand.

Well, I'll take it!

it, "buy one, get one free."

00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:52,166
[TERUHASHI]
Here. Have some of mine, too.

610
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,333
[MERA]
And mine!

611
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:54,416
[KAIDOU]
Mera's giving up food?

612
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,791
[MERA]
I ate too many samples earlier.

613
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:57,916
[NENDOU]
There! Your very own bowl!

614
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,125
[TERUHASHI, YUMEHARA]
It's huge!

615
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:00,500
[KAIDOU] Now Saiki has
the biggest serving!

616
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:01,541
Wait. Give some back.

617
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:02,750
Chow down, folks!

618
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:05,250
It's the last memory
we'll make on Okinawa!

619
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:08,041
[GROUP]
Cheers!

620
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,416
[SAIKI]
This isn't bad at all.

621
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:44,125
[SAIKI]
After three days of drama,

622
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:46,208
the Okinawa trip
ended without incident,

623
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:49,333
and we're settling back
into our old routines.

624
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:52,291
Next time, on <i>The Disastrous</i>
<i>Life of Saiki K.</i> !

625
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:54,916
Seriously?
Another transfer student?

626
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,625
Just what we didn't need.
