1
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,583
[SAIKI] When you have
supernatural powers,

2
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:46,958
the impossible becomes possible.

3
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:48,333
[GOOD-LOOKING MAN A]
Whoa! Look at this little guy!

4
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:50,708
So cute. I'm a huge dog lover.

5
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,750
[GOOD-LOOKING MAN A] But I'm
way more into girls, heh.

6
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:54,708
[GIRL A]
No! Pochimi, come back!

7
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,791
--[GIRL A] Pochimi!
--[GOOD-LOOKING MAN A screams]

8
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:04,708
That was weird.
So, you wanna go out sometime?

9
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,250
[GIRL A] Ew, are you
trying to pick me up?

10
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:08,083
[SAIKI]
My name is Kusuo Saiki.

11
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:10,833
And I have psychic super-powers.

12
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:13,416
Sixteen years ago,
an ordinary couple gave birth

13
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,250
to a not-so-ordinary baby boy.

14
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:19,875
[KUNIHARU] So cute.
Almost as cute as Mommy!

15
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,958
[KURUMI] So cute.
Almost as cute as Daddy!

16
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,333
[KUNIHARU]
Oh, you.

17
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:26,083
[SAIKI] Wow. So I guess
I'm still only second place.

18
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:28,500
[SAIKI] I started talking
when I was 14 days old.

19
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:31,583
Without using my voice.

20
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,958
Soon afterward...

21
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:39,166
I started walking when I was
one month old... in the air.

22
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,791
And at one year old...

23
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:43,291
[KURUMI] We're out?
I can't cook without rice wine!

24
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:44,333
[gasps]

25
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:46,000
Kusuo?

26
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,208
[SAIKI]
...I ran my first errands.

27
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:49,791
[KURUMI]
Oh, Kuu.

28
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:52,916
[SAIKI] And my mom finally
started to worry about me.

29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,916
Now, you'd think after
a year of this weirdness,

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,500
they'd take me to get tested.

31
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,666
But my folks are
kinda weird themselves.

32
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,291
I'm pretty sure he
stole the rice wine.

33
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:03,125
Well, I'll go pay 'em back
tomorrow, if there's time.

34
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:04,416
[SAIKI]
Not to mention lazy.

35
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,791
Our little psychic
boy did pay, after all!

36
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:08,000
I don't know how he paid...

37
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,333
[SAIKI] They can still
act like lovebirds.

38
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:11,041
And they take
everything in stride.

39
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,250
Including me,
and all my weird powers.

40
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,250
[KURUMI]
Such a talented artist!

41
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:16,958
[SAIKI]
So time rolled on.

42
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,458
[SAIKI] I became
the person you see now,

43
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,833
a high school student.

44
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,166
As you saw with
the floating car,

45
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,083
I still have my super powers.

46
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,666
I can bend spoons,
like any good psychic.

47
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,250
And I can win any
corporate give-away I want.

48
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,958
My life is a dream come true.

49
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,666
[SAIKI] That is what
you're thinking, right?

50
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,208
Well, let me drop
some truth bombs.

51
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:41,416
Bending spoons
makes it harder to eat,

52
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,750
and winning free popsicles
just leads to stomach aches.

53
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,291
"He's the happiest boy alive!

54
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,041
That boy can have anything
and do anything."

55
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,500
Well, that's dead wrong.

56
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:52,916
I'm the unhappiest boy alive,
a boy who has nothing.

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,208
Telepathy, Psychokinesis,
X-Ray Vision,

58
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:58,208
Precognition, Teleportation,
Clairvoyance, etc. etc.

59
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:00,166
Sure, I can do all those things.

60
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,958
But having powers
like that also means

61
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,041
having something taken away.

62
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,916
Sort of like how
because we feed our pets,

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,250
they've lost
the ability to hunt.

64
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,000
Or when a mother
spoils her child,

65
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,916
he loses the ability to
become a functional adult.

66
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,041
In this way, there are some

67
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,125
key experiences
I've missed out on.

68
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,291
Hard work culminating
in a sense of achievement.

69
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,291
The thrill of being
thrown a surprise party.

70
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,000
They're both totally
foreign to me.

71
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,291
Sure, I never get angry
or sad about anything,

72
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,500
but that just means

73
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,791
there's no joy or thrill
in my life, either.

74
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:31,083
[SAIKI] Maybe I should focus
on the bright side, though.

75
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,708
No drama means things
are always peaceful for me.

76
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,333
--And that's not so bad.
--[KUNIHARU] Where is he?

77
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:36,708
[SAIKI]
Hmm?

78
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:39,291
Huh? Kusuo!
Welcome home, my son!

79
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,916
You're running
kinda late today, huh?

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,041
[SAIKI] Why's Dad sitting
in front of the house?

81
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,750
I'll get right to
the point, Kusuo.

82
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:45,958
I'm locked outta the house.

83
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,416
Can you open it up
for your ol' pop?

84
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,708
[SAIKI]
Are you kidding? Again?

85
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,291
[KUNIHARU] Whoa! I love
those psychic powers of yours!

86
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:57,625
They're just so sneaky! Yeah.

87
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:58,875
[SAIKI]
Don't call them sneaky.

88
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:00,208
[KUNIHARU] Kusuo.
With those kind of powers,

89
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:01,625
think of all the
things you could do.

90
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,708
[SAIKI] Keep your dark
thoughts to yourself, Dad.

91
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,541
[KURUMI] Kuu, is that you?!
You're back?

92
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:08,125
Ah! We'll talk more later!

93
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,750
[SAIKI] I guess there
is one thing in my life

94
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,375
that's decidedly un-peaceful.

95
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,375
I can't believe you changed
the locks on me again!

96
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,125
[SAIKI] That would be my
parents' current relationship.

97
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:16,416
I hope you're hungry, Kuu-Kuu.

98
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,125
I'm making you breaded
pork chops for din-din!

99
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:19,833
Hang on, and now you're
choosing to ignore me?

100
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:22,125
Besides I told you I wanted
to have steak tonight!

101
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,125
I'm sorry, I forgot.

102
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:24,416
But I can boil you
a leather shoe.

103
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,958
[KUNIHARU] I don't want
a shoe, leather or not!

104
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,625
[SAIKI] I wonder when
it went wrong for them?

105
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,125
They used to be so passionate.

106
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,000
I love you like
a fish loves water.

107
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,208
Oh, you.

108
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,291
My hate for you's become

109
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,083
as wide and deep
as the Pacific Ocean!

110
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,750
I hate you like
a fish hates air!

111
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,375
You suck.

112
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:40,125
[SAIKI] Well they're
still passionate now,

113
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,750
but it's a little different.

114
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:48,541
[KURUMI]
Gorge yourselves, guys!

115
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:49,666
I made a ton!

116
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,833
[KUNIHARU]
Hey! Hey! Hey!

117
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,208
[KURUMI]
Is it good, Kuu?

118
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:54,833
Oh, honey, would you
like something else?

119
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,000
No, because I bet
it's just the other shoe!

120
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,250
[KURUMI]
Bon appetit!

121
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,666
[KUNIHARU] That's not
even from the same pair!

122
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,541
[SAIKI] They've been going
at each other for a year.

123
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,291
Hey. Kusuo.

124
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:06,083
Use your powers to turn this
old shoe into a steak for Daddy.

125
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,291
[SAIKI]
So in case you forgot,

126
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,583
this pathetic dude's
my dad, Kuniharu Saiki.

127
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:10,833
He's lazy and irresponsible

128
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,708
and asks for help with
everything in his life.

129
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:13,875
But, surprise-surprise,

130
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,458
the more I help,
the more useless he gets.

131
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,416
So, lately, I've stopped
doing him any favors.

132
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,291
What? How dare you take
your mother's side in this!

133
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,833
Do you have any
idea how many shoes

134
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:23,416
I have to lick each day to buy
that food you're eating now?

135
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,708
[KUNIHARU] Nothing better
than Italian. Loafers that is!

136
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,500
[SAIKI]
So, you do like to eat shoes?

137
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:29,791
All right! I'll eat it!

138
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,625
It stinks! What did you
do to this shoe?

139
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,208
Are you trying to
poison your father?

140
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:34,666
[SAIKI] I'm pretty sure that's
how they always smell, dummy.

141
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,833
[KURUMI]
Hey, Kuu.

142
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,208
Now, just remember
what I've always said.

143
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:38,875
Please don't use
your powers for evil.

144
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:40,666
[SAIKI]
This is my mom, Kurumi Saiki.

145
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,083
[KURUMI] You must only use your
powers to help those in need.

146
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,916
Or those people who you are
certain are genuinely nice.

147
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,250
[SAIKI]
She's a big reason why

148
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,083
I haven't let my gifts
turn me to the dark side.

149
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,250
She's a caring soul,
well, to me.

150
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:55,291
But feel free to use your
powers to hurt your daddy.

151
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,750
[SAIKI] She kinda has
a dark side herself.

152
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,583
Stop eating Kusuo's dinner,
you thieving son-of-a-bitch!

153
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:03,916
That's it.

154
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,416
--We're taking this outside!
--[KUNIHARU] No way.

155
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,791
[SAIKI] In truth,
I could break up this fight

156
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,583
whenever I feel like it,
ut this is something

157
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,375
they're going to have to
work out themselves.

158
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:14,833
Hmm? Coffee-flavored jelly?
Hm. Doesn't taste bad.

159
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:17,125
Earthy, with a slightly
citrus-note finish.

160
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:18,333
Don't let the name
fool you, folks.

161
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,750
This jelly is a mature,
dignified treat.

162
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,958
Better still, when you add
just a splash of whole milk,

163
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,416
it becomes an entirely
new flavor sensation.

164
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,541
And that hint of
decadence

165
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,666
is everything I ask
for in my dessert.

166
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,375
You wanted to
eat jelly that bad?

167
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,333
Forget the jelly,
we got bigger problems!

168
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,333
Your mother's turned
into a monster!

169
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,666
[KURUMI] Stop running
from me, you coward!

170
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,000
You gotta help me, son!

171
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,416
You're my only hope
to stop her reign of terror!

172
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,625
Do it! Slay the demon!

173
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:48,458
[KURUMI] You're not
leaving till I say so!

174
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:51,000
[KUNIHARU screaming]

175
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,541
[KUNIHARU]
Oh God! Ah!

176
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,166
Huh? What?

177
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,708
Hey! Kusuo?

178
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,791
[SAIKI] I've got the weirdest
parents. I really don't care

179
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,625
about stopping another pointless
fight, but I can't help myself.

180
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,625
[KURUMI] So now you're
on your dad's side?

181
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,083
But I even made you pork chops!

182
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,375
[SAIKI] Why do I say
it's pointless? Just wait.

183
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,458
I want nothing to do
with either of you again!

184
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,625
[KURUMI] That's a lie.
Truth is: I love them.

185
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,083
[SAIKI]
No matter how hard they try,

186
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,166
the voices in their
hearts always bubble up.

187
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,250
In other words, all these
fights they have are a sham.

188
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,708
[KUNIHARU] All right, well,
I hate you both, too.

189
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,166
So there! Yeah! I said it!

190
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,333
[KUNIHARU]
Just kidding!

191
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:23,083
You know, I love you guys!
I wanna snuggle!

192
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,291
Oh, honey...

193
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,958
[SAIKI] Like I said:
Another pointless fight.

194
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,916
There is one person here who
has real reason to be upset: Me!

195
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,583
Those weirdos
interrupted my dessert!

196
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:34,125
I guess only a
psychic can fix this.

197
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,125
--[KUNIHARU] Love you!
--[KURUMI] Love you!

198
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,208
Wait. Did you just
say you love me?

199
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,125
[KUNIHARU] Is it really
possible she loves me back?

200
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,583
What? No, it's you who said it.

201
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:41,833
[KURUMI]
Oh, no.

202
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,041
I thought I just thought
that, but did I say it?

203
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,541
And what does
"she loves me back?" mean?

204
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:45,291
He loves me?

205
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:46,458
So you did say it!

206
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,500
You just admitted
to thinking it out loud!

207
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,041
[KUNIHARU] Is it possible
that I love her so much

208
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,625
I've started hearing things?

209
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,291
[KURUMI]
He loves me "so much"?

210
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,083
[KUNIHARU]
Huh? She can hear me, too?

211
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,125
What? Yeah.

212
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:56,958
[KURUMI]
He did say it!

213
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,125
Not out loud.

214
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:58,833
[BOTH]
What?

215
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,291
Kusuo!

216
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,041
[SAIKI]
Forced shared telepathy.

217
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:05,291
I used my psychic powers to link
their minds at the neural level.

218
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,458
In other words, thanks to me,

219
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,250
they can now hear
each other's thoughts.

220
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,750
Turn it off right now!

221
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,291
I don't want your dad finding
out that I still love him!

222
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:14,416
Her finding out that I still
love her is my worst nightmare!

223
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,666
I love you, dear.

224
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,083
I love you, too.

225
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,083
[SAIKI]
Cool. The end.

226
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,541
[KUNIHARU]
I'm sorry, honey.

227
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,541
[KURUMI] No, I'm sorry.
It was all my fault!

228
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,416
[SAIKI] What a pain,
normal people are complicated.

229
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,166
At least now I can finish
my dessert in peace.

230
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,500
...eating your coffee jelly
would have trapped us

231
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,333
in this cycle of violence,
I wouldn't have done it!

232
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:30,708
You did nothing wrong, honey.

233
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,541
It was all my fault for
getting so angry with you

234
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,708
and breaking all the doors
and windows in the house.

235
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,708
Let's set things right!

Is it good?

[KUNIHARU] Mm-hm! It's a mature,
dignified treat. Delicious!

high school, PK Academy.

The Principal will not shut up. 

243
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,583
[SAIKI] Despite the school's
relatively small size,

244
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,708
no one knows about my powers.

245
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:10,125
If they did know,
all hell would break loose.

246
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,583
Back when I was
in kindergarten.

247
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,666
I was undefeated in
rock-paper-scissors.

248
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,000
Which shouldn't surprise you,

249
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:18,041
since you know that I can
hear people's thoughts.

253
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,083
In lawless kindergarten,

254
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,541
all battles are fought with
rock-paper-scissors.

255
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,041
Okay, Kusuo, let's
play rock-paper-scissors.

256
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,250
If I win, you have to share

257
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,791
your treat with the
other students.

258

--I always won.
--How 'bout best of three?

260
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:34,833
--And won.
--Uh, best of nine?

261
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,625

need to win once, right?

00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:37,291

And won.

263

After that,

266
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,208
she disappeared from
the school, entirely.

267
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,916
I followed up that incident
with even more success.

268
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,458
And it took a while for
things to finally die down.

269
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:51,333
So, I learned it's best to stop
using my powers in public.

270
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,916
Now I only do it when
it's absolutely necessary

271
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,166
and when I'm sure
no one else is looking.

272
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,583
And the way I do that,
is to use my telepathy.

What does bother me is the fact
that no matter how hard I try,

I can't read this

I don't trust Nendou to find it.

308
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:57,958
[SAIKI]
Dammit.

309
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,291
Huh? Is the nurse
dead, too? That's weird.

310
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,208
Guess I'll have to do
mouth-to-mouth on you myself.

311
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:03,708
[SAIKI]
Please don't.

312
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,000
[grunts]

313
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,916
I don't need mouth-to-mouth,
you stupid idiot!

314
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,666
You're better.
Well that's nice to see.

315
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,125
[TAKAHASHI] 'Course
I'm better! I was faking!

316
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,458
[TAKAHASHI retches]

317
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,333
Wasn't worth it though,
since I got kissed by you!

318
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,500
Well, if it makes you
feel better, I'm sad, too.

319
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:18,250
You were my first kiss.

320
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,750
[SAIKI] You're only
making it worse, Nendou.

321
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:23,125
Now everyone's gonna
think Nendou and I are in love!

322
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,541
[SAIKI] I absolutely guarantee
no one is thinking that.

323
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:28,500
Hey! You better not tell anyone
my fainting spell was a fake.

324
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,458
[TAKAHASHI] I can't count
that as my first kiss, right?

325
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,416
That was terrible!

326
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,750
[TAKAHASHI]
Don't tell anyone!

327
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,916
[SAIKI] Don't tell what?
That you faked being sick?

328
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,666
Or that now I know you shared
your first kiss with Nendou?

329
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,375
If it's the sick thing,
you're too late.

330
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:41,250
I heard it all!

331
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,291
[TAKAHASHI]
Matsuzaki!

332
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,583
So your fainting
was a con job, huh?

333
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,958
[TAKAHASHI] Crap!
It's Gym Teacher Matsuzaki!

334
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,166
That's not what
happened, sir!

335
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,166
It's his fault!

336
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,458
He forced me to collapse,

337
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,125
so we could skip out
on the principal's speech

338
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:52,958
and my sickness
is actually a ruse.

339
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:54,125
Nendou, is that all true?

340
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,541
[NENDOU]
Wha--?

341
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,458
[SAIKI] Pinning this on
Nendou isn't a half-bad idea.

342
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,750
Huh? Saiki?
What're you doin' here?

343
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:00,791
[SAIKI]
What?

344
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,166
Takahashi, is he
also a part of this?

345
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,333
Who? Uh, yeah, sure.

346
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,375
That's it! I want
you both, in my office!

347
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,791
[SAIKI] Dragging me
into this is a bad idea, pal.

348
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,500
[NENDOU]
Hold on a sec, teach.

349
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:11,375
His fainting was real.

350
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:14,833
Didn't you hear him say it?
Root sickness.

351
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,250
[SAIKI]
Holy crap he's dumb.

352
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,333
How could anyone
mistake "ruse" for "roots"?

353
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:19,583
What? Isn't that right?

354
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,750
What in the holy heck?
What's "root sickness"?

355
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,500
[NARRATOR A]
Root sickness is a deadly virus

356
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,083
that infects the victim
through his follicles.

357
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,083
Oh, that one.

358
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:26,916
[TAKAHASHI] 
Huh?!

359
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,416
[SAIKI]
He's dumb, too.

360
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,041
Let's take your temperature
to see if you have a fever.

361
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,458
'S what my mom
always does for me.

362
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,208
[TAKAHASHI] C'mon, dude,
I don't have a fever.

363
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm not even sick!

364
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,291
[MATSUZAKI]
Ninety-two point-eight Celsius.

365
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,125
Huh?

366
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,125
Go call an ambulance now!

367
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,500
[NENDOU]
You can beat this thing, man.

368
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,000

We'll save what hair we can!

Oops, I melted the tip.

371
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,750
Better hide the evidence.

372
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:49,541
Whoa.

373
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:50,583
[SAIKI]
He saw!

374
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:53,208
You... have the fever too?

375
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,500
You can beat this thing, man!

376
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,875
[SAIKI]
Like I said, Nendou's a moron.

377
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:06,250
[KAIDOU] I'm Shun Kaidou,
an 11th grader at PK Academy.

378
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,250
At least, that's my cover story.

379
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,541
In reality, a force
called "Black Beat"

380
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:11,875
dwells in my right arm.

381
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:14,000
But they are trying to
steal this power from me

382
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,541
and create a new world order.

383
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm referring to
the Dark Reunion!

384
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,791
But with my power,
I will protect the world.

[BOY STUDENT J]
Did ya hear?

389
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,458
A deadly snake escaped
from the local zoo.

390
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,375
There's a poisonous
snake on the loose?

391
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,291
[KAIDOU]
Are you boys sure it escaped?

392
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,125
An animal attack is
just the kind of plan

393
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,375
they'd come up with.

394
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,208
But fear not, I,
the Jet Black Wings,

395
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,000
am never fooled by
their evil deception!

396
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,250
Someone must've set
that snake free on purpose!

397
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,083
Hang on. You know the
guy who did this, Kaidou?

398
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,291
Some wannabe supervillain
called the Black Wing?

[KAIDOU] No, I'm
Jet Black Wings, the hero!

The villains are a
secret organization

401
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,208
named "Dark Reunion."

402
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,875
And this escaped snake
thing is the first step

403
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,166
in their evil plot
to sort mankind!

404
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,541
[STUDENTS]
Dark Reunion?

405
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:57,125
Who? Jeez. Never heard of them.

406
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,375
Heh! Once again, the fate
of the world has fallen

407
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,541
into our super-powered
laps, eh, Saiki?

408
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:02,958
[SAIKI]
Oh, boy. He doesn't realize

409
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,708
I actually do have superpowers.

410
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,250
This is all just
play-acting for him.

411
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,125
[KAIDOU]
Saiki, what's your read?

412
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,625
I don't like this one bit.

413
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,750
This snake, which I've named,
"Murder-Dragoram-Snake,"

414
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,166
is likely no ordinary snake.

415
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,666
[SAIKI]
That's quite the dramatic name.

416
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,625
[KAIDOU] It's also likely
that Dark Reunion genetically

417
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,458
engineered Murder-Dragoram-Snake
specifically to kill people!

418
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:20,583
[SAIKI]
He's fond of saying "likely."

We're running out
of time here, Saiki.

the world's counting on us
to stop that slithering--

Hey! Good news,
they caught the snake.

422

Well, that's a relief.
Where did they find it?

[BOY STUDENT M]
At the school's front gate!

424

It was just kinda laying
on the ground, half-dead.

Is it possible Saiki and I

That's one weakass murder-snake.

Sounds like we beat
Dark Reunion this time.

00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,208
Be careful what you say!

I saw that snake coming.

456
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,208
Y'know, because I'm psychic.

I could help them,
but I'd have to out myself.

00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:10,916
--acknowledge her, too.
--and girl from school.

617
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,833
[SAIKI] I'll be checkmated
by social convention.

618
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,666
Oh wow! I didn't
know you were there!

619
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,375
[SAIKI]
I simply can't let that happen.

620
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,083
I'll disappear into the crowd.

621
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,041
Huh. He didn't see me.

622
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,500
That was a close--

623
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,666
[NENDOU] Hmm? I could swear
I just saw my best friend.

624
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,500
[TERUHASHI]
Huh?

625
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,208
Oh, no! Where did Saiki go?

626
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:27,458
Huh?! What's going on?

627
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,791
[SAIKI] Whoopsie.
I accidentally teleported.

628
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,416
[TERUHASHI]
Saiki!

629
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,208
[SAIKI] The people around
me didn't seem to notice

630
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,500
my vanishing, but of course

631
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,416
Teruhashi knows
something is off.

632
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,500
Well, maybe it's best if
you think I was the illusion.

633
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:40,875
[TERUHASHI]
Nendou?

634
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,500
Oh, wow! Hey there, Teruhashi!

635
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:45,625
[TERUHASHI]
Do you know where Saiki went?

636
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,375
What? Buddy? Nope.

637
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:48,541
Haven't seen 'im.

638
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:49,875
[TERUHASHI]
It's... like he disappeared?

639
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:53,250
Is it possible he was a
figment of my imagination?

640
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:56,000
You're so much in love with me
that you see illusions of me?

641
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,375
Oh, my gosh. No. It can't be.

642
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,000
Don't tell me that I'm... 

643
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:03,083
Wh-What're these
feelings coming over me?

644
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:07,833
I think I'm falling
in love... with Saiki?

645
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:09,958
[SAIKI]
Oh, wow.

646
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,708
Teruhashi.

647
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:44,250
[SAIKI] Because it's critical
to your enjoying the show,

648
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:46,833
I'll remind you again that
my name is Kusuo Saiki,

649
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:50,500
and I'm a psychic with all
sorts of crazy mental powers.

650
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:52,041
This is annoying.

651
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:54,500
This season, on <i>The Disastrous</i>
<i>Life of Saiki K.</i> :

652
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:56,958
Each chapter of the
manga gets an episode!
