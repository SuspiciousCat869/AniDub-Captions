00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,208
Bring me food, human!
[SAIKI] Who let you in?

307
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,958
Saiki, I need you
after school.

308
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:37,916
We're going on a hunt
for a suspicious man

309
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,291
who's been skulking
around town.

310
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,208
[SAIKI] You all ready made
your appearance!

311
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:42,958
Okay. Please take
your seats.

312
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:44,958
[SAIKI] She doesn't show up
often enough

313
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:45,958
to have a consistent design.

314
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,416
Class is in session.

315
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,750
[ALL] Yes, ma'am!
[SAIKI] Finally. I get a break.

316
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,916
[SHIMA] Who can solve this
question? Saiki?

317
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,416
[SAIKI] Oh, right.
Class is no break, either!

318
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,625
Lately, people have been acting
even stranger than usual.

319
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,083
C'mon, buddy!
Walk home with us.

320
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,375
The nerd says he wants
to talk about tomorrow.

321
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:03,583
Nendou!
You idiot!

322
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,083
[KUBOYASU]
Told you not to talk!

323
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,250
[NENDOU] He's my buddy!
[KUBOYASU] We're leaving!

324
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:10,041
Sorry. We've got plans
with just the three of us.

325
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,750
Nothing important!
[NENDOU GRUNTS]

326
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:14,791
[gasps then whistles]

327
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:18,291
This must be some
brand new type of bullying.

328
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,625
[KAIDOU] Man, Nendou almost
gave me a heart-attack.

329
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:23,250
[KUBOYASU] He was this close
to ruining our big hustle.

330
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,541
[TERUHASHI] You almost tipped
him off, too, Chiyo.

331
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:28,000
[YUMEHARA] Sorry! I promise
I'll be more careful.

332
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,625
Wait.
Where is Nendou?

333
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,083
Played it safe
and sent him home.

334
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,333
There's no way
his pea brain can keep up.

335
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:34,916
Good call.

336
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,166
When you've honed a plan
for as long as we have,

337
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,250
you can't afford to fail.
Now let's start the meeting!

338
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:44,333
At last, Operation: Surprise
Saiki" is kicking off tomorrow!

339
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,333
See? They're even
ganging up on me.

340
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:50,791
So, after school, Aren and I
will go up to him and say--

341
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,625
Wanna hang?
Sure!

342
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,541
We'll then go to my house.

343
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:57,625
We won't mention his birthday.
When we get there, I'll say--

344
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:58,666
I'm getting a drink.

345
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,750
That's Aren's cue

346
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,083
to take him
into the room.

347
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,875
Hey, why is this room
so dark?

348
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,625
Aren will then set off
a party cracker.

349
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,166
[pops]
Aah! Then you'll all say:

350
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,750
[ALL]
Happy Birthday!

351
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,000
Then, I'll bring the cake

352
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,666
and the surprise will be
a big success!

353
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,333
[TERUHASHI] I can't wait to see
the look on his face!

354
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:15,333
[SAIKI] This. The look on
my face will be this.

355
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:16,916
Seriously.
What am I gonna do?

356
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,916
I bet he'll look
something like this!

357
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,291
[SAIKI] Pretending to be
surprised?

358
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,000
I bet he freaks out,
just like this!

359
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,958
[SAIKI] Now they're one-upping
each other.

360
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,875
No! He'll scream
like I'm doing!

361
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,041
[SAIKI]
Dial it back, buddy.

362
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,041
His glasses will shatter!

363
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,708
How'd you do that?
Honestly,

364
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,041
I am pretty surprised.

365
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,041
[MERA] I'm impressed you
knew his birthday,

366
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,541
considering how private
he is.

367
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:39,500
I only knew about it because
I bumped into his mom.

368
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,083
She mentioned it in passing

369
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,416
[SAIKI]
Ah, got it.

370
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,375
Mom's the one who got
the whole ball rolling.

371
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,333
Tomorrow's gonna be
such a surprise,

372
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,958
There's no way he knows
that we know his birthday!

373
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,500
[SAIKI]
Oh, I'm surprised.

374
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:54,750
I'm surprised because
my birthday isn't tomorrow.

375
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,708
It's in August.

♪

377
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,958
So, like I said
10 seconds ago,

378
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:05,708
my birthday isn't
tomorrow.

379
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:08,583
That's why I didn't stop
their party plans until now.

380
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:12,000
I didn't consider anyone would
try to do something like that

381
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,000
three months ahead
of time.

382
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:16,375
Kaidou and the others
have planned a surprise party

383
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,416
for a middle aged man
who barely knows them.

384
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,250
Not only do I know
about the surprise,

385
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,125
they got my birthday
wrong.

386
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,375
This whole thing's a disaster
before it starts.

387
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:27,500
Hopefully, they'll realize this
and just cancel everything.

388
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,250
I'd rather this not be
my problem.

389
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,583
Did everyone remember
to get Saiki a present?

390
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:32,625
Kokomi and I got something.

391
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:33,791
It'll blow his mind!

00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,250
It's gonna taste delicious!
Yeah!

393
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,166
I should stop this
before any of them

394

a present.

Huh? Hairo what'd you buy?

[HAIRO] It's a wooden Buddha
statue I made by hand!

00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,625
I thought about Saiki
with every cut!

398
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:46,833
Took forever
to get right.

399

I'd never carved
anything before!

I really don't want that.

the truth

make that monstrosity.

We put a new spin
on the old birthday card.

get my name.

The musician from the manga
who didn't appear in the anime!

He doesn't have a voice

You're turning 17, huh?

make me happy?

Those other ones
almost qualify as harassment.

Saiki looked so happy
and full of life.

610
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,041
I've never see him
that social!

611
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,750
How can I get them
to leave?

612
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:53,166
But I have this weird feeling
something's wrong.

613
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,208
Like what?

614
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:55,416
Like he wasn't being himself.

615
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,208
[HAIRO]
Yeah, he seems pretty distant.

616
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:58,625
[MERA]
Yeah, I know what you mean.

617
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:00,666
[TERUHASHI] I wonder if
he's forcing himself

618
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,750
to get along with us.
[YUMEHARA] That'd be awful!

619
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:05,375
[KAIDOU] He should feel
comfortable around his friends!

620
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,000
Fine. Normal Kusuo Saiki
it is.

621
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:08,375
[NENDOU]
Hey, you're back!

622
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:10,250
[SAIKI]
Let's keep this party going!

623
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:11,791
[ALL]
Yeah!

[SAIKI]
What a pain.

627
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,291
My disastrous life
in the anime is over.

628
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:47,083
What? Another season?
No, no, no!

629
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:49,166
No one told me
anything about more episodes.

630
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,666
I'm tired of having adventures
with all these people.

631
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,375
Mostly.
Sometimes they're okay.

632
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:55,833
Well, that's it for now.
See you next time!
