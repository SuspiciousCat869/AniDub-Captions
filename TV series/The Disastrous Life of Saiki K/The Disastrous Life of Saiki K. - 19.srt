1
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,333
We're here. The air is always
so refreshing out here.

2
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:46,541
I can't get enough.

3
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:48,041
It's been a while,
hasn't it?

4
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:50,208
[SAIKI] We rode on the train
for an hour and a half,

5
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:51,458
then took a two-hour flight,

6
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:52,916
then another train
for two hours,

7
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,166
and finally
a 45-minute bus trip.

8
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,041
All to get to a whole lot
of nothing.

9
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:58,916
The reason we came
to the middle of nowhere

10
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,750
is that my grandparents
live here.

11
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:02,958
We're visiting them,
since I'm on spring break.

12
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:04,833
Oh, what are you doing now,
honey?

13
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,333
Isn't it obvious,
my love?

14
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:08,791
Look. I'm thanking this land
for nurturing you.

15
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:10,416
Oh, you're too much, honey.

16
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,833
But this place
is sure out of the way.

17
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:13,708
When we go home,
let's have Kusuo teleport us.

18
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:15,375
You know we can't do that.

19
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,291
My parents don't know
about Kuu's powers, remember?

20
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,583
Besides, a long journey can be
a fun chance for bonding.

21
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:21,208
That's true.
Hey, where'd you go?

22
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,125
[SAIKI] It's cold, so I went
home to get my gloves.

23
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,083
You know, you're really
spoiling the mood here!

24
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,583
[KURUMI] We're here!
[KUMI] Welcome.

25
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:29,375
Wow, look at you, Kusuo.
You've grown so much.

26
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:31,375
[SAIKI] That's my grandmother,
Kumi Saiki.

27
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,791
Yowsers, Mom. You're looking
as young as ever.

28
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:35,583
Oh, Kuniharu,
you sly flatterer.

29
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:38,125
[SAIKI] She's over 60, but looks
so young that most people

30
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,458
think she's in her 40s.

31
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:40,958
By the way,
about that last name.

32
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:42,958
My mom's maiden name
was Saiki too.

33
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,166
It's a weird coincidence,
but Dad always says...

34
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,000
Your mother and I were destined
to be together

35
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,541
before we were even born.
[SAIKI] Even as a kid I thought,

36
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:50,875
"Then the Satous must
have soul mates

37
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,083
all over the place, idiot."

38
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,708
But I didn't say that
to him.

39
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:56,083
Anyway, my grandmother
is a very nice person.

40
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,958
Honey, guess who's here.
Kurumi and her family.

41
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,833
[SAIKI]
The other one, not so much.

42
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,583
[KUMI]
Come say hello.

43
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:04,000
What a pain. It's so noisy,
a man can't read the paper.

44
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,625
[SAIKI] That's my grandfather,
Kumagorou.

45
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,208
Long time no see, Dad.

46
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,250
Why did you bother coming
all this way for no reason?

47
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,125
I know you don't mean that, Dad.
Kuu's here, too.

48
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,583
Been a while
since you've seen him.

49
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:13,791
[SAIKI]
Unlike my grandmother,

50
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,041
he's terse and unfriendly.

51
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:16,666
I take it
you've grown some.

52
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,166
[SAIKI]
He can be a little difficult.

53
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,166
Hey there, Dad.
It's great to see you.

54
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,083
Huh? Who the heck are you?
Get lost!

55
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:23,750
[SAIKI]
Actually, he's very difficult.

56
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,375
[KUMI] Despite what he says,
the truth is,

57
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,500
he's been looking forward
to your visit for weeks now.

58
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,708
Don't feed them such lies.
I'll be in the other room.

59
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,916
Let me know
when dinner is ready.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,875
Aw, he's as curmudgeonly
as ever.

61
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:36,958
Was coming here a bad idea?

62
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,875
[KUMI] Nonsense.
You're always welcome here.

63
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,666
Let's just leave him alone
for now.

64
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,000
Yeah, that's just how he is.

65
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:44,333
[SAIKI]
How he is, is frustrating.

66
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,166
My grandparents don't know
about my powers.

67
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,333
So while we're here with them,
I don't tell my parents

68
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,750
what I learn telepathically,
and they don't ask me.

69
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,375
I'm the only one
who knows his secret.

70
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,208
The reason he's such a pain is,

71
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:59,666
well, I hate to use the term
'cause it's kinda dated, but...

72
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,833
He's grown so much.
[KURUMI] He really has.

73
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,791
[KUMAGOROU] Oh, Kurumi,
I'm so glad you came.

74
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,833
[SAIKI]
My grandfather is a tsundere.

75
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,958
Ninety-nine percent of the time
he behaves coldly,

76
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,916
hiding his affectionate side
from everybody.

77
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,541
[KUMAGOROU]
This is Kumi's fault.

78
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,916
She said something embarrassing,
so I had to leave the room.

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,750
But I really want
to talk to them.

80
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,583
[SAIKI] Don't "wah."
You sound like a baby.

81
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:19,916
Wah!

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,500
[SAIKI]
Anyway, as you can see,

83
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,041
he's a real pain
in the neck.

84
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,541
[KUMI]
So how long has it been?

85
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:25,958
[KURUMI]
I don't know. About two years?

86
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:29,708
[KUMAGOROU] Two years,
122 days and six hours.

87
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,541
I can't get over how much
Kusuo has grown.

88
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:32,750
He's really something.

89
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,166
[SAIKI]
You could just tell me that.

90
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,875
[KUMAGOROU]
Come visit us more often.

91
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:37,916
Come back every week.
[SAIKI] Yeah, no.

92
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,583
Since he loves us so much,
I can't dislike the guy.

93
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,083
But he's still
super annoying.

94
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,208
[KUMAGOROU] Now let me hear
your beautiful voices.

95
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:45,416
[SAIKI]
Of course.

96
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,083
Have I ever told you
how cozy your house is?

97
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,166
[KUMAGOROU] No one wants to hear
you speak, you parasite.

98
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,041
[SAIKI] Oh, he actually does
hate my father.

99
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,708
So how long are you planning
to stay for?

100
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,416
Do you have to go
right back home tomorrow?

101
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,625
Well, let's see...

102
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,041
[KUMAGOROU]
Stay longer. Live here.

103
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,583
I guess we could stay
for a couple of days.

104
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,833
[KUMI] Oh, that's wonderful.
You can relax a bit.

105
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:02,791
- [KUMAGOROU] Yahoo!
- "Yahoo"?

106
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,541
[KUMAGOROU]
All right, this is great!

107
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,916
There's so much we can do I
don't even know where to start.

108
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,458
I'm gonna spoil them
with the pension money--

109
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,250
[KUNIHARU] I thought we were
staying one night,

110
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,750
so I only took two days off,
sorry.

111
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,250
Then I guess
we are leaving tomorrow.

112
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,791
[KUMAGOROU] My life is over.
[SAIKI] He aged fast.

113
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,625
It's hard for him
to take time off, so...

114
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:19,541
Well, I could
take off more time,

115
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,250
but I don't wanna be a bother,
especially for your dad.

116
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,458
Hey, Dad.

117
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,125
Only here to grab
the paper.

118
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,291
We were thinking about staying
for a couple of extra days.

119
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,125
Would that be a problem?
[KUMAGOROU] Tell them.

120
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,250
Tell them now.
Stay for three years.

121
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,625
Be brave.

122
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,208
Hm! Do what you want.

123
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,625
Thanks, Dad!

124
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,458
[KUMAGOROU]
Yeah!

125
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:42,041
[SAIKI] That's about as much
emotion as we'll see from him.

126
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,333
[KUMAGOROU]
Ah-ha-ha! I did it! I did it!

127
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,791
I get to spend three whole days
with my daughter and grandson.

128
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,458
[SAIKI]
Calm down and act your age.

129
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:55,500
[KUMAGOROU]
Oh, my, I'm so elated right now.

130
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,125
To think, I'll have more
quality time with the boy.

131
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,500
[SAIKI]
Are you a girl now?

132
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,125
[KUMAGOROU]
As if that weren't enough,

133
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,166
when I went in the other room
earlier...

134
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,166
heh, yes,
I finally did it!

135
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,708
I was able to touch my grandson
when I walked by him.

136
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm so happy.

137
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,458
That must be what
other grandparents call

138
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,291
"a tender embrace."
[SAIKI] Not really.

139
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,416
Oh, right, I almost forgot.
We brought you a gift.

140
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,666
I hope you like it.

141
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,875
[KUMI] Oh, castella.
[KURUMI] Yep.

142
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,416
Dad loves it, right?

143
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,791
Oh, does he? I'm impressed
you remembered that.

144
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,166
Of course I would.
[SAIKI] Knock it off

145
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,000
before he starts
weeping again.

146
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,416
[KUMAGOROU]
My daughter picked out a gift

147
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,166
just because she thought
I'd like it.

148
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,250
Though, to be honest,
I don't much care for castella.

149
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,500
But still, the love behind it
brings a lump to my throat.

150
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,250
[SAIKI] Don't cry if you don't
even like it.

151
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,083
Well, shall we eat it
together now?

152
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,666
[KUMI]
Here, this one's for Grandpa.

153
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,916
Kuu, take that slice to him.

154
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,625
My grandson's coming?

155
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:41,958
My grandson's coming in here.

156
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,958
What do I do?
I've gotta do something.

157
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,875
[knock on door]
Aah! He's here!

158
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,083
What now?

159
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,875
Hey, Dad, I brought castella
for you.

160
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:52,041
I hope you enjoy it.

161
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,416
- Go away!
- So sorry!

162
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,000
All I did was bring him
some cake and tea.

163
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,250
[SAIKI] Sorry. I kind of didn't
wanna go in there.

164
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,375
[KUMAGOROU] You jerk.
Why did you have to bring it?

165
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:02,958
I'd take anyone but you.

166
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:04,666
[SAIKI]
I have no choice.

167
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,208
I was expecting
to see my grandson!

168
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,041
Huh? Huh?

169
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,875
Well, what is it now?
Do you want something?

170
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:12,791
[SAIKI] He can still act tough
in that position?

171
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,416
In a way,
it's kind of impressive.

172
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,333
Most people caught
in this situation would panic.

173
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:17,833
But an expert
tsundere like him

174
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,250
doesn't appear
to be shaken at all.

175
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,166
[KUMAGOROU]
It's my grandson!

176
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,333
[SAIKI] But, of course, in his
head it's a different story.

177
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,583
[KUMAGOROU] Darn it!
He saw me acting like a fool.

178
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:28,750
Aah! I'm alone with him now.
I don't know what to do anymore.

179
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,291
[SAIKI]
You're creeping me out, old man.

180
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,083
Well, I'm just gonna
leave this here and go.

181
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:34,166
[KUMAGOROU] No! He's leaving!
I have to stop him.

182
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,583
Don't pass up this opportunity
to talk to the boy.

183
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,000
Say something.

184
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,708
Aah, he's gone! Stupid.

185
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:42,875
And after Kusuo went through all
that trouble to bring the cake.

186
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,208
I'm hopeless.
Just a stubborn old man

187
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:48,125
who even now worries so much
about his dignity and appearance

188
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,083
that he can't show affection
for his own grandson.

189
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm gonna die alone.

190
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,541
[SAIKI]
This is just sad.

191
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:56,416
You've been tsundere
a lot longer than I have,

192
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,083
so I'll show affection
this time.

193
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:00,208
[gasps]

194
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:01,500
[MALE NARRATOR]
And so the two of them

195
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:04,000
sat there eating castella
in silence.

196
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:07,541
[KUMAGOROU]
Tell me, Kusuo,

197
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:08,916
is there a girl you like?

198
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,958
[SAIKI]
What? Ew, no way.

199
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,708
[KUMAGOROU]
Come now. You're already 16.

200
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,041
You should live a little.

201
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,625
In that case,
come closer, Grandpa Kuma.

202
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,458
[KUMAGOROU] Why, you wanna
whisper something?

203
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:21,541
Promise not to tell
Mom and Dad, okay?

204
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:22,750
[gasps]

205
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,833
[KUMAGOROU]
Oh, it was just a dream.

206
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,125
Hm.

207
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:33,958
[KUNIHARU] I had no idea
there was an amusement park

208
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,250
around these parts.

209
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,333
[KURUMI]
I totally forgot it existed.

210
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,875
We used to go there all the time
when Kurumi was little.

211
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,125
The hot spring
would've been nice,

212
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,750
but I guess this could
be kind of fun.

213
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:43,958
Hm! What a pain!

214
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,458
Why do I have to waste
my afternoon

215
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:46,791
at an amusement park?

216
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,708
[KUMI] Oh, come on, honey.
We'll have a good time.

217
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,041
For goodness' sake, who even
suggested this stupid idea?

218
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,250
[SAIKI]
You did.

219
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,708
You know,
come to think of it,

220
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:56,083
I wonder what that brochure
was doing out there.

221
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,166
[KUMAGOROU] Hot springs
are no place for children.

222
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,000
We should go somewhere fun
so that my grandson

223
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,333
will want to keep
coming back.

224
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,708
I can just see the big smile
on his face.

225
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:07,458
[SAIKI] Seriously, how old
do you think I am, anyway?

226
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,125
[KUNIHARU]
It should be around here.

227
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,000
Could this be it?

00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:14,166
[crows squawk]

229
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,041
[KUNIHARU] Uh, did I make
a wrong turn somewhere?

00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,833
[ALL] This is it.
[SAIKI] This is it?

00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:20,666
Wow, I haven't been here
in so long!

232
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,041
Is this place even safe?
[SAIKI] How should I know?

233
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,458
Bet it's been 20 years.

234
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:26,958
That run-down old sign,

235
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,958
the Ferris wheel
that's always out of order,

236
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,291
the roller coaster parts
so rusty

237
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,375
they look like
they're about to break.

238
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,291
They haven't changed a bit
since I was last here.

239
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:35,625
[SAIKI]
Wish they had.

240
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,250
[KUNIHARU]
Seriously, is this place safe?

241
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:38,875
I mean, the roller coaster
is running

242
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,291
and it seems like they're open
for business, but...

243
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,041
What the...?

244
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,041
Should we go home?
[SAIKI] Good idea.

245
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:50,000
What goes in
the question mark box?

246
00:09:56,916 --> 00:10:00,375
Say, honey, maybe we should give
up on this place and go to the--

247
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,291
Here, I got us all
some free passes.

248
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,333
Kusuo, you can ride
anything you like.

249
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:07,208
Wow, thank you.
What should we ride first, Kuu?

250
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,708

The car that takes us home.

251
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,875
[KURUMI] We've gotta try
the roller coaster, right?

252
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,541
[SAIKI]
No, we don't.

253
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:15,000
- No, not the roller coaster.
- What? Why not? Are you afraid?

254
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,291
[SAIKI]
Not the way you're thinking.

255
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:17,958
There's nothing to be scared of.

256
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:20,708
I rode it all the time as a kid.
Let's go. We came all this way.

257
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,958
[KUNIHARU] Well, those people
riding it before survived,

258
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,375
so I guess it's okay.

259
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,791
[KURUMI]
Here, hurry up and sign this.

260
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,750
[KUNIHARU] Sign what?
[KURUMI] It's a waiver.

261
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,291
What else would it be?

262
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,583
You always have to sign
one of these

263
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,250
before riding a roller coaster,
right?

00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,000
You too, Kuu.

on the safety bar.

Kusuo, should anything
go wrong here,

I don't want you
to worry about me.

Please just look out
for your mother.

[SAIKI] Riding a roller coaster
shouldn't require

00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:48,291
this kind of resolve.
[WOMAN] Hold on tight.

273
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:49,583
[SAIKI]
Since I'm a psychic,

274
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,416
this is all pretty boring
for me.

275
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,416
I don't have to simulate
the experience of flying,

276
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,250
because I can actually fly.

Hm, my grandmother's skirt

280
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:00,958
is short
for this weather.

Oh, we're finally at the peak.

282
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,666
Now all that's left
is the drop.

283
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,500
Uh, Kusuo,
I think my safety bar went up.

What's wrong with him?

[groaning]

288
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:20,041
- The sky is so beautiful.
- Was it that scary?

289
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,833
Hmph! He should try
being a man for once.

290
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,208
Now, now, honey.

291
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,916
[KUMAGOROU]
He took advantage of the fact

292
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,583
that I can't ride
roller coasters

293
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,875
and swooped in to sit next to
my precious grandson, the jerk.

294
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,000
And on top of that,
he clung to him the whole time,

295
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,250
to rub it in my face.

296
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,166
I hate him.
He makes me so jealous.

297
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,333
How can you
call yourself a man?

Wait, how can you?

299
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,166
Well, you know,
maybe next we should try

going on something
that's not so intense.

Oh! Oh, look. The Ferris wheel
is actually moving!

00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,166
Come on, guys,
let's all ride together.

304
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,791
You'll be okay on that one,
right, honey?

305
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,708
Yeah. I can manage.

306
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,541
[KURUMI]
Aah! He's aging rapidly.

307
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,291
[SAIKI]
He's traumatized.

308
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,916
I'm sorry about this.
I'll take care of him.

309
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,666
You guys can go ride
the Ferris wheel without me.

310
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,875
Hang in there, honey.

311
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,083
[KUNIHARU]
Suppertime already?

312
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,500
I hope that he's okay.

313
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,333
Ugh, he really is pathetic.

314
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,000
Well, you two
enjoy the ride.

315
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,291
[KUMAGOROU]
What? You're not coming?

316
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:12,625
[KUMI]
Oh, did you forget?

317
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,916
I'm not really
a big fan of heights.

318
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,625
[MAN] Please no standing
while the ride is in motion.

319
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,541
[KUMAGOROU] I'm alone
with my grandson again.

320
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,500
This is great.
My heart is pounding.

321
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,041
Ka-thunk, ka-thunk, ka-thunk.

322
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,458
I wasn't able to speak
with him at all yesterday,

323
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:28,208
but now I'll find a way
to talk to him for sure.

324
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,375
What should I say?

325
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,666
Stories about the war.

326
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,083
No, wait, I was born
after the war.

327
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,708
Oh, that's right.

328
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:37,458
I should ask if he likes school,
and what his favorite class is.

329
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:40,541
I practiced responses yesterday.
Okay, here goes.

330
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:41,833
[inhales deeply]

331
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:43,458
Ugh, darn it.

332
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,291
"Ugh" is the only thing
that came out.

333
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,208
Now we'll just end up
not talking at all again.

334
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,541
[SAIKI]
Fine with me.

335
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,708
[KUMAGOROU]
He really is pathetic.

336
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,583
I mean, collapsing after
a theme park ride?

337
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:55,500
Honestly, I don't get
what Kurumi sees in him.

338
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:56,833
He's a good-for-nothing loser.

339
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,875
Whatever you do,
don't become like him.

340
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,416
Yes! I can finally talk to him.
Let's keep going.

341
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,416
It must be awfully tough for you
to have a father like that.

342
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,541
If you're ever in any trouble,
I'd be happy to--

343
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:09,416
Aah! What's going on?

344
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,125
[SAIKI] He may be a hopeless,
unreliable father,

345
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,708
but he's still my dad,

346
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,000
and I don't like it
when anybody else insults him.

347
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,708
[KUMAGOROU] Aah!
[KUMI] Oh, my goodness.

348
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,583
That's the one your father
and Kusuo are in.

349
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,708
But what in the world
is Kuu doing that for?

350
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,916
[KUMAGOROU] I don't understand!
What is happening? Help me!

351
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,750
[SAIKI] Now your true self
is starting to come out.

352
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,458
Maybe I'll shake it harder
and reveal more.

353
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,416
Kusuo, just hold on to me.

354
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,791
I'll keep you safe,
no matter what happens, okay?

355
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,708
[SAIKI]
Sorry. That wasn't like me.

356
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,458
I went too far.

357
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,458
Anyway, I'm impressed
that he had the composure

358
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,791
to try and save me
in a scary situation.

359
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,500
He is different from Dad.
[panting heavily]

360
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,916
Guess I should thank him.

361
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:52,958
The sky's real nice.

362
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,333
The sky is real blue.

363
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,208
[SAIKI] Huh, they're two
of a kind after all.

364
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:04,625
Time to go!

365
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,291
We're leaving already?

366
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,041
[KURUMI] Honey,
your bedhead's as crazy as ever.

367
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,750
Dad's giving us a ride,
so hurry up and get ready.

368
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,916
It'll be lonely
with them gone.

369
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,791
Huh! Yeah, good riddance.

370
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,083
I'm going to miss them.

371
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,458
Wish I could make them
stay longer.

372
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:18,916
Oh, that's it.

373
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,625
[KURUMI]
Thank you for having us.

374
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,458
It was nice to spend time
together as a family.

375
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:23,791
We'll be back.

376
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,833
Oh, I hope that
we can come back soon.

377
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,750
[KUMAGOROU] You may be back
sooner than you think.

378
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,166
[SAIKI] What a pain.
He's up to something again.

379
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,833
What time's our train leaving?

380
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:34,666
There are only two or three out
of here a day, so if we miss it,

381
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,208
then we'll be--
[KUMAGOROU] Oh, darn.

382
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,041
I ran out of gas.

383
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,583
What? For real?
This is terrible.

384
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,458
There aren't any gas stations
around here.

385
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,625
Oh, how careless of me.
[SAIKI] Seriously, old man.

386
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:44,625
This is sad.

387
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,166
[KUMAGOROU]
I siphoned the gas

388
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,583
before we left.

389
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,416
Forgive me,
Kurumi and Kusuo.

390
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,166
This is my final
selfish act.

391
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,666
What do we do now?
If we're late,

392
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,250
the next train won't leave
until dusk,

393
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,875
and we won't
make it home tonight.

394
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,083
What a pickle.

395
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,333
Even if you walk from here,

396
00:14:58,416 --> 00:14:59,625
you'll never
make it on time.

397
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,125
Guess it's back
to our house now.

398
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,583
[SAIKI]
Your acting could use some work.

399
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:05,833
Huh? What's that, Kuu?
Look inside the trunk?

400
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,458
[KUNIHARU]
There's a gas can.

401
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,333
[KUMAGOROU]
What? That's not where I put it.

402
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:10,833
[KURUMI]
Wait, so you knew you had that?

403
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,625
[KUMAGOROU]
Well, it's for emergencies.

404
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:15,208
[SAIKI] Of course I knew
all about his little plot,

405
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,208
so I put that in the trunk
before we left.

406
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,625
[KUMAGOROU]
What is going on?

407
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,375
But I don't understand.
How did you guys know

408
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:21,958
there would be a spare
gas can in the trunk?

409
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:24,041
[SAIKI]
You've gotta say something.

410
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,000
Just tell her I saw it
from the back seat.

411
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:29,041
Well, um, it was just a hunch,
I guess. Or not. I don't know.

412
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,750
But who cares about
the how or why, right?

413
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,541
[SAIKI]
Your acting could use work too.

414
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:35,041
And maybe mysterious powers
were at play-- I mean, not that!

415
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,833
I don't know anything about
mysterious powers!

416
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,666
Who said anything
about mysterious powers?

417
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,916
[SAIKI] The old "reveal it while
trying to cover it up" cliché.

418
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,500
Great, she's even more
suspicious now.

419
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,500
I don't really mind
if they find out.

420
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,541
I mean, they are
my grandparents.

421
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,250
If I remember right,
it was around the time

422
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,791
I was in second grade.

423
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,750
My parents were going
to tell them about me, but...

424
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,375
[KUUSUKE]
You probably shouldn't do that.

425
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,208
There's no way any normal people
will accept him.

426
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,750
And if Grandma and Grandpa find
out that he's a freak of nature,

427
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,666
they'll be so shocked that their
hearts will stop working.

428
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,666
[SAIKI]
Just remembered a nuisance.

429
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,583
[tires screech]
Hey, what's wrong now?

430
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,416
You shouldn't brake
so suddenly, Dad.

431
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,125
Look up ahead there.

432
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:13,333
Whoo-hoo! I couldn't have asked
for anything better than this.

433
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:14,541
Oh, no.

434
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,750
[KUMAGOROU]
What a miracle!

435
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,583
Well, that's that.
Looks like we have no choice.

436
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,333
Sorry, but we have to head back
to our house.

437
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,583
[SAIKI]
Try not to sound too happy.

438
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:22,791
[KUNIHARU]
This isn't good.

439
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,291
[KURUMI] Too far
to make it on foot.

440
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,750
Well, Kusuo could
move all this,

441
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,625
but we've got your parents
with us, so...

442
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,916
What are you doing?
Get back in the car.

443
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:34,041
[KURUMI] Kuu?
[SAIKI] I think it's time.

444
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,250
[gasps]

445
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,458
[KUMAGOROU]
What's he doing?

446
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,166
Oh, now you too?
Where are you going?

447
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,458
[KUMI] There's something you
have to tell us about Kusuo,

448
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,958
- isn't there?
- How did you?

449
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,458
[KUMI]
That much I could figure out.

450
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:44,833
Since yesterday.

451
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,958
No, for a long time,
something seemed off.

452
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:49,125
Sweetie, did you know that
since you were a little girl,

453
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,333
whenever you'd lie, you would
always hide both of your thumbs?

454
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:54,250
[SAIKI] Come on, there were
more obvious signs than that.

455
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:55,875
Don't worry, sweetie.

456
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:58,041
The two of us have been around
a lot longer than you guys.

457
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:00,375
There's not much that can
shock us these days.

458
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,458
Okay, then we can show you.

459
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:05,458
Kusuo has psychic powers.

460
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:06,875
[both scream]

461
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,500
[SAIKI]
Guess you can still be shocked.

462
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:10,083
You're not even making noise.

463
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,333
[KUMI]
Psychic powers?

464
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:12,833
You mean like
sleight of hand?

465
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:15,291
[KURUMI]
Well, close, but not quite.

466
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:16,833
[KUMAGOROU]
Wait, sidekick powers?

467
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,333
[KURUMI]
Okay, getting colder.

468
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:19,583
Uh, yeah,
it's probably easier

469
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,333
if he just shows you
what he can do.

470
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:22,791
Levitation.

471
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,208
Pyrokinesis.

472
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:25,916
Teleporting.

473
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
[both gasp]

474
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,625
[KUNIHARU] They're still
not getting it.

475
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,208
Well, how about psychokinesis?

476
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:33,500
That's enough. I can understand
Kusuo's powers fine now.

477
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:36,375
I just need some time to think.
Leave me alone.

478
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:39,000
He can teleport?
Seriously?

479
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,750
If he can do that,
then why haven't they all

480
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,500
come to see us more often?

481
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,166
Wait, if he can read
people's minds,

482
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,666
then that means he's hearing
my thoughts right now.

483
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,333
[SAIKI]
Loud and clear.

484
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,041
[KUMI]
Well, it certainly was a shock

485
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:53,208
to learn about Kusuo's
abilities, now wasn't it?

486
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:56,208
You know, I'm wondering if that
might've been the reason why--

487
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:59,375
I'm talking about Kusuo's
older brother, Kuusuke.

488
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:02,166
[KUMI]
Ah. You may be right.

489
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,625
[SAIKI]
Fill in the blank.

490
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,541
[KAIDOU]
It's Dark Reunion's doing.

491
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,083
[SAIKI]
What else could it have been?

492
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,000
[SAIKI]
Just as I thought.

493
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,000
Wearing this ring at school
makes me feel uneasy.

494
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:18,125
But the reason
I've got it on today is,

495
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,333
I'm trying to avoid spoilers
for the super popular game,

496
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:23,875
"The Horrific Life of Saitou K:
Monsters Beyond Limits,"

497
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:25,958
which came out yesterday.
Normally I'm not interested

498
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:27,916
in new video games,
but this one's based

499
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,458
on a manga I really like,
so I've gotta play it.

500
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,458
The game stars the amazing
Kunio Saitou.

501
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,083
Yes, that Saitou.

502
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,166
I was actually planning to buy
it as soon as it came out,

503
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,708
but then Nendou got in my way,
so I couldn't.

504
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,666
I had to ask Mom
to go out and get it for me

505
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,541
while I'm at school today.

506
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,750
When I get home,
Saitou will be waiting for me.

507
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:45,958
Hey there, Saiki.

508
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,416
Whoa, what's gotten into you?

509
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,166
[SAIKI] Since I'm not
using telepathy,

510
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,625
he caught me off guard.

511
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,416
Maybe I should just
take off the silencer ring.

512
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,750
There's no way anybody could've
beaten the game in one day.

513
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,125
[KAIDOU]
Anyway, Saiki,

514
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,083
have you played that new
Kunio Saitou game yet?

515
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,250
I stayed up all night
and beat every level.

516
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,250
[SAIKI] He did? Guess I can't
take this off after all.

517
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,875
I'll just have to put up with it
till school's over.

518
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,250
Finally.

519
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,625
I'm going straight home.
[KAIDOU] Hey, Saiki.

520
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,000
[SAIKI]
Kaidou again?

521
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,666
What should I do?

522
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,500
Psychokinesis.

523
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:20,375
[GIRL] What's this?
<i>Tome of This Mortal Existence?</i>

524
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,958
[SAIKI] You shouldn't
leave that in your desk.

525
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,875
Okay, now to get out of here.

526
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,500
Who cares about him?

527
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,750
[TAKAHASHI]
Hm? What's the matter, Saiki?

528
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,291
[SAIKI]
Whoops, wrong choice.

529
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:33,875
Here, let's try this again.

530
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:35,583
[TAKAHASHI]
Hm? What's going on?

531
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:36,791
I feel really hot.

532
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,166
[SAIKI]
No difference.

533
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,583
Well, I'll choose apport

534
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,125
and exchange him for something
of equal value.

535
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,708
Of course,
his monetary value is zero.

536
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,625
So our school uniform
costs the same amount

537
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,416
as a Japanese-style toilet, huh?

538
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,875
Damn it. Since dealing
with Takahashi took so long,

539
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,666
I wasn't able
to avoid Teruhashi.

540
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,083
I bet she's looking for me.

541
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:58,208
All right. I'll just slip out
of here while I'm transparent.

542
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,750
[TORITSUKA]
What're you doing, Saiki?

543
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,208
[SAIKI]
Toritsuka is a psychic medium,

544
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:05,041
so he can still see me
when I'm transparent.

545
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,500
And if someone touches me,
I become visible.

546
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:08,833
After which,
I have to wait a minute

547
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,166
before I can use
that power again.

548
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,125
So now what?

549
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:14,125
[Toritsuka groans]

550
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,166
Good thing no one else
is around.

551
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,791
[HAIRO] Oh, Saiki,
would you like to go

552
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,333
to the tennis club with me?

553
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:20,500
[SAIKI]
Another nuisance.

554
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,166
I have no choice.
[HAIRO] Great.

555
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,250
Let's bunny-hop
to the tennis court together.

556
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:26,625
[SAIKI]
It worked.

557
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:30,041
I used hypnosis to have
Toritsuka appear as me.

558
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,333
Saiki, I heard there's something
interesting behind the school.

559
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,333
Wanna check it out?
[SAIKI] I don't know what it is,

560
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:37,083
but I know that it's something
I have zero interest in.

561
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:38,166
What now?

562
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,250
What the heck
does "Boil eggs" mean?

563
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:41,666
Give me all your money!

564
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,833
I can't stand half-assed punks
like you.

565
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:46,208
[SAIKI] Not what I expected,
but it worked.

566
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,541
[grunting]

567
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:51,000
And what is it
with the side-stepping?

568
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,041
I have no choice.
It'll take longer,

569
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,750
but I'll have to take
a different route.

570
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,833
[TAKAHASHI] Somehow, I wound up
soaking wet in a toilet.

571
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:59,541
Even worse, this is the only
change of clothes I found.

572
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:00,833
This sucks.

573
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,208
[SAIKI]
I don't know where he changed,

574
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,875
but with that armor on,
I can exchange him

575
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,208
for something more valuable
than before.

576
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:08,041
Huh, another toilet.

577
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,583
Kusu-emon.
[SAIKI] What's he doing here?

578
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:14,291
It looks like Mr. Aso's manga
won't make it on time.

579
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:15,708
Help, Kusu-emon.

580
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,125
[SAIKI]
Who's that?

581
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,166
[KUMAGOROU]
So this is Kusuo's school.

582
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,083
[SAIKI] Another pain
in the neck showed up.

583
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:26,208
I'll give him this
if he lets me pass.

584
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:30,541
Whoa! Kusuo, you're such a kind
and considerate grandson.

585
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:31,916
Kusuo, let's play a game.

586
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,041
Let's play
that Saitou game together.

587
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,958
I stayed up all night
and cleared all the levels

588
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,375
in order to play with you.

589
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,250
[SAIKI] The final boss
was my grandfather.

590
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:40,541
What do I do now?

591
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:43,250
Guess I'll just save here
for the time being.

592
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,416
[sighs]
I shouldn't beat it in one shot.

593
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,083
It's better to savor it.
But it's a pretty awesome game.

594
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,500
By the way,
I just want to stress

595
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,541
this is <i>The Horrific Life</i>
<i>of Saitou K.</i>

596
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:55,250
The main character's face may
look like mine on the screen,

597
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:56,916
but that's only
because I used hypnosis

598
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,791
to make Saitou's face
appear as mine.

599
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:03,166
This is not a game
that stars Kusuo Saiki.

600
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,958
I repeat, this is not a game
that stars Kusuo Saiki.

601
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,250
However, since this is
a wonderful game, I'd like you,

602
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:12,125
my friends, watching this on TV,
to try playing it anyway.

603
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:23,166
[singing in Japanese]

604
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:44,333
[SAIKI] As I mentioned briefly
at the start of this episode,

605
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:46,583
I was on spring break,
so now a new school term
