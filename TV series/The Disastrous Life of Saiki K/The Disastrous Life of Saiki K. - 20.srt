00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,375
--[SAIKI] Your favorite show.
--Out of a hundred cases,

595
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:17,625
I'll 100 percent solve 100.

596
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,208
I'll catch a hundred crooks.

597
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,958
I'm the 100-million
horsepower detective!

598
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,375
[SAIKI]
I don't remember that phrase.

599
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:23,833
[KAIDOU]
It's just like on TV!

600
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,500
You know, I can do more
requests for you.

601
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,500
This is 100-percent bold,
but do your line

602
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,375
from <i>Hundreds of Hundreds</i>
<i>of Hundred Dollar Bills.</i>

603
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:31,416
--[SAIKI] Dumbest title ever.
--This 100-mile journey

604
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,791
will take a lot more
than 100 steps.

605
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,583
<i>The Hundredaire.</i>
Do that one.

606
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,875
I'd give 100-million-volt shock
to 100 ladies' hearts,

607
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:38,750
before I'd give you
a hundred chocolates.

608
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:40,708
--[SAIKI] That's horrible.
<i>--Hundred-Handed Fighter.</i>

609
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:43,500
A hundred men, 100 times,
under 100 stars on 100 nights.

610
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,791
--[SAIKI] What is that about?
--[KAIDOU] Now do the big one!

611
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:47,916
The era of 100 flowers blooming!
[SAIKI] Enough.

612
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,625
One hundred yen, 100 men,
100 percent, 100 million.

613
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:52,041
[MAN]
You still don't get it.

614
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:55,125
--[SAIKI] Who said that?
--[MAN] I shall explain.

615
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:57,000
[SAIKI]
Hundredth episode?

616
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:58,541
[MAN]
That's right. This episode

617
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,291
is actually the 100th
of those we've done.

618
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,208
In order to make you
aware of it--

619
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:03,916
[SAIKI] But it's not
a hundred episodes.

620
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,833
I know we did this
for the 99th week of the manga,

621
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:07,166
but the anime
is only 20 weeks in.

622
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,458
Uh...

623
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:09,708
[SAIKI]
And he's gone.

624
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:11,958
Wait, who was that?

625
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:14,291
♪

626
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:44,041
[SAIKI] In case you've been
wondering, even if you haven't,

627
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:46,375
the town I live in
is called Hidariwakibara-cho.

628
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,291
I may have mentioned it,
I'm not sure.

629
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:50,541
Maybe go back and rewatch all
the episodes to double-check.

630
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:53,541
Anyway, next time on
<i>The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.</i>

631
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:56,833
I don't really want to, but
we'll go visit him in London.
