00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:23.258 position:50% align:center
The prince fell in
love with Cinderella

00:06:23.341 --> 00:06:25.301 position:50% align:center
as soon as he laid
eyes upon her.

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:27.345 position:50% align:center
He eagerly claimed
the first dance.

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:28.555 position:50% align:center
How about not?!

00:06:28.638 --> 00:06:30.098 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid that's not an option.

00:06:30.181 --> 00:06:31.266 position:50% align:center
[KYO growls]

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:33.893 position:50% align:center
Oh, there's <i>yakiniku</i> .

00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:35.437 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Hey, goth girl!

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.440 position:50% align:center
Dance with me. Right now!

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:43.153 position:50% align:center
No.

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:44.529 position:50% align:center
She turned me down.

00:06:44.612 --> 00:06:45.947 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
Why do you sound so relieved?

00:06:46.031 --> 00:06:48.116 position:50% align:center
[HIROSHI] Undaunted,
the prince asked again.

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:49.743 position:50% align:center
[KYO] Maybe the prince
doesn't want to.

00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:51.036 position:50% align:center
You ever think about that?

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:53.371 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
Just get your ass back there!

00:06:53.455 --> 00:06:55.915 position:50% align:center
So, um... Hi.

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:57.334 position:50% align:center
I'm busy now.

00:06:57.417 --> 00:07:00.337 position:50% align:center
You only came for the
<i>yakiniku</i> , didn't you?

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.423 position:50% align:center
[HANAJIMA]
Well? What do you want?

00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:07.677 position:50% align:center
[KYO] Um, I thought
maybe... we could talk.

00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:10.680 position:50% align:center
[HANAJIMA]
You want to talk? Very well.

00:07:10.764 --> 00:07:12.307 position:50% align:center
There's an especially
pleasant tingle

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:14.768 position:50% align:center
to the waves this evening,
don't you think?

00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:16.895 position:50% align:center
Or, you know, we could
talk about something

00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:18.688 position:50% align:center
that's not creepy and awkward.

00:07:18.772 --> 00:07:20.607 position:50% align:center
[bell tolls]

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.025 position:50% align:center
[HANAJIMA]
Oh, the bell.

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:23.693 position:50% align:center
Alas, I must depart.

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:25.111 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Yes!

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.450 position:50% align:center
[HANAJIMA]
Here. You can have my slipper.

00:07:30.533 --> 00:07:34.287 position:50% align:center
Um, I'm no great actor, but
that read was pretty lacking.

00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:37.207 position:50% align:center
Cinderella knew that the fairy
godmother's spell would break

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.417 position:50% align:center
with the tolling
of the midnight hour.

00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:42.962 position:50% align:center
And so, she regretfully tore
herself from the prince's side.

00:07:43.046 --> 00:07:47.050 position:50% align:center
I could've eaten so much
more meat. Too bad.

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:48.134 position:50% align:center
[HIROSHI]
But she did leave behind

00:07:48.218 --> 00:07:51.054 position:50% align:center
one of her glass slippers.

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:53.473 position:50% align:center
You should be able to
use this to find her.

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:57.435 position:50% align:center
Huh? No thanks.
I think I'll pa--

00:07:57.519 --> 00:07:59.229 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI] You've got a
chance to see her again

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:00.939 position:50% align:center
and you're just
gonna throw it away?

00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:02.190 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Jeez!

00:08:02.273 --> 00:08:03.274 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI] Do you know how
many people out there

00:08:03.358 --> 00:08:05.860 position:50% align:center
are dying to see someone
they care about?

00:08:05.944 --> 00:08:08.613 position:50% align:center
I miss him. I really miss him.

00:08:08.697 --> 00:08:11.533 position:50% align:center
Come and see me, dammit!

00:08:11.616 --> 00:08:12.867 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
uh, what?

00:08:12.951 --> 00:08:14.703 position:50% align:center
[HIROSHI] This impassioned,
if somewhat baffling

00:08:14.786 --> 00:08:17.747 position:50% align:center
and weirdly personal speech
persuaded our young hero

00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:19.290 position:50% align:center
to take action.

00:08:19.374 --> 00:08:22.961 position:50% align:center
Yes. He came to an
important realization.

00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:26.798 position:50% align:center
He knew in his heart that
he must see her again!

00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:31.177 position:50% align:center
[KYO] I literally said nothing
about wanting to see her again.

00:08:31.261 --> 00:08:33.555 position:50% align:center
[HIROSHI] And so, the prince
traveled the kingdom,

00:08:33.638 --> 00:08:36.683 position:50% align:center
forcing all the young women
to try on the glass slipper.

00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:38.852 position:50% align:center
He knew that when he
found the foot it fit,

00:08:38.935 --> 00:08:41.312 position:50% align:center
he would be reunited
with his love.

00:08:41.396 --> 00:08:45.400 position:50% align:center
After a long journey,
he arrived at Cinderella's home.

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:47.402 position:50% align:center
This slipper does
not belong to me.

00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:50.697 position:50% align:center
Are there any other fair maidens
in your household it may fit?

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.074 position:50% align:center
No one else here
matches that description.

00:08:53.158 --> 00:08:55.326 position:50% align:center
Well, too bad. Guess we'll go.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:56.828 position:50% align:center
No, wait, please!

00:08:56.911 --> 00:08:59.372 position:50% align:center
There is one. Cinderella's here.

00:08:59.456 --> 00:09:00.415 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Hm?

00:09:00.498 --> 00:09:04.461 position:50% align:center
Hey! Let's just
leave her out of it!

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:06.379 position:50% align:center
[HIROSHI] Prince,
could you not assault people

00:09:06.463 --> 00:09:07.964 position:50% align:center
for saying their lines?

00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:09.674 position:50% align:center
[HANAJIMA]
Unhand her at once.

00:09:09.758 --> 00:09:11.051 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:12.635 position:50% align:center
[HANAJIMA] I won't allow
anyone to harm my sister,

00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:15.388 position:50% align:center
no matter how exalted
their station may be.

00:09:15.472 --> 00:09:17.515 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Cinderella!

00:09:17.599 --> 00:09:20.602 position:50% align:center
I was wondering how long
it would take you to find me.

00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:25.231 position:50% align:center
Highness, that slipper is
indeed the one I left with you.

00:09:25.315 --> 00:09:26.941 position:50% align:center
I'd like it back.

00:09:27.025 --> 00:09:29.486 position:50% align:center
[MAN A] This Cinderella's
got serious attitude.

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:32.280 position:50% align:center
[MAN B] Why is she always
eating something?

00:09:32.364 --> 00:09:35.116 position:50% align:center
[HANAJIMA]
I know why you have come.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.911 position:50% align:center
Clearly, you're here to ask for
my sister's hand in marriage.

00:09:37.994 --> 00:09:39.204 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:43.166 position:50% align:center
What? No way! I'm not!
Are you crazy?

00:09:43.249 --> 00:09:46.836 position:50% align:center
Well, sir, you did come here to
find a wife, so she's not wrong.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.338 position:50% align:center
Um, Sister?

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:52.967 position:50% align:center
[KYO] Uh. Wait, no. That's not
why I'm here. Seriously!

00:09:53.051 --> 00:09:55.804 position:50% align:center
[HANAJIMA]
Then... you came for me?

00:09:55.887 --> 00:09:57.055 position:50% align:center
How awful.

00:09:57.138 --> 00:09:59.766 position:50% align:center
Hey, it's not like I'm
happy about it, either.

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:02.686 position:50% align:center
Well, Prince, what
is it that you want?

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:05.230 position:50% align:center
Why not just tell me
what the hell you want?

00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:09.651 position:50% align:center
[HANAJIMA] Someday,
will you admit the truth?

00:10:09.734 --> 00:10:12.612 position:50% align:center
Or will you keep deceiving
yourself forever?

00:10:12.696 --> 00:10:14.781 position:50% align:center
Will you stay as you are?

00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:18.076 position:50% align:center
Locked in your palace
alone and isolated...

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:21.204 position:50% align:center
...until the day you die?

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:24.457 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
So what if I do?

00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:28.169 position:50% align:center
It's not like it hurts
anyone else but me.

00:10:28.253 --> 00:10:29.838 position:50% align:center
What does it matter
if I choose to--?

00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:34.300 position:50% align:center
No, please! I don't want that!

00:10:34.384 --> 00:10:38.096 position:50% align:center
I--! I...

00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:41.683 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Um! I'm so sorry
for interrupting!

00:10:41.766 --> 00:10:43.435 position:50% align:center
Please forget I said anything.

00:10:43.518 --> 00:10:45.478 position:50% align:center
I-I don't know what
I'm talking about.

00:10:45.562 --> 00:10:48.773 position:50% align:center
Ignore me and just
continue on with the story.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:55.864 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
She doesn't... want... that.

00:10:58.533 --> 00:11:00.869 position:50% align:center
I apologize for
the interruption.

00:11:00.952 --> 00:11:04.414 position:50% align:center
There you are. I wondered where
my loyal servant had gone.

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:06.082 position:50% align:center
I am not your servant,

00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:08.418 position:50% align:center
but I do know that a marriage
between you and the prince

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:10.253 position:50% align:center
would not end well.

00:11:10.337 --> 00:11:15.967 position:50% align:center
So let me ask you again:
What do you truly wish for?

00:11:16.051 --> 00:11:18.928 position:50% align:center
[HANAJIMA] I want to run a
<i>yakiniku</i> shop with my sister.

00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:21.890 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE] She's not letting
the meat thing go, is she?

00:11:21.973 --> 00:11:23.350 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:11:23.433 --> 00:11:25.602 position:50% align:center
Your venture will have the
prince's financial support.

00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:28.605 position:50% align:center
You're supposed to be the one
making wishes come true.

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:31.649 position:50% align:center
Prince, I won't ask what
it is you wish for.

00:11:31.733 --> 00:11:34.194 position:50% align:center
You'll just have to see
it through on your own.

00:11:34.277 --> 00:11:35.487 position:50% align:center
Uh!

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.614 position:50% align:center
[ADMIRERS] Such a wise
and magnanimous judgment!

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:39.157 position:50% align:center
--Wait!
--He's so cool!

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.576 position:50% align:center
[HIROSHI] Thus, not long after
their first fateful meeting,

00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:44.621 position:50% align:center
Cinderella and the
prince parted ways.

00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:46.664 position:50% align:center
But the <i>yakiniku</i>
shop flourished.

00:11:46.748 --> 00:11:49.125 position:50% align:center
And Cinderella, having
thoroughly demonstrated

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:52.295 position:50% align:center
that a woman's livelihood does
not depend upon marriage,

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:55.465 position:50% align:center
proceeded to live
happily ever after.

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:58.218 position:50% align:center
That was supposed
to be <i>Cinderella</i> ?

00:11:58.301 --> 00:12:00.261 position:50% align:center
No, not quite.

00:12:00.345 --> 00:12:02.889 position:50% align:center
We said it was <i>Cinderella</i> -ish.

00:12:03.932 --> 00:12:05.392 position:50% align:center
[KYO sighs]

00:12:05.475 --> 00:12:10.355 position:50% align:center
It's over. I'll die before
I do another damn play.

00:12:10.438 --> 00:12:13.858 position:50% align:center
Uh. Hold on! You can't
get undressed out here!

00:12:13.942 --> 00:12:16.653 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] Oh, really?
So you played opposite him?

00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:17.737 position:50% align:center
[HANAJIMA]
Yes.

00:12:17.821 --> 00:12:20.990 position:50% align:center
Saki Hanajima.
It's lovely to meet you.

00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:22.534 position:50% align:center
Kazuma Soma.

00:12:22.617 --> 00:12:24.452 position:50% align:center
Thank you for
performing with Kyo.

00:12:24.536 --> 00:12:26.246 position:50% align:center
[KYO grunts]

00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:28.748 position:50% align:center
Master. What--?
What--? What are...?

00:12:28.832 --> 00:12:31.084 position:50% align:center
It sounds like you've
been working hard.

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:33.545 position:50% align:center
[HANAJIMA]
Indeed. Truly.

00:12:33.628 --> 00:12:35.755 position:50% align:center
If I did well,
it's only because I had

00:12:35.839 --> 00:12:38.842 position:50% align:center
such a talented actor
alongside me.

00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:41.428 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Kyo. You were great.

00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:42.846 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:45.515 position:50% align:center
If you'll excuse me, I should
probably get changed.

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:48.309 position:50% align:center
I hope we meet again. Farewell.

00:12:48.393 --> 00:12:50.520 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Yes. See you.

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:52.355 position:50% align:center
An endearing classmate
you have there.

00:12:52.439 --> 00:12:53.690 position:50% align:center
[KYO screams]

00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:55.025 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
No!

00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:58.820 position:50% align:center
Master. Please don't marry her.

00:12:58.903 --> 00:13:01.281 position:50% align:center
What a strange thing to be
getting worked up about.

00:13:01.364 --> 00:13:03.241 position:50% align:center
You're still such
a child, aren't you?

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:04.325 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, that sounds better

00:13:04.409 --> 00:13:06.327 position:50% align:center
than bein' a clueless
old geezer!

00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:07.537 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Hold on.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.372 position:50% align:center
Who told you about the
play in the first pl--?

00:13:09.456 --> 00:13:10.290 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I wonder.

00:13:10.373 --> 00:13:12.250 position:50% align:center
I guess that answers that.

00:13:12.334 --> 00:13:14.502 position:50% align:center
I can't ever tell if you're
trying to piss me off

00:13:14.586 --> 00:13:16.546 position:50% align:center
or if it just happens
by accident.

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:19.174 position:50% align:center
I thought it would
make your dad happy.

00:13:19.257 --> 00:13:21.593 position:50% align:center
[KYO] He might be happy,
but I'm humiliated!

00:13:21.676 --> 00:13:24.971 position:50% align:center
You wouldn't want your parents
seeing you like that, either.

00:13:25.055 --> 00:13:27.182 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Let the poor boy go, Kyo.

00:13:27.265 --> 00:13:28.767 position:50% align:center
I'm going home now.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:29.809 position:50% align:center
What?

00:13:29.893 --> 00:13:32.020 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Oh, but before I do,

00:13:32.103 --> 00:13:35.190 position:50% align:center
I thought I'd take this chance
to say hello to Tohru.

00:13:35.273 --> 00:13:37.776 position:50% align:center
Do you know where I'd find her?

00:13:37.859 --> 00:13:41.404 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I don't want that. I--!

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.033 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
I dunno.

00:13:45.116 --> 00:13:48.745 position:50% align:center
Not like it's my job to keep
tabs on her or anything.

00:13:50.163 --> 00:13:51.956 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:55.043 position:50% align:center
All right. I can talk
to her some other time.

00:13:55.126 --> 00:13:56.127 position:50% align:center
I'll get going, then.

00:13:56.211 --> 00:13:58.213 position:50% align:center
Huh? No, hey, wait a sec.

00:13:58.296 --> 00:14:01.007 position:50% align:center
I'll walk you out.
Let me get changed.

00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:05.553 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
No. It couldn't be.

00:14:05.637 --> 00:14:09.099 position:50% align:center
There's no way...
that's how she feels.

00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:11.643 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI sneezes]

00:14:11.726 --> 00:14:13.937 position:50% align:center
That was a big sneeze!
Are you sick?

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.522 position:50% align:center
Nah, it's just allergies.

00:14:15.605 --> 00:14:18.400 position:50% align:center
My nose was itching like crazy
the whole time I was on stage.

00:14:18.483 --> 00:14:19.901 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow.

00:14:19.984 --> 00:14:22.404 position:50% align:center
That must have been rough,
but you still did a great job.

00:14:22.487 --> 00:14:27.033 position:50% align:center
Oh, ya think so? You made
a pretty cute stepsister.

00:14:27.117 --> 00:14:30.578 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
Come and see me, dammit!

00:14:30.662 --> 00:14:34.207 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI] I'm off. I wanna
go catch the next play.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:35.875 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Uo- <i>chan</i> .

00:14:35.959 --> 00:14:37.168 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
Hm?

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:41.381 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Well, um...

00:14:41.464 --> 00:14:43.383 position:50% align:center
I promised to meet up
with Momiji and the others

00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:44.843 position:50% align:center
when we were done.

00:14:44.926 --> 00:14:47.595 position:50% align:center
You're going back in
to watch <i>Mito Komon</i> ?

00:14:47.679 --> 00:14:48.805 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's it.

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:51.057 position:50% align:center
I've really been lookin'
forward to that one.

00:14:51.141 --> 00:14:53.101 position:50% align:center
'Kay, see ya later, then.

00:14:55.562 --> 00:14:57.188 position:50% align:center
[KISA]
There you are!

00:14:57.272 --> 00:14:59.315 position:50% align:center
I know that voice!

00:14:59.399 --> 00:15:01.943 position:50% align:center
Tohru, hi!

00:15:02.027 --> 00:15:04.279 position:50% align:center
--My little Kisa!
--You did great out there!

00:15:04.362 --> 00:15:06.281 position:50% align:center
The play was super fun.

00:15:06.364 --> 00:15:07.490 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you came!

00:15:07.574 --> 00:15:09.784 position:50% align:center
Me, too! You were so good!

00:15:09.868 --> 00:15:12.871 position:50% align:center
Oh, not really. I just
did my best, that's all!

00:15:12.954 --> 00:15:15.540 position:50% align:center
I recorded it, start
to finish. Later...

00:15:15.623 --> 00:15:17.292 position:50% align:center
Hey, guys, look.

00:15:17.375 --> 00:15:17.834 position:50% align:center
Uh!

00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:19.336 position:50% align:center
That's great.

00:15:19.419 --> 00:15:22.297 position:50% align:center
So, um, you can watch it without
the recorder thingy, then?

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.175 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI] Absolutely!
I can make a DVD of it.

00:15:25.258 --> 00:15:27.385 position:50% align:center
Wow. That sounds wonderful.

00:15:27.469 --> 00:15:30.138 position:50% align:center
Do you think I could have a copy
of the DVD when it's done?

00:15:30.221 --> 00:15:32.849 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Sure thing!

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:35.352 position:50% align:center
Or I could give it
straight to Kureno.

00:15:35.435 --> 00:15:36.936 position:50% align:center
[gasps, squeals]

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:38.480 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
But how did you know?

00:15:38.563 --> 00:15:39.606 position:50% align:center
Was I right?

00:15:39.689 --> 00:15:43.693 position:50% align:center
I knew it! I'm amazing.
A real gumshoe!

00:15:43.777 --> 00:15:45.236 position:50% align:center
Only one grandpa prevails!

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.446 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Not quite.

00:15:46.529 --> 00:15:48.114 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Those aren't even
from the same show.

00:15:48.198 --> 00:15:52.410 position:50% align:center
I'm just kidding. Honestly,
Arisa kind of gave it away.

00:15:52.494 --> 00:15:55.789 position:50% align:center
I figured I would have an
easier time getting it to him.

00:15:55.872 --> 00:16:00.168 position:50% align:center
Maybe not tomorrow, or the day
after, but sooner or later,

00:16:00.251 --> 00:16:03.505 position:50% align:center
I should be able to sneak
him a copy somehow.

00:16:03.588 --> 00:16:05.757 position:50% align:center
So just leave it to me!

00:16:07.258 --> 00:16:08.009 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Momiji.

00:16:08.093 --> 00:16:09.344 position:50% align:center
That's my name.

00:16:09.427 --> 00:16:11.554 position:50% align:center
We should go.
It's almost our shift.

00:16:11.638 --> 00:16:13.098 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Oh, right!

00:16:13.181 --> 00:16:16.017 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. We need to get back
and help out with our class.

00:16:16.101 --> 00:16:17.185 position:50% align:center
Yes, go ahead.

00:16:17.268 --> 00:16:19.062 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you guys
have a lot to do,

00:16:19.145 --> 00:16:22.774 position:50% align:center
and I'd be happy to take over
showing these two around.

00:16:22.857 --> 00:16:25.485 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Please keep a close eye on Kisa.

00:16:25.568 --> 00:16:28.363 position:50% align:center
Of course. I'll take
good care of her.

00:16:28.446 --> 00:16:29.698 position:50% align:center
[KISA giggles]

00:16:29.781 --> 00:16:30.657 position:50% align:center
Hiro.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:31.658 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:16:31.741 --> 00:16:33.702 position:50% align:center
You're cute, too, so be careful.

00:16:33.785 --> 00:16:36.830 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
I can take care of myself!

00:16:36.913 --> 00:16:41.251 position:50% align:center
You know what, Haru?
That's the problem with you.

00:16:41.334 --> 00:16:44.462 position:50% align:center
You're kind. Too kind.

00:16:44.546 --> 00:16:46.840 position:50% align:center
It's like you can't
stop yourself.

00:16:46.923 --> 00:16:50.010 position:50% align:center
That's probably what
made Rin so sad.

00:16:52.387 --> 00:16:53.471 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:53.555 --> 00:16:54.931 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
I'm an idiot!

00:16:55.015 --> 00:16:57.267 position:50% align:center
I lost my temper and took it
out on someone else again.

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:59.644 position:50% align:center
I told myself I'd
stop doing that!

00:16:59.728 --> 00:17:00.311 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Hiro.

00:17:00.395 --> 00:17:01.563 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:01.646 --> 00:17:04.899 position:50% align:center
You just brought up Rin
out of the blue. Why?

00:17:04.983 --> 00:17:06.484 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
That's right!

00:17:06.568 --> 00:17:09.612 position:50% align:center
I'm not even supposed to know
they were a couple or anything.

00:17:09.696 --> 00:17:11.990 position:50% align:center
Ugh! Think before
you speak, Hiro!

00:17:12.073 --> 00:17:16.161 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Are you...
in love with Rin?

00:17:16.244 --> 00:17:19.748 position:50% align:center
Huh?! Wh-What the heck
are you talking about?!

00:17:19.831 --> 00:17:23.960 position:50% align:center
You can't be serious right now!
You are such an idiot! Ugh!

00:17:24.044 --> 00:17:26.087 position:50% align:center
Let's get outta here, Kisa.

00:17:29.591 --> 00:17:33.386 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Is it possible Isuzu
and Hatsuharu were...?

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:36.056 position:50% align:center
[KISA]
Hiro- <i>chan</i> ....

00:17:36.139 --> 00:17:40.352 position:50% align:center
Does he really like
her... that way?

00:17:41.353 --> 00:17:44.314 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Hi, guys. Anything to report?

00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:45.857 position:50% align:center
[NAOHITO] There's was one
complaint about noise

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.193 position:50% align:center
and some idiots got
into a fistfight.

00:17:48.276 --> 00:17:50.153 position:50% align:center
Kimi's sorry she didn't
get to come watch it!

00:17:50.236 --> 00:17:53.281 position:50% align:center
Fortunately, the vice president
resolved both issues.

00:17:53.365 --> 00:17:55.742 position:50% align:center
However, he never
returned after that,

00:17:55.825 --> 00:17:59.162 position:50% align:center
and to top it all off,
Kuragi's gone missing now, too!

00:17:59.245 --> 00:18:01.664 position:50% align:center
Stop your inane chattering!

00:18:01.748 --> 00:18:04.668 position:50% align:center
Go patrol and keep an eye out
for those other two slackers

00:18:04.751 --> 00:18:06.211 position:50% align:center
while you're at it!

00:18:07.754 --> 00:18:10.674 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] He's in an even worse
mood than usual. Wonder why.

00:18:10.757 --> 00:18:12.676 position:50% align:center
[UPPERCLASSMAN A]
Are you just going to ignore us?

00:18:12.759 --> 00:18:14.135 position:50% align:center
Say something!

00:18:14.219 --> 00:18:15.929 position:50% align:center
[UPPERCLASSMAN B]
Hello, anyone home?

00:18:16.012 --> 00:18:17.389 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Mach--

00:18:17.472 --> 00:18:20.934 position:50% align:center
Looks like we've got some
bullies on our hands. Gross.

00:18:21.017 --> 00:18:22.852 position:50% align:center
That hurt! What are
you doing here?

00:18:22.936 --> 00:18:26.356 position:50% align:center
Isn't it obvious, Prez?
I'm out on patrol.

00:18:26.439 --> 00:18:27.982 position:50% align:center
While eating <i>yakisoba</i> ?

00:18:28.066 --> 00:18:30.318 position:50% align:center
What can I say?
I'm a multi-tasker.

00:18:30.402 --> 00:18:32.195 position:50% align:center
Right, whatever.
We need to go help her.

00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:33.780 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Slow your roll.

00:18:33.863 --> 00:18:35.365 position:50% align:center
Involving yourself
in their business'll

00:18:35.448 --> 00:18:37.450 position:50% align:center
only add fuel to the fire.

00:18:37.534 --> 00:18:40.078 position:50% align:center
Plus, you're the cause
of the conflict, Yun-Yun.

00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:41.287 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I am?

00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:42.831 position:50% align:center
[MANABE] Those girls
are your devoted fans.

00:18:42.914 --> 00:18:44.082 position:50% align:center
More reason to step in.

00:18:44.165 --> 00:18:46.167 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Hey, real talk:

00:18:46.251 --> 00:18:48.044 position:50% align:center
If you're only gonna be
friendly to somebody

00:18:48.128 --> 00:18:50.797 position:50% align:center
in a half-assed sorta way,
it's honestly kinder

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.425 position:50% align:center
if you just ignore them
right from the get-go.

00:18:53.508 --> 00:18:57.137 position:50% align:center
Besides, she needs to learn
how to stick up for herself.

00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:00.015 position:50% align:center
If she can't do that,
it's partly on her.

00:19:01.599 --> 00:19:05.061 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Yeah, you're right.
It's a fair point.

00:19:05.145 --> 00:19:10.900 position:50% align:center
Ideally, we should all be able
to defend ourselves. Except...

00:19:10.984 --> 00:19:12.444 position:50% align:center
There are people
who wind up crushed

00:19:12.527 --> 00:19:14.738 position:50% align:center
by that kind of thinking.

00:19:15.739 --> 00:19:19.284 position:50% align:center
Ugh! Guess I'll go come up
with a plan, then.

00:19:19.367 --> 00:19:20.493 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Uh.

00:19:20.577 --> 00:19:23.580 position:50% align:center
Stay here and stop 'em
if it gets physical.

00:19:23.663 --> 00:19:25.623 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGISHI] Look, you brought
this on yourself.

00:19:25.707 --> 00:19:28.752 position:50% align:center
I told them what you said about
Soma- <i>senpai</i> not being a prince.

00:19:28.835 --> 00:19:31.379 position:50% align:center
That's right.
I don't think he is.

00:19:31.463 --> 00:19:32.213 position:50% align:center
Is that a problem?

00:19:32.297 --> 00:19:33.715 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you bet it is.

00:19:33.798 --> 00:19:36.593 position:50% align:center
You have no right to think
something like that. Apologize!

00:19:36.676 --> 00:19:37.844 position:50% align:center
Okay, sorry.

00:19:37.927 --> 00:19:40.180 position:50% align:center
[UPPERCLASSMEN] That was
the lamest apology ever!

00:19:40.263 --> 00:19:43.683 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Nothing physical yet,
but they are being pretty cruel.

00:19:43.767 --> 00:19:46.311 position:50% align:center
Do you have a secret crush
on him or something?

00:19:46.394 --> 00:19:47.479 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:19:47.562 --> 00:19:49.022 position:50% align:center
[UPPERCLASSMAN B]
Don't act all innocent!

00:19:49.105 --> 00:19:52.150 position:50% align:center
[UPPERCLASSMAN A] Tell us what
you really think about Yuki!

00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:55.737 position:50% align:center
He's an airhead.

00:19:57.322 --> 00:20:00.492 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
An airhead? I'm an airhead? Me?

00:20:00.575 --> 00:20:04.996 position:50% align:center
[MACHI] And also... I think
that he seems lonely.

00:20:06.498 --> 00:20:09.209 position:50% align:center
Even though he's
surrounded by people,

00:20:09.292 --> 00:20:13.797 position:50% align:center
worshipped like a prince,
he seems lonely.

00:20:15.882 --> 00:20:17.425 position:50% align:center
[UPPERCLASSMAN B]
That... can't be right.

00:20:17.509 --> 00:20:19.010 position:50% align:center
It's not.

00:20:19.094 --> 00:20:21.262 position:50% align:center
She just wants to act like she
knows something that we don't!

00:20:21.346 --> 00:20:22.305 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:22.389 --> 00:20:24.557 position:50% align:center
[dinging]

00:20:24.641 --> 00:20:26.768 position:50% align:center
[PA A] At three o' clock,
we'll be having a photo op

00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:28.436 position:50% align:center
with our very own President Yuki

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:30.480 position:50% align:center
in front of the
student council room!

00:20:30.563 --> 00:20:32.524 position:50% align:center
What could be better than
a picture with the president

00:20:32.607 --> 00:20:33.858 position:50% align:center
to remember the festival?

00:20:33.942 --> 00:20:35.443 position:50% align:center
Please know space is limited.

00:20:35.527 --> 00:20:38.571 position:50% align:center
People will be admitted in the
order in which they arrive.

00:20:38.655 --> 00:20:40.490 position:50% align:center
No way! How'd I not
know about that?!

00:20:40.573 --> 00:20:42.617 position:50% align:center
What time is it now?!

00:20:42.701 --> 00:20:44.077 position:50% align:center
[UPPERCLASSMEN]
Hold on! Wait for us!

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.745 position:50% align:center
I can't miss out on
a chance like this!

00:20:45.829 --> 00:20:46.788 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Whew!

00:20:46.871 --> 00:20:47.872 position:50% align:center
looks like the
broadcast committee

00:20:47.956 --> 00:20:49.958 position:50% align:center
came through just in time.

00:20:50.041 --> 00:20:52.127 position:50% align:center
That was the plan
you thought up?

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:54.546 position:50% align:center
[MANABE] Got rid of those
girls. I'd say that's a win.

00:20:54.629 --> 00:20:58.591 position:50% align:center
Except... now I have to do
a stupid photoshoot.

00:20:58.675 --> 00:21:00.885 position:50% align:center
Come on, it's for Machi!

00:21:02.512 --> 00:21:05.974 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Just now...
Machi said I'm an airhead.

00:21:06.057 --> 00:21:08.935 position:50% align:center
Sorry, was that news to you?

00:21:09.019 --> 00:21:12.564 position:50% align:center
Also, she said I'm not a prince.

00:21:12.647 --> 00:21:13.648 position:50% align:center
Hm?

00:21:13.732 --> 00:21:16.443 position:50% align:center
Oh. I see. That
might explain it.

00:21:16.526 --> 00:21:19.112 position:50% align:center
A while ago, she started to
say somethin' about you.

00:21:19.195 --> 00:21:21.740 position:50% align:center
Maybe, but he doesn't seem...

00:21:21.823 --> 00:21:22.866 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:22.949 --> 00:21:24.284 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
Forget it.

00:21:24.367 --> 00:21:26.828 position:50% align:center
Could that be what
she was getting at?

00:21:26.911 --> 00:21:29.706 position:50% align:center
You're not a prince, huh? Hmm...

00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:32.584 position:50% align:center
I think she might
have a point, there.

00:21:32.667 --> 00:21:33.877 position:50% align:center
Princess.

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:39.215 position:50% align:center
Ow! Sorry! I won't say
it again, I swear! Ow!

00:21:39.299 --> 00:21:41.426 position:50% align:center
Princess!

00:21:45.472 --> 00:21:47.474 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Tohru?

00:21:47.557 --> 00:21:49.601 position:50% align:center
Hi, Kyo. How's it going?

00:21:49.684 --> 00:21:51.978 position:50% align:center
Fine. What's with all the stuff?

00:21:52.062 --> 00:21:54.439 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Kisa and Hiro
came up to school to visit.

00:21:54.522 --> 00:21:56.941 position:50% align:center
I'm just bringing
them some food.

00:21:57.025 --> 00:21:58.902 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Hmm...

00:22:00.612 --> 00:22:01.905 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Uh...

00:22:01.988 --> 00:22:04.282 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] The festival
sure is fun this year.

00:22:04.366 --> 00:22:06.743 position:50% align:center
Are you having a
good time so far?

00:22:06.826 --> 00:22:09.996 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess. Got the crap
scared outta me, though.

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:12.165 position:50% align:center
Master showed up out of nowhere.

00:22:12.248 --> 00:22:13.583 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Master was here?

00:22:13.667 --> 00:22:15.335 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry I missed him.

00:22:15.418 --> 00:22:17.045 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
There's no way.

00:22:17.128 --> 00:22:19.255 position:50% align:center
It would be stupid...

00:22:19.339 --> 00:22:21.549 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
It would be silly...

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:25.428 position:50% align:center
[BOTH] ...to even let
myself think that.

00:23:57.228 --> 00:23:58.772 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
"Here you are."
