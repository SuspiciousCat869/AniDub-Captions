00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:14.431 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I didn't think much
about her at first.

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:17.350 position:50% align:center
In the beginning, she was
just a weird classmate

00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:20.937 position:50% align:center
who we discovered
living in a tent.

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:22.480 position:50% align:center
I invited her to live with us

00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:25.442 position:50% align:center
because she was alone
and needed help.

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:28.153 position:50% align:center
But part of me also did it
out of a stupid desire

00:00:28.236 --> 00:00:31.865 position:50% align:center
to rebel against the Somas
and the zodiac curse.

00:00:33.575 --> 00:00:36.619 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
And then, she said something--

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:40.415 position:50% align:center
so purely and sincerely.

00:00:40.498 --> 00:00:42.709 position:50% align:center
I do have one thing to ask you.

00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:45.754 position:50% align:center
If I forget you,
please befriend me again.

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:19.723 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
A mother?

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:22.851 position:50% align:center
She's like some kinda
mother figure to you?

00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:26.521 position:50% align:center
Okay, yeah. I get it, man.

00:02:26.604 --> 00:02:28.440 position:50% align:center
No, that's a lie.
I don't get it.

00:02:28.523 --> 00:02:30.483 position:50% align:center
D'you wanna borrow
my mom, instead?

00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:32.027 position:50% align:center
[YUKI chuckles]

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.905 position:50% align:center
It's just something
I'd always wanted.

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:41.036 position:50% align:center
My whole life, I'd never had
a parent who truly loved me.

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:45.457 position:50% align:center
That's why it meant so much.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.126 position:50% align:center
She'd sit there and
listen to me complain

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.420 position:50% align:center
without getting bored
or frustrated.

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:52.964 position:50% align:center
She just accepted me.

00:02:54.132 --> 00:02:56.634 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] She wasn't
disgusted by my weakness

00:02:56.718 --> 00:02:59.262 position:50% align:center
or embarrassed by my flaws.

00:03:00.805 --> 00:03:05.560 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
It made me happy. Gave me peace.

00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:09.564 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Her kindness overcame my pain.

00:03:09.647 --> 00:03:12.400 position:50% align:center
To sleep knowing I'm
loved unconditionally.

00:03:12.484 --> 00:03:14.527 position:50% align:center
Like a child
abandoning my worries

00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:17.322 position:50% align:center
and entrusting myself
to someone else,

00:03:17.405 --> 00:03:20.075 position:50% align:center
in a place where
I'll be protected.

00:03:21.826 --> 00:03:26.706 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Rin... Was that
how she felt, too?

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.958 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I yearned for a mother.

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:32.671 position:50% align:center
To finally know what
that love felt like.

00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:37.258 position:50% align:center
I found that... in Miss Honda.

00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:39.636 position:50% align:center
Even though she's our age?

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:41.096 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Mhm.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.890 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Strange as it is,

00:03:43.973 --> 00:03:46.226 position:50% align:center
I think the first time
I realized what I felt

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:49.020 position:50% align:center
was that night.

00:03:49.104 --> 00:03:52.607 position:50% align:center
The night Kyo
transformed and ran off.

00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:53.692 position:50% align:center
When she went after him,

00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:57.320 position:50% align:center
she looked like a
woman, not a girl.

00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:04.744 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I don't know why, but
she seemed different somehow.

00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:09.249 position:50% align:center
It's difficult to explain.
I found myself drawn to her.

00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:12.293 position:50% align:center
Not romantically,
but as a mother.

00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:14.879 position:50% align:center
Someone safe.

00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:17.132 position:50% align:center
I didn't have an agenda.

00:04:17.215 --> 00:04:18.842 position:50% align:center
All I wanted was
a comfortable place

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:23.805 position:50% align:center
where someone would
look after me, always.

00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:26.016 position:50% align:center
Then I panicked.

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:29.477 position:50% align:center
I mean, when I realized
what I was thinking,

00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:31.980 position:50% align:center
I was so confused.

00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:35.191 position:50% align:center
Not to mention
incredibly embarrassed.

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:39.112 position:50% align:center
I wasn't sure how to deal
with it, so I didn't.

00:04:39.195 --> 00:04:43.199 position:50% align:center
I shut it away, immediately.

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:46.953 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I stuffed those feelings down.

00:04:47.037 --> 00:04:48.538 position:50% align:center
Teased and flirted.

00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:52.751 position:50% align:center
Like a normal guy
with a girl he likes.

00:04:52.834 --> 00:04:55.295 position:50% align:center
But still, it felt wrong.

00:04:55.378 --> 00:04:57.213 position:50% align:center
[whistle blows]

00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:58.673 position:50% align:center
[SOCCER STUDENT B]
Gather up!

00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:01.176 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
I dunno.

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:03.595 position:50% align:center
You sure you're being
honest with yourself?

00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:05.805 position:50% align:center
I mean, people hook up with
partners who remind them

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.768 position:50% align:center
of their parents all the time.

00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:11.353 position:50% align:center
Maybe you're twisting
things up in your head

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:13.605 position:50% align:center
'cause you figure you've
lost her to somebody else.

00:05:13.688 --> 00:05:17.484 position:50% align:center
You know. Orange hair.
Kyo, right?

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:20.403 position:50% align:center
You don't think you stand
a chance against him.

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:22.781 position:50% align:center
That's not it.

00:05:22.864 --> 00:05:25.450 position:50% align:center
Yeah, a part of me
wants to be like him.

00:05:25.533 --> 00:05:29.913 position:50% align:center
And he sees her like I can't--
with different eyes.

00:05:31.414 --> 00:05:34.668 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
He loves her in a way I don't.

00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:38.588 position:50% align:center
And she... The way
she looks at him...

00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:42.300 position:50% align:center
But that's not the reason
I feel like this.

00:05:42.384 --> 00:05:43.843 position:50% align:center
Not being able to beat him--

00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:47.472 position:50% align:center
whether it's good or bad,
whether it's right or wrong--

00:05:47.555 --> 00:05:50.350 position:50% align:center
I couldn't care less
about any of that!

00:05:52.143 --> 00:05:53.269 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
There are couples out there

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:55.563 position:50% align:center
like the ones you mentioned.

00:05:55.647 --> 00:05:57.857 position:50% align:center
And if it works for them, great.

00:05:57.941 --> 00:06:01.111 position:50% align:center
I'm glad they've found
someone to be with.

00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:04.572 position:50% align:center
They want that, but I don't!

00:06:04.656 --> 00:06:07.367 position:50% align:center
That isn't what <i>I</i> want!

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.994 position:50% align:center
It would be hollow.

00:06:10.078 --> 00:06:12.205 position:50% align:center
And so lonely.

00:06:13.415 --> 00:06:17.252 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] This time, I want
to discover it on my own.

00:06:17.335 --> 00:06:19.754 position:50% align:center
Using my own strength.

00:06:21.131 --> 00:06:23.425 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I want to move forward again,

00:06:23.508 --> 00:06:26.011 position:50% align:center
and I finally feel like I can,

00:06:26.094 --> 00:06:29.514 position:50% align:center
because your kindness
gave me courage.

00:06:29.597 --> 00:06:34.728 position:50% align:center
With it, I have faith that
the darkness won't win.

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:39.941 position:50% align:center
This time, I won't waste
the chance you've offered me.

00:06:40.025 --> 00:06:43.236 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I don't know when
to give up. I never have.

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:45.238 position:50% align:center
I'm too greedy.

00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:49.367 position:50% align:center
I want it too much.

00:06:49.451 --> 00:06:51.786 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I'm alive...

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:56.166 position:50% align:center
...and somehow, I'll find
my place in this world.

00:06:58.293 --> 00:07:00.003 position:50% align:center
[MANABE] I don't think
I've ever seen anybody

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:02.922 position:50% align:center
grab at life so desperately.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.095 position:50% align:center
Don't cry, Yun-Yun!

00:07:10.305 --> 00:07:12.640 position:50% align:center
That hurt!

00:07:12.724 --> 00:07:14.559 position:50% align:center
You wanna give me a bloody nose?

00:07:14.642 --> 00:07:15.852 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
What's your problem?!

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:17.687 position:50% align:center
I'm tryin' to cheer you up!
Gimme your phone!

00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:19.898 position:50% align:center
I'll get a shot of your
nose gushing blood!

00:07:19.981 --> 00:07:22.317 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Not gonna happen!
It's in my bag!

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.485 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Huh?!

00:07:23.568 --> 00:07:24.903 position:50% align:center
What's the point of
having a cell phone

00:07:24.986 --> 00:07:27.947 position:50% align:center
if you're not gonna
keep it-- Ah!

00:07:28.031 --> 00:07:31.701 position:50% align:center
[KIMI] Kakeru, you meanie.
You're so violent.

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:33.953 position:50% align:center
What are you doing to
poor, sweet Yun-Yun?

00:07:34.037 --> 00:07:36.247 position:50% align:center
You got what you deserved.

00:07:36.331 --> 00:07:38.541 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Kimi. Did you
come looking for me?

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:39.709 position:50% align:center
[KIMI]
Mh-hm.

00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:41.711 position:50% align:center
Kimi worried when you
didn't come back.

00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:45.256 position:50% align:center
Uh, ya know... maybe somebody
should be worried about me?

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:46.966 position:50% align:center
Are you feeling any better now?

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.301 position:50% align:center
--[MANABE] Or not...
--Better?

00:07:48.385 --> 00:07:50.053 position:50% align:center
[KIMI] Yeah, your tummy
was a little upset

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:51.930 position:50% align:center
from the paint fumes earlier.

00:07:52.013 --> 00:07:53.473 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:55.892 position:50% align:center
I think it cleared up.

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:57.560 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Maybe it's because
I shared something

00:07:57.644 --> 00:08:00.271 position:50% align:center
I'd never told anyone before.

00:08:00.355 --> 00:08:03.400 position:50% align:center
Doin' all right now?
Good for you, man.

00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:04.901 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Maybe it's because someone from

00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:09.197 position:50% align:center
a totally different world
listened to what I had to say.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:13.034 position:50% align:center
Maybe it's because...
he's actually very kind.

00:08:13.118 --> 00:08:15.704 position:50% align:center
Hey, Nabe. Pass the ball back.

00:08:15.787 --> 00:08:17.247 position:50% align:center
'Kay!

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.667 position:50% align:center
Aw, no fair! What did
you talk about?

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.378 position:50% align:center
You aren't keeping secrets
from Kimi, are you?

00:08:23.461 --> 00:08:24.838 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
We just chatted.

00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:26.631 position:50% align:center
About painful stuff.

00:08:26.715 --> 00:08:29.384 position:50% align:center
Oh. Yeah? Was it dirty?

00:08:29.467 --> 00:08:31.136 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Why's that always
the first guess?

00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:33.888 position:50% align:center
'Cause it's awesome.

00:08:33.972 --> 00:08:38.268 position:50% align:center
So, if you can tell me all
those things, why not her?

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:41.396 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] If I did,
it would only worry her.

00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:47.068 position:50% align:center
And right now... she's got
her own burdens to deal with.

00:08:47.152 --> 00:08:49.154 position:50% align:center
We'll be living together
a little longer--

00:08:49.237 --> 00:08:51.698 position:50% align:center
till graduation, at least.

00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:53.158 position:50% align:center
The thing about Miss Honda is,

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:55.785 position:50% align:center
she puts others
ahead of herself.

00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:58.204 position:50% align:center
So it would probably
just weigh her down.

00:08:58.288 --> 00:09:00.582 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
You're such a serious dude.

00:09:00.665 --> 00:09:02.876 position:50% align:center
Must get boring.

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:07.213 position:50% align:center
Wait, hold on. So you got
no problem burdening me?

00:09:07.297 --> 00:09:09.341 position:50% align:center
Uh, did I?

00:09:09.424 --> 00:09:12.635 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Mm... Uhh...

00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:15.221 position:50% align:center
I'm burdened! So very burdened!

00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:17.807 position:50% align:center
How can I possibly bear
such a heavy weight?

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:20.143 position:50% align:center
Yeah, very convincing.

00:09:21.478 --> 00:09:25.815 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I'll tell her someday.
I'm sure of it.

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:30.445 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
What should I do? I'm scared.

00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:32.906 position:50% align:center
I read the script to get
familiar with it and...

00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:35.075 position:50% align:center
...I have so many lines.

00:09:35.158 --> 00:09:37.452 position:50% align:center
I have to memorize
all of them somehow,

00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:40.538 position:50% align:center
but I don't think there's any
chance I can pull that off.

00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:41.873 position:50% align:center
A play?

00:09:41.956 --> 00:09:45.001 position:50% align:center
Ooh, what's it about?
Here, let me have a look.

Ah. It's <i>Cinderella</i> , huh?

00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:50.382 position:50% align:center
No way! Our Kyo is
playing the prince?

00:09:50.465 --> 00:09:52.759 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Oh, yes!

00:09:52.842 --> 00:09:55.095 position:50% align:center
You just gained
an audience member.

00:09:55.178 --> 00:09:57.972 position:50% align:center
I'll have to record it
for posterity, of course.

00:09:58.056 --> 00:09:58.890 position:50% align:center
Tohru...

00:09:58.973 --> 00:10:00.600 position:50% align:center
Um, yes?

[KYO]
What do you think you're doing?

00:10:02.227 --> 00:10:04.354 position:50% align:center
He didn't need to
know about that!

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:06.564 position:50% align:center
I can hear you! Gimme this!

00:10:06.648 --> 00:10:08.650 position:50% align:center
Come back! Please, I need that.

00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:12.529 position:50% align:center
How am I supposed to memorize my
lines if you steal the script?

00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:15.365 position:50% align:center
At least don't look
at it in the house.

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:20.036 position:50% align:center
Remember, don't breathe a
word about this to Master.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:20.912 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:22.288 position:50% align:center

[grunts]

00:10:27.752 --> 00:10:29.921 position:50% align:center
And you lose.

00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:33.675 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
No. I won't lose!

00:10:33.758 --> 00:10:36.886 position:50% align:center
I am a bully! The evil
stepsister will get her way!

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:39.514 position:50% align:center
I hate to tell ya this,
but I'm the bully here.

00:10:39.597 --> 00:10:41.433 position:50% align:center
Is this elementary school?

00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:42.517 position:50% align:center
Oh, Yuki.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.352 position:50% align:center
Sorry if I'm disturbing you,

00:10:44.436 --> 00:10:46.521 position:50% align:center
but can I at least get
past the entryway?

00:10:46.604 --> 00:10:49.107 position:50% align:center
How long were you standing
there watching us?

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:51.234 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I guess you'll never know.

00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:53.153 position:50% align:center
Well, anyway, welcome home.

00:10:53.236 --> 00:10:54.404 position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:56.865 position:50% align:center
Oh, is that the script?
They handed them out?

00:10:56.948 --> 00:10:59.034 position:50% align:center
Sure did. And I have yours, too.

00:10:59.117 --> 00:11:00.910 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Tohru!

00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:02.537 position:50% align:center
The pot is boiling over.

[TOHRU gasps]

00:11:03.455 --> 00:11:05.373 position:50% align:center
Sorry! I'll be right there!

[YUKI]
Kyo.

00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:07.292 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:09.502 position:50% align:center
Remember that hat?

00:11:09.586 --> 00:11:12.464 position:50% align:center
Thought you'd like to know
that Miss Honda has it now.

00:11:12.547 --> 00:11:14.883 position:50% align:center
I don't need to return it, do I?

00:11:17.427 --> 00:11:19.554 position:50% align:center
Come on, you two.

00:11:19.637 --> 00:11:22.640 position:50% align:center
Dinner's ready whenever you are.

00:11:22.724 --> 00:11:24.225 position:50% align:center
That sounds great.

00:11:24.309 --> 00:11:27.228 position:50% align:center
I'll go ahead and
eat now, thanks.

00:11:27.312 --> 00:11:29.731 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
I'll be down later.

00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:33.234 position:50% align:center
Guess I hit a nerve
by bringing that up.

00:11:33.318 --> 00:11:34.778 position:50% align:center
Um, what?

00:11:34.861 --> 00:11:38.323 position:50% align:center
Honestly, he had better hurry
and get his act together,

00:11:38.406 --> 00:11:40.325 position:50% align:center
or who knows what'll happen.

00:11:40.408 --> 00:11:42.369 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Uh...

00:11:42.452 --> 00:11:46.331 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] You're precious.
Someone I admire.

00:11:46.414 --> 00:11:47.665 position:50% align:center
I'll always cherish you

00:11:47.749 --> 00:11:52.796 position:50% align:center
for giving me what I'd so
desperately longed for.

00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:57.384 position:50% align:center
I care about your happiness
more than anyone else's.

00:11:57.467 --> 00:12:01.054 position:50% align:center
It's okay for you to find your
place in this world, too.

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:06.476 position:50% align:center
Somewhere you can be
yourself, unfiltered.

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:11.398 position:50% align:center
Where you can sulk.
Show your anger. Your pain.

00:12:11.481 --> 00:12:13.483 position:50% align:center
You'll find it.

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:17.737 position:50% align:center
And when you do,
I'll be able to tell you.

00:12:17.821 --> 00:12:22.158 position:50% align:center
I'll thank you for
everything you've done for me.

00:12:22.242 --> 00:12:26.037 position:50% align:center

Staging a play for
the culture festival--

00:12:30.125 --> 00:12:32.168 position:50% align:center
how wonderfully romantic!

00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:34.254 position:50% align:center
And naturally, I'm prepared
to help you make it

00:12:34.337 --> 00:12:36.214 position:50% align:center
a memorable performance
out of it.

00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:39.592 position:50% align:center
Just leave it to me, the costume
designer extraordinaire!

00:12:39.676 --> 00:12:41.970 position:50% align:center
I shall spare neither
effort nor expense.

00:12:42.053 --> 00:12:44.097 position:50% align:center
The players will shine
on the grand stage.

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.016 position:50% align:center
None more brightly
than you, of course!

00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:48.601 position:50% align:center
Now, how many costume
changes will you have?

00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:51.938 position:50% align:center
Try to keep in mind that
this is a school play.

00:12:53.314 --> 00:12:55.442 position:50% align:center
[KINOSHITA]
Cinderella, you stupid girl!

00:12:55.525 --> 00:12:58.319 position:50% align:center
Don't you know that the castle
ball is only a day away?

00:12:58.403 --> 00:13:00.071 position:50% align:center
Get my dress done at once!

00:13:00.155 --> 00:13:02.741 position:50% align:center
Honestly, you're such
a sloth. Isn't she?

00:13:02.824 --> 00:13:04.826 position:50% align:center
Well, say something!

00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:08.496 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Right. Um, y-you
had better get to work.

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:12.083 position:50% align:center
Because... if you don't
finish... then, um...

00:13:12.167 --> 00:13:17.881 position:50% align:center
...then... you'll go to
bed with no supper.

00:13:17.964 --> 00:13:19.632 position:50% align:center
Don't cry!

00:13:19.716 --> 00:13:23.261 position:50% align:center
Sister, it means so much
that you'd shed tears for me.

00:13:23.345 --> 00:13:26.431 position:50% align:center
You aren't supposed to hug!
What don't you understand?

00:13:26.514 --> 00:13:28.016 position:50% align:center
The "evil" part is right
there in your name...!

00:13:28.099 --> 00:13:30.185 position:50% align:center
Someone put a muzzle on her.

00:13:30.268 --> 00:13:31.311 position:50% align:center
So intense.

00:13:31.394 --> 00:13:33.271 position:50% align:center
You need to embrace the cruelty!

00:13:33.355 --> 00:13:35.190 position:50% align:center
Torment her till
all hope is lost!

00:13:35.273 --> 00:13:37.609 position:50% align:center

Impressive, Kinoshita.

What's wrong? Do you feel sick?

00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:51.623 position:50% align:center
Oh, sure. Why don't
we just go with that?

[CLASSMATE D]
Hmm...

00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:55.710 position:50% align:center
I'm starting to worry that
we've miscast the play.

00:13:55.794 --> 00:13:58.713 position:50% align:center
I'm doing a terrible job.
I'll ruin the whole thing.

Yes, and I'll keep trying.

I'll try and try
until I get it right.

Please don't give up on me yet.

00:14:07.472 --> 00:14:09.766 position:50% align:center
I'll go without supper

00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:12.435 position:50% align:center
[CLASSMATE D]
I don't think that's necessary.

00:14:12.519 --> 00:14:14.562 position:50% align:center

I have to do better than this.

00:14:14.646 --> 00:14:16.481 position:50% align:center
I need to help make
this a wonderful play

00:14:16.564 --> 00:14:19.776 position:50% align:center

use a facelift!

00:16:21.439 --> 00:16:23.566 position:50% align:center
If our cast doesn't
fit the story,

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:26.069 position:50% align:center
then I'll just make the
story fit our cast!

00:16:26.152 --> 00:16:28.571 position:50% align:center
Hold on, you can't
just change the story!

00:16:28.655 --> 00:16:30.281 position:50% align:center
Yeah, is that even allowed?

00:16:30.365 --> 00:16:33.618 position:50% align:center
It's fine! I mean, look at
the class doing <i>Mito Komon</i> .

00:16:33.702 --> 00:16:36.037 position:50% align:center
Their version turned two
of the main guys into women

00:16:36.121 --> 00:16:38.081 position:50% align:center
who beat the crap out
of their enemies!

00:16:38.164 --> 00:16:40.792 position:50% align:center
Not exactly authentic,
if you ask me.

00:16:40.875 --> 00:16:43.003 position:50% align:center
So it's like a Japanese
<i>Charlie's Angels</i> !

00:16:43.086 --> 00:16:44.462 position:50% align:center
Go "full throttle."

00:16:44.546 --> 00:16:46.965 position:50% align:center
Oh, man. So there's two more
girls in the bath scenes?

00:16:47.048 --> 00:16:48.425 position:50% align:center
What a genius move!

00:16:48.508 --> 00:16:49.884 position:50% align:center
This is high school.

00:16:49.968 --> 00:16:52.303 position:50% align:center
I don't think there's
going to be any bathing.

00:16:52.387 --> 00:16:53.930 position:50% align:center
That play sounds like
so much more fun

00:16:54.014 --> 00:16:55.682 position:50% align:center
than our stupid fairytale.

00:16:55.765 --> 00:16:58.143 position:50% align:center
[CLASSMATE D] When we're done,
<i>they'll</i> envy us.

00:16:58.226 --> 00:17:00.687 position:50% align:center
Now, it's rewrite time.
Let's do this!

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:02.564 position:50% align:center
Hold on.

00:17:02.647 --> 00:17:05.775 position:50% align:center
If you're really
rewriting it, I thought,

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:10.613 position:50% align:center
maybe you could change up the
prince's character a little bit.

00:17:10.697 --> 00:17:12.073 position:50% align:center
It's just...

00:17:12.157 --> 00:17:15.243 position:50% align:center
If the prince was different
somehow, less "princely,"

00:17:15.326 --> 00:17:17.537 position:50% align:center
it might be easier on Kyo.

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:20.373 position:50% align:center
And maybe he'd actually
show up to rehearsal.

00:17:20.457 --> 00:17:22.334 position:50% align:center
[CLASSMATE D]
Oh. Good point.

00:17:22.417 --> 00:17:25.670 position:50% align:center
[YUSUKE] Kyon-Kyon skipped
out on us again, huh?

00:17:25.754 --> 00:17:28.340 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI] Man, I wanted
to see his acting chops.

00:17:28.423 --> 00:17:30.508 position:50% align:center
[ALL] It would've been
absolutely hilarious.

00:17:30.592 --> 00:17:32.093 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I think we've
found one of the reasons

00:17:32.177 --> 00:17:33.845 position:50% align:center
he didn't come to rehearsal.

00:17:33.928 --> 00:17:36.431 position:50% align:center
I'm sure he's around. I'll go--

00:17:36.514 --> 00:17:40.226 position:50% align:center
I'm heading to student council.
I'll look for him on the way.

00:17:47.942 --> 00:17:49.277 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Disgusting.

00:17:49.361 --> 00:17:54.282 position:50% align:center
He's had his hands all over it.
It's not mine anymore.

00:17:54.366 --> 00:17:58.453 position:50% align:center
I don't want that thing.
Not if <i>he's</i> touched it.

00:17:58.536 --> 00:18:02.165 position:50% align:center
Who cares, anyway?
It's just a hat.

00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:05.377 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Look at you sulking.
Like a little kid.

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:09.923 position:50% align:center
Get to rehearsal.
They're waiting for you.

00:18:10.006 --> 00:18:11.383 position:50% align:center
I'm not sulking.

00:18:11.466 --> 00:18:14.761 position:50% align:center
I never asked anyone to make
me part of that dumb play.

00:18:14.844 --> 00:18:16.638 position:50% align:center
And seeing you there
would only piss me off,

00:18:16.721 --> 00:18:18.765 position:50% align:center
so why should I bother?

00:18:18.848 --> 00:18:22.435 position:50% align:center
If you have a problem, be a big
boy and take it up with me.

00:18:22.519 --> 00:18:25.313 position:50% align:center
You're making it hard on them,
including Miss Honda.

00:18:25.397 --> 00:18:26.898 position:50% align:center
Do you like it when
she worries about you?

00:18:26.981 --> 00:18:28.858 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Don't say a damn word about her!

00:18:28.942 --> 00:18:31.277 position:50% align:center
You know nothing.

00:18:31.361 --> 00:18:35.073 position:50% align:center
What the hell gives you the
right to treat me like a child?

00:18:35.156 --> 00:18:36.908 position:50% align:center
You've got two parents.

00:18:36.991 --> 00:18:40.078 position:50% align:center
Everyone thinks you're
so special, so important.

00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:44.290 position:50% align:center
I struggle to keep my head above
water and you just sail by.

00:18:44.374 --> 00:18:47.377 position:50% align:center
How could you understand
anything about me?

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:50.171 position:50% align:center
You're the prince who's always
gotten what he wanted.

00:18:50.255 --> 00:18:53.633 position:50% align:center
You'll never know what it's like
to be on the other side of that!

00:18:53.717 --> 00:18:55.802 position:50% align:center
To be the idiot desperately
wanting something

00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:57.345 position:50% align:center
he can never have!

00:18:57.429 --> 00:18:58.722 position:50% align:center
You--

00:19:01.391 --> 00:19:04.519 position:50% align:center
[KYOKO] That's what you
wanna see, right?

00:19:04.602 --> 00:19:07.772 position:50% align:center
Because if he's not
as awful as you think...

00:19:07.856 --> 00:19:09.774 position:50% align:center
...then you wouldn't
have anyone to hate.

00:19:09.858 --> 00:19:11.109 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:18.908 --> 00:19:20.702 position:50% align:center
Go to hell.

00:19:28.043 --> 00:19:30.670 position:50% align:center
Uh. Senpai.

00:19:30.754 --> 00:19:32.547 position:50% align:center
Soma- <i>senpai</i> ,
what are you doing

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:34.716 position:50% align:center
just standing on the stairs?

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:38.845 position:50% align:center
Uh! Whoa, the window's broken.
What happened?

00:19:38.928 --> 00:19:41.389 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's nothing.
Don't worry about it.

00:19:41.473 --> 00:19:44.267 position:50% align:center
Can I help with anything?
You two look busy.

00:19:44.351 --> 00:19:46.019 position:50% align:center
No, we're good.

00:19:46.102 --> 00:19:47.270 position:50% align:center
No, thank you.

00:19:47.354 --> 00:19:49.105 position:50% align:center
Festival prep?

00:19:49.189 --> 00:19:52.150 position:50% align:center
What was your class
doing again? A bazar?

00:19:52.233 --> 00:19:53.818 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGISHI]
Yes, that's right!

00:19:53.902 --> 00:19:56.196 position:50% align:center
And your class is
doing <i>Cinderella</i> .

00:19:56.279 --> 00:19:58.198 position:50% align:center
I can't wait to see it!

00:19:58.281 --> 00:19:59.741 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Thanks.

00:19:59.824 --> 00:20:01.326 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGISHI] I don't know what
they were thinking, though,

00:20:01.409 --> 00:20:04.120 position:50% align:center
having someone besides
you play the prince.

00:20:04.204 --> 00:20:06.790 position:50% align:center
I mean, we all know there's
nobody in the whole school

00:20:06.873 --> 00:20:08.708 position:50% align:center
who's more prince-like than you!

00:20:08.792 --> 00:20:11.836 position:50% align:center
Right? Back me up, Kuragi.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.255 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
No.

00:20:14.339 --> 00:20:17.592 position:50% align:center
I don't think the president
is prince-like at all.

00:20:22.097 --> 00:20:25.392 position:50% align:center
Hey! Kuragi!

00:20:25.475 --> 00:20:26.976 position:50% align:center
Jeez.

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:29.312 position:50% align:center
I don't know what her problem
is, but it's getting real old.

00:20:29.396 --> 00:20:31.773 position:50% align:center
It's like she thinks she's
better than everyone else.

00:20:31.856 --> 00:20:34.359 position:50% align:center
Except really,
she's a total freak.

00:20:34.442 --> 00:20:37.362 position:50% align:center
Maybe she figures being weird
will get her more attention.

00:20:37.445 --> 00:20:41.116 position:50% align:center
I guess it's true, but it
doesn't seem very smart.

00:20:45.328 --> 00:20:47.914 position:50% align:center
Hey, Kyo! There you are.

00:20:47.997 --> 00:20:49.457 position:50% align:center
I was worried when
Yuki didn't come back

00:20:49.541 --> 00:20:52.210 position:50% align:center
after he went looking for you.

00:20:52.293 --> 00:20:55.588 position:50% align:center
So you've just been
sitting here alone?

00:20:55.672 --> 00:20:56.840 position:50% align:center
Where's everyone else?

00:20:56.923 --> 00:20:58.258 position:50% align:center
They all went home.

00:20:58.341 --> 00:21:01.428 position:50% align:center
We finished up
rehearsing for the day.

00:21:01.511 --> 00:21:02.512 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
You were waiting for me?

00:21:02.595 --> 00:21:04.931 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. I wanted
to give you this.

00:21:05.015 --> 00:21:08.268 position:50% align:center
It's your brand-new script!
Totally rewritten.

00:21:08.351 --> 00:21:10.437 position:50% align:center
Pretty amazing, right?

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:13.690 position:50% align:center
You should read it.
She made a ton of great changes.

00:21:13.773 --> 00:21:15.025 position:50% align:center
I don't think you'll
mind playing

00:21:15.108 --> 00:21:18.111 position:50% align:center
this version of the prince
as much as the other.

00:21:18.194 --> 00:21:20.530 position:50% align:center
I was super relieved that
she rewrote my character

00:21:20.613 --> 00:21:22.699 position:50% align:center
to make it easier for me, too.

00:21:22.782 --> 00:21:25.368 position:50% align:center
Oh, but for me it was
because of my terrible acting.

00:21:25.452 --> 00:21:28.580 position:50% align:center
I'm sure it had nothing to
do with that in your case.

00:21:28.663 --> 00:21:30.707 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
You waited.

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:34.711 position:50% align:center
What were you thinking about
while you sat there all alone?

00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:37.464 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Look at you sulking.

00:21:37.547 --> 00:21:40.300 position:50% align:center
Do you like it when
she worries about you?

00:21:41.634 --> 00:21:43.219 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Oh, I almost forgot!

00:21:43.303 --> 00:21:46.264 position:50% align:center
There was another
really big change.

00:21:46.348 --> 00:21:48.558 position:50% align:center
Your hand! What hap--?

00:21:51.644 --> 00:21:54.230 position:50% align:center
You're hurt. Are you...?

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:06.576 position:50% align:center
Fine, you win. I'll be
in the stupid play.

00:22:08.703 --> 00:22:12.749 position:50% align:center
No laughing. Or you'll
find a new prince.

00:22:12.832 --> 00:22:17.295 position:50% align:center
All right, let's
go home. Come on.

00:22:20.924 --> 00:22:22.550 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Okay.

00:23:57.187 --> 00:23:59.189 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
"It's <i>Cinderella</i> -ish"!
