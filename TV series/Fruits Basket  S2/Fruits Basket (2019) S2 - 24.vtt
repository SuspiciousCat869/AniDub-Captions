00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:14.931 position:50% align:center
Any color requests?
Spit 'em out you guys.

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.182 position:50% align:center
[KIMI]
Are you kidding?

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:18.643 position:50% align:center
Come on, guys, how is
this even a question?

00:00:18.727 --> 00:00:20.603 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Which of the colors
would you choose, Kuragi?

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:21.688 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:23.690 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
The question sent me reeling.

00:00:23.773 --> 00:00:26.026 position:50% align:center
I couldn't wrap
my mind around it.

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:28.611 position:50% align:center
Couldn't make sense
of what he'd asked me.

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:32.240 position:50% align:center
Who he was. Or who I was.

00:00:35.243 --> 00:00:39.039 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
I'm nothing. An empty shell.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.463 position:50% align:center
[YUKI sighs]

00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:12.090 position:50% align:center
That's it. Done.

00:02:12.173 --> 00:02:13.883 position:50% align:center
The last major event
of the school year

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:15.260 position:50% align:center
is finally behind us.

00:02:15.343 --> 00:02:16.177 position:50% align:center
Nice work.

00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:18.304 position:50% align:center
Same to you, Yun-Yun!

00:02:18.388 --> 00:02:19.681 position:50% align:center
That doesn't mean
we can slack off

00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:21.224 position:50% align:center
on our regular duties, though.

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:23.518 position:50% align:center
Don't be such a
buzzkill, shortstack.

00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:26.521 position:50% align:center
[NAOHITO] I bet you haven't
even started on yours!

00:02:26.604 --> 00:02:27.564 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
What're you talkin' about?

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:29.899 position:50% align:center
[KIMI]
Ooh, ooh, ooh! Listen, guys.

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:32.777 position:50% align:center
Kimi thinks we should celebrate
all of our hard work.

00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:35.655 position:50% align:center
So why don't we have a
little party tomorrow?

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:36.823 position:50% align:center
[NAOHITO]
A party?

00:02:36.906 --> 00:02:38.450 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you know that
new restaurant?

00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:40.660 position:50% align:center
The fancy one that
opened up close to here?

00:02:40.744 --> 00:02:42.203 position:50% align:center
They've got good lunch deals,

00:02:42.287 --> 00:02:45.457 position:50% align:center
and tomorrow's perfect since
it's the start of winter break.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.876 position:50% align:center
Kimi's sure you've been
wanting to take her there.

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.045 position:50% align:center
You have been, haven't you?

00:02:50.128 --> 00:02:51.379 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I mean, um...

00:02:51.463 --> 00:02:53.256 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Enough with the shy act.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.342 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] It could double
as our year-end party.

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:57.177 position:50% align:center
I like the idea.

00:02:58.136 --> 00:03:00.972 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec. Machi?

00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:03.975 position:50% align:center
What do you say?
Will we see you tomorrow?

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:06.853 position:50% align:center
No, it's okay! You don't
have to be there, Machi.

00:03:06.936 --> 00:03:09.189 position:50% align:center
Or you other boys,
for that matter.

00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:10.398 position:50% align:center
Right, Yun-Yun?

00:03:10.482 --> 00:03:11.775 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Hey, what?

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:13.943 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] That's less of a party
and more of a date.

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:15.820 position:50% align:center
I think I'll pass. But thanks.

00:03:15.904 --> 00:03:18.823 position:50% align:center
Uh. Do you already
have plans tomorrow?

00:03:18.907 --> 00:03:19.699 position:50% align:center
No.

00:03:19.783 --> 00:03:22.702 position:50% align:center
Uh. Then is it the restaurant?

00:03:22.786 --> 00:03:24.996 position:50% align:center
Well, would you rather
go somewhere else?

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.331 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:26.414 --> 00:03:29.584 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
This again. More questions.

00:03:29.668 --> 00:03:32.504 position:50% align:center
Ones I don't know
the answers to.

00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:36.508 position:50% align:center
Of course, he probably doesn't
remember the other time.

00:03:36.591 --> 00:03:39.678 position:50% align:center
[MACHI] Just stop. You don't
need to worry about me, okay?

00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:42.931 position:50% align:center
And besides, I don't really
think my personal preferences

00:03:43.014 --> 00:03:45.308 position:50% align:center
are any of your business.

00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:49.354 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Yeah, I guess you're right.

00:03:49.437 --> 00:03:52.107 position:50% align:center
But I thought it might help

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.441 position:50% align:center
if I could see how
the world looks

00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:55.902 position:50% align:center
through your eyes, you know?

00:03:57.153 --> 00:03:59.197 position:50% align:center
Idiotic airhead alert!

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.032 position:50% align:center
Quit shouting!
And where'd that come from?

00:04:01.116 --> 00:04:04.494 position:50% align:center
[MANABE] You're freaking me out!
You and your airheaded ways!

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:07.080 position:50% align:center
Come on. Normal people
don't talk like that.

00:04:07.163 --> 00:04:09.290 position:50% align:center
I'm two seconds from
punching you! Loudmouth!

00:04:09.374 --> 00:04:11.793 position:50% align:center
So oblivious and so violent!

00:04:11.876 --> 00:04:13.336 position:50% align:center
--[phones beeping]
--[NAOHITO, YUKI gasps]

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.296 position:50% align:center
Good to go! Check your phones.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.633 position:50% align:center
Kimi texted the when
and where for tomorrow.

00:04:18.717 --> 00:04:22.012 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Machi, you don't have
a cell phone, do you?

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:25.098 position:50% align:center
I wrote it all down. Here.

00:04:27.183 --> 00:04:28.184 position:50% align:center
[KIMI]
Kimi and Yun-Yun, sitting...

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:29.477 position:50% align:center
This restaurant
we're meeting up at

00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:31.563 position:50% align:center
isn't going to be
too crowded, is it?

00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:33.648 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Huh? No, why?

00:04:33.732 --> 00:04:36.776 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's right, I almost
forgot you were a princess.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.696 position:50% align:center
Large crowds probably offends
your delicate sensibilities.

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:41.322 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:42.866 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that must be it.

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.118 position:50% align:center
Sometimes I think I might be
too well-bred for my own good.

00:04:45.201 --> 00:04:46.745 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised they let
you outta the house

00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:48.621 position:50% align:center
without someone there
to protect your virtue.

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:50.957 position:50% align:center
Stop messing around
and go home already!

00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:53.835 position:50% align:center
Okay. Let's head out, Yuki.

00:04:53.918 --> 00:04:55.295 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:04:55.378 --> 00:04:57.630 position:50% align:center
We're off. Bye.

00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:01.176 position:50% align:center
Know where we should
have our next shindig?

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:03.345 position:50% align:center
There's this place that
makes great croquettes.

00:05:03.428 --> 00:05:04.054 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Oh, yeah?

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:05.305 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
The best!

00:05:05.388 --> 00:05:10.393 position:50% align:center
[phone ringing]

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:18.401 position:50% align:center
Hello?

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:21.738 position:50% align:center
[MACHI'S MOTHER] Machi, you're
home late. Out having fun?

00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:23.281 position:50% align:center
Student council.

00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:27.035 position:50% align:center
[MACHI'S MOTHER] Oh, right,
I forgot you had that this year.

00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:29.746 position:50% align:center
So how's everything? The same?

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:31.873 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
Yes. All the same.

00:05:31.956 --> 00:05:33.375 position:50% align:center
[MACHI'S MOTHER]
Have you made any friends?

00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:36.795 position:50% align:center
How's Kakeru?
You two getting along?

00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:38.421 position:50% align:center
[MACHI'S MOTHER]
Don't let him show you up!

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:40.882 position:50% align:center
Get perfect scores
on everything!

00:05:40.965 --> 00:05:41.966 position:50% align:center
What a dull girl.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.551 position:50% align:center
Just stay away!

00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:46.680 position:50% align:center
You make it seem
like I'm to blame.

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:49.474 position:50% align:center
[MACHI'S MOTHER]
Machi? Machi?

00:05:49.557 --> 00:05:52.560 position:50% align:center
The silent treatment again?

00:05:52.644 --> 00:05:55.146 position:50% align:center
I never know what's going
through your head.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.981 position:50% align:center
You haven't changed at all.

00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:58.942 position:50% align:center
Maybe if you weren't so dull,

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:00.735 position:50% align:center
you'd actually have
some friends.

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:01.945 position:50% align:center
[MACHI'S BROTHER]
Mom!

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:04.155 position:50% align:center
[MACHI'S MOTHER]
Yes, I'm coming, sweetie!

00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:07.033 position:50% align:center
Fine. I'll talk to you later.

00:06:12.414 --> 00:06:14.749 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
She's not wrong.

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:18.962 position:50% align:center
If there's one thing I do know,
it's that I am dull.

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:20.338 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
I don't have a favorite color,

00:06:20.422 --> 00:06:23.466 position:50% align:center
a favorite food,
a favorite place to go.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.885 position:50% align:center
I've never even
thought about it.

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:30.557 position:50% align:center
I struggled so long to meet
every demand she made...

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.643 position:50% align:center
...only to be abandoned
in the end.

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:38.648 position:50% align:center
All that was left... was this
empty shell of a person.

00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:42.736 position:50% align:center
This dull girl.

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:47.407 position:50% align:center
And in all this time,
I haven't changed.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.285 position:50% align:center
But... he has.

00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:53.955 position:50% align:center
I've watched him change.
Little by little.

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:56.041 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT A]
Look! That's him, over there.

00:06:56.124 --> 00:06:59.794 position:50% align:center
It's <i>the</i> Yuki Soma.
He's the one in the middle.

00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:01.296 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT B]
He's so beautiful!

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:03.631 position:50% align:center
I can see why they
call him a prince!

00:07:03.715 --> 00:07:04.841 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT A]
Think he'd date me?

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:06.259 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT B]
In your dreams.

00:07:06.343 --> 00:07:08.595 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT C] A prince like
him could pick any girl.

00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:11.556 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT A] I bet he's never
been lonely in his life.

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:15.935 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
But... he looked lonely to me.

00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:17.687 position:50% align:center
It seemed to gnaw at him.

00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:22.692 position:50% align:center
Getting worse every time someone
treated him like he was special.

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:25.028 position:50% align:center
Now, though,
his smiles seem real,

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:27.781 position:50% align:center
instead of the hollow
things they used to be.

00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:32.077 position:50% align:center
He's growing. Changing.
I'm sure of it.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.245 position:50% align:center
[MACHI'S MOTHER]
You haven't changed at all.

00:07:39.918 --> 00:07:42.003 position:50% align:center
Morning.

00:07:42.087 --> 00:07:47.217 position:50% align:center
Now what? Do I really have
to go to this party?

00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:51.221 position:50% align:center
My eyes...

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:59.104 position:50% align:center
[MACHI] What the world
looks like through my eyes.

00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:01.815 position:50% align:center
He says the strangest things.

00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:05.610 position:50% align:center
"The world"?
What does that even mean?

00:08:05.694 --> 00:08:08.071 position:50% align:center
I don't understand myself.

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:11.783 position:50% align:center
How could I hope to
understand the world?

00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:14.327 position:50% align:center
I've never felt
like a real person.

00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:18.039 position:50% align:center
Just a void that other
people try to fill.

00:08:18.123 --> 00:08:20.542 position:50% align:center
I'm nothing.

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:25.505 position:50% align:center
Or maybe I'm like a doll with
some of its parts missing.

00:08:25.588 --> 00:08:28.758 position:50% align:center
A broken imitation
of a real girl.

00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:31.469 position:50% align:center
Defective merchandise.

00:08:31.553 --> 00:08:34.139 position:50% align:center
People pass by me
without looking,

00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:37.684 position:50% align:center
and I don't look
at them, either.

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:43.606 position:50% align:center
Are they invisible?
Or am I invisible?

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:48.945 position:50% align:center
Is it my fault for not
engaging? Not connecting?

00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:51.781 position:50% align:center
Is there anyone who
actually needs me?

00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:54.701 position:50% align:center
Any reason for my existence?

00:08:56.494 --> 00:09:01.583 position:50% align:center
[MACHI] If I were gone,
would anybody notice?

00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:04.044 position:50% align:center
Machi.

00:09:04.127 --> 00:09:08.506 position:50% align:center
Oh, good. I thought I was
early, but... here you are.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:09.841 position:50% align:center
Perfect timing.

00:09:09.924 --> 00:09:11.384 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:14.429 position:50% align:center
Uh! Machi!

00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:17.515 position:50% align:center
What happened?
Are you all right?

00:09:17.599 --> 00:09:18.808 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
I'm fine.

00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:21.186 position:50% align:center
Here. All your stuff
spilled out. Let me help.

00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:22.645 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:24.689 position:50% align:center
A bottle opener?

00:09:24.773 --> 00:09:26.983 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
Yes. So what?

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:29.152 position:50% align:center
I was half-asleep when
I packed this morning.

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:30.653 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but still.

00:09:30.737 --> 00:09:33.448 position:50% align:center
[MACHI] I-I don't need your help
with this. I can do it.

00:09:33.531 --> 00:09:34.949 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Machi,

00:09:35.033 --> 00:09:36.868 position:50% align:center
is this the maple leaf I gave
you after the class trip?

00:09:36.951 --> 00:09:38.661 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Give that back!

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:41.331 position:50% align:center
Uh. I'm sorry.
Is it a different leaf?

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:42.916 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
Yes, it's different.

00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:47.337 position:50% align:center
All right. My mistake.
I guess it couldn't be.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:50.298 position:50% align:center
It could be the same. Maybe.

00:09:50.382 --> 00:09:52.008 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Okay...

00:09:52.092 --> 00:09:54.094 position:50% align:center
[MACHI] I didn't keep it
for any special reason.

00:09:54.177 --> 00:09:57.597 position:50% align:center
I just thought it'd be
a waste to throw it away,

00:09:57.681 --> 00:10:00.684 position:50% align:center
so I made a bookmark.

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:04.604 position:50% align:center
That's all. I mean it.

00:10:04.688 --> 00:10:06.606 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:07.732 position:50% align:center
For what?

00:10:07.816 --> 00:10:11.486 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Uh. It seems important to you.

00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:13.279 position:50% align:center
I'm glad.

00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:18.034 position:50% align:center
It is not important to me!

00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:18.952 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Uh.

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:20.704 position:50% align:center
But you made it a bookmark.

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:22.831 position:50% align:center
Yeah. And I stuff
it inside my book!

00:10:22.914 --> 00:10:24.541 position:50% align:center
That doesn't mean
I like the thing.

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:26.501 position:50% align:center
Well, you must like it
at least a little.

00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:30.463 position:50% align:center
I could care less about it! It's
big and clunky! Take it back!

00:10:30.547 --> 00:10:32.048 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I don't want it back!

00:10:32.132 --> 00:10:34.634 position:50% align:center
[MANABE] Should I or should I
not ask what's happening here?

00:10:34.718 --> 00:10:37.345 position:50% align:center
Go on. Really. Just ask away.

00:10:37.429 --> 00:10:38.722 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
What's happening?

00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:40.974 position:50% align:center
What's happening is that
Machi's being impossible.

00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:42.892 position:50% align:center
Need more info. What else?

00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:44.561 position:50% align:center
This has nothing to do with you!

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:45.937 position:50% align:center
Hey, hold on.

00:10:46.021 --> 00:10:48.231 position:50% align:center
Isn't that the leaf Yun-Yun
gave you as a souvenir?

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:49.482 position:50% align:center
It isn't!

00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:50.358 position:50% align:center
It could be!

00:10:50.442 --> 00:10:51.609 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Okay.

00:10:51.693 --> 00:10:54.904 position:50% align:center
So... I guess you must
really like leaves, huh?

00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:55.864 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
I don't know!

00:10:55.947 --> 00:10:59.784 position:50% align:center
Oh, I get it. The color.

00:10:59.868 --> 00:11:01.161 position:50% align:center
You like red.

00:11:01.244 --> 00:11:04.122 position:50% align:center
Hey, good call. Red, huh?

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:06.207 position:50% align:center
Look at that ribbon.
It's red, too.

00:11:06.291 --> 00:11:07.417 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Right?

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:11.504 position:50% align:center
Well, it took a while,
but I got my answer.

00:11:12.589 --> 00:11:14.716 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
He does remember.

00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:16.051 position:50% align:center
[KIMI gasps]

00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:19.262 position:50% align:center
Omigosh, Machi, why're you
in your school uniform?

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:21.097 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
'Bout time you got here.

00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:23.475 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
He's so weird.

00:11:23.558 --> 00:11:25.060 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Guess what, you guys.

00:11:25.143 --> 00:11:28.938 position:50% align:center
It turns out our
Machi likes red.

00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:31.274 position:50% align:center
[NAOHITO] Kuragi.
Don't make a scene in public.

00:11:31.358 --> 00:11:33.443 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Red, red, red.

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:35.695 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
I don't understand him.

00:11:37.197 --> 00:11:39.199 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] I know that I've
got a lot of faults,

00:11:39.282 --> 00:11:41.826 position:50% align:center
so thank you for
agreeing to have me.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:44.371 position:50% align:center
No, please. Don't say that.

00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:47.374 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you were willing to
come despite all my own faults.

00:11:47.457 --> 00:11:49.125 position:50% align:center
I'm the one who should
be thanking you.

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:51.044 position:50% align:center
No! You really
shouldn't, please!

00:11:51.127 --> 00:11:54.005 position:50% align:center
This is more of an honor than
I could ever possibly deserve!

00:11:54.089 --> 00:11:55.507 position:50% align:center
What the heck?

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:57.467 position:50% align:center
It sounds like you came here
to be his wife or something.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.303 position:50% align:center
Ah! That isn't it
at all, I swear!

00:12:00.387 --> 00:12:02.514 position:50% align:center
Having us over for New
Year's is a big deal,

00:12:02.597 --> 00:12:04.140 position:50% align:center
so I wanted to
thank him properly.

00:12:04.224 --> 00:12:05.934 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Calm down. I know. I was joking.

00:12:06.017 --> 00:12:09.062 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] And Master already has
his lovely Hana- <i>chan</i> already.

00:12:09.145 --> 00:12:10.188 position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:11.981 position:50% align:center
Stop it! Don't go
making assumptions.

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:15.694 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] Now then, let me
to show you to your room.

00:12:15.777 --> 00:12:17.404 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
It's almost the new year.

00:12:17.487 --> 00:12:21.408 position:50% align:center
This time, I'll be staying
at Master's for the holiday.

00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:25.203 position:50% align:center
It all started with something
surprising that Yuki said.

00:12:25.286 --> 00:12:26.454 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Kyo!

00:12:26.538 --> 00:12:27.747 position:50% align:center
Hey, look at this!

00:12:27.831 --> 00:12:28.957 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Hm?

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.126 position:50% align:center
What do you think of
this new scarf I bought?

00:12:31.209 --> 00:12:33.670 position:50% align:center
It even has pom poms!

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:35.255 position:50% align:center
You're gonna hit someone
with those things

00:12:35.338 --> 00:12:37.090 position:50% align:center
when you turn around.

00:12:38.341 --> 00:12:39.634 position:50% align:center
Like that.

00:12:39.718 --> 00:12:42.303 position:50% align:center
So, anyway,
let's talk New Year's.

00:12:42.387 --> 00:12:44.514 position:50% align:center
Have you boys decided
what you're doing yet?

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:47.517 position:50% align:center
Actually, I think I'll
go to the estate.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.351 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU gasps]

00:12:48.435 --> 00:12:49.561 position:50% align:center
Now there's a shock.

00:12:49.644 --> 00:12:51.479 position:50% align:center
Just for one night, though.

00:12:51.563 --> 00:12:53.982 position:50% align:center
I'll be back by evening
on New Year's Day.

00:12:54.065 --> 00:12:56.443 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] Seriously, did you
hit your head on something?

00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:58.653 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
No, I didn't.

00:12:58.737 --> 00:13:00.155 position:50% align:center
It's what I need to do.

00:13:00.238 --> 00:13:01.197 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:02.615 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:13:02.699 --> 00:13:05.201 position:50% align:center
All right. Why cut it
so short, though?

00:13:05.285 --> 00:13:07.662 position:50% align:center
If you're already going,
you could stay a little longer.

00:13:07.746 --> 00:13:09.205 position:50% align:center
I could.

00:13:09.289 --> 00:13:12.500 position:50% align:center
Except that, I'm not sure about
leaving him alone with her.

00:13:12.584 --> 00:13:13.418 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:15.003 position:50% align:center
Kyo, you devil!

00:13:15.086 --> 00:13:15.962 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
I'll kill you.

00:13:16.046 --> 00:13:17.380 position:50% align:center
Back, foul beast!

00:13:17.464 --> 00:13:19.132 position:50% align:center
There's no need to be
frightened, Tohru.

00:13:19.215 --> 00:13:21.259 position:50% align:center
I won't let him have you!

00:13:21.343 --> 00:13:22.677 position:50% align:center
Animal.

00:13:22.761 --> 00:13:26.014 position:50% align:center
One of these days I'm seriously
going to kill you both.

00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:28.725 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Oh, and you should know,

00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:32.437 position:50% align:center
I've actually got another
visitor besides the two of you.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.356 position:50% align:center
Who is it?

00:13:34.439 --> 00:13:36.524 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Here she is.

00:13:36.608 --> 00:13:38.026 position:50% align:center
Wanna say hi?

00:13:38.109 --> 00:13:39.277 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:39.361 --> 00:13:40.362 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU squeals]

00:13:40.445 --> 00:13:41.988 position:50% align:center
It's you!

00:13:42.072 --> 00:13:45.075 position:50% align:center
Hey! You shouldn't just
barge in like that, idiot!

00:13:45.158 --> 00:13:47.911 position:50% align:center
Right, I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking.

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:51.289 position:50% align:center
Nobody warned me that you were
coming. That's not okay.

00:13:51.373 --> 00:13:54.250 position:50% align:center
No! Isuzu! Come back!

00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:58.004 position:50% align:center
Tohru, you can't just throw
yourself at people like that.

00:13:58.088 --> 00:14:00.256 position:50% align:center
No stare-down with Isuzu today?

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.592 position:50% align:center
Stare-down? What d'you mean?

00:14:02.676 --> 00:14:04.135 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] You two used
to glare at each other

00:14:04.219 --> 00:14:06.012 position:50% align:center
for ten minutes solid.

00:14:06.096 --> 00:14:08.056 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
That was back when we were kids.

00:14:08.139 --> 00:14:11.351 position:50% align:center
Oh. I didn't know you and
Isuzu were on bad terms.

00:14:11.434 --> 00:14:14.187 position:50% align:center
Well, I wouldn't say
they're on bad terms, really.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:16.022 position:50% align:center
They're just not on good terms.

00:14:16.106 --> 00:14:19.901 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see. Uh. Huh?

00:14:19.984 --> 00:14:21.236 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised.

00:14:21.319 --> 00:14:23.822 position:50% align:center
I went to visit her at the
hospital the other day.

00:14:23.905 --> 00:14:26.116 position:50% align:center
She didn't mention anything
about being released,

00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:27.158 position:50% align:center
but I guess...

00:14:27.242 --> 00:14:30.078 position:50% align:center
Yes. It's a
conditional discharge.

00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:31.496 position:50% align:center
She's out,

00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:33.707 position:50% align:center
but she didn't have any interest
in attending the banquet

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:35.542 position:50% align:center
and wasn't sure
where else to go,

00:14:35.625 --> 00:14:37.961 position:50% align:center
so I asked her to stay here.

00:14:38.044 --> 00:14:40.839 position:50% align:center
I'd like to keep her away
from stressful situations.

00:14:40.922 --> 00:14:43.800 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, we risk
undoing her progress.

00:14:43.883 --> 00:14:45.552 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're right.

00:14:45.635 --> 00:14:50.640 position:50% align:center
[KYO] It's probably already
started--the banquet.

00:14:50.724 --> 00:14:53.476 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] New Year's with
the zodiac spirits.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:56.521 position:50% align:center
I wonder what Yuki and the
others are thinking right now,

00:14:56.604 --> 00:14:58.732 position:50% align:center
and if they're having fun.

00:15:00.108 --> 00:15:00.942 position:50% align:center
Wonderful!

00:15:01.026 --> 00:15:03.403 position:50% align:center
It really was! You were great!

00:15:03.486 --> 00:15:05.196 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
A spectacular dance!

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.782 position:50% align:center
The juxtaposition of Momiji's
innocent fragility

00:15:07.866 --> 00:15:11.119 position:50% align:center
and your rough strength resulted
in something exquisite.

00:15:11.202 --> 00:15:14.330 position:50% align:center
I can only think of one way
to express the depth of my awe.

00:15:14.414 --> 00:15:15.540 position:50% align:center
Embrace me!

00:15:15.623 --> 00:15:17.083 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes!

00:15:17.167 --> 00:15:18.752 position:50% align:center
That might be the only thing
that could make me feel worse

00:15:18.835 --> 00:15:20.211 position:50% align:center
than I already do.

00:15:20.295 --> 00:15:22.380 position:50% align:center
That was quite a
performance, Doc.

00:15:22.464 --> 00:15:23.631 position:50% align:center
Aren't you glad it's over?

00:15:23.715 --> 00:15:25.717 position:50% align:center
I know how much you
were dreading it.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.469 position:50% align:center
You're still up again
next year, though.

00:15:27.552 --> 00:15:28.678 position:50% align:center
Shut up.

00:15:28.762 --> 00:15:31.264 position:50% align:center
That's right. And I'll
be your counterpart.

00:15:31.348 --> 00:15:33.433 position:50% align:center
Together, we'll make
something beautiful!

00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:35.977 position:50% align:center
Stop spouting nonsense
and get back in there.

00:15:36.061 --> 00:15:38.897 position:50% align:center
Indeed! I'm sure my
presence has been missed.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:42.067 position:50% align:center
You know, I really wish
you'd've kept the robe on.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:43.360 position:50% align:center
[HATORI]
Hm?

00:15:43.443 --> 00:15:45.362 position:50% align:center
I wanted to get a picture
of you in that outfit.

00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:48.073 position:50% align:center
It'll be the perfect
photo to send to Mayu.

00:15:48.156 --> 00:15:53.036 position:50% align:center
Absurd. You won't sway her
with something like-- Uh.

00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:55.789 position:50% align:center
You aren't... back together?

00:15:55.872 --> 00:16:00.126 position:50% align:center
Nope. We're not.
No need to worry.

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:01.753 position:50% align:center
Go bother someone else.

00:16:01.836 --> 00:16:04.756 position:50% align:center
Akito will be missing you
if you don't get back soon.

00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:06.758 position:50% align:center
What, is that sarcasm?

00:16:06.841 --> 00:16:09.719 position:50% align:center
Kureno sitting on one side
and Yuki on the other.

00:16:09.803 --> 00:16:11.346 position:50% align:center
No, I won't be missed.

00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:14.057 position:50% align:center
Yuki might be having
a tough time.

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:17.477 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I think
you worry too much.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:20.939 position:50% align:center
Ah. I know what this is.

00:16:21.022 --> 00:16:22.524 position:50% align:center
It's the guilt.

00:16:22.607 --> 00:16:23.817 position:50% align:center
You feel like you owe Yuki,

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.736 position:50% align:center
so you make a point
of looking out for him.

00:16:27.904 --> 00:16:29.614 position:50% align:center
[HATORI] Don't worry,
I don't feel any such need

00:16:29.698 --> 00:16:30.782 position:50% align:center
when it comes to you.

00:16:30.865 --> 00:16:33.952 position:50% align:center
Whew, that's good!
Wait! You don't? Really?

00:16:34.035 --> 00:16:36.955 position:50% align:center
A triumph! Tori's
performance was inspired.

00:16:37.038 --> 00:16:38.331 position:50% align:center
I can't wait to see
the two of you...

00:16:38.415 --> 00:16:41.543 position:50% align:center
[AKITO] So, Yuki,
you didn't run this time.

00:16:41.626 --> 00:16:42.836 position:50% align:center
That's good.

00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:46.089 position:50% align:center
I'm very happy you've
come back to me.

00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:50.260 position:50% align:center
So happy I've decided
I'm going to forgive you.

00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:54.347 position:50% align:center
But I want you to visit
more often from now on.

00:16:54.431 --> 00:16:58.393 position:50% align:center
Akito, I've been thinking and...

00:16:59.644 --> 00:17:02.647 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I guess... I forgive you, too.

00:17:02.731 --> 00:17:04.941 position:50% align:center
Maybe that's the wrong word.

00:17:05.025 --> 00:17:10.572 position:50% align:center
But... I'm sick of blaming
others. So I'm done.

00:17:11.656 --> 00:17:15.702 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Akito, my mom, even Kyo.

00:17:15.785 --> 00:17:21.332 position:50% align:center
When things go wrong,
I blame everyone except myself.

00:17:21.416 --> 00:17:24.794 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I have flaws, weaknesses.

00:17:24.878 --> 00:17:26.338 position:50% align:center
I need to accept that they exist

00:17:26.421 --> 00:17:30.967 position:50% align:center
and recognize them for what they
are instead of denying them.

00:17:31.051 --> 00:17:33.970 position:50% align:center
Or I'll always be an idiot.

00:17:34.054 --> 00:17:39.434 position:50% align:center
Truth is, if I keep shifting the
blame, then I'll never change.

00:17:39.517 --> 00:17:41.436 position:50% align:center
And I want to.

00:17:43.063 --> 00:17:45.190 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
What's that?

00:17:45.273 --> 00:17:48.610 position:50% align:center
That look. That same look.

00:17:48.693 --> 00:17:51.780 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
No. Don't go!

00:17:51.863 --> 00:17:54.074 position:50% align:center
I'm telling you,
everything's fine.

00:17:59.871 --> 00:18:01.664 position:50% align:center
Apologize.

00:18:01.748 --> 00:18:02.540 position:50% align:center
Akito.

00:18:02.624 --> 00:18:07.212 position:50% align:center
Do it now! Apologize! Apologize!

00:18:07.295 --> 00:18:09.130 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:18:12.801 --> 00:18:14.260 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
Akito.

00:18:14.344 --> 00:18:17.722 position:50% align:center
Yuki! What on earth happened?
You're bleeding, my beloved!

00:18:17.806 --> 00:18:20.058 position:50% align:center
I'm fine. It's not bad.

00:18:20.141 --> 00:18:21.643 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
Still, it must hurt.

00:18:21.726 --> 00:18:25.271 position:50% align:center
But fear not! I'll lend you my
strength until yours returns.

00:18:25.355 --> 00:18:27.273 position:50% align:center
Stop wailing and follow me.

00:18:27.357 --> 00:18:28.483 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
At once!

00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:29.901 position:50% align:center
Don't you die on me!

00:18:29.984 --> 00:18:32.320 position:50% align:center
Remember that sunset on
the banks of the Seine

00:18:32.404 --> 00:18:34.280 position:50% align:center
when we promised that we
wouldn't depart this world

00:18:34.364 --> 00:18:35.949 position:50% align:center
without the other at our side?!

00:18:36.032 --> 00:18:38.201 position:50% align:center
Literally none of that happened?

00:18:38.284 --> 00:18:39.536 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
Hold on. Stay with me...

00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:43.498 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I'm sorry.
But I didn't come back to you.

00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:45.542 position:50% align:center
And I never will.

00:18:47.293 --> 00:18:48.795 position:50% align:center
[HATORI]
Your brother.

00:18:48.878 --> 00:18:51.673 position:50% align:center
He made it sound like you had
one foot in the grave already.

00:18:51.756 --> 00:18:53.216 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
You know him.

00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:55.593 position:50% align:center
The cut's not a
particularly deep one,

00:18:55.677 --> 00:18:58.430 position:50% align:center
but I'd get it checked at
the hospital just in case.

00:18:58.513 --> 00:19:01.182 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I will. Thank you.

00:19:01.266 --> 00:19:02.434 position:50% align:center
[HATORI]
Don't thank me.

00:19:02.517 --> 00:19:05.562 position:50% align:center
I should've intervened.
I'm sorry.

00:19:05.645 --> 00:19:07.480 position:50% align:center
No, it's okay.

00:19:07.564 --> 00:19:10.817 position:50% align:center
Honestly, that might have
made things even worse.

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:12.360 position:50% align:center
[HATORI]
What did you say to Akito?

00:19:12.444 --> 00:19:14.612 position:50% align:center
Oh. Not much.

00:19:14.696 --> 00:19:18.408 position:50% align:center
Just that I'm tired of
blaming others, and...

00:19:18.491 --> 00:19:23.872 position:50% align:center
Uh. Actually, I need to
apologize to you for something.

00:19:23.955 --> 00:19:27.417 position:50% align:center
You remember... that day?

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:32.589 position:50% align:center
I think, deep down, I've been
blaming you all this time.

00:19:32.672 --> 00:19:37.302 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] It's the guilt.
You feel like you owe Yuki.

00:19:37.385 --> 00:19:39.846 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Don't erase their memories.

00:19:39.929 --> 00:19:42.766 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I didn't get it back then.

00:19:42.849 --> 00:19:46.686 position:50% align:center
Sorry. You were hurt, too.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:48.563 position:50% align:center
Huh.

00:19:48.646 --> 00:19:50.440 position:50% align:center
Don't you worry about me.

00:19:50.523 --> 00:19:52.400 position:50% align:center
There's nothing
to apologize for.

00:19:52.484 --> 00:19:54.319 position:50% align:center
Um, that hurts.

00:19:54.402 --> 00:19:57.113 position:50% align:center
[HATORI]
You're kind. You know that?

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.950 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:20:04.037 --> 00:20:05.205 position:50% align:center
[HATORI]
Don't turn into Ayame.

00:20:05.288 --> 00:20:06.373 position:50% align:center
Not a chance.

00:20:06.456 --> 00:20:09.668 position:50% align:center
Here! Have you completed
treatment, doctor?

00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:11.670 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
What's this?

00:20:11.753 --> 00:20:14.422 position:50% align:center
Are you running off somewhere?

00:20:14.506 --> 00:20:17.801 position:50% align:center
Yuki seems like he's gonna be
all right, so I'm slipping out.

00:20:17.884 --> 00:20:20.303 position:50% align:center
My. Quite the
opportunist, aren't you?

00:20:20.387 --> 00:20:23.014 position:50% align:center
Going to see Rin
over at Kazuma's?

00:20:23.098 --> 00:20:26.643 position:50% align:center
Yep. Shouldn't you be
in talking to Akito?

00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:27.727 position:50% align:center
It's fine.

00:20:27.811 --> 00:20:28.937 position:50% align:center
I don't always
have to be the one

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.980 position:50% align:center
to smooth things over, you know.

00:20:31.064 --> 00:20:33.650 position:50% align:center
And frankly,
I don't feel like it.

00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:37.028 position:50% align:center
I have to say, you're
the moodiest man I know.

00:20:37.112 --> 00:20:40.073 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's me.
Consistently inconsistent.

00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:42.867 position:50% align:center
Well, tell Rin I said "hi."

00:20:42.951 --> 00:20:47.163 position:50% align:center
Right, assuming I can actually
get her to talk to me.

00:20:50.792 --> 00:20:52.711 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Oh, Akito.

00:20:52.794 --> 00:20:57.257 position:50% align:center
You've been blind to
so much for too long.

00:20:58.383 --> 00:21:00.301 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
When we were kids,

00:21:00.385 --> 00:21:03.680 position:50% align:center
Isuzu used to come here
to hang out sometimes.

00:21:03.763 --> 00:21:05.015 position:50% align:center
I think she enjoyed visiting

00:21:05.098 --> 00:21:07.809 position:50% align:center
'cause Master was
always so nice to her.

00:21:07.892 --> 00:21:11.229 position:50% align:center
But I felt like she was trying
to steal him away from me,

00:21:11.312 --> 00:21:13.857 position:50% align:center
so I didn't like her very much.

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.943 position:50% align:center
You know, that's kind
of adorable.

00:21:17.027 --> 00:21:20.030 position:50% align:center
I was a kid! I mean,
I don't think that now.

00:21:20.113 --> 00:21:20.905 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:21:20.989 --> 00:21:23.700 position:50% align:center
So, what is she up to anyway?

00:21:23.783 --> 00:21:25.493 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
She fell asleep.

00:21:25.577 --> 00:21:28.246 position:50% align:center
[KYO] So much for
ringing in the new year.

00:21:28.329 --> 00:21:31.666 position:50% align:center
Heh. We don't have very
long to wait now, do we?

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:33.376 position:50% align:center
Have you decided what
you're going to wish for

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.295 position:50% align:center
on your first shrine visit?

00:21:35.378 --> 00:21:36.546 position:50% align:center
If you ask someone their wish,

00:21:36.629 --> 00:21:38.131 position:50% align:center
you've gotta tell
them yours, too.

00:21:38.214 --> 00:21:42.761 position:50% align:center
Oh! Right, I totally forgot.
Um, never mind then.

00:21:42.844 --> 00:21:44.012 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Last year,

00:21:44.095 --> 00:21:47.057 position:50% align:center
I wished for Yuki and
Kyo to get along better,

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.351 position:50% align:center
but I want something
different now.

00:21:49.434 --> 00:21:52.354 position:50% align:center
Something bigger.

00:21:52.437 --> 00:21:55.815 position:50% align:center
My wish is for the
curse to be broken...

00:21:55.899 --> 00:22:00.445 position:50% align:center
...so they can be
free and happy.

00:22:00.528 --> 00:22:02.739 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Kureno.

00:22:02.822 --> 00:22:06.284 position:50% align:center
I have a present... from Tohru.

00:22:09.245 --> 00:22:12.540 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Even if it starts
from something small...

00:22:16.252 --> 00:22:17.962 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
...I wish...

00:22:21.424 --> 00:22:23.885 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
...for change to come.

00:23:56.978 --> 00:23:58.855 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
"I'm different now."
