[KAGURA'S MOTHER]
Vacuum cleaner coming through.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.601 position:50% align:center
What's with you?

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:19.894 position:50% align:center
Don't know if you heard,

00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:22.647 position:50% align:center
but apparently Akito
is back in town.

00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:25.108 position:50% align:center
Really? So Kyo is, too?

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:28.611 position:50% align:center
Don't know. Why don't you
try giving him a call?

00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:33.366 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA] Kyo, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:37.454 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA]
I've been thinking a lot lately,

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:41.166 position:50% align:center
and I realized why I
came up to you that day.

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:44.419 position:50% align:center
Why I made you my friend.

00:00:44.502 --> 00:00:46.629 position:50% align:center
The real reason...

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:49.090 position:50% align:center
...I fell in love with you.

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.968 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Home sweet home.

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:53.928 position:50% align:center
As fun as that was,
it's nice to be back.

00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:56.181 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
You've returned at last!

00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:00.185 position:50% align:center
You must be fatigued
from your long journey.

00:01:00.268 --> 00:01:01.644 position:50% align:center
Come. Rest.

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:04.522 position:50% align:center
Relax and make yourselves
at home, intrepid travelers.

00:01:04.606 --> 00:01:07.233 position:50% align:center
What a surprise.
It's so nice to see you!

00:01:07.317 --> 00:01:08.693 position:50% align:center
Ah, sweet Tohru.

00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:11.446 position:50% align:center
How was your little trip?
An enlightening experience?

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:13.740 position:50% align:center
Hey, how the hell did
you get into the house?

00:01:13.823 --> 00:01:15.825 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Now, Kyo, take it easy.

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.120 position:50% align:center
Aya was kind enough to housesit
for us while we were gone.

00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:21.164 position:50% align:center
Is that the story
we're going with?

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:24.876 position:50% align:center
"Housesitting"? Right. You
forgot to lock up, didn't you?

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:26.670 position:50% align:center
Guilty as charged.

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:30.173 position:50% align:center
But, anyway, why did you miss
out on all the fun, Aya?

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:31.841 position:50% align:center
Summer is the season of romance,

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:33.927 position:50% align:center
so my shop was simply
swamped with orders.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.969 position:50% align:center
Um, Shigure?

00:01:35.053 --> 00:01:36.554 position:50% align:center
Yes?

00:01:36.638 --> 00:01:38.306 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Would it be okay if I
made a phone call real quick?

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.849 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course, go ahead.

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.726 position:50% align:center
Ah, great. Thank you.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.978 position:50% align:center
So, did you come
here for a reason?

00:01:44.062 --> 00:01:46.606 position:50% align:center
Other than to annoy me.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.359 position:50% align:center
I heard Akito made a trip
to the summer house.

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:52.195 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. You needed
your big brother.

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:55.657 position:50% align:center
And I failed to protect
you once again.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.409 position:50% align:center
But I'm here for you now.

00:01:57.492 --> 00:01:59.119 position:50% align:center
I shall hold you
in my arms tonight

00:01:59.202 --> 00:02:01.788 position:50% align:center
and heal your wounded heart
with my brotherly love!

00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:04.624 position:50% align:center
No way. I mean it--stay back!

00:02:04.708 --> 00:02:09.629 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Oh, he's away on a trip?
Um, no, no thank you.

00:02:09.713 --> 00:02:13.675 position:50% align:center
I would actually like to keep it
from the others if that's okay.

00:02:13.758 --> 00:02:17.095 position:50% align:center
Yes. Please. I'd really
appreciate that, thanks.

00:02:17.178 --> 00:02:18.847 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I'm fine.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.223 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
When summer started,

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:23.184 position:50% align:center
I had a feeling that something
was about to happen.

00:02:23.268 --> 00:02:25.979 position:50% align:center
Something big.

00:02:26.062 --> 00:02:27.814 position:50% align:center
And it looks like I was right.

00:02:27.897 --> 00:02:30.025 position:50% align:center
Something's beginning to stir,

00:02:30.108 --> 00:02:33.778 position:50% align:center
and I think it will
touch everyone.

00:02:33.862 --> 00:02:36.823 position:50% align:center
The Somas, and me, too.

00:02:36.906 --> 00:02:39.492 position:50% align:center
I have something
new to fight for.

00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:40.910 position:50% align:center
If you're refusing my embrace,

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:43.329 position:50% align:center
then I have no choice but
to hold Tohru as I sleep!

[TOHRU yelps]

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:46.875 position:50% align:center
I fail to see the
connection. Creep.

00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:50.920 position:50% align:center
Go on, try it. Really,
just give me an excuse.

00:02:52.464 --> 00:02:54.382 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Thanks for letting me visit.

00:02:54.466 --> 00:02:56.843 position:50% align:center
Sorry to come so soon
after you got back.

00:02:56.926 --> 00:02:58.803 position:50% align:center
I won't bother you long.

00:02:58.887 --> 00:03:00.555 position:50% align:center
Please, don't worry.

00:03:00.638 --> 00:03:03.600 position:50% align:center
It was a brief trip,
and not a very tiring one.

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:06.061 position:50% align:center
I went to see some friends
who live out of town,

00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:08.980 position:50% align:center
and also to visit my
grandfather's grave.

00:03:09.064 --> 00:03:11.649 position:50% align:center
The Soma grave isn't nearby?

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:13.526 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
No, it is.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.197 position:50% align:center
But they didn't allow my
grandfather to be buried there.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.990 position:50% align:center
He was laid to rest far away.

00:03:19.074 --> 00:03:20.241 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:22.077 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
I know how it sounds,

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.163 position:50% align:center
but honestly, I think
it's better this way.

00:03:25.246 --> 00:03:29.501 position:50% align:center
He has a kind of freedom in
death that he never had in life.

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:32.462 position:50% align:center
He's finally able
to be "outside."

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:35.548 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
But...

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:40.011 position:50% align:center
But Kyo, he's still
alive, and he's free.

00:03:40.095 --> 00:03:42.305 position:50% align:center
Living "outside."

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:49.187 position:50% align:center
Except, I heard... that's going
to change not long from now.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.108 position:50% align:center
That's what Akito said
when we talked.

00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:57.362 position:50% align:center
After high school,
Kyo will be locked away.

00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:04.744 position:50% align:center
Yuki and the others will be
going back to the Soma estate.

00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:08.998 position:50% align:center
All the zodiac members
will be reunited, for good.

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:12.043 position:50% align:center
They're destined to be
together forever.

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:19.592 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] With Akito as the master
of their hearts and souls.

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:22.971 position:50% align:center
If all that's true,
and the curse is binding them

00:04:23.054 --> 00:04:26.307 position:50% align:center
to the future Akito
told me about...

00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:29.811 position:50% align:center
...then I wanna find
a way to stop it.

00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:32.564 position:50% align:center
I wanna break the curse.

00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:34.482 position:50% align:center
That's why I came here.

00:04:34.566 --> 00:04:35.942 position:50% align:center
If you know something,

00:04:36.026 --> 00:04:38.611 position:50% align:center
anything that might
help set them free,

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:41.072 position:50% align:center
I'm begging you to tell me.

00:04:42.073 --> 00:04:43.491 position:50% align:center
Begging?

00:04:43.575 --> 00:04:47.954 position:50% align:center
Why should you of all people
beg me for anything, Tohru?

00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:49.539 position:50% align:center
Really.

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:55.920 position:50% align:center
After everything you've already
done for us, you'd do even more.

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:59.257 position:50% align:center
How much do you have to give?

00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:01.468 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Master? I--

00:05:02.927 --> 00:05:05.138 position:50% align:center
Of course I'll help
in any way I can,

00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:06.556 position:50% align:center
but to be honest,

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:09.976 position:50% align:center
I don't know all the details
of the curse, either.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.730 position:50% align:center
Still, I do know the future
Akito described to you--

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:17.067 position:50% align:center
where Kyo is locked away and the
others return to the estate--

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.195 position:50% align:center
may well come to pass.

00:05:20.278 --> 00:05:22.697 position:50% align:center
Naturally, I don't plan
to let that future

00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:24.824 position:50% align:center
play out without resistance.

00:05:24.908 --> 00:05:28.620 position:50% align:center
But there's only
so much I can do.

00:05:28.703 --> 00:05:30.538 position:50% align:center
Perhaps the most
tragic thing of all

00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:34.876 position:50% align:center
is that the zodiac members
lack the will to oppose Akito.

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:37.420 position:50% align:center
Akito is like a small child,

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:39.547 position:50% align:center
screaming and
crying hysterically

00:05:39.631 --> 00:05:41.549 position:50% align:center
to get what it wants.

00:05:41.633 --> 00:05:44.844 position:50% align:center
A fragile, unstable child.

00:05:44.928 --> 00:05:48.473 position:50% align:center
Yet, to those possessed
by the animal spirits,

00:05:48.556 --> 00:05:50.600 position:50% align:center
that child is a god.

00:05:50.684 --> 00:05:53.561 position:50% align:center
A being to be feared
and respected.

00:05:53.645 --> 00:05:55.897 position:50% align:center
Whether they're weak or strong,

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.899 position:50% align:center
they feel that
irresistible pull,

00:05:57.982 --> 00:06:00.735 position:50% align:center
and a single word of rejection
from Akito's lips

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:02.404 position:50% align:center
makes them feel like
they're being torn apart

00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:04.864 position:50% align:center
from the inside out.

00:06:04.948 --> 00:06:08.451 position:50% align:center
It's as if the zodiac members
and their god exist in a world

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:12.789 position:50% align:center
that is unfathomable and
impenetrable to others.

00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:15.417 position:50% align:center
A world that's theirs alone.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.379 position:50% align:center
They're connected by that which
flows through their veins.

00:06:19.462 --> 00:06:21.673 position:50% align:center
It's a bond of blood.

00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:26.803 position:50% align:center
So that's what the
curse is? A bond?

00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:29.305 position:50% align:center
That's my theory, anyway.

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:37.522 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] But a bond like that...
is supposed to be sacred.

00:06:37.605 --> 00:06:40.775 position:50% align:center
If I come between
them and break it,

00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:45.780 position:50% align:center
then maybe I deserve to be
punished, like Akito said.

00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:47.240 position:50% align:center
But...

00:06:47.323 --> 00:06:49.534 position:50% align:center
I refuse to give up.

00:06:50.535 --> 00:06:55.040 position:50% align:center
I'm beginning to think...
that you don't know how to.

00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:57.292 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry I could
not be of more help.

00:06:57.375 --> 00:06:59.210 position:50% align:center
Ah! No, it's okay!

00:06:59.294 --> 00:07:01.880 position:50% align:center
Uh, I-I mean, you've helped
out a lot, really. So, uh--

00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:03.882 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
You learned about the cage.

00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:05.216 position:50% align:center
I hoped you wouldn't.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.427 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Hey, Master?

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:12.349 position:50% align:center
You know, I've noticed Kyo seems
to be getting stronger lately.

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:14.100 position:50% align:center
He's growing a lot, too.

00:07:14.184 --> 00:07:15.852 position:50% align:center
I think even his hands
are getting bigger

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:17.270 position:50% align:center
than they used to be.

00:07:17.354 --> 00:07:18.772 position:50% align:center
Heh. Who knows?

00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:20.607 position:50% align:center
At this rate, he may
end up being taller

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.108 position:50% align:center
than you are someday.

00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:26.529 position:50% align:center
I don't know about you, but
I'd really like to see that.

00:07:26.613 --> 00:07:28.698 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:07:28.782 --> 00:07:31.701 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] If you wanna know
how you can help them,

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:36.623 position:50% align:center
then I would say, the best thing
you can do is to keep smiling.

00:07:36.706 --> 00:07:38.833 position:50% align:center
It sounds silly, but...

00:07:38.917 --> 00:07:42.212 position:50% align:center
When you smile, the whole
world feels a little gentler

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:44.506 position:50% align:center
and a little less frightening.

00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:47.050 position:50% align:center
Keep being yourself,
no matter what.

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:50.637 position:50% align:center
That's what they need.
Probably more than anything.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.763 position:50% align:center

Oh, but I'm just me.

00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:54.891 position:50% align:center
It's not like I'm
anything special.

00:07:54.974 --> 00:07:57.519 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA chuckles]

00:07:57.602 --> 00:07:59.354 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
You are.

00:07:59.437 --> 00:08:03.733 position:50% align:center
And the time they spend with
you will keep them going.

00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:09.781 position:50% align:center
It will give them strength...
to forge new bonds.

00:08:09.864 --> 00:08:12.659 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA]
Kyo! There you are!

00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:15.453 position:50% align:center
Aw, I missed you so much,
you have no idea!

00:08:15.537 --> 00:08:17.539 position:50% align:center
Gimme a break. You just
saw me the other day.

00:08:17.622 --> 00:08:21.376 position:50% align:center
Are you kidding me? That was
forever ago, and you know it!

00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:26.464 position:50% align:center
Hey, how come you only practice
at the dojo three times a week?

00:08:26.548 --> 00:08:28.675 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't every day be better?

00:08:28.758 --> 00:08:30.844 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
We don't know what will happen.

00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:33.680 position:50% align:center
So, Kyo, for now I suggest
you treasure the time

00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:35.640 position:50% align:center
you can call that house "home."

00:08:35.724 --> 00:08:36.933 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA]
Kyo!

00:08:37.017 --> 00:08:38.268 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:40.687 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA] Well, I'm waiting.
Where's my souvenir?

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:42.814 position:50% align:center
What? I didn't buy you any.

00:08:42.897 --> 00:08:45.358 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA]
You're kidding!

00:08:45.442 --> 00:08:48.361 position:50% align:center
You went on vacation and didn't
get your girlfriend anything?

00:08:48.445 --> 00:08:49.863 position:50% align:center
--[KYO] Kagura.
--You jerk!

00:08:49.946 --> 00:08:51.823 position:50% align:center
Is that how you
show you love me?

00:08:51.906 --> 00:08:55.368 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Kagura! We have to talk.

00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:59.956 position:50% align:center
The thing is, there's something
I need to make clear to you.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:00.665 position:50% align:center
I'm not--

00:09:00.749 --> 00:09:01.708 position:50% align:center
Let's go out.

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:02.625 position:50% align:center
What?

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:04.544 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA]
Let's go on a date.

00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:07.339 position:50% align:center
I won't listen to what you
have to say until we do.

00:09:07.422 --> 00:09:09.007 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Wh--? It'll just take a sec.

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.677 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA] Don't care.
My terms are non-negotiable.

00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:19.017 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA]
Please, Kyo. I'm not ready yet.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.812 position:50% align:center
Let me give you a hard time
for just a little longer.

00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:28.234 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
The curse, a bond of blood.

00:09:28.318 --> 00:09:31.363 position:50% align:center
Still, there's gotta be
something I can do, right?

00:09:31.446 --> 00:09:32.489 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:34.115 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Oh. Isuzu?

00:09:34.199 --> 00:09:35.408 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:35.492 --> 00:09:37.994 position:50% align:center
Hey, um, it's nice
to see you again.

00:09:38.078 --> 00:09:40.872 position:50% align:center
How are you? Feeling any better?

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:43.958 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Piece of advice?

00:09:44.042 --> 00:09:47.962 position:50% align:center
You should stop hanging
around the Somas, got it?

00:09:49.506 --> 00:09:52.550 position:50% align:center
[KUNIMITSU] Wait, please.
Your shoes! Take off your shoes!

00:09:52.634 --> 00:09:55.428 position:50% align:center
Isuzu, get back here!

00:09:55.512 --> 00:09:58.098 position:50% align:center
I seem to be awfully
popular today.

00:09:58.181 --> 00:10:01.601 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I saw your last visitor
when I was on my way in.

00:10:01.685 --> 00:10:03.561 position:50% align:center
Why was she here?

00:10:03.645 --> 00:10:04.813 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
To ask me the same thing

00:10:04.896 --> 00:10:07.941 position:50% align:center
I imagine you're about to ask.

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:09.651 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
That girl.

00:10:09.734 --> 00:10:13.321 position:50% align:center
I won't let her
interfere. I won't.

00:10:14.698 --> 00:10:16.199 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Hold on. Rin?

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:18.368 position:50% align:center
Yes. I saw her.

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:19.661 position:50% align:center
Where were you?

00:10:19.744 --> 00:10:20.870 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:22.288 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I forgot I'm keeping it a secret

00:10:22.372 --> 00:10:23.832 position:50% align:center
that I went to see Master!

00:10:23.915 --> 00:10:26.334 position:50% align:center
Oh, you know.
I was just in town.

00:10:26.418 --> 00:10:27.627 position:50% align:center
Like, right there in the middle.

00:10:27.711 --> 00:10:29.879 position:50% align:center
--[KYO] Tohru.
--No! I'm innocent, I swear!

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:31.381 position:50% align:center
Whoa. What's up with you?

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:33.008 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Uh. Sorry.

00:10:33.091 --> 00:10:34.884 position:50% align:center
Did you wanna talk
about something?

00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:37.303 position:50% align:center
Uh. It's just...

00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:41.474 position:50% align:center
I'm going out on Sunday,
so don't, ya know, cook for me.

00:10:41.558 --> 00:10:42.726 position:50% align:center
Ah. Okay.

00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:44.060 position:50% align:center
Hot date?

00:10:44.144 --> 00:10:46.354 position:50% align:center
No! Don't be an idiot.
It's not a date.

00:10:46.438 --> 00:10:48.440 position:50% align:center
So... hanging out
with Kagura then...

00:10:48.523 --> 00:10:50.316 position:50% align:center
Kyo. Do you think
you could stop?

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.152 position:50% align:center
You're kind of hurting my ears.

00:10:52.235 --> 00:10:53.403 position:50% align:center
Stupid Cat.

00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:55.071 position:50% align:center
So you have time
to go on a date,

00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:57.657 position:50% align:center
but you're too busy to
pick up Miss Honda from work.

00:10:57.741 --> 00:10:59.200 position:50% align:center
Real nice.

00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:01.369 position:50% align:center
Look, that doesn't have anything
to do with this, all right?

00:11:01.453 --> 00:11:04.039 position:50% align:center
I wonder what that was for.

00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:07.834 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Hey, why are you givin' me that

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:09.919 position:50% align:center
"you're a total idiot" look?

00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:12.756 position:50% align:center
If you've got a problem
with me, say it out loud!

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:16.051 position:50% align:center
Um, please don't start
hitting each other, okay?

00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:19.387 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Happiness, light, and laughter.

00:11:19.471 --> 00:11:22.849 position:50% align:center
You don't hold any of them back.

00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:26.895 position:50% align:center
You give so much to all of them.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.943 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA]
Hey, Kyo!

00:11:34.027 --> 00:11:36.654 position:50% align:center
Right here! Looking for me?

00:11:36.738 --> 00:11:38.073 position:50% align:center
Whoa, you don't need to yell.

00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:39.699 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA]
You made it right on time.

00:11:39.783 --> 00:11:41.868 position:50% align:center
Good boy. I'm proud of you.

00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:45.080 position:50% align:center
Of course, I managed to get
here 30 whole minutes early.

00:11:45.163 --> 00:11:45.955 position:50% align:center
Nice, huh?

00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:49.584 position:50% align:center
What? Oh, uh, yeah. Great job.

00:11:49.668 --> 00:11:53.046 position:50% align:center
Brighten up. Jeez. You're not
nearly excited enough, Kyo.

00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:54.714 position:50% align:center
We're supposed to be having fun.

00:11:54.798 --> 00:11:57.592 position:50% align:center
You're way too excited.
I figure it balances out.

00:11:57.676 --> 00:12:00.428 position:50% align:center
So, have you decided where
we're gonna go yet?

00:12:00.512 --> 00:12:02.514 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. Sure have!

00:12:02.597 --> 00:12:05.141 position:50% align:center
At first I was thinking maybe
we could go to a movie,

00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:07.268 position:50% align:center
but I thought you might
not feel like it.

00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:08.812 position:50% align:center
Good call.

00:12:08.895 --> 00:12:11.523 position:50% align:center
After all this time, you still
don't watch TV or anything?

00:12:11.606 --> 00:12:14.776 position:50% align:center
You can, you know.
No one'll get mad at you now.

00:12:15.819 --> 00:12:18.780 position:50% align:center
It's not about that. Not really.

00:12:18.863 --> 00:12:21.574 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA]
Oh. Not long ago...

00:12:21.658 --> 00:12:23.284 position:50% align:center
Just drop it, will ya?!

00:12:23.368 --> 00:12:25.912 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA]
...he would've yelled at me.

00:12:25.995 --> 00:12:31.626 position:50% align:center
But, to be fair, he
wasn't always like that.

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:33.586 position:50% align:center
'Kay, let's go!

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.255 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Go where?

00:12:35.338 --> 00:12:37.590 position:50% align:center
Kagura, just answer me.

00:12:37.674 --> 00:12:42.512 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA] I still remember
a Kyo who was shy and sweet.

00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:43.847 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA]
Kyo- <i>chan</i> ?

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.725 position:50% align:center
You're Kyo- <i>chan</i> ,
the Cat, right?

00:12:46.808 --> 00:12:49.811 position:50% align:center
I'm Kagura. Nice to meet'cha.

00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:54.733 position:50% align:center
Why are you running away?

00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:57.569 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
'Cause! I'll get in trouble.

00:12:57.652 --> 00:13:00.822 position:50% align:center
Mom says that I'm not
supposed to talk to anybody.

00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:04.075 position:50% align:center
You can talk to me,
'cause I'm just like you.

00:13:04.159 --> 00:13:08.079 position:50% align:center
A zodiac member! I'm the Boar.

00:13:08.163 --> 00:13:11.082 position:50% align:center
So, uh, what are
these drawings of?

00:13:11.166 --> 00:13:12.667 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Fried eggs.

00:13:12.751 --> 00:13:15.295 position:50% align:center
They your favorite
food or something?

00:13:18.298 --> 00:13:21.051 position:50% align:center
Do you always play
by yourself like this?

00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:23.386 position:50% align:center
Don't you have any friends?

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:29.434 position:50% align:center
Hey, talk to me! Tell me
some stuff about you.

00:13:29.517 --> 00:13:31.936 position:50% align:center
Like, what kinda TV
shows do you watch?

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:35.732 position:50% align:center
I don't. Mom gets
mad if I try to.

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:39.444 position:50% align:center
She says there's a lotta
bad stuff on there.

00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:44.449 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA] Well, if you want
someone to play with you,

00:13:44.532 --> 00:13:46.034 position:50% align:center
I will.

00:13:46.117 --> 00:13:47.494 position:50% align:center
You mean it?

00:13:47.577 --> 00:13:50.038 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Of course!

00:13:50.121 --> 00:13:52.749 position:50% align:center
From now on, I'm gonna
stay by your side, okay?

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:56.002 position:50% align:center
You and I will be
together forever!

00:13:58.463 --> 00:14:00.215 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA]
Sorry, Kyo.

00:14:00.298 --> 00:14:03.551 position:50% align:center
I'm an awful person, aren't I?

00:14:03.635 --> 00:14:05.136 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Kagura.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.638 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA gasps]

00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:10.308 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA] Oh, I know
what that look means.

00:14:10.392 --> 00:14:15.105 position:50% align:center
You figured it out, huh?
Where we're headed.

00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:19.317 position:50% align:center
Blast from the past.
You ready for this?

00:14:19.401 --> 00:14:22.112 position:50% align:center
Here we are!

00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:23.196 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA gasps]

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:25.073 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA]
Looks like we're not alone.

00:14:25.156 --> 00:14:27.325 position:50% align:center
Wonder if they're Soma kids
sneaking out of the house

00:14:27.409 --> 00:14:30.370 position:50% align:center
to play like we used to.

00:14:30.453 --> 00:14:31.955 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, Kyo.

00:14:32.038 --> 00:14:35.291 position:50% align:center
I know it can't be easy for you,
being this close to the estate.

00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:39.504 position:50% align:center
But I guess... it just seemed
like the right place to talk.

00:14:39.587 --> 00:14:42.382 position:50% align:center
Considering that this
is where it happened.

00:14:42.465 --> 00:14:45.343 position:50% align:center
It's where I saw your true form.

00:14:45.427 --> 00:14:47.095 position:50% align:center
Aw, please, Kyo- <i>chan</i> .

00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:48.847 position:50% align:center
I wanna try on your
bracelet just once.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:51.808 position:50% align:center
I'll give it right back!

00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:55.186 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA] You did everything
you could to keep it from me,

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:58.314 position:50% align:center
but I took it anyway.

00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:02.902 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:07.532 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA screaming]

00:15:09.075 --> 00:15:12.078 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA] After that,
things changed for you.

00:15:12.162 --> 00:15:13.663 position:50% align:center
Your mom got even stricter,

00:15:13.747 --> 00:15:17.125 position:50% align:center
and she stopped letting
you go out as much.

00:15:17.208 --> 00:15:20.211 position:50% align:center
You know better than anyone.

00:15:20.295 --> 00:15:23.590 position:50% align:center
It's hard being born as
a member of the zodiac.

00:15:23.673 --> 00:15:28.470 position:50% align:center
We struggle with it. All of us.

00:15:28.553 --> 00:15:32.307 position:50% align:center
When I was a kid, and my
parents fought because of me,

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:36.061 position:50% align:center
or later, when I saw
my mom crying alone...

00:15:37.562 --> 00:15:39.105 position:50% align:center
...it made me sad.

00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:43.985 position:50% align:center
And each time, I hated
myself even more.

00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:47.280 position:50% align:center
I was insecure.

00:15:47.364 --> 00:15:52.494 position:50% align:center
That's why, meeting you
that day... made me happy.

00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:58.541 position:50% align:center
I felt better about myself.

00:15:58.625 --> 00:16:01.002 position:50% align:center
Because compared to the Cat's,

00:16:01.086 --> 00:16:03.797 position:50% align:center
my life wasn't that
hard after all.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.382 position:50% align:center
Not really.

00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:07.842 position:50% align:center
And compared to this
kid drawing eggs

00:16:07.926 --> 00:16:14.015 position:50% align:center
in the dirt all by himself,
I wasn't so pitiful.

00:16:14.099 --> 00:16:19.187 position:50% align:center
Compared to him,
I wasn't suffering.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:22.232 position:50% align:center
I wasn't the one people hated.

00:16:22.315 --> 00:16:25.610 position:50% align:center
That's the reason
I stuck with you.

00:16:25.694 --> 00:16:27.904 position:50% align:center
That's why...

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:31.157 position:50% align:center
But all that time,
I was looking down on you.

00:16:32.909 --> 00:16:34.786 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA]
I'm awful.

00:16:34.869 --> 00:16:39.290 position:50% align:center
Really, truly... awful.

00:16:41.084 --> 00:16:43.420 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA] When I ran away
from you that day,

00:16:43.503 --> 00:16:46.131 position:50% align:center
I was scared out of my mind.

00:16:46.214 --> 00:16:49.384 position:50% align:center
I was also disgusted
with myself.

00:16:49.467 --> 00:16:55.056 position:50% align:center
I couldn't stand that feeling.
Like I was unclean.

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.100 position:50% align:center
I wished I could do it over.

00:16:57.183 --> 00:17:00.437 position:50% align:center
Get a chance to
make things right.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.523 position:50% align:center
This time, I would be better.

00:17:03.606 --> 00:17:06.026 position:50% align:center
I would be someone good.

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:08.695 position:50% align:center
Someone who could
accept your true form.

00:17:08.778 --> 00:17:11.740 position:50% align:center
Of course, that very
thought was vile,

00:17:11.823 --> 00:17:15.118 position:50% align:center
even if I didn't see it then.

00:17:15.201 --> 00:17:17.996 position:50% align:center
I wanted to rewrite history.

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:21.583 position:50% align:center
Believing that if I could
fall in love with you,

00:17:21.666 --> 00:17:27.088 position:50% align:center
and if one day, you
started to love me back,

00:17:27.172 --> 00:17:32.427 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't be her anymore--
the disgusting girl who ran away

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:36.222 position:50% align:center
when you needed her
to stay by your side.

00:17:36.306 --> 00:17:40.935 position:50% align:center
But how could something
so selfish be called love?

00:17:41.019 --> 00:17:46.066 position:50% align:center
I realized everything
when I saw her that night,

00:17:46.149 --> 00:17:49.235 position:50% align:center
running after you.

00:17:49.319 --> 00:17:52.697 position:50% align:center
The way I failed to do.

00:17:52.781 --> 00:17:57.952 position:50% align:center
I never thought about your pain,
or how scared you must've been.

00:17:58.036 --> 00:18:04.626 position:50% align:center
Truth is, in the end, I was
only thinking about myself.

00:18:04.709 --> 00:18:07.295 position:50% align:center
Chasing you wasn't about you.

00:18:07.379 --> 00:18:10.965 position:50% align:center
It was always something
I did for my own sake.

00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:19.474 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA]
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Kyo.

00:18:19.557 --> 00:18:21.309 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA]
I'm sorry!

00:18:23.144 --> 00:18:25.146 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
It's okay.

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:26.523 position:50% align:center
You didn't need to bring me here

00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:29.567 position:50% align:center
and say all this stuff
that's obviously hurting you.

00:18:29.651 --> 00:18:32.487 position:50% align:center
So stop.

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:35.156 position:50% align:center
Listen.

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:39.202 position:50% align:center
I'm never going to fall
in love with you, Kagura.

00:18:39.285 --> 00:18:41.621 position:50% align:center
Or anyone else, for that matter.

00:18:41.705 --> 00:18:46.001 position:50% align:center
I just... thought you
should know that.

00:18:46.084 --> 00:18:50.046 position:50% align:center
So you looked down on me.
What's it matter?

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:52.507 position:50% align:center
I don't care.

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:55.385 position:50% align:center
You have nothing
to apologize for.

00:18:56.428 --> 00:18:58.388 position:50% align:center
'Kay!

00:18:58.471 --> 00:19:03.685 position:50% align:center
Still, I wanted to tell
you that, and now I have.

00:19:05.228 --> 00:19:09.774 position:50% align:center
I feel better, but all that
confessing made me hungry.

00:19:09.858 --> 00:19:13.611 position:50% align:center
I should get going. See you.

00:19:15.822 --> 00:19:17.824 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Kagura.

00:19:17.907 --> 00:19:19.826 position:50% align:center
Whatever your reasons,

00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:22.370 position:50% align:center
it made me happy when
you played with me.

00:19:22.454 --> 00:19:27.334 position:50% align:center
So, um... thank you.
For sticking around.

00:19:27.417 --> 00:19:28.877 position:50% align:center
[KIDS laughing]

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:32.797 position:50% align:center
[BOY A]
Hey, slow down, guys!

00:19:32.881 --> 00:19:33.840 position:50% align:center
Hurry up!

00:19:33.923 --> 00:19:36.801 position:50% align:center
Come on, sis,
please wait for me!

00:19:38.303 --> 00:19:40.096 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA]
It's true.

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:44.017 position:50% align:center
Loving him started out
as something selfish.

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.435 position:50% align:center
But...

00:19:47.145 --> 00:19:50.065 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA]
The way he would call my name.

00:19:50.148 --> 00:19:53.276 position:50% align:center
How adorably awkward he was.

00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:59.074 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA]
Somewhere along the line...

00:19:59.157 --> 00:20:00.200 position:50% align:center
Slow down!

00:20:00.283 --> 00:20:01.409 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:01.493 --> 00:20:05.080 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laughing]

00:20:05.163 --> 00:20:08.917 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Come on, Kagura! Wait for me!

00:20:12.003 --> 00:20:13.630 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA]
Kyo- <i>chan</i> !

00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:15.465 position:50% align:center
It's true!

00:20:15.548 --> 00:20:18.593 position:50% align:center
I swear. It's true.

00:20:18.677 --> 00:20:23.556 position:50% align:center
I know what I said,
but I do love you.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:28.395 position:50% align:center
Kyo- <i>chan</i> ! I love you so much!

00:20:28.478 --> 00:20:30.772 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA]
Believe me.

00:20:30.855 --> 00:20:33.066 position:50% align:center
Believe me.

00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:34.943 position:50% align:center
Believe me!

00:20:43.076 --> 00:20:45.578 position:50% align:center
Thanks for that.

00:20:45.662 --> 00:20:47.163 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:21:04.848 --> 00:21:06.558 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA'S MOTHER]
Kagura?

00:21:06.641 --> 00:21:08.351 position:50% align:center
Your face! What happened?

00:21:08.435 --> 00:21:10.311 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA]
It's nothing, Mom.

00:21:10.395 --> 00:21:12.897 position:50% align:center
See ya tomorrow.
I'm pretty beat.

00:21:12.981 --> 00:21:14.649 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA'S MOTHER]
Hold on. It can't be nothing.

00:21:14.733 --> 00:21:17.235 position:50% align:center
Your eyes are red and puffy.

00:21:17.318 --> 00:21:18.695 position:50% align:center
My poor girl.

00:21:18.778 --> 00:21:23.074 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA] I brought this on
myself, so don't pity me.

00:21:23.158 --> 00:21:26.119 position:50% align:center
I've been so selfish and stupid.

00:21:26.202 --> 00:21:29.330 position:50% align:center
It's past time for me
to own up to it.

00:21:29.414 --> 00:21:33.001 position:50% align:center
Thanks for worrying about me,
but I'm fine. Night.

00:21:33.084 --> 00:21:34.336 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:21:35.628 --> 00:21:37.130 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA]
Sorry.

00:21:37.213 --> 00:21:41.384 position:50% align:center
I know you care, but I
don't want your sympathy.

00:21:41.468 --> 00:21:44.679 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna share these
feelings with anyone else.

00:21:44.763 --> 00:21:45.889 position:50% align:center
Even you.

00:21:45.972 --> 00:21:48.516 position:50% align:center
I want to keep them for myself.

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:53.605 position:50% align:center
The hurt and the happiness...
they're all mine.

00:21:53.688 --> 00:21:55.982 position:50% align:center
So was Kyo, back then.

00:21:56.066 --> 00:21:59.277 position:50% align:center
And maybe some small part
of him still can be.

00:21:59.361 --> 00:22:03.281 position:50% align:center
I told him the truth,
the horrible truth,

00:22:03.365 --> 00:22:07.869 position:50% align:center
and instead of hating me,
he said "thank you."

00:22:07.952 --> 00:22:10.580 position:50% align:center
He held me while I sobbed,

00:22:10.663 --> 00:22:13.750 position:50% align:center
and stayed with me
until my eyes were dry.

00:22:15.377 --> 00:22:17.796 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA]
Let that be all mine.

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:24.219 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA]
At least... until morning comes.

00:23:57.395 --> 00:23:59.272 position:50% align:center
[HATORI]
"You cried for me."
