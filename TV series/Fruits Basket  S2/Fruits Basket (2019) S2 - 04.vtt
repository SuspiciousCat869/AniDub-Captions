00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:20.603 position:50% align:center
How are you, Rin?

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:22.355 position:50% align:center
Any better?

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:26.026 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Just get out.

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:32.365 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
This place is a cave.

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:36.327 position:50% align:center
I thought that these might
help brighten it up a bit.

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:38.955 position:50% align:center
Look. Pretty, right?

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:40.248 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:41.374 --> 00:00:43.209 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
I said, get out.

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:45.837 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.255 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
I don't need you.

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:49.090 position:50% align:center
Or want you.

00:00:52.093 --> 00:00:55.347 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Go. I'm sick of you.

[MOMIJI]
Tohru! Yuki! Kyo!

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:35.697 position:50% align:center
It's bad! It's bad!
It's really bad!

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.907 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, things
are bad here, too.

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:39.367 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Why? What's up?

00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:41.703 position:50% align:center
Oh, um, we were just talking
about the group activities

00:02:41.786 --> 00:02:43.455 position:50% align:center
we're going to do
on the class trip.

00:02:43.538 --> 00:02:46.458 position:50% align:center
That's super exciting.
When is it?

00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:48.877 position:50% align:center
Oh, well, not until fall,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.421 position:50% align:center
but our teacher did tell
us where we'll be going.

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:53.673 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Where? Where? Tell me! Tell me!

00:02:53.757 --> 00:02:54.924 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Kyoto and Nara.

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:56.092 position:50% align:center
So, the usual.

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:57.385 position:50% align:center
Very standard.

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:00.680 position:50% align:center
Aw, no fair. I wish
I could go with you guys!

00:03:00.764 --> 00:03:01.931 position:50% align:center
I bet you could,

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:04.142 position:50% align:center
but you'd have to pay
all your own expenses.

00:03:04.225 --> 00:03:05.852 position:50% align:center
Sure, sounds good to me!

00:03:05.935 --> 00:03:07.854 position:50% align:center
Not me!

00:03:07.937 --> 00:03:10.565 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Kyo is extra grouchy today, huh?

00:03:10.648 --> 00:03:12.233 position:50% align:center
Yeah, Carrots doesn't
seem too pleased

00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:13.860 position:50% align:center
about his fellow group members.

00:03:13.943 --> 00:03:15.987 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing Yuki's
one of them, then?

00:03:16.071 --> 00:03:18.239 position:50% align:center
[KYO] If that jerk is
going, then I'm not.

00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:19.783 position:50% align:center
I'm sick and tired
of being forced

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:22.035 position:50% align:center
to hang out with him
all the damn time.

00:03:22.118 --> 00:03:25.205 position:50% align:center
It's dumb. Group activities
aren't even mandatory.

00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:26.748 position:50% align:center
Maybe they're not,

00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:30.085 position:50% align:center
but things are so much
more fun with you around.

00:03:30.168 --> 00:03:32.504 position:50% align:center
I mean, who else are
we gonna mess with?

00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:34.964 position:50% align:center
So I'm basically a toy to you?

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:36.174 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
Mh-hm.

00:03:36.257 --> 00:03:39.260 position:50% align:center
[KYO] Uh! No way!
Screw all of you guys!

00:03:39.344 --> 00:03:41.638 position:50% align:center
Kyo, you big dummy!

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:43.056 position:50% align:center
You should just be
grateful that you're

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:45.642 position:50% align:center
going on a trip with Tohru
in the first place!

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:47.852 position:50% align:center
Maybe I should take
your spot instead.

00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:50.563 position:50% align:center
I'd buy us both deer crackers
and we'd eat them together!

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:52.148 position:50% align:center
Those aren't people food.

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:53.608 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Think about it, Kyo!

00:03:53.692 --> 00:03:56.152 position:50% align:center
Don't you want to do cool
stuff like that with Tohru?

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:59.114 position:50% align:center
Wha--? You idiot. Of course I--

00:03:59.197 --> 00:04:00.657 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Uh?

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.533 position:50% align:center
Of course you...?

00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:02.784 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
Of course you...?

00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:04.119 position:50% align:center
Of course you...?

00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:05.537 position:50% align:center
Why do I hang out
with any of you

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.831 position:50% align:center
when you're always
doing stuff like this?

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:09.374 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
We do it out of love.

00:04:09.457 --> 00:04:10.834 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Well, stop!

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:12.711 position:50% align:center
Oh. Yuki's here!

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:14.838 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey! What have
you been up to, Yuki?

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:17.173 position:50% align:center
Is everything going all right
with student council?

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:18.717 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Thanks.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.386 position:50% align:center
Working so hard. Good for you!

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:24.389 position:50% align:center
Why are you here?
Your homeroom over?

00:04:24.472 --> 00:04:25.223 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI gasps]

00:04:25.306 --> 00:04:26.891 position:50% align:center
Right, we got sidetracked.

00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:29.811 position:50% align:center
But didn't you say there was
an emergency or something?

00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:32.397 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, and it's
a big one, too.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.860 position:50% align:center
Haru turned Dark in class.
He's going on a crazy rampage.

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:39.779 position:50% align:center
[KYO] And you waited
until now to tell us?

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:42.991 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT A]
What up with Hatsuharu?

00:04:43.074 --> 00:04:47.662 position:50% align:center
I don't know, but it
seems pretty serious.

00:04:47.746 --> 00:04:49.080 position:50% align:center
Let me through, please.

00:04:49.164 --> 00:04:50.915 position:50% align:center
Huh? Soma- <i>senpai</i> .

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:53.460 position:50% align:center
Hold on. You shouldn't
go in there.

00:04:53.543 --> 00:04:54.794 position:50% align:center
It's all right.

00:04:54.878 --> 00:04:57.047 position:50% align:center
All of you--you, too--

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.258 position:50% align:center
please stay out of here
while we talk to him.

00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:01.551 position:50% align:center
Guess it could've been worse.

00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:04.721 position:50% align:center
At least he hasn't
transformed into an ox yet.

00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:08.558 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Hey, Haru!

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:10.185 position:50% align:center
What?

00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:11.227 position:50% align:center
[KYO sighs]

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:14.147 position:50% align:center
You wanna tell us
what's going on?

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.318 position:50% align:center
I'm blowin' off some steam,
or isn't it freaking obvious?

00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:19.944 position:50% align:center
Whatcha gonna do, huh?

00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:23.239 position:50% align:center
You wanna stop me, you better
be ready to kill or be killed!

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:24.657 position:50% align:center
He's really mad.

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:26.451 position:50% align:center
What should we do?

00:05:26.534 --> 00:05:28.578 position:50% align:center
It's been a while since
Dark Haru has been out

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:29.996 position:50% align:center
in full force like this.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.456 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU gasps]

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:33.291 position:50% align:center
You mean this is even worse
than the other times were?

00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:35.960 position:50% align:center
[KYO] You can't go around
doing this crap.

00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:37.295 position:50% align:center
When you go nuts,

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:39.172 position:50% align:center
it causes trouble for the
rest of us, you know?

00:05:39.255 --> 00:05:41.132 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Shut it, you stupid Cat.

00:05:41.216 --> 00:05:42.634 position:50% align:center
You cause trouble
for the rest of us

00:05:42.717 --> 00:05:44.469 position:50% align:center
just by standing there
and breathing.

00:05:44.552 --> 00:05:45.553 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:05:45.637 --> 00:05:49.182 position:50% align:center
Say that again.
Go on, I dare ya to.

00:05:49.265 --> 00:05:50.433 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Kyo, don't.

00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:52.185 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
He's baiting you, stupid Cat.

00:05:52.268 --> 00:05:55.563 position:50% align:center
Then do something! Just
standing there isn't helping!

00:05:55.647 --> 00:05:58.108 position:50% align:center
Haru, I don't know what's wrong,

00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:00.193 position:50% align:center
but school isn't
the place for this.

00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:03.446 position:50% align:center
Heh. Always the worry-wort,
Princess Yuki.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.533 position:50% align:center
Afraid I'll lose control and
accidentally transform?

00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:08.284 position:50% align:center
Then we'd all go down?

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:09.786 position:50% align:center
That's not it.

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:12.455 position:50% align:center
That's not what I'm trying to
say, at all. Now, please--

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:13.915 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
To hell with it!

00:06:13.998 --> 00:06:15.250 position:50% align:center
That's right. Screw it!

00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:17.627 position:50% align:center
I'm so sick of all this
tiptoeing around!

00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:19.379 position:50% align:center
Why should we have to hide?

00:06:19.462 --> 00:06:21.923 position:50% align:center
We should just tell everybody
the truth about us.

00:06:22.007 --> 00:06:23.049 position:50% align:center
It'd be a relief!

00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:23.800 position:50% align:center
Hatsuharu--

00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:24.801 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Right?

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:25.552 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:26.594 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:06:26.678 --> 00:06:28.847 position:50% align:center
You've thought about
it, haven't you?

00:06:33.685 --> 00:06:37.188 position:50% align:center
I don't care what the hell
you're so pissed off about.

00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:41.067 position:50% align:center
Keep throwing your stupid
tantrum if you need to,

00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:43.653 position:50% align:center
but leave Tohru out of it.

00:06:49.034 --> 00:06:53.079 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU] Look at you
acting all cool, kitty-cat.

00:06:53.163 --> 00:06:54.748 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
That's not what this is about.

00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:56.791 position:50% align:center
Sure it's not.

00:06:56.875 --> 00:06:58.835 position:50% align:center
You wanna look good
in front of her.

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:00.962 position:50% align:center
We all know what
you're doing here.

00:07:01.046 --> 00:07:02.380 position:50% align:center
Let's go then.

00:07:02.464 --> 00:07:04.966 position:50% align:center
You think you're tough enough
to take me down? Huh?

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.052 position:50% align:center
You wanna fight,
that's fine by me.

00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:10.472 position:50% align:center
Let's do this. I'll break
every bone in your body!

00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:12.724 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Please stop! Both of you!

00:07:14.476 --> 00:07:16.853 position:50% align:center
That's quite enough
of that, you idiots.

00:07:16.936 --> 00:07:17.520 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Oh?

00:07:17.604 --> 00:07:18.980 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow.

00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:21.858 position:50% align:center
Now calm down or I'm filling
this bucket back up again.

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:24.778 position:50% align:center
[KYO] He's the crazy one!
Why'd you splash me?

00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:28.281 position:50% align:center
You were one punch away
from going crazy yourself.

00:07:28.365 --> 00:07:30.909 position:50% align:center
Ahh... How refreshing.

00:07:30.992 --> 00:07:32.285 position:50% align:center
You whack job.

00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:33.870 position:50% align:center
Good to hear.

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:36.998 position:50% align:center
Now walk that refreshed self of
yours down to the faculty room.

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:44.422 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Will he be okay?
What do you think will happen?

00:07:44.506 --> 00:07:45.715 position:50% align:center
At the very least,

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:47.926 position:50% align:center
he'll get chewed out
for destroying that room.

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:48.927 position:50% align:center
He snapped.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.595 position:50% align:center
It must've taken
somethin' serious

00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:52.222 position:50% align:center
to make him go that Dark.

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:53.640 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Hmm.

00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:56.726 position:50% align:center
Well, I wasn't watching him
the whole time in class,

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.604 position:50% align:center
but I thought things
seemed pretty normal.

00:07:59.688 --> 00:08:01.356 position:50% align:center
Though, I get the feeling

00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:04.693 position:50% align:center
something might've
happened recently.

00:08:04.776 --> 00:08:07.946 position:50% align:center
He's just... been a little down.

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:08.905 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU, YUKI gasp]

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:11.241 position:50% align:center

Yeah, did you get yelled at?

[HATSUHARU grumbles]

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:19.708 position:50% align:center
And they called my mom.
She's gonna come and get me.

00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:24.004 position:50% align:center
Honda, I'm sorry for
getting so rough with you.

00:08:24.087 --> 00:08:24.796 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU gasps]

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:27.382 position:50% align:center
No, don't worry. I'm fine.

00:08:27.465 --> 00:08:29.968 position:50% align:center
Kyo. Nice fight.

00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:31.177 position:50% align:center
Weirdo.

00:08:31.261 --> 00:08:33.430 position:50% align:center
Okay. See ya.

00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:35.807 position:50% align:center
Where are you going, Haru?

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.642 position:50% align:center
Mom'll take forever.

00:08:37.726 --> 00:08:39.686 position:50% align:center
It'll be an hour before
she's got her makeup on

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:41.104 position:50% align:center
and whatever else.

00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:43.398 position:50% align:center
Gonna kill some time.

00:08:43.481 --> 00:08:45.316 position:50% align:center
Are-Are you sure?

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.403 position:50% align:center
Classic Haru, acting like
nothing even happened.

00:08:48.486 --> 00:08:51.072 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI] I'm not sure he
should be alone right now.

00:08:51.156 --> 00:08:53.116 position:50% align:center
I'll talk to him.

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:56.911 position:50% align:center
Miss Honda, please,
go home without me.

00:08:56.995 --> 00:08:57.662 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:08:57.746 --> 00:08:59.497 position:50% align:center
You heard him, let's go.

00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:02.917 position:50% align:center
Both of us, or I'll
be late to the dojo.

00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:05.587 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI] If anyone can get
through to him, it's Yuki.

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:07.130 position:50% align:center
He's our best bet.

00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:11.092 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I'm sure he is.

00:09:11.176 --> 00:09:13.053 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
But even so...

00:09:13.136 --> 00:09:16.348 position:50% align:center
Something might've happened.

00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:17.807 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I'm worried.

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:19.559 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
What were you thinking?

00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:21.102 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't go
anywhere near Haru

00:09:21.186 --> 00:09:22.645 position:50% align:center
when he turns Dark like that.

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:23.897 position:50% align:center
Why?

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.274 position:50% align:center
You can't be trusted not
to wind up getting hurt.

00:09:26.358 --> 00:09:28.360 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] It doesn't seem
very nice to avoid him,

00:09:28.443 --> 00:09:30.070 position:50% align:center
especially if he's
having a hard time.

00:09:30.153 --> 00:09:31.696 position:50% align:center
He wasn't being nice, either.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.114 position:50% align:center
Well, he was upset.

00:09:33.198 --> 00:09:34.199 position:50% align:center
[KYO grunts]

00:09:34.282 --> 00:09:36.493 position:50% align:center
Why do I bother?
You just don't get it.

00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:39.120 position:50% align:center
"I was worried about you!"

00:09:39.204 --> 00:09:42.040 position:50% align:center
Ha! That's what he's
trying to say, but can't!

00:09:42.123 --> 00:09:43.416 position:50% align:center
Huh...?

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.710 position:50% align:center
This isn't a joke! She needs
to understand, damn it!

00:09:45.794 --> 00:09:48.004 position:50% align:center
He's dangerous when he-- Uh.

00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:57.847 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Haru?

00:09:57.931 --> 00:10:00.058 position:50% align:center
What are you doing in here?

00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:04.104 position:50% align:center
Just cleaning up. At least,
that's why I came, anyway.

00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:06.356 position:50% align:center
But someone beat me to it.

00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:09.442 position:50% align:center
It's a mystery. Fairies, maybe?

00:10:09.526 --> 00:10:10.610 position:50% align:center
Who knows?

00:10:10.694 --> 00:10:11.945 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Uh.

00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:14.280 position:50% align:center
I think it was students
from your class, actually.

00:10:14.364 --> 00:10:16.616 position:50% align:center
Now, will you talk
to me? What's wrong?

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.993 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
You know...

00:10:19.077 --> 00:10:20.453 position:50% align:center
...you should call
her "Tohru," too.

00:10:20.537 --> 00:10:21.788 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:28.003 --> 00:10:31.047 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Stop it.
That's not the issue here.

00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:33.383 position:50% align:center
Forget about me, all right?

00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:37.804 position:50% align:center
My problems aren't what's
important right now.

00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:39.472 position:50% align:center
Yours are.

00:10:40.974 --> 00:10:45.228 position:50% align:center
Haru, you always put
other people first.

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:46.980 position:50% align:center
But what about you?

00:10:50.692 --> 00:10:54.237 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] He stays strong for
the people he cares about,

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.490 position:50% align:center
even when he's got problems
of his own to deal with.

00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:01.911 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
You're kind.

00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:06.041 position:50% align:center
Not me. I only ever
think about myself.

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:10.211 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I put all my energy
into containing the emotions

00:11:10.295 --> 00:11:12.547 position:50% align:center
I'm too scared to feel.

00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:16.593 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I'm a coward.

00:11:19.137 --> 00:11:22.307 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Hmm.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:25.435 position:50% align:center
So, you don't think about
anyone but yourself.

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:27.103 position:50% align:center
[YUKI gasps]

00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:28.646 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:32.359 position:50% align:center
Someone like that probably
wouldn't have come after me.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.570 position:50% align:center
Thanks for that.

00:11:37.739 --> 00:11:39.866 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU] You're wrong
about another thing.

00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:43.661 position:50% align:center
I can be pretty
self-absorbed, too.

00:11:43.745 --> 00:11:45.163 position:50% align:center
If I was thinking
about other people,

00:11:45.246 --> 00:11:48.625 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't turn Dark
and go ballistic in class.

00:11:52.003 --> 00:11:55.715 position:50% align:center
The thing is, I got dumped.

00:11:55.799 --> 00:11:56.716 position:50% align:center
By Rin.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.218 position:50% align:center
What?

00:11:59.177 --> 00:12:02.972 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU] When it first
happened, I just felt numb.

00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:07.268 position:50% align:center
But the more time went by,
the more pissed off I got.

00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:11.898 position:50% align:center
I was just thinking about it
earlier, and well, you saw.

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:16.236 position:50% align:center
I snapped. Lost it.

00:12:16.319 --> 00:12:18.863 position:50% align:center
And does Akito know?

00:12:18.947 --> 00:12:20.490 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
We kept it a secret.

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:23.118 position:50% align:center
Didn't tell anyone
we were dating.

00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:25.995 position:50% align:center
Sensei may have figured
something out.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:31.376 position:50% align:center
But other than that,
only you know.

00:12:31.459 --> 00:12:35.130 position:50% align:center
We're both in the zodiac, so...

00:12:35.213 --> 00:12:39.467 position:50% align:center
After she got hurt
so bad, she changed.

00:12:39.551 --> 00:12:41.052 position:50% align:center
I'd go to visit her
at the hospital

00:12:41.136 --> 00:12:43.805 position:50% align:center
only to find she'd run off.

00:12:43.888 --> 00:12:48.184 position:50% align:center
It was like, suddenly, I didn't
know who she was anymore.

00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:50.937 position:50% align:center
And then she dumped me.

00:12:51.021 --> 00:12:52.313 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
I don't need you.

00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:54.733 position:50% align:center
Or want you.

00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:58.153 position:50% align:center
Go. I'm sick of you.

00:13:00.071 --> 00:13:03.533 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Why'd she do it? Why?

00:13:05.535 --> 00:13:12.167 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU] Even now... I wanna
see her so bad it hurts.

00:13:13.543 --> 00:13:16.171 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU] She said she
wants me out of her life

00:13:16.254 --> 00:13:18.423 position:50% align:center
and I'm just supposed to go?

00:13:18.506 --> 00:13:22.177 position:50% align:center
I need her too much to
give up on her that easily.

00:13:24.512 --> 00:13:27.640 position:50% align:center
What will you do? What now?

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:31.644 position:50% align:center
Now, I get lectured
by my parents

00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:33.813 position:50% align:center
for going on a rampage
during class.

00:13:33.897 --> 00:13:36.274 position:50% align:center
That's not exactly what I meant.

00:13:36.358 --> 00:13:39.819 position:50% align:center
Yeah... I don't really know yet.

00:13:39.903 --> 00:13:41.279 position:50% align:center

Hey!

00:13:45.075 --> 00:13:48.453 position:50% align:center

got here quicker than I thought.

away from Dark Haru?

00:14:26.783 --> 00:14:28.118 position:50% align:center

very focused today.

We're going to be in Kyoto,

00:15:09.075 --> 00:15:11.453 position:50% align:center
so obviously,
boiled tofu is a must.

00:15:11.536 --> 00:15:15.540 position:50% align:center

that down for lunch then.

about the carbs, huh?

00:15:21.129 --> 00:15:22.005 position:50% align:center
So don't.

00:15:22.088 --> 00:15:23.131 position:50% align:center
Why don't we make the tofu

00:15:23.214 --> 00:15:24.883 position:50% align:center
an afternoon snack
instead of lunch.

All right, now you're thinkin'.

00:15:26.885 --> 00:15:28.053 position:50% align:center
We'll have to keep
it light, though,

00:15:28.136 --> 00:15:29.512 position:50% align:center
so we can get some
rice dumplings

00:15:29.596 --> 00:15:31.306 position:50% align:center
and maybe a dessert or two.

00:15:31.389 --> 00:15:32.766 position:50% align:center

Sure.

him out of school like that.

Mh-hm.

Fortunately, he
didn't hurt anybody.

Heh.

00:16:28.738 --> 00:16:30.281 position:50% align:center
It's not so bad, then.

00:16:30.365 --> 00:16:32.951 position:50% align:center
I'm sure he'll be back
before we know it.

00:16:36.788 --> 00:16:40.291 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] I know what I said,
but do you think he's okay?

00:16:41.251 --> 00:16:43.461 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing that
you mean Haru?

00:16:43.545 --> 00:16:44.629 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:16:44.713 --> 00:16:46.256 position:50% align:center
Earlier, when we were
talking to Momiji,

00:16:46.339 --> 00:16:48.967 position:50% align:center
he said Hatsuharu had
seemed sad lately.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:51.219 position:50% align:center
That maybe something
had happened.

00:16:57.642 --> 00:16:59.477 position:50% align:center
Is something the matter?

00:17:01.563 --> 00:17:05.734 position:50% align:center
It's just... I think I should
go see how Haru's doing.

00:17:05.817 --> 00:17:09.029 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Hm? You mean to the Soma estate?

00:17:10.238 --> 00:17:12.073 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Not my favorite place.

00:17:12.157 --> 00:17:13.491 position:50% align:center
Okay, then I can come with you--

00:17:13.575 --> 00:17:15.285 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
No.

00:17:15.368 --> 00:17:18.371 position:50% align:center
Today, I think
I should go alone.

00:17:20.331 --> 00:17:22.208 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
It's something I need to do.

00:17:22.292 --> 00:17:24.878 position:50% align:center
And not just for Haru's sake.

00:17:26.588 --> 00:17:28.048 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:17:28.131 --> 00:17:30.175 position:50% align:center
Will you let him know that I'm
thinking about him too, though?

00:17:30.258 --> 00:17:31.259 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Mh-hm.

00:17:31.343 --> 00:17:33.803 position:50% align:center
I should be home
in time for dinner.

00:17:39.434 --> 00:17:41.353 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I'm back. How was your day?

00:17:41.436 --> 00:17:44.230 position:50% align:center
Oh, the usual. Huh?

00:17:44.314 --> 00:17:47.025 position:50% align:center
What's this? No Yuki to
grace our humble abode?

00:17:47.108 --> 00:17:48.234 position:50% align:center
Not yet.

00:17:48.318 --> 00:17:50.820 position:50% align:center
Hatsuharu wasn't at
school earlier today,

00:17:50.904 --> 00:17:52.447 position:50% align:center
so Yuki went to check on him.

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:56.076 position:50% align:center
At the main estate?
He went willingly?

00:17:56.159 --> 00:17:57.118 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:17:57.202 --> 00:17:58.745 position:50% align:center
Well...

00:18:00.538 --> 00:18:02.290 position:50% align:center
How 'bout that?

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:09.422 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:19.808 position:50% align:center
[YUKI coughing]

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:25.480 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:28.483 --> 00:18:29.734 position:50% align:center
Rin!

00:18:51.923 --> 00:18:53.299 position:50% align:center
Gone. But where?

00:18:53.383 --> 00:18:56.970 position:50% align:center
[HEAD SERVANT]
Yuki! This is a surprise.

00:18:57.053 --> 00:18:59.472 position:50% align:center
It's been quite some time,

00:18:59.556 --> 00:19:02.392 position:50% align:center
but we're glad to
see you here at last.

00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:05.937 position:50% align:center
We thought surely you would join
us for the New Year's banquet,

00:19:06.021 --> 00:19:08.273 position:50% align:center
but you failed to do so.

00:19:08.356 --> 00:19:09.607 position:50% align:center
Such a shame.

00:19:09.691 --> 00:19:13.653 position:50% align:center
Akito was especially
distressed by your absence.

00:19:13.737 --> 00:19:16.031 position:50% align:center
You would do well to
return to Akito's side

00:19:16.114 --> 00:19:17.699 position:50% align:center
before you cause any
irreparable harm.

00:19:17.782 --> 00:19:19.200 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Sorry. Excuse me.

00:19:19.284 --> 00:19:21.369 position:50% align:center
There's someplace I need to be.

00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:29.252 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:19:29.336 --> 00:19:30.628 position:50% align:center
Come in.

00:19:30.712 --> 00:19:32.172 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
It's me.

00:19:33.673 --> 00:19:36.259 position:50% align:center
Whoa. There's a shock.

00:19:36.343 --> 00:19:39.346 position:50% align:center
Why is Yuki's doppelganger
here? It's a mystery.

00:19:39.429 --> 00:19:42.057 position:50% align:center
No. It's actually me.

00:19:43.058 --> 00:19:46.478 position:50% align:center
Peace. C'mon, you do it, too.

00:19:46.561 --> 00:19:48.396 position:50% align:center
What are we taking
a picture for?

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.274 position:50% align:center
A memento, since you haven't
been here in a long time.

00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:55.612 position:50% align:center
Thank you. Probably
wasn't very easy.

00:19:55.695 --> 00:19:58.740 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I thought you'd be
reflecting and repenting.

00:19:58.823 --> 00:20:01.785 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
I am reflecting and repenting.

00:20:01.868 --> 00:20:05.413 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Anyway, it seems
like you're doing okay.

00:20:05.497 --> 00:20:07.624 position:50% align:center
Not too bad.

00:20:07.707 --> 00:20:11.461 position:50% align:center
Although... I've been gaming
for five hours straight,

00:20:11.544 --> 00:20:12.962 position:50% align:center
so I'm a little tired.

00:20:13.046 --> 00:20:14.631 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I bet.

00:20:16.174 --> 00:20:17.842 position:50% align:center
Hey, Haru.

00:20:17.926 --> 00:20:19.135 position:50% align:center
I saw Rin just now.

00:20:19.219 --> 00:20:20.470 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:22.722 --> 00:20:27.310 position:50% align:center
So... she must've run
from the hospital again.

00:20:27.394 --> 00:20:30.689 position:50% align:center
Really, how are you?

00:20:30.772 --> 00:20:32.399 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Hmm.

00:20:33.942 --> 00:20:37.696 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU] I guess I'd
say... I'm determined.

00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:40.490 position:50% align:center
She can push me away,
but I won't give up.

00:20:40.573 --> 00:20:45.036 position:50% align:center
That girl doesn't know
how much I love her.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.914 position:50% align:center
I'll do whatever it takes
to get her back.

00:20:48.957 --> 00:20:53.253 position:50% align:center
All right, then.
In that case, good luck.

00:20:53.336 --> 00:20:54.796 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
You leaving?

00:20:54.879 --> 00:20:58.717 position:50% align:center
I came to cheer you up, but you
don't look like you need it.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.468 position:50% align:center
Well, good luck to you, too.

00:21:00.552 --> 00:21:03.388 position:50% align:center
With Honda, I mean.
And the whole name thing.

00:21:03.471 --> 00:21:05.765 position:50% align:center
Look, I just can't do it, Haru.

00:21:05.849 --> 00:21:07.392 position:50% align:center
Why not?

00:21:07.475 --> 00:21:08.727 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
It's hard to explain.

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:11.187 position:50% align:center
Will you let it go already?

00:21:11.271 --> 00:21:12.397 position:50% align:center
I get it.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.734 position:50% align:center
It's been too long and
now you're embarrassed.

00:21:15.817 --> 00:21:18.611 position:50% align:center
Maybe. So what if I am?

00:21:18.695 --> 00:21:21.197 position:50% align:center
Cute pouty face. Say, "peace."

00:21:21.281 --> 00:21:22.032 position:50% align:center
Stop it!

00:21:22.115 --> 00:21:23.450 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:21:26.161 --> 00:21:29.080 position:50% align:center
Bye. Stay outta trouble.

00:21:32.375 --> 00:21:35.795 position:50% align:center
[stomache growls]

00:21:35.879 --> 00:21:37.088 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:21:37.172 --> 00:21:39.299 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Tohru.

00:21:39.382 --> 00:21:40.884 position:50% align:center
Is dinner ready yet?

00:21:40.967 --> 00:21:42.260 position:50% align:center
Yes, I'm sorry.

00:21:42.344 --> 00:21:43.595 position:50% align:center
I was waiting for Yuki,

00:21:43.678 --> 00:21:46.348 position:50% align:center
but I can go ahead and get
yours ready if you want.

00:21:46.431 --> 00:21:48.224 position:50% align:center
Oh, I forgot.

00:21:48.308 --> 00:21:51.311 position:50% align:center
There was something important
I needed to tell Mit- <i>chan</i> !

00:21:51.394 --> 00:21:53.897 position:50% align:center
I'll shoot her an
email before I eat.

00:23:57.645 --> 00:24:00.231 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
"Wait for me, <i>tororo soba</i> !"
