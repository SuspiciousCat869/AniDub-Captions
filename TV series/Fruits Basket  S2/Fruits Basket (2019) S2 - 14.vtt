00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.848 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I don't have very
many memories of Rin

00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:16.349 position:50% align:center
from when we were younger.

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:18.601 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:21.604 position:50% align:center
[YULI] Other than the New Year's
banquets, I only saw her

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:24.607 position:50% align:center
when she tagged along
during Haru's visits.

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:26.943 position:50% align:center
She'd sit by herself in silence,

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:30.363 position:50% align:center
near the door on the
other side of the room.

00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:33.408 position:50% align:center
Then after a while,
she'd get up and say:

00:00:33.491 --> 00:00:36.453 position:50% align:center
It's time to go. I'm bored.

00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:41.374 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] It never seemed like she
actually wanted to be there.

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:43.835 position:50% align:center
I wondered why
she even bothered.

00:00:46.254 --> 00:00:47.714 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
But now...

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.391 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU gasps]

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:23.059 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Grandpa collapsed?

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:25.603 position:50% align:center
That's terrible! What happened?
Is he going to be okay?

00:02:25.687 --> 00:02:27.897 position:50% align:center
[AUNT]
Easy, Tohru. Calm down.

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:30.650 position:50% align:center
He'll be fine.
It's nothing too serious.

00:02:30.734 --> 00:02:32.152 position:50% align:center
He strained his
back, that's all.

00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:34.654 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Oh. So, then, he'll recover?

00:02:34.738 --> 00:02:37.782 position:50% align:center
Yes, of course. But he needs
to stay in bed for a bit.

00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:40.618 position:50% align:center
A strained back is no
laughing matter, dear.

00:02:40.702 --> 00:02:42.203 position:50% align:center
[AUNT]
Now, I think I heard something

00:02:42.287 --> 00:02:43.872 position:50% align:center
about a parent-teacher
conference?

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:46.958 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes. It's coming
up pretty soon.

00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:48.209 position:50% align:center
That's too bad.

00:02:48.293 --> 00:02:50.420 position:50% align:center
Your grandfather won't
be in any shape to go.

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:51.963 position:50% align:center
I guess I could go.

00:02:52.047 --> 00:02:54.966 position:50% align:center
No, it's fine! You don't need
to worry about that, really.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.177 position:50% align:center
But I would like
to come visit hi--

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.012 position:50% align:center
Yes, why, hello there.

00:02:59.095 --> 00:03:03.016 position:50% align:center
Tohru's aunt, I presume?
Shigure Soma at your service.

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:04.893 position:50% align:center
Yes. Yes, that's right...

00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:06.686 position:50% align:center
Um. Shigure?

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.564 position:50% align:center
Your grandpa, is he all right?

00:03:09.647 --> 00:03:10.815 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes.

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:13.068 position:50% align:center
He strained his back,
but he should be okay.

00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:13.943 position:50% align:center
That's a relief.

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:15.153 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Goodbye, now.

00:03:15.236 --> 00:03:16.363 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:17.781 position:50% align:center
You can't just hang up
on someone else's call!

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:19.032 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Hm?

00:03:19.115 --> 00:03:21.242 position:50% align:center
Everything's all set,
so what's left to say?

00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:22.577 position:50% align:center
Now, good news.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.038 position:50% align:center
Tohru, you can go visit
your grandfather tomorrow.

00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:25.997 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU gasps]

00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:27.082 position:50% align:center
Okay, thanks.

00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:29.292 position:50% align:center
As for the
parent-teacher conference,

00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:31.544 position:50% align:center
I shall be playing
the role of guardian.

00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:33.046 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.425 position:50% align:center
You. Huh. Right, because what
could go wrong with that?

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:40.929 position:50% align:center
Wait, what? But I thought
it was a brilliant idea.

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:42.305 position:50% align:center
You don't want me to come?

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.182 position:50% align:center
No! I mean, I never
would've asked you to go

00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:45.517 position:50% align:center
to so much trouble just for me.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.560 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you're way too
busy to come up to school

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:48.812 position:50% align:center
for something like this.

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:50.105 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
It's no trouble.

00:03:50.188 --> 00:03:52.399 position:50% align:center
Don't worry your
pretty head about it.

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:53.817 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
No trouble at all.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.527 position:50% align:center
Not when it means
getting to see that look

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.946 position:50% align:center
of pure loathing on Mayu's face.

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:00.156 position:50% align:center
I can't wait!

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.658 position:50% align:center
Well, anyway.

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:03.493 position:50% align:center
Your aunt and I decided that
this would be for the best.

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:04.869 position:50% align:center
No, you decided.

00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:08.164 position:50% align:center
So, what do you think of our
little plan? Sound good?

00:04:09.833 --> 00:04:11.376 position:50% align:center
Yes, it sounds
wonderful! Thank you!

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.420 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] He may be the
last person who deserves

00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:16.339 position:50% align:center
to have Miss Honda
bowing to him.

00:04:16.423 --> 00:04:17.507 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU gasps]

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.843 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] There you are,
Kyo. Welcome home!

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:22.846 position:50% align:center
Huh? What's up with the group
meeting in the hallway?

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:25.015 position:50% align:center
Talking about
parent-teacher conferences.

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:26.182 position:50% align:center
They're coming up soon,

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:28.059 position:50% align:center
but Tohru's grandfather
strained his back.

00:04:28.143 --> 00:04:29.769 position:50% align:center
Shigure volunteered
to go to mine

00:04:29.853 --> 00:04:31.646 position:50% align:center
since Grandpa can't make it.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.482 position:50% align:center
Only if you're really sure
you don't mind going, though.

00:04:34.566 --> 00:04:36.401 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] I wouldn't
miss it for the world.

00:04:36.484 --> 00:04:38.194 position:50% align:center
After all, what could
be more important

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:40.238 position:50% align:center
than a meeting
about your future?

00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:41.948 position:50% align:center
Well, night.

00:04:42.032 --> 00:04:45.035 position:50% align:center
Oh. Okay. Night.

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:47.787 position:50% align:center
I guess we'll see you
in the morning, then.

00:04:48.747 --> 00:04:50.248 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Yuki.

00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:51.416 position:50% align:center
So what about you?

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:53.418 position:50% align:center
Have you talked to
your parents about it?

00:04:53.501 --> 00:04:55.253 position:50% align:center
The conference, I mean.

00:04:56.921 --> 00:04:59.341 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I still have
problems to deal with.

00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:01.384 position:50% align:center
Questions to answer.

00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:06.348 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I need to get to work.

00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:10.393 position:50% align:center
To figure out exactly
where I stand,

00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:13.021 position:50% align:center
and where I go from here.

00:05:13.104 --> 00:05:15.648 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI] Oh, no!
Your <i>Opa</i> injured his back?

00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:17.650 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry to hear that.

00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:19.944 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU] A man's back
is everything to him.

00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:21.488 position:50% align:center
Uh! Wow! Is that true?

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:23.031 position:50% align:center
Just ignore him.

00:05:23.114 --> 00:05:25.617 position:50% align:center
Half of what comes out of Haru's
mouth is complete nonsense.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.577 position:50% align:center
Hey, Honda, where's Kyo?

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.913 position:50% align:center
Uh, I'm not sure exactly.

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:32.207 position:50% align:center
But up on the roof
would be my guess.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.334 position:50% align:center
He's seemed pretty down lately,

00:05:34.417 --> 00:05:36.878 position:50% align:center
and that's where
he goes to escape.

00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:38.463 position:50% align:center
Got a case of the man blues?

00:05:38.546 --> 00:05:40.423 position:50% align:center
Haru.

00:05:40.507 --> 00:05:42.175 position:50% align:center
Kyo's down, but
that doesn't mean

00:05:42.258 --> 00:05:44.552 position:50% align:center
that you have to
be sad, too, right?

00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:46.346 position:50% align:center
So come on. Let's get a drink!

00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:47.681 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:05:47.764 --> 00:05:49.224 position:50% align:center
You come, too!

00:05:49.307 --> 00:05:51.226 position:50% align:center
Okay, coming.

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:54.354 position:50% align:center
Momiji is a walking
air purifier.

00:05:54.437 --> 00:05:58.566 position:50% align:center
Haru, how are things
with Rin? Any progress?

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.695 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Nope. None at all.

00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:03.113 position:50% align:center
Why?

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:06.408 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Well, it's just...
Rin seems pretty stubborn,

00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:09.202 position:50% align:center
but I thought, maybe,
with enough time...

00:06:09.285 --> 00:06:11.663 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Yeah. I get it.

00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:16.042 position:50% align:center
But honestly, I'm starting to
think she really meant it.

00:06:16.126 --> 00:06:17.460 position:50% align:center
What she said.

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:21.089 position:50% align:center
For the longest time,
I didn't want to, but, well...

00:06:21.172 --> 00:06:24.467 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
I don't need you. Or want you.

00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:27.595 position:50% align:center
Go. I'm sick of you.

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:29.931 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Rin has a sharp tongue.

00:06:30.015 --> 00:06:32.308 position:50% align:center
She doesn't sugarcoat things.

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:38.690 position:50% align:center
But she also doesn't say
stuff to protect herself.

00:06:38.773 --> 00:06:41.484 position:50% align:center
I don't know what
to think anymore.

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:44.988 position:50% align:center
Is that how she feels? Maybe.

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:47.032 position:50% align:center
Or maybe I'm just scared.

00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:51.453 position:50% align:center
Whatever it is, it hurts.

00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:53.121 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:06:53.204 --> 00:06:54.664 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Machi.

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:58.835 position:50% align:center
See you at our
next meeting. Okay?

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:00.962 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
Yeah.

00:07:01.046 --> 00:07:04.632 position:50% align:center
The treasurer? That her?
She's in my class.

00:07:04.716 --> 00:07:07.135 position:50% align:center
Oh, I didn't know that.

00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:09.596 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
So, how is student council?

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:13.141 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] What can I say?
Lots of unknowns.

00:07:13.224 --> 00:07:15.435 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
I think that's good for you.

00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:16.978 position:50% align:center
The unknown.

00:07:17.062 --> 00:07:19.272 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Yuki! Haru!

00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:21.024 position:50% align:center
You coming or not?

00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:23.693 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Uh, yeah.

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:27.864 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] We all have things
to deal with. Not just me.

00:07:36.998 --> 00:07:39.501 position:50% align:center
[MAID A] Oh. This is
quite a surprise, Yuki.

00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:41.169 position:50% align:center
So nice to see you.

00:07:41.252 --> 00:07:43.004 position:50% align:center
I wish we had known
that you were coming.

00:07:43.088 --> 00:07:44.589 position:50% align:center
I'm sure your mother
would've stayed home

00:07:44.673 --> 00:07:46.299 position:50% align:center
if she'd expected you.

00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:49.177 position:50% align:center
She won't be back until
evening, I'm afraid.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.013 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Convincing myself
to come here wasn't easy,

00:07:52.097 --> 00:07:55.058 position:50% align:center
and of course she's
out, as usual.

00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:58.561 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Here. Please make
sure that she gets this.

00:07:58.645 --> 00:07:59.979 position:50% align:center
Thanks a lot.

00:08:00.063 --> 00:08:03.358 position:50% align:center
Oh, but... you're welcome
to wait for her to return.

00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:09.989 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA]
Yun- <i>chan</i> !

00:08:10.073 --> 00:08:12.534 position:50% align:center
Now that's a shock.
You never come here.

00:08:12.617 --> 00:08:15.286 position:50% align:center
You heading home? How was class?

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.497 position:50% align:center
No clue. I ditched today.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.416 position:50% align:center
I was just out on a walk.

00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:20.792 position:50% align:center
Good timing, then.

00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:23.628 position:50% align:center
Can I ask, is Rin still
living at your place?

00:08:23.712 --> 00:08:24.879 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA]
Mh-hm!

00:08:24.963 --> 00:08:26.631 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
You think I could see her?

00:08:26.715 --> 00:08:27.507 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA]
Hmm.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.342 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure about that.

00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:32.387 position:50% align:center
She doesn't even bother to
come home a lot of the time.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.097 position:50% align:center
Doesn't go to school
much either.

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.224 position:50% align:center
Who knows what she's up to?

00:08:36.307 --> 00:08:37.726 position:50% align:center
Too bad.

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:39.269 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA]
Why do you wanna see her?

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:41.479 position:50% align:center
I didn't think the two
of you were close.

00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:44.441 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I just wanted to
talk to her, that's all.

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:49.195 position:50% align:center
Hey, by the way, did something
happen between you and Kyo?

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:50.739 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA]
Why do you ask?

00:08:50.822 --> 00:08:56.119 position:50% align:center
He's been a little down lately,
since you two met up.

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:59.497 position:50% align:center
Kind of distant, I guess.

00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:02.625 position:50% align:center
To everyone? Tohru, too?

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:04.085 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:09.591 position:50% align:center
Hm? Hey, dinner's ready.

00:09:09.674 --> 00:09:11.176 position:50% align:center
There's plenty. Want some?

00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:12.302 position:50% align:center
Not hungry.

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:15.472 position:50% align:center
Oh. 'Kay.

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:19.768 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA] Whoa. That's pretty
cold, even for him.

00:09:19.851 --> 00:09:21.394 position:50% align:center
It only makes things worse.

00:09:21.478 --> 00:09:24.647 position:50% align:center
I mean, I've already got a
broken heart to deal with, here.

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:26.733 position:50% align:center
Now I feel guilty, too.

00:09:26.816 --> 00:09:29.694 position:50% align:center
Like the way Kyo's been
acting is my fault.

00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:33.114 position:50% align:center
It's fine, though.
Yeah, I'll be fine.

00:09:33.198 --> 00:09:36.951 position:50% align:center
There's no logic involved
when it comes to love.

00:09:37.035 --> 00:09:39.204 position:50% align:center
Doesn't matter what
your brain says.

00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:43.833 position:50% align:center
Once your heart latches onto
someone, then it's too late.

00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:46.294 position:50% align:center
They're all you can think about.

00:09:49.172 --> 00:09:53.134 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Such devotion to someone.

00:09:53.218 --> 00:09:55.303 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Um.

00:09:57.222 --> 00:10:01.434 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
The truth is, I envy you.

00:10:01.518 --> 00:10:02.977 position:50% align:center
You're so sure.

00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:06.523 position:50% align:center
So completely certain
of what you feel.

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:10.110 position:50% align:center
You don't waver or
hesitate like I do.

00:10:10.193 --> 00:10:15.156 position:50% align:center
Heartbroken and alone,
yet, you still...

00:10:16.741 --> 00:10:18.243 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:22.580 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Rin!

00:10:22.664 --> 00:10:24.958 position:50% align:center
Rin! Hold on!

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:26.376 position:50% align:center
Stop!

00:10:27.669 --> 00:10:31.881 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Rin, what's going on?
Why are you here?

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:35.051 position:50% align:center
Please, wait! I just
wanna talk to you!

00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:43.184 position:50% align:center
Rin, were you serious
when you dumped Haru?

00:10:43.268 --> 00:10:47.897 position:50% align:center
He told me about it. Your
relationship and the break-up.

00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:52.777 position:50% align:center
That got me thinking,
and I remembered something.

00:10:52.861 --> 00:10:55.155 position:50% align:center
Back when I was still
trapped in that room,

00:10:55.238 --> 00:10:58.408 position:50% align:center
you and Haru used to
come visit me sometimes.

00:10:59.868 --> 00:11:03.872 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] You would abruptly
leave and take Haru with you.

00:11:03.955 --> 00:11:07.292 position:50% align:center
It took me a while,
but I finally realized.

00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:09.919 position:50% align:center
Every time, not long
after you left,

00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:12.464 position:50% align:center
someone would come
to check on me.

00:11:13.923 --> 00:11:17.427 position:50% align:center
Visitors? Akito would've
forbidden them.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:20.180 position:50% align:center
I was isolated for a reason.

00:11:20.263 --> 00:11:23.725 position:50% align:center
But even so, Haru came.

00:11:23.808 --> 00:11:28.188 position:50% align:center
And you. You were
protecting him.

00:11:28.271 --> 00:11:29.606 position:50% align:center
You kept watch,

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:34.444 position:50% align:center
sat by the door so you'd
know if anyone was coming.

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:37.781 position:50% align:center
That way, you could keep
Haru out of trouble.

00:11:37.864 --> 00:11:40.742 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU] But she also
wouldn't ever say anything

00:11:40.825 --> 00:11:42.994 position:50% align:center
just to protect herself.

00:11:44.204 --> 00:11:47.999 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] At the time,
I didn't understand.

00:11:48.083 --> 00:11:51.419 position:50% align:center
But I see it now.
You're doing it again.

00:11:51.503 --> 00:11:55.548 position:50% align:center
You broke up with Haru to
protect him, didn't you?

00:11:55.632 --> 00:11:57.842 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU] This is what you
wanted to talk about?

00:11:57.926 --> 00:11:59.427 position:50% align:center
How ridiculous.

00:11:59.511 --> 00:12:02.931 position:50% align:center
Like I'd remember that,
something so long ago.

00:12:03.014 --> 00:12:06.142 position:50% align:center
And I really don't care
what happens to Haru.

00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:08.019 position:50% align:center
I'm sick of all your questions.

00:12:08.103 --> 00:12:10.438 position:50% align:center
I told you to mind
your damn business.

00:12:10.522 --> 00:12:12.899 position:50% align:center
And besides, even if
I did talk to you,

00:12:12.982 --> 00:12:14.901 position:50% align:center
what good would that do me?

00:12:14.984 --> 00:12:17.612 position:50% align:center
You're just an ignorant idiot.

00:12:17.696 --> 00:12:19.906 position:50% align:center
Yuki, Gure came one day

00:12:19.989 --> 00:12:21.741 position:50% align:center
and asked if you wanted
to go live with him.

00:12:21.825 --> 00:12:23.410 position:50% align:center
Do you know why?

00:12:23.493 --> 00:12:25.578 position:50% align:center
He did it because of Haru.

00:12:25.662 --> 00:12:27.747 position:50% align:center
He begged Gure to get
you out of there.

00:12:27.831 --> 00:12:30.458 position:50% align:center
Begged him to save you.

00:12:30.542 --> 00:12:33.253 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] Yuki, want
to come live with me?

00:12:33.336 --> 00:12:34.504 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Gure said sure,

00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:36.715 position:50% align:center
but only if he'd start
calling him "Sensei."

00:12:36.798 --> 00:12:39.884 position:50% align:center
He was just joking, but Haru,
like the moron he is,

00:12:39.968 --> 00:12:42.470 position:50% align:center
still calls him that.

00:12:42.554 --> 00:12:44.139 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Should work out well, huh?

00:12:44.222 --> 00:12:45.432 position:50% align:center
You living at Sensei's.

00:12:45.515 --> 00:12:46.975 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess.

00:12:47.058 --> 00:12:51.146 position:50% align:center
But hold on, have you always
referred to Shigure as Sensei?

00:12:51.229 --> 00:12:52.439 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Yep.

00:12:52.522 --> 00:12:55.900 position:50% align:center
'Cause Sensei is a <i>sensei</i> .

00:12:55.984 --> 00:12:59.320 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU] But you, you're an even
bigger moron than Haru is.

00:12:59.404 --> 00:13:01.990 position:50% align:center
You should just go and enjoy
your carefree schoolboy life

00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:04.284 position:50% align:center
or whatever, like
the idiot you are.

00:13:04.367 --> 00:13:06.995 position:50% align:center
Don't bother me again, shithead!

00:13:07.078 --> 00:13:10.123 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Calling someone a shithead?

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:12.584 position:50% align:center
That really isn't very nice.

00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:15.295 position:50% align:center
Hi, Rin.

00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:32.354 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Haru.

00:13:32.437 --> 00:13:34.939 position:50% align:center
Why are you here?

00:13:35.023 --> 00:13:37.942 position:50% align:center
I came over to hang
out at Sensei's.

00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:39.277 position:50% align:center
Here, you dropped your bag.

00:13:39.361 --> 00:13:43.490 position:50% align:center
Oh. Thank you.

00:13:43.573 --> 00:13:44.491 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:44.574 --> 00:13:46.534 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Don't touch me.

00:13:46.618 --> 00:13:48.536 position:50% align:center
Don't come near me.

00:13:51.414 --> 00:13:54.876 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
So... you really don't need me.

00:13:56.586 --> 00:14:00.215 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU] I guess that's that,
whether I like it or not.

00:14:00.298 --> 00:14:03.593 position:50% align:center
Well, I might as well die, then.

00:14:03.677 --> 00:14:05.303 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:31.121 position:50% align:center
That part about me
dying, it was a joke.

00:14:32.372 --> 00:14:38.336 position:50% align:center
Rin, please, can you tell
me what I'm missing, here?

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:41.006 position:50% align:center
I thought I understood
everything about you.

00:14:41.089 --> 00:14:45.093 position:50% align:center
But that voice, the silent
one that matters most,

00:14:45.176 --> 00:14:47.804 position:50% align:center
did I not hear it?

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:50.473 position:50% align:center
Are you still like
you were back then?

00:14:50.557 --> 00:14:55.186 position:50% align:center
Unable to stand on your own?

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:56.604 position:50% align:center
[slap]

00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:04.738 position:50% align:center
Uh. Rin!

00:15:07.699 --> 00:15:11.911 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU] Those tears,
did I misunderstand?

00:15:11.995 --> 00:15:13.288 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Haru?

00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:15.582 position:50% align:center
Should you go after her?

00:15:15.665 --> 00:15:17.083 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU grunts]

00:15:17.167 --> 00:15:20.128 position:50% align:center
There's no way I can catch up
if she's going all out.

00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:21.880 position:50% align:center
The whole Horse thing.

00:15:21.963 --> 00:15:24.341 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] You seem pretty
relaxed about this.

00:15:24.424 --> 00:15:27.302 position:50% align:center
No, I wouldn't say that.

00:15:27.385 --> 00:15:30.638 position:50% align:center
I realized something,
that's all.

00:15:30.722 --> 00:15:34.517 position:50% align:center
By the way, sorry you fell
victim to Rin's sharp tongue.

00:15:34.601 --> 00:15:37.562 position:50% align:center
Her sharp tongue? Uh.

00:15:37.645 --> 00:15:40.815 position:50% align:center
It's okay. Maybe I deserved it.

00:15:40.899 --> 00:15:42.984 position:50% align:center
Do you know why?

00:15:43.068 --> 00:15:44.819 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Yuki.

00:15:44.903 --> 00:15:46.780 position:50% align:center
I'm the one who needs to
get it together right now

00:15:46.863 --> 00:15:48.782 position:50% align:center
and take care of Rin.

00:15:48.865 --> 00:15:52.118 position:50% align:center
You don't have to
worry about her.

00:15:52.202 --> 00:15:53.661 position:50% align:center
Leave her to me.

00:15:53.745 --> 00:15:57.707 position:50% align:center
You've got your own stuff to
deal with. Like student council.

00:15:57.791 --> 00:16:00.043 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you're doing
that, by the way.

00:16:00.126 --> 00:16:01.795 position:50% align:center
Trying out new things.

00:16:01.878 --> 00:16:05.840 position:50% align:center
I think it's good for
you. Really good.

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.386 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Do you?

00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:11.137 position:50% align:center
You think it's all right?

00:16:11.221 --> 00:16:15.642 position:50% align:center
You think it's a good thing,
me always putting myself first?

00:16:16.893 --> 00:16:18.478 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Not that, maybe,

00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:20.855 position:50% align:center
I should think of someone
else for a change?

00:16:20.939 --> 00:16:22.899 position:50% align:center
He did it because of Haru.

00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:25.151 position:50% align:center
He begged Gure to get
you out of there.

00:16:25.235 --> 00:16:27.654 position:50% align:center
Begged him to save you.

00:16:30.073 --> 00:16:32.742 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I can't even stand on my own.

00:16:32.826 --> 00:16:35.745 position:50% align:center
I always have to lean
on other people.

00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:38.206 position:50% align:center
But you want me to
put myself first,

00:16:38.289 --> 00:16:41.376 position:50% align:center
even though I've given
nothing back yet?

00:16:42.377 --> 00:16:44.879 position:50% align:center
You think too much.

00:16:44.963 --> 00:16:49.134 position:50% align:center
Yuki, you're fragile.

00:16:49.217 --> 00:16:53.555 position:50% align:center
Yuki, you're kind.

00:16:53.638 --> 00:16:57.642 position:50% align:center
[AYAME] I think you and I
are foils of one another.

00:16:57.726 --> 00:17:02.605 position:50% align:center
Your kindness and your fragility
are things I cherish.

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:04.149 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Quit stalling.

00:17:04.232 --> 00:17:05.775 position:50% align:center
Go take a risk

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:08.486 position:50% align:center
and find the place where
you really wanna be.

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:10.947 position:50% align:center
It's out there.

00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:14.701 position:50% align:center
You're too nice, you know that?

00:17:14.784 --> 00:17:16.369 position:50% align:center
To me, anyway.

00:17:16.453 --> 00:17:17.662 position:50% align:center
Well, maybe,

00:17:17.746 --> 00:17:20.915 position:50% align:center
you and I were long-lost
sisters in a past life.

00:17:20.999 --> 00:17:24.919 position:50% align:center
Uh. Hah. You're so weird, Haru.

00:17:25.003 --> 00:17:26.921 position:50% align:center
[YUKI chuckles]

00:17:27.005 --> 00:17:29.382 position:50% align:center
There's somebody
waiting out there

00:17:29.466 --> 00:17:34.929 position:50% align:center
who'll see this side of you
and know how special it is.

00:17:35.013 --> 00:17:37.891 position:50% align:center
It won't be long now.

00:17:37.974 --> 00:17:41.686 position:50% align:center
Just keep fighting. Okay?

00:17:44.856 --> 00:17:47.067 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I can't stand on my own.

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:51.446 position:50% align:center
My strength alone won't be
enough to keep me going.

00:17:51.529 --> 00:17:56.659 position:50% align:center
No. I can't move forward,
not by myself.

00:17:57.702 --> 00:17:58.953 position:50% align:center
[GRANDFATHER grunts]

00:17:59.037 --> 00:18:01.539 position:50% align:center
[GRANDFATHER] You came all
this way just to see me?

00:18:01.623 --> 00:18:05.293 position:50% align:center
That brightens my whole day.
Thank you, dear.

00:18:05.377 --> 00:18:08.505 position:50% align:center
Did things get sorted out with
the parent-teacher conference?

00:18:08.588 --> 00:18:10.882 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Yes, it's all taken care of.

00:18:10.965 --> 00:18:13.551 position:50% align:center
But what about you?
How are you feeling?

00:18:13.635 --> 00:18:15.303 position:50% align:center
I'm doing well enough.

00:18:15.387 --> 00:18:19.057 position:50% align:center
Other than my back,
I'm as spirited as ever.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:22.185 position:50% align:center
But all this lying around,
it's driving me nuts.

00:18:22.268 --> 00:18:24.312 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU chuckles]

00:18:24.396 --> 00:18:26.731 position:50% align:center
I had a dream last night.

00:18:26.815 --> 00:18:30.985 position:50% align:center
The first I've dreamt of Katsuya
and Kyoko in a long time.

00:18:31.069 --> 00:18:33.488 position:50% align:center
It brought back memories.

00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:35.615 position:50% align:center
Katsuya and I, well,

00:18:35.699 --> 00:18:39.119 position:50% align:center
we didn't get along when
he was younger, you see.

00:18:39.202 --> 00:18:40.870 position:50% align:center
Then Kyoko came into our lives

00:18:40.954 --> 00:18:44.457 position:50% align:center
and she somehow managed to
bridge the distance between us.

00:18:44.541 --> 00:18:45.959 position:50% align:center
I worried some at first.

00:18:46.042 --> 00:18:48.753 position:50% align:center
Katsuya had always been
such a quirky boy.

00:18:48.837 --> 00:18:50.296 position:50% align:center
What if it was too
much for Kyoko

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:53.758 position:50% align:center
and they couldn't make
their relationship last?

00:18:53.842 --> 00:18:58.513 position:50% align:center
But they turned out to be
so happy with each other.

00:18:58.596 --> 00:19:00.932 position:50% align:center
Why did we have to lose them?

00:19:01.016 --> 00:19:04.769 position:50% align:center
I wish I could see
them again, just once.

00:19:04.853 --> 00:19:08.606 position:50% align:center
Their smiling faces.
Their shining love.

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:13.028 position:50% align:center
Even if they're ghosts now,
I want to see them.

00:19:13.111 --> 00:19:17.532 position:50% align:center
I want to... go see them.

00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:19.367 position:50% align:center
Please don't say--

00:19:28.251 --> 00:19:30.462 position:50% align:center
I wanna go see him.

00:19:31.463 --> 00:19:34.591 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Please, Mommy, don't say that.

00:19:35.717 --> 00:19:37.594 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
How can I help?

00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:41.848 position:50% align:center
I'll do anything.
Anything you want.

00:19:41.931 --> 00:19:46.019 position:50% align:center
Don't go. Come back.

00:19:46.102 --> 00:19:47.729 position:50% align:center
Not Mommy, too.

00:19:47.812 --> 00:19:49.898 position:50% align:center
Don't take her with you.

00:19:49.981 --> 00:19:51.608 position:50% align:center
I need her!

00:19:53.777 --> 00:19:55.028 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:57.030 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:57.113 --> 00:20:00.575 position:50% align:center
You're pale. Think
you're getting sick?

00:20:02.786 --> 00:20:03.787 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Tohru?

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:06.873 position:50% align:center
Come on. Talk to me.

00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:11.878 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I'm fine, really.

00:20:11.961 --> 00:20:19.302 position:50% align:center
A memory from a long time ago
came back to me, and I just...

00:20:19.386 --> 00:20:22.097 position:50% align:center
I thought the lid was shut.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:24.808 position:50% align:center
You just appeared, so suddenly.

00:20:24.891 --> 00:20:27.060 position:50% align:center
Almost like you came
from the heavens.

00:20:27.143 --> 00:20:30.105 position:50% align:center
Huh? You say the weirdest
stuff sometimes.

00:20:30.188 --> 00:20:31.856 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:34.150 position:50% align:center
It makes sense you're
a little off.

00:20:34.234 --> 00:20:38.405 position:50% align:center
It's normal to get upset when
a family member's not well.

00:20:38.488 --> 00:20:40.031 position:50% align:center
Now, let's go home.

00:20:40.115 --> 00:20:41.574 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Hm?

00:20:41.658 --> 00:20:45.537 position:50% align:center
But, um, it looked like you were
on your way somewhere, Kyo.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:50.208 position:50% align:center
Hurry up. You plan on sitting
there forever, or what?

00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:52.043 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU yelps]

00:20:52.127 --> 00:20:54.254 position:50% align:center
Man, you're skinny.

00:20:54.337 --> 00:20:55.964 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Uh.

00:20:56.047 --> 00:20:57.882 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Not to mention puny.

00:20:57.966 --> 00:20:59.426 position:50% align:center
Uh! No, I'm not!

00:20:59.509 --> 00:21:03.972 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me, you shooting
for 5'11" like Uotani is?

00:21:04.055 --> 00:21:07.225 position:50% align:center
Seriously, what's she wanna
get that tall for, anyway?

00:21:07.308 --> 00:21:08.852 position:50% align:center
To become a model or something?

00:21:08.935 --> 00:21:13.440 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Ha. Uo- <i>chan</i> , a model?
That would be so cool!

00:21:15.066 --> 00:21:16.401 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Sensei?

00:21:16.484 --> 00:21:18.528 position:50% align:center
Rin stopped by earlier, huh?

00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:19.904 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Hm?

00:21:19.988 --> 00:21:23.867 position:50% align:center
Huh. Dunno, maybe.
So what if she did?

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:25.452 position:50% align:center
If you tried giving
straight answers,

00:21:25.535 --> 00:21:27.495 position:50% align:center
it might score you
a few friends.

00:21:27.579 --> 00:21:28.538 position:50% align:center
Even a date.

00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:29.456 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE laughs]

00:21:29.539 --> 00:21:31.541 position:50% align:center
Well played, sir.

00:21:31.624 --> 00:21:34.127 position:50% align:center
Ah, to be young like
you people again.

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:37.589 position:50% align:center
Clumsily making your
way through life.

00:21:37.672 --> 00:21:40.550 position:50% align:center
Struggling so hard to keep
your head above water,

00:21:40.633 --> 00:21:43.845 position:50% align:center
even though you'd float
if you just relaxed.

00:21:43.928 --> 00:21:45.472 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Except you only figure that out

00:21:45.555 --> 00:21:49.934 position:50% align:center
by struggling so long and so
hard you can't fight anymore.

00:21:51.102 --> 00:21:52.729 position:50% align:center
I like that.

00:21:52.812 --> 00:21:56.691 position:50% align:center
Then, go forth and
struggle, Haru.

00:21:56.775 --> 00:21:59.736 position:50% align:center
Why not interrogate
her instead of me?

00:21:59.819 --> 00:22:01.988 position:50% align:center
I'm not your ex-girlfriend.

00:22:02.072 --> 00:22:03.990 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
She make you swear not to tell?

00:22:04.074 --> 00:22:07.243 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] I keep my promises,
at least to a certain extent.

00:22:07.327 --> 00:22:09.704 position:50% align:center
Will you tell me if I
start calling you "honey"?

00:22:09.788 --> 00:22:10.747 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE laughs]

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:13.792 position:50% align:center
That's a no. Neither
of us want that.

00:22:13.875 --> 00:22:17.337 position:50% align:center
You were right before.
It's not time to float yet.

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:20.840 position:50% align:center
Keep struggling,
for all that you're worth.

00:22:20.924 --> 00:22:22.926 position:50% align:center
Isn't that your job, after all?

00:22:23.009 --> 00:22:25.804 position:50% align:center
Young people were
meant to fight.

00:23:57.645 --> 00:23:59.230 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
"See you later."
