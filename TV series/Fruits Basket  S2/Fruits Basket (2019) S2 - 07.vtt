00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.516 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I want to believe that
I wasn't deluding myself.

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:18.560 position:50% align:center
And that there's
more to this world

00:00:18.643 --> 00:00:22.564 position:50% align:center
than the darkness I've seen.

00:00:22.647 --> 00:00:27.610 position:50% align:center
Just like the heaviest rain
will be chased away by the sun.

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.992 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Pain, and the fear of pain...

00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:38.329 position:50% align:center
...may one day be
overcome by kindness.

00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:45.587 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I've held onto
that since that day.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.223 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Huh?

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:22.392 position:50% align:center
Slow down. You sure?

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:23.977 position:50% align:center
You know that you have
a bad tendency

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.146 position:50% align:center
to misunderstand things.

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:28.148 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Okay, then.

00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:30.984 position:50% align:center
Well, don't trip or anything.

00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:33.361 position:50% align:center
What was that?
Is something wrong?

00:02:33.445 --> 00:02:37.782 position:50% align:center
No. Turns out,
my mom's pregnant.

00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:39.200 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?!

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:41.453 position:50% align:center
She went to the doctor
thinking she had a cold.

00:02:41.536 --> 00:02:43.913 position:50% align:center
And apparently it was
something else entirely.

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:47.083 position:50% align:center
Congratulations! You need to
start thinking about names.

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:48.585 position:50% align:center
Maybe the baby will
take after you,

00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:51.046 position:50% align:center
and then we'll have another
little Hiro running around!

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:52.130 position:50% align:center
Okay, stop.

00:02:52.213 --> 00:02:53.965 position:50% align:center
You're making it
sound like I'm the one

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:55.550 position:50% align:center
who's going to have a baby.

00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:57.218 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Congrats.

00:02:57.302 --> 00:03:00.138 position:50% align:center
Ah, Satsuki.
She's still so young.

00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:01.723 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Don't talk about
my mom like that!

00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:03.850 position:50% align:center
It's downright disturbing! Hmph!

00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:06.853 position:50% align:center
Hi, Uncle Shigure. I didn't
know that you were here.

00:03:06.936 --> 00:03:09.147 position:50% align:center
Well, better late than
never, as they say.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.523 position:50% align:center
Aren't you going to swim?

00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:11.775 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Hmm.

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:14.903 position:50% align:center
I confess, I'm not the
world's best swimmer.

00:03:14.986 --> 00:03:16.905 position:50% align:center
So you just like the sun?

00:03:16.988 --> 00:03:20.867 position:50% align:center
It's more that I like...
all the swimsuits.

00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:23.995 position:50% align:center
What, so a man can't joke now?

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.790 position:50% align:center
It's wonderful news about the
baby, though, don't you think?

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:28.291 position:50% align:center
Absolutely.

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:30.919 position:50% align:center
So, where is everyone?
Off resting?

00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:32.921 position:50% align:center
They went to pick up
some groceries.

00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:34.381 position:50% align:center
Ahh.

00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:38.134 position:50% align:center
Well, then I suppose that
just leaves the two of us.

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:39.636 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:45.684 position:50% align:center
How lovely. We can spend...
some quality time together.

00:03:45.767 --> 00:03:47.394 position:50% align:center
I'm teasing, Tohru.

00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:49.729 position:50% align:center
Nothing wrong with a joke
between friends, right?

00:03:49.813 --> 00:03:51.272 position:50% align:center
Ice cream anybody?

00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:52.816 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Honestly, Sensei.

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:55.985 position:50% align:center
As an adult, you should really
learn to restrain yourself.

00:03:58.363 --> 00:04:01.658 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI] Huh? Hiro's getting
a new brother or sister?

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:02.992 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Yep.

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:06.204 position:50% align:center
I wonder which one it's
gonna be. A boy or a girl.

00:04:06.287 --> 00:04:07.872 position:50% align:center
Either would be nice!

00:04:07.956 --> 00:04:09.374 position:50% align:center
The only thing about
a girl, though,

00:04:09.457 --> 00:04:12.127 position:50% align:center
is he wouldn't be able to
give her hugs and cuddles.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.712 position:50% align:center
But still, at least
we know that there are

00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:15.505 position:50% align:center
no more spirits waiting
for their turn,

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:18.925 position:50% align:center
so the baby won't make
Hiro's <i>mutti</i> sad.

00:04:19.884 --> 00:04:22.137 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU] All of the zodiac
spirits have been born,

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.682 position:50% align:center
so no more'll show up
as long as we're alive.

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:30.270 position:50% align:center
New children, born without
that cloud over their heads.

00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:34.357 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI] Of course, Hiro's <i>mutti</i>
wasn't fazed even a little bit

00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:36.443 position:50% align:center
when he first transformed.

00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:37.861 position:50% align:center
She looked at him and said,

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:40.196 position:50% align:center
"Oh, how wonderful.
I love sheep."

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.740 position:50% align:center
And that was that.

00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:44.576 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Right?! She's amazing!

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:47.287 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I'm curious what they're like.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.666 position:50% align:center
Yuki's parents. Kyo's parents.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.877 position:50% align:center
Everyone else's.

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:57.297 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Tohru, do you need some help?

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.715 position:50% align:center
Is it too heavy?

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:00.842 position:50% align:center
No, I think I've got it,
but maybe you could tell me

00:05:00.925 --> 00:05:03.636 position:50% align:center
why you guys bought
so many watermelons.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.723 position:50% align:center
It's summer. You know what
that means, don't you?

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:09.684 position:50% align:center
All right, let the watermelon
splitting contest begin!

00:05:09.768 --> 00:05:11.436 position:50% align:center
[HIRO, YUKI, KYO]
Huh?

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:14.022 position:50% align:center
We're going to celebrate little
Hiro becoming a big <i>bruder</i> !

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:16.107 position:50% align:center
Sounds like a pretty
lame way to celebrate.

00:05:16.191 --> 00:05:17.776 position:50% align:center
You know, if it's in my honor,

00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:19.069 position:50% align:center
then maybe we
should do something

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:20.737 position:50% align:center
that I would actually enjoy.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.947 position:50% align:center
These things are so dumb.

00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:25.909 position:50% align:center
Why should we waste a
perfectly good watermelon?

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:28.745 position:50% align:center
We won't, though!
That's what the sheet's for.

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:31.873 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] But... don't we still
need a stick and a blindfold?

00:05:31.956 --> 00:05:35.502 position:50% align:center
Huh? Why would we? Hm?

00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:44.511 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Uhh...

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:46.763 position:50% align:center
Prove your prowess as
a big brother, Hiro.

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:47.555 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI squeals]

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.391 position:50% align:center
Do you ever make sense?

00:05:49.474 --> 00:05:50.725 position:50% align:center
'Kay. Me next!

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:53.103 position:50% align:center
I wanna celebrate properly,
so I'll do my best.

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:54.688 position:50% align:center
[KYO, YUKI]
Uh!

00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:56.189 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] I've done this before,
so it's not totally new to me.

00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:59.150 position:50% align:center
Though I've never tried to
split one with my bare hands.

00:05:59.234 --> 00:06:01.027 position:50% align:center
Right. Because that
would just be dumb.

00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:04.489 position:50% align:center
I had a really hard time with
it at first, but then my mo--

00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:07.409 position:50% align:center
Seriously, it's always her.
Mom this, Mom that.

00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:08.535 position:50% align:center
But you had another parent.

00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:09.911 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:14.582 position:50% align:center
Um, I mean... my monkey. Heh.

00:06:14.666 --> 00:06:16.126 position:50% align:center
[OTHERS]
Your... monkey?

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:17.752 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Have I been a
horrible, thoughtless,

00:06:17.836 --> 00:06:20.755 position:50% align:center
insensitive person for talking
about my mom so much?

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:22.674 position:50% align:center
Is that why he was upset?

00:06:22.757 --> 00:06:24.384 position:50% align:center
I barely know anything
about their parents

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:26.386 position:50% align:center
or what kind of
relationships they have.

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:30.432 position:50% align:center
What if I've been hurting
them the whole time?

00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:32.600 position:50% align:center
I didn't know monkeys
could split watermelons.

00:06:32.684 --> 00:06:35.562 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah! It's amazing
what they can do.

00:06:35.645 --> 00:06:38.273 position:50% align:center
I guess what I said
really did bother her.

00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:40.400 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Anyway, here goes nothing!

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:42.569 position:50% align:center
In celebration of
Hiro's new baby!

00:06:42.652 --> 00:06:44.612 position:50% align:center
Again, I'm not the one
having a baby here!

00:06:44.696 --> 00:06:45.363 position:50% align:center
She's doing it?

00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:46.114 position:50% align:center
Bad idea!

00:06:46.197 --> 00:06:48.408 position:50% align:center
Hiyah!

00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:56.541 position:50% align:center
Congratulations on
your new arrival.

00:06:56.624 --> 00:06:58.293 position:50% align:center
Is she crying because
her hand hurts

00:06:58.376 --> 00:07:00.170 position:50% align:center
or because she couldn't
split the thing?

00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:02.422 position:50% align:center
Right. I'll do my best
to celebrate, too!

00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:03.757 position:50% align:center
Don't do it, Kisa!

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.800 position:50% align:center
I think I'm gonna try
throwing mine instead.

00:07:05.884 --> 00:07:08.303 position:50% align:center
You're missing the entire
point of the game, you moron!

00:07:08.386 --> 00:07:09.262 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI laughs]

00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:11.097 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
You sound like Kyo!

00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:11.723 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Huh?

00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:12.682 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
How so?

00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:15.352 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
All the scolding. Ha!

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:17.270 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
When I was younger, I thought,

00:07:17.354 --> 00:07:18.730 position:50% align:center
if I swallowed a seed,

00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:21.191 position:50% align:center
a watermelon would start
to grow inside my stomach.

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:22.984 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:07:23.068 --> 00:07:24.486 position:50% align:center
Where did the kids go to?

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:27.530 position:50% align:center
Inside. Miss Honda
went with them.

00:07:28.656 --> 00:07:30.033 position:50% align:center
[YUKI chuckles]

00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:32.202 position:50% align:center
I guess they were tired.

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:53.098 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Akito came every day
to bury me under more darkness.

00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:59.104 position:50% align:center
To whisper pitch-black things
in that pitch-black room.

00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:03.650 position:50% align:center
To take away any
light I'd imagined.

00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:12.534 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Until what I wanted
seemed impossible to have.

00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:17.414 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:25.213 --> 00:08:27.716 position:50% align:center
I think I need a walk.

00:08:27.799 --> 00:08:29.884 position:50% align:center
Yuki.

00:08:29.968 --> 00:08:32.262 position:50% align:center
It makes us stronger.

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:38.143 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
The perks of being a kid.

00:08:38.226 --> 00:08:41.062 position:50% align:center
They're worn out
from playing so much.

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:46.901 position:50% align:center
[KYO] Hey. Did Hiro say
something bratty to you?

00:08:47.944 --> 00:08:48.737 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.822 position:50% align:center
You're holding stuff in again.

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:53.616 position:50% align:center
You know I get worried
when you do that crap.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:58.997 position:50% align:center
Um, but... what if what I say
ends up hurting you more?

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.874 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Huh? Hurting me?

00:09:00.957 --> 00:09:04.169 position:50% align:center
Now I really gotta know
what this is about.

00:09:04.252 --> 00:09:04.919 position:50% align:center
Out with it!

00:09:05.003 --> 00:09:06.087 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:09:06.171 --> 00:09:09.466 position:50% align:center
I was thinking,
if you don't mind,

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:12.260 position:50% align:center
I would really like to know
more about your parents.

00:09:12.344 --> 00:09:17.349 position:50% align:center
Oh. That's it? I thought
I already told you.

00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:21.478 position:50% align:center
Well, my real dad and I aren't
exactly what you'd call close.

00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:24.606 position:50% align:center
I haven't even seen
the guy in years.

00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:26.399 position:50% align:center
My mom kill--

00:09:28.193 --> 00:09:29.361 position:50% align:center
Uh, she was killed.

00:09:29.444 --> 00:09:30.862 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:34.407 position:50% align:center
[KYO] In an accident when
I was four or five years old.

00:09:34.491 --> 00:09:37.994 position:50% align:center
Uh. Okay. I get it now.

00:09:38.078 --> 00:09:40.163 position:50% align:center
When you cut yourself
off, that's why.

00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:41.206 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Huh?

00:09:41.289 --> 00:09:44.000 position:50% align:center
You're worried after
all this time?

00:09:44.084 --> 00:09:47.087 position:50% align:center
Your mom's got nothing
to do with our parents.

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:48.922 position:50% align:center
If anything, it pisses
me off that you think

00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:50.924 position:50% align:center
you have to walk on
eggshells around us.

00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:52.300 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Oh, uh--

00:09:52.384 --> 00:09:55.679 position:50% align:center
So you two did some watermelon
splitting together?

00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:59.265 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah, we did.

00:09:59.349 --> 00:10:03.895 position:50% align:center
A long time ago,
when I was little.

00:10:03.978 --> 00:10:07.857 position:50% align:center
I didn't get anywhere near
the watermelon at first.

00:10:07.941 --> 00:10:12.028 position:50% align:center
And when it was Mom's turn,
she broke a flowerpot.

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:15.699 position:50% align:center
Uh. I mean, we paid for it,
of course, since it wasn't ours!

00:10:15.782 --> 00:10:19.327 position:50% align:center
But still, the apartment
manager got mad,

00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:22.622 position:50% align:center
so we decided to try
moving the game inside.

00:10:22.706 --> 00:10:27.002 position:50% align:center
Only this time,
Mom smashed Dad's shrine.

00:10:27.085 --> 00:10:31.047 position:50% align:center
In the end, though,
we finally got it open.

00:10:33.258 --> 00:10:34.759 position:50% align:center
It was--

00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:44.853 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
It was fun?

00:10:44.936 --> 00:10:48.106 position:50% align:center
Yes! It really was.

00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:50.316 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU laughs]

00:10:58.116 --> 00:11:01.327 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:03.163 position:50% align:center
[HATORI] When are you going
to stop causing trouble

00:11:03.246 --> 00:11:05.540 position:50% align:center
for other people just
to amuse yourself?

00:11:05.623 --> 00:11:07.542 position:50% align:center
Oh! Doc! Hey, there.

00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:09.753 position:50% align:center
I didn't think you'd
actually be coming.

00:11:09.836 --> 00:11:11.004 position:50% align:center
Yes, you did.

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:13.840 position:50% align:center
You've been putting ideas
into Akito's head.

00:11:13.923 --> 00:11:17.010 position:50% align:center
Don't get carried away
with your little jokes.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:19.596 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE gasps]

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:20.722 position:50% align:center
[HATORI]
Or I'll have to use this.

00:11:20.805 --> 00:11:23.767 position:50% align:center
Now, don't be hasty.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.895 position:50% align:center
So... Akito?

00:11:26.978 --> 00:11:28.730 position:50% align:center
[HATORI]
Here. Or I wouldn't be.

00:11:28.813 --> 00:11:30.815 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
You are the favorite, after all.

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:33.234 position:50% align:center
Of course you would be summoned

00:11:33.318 --> 00:11:34.986 position:50% align:center
[HATORI]
Not just me.

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:36.196 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:42.952 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:43.036 --> 00:11:46.623 position:50% align:center
Kureno. What are you doing here?

00:11:52.837 --> 00:11:55.131 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Ha. Kureno, too?

00:11:55.215 --> 00:11:59.135 position:50% align:center
As sagacious as I am, I admit
I didn't see that coming.

00:11:59.219 --> 00:12:01.888 position:50% align:center
Stop meddling where
you shouldn't be.

00:12:01.971 --> 00:12:04.641 position:50% align:center
Leave Yuki, Kyo,
and Honda alone.

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:07.602 position:50% align:center
If you continue to interfere
like you have been,

00:12:07.686 --> 00:12:09.771 position:50% align:center
things'll get twisted.

00:12:09.854 --> 00:12:11.314 position:50% align:center
Oh, please.

00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:15.110 position:50% align:center
They're twisted already, and
they're only going to get worse.

00:12:15.193 --> 00:12:18.113 position:50% align:center
So I might as well encourage
Akito to twist things

00:12:18.196 --> 00:12:21.449 position:50% align:center
in the direction
I want them to go.

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:24.285 position:50% align:center
Hello there, Yuki.

00:12:24.369 --> 00:12:26.955 position:50% align:center
You're all alone,
as usual, I see.

00:12:27.038 --> 00:12:29.541 position:50% align:center
Such a lonely child.

00:12:33.378 --> 00:12:35.797 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
It makes us stronger.

00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:39.509 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
So we can keep fighting.

00:12:41.302 --> 00:12:42.387 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Huh?

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:44.681 position:50% align:center
Akito came? Really?

00:12:44.764 --> 00:12:48.643 position:50% align:center
Yes. Arrived just now,
in the flesh.

00:12:48.727 --> 00:12:51.271 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Is Akito going to stay here?

00:12:51.354 --> 00:12:54.816 position:50% align:center
Of course not. The annex has
been prepared, as well.

00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:57.402 position:50% align:center
Anyway, we should go
over and say hello.

00:12:57.485 --> 00:12:59.320 position:50% align:center
Should we get changed first?

00:12:59.404 --> 00:13:01.364 position:50% align:center
No, you're fine like that.

00:13:01.448 --> 00:13:03.616 position:50% align:center
Does anybody know where Yuki is?

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.201 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Out walking.

00:13:05.285 --> 00:13:06.536 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Oh, is he?

00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:08.663 position:50% align:center
Well, he can come pay his
respects later, then.

00:13:08.747 --> 00:13:10.206 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Hey.

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:12.792 position:50% align:center
You're not gonna drag Tohru
along with you guys, are you?

00:13:12.876 --> 00:13:16.671 position:50% align:center
No, no. I think It'll just
be the family for today.

00:13:16.755 --> 00:13:17.589 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:13:17.672 --> 00:13:19.883 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Oh. No, that's fine.

00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:23.928 position:50% align:center
You stay here. Keep Kyo out
of trouble while we're gone.

00:13:25.013 --> 00:13:28.850 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Left out again.
Because he's the Cat.

00:13:30.185 --> 00:13:33.605 position:50% align:center
Stop. The Cat doesn't go
to the family gatherings.

00:13:33.688 --> 00:13:36.649 position:50% align:center
That's how it is. No big deal.

00:13:36.733 --> 00:13:38.818 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Well, we'll see you later, then.

00:13:38.902 --> 00:13:40.362 position:50% align:center
Bye, Tohru.

00:13:40.445 --> 00:13:42.655 position:50% align:center
Right. We shouldn't
be back too late.

00:13:42.739 --> 00:13:45.575 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you can keep
yourselves occupied.

00:13:51.289 --> 00:13:54.876 position:50% align:center
[KYO] Akito only came
to ruin everyone's fun.

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:58.338 position:50% align:center
It's always been like
this. Same old crap.

00:13:58.421 --> 00:14:02.842 position:50% align:center
Comes in, makes everybody
miserable, then leaves.

00:14:08.181 --> 00:14:10.183 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Then... let's cook!

00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:11.142 position:50% align:center
What now?

00:14:11.226 --> 00:14:12.686 position:50% align:center
You heard me, Kyo!

00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:15.146 position:50% align:center
Now's not the time for us to act
all gloomy and disappointed.

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:17.941 position:50% align:center
Let's cheer up.
Look lively. Have fun!

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:19.693 position:50% align:center
Couldja dial it down
a notch or two?

00:14:19.776 --> 00:14:23.238 position:50% align:center
All right. Then it's settled,
I'm going to cook something!

00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:24.864 position:50% align:center
If the others don't eat
while they're gone,

00:14:24.948 --> 00:14:27.367 position:50% align:center
I'm sure they'll be hungry
when they get back.

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:28.410 position:50% align:center
And since you're here,

00:14:28.493 --> 00:14:30.954 position:50% align:center
you get to decide
what we'll have.

00:14:31.037 --> 00:14:31.996 position:50% align:center
Pancakes.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.832 position:50% align:center
Breakfast for dinner--I like it!

00:14:33.915 --> 00:14:36.292 position:50% align:center
I didn't realize you were
a fan of pancakes.

00:14:36.376 --> 00:14:37.752 position:50% align:center
I'm not.

00:14:37.836 --> 00:14:40.588 position:50% align:center
I just threw it out there
'cause I've never had them.

00:14:43.091 --> 00:14:47.095 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] I'm here, waiting
for you to come back.

00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:49.014 position:50% align:center
All of you.

00:14:50.265 --> 00:14:52.100 position:50% align:center
Kisa, are you okay?

00:14:52.183 --> 00:14:54.102 position:50% align:center
I am.

00:14:54.185 --> 00:14:58.940 position:50% align:center
But, Hiro- <i>chan</i> , will Akito
do something mean again?

00:14:59.024 --> 00:15:01.818 position:50% align:center
Maybe hurt Tohru?

00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:05.530 position:50% align:center
That scares me. A lot.

00:15:09.284 --> 00:15:11.369 position:50% align:center
They look worried.

00:15:11.453 --> 00:15:16.583 position:50% align:center
Can't blame them. This visit
came out of nowhere. It's rough.

00:15:16.666 --> 00:15:19.002 position:50% align:center
I hope Yuki'll be all right.

00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:21.796 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU] Worry less about
him and more about yourself.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.174 position:50% align:center
Akito doesn't like you.

00:15:24.257 --> 00:15:27.302 position:50% align:center
Well, that's okay.
I'm used to it.

00:15:27.385 --> 00:15:29.387 position:50% align:center
But still, I hope
this'll be over quick

00:15:29.471 --> 00:15:32.640 position:50% align:center
so we can get back to the house.

00:15:32.724 --> 00:15:38.605 position:50% align:center
After all... someone's waiting.

00:15:40.231 --> 00:15:42.817 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Oh, Doctor, we've arrived!

00:15:42.901 --> 00:15:44.694 position:50% align:center
Honda's not with you?

00:15:44.778 --> 00:15:46.780 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] I asked her to
stay back at the house.

00:15:46.863 --> 00:15:48.823 position:50% align:center
The others went in
through the front.

00:15:48.907 --> 00:15:51.659 position:50% align:center
So, how are things here?

00:15:51.743 --> 00:15:55.038 position:50% align:center
Akito just got back
with Kureno in tow.

00:15:55.121 --> 00:15:56.706 position:50% align:center
And the heat is taking
its usual toll.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:59.751 position:50% align:center
Usual toll, right.

00:15:59.834 --> 00:16:01.211 position:50% align:center
I'm still trying to
solve the mystery

00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:04.172 position:50% align:center
of Kureno's presence at this
little summer retreat.

00:16:04.255 --> 00:16:06.257 position:50% align:center
He's an elusive creature
even you and I

00:16:06.341 --> 00:16:08.885 position:50% align:center
are rarely allowed to
catch a glimpse of.

00:16:08.968 --> 00:16:12.263 position:50% align:center
Perhaps Akito felt too insecure
to leave him unattended.

00:16:12.347 --> 00:16:13.515 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Insecure?

00:16:13.598 --> 00:16:16.601 position:50% align:center
Oh, don't tell me Ren
came for a visit. Heh.

00:16:16.685 --> 00:16:17.394 position:50% align:center
[HATORI]
You know it's forbidd--

00:16:17.477 --> 00:16:19.771 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Shigure!

00:16:19.854 --> 00:16:23.775 position:50% align:center
Sorry I'm a bit late, but I was
rounding up the children.

00:16:23.858 --> 00:16:25.610 position:50% align:center
[AKITO] Didn't I tell you
to come straight to me

00:16:25.694 --> 00:16:27.153 position:50% align:center
once you'd arrived?

00:16:27.237 --> 00:16:28.446 position:50% align:center
I realize you're an idiot,

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:30.949 position:50% align:center
but even you should
know better than that.

00:16:31.032 --> 00:16:35.578 position:50% align:center
You are absolutely correct,
as always. My apologies.

00:16:35.662 --> 00:16:37.956 position:50% align:center
Kureno, you can leave us now.

00:16:38.039 --> 00:16:40.542 position:50% align:center
There's no one here
you need to see.

00:16:41.876 --> 00:16:44.129 position:50% align:center
[HATORI] Akito, maybe
you could let Kureno

00:16:44.212 --> 00:16:46.131 position:50% align:center
meet with the others
once in a while.

00:16:46.214 --> 00:16:49.467 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
That sounds wholly unnecessary.

00:16:49.551 --> 00:16:51.469 position:50% align:center
But enough about that.

00:16:51.553 --> 00:16:54.514 position:50% align:center
I saw poor little Yuki earlier.

00:16:54.597 --> 00:16:56.975 position:50% align:center
He was walking all alone,

00:16:57.058 --> 00:16:59.853 position:50% align:center
so I was nice enough
to talk to him.

00:16:59.936 --> 00:17:04.315 position:50% align:center
How very kind of you. I'm sure
he appreciated the company.

00:17:04.399 --> 00:17:06.192 position:50% align:center
He looked so lonely,

00:17:06.276 --> 00:17:09.487 position:50% align:center
and I've always cared for him--
it was the least I could do.

00:17:09.571 --> 00:17:12.032 position:50% align:center
I did scold him ever so gently.

00:17:12.115 --> 00:17:17.454 position:50% align:center
He's deluding himself,
and that needs to stop. Now.

00:17:17.537 --> 00:17:21.499 position:50% align:center
Still, gentle as I was,
he looked pretty shocked.

00:17:21.583 --> 00:17:24.669 position:50% align:center
So he's probably off
sniveling somewhere.

00:17:24.753 --> 00:17:28.840 position:50% align:center
Which is just so Yuki
I could vomit.

00:17:28.923 --> 00:17:34.012 position:50% align:center
[AKITO laughing]

00:17:34.095 --> 00:17:37.223 position:50% align:center
You should've seen the
look on his dumb face.

00:17:37.307 --> 00:17:40.393 position:50% align:center
When will he come to his
senses and return to me?

00:17:40.477 --> 00:17:43.938 position:50% align:center
He's utterly useless, but I'd
still find a place for him.

00:17:44.022 --> 00:17:46.066 position:50% align:center
I am nothing if not gracious.

00:17:46.149 --> 00:17:48.151 position:50% align:center
[AKITO chuckling]

00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:50.403 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] I'm sure no one
would dispute that.

00:17:50.487 --> 00:17:52.489 position:50% align:center
Anyway, the others
are waiting for you.

00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:54.574 position:50% align:center
Perhaps you could go say hello?

00:17:54.657 --> 00:17:56.076 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Fine.

00:17:56.159 --> 00:17:58.828 position:50% align:center
If I must. I'll be back.

00:17:58.912 --> 00:18:02.165 position:50% align:center
Shigure, don't go anywhere.

00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:04.751 position:50% align:center
'Course not.
Wouldn't dream of it.

00:18:06.795 --> 00:18:11.216 position:50% align:center
And silence.
I take it you're angry?

00:18:11.299 --> 00:18:12.842 position:50% align:center
No.

00:18:12.926 --> 00:18:15.470 position:50% align:center
I may not approve
of your methods,

00:18:15.553 --> 00:18:17.555 position:50% align:center
but at least you're
doing something,

00:18:17.639 --> 00:18:21.893 position:50% align:center
trying to change
things, unlike me.

00:18:21.976 --> 00:18:23.478 position:50% align:center
I must've heard you wrong.

00:18:23.561 --> 00:18:24.604 position:50% align:center
This is where you yell at me

00:18:24.688 --> 00:18:26.564 position:50% align:center
for being such a
horrible human being!

00:18:26.648 --> 00:18:27.857 position:50% align:center
That's playing dirty!

00:18:27.941 --> 00:18:29.693 position:50% align:center
You know I'm basically
putty in your hands

00:18:29.776 --> 00:18:32.028 position:50% align:center
--when you get like this!
--Stop it.

00:18:32.112 --> 00:18:33.571 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:18:33.655 --> 00:18:35.031 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Look at us.

00:18:35.115 --> 00:18:40.704 position:50% align:center
You're kind to a fault.
I'm an unrepentant schemer.

00:18:40.787 --> 00:18:43.581 position:50% align:center
And Yuki, he isn't the
same frightened child

00:18:43.665 --> 00:18:47.002 position:50% align:center
who was locked inside that
dark room for so long.

00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:52.465 position:50% align:center
So, then, who's truly the
most deluded idiot among us?

00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:54.092 position:50% align:center
I wonder.

00:18:55.385 --> 00:18:58.221 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Welcome. Thank you for coming.

00:18:58.304 --> 00:19:01.766 position:50% align:center
It's so wonderful
to see your faces.

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:05.687 position:50% align:center
I love you. All of you.

00:19:08.898 --> 00:19:11.359 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I thought they'd be back by now.

00:19:11.443 --> 00:19:14.404 position:50% align:center
If they stayed this late, they
prob'ly just ate dinner there.

00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:16.322 position:50% align:center
C'mon, let's cook up
the rest and eat 'em.

00:19:16.406 --> 00:19:18.408 position:50% align:center
No! We should at least
save some for them!

00:19:18.491 --> 00:19:19.909 position:50% align:center
Hey, I know.

00:19:19.993 --> 00:19:22.495 position:50% align:center
Why don't we call them and
see how long they'll be?

00:19:22.579 --> 00:19:25.749 position:50% align:center
Sure thing. You got a
phone number we can use?

00:19:25.832 --> 00:19:29.210 position:50% align:center
Okay, if that won't work, I'll
go take a look around outside.

00:19:29.294 --> 00:19:31.338 position:50% align:center
What good do ya think
that's gonna do?

00:19:31.421 --> 00:19:32.839 position:50% align:center
Hey, wait!

00:19:35.133 --> 00:19:36.968 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I'm worried.

00:19:37.052 --> 00:19:40.096 position:50% align:center
The last time I saw Akito...

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.265 position:50% align:center
...things didn't go well.

00:19:42.349 --> 00:19:45.560 position:50% align:center
Yuki seemed truly terrified.

00:19:47.103 --> 00:19:49.647 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Has Yuki already gone to visit?

00:19:49.731 --> 00:19:52.192 position:50% align:center
Is he at the annex now?

00:19:55.028 --> 00:19:55.695 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Miss Honda?

00:19:55.779 --> 00:19:57.113 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:01.826 --> 00:20:05.455 position:50% align:center
What are you... doing out here?

00:20:05.538 --> 00:20:07.207 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Yuki!

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:10.335 position:50% align:center
Thank goodness!
I'm so glad to see you!

00:20:10.418 --> 00:20:12.754 position:50% align:center
Oh, are you lost again?

00:20:12.837 --> 00:20:13.546 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU gasps]

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:15.298 position:50% align:center
No, I'm not.

00:20:15.382 --> 00:20:17.592 position:50% align:center
So, um, why are you out here?

00:20:17.676 --> 00:20:20.762 position:50% align:center
Me? I just went for a walk.

00:20:20.845 --> 00:20:22.972 position:50% align:center
There were some things
I wanted to think about.

00:20:23.056 --> 00:20:25.600 position:50% align:center
I guess I lost track of time.

00:20:26.976 --> 00:20:29.229 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Let's go back.

00:20:29.312 --> 00:20:30.730 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:20:35.652 --> 00:20:37.570 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
If he's out here,

00:20:37.654 --> 00:20:40.990 position:50% align:center
does that mean he's not
going to visit Akito?

00:20:46.705 --> 00:20:49.290 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:49.374 --> 00:20:52.377 position:50% align:center
Yuki, look! There
are shooting stars!

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:54.546 position:50% align:center
A whole bunch of them!

00:20:54.629 --> 00:20:56.756 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU giggles]

00:20:59.926 --> 00:21:02.721 position:50% align:center
They're so beautiful.

00:21:12.605 --> 00:21:15.567 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] The truth is,
in the back of my mind,

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:19.070 position:50% align:center
I probably knew
what would happen.

00:21:19.154 --> 00:21:22.365 position:50% align:center
How life would change
if I opened the lid.

00:21:23.533 --> 00:21:25.827 position:50% align:center
There are things
that I need to do.

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:29.247 position:50% align:center
Things I should've done sooner.

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:33.376 position:50% align:center
It's simple, so simple.

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:38.006 position:50% align:center
But that's exactly
what makes it difficult.

00:21:38.089 --> 00:21:42.761 position:50% align:center
You did it? You opened the lid?

00:21:42.844 --> 00:21:45.722 position:50% align:center
Yes, thanks to Akito.

00:21:45.805 --> 00:21:48.725 position:50% align:center
And to you.
Because you listened.

00:21:48.808 --> 00:21:50.685 position:50% align:center
You stood by me.

00:21:51.686 --> 00:21:55.732 position:50% align:center
You had faith,
accepted me for who I am,

00:21:55.815 --> 00:21:58.068 position:50% align:center
even when I was weak.

00:21:59.069 --> 00:22:01.696 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
And you held onto that memory.

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:05.200 position:50% align:center
Treasured it.
All these years later.

00:22:05.283 --> 00:22:08.078 position:50% align:center
Thank you for that.

00:22:08.161 --> 00:22:11.122 position:50% align:center
You were lost, and I saved you.

00:22:11.206 --> 00:22:14.542 position:50% align:center
I can't tell you how
much that meant.

00:22:14.626 --> 00:22:18.296 position:50% align:center
I'd been told for so long
that I was useless.

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:23.510 position:50% align:center
But that day,
for the first time,

00:22:23.593 --> 00:22:27.639 position:50% align:center
I felt what it was
like to be needed.

00:22:29.557 --> 00:22:31.976 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I don't think there's
any way you could know

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:35.397 position:50% align:center
how deeply that chance
encounter affected me.

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:39.859 position:50% align:center
You don't see it. Don't realize.

00:22:39.943 --> 00:22:43.071 position:50% align:center
That you're the one
who's always saving me.

00:22:44.489 --> 00:22:45.949 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
You share it all.

00:22:46.032 --> 00:22:54.541 position:50% align:center
Your kindness. Your warmth.
Your irrepressible joy.

00:22:54.624 --> 00:22:57.419 position:50% align:center
You don't hold back any of them.

00:23:00.338 --> 00:23:04.259 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] That's why I won't
give up, or give in.

00:23:04.342 --> 00:23:08.430 position:50% align:center
I'll keep trying. Fighting.

00:23:08.513 --> 00:23:12.058 position:50% align:center
And believing that there's hope.

00:23:13.893 --> 00:23:15.270 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
But...

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:20.692 position:50% align:center
All of that's good, right?

00:23:20.775 --> 00:23:23.570 position:50% align:center
So then, why...?

00:23:23.653 --> 00:23:25.989 position:50% align:center
Why do you look so sad?

00:23:28.825 --> 00:23:31.786 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Because you...

00:23:37.459 --> 00:23:39.711 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
You're like the sky.

00:23:41.504 --> 00:23:43.673 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I'm sad because...

00:23:50.722 --> 00:23:54.768 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I don't know what
I would do... without you.

00:23:57.187 --> 00:23:59.189 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
"It's true, isn't it?"
