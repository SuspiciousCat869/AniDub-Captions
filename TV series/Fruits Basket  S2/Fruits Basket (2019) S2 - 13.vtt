[UOTANI]
How much did you grow over...?

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:21.396 position:50% align:center
Sorry. She, well,
she gets worked up.

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:23.648 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI] You people shoot
up overnight like weeds.

00:00:23.732 --> 00:00:25.483 position:50% align:center
You're not exactly
short, Arisa.

00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:27.986 position:50% align:center
I won't be satisfied
until I'm 5'11"!

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:31.156 position:50% align:center
Ah, yes, the familiar sounds
of a new term starting.

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:33.074 position:50% align:center
Welcome back, everyone.

00:00:33.158 --> 00:00:34.826 position:50% align:center
The break obviously
didn't do much for you

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:36.995 position:50% align:center
in the femininity department.

00:00:37.078 --> 00:00:38.329 position:50% align:center
Maybe you should just give up.

00:00:38.413 --> 00:00:40.081 position:50% align:center
Heh. Yeah, maybe I will.

00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:42.250 position:50% align:center
What's the point
in trying, anyway?

00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:45.211 position:50% align:center
Can't even get one man
to give me a second look.

00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:46.504 position:50% align:center
Is she okay?

00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:49.299 position:50% align:center
Okay? No, not even close.

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:51.301 position:50% align:center
Her special friend from
the convenience store

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:54.095 position:50% align:center
has failed to make
another appearance.

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:57.015 position:50% align:center
You can see it, plain as day.

00:00:57.098 --> 00:01:00.018 position:50% align:center
The aura of a woman
desperately in love.

00:01:00.101 --> 00:01:01.436 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Yeah.

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.856 position:50% align:center
Now that you mention it,
she does seem pretty upset.

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:06.983 position:50% align:center
Indeed. It's hard to watch.

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:08.610 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
That's funny.

00:01:08.693 --> 00:01:11.321 position:50% align:center
Never thought I'd see you
getting flustered over someone.

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:13.156 position:50% align:center
Huh. Interesting.

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:15.325 position:50% align:center
That you would say
something like that.

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:17.660 position:50% align:center
Uh. What's that mean?

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:22.582 position:50% align:center
Wait, hold on! You didn't
read my mind, did you?

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:25.043 position:50% align:center
My waves don't give me the
ability to read minds.

00:01:25.126 --> 00:01:27.420 position:50% align:center
I just remembered
something amusing.

00:01:27.504 --> 00:01:29.339 position:50% align:center
Probably best if we
leave it at that.

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:31.174 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Did you or not?!

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:06.394 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO]
Yuki!

00:03:06.478 --> 00:03:08.146 position:50% align:center
These are for you.

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:10.732 position:50% align:center
A souvenir of Summer
Sweetheart biscuits.

00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:12.734 position:50% align:center
I hope you like them.

00:03:12.817 --> 00:03:15.111 position:50% align:center
Oh. Thanks, that's really nice.

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:18.114 position:50% align:center
I feel bad, though.
I didn't get you anything.

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:21.242 position:50% align:center
It's fine. Just giving you
a gift is enough for me.

00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:22.660 position:50% align:center
She's right!

00:03:22.744 --> 00:03:24.329 position:50% align:center
You don't need to worry about
that kinda stuff, Yuki.

00:03:24.412 --> 00:03:26.373 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO] Simply grace me
with a grateful smile,

00:03:26.456 --> 00:03:29.084 position:50% align:center
and it will be the only gift
I could ever need.

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:31.086 position:50% align:center
Upon it, I will soar,

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:34.089 position:50% align:center
rising high into the heavens
on pure white wings.

00:03:34.172 --> 00:03:36.257 position:50% align:center
[KINOSHITA]
Flying through the endless sky,

00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:38.885 position:50% align:center
hearts expanding to hold
a love so deep and true

00:03:38.968 --> 00:03:40.512 position:50% align:center
it almost hurts.

00:03:40.595 --> 00:03:41.888 position:50% align:center
[KINOSHITA, MOKOTO sighing]

00:03:41.971 --> 00:03:42.889 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Minagawa- <i>senpai</i> ?

00:03:42.972 --> 00:03:45.558 position:50% align:center
Ah! I'm sorry. I got distracted.

00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:47.477 position:50% align:center
The beginnings of a poem
just popped into my head

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.436 position:50% align:center
out of nowhere!

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.188 position:50% align:center
What a coincidence. Me, too.

00:03:50.271 --> 00:03:51.898 position:50% align:center
Who cares about dumb poetry?

00:03:51.981 --> 00:03:54.818 position:50% align:center
Now, Senpai, tell us what
you did over summer break!

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:57.278 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
What do you mean, "dumb poetry"?

00:03:57.362 --> 00:03:59.489 position:50% align:center
Went to the beach. That's all.

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:02.325 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGISHI] Ooh, a beach
vacation! Sounds like fun.

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:06.079 position:50% align:center
[KIMI] Wow! You're a super
popular guy, huh?

00:04:06.162 --> 00:04:08.081 position:50% align:center
Good for you!

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:14.671 position:50% align:center
Well, hello. What do ya got
there? Something yummy?

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:16.006 position:50% align:center
Um.

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:17.048 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGISHI, MOTOKO, KINOSHITA]
Who is that girl?

00:04:17.132 --> 00:04:18.299 position:50% align:center
[KINOSHITA gasps]

00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:20.552 position:50% align:center
Minami! If you know who
she is, speak up now.

00:04:20.635 --> 00:04:22.220 position:50% align:center
[KINOSHITA]
She's in class 2-A.

00:04:22.303 --> 00:04:25.682 position:50% align:center
They say she's a temptress
who seduces men with her looks.

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:26.891 position:50% align:center
...Yun-Yun.

00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:29.144 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
"Yun-Yun"?!

00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:30.520 position:50% align:center
Sorry?

00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:32.605 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO] That's it!
Just who do you think you are?

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:34.315 position:50% align:center
Showing up out of
nowhere like this!

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:37.277 position:50% align:center
And then daring to refer to
him as Yu-- No! I can't!

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.612 position:50% align:center
You don't get to pick out
some weird nickname for him!

00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:42.741 position:50% align:center
What's with that? Are you,
like, mocking us or something?

00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:45.869 position:50% align:center
[KIMI]
Ooo. You're pretty scary.

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:47.912 position:50% align:center
And, yeah, sure am!

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:51.499 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Can we talk for a second?
It won't take long.

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:53.585 position:50% align:center
Sure. Let's go!

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:55.962 position:50% align:center
[KIMI laughs]

00:04:56.046 --> 00:04:57.380 position:50% align:center
[KIMI]
That was so funny!

00:04:57.464 --> 00:05:00.508 position:50% align:center
Ha! Did you see the
looks on their faces?

00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:01.634 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Would you laugh as hard

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:03.219 position:50% align:center
if you were the one
being made fun of?

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:04.596 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:06.139 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Who are you?

00:05:06.222 --> 00:05:08.475 position:50% align:center
And where'd you come up
with that nickname?

00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:10.393 position:50% align:center
Oh? What, Yun-yun?

00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:13.605 position:50% align:center
I mean, Kimi wasn't the one
who first started using it.

00:05:13.688 --> 00:05:16.066 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Uh. Someone else
calls me that? Who?

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:18.234 position:50% align:center
Oh, Yun-Yun, there you are!

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:20.111 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Why am I not surprised?

00:05:20.195 --> 00:05:21.863 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Long time no see, Yun-Yun!

00:05:21.946 --> 00:05:24.783 position:50% align:center
How was your summer break, man?
All you could hope for?

00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:26.826 position:50% align:center
Mine was awesome--
totally jam packed.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.161 position:50% align:center
Dates practically every night.

00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:29.454 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
What's with the nickname?

00:05:29.537 --> 00:05:31.790 position:50% align:center
If I had my way, it would
last all year long.

00:05:31.873 --> 00:05:34.042 position:50% align:center
But, no, school just
had to start again.

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:35.460 position:50% align:center
Lame to the max, huh?

00:05:35.543 --> 00:05:37.879 position:50% align:center
Will you stop babbling
and answer the question?

00:05:37.962 --> 00:05:40.507 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh. Someone put on his
grumpy pants this morning.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.760 position:50% align:center
He isn't a big fan of the
nickname you gave him, Kakeru.

00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:46.638 position:50% align:center
But it's so cute. Like a name
you would give a panda.

00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:49.974 position:50% align:center
Usually people's nicknames are
shorter than their actual names.

00:05:50.058 --> 00:05:53.436 position:50% align:center
Oh, my bad. I guess I'm not
an expert on these things.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.021 position:50% align:center
But forget that!

00:05:55.105 --> 00:05:57.440 position:50% align:center
I was looking all over the
place for you, Yun-Yun.

00:05:57.524 --> 00:05:58.692 position:50% align:center
[KIMI]
Yeah, same here!

00:05:58.775 --> 00:06:01.528 position:50% align:center
That's why Kimi interrupted
before, Yun-Yun.

00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:05.031 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Oh, no. I'm stuck
with it now, aren't I?

00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:08.827 position:50% align:center
Hey! Our fearless
leader has arrived!

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:12.580 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:16.626 --> 00:06:20.005 position:50% align:center
I'm from class 1-C.
Naohito Sakuragi.

00:06:20.088 --> 00:06:22.674 position:50% align:center
I'm serving as one
of the secretaries.

00:06:22.757 --> 00:06:23.591 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Great.

00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:25.552 position:50% align:center
Truth is, it's a
tedious position

00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:27.971 position:50% align:center
and one I had no
interest in accepting,

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:31.224 position:50% align:center
but that changed after I found
out you were president.

00:06:31.307 --> 00:06:32.851 position:50% align:center
I want you to remember this:

00:06:32.934 --> 00:06:34.269 position:50% align:center
First and foremost,
you are my riv--

00:06:34.352 --> 00:06:37.856 position:50% align:center
Your first love? How sweet!
Get 'im, short stack.

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:39.899 position:50% align:center
I'll be here for moral
support if you need me.

00:06:39.983 --> 00:06:41.401 position:50% align:center
[NAOHITO]
I am of average height!

00:06:41.484 --> 00:06:45.739 position:50% align:center
Play nicely, you two. Oh,
I forgot to introduce myself.

00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:49.034 position:50% align:center
My name's Kimi Todo,
and I'm a secretary like him.

00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:51.327 position:50% align:center
What? You're on the
student council?

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:53.580 position:50% align:center
I might get a little
confused sometimes,

00:06:53.663 --> 00:06:55.582 position:50% align:center
but you'll be patient
with me, right?

00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:57.917 position:50% align:center
Just wait. I'll give
it my all, Yun-Yun.

00:06:58.001 --> 00:06:59.502 position:50% align:center
I won't ever let you down.

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:01.046 position:50% align:center
O... kay...

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:04.632 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I don't blame you for
bein' worried, but never fear.

00:07:04.716 --> 00:07:07.093 position:50% align:center
The cutesy act's convincing,
but this girl's actually-- Ow.

00:07:07.177 --> 00:07:09.137 position:50% align:center
Shut up and mind
your own business.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.222 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Ow. That freakin' hurt!

00:07:11.306 --> 00:07:12.932 position:50% align:center
I got him back for you,
short stack.

00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:15.727 position:50% align:center
[NAOHITO]
Stop calling me that!

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.813 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Deep or shallow?
Friendly or hostile?

00:07:18.897 --> 00:07:21.274 position:50% align:center
They've got too many
personalities to keep track of.

00:07:21.358 --> 00:07:23.526 position:50% align:center
I don't understand these people.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.612 position:50% align:center
And if I don't understand them,

00:07:25.695 --> 00:07:29.324 position:50% align:center
then how in the world am
I supposed to lead them?

00:07:29.407 --> 00:07:30.867 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Hey, Prez.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:34.204 position:50% align:center
Wanna give us an
inspiring word or two?

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:35.872 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
That's right.

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:40.210 position:50% align:center
I made a promise.
Time to keep it.

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:42.879 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Hello, everyone. Welcome.

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:44.881 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you're here.

00:07:44.964 --> 00:07:47.133 position:50% align:center
As members of the
student council,

00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:49.427 position:50% align:center
we have many important duties,

00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:53.223 position:50% align:center
and we'll have to work
together to fulfill them all.

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:55.850 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I promised myself,
no matter what,

00:07:55.934 --> 00:07:58.687 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't run anymore.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:02.190 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I'm not perfect,
and I won't pretend to be.

00:08:02.273 --> 00:08:06.277 position:50% align:center
The truth is, I still
have a lot to learn.

00:08:06.361 --> 00:08:10.115 position:50% align:center
But I swear, I'll work hard.

00:08:10.198 --> 00:08:15.078 position:50% align:center
And I'm hoping... I can count
on all of you to work with me.

00:08:16.955 --> 00:08:19.290 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Sure thing!

00:08:19.374 --> 00:08:20.959 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:08:21.042 --> 00:08:23.420 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
All right!

00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:25.755 position:50% align:center
You heard the man, guys.
We're all in this together.

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:26.339 position:50% align:center
Go team!

00:08:26.423 --> 00:08:27.674 position:50% align:center
We're together?

00:08:27.757 --> 00:08:29.134 position:50% align:center
So, you're actually gonna
pull your weight, then?

00:08:29.217 --> 00:08:30.927 position:50% align:center
Come on, what're you
talking about?

00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:32.971 position:50% align:center
I'm the vice president
of this outfit.

00:08:33.054 --> 00:08:35.682 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna work my
butt off, you'll see.

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:36.641 position:50% align:center
[snores]

00:08:36.725 --> 00:08:39.102 position:50% align:center
[NAOHITO]
That is not working!

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:41.312 position:50% align:center
Here we go.

00:08:41.396 --> 00:08:45.567 position:50% align:center
[bell tolls]

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.945 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] To put it nicely, this
year's student council members

00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:51.865 position:50% align:center
have... challenging
personalities.

00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:53.658 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO]
Todo, you should know,

00:08:53.742 --> 00:08:55.243 position:50% align:center
if you're causing
trouble for Yuki,

00:08:55.326 --> 00:08:57.245 position:50% align:center
there will be consequences.

00:08:57.328 --> 00:09:00.790 position:50% align:center
Cheekiness and rude remarks
are unacceptable.

00:09:00.874 --> 00:09:03.793 position:50% align:center
Aw. You guys don't need
to worry about me.

00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:07.088 position:50% align:center
I will be a good little
girl like I always am.

00:09:07.172 --> 00:09:09.299 position:50% align:center
Oh, Kimi almost forgot!

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:11.217 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much for
those yummy biscuits

00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:12.927 position:50% align:center
you gave Yun-Yun the other day.

00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:16.598 position:50% align:center
He and I ate them together.
They were super-duper delicious!

00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:18.433 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:09:18.516 --> 00:09:20.894 position:50% align:center
Right, sit down!
We need to talk!

00:09:20.977 --> 00:09:23.897 position:50% align:center
[KIMI] Would love to,
but Kimi's a little busy, so--

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.191 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Secretary Kimi Todo,
a second year,

00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:29.444 position:50% align:center
appears to enjoy
instigating conflict.

00:09:29.527 --> 00:09:32.364 position:50% align:center
Okay, what is this?
Somebody's idea of a joke?

00:09:32.447 --> 00:09:33.907 position:50% align:center
That sign is ludicrous!

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:38.536 position:50% align:center
And this room's a perpetual
mess. Honestly, people!

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.664 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Secretary Naohito
Sakuragi, a first year,

00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:43.208 position:50% align:center
is more than a
little high-strung.

00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:44.542 position:50% align:center
Kuragi, think you can work

00:09:44.626 --> 00:09:47.671 position:50% align:center
without spreading your
papers all over the place?!

00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:50.590 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] And treasurer Machi
Kuragi, a first year,

00:09:50.674 --> 00:09:53.927 position:50% align:center
looks at the floor most of the
time and barely ever speaks.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:55.220 position:50% align:center
Good grief.

00:09:55.303 --> 00:09:56.846 position:50% align:center
Are those two actually out
doing their rounds?

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:59.641 position:50% align:center
Or maybe just trying
to get away from here.

00:10:01.518 --> 00:10:03.687 position:50% align:center
The flowers are
blooming beautifully.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.730 position:50% align:center
Thank you. It hasn't been easy.

00:10:05.814 --> 00:10:06.898 position:50% align:center
We're short on members,

00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:08.817 position:50% align:center
but we're doing the
best that we can.

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.528 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Well, I can tell
you're working hard.

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:13.697 position:50% align:center
I'll try to come back by
and help you out,

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.281 position:50% align:center
once my rounds are done.

00:10:15.365 --> 00:10:17.534 position:50% align:center
Wow. You'd really do that?

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:19.119 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:10:19.202 --> 00:10:21.454 position:50% align:center
It probably won't be until later
in the afternoon, though, okay?

00:10:21.538 --> 00:10:23.289 position:50% align:center
[GARDEN STUDENT C]
Um, President.

00:10:23.373 --> 00:10:29.129 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but... do you think you
could do something about... him?

00:10:29.212 --> 00:10:32.507 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] But unquestionably,
Vice President Kakeru Manabe,

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:37.429 position:50% align:center
a second year, is the most
challenging of them all.

00:10:37.512 --> 00:10:41.057 position:50% align:center
[MANABE] Ah, man. I couldn't
keep my eyes open.

00:10:41.141 --> 00:10:45.478 position:50% align:center
Goin' around, visiting all the
clubs, it's a total snoozefest.

00:10:45.562 --> 00:10:48.189 position:50% align:center
Do you think you can
die of boredom?

00:10:48.273 --> 00:10:50.859 position:50% align:center
I don't get why we have to drag
ourselves all over school

00:10:50.942 --> 00:10:52.485 position:50% align:center
to chat people up like this.

00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:55.238 position:50% align:center
We're not pop idols
tryin' to win over fans.

00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:58.199 position:50% align:center
Why not just make 'em
all come to us instead?

00:10:58.283 --> 00:10:59.951 position:50% align:center
Because that would be
neglecting our duty

00:11:00.035 --> 00:11:01.786 position:50% align:center
as members of the
student council.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:03.830 position:50% align:center
How so?

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:06.750 position:50% align:center
We need to interact.

00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:09.586 position:50% align:center
Get out there and see first-hand
what these clubs are doing.

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:12.297 position:50% align:center
Our time isn't any more
valuable than theirs.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:13.923 position:50% align:center
The whole point of
the student council

00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:15.800 position:50% align:center
is to help our
fellow classmates.

00:11:15.884 --> 00:11:17.469 position:50% align:center
But we are helping them.

00:11:17.552 --> 00:11:19.346 position:50% align:center
You know, by
defending the school

00:11:19.429 --> 00:11:21.139 position:50% align:center
from evil villains and stuff.

00:11:21.222 --> 00:11:24.893 position:50% align:center
Just stop. The School Defense
Force isn't a real thing.

00:11:24.976 --> 00:11:26.353 position:50% align:center
And there are no
villains, either.

00:11:26.436 --> 00:11:28.104 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
There could be.

00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:29.773 position:50% align:center
Oh, Nabe!

00:11:29.856 --> 00:11:33.151 position:50% align:center
Whatcha screwin' around out here
for? Let's play some soccer.

00:11:33.234 --> 00:11:34.903 position:50% align:center
Hey, I'm not screwin' around.

00:11:34.986 --> 00:11:37.072 position:50% align:center
I'm on duty, here,
'kay? Watch it.

00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:39.741 position:50% align:center
Shouldn't you be doing club
activities right now?

00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:41.868 position:50% align:center
[SOCCER STUDENT A] Hah! That's
a good one, coming from you.

00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:43.620 position:50% align:center
[MANABE laughs]

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:45.622 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
It's exhausting.

00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:48.583 position:50% align:center
Working with him is
a constant struggle.

00:11:48.667 --> 00:11:51.586 position:50% align:center
He reminds me of my brother
in a lot of ways,

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:56.633 position:50% align:center
but he's also a
little... like him.

00:11:56.716 --> 00:12:01.262 position:50% align:center
And for some reason, people are
just naturally drawn to him.

00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:04.224 position:50% align:center
It's like he glows with
a light I don't have.

00:12:04.307 --> 00:12:08.937 position:50% align:center
So brightly... that I'm
eclipsed entirely.

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:13.066 position:50% align:center
No... way. It's gone.
I can't believe it's gone!

00:12:13.149 --> 00:12:14.943 position:50% align:center
This is an absolute tragedy.

00:12:15.026 --> 00:12:17.445 position:50% align:center
Who would do such a thing
to my masterpiece?!

00:12:17.529 --> 00:12:19.572 position:50% align:center
Um. What masterpiece?

00:12:19.656 --> 00:12:21.616 position:50% align:center
If you're talking about
that ridiculous sign,

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:23.326 position:50% align:center
I threw it in the garbage.

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:26.955 position:50% align:center
Short stack, hey.
So it was you, huh?

00:12:27.038 --> 00:12:29.374 position:50% align:center
Take this, weasel noggin!

00:12:29.457 --> 00:12:31.626 position:50% align:center
You are a disgrace to
the student council!

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:32.919 position:50% align:center
Now leave me alone!

00:12:33.003 --> 00:12:34.879 position:50% align:center
But what would be the fun
in that, neenerhead?

00:12:34.963 --> 00:12:36.881 position:50% align:center
[NAOHITO] And stop with
the nonsensical insults!

00:12:36.965 --> 00:12:38.967 position:50% align:center
[KIMI]
We're back, guys!

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:40.468 position:50% align:center
Check it out, Yun-Yun!

00:12:40.552 --> 00:12:44.097 position:50% align:center
A brand-new whiteboard,
exclusively for student council.

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:45.849 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Uh. How did you get it?

00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:47.434 position:50% align:center
Don't look so surprised.

00:12:47.517 --> 00:12:48.977 position:50% align:center
It wasn't a big
deal or anything.

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.938 position:50% align:center
I just asked my teacher really
nicely and he gave it to me.

00:12:52.022 --> 00:12:54.149 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Is he allowed to do that?

00:12:54.232 --> 00:12:57.527 position:50% align:center
[MANABE] Score! Way to use
those feminine wiles.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.487 position:50% align:center
Gettin' new stuff's
the best, am I right?

00:12:59.571 --> 00:13:02.157 position:50% align:center
We should have a meeting
and break this baby in.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.241 position:50% align:center
That reminds me!

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:04.034 position:50% align:center
There's something
I've been meaning

00:13:04.117 --> 00:13:05.535 position:50% align:center
to talk to you guys about.

00:13:05.618 --> 00:13:07.203 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:13:08.163 --> 00:13:10.582 position:50% align:center
Let's see.

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:14.085 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Oh, good.

00:13:14.169 --> 00:13:15.503 position:50% align:center
For a second there,
I was starting to worry

00:13:15.587 --> 00:13:18.214 position:50% align:center
this would be a complete
waste of our time.

00:13:18.298 --> 00:13:20.967 position:50% align:center
Right. Any color requests?
Spit 'em out, you guys.

00:13:21.051 --> 00:13:24.262 position:50% align:center
Shut up! I refuse to listen
to something so asinine!

00:13:24.346 --> 00:13:26.931 position:50% align:center
Whoa, hey. This is super
important stuff, here.

00:13:27.015 --> 00:13:28.350 position:50% align:center
Come on, Nao, you do
know you're part

00:13:28.433 --> 00:13:30.310 position:50% align:center
of the School Defense
Force, don't you?

00:13:30.393 --> 00:13:32.354 position:50% align:center
Jeez, man, get it together.

00:13:32.437 --> 00:13:35.065 position:50% align:center
[NAOHITO] Do you know that
you're the vice president?

00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:38.526 position:50% align:center
Well, Yun-Yun should obviously
be Red since he's our president.

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:40.779 position:50% align:center
Yeah! Give the girl
a prize! 'Kay.

00:13:40.862 --> 00:13:42.864 position:50% align:center
Uh. Is that how this works?

00:13:42.947 --> 00:13:45.492 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
And... I'll be taking Black.

00:13:45.575 --> 00:13:47.202 position:50% align:center
'Cause I'm cool and stoic.

00:13:47.285 --> 00:13:48.411 position:50% align:center
I appear out of nowhere

00:13:48.495 --> 00:13:50.163 position:50% align:center
when the other members
are in grave danger.

00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:52.707 position:50% align:center
Twig in the mouth and
sunset are optional.

00:13:52.791 --> 00:13:53.958 position:50% align:center
Grave danger?

00:13:54.042 --> 00:13:55.502 position:50% align:center
Did you say cool?

00:13:55.585 --> 00:13:58.338 position:50% align:center
Nao, you'll be Yellow,
'cause you like curry.

00:13:58.421 --> 00:13:59.798 position:50% align:center
[NAOHITO]
Don't pick for me!

00:13:59.881 --> 00:14:01.758 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Why curry?

00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:04.552 position:50% align:center
Okay, next let's
decide who's Pink.

00:14:04.636 --> 00:14:06.471 position:50% align:center
It's Machi or Kimi.
Who wants it?

00:14:06.554 --> 00:14:07.847 position:50% align:center
[KIMI gasps]

00:14:07.931 --> 00:14:09.099 position:50% align:center
Are you kidding?

00:14:09.182 --> 00:14:11.059 position:50% align:center
Come on, guys, how is
this even a question?

00:14:11.142 --> 00:14:12.977 position:50% align:center
Pink looks so much
better on Kimi.

00:14:13.061 --> 00:14:15.313 position:50% align:center
Plus, I like it. So it's mine!

00:14:15.397 --> 00:14:18.066 position:50% align:center
Um, Todo, calm down.

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:21.361 position:50% align:center
It's just a color--nothing
to get worked up about.

00:14:23.488 --> 00:14:26.700 position:50% align:center
[KIMI]
Why is Yun-Yun being so mean?!

00:14:26.783 --> 00:14:28.493 position:50% align:center
Refusing to call Kimi "Kimi"...

00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:31.788 position:50% align:center
Please don't cry! I'm sorry,
okay? I'll be nicer.

00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:33.039 position:50% align:center
Please, Kimi.

00:14:33.123 --> 00:14:35.166 position:50% align:center
This conversation is
beyond ridiculous!

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:36.668 position:50% align:center
Are you all total morons?

00:14:36.751 --> 00:14:39.629 position:50% align:center
The first one to call someone
a moron is the real moron.

00:14:39.713 --> 00:14:41.089 position:50% align:center
Moron. Ha!

[NAOHITO]
Well, a moron...

00:14:45.677 --> 00:14:46.678 position:50% align:center
I don't know if
it'll do any good,

00:14:46.761 --> 00:14:49.014 position:50% align:center
but you could try speaking up.

00:14:49.097 --> 00:14:51.099 position:50% align:center
Which of the colors would
you choose, Kuragi?

00:14:51.182 --> 00:14:52.517 position:50% align:center

...worst decision I ever made.

Come on, Kimi's just kidding...

00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:56.730 position:50% align:center

[MANABE]
That won't do, Yun-Yun.

00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:02.277 position:50% align:center
If Kimi gets first-name
treatment, so should Machi.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:06.531 position:50% align:center
So, Machi, you want him to
use your first name, too?

00:15:06.614 --> 00:15:09.784 position:50% align:center
It's easy. All you have to do
is ask nicely, like I did.

00:15:09.868 --> 00:15:12.078 position:50% align:center
Come on, go ahead.

00:15:12.162 --> 00:15:14.914 position:50% align:center
No! You really don't have
to do that, I promise!

00:15:14.998 --> 00:15:16.416 position:50% align:center
Kimi, leave her alone!

00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:19.002 position:50% align:center
[KIMI] She's fine. Anyway,
we all agree I'm Pink, right?

00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:21.463 position:50% align:center
This process is
unfair. I object.

00:15:21.546 --> 00:15:22.797 position:50% align:center
[KIMI]
It's totally fair.

00:15:22.881 --> 00:15:25.383 position:50% align:center
Didn't you hear Machi say
she wants to be Yellow?

00:15:25.467 --> 00:15:26.718 position:50% align:center
See? She's nodding.
She's even...

00:15:26.801 --> 00:15:28.803 position:50% align:center
Uh, you're being kinda rough.

00:15:28.887 --> 00:15:30.013 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
What should I do?

00:15:30.096 --> 00:15:31.514 position:50% align:center
I need to get things
under control.

Hey, let's settle down.

00:15:36.895 --> 00:15:40.482 position:50% align:center
Choosing colors is a stupid
thing to get worked up about.

00:15:40.565 --> 00:15:43.443 position:50% align:center
Seriously, why are
we even bothering

00:15:43.526 --> 00:15:45.820 position:50% align:center
with such a useless discussion
in the first place?

00:15:45.904 --> 00:15:48.239 position:50% align:center
What idiot suggested this?

00:15:51.117 --> 00:15:53.244 position:50% align:center
Oh! That's right. It was me.

00:15:53.328 --> 00:15:56.414 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry! I accept
full responsibility...

00:15:56.498 --> 00:15:59.501 position:50% align:center

That was a lotta
work, wasn't it?

00:16:08.343 --> 00:16:11.262 position:50% align:center
Not for you! You didn't
do any work at all!

Yun-Yun!

00:16:12.806 --> 00:16:14.432 position:50% align:center
See ya tomorrow, okay?

00:16:14.516 --> 00:16:16.267 position:50% align:center
Later! Be good.

00:16:16.351 --> 00:16:17.644 position:50% align:center

Yeah.

00:16:49.467 --> 00:16:50.969 position:50% align:center
[GARDEN STUDENT A]
Um, thanks.

00:16:51.052 --> 00:16:52.721 position:50% align:center
Are you sure you
don't mind helping?

00:16:52.804 --> 00:16:55.265 position:50% align:center
It's not like you're part
of the club or anything.

00:16:55.348 --> 00:16:56.683 position:50% align:center

It's no big deal.

You're short on people,
so I can chip in.

00:16:59.227 --> 00:17:01.479 position:50% align:center

they need to go, okay?

Yeah, trying to.

you usually walked home

Pretty much everybody
knows who she is.

has that effect.

What's she to you? You don't,
like, like her, do you?

00:17:35.263 --> 00:17:36.139 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Why do you ask?

00:17:36.222 --> 00:17:37.766 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Hmm.

00:17:37.849 --> 00:17:39.809 position:50% align:center
Well, I was just thinking,
if that is the case,

00:17:39.893 --> 00:17:42.479 position:50% align:center
then you're headin' for
some serious heartbreak.

00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:45.190 position:50% align:center
'Cause, you know, that guy
with the orange hair.

he's her boyfriend.

Hah, I knew it.

00:17:57.285 --> 00:17:58.411 position:50% align:center
That explains why he looks

00:17:58.495 --> 00:18:00.705 position:50% align:center
so much happier than
you all the time.

00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:01.998 position:50% align:center

Is that what you do?

of a good time?

lost it just now.

Okay, sure! Call me ignorant!

At least that's better
than being a know-it-all!

00:19:01.891 --> 00:19:03.309 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's what I am.

00:19:03.393 --> 00:19:05.520 position:50% align:center

I've always been!

Even though you were the
one I was yelling at,

00:19:08.773 --> 00:19:11.568 position:50% align:center
I was actually lecturing myself!

00:19:11.651 --> 00:19:14.529 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I constantly compare
myself to other people.

00:19:14.612 --> 00:19:17.866 position:50% align:center
Sometimes it feels like the
inferiority will swallow me,

00:19:17.949 --> 00:19:20.618 position:50% align:center

Looking at him,
so cool and confident,

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.415 position:50% align:center
a voice in my head whispers

00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:29.711 position:50% align:center
that maybe he would be
a better president.

00:19:29.794 --> 00:19:33.548 position:50% align:center
And it's so hard not
to just run away,

00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:37.177 position:50% align:center
when that voice follows
me everywhere I go.

[YUKI]
You're right.

00:19:41.514 --> 00:19:46.895 position:50% align:center
I lost it before. I was
out of line. I'm sorry.

[YUKI] The most difficult
person of all... is me.

Turns out I do have a
villain to fight: Myself.

The enemy I should
be focusing on...

00:20:02.994 --> 00:20:05.538 position:50% align:center
...is the one I carry inside.

00:20:17.258 --> 00:20:18.510 position:50% align:center
It's not something
I'm great with,

00:20:18.593 --> 00:20:22.013 position:50% align:center
so I end up hurting people.

by now, but I guess not.

I figured that much out already!

I'm not so sure.

00:21:14.774 --> 00:21:16.067 position:50% align:center
The whole point of
the student council

00:21:16.151 --> 00:21:17.944 position:50% align:center
is to help our
fellow classmates.

00:21:18.028 --> 00:21:19.571 position:50% align:center
Am I right?

killin' my motivation.

[YUKI] There will be conflict,
but if we can talk through it
