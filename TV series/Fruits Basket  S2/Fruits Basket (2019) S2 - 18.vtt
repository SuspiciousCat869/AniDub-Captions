[KISA]
Hey, Hiro- <i>chan</i> ?

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:15.181 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Huh?

00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:16.349 position:50% align:center
[KISA]
How's your mom doing?

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:20.020 position:50% align:center
Her belly must be
getting pretty big, huh?

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:22.063 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
I don't know. Not really.

00:00:22.147 --> 00:00:23.606 position:50% align:center
She's not that far along.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.233 position:50% align:center
I'm so excited!

00:00:25.316 --> 00:00:29.320 position:50% align:center
I wonder what it'll be.
A boy or a girl?

00:00:29.404 --> 00:00:33.241 position:50% align:center
Doesn't matter. All I care
about is that it's healthy.

00:00:33.324 --> 00:00:37.162 position:50% align:center
Of course. Me, too.
But why wouldn't it be?

00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:40.206 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
I'm sure it will be, but...

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.542 position:50% align:center
Come on, you've been around
my mom enough to know

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:45.420 position:50% align:center
how much of a klutz she is.

00:00:45.503 --> 00:00:46.671 position:50% align:center
Just the other day,

00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:48.048 position:50% align:center
she tripped and almost
fell flat on her face.

00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:51.426 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
Hiro! And Kisa, yay!

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:53.053 position:50% align:center
How was your day at school?

00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:55.889 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] I told you not to
run like that! Jeez, Mom!

00:00:55.972 --> 00:00:57.432 position:50% align:center
I must've said it
a hundred times,

00:00:57.515 --> 00:00:59.059 position:50% align:center
but you still won't
listen to me.

00:00:59.142 --> 00:01:00.935 position:50% align:center
I don't know why it's so
difficult for you to grasp,

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:03.188 position:50% align:center
but you need to be
extra careful right now.

00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:05.106 position:50% align:center
No running, frolicking,
or flitting about,

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.609 position:50% align:center
unaware of your surroundings,
do you understand me?

00:01:07.692 --> 00:01:08.985 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir!

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:11.946 position:50% align:center
[KISA] Um, we were just talking
about whether the baby

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.531 position:50% align:center
would be a boy or a girl.

00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:14.783 position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:17.369 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI]
Hmm... I couldn't say.

00:01:17.452 --> 00:01:21.247 position:50% align:center
We're curious, of course,
and we could find out now,

00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:22.540 position:50% align:center
but we're going to wait.

00:01:22.624 --> 00:01:24.376 position:50% align:center
We decided to
leave it a surprise

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:26.169 position:50% align:center
for when the baby's born.

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:28.880 position:50% align:center
You are, really? But why wait?

00:01:28.963 --> 00:01:31.800 position:50% align:center
Because we know that we're
going to be happy either way.

00:01:31.883 --> 00:01:35.720 position:50% align:center
Boy or girl, it won't change
how much we'll love this baby.

00:01:35.804 --> 00:01:38.807 position:50% align:center
Really, I just hope
it's as kind as Hiro is.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.309 position:50% align:center
Thanks, but I wouldn't
describe myself as kind.

00:01:41.393 --> 00:01:43.520 position:50% align:center
Don't be silly, yes, you are!

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:46.356 position:50% align:center
Right, Kisa? He'd make a
wonderful husband, wouldn't he?

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.608 position:50% align:center
Ah! Mom, please!

00:01:48.692 --> 00:01:52.404 position:50% align:center
Could we talk about literally
anything else right now? Uh.

00:01:52.487 --> 00:01:55.031 position:50% align:center
[SATSUKI] Now, dear, why don't
you come in for a little snack?

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:56.574 position:50% align:center
[KISA]
Sure. Thanks!

00:01:56.658 --> 00:01:58.785 position:50% align:center
Go on. I'll join
you in a minute.

00:01:58.868 --> 00:02:02.122 position:50% align:center
Uh, Hiro. What's wrong?

00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:03.540 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Rin!

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:06.668 position:50% align:center
Wait up a sec. Looks like
you went to school today.

00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:09.462 position:50% align:center
I haven't seen you around
in a long time. You okay?

00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:11.881 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:14.676 position:50% align:center
Hey, you don't look well.

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:16.928 position:50% align:center
Rin, your face is so pale.

00:02:17.012 --> 00:02:18.680 position:50% align:center
Have you been eating?

00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:22.976 position:50% align:center
Why do you always insist
on worrying about me?

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:24.602 position:50% align:center
Do you feel responsible somehow

00:02:24.686 --> 00:02:26.604 position:50% align:center
because you were there
when it happened?

00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:29.024 position:50% align:center
Just let it go.

00:02:29.107 --> 00:02:32.986 position:50% align:center
Enjoy your peaceful life
with your loving parents

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.654 position:50% align:center
and leave me alone.

00:02:34.738 --> 00:02:39.743 position:50% align:center
It sounds like you blame me
for having those things.

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:41.911 position:50% align:center
You say it as if
it's a bad thing--

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:45.832 position:50% align:center
for somebody to be loved
by their own parents.

00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:49.836 position:50% align:center
Like wanting that kind of
life is frivolous or wrong.

00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:53.173 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.136 position:50% align:center
No, wait! You didn't
learn anything, did you?

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:00.972 position:50% align:center
You're trying so
hard on your own,

00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:03.767 position:50% align:center
but even Shigure
didn't know, right?

00:03:04.893 --> 00:03:09.898 position:50% align:center
So it's true, then.
There's no way.

00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:12.317 position:50% align:center
No way to break the curse.

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:51.750 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Tell me.

00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:55.295 position:50% align:center
Please, Gure.
You know, don't you?

00:04:55.378 --> 00:04:58.048 position:50% align:center
The way to break
the zodiac curse?

00:04:58.131 --> 00:05:01.134 position:50% align:center
What on earth makes you think I
would know something like that?

00:05:01.217 --> 00:05:02.719 position:50% align:center
How Akito treats you.

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:06.014 position:50% align:center
You're like a confidant.
A trusted favorite.

00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:08.058 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Ha. Is that what I am?

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:11.644 position:50% align:center
A "trusted favorite"?
Hah. Good one.

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:15.857 position:50% align:center
And given my exalted status,
I should know all the secrets?

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.192 position:50% align:center
Let's say you're right.

00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:19.444 position:50% align:center
Why should I reveal
something like that

00:05:19.527 --> 00:05:21.696 position:50% align:center
and risk Akito's wrath?

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.699 position:50% align:center
What do you have to offer?

00:05:24.783 --> 00:05:27.285 position:50% align:center
The only thing I have
to give is myself.

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:29.120 position:50% align:center
That's what I offer.

00:05:29.204 --> 00:05:31.414 position:50% align:center
Do whatever you want with me.

00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:34.918 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
How desperate you are.

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:38.046 position:50% align:center
All for Hatsuharu's sake.

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:41.466 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately for you, if there
is a way to break the curse,

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:42.717 position:50% align:center
I don't know it.

00:05:42.801 --> 00:05:44.135 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU gasps]

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:46.429 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] I warned you I
wouldn't meet your expectations.

00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:50.225 position:50% align:center
Liar! You're lying!
Don't screw with me!

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:51.935 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
I'm not lying, Rin.

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:54.062 position:50% align:center
If you're looking for
somebody to help you,

00:05:54.145 --> 00:05:57.524 position:50% align:center
I'm quite possibly the last
man you should be asking.

00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:00.443 position:50% align:center
I'm no one's "favorite."

00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:03.655 position:50% align:center
Akito doesn't put more trust
in me than in the others.

00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:06.491 position:50% align:center
I deserve no
special recognition.

00:06:06.574 --> 00:06:09.994 position:50% align:center
In fact, I'm weak,
unsympathetic,

00:06:10.078 --> 00:06:14.457 position:50% align:center
utterly worthless--
the worst kind of man.

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:16.501 position:50% align:center
If you really want an answer,

00:06:16.584 --> 00:06:19.212 position:50% align:center
I would recommend
seeking it elsewhere.

00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:21.256 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
But where, Gure?

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:23.550 position:50% align:center
Who else would know?

00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:28.054 position:50% align:center
Well, I suppose you could try
petitioning the god in person.

00:06:28.138 --> 00:06:29.723 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Don't you care?

00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:32.308 position:50% align:center
Don't you wanna
break the curse?

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:35.603 position:50% align:center
I'll leave that to those
who feel the strongest about it.

00:06:35.687 --> 00:06:39.441 position:50% align:center
You do the work;
I'll just watch.

00:06:39.524 --> 00:06:43.153 position:50% align:center
And benefit from all
your effort, of course.

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:47.365 position:50% align:center
As I said, Rin...
I really am the worst.

00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:52.078 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
I don't believe him.

00:06:52.162 --> 00:06:55.957 position:50% align:center
There's something he's not
telling me. I can feel it.

00:06:58.877 --> 00:07:00.337 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Still no luck.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.965 position:50% align:center
No documents.
No sign of anything useful.

00:07:04.049 --> 00:07:06.509 position:50% align:center
I've been looking through
this stuff forever.

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:10.263 position:50% align:center
Maybe it's in storage somewhere.

00:07:10.347 --> 00:07:13.892 position:50% align:center
That liar. He knows more
than he's letting on.

00:07:13.975 --> 00:07:17.062 position:50% align:center
It feels like he's
hiding something.

00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:18.521 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:23.651 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
I feel sick.

00:07:23.735 --> 00:07:27.489 position:50% align:center
The way Gure lives...
it's like nothing can touch him.

00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:30.575 position:50% align:center
Like there's nothing in
the world that he fears.

00:07:30.658 --> 00:07:34.496 position:50% align:center
I suppose you could try
petitioning the god in person.

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:37.415 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
I spend my life scared to death.

00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:42.879 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
I... I wish...

00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:47.926 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU] I wish I could've
been born as your heart.

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:51.888 position:50% align:center
Then I'd always be with you,
wherever you went.

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:55.141 position:50% align:center
And I'd die when you died.

00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:59.020 position:50% align:center
But then, we wouldn't
be able to kiss.

00:07:59.104 --> 00:08:00.605 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Haru.

00:08:01.606 --> 00:08:04.609 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Haru. But what will I--?

00:08:04.693 --> 00:08:07.278 position:50% align:center
Just stop talking.
We don't want you.

00:08:07.362 --> 00:08:08.446 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.240 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
I fell asleep?

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:13.368 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. What time is it?

00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:15.036 position:50% align:center
I feel sick.

00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:18.581 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU] It's getting
worse with every step.

00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:21.584 position:50% align:center
Maybe I'm still dreaming.

00:08:22.627 --> 00:08:24.045 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:29.634 --> 00:08:33.054 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Oh... this dream sucks.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.479 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU] It's the same
nightmare I always have.

00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:45.400 position:50% align:center
I need to get up.
I need to wake up.

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:47.569 position:50% align:center
To put an end to it.

00:08:47.652 --> 00:08:50.905 position:50% align:center
To put an end to it all.

00:08:54.242 --> 00:08:55.827 position:50% align:center
Hey, Gure?

00:08:59.414 --> 00:09:02.542 position:50% align:center
Um, Gure, are you here?

00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:04.002 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:09:05.462 --> 00:09:08.340 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Crap! I'm going to be sick.

00:09:08.423 --> 00:09:11.426 position:50% align:center
No! They'll yell at me again!

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:13.762 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:25.023 position:50% align:center
[gasps] What's wrong?

00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:29.694 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU] Don't yell at me.
Don't yell at me.

00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:31.446 position:50% align:center
Don't yell at me!
Don't yell at me!

00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:33.490 position:50% align:center
Don't yell at me!
Don't yell at me!

00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:36.451 position:50% align:center
Don't yell at me!
Don't yell at me!

00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:41.748 position:50% align:center
Mama. Papa. Don't yell at me.

00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:45.794 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
A happy family.

00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:50.507 position:50% align:center
[REN] You have such a happy
family, don't you, Isuzu?

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:56.054 position:50% align:center
A kind father. A caring mother.
They both love you so much.

00:09:56.137 --> 00:09:58.598 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I love them both, too.

00:09:58.682 --> 00:10:00.308 position:50% align:center
A bunch!

00:10:00.392 --> 00:10:05.188 position:50% align:center
It seems hard for the other
zodiac spirits, but not for me.

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:07.774 position:50% align:center
You and Daddy are different
from other parents.

00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:10.235 position:50% align:center
We always have fun together.

00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:14.280 position:50% align:center
You're both always smiling,
and you seem so happy.

00:10:14.364 --> 00:10:17.701 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
It was almost too perfect.

00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:20.036 position:50% align:center
Like I was part of a play.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.246 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU'S PARENTS laughing]

00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:24.124 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU] But why? Why are
you always so happy?

00:10:24.207 --> 00:10:26.626 position:50% align:center
Always having a good time?

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:31.381 position:50% align:center
Do you ever stop smiling?
Doesn't anything make you sad?

00:10:32.882 --> 00:10:34.426 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
That's all it took.

00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:36.177 position:50% align:center
A few simple questions.

00:10:36.261 --> 00:10:37.637 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU'S MOTHER yells]

00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:39.264 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU'S MOTHER] Who do you
think we're doing it for?

00:10:39.347 --> 00:10:42.767 position:50% align:center
Who do you think we're working
so hard for day in and day out?

00:10:42.851 --> 00:10:45.228 position:50% align:center
Don't you dare talk back to us!

00:10:48.023 --> 00:10:51.776 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU] The play I'd been
living came to an end.

00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:59.200 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Mama... Papa... I'm sorry.

00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:01.286 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry.

00:11:02.245 --> 00:11:03.747 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:12.172 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
They'd hated me all along.

00:11:12.255 --> 00:11:16.301 position:50% align:center
I was a burden--weighing
down their lives.

00:11:16.384 --> 00:11:17.969 position:50% align:center
But they tried.

00:11:18.053 --> 00:11:23.391 position:50% align:center
They tried and tried, until they
became exhausted and snapped.

00:11:23.475 --> 00:11:26.519 position:50% align:center
After that, there
was no going back.

00:11:26.603 --> 00:11:30.357 position:50% align:center
They told me...
they didn't want me.

00:11:32.275 --> 00:11:34.319 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
I'm scared.

00:11:34.402 --> 00:11:37.530 position:50% align:center
Haru, I'm scared.

00:11:37.614 --> 00:11:41.451 position:50% align:center
What do I do?
I'm scared to death.

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:49.125 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU] I would stand in front
of that house, hoping, praying.

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:52.545 position:50% align:center
Would they be in a good mood?

00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:57.342 position:50% align:center
If not, I would just
try to wait it out.

00:11:57.425 --> 00:12:02.806 position:50% align:center
Like a stone... an object
that feels nothing.

00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:07.435 position:50% align:center
I would go on like that until
the day they finally forgave me.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.192 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU] They'd forgive
me, wouldn't they?

00:12:16.444 --> 00:12:20.198 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU] We'd go back...
to the way it was.

00:12:25.662 --> 00:12:30.583 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's a relief.
You're conscious.

00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:32.460 position:50% align:center
Hang on. Be right
back. Sensei....

00:12:32.544 --> 00:12:35.964 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Haru. It's Haru.

00:12:36.047 --> 00:12:38.883 position:50% align:center
Feels like forever
since I've seen him.

00:12:40.844 --> 00:12:43.888 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU] We played together
a lot when I was younger,

00:12:43.972 --> 00:12:46.016 position:50% align:center
before everything fell apart.

00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:50.061 position:50% align:center
I told him I liked his hair--
how soft and white it was.

00:12:50.145 --> 00:12:52.939 position:50% align:center
The look on his
face was adorable.

00:12:55.859 --> 00:12:57.068 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR A]
She's injured in places

00:12:57.152 --> 00:12:59.529 position:50% align:center
that are normally kept covered.

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:01.740 position:50% align:center
Things wouldn't have gotten
so bad if those around her

00:13:01.823 --> 00:13:04.284 position:50% align:center
had been paying
closer attention.

00:13:06.494 --> 00:13:10.582 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] Hi there, Isuzu.
How are you feeling?

00:13:10.665 --> 00:13:11.833 position:50% align:center
Who are you?

00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:13.460 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Kazuma Soma.

00:13:13.543 --> 00:13:14.794 position:50% align:center
But I guess you might
know me better

00:13:14.878 --> 00:13:17.339 position:50% align:center
as Kyo Soma's adoptive father.

00:13:17.422 --> 00:13:18.548 position:50% align:center
Do you remember?

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:21.509 position:50% align:center
Hatsuharu found you
lying on the street.

00:13:21.593 --> 00:13:22.552 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:23.928 position:50% align:center
I can't stay here
in the hospital!

00:13:24.012 --> 00:13:25.680 position:50% align:center
I have to get back
home, right now!

00:13:25.764 --> 00:13:27.599 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
We've contacted your parents.

00:13:27.682 --> 00:13:29.768 position:50% align:center
I'm concerned about the
number of injuries you have,

00:13:29.851 --> 00:13:31.811 position:50% align:center
and I would like to
hear their explanation.

00:13:31.895 --> 00:13:35.982 position:50% align:center
Huh? But... But why?

00:13:36.066 --> 00:13:37.817 position:50% align:center
You don't need to
do that, really.

00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:40.862 position:50% align:center
Don't ask them anything!
Leave us alone!

00:13:40.945 --> 00:13:44.783 position:50% align:center
It wasn't them!
It's my fault, I swear!

00:13:44.866 --> 00:13:46.368 position:50% align:center
I have to go home!

00:13:46.451 --> 00:13:47.827 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU'S MOTHER]
No, you don't.

00:13:47.911 --> 00:13:50.997 position:50% align:center
You don't ever need
to come home.

00:13:51.081 --> 00:13:52.791 position:50% align:center
Go somewhere else.

00:13:52.874 --> 00:13:55.043 position:50% align:center
Someplace I'll never
have to see you again.

00:13:55.126 --> 00:13:57.295 position:50% align:center
This isn't going to work.

00:13:57.379 --> 00:13:59.714 position:50% align:center
I don't know how I'm
supposed to love you.

00:13:59.798 --> 00:14:02.092 position:50% align:center
I can't anymore.

00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:03.385 position:50% align:center
[DOCTOR A]
Let's talk outside.

00:14:03.468 --> 00:14:06.471 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
No, wait. I'm really sorry!

00:14:06.554 --> 00:14:09.391 position:50% align:center
I promise I'll be more careful.

00:14:09.474 --> 00:14:11.559 position:50% align:center
I... promise!

00:14:11.643 --> 00:14:15.146 position:50% align:center
Mama, Papa, don't leave me!

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:18.566 position:50% align:center
Mama. Papa.

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:21.111 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry.

00:14:21.194 --> 00:14:24.864 position:50% align:center
Just stop talking.
We don't want you.

00:14:31.788 --> 00:14:33.206 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Seriously?

00:14:33.289 --> 00:14:36.042 position:50% align:center
How can you say something like
that to your own daughter?

00:14:36.126 --> 00:14:38.086 position:50% align:center
What kind of parents are you?

00:14:38.169 --> 00:14:40.714 position:50% align:center
A kid can't cope
with crap like that.

00:14:40.797 --> 00:14:43.425 position:50% align:center
She blames herself for
the things that <i>you</i> did.

00:14:43.508 --> 00:14:45.343 position:50% align:center
She's hurt so badly
she ended up here,

00:14:45.427 --> 00:14:47.512 position:50% align:center
and you don't even
feel bad at all?

00:14:47.595 --> 00:14:50.682 position:50% align:center
Adults take their anger
out on us, laugh at us,

00:14:50.765 --> 00:14:53.393 position:50% align:center
they hit us and neglect us,
and it hurts!

00:14:53.476 --> 00:14:55.979 position:50% align:center
We feel pain just
like you do, morons!

00:14:56.062 --> 00:14:58.732 position:50% align:center
Why can't you understand
something so simple?!

00:14:58.815 --> 00:15:00.692 position:50% align:center
Come back! Apologize!

00:15:00.775 --> 00:15:01.860 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Haru.

00:15:01.943 --> 00:15:03.862 position:50% align:center
Apologize to Rin!
Tell her you're sorry!

00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:07.032 position:50% align:center
Hey! Don't just
walk away from her!

00:15:11.286 --> 00:15:13.747 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Haru.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:15.498 position:50% align:center
Haru.

00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:20.503 position:50% align:center
Thank you... so much.

00:15:25.633 --> 00:15:27.177 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU] My parents never
came to visit me

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.304 position:50% align:center
at the hospital after that,

00:15:29.387 --> 00:15:32.682 position:50% align:center
and I never returned to the
house we used to share.

00:15:34.684 --> 00:15:38.772 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU] They walked out
and took my home with them.

00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:46.446 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU] It was decided that
I would live at Kagura's,

00:15:46.529 --> 00:15:50.992 position:50% align:center
but trying to become part of a
household that wasn't broken...

00:15:51.076 --> 00:15:54.579 position:50% align:center
...only made my chest ache.

00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:56.831 position:50% align:center
How did we wind up here?

00:15:56.915 --> 00:15:59.918 position:50% align:center
What did I do wrong?

00:16:00.001 --> 00:16:04.339 position:50% align:center
Was it always going to be this
way no matter what I did?

00:16:04.422 --> 00:16:08.093 position:50% align:center
Was the problem that I
never should've been born?

00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:11.262 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
And then,

00:16:11.346 --> 00:16:14.974 position:50% align:center
before those questions
could bury me completely...

00:16:15.058 --> 00:16:18.687 position:50% align:center
Come on. Let's walk.

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:20.647 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
...Haru appeared.

00:16:22.148 --> 00:16:24.192 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Here, want some?

00:16:25.652 --> 00:16:26.986 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:16:28.196 --> 00:16:31.116 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
He came to visit me a lot.

00:16:31.199 --> 00:16:35.203 position:50% align:center
I didn't mind being around him.

00:16:35.286 --> 00:16:39.124 position:50% align:center
There was nothing painful
about spending time with him.

00:16:40.125 --> 00:16:43.003 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
How's middle school? Having fun?

00:16:43.086 --> 00:16:45.422 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
It's sorta... annoying?

00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:48.758 position:50% align:center
They have a problem with my
hair and attitude, I guess.

00:16:48.842 --> 00:16:50.593 position:50% align:center
So I've got no other choice.

00:16:50.677 --> 00:16:53.263 position:50% align:center
Looks like I need to get
some piercings, too.

00:16:53.346 --> 00:16:54.931 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU chuckles]

00:16:55.015 --> 00:17:00.228 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU] You know... you have
a strange sense of logic.

00:17:00.311 --> 00:17:03.773 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Haru was weird and kind.

00:17:03.857 --> 00:17:06.484 position:50% align:center
I thought I might fall
in love with him.

00:17:06.568 --> 00:17:10.071 position:50% align:center
Maybe... I already had.

00:17:11.322 --> 00:17:14.242 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Rin, do you wanna kiss?

00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:15.952 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:16.036 --> 00:17:18.496 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Um, why?

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:19.956 position:50% align:center
'Cause I love you.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.042 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:22.125 --> 00:17:25.795 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU] We can't.
Akito would be furious.

00:17:25.879 --> 00:17:27.088 position:50% align:center
I know.

00:17:27.172 --> 00:17:28.298 position:50% align:center
But I couldn't stand it

00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:30.967 position:50% align:center
if I lost you to another
guy 'cause of that.

00:17:31.051 --> 00:17:33.595 position:50% align:center
Is that the problem?
There already someone else?

00:17:33.678 --> 00:17:35.597 position:50% align:center
No. Of course not.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.682 position:50% align:center
Haru, you're the one I love.

00:17:37.766 --> 00:17:39.517 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:39.601 --> 00:17:42.520 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU] I love you.
I can't live without you.

00:17:42.604 --> 00:17:46.274 position:50% align:center
If you weren't in my life,
insecurity would destroy me.

00:17:46.358 --> 00:17:48.068 position:50% align:center
It has to be you.

00:17:48.151 --> 00:17:51.071 position:50% align:center
The one I lean on
and cling to...

00:17:51.154 --> 00:17:53.740 position:50% align:center
I want you. I want all of you.

00:17:53.823 --> 00:17:57.077 position:50% align:center
My desire only keeps
getting stronger.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:01.289 position:50% align:center
I'm worried someday these
feelings will crush you.

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:04.876 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Haru, what would I do

00:18:04.959 --> 00:18:08.088 position:50% align:center
if you came to hate me
and walked away?

00:18:09.464 --> 00:18:11.424 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU] You think I
just feel sorry for you?

00:18:11.508 --> 00:18:13.009 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
No.

00:18:13.093 --> 00:18:14.552 position:50% align:center
That's not it.

00:18:14.636 --> 00:18:16.179 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
I love you.

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:19.140 position:50% align:center
I want you and no one else.

00:18:19.224 --> 00:18:21.976 position:50% align:center
Unless you don't want me.

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:23.895 position:50% align:center
Is that what you're saying?

00:18:28.483 --> 00:18:32.946 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU] I loved him
so much I lost control.

00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:37.826 position:50% align:center
I knew we shouldn't do it,
but I didn't wanna let him go.

00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:40.078 position:50% align:center
I'm just that twisted.

00:18:41.454 --> 00:18:42.789 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Is it true?

00:18:42.872 --> 00:18:46.209 position:50% align:center
What I've heard about you
and Hatsuharu dating?

00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:48.420 position:50% align:center
You're always so impassive,

00:18:48.503 --> 00:18:51.047 position:50% align:center
but when you want
something, you pounce.

00:18:51.131 --> 00:18:53.091 position:50% align:center
It's frightening.

00:18:53.174 --> 00:18:57.220 position:50% align:center
This is why I despise women.
Devious creatures.

00:18:57.303 --> 00:19:00.265 position:50% align:center
And that mane-like hair of
yours only makes it worse.

00:19:00.348 --> 00:19:02.559 position:50% align:center
It's repulsive.

00:19:03.727 --> 00:19:05.603 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
I'm scared of Akito.

00:19:05.687 --> 00:19:08.857 position:50% align:center
Defiance is impossible.

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:12.569 position:50% align:center
I can only tremble and cower.

00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:14.237 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
So, tell me.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:17.073 position:50% align:center
Who made the first move
in this little dance?

00:19:17.157 --> 00:19:20.285 position:50% align:center
Was it him... or you?

00:19:20.368 --> 00:19:23.955 position:50% align:center
Which of you will
incur my displeasure?

00:19:24.039 --> 00:19:28.335 position:50% align:center
When I'm in a rage, everything
around me seems to vanish.

00:19:28.418 --> 00:19:31.629 position:50% align:center
Hatori's left eye
was one casualty.

00:19:31.713 --> 00:19:32.505 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:32.589 --> 00:19:35.008 position:50% align:center
It was me. I did it!

00:19:35.091 --> 00:19:38.219 position:50% align:center
Obviously, I was the one
who seduced him.

00:19:50.815 --> 00:19:53.485 position:50% align:center
I really do despise women.

00:19:53.568 --> 00:19:56.237 position:50% align:center
Brazen and stupid.

00:19:56.321 --> 00:19:59.449 position:50% align:center
Attempting to take one of my
possessions for your own.

00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:03.453 position:50% align:center
Wait, don't tell me you
thought you succeeded.

00:20:03.536 --> 00:20:05.205 position:50% align:center
Are you listening?

00:20:05.288 --> 00:20:08.416 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU whimpering]

00:20:13.296 --> 00:20:14.130 position:50% align:center
[AKITO laughs]

00:20:14.214 --> 00:20:16.383 position:50% align:center
Yes, I see it now.

00:20:16.466 --> 00:20:18.510 position:50% align:center
Just look at you.

00:20:18.593 --> 00:20:19.427 position:50% align:center
[AKITO laughs]

00:20:19.511 --> 00:20:21.221 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
You're pathetic!

00:20:21.304 --> 00:20:22.931 position:50% align:center
[AKITO laughs]

00:20:23.014 --> 00:20:27.560 position:50% align:center
It's true. You're
completely worthless.

00:20:27.644 --> 00:20:32.232 position:50% align:center
You might as well give up.
Not even Hatsuharu can save you.

00:20:32.315 --> 00:20:36.403 position:50% align:center
Your twisted desperation
will consume him.

00:20:36.486 --> 00:20:39.447 position:50% align:center
Idiot, don't you see
how worthless you are?

00:20:39.531 --> 00:20:40.907 position:50% align:center
Haven't you realized?

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:43.660 position:50% align:center
You're only here to make
the numbers match up.

00:20:43.743 --> 00:20:46.579 position:50% align:center
Wake up! Get that through
your thick skull!

00:20:46.663 --> 00:20:48.998 position:50% align:center
I don't want you.

00:20:49.082 --> 00:20:50.917 position:50% align:center
We don't want you.

00:20:57.549 --> 00:20:58.883 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:04.889 --> 00:21:06.391 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
He did, though.

00:21:06.474 --> 00:21:08.518 position:50% align:center
Haru wanted me.

00:21:10.311 --> 00:21:13.064 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU] When everyone
else said they didn't,

00:21:13.148 --> 00:21:16.776 position:50% align:center
there was still
someone who wanted me.

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.987 position:50% align:center
It made me happy.

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:22.032 position:50% align:center
Happier than I ever
thought I could be.

00:21:22.115 --> 00:21:26.703 position:50% align:center
For a little while...
I was free.

00:21:26.786 --> 00:21:31.166 position:50% align:center
Thank you for giving me that.

00:21:31.249 --> 00:21:34.127 position:50% align:center
But... it's enough.

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:38.048 position:50% align:center
It's enough, Haru. Let me go.

00:21:38.131 --> 00:21:40.759 position:50% align:center
It's your turn to be happy.

00:21:42.844 --> 00:21:46.348 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
I'll free you... from me.

00:21:48.016 --> 00:21:49.851 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
From Akito.

00:21:53.355 --> 00:21:55.732 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU] I want to release
you from all the shackles

00:21:55.815 --> 00:21:58.568 position:50% align:center
that weigh you down.

00:21:58.651 --> 00:22:02.072 position:50% align:center
Haru, you deserve more.

00:22:02.155 --> 00:22:06.576 position:50% align:center
I know your true happiness
lies beyond here.

00:22:09.245 --> 00:22:12.916 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU] I'll search
for it. I'll find it.

00:22:15.377 --> 00:22:17.712 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
I'll free you.

00:22:17.796 --> 00:22:23.009 position:50% align:center
And I'm okay if that means...
I'll have nothing in the end.

00:23:57.103 --> 00:23:59.189 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
"There's just no way!"
