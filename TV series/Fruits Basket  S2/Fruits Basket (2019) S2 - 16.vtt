[MOMIJI'S FATHER] I'm not
telling you to quit playing.

00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:17.726 position:50% align:center
I just don't think it's
a good idea for you two

00:00:17.809 --> 00:00:21.479 position:50% align:center
to have the same
teacher, that's all.

00:00:21.563 --> 00:00:25.859 position:50% align:center
The thing is, I'm worried
Momo's taken notice of you.

00:00:27.986 --> 00:00:31.322 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI'S FATHER] I'm sorry.
I really am, Momiji.

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:35.577 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Why?

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.040 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Why is it like this?

00:02:12.048 --> 00:02:13.216 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Here I am.

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:17.387 position:50% align:center
Another visit to
the Soma compound.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.848 position:50% align:center
Okay. Forward, march!

00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:21.975 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU whimpers]

00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:24.686 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Nope! Too scared!

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.980 position:50% align:center
I'll do another lap
to calm myself down.

00:02:27.063 --> 00:02:30.775 position:50% align:center
I just need a little more time.

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:33.153 position:50% align:center
As for why I'm here
in the first place,

00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:36.781 position:50% align:center
it all started with a
conversation at school.

00:02:36.865 --> 00:02:38.658 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Uo- <i>chan</i> !

00:02:38.742 --> 00:02:40.076 position:50% align:center
Is it really true?

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.953 position:50% align:center
Did you quit all of
your part-time jobs

00:02:42.037 --> 00:02:43.329 position:50% align:center
and get a new one?

00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:46.041 position:50% align:center
Sure did. I'm at
a restaurant now.

00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:48.626 position:50% align:center
Um, but if you're working
somewhere else, then--

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.171 position:50% align:center
Yeah, the chances of me ever
bumping into him again

00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:53.631 position:50% align:center
are slim to none.

00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:58.219 position:50% align:center
It's a big change, but...
I felt like I was going crazy.

00:02:58.303 --> 00:03:00.764 position:50% align:center
Whenever a customer came in,
I'd hope it was him.

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:02.974 position:50% align:center
It just wasn't like me.

00:03:03.058 --> 00:03:06.895 position:50% align:center
I mean, since when do I act
like a lovesick puppy?

00:03:06.978 --> 00:03:08.521 position:50% align:center
Guess I couldn't
take being on edge

00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:11.358 position:50% align:center
all the time anymore, ya know?

00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:13.902 position:50% align:center
If you knew his name,
you could track him down.

00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:16.988 position:50% align:center
Oh, my bad. I really
didn't tell you?

00:03:17.072 --> 00:03:17.989 position:50% align:center
His name's Kureno.

00:03:18.073 --> 00:03:19.115 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.826 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Wait... Kureno?

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.245 position:50% align:center
Do you mean... Kureno Soma?

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:25.288 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:27.165 position:50% align:center
You know him?!

00:03:27.248 --> 00:03:30.001 position:50% align:center
Seriously?! Soma,
like Kyon's family?!

00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:31.670 position:50% align:center
What was he like?!
Where'd you meet him?!

00:03:31.753 --> 00:03:33.380 position:50% align:center
Talk! Right now!

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:34.839 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I met him during summer break

00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:36.758 position:50% align:center
at the Soma vacation house.

00:03:36.841 --> 00:03:38.385 position:50% align:center
It was just for
a second, though.

00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:41.763 position:50% align:center
Tall and handsome, with
pretty brown hair and eyes?

00:03:41.846 --> 00:03:45.975 position:50% align:center
I guess I'd say he was
cool and collected.

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:48.728 position:50% align:center
Nah, you've got
a different guy.

00:03:48.812 --> 00:03:51.564 position:50% align:center
The Kureno that I know
is a total space cadet.

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:54.275 position:50% align:center
He wouldn't realize if
he stepped in dog crap.

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.569 position:50% align:center
[HANAJIMA]
Arisa, was that the best example

00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:58.071 position:50% align:center
you could come up with?

00:03:58.154 --> 00:03:59.531 position:50% align:center
You could be wrong.

00:03:59.614 --> 00:04:02.283 position:50% align:center
Surely there's still a chance
they're the same person.

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:04.953 position:50% align:center
Isn't it at least
worth finding out?

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:07.664 position:50% align:center
Maybe I could ask around
and see if he's--

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:09.332 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
No.

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:12.961 position:50% align:center
Don't bother, 'kay?
I'm sure it's not him.

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:15.130 position:50% align:center
Sorry for whining about it.

00:04:15.213 --> 00:04:16.715 position:50% align:center
And thanks.

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:19.801 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Uo- <i>chan</i> .

00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:25.890 position:50% align:center
[KYO] Kureno? Don't really
know much about him, either.

00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:27.809 position:50% align:center
I can tell you that
he's Akito's assistant,

00:04:27.892 --> 00:04:30.937 position:50% align:center
but that's pretty much all
the info I've got on him.

00:04:31.021 --> 00:04:33.648 position:50% align:center
He doesn't come out of the main
Soma compound very often,

00:04:33.732 --> 00:04:36.985 position:50% align:center
and he doesn't interact with
the other zodiac members.

00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:39.446 position:50% align:center
He's never said a
word to me before.

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:43.450 position:50% align:center
I see. Thanks anyway.

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:45.577 position:50% align:center
[KYO] So what's got you
asking about Kureno?

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:46.995 position:50% align:center
Ah! Oh! Nothing, really.

00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:48.830 position:50% align:center
I mean, he is one of
the zodiac members,

00:04:48.913 --> 00:04:52.334 position:50% align:center
so obviously I'm curious about
him because of that, you know?

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:56.463 position:50% align:center
Be careful. Don't get yourself
into trouble for no reason.

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:59.841 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
You don't get it, Kyo.

00:04:59.924 --> 00:05:02.969 position:50% align:center
Someone important to me
is hurting right now.

00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:07.182 position:50% align:center
As far as I'm concerned,
that's the only reason I need.

00:05:07.265 --> 00:05:10.810 position:50% align:center
Can I really show up out of
nowhere asking to see him?

00:05:10.894 --> 00:05:12.771 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Hi! It's Tohru Honda.

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:15.523 position:50% align:center
I'd like to speak
to Kureno, please.

00:05:15.607 --> 00:05:18.193 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I shouldn't. Really.

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:21.529 position:50% align:center
But... But...

00:05:21.613 --> 00:05:23.490 position:50% align:center
That look.

00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:26.701 position:50% align:center
The man she wants to see
is still in this world.

00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:29.245 position:50% align:center
So if there's even the
slightest possibility...

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:31.581 position:50% align:center
Yes! I have to try!

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:33.625 position:50% align:center
--[gasps]

00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:36.586 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Is that... a violin?

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.091 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] I wonder who in
there is playing it.

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:44.135 position:50% align:center
It sounds sad somehow.

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:45.345 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:45.428 --> 00:05:47.222 position:50% align:center
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry!

00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:48.973 position:50% align:center
I wasn't watching
where I was going.

00:05:49.057 --> 00:05:51.768 position:50% align:center
Are you okay? I'll feel
awful if you're hurt!

Hold on. You're...

00:05:57.148 --> 00:05:58.358 position:50% align:center
You're Momiji--

00:05:58.441 --> 00:05:59.067 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.068 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Careful!

00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:01.277 position:50% align:center
Momo's not supposed to know

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:04.114 position:50% align:center
that she's actually
Momiji's little sister.

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:09.577 position:50% align:center
You said... "Momiji."
Are you friends?

00:06:09.661 --> 00:06:12.789 position:50% align:center
Did you come... to see him?

00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:15.166 position:50% align:center
Um. Yes.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.377 position:50% align:center
I mean, he is a friend
of mine, but...

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.631 position:50% align:center
Come on. I can help you. Here.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.759 position:50% align:center
Come with me.
I'll take you to him.

00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:25.719 position:50% align:center
Wait. Um.

00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:27.971 position:50% align:center
[MOMO]
I know a secret way!

00:06:30.974 --> 00:06:32.350 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:06:32.434 --> 00:06:34.978 position:50% align:center
Is this the back entrance?

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:38.398 position:50% align:center
[MOMO]
Come and look. Over here.

00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:41.359 position:50% align:center
See? You just crawl through.

00:06:41.443 --> 00:06:43.111 position:50% align:center
Oh, thanks. But I don't know--

00:06:43.194 --> 00:06:44.612 position:50% align:center
Hurry up!

00:06:47.657 --> 00:06:49.284 position:50% align:center
[MOMO]
They don't let me in the front,

00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:52.662 position:50% align:center
so I always have to sneak
in from there instead.

00:06:52.746 --> 00:06:54.622 position:50% align:center
I play here when I can.

00:06:54.706 --> 00:06:55.874 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Hey, Momo.

00:06:55.957 --> 00:06:59.002 position:50% align:center
Can I ask you, are
you acquainted with--

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:01.546 position:50% align:center
I mean, do you know
Momiji at all?

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:02.881 position:50% align:center
Kind of.

00:07:02.964 --> 00:07:06.509 position:50% align:center
I met him before,
at Papa's building.

00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:10.472 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU chuckles]

00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:12.932 position:50% align:center
I thought he looked
just like Mama.

00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:16.561 position:50% align:center
So it was weird when I told
her that and she said no.

00:07:16.644 --> 00:07:19.689 position:50% align:center
She didn't think they
looked anything alike.

00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:23.193 position:50% align:center
And then Papa said I
couldn't see him anymore.

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:25.653 position:50% align:center
But then I was sneaking around

00:07:25.737 --> 00:07:28.656 position:50% align:center
and I found the house
where Momiji lives.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.492 position:50% align:center
There, you see.

00:07:30.575 --> 00:07:35.205 position:50% align:center
That day, he was playing
the violin, too.

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:36.790 position:50% align:center
He doesn't always play it,

00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:41.086 position:50% align:center
but when he does,
I like to watch him.

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:42.879 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Momiji.

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:48.468 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
You don't ever go talk to him?

00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:51.930 position:50% align:center
I'm not allowed. Papa says.

00:07:52.013 --> 00:07:56.059 position:50% align:center
But you're his friend,
so it's okay if you do.

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:58.728 position:50% align:center
I did a good job bringing
you here, right?

00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:02.816 position:50% align:center
So maybe you can
help me get my wish.

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:04.859 position:50% align:center
You'll help me, won't you?

00:08:04.943 --> 00:08:06.111 position:50% align:center
Go ask him.

00:08:06.194 --> 00:08:10.198 position:50% align:center
Ask Momiji if he'll be
my big brother. Please!

00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:12.742 position:50% align:center
I mean, he looks just like Mama.

00:08:12.826 --> 00:08:17.789 position:50% align:center
I know Mama said he doesn't,
but... that's not true.

00:08:17.872 --> 00:08:20.291 position:50% align:center
I want a big brother so much!

00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:23.837 position:50% align:center
Someone to talk to
and laugh with.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.881 position:50% align:center
I even started
violin lessons, too.

00:08:26.965 --> 00:08:31.428 position:50% align:center
We could practice together.
It would be so perfect!

00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:35.181 position:50% align:center
We'd play every day.

00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:37.017 position:50% align:center
Ask him for me?

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:40.520 position:50% align:center

Please, ask!

to see you today.

What are you doing here?

00:08:53.658 --> 00:08:56.703 position:50% align:center
Never mind that. Come on in.

00:08:56.786 --> 00:08:59.956 position:50% align:center
Oops. Looks like you've got
some dirt on your clothing.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.666 position:50% align:center
From what?

that you played it.

Mhm.

00:09:14.012 --> 00:09:15.096 position:50% align:center

since I started high
school, though.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:20.268 position:50% align:center
And I recently quit the lessons
I had been taking for years.

00:09:20.352 --> 00:09:23.480 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Huh? You stopped your lessons?

00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:24.230 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Mh-hm.

00:09:24.314 --> 00:09:26.733 position:50% align:center
That's too bad.

00:09:26.816 --> 00:09:30.236 position:50% align:center
But you're not going to
stop playing, are you?

00:09:31.446 --> 00:09:32.822 position:50% align:center
It's Momo.

00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:36.868 position:50% align:center
She started taking violin
from the same teacher I had.

00:09:36.951 --> 00:09:41.414 position:50% align:center
So Papa said he wanted me
to stop my lessons.

00:09:41.498 --> 00:09:43.583 position:50% align:center
The truth is, he's scared.

00:09:43.667 --> 00:09:47.462 position:50% align:center
He's afraid of me getting
close to Momo and Mama.

00:09:47.545 --> 00:09:49.839 position:50% align:center
Because if that happened,

00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:53.051 position:50% align:center
I might destroy the
happy life they have now.

00:09:53.134 --> 00:09:57.389 position:50% align:center
The one he worked
so hard to rebuild.

00:09:57.472 --> 00:10:01.226 position:50% align:center
And I wouldn't want
that, either.

00:10:01.309 --> 00:10:03.311 position:50% align:center
I'm scared, too.

00:10:03.395 --> 00:10:05.814 position:50% align:center
That I'll hurt her if I see her.

00:10:07.691 --> 00:10:11.528 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
But... what if...?

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:14.823 position:50% align:center
What if Momo wanted to see you?

00:10:14.906 --> 00:10:16.616 position:50% align:center
I saw her today.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:20.954 position:50% align:center
She was actually the one
who led me to your house.

00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:24.791 position:50% align:center
They've kept you separate,
but, even so,

00:10:24.874 --> 00:10:27.460 position:50% align:center
she's always known about you.

00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:29.921 position:50% align:center
She stood there watching you.

00:10:30.005 --> 00:10:34.676 position:50% align:center
Day after day! She's been
right out there all this time!

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:38.263 position:50% align:center
Just like you've always been
there, watching over her,

00:10:38.346 --> 00:10:43.351 position:50% align:center
she's been here, listening
to you play the violin.

00:10:43.435 --> 00:10:47.689 position:50% align:center
She wishes she could talk
to you and play with you.

00:10:47.772 --> 00:10:51.651 position:50% align:center
She wanted me to ask you
to be her big brother!

00:10:53.528 --> 00:10:59.034 position:50% align:center
[TORHU] Kept apart, even though
the person they long for...

00:10:59.117 --> 00:11:01.327 position:50% align:center
...is still in this world.

00:11:02.787 --> 00:11:06.708 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
So then, it was true.

00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:12.047 position:50% align:center
Papa said he was worried
Momo had taken notice of me.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.549 position:50% align:center
Oh, no.

00:11:14.632 --> 00:11:17.677 position:50% align:center
I feel so... happy.

00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:21.598 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
And the distance...

00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:26.561 position:50% align:center
...only makes those
feelings... more intense.

00:11:27.854 --> 00:11:31.274 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Tohru, my dream for the future

00:11:31.358 --> 00:11:34.444 position:50% align:center
is to become a
professional violinist.

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:36.404 position:50% align:center
And when I'm able to do that,

00:11:36.488 --> 00:11:39.199 position:50% align:center
then I'll have a small,
private concert,

00:11:39.282 --> 00:11:44.537 position:50% align:center
with no one but Papa, Mama,
and Momo there to watch me play.

00:11:47.374 --> 00:11:53.004 position:50% align:center
Ah, Momo. Thank you.

00:11:53.088 --> 00:11:56.800 position:50% align:center
And thank you, too,
Tohru. I'm so happy.

00:11:56.883 --> 00:11:59.636 position:50% align:center
And I can only feel that now...

00:12:00.595 --> 00:12:07.060 position:50% align:center
...because I have somebody
here who will cry for me.

00:12:08.395 --> 00:12:11.272 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] I have to see him,
no matter what.

00:12:11.356 --> 00:12:12.691 position:50% align:center
Sorry?

00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:16.653 position:50% align:center
What's that? Who did
you come to see?

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:22.117 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Kureno.

00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:26.496 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Really?

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:29.833 position:50% align:center
I don't think very many people
come here to visit him.

00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:32.877 position:50% align:center
So what did you want
to talk to him about?

00:12:35.588 --> 00:12:38.425 position:50% align:center
Somebody I know--a good friend--

00:12:38.508 --> 00:12:41.386 position:50% align:center
has been missing
a man named Kureno.

00:12:41.469 --> 00:12:46.099 position:50% align:center
And I thought there was a chance
it could be Kureno Soma.

00:12:46.182 --> 00:12:48.601 position:50% align:center
I wanted to find out.

00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:51.229 position:50% align:center
So you're doing this
for someone else?

00:12:51.312 --> 00:12:54.524 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
No. Not like that.

00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:58.153 position:50% align:center
I'm not doing something
noble or selfless.

00:12:58.236 --> 00:12:59.529 position:50% align:center
It's for me.

00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:04.034 position:50% align:center
I decided to come
because I needed to know.

00:13:05.076 --> 00:13:08.788 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI] The problem is, Kureno
lives in the inner estate,

00:13:08.872 --> 00:13:12.375 position:50% align:center
and nobody out here
sees very much of him.

00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:16.212 position:50% align:center
So getting to him
could be difficult.

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:18.548 position:50% align:center
Hm. Now that I think of it,

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:21.676 position:50% align:center
that may only be true
for zodiac members.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.845 position:50% align:center
Akito told us we
couldn't see him,

00:13:23.928 --> 00:13:27.724 position:50% align:center
so we just assumed no
one else could, either.

00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:28.850 position:50% align:center
I'll go with you.

00:13:28.933 --> 00:13:29.851 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU gasps]

00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:31.436 position:50% align:center
What?

00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:34.981 position:50% align:center
I'm worried. What will you do
if somebody sees you in here?

00:13:35.065 --> 00:13:39.277 position:50% align:center
Someone like... Akito.

00:13:39.361 --> 00:13:42.864 position:50% align:center
Remember... last time?

00:13:44.032 --> 00:13:45.784 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Momiji.

00:13:48.244 --> 00:13:51.748 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Thanks for worrying,
but I'll go by myself.

00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:54.042 position:50% align:center
I've already interrupted
your day by coming here,

00:13:54.125 --> 00:13:56.294 position:50% align:center
and I don't wanna make it worse.

00:13:56.378 --> 00:13:59.297 position:50% align:center
You stay. I'll be all right.

00:13:59.381 --> 00:14:00.840 position:50% align:center
You said it yourself.

00:14:00.924 --> 00:14:05.011 position:50% align:center
Kureno isn't supposed to see
any of the other zodiac members.

00:14:08.473 --> 00:14:10.517 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Right. Here we go.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.688 position:50% align:center
According to the map Momiji
drew for me, it looks like...

00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:16.481 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Okay. Take this.

00:14:16.564 --> 00:14:18.650 position:50% align:center
And remember,
if anyone finds you,

00:14:18.733 --> 00:14:22.153 position:50% align:center
tell them you're there
because of me, all right?

00:14:22.237 --> 00:14:24.614 position:50% align:center
You have to blame me.

00:14:24.698 --> 00:14:29.244 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Momiji... thank you
so much for understanding.

00:14:29.327 --> 00:14:30.412 position:50% align:center
For worrying about me

00:14:30.495 --> 00:14:33.206 position:50% align:center
instead of being annoyed
by my selfishness.

00:14:33.289 --> 00:14:34.457 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:36.376 --> 00:14:38.628 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU whimpering]

00:14:38.712 --> 00:14:41.715 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Courage!
That's what I need right now.

00:14:41.798 --> 00:14:44.050 position:50% align:center
Mom!

00:14:44.134 --> 00:14:49.639 position:50% align:center
Mom, if you're not mad at me for
being so selfish and reckless...

00:14:49.723 --> 00:14:51.808 position:50% align:center
...then please help me.

00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:54.310 position:50% align:center
Send me some of your strength!

00:14:56.896 --> 00:15:00.775 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Okay. Looking at this,
I should be getting close.

00:15:00.859 --> 00:15:02.485 position:50% align:center
I think.

00:15:05.071 --> 00:15:07.323 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU gasps]

00:15:07.407 --> 00:15:08.825 position:50% align:center
Kureno. Huh?

00:15:08.908 --> 00:15:10.493 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laughing]

00:15:10.577 --> 00:15:13.329 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
People! Oh, no! I have to hide!

00:15:15.999 --> 00:15:18.043 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I can't believe it. I was close.

00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:19.085 position:50% align:center
So close!

00:15:19.169 --> 00:15:20.170 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU yelps]

00:15:20.253 --> 00:15:22.005 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
There's someone over here, too!

00:15:22.088 --> 00:15:23.173 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU yelps]

00:15:23.256 --> 00:15:25.425 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] And here!
There's nowhere to run!

00:15:25.508 --> 00:15:27.135 position:50% align:center
This is the wrong direction.

00:15:27.218 --> 00:15:31.181 position:50% align:center
I'm getting farther and
farther away from Kureno!

00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:35.852 position:50% align:center
Oh, what am I doing?
This is never going to work.

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:39.814 position:50% align:center
No! I can't let myself
think like that. Not now.

00:15:39.898 --> 00:15:41.941 position:50% align:center
I have to keep trying!

00:15:42.025 --> 00:15:45.862 position:50% align:center
Which would be easier if
I had any idea where I was.

00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:48.448 position:50% align:center
[REN]
Who's that?

00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:50.325 position:50% align:center
Is someone out here?

00:15:50.408 --> 00:15:53.370 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
That voice.

00:15:53.453 --> 00:15:57.832 position:50% align:center
No. What should I do?
I can't run.

00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:00.585 position:50% align:center
It's only me.

00:16:00.669 --> 00:16:04.130 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. I was
just passing by.

00:16:04.214 --> 00:16:05.757 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Kureno?

00:16:06.758 --> 00:16:09.135 position:50% align:center
[REN] Why not come
join me for some tea?

00:16:09.219 --> 00:16:11.805 position:50% align:center
No, I really ought to get back.

00:16:11.888 --> 00:16:13.932 position:50% align:center
Akito will be worried.

00:16:14.015 --> 00:16:16.893 position:50% align:center
So... if you'll excuse me.

00:16:22.649 --> 00:16:23.900 position:50% align:center
[KURENO] I thought
I heard someone call me

00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:25.694 position:50% align:center
and went after you.

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:28.988 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
What were you doing there?

00:16:29.072 --> 00:16:30.865 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Um, I'm sorry.

00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:33.743 position:50% align:center
[KURENO] How did you get
in in the first place?

00:16:33.827 --> 00:16:36.413 position:50% align:center
If you snuck in, that
means you're trespassing,

00:16:36.496 --> 00:16:38.665 position:50% align:center
and I have every right
to call the police.

00:16:38.748 --> 00:16:40.500 position:50% align:center
No, don't do that!

00:16:40.583 --> 00:16:41.751 position:50% align:center
At least, not yet.

00:16:41.835 --> 00:16:44.462 position:50% align:center
Please listen to what
I have to say first.

00:16:44.546 --> 00:16:47.632 position:50% align:center
I think maybe you
know my friend.

00:16:47.716 --> 00:16:50.176 position:50% align:center
Her name is Arisa Uotani.

00:16:52.387 --> 00:16:53.638 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
It is him.

00:16:53.722 --> 00:16:57.267 position:50% align:center
He's Uo- <i>chan</i> 's Kureno,
like I thought.

00:16:58.727 --> 00:17:01.896 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] The thing is,
Uo- <i>chan</i> wants to see you.

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:03.440 position:50% align:center
She's tough,

00:17:03.523 --> 00:17:06.609 position:50% align:center
and it takes a lot to get her
to talk about her feelings,

00:17:06.693 --> 00:17:09.362 position:50% align:center
but I know she quit
her old jobs.

00:17:09.446 --> 00:17:11.781 position:50% align:center
And, um... when she
thinks about the fact

00:17:11.865 --> 00:17:14.743 position:50% align:center
that she won't get
to see you anymore,

00:17:14.826 --> 00:17:19.080 position:50% align:center
she looks sad... and lonely.

00:17:22.584 --> 00:17:26.379 position:50% align:center
[KURENO] I don't plan
to see her again. Ever.

00:17:27.464 --> 00:17:32.302 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] You mean... because
you have a zodiac spirit?

00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:34.054 position:50% align:center
Is that why?

00:17:35.013 --> 00:17:38.475 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
No. It's not that.

00:17:38.558 --> 00:17:39.851 position:50% align:center
I...

00:17:43.521 --> 00:17:45.565 position:50% align:center
It really isn't any
of your business.

00:17:45.648 --> 00:17:47.776 position:50% align:center
Right. Of course.

00:17:47.859 --> 00:17:50.320 position:50% align:center
But please, just one more thing.

00:17:50.403 --> 00:17:53.239 position:50% align:center
Uo- <i>chan</i> 's my friend, and
it's hard to see her hurting,

00:17:53.323 --> 00:17:55.617 position:50% align:center
so at least take this.

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:59.496 position:50% align:center
Here. It has her
contact information.

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:01.581 position:50% align:center
Accepting it doesn't mean you
have to get in touch with her

00:18:01.664 --> 00:18:05.752 position:50% align:center
right away, or ever,
for that matter.

00:18:05.835 --> 00:18:10.548 position:50% align:center
But who knows? You might feel
different about it tomorrow.

00:18:10.632 --> 00:18:12.509 position:50% align:center
Maybe... Maybe you'll wake up

00:18:12.592 --> 00:18:15.970 position:50% align:center
and suddenly decide you
want to see her again.

00:18:16.054 --> 00:18:19.182 position:50% align:center
It might not be tomorrow.
It could be the day after that.

00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:22.060 position:50% align:center
Or a year from now.
Or ten years.

00:18:22.143 --> 00:18:24.479 position:50% align:center
But as long as you're alive,

00:18:24.562 --> 00:18:28.858 position:50% align:center
things will keep changing
in ways you can't predict.

00:18:28.942 --> 00:18:34.114 position:50% align:center
As long as you're alive, you'll
find new things to wish for!

00:18:34.197 --> 00:18:36.908 position:50% align:center
Um. I'll hide this
in here, okay?

00:18:36.991 --> 00:18:40.495 position:50% align:center
So no one but us
will know it's there.

00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:42.914 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:18:42.997 --> 00:18:47.585 position:50% align:center
Okay, I'm done now.
Go on. Do it.

00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:50.130 position:50% align:center
Oh. I, uh...

00:18:50.213 --> 00:18:51.506 position:50% align:center
[KURENO chuckles]

00:18:51.589 --> 00:18:54.634 position:50% align:center
I don't have handcuffs
on me, sorry.

00:18:54.718 --> 00:18:58.138 position:50% align:center
It's okay. I'll give you a pass.

00:18:58.221 --> 00:19:01.599 position:50% align:center
There's someone here
who's worried about you.

00:19:01.683 --> 00:19:04.102 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Momiji.

00:19:04.185 --> 00:19:06.646 position:50% align:center
Now, go on back.

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:08.148 position:50% align:center
Um, Kureno?

00:19:08.231 --> 00:19:09.566 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:11.943 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
You shouldn't be here.

00:19:12.027 --> 00:19:14.779 position:50% align:center
It's not the place for
someone like you.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:18.450 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
Goodbye.

00:19:20.577 --> 00:19:24.289 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
My heart is breaking.

00:19:25.749 --> 00:19:27.959 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I'm sorry. Really.

00:19:28.043 --> 00:19:31.296 position:50% align:center
I caused so much trouble for you
by coming over here today.

00:19:31.379 --> 00:19:34.632 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI] What? No.
I don't think that at all.

00:19:34.716 --> 00:19:37.510 position:50% align:center
You told me how Momo
feels about me, remember?

00:19:37.594 --> 00:19:39.804 position:50% align:center
It made me so happy!

00:19:39.888 --> 00:19:42.015 position:50% align:center
I want to thank you somehow.

00:19:42.098 --> 00:19:43.892 position:50% align:center
I know! Yes!

00:19:43.975 --> 00:19:46.186 position:50% align:center
Someday I'll put on a
special concert just for you

00:19:46.269 --> 00:19:47.437 position:50% align:center
and nobody else!

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.189 position:50% align:center
Huh? Um, that sounds great,

00:19:49.272 --> 00:19:51.691 position:50% align:center
but I don't know much
about classical music.

00:19:51.775 --> 00:19:52.942 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI chuckles]

00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:54.194 position:50% align:center
No big deal.

00:19:54.277 --> 00:19:56.863 position:50% align:center
Just tell me a song you
like, and I'll play it.

00:19:56.946 --> 00:20:00.992 position:50% align:center
A song? Um.

00:20:01.076 --> 00:20:02.035 position:50% align:center
Wishes.

00:20:02.118 --> 00:20:03.661 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:20:03.745 --> 00:20:06.122 position:50% align:center
"Birth of Wishes."

00:20:06.206 --> 00:20:08.166 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Is that one your favorite?

00:20:08.249 --> 00:20:12.253 position:50% align:center
Oh. I don't know. It just
kinda popped into my head.

00:20:12.337 --> 00:20:14.047 position:50% align:center
But if that's too
hard on the violin,

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:16.383 position:50% align:center
a different one's totally fine.

00:20:16.466 --> 00:20:19.594 position:50% align:center
It's okay. I can learn it.

00:20:20.845 --> 00:20:26.601 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] I'll wish for them...
and the ones they long to see.

00:20:26.685 --> 00:20:28.186 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
What's wrong?

00:20:28.269 --> 00:20:29.396 position:50% align:center
There's gotta be something.

00:20:29.479 --> 00:20:32.273 position:50% align:center
You don't come up on
the roof very often.

00:20:33.191 --> 00:20:36.069 position:50% align:center
You go on some kinda
adventure today?

00:20:36.152 --> 00:20:38.655 position:50% align:center
Come on. You came home
covered in dirt, so...

00:20:38.738 --> 00:20:43.326 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess it was
kind of an adventure,

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:45.286 position:50% align:center
but it didn't go well.

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:47.080 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:20:47.163 --> 00:20:49.165 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] When there's
someone in your life,

00:20:49.249 --> 00:20:55.672 position:50% align:center
someone you care about,
you want... to be near them.

00:20:56.589 --> 00:20:58.091 position:50% align:center
So that's it.

00:20:58.174 --> 00:21:01.428 position:50% align:center
You got a crush
on somebody, huh?

00:21:01.511 --> 00:21:03.096 position:50% align:center
Ah! No, that's not it!

00:21:03.179 --> 00:21:05.515 position:50% align:center
Or, at least, it's not
myself I'm talking about.

00:21:05.598 --> 00:21:08.476 position:50% align:center
It's all right, don't worry.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.813 position:50% align:center
When you do fall in love
with someone, I promise...

00:21:13.523 --> 00:21:18.069 position:50% align:center
...I'll be rooting
for you, okay?

00:21:18.153 --> 00:21:22.741 position:50% align:center
Right, um, thanks.
That's good to--

00:21:24.993 --> 00:21:25.910 position:50% align:center
[KYO gasps]

00:21:25.994 --> 00:21:27.412 position:50% align:center
Seriously, what's
wrong with you?

00:21:27.495 --> 00:21:31.624 position:50% align:center
They came out of nowhere,
all these tears.

00:21:31.708 --> 00:21:34.127 position:50% align:center
I just started crying.

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:37.547 position:50% align:center
I... I have no idea
what's wrong.

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:47.432 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] My heart aches.
Like it's being torn apart.

00:21:47.515 --> 00:21:52.687 position:50% align:center
Is it because I know my
wish might be impossible?

00:21:58.276 --> 00:22:01.905 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Because I'm too
familiar with wishes...

00:22:01.988 --> 00:22:05.367 position:50% align:center
...that never come true?

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:10.205 position:50% align:center
Even so... I'll keep wishing.

00:22:11.247 --> 00:22:14.751 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Hey, Kyo, what do you wish for?

00:22:14.834 --> 00:22:17.379 position:50% align:center
[KYO] Well, right now,
for someone to quit crying.

00:22:17.462 --> 00:22:19.464 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU chuckles]

00:22:19.547 --> 00:22:21.091 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Okay.

00:22:23.009 --> 00:22:25.303 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I'll keep wishing.

00:23:57.312 --> 00:24:00.023 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
"You will, I'm sure of it."
