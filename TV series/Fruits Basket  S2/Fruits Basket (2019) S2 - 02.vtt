[bell tolls]

00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:17.517 position:50% align:center
One more thing,
your career plans.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.728 position:50% align:center
Fill out those forms
and get 'em turned in

00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:20.854 position:50% align:center
by the end of the week.

00:00:20.937 --> 00:00:22.147 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS]
Yes, ma'am.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.773 position:50% align:center
And we'll be having
parent-teacher conferences

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:25.316 position:50% align:center
right after summer break.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.152 position:50% align:center
So don't forget to let
your parent or guardian

00:00:27.235 --> 00:00:29.362 position:50% align:center
know what's up.

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:31.614 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] I'll tell Grandpa
and see if he can come.

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:33.658 position:50% align:center
[HIROSHI]
Kyon-Kyon, what's your plan?

00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:36.369 position:50% align:center
Gonna open a cat cafÃ©? Meow!

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:39.664 position:50% align:center
Just shut it.
What d'you care anyway?

00:00:39.748 --> 00:00:43.501 position:50% align:center
If I don't get some food soon,
there's gonna be hell to pay!

00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:45.253 position:50% align:center
I get that you're hungry,

00:00:45.337 --> 00:00:47.130 position:50% align:center
but why take it out
on Kyon-Kyon?

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:49.215 position:50% align:center
I'm not hungry,
junior, I'm hangry!

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:51.217 position:50% align:center
I slept in, so I didn't
get any breakfast.

00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:54.262 position:50% align:center
[KYO] Hey, if you were a guy,
I'd wipe the floor with you

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:56.181 position:50% align:center
for pulling a stupid
stunt like that.

00:00:56.264 --> 00:00:59.017 position:50% align:center
Better be grateful that you were
born a chick, Gangster Girl!

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.352 position:50% align:center
No matter how
pissed off you are,

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:02.312 position:50% align:center
I know you wouldn't
hurt a girl, dumbass!

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:03.563 position:50% align:center
That's why I did it. Yeah!

00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:05.482 position:50% align:center
--Hey, guys. Lunchtime.
--[KYO] Yeah? You sure?

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:07.859 position:50% align:center
--It's lunchtime.
--Guess we'll see.

00:01:07.942 --> 00:01:09.194 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
It's been so long since we've

00:01:09.277 --> 00:01:11.237 position:50% align:center
all eaten lunch
together like this.

00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:12.739 position:50% align:center
[HANAJIMA]
It has.

00:01:12.822 --> 00:01:15.075 position:50% align:center
Food would taste a lot better
without you idiots around.

00:01:15.158 --> 00:01:18.244 position:50% align:center
Have you already turned in
your career plan form, Tohru?

00:01:18.328 --> 00:01:19.496 position:50% align:center
Yep!

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.956 position:50% align:center
I haven't yet. I'm not
sure what I wanna do.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.960 position:50% align:center
Yeah, me neither. How can
we decide that crap now?

00:01:26.044 --> 00:01:28.963 position:50% align:center
Though I guess you've had your
plan in mind for a while, huh?

00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:30.507 position:50% align:center
It's the same as always.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.967 position:50% align:center
Start working right away
to support myself.

00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:35.720 position:50% align:center
The work force. Sounds
like a viable option.

00:01:35.804 --> 00:01:37.639 position:50% align:center
It's not the only one, though.

00:01:37.722 --> 00:01:40.058 position:50% align:center
You know, you could always
just get married, Tohru.

00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:40.767 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Huh?

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.102 position:50% align:center
Oh, marriage?

00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:44.813 position:50% align:center
In that case, perhaps
I should go to college.

00:01:44.896 --> 00:01:46.773 position:50% align:center
Then I would be better
able to support us.

00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:49.359 position:50% align:center
Don't pick out your
wedding dress just yet.

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:51.361 position:50% align:center
I had something else in mind.

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:54.864 position:50% align:center
Like her getting hitched to one
of these jokers, for instance.

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:56.950 position:50% align:center
What the hell are
those faces for?

00:01:57.033 --> 00:01:59.452 position:50% align:center
You got a problem with Tohru,
you got a problem with me,

00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:00.620 position:50% align:center
and you don't want that.

00:02:00.704 --> 00:02:02.539 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
No, there's no problem at all.

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:04.749 position:50% align:center
Well, then, we'll see
which of us wins.

00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:07.836 position:50% align:center
[KYO] We didn't even say
anything! Stop picking a fight!

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:10.547 position:50% align:center
Um, guys, maybe I will
get married someday,

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.382 position:50% align:center
but it probably won't
be anytime soon.

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:15.093 position:50% align:center
So I don't know if we need to
start making plans right now.

00:02:15.176 --> 00:02:16.094 position:50% align:center
Who knows?

00:02:16.177 --> 00:02:17.303 position:50% align:center
I could surprise all of ya

00:02:17.387 --> 00:02:18.888 position:50% align:center
and be the first of
us to tie the knot.

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:20.807 position:50% align:center
Hah. I pity the poor guy.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.976 position:50% align:center
[KYO groaning]

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:24.811 position:50% align:center
I'm not saying I'd marry him,

00:02:24.894 --> 00:02:27.063 position:50% align:center
but I did meet a guy at work
that I'm maybe, kind of,

00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:28.523 position:50% align:center
a little bit into.

00:02:28.606 --> 00:02:29.149 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU gasps]

00:02:29.232 --> 00:02:30.025 position:50% align:center
What?

00:02:30.108 --> 00:02:31.317 position:50% align:center
Well, this is news.

00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:34.946 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Uh. Will you
tell us what he's like?

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.865 position:50% align:center
He reminds me of you, actually.

00:02:36.948 --> 00:02:40.744 position:50% align:center
Huh? A guy reminds you
of me? Like, how?

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:42.787 position:50% align:center
[HANAJIMA] Sounds like the type
of man I'd like to meet.

00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:43.580 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
Whatever you're imagining...

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:46.207 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Plans. Goals.

00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:48.126 position:50% align:center
The path forward.

00:02:49.252 --> 00:02:52.964 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
My life. My future.

00:02:53.048 --> 00:02:55.050 position:50% align:center
After next year.

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:28.810 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
C'mon, Tohru. Let's go.

00:04:28.893 --> 00:04:30.979 position:50% align:center
Keep spacing out
and I'll leave you behind.

00:04:31.062 --> 00:04:32.439 position:50% align:center
I'm coming!

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:35.483 position:50% align:center
It was so nice of Master Kazuma
to invite me over today.

00:04:35.567 --> 00:04:38.319 position:50% align:center
I'd hate to get lost and
miss the chance to see him.

00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:40.488 position:50% align:center
I hope you're not
expecting much.

00:04:40.572 --> 00:04:43.033 position:50% align:center
We'll just eat some lunch
and maybe talk a little.

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:45.660 position:50% align:center
You'll probably end
up getting bored.

00:04:45.744 --> 00:04:47.203 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
That's not boring.

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:49.497 position:50% align:center
There's still so much
I don't know about him.

00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:52.125 position:50% align:center
I'm really excited, I mean it!

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:54.794 position:50% align:center
Okay, fine. I believe you.

00:04:54.878 --> 00:04:56.463 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU chuckles]

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:58.923 position:50% align:center
[KYO] Watch where you're
going. You'll trip.

00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:01.676 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Master!

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.470 position:50% align:center
Thanks for inviting us!

00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:05.013 position:50% align:center
I brought her!

00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:06.890 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:08.433 position:50% align:center
Um, I could be wrong,

00:05:08.516 --> 00:05:11.978 position:50% align:center
but it kinda smells
like smoke in here.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.190 position:50% align:center
Uh!

00:05:15.273 --> 00:05:19.194 position:50% align:center
Master! What're you
setting on fire now?

00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:22.072 position:50% align:center
The pot! The fish
is burning, too!

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:24.866 position:50% align:center
Is everything... okay?

00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:28.078 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Sorry about that.

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:29.996 position:50% align:center
Guess I shouldn't be reading.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.415 position:50% align:center
But Shigure's new
book is fascinating.

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:35.418 position:50% align:center
That's what you
should've burned.

00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:37.712 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] The first time seeing
each other again after so long

00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:39.673 position:50% align:center
and I'm making a mess of myself.

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:43.051 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Oh, no. Please don't
worry about it. Really.

00:05:43.134 --> 00:05:46.346 position:50% align:center
So, um, I noticed your
hair's a lot shorter.

00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:48.473 position:50% align:center
That's right. I chopped it off.

00:05:48.556 --> 00:05:49.557 position:50% align:center
All that hair.

00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:50.850 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Hmm.

00:05:50.934 --> 00:05:52.686 position:50% align:center
But what are we going to do now?

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:55.230 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid that I've ruined
lunch completely.

00:05:55.313 --> 00:05:57.107 position:50% align:center
Well, um, if you don't mind,

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.109 position:50% align:center
I'd be happy to make
something for us.

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:01.820 position:50% align:center
What? You're the guest here,
you shouldn't have to cook.

00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:02.987 position:50% align:center
That would be great, thank you.

00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:04.656 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Oh, come on!

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:07.951 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Hmm...

00:06:13.415 --> 00:06:16.209 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] What is it, Kyo?
You have something on your mind?

00:06:16.292 --> 00:06:18.586 position:50% align:center
Uh. Why do you say that?

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.256 position:50% align:center
You were like this when
you were young, too.

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:23.216 position:50% align:center
Whenever you wanted
to say something...

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:24.384 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:25.468 position:50% align:center
[KYO] Let's play.
Let's play. Let's play.

00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:27.012 position:50% align:center
Let's play. Let's play.
Let's play. L--

00:06:27.095 --> 00:06:30.640 position:50% align:center
What? Nu-uh! I was never
that cutesy! Or pathetic!

00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:32.267 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.937 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] Well, what did
you want to talk about?

00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:37.689 position:50% align:center
It's nothing.

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:46.156 position:50% align:center
Is there anything in there?

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:49.284 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] I don't usually
keep much on hand.

00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:51.786 position:50% align:center
I think I could put a
quick curry together!

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.164 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Ah. That sounds perfect.

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:55.623 position:50% align:center
I would be happy to
give you some help.

00:06:55.707 --> 00:06:58.001 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's not
happening. I'll help.

00:06:58.084 --> 00:07:01.171 position:50% align:center
Go. Watch from out there
if you want to.

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:03.590 position:50% align:center
You're going to help me
with the curry, Kyo?

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:05.425 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much!

00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:07.010 position:50% align:center
Master.

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:10.305 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you already know,
but Kyo is a really great cook.

00:07:10.388 --> 00:07:12.474 position:50% align:center
You should've tasted the rice
porridge he made for me.

00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:14.059 position:50% align:center
It was wonderful!

00:07:14.142 --> 00:07:16.811 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Kyo made rice porridge for you?

00:07:16.895 --> 00:07:18.146 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Yes!

00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:20.482 position:50% align:center
How interesting.

00:07:20.565 --> 00:07:21.858 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Okay, that's enough!

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:23.526 position:50% align:center
Don't you have some
reading to do?

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.153 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Yes, of course.

00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:27.113 position:50% align:center
[KYO] C'mon, let's
get started already.

00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:28.740 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Oh, right!

00:07:28.823 --> 00:07:30.492 position:50% align:center
Did I hear somebody yelling?

00:07:30.575 --> 00:07:32.494 position:50% align:center
That would be Kyo
throwing me out.

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:33.328 position:50% align:center
Ah.

00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:34.788 position:50% align:center
So much hair.

00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:37.207 position:50% align:center
Are you sure you're gonna
be able to tie all of it up?

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.458 position:50% align:center
I'll be fine.

00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:41.628 position:50% align:center
It looks like those two
are having a good time.

00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:43.254 position:50% align:center
I never thought I'd see
him so comfortable

00:07:43.338 --> 00:07:44.756 position:50% align:center
with anyone other than you.

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:45.757 position:50% align:center
[bell rings]

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.676 position:50% align:center
Oh, the door.

00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:54.432 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] A year ago, this
wouldn't have been possible.

00:07:54.516 --> 00:07:58.186 position:50% align:center
He couldn't even look
up, let alone smile.

00:07:58.269 --> 00:08:01.564 position:50% align:center
All he had was despair.

00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:06.820 position:50% align:center
He was surrounded by an aura
of darkness akin to death.

00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:08.530 position:50% align:center
[KUNIMITSU]
Kazuma.

00:08:08.613 --> 00:08:10.615 position:50% align:center
Kazuma!

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:12.909 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] Yeah, uh, sorry.
Who's at the door?

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:16.871 position:50% align:center
He's gone now, but
it was Kyo's father.

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:22.168 position:50% align:center
[KYO] Huh? You're going out?
But what about lunch?

00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:23.712 position:50% align:center
Yes, I'm sorry.

00:08:23.795 --> 00:08:26.881 position:50% align:center
I know it's last minute, but
there's someone I need to see.

00:08:26.965 --> 00:08:29.342 position:50% align:center
I'll come back as soon as I can.

00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:33.096 position:50% align:center
Master. Did something happen?

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:34.723 position:50% align:center
Nothing to trouble you with.

00:08:34.806 --> 00:08:36.641 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, I won't be long.

00:08:36.725 --> 00:08:38.268 position:50% align:center
Just stay here and
behave yourself.

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:40.145 position:50% align:center
What's this about?

00:08:40.228 --> 00:08:42.772 position:50% align:center
You always did get so upset
when I was about to leave.

00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:45.316 position:50% align:center
Yeah, back when I was
just a snot-nosed kid!

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.735 position:50% align:center
Don't bring that up now!

00:08:46.818 --> 00:08:48.987 position:50% align:center
It's so cute when
they bicker like that.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.031 position:50% align:center
The way only a parent
and child can.

00:08:51.114 --> 00:08:54.034 position:50% align:center
Ah! I'm-I'm sorry!
I didn't see you there, sir!

00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:56.036 position:50% align:center
No, I'm sorry for
startling you.

00:08:56.119 --> 00:08:57.495 position:50% align:center
Kunimitsu Tomoda.

00:08:57.579 --> 00:08:59.539 position:50% align:center
You could say I'm
Kazuma's disciple,

00:08:59.622 --> 00:09:01.374 position:50% align:center
and his personal assistant.

00:09:01.458 --> 00:09:03.043 position:50% align:center
If you ever want dirt on Kyo,

00:09:03.126 --> 00:09:05.170 position:50% align:center
there are some stories
I could share.

00:09:05.253 --> 00:09:06.671 position:50% align:center
You see that?

00:09:06.755 --> 00:09:10.091 position:50% align:center
Poor kid once cried his eyes
out just from looking at it.

00:09:10.175 --> 00:09:13.887 position:50% align:center
Kunimitsu.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.848 position:50% align:center
No one wants to hear about
that crap! Now get out!

00:09:16.931 --> 00:09:19.434 position:50% align:center
All right. I wouldn't
wanna be a third wheel.

00:09:19.517 --> 00:09:23.688 position:50% align:center
Ah! Why are he and Master
both being such idiots today?

00:09:23.772 --> 00:09:25.482 position:50% align:center
So I guess even someone
as tough as you

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:28.026 position:50% align:center
cried about scary stuff
when you were a kid, huh?

00:09:28.109 --> 00:09:29.694 position:50% align:center
Sure, didn't everyone?

00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:33.031 position:50% align:center
It does kinda look like creepy
eyes staring out at you.

00:09:33.114 --> 00:09:34.657 position:50% align:center
Oh! Sorry, you're not still
afraid of it, are you?

00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:36.201 position:50% align:center
I'm not a kid anymore!

00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:37.202 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:09:37.285 --> 00:09:38.995 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Of course not.

00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:42.290 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Hey, don't worry.

00:09:42.374 --> 00:09:44.417 position:50% align:center
It won't always be like this.

00:09:44.501 --> 00:09:49.172 position:50% align:center
As your body and mind grow,
the fear will fade.

00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:53.218 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Was he right?

00:09:53.301 --> 00:09:58.223 position:50% align:center
If I keep growing,
will I overcome the fear?

00:09:58.306 --> 00:09:59.474 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:01.685 --> 00:10:02.852 position:50% align:center
Well, come on.

00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:04.396 position:50% align:center
The curry isn't going to
cook itself, you know.

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:07.691 position:50% align:center
Um, I guess that's one way
to get someone's attention.

00:10:07.774 --> 00:10:09.609 position:50% align:center
[KYO] Yeah. You want
me to do it again?

00:10:09.693 --> 00:10:13.238 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] No. I'm coming.
Let's make some curry!

00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:17.200 position:50% align:center
[KYO] If I try,
can I change my future?

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:21.121 position:50% align:center
[music playing]

00:10:21.204 --> 00:10:23.248 position:50% align:center
[KYO'S FATHER] Your grandfather
was the previous bearer

00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:25.208 position:50% align:center
of the Cat spirit.

00:10:26.418 --> 00:10:30.964 position:50% align:center
I'd think you of all people
would understand.

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:34.342 position:50% align:center
The one possessed by the Cat
is supposed to be confined.

00:10:34.426 --> 00:10:37.804 position:50% align:center
That thing is being granted
unprecedented freedom now,

00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:41.474 position:50% align:center
but after graduation,
all of that is going to change.

00:10:41.558 --> 00:10:44.686 position:50% align:center
They'll lock the
creature up. For good.

00:10:44.769 --> 00:10:48.398 position:50% align:center
It'll stay in that dark room
on the main estate until death.

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:51.943 position:50% align:center
Kazuma, will you help
when the time comes?

00:10:52.027 --> 00:10:54.029 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Let's calm down.

00:10:54.112 --> 00:10:56.531 position:50% align:center
I think you're getting
a bit ahead of yourself.

00:10:56.614 --> 00:10:58.366 position:50% align:center
Graduation isn't for
another year, after all.

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:00.910 position:50% align:center
[KYO'S FATHER]
I don't care how long we have!

00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:02.996 position:50% align:center
Just the thought of it
continuing to live outside

00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:06.041 position:50% align:center
like it's a regular
person makes me sick.

00:11:06.124 --> 00:11:11.254 position:50% align:center
No. That thing isn't human!
It's a disgusting monster!

00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:14.382 position:50% align:center
A demon that as good as murdered
my wife--its own mother!

00:11:14.466 --> 00:11:17.510 position:50% align:center
[record skipping]

00:11:17.594 --> 00:11:21.056 position:50% align:center
[KYO'S FATHER]
Will that crime be forgiven?

00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:24.059 position:50% align:center
It was all that thing's fault.

00:11:24.142 --> 00:11:28.188 position:50% align:center
Everything fell apart
because of it!

00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:30.690 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
You remind me of him.

00:11:30.774 --> 00:11:31.775 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:31.858 --> 00:11:34.444 position:50% align:center
Kyo was like this,
too, not long ago.

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:37.113 position:50% align:center
So fragile and full of fear.

00:11:37.197 --> 00:11:39.574 position:50% align:center
The anxiety overwhelmed him.

00:11:39.657 --> 00:11:41.951 position:50% align:center
So he shut his eyes,
plugged his ears,

00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:45.663 position:50% align:center
and left other people to
deal with his feelings.

00:11:45.747 --> 00:11:50.251 position:50% align:center
However, he is finally
beginning to change.

00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:54.005 position:50% align:center
He clawed his way out of despair
and is ready to leave it behind.

00:11:54.089 --> 00:11:56.132 position:50% align:center
He's trying to grow.

00:11:57.634 --> 00:12:01.096 position:50% align:center
So perhaps it's time for
you to change as he has.

00:12:01.179 --> 00:12:03.390 position:50% align:center
You relentlessly
persecute your son,

00:12:03.473 --> 00:12:06.810 position:50% align:center
but never stop to examine
your own conduct.

00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:07.977 position:50% align:center
[KYO'S FATHER]
What?

00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:09.479 position:50% align:center
Are you suggesting
I'm at fault somehow?

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:11.648 position:50% align:center
I just can't help but
wonder if it's fair,

00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:13.733 position:50% align:center
putting all the blame
on him the way you do.

00:12:13.817 --> 00:12:17.696 position:50% align:center
Hah! Listen to you,
sounding like a worried father.

00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:19.656 position:50% align:center
Very convincing.

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:21.116 position:50% align:center
But I know the truth.

00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:23.576 position:50% align:center
You only took him
in for the money.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:26.955 position:50% align:center
Even for the Cat, anyone
who raises a zodiac child

00:12:27.038 --> 00:12:28.123 position:50% align:center
is generously compensate--

00:12:28.206 --> 00:12:31.001 position:50% align:center
Raising him has been
a joy and an honor.

00:12:31.084 --> 00:12:32.794 position:50% align:center
I couldn't care less
how much you threaten,

00:12:32.877 --> 00:12:35.046 position:50% align:center
cajole, or insult me.

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:39.050 position:50% align:center
I will never cooperate with
any attempt to confine Kyo.

00:12:39.134 --> 00:12:42.470 position:50% align:center
Akito will make you!
You won't have a choice!

00:12:42.554 --> 00:12:45.181 position:50% align:center
You can't defy the family head!

00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:46.850 position:50% align:center
I will do what I must.

00:12:46.933 --> 00:12:50.603 position:50% align:center
No matter who I'm up against,
I will protect him with my life.

00:12:50.687 --> 00:12:54.024 position:50% align:center
You're no real parent of his,
so you will never understand.

00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:57.694 position:50% align:center
He's my son and
I will keep him safe.

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:04.617 position:50% align:center
You think you'll
get away with this?

00:13:05.577 --> 00:13:09.080 position:50% align:center
[KYO] I told you, I don't like
going to the beach or the pool.

00:13:09.164 --> 00:13:10.957 position:50% align:center
Can you even swim, anyway?

00:13:11.041 --> 00:13:12.500 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I totally can.

00:13:12.584 --> 00:13:15.086 position:50% align:center
I just need to get better
at the whole breathing part.

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:18.089 position:50% align:center
What? How can you swim
if you don't come up for air?

00:13:18.173 --> 00:13:20.592 position:50% align:center
One deep breath
and then paddle like crazy!

00:13:20.675 --> 00:13:22.177 position:50% align:center
You idiot.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.513 position:50% align:center
You'll be better off if you just
stick to building sandcastles.

00:13:25.597 --> 00:13:27.223 position:50% align:center
There you are!

00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:29.059 position:50% align:center
We're glad that you're back.

00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:30.393 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:13:30.477 --> 00:13:32.729 position:50% align:center
So did you run into any trouble?

00:13:32.812 --> 00:13:35.190 position:50% align:center
Well, a bit, yes.

00:13:35.273 --> 00:13:39.861 position:50% align:center
I had to listen to some unkind
grumbling, but I'm fine now.

00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:43.323 position:50% align:center
Master?

00:13:43.406 --> 00:13:44.908 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
That's right.

00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:48.953 position:50% align:center
Just keep growing and changing
and I'll keep protecting you.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.751 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA] Forget all that.
Is the curry ready yet?

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:55.919 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
It's been ready.

00:13:56.002 --> 00:13:57.212 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] We didn't wanna
start without you,

00:13:57.295 --> 00:13:59.255 position:50% align:center
but should we eat now?

00:14:01.091 --> 00:14:02.425 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
You know what?

00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:05.595 position:50% align:center
We first-years have to come up
with a career plan, too.

00:14:05.679 --> 00:14:08.306 position:50% align:center
But lucky for me,
I've already decided,

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:10.266 position:50% align:center
so it was super easy!

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:13.144 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow, you have?
That's great, Momiji!

00:14:13.228 --> 00:14:15.855 position:50% align:center
I know! I'm so excited!

00:14:15.939 --> 00:14:20.110 position:50% align:center
I mean, I might not be able to
do it, but I really want to.

00:14:20.193 --> 00:14:22.904 position:50% align:center
I'll just keep thinking about
how wonderful it would be,

00:14:22.987 --> 00:14:24.739 position:50% align:center
and that'll help me believe.

00:14:24.823 --> 00:14:29.202 position:50% align:center
You'll see! I'll tell you all
about it someday, okay, Tohru?

00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:31.996 position:50% align:center
But why do you think you
might not be able to--

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.250 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI] We're all done.
Thanks for picking her up again!

00:14:37.752 --> 00:14:38.878 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
He's so young,

00:14:38.962 --> 00:14:42.632 position:50% align:center
but Momiji already knows
what he wants to do.

00:14:42.716 --> 00:14:45.719 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah? And did he tell you
it might not be possible?

00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:49.431 position:50% align:center
Well, um, yes. He did.

00:14:49.514 --> 00:14:50.849 position:50% align:center
He's right.

00:14:50.932 --> 00:14:55.687 position:50% align:center
Unfortunately... there's a lot
we're struggling with.

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:57.063 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Yuki?

00:14:58.773 --> 00:15:00.275 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:15:01.693 --> 00:15:04.946 position:50% align:center
Um. Nothing.

00:15:07.532 --> 00:15:09.075 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Well, good night.

00:15:09.159 --> 00:15:11.995 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Good night.
I'll see you in the morning.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.750 position:50% align:center
[rustling]

00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:19.669 position:50% align:center
Hey, Kyo. What'cha
doin' in here?

00:15:19.753 --> 00:15:22.714 position:50% align:center
[KYO] I got hungry, so I
thought I'd make some <i>somen</i> .

00:15:22.797 --> 00:15:24.341 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I can help if you want.

00:15:24.424 --> 00:15:27.177 position:50% align:center
I mean, I need to prep stuff
for breakfast tomorrow anyway.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.512 position:50% align:center
'Kay, you wanna make
some dipping sauce?

00:15:29.596 --> 00:15:30.722 position:50% align:center
I don't know how.

00:15:30.805 --> 00:15:32.724 position:50% align:center
Um, but what were you
going to eat it with

00:15:32.807 --> 00:15:34.851 position:50% align:center
if I hadn't come in to help you?

00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:36.811 position:50% align:center
Soy sauce maybe?

00:15:36.895 --> 00:15:38.938 position:50% align:center
Oh, really? Is it
any good that way?

00:15:39.022 --> 00:15:41.149 position:50% align:center
Of course not, dummy.

00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:45.362 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] No Shigure? I guess
he must be asleep, huh.

00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:50.075 position:50% align:center
Maybe. With his weird sleeping
schedule, who knows?

00:15:50.158 --> 00:15:52.827 position:50% align:center
I had a lot of fun over
at Master's house today.

00:15:52.911 --> 00:15:53.787 position:50% align:center
Did you?

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:55.497 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Yeah!

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:58.875 position:50% align:center
But, you know, I was
surprised about his hair.

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.461 position:50% align:center
It's kind of a shame
he chopped it all off.

00:16:01.544 --> 00:16:05.173 position:50% align:center
What's the big deal though?
It's not like he's a woman.

00:16:05.256 --> 00:16:07.801 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Why do you think
he decided to cut it?

00:16:07.884 --> 00:16:09.678 position:50% align:center
Does it really matter?

00:16:09.761 --> 00:16:12.389 position:50% align:center
Well, it was a superstitious
habit anyway.

00:16:12.472 --> 00:16:13.723 position:50% align:center
Besides, these days,

00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:16.226 position:50% align:center
I figured a certain someone
wouldn't cry about it.

00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:19.187 position:50% align:center
Who knows why he does anything?

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:20.397 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.357 position:50% align:center
What's that look for?

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.817 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's nothing!

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.318 position:50% align:center
Hey, I've been wondering.

00:16:25.402 --> 00:16:27.570 position:50% align:center
Do you think you'll take over
Master's dojo for him

00:16:27.654 --> 00:16:29.197 position:50% align:center
when you're older?

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.950 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Might not be possible.

00:16:32.033 --> 00:16:34.285 position:50% align:center
I'm possessed by the Cat,

00:16:34.369 --> 00:16:37.414 position:50% align:center
so even if Master
says he wants me to,

00:16:37.497 --> 00:16:40.709 position:50% align:center
the Soma family can
always overrule him.

00:16:40.792 --> 00:16:42.293 position:50% align:center
And if I mess up...

00:16:42.377 --> 00:16:43.378 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Until death.

00:16:43.461 --> 00:16:44.796 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:47.132 --> 00:16:51.302 position:50% align:center
[KYO] Nah, don't worry about
that. It doesn't matter.

00:16:51.386 --> 00:16:53.555 position:50% align:center
Anyway, when you're the Cat,

00:16:53.638 --> 00:16:57.100 position:50% align:center
this sorta stuff
isn't easy to answer.

00:16:57.183 --> 00:17:00.186 position:50% align:center
People ask what my plans
for the future are,

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:02.230 position:50% align:center
and it's like I don't even
know what kind of life

00:17:02.313 --> 00:17:05.608 position:50% align:center
I'll be allowed have, you know?

00:17:05.692 --> 00:17:08.695 position:50% align:center
I'm at a loss just
thinking about all that.

00:17:10.613 --> 00:17:11.364 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Hm?

00:17:11.448 --> 00:17:13.408 position:50% align:center
Okay, what's with that face?

00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:14.951 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Huh?

00:17:15.035 --> 00:17:18.079 position:50% align:center
[KYO] I mean, of all people.
I figured you would understand.

00:17:18.163 --> 00:17:21.291 position:50% align:center
Huh? Me? Why do you say that?

00:17:21.374 --> 00:17:23.209 position:50% align:center
Those plans you made before,

00:17:23.293 --> 00:17:25.670 position:50% align:center
graduating and
then getting a job,

00:17:25.754 --> 00:17:27.630 position:50% align:center
they were for your mom's sake.

00:17:27.714 --> 00:17:30.633 position:50% align:center
Stuff you decided
when she was alive.

00:17:30.717 --> 00:17:32.719 position:50% align:center
But she's not around anymore,

00:17:32.802 --> 00:17:35.221 position:50% align:center
and I'm sure sometimes you
wonder how things'll change

00:17:35.305 --> 00:17:37.640 position:50% align:center
now that you're on your own.

00:17:37.724 --> 00:17:40.310 position:50% align:center
No, I don't. Not really.

00:17:40.393 --> 00:17:42.562 position:50% align:center
I mean, well, I'm sure

00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:47.025 position:50% align:center
I'll get a good job,
and... I'll work hard.

00:17:48.651 --> 00:17:50.612 position:50% align:center
Then what's wrong?

00:17:52.489 --> 00:17:57.160 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] But... it's not
actually that simple, is it?

00:17:57.243 --> 00:18:00.538 position:50% align:center
Will I be able to
find a decent job?

00:18:00.622 --> 00:18:05.126 position:50% align:center
Even if I work hard, will I
be able to make ends meet?

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:07.587 position:50% align:center
What will life be like
after graduation?

00:18:07.671 --> 00:18:10.965 position:50% align:center
In three years? In ten years?

00:18:11.049 --> 00:18:15.220 position:50% align:center
When this house isn't
my home anymore?

00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:17.138 position:50% align:center
When I think about
those things too much,

00:18:17.222 --> 00:18:19.516 position:50% align:center
I realize I don't
have the answers.

00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:22.394 position:50% align:center
I don't know who to turn
to or what I would say.

00:18:22.477 --> 00:18:25.980 position:50% align:center
I get this vague
feeling of anxiety.

00:18:26.064 --> 00:18:32.195 position:50% align:center
It swells up, sweeps me away.
And I can't seem to shake it.

00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:34.280 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:34.364 --> 00:18:35.949 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
That's what he meant.

00:18:36.032 --> 00:18:38.576 position:50% align:center
What Yuki was trying to tell me.

00:18:41.705 --> 00:18:45.083 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Please. Please stop, Kyo.

00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:47.085 position:50% align:center
Stop what?

00:18:47.168 --> 00:18:51.047 position:50% align:center
Stop making me look
closer. I can't.

00:18:51.131 --> 00:18:54.426 position:50% align:center
I have to keep acting
like everything is okay.

00:18:54.509 --> 00:18:58.388 position:50% align:center
Because if I don't, then...
then I'll start crying

00:18:58.471 --> 00:19:01.141 position:50% align:center
and I won't be able to stop.

00:19:01.224 --> 00:19:03.560 position:50% align:center
I'm used to all the
waterworks by now.

00:19:03.643 --> 00:19:05.770 position:50% align:center
Just don't get your
snot everywhere.

00:19:05.854 --> 00:19:08.606 position:50% align:center
Can we talk about you instead?

00:19:09.983 --> 00:19:11.359 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
The thing is,

00:19:11.443 --> 00:19:14.195 position:50% align:center
I get the feeling that your
Master is waiting for you.

00:19:14.279 --> 00:19:16.448 position:50% align:center
If something's wrong,
he'll be there,

00:19:16.531 --> 00:19:19.576 position:50% align:center
but you have to take
the first step.

00:19:19.659 --> 00:19:21.202 position:50% align:center
If you keep bottling
it up like this,

00:19:21.286 --> 00:19:23.955 position:50% align:center
that's only gonna make things
harder on both of you.

00:19:24.039 --> 00:19:25.999 position:50% align:center
Hey, you'll break it.

00:19:26.082 --> 00:19:28.043 position:50% align:center
Calm down already.

00:19:28.126 --> 00:19:30.962 position:50% align:center
I get it, okay?

00:19:31.046 --> 00:19:36.259 position:50% align:center
Jeez. You might be the
biggest crybaby I've ever met.

00:19:38.178 --> 00:19:40.889 position:50% align:center
It sounds like someone's
in need of advice.

00:19:40.972 --> 00:19:43.558 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Oh, Shigure. I didn't
know you were awake.

00:19:43.641 --> 00:19:45.268 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
I haven't been for long.

00:19:45.352 --> 00:19:47.437 position:50% align:center
Poor Tohru. Don't cry.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.898 position:50% align:center
Hey, Kyo, why are you
lurking in the corner?

00:19:49.981 --> 00:19:53.276 position:50% align:center
[KYO] Jerk! He definitely
did that on purpose!

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.153 position:50% align:center
You see, Tohru, my dear,

00:19:55.236 --> 00:19:57.697 position:50% align:center
if thinking about something
makes you anxious,

00:19:57.781 --> 00:19:59.991 position:50% align:center
then you're better off
not thinking about it.

00:20:00.075 --> 00:20:01.451 position:50% align:center
I am?

00:20:01.534 --> 00:20:04.037 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] Also, you may want
to invest in some tissues.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:07.999 position:50% align:center
Not making sense? Okay,
let's try something else.

00:20:08.083 --> 00:20:10.752 position:50% align:center
Picture this: You're surrounded
by a mountain of laundry

00:20:10.835 --> 00:20:13.505 position:50% align:center
so immense you can't
see over the top of it.

00:20:13.588 --> 00:20:16.466 position:50% align:center
And what's worse, you
have no washing machine,

00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:18.885 position:50% align:center
so you'll have to
do it all by hand.

00:20:18.968 --> 00:20:21.137 position:50% align:center
Obviously, you're overwhelmed.

00:20:21.221 --> 00:20:24.641 position:50% align:center
You look around you and
the doubts start flooding in.

00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:26.601 position:50% align:center
Will you be able
to clean it all?

00:20:26.685 --> 00:20:30.730 position:50% align:center
How long will it take?
Can you do it well enough?

00:20:30.814 --> 00:20:33.483 position:50% align:center
And the more you think,
the more anxious you get.

00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:36.486 position:50% align:center
Time ticks by, but
you feel paralyzed.

00:20:36.569 --> 00:20:40.699 position:50% align:center
So what do you do now, Tohru?

00:20:40.782 --> 00:20:42.826 position:50% align:center
If you ask me, your best bet

00:20:42.909 --> 00:20:46.287 position:50% align:center
is to start by washing the
laundry that's at your feet.

00:20:46.371 --> 00:20:48.665 position:50% align:center
It's important to think
about what's ahead,

00:20:48.748 --> 00:20:50.750 position:50% align:center
but if you focus
on that too much,

00:20:50.834 --> 00:20:53.670 position:50% align:center
you'll trip over what's
right in front of you.

00:20:53.753 --> 00:20:57.132 position:50% align:center
Keep washing, one piece
of laundry at a time,

00:20:57.215 --> 00:21:01.678 position:50% align:center
and before you know it,
there you'll be.

00:21:01.761 --> 00:21:06.016 position:50% align:center
Staring up at the sun
in a bright blue sky.

00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:09.227 position:50% align:center
And sure, you'll still
get anxious sometimes,

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:12.689 position:50% align:center
but when that happens,
just take a little break.

00:21:12.772 --> 00:21:16.943 position:50% align:center
Read a book. Watch
some TV. And...

00:21:17.027 --> 00:21:20.196 position:50% align:center
If all else fails,
eat <i>somen</i> with your friends.

00:21:22.032 --> 00:21:25.160 position:50% align:center
Whoa, amazing! Was that a
great talk or what, folks?

00:21:25.243 --> 00:21:27.746 position:50% align:center
And how considerate of you
to invite me to join your meal

00:21:27.829 --> 00:21:29.330 position:50% align:center
as thanks for my sage advice.

00:21:29.414 --> 00:21:32.667 position:50% align:center
[KYO] Bastard. You just
wanted some of our <i>somen</i> !

00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:36.796 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:21:37.839 --> 00:21:38.965 position:50% align:center
Miss Honda?

00:21:39.049 --> 00:21:40.216 position:50% align:center
Good, you're awake.

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:43.762 position:50% align:center
I thought you might be,
but I wasn't sure, so...

00:21:43.845 --> 00:21:45.055 position:50% align:center
Um...

00:21:45.138 --> 00:21:47.182 position:50% align:center
Something the matter?

00:21:47.265 --> 00:21:50.060 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Earlier, you seemed anxious.

00:21:50.143 --> 00:21:53.480 position:50% align:center
I know how you feel,
and it's tough.

00:21:53.563 --> 00:21:57.484 position:50% align:center
So I thought,
if you wanted to...

00:21:59.069 --> 00:22:01.821 position:50% align:center
We could all eat <i>somen</i> together!

00:22:01.905 --> 00:22:03.406 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:04.991 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Oh, my!

00:22:05.075 --> 00:22:07.118 position:50% align:center
You know what they say about
pink <i>somen</i> , right, Kyo?

00:22:07.202 --> 00:22:08.453 position:50% align:center
It puts you in the mood.

00:22:08.536 --> 00:22:09.913 position:50% align:center
Who says?!

00:22:09.996 --> 00:22:11.998 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] Eee! Look out,
everyone! Kyo's feeling feisty!

00:22:12.082 --> 00:22:13.500 position:50% align:center
--Disgusting.
--[KYO] Shut up!

00:22:13.583 --> 00:22:16.294 position:50% align:center
[KYO] He's obviously full
of it, you damn Rat!

00:22:17.587 --> 00:22:20.090 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Nothing seems quite as bad

00:22:20.173 --> 00:22:23.593 position:50% align:center
after a good meal with
people you care about.

00:23:57.812 --> 00:24:00.440 position:50% align:center
[MINE] "Shall we go
and get you changed?"
