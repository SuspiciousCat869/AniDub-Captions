[YUKI]
As different as we might be...

00:00:16.141 --> 00:00:17.934 position:50% align:center
...I realized there
was at least one way

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:20.603 position:50% align:center
in which Rin and I were similar.

00:00:22.105 --> 00:00:24.691 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] We were yearning
for the same thing.

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:58.702 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
All right. It's settled, then.

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:00.745 position:50% align:center
We'll do <i>Cinderella</i>
for our class play.

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:02.872 position:50% align:center
We'll be voting on
the roles tomorrow,

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:05.208 position:50% align:center
so please think
about your choices.

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:08.378 position:50% align:center
'Kay, that's all we've
got for today, guys.

[STUDENTS chattering]

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.592 position:50% align:center
<i>Cinderella</i> . So we get to bring
an old fairytale to life. Fun!

00:02:14.676 --> 00:02:17.137 position:50% align:center
Right, guys? Uh?

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.680 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU gasps]

00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:20.724 position:50% align:center
I guess <i>Cinderella</i> wasn't
your first choice, huh?

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:23.226 position:50% align:center
The votes have been cast
and our fates are sealed.

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:24.227 position:50% align:center
Accept it.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.520 position:50% align:center
Ugh. This is lame!

00:02:25.603 --> 00:02:28.189 position:50% align:center
I was hoping for
a historical play.

00:02:28.273 --> 00:02:30.650 position:50% align:center
We shoulda done something
cool like <i>Mito Komoan</i> .

00:02:30.734 --> 00:02:32.902 position:50% align:center
I wanted to be the one
to whip out the seal box!

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:35.030 position:50% align:center
Oh! That was Suke, right?

00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:36.948 position:50% align:center
Seriously? <i>Cinderella</i> ?

00:02:37.032 --> 00:02:39.451 position:50% align:center
It's not like we're in
elementary school, people.

00:02:39.534 --> 00:02:40.952 position:50% align:center
Come on!

00:02:41.036 --> 00:02:43.455 position:50% align:center
[HANAJIMA] Did you want to
reveal the seal box that badly?

00:02:43.538 --> 00:02:45.290 position:50% align:center
Aw, sorry.

00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:47.625 position:50% align:center
But hey, at least finding
out the roles tomorrow

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:48.835 position:50% align:center
should be fun.

00:02:48.918 --> 00:02:49.919 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI] I think we all
know that the Prince

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:51.713 position:50% align:center
will be playing the prince.

00:02:51.796 --> 00:02:56.051 position:50% align:center
Uh. Actually, I don't plan to
accept any of the bigger roles.

00:02:56.134 --> 00:02:57.886 position:50% align:center
I've got too much going on.

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:01.473 position:50% align:center
Student council's enough to deal
with on top of everything else.

00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:02.891 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI sighs]

00:03:02.974 --> 00:03:05.769 position:50% align:center
Guess bein' the president's
a pretty tough gig, huh?

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:08.605 position:50% align:center
There's our wayward
Yun-Yun! Let's go!

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:10.398 position:50% align:center
You wanna be late
to the meeting?

00:03:10.482 --> 00:03:12.233 position:50% align:center
Right, sorry. I'm coming.

00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:14.069 position:50% align:center
Um, Yuki?

00:03:14.152 --> 00:03:16.446 position:50% align:center
Don't push yourself too hard.

00:03:17.405 --> 00:03:19.741 position:50% align:center
I'm fine. Thank you, though.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:23.703 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Honestly, Yun-Yun,

00:03:23.787 --> 00:03:25.121 position:50% align:center
when're you gonna
get a cell phone?

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:27.540 position:50% align:center
You use it that much? Really?

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:29.751 position:50% align:center
Yeah, all the time.

00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:33.171 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I'd need a parent to sign
the contract for me, though.

00:03:33.254 --> 00:03:36.716 position:50% align:center
And? What's the problem with
that? You not on good terms?

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.511 position:50% align:center
No, it's more like... I dunno.

00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:43.139 position:50% align:center
I guess, our relationship's like
a shirt that's buttoned wrong.

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:44.432 position:50% align:center
[MANABE gasps]

00:03:44.516 --> 00:03:47.268 position:50% align:center
That's it. Exactly!
That totally makes sense!

00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:48.603 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:48.687 --> 00:03:51.606 position:50% align:center
Yep. Yep. Like a shirt with
the buttons all wonky.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.483 position:50% align:center
You're right on the
money there. Yep, yep.

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:55.985 position:50% align:center
Uh, why are you agreeing
with yourself?

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.153 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:03:58.613 --> 00:03:59.864 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Uh.

00:03:59.948 --> 00:04:02.492 position:50% align:center
[MANABE] It's a... a villain!
A real evil-doer!

00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:04.327 position:50% align:center
The School Defense Force
finally has the chance

00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:05.745 position:50% align:center
to show our stuff.

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:07.789 position:50% align:center
This is so freakin' cool!
Do you think we might die?

00:04:07.872 --> 00:04:10.000 position:50% align:center
You look way too happy
about that prospect.

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:11.209 position:50% align:center
Wooo!

00:04:11.292 --> 00:04:13.670 position:50% align:center
Is someone in there
ransacking the place?

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:16.006 position:50% align:center
Stop cheering, idiot!

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.099 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Machi.

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:31.521 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] The room. This is
just like that other time.

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:33.732 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Ugh.

00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:36.818 position:50% align:center
Here we go again.
You're killin' me with this.

00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:40.405 position:50% align:center
What are--?

00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:41.531 position:50% align:center
Hey, what happened in here?

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:43.533 position:50% align:center
Uh! Was it a poltergeist?

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:45.535 position:50% align:center
[NAOHITO]
Don't be ridiculous!

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:49.122 position:50% align:center
You guys. Do you think you
could let me take care of this?

00:04:49.205 --> 00:04:51.124 position:50% align:center
Like, pretend you
didn't see anything

00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:53.501 position:50% align:center
and forget that it
ever happened maybe?

00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:55.128 position:50% align:center
No way! How could
you even ask that?

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:56.796 position:50% align:center
Okay, then I'll leave it to you.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.173 position:50% align:center
[NAOHITO, KIMI]
Huh?

00:04:58.256 --> 00:05:00.759 position:50% align:center
We need to get to the meeting,
but take your time.

00:05:00.842 --> 00:05:02.218 position:50% align:center
Great, thanks.

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:04.679 position:50% align:center
And I think it's safe to say
that we'll be missing it.

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:07.682 position:50% align:center
Right. Let's go, Nao, Kimi.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.143 position:50% align:center
You're not serious, are you?

00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:12.771 position:50% align:center
You can't just turn a blind eye
to something like that!

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:14.272 position:50% align:center
Haven't you heard
the rumors about how

00:05:14.356 --> 00:05:16.399 position:50% align:center
she goes around
destroying things?

00:05:16.483 --> 00:05:18.651 position:50% align:center
She's some kind of
out-of-control weirdo.

00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:21.654 position:50% align:center
Breaking chairs, flipping
boxes, throwing books--

00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:23.156 position:50% align:center
crazy stuff like that.

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:25.492 position:50% align:center
Maybe it's just her psycho
way of dealing with stress,

00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:28.370 position:50% align:center
but the rest of us shouldn't
have to put up with that crap.

00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:29.704 position:50% align:center
President, we need
to get back there--

00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:32.791 position:50% align:center
And we will. We'll clean
up properly later.

00:05:32.874 --> 00:05:35.418 position:50% align:center
I'm not talking about
the mess though!

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:39.172 position:50% align:center
Leave her be.

00:05:39.255 --> 00:05:41.383 position:50% align:center
Aww! So fierce, Yun-Yun!

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:43.927 position:50% align:center
Kimi's poor heart
can't handle it.

00:05:46.262 --> 00:05:48.723 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I know Machi
was responsible,

00:05:48.807 --> 00:05:53.019 position:50% align:center
but I don't feel like I should
make a big deal of it.

00:05:53.103 --> 00:05:55.605 position:50% align:center
I'm sure she has a reason.

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:57.899 position:50% align:center
But we need to calm
her down first.

00:05:57.982 --> 00:06:01.152 position:50% align:center
It sounds like Kakeru
knows what's going on.

00:06:01.236 --> 00:06:06.074 position:50% align:center
Honestly, their relationship
always seemed a little odd.

00:06:06.157 --> 00:06:09.369 position:50% align:center
They seem close, but not like
they're dating or anything.

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:10.912 position:50% align:center
Yeah, totally insane!

00:06:10.995 --> 00:06:13.623 position:50% align:center
Come on! Who has the
budget for this nonsense?

00:06:13.707 --> 00:06:15.458 position:50% align:center
What moron submitted it?

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:18.628 position:50% align:center
[KIMI] We need to ask anyway.
Anybody support this proposal?

00:06:18.712 --> 00:06:20.213 position:50% align:center
[NAOHITO]
Nobody! Reject it! Rejected!

00:06:20.296 --> 00:06:21.381 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT COUNCIL A]
This'll never fly.

00:06:21.464 --> 00:06:23.341 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT COUNCIL B]
Yeah, right? Heh.

00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:26.261 position:50% align:center
Hey, welcome back.
I hope the meeting went okay.

00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:28.888 position:50% align:center
Wha--? You haven't
finished cleaning up yet?

00:06:28.972 --> 00:06:29.973 position:50% align:center
Where's Machi?

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:31.141 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Went home.

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:34.144 position:50% align:center
[NAOHITO] She went home?
Why did she leave?

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:37.022 position:50% align:center
She left 'cause she left,
what else can I say?

00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:38.481 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see.

00:06:38.565 --> 00:06:41.317 position:50% align:center
Thought she'd take off and
leave her work for us to do?

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:43.153 position:50% align:center
Well, in that case,
I'm a bit indisposed,

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:46.114 position:50% align:center
so I guess I'll head
out early, too!

00:06:46.197 --> 00:06:49.451 position:50% align:center
I can't work like this! Idiots!

00:06:50.452 --> 00:06:53.955 position:50% align:center
[MANABE] Jeez, what's shorty got
his knickers in a knot about?

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:56.833 position:50% align:center
There are any number of things
that could be bothering him.

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:59.044 position:50% align:center
He didn't finish, either.

00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:02.380 position:50% align:center
Right. Stay here and get
the rest of this cleaned up.

00:07:02.464 --> 00:07:04.966 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Aww. You're not gonna help me?

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.177 position:50% align:center
I have things to do, too.

00:07:09.012 --> 00:07:11.931 position:50% align:center
Fly!

00:07:12.015 --> 00:07:15.185 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Are you crazy?
What did you do that for?

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:17.687 position:50% align:center
--These papers are important!
--[MANABE] I don't get it.

00:07:18.897 --> 00:07:22.317 position:50% align:center
[MANABE] Why does Machi
do this all the time?

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.820 position:50% align:center
She refuses to explain
anything to me.

00:07:25.904 --> 00:07:29.824 position:50% align:center
When I asked if it was my
fault, she just took off.

00:07:29.908 --> 00:07:33.078 position:50% align:center
You think maybe...
she's depressed?

00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:35.455 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:37.332 position:50% align:center
Maybe.

00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:42.170 position:50% align:center
Hey, um, Machi and you.
Are you close?

00:07:42.253 --> 00:07:44.005 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Sure we are.

00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:46.716 position:50% align:center
She's my sister.
My little sister.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.343 position:50% align:center
We're siblings.

00:07:48.426 --> 00:07:49.803 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:52.097 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that totally makes sense.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.473 position:50% align:center
It does.

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:57.352 position:50% align:center
Uh. Now you're the one
who's agreeing with himself.

00:07:57.435 --> 00:08:00.480 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Wait, but they don't
have the same last name.

00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:03.983 position:50% align:center
So in your family, they
fight about successorship?

00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:08.196 position:50% align:center
Uh, we don't. At least,
not that I'm aware of.

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:09.948 position:50% align:center
Why, does yours?

00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:11.616 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.036 position:50% align:center
I mean, we did, anyway.
It got a little ugly.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.246 position:50% align:center
Our dad's pretty loaded,

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:18.456 position:50% align:center
and that complicates
things, you know?

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.459 position:50% align:center
Everyone argued about
who would get what.

00:08:21.543 --> 00:08:22.836 position:50% align:center
Oh, right.

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:25.672 position:50% align:center
I guess I should mention
we've got different moms.

00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:29.009 position:50% align:center
I'm older, but my mom
was our dad's mistress.

00:08:29.092 --> 00:08:31.052 position:50% align:center
Machi's the daughter
of his legit wife,

00:08:31.136 --> 00:08:33.930 position:50% align:center
but she's a girl and
a year younger than me.

00:08:34.014 --> 00:08:36.182 position:50% align:center
Our moms got into a huge fight,

00:08:36.266 --> 00:08:40.895 position:50% align:center
each of 'em arguing that their
child should be our dad's heir.

00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:42.981 position:50% align:center
Their competition was fierce.

00:08:43.064 --> 00:08:47.360 position:50% align:center
Machi and I both had very
strict upbringings as a result.

00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:50.071 position:50% align:center
At first, I did everything
I was told to do,

00:08:50.155 --> 00:08:53.033 position:50% align:center
trying to be what they wanted.

00:08:53.116 --> 00:08:54.576 position:50% align:center
You know how it is.

00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:57.829 position:50% align:center
When you're a kid, you think
your parents are always right.

00:08:57.912 --> 00:09:01.499 position:50% align:center
But one day, I realized
there was something off

00:09:01.583 --> 00:09:04.044 position:50% align:center
about the way we were living.

00:09:04.127 --> 00:09:09.215 position:50% align:center
The adults had gotten us mixed
up in a really dumb situation.

00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:10.925 position:50% align:center
--[MANABE yells]
--[MACHI'S MOTHER screams]

00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:13.762 position:50% align:center
[MANABE] That's when I started
becoming my own person.

00:09:13.845 --> 00:09:15.013 position:50% align:center
I threw a fit;

00:09:15.096 --> 00:09:16.931 position:50% align:center
told 'em I wouldn't go
along with their crap.

00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:18.266 position:50% align:center
Glad I did.

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:20.560 position:50% align:center
Turns out that was the
wake-up call my mom needed.

00:09:20.643 --> 00:09:22.771 position:50% align:center
She stopped arguing
about the inheritance

00:09:22.854 --> 00:09:25.190 position:50% align:center
and I was finally free of it.

00:09:25.273 --> 00:09:29.069 position:50% align:center
There ya go. My life story.

00:09:29.152 --> 00:09:31.738 position:50% align:center
Is that it?

00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:36.910 position:50% align:center
I'm free, but Machi might still
feel trapped by all of it.

00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:39.162 position:50% align:center
That kinda thing
doesn't just go away.

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:43.375 position:50% align:center
Stuff's not quite right with
me and my parents even now.

00:09:43.458 --> 00:09:47.087 position:50% align:center
You know how it is.
You said it before.

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:50.048 position:50% align:center
It's like your shirt's
buttoned up wrong.

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:53.218 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
I mean, come on!

00:09:53.301 --> 00:09:56.221 position:50% align:center
What decade are these
people living in, anyway?

00:09:56.304 --> 00:09:59.891 position:50% align:center
Who seriously gives a crap if
their heir's a dude or a chick?

00:09:59.974 --> 00:10:01.768 position:50% align:center
I can't believe those idiots,

00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:04.896 position:50% align:center
dragging their kids
into a mess like that.

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:08.274 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:10:08.358 --> 00:10:11.111 position:50% align:center
Well, okay. What's up with you?

00:10:11.194 --> 00:10:14.406 position:50% align:center
Going a little crazy,
too, are ya?

00:10:14.489 --> 00:10:18.702 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] The thing is,
you have live with it.

00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:24.249 position:50% align:center
Even if they're idiotic,
or oblivious, or infuriating.

00:10:24.332 --> 00:10:26.209 position:50% align:center
Children can't
choose their parents

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:31.089 position:50% align:center
any more than parents
can choose their children.

00:10:31.172 --> 00:10:37.429 position:50% align:center
Like them or not,
they are who they are, so...

00:10:37.512 --> 00:10:39.931 position:50% align:center
...you just have
to live with it.

00:10:44.436 --> 00:10:46.187 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Guess so.

00:10:46.271 --> 00:10:49.107 position:50% align:center
And maybe try to
re-button your shirt.

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:51.401 position:50% align:center
Nah, it doesn't need to
be buttoned perfectly.

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:54.112 position:50% align:center
It's good enough the way it is,
so I might as well leave it.

00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:57.157 position:50% align:center
Uh. Good enough?
What do you mean?

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.075 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Exactly what I said?

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:01.411 position:50% align:center
Here, Yun-Yun, check me out.
How does it look?

00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:02.328 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Awful.

00:11:02.412 --> 00:11:04.205 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Uh! That was brutal.

00:11:04.289 --> 00:11:06.458 position:50% align:center
Come on. You look goofy.

00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:07.876 position:50% align:center
Yeah! There ya go.

00:11:07.959 --> 00:11:10.003 position:50% align:center
Sometimes you just
gotta laugh it off.

00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:13.506 position:50% align:center
Accept that there's only so much
you can do and then let it go.

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:16.718 position:50% align:center
You make absolutely no sense
half the time, you know that?

00:11:16.801 --> 00:11:19.471 position:50% align:center
[MANABE] Hey now, just hear
me out. It's like this.

00:11:19.554 --> 00:11:21.639 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Everyone has their own secrets,

00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:23.516 position:50% align:center
their own burdens to bear.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.518 position:50% align:center
All of us.

00:11:25.602 --> 00:11:31.691 position:50% align:center
Kakeru, Machi, me...
and even our parents.

00:11:32.984 --> 00:11:35.612 position:50% align:center
I signed it.
Is that all you needed?

00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:36.988 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Mhm.

00:11:37.072 --> 00:11:38.740 position:50% align:center
Is Dad getting back
late today, too?

00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:42.285 position:50% align:center
He is. You know how busy
your father and I are.

00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:44.537 position:50% align:center
Anything besides the
cell phone contract?

00:11:44.621 --> 00:11:48.208 position:50% align:center
I'm set. I just needed
a parent's signature.

00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:49.668 position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:11:51.294 --> 00:11:53.380 position:50% align:center
[SERVANT A] Ma'am, you should
really be on your way now

00:11:53.463 --> 00:11:56.007 position:50% align:center
if you don't want to be late.

00:11:56.091 --> 00:11:57.842 position:50% align:center
[YUKI'S MOTHER]
Yes, I'm aware.

00:11:57.926 --> 00:11:59.886 position:50% align:center
Well, I'll see ya later.

00:11:59.969 --> 00:12:01.388 position:50% align:center
[YUKI'S MOTHER]
Yuki.

00:12:01.471 --> 00:12:07.185 position:50% align:center
Th... This new phone.
Don't let it distract you.

00:12:07.268 --> 00:12:08.478 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Hm?

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.065 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I don't remember her ever saying

00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:15.193 position:50% align:center
anything like that to me before.

00:12:15.276 --> 00:12:18.154 position:50% align:center
She sounded... like a parent.

00:12:18.238 --> 00:12:19.948 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Yeah! There ya go!

00:12:20.031 --> 00:12:23.243 position:50% align:center
Sometimes you just
gotta laugh it off.

00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:28.790 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Maybe someday we can
look back at this and laugh.

00:12:28.873 --> 00:12:30.834 position:50% align:center
All of us.

00:12:30.917 --> 00:12:32.210 position:50% align:center
[NAOHITO]
Unacceptable.

00:12:32.293 --> 00:12:34.838 position:50% align:center
These forms appear to have
been crumpled slightly.

00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:36.006 position:50% align:center
Do they?

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:38.633 position:50% align:center
I'm sure it's all
in your head, shorty.

00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:42.721 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT D] Yuki, are we
really gonna have a bonfire

00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:44.222 position:50% align:center
at this year's festival?

00:12:44.305 --> 00:12:47.809 position:50% align:center
I heard that there are gonna
be fireworks, too. So cool!

00:12:47.892 --> 00:12:50.687 position:50% align:center
Hey, Prez! Heard the
festival's gonna be wild.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:53.273 position:50% align:center
I'm super excited about
the big fireworks show!

00:12:53.356 --> 00:12:55.275 position:50% align:center
And there's gonna be
sweet potatoes, right?

00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:56.818 position:50% align:center
Roasted over the bonfire?

00:12:56.901 --> 00:12:59.195 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:02.282 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sounds great.
All of it does.

00:13:02.365 --> 00:13:04.367 position:50% align:center
So great that you'd think
people would realize

00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:06.077 position:50% align:center
it's completely impossible.

00:13:06.161 --> 00:13:07.620 position:50% align:center
Really.

00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:10.874 position:50% align:center
Are they stupid? I'm so tired
of setting people straight.

00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:12.751 position:50% align:center
I wonder what Neandertal
put that proposal

00:13:12.834 --> 00:13:14.961 position:50% align:center
into the suggestion
box, anyway.

00:13:15.045 --> 00:13:16.463 position:50% align:center
And how'd these
dumb rumors about it

00:13:16.546 --> 00:13:18.590 position:50% align:center
start circulating the school?

00:13:18.673 --> 00:13:20.633 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing we have
the proposal's creator

00:13:20.717 --> 00:13:21.760 position:50% align:center
to thank for that.

00:13:21.843 --> 00:13:23.386 position:50% align:center
[NAOHITO]
It's irresponsible!

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:26.556 position:50% align:center
I'd like to know who did it.
Just what they were thinking?

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:28.725 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Oh, hey, Yun-Yun.

00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:31.811 position:50% align:center
That proposal I submitted for
the campfire and fireworks,

00:13:31.895 --> 00:13:34.356 position:50% align:center
you think it's gonna
be accepted, or--?

00:13:34.439 --> 00:13:37.192 position:50% align:center
So you did this to us.

00:13:37.275 --> 00:13:39.027 position:50% align:center
Unsurprisingly,
that useless proposal

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:42.030 position:50% align:center
was unanimously rejected at the
meeting you missed yesterday.

00:13:42.113 --> 00:13:43.782 position:50% align:center
Hey, don't call it useless!

00:13:43.865 --> 00:13:45.784 position:50% align:center
I put a lot of thought
into writing that.

00:13:45.867 --> 00:13:47.786 position:50% align:center
Those were some rockin' ideas.

00:13:47.869 --> 00:13:49.913 position:50% align:center
Ideas that you blabbed
about to the whole school,

00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:52.040 position:50% align:center
giving us a mountain
of rumors to deal with.

00:13:52.123 --> 00:13:54.250 position:50% align:center
I figured it would pass
for sure, so why not?

00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:57.796 position:50% align:center
You're incredible.
How can anyone be so cocky?

00:13:57.879 --> 00:13:59.798 position:50% align:center
And without reason,
since it failed.

00:13:59.881 --> 00:14:01.383 position:50% align:center
How could it, though?

00:14:01.466 --> 00:14:02.926 position:50% align:center
[KIMI]
Hi, boys!

00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:05.220 position:50% align:center
We bumped into each
other just now,

00:14:05.303 --> 00:14:07.889 position:50% align:center
so Kimi and Machi came together.

00:14:07.972 --> 00:14:11.184 position:50% align:center
Oh. Well, that's good.

00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:13.937 position:50% align:center
[MANABE] I'm free, but Machi
might still feel trapped

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.939 position:50% align:center
by all of it.

00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:17.190 position:50% align:center
[NAOHITO]
Kuragi!

00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:19.943 position:50% align:center
What on earth were you
thinking yesterday?

00:14:21.361 --> 00:14:25.198 position:50% align:center
I know I caused a lot of trouble
and I'm very sorry about that.

00:14:25.281 --> 00:14:29.911 position:50% align:center
I'll do better. It won't
happen again. I promise.

00:14:29.994 --> 00:14:31.663 position:50% align:center
[NAOHITO]
We're supposed to believe that?

00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:34.666 position:50% align:center
After the same thing's
happened multiple times?

00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:37.043 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
"It won't happen again."

00:14:37.127 --> 00:14:41.965 position:50% align:center
That's a start, but can you
open up to us a bit more?

00:14:42.048 --> 00:14:46.094 position:50% align:center
Saying things'll change
only goes so far.

00:14:46.177 --> 00:14:47.470 position:50% align:center
If we're going to believe you,

00:14:47.554 --> 00:14:49.973 position:50% align:center
we need to understand
why you did it.

00:14:51.224 --> 00:14:52.475 position:50% align:center
Whoa, that's some deep stuff!

00:14:52.559 --> 00:14:53.685 position:50% align:center
I don't know about that.

00:14:53.768 --> 00:14:56.271 position:50% align:center
Always so kind! That's our boy!

00:14:56.354 --> 00:14:58.523 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Hey, enough. Stop teasing me.

00:14:58.606 --> 00:14:59.941 position:50% align:center
[KIMI]
Kimi's not teasing, though!

00:15:00.025 --> 00:15:01.651 position:50% align:center
Ugh. I can't take this anymore.

00:15:01.735 --> 00:15:03.778 position:50% align:center
[KIMI]
You're sweet and considerate--

00:15:03.862 --> 00:15:05.947 position:50% align:center
like a prince in a fairy tale!

00:15:06.031 --> 00:15:08.867 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
That's not true. Really.

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:10.118 position:50% align:center
[KIMI giggles]

00:15:10.201 --> 00:15:12.620 position:50% align:center
[KIMI] Did you hear that?
He's humble, too!

00:15:12.704 --> 00:15:14.956 position:50% align:center
Prince! I totally forgot!

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.336 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I'm late.

00:15:19.419 --> 00:15:20.587 position:50% align:center
[VICE-PRESIDENT A]
Glad you could make it.

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:23.089 position:50% align:center
We were just tallying
up the votes now.

00:15:23.173 --> 00:15:24.507 position:50% align:center
[KINOSHITA]
Hey, Yuki!

00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:25.717 position:50% align:center
Obviously, you would've been

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.844 position:50% align:center
everyone's first choice
to play the prince.

00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:30.013 position:50% align:center
It's such a shame
you turned it down.

00:15:30.096 --> 00:15:31.723 position:50% align:center
Are you sure you won't
change your mind?

00:15:31.806 --> 00:15:34.351 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I really am too busy.

00:15:34.434 --> 00:15:36.353 position:50% align:center
And besides, I don't
think I'm actually

00:15:36.436 --> 00:15:37.896 position:50% align:center
the best person for the role.

00:15:37.979 --> 00:15:40.482 position:50% align:center
[IWATA, KINOSHITA, CHIE]
That's 100% untrue!

00:15:40.565 --> 00:15:43.443 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] All right,
now to announce the cast.

00:15:43.526 --> 00:15:46.237 position:50% align:center
Godmother: Yuki Soma.

00:15:46.321 --> 00:15:48.573 position:50% align:center
Stepsister: Tohru Honda.

00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:49.699 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU gasps]

00:15:49.783 --> 00:15:50.867 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS chattering]

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.370 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Stepmother: Minami Kinoshita.

00:15:53.453 --> 00:15:54.704 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Hm?

00:15:54.788 --> 00:15:58.750 position:50% align:center
Cinderella: Saki Hanajima.

00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:01.878 position:50% align:center
Prince: Kyo Soma.

00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:02.671 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Hm?

00:16:02.754 --> 00:16:03.755 position:50% align:center
Not happening!

00:16:03.838 --> 00:16:05.006 position:50% align:center
Yes it is!

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:06.966 position:50% align:center
Better just accept your
fate, Prince Kyon-Kyon.

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:10.053 position:50% align:center
I think it's a great idea.
Long live the prince!

00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:10.762 position:50% align:center
[YUSUKE laughs]

00:16:10.845 --> 00:16:12.722 position:50% align:center
Ha, ha, ha! Shut up!

00:16:12.806 --> 00:16:15.642 position:50% align:center
What makes you people think
I know anything about acting?

00:16:15.725 --> 00:16:17.102 position:50% align:center
You'll get some
laughs, at least.

00:16:17.185 --> 00:16:19.771 position:50% align:center
[KYO] It's a freakin'
fairytale, not a comedy!

00:16:19.854 --> 00:16:22.190 position:50% align:center
How exciting that you were
cast as the prince, Kyo!

00:16:22.273 --> 00:16:25.735 position:50% align:center
It's wonderful! Master Kazuma
will be so proud of you!

00:16:25.819 --> 00:16:29.322 position:50% align:center
Please don't tell him.
Not a single word about this.

00:16:29.406 --> 00:16:33.118 position:50% align:center
Seriously, guys, take a sec
to think it through.

00:16:33.201 --> 00:16:35.203 position:50% align:center
This cast is a train wreck!

00:16:35.286 --> 00:16:36.746 position:50% align:center
Can you think of a worse person

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:39.874 position:50% align:center
to play Cinderella
than Hanajima?

00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:43.253 position:50% align:center
Come now, sweet prince.
This will be fun.

00:16:43.336 --> 00:16:44.796 position:50% align:center
[HIROSHI]
Scary!

00:16:44.879 --> 00:16:47.048 position:50% align:center
It's like the wicked
version of <i>Cinderella</i> !

00:16:47.132 --> 00:16:49.300 position:50% align:center
[YUSUKE]
Think her dress will be black?

00:16:49.384 --> 00:16:50.218 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Miss Honda?

00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:51.761 position:50% align:center
[gasps] What's up?

00:16:51.845 --> 00:16:53.221 position:50% align:center
So, your role.

00:16:53.304 --> 00:16:55.932 position:50% align:center
How do you feel about playing
the evil stepsister?

00:16:56.016 --> 00:16:57.559 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:57.642 --> 00:16:59.227 position:50% align:center
I totally got this.

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:00.812 position:50% align:center
I'll be the evilest
evil stepsister

00:17:00.895 --> 00:17:02.564 position:50% align:center
the world's ever seen!

00:17:02.647 --> 00:17:04.190 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I don't think she can do it.

00:17:04.274 --> 00:17:07.318 position:50% align:center
Just wait till you see
how evil I can be.

00:17:07.402 --> 00:17:08.903 position:50% align:center
[CHIE]
Heh. Nice!

00:17:08.987 --> 00:17:10.488 position:50% align:center
You are a genius.

00:17:10.572 --> 00:17:14.159 position:50% align:center
The plan to cast Tohru Honda as
a heinous villain is a success.

00:17:14.242 --> 00:17:16.286 position:50% align:center
Wave Girl landing the
lead role was a surprise,

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:17.620 position:50% align:center
but we can deal with it.

00:17:17.704 --> 00:17:20.248 position:50% align:center
Tohru Honda's finally
getting what she deserves!

00:17:20.331 --> 00:17:21.750 position:50% align:center
[KINOSHITA laughs]

00:17:21.833 --> 00:17:23.460 position:50% align:center
Let's see how Yuki
likes her now.

00:17:23.543 --> 00:17:25.503 position:50% align:center
When she gets up on
stage acting all evil,

00:17:25.587 --> 00:17:28.131 position:50% align:center
it'll probably make him
sick to his stomach.

00:17:28.214 --> 00:17:30.800 position:50% align:center
[CHIE] But, um, aren't you
the evil stepmother?

00:17:30.884 --> 00:17:31.885 position:50% align:center
[KINOSHITA gasps]

00:17:31.968 --> 00:17:34.179 position:50% align:center
Karma is the absolute worst.

00:17:34.262 --> 00:17:36.890 position:50% align:center
Okay, that's all
for today, everybody.

00:17:36.973 --> 00:17:39.559 position:50% align:center
Um, is it all right if
I step back out, then?

00:17:39.642 --> 00:17:41.895 position:50% align:center
Oh, sure. Thanks
a lot for coming.

00:17:41.978 --> 00:17:44.981 position:50% align:center
Do you still have more work to
do for student council today?

00:17:45.065 --> 00:17:46.274 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:17:46.358 --> 00:17:48.902 position:50% align:center
Um, well, don't push yoursel--

00:17:55.658 --> 00:17:59.162 position:50% align:center
Just do your best, okay?

00:18:01.373 --> 00:18:02.165 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
Tohru.

00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:04.209 position:50% align:center
Um, yes? What is it?

00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:06.211 position:50% align:center
Do something about
Carrots over here.

00:18:06.294 --> 00:18:08.797 position:50% align:center
He needs to suck it up
and play his part.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.466 position:50% align:center
You're all screwing with
me like you always do.

00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:12.884 position:50% align:center
Just leave me alone!

00:18:12.967 --> 00:18:14.844 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
What you do next...

00:18:16.012 --> 00:18:20.392 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Do you keep relying
on somebody else? Or...

00:18:23.144 --> 00:18:25.522 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey. Is it just
the two of you?

00:18:25.605 --> 00:18:27.107 position:50% align:center
It sure is!

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:30.735 position:50% align:center
Kakeru and Machi went to do some
shopping. They seem so close.

00:18:30.819 --> 00:18:33.446 position:50% align:center
Huh. Whatcha think that's
about, Nao- <i>chan</i> ?

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:34.531 position:50% align:center
[NAOHITO]
I care a lot less about...

00:18:34.614 --> 00:18:35.907 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I guess they're keeping it quiet

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:38.034 position:50% align:center
that they're half-siblings.

00:18:38.118 --> 00:18:41.246 position:50% align:center
Hey, President, where'd
last year's order form go?

00:18:41.329 --> 00:18:45.291 position:50% align:center
Uh. Not sure. Good question.
In the storage room?

00:18:45.375 --> 00:18:48.878 position:50% align:center
Wait, Yun-Yun. I wouldn't
go in there if I were you.

00:18:48.962 --> 00:18:50.296 position:50% align:center
Why?

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:53.299 position:50% align:center
[KIMI] The lock broke yesterday,
so if the door shuts...

00:18:54.551 --> 00:18:56.511 position:50% align:center
Oh, no! Yun-Yun!

00:18:56.594 --> 00:18:58.847 position:50% align:center
Kimi tried to warn you.
She really did!

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:00.724 position:50% align:center
You should've done it sooner!

00:19:00.807 --> 00:19:03.727 position:50% align:center
[KIMI] Um, I think the
lightbulb's burned out, too.

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:05.020 position:50% align:center
[NAOHITO]
Again, that's information

00:19:05.103 --> 00:19:07.439 position:50% align:center
that would have been
helpful to know earlier!

00:19:07.522 --> 00:19:08.398 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I could kick it.

00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:10.066 position:50% align:center
No, no! Please don't do that!

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:12.736 position:50% align:center
There's been enough
destruction around here lately.

00:19:12.819 --> 00:19:15.989 position:50% align:center
Hold on. I'll go find
someone to help us.

00:19:16.072 --> 00:19:20.076 position:50% align:center
Hang tight. We will be
back in a flash, okay?

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.328 position:50% align:center
Yeah, okay.

00:19:22.412 --> 00:19:24.080 position:50% align:center
How pathetic.

00:19:24.164 --> 00:19:26.833 position:50% align:center
Probably not something a
real prince would do, right?

00:19:26.916 --> 00:19:30.170 position:50% align:center
Getting himself locked
inside a dark closet.

00:19:30.253 --> 00:19:32.547 position:50% align:center
Now what?

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:35.592 position:50% align:center
Maybe she was wrong
about the lightbulb?

00:19:35.675 --> 00:19:37.385 position:50% align:center
[clatter]

00:19:39.012 --> 00:19:42.098 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Great, there's paint everywhere.

00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:45.060 position:50% align:center
Why did someone leave
an open can up there?

00:19:45.143 --> 00:19:46.895 position:50% align:center
And it's black.

00:19:50.732 --> 00:19:54.194 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
You're so pathetic, Yuki.

00:19:54.277 --> 00:19:57.238 position:50% align:center
Your optimistic delusions
are painful to watch.

00:19:57.322 --> 00:20:01.242 position:50% align:center
I mean, please. Give it up.

00:20:01.326 --> 00:20:05.580 position:50% align:center
I can tell, you know.
You can't hide it from me.

00:20:05.663 --> 00:20:11.002 position:50% align:center
What you want so desperately.
What it is that you yearn for.

00:20:11.086 --> 00:20:14.297 position:50% align:center
From Tohru Honda.

00:20:14.381 --> 00:20:17.884 position:50% align:center
Come, now. You know, don't you?

00:20:17.967 --> 00:20:20.220 position:50% align:center
What you really want.

00:20:20.303 --> 00:20:23.056 position:50% align:center
[MANABE] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Stop nagging me!

00:20:35.568 --> 00:20:37.821 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:20:37.904 --> 00:20:39.239 position:50% align:center
[NAOHITO screams]

00:20:39.322 --> 00:20:40.657 position:50% align:center
No! The poor door!

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.117 position:50% align:center
[KIMI giggles]

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.661 position:50% align:center
Aw, no fair. I wanted to be
the one to break it down.

00:20:44.744 --> 00:20:47.080 position:50% align:center
Destruction of property
is no laughing matter!

00:20:47.163 --> 00:20:49.582 position:50% align:center
[KIMI] You said you would
change your ways, Machi.

00:20:49.666 --> 00:20:50.959 position:50% align:center
So much for that!

00:20:51.042 --> 00:20:52.669 position:50% align:center
[MANABE] I think we can make
an exception this time.

00:20:52.752 --> 00:20:54.129 position:50% align:center
Are you doin' okay there?

00:20:54.212 --> 00:20:56.297 position:50% align:center
You look like you saw
a ghost or something.

00:20:56.381 --> 00:20:58.425 position:50% align:center
Oh, do I?

00:20:58.508 --> 00:21:00.301 position:50% align:center
The paint fumes are
kind of getting to me.

00:21:00.385 --> 00:21:01.511 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Whoa, your sweater.

00:21:01.594 --> 00:21:02.762 position:50% align:center
You got splattered.

00:21:02.846 --> 00:21:05.223 position:50% align:center
[KIMI]
Better wash it off, Yun-Yun.

00:21:05.306 --> 00:21:06.516 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Yeah.

00:21:07.517 --> 00:21:10.562 position:50% align:center
Hey. Thanks for that.

00:21:10.645 --> 00:21:14.524 position:50% align:center
I thought you'd be anxious,
alone in the dark.

00:21:16.443 --> 00:21:19.988 position:50% align:center
[MANABE] Chop-chop! It'll
stain if you don't rinse it.

00:21:20.071 --> 00:21:21.114 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I'm gonna be sick.

00:21:21.197 --> 00:21:22.657 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Uh-oh.

00:21:25.368 --> 00:21:27.746 position:50% align:center
[MANABE] Here. You sure you
don't wanna see the nurse?

00:21:27.829 --> 00:21:31.750 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I'm fine. Just need
some fresh air, that's all.

00:21:31.833 --> 00:21:33.293 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
I don't blame you.

00:21:33.376 --> 00:21:36.087 position:50% align:center
Stuck in a small, dark room
with paint spilled everywhere,

00:21:36.171 --> 00:21:38.548 position:50% align:center
it'd make anyone sick.

00:21:38.631 --> 00:21:42.719 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] To be honest,
it wasn't just the paint fumes.

00:21:42.802 --> 00:21:46.056 position:50% align:center
It brought back
some bad memories.

00:21:46.139 --> 00:21:48.141 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Painful stuff?

00:21:48.224 --> 00:21:49.476 position:50% align:center
You could say that.

00:21:49.559 --> 00:21:52.604 position:50% align:center
Like what? Is it a shameful
secret? Tell Manabe.

00:21:52.687 --> 00:21:55.273 position:50% align:center
No, jeez! Why are you
always like this?

00:21:55.357 --> 00:21:58.026 position:50% align:center
Ugh! Just say it
straight out already!

00:21:58.109 --> 00:21:59.736 position:50% align:center
You can't expect
an idiot like me

00:21:59.819 --> 00:22:03.073 position:50% align:center
to guess what you're thinking.

00:22:03.156 --> 00:22:07.660 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] It's something
I haven't told anyone.

00:22:07.744 --> 00:22:11.373 position:50% align:center
Not even the person
at the heart of it.

00:22:11.456 --> 00:22:16.086 position:50% align:center
It's not shameful,
just pitiful and pathetic.

00:22:18.505 --> 00:22:24.219 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Because... what I truly
yearned for from her was...

00:23:57.062 --> 00:24:00.607 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
"There was, definitely."
