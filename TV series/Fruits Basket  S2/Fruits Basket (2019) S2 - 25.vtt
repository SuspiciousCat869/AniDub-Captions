[KURENO]
It came abruptly.

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:17.726 position:50% align:center
The end and the beginning.

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:20.186 position:50% align:center
[KURENO gasps]

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:26.568 position:50% align:center
[KURENO] I was free...
but still tethered.

00:02:07.043 --> 00:02:09.838 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Kureno, I'm cold.

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:17.846 position:50% align:center
Sorry. Would you like
another blanket? Some food?

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:21.182 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
No, just... come closer.

00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:23.184 position:50% align:center
Come closer to me.

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:28.982 position:50% align:center
[AKITO] Kureno, I can be
critical of you and even cruel,

00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:32.652 position:50% align:center
but sometimes, I just say
things without meaning to.

00:02:32.736 --> 00:02:35.280 position:50% align:center
You must know that about me.

00:02:35.363 --> 00:02:38.116 position:50% align:center
Instead of the inferior
creature that you've become.

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:42.328 position:50% align:center
They're just words, that's all.
Not what I really think.

00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:45.081 position:50% align:center
You understand that, don't you?

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:47.375 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
Yes.

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.670 position:50% align:center
You'll stay? You'll
always be here?

00:02:50.754 --> 00:02:52.714 position:50% align:center
By my side?

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:57.594 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
Yes.

00:03:02.057 --> 00:03:03.475 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Uo- <i>chan</i> .

00:03:03.558 --> 00:03:06.061 position:50% align:center
Hey, what's the matter?

00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:07.562 position:50% align:center
It's nothin'.

00:03:07.645 --> 00:03:11.024 position:50% align:center
Just thinkin' it's too cold out
here for such a nice day.

00:03:11.107 --> 00:03:13.276 position:50% align:center
Can't believe we have to sit
through graduation rehearsal

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.652 position:50% align:center
in this damn weather.

00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:17.197 position:50% align:center
They don't need us.
We're not graduating.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.032 position:50% align:center
I guess that's true.

00:03:19.115 --> 00:03:20.825 position:50% align:center
It's called "socialization."

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:23.870 position:50% align:center
Well, I'd better not catch a
cold for socialization's sake.

00:03:23.953 --> 00:03:25.413 position:50% align:center
[HANAJIMA]
Heh.

00:03:25.497 --> 00:03:29.542 position:50% align:center
Incidentally, did you know,
I have never had a cold before?

00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:32.003 position:50% align:center
I guess it's true that
idiots don't catch them.

00:03:32.087 --> 00:03:34.047 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
And you're proud of that?

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.967 position:50% align:center
This blows. I feel like I can't
get a break these days.

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:40.679 position:50% align:center
New Year's went by way too fast.

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:43.306 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
New Year's.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.227 position:50% align:center
A lot happened over
the holidays. A lot.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.354 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
It doesn't make sense.

00:03:49.437 --> 00:03:52.273 position:50% align:center
I woke up and I was lying down.

00:03:52.357 --> 00:03:54.192 position:50% align:center
I'm sure I fell asleep sitting.

00:03:54.275 --> 00:03:57.237 position:50% align:center
Sitting up? That doesn't
sound very comfortable.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.448 position:50% align:center
Well, maybe Master noticed
and laid you down.

00:04:00.532 --> 00:04:02.826 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
No. That's impossible.

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.036 position:50% align:center
It would've woken
me up for sure.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.288 position:50% align:center
No one could've touched me.

00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:10.250 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] You don't think
even Hatsuharu could've?

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:13.753 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Haru would be different.

00:04:13.837 --> 00:04:16.631 position:50% align:center
What makes you think there's
something between me and Haru?!

00:04:16.715 --> 00:04:18.174 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU yelps]

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:20.301 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU] Who was it? Who opened
their mouth and spilled it?

00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:23.263 position:50% align:center
Um, it wasn't anyone
in particular.

00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:25.140 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
No one actually told me.

00:04:25.223 --> 00:04:27.684 position:50% align:center
It's just, the way
they were talking.

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:30.645 position:50% align:center
But I really shouldn't
have said anything.

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:33.690 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Well, I mean, I, uh--

00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:36.943 position:50% align:center
Ah! It must've been a flash
of woman's intuition!

00:04:37.027 --> 00:04:41.698 position:50% align:center
Somehow it seems unlikely that's
a gift you actually possess.

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:46.327 position:50% align:center
Whatever. Just don't mention
his name to me again.

00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:47.787 position:50% align:center
We're not together anymore.

00:04:47.871 --> 00:04:49.664 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:04:49.748 --> 00:04:51.416 position:50% align:center
Miss Honda?

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:55.587 position:50% align:center
Oh, sorry. Am I... intruding?

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.423 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
No, you're fine. Don't worry.

00:04:58.506 --> 00:05:02.218 position:50% align:center
I came to say Happy New Year.
I hope it's a good one.

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:05.847 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Oh! Same to you. I'm sure--

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.516 position:50% align:center
Your forehead! Are you hurt?

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.186 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's nothing. A little cut.

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:14.439 position:50% align:center
What happened?
How did you get it?

00:05:14.522 --> 00:05:20.653 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Akito. I stood my ground
and paid the price for it.

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:24.491 position:50% align:center
And, well, to be honest,
I was pretty terrified.

00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:29.829 position:50% align:center
But... I bet you're proud
of me, aren't you?

00:05:32.207 --> 00:05:33.833 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU gasps]

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:36.503 position:50% align:center
I am.

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:40.298 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
And me?

00:05:40.382 --> 00:05:42.842 position:50% align:center
You should be proud of me, too!

00:05:42.926 --> 00:05:45.303 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Momiji! I didn't see you there.

00:05:45.387 --> 00:05:46.930 position:50% align:center
Happy New Year!

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:50.517 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] So you did something to
earn Miss Honda's praise, too?

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.935 position:50% align:center
Yep!

00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:54.729 position:50% align:center
All right, then I'll head home
and let you two talk.

00:05:54.813 --> 00:05:56.856 position:50% align:center
Great! Thanks, Yuki!

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.566 position:50% align:center
Tohru, Tohru!

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:02.904 position:50% align:center
I got it to Kureno,
just like we talked about.

00:06:02.987 --> 00:06:04.280 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU gasps]

00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:07.617 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI] I was scared.
I mean, what if Akito saw me?

00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:11.121 position:50% align:center
But still, I'm glad that
I went through with it.

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:13.915 position:50% align:center
That's... so great.

00:06:13.998 --> 00:06:18.044 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Hey, Tohru. Give me your hands.

00:06:18.128 --> 00:06:21.089 position:50% align:center
Let's pray that he'll watch it.

00:06:21.172 --> 00:06:23.174 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Please watch.

00:06:23.258 --> 00:06:27.929 position:50% align:center
See Uo- <i>chan</i> . Hear how
much she misses you.

00:06:28.013 --> 00:06:29.848 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
Tohru?

00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:32.142 position:50% align:center
Whatcha doin' standing there
with your eyes closed?

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:34.352 position:50% align:center
If you need a favor,
just name it, all right?

00:06:34.436 --> 00:06:36.771 position:50% align:center
Uh! No, I was thinking,
that's all.

00:06:36.855 --> 00:06:39.607 position:50% align:center
[HANAJIMA] Come on,
you two. Let's get going.

00:06:39.691 --> 00:06:41.067 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Right. Coming!

00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:42.902 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
Yeah.

00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:44.863 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Hear her.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.117 position:50% align:center
[HATORI] Akito's been in
bed since the New Year.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.079 position:50% align:center
As usual, it's emotional,
not physical.

00:06:53.163 --> 00:06:55.165 position:50% align:center
Seems especially bad though.

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:56.708 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
I think it's safe to assume

00:06:56.791 --> 00:06:59.794 position:50% align:center
Yuki's little show of defiance
had something to do with it.

00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:02.839 position:50% align:center
Have him tend to the
patient as his penance.

00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:04.883 position:50% align:center
I don't see that going well.

00:07:04.966 --> 00:07:07.427 position:50% align:center
Anyway, aren't you
going to visit Akito?

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.138 position:50% align:center
I thought that was
why you came today.

00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:14.684 position:50% align:center
Oh, I tried. No admittance.
I did get an earful, though.

00:07:14.768 --> 00:07:17.812 position:50% align:center
I guess my attitude leaves
something to be desired.

00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:19.189 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
You bastard!

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:21.649 position:50% align:center
Yuki was absolutely
horrible to me

00:07:21.733 --> 00:07:24.110 position:50% align:center
and you didn't come to
see how I was doing?

00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:27.322 position:50% align:center
Why are you always like that?
Selfish and stupid.

00:07:27.405 --> 00:07:31.326 position:50% align:center
Why don't you ever choose
to put me first for once?

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:33.453 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
You're one to talk.

00:07:33.536 --> 00:07:38.792 position:50% align:center
Seems to me you're the
one who chose Kureno.

00:07:38.875 --> 00:07:41.252 position:50% align:center
Akito didn't choose anybody.

00:07:41.336 --> 00:07:44.714 position:50% align:center
Everyone has people they're
closer to than others.

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:47.926 position:50% align:center
Even the God can play favorites.

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:50.053 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
But tell me, Hatori,

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:53.056 position:50% align:center
do you ever get a
feeling from Kureno?

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:57.519 position:50% align:center
Like there's something...
off about him?

00:07:57.602 --> 00:08:02.607 position:50% align:center
Something that sets him
apart from the rest of us.

00:08:05.694 --> 00:08:07.862 position:50% align:center
You don't accept it?

00:08:07.946 --> 00:08:12.117 position:50% align:center
Because you're scared?
Because it's sad?

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.244 position:50% align:center
Because you've grown
sentimentally attached

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:18.206 position:50% align:center
to the bond, even as
you chafe against it?

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:22.127 position:50% align:center
You fickle boy.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.879 position:50% align:center
You're the last person
I wanna hear that from.

00:08:24.963 --> 00:08:26.798 position:50% align:center
Ha. Yes, fair point.

00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:29.509 position:50% align:center
Truth is that I'm-- Hold on.

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:31.386 position:50% align:center
I seem to remember
saying this before.

00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:33.888 position:50% align:center
Who was I talking to?

00:08:33.972 --> 00:08:36.599 position:50% align:center
Oh, well. Doesn't really matter.

00:08:36.683 --> 00:08:39.644 position:50% align:center
At any rate, I'm weak,
unsympathetic,

00:08:39.728 --> 00:08:41.479 position:50% align:center
and utterly worthless.

00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:44.816 position:50% align:center
Essentially, I'm the
very worst kind of man.

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:46.943 position:50% align:center
You know, what gets
to me most about you

00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:48.528 position:50% align:center
is that you're aware
of those things

00:08:48.611 --> 00:08:50.739 position:50% align:center
and yet you don't feel
the slightest inclination

00:08:50.822 --> 00:08:52.949 position:50% align:center
to change any of them.

00:08:56.411 --> 00:08:59.789 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
A DVD? I wonder what's on it.

00:09:02.751 --> 00:09:06.212 position:50% align:center
I have a present from Tohru.

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:09.174 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
As long as you're alive,

00:09:09.257 --> 00:09:12.552 position:50% align:center
you'll keep finding new
things to wish for!

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:24.356 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE chattering]

00:09:24.439 --> 00:09:27.400 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Hey. Hey, Kureno.

00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:33.323 position:50% align:center
[AKITO] When you become a bird,
what does it feel like?

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:37.077 position:50% align:center
Flying through the
sky, totally free.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.454 position:50% align:center
Must be amazing.

00:09:39.537 --> 00:09:42.791 position:50% align:center
Well, is it fun? Exciting?

00:09:42.874 --> 00:09:47.337 position:50% align:center
You're so lucky.
Really, I'm jealous.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:50.757 position:50% align:center
I mean, I wish that I
could be a bird, too.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.259 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI] Wipe that pouty
look off your face!

00:09:53.343 --> 00:09:56.471 position:50% align:center
We're havin' this thing so you
can find someone to marry.

00:09:56.554 --> 00:09:57.931 position:50% align:center
Do you know how many
people out there

00:09:58.014 --> 00:10:01.142 position:50% align:center
are dying to see someone
they care about?

00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:04.354 position:50% align:center
I miss him. I really miss him.

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:07.982 position:50% align:center
Come and see me, dammit!

00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:09.234 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
And, um...

00:10:09.317 --> 00:10:10.568 position:50% align:center
When she thinks about the fact

00:10:10.652 --> 00:10:13.196 position:50% align:center
that she won't get
to see you anymore,

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:18.118 position:50% align:center
she looks sad and lonely.

00:10:18.201 --> 00:10:20.328 position:50% align:center
Swear that you won't abandon me!

00:10:20.412 --> 00:10:21.454 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:21.538 --> 00:10:26.543 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheering, applauding]

00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:40.473 position:50% align:center
[phone ringing]

00:10:40.557 --> 00:10:43.351 position:50% align:center
Yes, yes, yes. Coming.

00:10:44.769 --> 00:10:46.271 position:50% align:center
Hello.

00:10:48.815 --> 00:10:51.067 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Now this is unusual.

00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:53.903 position:50% align:center
Actually, I think it's a first.

00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:57.824 position:50% align:center
What? Tohru?
She's still at school.

00:10:57.907 --> 00:11:00.744 position:50% align:center
I can't see you two having
much to chat about.

00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:03.872 position:50% align:center
I didn't think you
even knew each other.

00:11:03.955 --> 00:11:05.665 position:50% align:center
If you were hoping
she'd answer the phone

00:11:05.749 --> 00:11:08.501 position:50% align:center
so you could keep your
conversation a secret,

00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:10.920 position:50% align:center
there was never
much chance of that.

00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:14.758 position:50% align:center
Surprisingly
featherbrained of you.

00:11:14.841 --> 00:11:16.885 position:50% align:center
What do you want with her?

00:11:17.969 --> 00:11:20.096 position:50% align:center
I wanted to tell her something.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:23.308 position:50% align:center
Something I should
probably tell you, too.

00:11:27.645 --> 00:11:30.607 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Here we are at last.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:33.485 position:50% align:center
Listen, Kureno,
can I ask about something

00:11:33.568 --> 00:11:35.653 position:50% align:center
I've been thinking for a while?

00:11:35.737 --> 00:11:42.035 position:50% align:center
All this time, is it possible
that you've actually been...?

00:11:42.118 --> 00:11:44.287 position:50% align:center
Another school day
officially complete!

00:11:44.371 --> 00:11:46.247 position:50% align:center
Welcome back. Just you?

00:11:46.331 --> 00:11:47.457 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Yep.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:48.583 position:50% align:center
Yuki had to stay late
for student council,

00:11:48.667 --> 00:11:51.419 position:50% align:center
and Kyo went to Master Kazuma's.

00:11:51.503 --> 00:11:53.963 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry to have to send
you back out so soon--

00:11:54.047 --> 00:11:56.299 position:50% align:center
I'm fresh out of envelopes.

00:11:56.383 --> 00:11:57.425 position:50% align:center
Think you could go get some?

00:11:57.509 --> 00:11:59.803 position:50% align:center
Of course. No problem!

00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:02.055 position:50% align:center
Is there anything else
I can pick up for you?

00:12:02.138 --> 00:12:03.181 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
That should be it.

00:12:03.264 --> 00:12:04.766 position:50% align:center
Oh, you can change first.

00:12:04.849 --> 00:12:07.852 position:50% align:center
It's okay. I'll go like this.

00:12:11.356 --> 00:12:13.858 position:50% align:center
You take care out there.

00:12:16.653 --> 00:12:18.279 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Envelopes.

00:12:18.363 --> 00:12:20.990 position:50% align:center
And I should get some more
trash bags while I'm at it.

00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:23.451 position:50% align:center
And maybe...

00:12:23.535 --> 00:12:25.954 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Some sparrows!

00:12:27.288 --> 00:12:29.290 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Aren't you adorable?!

00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:32.877 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, though.
I don't have any breadcrumbs.

00:12:35.046 --> 00:12:37.632 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] I can't believe
how friendly they are.

00:12:37.716 --> 00:12:39.551 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:39.634 --> 00:12:44.055 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] Is it possible
that you've actually been...?

00:12:44.139 --> 00:12:47.517 position:50% align:center
[AKITO screams]

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.145 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Where is he? Where's Kureno?

00:12:50.228 --> 00:12:51.396 position:50% align:center
[SERVANT A]
He went out.

00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:54.024 position:50% align:center
He said he had an urgent
matter to take care of.

00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:56.693 position:50% align:center
[HEAD SERVANT A] We insisted he
wait until you awoke at least,

00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:59.154 position:50% align:center
but it was no use,
he wouldn't listen.

00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:00.321 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:13:00.405 --> 00:13:01.489 position:50% align:center
Have you called him?

00:13:01.573 --> 00:13:03.992 position:50% align:center
We tried, but his phone
appears to be off.

00:13:04.075 --> 00:13:05.118 position:50% align:center
Go find him.

00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:07.454 position:50% align:center
At once.

00:13:07.537 --> 00:13:11.458 position:50% align:center
He's never left without
permission before. Never.

00:13:11.541 --> 00:13:15.503 position:50% align:center
So why now? Why?

00:13:16.671 --> 00:13:18.256 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:21.593 --> 00:13:23.345 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Kureno?

00:13:24.596 --> 00:13:28.141 position:50% align:center
I don't... understand.

00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:32.187 position:50% align:center
As soon as you came over,
the birds flew away.

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:37.609 position:50% align:center
But why would that be?
You're possessed by the Rooster.

00:13:37.692 --> 00:13:39.819 position:50% align:center
And the Somas who
have zodiac spirits,

00:13:39.903 --> 00:13:42.238 position:50% align:center
I thought their animals--

00:13:42.322 --> 00:13:44.449 position:50% align:center
They just show up on their own.

00:13:44.532 --> 00:13:47.285 position:50% align:center
Rats to the Rat,
rabbits to the Rabbit,

00:13:47.369 --> 00:13:49.162 position:50% align:center
and dogs to the Dog.

00:13:49.245 --> 00:13:52.123 position:50% align:center
Wait, are you?

00:13:52.207 --> 00:13:53.708 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:53.792 --> 00:13:57.003 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] We transform when
our bodies are weakened.

00:13:58.672 --> 00:14:01.966 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] Or when hugged
by the opposite sex.

00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:04.886 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
You see?

00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:07.222 position:50% align:center
I'm different now.

00:14:07.305 --> 00:14:09.974 position:50% align:center
I don't transform.

00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:15.563 position:50% align:center
Unlike the others,
my curse... has broken.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:21.778 position:50% align:center
Unlike the others...
my curse has broken.

00:14:23.363 --> 00:14:24.906 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
It happened years ago.

00:14:24.989 --> 00:14:27.992 position:50% align:center
I was slightly younger than you.

00:14:28.076 --> 00:14:33.289 position:50% align:center
And since then, I haven't
truly been one of them.

00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:35.125 position:50% align:center
Now...

00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:39.754 position:50% align:center
[AKITO] You're so lucky.
Really, I'm jealous.

00:14:39.838 --> 00:14:42.382 position:50% align:center
Now... I can't fly.

00:14:42.465 --> 00:14:44.050 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:44.134 --> 00:14:46.136 position:50% align:center
How'd the curse break?

00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:48.346 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:52.350 position:50% align:center
It was there,
and then it just wasn't.

00:14:52.434 --> 00:14:57.272 position:50% align:center
Without any warning...
the bond was severed.

00:14:58.982 --> 00:15:02.652 position:50% align:center
[KURENO] It was like my
field of vision opened up.

00:15:02.736 --> 00:15:08.992 position:50% align:center
Inside myself, there was
only me. No other presence.

00:15:09.075 --> 00:15:12.454 position:50% align:center
The sky looked so blue.

00:15:12.537 --> 00:15:17.083 position:50% align:center
When I thought about how I'd
never fly in that sky again,

00:15:17.167 --> 00:15:19.502 position:50% align:center
it made me sad.

00:15:19.586 --> 00:15:26.176 position:50% align:center
But at the same time, I felt
like I was finally... human.

00:15:27.135 --> 00:15:29.220 position:50% align:center
And I was happy.

00:15:30.513 --> 00:15:34.768 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] But... the other zodiac
members, they don't know.

00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:37.479 position:50% align:center
They still think that
you're the Rooster.

00:15:39.105 --> 00:15:42.859 position:50% align:center
If it broke, why do
you stay with Akito?

00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:46.446 position:50% align:center
I mean, there must be a reason.

00:15:46.529 --> 00:15:47.572 position:50% align:center
Something that binds you

00:15:47.655 --> 00:15:50.241 position:50% align:center
even though you're
not a zodiac member.

00:15:53.495 --> 00:15:55.121 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
Here.

00:15:55.205 --> 00:15:59.668 position:50% align:center
I thought you should have
this back. It's wasted on me.

00:15:59.751 --> 00:16:03.630 position:50% align:center
Sorry. That's all
I came to tell you.

00:16:04.756 --> 00:16:07.050 position:50% align:center
I won't see her again.

00:16:07.133 --> 00:16:09.678 position:50% align:center
I'll stay where I belong.

00:16:09.761 --> 00:16:11.513 position:50% align:center
With Akito.

00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:16.935 position:50% align:center
We met twice, Arisa and I.

00:16:17.018 --> 00:16:20.814 position:50% align:center
It's not as if we have
some long history.

00:16:20.897 --> 00:16:25.485 position:50% align:center
Just... two trivial,
insignificant meetings.

00:16:25.568 --> 00:16:26.736 position:50% align:center
If I never see her again,

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:32.450 position:50% align:center
they'll become trivial,
insignificant memories.

00:16:32.534 --> 00:16:35.078 position:50% align:center
Before they fade entirely.

00:16:36.287 --> 00:16:38.581 position:50% align:center
I doubt it'll take long.

00:16:40.125 --> 00:16:44.754 position:50% align:center
[KURENO] So you don't have
to worry. It's fine.

00:16:44.838 --> 00:16:46.214 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:51.219 --> 00:16:56.016 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI] If that's true,
why is your smile so sad?

00:16:56.099 --> 00:16:58.018 position:50% align:center
A trivial errand?

00:16:58.101 --> 00:17:01.896 position:50% align:center
Then I guess that's all
this is, too, isn't it?

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.024 position:50% align:center
When I ran into you before

00:17:04.107 --> 00:17:06.985 position:50% align:center
and you said we should
get lunch together...

00:17:07.068 --> 00:17:10.739 position:50% align:center
...it-it just...

00:17:10.822 --> 00:17:13.033 position:50% align:center
It made me feel really happy!

00:17:13.116 --> 00:17:15.118 position:50% align:center
Okay?

00:17:15.201 --> 00:17:17.912 position:50% align:center
Come and see me, dammit!

00:17:17.996 --> 00:17:20.957 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
I want to see her! I do!

00:17:21.041 --> 00:17:23.668 position:50% align:center
So badly.

00:17:23.752 --> 00:17:26.629 position:50% align:center
We only met twice, but...

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:31.676 position:50% align:center
Even so, it was the
first time I fell in love

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:36.765 position:50% align:center
since the curse broke
and I became truly human.

00:17:36.848 --> 00:17:40.685 position:50% align:center
I could embrace her.
Hold her in my arms.

00:17:40.769 --> 00:17:46.649 position:50% align:center
A touch that's only possible
because I'm no longer possessed.

00:17:46.733 --> 00:17:49.110 position:50% align:center
The other zodiac members
aren't so lucky--

00:17:49.194 --> 00:17:54.783 position:50% align:center
still tormented by the curse
I was freed from effortlessly.

00:17:54.866 --> 00:17:58.328 position:50% align:center
Me. I'm the only one.

00:17:58.411 --> 00:18:03.083 position:50% align:center
I can go where I want.
Love whom I choose.

00:18:03.166 --> 00:18:07.504 position:50% align:center
But... that's exactly
the reason.

00:18:07.587 --> 00:18:10.715 position:50% align:center
The reason I have to stay.

00:18:10.799 --> 00:18:14.803 position:50% align:center
To remain by Akito's
side forever.

00:18:14.886 --> 00:18:15.970 position:50% align:center
[AKITO wailing]

00:18:16.054 --> 00:18:17.180 position:50% align:center
[KURENO gasps]

00:18:17.263 --> 00:18:18.765 position:50% align:center
Akito.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.646 position:50% align:center
Akito, calm down.

00:18:24.729 --> 00:18:27.524 position:50% align:center
What did you do?
What's the matter, Akito?

00:18:27.607 --> 00:18:31.945 position:50% align:center
Stay away! Nobody come
near me until I say so!

00:18:32.028 --> 00:18:32.987 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
Akit--

00:18:33.071 --> 00:18:34.572 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
I'll kill anybody who tries!

00:18:34.656 --> 00:18:36.741 position:50% align:center
I will, I swear!

00:18:39.119 --> 00:18:40.787 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
Akito?

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:46.584 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Why? Why? Why? Why?

00:18:46.668 --> 00:18:51.715 position:50% align:center
Why did it have to break? Why?

00:18:51.798 --> 00:18:52.966 position:50% align:center
It's our bond.

00:18:53.049 --> 00:18:57.595 position:50% align:center
I don't know. It just
happened out of nowhere.

00:18:57.679 --> 00:18:59.139 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Out of nowhere?

00:18:59.222 --> 00:19:00.932 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
I don't understand.

00:19:01.016 --> 00:19:05.562 position:50% align:center
One second, it was
there, and then--

00:19:05.645 --> 00:19:09.024 position:50% align:center
What's that look in your eyes?

00:19:09.107 --> 00:19:12.193 position:50% align:center
It changed when-- No.

00:19:12.277 --> 00:19:13.194 position:50% align:center
Akito.

00:19:13.278 --> 00:19:16.990 position:50% align:center
Your eyes. They're so distant.

00:19:17.073 --> 00:19:21.995 position:50% align:center
But why? Why now?
Why did this happen?

00:19:22.078 --> 00:19:23.538 position:50% align:center
No!

00:19:23.621 --> 00:19:26.541 position:50% align:center
Don't go! Don't go!
Don't go! Don't go!

00:19:26.624 --> 00:19:29.669 position:50% align:center
Swear you won't go anywhere!
You can't leave me!

00:19:29.753 --> 00:19:32.130 position:50% align:center
Stay by my side! No matter what!

00:19:32.213 --> 00:19:34.674 position:50% align:center
Swear you'll stay
by my side forever!

00:19:34.758 --> 00:19:37.010 position:50% align:center
Don't leave me behind!

00:19:37.093 --> 00:19:39.804 position:50% align:center
Swear it. Swear it!

00:19:39.888 --> 00:19:43.767 position:50% align:center
Swear that you won't abandon me!

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:45.977 position:50% align:center
Kureno.

00:19:46.061 --> 00:19:49.731 position:50% align:center
Please. Please!

00:19:49.814 --> 00:19:54.486 position:50% align:center
I'm begging you,
Kureno. Don't go!

00:19:56.529 --> 00:19:58.156 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
I couldn't do it.

00:19:58.239 --> 00:20:00.867 position:50% align:center
I couldn't leave.

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:05.997 position:50% align:center
To Akito, the zodiac members'
bonds are everything.

00:20:06.081 --> 00:20:10.543 position:50% align:center
The truth is, without us,
the God can't exist.

00:20:10.627 --> 00:20:14.130 position:50% align:center
So the day my curse broke,
I made a promise.

00:20:14.214 --> 00:20:18.718 position:50% align:center
I swore not to leave.
No matter what.

00:20:18.802 --> 00:20:23.348 position:50% align:center
No matter what, I'll
always be by your side.

00:20:23.431 --> 00:20:27.686 position:50% align:center
I swear it. Okay?

00:20:27.769 --> 00:20:29.437 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
Really...

00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:32.941 position:50% align:center
...I would've said anything
to make those tears stop.

00:20:34.109 --> 00:20:36.903 position:50% align:center
I knew that it meant
deceiving the others

00:20:36.986 --> 00:20:40.615 position:50% align:center
and pretending I was
still the Rooster.

00:20:40.699 --> 00:20:42.659 position:50% align:center
But if it would ease
that child's pain,

00:20:42.742 --> 00:20:45.870 position:50% align:center
it was a price I was
willing to pay.

00:20:48.873 --> 00:20:50.500 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
So it was pity?

00:20:50.583 --> 00:20:54.087 position:50% align:center
I mean, the curse
was already broken,

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:57.048 position:50% align:center
so your bond would've
been severed, too.

00:20:57.132 --> 00:20:59.634 position:50% align:center
Leaving may have been better
for everyone involved,

00:20:59.718 --> 00:21:01.386 position:50% align:center
including Akito.

00:21:01.469 --> 00:21:05.223 position:50% align:center
And you know, it's not too late.

00:21:06.975 --> 00:21:08.768 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
I made a promise.

00:21:08.852 --> 00:21:11.062 position:50% align:center
I can't leave!

00:21:11.146 --> 00:21:13.857 position:50% align:center
It's true that the
curse is broken,

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:18.319 position:50% align:center
and the bond I felt back then
disappeared with it.

00:21:19.863 --> 00:21:23.700 position:50% align:center
When we embrace, it may be
out of pity on my part,

00:21:23.783 --> 00:21:28.496 position:50% align:center
but I swore to stay.

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:31.166 position:50% align:center
Over and over.

00:21:31.249 --> 00:21:33.835 position:50% align:center
And so I will.

00:21:33.918 --> 00:21:39.132 position:50% align:center
Until the day Akito no longer
needs me, I'll be there...

00:21:39.215 --> 00:21:42.510 position:50% align:center
Always.

00:21:42.594 --> 00:21:45.805 position:50% align:center
I decided I would
live for that child,

00:21:45.889 --> 00:21:50.268 position:50% align:center
whose tiny body was
racked with sobs.

00:21:50.352 --> 00:21:56.900 position:50% align:center
Weaker than anyone.
More fragile than anyone.

00:21:56.983 --> 00:22:03.656 position:50% align:center
I would give anything...
for that child.

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:08.828 position:50% align:center
For the sake of that sad,
broken... little girl.

00:22:08.912 --> 00:22:10.580 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:22:12.374 --> 00:22:14.834 position:50% align:center
You said "girl."

00:22:14.918 --> 00:22:17.504 position:50% align:center
You mean Akito...

00:22:19.673 --> 00:22:21.925 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:22:22.008 --> 00:22:24.552 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Akito is a woman?
