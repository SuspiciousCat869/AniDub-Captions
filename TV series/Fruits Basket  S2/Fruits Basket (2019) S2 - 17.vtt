00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.413 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Paper clay?

00:15:13.496 --> 00:15:16.666 position:50% align:center
[HIROSHI] Hey, guys!
We're going by bus next!

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.668 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
All right. Let's go, Tohru.

00:15:18.752 --> 00:15:19.961 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Okay!

00:15:20.045 --> 00:15:21.921 position:50% align:center
So, Yuki, have you thought
about what souvenir

00:15:22.005 --> 00:15:23.423 position:50% align:center
you might want for yourself?

00:15:23.506 --> 00:15:28.219 position:50% align:center
For me? Well... Umm...

00:15:28.303 --> 00:15:29.554 position:50% align:center
I don't think I need one.

00:15:29.637 --> 00:15:32.766 position:50% align:center
As long as I can make
good memories of the trip.

00:15:32.849 --> 00:15:34.392 position:50% align:center
Or something.

00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:43.360 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Don't worry.
You will. I'm sure of it.

00:15:43.443 --> 00:15:46.488 position:50% align:center
Ones you'll keep
your whole life.

00:15:47.781 --> 00:15:52.619 position:50% align:center
They'll shine softly
inside of you. Forever.

00:15:54.746 --> 00:15:57.082 position:50% align:center
Or something.

00:15:57.165 --> 00:15:59.626 position:50% align:center
I'm sure.

00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:02.128 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Thank you.

00:16:02.212 --> 00:16:06.716 position:50% align:center
I can never tell for sure
how much of me you see.

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:12.764 position:50% align:center
My cowardice? My resolve?
I think you probably see both.

00:16:14.432 --> 00:16:19.104 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] And no matter what,
you keep smiling quietly for me.

00:16:21.064 --> 00:16:24.901 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] You're so precious
to me, even now.

00:16:26.736 --> 00:16:28.238 position:50% align:center
Uh. It's Yun-Yun!

00:16:28.321 --> 00:16:32.826 position:50% align:center
Hey-o! Yun-Yun!
Didja wake up on time today?

00:16:32.909 --> 00:16:35.954 position:50% align:center
Hey! Yun-Yun! You're not
ignoring me, are you?

00:16:36.037 --> 00:16:37.163 position:50% align:center
'Cause that wouldn't be

00:16:37.247 --> 00:16:39.833 position:50% align:center
a very presidential
thing to do, ya know?

00:16:39.916 --> 00:16:41.543 position:50% align:center
You've sure got a lot of energy.

00:16:41.626 --> 00:16:43.253 position:50% align:center
Yep, and it's a good thing, too.

00:16:43.336 --> 00:16:45.338 position:50% align:center
I've gotta shop till
I drop over here.

00:16:45.422 --> 00:16:48.216 position:50% align:center
I'll be spending some serious
cash in shipping fees.

00:16:48.299 --> 00:16:50.343 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Whoa, you do have a lot.

00:16:50.427 --> 00:16:51.845 position:50% align:center
What are you going
to do with all that?

00:16:51.928 --> 00:16:55.432 position:50% align:center
Give 'em to people, dummy.
Coworkers, neighbors, et cetera.

00:16:55.515 --> 00:16:57.100 position:50% align:center
Had some special
requests, as well.

00:16:57.183 --> 00:17:00.353 position:50% align:center
I feel kinda weird not getting
anything for Machi and Nao.

00:17:00.437 --> 00:17:01.771 position:50% align:center
Don't you?

00:17:01.855 --> 00:17:04.566 position:50% align:center
No, why should I? I mean,
they passed, didn't they?

00:17:04.649 --> 00:17:06.818 position:50% align:center
Besides, kids don't
need to be getting

00:17:06.901 --> 00:17:08.695 position:50% align:center
presents and treats
all the time.

00:17:08.778 --> 00:17:11.031 position:50% align:center
No spoiling, that's
my parenting style.

00:17:11.114 --> 00:17:12.032 position:50% align:center
Kind but firm!

00:17:12.115 --> 00:17:13.616 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Parenting style?

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.202 position:50% align:center
Anyway, you flying
solo right now?

00:17:16.286 --> 00:17:18.204 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Everyone split up.

00:17:18.288 --> 00:17:21.583 position:50% align:center
Well, I've got some extra time.
Wanna take a stroll?

00:17:21.666 --> 00:17:24.252 position:50% align:center
Uh. Oh, sure.

00:17:24.336 --> 00:17:26.087 position:50% align:center
[MANABE sighs]

00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:30.675 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
So, Prez.

00:17:30.759 --> 00:17:33.345 position:50% align:center
You in the same group
as Honda for the trip?

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:39.184 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I've noticed you
ask about her a lot.

00:17:39.267 --> 00:17:41.895 position:50% align:center
Why are you so
interested in her?

00:17:41.978 --> 00:17:44.481 position:50% align:center
You curious about
our relationship?

00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:46.149 position:50% align:center
[MANABE grunts]

00:17:46.232 --> 00:17:48.943 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
It's hard to admit...

00:17:49.027 --> 00:17:51.988 position:50% align:center
...but the truth is,
I kinda like her.

00:17:52.072 --> 00:17:54.616 position:50% align:center
What if I said that?

00:17:54.699 --> 00:17:56.034 position:50% align:center
Don't care.

00:17:56.117 --> 00:17:58.203 position:50% align:center
If you like her,
that's your business,

00:17:58.286 --> 00:18:01.289 position:50% align:center
and if she likes you back,
that's her business.

00:18:01.373 --> 00:18:04.918 position:50% align:center
I don't have any
right to interfere.

00:18:05.001 --> 00:18:09.589 position:50% align:center
But if you get close to
her as some kind of joke,

00:18:09.673 --> 00:18:12.926 position:50% align:center
or chase after her simply
out of idle curiosity,

00:18:13.009 --> 00:18:16.346 position:50% align:center
then you'll be making
it my business.

00:18:16.429 --> 00:18:21.935 position:50% align:center
If you hurt her,
I won't forgive you. Ever.

00:18:22.018 --> 00:18:23.937 position:50% align:center
Do you understand?

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:27.691 position:50% align:center
That's something I
could never forgive.

00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:31.986 position:50% align:center
Let's say that did happen--

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:34.864 position:50% align:center
that I turned out to
be that kinda guy--

00:18:34.948 --> 00:18:36.991 position:50% align:center
then what would you do?

00:18:38.159 --> 00:18:40.412 position:50% align:center
Then we wouldn't be friends.

00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:46.042 position:50% align:center
Not... friends?

00:18:46.126 --> 00:18:49.504 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Uh! Where did that
lame threat come from?

00:18:49.587 --> 00:18:51.965 position:50% align:center
I'm not some snotty little
kid on a playground!

00:18:52.048 --> 00:18:53.091 position:50% align:center
I sound like an idiot.

00:18:53.174 --> 00:18:55.719 position:50% align:center
He's going to make
fun of me for sure.

00:18:55.802 --> 00:18:57.262 position:50% align:center
Wait, that's not what I meant!

00:18:57.345 --> 00:18:58.847 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
What?

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:00.724 position:50% align:center
You can't go around saying you
won't be friends with people!

00:19:00.807 --> 00:19:02.100 position:50% align:center
That's totally
crossing the line!

00:19:02.183 --> 00:19:03.268 position:50% align:center
Think about all we'd be missing!

00:19:03.351 --> 00:19:04.269 position:50% align:center
We haven't even had the chance

00:19:04.352 --> 00:19:06.187 position:50% align:center
to discuss our
tastes in erotica!

00:19:06.271 --> 00:19:08.857 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Uh. That... worked?

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:12.068 position:50% align:center
Ooh, what's goin' on over here?
Talking about dirty stuff?

00:19:12.152 --> 00:19:13.945 position:50% align:center
Yun-Yun says we won't
be friends anymore

00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:15.780 position:50% align:center
unless I show him
all my naughty vids!

00:19:15.864 --> 00:19:17.449 position:50% align:center
I definitely did not say that!

00:19:17.532 --> 00:19:19.909 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I was kidding!
I would never do that!

00:19:19.993 --> 00:19:21.745 position:50% align:center
Learn how to take
a joke, will ya?

00:19:21.828 --> 00:19:23.747 position:50% align:center
Okay, just drop it already.

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:25.749 position:50% align:center
Uh. What's this about?

00:19:25.832 --> 00:19:27.167 position:50% align:center
Nothing. It's settled.

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:30.545 position:50% align:center
Well, um, I don't really
get what's happening,

00:19:30.628 --> 00:19:35.508 position:50% align:center
but Kimi will show you whatever
you wanna see... Yun-Yun.

00:19:35.592 --> 00:19:38.845 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Sorry, but can we
please change the subject?

00:19:38.928 --> 00:19:40.180 position:50% align:center
Can I see?

00:19:40.263 --> 00:19:42.599 position:50% align:center
Oh, please. Aren't you
devoted to your girlfriend?

00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:45.727 position:50% align:center
Uh. I didn't know you
had a girlfriend.

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:48.480 position:50% align:center
Jeez, you don't have to
look so surprised about it.

00:19:48.563 --> 00:19:50.899 position:50% align:center
Not only do I have one,
but she's super cute.

00:19:50.982 --> 00:19:52.525 position:50% align:center
I love her.

00:19:52.609 --> 00:19:54.527 position:50% align:center
Wait, does that mean we're
not friends anymore?

00:19:54.611 --> 00:19:56.363 position:50% align:center
Shut up! We dropped
it, remember?

00:19:56.446 --> 00:19:59.991 position:50% align:center
Okay... obviously Kimi is
missing something here.

00:20:00.075 --> 00:20:02.243 position:50% align:center
But, you know, a guy
who watches dirty videos

00:20:02.327 --> 00:20:03.411 position:50% align:center
even though he has a girlfriend

00:20:03.495 --> 00:20:05.872 position:50% align:center
doesn't sound like
he's very trustworthy.

00:20:05.955 --> 00:20:07.415 position:50% align:center
Gotta say,

00:20:07.499 --> 00:20:09.292 position:50% align:center
a girl who constantly flirts
with guys who have girlfriends

00:20:09.376 --> 00:20:11.544 position:50% align:center
doesn't sound
trustworthy, either.

00:20:11.628 --> 00:20:13.880 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
You both have valid points.

00:20:13.963 --> 00:20:15.382 position:50% align:center
[KIMI]
If the guy flirts back,

00:20:15.465 --> 00:20:17.634 position:50% align:center
maybe that means he doesn't
love his girlfriend enough.

00:20:17.717 --> 00:20:20.387 position:50% align:center
[MANABE] At least some of the
responsibility is yours, too.

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:22.263 position:50% align:center
[KIMI gasps]

00:20:22.347 --> 00:20:27.268 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Still, if he can talk so
easily about loving somebody,

00:20:27.352 --> 00:20:29.604 position:50% align:center
I guess he can't be all bad.

00:20:32.982 --> 00:20:34.359 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
And earlier,

00:20:34.442 --> 00:20:37.278 position:50% align:center
when I blurted out that stuff
about not being friends,

00:20:37.362 --> 00:20:40.573 position:50% align:center
I wasn't even thinking.

00:20:40.657 --> 00:20:46.037 position:50% align:center
But maybe that part of me
isn't so bad, either.

00:20:46.121 --> 00:20:50.166 position:50% align:center
I hope that when I look back
on the person I am now,

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:53.420 position:50% align:center
seeing him will make me smile.

00:20:53.503 --> 00:20:57.340 position:50% align:center
I wonder if I'll ever
feel that way.

00:20:57.424 --> 00:21:03.471 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Don't worry.
You will. I'm sure of it.

00:21:05.473 --> 00:21:08.476 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Here. I got you
a souvenir, Machi.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.396 position:50% align:center
They just came raining down.
It was beautiful.

00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:12.814 position:50% align:center
You want one, Nao?

00:21:12.897 --> 00:21:15.025 position:50% align:center
Why would I want a stupid leaf?

00:21:15.108 --> 00:21:17.027 position:50% align:center
Wow, ungrateful much?

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.279 position:50% align:center
We came here as soon
as we got back, too.

00:21:19.362 --> 00:21:20.947 position:50% align:center
You really are a
jerk, shortstack.

00:21:21.031 --> 00:21:23.366 position:50% align:center
[NAOHITO]
I said I didn't want anything!

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:27.454 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] They'll shine
softly... inside of you.

00:21:31.666 --> 00:21:32.917 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU groans]

00:21:33.001 --> 00:21:35.628 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I tried my best, but still...

00:21:35.712 --> 00:21:38.798 position:50% align:center
...they came out
a little off somehow.

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:42.594 position:50% align:center
Oh, well. At least
they're mostly done.

00:21:42.677 --> 00:21:43.595 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:21:43.678 --> 00:21:44.554 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Tohru, got a sec?

00:21:44.637 --> 00:21:46.389 position:50% align:center
Uh! Sure!

00:21:46.473 --> 00:21:48.516 position:50% align:center
What's up, Kyo?
Is something wrong?

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:52.103 position:50% align:center
[KYO] Nah, Shigure was asking
if you wanna eat out today.

00:21:52.187 --> 00:21:55.148 position:50% align:center
Wait, you haven't changed
out of your uniform yet?

00:21:55.231 --> 00:21:56.441 position:50% align:center
So tired you fell asleep?

00:21:56.524 --> 00:21:59.778 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. I just got
a little distracted.

00:21:59.861 --> 00:22:01.237 position:50% align:center
Distracted?

00:22:01.321 --> 00:22:05.158 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, um, I wanted
to get them all finished.

00:22:05.241 --> 00:22:07.827 position:50% align:center
The zodiac figurines.

00:22:07.911 --> 00:22:11.373 position:50% align:center
I guess it's silly.
They're not very well made.

00:22:11.456 --> 00:22:14.042 position:50% align:center
And I haven't colored
them all yet.

00:22:15.794 --> 00:22:17.420 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
You idiot.

00:22:19.172 --> 00:22:22.634 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Add color and they will shine.

00:23:57.479 --> 00:23:59.230 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
"Do you wanna kiss?"
