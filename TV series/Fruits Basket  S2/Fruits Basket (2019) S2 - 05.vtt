00:00:15.932 --> 00:00:20.353 position:50% align:center
[KURENO] It was late one night,
about a week and a half ago.

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:23.773 position:50% align:center
I stopped by the
convenience store.

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:27.652 position:50% align:center
And... you were there.

00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:29.070 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
Huh?

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:31.656 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
Oh, uh, excuse me.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.701 position:50% align:center
You've got a lotta
stuff. Be careful.

00:00:34.784 --> 00:00:36.870 position:50% align:center
Or maybe use a basket?

00:00:36.953 --> 00:00:38.621 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
A basket?

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:41.374 position:50% align:center
Right. Heh. I should've
thought of that.

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:44.294 position:50% align:center
I'll get one, thanks.

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:48.423 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. I'm sorry about that.

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:50.759 position:50% align:center
Ah! Oh, no, this
is such a disaster!

00:00:50.842 --> 00:00:51.843 position:50% align:center
I am such a klutz...

00:00:51.926 --> 00:00:54.387 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:55.722 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
Seriously?

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:58.725 position:50% align:center
Oh my gosh. You totally
just pulled a Tohru!

00:00:58.808 --> 00:01:00.810 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI laughs]

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:03.438 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
I didn't really understand.

00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:05.732 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, but that
was so great.

00:01:05.815 --> 00:01:07.317 position:50% align:center
You really oughta go and grab...

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.861 position:50% align:center
[KURENO] But when I
listened to you laugh,

00:01:09.944 --> 00:01:12.280 position:50% align:center
there was such joy in it.

00:01:12.364 --> 00:01:14.491 position:50% align:center
Such freedom.

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:17.744 position:50% align:center
It comforted me.

00:01:17.827 --> 00:01:22.165 position:50% align:center
And... I could've
listened to it forever.

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:55.383 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO] You don't have
to become an adult,

00:02:55.467 --> 00:02:57.802 position:50% align:center
but try to be somebody
who takes responsibility

00:02:57.886 --> 00:03:00.430 position:50% align:center
for their words
and their actions.

00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:04.225 position:50% align:center
Though, I guess that's
actually harder.

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:05.268 position:50% align:center
All right, kids.

00:03:05.352 --> 00:03:06.811 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS gasp]

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:09.689 position:50% align:center
That's the last lecture you'll
hear for a while. It's over.

00:03:09.773 --> 00:03:13.151 position:50% align:center
Try not to do anything
too crazy over the break.

00:03:17.155 --> 00:03:17.906 position:50% align:center
[door closes]

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:18.907 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS cheering]

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.825 position:50% align:center
Sweet freedom!
It's finally here!

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:23.244 position:50% align:center
Summer break, baby!

00:03:23.328 --> 00:03:26.206 position:50% align:center
This vacation is all about
makin' money and playin' hard!

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:28.083 position:50% align:center
Studying can go screw itself!

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:30.001 position:50% align:center
You seem excited
about the break.

00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:32.879 position:50% align:center
I could tear a car apart
with my bare hands right now.

00:03:32.962 --> 00:03:34.047 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.216 position:50% align:center
Or maybe not.

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.386 position:50% align:center
[HANAJIMA] Arisa, I understand
how thrilled you are,

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:40.720 position:50% align:center
but try to restrain yourself

00:03:40.804 --> 00:03:42.514 position:50% align:center
before you start
frightening people.

00:03:42.597 --> 00:03:45.975 position:50% align:center
Look at that. It's like
summer threw up on you.

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:48.144 position:50% align:center
Hey, there you are.

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:50.522 position:50% align:center
Remedial class dates are
posted in the hallway.

00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:54.317 position:50% align:center
Not necessary. I will not
be attending any this year.

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:56.820 position:50% align:center
I didn't receive a
single failing grade.

00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:58.738 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
You passed everything?

00:03:58.822 --> 00:04:00.615 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing you didn't
really like the idea

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:03.576 position:50% align:center
of being stuck in a classroom
without AC all summer long.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.037 position:50% align:center
Correct. Last year
was quite horrid.

00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:07.997 position:50% align:center
[YUSUKE, HIROSHI] That's what
kept you from failing?

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:10.041 position:50% align:center
But if it was that simple,

00:04:10.125 --> 00:04:12.544 position:50% align:center
then couldn't you just pass
your exams every time?

00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:16.214 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I mean, obviously you can
do it if you try hard enough.

00:04:16.297 --> 00:04:20.093 position:50% align:center
Yes, I contemplated that
same possibility myself.

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:24.472 position:50% align:center
However, I find that I have
no motivation. None.

00:04:24.556 --> 00:04:26.224 position:50% align:center
[YUSUKE, HIROSHI]
That explains it.

00:04:26.307 --> 00:04:27.517 position:50% align:center
Enough of that.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.810 position:50% align:center
We've been granted our freedom

00:04:28.893 --> 00:04:31.146 position:50% align:center
and we must take
advantage of it.

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.190 position:50% align:center
So, how shall we entertain
ourselves this afternoon?

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:37.235 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I'm working, so you'll
have to count me out.

00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:38.611 position:50% align:center
Oh, you picked up a shift?

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:41.489 position:50% align:center
First, the café, then later,
the convenience store.

00:04:41.573 --> 00:04:43.366 position:50% align:center
Gotta make that cash.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.743 position:50% align:center
I know what you mean.

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:46.828 position:50% align:center
I was gonna find an extra
job for the summer, too,

00:04:46.911 --> 00:04:48.621 position:50% align:center
but I never had time to look.

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:50.582 position:50% align:center
Are you completely insane?!

00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:52.417 position:50% align:center
You already do all the
cooking and cleaning

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.794 position:50% align:center
in a giant house full
of disgusting men!

00:04:54.878 --> 00:04:57.005 position:50% align:center
And now you wanna
take on another job?

00:04:57.088 --> 00:05:00.091 position:50% align:center
You'll work yourself
to death. I forbid it.

00:05:00.175 --> 00:05:01.426 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
No, but really.

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:03.928 position:50% align:center
They're the ones who've
been taking care of me.

00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:05.764 position:50% align:center
They could do better.

00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:07.807 position:50% align:center
Oh, and speaking of men,

00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:10.060 position:50% align:center
the other day, you mentioned
encountering one at work

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:12.270 position:50% align:center
who was similar
to our Tohru here.

00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:14.147 position:50% align:center
Which job did you meet him at?

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.358 position:50% align:center
Oh, that was at the store.

00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:17.817 position:50% align:center
And just so we're clear,

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:20.403 position:50% align:center
it's not like he's actually
all that similar to Tohru.

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:24.157 position:50% align:center
It was more that his clumsiness
reminded me of her a little.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.410 position:50% align:center
Oh, my. Is he very
scatterbrained, as well?

00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:29.996 position:50% align:center
Clumsy? And scatterbrained?

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.167 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI] Anyway, I haven't seen
the guy around since then.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.794 position:50% align:center
Too bad.

00:05:35.877 --> 00:05:40.131 position:50% align:center
If he did drop by, it wouldn't
be the worst thing ever.

00:05:42.258 --> 00:05:43.718 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Even though
it happens every year,

00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:46.680 position:50% align:center
I always get so excited
about the start of summer.

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:48.306 position:50% align:center
Kinda silly, isn't it?

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.433 position:50% align:center
You know, you're a real airhead.

00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:52.268 position:50% align:center
A moron like you
shouldn't be insulting

00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:53.853 position:50% align:center
other people's intelligence.

00:05:53.937 --> 00:05:55.063 position:50% align:center
Moron? Me?

00:05:55.146 --> 00:05:56.815 position:50% align:center
Where do you get off
callin' me that, huh?

00:05:56.898 --> 00:05:58.650 position:50% align:center
So, Miss Honda.

00:05:58.733 --> 00:06:00.610 position:50% align:center
Should we pick up some groceries
for dinner on the way home?

00:06:00.694 --> 00:06:02.362 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Don't ignore me!

00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:03.863 position:50% align:center
You can't just pick
a fight like that

00:06:03.947 --> 00:06:05.448 position:50% align:center
then run off, ya damn Rat!

00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:07.117 position:50% align:center
This kind of childish
overreaction

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.286 position:50% align:center
is exactly why I call you
a moron, dumb Cat.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.414 position:50% align:center
Um, what were we talking about?

00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:13.915 position:50% align:center
Oh, right.

00:06:13.998 --> 00:06:15.875 position:50% align:center
What do you guys think we
should have for dinner tonight?

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:18.044 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Ginger pork.

00:06:18.128 --> 00:06:22.215 position:50% align:center
Ginger pork... sounds perfect.

00:06:22.298 --> 00:06:24.676 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Oh! Hatsuharu.

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:26.469 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
What are you doing?

00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:27.887 position:50% align:center
Cooling off.

00:06:27.971 --> 00:06:30.515 position:50% align:center
Look, that makes sense and
all, but I gotta tell ya,

00:06:30.598 --> 00:06:32.892 position:50% align:center
standing around, spacing
out under the sprinklers

00:06:32.976 --> 00:06:34.310 position:50% align:center
looks pretty freakin' weird.

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:36.187 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Gotcha!

00:06:36.271 --> 00:06:37.397 position:50% align:center
Isn't this the best?

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.607 position:50% align:center
Gotta get soaked to
beat the summer heat.

00:06:39.691 --> 00:06:41.276 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI laughs]

00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:45.405 position:50% align:center
I'll beat you, you annoying
Rabbit! Don't splash me!

00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:47.866 position:50% align:center
Kyo! Please! Stop!

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:50.118 position:50% align:center
Ginger pork is light
and refreshing.

00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:52.746 position:50% align:center
Okay, ginger pork it is.

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:55.582 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Wait'll you see it.

00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:57.000 position:50% align:center
I found the perfect
way to celebrate

00:06:57.083 --> 00:06:58.585 position:50% align:center
our first day of break.

00:06:58.668 --> 00:07:00.086 position:50% align:center
It's up here!

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:01.796 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I'm a little confused.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.007 position:50% align:center
How are we gonna celebrate
in a department store?

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.842 position:50% align:center
Not telling till we get there!

00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:07.844 position:50% align:center
Hurry! It's going
to be <i>wunderbar</i> !

00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:10.096 position:50% align:center
[KYO] How 'bout we just
go home instead?

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.890 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU] Come on.
Where's your youthful zeal?

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:14.267 position:50% align:center
[KYO] I don't wanna hear
about "zeal" from you.

00:07:14.351 --> 00:07:16.353 position:50% align:center
Almost there. I'm so excited.

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:19.272 position:50% align:center
It sounds fun, and a
little different, too.

00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:22.108 position:50% align:center
A special kind of place
for a special kind of day!

00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:24.694 position:50% align:center
I like the idea of going
somewhere special.

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:26.863 position:50% align:center
I can't wait!

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:28.114 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Well, here it is!

00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:31.034 position:50% align:center
What do you think?
Pretty amazing, huh?

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:33.411 position:50% align:center
[YUKI, KYO]
This is a terrible idea.

00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:35.789 position:50% align:center
See! It's perfect!
Now, <i>auf ghets</i> !

00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:37.374 position:50% align:center
Hold on a second, brat.

00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:39.501 position:50% align:center
Before we go in,
maybe we should see

00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:42.212 position:50% align:center
how everybody feels
about haunted houses.

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:45.173 position:50% align:center
What do you think, Miss Honda?

00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:50.553 position:50% align:center
I think that's a no.

00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:53.765 position:50% align:center
You heard him. We're leaving.

00:07:53.848 --> 00:07:57.435 position:50% align:center
Tohru, you're scared?
We can't go in?

00:07:58.645 --> 00:08:00.480 position:50% align:center
No! I mean, yes, I'm scared.

00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:02.941 position:50% align:center
Because haunted houses are
scary, so of course I'm scared.

00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:05.819 position:50% align:center
But they say if you clear your
mind, even fire will feel cool.

00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:08.488 position:50% align:center
So I just have to stop thinking
and run into the fire!

00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:11.116 position:50% align:center
No. You really don't. At all.

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:14.911 position:50% align:center
I'll prove I can do this.
I can and I will!

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:17.414 position:50% align:center
Please allow me to enter
the haunted house!

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:25.714 position:50% align:center
[laughter, squeals]

There she goes.

Come on, this stuff's so fake
I'm surprised she's even scared.

What're you so afraid of?

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.145 position:50% align:center
I really don't know.

[MOMIJI laughing]

00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:46.234 position:50% align:center
Screaming or laughing the whole
time like some kind of lunatic?

00:08:46.317 --> 00:08:48.737 position:50% align:center
But, you know,
laughing at everything

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.156 position:50% align:center
might be a good way
to get through this.

00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:53.950 position:50% align:center
That's it! I'll use laughter
to fight the fear!

Why are you trying so hard?

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.329 position:50% align:center
[KYO] Just give up and
let's go home already!

[TOHRU laughing]

00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:08.006 position:50% align:center
That's so horrible.

00:09:08.089 --> 00:09:10.467 position:50% align:center
Not as horrible as
all your screaming.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.762 position:50% align:center
Fine. I have no choice.

00:09:13.845 --> 00:09:14.929 position:50% align:center
I'll walk with my eyes shut!

[YUKI]
Saw that coming.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.104 position:50% align:center
Miss Honda, I think you
should keep your eyes open.

00:09:23.188 --> 00:09:24.689 position:50% align:center
It's working, though.

00:09:24.773 --> 00:09:27.609 position:50% align:center
I don't feel as scared now that
I can't see anything. Really.

you enough on their own!

She can't keep doing this.

killed at this rate.

Hold my hand.

Me, imitate a moron like you?
Not a chance. I'd rather die.

Yeah, well, I can arrange that!

00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:05.021 position:50% align:center

You can hold my hand
if you want. Come on.

Ignoring poor Tohru while you
fight, that's just rude. Rude!

00:10:20.662 --> 00:10:23.331 position:50% align:center
Yes. I am. I'll make it.

00:10:23.415 --> 00:10:27.460 position:50% align:center
I may have an idea.
You could try making up stories.

00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:29.629 position:50% align:center

About these things.

00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:36.136 position:50% align:center
Like, this guy looks
pretty terrifying, right?

00:10:36.219 --> 00:10:38.430 position:50% align:center
But he's actually a kind
and considerate young man

00:10:38.513 --> 00:10:39.931 position:50% align:center
who loves animals and cooking.

00:10:40.015 --> 00:10:40.849 position:50% align:center

Huh?

[yells]

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:46.187 position:50% align:center
On Sundays, he does volunteer
work for his community.

00:10:46.271 --> 00:10:47.439 position:50% align:center
He's a real catch.

00:10:47.522 --> 00:10:50.567 position:50% align:center
All the ladies in town
want him for a husband.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.652 position:50% align:center
His one flaw is his soft heart.

00:10:52.736 --> 00:10:54.529 position:50% align:center
Wow, he sounds great.

00:10:54.612 --> 00:10:56.322 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I had no idea.

[yells]

00:10:57.699 --> 00:10:59.993 position:50% align:center
But, as many people do,

00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:03.455 position:50% align:center
he has a sorrowful past
that still pains him.

00:11:03.538 --> 00:11:05.290 position:50% align:center
When he was just ten years old,

00:11:05.373 --> 00:11:07.625 position:50% align:center
his mother disappeared
from his life.

00:11:07.709 --> 00:11:08.793 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:11:08.877 --> 00:11:10.628 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:14.799 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU] It was cold
outside and pouring rain.

00:11:14.883 --> 00:11:18.219 position:50% align:center
She gently covered him with
a hand-knitted sweater.

00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:21.806 position:50% align:center
Her soft hands. Her sweet voice.

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:26.102 position:50% align:center
The tears spilling
down her cheeks.

00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:28.063 position:50% align:center
That was what he remembered.

00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:31.191 position:50% align:center
The last memory he
had of his mother.

00:11:33.318 --> 00:11:36.404 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
The next morning, she was gone.

00:11:36.488 --> 00:11:39.491 position:50% align:center
The little boy was left
with his alcoholic father,

00:11:39.574 --> 00:11:44.371 position:50% align:center
an enormous amount of debt,
and that hand-knitted sweater.

00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:47.791 position:50% align:center
However, he believed in his
mother's tears that night,

00:11:47.874 --> 00:11:50.877 position:50% align:center
and would never bear
a grudge against her.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.253 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:11:52.337 --> 00:11:55.799 position:50% align:center
And so, he worked hard
and lived frugally

00:11:55.882 --> 00:11:59.678 position:50% align:center
until he was finally able
to repay his father's debt.

00:11:59.761 --> 00:12:02.180 position:50% align:center
At night, he would
embrace the sweater

00:12:02.263 --> 00:12:04.224 position:50% align:center
his mother had left behind

00:12:04.307 --> 00:12:06.518 position:50% align:center
and dream of the day
he would be able

00:12:06.601 --> 00:12:08.978 position:50% align:center
to see her face once again.

here to see him.

doing over here?

She wouldn't have abandoned the
young son she loved so deeply

if she hadn't been desperate,

00:12:21.616 --> 00:12:24.327 position:50% align:center
but in time, she came
to regret the decision

00:12:24.411 --> 00:12:26.413 position:50% align:center
she had made that night.

00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:30.041 position:50% align:center

in her own words why she left.

00:15:25.759 --> 00:15:29.346 position:50% align:center
I'm Arisa Uotani.
Nice to meet you.

00:15:29.429 --> 00:15:31.681 position:50% align:center
So, what're you
doin' around here?

00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:34.100 position:50% align:center
Do you work in the
area or somethin'?

00:15:34.184 --> 00:15:37.437 position:50% align:center
Actually, I was just
sorta wandering.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.481 position:50% align:center
No destination in mind.

00:15:39.564 --> 00:15:42.067 position:50% align:center
And here's your
chicken <i>nanban</i> , sir.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:43.526 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:46.988 position:50% align:center
It's been awhile since I've
taken a break from work.

00:15:47.072 --> 00:15:52.285 position:50% align:center
I didn't know what else to do,
so I figured I'd go for a walk.

00:15:53.745 --> 00:15:55.038 position:50% align:center
Are you working today?

00:15:55.121 --> 00:15:59.542 position:50% align:center
Oh, um, yeah, I am.
At my second job, at a café.

00:15:59.626 --> 00:16:03.505 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm 26, but I'd guess
that you're in high school?

00:16:03.588 --> 00:16:04.339 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
A junior.

00:16:04.422 --> 00:16:05.924 position:50% align:center
Yet so independent.

00:16:06.007 --> 00:16:08.259 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
Nah, it's nothing special.

00:16:08.343 --> 00:16:09.844 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
Nine years older than me.

00:16:09.928 --> 00:16:12.722 position:50% align:center
That's a pretty decent age gap.

00:16:12.806 --> 00:16:14.140 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:16:14.224 --> 00:16:15.934 position:50% align:center
I can't even find my way
around a convenience store,

00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:18.228 position:50% align:center
and you work two jobs.

00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:20.730 position:50% align:center
I'd never been in one
before that night.

00:16:20.814 --> 00:16:22.607 position:50% align:center
Heh. It's kind of pathetic, huh?

00:16:22.691 --> 00:16:26.403 position:50% align:center
Okay, what's your deal? You a
celebrity or some kinda royalty?

00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:27.946 position:50% align:center
Uh, no. I'm not.

00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:29.572 position:50% align:center
How have you made it 26 years

00:16:29.656 --> 00:16:31.741 position:50% align:center
without ever going to
a convenience store?

00:16:31.825 --> 00:16:34.285 position:50% align:center
That's impossible. Come on!

00:16:34.369 --> 00:16:37.622 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
I've never needed to.

00:16:37.706 --> 00:16:42.627 position:50% align:center
Going out to a store like that,
it was just a trivial errand,

00:16:42.711 --> 00:16:45.505 position:50% align:center
and I don't normally do those.

00:16:45.588 --> 00:16:50.343 position:50% align:center
I go about my life,
and I work. That's all.

00:16:50.427 --> 00:16:51.720 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
Trivial?

00:16:51.803 --> 00:16:53.054 position:50% align:center
[KURENO
I guess you could say

00:16:53.138 --> 00:16:55.098 position:50% align:center
I've got a pretty
structured existence.

00:16:55.181 --> 00:16:57.267 position:50% align:center
Which is why I was a little lost

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:59.769 position:50% align:center
when I found myself
with a day off.

00:17:00.895 --> 00:17:04.274 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI] And you're happy?
Living that way?

00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:06.276 position:50% align:center
Why wouldn't I be?

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:09.863 position:50% align:center
I have everything I need.
More than most.

00:17:09.946 --> 00:17:14.159 position:50% align:center
So, yes. I'm content.

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:21.291 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI] If that's true,
why is your smile so sad?

00:17:21.374 --> 00:17:25.378 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI] Both today,
and that first night we met,

00:17:25.462 --> 00:17:29.549 position:50% align:center
I've noticed how
hollow his smile is.

00:17:30.759 --> 00:17:33.345 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI] There's something
lonely about it.

00:17:34.929 --> 00:17:37.432 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
A trivial errand?

00:17:37.515 --> 00:17:39.559 position:50% align:center
That's all it was.

00:17:39.642 --> 00:17:42.562 position:50% align:center
And I guess that's all
this is, too, isn't it?

00:17:44.647 --> 00:17:49.235 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI] Ever since that night,
I've wanted to see you again.

00:17:49.319 --> 00:17:52.322 position:50% align:center
And then, when I ran
into you before,

00:17:52.405 --> 00:17:58.828 position:50% align:center
and you said we should get lunch
together, it... it just...

00:17:58.912 --> 00:18:02.332 position:50% align:center
It made me feel
really happy! Okay?!

00:18:02.415 --> 00:18:05.210 position:50% align:center
This isn't trivial to me!

00:18:05.293 --> 00:18:07.796 position:50% align:center
Thanks for lunch. See ya.

00:18:13.593 --> 00:18:15.345 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
Why am I so mad?

00:18:15.428 --> 00:18:18.223 position:50% align:center
I mean, he's just
some random guy.

00:18:18.306 --> 00:18:20.642 position:50% align:center
Sorry I wasted your time.

00:18:20.725 --> 00:18:23.061 position:50% align:center
Sorry you paid for my lunch.

00:18:23.144 --> 00:18:25.563 position:50% align:center
And I'm sorry I couldn't
make you smile

00:18:25.647 --> 00:18:28.483 position:50% align:center
like you really meant it.

00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:29.484 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
Hold on!

00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:30.944 position:50% align:center
Arisa! Just wait!

00:18:31.027 --> 00:18:33.613 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow, we're on a first
name basis already?

00:18:33.697 --> 00:18:35.073 position:50% align:center
Slow down, please.

00:18:35.156 --> 00:18:37.117 position:50% align:center
Stop following me
like some stalker.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.911 position:50% align:center
I am way to pissed off
to talk right now.

00:18:39.994 --> 00:18:41.830 position:50% align:center
I only need a minute.

00:18:41.913 --> 00:18:43.373 position:50% align:center
Please? Don't cry.

00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:45.000 position:50% align:center
I am not crying!

00:18:45.083 --> 00:18:48.294 position:50% align:center
[KURENO] I'm sorry. I swear
I didn't mean it that way.

00:18:48.378 --> 00:18:52.549 position:50% align:center
I was happy, too. Before.

00:18:52.632 --> 00:18:55.468 position:50% align:center
When I realized who you were.

00:18:55.552 --> 00:19:01.057 position:50% align:center
You chased after me in this heat
just for a chance to talk.

00:19:02.142 --> 00:19:05.145 position:50% align:center
Ever since that night...

00:19:05.228 --> 00:19:08.440 position:50% align:center
...I've been thinking about you.

00:19:08.523 --> 00:19:10.817 position:50% align:center
Wanting to see you again.

00:19:12.444 --> 00:19:13.862 position:50% align:center
Oh. You have?

00:19:13.945 --> 00:19:15.363 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI laughs]

00:19:15.447 --> 00:19:16.031 position:50% align:center
You're blushing.

00:19:16.114 --> 00:19:17.115 position:50% align:center
No, I'm not!

00:19:17.198 --> 00:19:18.658 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:22.162 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
Liar.

00:19:22.245 --> 00:19:24.164 position:50% align:center
[KURENO laughs]

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:30.003 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
That's... a real smile.

00:19:53.234 --> 00:19:55.737 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
That look...

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.739 position:50% align:center
And that touch...

00:19:57.822 --> 00:20:00.408 position:50% align:center
He felt something, too.

00:20:03.912 --> 00:20:05.538 position:50% align:center
[MEGUMI]
So how do you feel?

00:20:05.622 --> 00:20:07.957 position:50% align:center
Is he somebody you could
see yourself with?

00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:09.668 position:50% align:center
I have no idea.

00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:11.836 position:50% align:center
He's all mysterious
and confusing.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.797 position:50% align:center
Nothing he does makes any sense.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.883 position:50% align:center
I mean, why did he just
take off? That jerk.

00:20:16.966 --> 00:20:20.720 position:50% align:center
What, did I have <i>tororo</i>
breath or something?

00:20:20.804 --> 00:20:23.807 position:50% align:center
Could it be that...
he's married?

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:24.974 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
Oh, man.

00:20:25.058 --> 00:20:27.894 position:50% align:center
Whole thing was bull
if that's the case.

00:20:27.977 --> 00:20:29.396 position:50% align:center
Well, whatever.

00:20:29.479 --> 00:20:32.941 position:50% align:center
I probably won't talk to him
again unless he comes to me.

00:20:33.024 --> 00:20:35.443 position:50% align:center
Guess we'll see what happens.

00:20:35.527 --> 00:20:37.320 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:37.404 --> 00:20:39.864 position:50% align:center
Are you lonely?

00:20:39.948 --> 00:20:41.574 position:50% align:center
I'll be all right.

00:20:41.658 --> 00:20:43.159 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
Hanajima.

00:20:43.243 --> 00:20:44.911 position:50% align:center
If Tohru ever gets a boyfriend,

00:20:44.994 --> 00:20:47.372 position:50% align:center
we're totally crashing
their first date.

00:20:47.455 --> 00:20:50.583 position:50% align:center
One hundred percent.

00:20:50.667 --> 00:20:52.919 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Ginger pork. Yay.

00:20:53.003 --> 00:20:54.254 position:50% align:center
Leave already.

00:20:54.337 --> 00:20:55.880 position:50% align:center
I'm next, right?

00:20:55.964 --> 00:20:57.257 position:50% align:center
Meat! Yum!

00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:58.925 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] We should have
enough for seconds, too.

00:20:59.009 --> 00:21:01.636 position:50% align:center
So, what'd you do for
your first afternoon off?

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.304 position:50% align:center
We went to a haunted house!

00:21:03.388 --> 00:21:06.224 position:50% align:center
But, Tohru, weren't you scared?

00:21:06.307 --> 00:21:07.517 position:50% align:center
It was very moving.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:08.977 position:50% align:center
It really was!

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:11.688 position:50% align:center
Moving? A haunted house?

00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:14.524 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
More like exhausting.

00:21:14.607 --> 00:21:17.610 position:50% align:center
I know! I'm tearing up
just thinking about it.

00:21:17.694 --> 00:21:21.990 position:50% align:center
Wow. It must've been quite
an unusual haunted house.

00:21:22.073 --> 00:21:26.077 position:50% align:center
Anyway, it sounds like the break
is off to a promising start.

00:21:26.161 --> 00:21:29.372 position:50% align:center
Yes! And I'm sure it's
only going to get better!

00:21:29.456 --> 00:21:33.126 position:50% align:center
I've never been more excited
about summer vacation before!

00:21:36.713 --> 00:21:43.636 position:50% align:center
[KURENO] If I could...
I'd stay by your side forever.

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.930 position:50% align:center
To hear your laugh.

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:50.643 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
To see your smile.

00:21:50.727 --> 00:21:52.979 position:50% align:center
To taste your lips.

00:21:59.944 --> 00:22:03.198 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Welcome home, Kureno.

00:22:03.281 --> 00:22:07.118 position:50% align:center
You didn't get into any trouble
while you were out, did you?

00:22:11.539 --> 00:22:14.668 position:50% align:center
Of course not, Akito.

00:22:17.879 --> 00:22:23.176 position:50% align:center
[KURENO] But... I doubt
I'll ever see you again.

00:23:57.312 --> 00:24:00.523 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] "Then are you
really this stupid?"
