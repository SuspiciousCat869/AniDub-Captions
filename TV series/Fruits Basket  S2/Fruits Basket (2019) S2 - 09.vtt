00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:14.055 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Kyo!

00:00:15.056 --> 00:00:17.183 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
My name.

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:22.564 position:50% align:center
It sounds special somehow...
if you're the one saying it.

00:00:22.647 --> 00:00:25.400 position:50% align:center
When did that happen?

00:00:25.483 --> 00:00:28.278 position:50% align:center
This is just so much fun!

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:30.363 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
If something'll make you smile,

00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:33.575 position:50% align:center
I'd be willing to do it
over and over again.

00:00:33.658 --> 00:00:37.579 position:50% align:center
When did I start thinking
stupid, sappy things like that?

00:00:37.662 --> 00:00:40.373 position:50% align:center
And why?

00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:44.586 position:50% align:center
It's almost like... I'm...

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:17.804 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I met Isuzu,

00:02:17.887 --> 00:02:20.807 position:50% align:center
the Soma who's possessed
by the Horse spirit.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.893 position:50% align:center
And I realized there's
only one left.

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:28.273 position:50% align:center
Which means,
the Rooster must be...

00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:30.150 position:50% align:center
Tohru, how are
things going here?

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:31.526 position:50% align:center
They're great.

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:33.945 position:50% align:center
But, um, I thought you were
out at the annex today.

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:36.614 position:50% align:center
I was, but I forgot something.

00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:37.699 position:50% align:center
Kyo, you're up.

00:02:37.782 --> 00:02:39.200 position:50% align:center
What?

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:41.870 position:50% align:center
Akito has requested the dubious
pleasure of your presence.

00:02:41.953 --> 00:02:43.413 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry,

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:45.874 position:50% align:center
but I'm afraid I'll have to
steal him for a little while.

00:02:45.957 --> 00:02:46.708 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:46.791 --> 00:02:47.625 position:50% align:center
[TOHRY, KYO]
Huh?!

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.253 position:50% align:center
Wow, did you two
coordinate that?

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:51.546 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:52.672 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Hey. Hold on.

00:02:52.756 --> 00:02:53.798 position:50% align:center
If I go, then she'll be--

00:02:53.882 --> 00:02:55.258 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I can't believe it!

00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:57.010 position:50% align:center
You've been invited, too!

00:02:57.093 --> 00:03:01.139 position:50% align:center
This is so wonderful!
Right, Kyo?

00:03:01.222 --> 00:03:03.600 position:50% align:center
I'm really happy for you.

00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:09.606 position:50% align:center
I won't be too long.
Stay outta trouble.

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.442 position:50% align:center
Right! I'll see you
in a little bit.

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:13.777 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Heh.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.364 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
See? She's happy.

00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:19.491 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm not. At all.

00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:22.118 position:50% align:center
You know it's a trap,
too, so shut up.

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:23.828 position:50% align:center
Ooh, so scary.

00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:27.332 position:50% align:center
Are you ever nice to
anyone besides Tohru?

00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:36.841 position:50% align:center
What's going on? Why is he here?

00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:38.426 position:50% align:center
Akito summoned him?

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.303 position:50% align:center
Astute as ever.

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:42.597 position:50% align:center
Go on, Kyo. Akito is waiting.

00:03:42.681 --> 00:03:45.016 position:50% align:center
There's no sense in
dragging your feet.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.978 position:50% align:center
It's the same thing that
happened before, on New Year's.

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:54.609 position:50% align:center
Don't you see? With us here,
she's alone again.

00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:55.819 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:57.278 position:50% align:center
Wanna tell me what you
guys were thinking?!

00:03:57.362 --> 00:03:58.613 position:50% align:center
You're all here,

00:03:58.697 --> 00:04:01.491 position:50% align:center
and she's back at the
vacation house by herself!

00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:04.994 position:50% align:center
Do I really need to point
out that you're here, too?

00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:09.708 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] You can't defy Akito's
orders any more than we can.

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:13.086 position:50% align:center
So don't pretend like
you're the noble one.

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:15.505 position:50% align:center
I'll warn you again.

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:18.717 position:50% align:center
Watch yourself. Don't lash
out like an idiot.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.303 position:50% align:center
Right. Screw you! You bastard!

00:04:34.232 --> 00:04:35.692 position:50% align:center
You should've gone a
round or two with him

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:37.110 position:50% align:center
like you usually do.

00:04:37.193 --> 00:04:39.195 position:50% align:center
Let him blow off some steam.

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:41.114 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I've had enough.

00:04:41.197 --> 00:04:46.202 position:50% align:center
He needs to know his place.
So do I, for that matter.

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:50.457 position:50% align:center
This is just who we are.
It's time to accept that.

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:55.879 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Welcome, Kyo.

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:59.674 position:50% align:center
It's been a while since
we've spoken face-to-face.

00:05:01.426 --> 00:05:03.303 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
What's wrong?

00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:05.180 position:50% align:center
Why so shy?

00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:09.142 position:50% align:center
You can come in,
my pitiful monster.

00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:12.187 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
He should be there by now.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.939 position:50% align:center
I wonder what they're all doing
and if Kyo's having fun.

00:05:15.023 --> 00:05:16.566 position:50% align:center
I hope so.

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:19.861 position:50% align:center
Maybe everybody will sit down
for a banquet together.

00:05:19.944 --> 00:05:22.947 position:50% align:center
I won't be long.
Stay outta trouble.

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.035 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I'm so happy for him,

00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:30.663 position:50% align:center
and I hope he comes back at
least a little happy, too.

00:05:32.082 --> 00:05:34.125 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
I've been wondering.

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:37.545 position:50% align:center
How are things going
with that wager we made?

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:41.341 position:50% align:center
Go on, admit it.
You can't beat him.

00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:43.218 position:50% align:center
And you never will.

00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:45.553 position:50% align:center
It's impossible.

00:05:45.637 --> 00:05:49.265 position:50% align:center
You should know by now--
you were made to be inferior.

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:53.978 position:50% align:center
The Cat was never meant
to defeat the Rat.

00:05:54.062 --> 00:05:56.523 position:50% align:center
And you will never defeat Yuki.

00:05:56.606 --> 00:06:00.026 position:50% align:center
That's how it's always been.
How it always will be.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.695 position:50% align:center
Accept it.

00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:03.154 position:50% align:center
Those who are born with a spirit

00:06:03.238 --> 00:06:05.740 position:50% align:center
are tied to that
spirit's destiny,

00:06:05.824 --> 00:06:08.118 position:50% align:center
as I've told you before.

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:10.787 position:50% align:center
This is the fate
of your lineage.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.749 position:50% align:center
Kyo. You can't escape it.

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:17.419 position:50% align:center
[KYO] No! I want nothing
to do with that fate!

00:06:17.502 --> 00:06:18.503 position:50% align:center
Do you hear me?

00:06:18.586 --> 00:06:20.380 position:50% align:center
I'll prove that you're wrong.

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:22.465 position:50% align:center
I'll prove that I'm
better than him.

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:24.092 position:50% align:center
I'll beat Yuki.

00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:25.885 position:50% align:center
Then you'll see!

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:29.681 position:50% align:center
Okay. Fine. Let's make a bet.

00:06:29.764 --> 00:06:32.017 position:50% align:center
Before you graduate
from high school,

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.269 position:50% align:center
prove you can defeat Yuki.

00:06:34.352 --> 00:06:36.980 position:50% align:center
Win and I'll stop
calling you a monster.

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:40.358 position:50% align:center
I'll even welcome you
as a zodiac member.

00:06:40.442 --> 00:06:44.404 position:50% align:center
But if you can't beat him...

00:06:44.487 --> 00:06:47.198 position:50% align:center
...then I'll lock you up
until the day you die.

00:06:47.282 --> 00:06:49.200 position:50% align:center
[KYO gapss]

00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:51.536 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
If you can't beat him,

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:54.330 position:50% align:center
you really are just
a piece of filth.

00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:57.417 position:50% align:center
As I've always known you to be.

00:06:59.753 --> 00:07:04.883 position:50% align:center
[AKITO] Anyway, looks like I'm
going to win our little bet.

00:07:04.966 --> 00:07:07.594 position:50% align:center
[KYO] What? You can't
just assume that!

00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:09.721 position:50% align:center
I still have plenty
of time left.

00:07:09.804 --> 00:07:11.723 position:50% align:center
You don't know anything!

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:18.063 position:50% align:center
I know exactly what's coming,
Kyo. And so should you.

00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:19.314 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:21.483 --> 00:07:24.152 position:50% align:center
How can you still
not understand?

00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:27.906 position:50% align:center
Or have you forgotten?
Is that it?

00:07:27.989 --> 00:07:31.868 position:50% align:center
You've deluded yourself so long,
you can't remember the truth.

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:35.663 position:50% align:center
Let's fix that, shall we?

00:07:35.747 --> 00:07:38.458 position:50% align:center
Remember, you're a monster, Kyo.

00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:40.251 position:50% align:center
A freak.

00:07:40.335 --> 00:07:45.006 position:50% align:center
And because of your twisted
nature, your mother is dead.

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:46.883 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
You're wrong.

00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:48.218 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
I'm not.

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:50.762 position:50% align:center
Stop. It wasn't... my fault.

00:07:50.845 --> 00:07:53.098 position:50% align:center
It most certainly was.

00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:54.849 position:50% align:center
You killed your own mother.

00:07:54.933 --> 00:07:57.602 position:50% align:center
Stop it. Let go! Don't touch me!

00:07:57.686 --> 00:08:01.106 position:50% align:center
I don't take orders from you.

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:03.900 position:50% align:center
Your poor, unfortunate mother.

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:07.529 position:50% align:center
She gave birth to a
monster in human skin.

00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:10.865 position:50% align:center
And she tried to raise it,
to protect it.

00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:14.828 position:50% align:center
But in the end, she just
couldn't bear the pain.

00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:20.875 position:50% align:center
And now, her son won't
even mourn her death.

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:24.838 position:50% align:center
[KYO'S FATHER] Kyo, do you
understand what your mom did?

00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:26.589 position:50% align:center
It wasn't an accident.

00:08:26.673 --> 00:08:30.260 position:50% align:center
She's dead because
she took her own life.

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:34.014 position:50% align:center
Do you realize how much
grief you've caused her?

00:08:34.097 --> 00:08:36.141 position:50% align:center
Do you know what you've done?

00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:40.061 position:50% align:center
Or are you too much of a
monster to see the truth?

00:08:40.145 --> 00:08:41.938 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:08:42.022 --> 00:08:45.859 position:50% align:center
[AKITO] Honestly? The one who
should've died was you.

00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:50.238 position:50% align:center
Think how much happier everyone
would've been if you had.

00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:52.991 position:50% align:center
Especially your mother.

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:56.953 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
I killed her.

00:08:57.037 --> 00:08:58.413 position:50% align:center
I--

00:08:59.914 --> 00:09:02.417 position:50% align:center
No, please stop!

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.670 position:50% align:center
Please just stop. Please.

00:09:05.754 --> 00:09:07.464 position:50% align:center
I can't.

00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:12.344 position:50% align:center
Now then, there's something
I've been thinking about.

00:09:12.427 --> 00:09:14.512 position:50% align:center
Tohru Honda appears
to be encouraging

00:09:14.596 --> 00:09:16.139 position:50% align:center
these delusions of yours.

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:19.851 position:50% align:center
So, maybe, this is
all her fault.

00:09:19.934 --> 00:09:23.855 position:50% align:center
Nothing seems to scare her off,
not even seeing your true form.

00:09:23.938 --> 00:09:26.149 position:50% align:center
You know? But how?

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:28.318 position:50% align:center
An impressive girl, isn't she?

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:31.863 position:50% align:center
She's practically
a saint. Or an angel.

00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:35.367 position:50% align:center
Or it could be...
she's a monster.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:36.743 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:39.704 position:50% align:center
[AKITO] Come on, she's just
a little too perfect,

00:09:39.788 --> 00:09:43.249 position:50% align:center
and that kind of
perfection seems wrong.

00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:46.419 position:50% align:center
In fact, one might even
say it's monstrous.

00:09:46.503 --> 00:09:48.088 position:50% align:center
Tohru Honda.

00:09:48.171 --> 00:09:52.342 position:50% align:center
Most people would run screaming
after seeing you in that form,

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:55.762 position:50% align:center
but she didn't even flinch.

00:09:55.845 --> 00:09:58.807 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
No. You're wrong.

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:01.393 position:50% align:center
How can you even say that?

00:10:02.977 --> 00:10:05.105 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
You don't know what happened.

00:10:05.188 --> 00:10:08.733 position:50% align:center
You couldn't. Because you
weren't there to see it.

00:10:08.817 --> 00:10:11.444 position:50% align:center
So I don't care
what you've heard.

00:10:11.528 --> 00:10:15.156 position:50% align:center
Nothing about her is
monstrous. Nothing.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:21.413 position:50% align:center
You... You don't know how
scared she was that night.

00:10:22.914 --> 00:10:26.793 position:50% align:center
So don't try and
tell me she wasn't!

00:10:26.876 --> 00:10:30.630 position:50% align:center
Her hands were shaking.
Her voice was trembling.

00:10:30.714 --> 00:10:37.637 position:50% align:center
Her skin was cold to the touch,
and her face pale with fear.

00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:39.014 position:50% align:center
Even so,

00:10:39.097 --> 00:10:41.891 position:50% align:center
she stood her ground and
refused to run away from me!

00:10:41.975 --> 00:10:43.226 position:50% align:center
Stop talking.

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:44.352 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
That's right!

00:10:44.436 --> 00:10:46.438 position:50% align:center
She was terrified,
but she didn't run.

00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:49.315 position:50% align:center
She stayed! She held
onto me the whole time!

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:50.734 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:52.193 --> 00:10:56.448 position:50% align:center
[KYO] She must have known
that if she let go...

00:10:56.531 --> 00:10:58.908 position:50% align:center
...I would never return.

00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:02.370 position:50% align:center
If I slipped through
her hands, I'd be gone.

00:11:02.454 --> 00:11:05.623 position:50% align:center
And no one would be
able to bring me back.

00:11:07.417 --> 00:11:10.003 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
She didn't erase all my pain

00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:13.089 position:50% align:center
or offer to solve
all my problems.

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:16.885 position:50% align:center
She didn't fix everything
that was broken.

00:11:16.968 --> 00:11:21.389 position:50% align:center
But that's not what I needed,
anyway. Not really.

00:11:21.473 --> 00:11:26.853 position:50% align:center
What mattered most
was that... she stayed.

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:34.486 position:50% align:center
[KYO] The littlest
things make her happy.

00:11:34.569 --> 00:11:36.780 position:50% align:center
She's always smiling.

00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:40.075 position:50% align:center
Always finding something
to laugh about.

00:11:40.158 --> 00:11:42.327 position:50% align:center
She's selfless.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:48.208 position:50% align:center
Constantly giving more than she
gets in return, never realizing.

00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:51.920 position:50% align:center
She deserves so much
more than what she has.

00:11:52.003 --> 00:11:55.632 position:50% align:center
She thinks she's
stupid, a burden,

00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:57.801 position:50% align:center
that there's nothing
good about her.

00:11:57.884 --> 00:11:59.511 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI] It's a waste
of time to think about

00:11:59.594 --> 00:12:01.221 position:50% align:center
what you might lose in life.

00:12:01.304 --> 00:12:04.349 position:50% align:center
And so the traveler paid
no mind to such things.

00:12:04.432 --> 00:12:07.268 position:50% align:center
My classmates might think
that makes her an idiot,

00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:08.436 position:50% align:center
but I don't agree.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.855 position:50% align:center
I think she's kind.

00:12:10.939 --> 00:12:14.901 position:50% align:center
So, Yuki, Kyo,
what do you think?

00:12:14.984 --> 00:12:17.112 position:50% align:center
What does your heart tell you?

00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:19.531 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Kyo!

00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:24.536 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Kyo!

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.208 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
I love you.

00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:34.462 position:50% align:center
I love you... so much.

00:12:34.546 --> 00:12:36.589 position:50% align:center
Just as you are.

00:12:38.842 --> 00:12:41.678 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Are you crying?

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:43.346 position:50% align:center
You are.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:45.640 position:50% align:center
What's the matter, Kyo?

00:12:45.724 --> 00:12:47.559 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me.

00:12:47.642 --> 00:12:49.019 position:50% align:center
Could it be...

00:12:49.102 --> 00:12:53.815 position:50% align:center
...that you're in love
with Tohru Honda?

00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:56.443 position:50% align:center
Ha! Oh, that is too hilarious!

00:12:56.526 --> 00:13:00.739 position:50% align:center
A monster fell in love
with another monster.

00:13:00.822 --> 00:13:04.200 position:50% align:center
Stop it. Why are you
looking at me like that?

00:13:04.284 --> 00:13:07.871 position:50% align:center
None of this is my fault!
You're the deluded one!

00:13:07.954 --> 00:13:10.915 position:50% align:center
That girl did this,
the ugly, insolent outsider!

00:13:10.999 --> 00:13:12.292 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Hold on!

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:15.003 position:50% align:center
If you hate her so much,
why let her live with us?

00:13:15.086 --> 00:13:18.048 position:50% align:center
Why would you allow her to
stay in our lives at all?

00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:20.258 position:50% align:center
You're crazy. It doesn't
make any sense.

00:13:20.342 --> 00:13:21.176 position:50% align:center
What are y--?

00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:22.594 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:26.181 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
It was some plan of yours.

00:13:26.264 --> 00:13:28.058 position:50% align:center
You used her.

00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:32.270 position:50% align:center
Why? I don't know. But--

00:13:32.354 --> 00:13:35.357 position:50% align:center
You dragged her into this mess.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.442 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
How very typical.

00:13:37.525 --> 00:13:40.612 position:50% align:center
You're always so quick to make
me the villain, aren't you?

00:13:40.695 --> 00:13:44.032 position:50% align:center
Now, answer me. Do you
love that girl? Well?

00:13:44.115 --> 00:13:44.949 position:50% align:center
--Why do you--?
--[AKITO] If you do,

00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:46.743 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
then you're an idiot!

00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:48.912 position:50% align:center
What right do you have to
fall in love with anyone

00:13:48.995 --> 00:13:50.914 position:50% align:center
after you killed
your own mother?

00:13:50.997 --> 00:13:52.165 position:50% align:center
You're a monster.

00:13:52.248 --> 00:13:55.543 position:50% align:center
An abomination guilty
of an unforgivable sin.

00:13:55.627 --> 00:13:57.754 position:50% align:center
[KYOKO]
I won't forgive you.

00:13:57.837 --> 00:14:01.132 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Kyo. Come on.

00:14:01.216 --> 00:14:05.804 position:50% align:center
Think about it. Who's
the real villain here?

00:14:05.887 --> 00:14:10.475 position:50% align:center
Who really dragged
her into this?

00:14:10.558 --> 00:14:11.726 position:50% align:center
Who?

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:13.311 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:16.815 --> 00:14:18.066 position:50% align:center
It was me.

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:19.609 position:50% align:center
It's all your fault.

00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:21.069 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
That's right.

00:14:21.152 --> 00:14:22.821 position:50% align:center
Though the girl's to blame, too.

00:14:22.904 --> 00:14:24.531 position:50% align:center
She's not!

00:14:24.614 --> 00:14:27.158 position:50% align:center
It was me! All me!

00:14:27.242 --> 00:14:30.078 position:50% align:center
I don't love her.

00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:34.040 position:50% align:center
No. You had it wrong.

00:14:34.124 --> 00:14:36.167 position:50% align:center
Of course I don't love her.

00:14:36.251 --> 00:14:39.671 position:50% align:center
Because I'm never going
to fall in love.

00:14:39.754 --> 00:14:42.799 position:50% align:center
Not with anybody.

00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:44.300 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Enough.

00:14:44.384 --> 00:14:47.804 position:50% align:center
I won't let anyone talk bad
about her because of me.

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:50.932 position:50% align:center
Not anymore.

00:14:51.016 --> 00:14:53.226 position:50% align:center
Is that so?

00:14:53.309 --> 00:14:58.314 position:50% align:center
Well, all right then. I suppose
I was jumping to conclusions.

00:14:58.398 --> 00:15:00.650 position:50% align:center
That's exactly right.

00:15:00.734 --> 00:15:03.194 position:50% align:center
There's no way you
could love her.

00:15:03.278 --> 00:15:06.573 position:50% align:center
Nice to see you being
sensible for once.

00:15:06.656 --> 00:15:08.742 position:50% align:center
You're never going to
defeat Yuki anyway,

00:15:08.825 --> 00:15:12.078 position:50% align:center
so your confinement is certain.

00:15:12.162 --> 00:15:17.625 position:50% align:center
Now cheer up. Surely you
can see it's for the best.

00:15:17.709 --> 00:15:19.627 position:50% align:center
It would be a shame
to involve the girl

00:15:19.711 --> 00:15:21.338 position:50% align:center
more than you already have.

00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:24.758 position:50% align:center
Or Kazuma, or anyone else
in your wretched life.

00:15:24.841 --> 00:15:28.595 position:50% align:center
Everyone will be better off
if you simply disappear.

00:15:28.678 --> 00:15:30.055 position:50% align:center
And don't worry.

00:15:30.138 --> 00:15:33.641 position:50% align:center
You may be locked away,
but I'll still come to visit.

00:15:33.725 --> 00:15:36.686 position:50% align:center
I'll keep looking out for you
like I always have.

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:40.023 position:50% align:center
You won't feel lonely
with me there.

00:15:40.106 --> 00:15:44.986 position:50% align:center
[KYO] Yeah, right. I know
you're just mocking me.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:46.946 position:50% align:center
But I'm not.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:51.910 position:50% align:center
I love you so very much, Kyo.
Can't you see that?

00:15:53.453 --> 00:15:57.290 position:50% align:center
Now, try hard to be the good
boy that I know you can be.

00:15:57.374 --> 00:16:00.418 position:50% align:center
Behave yourself for the
little time you have left

00:16:00.502 --> 00:16:02.921 position:50% align:center
living on the outside.

00:16:06.633 --> 00:16:09.511 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Akito, is Kyo still here?

00:16:09.594 --> 00:16:11.888 position:50% align:center
I sent him back.

00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:16.101 position:50% align:center
I shouldn't have touched him
so much. I feel disgusting.

00:16:16.184 --> 00:16:19.646 position:50% align:center
Oh, by the way, during our chat,

00:16:19.729 --> 00:16:23.024 position:50% align:center
Kyo told me he
hates Tohru Honda.

00:16:23.108 --> 00:16:25.360 position:50% align:center
Do you think that's true?

00:16:27.946 --> 00:16:29.489 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Probably.

00:16:47.632 --> 00:16:51.928 position:50% align:center
Of course he doesn't.
That's not hate.

00:16:52.012 --> 00:16:54.055 position:50% align:center
[AKITO] What right do you have
to fall in love with anyone

00:16:54.139 --> 00:16:56.141 position:50% align:center
after you killed
your own mother?

00:16:56.224 --> 00:16:58.476 position:50% align:center
You're a monster.

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.770 position:50% align:center
Who really dragged
her into this?

00:17:00.854 --> 00:17:02.188 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
I know.

00:17:02.272 --> 00:17:04.190 position:50% align:center
[AKITO] Everyone will be better
off if you disappear.

00:17:04.274 --> 00:17:06.901 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know!

00:17:06.985 --> 00:17:09.112 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
You think I don't see it?

00:17:09.195 --> 00:17:13.867 position:50% align:center
That I don't realize how
many people I've hurt?

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:17.454 position:50% align:center
Why didn't she kill me
instead of herself?

00:17:17.537 --> 00:17:21.499 position:50% align:center
She would've been doing
the world a favor.

00:17:21.583 --> 00:17:24.502 position:50% align:center
So, why am I still alive?

00:17:24.586 --> 00:17:27.047 position:50% align:center
Why am I still breathing...

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:31.634 position:50% align:center
...in a world I don't
deserve to be a part of.

00:17:35.638 --> 00:17:36.931 position:50% align:center
Tohru?

00:17:43.188 --> 00:17:47.442 position:50% align:center
[KYO] And even now,
I still look for her.

00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:49.486 position:50% align:center
Wait, Kyo.

00:17:49.569 --> 00:17:50.612 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:50.695 --> 00:17:53.406 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Watch where you step.

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:56.451 position:50% align:center
No need to trample
the poor thing.

00:17:56.534 --> 00:17:58.370 position:50% align:center
What's it matter?

00:17:58.453 --> 00:18:02.624 position:50% align:center
You're not gonna change anything
by protecting one little plant.

00:18:02.707 --> 00:18:04.918 position:50% align:center
There's no point
when we live in a world

00:18:05.001 --> 00:18:08.338 position:50% align:center
where one person's life can
be sacrificed for another's.

00:18:08.421 --> 00:18:11.549 position:50% align:center
Where somebody can have
everything taken from them

00:18:11.633 --> 00:18:14.678 position:50% align:center
and be trampled
like this flower!

00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:16.638 position:50% align:center
I know it's hard.

00:18:16.721 --> 00:18:18.181 position:50% align:center
And I know you're angry,

00:18:18.264 --> 00:18:21.976 position:50% align:center
but I don't think you've
given up hope yet.

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:25.063 position:50% align:center
Not every soul in this world
has rejected you, Kyo,

00:18:25.146 --> 00:18:28.024 position:50% align:center
and some small part of
you must realize that.

00:18:28.108 --> 00:18:30.735 position:50% align:center
And so you keep fighting.

00:18:30.819 --> 00:18:32.445 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
That's stupid.

00:18:32.529 --> 00:18:34.948 position:50% align:center
I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:18:35.031 --> 00:18:37.283 position:50% align:center
I don't have any hope. None.

00:18:37.367 --> 00:18:38.034 position:50% align:center
Yes, you do.

00:18:38.118 --> 00:18:40.954 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
I don't!

00:18:41.037 --> 00:18:42.288 position:50% align:center
I don't.

00:18:42.372 --> 00:18:44.499 position:50% align:center
[KAZUMA]
Maybe not.

00:18:44.582 --> 00:18:48.003 position:50% align:center
Maybe now all looks dark,
but hope will come again.

00:18:48.086 --> 00:18:49.963 position:50% align:center
It will find you.

00:18:50.046 --> 00:18:53.633 position:50% align:center
However much you resist it,
or even trample it,

00:18:53.717 --> 00:18:57.512 position:50% align:center
however many times you're
thrown into despair,

00:18:57.595 --> 00:19:00.140 position:50% align:center
hope will always return
to give you strength

00:19:00.223 --> 00:19:02.892 position:50% align:center
when you need it most.

00:19:02.976 --> 00:19:06.312 position:50% align:center
You may struggle
and you may doubt...

00:19:06.396 --> 00:19:08.606 position:50% align:center
...but hope will bloom.

00:19:10.984 --> 00:19:13.028 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
I'm sorry, Master.

00:19:13.111 --> 00:19:17.365 position:50% align:center
I pretended not to understand,
but I actually did.

00:19:17.449 --> 00:19:21.619 position:50% align:center
I have all along, deep down.

00:19:21.703 --> 00:19:24.039 position:50% align:center
Plenty of people will reject me,

00:19:24.122 --> 00:19:27.959 position:50% align:center
but just as many will
reach out a hand.

00:19:28.043 --> 00:19:30.587 position:50% align:center
You lonely, kid?

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:32.839 position:50% align:center
[KYO] Even though she'll
never come back...

00:19:32.922 --> 00:19:37.677 position:50% align:center
All right. C'mere, squirt.
Make a man's promise.

00:19:37.761 --> 00:19:39.429 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
I couldn't keep it.

00:19:39.512 --> 00:19:42.057 position:50% align:center
This girl is my treasure.

00:19:43.058 --> 00:19:47.520 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
But she bloomed in front of me.

00:19:47.604 --> 00:19:49.689 position:50% align:center
[KYOKO] I've tried,
but I can't help but feel

00:19:49.773 --> 00:19:52.067 position:50% align:center
like I could've done
more for her.

00:19:53.068 --> 00:19:59.449 position:50% align:center
[KYO] She continued to bloom.
A bright spot in the darkness.

00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:00.867 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:06.206 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
A tiny... flower.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.379 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Precious. So precious.

00:20:12.462 --> 00:20:14.673 position:50% align:center
My... My...

00:20:14.756 --> 00:20:16.675 position:50% align:center
Tohru!

00:20:16.758 --> 00:20:19.219 position:50% align:center
Hold on. You're back?

00:20:19.302 --> 00:20:21.721 position:50% align:center
But why? I figured you
would be gone longer.

00:20:21.805 --> 00:20:24.182 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. Did something go wrong?

00:20:24.265 --> 00:20:26.726 position:50% align:center
Your cheek. Aww.

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:29.813 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that. It's fine.
Just a little fight.

00:20:29.896 --> 00:20:31.147 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
A what?!

00:20:31.231 --> 00:20:33.316 position:50% align:center
Wait, does that mean you
got in a fight with Akito?

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.984 position:50% align:center
I guess I won't be
going back there.

00:20:35.068 --> 00:20:36.653 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU yelps]

00:20:36.736 --> 00:20:38.238 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Don't worry about it.

00:20:38.321 --> 00:20:41.449 position:50% align:center
I mean, I feel kinda bad
'cause you were happy for me,

00:20:41.533 --> 00:20:44.452 position:50% align:center
but I don't care
if I'm not invited.

00:20:44.536 --> 00:20:50.083 position:50% align:center
Nope. In fact, I've never
cared less. Ya know?

00:20:50.166 --> 00:20:51.501 position:50% align:center
Wait, hold on.

00:20:51.584 --> 00:20:53.878 position:50% align:center
Were you secretly hoping
that I wouldn't come back?

00:20:53.962 --> 00:20:55.880 position:50% align:center
Of course I wasn't!
Why would you even think that?!

00:20:55.964 --> 00:20:57.257 position:50% align:center
I was just worried
because, well--

00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:59.718 position:50% align:center
It was a joke. Calm down.

00:20:59.801 --> 00:21:01.970 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Welcome back.

00:21:02.053 --> 00:21:05.640 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you're
here, Kyo. Really.

00:21:06.641 --> 00:21:09.477 position:50% align:center
Yeah. So am I.

00:21:11.229 --> 00:21:12.981 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
I love you.

00:21:13.064 --> 00:21:15.859 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna take
anything else from you.

00:21:15.942 --> 00:21:19.571 position:50% align:center
Or trample the hope
you offer me.

00:21:19.654 --> 00:21:24.284 position:50% align:center
I'd dreamed we'd find a way
to be together forever.

00:21:24.367 --> 00:21:26.119 position:50% align:center
Somewhere far from here.

00:21:26.202 --> 00:21:29.456 position:50% align:center
[KYOKO]
I won't forgive you.

00:21:29.539 --> 00:21:31.458 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
But not anymore.

00:21:31.541 --> 00:21:33.543 position:50% align:center
[AKITO] It would be a shame
to involve the girl

00:21:33.626 --> 00:21:36.463 position:50% align:center
more than you already have.

00:21:36.546 --> 00:21:37.797 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
No.

00:21:37.881 --> 00:21:40.675 position:50% align:center
I'll stop hoping that I can
make you mine someday,

00:21:40.759 --> 00:21:43.386 position:50% align:center
because I know I can't.

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:49.601 position:50% align:center
But please, at least stay by my
side for the time I have left.

00:21:49.684 --> 00:21:52.187 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Oh! Are you hungry, Kyo?

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:54.606 position:50% align:center
I can get started on dinner
if you tell me what you want.

00:21:54.689 --> 00:21:57.400 position:50% align:center
Uh... Fish, maybe?

00:21:57.484 --> 00:22:01.654 position:50% align:center
You got it! Time to roll up
my sleeves and-- Ah!

00:22:01.738 --> 00:22:04.282 position:50% align:center
Seriously, worry less
about your sleeves

00:22:04.366 --> 00:22:06.368 position:50% align:center
and more about what
your feet are doing.

00:22:06.451 --> 00:22:09.245 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Okay. Good idea.

00:22:09.329 --> 00:22:10.914 position:50% align:center
Come on.

00:22:10.997 --> 00:22:13.416 position:50% align:center
You're hopeless, you know that?

00:22:14.918 --> 00:22:18.421 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
I want to be with you.

00:22:18.505 --> 00:22:22.384 position:50% align:center
Until we're separated for good.

00:22:22.467 --> 00:22:25.095 position:50% align:center
Until the very last moment.

00:23:57.604 --> 00:23:59.939 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
"Who are you?"
