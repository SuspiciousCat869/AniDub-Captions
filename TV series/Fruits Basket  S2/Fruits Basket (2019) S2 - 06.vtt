00:00:14.222 --> 00:00:16.850 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
This is a pretty bad storm.

00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:19.853 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. It's only
getting worse, too.

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:23.440 position:50% align:center
And you know, on days
like today... they appear.

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:25.650 position:50% align:center
Huh? "They" who?

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:29.529 position:50% align:center
During the summer, they're
very common around this area.

00:00:29.612 --> 00:00:31.031 position:50% align:center
Very.

00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:32.198 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:34.659 position:50% align:center
Um. Wait. What?
You're scaring me.

00:00:34.743 --> 00:00:36.494 position:50% align:center
Wh-Who's common?

00:00:36.578 --> 00:00:38.288 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
<i>Hallo</i> , everyone!

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:42.542 position:50% align:center
You ready? 'Cause tomorrow,
we're getting outta here!

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:15.260 position:50% align:center
That... was terrifying.

00:02:15.343 --> 00:02:17.512 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
So, where are we going?

00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:18.680 position:50% align:center
We all agreed we were gonna

00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:21.141 position:50% align:center
hang out together this
summer, remember?

00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:25.520 position:50% align:center
So... I reserved one of the
Soma vacation houses for us.

00:02:25.603 --> 00:02:28.773 position:50% align:center
Our ultimate summer getaway
officially begins tomorrow!

00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:32.485 position:50% align:center
What? Hold on!
A getaway? Vacation house?

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.030 position:50% align:center
Well, at least it's not a
haunted house this time.

00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:39.784 position:50% align:center
A fancy getaway, huh?
With attendants, perhaps?

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:42.287 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I don't want to know
what he's picturing.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.415 position:50% align:center
Tohru, you're taking some
time off work, right?

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:47.959 position:50% align:center
You have to come.
This is our big chance!

00:02:48.043 --> 00:02:50.587 position:50% align:center
Oh, um, do you think I'd
be welcome there, though?

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.172 position:50% align:center
<i>Ja!</i> I invited...

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:56.051 position:50% align:center
...Haru, Harry, Aya, Ritchan,
Kisa, Hiro, and Kagura, too,

00:02:56.134 --> 00:02:57.469 position:50% align:center
so the more the merrier!

00:02:57.552 --> 00:03:01.222 position:50% align:center
Could we uninvite someone?
Specifically, my brother.

00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:05.060 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] I don't wanna spend my
vacation with that idiotic girl.

00:03:05.143 --> 00:03:06.478 position:50% align:center
And this stupid rabbit emoji;

00:03:06.561 --> 00:03:08.063 position:50% align:center
you would never know that
he's in high school.

00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:11.483 position:50% align:center
Hiro- <i>chan</i> , let's go, okay?

00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:13.485 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:03:13.568 --> 00:03:16.279 position:50% align:center
So? You're going to come
with us, aren't you?

00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:18.073 position:50% align:center
Um, maybe.

00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:20.825 position:50% align:center
If you want to go,
then you should go, Tohru.

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:23.536 position:50% align:center
There's no need to be shy.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.538 position:50% align:center
Okay! I would love to go!

00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:26.915 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:29.626 position:50% align:center
Stag beetles and
Hercules beetles, too!

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:30.877 position:50% align:center
We've gotta catch 'em all.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.920 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:03:32.003 --> 00:03:33.463 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
And we'll set off fireworks!

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:34.714 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Yes!

00:03:34.798 --> 00:03:38.051 position:50% align:center
Well, it does sound like
fun. Perhaps I'll go.

00:03:38.134 --> 00:03:41.012 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah! You should
totally come.

00:03:41.096 --> 00:03:42.764 position:50% align:center
You don't have work to do?

00:03:42.847 --> 00:03:43.932 position:50% align:center
Nah.

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:45.266 position:50% align:center
Please stop smiling.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.769 position:50% align:center
It's both unconvincing and
unpleasant to look at.

00:03:47.852 --> 00:03:49.813 position:50% align:center
My obligations aside, though,

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:52.524 position:50% align:center
weren't you all assigned
homework over the break?

00:03:52.607 --> 00:03:55.360 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about me.
I'm mostly finished.

00:03:55.443 --> 00:03:59.072 position:50% align:center
Same here! I got an early start.

00:03:59.155 --> 00:04:00.532 position:50% align:center
--[YUKI] Uh.
--[SHIGURE] Hm?

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:08.248 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I'm really sorry about this.

00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:11.209 position:50% align:center
I always seem to screw up
and make more work for you.

00:04:11.292 --> 00:04:13.336 position:50% align:center
Don't be so hard on
yourself. It's fine.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.797 position:50% align:center
Just keep on trying!
You can do it!

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.215 position:50% align:center
You're right!

00:04:17.298 --> 00:04:19.718 position:50% align:center
This summer getaway should
be plenty to motivate me.

00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:21.344 position:50% align:center
Do it for the beetles!

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:23.304 position:50% align:center
And for the fireworks!

00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:24.806 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Or we could just delay the thing

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:26.891 position:50% align:center
instead of going tomorrow.

00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:29.477 position:50% align:center
Hey. Hold on. Where's Kyo?

00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:31.896 position:50% align:center
He's been up in his room
for a while, resting.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.234 position:50% align:center
Then I'm off! He needs to
know about our big plans.

00:04:36.317 --> 00:04:37.694 position:50% align:center
Good luck, Tohru!

00:04:37.777 --> 00:04:40.071 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Thank you!

00:04:40.155 --> 00:04:44.451 position:50% align:center
All right, time to really focus
and get this homework done.

00:04:45.493 --> 00:04:47.245 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Kyo!

00:04:47.328 --> 00:04:49.998 position:50% align:center
Hey, what's up? You sick?

00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:52.000 position:50% align:center
Just tired, that's all.

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:55.170 position:50% align:center
I definitely don't have enough
energy to talk to you.

00:04:55.253 --> 00:04:56.546 position:50% align:center
Okay, Rabbit?

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:58.673 position:50% align:center
I get it.

00:04:58.757 --> 00:04:59.883 position:50% align:center
Hey! Get packed!

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:01.801 position:50% align:center
We're going to the
beach house tomorrow!

00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:04.220 position:50% align:center
You don't get it at all!

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:07.515 position:50% align:center
Wait, the beach? Tomorrow?

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:09.684 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Mh-hm!

00:05:09.768 --> 00:05:11.019 position:50% align:center
That's for the short notice.

00:05:11.102 --> 00:05:12.062 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI cries]

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:14.230 position:50% align:center
Kyo, you big meanie!

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:17.150 position:50% align:center
I know you're tired, but you'll
still come, won't you?

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:20.570 position:50% align:center
You won't miss out on our
big summer trip, right?

00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:22.447 position:50% align:center
Stop bugging me, will ya?

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.908 position:50% align:center
Tohru will be really sad
if you don't come.

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:27.869 position:50% align:center
We've got big plans.
Swimming and fireworks.

00:05:27.952 --> 00:05:29.913 position:50% align:center
I said to stop bugging me.

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:33.416 position:50% align:center
That means I want ya to leave,
not that I won't go.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.836 position:50% align:center
Now scram. I'm tired
and I need to pack.

00:05:38.922 --> 00:05:40.548 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI] You're nicer
than you used to be.

00:05:40.632 --> 00:05:41.466 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:43.176 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Oh, nothing!

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:45.845 position:50% align:center
It'll be fun.
Know the best part?

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:48.014 position:50% align:center
I'm going to catch
some stag beetles!

00:05:48.098 --> 00:05:52.185 position:50% align:center
You know, you're a
really weird kid.

00:05:52.268 --> 00:05:54.479 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Oh, I get it.

00:05:54.562 --> 00:05:56.940 position:50% align:center
I think I finally
understand what to do.

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:57.941 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Okay, good.

00:05:58.024 --> 00:06:00.402 position:50% align:center
You should be able
to finish now.

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:02.612 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Thank you so much.

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:05.573 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
That hat.

00:06:05.657 --> 00:06:06.783 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:10.537 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I was...
just wondering, is it yours?

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.498 position:50% align:center
Uh. You mean the one up there?

00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:15.083 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Yeah.

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:20.213 position:50% align:center
I mean, it kinda looks out of
place. Not really your style.

00:06:20.296 --> 00:06:21.506 position:50% align:center
No, it isn't mine.

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:23.550 position:50% align:center
I got lost once back when
I was a little girl,

00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:26.052 position:50% align:center
and this hat belonged to
the boy who helped me.

00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:29.264 position:50% align:center
I've held onto it
ever since that day.

00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:32.434 position:50% align:center
I don't remember who he was
or where he came from.

00:06:32.517 --> 00:06:35.687 position:50% align:center
I don't even remember
what he looked like.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.273 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Why did you keep it?

00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:41.776 position:50% align:center
It's so old. Beat up.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.279 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Because it's a precious memory.

00:06:44.362 --> 00:06:47.657 position:50% align:center
I was frightened and
alone, then he came.

00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:50.493 position:50% align:center
He saved me.

00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:51.953 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
That day...

00:06:52.037 --> 00:06:54.497 position:50% align:center
Even if you've forgotten...

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.293 position:50% align:center
Miss Hon--

00:06:58.376 --> 00:06:59.878 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Good news! Kyo's coming, too!

00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:01.212 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad!

00:07:01.296 --> 00:07:02.339 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Stag beetles!

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:03.423 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Fireworks!

00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:06.968 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Vacation house, here we come!

00:07:07.052 --> 00:07:09.596 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Because it's a precious memory.

00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:14.517 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Bye-bye, storm!

00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:16.019 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
So you're not coming?

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:18.313 position:50% align:center
You seemed pretty excited
about it yesterday.

00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:20.357 position:50% align:center
Well, I have some
work to do after all,

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.150 position:50% align:center
but I'll be along
once it's done.

00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:25.362 position:50% align:center
Now, Yuki, Kyo, listen here.

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:26.696 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.531 position:50% align:center
I won't be there to supervise,

00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:31.117 position:50% align:center
so you two have to protect
our sweet Tohru.

00:07:31.201 --> 00:07:33.536 position:50% align:center
That'll be a lot easier
to do without you around!

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.330 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It will.

00:07:35.413 --> 00:07:37.540 position:50% align:center
Okay. We'll see
you later, then.

00:07:37.624 --> 00:07:40.794 position:50% align:center
Bye. You kids be careful.

00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:47.592 position:50% align:center
You can come out now.

00:07:58.186 --> 00:08:01.147 position:50% align:center
It's been a while, Rin.

00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:03.566 position:50% align:center
Well, come in.

00:08:05.443 --> 00:08:06.653 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Uh.

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:10.699 position:50% align:center
Now, now. Your shoes.

00:08:10.782 --> 00:08:12.659 position:50% align:center
You should take
them off, you know.

00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:14.577 position:50% align:center
You know why I'm here.

00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:18.456 position:50% align:center
There's no point
pretending that you don't.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.042 position:50% align:center
You know what I'm thinking.

00:08:21.126 --> 00:08:23.461 position:50% align:center
What I want.

00:08:23.545 --> 00:08:26.548 position:50% align:center
Save us both time and admit it.

00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:30.301 position:50% align:center
Do I? I wonder.

00:08:30.385 --> 00:08:33.013 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure I can meet
your expectations.

00:08:33.096 --> 00:08:34.931 position:50% align:center
You can.

00:08:36.433 --> 00:08:39.352 position:50% align:center
Gure, please. Tell me.

00:08:39.436 --> 00:08:41.187 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
And why would I do that?

00:08:41.271 --> 00:08:44.441 position:50% align:center
Do I seem like such
a simple man?

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:45.608 position:50% align:center
You don't.

00:08:45.692 --> 00:08:47.360 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Heh.

00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:51.114 position:50% align:center
Then are you really this stupid?

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:54.826 position:50% align:center
Or is playing the fool
all part of your grand plan?

00:08:58.663 --> 00:09:03.168 position:50% align:center
Ah, Rin. What shall
I do with you?

00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:09.090 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Summer!

00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:13.303 position:50% align:center
The sky, the ocean.
Everything's so blue!

00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:14.888 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Tohru!

00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:16.014 position:50% align:center
--The water's calling your name!
--[KISA] Let's go swim, 'kay?

00:09:16.097 --> 00:09:16.890 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:18.433 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU, MOMIJI, KISA laughing]

00:09:18.516 --> 00:09:20.143 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
They're excited.

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:21.603 position:50% align:center
You not gonna get in, Kyo?

00:09:21.686 --> 00:09:23.313 position:50% align:center
What's it look like?

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:24.856 position:50% align:center
[KISA]
Hey, Tohru.

00:09:24.939 --> 00:09:26.900 position:50% align:center
Isn't this shell pretty?

00:09:26.983 --> 00:09:30.862 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] The airhead's already
monopolizing Kisa's time!

00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:34.449 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU] Strange. I was
so sure Sensei would come.

00:09:34.532 --> 00:09:36.368 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Huh? What made you so sure?

00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:37.535 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Honda.

00:09:37.619 --> 00:09:39.162 position:50% align:center
She's out here in
a tight swimsuit.

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:40.955 position:50% align:center
That's basically
like catnip to him.

00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:43.249 position:50% align:center
[KYO, YUKI]
Don't talk about her like that!

00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:45.669 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU] I'm just talking
like a normal teenager.

00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:48.880 position:50% align:center
What do you know about being
a normal teenager, ya freak?

00:09:48.963 --> 00:09:50.340 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Hiro!

00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:52.509 position:50% align:center
Don't you want to
come swim, too?

00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:55.762 position:50% align:center
Ha! Unlike some other people,
I have self-control.

00:09:55.845 --> 00:09:57.180 position:50% align:center
Silly child.

00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:58.181 position:50% align:center
Grouchy.

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:00.141 position:50% align:center
Grouchy-grouch!
Grouchy-grouch!

00:10:00.225 --> 00:10:01.476 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
You shut up!

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:03.478 position:50% align:center
It was a long trip here
and I'm feeling fatigued.

00:10:03.561 --> 00:10:05.438 position:50% align:center
[splashing]

00:10:05.522 --> 00:10:07.482 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Oh, wow, look!

00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:11.361 position:50% align:center
Tohru's amazing!
She's such a good swimmer!

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:12.237 position:50% align:center
Whoa.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.407 position:50% align:center
Impressive. She's really fast.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:16.866 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU] Can't say I ever
really thought of her

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:20.245 position:50% align:center
as the athletic type.

00:10:20.328 --> 00:10:22.497 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:23.915 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU] She didn't
breathe that whole time?

00:10:23.998 --> 00:10:25.500 position:50% align:center
[YUKI grunts]

00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:27.460 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Idiot.

00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:28.920 position:50% align:center
Learn how to breathe
while you swim

00:10:29.004 --> 00:10:32.215 position:50% align:center
or you're gonna pass out and
drown one of these days.

00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:34.676 position:50% align:center
But, Kyo, you were
watching, weren't you?

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:36.845 position:50% align:center
I told you I could totally swim!

00:10:36.928 --> 00:10:39.556 position:50% align:center
Looked more like you
were trying not to die.

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:42.350 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, when did
Kyo get over there?

00:10:42.434 --> 00:10:44.269 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] I'll do it again!
Faster this time!

00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:47.772 position:50% align:center
What did I just tell you?
Stick to sandcastles!

00:10:47.856 --> 00:10:49.274 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:50.775 position:50% align:center
Hey, Momiji!

00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:53.987 position:50% align:center
Come teach her how to breathe
while she's swimming!

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.905 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU chuckles]

00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:56.990 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:10:57.073 --> 00:10:59.743 position:50% align:center
Jeez, what's up with
the giggle-fest?

00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:02.620 position:50% align:center
This is just so much fun!

00:11:02.704 --> 00:11:06.249 position:50% align:center
Oops, sorry, Kyo. I know how
you feel about the water.

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:07.500 position:50% align:center
Go on.

00:11:07.584 --> 00:11:10.337 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU yelping]

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:11.963 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
She's having a good time.

00:11:12.047 --> 00:11:13.006 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Look at Kyo.

00:11:13.089 --> 00:11:16.301 position:50% align:center
He went into the
water, after all.

00:11:16.384 --> 00:11:18.803 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
You're deluding yourself.

00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:21.931 position:50% align:center
Listen, this world is dark.

00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:24.351 position:50% align:center
You'll spend your life
along a pitch-black path

00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:28.104 position:50% align:center
with no hope and
no chance of salvation.

00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:31.524 position:50% align:center
Don't ever allow yourself
to think otherwise.

00:11:31.608 --> 00:11:33.985 position:50% align:center
You will never be saved.

00:11:35.987 --> 00:11:37.280 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:11:37.364 --> 00:11:40.742 position:50% align:center
It looks like something
has got your head spinning.

00:11:40.825 --> 00:11:43.620 position:50% align:center
Is it the heat or
your own emotions?

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.290 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Yuki!

00:11:47.374 --> 00:11:49.584 position:50% align:center
Don't you guys want
to come join us?

00:11:49.668 --> 00:11:51.044 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Uh, sure.

00:11:51.127 --> 00:11:52.545 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Bring Hiro, too!

00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:55.298 position:50% align:center
Shut up, you puny Rabbit!

00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:57.467 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I'm fine.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:01.763 position:50% align:center
Lost in thought, I guess.
It's a bad habit.

00:12:01.846 --> 00:12:03.723 position:50% align:center
I have to snap
out of it, though,

00:12:03.807 --> 00:12:06.393 position:50% align:center
or Miss Honda will start
to worry about me.

00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:08.520 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
That's the spirit.

00:12:08.603 --> 00:12:10.772 position:50% align:center
I'm trying.

00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:12.816 position:50% align:center
What? You back already?

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:15.777 position:50% align:center
I wasn't planning to swim
in the first place.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.278 position:50% align:center
We're gonna race. Let's go.

00:12:17.362 --> 00:12:20.031 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna race!
Stop! You tryin' to kill me?

00:12:20.115 --> 00:12:21.991 position:50% align:center
The water's pretty cold, huh?

00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:24.119 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
You'll get used to it!

00:12:24.202 --> 00:12:26.913 position:50% align:center
I like your swimsuit.
It looks cute.

00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:28.248 position:50% align:center
Oh. Thanks.

00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:30.250 position:50% align:center
I mean, that's really
nice of you to say.

00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:31.668 position:50% align:center
I-I can't take
the credit, though,

00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:34.170 position:50% align:center
since you guys
picked it out for me.

00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:36.631 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Yuki.

00:12:36.715 --> 00:12:38.550 position:50% align:center
We're racing. You want in?

00:12:38.633 --> 00:12:40.218 position:50% align:center
I bet that oughta
get Kyo going.

00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:44.848 position:50% align:center
No, it won't! Like I give
a crap what he does.

00:12:44.931 --> 00:12:46.307 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Sure, I'm in.

00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:50.103 position:50% align:center
All right, bring it on!

00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:52.188 position:50% align:center
Rat! You're goin' down!

00:12:52.272 --> 00:12:53.481 position:50% align:center
Nicely played.

00:12:53.565 --> 00:12:54.774 position:50% align:center
I feel used.

00:12:54.858 --> 00:12:56.860 position:50% align:center
You guys, we still
have a lot to do,

00:12:56.943 --> 00:12:58.611 position:50% align:center
so try not to wear
yourselves out.

00:12:58.695 --> 00:13:02.907 position:50% align:center
Just swim for fun like normal
people. <i>Dumme kinder.</i>

00:13:02.991 --> 00:13:07.996 position:50% align:center
[ALL laugh]

00:13:10.165 --> 00:13:11.916 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
That was amazing, Yuki!

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.835 position:50% align:center
A first place finish!

00:13:13.918 --> 00:13:16.004 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Hm? Where's the Cat?

00:13:16.087 --> 00:13:19.466 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU] He didn't like
losing, so he headed back early.

00:13:19.549 --> 00:13:20.967 position:50% align:center
To sulk in private.

00:13:21.051 --> 00:13:22.385 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI laughs]

00:13:22.469 --> 00:13:25.055 position:50% align:center
You and I get to be roommates
while we're here, Kisa.

00:13:25.138 --> 00:13:27.807 position:50% align:center
[KISA]
Yeah!

00:13:27.891 --> 00:13:29.225 position:50% align:center
What's that?

00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:32.395 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Looks like the same
pocketbook I took before.

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:35.106 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Hey, idiot.

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:36.107 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:13:36.191 --> 00:13:38.818 position:50% align:center
Here. It's yours, right?

00:13:40.445 --> 00:13:41.613 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU yells]

00:13:41.696 --> 00:13:44.199 position:50% align:center
Oh, no! Mom, what are you
doing over there?

00:13:44.282 --> 00:13:46.242 position:50% align:center
Be more careful. You dropped it.

00:13:46.326 --> 00:13:48.745 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Thank you so much
for picking it up!

00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:50.747 position:50% align:center
That was a close one.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:52.082 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
So what's the deal?

00:13:52.165 --> 00:13:54.751 position:50% align:center
Why do you only carry
a photo of your mom?

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:56.086 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Huh?

00:13:56.169 --> 00:13:58.421 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Shouldn't you have
one of your dad, too?

00:13:58.505 --> 00:14:00.799 position:50% align:center
Seriously, it's always her.

00:14:00.882 --> 00:14:02.258 position:50% align:center
Mom this, and Mom that.

00:14:02.342 --> 00:14:04.135 position:50% align:center
But you had another parent.

00:14:04.219 --> 00:14:06.054 position:50% align:center
She's all you ever
talk about, though.

00:14:06.137 --> 00:14:08.264 position:50% align:center
Sounds like you've got
some real issues.

00:14:08.348 --> 00:14:11.267 position:50% align:center
I mean, is that all
there is to you?

00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:13.353 position:50% align:center
No, it's not.

00:14:13.436 --> 00:14:15.480 position:50% align:center
[KISA]
Huh?

00:14:15.563 --> 00:14:19.401 position:50% align:center
I just... Well...

00:14:21.111 --> 00:14:22.070 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU chuckles]

00:14:22.153 --> 00:14:23.071 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:23.154 --> 00:14:25.240 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Hey! You coming?

00:14:25.323 --> 00:14:30.203 position:50% align:center
Oh. Yeah! Just give us
a second to catch up.

00:14:30.286 --> 00:14:32.997 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
What's her problem?

00:14:33.081 --> 00:14:33.915 position:50% align:center
[KISA]
Hiro- <i>chan</i> .

00:14:33.998 --> 00:14:35.625 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:35.709 --> 00:14:38.461 position:50% align:center
You said some pretty
mean things to her.

00:14:38.545 --> 00:14:40.422 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
What? Just now?

00:14:40.505 --> 00:14:42.966 position:50% align:center
It wasn't a big
deal or anything.

00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:45.301 position:50% align:center
Didn't seem like it
bothered her at all.

00:14:45.385 --> 00:14:47.053 position:50% align:center
[KISA]
You think you could tell?

00:14:47.137 --> 00:14:48.638 position:50% align:center
If it had bothered her?

00:14:48.722 --> 00:14:50.265 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:50.348 --> 00:14:53.643 position:50% align:center
[KISA] How could you?
You don't know her.

00:14:53.727 --> 00:14:55.395 position:50% align:center
What's in her heart.

00:14:55.478 --> 00:14:59.649 position:50% align:center
What feelings she keeps
buried deep inside.

00:14:59.733 --> 00:15:02.318 position:50% align:center
It might not seem like
a big deal to you,

00:15:02.402 --> 00:15:04.612 position:50% align:center
but you don't know for sure.

00:15:04.696 --> 00:15:07.282 position:50% align:center
And you shouldn't
act like you do.

00:15:07.365 --> 00:15:09.409 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Yeah, you're right,
I don't know.

00:15:09.492 --> 00:15:11.161 position:50% align:center
And I don't really care, either.

00:15:11.244 --> 00:15:15.540 position:50% align:center
[KISA] Hiro- <i>chan</i> , why did
you even agree to come?

00:15:15.623 --> 00:15:19.127 position:50% align:center
Are you only here to make
things harder on Tohru?

00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:26.259 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Why? Why do I always do this?

00:15:26.343 --> 00:15:27.719 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU gasps]

00:15:27.802 --> 00:15:29.512 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
I came for you.

00:15:29.596 --> 00:15:32.223 position:50% align:center
Because I thought it
would make you happy.

00:15:32.307 --> 00:15:34.309 position:50% align:center
It's nothing.

00:15:36.353 --> 00:15:38.313 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
This is my fault.

00:15:38.396 --> 00:15:40.982 position:50% align:center
I still take things out
on other people.

00:15:41.066 --> 00:15:43.234 position:50% align:center
Like a little kid.

00:15:44.736 --> 00:15:47.072 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
I should know better by now.

00:15:47.155 --> 00:15:51.451 position:50% align:center
There are feelings I keep
hidden deep inside.

00:15:51.534 --> 00:15:53.745 position:50% align:center
So, of course...

00:15:53.828 --> 00:15:57.791 position:50% align:center
Of course... she must
have them, too.

00:16:00.001 --> 00:16:04.798 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Things buried in her
heart that no one else can feel.

00:16:07.425 --> 00:16:09.844 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Are Kisa and Hiro fighting?

00:16:09.928 --> 00:16:12.514 position:50% align:center
They didn't say very
much during dinner.

00:16:12.597 --> 00:16:13.848 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Hmm...

00:16:13.932 --> 00:16:15.934 position:50% align:center
Well, no good can come
from putting yourself

00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:17.936 position:50% align:center
in the middle of
a lovers' quarrel.

00:16:18.019 --> 00:16:19.688 position:50% align:center
Best to stay out of it.

00:16:19.771 --> 00:16:23.233 position:50% align:center
Are you being considerate
or just indifferent?

00:16:28.613 --> 00:16:29.280 position:50% align:center
[squeals]

00:16:29.364 --> 00:16:30.657 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Uh.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:34.119 position:50% align:center
Huh? Kisa? You okay?
I didn't know you were there.

00:16:34.202 --> 00:16:36.663 position:50% align:center
I'm really sorry! Uh...

00:16:36.746 --> 00:16:39.457 position:50% align:center
[KISA]
It's okay. So am I.

00:16:39.541 --> 00:16:40.834 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:40.917 --> 00:16:43.962 position:50% align:center
[KISA]
Earlier, I was upset,

00:16:44.045 --> 00:16:48.675 position:50% align:center
and I guess some of the stuff
I said was pretty mean, too.

00:16:48.758 --> 00:16:52.846 position:50% align:center
So... I'm sorry.

00:16:55.432 --> 00:17:01.604 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Me, too. I'm sorry,
too. About before.

00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:03.314 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.954 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] Why do you only carry
a photo of your mom?

00:17:22.208 --> 00:17:23.877 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Because...

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:31.676 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
It's okay.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.470 position:50% align:center
It's okay.

00:17:36.598 --> 00:17:38.808 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
It's okay.

00:17:38.892 --> 00:17:41.227 position:50% align:center
It's okay.

00:17:41.311 --> 00:17:45.732 position:50% align:center
We'll always be... together.

00:17:48.985 --> 00:17:50.070 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Hiro!

00:17:50.153 --> 00:17:52.072 position:50% align:center
Hey, look, we found
stag beetles!

00:17:52.155 --> 00:17:53.865 position:50% align:center
They're really cool looking!

00:17:53.948 --> 00:17:56.201 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I know! Aren't they?

00:17:56.284 --> 00:17:57.786 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
She seems even more cheerful

00:17:57.869 --> 00:17:59.496 position:50% align:center
than usual this morning.

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:01.039 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Here, check it out!

00:18:01.122 --> 00:18:04.709 position:50% align:center
Up close. Catching these was
one of our goals for the trip.

00:18:04.793 --> 00:18:06.252 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Uhh...

00:18:06.336 --> 00:18:07.295 position:50% align:center
Congratulations?

00:18:07.379 --> 00:18:09.089 position:50% align:center
Heh. Thank you!

00:18:09.172 --> 00:18:10.465 position:50% align:center
What's that on the tree?

00:18:10.548 --> 00:18:14.010 position:50% align:center
Some sugar water. It's a
trick that Kyo taught me.

00:18:14.094 --> 00:18:14.969 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Hmm.

00:18:15.053 --> 00:18:18.348 position:50% align:center
Uh. Hey, Kyo! <i>Guten Morgen!</i>

00:18:18.431 --> 00:18:20.141 position:50% align:center
You're out here pretty early.

00:18:20.225 --> 00:18:23.311 position:50% align:center
I'm not the only one.
So how is the bug hunt going?

00:18:23.395 --> 00:18:25.897 position:50% align:center
We haven't found
any Hercules beetles.

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.273 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
I'm not surprised.

00:18:27.357 --> 00:18:29.275 position:50% align:center
But look, a stag beetle!

00:18:29.359 --> 00:18:31.861 position:50% align:center
[KYO] Dummy. That's
a rhinoceros beetle.

00:18:31.945 --> 00:18:33.905 position:50% align:center
What? Are you sure?

00:18:33.988 --> 00:18:37.492 position:50% align:center
Uh, Momiji, can I see the
encyclopedia real quick?

00:18:37.575 --> 00:18:39.077 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Sure!

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:39.911 position:50% align:center
[HIRO grunts]

00:18:39.994 --> 00:18:42.414 position:50% align:center
Ow. Jeez. What was that for?

00:18:42.497 --> 00:18:45.834 position:50% align:center
What's up? Did you do something
to upset Tohru again?

00:18:45.917 --> 00:18:46.835 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:46.918 --> 00:18:48.003 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:18:48.086 --> 00:18:49.671 position:50% align:center
Do you have any
evidence to suggest

00:18:49.754 --> 00:18:51.923 position:50% align:center
I might be responsible
for such a thing?

00:18:52.007 --> 00:18:53.508 position:50% align:center
I don't know what
happened exactly,

00:18:53.591 --> 00:18:56.720 position:50% align:center
but she just seems
sorta... down.

00:18:58.513 --> 00:19:01.182 position:50% align:center
Hey, you were right.
This is a rhinoceros beetle.

00:19:01.266 --> 00:19:02.600 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Told ya.

00:19:05.478 --> 00:19:06.563 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
I'm heading out to join them

00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:08.481 position:50% align:center
at the vacation house tomorrow,

00:19:08.565 --> 00:19:11.276 position:50% align:center
so I won't be able to
visit for a while.

00:19:11.359 --> 00:19:12.986 position:50% align:center
Take care of yourself.

00:19:13.069 --> 00:19:17.073 position:50% align:center
We don't want you getting
sick, now do we?

00:19:17.157 --> 00:19:21.244 position:50% align:center
You can save your warnings,
Shigure. I'm already sick.

00:19:21.327 --> 00:19:24.873 position:50% align:center
This is stupid. I hate summer.

00:19:24.956 --> 00:19:28.543 position:50% align:center
The heat makes every day more
miserable than the one before.

00:19:28.626 --> 00:19:30.420 position:50% align:center
My head hurts.

00:19:30.503 --> 00:19:33.423 position:50% align:center
Hatori. Get Hatori.

00:19:33.506 --> 00:19:36.593 position:50% align:center
Hatori's a grown man
with his own life to live.

00:19:36.676 --> 00:19:39.679 position:50% align:center
Yet he's here so much.
The poor thing.

00:19:39.763 --> 00:19:41.264 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Don't pity him.

00:19:41.348 --> 00:19:43.266 position:50% align:center
His life isn't his.

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:47.854 position:50% align:center
It belongs to me.
He lives for my sake.

00:19:47.937 --> 00:19:50.607 position:50% align:center
He should be happy
to do as I ask.

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:52.942 position:50% align:center
If you say so.

00:19:54.444 --> 00:19:55.403 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Hm.

00:19:55.487 --> 00:19:57.405 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
This ridiculous trip.

00:19:57.489 --> 00:20:01.076 position:50% align:center
Those idiots running off with
their ugly little sidekick.

00:20:01.159 --> 00:20:05.246 position:50% align:center
The fools. They're
starting to get cocky.

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:11.211 position:50% align:center
I think... maybe it's time for
me to teach them all a lesson.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.591 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
What? Why are you smiling?

00:20:16.675 --> 00:20:19.844 position:50% align:center
You have a problem with that?

00:20:19.928 --> 00:20:23.807 position:50% align:center
A problem? No, certainly not.

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:26.851 position:50% align:center
Quite the contrary,
as a matter of fact.

00:20:26.935 --> 00:20:32.899 position:50% align:center
I was just going to suggest that
you come to the house, as well.

00:20:32.982 --> 00:20:36.111 position:50% align:center
If you really want to
teach them a lesson.

00:20:39.739 --> 00:20:43.785 position:50% align:center
It came out of nowhere.
Heat must've gotten to him.

00:20:43.868 --> 00:20:46.538 position:50% align:center
Please! Let me help!
What can I do?

00:20:46.621 --> 00:20:50.583 position:50% align:center
Hey, it's only a low-grade
fever. Calm down.

00:20:50.667 --> 00:20:54.462 position:50% align:center
So... um... You mind
if I take a bath?

00:20:54.546 --> 00:20:57.132 position:50% align:center
No. You don't need
my permission to bathe.

00:20:57.215 --> 00:20:58.842 position:50% align:center
Why would I care?

00:20:58.925 --> 00:21:00.343 position:50% align:center
I thought you might get lonely.

00:21:00.427 --> 00:21:02.053 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Go already!

00:21:02.137 --> 00:21:05.181 position:50% align:center
Well, Honda,
I leave him to you.

00:21:05.265 --> 00:21:09.227 position:50% align:center
Sure. I can take care of him.

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:10.228 position:50% align:center
Hm?

00:21:10.311 --> 00:21:11.771 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU gasps]

00:21:14.065 --> 00:21:18.653 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I'm not ready yet, but...

00:21:18.737 --> 00:21:22.198 position:50% align:center
One day, I'll have
something to tell you.

00:21:22.282 --> 00:21:24.409 position:50% align:center
Something real.

00:21:24.492 --> 00:21:27.120 position:50% align:center
You're deluding yourself.

00:21:28.371 --> 00:21:32.459 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
That's not true. It's not.

00:21:32.542 --> 00:21:34.794 position:50% align:center
It isn't all darkness.

00:21:34.878 --> 00:21:37.714 position:50% align:center
There's light now, too.

00:21:37.797 --> 00:21:39.883 position:50% align:center
And with light, there's hope.

00:21:39.966 --> 00:21:42.427 position:50% align:center
Hope for something better.

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:49.142 position:50% align:center
When the time comes,
I'd be happy if you'd listen.

00:22:01.321 --> 00:22:03.531 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I need to open...

00:22:06.659 --> 00:22:08.370 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
...the lid.

00:22:09.954 --> 00:22:12.916 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Open... the lid?
