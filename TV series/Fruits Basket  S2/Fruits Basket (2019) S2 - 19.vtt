00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:21.187 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Mama.

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:24.899 position:50% align:center
Oh, good, you're awake.

00:00:24.983 --> 00:00:27.902 position:50% align:center
How are you feeling? Any better?

00:00:27.986 --> 00:00:30.989 position:50% align:center
Please be careful.
You shouldn't get up yet!

00:00:31.072 --> 00:00:34.909 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Why is she doing this?

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:36.911 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna get close to her.

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:38.788 position:50% align:center
I can't afford to.

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:12.007 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Tohru came home and found you

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.801 position:50% align:center
on the living room
floor, retching.

00:02:14.884 --> 00:02:16.219 position:50% align:center
Then, to complicate
things further,

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:18.346 position:50% align:center
you transformed into a horse.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.933 position:50% align:center
Obviously, we couldn't take you
to the hospital in that state.

00:02:22.017 --> 00:02:23.268 position:50% align:center
So, anyway,

00:02:23.351 --> 00:02:26.021 position:50% align:center
we've been waiting for you
to regain consciousness.

00:02:26.104 --> 00:02:27.897 position:50% align:center
Remember now?

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:29.566 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
I remember.

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:33.737 position:50% align:center
I got lost in a nightmare.
How humiliating.

00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:37.032 position:50% align:center
Now, come on.
We'll take you in.

00:02:37.115 --> 00:02:38.825 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
No. I'm not going.

00:02:38.908 --> 00:02:39.743 position:50% align:center
Please, just--

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:42.287 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
No. I hate hospitals!

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.371 position:50% align:center
No!

00:02:43.455 --> 00:02:44.456 position:50% align:center
[HATORI]
Isuzu!

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:46.875 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Let go of me! Leave me alone!

00:02:47.876 --> 00:02:49.127 position:50% align:center
Isuzu!

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.254 position:50% align:center
Please. Stop it!

00:02:51.338 --> 00:02:54.007 position:50% align:center
Don't do that. Lie back down.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.426 position:50% align:center
Rin, you know,

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:58.303 position:50% align:center
if you'd just learn how
to take care of yourself,

00:02:58.386 --> 00:03:00.764 position:50% align:center
it would simplify things.

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:02.474 position:50% align:center
You want to be left alone,

00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:05.435 position:50% align:center
but you don't make
that very easy to do.

00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:09.564 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Fainting. Losing control.

00:03:09.647 --> 00:03:15.737 position:50% align:center
I'm getting nowhere.
I'll never end it.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.531 position:50% align:center
[HATORI]
All right, tomorrow, then.

00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:21.951 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] I wonder...
why'd Isuzu come here?

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:27.540 position:50% align:center
Was it because she needed help?
She looked... so tormented.

00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:31.961 position:50% align:center
Yes, well, as to that,

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:37.467 position:50% align:center
you should know... that Rin
and I... have been dating.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.636 position:50% align:center
Ah! You're a couple? Seriously?

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:41.179 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Just kidding. Sorry.

00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:43.765 position:50% align:center
You really ought to consider
the situation and the audience

00:03:43.848 --> 00:03:45.308 position:50% align:center
before you say these things.

00:03:45.392 --> 00:03:47.102 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I'll see you later.

00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:50.271 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Right. Goodbye.
Have a good night!

00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:52.357 position:50% align:center
You stay put. I'll just
see him on his way.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.317 position:50% align:center
Oh, okay.

00:03:55.402 --> 00:03:57.696 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Did Akito approve of this?

00:03:57.779 --> 00:03:59.989 position:50% align:center
Your impromptu house call?

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:02.158 position:50% align:center
[HATORI]
I'll make some kind of excuse.

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:04.285 position:50% align:center
The life of a lapdog
must be a tough one.

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:06.037 position:50% align:center
It was you.

00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:09.666 position:50% align:center
She came here to talk
to you, didn't she?

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:11.167 position:50% align:center
Yes, she did.

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:14.713 position:50% align:center
Rin is on a mission, and
there's no dissuading her.

00:04:14.796 --> 00:04:18.675 position:50% align:center
Girl won't rest until she's
found a way to break our curse.

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:19.801 position:50% align:center
By herself.

00:04:19.884 --> 00:04:21.344 position:50% align:center
She drops by every so often

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:23.513 position:50% align:center
because she suspects
I know of one.

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:26.182 position:50% align:center
Though I've assured
her that I don't.

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:31.104 position:50% align:center
[HATORI] Ending the curse?
That's absurd.

00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:35.025 position:50% align:center
Of course. It's a
ridiculous idea, right?

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:38.278 position:50% align:center
But, Doc... is it really?

00:04:40.196 --> 00:04:44.242 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Hatori, do you hear it?

00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:45.827 position:50% align:center
[HATORI]
Hear what?

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.875 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
The sound of something breaking.

00:04:53.918 --> 00:04:56.796 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Rin, you should eat.

00:04:58.214 --> 00:05:02.135 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU] If you tell Haru about
this, I'll never forgive you.

00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:04.095 position:50% align:center
Haru told me you could
manage things on your own,

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:06.598 position:50% align:center
so I won't do that.

00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:09.601 position:50% align:center
But I do wanna
tell you one thing.

00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:13.521 position:50% align:center
You should know,
he still loves you.

00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:16.358 position:50% align:center
He loves you very much.

00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:20.362 position:50% align:center
[door closes]

00:05:23.782 --> 00:05:26.868 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU] I think they've
changed because of her.

00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:30.455 position:50% align:center
Yuki and Kyo. They've
mellowed out lately.

00:05:30.538 --> 00:05:33.041 position:50% align:center
What is she, some
sort of superhero?

00:05:33.124 --> 00:05:35.835 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
No, she's pretty normal.

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:38.254 position:50% align:center
You'd understand if you met her.

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:40.799 position:50% align:center
She's just kind.

00:05:40.882 --> 00:05:43.718 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Oh, Haru, so are you.

00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:47.347 position:50% align:center
You're kind. Too kind.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.558 position:50% align:center
I feel sorry for kind people.

00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:55.021 position:50% align:center
That's why I didn't want
to see you, or that girl.

00:05:57.399 --> 00:06:00.068 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU] But then, the first
time I went to Gure's house

00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:04.114 position:50% align:center
after our breakup,
there she was.

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:09.411 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
And an impulse came over me.

00:06:09.494 --> 00:06:11.037 position:50% align:center
So strong.

00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:13.331 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:06:13.415 --> 00:06:17.210 position:50% align:center
Hey, I'm back. Hope you're
feeling a bit better.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.756 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Um, I'll be sleeping
downstairs in the living room.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.385 position:50% align:center
If you need anything, just
shout and I should hear you.

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:28.388 position:50% align:center
Oh, and I brought you some
water in case you get thirsty.

00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:30.765 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Stop it.

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:33.935 position:50% align:center
You're trying to break
the curse, aren't you?

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:38.106 position:50% align:center
That's why you went to Kazuma's.
To ask him about it.

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:41.651 position:50% align:center
Why are you bothering?
Because you pity us?

00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:44.195 position:50% align:center
You wanna help out
the poor zodiac freaks?

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:46.448 position:50% align:center
Just keep out of it, all right?

00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:48.199 position:50% align:center
None of this is your business!

00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:50.035 position:50% align:center
Do what all kind people should.

00:06:50.118 --> 00:06:53.246 position:50% align:center
Stay safe in your
kind little world!

00:06:53.329 --> 00:06:57.250 position:50% align:center
It sounds like you blame me
for having those things.

00:06:57.334 --> 00:06:59.336 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
I don't, really.

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:03.173 position:50% align:center
But this is the only way
I can get it across.

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:06.259 position:50% align:center
I don't want kind people
to be taken advantage of.

00:07:06.343 --> 00:07:09.179 position:50% align:center
To see them suffer.

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:10.722 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Is that it?

00:07:10.805 --> 00:07:11.931 position:50% align:center
Have you been trying
to figure out

00:07:12.015 --> 00:07:14.100 position:50% align:center
how to break the
curse too, Isuzu?

00:07:14.184 --> 00:07:14.976 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU grunts]

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.394 position:50% align:center
I told you to stay out of it!

00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:17.854 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Did you find a way?

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:19.647 position:50% align:center
Do you know how to break
the curse? Do you?

00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:22.108 position:50% align:center
Shut up! This has
nothing to do with you!

00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:23.234 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Isuzu, please!

00:07:23.318 --> 00:07:24.986 position:50% align:center
Can't you just mind
your own business?

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.281 position:50% align:center
No, I can't! This is
something I have to do!

00:07:28.365 --> 00:07:30.408 position:50% align:center
I'm not kidding. Drop it.

00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:31.993 position:50% align:center
I won't!

00:07:32.077 --> 00:07:34.954 position:50% align:center
There are things I can't give up
on, just like there are for you!

00:07:35.038 --> 00:07:36.164 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Shut up!

00:07:36.247 --> 00:07:37.999 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Sometimes giving
up isn't an option!

00:07:38.083 --> 00:07:39.042 position:50% align:center
I'll find a way!

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:42.212 position:50% align:center
No! Stop talking!
It's impossible!

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:46.132 position:50% align:center
Don't you understand?
There's just no way.

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:48.718 position:50% align:center
No one knows how
to do it. No one.

00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:52.055 position:50% align:center
I can't set him free.

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:57.310 position:50% align:center
I don't... know what to do.

00:07:57.394 --> 00:07:59.688 position:50% align:center
I'm lost.

00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:01.314 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Isuzu!

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:06.277 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU] This... This is why
I stayed away from her.

00:08:06.361 --> 00:08:07.487 position:50% align:center
Because she's the type of person

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:11.449 position:50% align:center
who can make me feel
things I hate to feel.

00:08:11.533 --> 00:08:13.201 position:50% align:center
Like before.

00:08:15.954 --> 00:08:18.331 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
I wanted to burst into tears.

00:08:18.415 --> 00:08:22.043 position:50% align:center
To run over to her,
lay my head in her lap,

00:08:22.127 --> 00:08:26.131 position:50% align:center
and surrender my heart to her.

00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:28.425 position:50% align:center
I wanted to whine
about how weak I am

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:30.218 position:50% align:center
and how unfair the world is,

00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:33.388 position:50% align:center
like a child going to
her mom for comfort.

00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:36.891 position:50% align:center
Hoping I might
finally be forgiven.

00:08:36.975 --> 00:08:41.396 position:50% align:center
I might be accepted
for who I am.

00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:46.317 position:50% align:center
But as much as I wanted to,
I couldn't do that to her.

00:08:46.401 --> 00:08:49.154 position:50% align:center
People like me yearn
for kind people.

00:08:49.237 --> 00:08:52.949 position:50% align:center
We cling to them, take
advantage of what they offer,

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:56.327 position:50% align:center
demand more than
they have to give.

00:08:56.411 --> 00:09:00.582 position:50% align:center
That's why... I can't
drag you into this.

00:09:00.665 --> 00:09:04.085 position:50% align:center
I'll keep running,
but I'll do it alone.

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:06.671 position:50% align:center
I don't care if they
don't understand.

00:09:06.755 --> 00:09:09.424 position:50% align:center
It's better if they hate me.

00:09:09.507 --> 00:09:11.968 position:50% align:center
I'm fine on my own.

00:09:12.052 --> 00:09:15.096 position:50% align:center
I thought that, and I meant it.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:18.099 position:50% align:center
I was so determined
to hold in my tears.

00:09:18.183 --> 00:09:19.392 position:50% align:center
But...

00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:24.606 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
...here I am clinging to you.

00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:32.447 position:50% align:center
Powerless... completely
terrified... and weak--so weak.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.199 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry.

00:09:36.368 --> 00:09:40.872 position:50% align:center
I'm lost. I just don't
know what to do anymore!

00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:42.248 position:50% align:center
I don't know!

00:09:42.332 --> 00:09:45.794 position:50% align:center
I can't do anything.
Not like this.

00:09:45.877 --> 00:09:47.712 position:50% align:center
Not on my own.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:55.178 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
It's hard, being on your own.

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:58.181 position:50% align:center
And scary.

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:00.225 position:50% align:center
So scary.

00:10:03.228 --> 00:10:05.397 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
You can't stand on your own.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.192 position:50% align:center
Your strength alone...
isn't enough.

00:10:11.194 --> 00:10:15.323 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] Sometimes you
have to lean on others.

00:10:15.407 --> 00:10:19.369 position:50% align:center
What you do next,
that's what matters.

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:22.956 position:50% align:center
Do you keep relying on somebody
else to take care of you?

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:25.083 position:50% align:center
Or...

00:10:25.166 --> 00:10:29.087 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
As different as we might be...

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:30.964 position:50% align:center
...I realized there was
at least one way

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:33.550 position:50% align:center
in which Rin and I were similar.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.221 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] We were yearning
for the same thing.

00:10:44.853 --> 00:10:46.354 position:50% align:center
I was pretty shocked.

00:10:46.438 --> 00:10:49.441 position:50% align:center
I went to go visit her
and she swung the IV at me.

00:10:49.524 --> 00:10:50.400 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
What?

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:52.068 position:50% align:center
Go away!

00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:53.778 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU] The hospital
staff kicked me out,

00:10:53.862 --> 00:10:56.948 position:50% align:center
claiming I was a detriment
to the patient's health.

00:10:57.032 --> 00:10:58.992 position:50% align:center
That sounds like
it must've hurt.

00:10:59.075 --> 00:11:00.744 position:50% align:center
Nah, I'm fine.

00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:03.997 position:50% align:center
If anything, I was glad
that she seemed so lively.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.666 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's one way
to look at it, I guess.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:09.252 position:50% align:center
Well, sounds like she's
gonna be in there for a while,

00:11:09.336 --> 00:11:10.962 position:50% align:center
so there'll be other visits.

00:11:11.046 --> 00:11:13.173 position:50% align:center
We can talk then.

00:11:13.256 --> 00:11:16.051 position:50% align:center
Anyway, you don't
have to worry anymore.

00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:18.136 position:50% align:center
[music sounds]

00:11:18.219 --> 00:11:22.182 position:50% align:center
[KIMI] Yun-Yun! Where are
you? Playing hooky?

00:11:22.265 --> 00:11:25.602 position:50% align:center
Our meeting's about to
start, so come to Kimi!

00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:29.189 position:50% align:center
Oh, whoopsie. I meant come
to the student council room!

00:11:29.272 --> 00:11:31.066 position:50% align:center
Oh, what a silly mistake!

00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:34.319 position:50% align:center
Sorry, Yun-Yun.
Kimi will be waiting.

00:11:34.402 --> 00:11:38.448 position:50% align:center
So come now please.

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:40.033 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Kill!!

00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:43.536 position:50% align:center
Did... she really just say
that to the whole school?

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:47.415 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow. She's like a mistress
flaunting your relationship.

00:11:47.499 --> 00:11:50.293 position:50% align:center
I didn't know you were into
that type of girl, Yun-Yun.

00:11:50.377 --> 00:11:51.086 position:50% align:center
Huh.

00:11:51.169 --> 00:11:52.587 position:50% align:center
Don't call me "Yun-Yun"!

00:11:52.671 --> 00:11:53.755 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Huh?

00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:56.216 position:50% align:center
Hey, Yun- Yun! There you are!

00:11:56.299 --> 00:11:58.718 position:50% align:center
Hurry and come to Kakeru.
I miss you so!

00:11:58.802 --> 00:12:01.846 position:50% align:center
Oh, whoopsie!
What a silly mistake!

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:05.517 position:50% align:center
He has to know, doesn't he,
how annoying he is?

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.143 position:50% align:center
Yes, here I am.

00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:10.021 position:50% align:center
Why broadcast a message when
you could find me so quickly?

00:12:10.105 --> 00:12:13.525 position:50% align:center
It wasn't that quick, though.
I've been looking for a while.

00:12:13.608 --> 00:12:15.276 position:50% align:center
You don't have a
cell phone, Yun-Yun.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.780 position:50% align:center
That's why we used the PA
system. Make sense now?

00:12:18.863 --> 00:12:21.700 position:50% align:center
I would've been there on time;
you didn't need to remind me!

00:12:21.783 --> 00:12:24.285 position:50% align:center
Agh! Will you unclench for once?

00:12:24.369 --> 00:12:25.912 position:50% align:center
I wasn't even the one
doing the talking.

00:12:25.995 --> 00:12:27.288 position:50% align:center
I just think it's funny.

00:12:27.372 --> 00:12:29.374 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Why're you getting mad at me?

00:12:29.457 --> 00:12:32.919 position:50% align:center
I leave him to you.
Please take good care of Yuki.

00:12:33.003 --> 00:12:35.130 position:50% align:center
Wait, what? Take care of me?

00:12:35.213 --> 00:12:36.673 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:39.175 position:50% align:center
I will do everything in my power
to make your daughter happy.

00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:43.013 position:50% align:center
Okay. Do you want me
to slap you? I will.

00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:44.139 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
All right, Yuki.

00:12:44.222 --> 00:12:46.433 position:50% align:center
You have a meeting,
right? Get goin'.

00:12:46.516 --> 00:12:48.727 position:50% align:center
Oh. Yeah, but--

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:51.521 position:50% align:center
Remember to fight.

00:12:56.067 --> 00:13:00.739 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Yeah. He's right.
I need to switch gears.

00:13:00.822 --> 00:13:02.991 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Oh, I've been meaning to ask.

00:13:03.074 --> 00:13:04.117 position:50% align:center
There's a rumor going around

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.910 position:50% align:center
about this year's
culture festival.

00:13:05.994 --> 00:13:07.620 position:50% align:center
Is it true that
we'll have a bonfire

00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:09.956 position:50% align:center
and maybe even some
fireworks, too?

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.833 position:50% align:center
No, that really is just a rumor.

00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:13.960 position:50% align:center
Right. Of course.

00:13:14.044 --> 00:13:17.672 position:50% align:center
I mean, those were a couple of
suggestions that people made,

00:13:17.756 --> 00:13:19.132 position:50% align:center
but they're not feasible.

00:13:19.215 --> 00:13:20.425 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:13:20.508 --> 00:13:22.010 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Oh, no, i-it's okay.

00:13:22.093 --> 00:13:23.720 position:50% align:center
Would it really be so hard?

00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:26.181 position:50% align:center
In his day, Aya lit up
the entire school.

00:13:26.264 --> 00:13:28.683 position:50% align:center
Observe in wonder as I
illuminate our school!

00:13:28.767 --> 00:13:31.186 position:50% align:center
You know that's just another
reason not to do it, right?

00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:32.896 position:50% align:center
The cost alone.

00:13:32.979 --> 00:13:34.397 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] You've got
to shell out sometimes

00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:35.607 position:50% align:center
to be a true romantic.

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.401 position:50% align:center
Yeah? Just sounds like
a waste of money to me.

00:13:38.485 --> 00:13:40.612 position:50% align:center
So the culture festival's
coming up soon, is it?

00:13:40.695 --> 00:13:44.532 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. It won't be for a little
while yet. We've got time.

00:13:44.616 --> 00:13:46.618 position:50% align:center
I'm just planning ahead
because of exams.

00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:48.828 position:50% align:center
You can do it, Mr. President.

00:13:48.912 --> 00:13:50.997 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Ugh. It's that smile again.

00:13:51.081 --> 00:13:53.833 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
So... anyone want dessert?

00:13:53.917 --> 00:13:56.294 position:50% align:center
I have some jello if
you've still got room.

00:13:56.378 --> 00:13:58.004 position:50% align:center
Ooh, I do, thank you.

00:13:58.088 --> 00:13:59.339 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
You made it?

00:13:59.422 --> 00:14:01.591 position:50% align:center
Yep! I have orange, apple,
and grapefruit flavor,

00:14:01.675 --> 00:14:02.884 position:50% align:center
so pick your favorite.

00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:05.595 position:50% align:center
That's a lot.
What's the occasion?

00:14:05.679 --> 00:14:07.097 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Hey.

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:10.433 position:50% align:center
You went to see Rin at the
hospital. I'm right, aren't I?

00:14:10.517 --> 00:14:12.185 position:50% align:center
Yes, I did.

00:14:12.268 --> 00:14:14.604 position:50% align:center
I'm impressed you were
able to figure that out.

00:14:14.688 --> 00:14:15.980 position:50% align:center
Lucky guess.

00:14:16.064 --> 00:14:17.732 position:50% align:center
That's been happening
a lot lately.

00:14:17.816 --> 00:14:20.944 position:50% align:center
Every guess that you make seems
to be right when it comes to me.

00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:23.238 position:50% align:center
[KYO] You're pretty easy
to read, you know?

00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:26.783 position:50% align:center
Um. I don't think I really
am for everyone, am I?

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:29.577 position:50% align:center
Not exactly sounding
very sure of yourself.

00:14:29.661 --> 00:14:31.830 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Umm. Heh.

00:14:31.913 --> 00:14:32.664 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Miss Honda?

00:14:32.747 --> 00:14:34.040 position:50% align:center
Yes?

00:14:34.124 --> 00:14:36.543 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] When you went to
visit Rin, how did she seem?

00:14:36.626 --> 00:14:40.922 position:50% align:center
She didn't maybe... throw an
IV stand at you, for example?

00:14:41.006 --> 00:14:42.257 position:50% align:center
[KYO, TOHRU grunt]

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.718 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Um. No, she didn't
throw anything at me.

00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:47.387 position:50% align:center
[KYO] Why are you even asking
such a dumb question?

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:48.471 position:50% align:center
No one would do that.

00:14:48.555 --> 00:14:49.639 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Don't be so sure.

00:14:49.723 --> 00:14:50.932 position:50% align:center
She seemed well.

00:14:51.016 --> 00:14:53.393 position:50% align:center
She's starting to get some
of her energy back.

00:14:53.476 --> 00:14:54.978 position:50% align:center
Oh, by the way, Tohru.

00:14:55.061 --> 00:14:57.897 position:50% align:center
I've been meaning to apologize
about the whole Rin situation.

00:14:57.981 --> 00:15:00.275 position:50% align:center
We shouldn't have dragged
you into our little drama.

00:15:00.358 --> 00:15:02.152 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry you
had to get involved.

00:15:02.235 --> 00:15:04.612 position:50% align:center
You better not be planning
to eat all of those.

00:15:04.696 --> 00:15:07.657 position:50% align:center
It's no trouble at all! Really.

00:15:07.741 --> 00:15:10.493 position:50% align:center
It's not. Never!

00:15:10.577 --> 00:15:11.870 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Tohru.

00:15:11.953 --> 00:15:13.955 position:50% align:center
And now, allow me to feed
you this tasty treat

00:15:14.039 --> 00:15:15.582 position:50% align:center
as a token of my appreciation!

00:15:15.665 --> 00:15:16.666 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Hey.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.043 position:50% align:center
Put the spoon down,
you total creep.

00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:19.753 position:50% align:center
[KYO] Leave her alone
or I will kill you.

00:15:19.836 --> 00:15:20.712 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I mean it, Shigure.

00:15:20.795 --> 00:15:23.298 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
She was suffering.

00:15:23.381 --> 00:15:29.554 position:50% align:center
In her agony, she clung to me so
tightly, it was almost painful.

00:15:29.637 --> 00:15:32.015 position:50% align:center
All I could do was hold her.

00:15:32.098 --> 00:15:33.808 position:50% align:center
But later...

00:15:33.892 --> 00:15:36.728 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Shouldn't you eat?
To get your strength back?

00:15:36.811 --> 00:15:39.731 position:50% align:center
Don't want to.
It's all foods I hate.

00:15:39.814 --> 00:15:41.441 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
What foods don't you hate?

00:15:41.524 --> 00:15:43.360 position:50% align:center
There must be some.

00:15:44.444 --> 00:15:46.696 position:50% align:center
Jello's good.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:50.408 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] I think she must have
taken it all upon herself

00:15:50.492 --> 00:15:52.786 position:50% align:center
for such a long time.

00:15:52.869 --> 00:15:58.458 position:50% align:center
Enduring it alone, even as
the pain tore at her heart.

00:15:58.541 --> 00:16:00.293 position:50% align:center
Suffering.

00:16:02.796 --> 00:16:04.464 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:16:04.547 --> 00:16:06.883 position:50% align:center
Can I come in?

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:09.219 position:50% align:center
Isuzu?

00:16:09.302 --> 00:16:10.929 position:50% align:center
Oh, you're here again?

00:16:11.012 --> 00:16:12.097 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:13.515 position:50% align:center
You look so cute!

00:16:13.598 --> 00:16:15.308 position:50% align:center
I've never seen you with
your hair tied back before.

00:16:15.392 --> 00:16:17.811 position:50% align:center
I love it!

00:16:17.894 --> 00:16:20.230 position:50% align:center
Ah! But it's so pretty.

00:16:20.313 --> 00:16:22.190 position:50% align:center
Calm down. I had
a checkup today.

00:16:22.273 --> 00:16:24.067 position:50% align:center
That's the only reason I did it.

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:25.568 position:50% align:center
Still, you look so nice though,

00:16:25.652 --> 00:16:28.071 position:50% align:center
you might as well
leave it up, right?

00:16:28.154 --> 00:16:29.280 position:50% align:center
Oh! By the way.

00:16:29.364 --> 00:16:31.533 position:50% align:center
Here, I brought some
jello you might like.

00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:33.576 position:50% align:center
Just 'cause I said
I didn't hate it?

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:34.577 position:50% align:center
That was dumb.

00:16:34.661 --> 00:16:35.620 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU chuckles]

00:16:35.704 --> 00:16:36.955 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I know you didn't ask me to,

00:16:37.038 --> 00:16:38.957 position:50% align:center
but I figured,
what could it hurt?

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.959 position:50% align:center
I'll eat it later.

00:16:41.042 --> 00:16:45.714 position:50% align:center
I just don't feel comfortable
eating in front of people.

00:16:45.797 --> 00:16:47.048 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:16:47.132 --> 00:16:49.300 position:50% align:center
I'll put it over in
your fridge, then.

00:16:50.719 --> 00:16:52.178 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
You know,

00:16:52.262 --> 00:16:55.140 position:50% align:center
I think I have a pretty good
idea of why you came to see me.

00:16:55.223 --> 00:16:56.266 position:50% align:center
What?

00:16:56.349 --> 00:16:58.893 position:50% align:center
It's about the zodiac
curse, isn't it?

00:17:01.229 --> 00:17:03.273 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry!

00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:05.358 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I completely forgot about it!

00:17:05.442 --> 00:17:08.486 position:50% align:center
I'm awful. Horrible.
The absolute worst!

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:10.113 position:50% align:center
What's with you?

00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:14.868 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Akito told me.

00:17:14.951 --> 00:17:18.788 position:50% align:center
Akito's God. To the members
of the zodiac, anyway.

00:17:18.872 --> 00:17:21.374 position:50% align:center
And eventually you'll
all live together,

00:17:21.458 --> 00:17:24.502 position:50% align:center
and it'll stay that way forever.

00:17:24.586 --> 00:17:30.216 position:50% align:center
Every step in tandem...
and every breath is shared.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:32.135 position:50% align:center
Enduring.

00:17:33.762 --> 00:17:39.267 position:50% align:center
Is that what you refer to
as the curse? That bond?

00:17:39.351 --> 00:17:42.979 position:50% align:center
The <i>thing</i> that
ties you together.

00:17:43.063 --> 00:17:44.606 position:50% align:center
It is.

00:17:44.689 --> 00:17:47.692 position:50% align:center
God and the zodiac members
made a promise.

00:17:47.776 --> 00:17:49.736 position:50% align:center
We don't have any memory of it.

00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:52.197 position:50% align:center
It happened long ago.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.741 position:50% align:center
How long? Who knows?

00:17:54.824 --> 00:17:58.036 position:50% align:center
Probably hundreds
of years at least.

00:17:58.119 --> 00:18:02.749 position:50% align:center
But they swore... a solemn vow.

00:18:02.832 --> 00:18:05.877 position:50% align:center
No matter how many
times they're reborn,

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:11.591 position:50% align:center
they will return to God's
side and never leave.

00:18:11.675 --> 00:18:16.388 position:50% align:center
They would stay together
for eternity.

00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:21.017 position:50% align:center
That promise still holds.
We're bound to it to this day.

00:18:21.101 --> 00:18:23.061 position:50% align:center
We may not remember it,

00:18:23.144 --> 00:18:26.189 position:50% align:center
but the blood of the
zodiac spirits does.

00:18:27.148 --> 00:18:28.900 position:50% align:center
You call it a bond,

00:18:28.983 --> 00:18:32.612 position:50% align:center
and maybe it seems romantic
to an outsider like you,

00:18:32.696 --> 00:18:35.573 position:50% align:center
but if something holds
you against your will,

00:18:35.657 --> 00:18:38.326 position:50% align:center
then it's nothing but a chain.

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:40.870 position:50% align:center
That's why we call it a curse.

00:18:42.205 --> 00:18:44.124 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Is it true what you said?

00:18:44.207 --> 00:18:47.752 position:50% align:center
Is there really no way
it can be broken?

00:18:47.836 --> 00:18:50.714 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU] I'm not even sure
if Akito knows how,

00:18:50.797 --> 00:18:54.134 position:50% align:center
or would have any motivation
to tell me if so.

00:18:54.217 --> 00:18:56.803 position:50% align:center
I thought someone in the
inner circle might know.

00:18:56.886 --> 00:18:58.972 position:50% align:center
Might help us.

00:18:59.055 --> 00:19:02.225 position:50% align:center
But Gure says he has no idea.

00:19:02.308 --> 00:19:03.309 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:03.393 --> 00:19:04.394 position:50% align:center
There's Kureno.

00:19:04.477 --> 00:19:05.603 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Hm?

00:19:05.687 --> 00:19:07.981 position:50% align:center
That's it! I bet Kureno
could have the answer.

00:19:08.064 --> 00:19:10.025 position:50% align:center
That spineless man?

00:19:10.108 --> 00:19:12.652 position:50% align:center
He does whatever
Akito tells him to.

00:19:12.736 --> 00:19:15.196 position:50% align:center
I don't consider him one of us.

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:18.867 position:50% align:center
Don't say that. You shouldn't
say that Kureno is spineless.

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:20.618 position:50% align:center
I'm just telling the
truth. Deal with it.

00:19:20.702 --> 00:19:22.996 position:50% align:center
That's not fair.

00:19:23.079 --> 00:19:24.664 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
Goodbye.

00:19:25.707 --> 00:19:29.836 position:50% align:center
It's worth a try. I'm
going to see Kureno now!

00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:32.339 position:50% align:center
[screaming]

00:19:33.298 --> 00:19:34.924 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Don't run off on your own.

00:19:35.008 --> 00:19:38.553 position:50% align:center
Oh. Okay. I'm sorry.

00:19:38.636 --> 00:19:41.556 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU] Could that be the
answer we're looking for?

00:19:41.639 --> 00:19:45.101 position:50% align:center
Listen, why do you want
to break the curse?

00:19:45.185 --> 00:19:47.354 position:50% align:center
There are things you
can't give up on.

00:19:47.437 --> 00:19:51.858 position:50% align:center
Like what? What is it that's
most precious to you?

00:19:51.941 --> 00:19:52.817 position:50% align:center
Tell me.

00:19:52.901 --> 00:19:54.861 position:50% align:center
Oh, well, I...

00:19:58.365 --> 00:19:59.741 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:07.791 --> 00:20:12.587 position:50% align:center
You know, it's fine.
You don't have to tell me.

00:20:12.671 --> 00:20:13.838 position:50% align:center
Just don't do something stupid

00:20:13.922 --> 00:20:16.424 position:50% align:center
like running off to see
Kureno by yourself.

00:20:16.508 --> 00:20:18.551 position:50% align:center
Hey, Isuzu.

00:20:18.635 --> 00:20:20.095 position:50% align:center
If you're really that
concerned about me

00:20:20.178 --> 00:20:22.389 position:50% align:center
doing things by myself,

00:20:22.472 --> 00:20:24.599 position:50% align:center
then maybe we should
team up and work together.

00:20:24.683 --> 00:20:26.267 position:50% align:center
Sound good?

00:20:26.351 --> 00:20:29.020 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU] I don't need an
unreliable partner like you.

00:20:29.104 --> 00:20:30.063 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU gasps]

00:20:30.146 --> 00:20:31.523 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
W-- I-I'll do my best.

00:20:31.606 --> 00:20:33.858 position:50% align:center
I really will, I swear!

00:20:37.028 --> 00:20:39.072 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU] What is it that's
most precious to you?

00:20:39.155 --> 00:20:40.865 position:50% align:center
Tell me.

00:20:40.949 --> 00:20:42.534 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I just stood there.

00:20:42.617 --> 00:20:46.287 position:50% align:center
Why couldn't I make
myself say anything?

00:20:46.371 --> 00:20:49.749 position:50% align:center
Before, I would have
answered right away.

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:55.255 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Huh? What's going on?

00:20:55.338 --> 00:20:58.842 position:50% align:center
This doesn't look
like Shigure's house.

00:20:58.925 --> 00:21:00.343 position:50% align:center
Is it--?

00:21:00.427 --> 00:21:03.596 position:50% align:center
Yes! It's our apartment.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:08.727 position:50% align:center
Where the two of us always
lived. It's our home.

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:11.187 position:50% align:center
I'm going now, Tohru.

00:21:11.271 --> 00:21:14.149 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
No. Don't go.

00:21:14.232 --> 00:21:18.862 position:50% align:center
Something will happen.
An accident!

00:21:18.945 --> 00:21:22.490 position:50% align:center
Please don't go. Come back.

00:21:22.574 --> 00:21:24.325 position:50% align:center
Don't go!

00:21:25.452 --> 00:21:26.745 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:30.373 --> 00:21:32.417 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Mom.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.669 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU] She's got it
locked behind a door

00:21:34.753 --> 00:21:36.796 position:50% align:center
where no one can see.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.799 position:50% align:center
But there's something
silently pushing her

00:21:39.883 --> 00:21:43.136 position:50% align:center
toward a breaking point.

00:21:43.219 --> 00:21:47.390 position:50% align:center
And once she reaches it,
there will be no going back.

00:21:47.474 --> 00:21:49.309 position:50% align:center
Ever.

00:21:49.392 --> 00:21:52.729 position:50% align:center
I hope someone like
him will find her.

00:21:52.812 --> 00:21:56.399 position:50% align:center
Someone who will gently
open up that door.

00:21:56.483 --> 00:21:59.361 position:50% align:center
Like Haru did for me.

00:21:59.444 --> 00:22:03.365 position:50% align:center
You can't help but yearn
for someone like that.

00:22:04.616 --> 00:22:06.534 position:50% align:center
This is good.

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:12.499 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU] Because someone
who knows how scary it is

00:22:12.582 --> 00:22:16.544 position:50% align:center
to be alone needs
somebody to love.

00:22:18.672 --> 00:22:22.217 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Together, always.

00:23:57.729 --> 00:23:59.773 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
"Are you okay?"
