[YUKI'S MOTHER]
I don't see why it matters.

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:20.854 position:50% align:center
So what if you are a tool?
It doesn't change anything.

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:35.368 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] It's been a while
since I had that dream.

00:00:35.452 --> 00:00:37.245 position:50% align:center
This is the worst.

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:41.791 position:50% align:center
Ah! Good morning!

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:43.251 position:50% align:center
<i>Mon petit chou-chou!</i>

00:00:43.335 --> 00:00:44.669 position:50% align:center
Though, to be fair,

00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:46.338 position:50% align:center
I don't honestly know how
accurate that sentiment is

00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:48.923 position:50% align:center
when you've stayed abed until
the sun is high in the sky.

00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:50.842 position:50% align:center
So, you're a late riser.

00:00:50.925 --> 00:00:53.178 position:50% align:center
I can't rightly say if
I'm surprised or not.

00:00:53.261 --> 00:00:56.181 position:50% align:center
As for me, I keep
my own hours...

00:00:56.264 --> 00:00:57.640 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
This is the worst.

00:00:57.724 --> 00:00:59.601 position:50% align:center
Ah! And so it goes.

00:00:59.684 --> 00:01:01.478 position:50% align:center
Thus shall we continue
to learn about each other,

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:03.021 position:50% align:center
one small step at a time.

00:01:03.104 --> 00:01:04.522 position:50% align:center
How beautiful!

00:01:04.606 --> 00:01:07.817 position:50% align:center
I promise to spend every waking
moment today by your side.

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:09.319 position:50% align:center
I swear it!

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:10.904 position:50% align:center
Bye!

00:01:10.987 --> 00:01:12.864 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] You just said you were
going to stay with me all day!

00:01:12.947 --> 00:01:14.449 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
I see.

00:01:14.532 --> 00:01:17.160 position:50% align:center
You dear boy! I didn't know you
were so bereft in my absence.

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:20.413 position:50% align:center
Now, let us go! We shall
celebrate our brotherly love.

00:01:20.497 --> 00:01:22.415 position:50% align:center
A meal of barbeque short
ribs should do nicely!

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:24.793 position:50% align:center
Get off of me!

00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:26.670 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Hey, if you're done yelling,

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:28.630 position:50% align:center
can we eat the peaches?

00:01:28.713 --> 00:01:30.173 position:50% align:center
[AYAME] I thought a gift
of peaches would be

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:33.343 position:50% align:center
a suitable follow-up for the
crab I brought previously.

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:36.930 position:50% align:center
Eat! Savor its juicy sweetness
whilst I toil away.

00:01:37.013 --> 00:01:39.057 position:50% align:center
Feel free to express
your gratitude.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.558 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes! Thank you so much!

00:01:40.642 --> 00:01:43.478 position:50% align:center
Good girl. While you're at it,
peel one for me as well?

00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:44.854 position:50% align:center
Sure!

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:46.231 position:50% align:center
Don't talk to her like
she's some kind of servant!

00:01:46.314 --> 00:01:48.858 position:50% align:center
Well, I can't do it
myself. Heavens, no!

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:51.611 position:50% align:center
Just think of how sticky that
would make my poor fingers.

00:01:51.695 --> 00:01:54.531 position:50% align:center
Do you even listen to the words
that come out of your mouth?

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:56.408 position:50% align:center
Worry not, Aya, my sweet.

00:01:56.491 --> 00:01:59.202 position:50% align:center
If you but ask, my peach
is yours for the taking.

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:01.663 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Gure.
But I don't need it.

00:02:01.746 --> 00:02:04.124 position:50% align:center
Your love is more than
enough to satisfy my heart.

00:02:04.207 --> 00:02:05.083 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Leave! Now!

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:06.960 position:50% align:center
Honestly. Just calm down.

00:02:07.043 --> 00:02:09.921 position:50% align:center
You let every little thing
get to you. Sounds tiring.

00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:13.049 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it is. You have
no idea how much.

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:14.968 position:50% align:center
There! All finished.

00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:17.303 position:50% align:center
Now try it on. I wanna
see how it looks.

00:02:17.387 --> 00:02:18.763 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
What did you do to my shirt?

00:02:18.847 --> 00:02:21.016 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE laughs]

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.851 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow! It's perfect for you!

00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:24.561 position:50% align:center
It's a representation
of the solemn oath

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:25.812 position:50% align:center
that I swore to Yuki.

00:02:25.895 --> 00:02:27.480 position:50% align:center
Never to leave his side.

00:02:27.564 --> 00:02:28.690 position:50% align:center
How 'bout you swear an oath

00:02:28.773 --> 00:02:30.900 position:50% align:center
never to touch my
clothing again?

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:33.778 position:50% align:center
Your brother did this as
an expression of his love.

00:02:33.862 --> 00:02:35.321 position:50% align:center
You should treasure it.

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:38.033 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Says the guy who was
dying of laughter a second ago.

00:02:38.116 --> 00:02:39.492 position:50% align:center
Just two people in this world

00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:41.453 position:50% align:center
can embroider so well,
so quickly.

00:02:41.536 --> 00:02:43.079 position:50% align:center
It's a very rare talent.

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:45.290 position:50% align:center
Should you not believe
me, brother of mine,

00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:47.375 position:50% align:center
I suggest you visit my shop.

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.002 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
All right.

00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:50.128 position:50% align:center
--[AYAME gasps]
--[TOHRU] Eh?

00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:51.755 position:50% align:center
I'll do it.

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:54.049 position:50% align:center
Visit your shop, I mean.

00:02:54.132 --> 00:02:59.554 position:50% align:center
I've never seen it before,
and I should... sometime.

00:02:59.637 --> 00:03:03.558 position:50% align:center
I was thinking that, maybe,
if I saw your work,

00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:07.479 position:50% align:center
I'd understand you
a little better.

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:09.272 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
He's trying.

00:03:09.356 --> 00:03:12.400 position:50% align:center
He wants to change his
relationship with Ayame.

00:03:12.484 --> 00:03:15.195 position:50% align:center
Even though it's
not always easy.

00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:16.613 position:50% align:center
Did you just hear that, Gure?

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:17.489 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:03:17.572 --> 00:03:19.407 position:50% align:center
Yuki, my most beloved brother,

00:03:19.491 --> 00:03:21.576 position:50% align:center
is tearfully begging for
a glimpse of the shrine

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:23.453 position:50% align:center
that houses my
marvelous creations.

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:25.580 position:50% align:center
Um, there was no
crying involved.

00:03:25.663 --> 00:03:27.374 position:50% align:center
[AYAME] Today is the best of
all days! None can compare!

00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:28.500 position:50% align:center
Will you please sit down?

00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:30.585 position:50% align:center
[AYAME] I must share
the news at once!

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:33.546 position:50% align:center
You'll never believe it, Tori.
Yuki, my beloved brother--

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.090 position:50% align:center
That's enough!

00:03:35.173 --> 00:03:37.217 position:50% align:center
I would be honored to grant
your humble request, of course.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.469 position:50% align:center
And I'm sure you'd love to
visit as soon as possible;

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:40.970 position:50% align:center
let's make it Sunday.

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:42.305 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:43.973 position:50% align:center
[AYAME] Naturally, you must
come as well, Tohru.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:47.268 position:50% align:center
A princess should always
remain by her prince's side.

00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:49.312 position:50% align:center
I, um-- Princess?

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:52.857 position:50% align:center
However, your presence
won't be required. Sorry.

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:54.401 position:50% align:center
I don't know what
you're talking about,

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:55.944 position:50% align:center
and I don't want to, either.

00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:57.696 position:50% align:center
Get outta here, you freak.

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:00.615 position:50% align:center
[AYAME] And now I must hasten
to prepare for your arrival!

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:02.075 position:50% align:center
Farewell to all!

00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:04.953 position:50% align:center
[AYAME laughing]

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:06.705 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I'm sorry about him.

00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:08.707 position:50% align:center
You don't have to come
if you don't want to.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.709 position:50% align:center
Actually, I'd really
like to tag along

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:12.460 position:50% align:center
if you don't think
I'd be in the way.

00:04:12.544 --> 00:04:13.837 position:50% align:center
No, of course you wouldn't.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.921 position:50% align:center
Wonderful!

00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:16.381 position:50% align:center
I've been dying to
check out his shop

00:04:16.464 --> 00:04:18.049 position:50% align:center
since I first heard about it.

00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:21.052 position:50% align:center
A boutique that sells nurse
uniforms and maid outfits.

00:04:21.136 --> 00:04:24.222 position:50% align:center
I've never been any place
like it, have you?

00:04:24.305 --> 00:04:28.018 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Nurse? Maid? What in the world?

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.282 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] A closed sign?
Is this the right place?

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:07.951 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
It should be.

00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:11.830 position:50% align:center
You know, I'm getting a really
bad feeling about this.

00:06:11.913 --> 00:06:14.582 position:50% align:center
Well, a worse one than
I already had, anyway.

00:06:14.666 --> 00:06:17.794 position:50% align:center
Uh! No, don't worry!
I'm sure it's gonna be fine.

00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:20.255 position:50% align:center
The storefront looks so
lovely, don't you think?

00:06:20.338 --> 00:06:23.633 position:50% align:center
And the sign out front has such
a charming little design, too.

00:06:23.717 --> 00:06:24.676 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Charming?

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:26.886 position:50% align:center
More like terrifyingly
inaccurate.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.389 position:50% align:center
That thing is horrid.

00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:31.349 position:50% align:center
Let's go in.

00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:32.600 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Okay!

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:38.857 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Is this a craft store?

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:44.779 position:50% align:center
[MINE] Sorry, uh, but I'm afraid
we're closed for the day.

00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:45.697 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.240 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:50.535 position:50% align:center
--Are you--?
--[AYAME] Mine!

00:06:50.618 --> 00:06:52.620 position:50% align:center
Could you give me a quick
hand with this hem?

00:06:52.704 --> 00:06:54.748 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:56.166 position:50% align:center
Yuki!

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:57.417 position:50% align:center
[AYAME laughing]

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.003 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I was wrong.
This is the worst.

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:02.005 position:50% align:center
The absolute worst.

00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:04.507 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
Ha! Do forgive me.

00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:07.218 position:50% align:center
You walked in right as I was
adjusting the hem of this dress

00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:08.428 position:50% align:center
for a client of mine.

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:10.305 position:50% align:center
You can use a man's
measurements for that?

00:07:10.388 --> 00:07:11.931 position:50% align:center
What else would I use?

00:07:12.015 --> 00:07:14.267 position:50% align:center
It was a man who
requested this, after all.

00:07:14.351 --> 00:07:16.811 position:50% align:center
But that's... a wedding dress.

00:07:16.895 --> 00:07:18.063 position:50% align:center
Indeed it is.

00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:20.315 position:50% align:center
We all have our private
inner gardens to tend.

00:07:20.398 --> 00:07:22.442 position:50% align:center
Even you must have a
secret or two or three

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:24.027 position:50% align:center
that you'd like to keep hidden.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:27.614 position:50% align:center
I'm confused now.
What exactly do you sell here?

00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:30.867 position:50% align:center
What's there to be confused
about? It's quite simple.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.370 position:50% align:center
We sell materials for the
making of handicrafts,

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:35.163 position:50% align:center
and we also cater to individuals

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:37.624 position:50% align:center
who are in the market for
tailor-made garments.

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:39.668 position:50% align:center
And naturally,
as the proprietor,

00:07:39.751 --> 00:07:42.462 position:50% align:center
I hand-make the requested
clothing personally.

00:07:42.545 --> 00:07:45.965 position:50% align:center
No style is too daunting
for my needle and thread.

00:07:46.049 --> 00:07:47.759 position:50% align:center
My creations are
many and varied.

00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:49.302 position:50% align:center
This is but a small sample.

00:07:49.386 --> 00:07:51.179 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU squeals]

00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:52.806 position:50% align:center
Hatsuharu told me what you sold,

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:55.600 position:50% align:center
but those outfits are even
cuter than I pictured!

00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:57.477 position:50% align:center
You really are amazing, Ayame!

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.689 position:50% align:center
That is so true.
I surprise even myself.

00:08:00.772 --> 00:08:01.940 position:50% align:center
Your turn, Yuki.

00:08:02.023 --> 00:08:03.983 position:50% align:center
I'm ready to hear the
praise you no doubt wish

00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:05.860 position:50% align:center
to heap upon me. Go!

00:08:05.944 --> 00:08:08.571 position:50% align:center
Do you sell normal clothes,
or just that stuff?

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:10.198 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
This is what's popular.

00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:12.325 position:50% align:center
Maid outfits are number one.

00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:13.868 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
They are? Really?

00:08:13.952 --> 00:08:15.286 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
Absolutely!

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.706 position:50% align:center
Perhaps you're too young
and innocent to understand,

00:08:17.789 --> 00:08:22.002 position:50% align:center
but at this shop, we bring
men's fantasies to life!

00:08:22.085 --> 00:08:24.504 position:50% align:center
Maid, nurse,
waitress, secretary,

00:08:24.587 --> 00:08:26.297 position:50% align:center
sailor, cat, or bunny!

00:08:26.381 --> 00:08:28.216 position:50% align:center
There're too many
to name them all,

00:08:28.299 --> 00:08:32.929 position:50% align:center
but men everywhere yearn to see
their dreams made manifest!

00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:35.932 position:50% align:center
Letting your fantasies
run wild every so often,

00:08:36.016 --> 00:08:37.809 position:50% align:center
there's no sin in that.

00:08:37.892 --> 00:08:40.437 position:50% align:center
It's like the compulsion to
peep into the women's bath.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.563 position:50% align:center
A natural drive.

00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:42.897 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
No, that's a crime!

00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:45.108 position:50% align:center
[MINE] It sounds like
you're having fun in here.

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:46.484 position:50% align:center
I wondered if something was up

00:08:46.568 --> 00:08:48.737 position:50% align:center
when you suddenly announced
we'd be closed today.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.031 position:50% align:center
You could've told me your
little brother was coming.

00:08:51.114 --> 00:08:52.532 position:50% align:center
[MINE giggles]

00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:54.951 position:50% align:center
Yep, you look exactly like
a younger version of the boss.

00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:56.161 position:50% align:center
It's nice to meet you.

00:08:56.244 --> 00:08:59.205 position:50% align:center
Welcome to the shop.
My name is Mine Kuramae.

00:08:59.289 --> 00:09:02.334 position:50% align:center
I work for your brother
as his assistant.

00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:05.962 position:50% align:center
Oh. It's nice to
meet you, too. Uh.

00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:09.299 position:50% align:center
Sorry. I was just
noticing your outfit.

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:12.469 position:50% align:center
So that's the employees'
uniform... I guess?

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:14.721 position:50% align:center
This? A uniform?

00:09:14.804 --> 00:09:17.390 position:50% align:center
Nope! I just like wearing it.

00:09:17.474 --> 00:09:18.767 position:50% align:center
Pretty cute, huh?

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:21.102 position:50% align:center
Yes, it's absolutely adorable!

00:09:21.186 --> 00:09:22.645 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:27.150 position:50% align:center
By the way, I've been wondering
ever since you walked in...

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:28.526 position:50% align:center
Who's this young lady?

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:30.945 position:50% align:center
Huh? Oh, uh, hello.
I'm Tohru Honda.

00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:32.155 position:50% align:center
It's so nice to meet you.

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:33.656 position:50% align:center
Tohru- <i>chan</i> !

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.409 position:50% align:center
Have you ever wanted to try
on an outfit like this one?

00:09:36.493 --> 00:09:37.285 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Uhh...

00:09:37.369 --> 00:09:39.537 position:50% align:center
Ah, Mine's at it again.

00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:41.247 position:50% align:center
Uh, at what?

00:09:41.331 --> 00:09:43.166 position:50% align:center
Shall we go and get you changed?

00:09:43.249 --> 00:09:44.793 position:50% align:center
She can't lay eyes
on a pretty girl

00:09:44.876 --> 00:09:46.461 position:50% align:center
without immediately
wanting to dress her up

00:09:46.544 --> 00:09:48.004 position:50% align:center
in one of our ensembles.

00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:49.214 position:50% align:center
[YUKI gasps]

00:09:49.297 --> 00:09:50.924 position:50% align:center
Just a second, Miss
Kuramae. Please wait!

00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:52.175 position:50% align:center
Have a request?

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:54.386 position:50% align:center
She would look wonderful
in any number of things.

00:09:54.469 --> 00:09:55.303 position:50% align:center
Something prim
and proper, maybe?

00:09:55.387 --> 00:09:56.971 position:50% align:center
I'm not so sure about this.

00:09:57.055 --> 00:09:59.766 position:50% align:center
Mine! I think we have just
the outfit for her in the back.

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:00.892 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
What outfit?

00:10:00.975 --> 00:10:02.268 position:50% align:center
You're talkin' about
that, aren't you?

00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:04.646 position:50% align:center
Yes, it'll be absolutely
perfect on her.

00:10:04.729 --> 00:10:07.023 position:50% align:center
Right this way, Tohru- <i>chan</i> !

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:08.400 position:50% align:center
Come back!

00:10:08.483 --> 00:10:11.569 position:50% align:center
Get ready because you're
in for somethin' special!

00:10:11.653 --> 00:10:14.447 position:50% align:center
It was inevitable from the
moment you entered the store.

00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:18.868 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, Mine is quite tame.
She won't do Tohru any harm.

00:10:19.869 --> 00:10:22.163 position:50% align:center
There. The boys can have
some quality time together

00:10:22.247 --> 00:10:24.958 position:50% align:center
now that we're outta the way.

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:26.835 position:50% align:center
A little scheme I cooked up,

00:10:26.918 --> 00:10:28.920 position:50% align:center
but you'll go along
with it won't you?

00:10:29.004 --> 00:10:30.130 position:50% align:center
Of course!

00:10:30.213 --> 00:10:31.256 position:50% align:center
I don't know how long those two

00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:33.008 position:50% align:center
can talk without
fighting, though.

00:10:33.091 --> 00:10:35.552 position:50% align:center
That's fine. Fighting
is a good thing.

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:36.970 position:50% align:center
At least it means
that they acknowledge

00:10:37.053 --> 00:10:38.888 position:50% align:center
each other's presence.

00:10:38.972 --> 00:10:42.350 position:50% align:center
For the boss, indifference
would be worse than anger.

00:10:42.434 --> 00:10:45.145 position:50% align:center
Yes. Much worse.

00:10:45.228 --> 00:10:47.230 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Huh?

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:50.608 position:50% align:center
Uh. Although I would prefer
they not get into a fistfight.

00:10:50.692 --> 00:10:53.028 position:50% align:center
Don't want blood-stained
merchandise, do we?

00:10:53.111 --> 00:10:56.156 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU chuckles nervously]

00:10:56.239 --> 00:10:58.450 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] They fight
because they acknowledge

00:10:58.533 --> 00:11:00.910 position:50% align:center
each other's presence.

00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:04.831 position:50% align:center
Yeah. That might just
be how it works.

00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:08.418 position:50% align:center
Okay, while the brothers are
having their bonding time,

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:10.420 position:50% align:center
we can get to work on you!

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:12.589 position:50% align:center
You mean I really am
gonna try something on?

00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:14.841 position:50% align:center
You most certainly are.

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:18.762 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:11:18.845 --> 00:11:20.930 position:50% align:center
Well, look at that.
It's just the two of us.

00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:22.307 position:50% align:center
It must be a sign from above

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:24.642 position:50% align:center
that we're meant to have
a meaningful interlude.

00:11:24.726 --> 00:11:25.935 position:50% align:center
You're ridiculous.

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:27.395 position:50% align:center
Now, then,

00:11:27.479 --> 00:11:29.481 position:50% align:center
parent-teacher conferences
are coming up, aren't they?

00:11:29.564 --> 00:11:31.816 position:50% align:center
I happened to overhear
that somewhere.

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.026 position:50% align:center
Hold on.

00:11:33.109 --> 00:11:34.527 position:50% align:center
You're not going to
suggest that you come

00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:35.945 position:50% align:center
instead of our parents, are you?

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:37.238 position:50% align:center
Indeed I am!

00:11:37.322 --> 00:11:40.450 position:50% align:center
That was amazing.
Are you secretly telepathic?

00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:43.536 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Who? Who is
responsible for this?

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:47.123 position:50% align:center
An accident, I swear.
A total accident.

00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:48.667 position:50% align:center
So should I bring a gift?

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:51.294 position:50% align:center
What's most appropriate
in these situations?

00:11:51.378 --> 00:11:54.047 position:50% align:center
A lovely bouquet
of roses, perhaps?

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:57.676 position:50% align:center
It's fine. I'll get
our parents to come.

00:11:57.759 --> 00:12:01.054 position:50% align:center
Except, you're not in
contact with them, are you?

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:02.722 position:50% align:center
And the last time I checked,

00:12:02.806 --> 00:12:06.017 position:50% align:center
they weren't exactly
your favorite people.

00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:08.353 position:50% align:center
It's not like I hate them.

00:12:08.436 --> 00:12:12.399 position:50% align:center
Just, these days,
I want nothing from them.

00:12:12.482 --> 00:12:14.776 position:50% align:center
I have no expectations.

00:12:15.944 --> 00:12:17.362 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
How could I?

00:12:17.445 --> 00:12:21.449 position:50% align:center
Those people essentially
sold me to benefit themselves.

00:12:21.533 --> 00:12:23.993 position:50% align:center
They traded my life
to better their own.

00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:26.454 position:50% align:center
Without a thought.

00:12:26.538 --> 00:12:30.291 position:50% align:center
Gave me away like I was
some kind of tool.

00:12:30.375 --> 00:12:34.004 position:50% align:center
And if I invite them
to the conference,

00:12:34.087 --> 00:12:36.172 position:50% align:center
it will give them an opening.

00:12:36.256 --> 00:12:39.926 position:50% align:center
They might try to
control me again.

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:44.723 position:50% align:center
It would be an annoyance.
One I'd rather not deal with.

00:12:44.806 --> 00:12:46.558 position:50% align:center
But nothing more.

00:12:48.059 --> 00:12:52.480 position:50% align:center
[AYAME] The sad fact is,
I'm the same as them.

00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:57.569 position:50% align:center
[AYAME] In exchange for the
chance to live my life freely,

00:12:57.652 --> 00:13:00.238 position:50% align:center
I as good as sold you, too.

00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:06.619 position:50% align:center
[YUKI'S MOTHER]
Yuki! Behave yourself!

00:13:06.703 --> 00:13:10.665 position:50% align:center
Stop being a disobedient
little brat.

00:13:10.749 --> 00:13:13.168 position:50% align:center
Don't make me hit you!

00:13:13.251 --> 00:13:14.711 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
I'm a callous person.

00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:15.837 position:50% align:center
[YUKI'S MOTHER gasps]

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.339 position:50% align:center
Get back here!

00:13:17.422 --> 00:13:18.715 position:50% align:center
Yuki!

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:21.259 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
Insensitive to others' pain.

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:29.768 position:50% align:center
[AYAME] That was the first time
you reached out to me for help.

00:13:29.851 --> 00:13:33.355 position:50% align:center
The first... and the last.

00:13:33.438 --> 00:13:35.648 position:50% align:center
Your hand trembled.

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:41.237 position:50% align:center
[AYAME] And I shook it off
easily. Without a thought.

00:13:44.407 --> 00:13:48.161 position:50% align:center
[MINE]
You seem sad. Are you?

00:13:49.746 --> 00:13:51.456 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
When I was younger,

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:54.834 position:50% align:center
I neither loved Yuki
nor hated him.

00:13:54.918 --> 00:13:58.046 position:50% align:center
I was indifferent
to his existence.

00:13:58.129 --> 00:14:03.176 position:50% align:center
But now, when I imagine him
feeling the same way about me,

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:06.346 position:50% align:center
I'm more afraid than I would
have thought possible.

00:14:07.931 --> 00:14:09.808 position:50% align:center
[AYAME] I know how much
it hurts to be treated

00:14:09.891 --> 00:14:13.144 position:50% align:center
as less than an afterthought.

00:14:13.228 --> 00:14:17.649 position:50% align:center
I understand now,
but it may be too late.

00:14:17.732 --> 00:14:21.820 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Still, running away
won't do any good.

00:14:21.903 --> 00:14:25.031 position:50% align:center
I'll ask them. They'll come.

00:14:25.115 --> 00:14:27.450 position:50% align:center
I haven't decided what I'm
doing after high school yet,

00:14:27.534 --> 00:14:29.244 position:50% align:center
so I'll need to work on that.

00:14:29.327 --> 00:14:30.829 position:50% align:center
I want to have a
clear plan in place

00:14:30.912 --> 00:14:34.708 position:50% align:center
so they don't come armed
with their own suggestions.

00:14:34.791 --> 00:14:40.338 position:50% align:center
Problem is, well, I have
no idea what I want to do.

00:14:40.422 --> 00:14:42.132 position:50% align:center
It's settled then.

00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:44.259 position:50% align:center
I shall graciously take up
the torch and attend

00:14:44.342 --> 00:14:46.469 position:50% align:center
this all-important conference
in our parents' place.

00:14:46.553 --> 00:14:48.179 position:50% align:center
Did you listen to a word I said?

00:14:48.263 --> 00:14:49.806 position:50% align:center
Yuki! Fear not!

00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:52.308 position:50% align:center
For, if I'm there, then
your plans won't matter.

00:14:52.392 --> 00:14:54.269 position:50% align:center
Nonexistent though
they might be.

00:14:54.352 --> 00:14:56.771 position:50% align:center
Everyone can focus
on me instead!

00:14:56.855 --> 00:14:58.565 position:50% align:center
And why would they
want to do that?

00:14:58.648 --> 00:14:59.691 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
I know!

00:14:59.774 --> 00:15:01.443 position:50% align:center
I can tell of the
journey that led me

00:15:01.526 --> 00:15:03.445 position:50% align:center
to this most
romantic profession.

00:15:03.528 --> 00:15:05.864 position:50% align:center
Perhaps I should recount
the tale for you now.

00:15:05.947 --> 00:15:07.323 position:50% align:center
Please don't.

00:15:07.407 --> 00:15:09.034 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
The truth is....

00:15:10.243 --> 00:15:14.998 position:50% align:center
...what I wanted...
was to create something.

00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:19.711 position:50% align:center
For all that I possess, innate
grace and incredible charisma,

00:15:19.794 --> 00:15:24.215 position:50% align:center
even I lack confidence at times.

00:15:24.299 --> 00:15:27.802 position:50% align:center
And that's when the urge to
create is at its strongest.

00:15:30.013 --> 00:15:33.516 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] So many. Did you and
Ayame make all of these?

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.144 position:50% align:center
[MINE] Yep. It was mostly
the boss, though.

00:15:36.227 --> 00:15:37.604 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
That's amazing.

00:15:37.687 --> 00:15:39.272 position:50% align:center
He must really love
making clothing

00:15:39.356 --> 00:15:41.941 position:50% align:center
to have opened a shop like this.

00:15:42.025 --> 00:15:43.860 position:50% align:center
[MINE] He claims that he
could easily have ended up

00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:45.570 position:50% align:center
as a chef or a gardener,

00:15:45.653 --> 00:15:49.866 position:50% align:center
but the dressmaking just
happened to suit him best.

00:15:50.867 --> 00:15:53.161 position:50% align:center
What mattered was
proving to himself

00:15:53.244 --> 00:15:55.372 position:50% align:center
that he had the
ability to create,

00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:58.124 position:50% align:center
regardless of what
it was he made.

00:15:58.208 --> 00:16:00.418 position:50% align:center
That's all he wanted.

00:16:00.502 --> 00:16:03.129 position:50% align:center
I just had to know that
I could make something

00:16:03.213 --> 00:16:05.090 position:50% align:center
with my own hands.

00:16:05.173 --> 00:16:07.717 position:50% align:center
I wanted tangible proof that
I had added to the world

00:16:07.801 --> 00:16:10.220 position:50% align:center
and not merely taken.

00:16:10.303 --> 00:16:12.681 position:50% align:center
There's a certain
comfort in that.

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:15.934 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
It makes me feel needed.

00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:17.352 position:50% align:center
Knowing there's
something out there

00:16:17.435 --> 00:16:21.481 position:50% align:center
that wouldn't exist
if not for me.

00:16:24.275 --> 00:16:25.902 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
Yuki.

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:29.322 position:50% align:center
Just remember that
whatever our parents say,

00:16:29.406 --> 00:16:31.908 position:50% align:center
your own feelings
are what matter.

00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:34.619 position:50% align:center
Those are what should
ultimately guide you.

00:16:34.703 --> 00:16:36.454 position:50% align:center
It'll be okay.

00:16:36.538 --> 00:16:41.001 position:50% align:center
You aren't on your own
in this. No one is.

00:16:41.084 --> 00:16:44.212 position:50% align:center
Even I have someone who's
always there for me.

00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:52.303 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
It'll be okay. I swear.

00:16:52.387 --> 00:16:54.556 position:50% align:center
You are nobody's tool.

00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:57.183 position:50% align:center
And you're not as
alone you think.

00:17:01.062 --> 00:17:02.397 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
So, anyway!

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.606 position:50% align:center
Gure tells me you're going to be

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:05.984 position:50% align:center
the next student
council president.

00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:08.319 position:50% align:center
I can only assume that
such civic mindedness

00:17:08.403 --> 00:17:11.156 position:50% align:center
is the result of my considerable
influence on you.

00:17:11.239 --> 00:17:13.116 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Not even slightly.

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:14.659 position:50% align:center
[AYAME] It's natural
for the younger sibling

00:17:14.743 --> 00:17:16.036 position:50% align:center
to idolize the elder.

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:18.288 position:50% align:center
The real reason I took the job

00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:20.165 position:50% align:center
was because I didn't
want to do it.

00:17:20.248 --> 00:17:21.332 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
Hm?

00:17:21.416 --> 00:17:22.625 position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:17:22.709 --> 00:17:25.295 position:50% align:center
It seems like a rather
perplexing way to behave.

00:17:25.378 --> 00:17:29.466 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I wouldn't expect someone
like you to understand.

00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:31.301 position:50% align:center
Just like I don't
understand this shop

00:17:31.384 --> 00:17:33.386 position:50% align:center
or the things you sell here.

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:35.013 position:50% align:center
Our ways of thinking
about the world

00:17:35.096 --> 00:17:37.182 position:50% align:center
are just so at odds
with each other.

00:17:37.265 --> 00:17:40.352 position:50% align:center
Perhaps... we might be too
fundamentally different

00:17:40.435 --> 00:17:42.145 position:50% align:center
to get along.

00:17:42.228 --> 00:17:44.272 position:50% align:center
Indeed, you may
very well be right.

00:17:44.356 --> 00:17:46.066 position:50% align:center
Then why do you sound so happy?

00:17:46.149 --> 00:17:48.485 position:50% align:center
There's no reason
to be discouraged.

00:17:48.568 --> 00:17:50.028 position:50% align:center
Many obstacles can be overcome

00:17:50.111 --> 00:17:52.072 position:50% align:center
if you're but willing
to make an effort.

00:17:52.155 --> 00:17:54.157 position:50% align:center
You're the one who needs
to make an effort here.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.492 position:50% align:center
Cheeky boy.

00:17:55.575 --> 00:17:57.911 position:50% align:center
Despite what you may think,
I'm a diligent worker.

00:17:57.994 --> 00:18:02.165 position:50% align:center
I don't know what you want
from me. I just don't.

00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:05.543 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
I'm sorry.

00:18:05.627 --> 00:18:06.920 position:50% align:center
You're right.

00:18:07.003 --> 00:18:11.508 position:50% align:center
This does make me happy,
seeing you get so worked up.

00:18:11.591 --> 00:18:15.804 position:50% align:center
You feel something and
you're letting me see it.

00:18:17.222 --> 00:18:20.850 position:50% align:center
[AYAME] So we don't get along.
We're oil and water.

00:18:20.934 --> 00:18:23.228 position:50% align:center
But what does that matter?

00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:26.731 position:50% align:center
See, I was born
having what you lack.

00:18:26.815 --> 00:18:30.694 position:50% align:center
Likewise, you were born
having what I lack.

00:18:30.777 --> 00:18:34.906 position:50% align:center
I think you and I are
foils of one another.

00:18:34.989 --> 00:18:39.661 position:50% align:center
Your kindness and your fragility
are things I cherish.

00:18:40.745 --> 00:18:43.748 position:50% align:center
No doubt... you feel the same
about my noble bearing,

00:18:43.832 --> 00:18:46.334 position:50% align:center
effortless charm, and
unparalleled magnetism.

00:18:46.418 --> 00:18:49.129 position:50% align:center
And honestly, who could
blame you for that?

00:18:49.212 --> 00:18:52.173 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Seriously, why is
he always like this?

00:18:53.258 --> 00:18:54.759 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Is it because...?

00:18:54.843 --> 00:18:58.221 position:50% align:center
Coming in, Boss. We're not
interrupting, are we?

00:18:58.304 --> 00:19:00.890 position:50% align:center
Oh, good! Is she
ready for her debut?

00:19:00.974 --> 00:19:02.976 position:50% align:center
Come in, my dear.
No need to be shy.

00:19:03.059 --> 00:19:04.894 position:50% align:center
You heard the man, Tohru- <i>chan</i> !

00:19:04.978 --> 00:19:07.480 position:50% align:center
Let's not keep our
audience waiting!

00:19:10.608 --> 00:19:14.654 position:50% align:center
Um. Is it okay?

00:19:14.738 --> 00:19:16.197 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
<i>Tres bien!</i>

00:19:16.281 --> 00:19:17.782 position:50% align:center
So very "Tohru."

00:19:17.866 --> 00:19:19.534 position:50% align:center
All that's missing is
a fluffy little dog

00:19:19.617 --> 00:19:21.327 position:50% align:center
and a white-laced parasol.

00:19:21.411 --> 00:19:22.746 position:50% align:center
[MINE]
Mh-hm!

00:19:22.829 --> 00:19:25.331 position:50% align:center
I can see her sipping tea
in an elegant drawing room

00:19:25.415 --> 00:19:27.042 position:50% align:center
while reading old poetry.

00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:29.169 position:50% align:center
Well, Yuki, aren't you
going to tell Tohru

00:19:29.252 --> 00:19:30.754 position:50% align:center
how lovely she looks?

00:19:30.837 --> 00:19:31.671 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Uh.

00:19:31.755 --> 00:19:33.298 position:50% align:center
Nothing? How rude.

00:19:33.381 --> 00:19:34.632 position:50% align:center
She got dressed up for you

00:19:34.716 --> 00:19:37.469 position:50% align:center
and yet you spinelessly
refuse to compliment her?

00:19:37.552 --> 00:19:39.596 position:50% align:center
Then I suppose it's up to me.

00:19:39.679 --> 00:19:41.348 position:50% align:center
But I won't use words.

00:19:41.431 --> 00:19:42.599 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU gasps]

00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:43.892 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Back off!

00:19:43.975 --> 00:19:45.226 position:50% align:center
[AYAME laughs]

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:46.811 position:50% align:center
He struck his own brother!

00:19:46.895 --> 00:19:49.689 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I'm surprised
he didn't hit you harder.

00:19:49.773 --> 00:19:51.024 position:50% align:center
I should.

00:19:51.107 --> 00:19:53.526 position:50% align:center
Nevertheless, I must
applaud your efforts, Mine.

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:56.196 position:50% align:center
I think you captured
Tohru's essence perfectly.

00:19:56.279 --> 00:19:59.282 position:50% align:center
Thank you! You honor
me with your praise.

00:19:59.366 --> 00:20:01.701 position:50% align:center
So, Boss, were you and
your brother able to have

00:20:01.785 --> 00:20:04.371 position:50% align:center
a good conversation
while we were gone?

00:20:04.454 --> 00:20:07.707 position:50% align:center
We did talk, and at
some length, too.

00:20:07.791 --> 00:20:11.378 position:50% align:center
[sighs] I had fun, but I'm
afraid that, once again,

00:20:11.461 --> 00:20:15.548 position:50% align:center
I'm the only one who enjoyed
our time together.

00:20:15.632 --> 00:20:16.925 position:50% align:center
After today,

00:20:17.008 --> 00:20:20.136 position:50% align:center
I think I understand a little
more about my brother.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:21.304 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:20:21.388 --> 00:20:23.807 position:50% align:center
He's a caricature of a person.

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:27.727 position:50% align:center
Everything he says and
does is overly dramatic.

00:20:27.811 --> 00:20:31.272 position:50% align:center
But I'm starting to realize
I just need to accept that.

00:20:31.356 --> 00:20:33.525 position:50% align:center
There's no other way
to deal with him.

00:20:33.608 --> 00:20:35.318 position:50% align:center
If I get sucked
into his headspace,

00:20:35.402 --> 00:20:38.571 position:50% align:center
I'll end up exhausted.

00:20:38.655 --> 00:20:42.283 position:50% align:center
It's kind of depressing
now that I say it out loud.

00:20:42.367 --> 00:20:44.703 position:50% align:center
Yeah... Heh.

00:20:44.786 --> 00:20:48.998 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] But... I'm still
glad that I came.

00:20:50.667 --> 00:20:54.921 position:50% align:center
And... he was right.

00:20:55.005 --> 00:20:58.508 position:50% align:center
You do look very
cute in that dress.

00:20:58.591 --> 00:21:01.302 position:50% align:center
Me? Oh, no, I don't, really!

00:21:01.386 --> 00:21:03.096 position:50% align:center
This is just-- I mean.

00:21:03.179 --> 00:21:05.557 position:50% align:center
[whimpering]

00:21:06.558 --> 00:21:08.601 position:50% align:center
Don't hide your face.

00:21:11.438 --> 00:21:13.023 position:50% align:center
Fantasy.

00:21:13.106 --> 00:21:14.607 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:21:14.691 --> 00:21:16.651 position:50% align:center
The feeling that's stirring in
your soul at this very moment.

00:21:16.735 --> 00:21:18.737 position:50% align:center
It's your first brush
with fantasy!

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:21.448 position:50% align:center
A single garment is all it
takes to sway a man's heart

00:21:21.531 --> 00:21:23.324 position:50% align:center
into the path of romance.

00:21:23.408 --> 00:21:26.244 position:50% align:center
Don't be embarrassed.
I understand completely!

00:21:26.327 --> 00:21:29.706 position:50% align:center
And I hereby dub this occasion:
"Yuki's First Awakening"!

00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:31.458 position:50% align:center
Cut it out!

00:21:31.541 --> 00:21:34.002 position:50% align:center
[AYAME] Such a joyous moment
calls for a celebration!

00:21:34.085 --> 00:21:35.837 position:50% align:center
I'll make preparations
immediately.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.088 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
No! No celebrations...

00:21:37.172 --> 00:21:39.049 position:50% align:center
It looks like they did
end up fighting, huh?

00:21:39.132 --> 00:21:41.509 position:50% align:center
Shall we watch over them
until they're done?

00:21:41.593 --> 00:21:42.927 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
...besides yourself for once?

00:21:43.011 --> 00:21:45.055 position:50% align:center
[AYAME] I must report this
to Gure and Tori at once!

00:21:45.138 --> 00:21:46.931 position:50% align:center
It is a day to be
remembered, after all.

00:21:47.015 --> 00:21:48.308 position:50% align:center
I'm sure they wouldn't
want to be left out...

00:21:48.391 --> 00:21:49.476 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Put the phone down! You don't...

00:21:49.559 --> 00:21:51.019 position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:21:51.102 --> 00:21:53.521 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Especially not something
as utterly ridiculous as this!

00:21:53.605 --> 00:21:55.398 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
It'll be okay.

00:21:57.025 --> 00:22:00.153 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
You're a person, not a tool.

00:22:01.654 --> 00:22:03.740 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
And you aren't alone.

00:22:06.785 --> 00:22:08.912 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
Not anymore.

00:22:08.995 --> 00:22:10.205 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
Then do you know what happened?

00:22:10.288 --> 00:22:11.498 position:50% align:center
I'll tell you!

00:22:11.581 --> 00:22:13.833 position:50% align:center
Yuki gazed upon Tohru
in that cute dress

00:22:13.917 --> 00:22:15.919 position:50% align:center
and thus experienced
his first awakening!

00:22:16.002 --> 00:22:17.253 position:50% align:center
Hold on, Tori!

00:22:17.337 --> 00:22:19.839 position:50% align:center
Did you imagine Tohru
in that dress just now?
