[KAGURA]
Isuzu?

00:00:13.555 --> 00:00:16.433 position:50% align:center
Are you going somewhere?
I thought we could hang out.

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:18.893 position:50% align:center
Oh, I know! The vacation house.

00:00:18.977 --> 00:00:20.812 position:50% align:center
That's where everybody
is right now.

00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:23.273 position:50% align:center
Yun- <i>chan</i> is there.
And Shii- <i>chan</i> .

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:24.649 position:50% align:center
Haru- <i>chan</i> , too.

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:28.153 position:50% align:center
And most importantly
of all, my sweet Kyo!

00:00:28.236 --> 00:00:30.071 position:50% align:center
Plus, if you go, you'll finally
have the chance to meet Tohru.

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:31.656 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Kagura.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.451 position:50% align:center
How much longer are you going
to go around playing at love?

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:36.536 position:50% align:center
It makes me cringe.

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:41.791 position:50% align:center
Playing? Why would
you say that?

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:43.543 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Because.

00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:46.379 position:50% align:center
It's true, isn't it?

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:49.507 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA]
Isuzu! Hey, come back!

00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:50.800 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:53.053 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA'S MOTHER]
What's wrong? More fighting?

00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:55.180 position:50% align:center
She's been staying
with us for a while now,

00:00:55.263 --> 00:00:57.766 position:50% align:center
but she doesn't seem to
have warmed up at all.

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:59.225 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.977 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA'S MOTHER]
Oh, by the way,

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:03.188 position:50% align:center
I heard you mention
the vacation house,

00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:04.898 position:50% align:center
but I don't think you should go.

00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:06.691 position:50% align:center
The family head went
out there yesterday.

00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:07.776 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:09.319 position:50% align:center
It's hard not to be worried.

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:12.489 position:50% align:center
If you were injured like
Kisa was, I'd lose it.

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:15.367 position:50% align:center
Let's keep that between
us, though, okay?

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.077 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA]
Hey, hold on a sec.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.913 position:50% align:center
Akito is there? What do
you think that's about?

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:22.540 position:50% align:center
Who knows? R and R, maybe?

00:01:22.624 --> 00:01:24.876 position:50% align:center
Apparently, it was
all Shigure's idea.

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:26.294 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:26.378 --> 00:01:29.839 position:50% align:center
Really? Shii- <i>chan</i> did this?

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:31.841 position:50% align:center
That bastard!

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:33.343 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA'S MOTHER]
Kagura, it's only been a month

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:35.762 position:50% align:center
since the last time
you wrecked the door.

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:10.774 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I swear.

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:14.194 position:50% align:center
I'll keep trying. Fighting.

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:17.739 position:50% align:center
And believing...
that there's hope.

00:03:20.658 --> 00:03:22.285 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
That was it.

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:25.121 position:50% align:center
Yuki didn't say anything else.

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:27.082 position:50% align:center
We headed back to
the house together,

00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:29.084 position:50% align:center
and ate pancakes
with the others,

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:33.880 position:50% align:center
who'd returned from the annex
while we were outside.

00:03:33.963 --> 00:03:36.633 position:50% align:center
Everyone seemed to be
having a good time.

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:39.135 position:50% align:center
Yuki was even smiling.

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:43.306 position:50% align:center
Still, I kept thinking
about what he said.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.601 position:50% align:center
And... what he didn't.

00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:50.105 position:50% align:center
The silent voice that dripped
words like raindrops--

00:03:50.188 --> 00:03:55.610 position:50% align:center
too soft to hear...
but definitely there.

00:03:55.694 --> 00:03:57.612 position:50% align:center
If I could just...

00:03:57.696 --> 00:04:00.031 position:50% align:center
[HATORI]
Honda? You all right?

00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:01.408 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:03.243 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh, Hatori! I--

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:05.578 position:50% align:center
[HATORI] What's wrong?
Do you have a headache?

00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:08.123 position:50% align:center
No! I mean, thank you for
asking, but my head is fine.

00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:10.542 position:50% align:center
I was thinking, and then, um,
suddenly you were there,

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:12.627 position:50% align:center
and, well, I wasn't
expecting you, so...

00:04:12.711 --> 00:04:15.088 position:50% align:center
I came out here with
Akito yesterday.

00:04:15.171 --> 00:04:17.382 position:50% align:center
This is the first chance
I've had to stop by.

00:04:17.465 --> 00:04:19.551 position:50% align:center
You're staying at
the annex, too?

00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:21.302 position:50% align:center
[HATORI]
I'm sorry.

00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:23.638 position:50% align:center
This should be a fun vacation
with your friends,

00:04:23.722 --> 00:04:25.265 position:50% align:center
and instead, you're on your own.

00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:26.975 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Please, you don't
need to apologize!

00:04:27.058 --> 00:04:28.476 position:50% align:center
I am having fun.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.145 position:50% align:center
Kyo's here, so I'm not alone,
and with the others gone,

00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:31.563 position:50% align:center
I've got plenty of
time to cook and...

00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:34.232 position:50% align:center
Jeez, take a breath.

00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:36.776 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] The house is pretty
empty again today.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.279 position:50% align:center
The others all went
back to Akito's place,

00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:43.491 position:50% align:center
while Kyo and I stayed
behind like before.

00:04:43.575 --> 00:04:45.160 position:50% align:center
Still, I don't understand

00:04:45.243 --> 00:04:48.788 position:50% align:center
why Hatori feels like he
needs to apologize to me.

00:04:48.872 --> 00:04:50.582 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU gasps]

00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:53.501 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Maybe he's worried
that Kyo and I feel left out

00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:56.171 position:50% align:center
since everyone else
was asked to go.

00:04:56.254 --> 00:05:00.133 position:50% align:center
I wonder if the rest of
them are worried, too.

00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:02.510 position:50% align:center
I could be reading
too much into it,

00:05:02.594 --> 00:05:08.600 position:50% align:center
but the idea that they
care... makes me happy.

00:05:08.683 --> 00:05:11.144 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Thank you for coming to visit.

00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:13.855 position:50% align:center
And there's no need to
worry about me, really.

00:05:13.938 --> 00:05:16.733 position:50% align:center
I'm just glad I got to be here.

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:20.487 position:50% align:center
I'll be going, then.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.197 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Uh?

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.201 position:50% align:center
Kyo, try to be good company.

00:05:26.284 --> 00:05:29.496 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] I wonder if I'll see
Akito at all while we're here.

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:32.582 position:50% align:center
So far, it sure
doesn't seem like it.

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:35.126 position:50% align:center
Yes, thanks to Akito.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.336 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] What could they
have talked about

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:37.837 position:50% align:center
to make Yuki react like that?

00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:39.339 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Hey.

00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:42.634 position:50% align:center
Not gettin' sick, are you?
You're even spacier than usual.

00:05:42.717 --> 00:05:44.427 position:50% align:center
Uh. I feel fine.

00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:46.513 position:50% align:center
I was just thinking about
something, that's all.

00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:48.056 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Hm?

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:49.349 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Uh! Oh, no!

00:05:49.432 --> 00:05:53.144 position:50% align:center
If I'm not careful,
I'll make him worry, too.

00:05:53.228 --> 00:05:55.105 position:50% align:center
I was thinking that
maybe we could

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:56.398 position:50% align:center
go down to the beach today.

00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:57.440 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Huh?

00:05:57.524 --> 00:05:59.484 position:50% align:center
We don't have to
swim or anything.

00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:01.861 position:50% align:center
We can just play in the sand.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.116 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
People actually do that?

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:09.661 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Sure! It'll be fun, you'll see.

00:06:09.744 --> 00:06:11.621 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
What are you doing out here?

00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:14.290 position:50% align:center
I thought for sure
you'd be with Akito.

00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:15.917 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
It's Haru's turn today.

00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:19.587 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] Well, then,
that gives us a chance to chat.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.633 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
So tell me,

00:06:23.717 --> 00:06:27.804 position:50% align:center
what did Akito have to say to
you when you talked yesterday?

00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:34.978 position:50% align:center
The truth, that's all.

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:38.314 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
You satisfied?

00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:42.694 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
No.

00:06:42.777 --> 00:06:47.032 position:50% align:center
I'm really not.
Far from it, in fact.

00:06:50.994 --> 00:06:53.288 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Is it true Kureno's here?

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:55.874 position:50% align:center
[AKITO] I won't let him see
you, so what's it matter?

00:06:55.957 --> 00:06:58.626 position:50% align:center
Then how about Honda?

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.212 position:50% align:center
[AKITO] What does she have
to do with anything?

00:07:01.296 --> 00:07:04.257 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU] Kureno's part
of the zodiac, too.

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:07.635 position:50% align:center
[AKITO] Is there some rule
that she has to meet

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:09.429 position:50% align:center
every member of the zodiac?

00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:14.059 position:50% align:center
She's met so many. It just
feels unnatural to exclude him.

00:07:14.142 --> 00:07:16.186 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Unnatural?

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:19.189 position:50% align:center
Is that how it seems
to you? Really?

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:24.527 position:50% align:center
Heh. You always say the most
amusing things, Hatsuharu.

00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:27.864 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Now I'm curious.

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:31.201 position:50% align:center
Is there anything else
you find unnatural?

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:32.577 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
No.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.955 position:50% align:center
And please stop. I don't
like being laughed at.

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:39.125 position:50% align:center
But you're so endlessly
entertaining.

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:43.838 position:50% align:center
Who <i>wouldn't</i> laugh
at the stupid Ox?

00:07:43.922 --> 00:07:50.428 position:50% align:center
Oh, dear, was that too mean?
Did I hurt your feelings?

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:56.685 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
So... what is that?

00:07:56.768 --> 00:07:58.728 position:50% align:center
A sandcastle, silly!

00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:01.189 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah? 'Cause I was
gonna go with "sand igloo."

00:08:01.272 --> 00:08:03.775 position:50% align:center
Oh, really? It's that bad?

00:08:03.858 --> 00:08:06.194 position:50% align:center
[KYO] Well, it's not like
I've ever made one before,

00:08:06.277 --> 00:08:07.987 position:50% align:center
so what do I know?

00:08:08.071 --> 00:08:11.241 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Wait, this is your first
time building a sandcastle?

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:13.243 position:50% align:center
Huh? Well, yeah.

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:15.787 position:50% align:center
That makes me your
sandcastle <i>senpai</i> !

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:19.582 position:50% align:center
Well, Senpai, you
really suck at this.

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:22.711 position:50% align:center
Tohru!

00:08:22.794 --> 00:08:24.462 position:50% align:center
We're back! We're back!
We're back! We're back!

00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:26.881 position:50% align:center
You scared me.
That happens a lot.

00:08:26.965 --> 00:08:28.633 position:50% align:center
You're such a pain, Momiji.

00:08:28.717 --> 00:08:29.718 position:50% align:center
Tohru!

00:08:29.801 --> 00:08:31.511 position:50% align:center
You really wanna
spend your vacation

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:32.929 position:50% align:center
doing something this lame?

00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:35.181 position:50% align:center
Hey! I'm glad
you're all back!

00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:36.933 position:50% align:center
Uh. Yuki.

00:08:37.017 --> 00:08:39.227 position:50% align:center
You must be pretty
worn out, huh?

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:42.814 position:50% align:center
Nah. I'm fine,
but what about you?

00:08:42.897 --> 00:08:44.399 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:08:44.482 --> 00:08:47.235 position:50% align:center
I should've known you'd be more
worried about me than yourself.

00:08:47.318 --> 00:08:48.486 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Ta-da!

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:51.865 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] But this time,
I'm actually all right.

00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:53.742 position:50% align:center
Leaving the nest.

00:08:53.825 --> 00:08:55.744 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI laughs]

00:08:55.827 --> 00:08:57.746 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Oh, man, Haru.

00:08:57.829 --> 00:09:01.666 position:50% align:center
I can't tell if you say that
knowing what it means or not.

00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:05.545 position:50% align:center
Yep. That's what I like to hear.

00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:07.589 position:50% align:center
Uh. What is?

00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:09.007 position:50% align:center
Ah, never mind.

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:10.592 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:09:10.675 --> 00:09:12.635 position:50% align:center
Um, I'm glad you're back.

00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:15.430 position:50% align:center
So am I. Have you been out
here this entire time?

00:09:15.513 --> 00:09:16.973 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah.

00:09:17.057 --> 00:09:19.434 position:50% align:center
I thought it would be fun if
Kyo and I built a sandcastle.

00:09:19.517 --> 00:09:24.647 position:50% align:center
So, um, that's what that is.
I was guessing a sand igloo?

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:26.232 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU gasps]

00:09:26.316 --> 00:09:30.070 position:50% align:center
Kyo said the same thing, so I
must've done something wrong!

00:09:30.153 --> 00:09:37.077 position:50% align:center
Sorry. Yesterday... what
I said, it was... a lot.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.497 position:50% align:center
I should've known
it would upset you.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:45.251 position:50% align:center
I was just babbling
nonsense. Again.

00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:47.545 position:50% align:center
That said...

00:09:47.629 --> 00:09:52.050 position:50% align:center
When it comes to the kiss,
I'm not sorry.

00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:53.968 position:50% align:center
There was nothing
wrong about that.

00:09:54.052 --> 00:09:56.721 position:50% align:center
Not to me, at least.

00:09:56.805 --> 00:10:00.100 position:50% align:center
Even so, you can forget
about it if you want.

00:10:00.183 --> 00:10:04.979 position:50% align:center
No! I mean, how
could I forget that?

00:10:05.063 --> 00:10:08.024 position:50% align:center
And what you said,
it wasn't nonsense.

00:10:08.108 --> 00:10:09.526 position:50% align:center
Not at all.

00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:13.655 position:50% align:center
I could tell it was hard to
say, but you still said it.

00:10:13.738 --> 00:10:16.574 position:50% align:center
And it was important
to you, wasn't it?

00:10:16.658 --> 00:10:19.411 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
But you spoke so quietly.

00:10:19.494 --> 00:10:27.127 position:50% align:center
In that silent, raindrop voice--
the one I couldn't hear.

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:30.797 position:50% align:center
No matter how much
I strained to listen.

00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:34.592 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
The thing about the truth is,

00:10:34.676 --> 00:10:38.805 position:50% align:center
you need to wait for the
right moment to tell it.

00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:44.686 position:50% align:center
But... one day... I promise.

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:50.817 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] For now, I can
tell you this much.

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.530 position:50% align:center
You don't need to worry
about me, okay?

00:10:55.613 --> 00:10:59.117 position:50% align:center
Um, right. I understand.
Sounds good.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.578 position:50% align:center
Tohru! Yuki!

00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:02.662 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU gasps]

00:11:02.746 --> 00:11:04.998 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
It felt like he was teasing me.

00:11:05.081 --> 00:11:06.583 position:50% align:center
Whatever's going on,

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:09.419 position:50% align:center
it's making Yuki a lot bolder
than he used to be.

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:10.920 position:50% align:center
Look, Tohru, a sand ball!

00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:13.757 position:50% align:center
Hey, Yuki, let's go
back to the house.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.258 position:50% align:center
I'm getting hungry.

00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:17.635 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Okay.

00:11:17.719 --> 00:11:18.887 position:50% align:center
[KYO gasps]

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:22.640 position:50% align:center
Listen, if you do see
Akito while we're here,

00:11:22.724 --> 00:11:25.435 position:50% align:center
don't lash out like an idiot.

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:27.145 position:50% align:center
I couldn't care less
how many insults

00:11:27.228 --> 00:11:30.565 position:50% align:center
you have to put up with,
you will control yourself.

00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:34.235 position:50% align:center
Because if you don't, it could
make trouble for Miss Honda.

00:11:34.319 --> 00:11:37.364 position:50% align:center
[KYO] Oh, shut up. I don't
wanna listen to this from you!

00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:38.948 position:50% align:center
You're so arrogant!

00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:41.743 position:50% align:center
Think you're better
than me?! Huh?!

00:11:42.827 --> 00:11:44.746 position:50% align:center
Yes, I do.

00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:48.416 position:50% align:center
[growls]

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:49.626 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
I'll kill you!

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:51.044 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Um, you guys, please!

00:11:51.127 --> 00:11:52.462 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
Yuki's so cool.

00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:55.340 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Like hell he is!

00:11:55.423 --> 00:12:00.845 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] For now at least,
that voice is still silent.

00:12:00.929 --> 00:12:03.348 position:50% align:center
But I'll hear it someday.

00:12:04.933 --> 00:12:06.851 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Hey, Kureno.

00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:11.272 position:50% align:center
Would you like to meet
her? Tohru Honda?

00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:31.209 position:50% align:center
[HATORI] Any idea where Akito
and Kureno are off to?

00:12:31.292 --> 00:12:33.628 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Taking a little walk.

00:12:33.712 --> 00:12:35.213 position:50% align:center
To see Honda, you think?

00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:37.841 position:50% align:center
I suppose that is a possibility.

00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:39.592 position:50% align:center
When it comes to Tohru,

00:12:39.676 --> 00:12:43.013 position:50% align:center
Akito has clearly got
a superiority complex.

00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:44.848 position:50% align:center
The girl is a threat.

00:12:44.931 --> 00:12:49.185 position:50% align:center
Why else keep us locked away,
stuck in one-on-one meetings?

00:12:51.646 --> 00:12:54.024 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Really, she's an outsider.

00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:56.901 position:50% align:center
It only makes sense
to isolate her.

00:12:56.985 --> 00:12:58.111 position:50% align:center
Besides, who would want

00:12:58.194 --> 00:13:00.905 position:50% align:center
an ugly little thing
like her around anyway?

00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:03.450 position:50% align:center
Maybe I should just
get rid of her.

00:13:03.533 --> 00:13:07.454 position:50% align:center
I would do it, but I'm
such a gentle soul.

00:13:07.537 --> 00:13:09.164 position:50% align:center
I can afford to be generous.

00:13:09.247 --> 00:13:12.709 position:50% align:center
Let the poor wretch get some
enjoyment from this vacation.

00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:16.171 position:50% align:center
I've even been thinking that
I might allow her to meet you.

00:13:16.254 --> 00:13:17.297 position:50% align:center
Soon.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:18.882 position:50% align:center
But you'll need to behave

00:13:18.965 --> 00:13:22.177 position:50% align:center
and act like you're still a
proper member of the zodiac,

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.472 position:50% align:center
instead of the inferior
creature that you've become.

00:13:25.555 --> 00:13:27.182 position:50% align:center
Afterwards, she'll
be alone again,

00:13:27.265 --> 00:13:30.727 position:50% align:center
separated from the fools she
dares to think of as friends.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.437 position:50% align:center
And she'll stay that way.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.523 position:50% align:center
Lonely and isolated for
as long as she's here.

00:13:35.607 --> 00:13:37.901 position:50% align:center
She'll see she can
never beat me.

00:13:37.984 --> 00:13:40.653 position:50% align:center
She's hopelessly out of
her league in this fight.

00:13:40.737 --> 00:13:45.492 position:50% align:center
She's not alone, though.
Kyo stayed behind, too, right?

00:13:50.205 --> 00:13:54.167 position:50% align:center
How could she possibly be
having fun with that monster?

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:55.585 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Tohru.

00:13:55.669 --> 00:13:57.462 position:50% align:center
Yes?

00:13:57.545 --> 00:13:58.672 position:50% align:center
New friend.

00:13:58.755 --> 00:14:01.966 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Ah! What a cute
little hermit crab!

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.886 position:50% align:center
I don't really know if I would
call that thing a castle,

00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:07.055 position:50% align:center
but it does look better
than the last one.

00:14:07.138 --> 00:14:08.431 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:14:08.515 --> 00:14:10.558 position:50% align:center
You do know you can go swimming
if you want to, right?

00:14:10.642 --> 00:14:12.811 position:50% align:center
No need to miss out on it
just 'cause of me.

00:14:12.894 --> 00:14:15.188 position:50% align:center
I don't think I'm
missing out on anything.

00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:18.608 position:50% align:center
It's more fun
when we're together.

00:14:18.692 --> 00:14:20.735 position:50% align:center
And... think!

00:14:20.819 --> 00:14:23.363 position:50% align:center
If I can make an awesome castle
that's totally realistic,

00:14:23.446 --> 00:14:25.073 position:50% align:center
everyone'll be so surprised.

00:14:25.156 --> 00:14:28.576 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you might be dreaming
a little big, there.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.745 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] You know, I don't
think I've ever met anyone

00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:33.039 position:50% align:center
who dislikes the water
as much as you do.

00:14:33.123 --> 00:14:37.085 position:50% align:center
Apparently the Cat spirit
hates water just like all cats.

00:14:38.128 --> 00:14:41.464 position:50% align:center
I heard the previous Cat wasn't
a fan of water, either.

00:14:41.548 --> 00:14:47.053 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] He's talking about...
Master Kazuma's grandfather.

00:14:47.137 --> 00:14:48.888 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
What about that bracelet?

00:14:48.972 --> 00:14:51.182 position:50% align:center
Did the previous Cat
wear it, too?

00:14:51.266 --> 00:14:52.642 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Yeah.

00:14:52.726 --> 00:14:56.730 position:50% align:center
It looks pretty unusual.
Any idea what it's made from?

00:14:56.813 --> 00:15:01.526 position:50% align:center
Human bone. From some
great monk or whatever.

00:15:01.609 --> 00:15:05.697 position:50% align:center
This was a long time ago,
hundreds of years maybe.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:09.617 position:50% align:center
They say the red ones were
lacquered with blood.

00:15:09.701 --> 00:15:11.661 position:50% align:center
I don't know how much is true,

00:15:11.745 --> 00:15:16.041 position:50% align:center
but legend has it that at least
one life had to be sacrificed

00:15:16.124 --> 00:15:19.544 position:50% align:center
to give the amulet its power.

00:15:19.627 --> 00:15:23.673 position:50% align:center
I've hated that thought
since I was a little kid.

00:15:23.757 --> 00:15:26.551 position:50% align:center
It seemed wrong to me.

00:15:26.634 --> 00:15:30.263 position:50% align:center
Is my existence worth
that kind of sacrifice?

00:15:30.347 --> 00:15:33.350 position:50% align:center
Worth more than another
person's life?

00:15:33.433 --> 00:15:36.269 position:50% align:center
I have this because
someone else was trampled,

00:15:36.353 --> 00:15:39.856 position:50% align:center
because they had everything
taken from them.

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:41.566 position:50% align:center
But still...

00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:01.544 position:50% align:center
That wave came out of nowhere!

00:16:01.628 --> 00:16:04.839 position:50% align:center
I thought it was
gonna drag us in!

00:16:04.923 --> 00:16:06.424 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Damn ocean!

00:16:06.508 --> 00:16:10.512 position:50% align:center
Don't mess with me, bastard!
I'll kill you for that!

00:16:10.595 --> 00:16:12.806 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:14.599 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Sorry, Kyo,

00:16:14.683 --> 00:16:17.185 position:50% align:center
but I'm pretty sure the
ocean could beat you.

00:16:17.268 --> 00:16:20.522 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU laughing]

00:16:20.605 --> 00:16:22.899 position:50% align:center
Quit laughin', will ya?

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:25.360 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Sorry.

00:16:25.443 --> 00:16:27.862 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Looking at that creature now,

00:16:27.946 --> 00:16:30.573 position:50% align:center
you'd never guess
it killed its mother.

00:16:30.657 --> 00:16:33.284 position:50% align:center
Oh, no! The ocean
must've taken them!

00:16:33.368 --> 00:16:35.370 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Let's go back. It's too hot.

00:16:35.453 --> 00:16:37.414 position:50% align:center
I don't feel well.

00:16:37.497 --> 00:16:39.457 position:50% align:center
But I can see now

00:16:39.541 --> 00:16:45.463 position:50% align:center
that the most deluded one
here... is that monster.

00:16:49.551 --> 00:16:53.096 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] They didn't talk to her.
This time, at least.

00:16:53.179 --> 00:16:54.723 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:00.311 --> 00:17:01.438 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
All done.

00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:03.064 position:50% align:center
Thanks for letting me
take the first bath.

00:17:03.148 --> 00:17:05.066 position:50% align:center
It feels really nice
to be clean.

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:06.901 position:50% align:center
So, bathroom's free, then?

00:17:06.985 --> 00:17:07.986 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:09.029 position:50% align:center
And while you're doing that,

00:17:09.112 --> 00:17:10.697 position:50% align:center
I can start bringing
the laundry in.

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:12.240 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Mhm.

00:17:13.825 --> 00:17:17.746 position:50% align:center
[KYO] Is my existence worth
that kind of sacrifice?

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:20.915 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Wearing that every
day must weigh on him.

00:17:20.999 --> 00:17:22.500 position:50% align:center
He can't take it off,

00:17:22.584 --> 00:17:25.503 position:50% align:center
but he can't forget
its history, either.

00:17:28.423 --> 00:17:31.051 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Kyo's got a silent voice, too.

00:17:31.134 --> 00:17:35.638 position:50% align:center
One I can't hear,
no matter how hard I try.

00:17:35.722 --> 00:17:39.601 position:50% align:center
But I guess...
I've got one of my own.

00:17:39.684 --> 00:17:42.479 position:50% align:center
A voice I don't want
anyone to hear.

00:17:44.731 --> 00:17:46.107 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU gasps]

00:17:46.191 --> 00:17:48.151 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Wait! Please come back!

00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:50.570 position:50% align:center
I still need to fold you!

00:17:52.989 --> 00:17:55.867 position:50% align:center
Well, there's one
at least. That's--

00:18:01.456 --> 00:18:02.290 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU gasps]

00:18:02.374 --> 00:18:04.000 position:50% align:center
A horse!

00:18:06.753 --> 00:18:09.506 position:50% align:center
What's a horse doing out here?

00:18:10.632 --> 00:18:11.424 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU gasps]

00:18:11.508 --> 00:18:12.509 position:50% align:center
Then you must be...

00:18:12.592 --> 00:18:13.718 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Rin!

00:18:13.802 --> 00:18:15.261 position:50% align:center
So, it was you then.

00:18:15.345 --> 00:18:17.430 position:50% align:center
You know who this is?

00:18:17.514 --> 00:18:18.682 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I thought I saw her.

00:18:18.765 --> 00:18:21.601 position:50% align:center
Glad I decided to follow
and make sure.

00:18:21.685 --> 00:18:25.271 position:50% align:center
This is Rin, or Isuzu Soma.

00:18:25.355 --> 00:18:26.606 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Isuzu.

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:29.109 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I'm sure you figured
out she's the Horse.

00:18:29.192 --> 00:18:31.903 position:50% align:center
But what are you doing
transformed out here like this?

00:18:31.986 --> 00:18:33.363 position:50% align:center
Not feeling well?

00:18:33.446 --> 00:18:36.032 position:50% align:center
Oh, if she's sick, then maybe
we should go get Hatori.

00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:43.873 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Rin, do you realize how
badly you could have hurt her?

00:18:43.957 --> 00:18:45.667 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Don't get him!

00:18:47.585 --> 00:18:50.130 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Don't... get anyone!

00:18:58.471 --> 00:19:01.307 position:50% align:center
Oh, right. No clothing!
Here, you can use this!

00:19:01.391 --> 00:19:03.101 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] She turned back
through sheer stubbornness?

00:19:03.184 --> 00:19:04.519 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
So, um,

00:19:04.602 --> 00:19:06.730 position:50% align:center
I'll go get some of my clothes
for her to wear, okay?

00:19:06.813 --> 00:19:08.189 position:50% align:center
Thanks.

00:19:11.985 --> 00:19:15.113 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Hey, take it easy.

00:19:15.196 --> 00:19:17.073 position:50% align:center
You're still weak.

00:19:18.575 --> 00:19:20.452 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Well, that was a surprise.

00:19:20.535 --> 00:19:22.454 position:50% align:center
I didn't expect to meet
a new zodiac member

00:19:22.537 --> 00:19:25.790 position:50% align:center
while I was doing the laundry.

00:19:25.874 --> 00:19:30.628 position:50% align:center
So that's the Soma with the
Horse spirit, and she's a girl.

00:19:30.712 --> 00:19:33.006 position:50% align:center
A really beautiful girl.

00:19:33.089 --> 00:19:37.260 position:50% align:center
More than that, I guess she's
what you'd call... alluring?

00:19:37.344 --> 00:19:39.429 position:50% align:center
And she had a very nice figure.

00:19:39.512 --> 00:19:42.807 position:50% align:center
Oh, my clothes probably
won't fit her.

00:19:42.891 --> 00:19:45.226 position:50% align:center
Not well, anyway.

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:47.645 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Rin, come on.

00:19:47.729 --> 00:19:49.773 position:50% align:center
What are you doing here?

00:19:49.856 --> 00:19:51.149 position:50% align:center
No, let me guess.

00:19:51.232 --> 00:19:53.985 position:50% align:center
Thing is I... got dumped.

00:19:54.069 --> 00:19:56.196 position:50% align:center
By Rin.

00:19:56.279 --> 00:19:58.531 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
You came to see someone.

00:19:58.615 --> 00:19:59.741 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU]
Shut up!

00:19:59.824 --> 00:20:02.077 position:50% align:center
It's none of your damn
business where I go!

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.079 position:50% align:center
Do you understand me?

00:20:04.162 --> 00:20:05.622 position:50% align:center
Keep your mouth shut.

00:20:05.705 --> 00:20:07.248 position:50% align:center
No more questions,

00:20:07.332 --> 00:20:10.502 position:50% align:center
and don't you dare tell
anyone else I'm here.

00:20:10.585 --> 00:20:15.215 position:50% align:center
If you do...
I swear, I'll kill you!

00:20:15.298 --> 00:20:16.966 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Kill me?

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:20.178 position:50% align:center
I think we both know
that's impossible.

00:20:20.261 --> 00:20:21.930 position:50% align:center
Don't try to act cool.

00:20:22.013 --> 00:20:25.475 position:50% align:center
You aren't fooling anyone.
You're just Akito's little toy.

00:20:25.558 --> 00:20:27.560 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:29.187 --> 00:20:30.605 position:50% align:center

00:20:36.986 --> 00:20:38.321 position:50% align:center

Don't tell!

00:20:38.405 --> 00:20:40.824 position:50% align:center
Don't tell anyone I'm here!

00:20:40.907 --> 00:20:43.076 position:50% align:center
Um, wait. Isuzu, please!

00:20:43.159 --> 00:20:45.829 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Not everyone can pull off
that attitude stark-naked.

00:20:45.912 --> 00:20:46.955 position:50% align:center
I'm impressed.

00:20:47.038 --> 00:20:49.624 position:50% align:center
She left without even
getting dressed.

00:20:49.708 --> 00:20:51.835 position:50% align:center
Do you think she's
going to be all right?

00:20:51.918 --> 00:20:53.837 position:50% align:center
Eventually, yes.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.839 position:50% align:center
But for now, let's not
tell anyone we saw her.

00:20:55.922 --> 00:20:58.341 position:50% align:center
Um, okay. I'm worried, though.

00:20:58.425 --> 00:21:00.510 position:50% align:center
Trust me, I wanna
go after her, too,

00:21:00.593 --> 00:21:03.430 position:50% align:center
but I need to get back
before anyone misses me.

00:21:03.513 --> 00:21:04.597 position:50% align:center
I kinda snuck out.

00:21:04.681 --> 00:21:05.557 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.892 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
It'll be all right.

00:21:07.976 --> 00:21:10.562 position:50% align:center
You just leave her to me, okay?

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:13.857 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
See you. Sorry for rushing off.

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:15.150 position:50% align:center
Yuki, wait.

00:21:15.233 --> 00:21:16.443 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Hm?

00:21:19.404 --> 00:21:24.325 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] I just have to help
in whatever small way I can.

00:21:26.911 --> 00:21:28.621 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I'll, um...

00:21:28.705 --> 00:21:30.540 position:50% align:center
I'll be here.

00:21:39.007 --> 00:21:40.759 position:50% align:center
Thanks for that.

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:54.439 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
That's almost all of them now.

00:21:54.522 --> 00:21:59.152 position:50% align:center
I've met the Horse, so the
Rooster's the only one left.

00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:03.281 position:50% align:center

Wait, that must mean--

00:22:05.033 --> 00:22:06.493 position:50% align:center

Damn it!

00:22:06.576 --> 00:22:08.036 position:50% align:center
Damn it! Damn it...!

00:22:08.119 --> 00:22:11.414 position:50% align:center

That must mean that Akito is...

00:22:11.498 --> 00:22:17.837 position:50% align:center
Shigure, tomorrow,
bring Kyo. No excuses.

00:22:19.964 --> 00:22:22.967 position:50% align:center
Ooh, did you hear that?
I think I feel a storm brewing.

00:22:23.051 --> 00:22:26.388 position:50% align:center
I think you're enjoying
this altogether too much.
