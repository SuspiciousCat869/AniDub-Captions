[TOHRU]
Wow!

00:00:14.097 --> 00:00:18.018 position:50% align:center
We've got bottle rockets,
sparklers, skyrockets.

00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:19.644 position:50% align:center
So many different kinds!

00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:22.439 position:50% align:center
Jeez, what did you morons do,
clean out the whole store?

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:25.525 position:50% align:center
If you had to pick just
one, which would it be?

00:00:25.608 --> 00:00:26.735 position:50% align:center
I like sparklers.

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:28.278 position:50% align:center
Did you buy all these, Yuki?

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:31.072 position:50% align:center
No. We've got Momiji
to thank for that.

00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:32.949 position:50% align:center
Miss Honda?

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:35.785 position:50% align:center
I was thinking we could set
these all off tomorrow night.

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:37.037 position:50% align:center
What do you say?

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.873 position:50% align:center
Uh. That sounds good,
but why tomorrow?

00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:43.418 position:50% align:center
Well, um, you know, we're
leaving the day after that,

00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:46.129 position:50% align:center
so it's our last chance.

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:47.422 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU yelps]

00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:48.882 position:50% align:center
Are you always this loud?

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:50.258 position:50% align:center
I guess you forgot.

00:00:50.342 --> 00:00:53.345 position:50% align:center
Oh, um, yeah, I did.

00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:55.805 position:50% align:center
A lot's happened
since we got here.

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:58.558 position:50% align:center
The time went by so quickly.

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:02.687 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I figured, this way,

00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:05.398 position:50% align:center
we can finish off our
vacation with a fun memory.

00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:08.401 position:50% align:center
'Cause... the way
things worked out,

00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:10.653 position:50% align:center
I'm sure it must've
been lonely for you.

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:12.072 position:50% align:center
Right?

00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:21.915 position:50% align:center
No. I wasn't lonely.
It's been a great trip.

00:01:21.998 --> 00:01:24.125 position:50% align:center
We weren't together
the whole time,

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:26.044 position:50% align:center
but at least we were all here.

00:01:26.127 --> 00:01:27.879 position:50% align:center
That's what matters.

00:01:27.962 --> 00:01:31.466 position:50% align:center
I got to spend my summer with
the people I care most about.

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.469 position:50% align:center
What more could
I ask for than that?

00:01:34.552 --> 00:01:40.225 position:50% align:center
I think... I think fireworks
would be perfect.

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:15.528 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Oh.

00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:17.697 position:50% align:center
It's almost time for
the <i>Mogeta</i> TV special.

00:03:17.781 --> 00:03:18.990 position:50% align:center
Kisa, ready?

00:03:19.074 --> 00:03:20.116 position:50% align:center
[KISA]
Mh-hm.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.577 position:50% align:center
But Momiji said he'd
watch it with us.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.455 position:50% align:center
I'll go find him and let
him know it's about to start.

00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:30.210 position:50% align:center
Great. Thanks.

00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:33.088 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
This trip was special.

00:03:33.171 --> 00:03:37.967 position:50% align:center
Not just for me, but for
everyone else, too, I think.

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:43.431 position:50% align:center
Especially Yuki and Kyo.

00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:47.102 position:50% align:center
Something's changed in
Yuki since he's been here.

00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:49.104 position:50% align:center
Kyo seems different, too.

00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:53.817 position:50% align:center
And I think it's a good thing,
for both of them.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.694 position:50% align:center
But what about me?

00:03:55.777 --> 00:03:58.071 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Kyo, you're off the hook.

00:03:58.154 --> 00:04:00.365 position:50% align:center
No trip to the annex
tomorrow, right?

00:04:00.448 --> 00:04:01.408 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Nope.

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:04.077 position:50% align:center
That's great!
Like, really great!

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.664 position:50% align:center
Is it wrong to say that? Sorry.

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:10.458 position:50% align:center
I didn't understand at first.

00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:11.751 position:50% align:center
Why the rest of
you were so quick

00:04:11.835 --> 00:04:14.212 position:50% align:center
to do as you were told
and abandon Tohru,

00:04:14.295 --> 00:04:16.506 position:50% align:center
like good children.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:17.841 position:50% align:center
But I get it now.

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:20.468 position:50% align:center
If it looked like you were
choosing her over Akito,

00:04:20.552 --> 00:04:22.637 position:50% align:center
Akito would get mad.

00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:26.266 position:50% align:center
And that would only make
things even harder on Tohru.

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:31.062 position:50% align:center
So really, you guys
were protecting her.

00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:34.941 position:50% align:center
Keeping her safe from Akito.

00:04:35.025 --> 00:04:37.819 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
You make it sound so noble.

00:04:37.902 --> 00:04:40.697 position:50% align:center
Like it's a good thing
that Tohru's become

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.658 position:50% align:center
so important to us.

00:04:43.742 --> 00:04:47.162 position:50% align:center
But the truth is,
I feel like we've...

00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:49.497 position:50% align:center
...like I've made a mistake.

00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:51.541 position:50% align:center
One that could hurt her.

00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:56.046 position:50% align:center
Spending time with Tohru...
making memories with her...

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:57.922 position:50% align:center
...it's selfish.

00:04:58.006 --> 00:05:01.134 position:50% align:center
I'm selfish for caring
about her so much.

00:05:01.217 --> 00:05:03.011 position:50% align:center
For loving her.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.433 position:50% align:center
I guess I'm selfish, too, huh?

00:05:08.516 --> 00:05:09.476 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Hm?

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:11.478 position:50% align:center
It's nothing. Forget about it.

00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:13.938 position:50% align:center
Anyway, kid, weren't
you gonna go downstairs

00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:14.689 position:50% align:center
to watch TV or something?

00:05:14.773 --> 00:05:16.900 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Momiji! Kyo!

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:18.276 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Kyo said he would beat me up

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.154 position:50% align:center
if I didn't give him
all my money!

00:05:21.237 --> 00:05:23.948 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on. You don't
believe that crap, do you?

00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:25.075 position:50% align:center
--I'm scared!
--You're okay.

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:26.951 position:50% align:center
But you should go.
The show's starting.

00:05:27.035 --> 00:05:29.662 position:50% align:center
<i>Mogeta</i> ! Wouldn't
want to miss that!

00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:33.124 position:50% align:center
Weirdo. How could
anybody like that show?

00:05:33.208 --> 00:05:35.043 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I wish...

00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:37.462 position:50% align:center
I wish I could find
some way to help.

00:05:37.545 --> 00:05:40.215 position:50% align:center
All right! Let's see your
kick volleyball skills, Art!

00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:41.424 position:50% align:center
We'll settle this for good!

00:05:41.508 --> 00:05:42.926 position:50% align:center
Mogeta!

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:44.386 position:50% align:center
[ART]
Let's go, Mogeta...

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:47.222 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] They give so much
of themselves. All of them.

00:05:47.305 --> 00:05:49.057 position:50% align:center
Even when it's not easy.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.810 position:50% align:center
Even when they're
struggling or in pain.

00:05:51.893 --> 00:05:53.853 position:50% align:center
There must be
something I can do.

00:05:53.937 --> 00:05:55.980 position:50% align:center
Some way to give back.

00:05:56.064 --> 00:06:01.194 position:50% align:center
Maybe I'm strong enough now.
Maybe I've changed, too.

00:06:01.277 --> 00:06:03.530 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
I confess, I'm still curious

00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:05.865 position:50% align:center
why you had Kureno
accompany you here.

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:08.535 position:50% align:center
That seemed rather out
of character for you.

00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:11.079 position:50% align:center
He's the favorite you prefer
to keep tucked out of sight,

00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:13.248 position:50% align:center
so why bring him along now?

00:06:13.331 --> 00:06:18.503 position:50% align:center
I don't know. He seems out
of sorts lately--not himself.

00:06:18.586 --> 00:06:22.298 position:50% align:center
I thought it might do him good
to get away for a little while.

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:23.967 position:50% align:center
Feeling stressed, maybe.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.969 position:50% align:center
That can fell the
best of us, you know.

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:29.305 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Stressed? From what?

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:32.809 position:50% align:center
If anyone around here is under
stress right now, it's me.

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:34.853 position:50% align:center
Ah, there you go again.

00:06:34.936 --> 00:06:36.604 position:50% align:center
So, what's wrong?

00:06:36.688 --> 00:06:39.065 position:50% align:center
Something in particular
displeasing you?

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:42.277 position:50% align:center
[AKITO] In particular?
Everything displeases me.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.029 position:50% align:center
Like what?

00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:47.365 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Like you, for example.

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:51.619 position:50% align:center
You haven't been kind
to me lately. Not at all.

00:06:51.703 --> 00:06:53.913 position:50% align:center
I don't understand
what's changed.

00:06:53.997 --> 00:06:56.291 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?
I am kind to you.

00:06:56.374 --> 00:06:57.917 position:50% align:center
Not kind enough!

00:06:58.001 --> 00:06:59.377 position:50% align:center
Not like you were.

00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:03.381 position:50% align:center
You used to look only at me.
I deserve better from you.

00:07:03.465 --> 00:07:06.676 position:50% align:center
Be kinder! Kinder!

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:10.347 position:50% align:center
You've changed.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.224 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me...

00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:17.604 position:50% align:center
It's because of her. That woman.

00:07:17.687 --> 00:07:19.147 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:21.524 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
Akito.

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:23.068 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
What?

00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:25.403 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
Message from the main estate.

00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:34.996 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Fools. I'm the family head.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.499 position:50% align:center
They think they can summon me?

00:07:37.582 --> 00:07:40.335 position:50% align:center
If you were there to handle it,
things would go more smoo--

00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:43.713 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] Oh, dear.
Is Ren acting up again?

00:07:43.797 --> 00:07:46.299 position:50% align:center
That's not good.

00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:49.594 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
What? Why do you care?

00:07:49.678 --> 00:07:52.722 position:50% align:center
I don't. It was
groundless, you know.

00:07:52.806 --> 00:07:55.141 position:50% align:center
That suspicion.

00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:58.186 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Kureno, we're leaving.

00:08:05.944 --> 00:08:08.571 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
That woman.

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:10.824 position:50% align:center
That woman.

00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:14.577 position:50% align:center
That woman. That woman!

00:08:18.206 --> 00:08:21.459 position:50% align:center
Akito, you ready to go?

00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:49.362 position:50% align:center
Oh. Akito. It's so late.

00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:52.991 position:50% align:center
What, um, what are
you doing out here?

00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:55.702 position:50% align:center
I came to see Tohru Honda.

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:57.662 position:50% align:center
Go get her for me.

00:09:01.124 --> 00:09:03.293 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I can't sleep.

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:07.088 position:50% align:center
Maybe I'll go for a walk.
That'll cool me off.

00:09:09.007 --> 00:09:12.802 position:50% align:center
Something's come up and I have
to return home. At once.

00:09:12.886 --> 00:09:15.013 position:50% align:center
Regrettably, I haven't been able

00:09:15.096 --> 00:09:18.391 position:50% align:center
to see the girl since
I arrived, so...

00:09:18.475 --> 00:09:22.771 position:50% align:center
Now? But Tohru's already
in bed, sleeping.

00:09:22.854 --> 00:09:24.898 position:50% align:center
Then go wake her.

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:27.525 position:50% align:center
Hold on.

00:09:27.609 --> 00:09:29.778 position:50% align:center
Akito.

00:09:29.861 --> 00:09:33.782 position:50% align:center
I can tell you're mad,
and if you see Tohru,

00:09:33.865 --> 00:09:38.203 position:50% align:center
then you'll lash out,
and she'll get hurt.

00:09:38.286 --> 00:09:39.704 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:09:39.788 --> 00:09:43.583 position:50% align:center
Please tell me.
What are you so upset about?

00:09:43.667 --> 00:09:45.877 position:50% align:center
Did something bad happen?

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.004 position:50% align:center
"What's wrong?"

00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:51.383 position:50% align:center
That's rich. Why are you asking?

00:09:51.466 --> 00:09:53.385 position:50% align:center
To get to know me?

00:09:53.468 --> 00:09:57.222 position:50% align:center
To understand me? Is that it?

00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:00.934 position:50% align:center
Keep your false sympathy!

00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:03.978 position:50% align:center
It's a lie. All of it!

00:10:04.062 --> 00:10:06.189 position:50% align:center
You just wanna get
the upper hand.

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:09.025 position:50% align:center
To define me using
your own twisted logic

00:10:09.109 --> 00:10:10.610 position:50% align:center
and paint me as a villain!

00:10:10.694 --> 00:10:12.070 position:50% align:center
Please, let him go!

00:10:12.153 --> 00:10:13.405 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI gasps]

00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:17.075 position:50% align:center
Stop it! Leave him alone!

00:10:17.158 --> 00:10:18.785 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
What was that?

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:22.205 position:50% align:center
It sounded a lot like you
were giving me an order.

00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:24.708 position:50% align:center
How rude.

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:26.459 position:50% align:center
Awful, really.

00:10:26.543 --> 00:10:29.629 position:50% align:center
I can tell. You're not
a very nice person.

00:10:29.713 --> 00:10:31.256 position:50% align:center
Akito.

00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:34.551 position:50% align:center
But you see, Tohru--
Miss Tohru Honda,

00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:37.721 position:50% align:center
I was kind enough to take
the time to come visit.

00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:41.099 position:50% align:center
And no matter how disrespectful
you might be to me,

00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:43.685 position:50% align:center
there's something
I need to tell you.

00:10:43.768 --> 00:10:45.812 position:50% align:center
Something important.

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:49.482 position:50% align:center
Stop thinking you're special.

00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:50.358 position:50% align:center
Scum.

00:10:50.442 --> 00:10:51.735 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI gasps]

00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:54.529 position:50% align:center
[AKITO] You seem to believe
you saved Yuki and Kyo.

00:10:54.612 --> 00:10:58.241 position:50% align:center
And that may just be the most
arrogant thing I've ever heard.

00:10:58.324 --> 00:11:01.953 position:50% align:center
Little fool. You don't
have the full story.

00:11:02.037 --> 00:11:04.706 position:50% align:center
Listen closely.

00:11:04.789 --> 00:11:09.252 position:50% align:center
Once high school is over,
Kyo will be locked away.

00:11:09.336 --> 00:11:11.087 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:11.171 --> 00:11:13.340 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Just like the previous Cat,

00:11:13.423 --> 00:11:15.759 position:50% align:center
he'll be imprisoned for life.

00:11:15.842 --> 00:11:18.386 position:50% align:center
As for Yuki and the others,

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:22.015 position:50% align:center
they'll come back to the
estate, where they belong.

00:11:22.098 --> 00:11:23.808 position:50% align:center
For good.

00:11:25.935 --> 00:11:27.395 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
All of the zodiac members

00:11:27.479 --> 00:11:29.689 position:50% align:center
will move through life together.

00:11:29.773 --> 00:11:34.277 position:50% align:center
Every step in tandem.
Every breath shared.

00:11:34.361 --> 00:11:39.157 position:50% align:center
They will take nothing, and
nothing will be taken from them.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:43.745 position:50% align:center
As it should be.
Forever unchanging.

00:11:43.828 --> 00:11:51.586 position:50% align:center
A future of happiness,
an Eternal Banquet. Enduring.

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:53.588 position:50% align:center
That's what awaits them.

00:11:53.672 --> 00:11:56.549 position:50% align:center
And don't think for a
second you're be invited.

00:11:59.219 --> 00:12:00.929 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
That's what awaits them.

00:12:01.012 --> 00:12:04.557 position:50% align:center
And don't think for a
second you'll be invited.

00:12:04.641 --> 00:12:07.102 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I don't know.

00:12:07.185 --> 00:12:11.147 position:50% align:center
What you're talking about,
is it really happiness?

00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:17.070 position:50% align:center
For Kyo and all the others to be
caged or confined to the estate.

00:12:18.697 --> 00:12:20.740 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
"Forever unchanging."

00:12:20.824 --> 00:12:24.327 position:50% align:center
For their whole lives.

00:12:24.411 --> 00:12:28.707 position:50% align:center
But... they've been working
so hard to move forward,

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:30.458 position:50% align:center
no matter what it cost them.

00:12:30.542 --> 00:12:32.085 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Enough.

00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:36.464 position:50% align:center
The only reason you think that's
bad is because you're ignorant.

00:12:36.548 --> 00:12:38.591 position:50% align:center
An outsider like you
can't understand

00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:41.720 position:50% align:center
what life is like for us.

00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:46.433 position:50% align:center
Don't try to judge our needs and
desires using your petty values.

00:12:46.516 --> 00:12:49.477 position:50% align:center
They're not equipped for it.

00:12:49.561 --> 00:12:53.023 position:50% align:center
Akito.

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:54.899 position:50% align:center
Who are you?

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:02.157 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
At first, I thought the Rooster.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.035 position:50% align:center
But Akito's something different.

00:13:05.118 --> 00:13:07.370 position:50% align:center
Something else entirely.

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:13.084 position:50% align:center
Who are you to
the zodiac members?

00:13:13.168 --> 00:13:14.461 position:50% align:center
Are you...?

00:13:14.544 --> 00:13:16.338 position:50% align:center
[KYOKO]
"Once upon a time."

00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:17.881 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:23.094 position:50% align:center
[KYOKO] "God made an
invitation to the animals."

00:13:25.347 --> 00:13:27.557 position:50% align:center
[KYOKO]
"God"...

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:32.479 position:50% align:center
What did you think? That I was
just another animal spirit?

00:13:32.562 --> 00:13:36.608 position:50% align:center
No. To them, I am God.

00:13:38.276 --> 00:13:41.279 position:50% align:center
I am the master of
their hearts and souls.

00:13:41.363 --> 00:13:46.743 position:50% align:center
They belong to me. Understand?

00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:48.828 position:50% align:center
[KURENO]
Akito! Ah, there you are.

00:13:48.912 --> 00:13:51.081 position:50% align:center
I've been looking for you.

00:13:51.164 --> 00:13:52.582 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
I'm sorry, Kureno.

00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:56.503 position:50% align:center
I just had to come see
her before we left.

00:13:56.586 --> 00:14:00.048 position:50% align:center
Oh, right. You two
haven't met, have you?

00:14:00.131 --> 00:14:03.968 position:50% align:center
Let me introduce Kureno
Soma, the Rooster.

00:14:04.052 --> 00:14:05.136 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU gasps]

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.138 position:50% align:center
Hello. Honda.

00:14:07.222 --> 00:14:09.516 position:50% align:center
Um. Hello.

00:14:10.684 --> 00:14:12.894 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
So <i>he's</i> the Rooster.

00:14:12.977 --> 00:14:14.813 position:50% align:center
Remember this.

00:14:14.896 --> 00:14:18.066 position:50% align:center
The zodiac members will come
back to me in the end--

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:20.068 position:50% align:center
every last one.

00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:23.905 position:50% align:center
They have to.
We are inseparable.

00:14:23.988 --> 00:14:25.407 position:50% align:center
Time to back off.

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:29.160 position:50% align:center
We don't need an outsider
interfering with our happiness.

00:14:29.244 --> 00:14:33.665 position:50% align:center
So be a good little girl
and mind your own business.

00:14:33.748 --> 00:14:38.545 position:50% align:center
If you don't...
you'll be punished.

00:14:48.638 --> 00:14:50.974 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Akito is their God.

00:14:51.057 --> 00:14:54.310 position:50% align:center
The one who stands above
all the zodiac members.

00:14:54.394 --> 00:14:59.566 position:50% align:center
That's why they can't disobey,
even when they want to.

00:14:59.649 --> 00:15:02.110 position:50% align:center
What about the curse?

00:15:02.193 --> 00:15:06.489 position:50% align:center
The curse. A chain
that spans generations.

00:15:06.573 --> 00:15:10.702 position:50% align:center
Invisible and unknown,
but it binds everything.

00:15:12.787 --> 00:15:14.247 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Everyone.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.082 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:16.166 --> 00:15:19.878 position:50% align:center

Even... Akito.

[gasps]

00:15:21.338 --> 00:15:22.756 position:50% align:center
That looks painful.

00:15:22.839 --> 00:15:25.467 position:50% align:center
Go, Doc. I'll see
to her scratches.

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:27.635 position:50% align:center
Aren't you returning home
with Akito tonight?

00:15:27.719 --> 00:15:31.639 position:50% align:center
Uh. Hatori, you're--
And Shigure, too?

00:15:31.723 --> 00:15:34.934 position:50% align:center
[HATORI] It won't kill them
to wait on me a little bit.

00:15:35.018 --> 00:15:37.771 position:50% align:center
Um, what are you
guys doing here?

00:15:37.854 --> 00:15:39.314 position:50% align:center
Momiji got me.

00:15:39.397 --> 00:15:43.443 position:50% align:center
The poor thing was absolutely
terrified. White as a ghost.

00:15:43.526 --> 00:15:46.529 position:50% align:center
What happened to Momiji?
He's not hurt, is he?

00:15:46.613 --> 00:15:48.531 position:50% align:center
Yes, but not badly.

00:15:48.615 --> 00:15:49.491 position:50% align:center
He's right here.

00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:50.825 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU gasps]

00:15:50.909 --> 00:15:52.202 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Momiji!

00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:54.788 position:50% align:center
What happened?
Are you all right?

00:15:54.871 --> 00:15:58.792 position:50% align:center
Um... I think so.

00:16:00.669 --> 00:16:02.337 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:06.925 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] To me... even
your tears are precious.

00:16:13.056 --> 00:16:15.809 position:50% align:center
You're going to catch cold.

00:16:15.892 --> 00:16:19.187 position:50% align:center
Well, that was an impressive
display of courage.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.773 position:50% align:center
Our little bunny here put
the other kids to shame.

00:16:21.856 --> 00:16:23.316 position:50% align:center
What's that say about us?

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:27.237 position:50% align:center
We're the adults
here, aren't we?

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.364 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
There, you see?

00:16:29.447 --> 00:16:30.740 position:50% align:center
Akito is gone.

00:16:30.824 --> 00:16:33.576 position:50% align:center
I told you Momiji would get
the grown-ups to help.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:36.287 position:50% align:center
It's over now.

00:16:36.371 --> 00:16:38.123 position:50% align:center
[KYO] While I stood by
and did nothing.

00:16:38.206 --> 00:16:40.041 position:50% align:center
I'm so pathetic.

00:16:41.251 --> 00:16:43.294 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
So...

00:16:43.378 --> 00:16:48.216 position:50% align:center
He thinks he's pathetic, too.
It isn't just me. Who knew?

00:16:48.299 --> 00:16:49.467 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
That sarcasm?

00:16:49.551 --> 00:16:53.596 position:50% align:center
No, it's not. I'm serious.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:57.684 position:50% align:center
It isn't exactly easy,
protecting someone.

00:16:57.767 --> 00:16:59.978 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:02.814 position:50% align:center
Don't tell anyone I'm here!

00:17:02.897 --> 00:17:04.733 position:50% align:center
That's why.

00:17:04.816 --> 00:17:05.608 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:17:05.692 --> 00:17:08.278 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Oh. Nothing.

00:17:08.361 --> 00:17:10.655 position:50% align:center
You're right, though.

00:17:10.739 --> 00:17:15.160 position:50% align:center
It can be hard, trying to
keep someone else safe.

00:17:22.625 --> 00:17:24.544 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
It's hard.

00:17:24.627 --> 00:17:31.551 position:50% align:center
But even so, I wanna protect
them, no matter what.

00:17:37.349 --> 00:17:40.769 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU
And... I will.

00:17:46.316 --> 00:17:47.901 position:50% align:center
<i>Hallo</i> , sun!

00:17:47.984 --> 00:17:51.029 position:50% align:center
The rain's all gone!
It's firework time!

00:17:51.112 --> 00:17:54.199 position:50% align:center
What? Now? But it's nowhere
near completely dark yet.

00:17:54.282 --> 00:17:55.867 position:50% align:center
So what?

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:59.204 position:50% align:center
I can't wait until tonight,
that's way too long! <i>Ja</i> ?

00:17:59.287 --> 00:18:00.538 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh!

00:18:00.622 --> 00:18:03.041 position:50% align:center
Hey, why do you have those
bandages on your faces?

00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:04.793 position:50% align:center
Oh, you mean these?

00:18:04.876 --> 00:18:07.003 position:50% align:center
We both fell while we
were walking last night,

00:18:07.087 --> 00:18:08.546 position:50% align:center
and now we match!

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:10.632 position:50% align:center
Right, Momiji?

00:18:13.218 --> 00:18:16.137 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI] Yep! We're like
two bees in a pod.

00:18:16.221 --> 00:18:18.515 position:50% align:center
[HIRO] The word you're
looking for is "peas."

00:18:18.598 --> 00:18:22.018 position:50% align:center
Come on. Are we doin' this
or not? Which one first?

00:18:22.102 --> 00:18:23.687 position:50% align:center
Leave that to me!

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:26.731 position:50% align:center
I've already picked,
and it's gonna be awesome.

00:18:26.815 --> 00:18:28.900 position:50% align:center
Here we go!

00:18:32.237 --> 00:18:35.115 position:50% align:center
[HIRO]
Yeah... awesome.

00:18:35.198 --> 00:18:36.533 position:50% align:center
That's what you picked?

00:18:36.616 --> 00:18:39.327 position:50% align:center
It's not bad. Definitely
worth seeing once.

00:18:39.411 --> 00:18:42.205 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I dunno. The smoke's
a little much for me.

00:18:42.288 --> 00:18:43.665 position:50% align:center
Hey, Kyo.

00:18:43.748 --> 00:18:46.084 position:50% align:center
Have you seen this kind before,
or is it the first time?

00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:48.545 position:50% align:center
Nah. I've seen 'em.

00:18:48.628 --> 00:18:50.922 position:50% align:center
I told Master I'd never
set off any fireworks

00:18:51.006 --> 00:18:54.175 position:50% align:center
and he brought home a
whole boatload of 'em.

00:18:54.259 --> 00:18:57.971 position:50% align:center
I was just a kid, so I thought
it was the coolest thing ever.

00:18:59.681 --> 00:19:01.057 position:50% align:center
You've done it before, right?

00:19:01.141 --> 00:19:04.477 position:50% align:center
Set off fireworks?
With your mom?

00:19:04.561 --> 00:19:07.147 position:50% align:center
Yep! It was fun.

00:19:08.314 --> 00:19:09.774 position:50% align:center
Mom loved them.

00:19:09.858 --> 00:19:12.318 position:50% align:center
She said there was nothing like
fire to get her blood pumping!

00:19:12.402 --> 00:19:14.320 position:50% align:center
She was a delinquent, all right.

00:19:14.404 --> 00:19:16.448 position:50% align:center
Look. Let's try this.

00:19:16.531 --> 00:19:19.117 position:50% align:center
'Kay. How are you
supposed to set it off?

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.452 position:50% align:center
I dunno.

00:19:20.535 --> 00:19:23.329 position:50% align:center
Here. Check the instructions.

00:19:23.413 --> 00:19:26.499 position:50% align:center
It says, "Point upwards.
Place inside a bottle.

00:19:26.583 --> 00:19:28.918 position:50% align:center
Carefully light the
tip of the fuse."

00:19:29.002 --> 00:19:31.129 position:50% align:center
Oh, and it says not to hold it

00:19:31.212 --> 00:19:33.006 position:50% align:center
or point it at
people or animals.

00:19:33.089 --> 00:19:34.632 position:50% align:center
Did ya hear him, moron?

00:19:34.716 --> 00:19:35.884 position:50% align:center
You can dodge.

00:19:35.967 --> 00:19:38.136 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, I have
faith in you, Kyo.

00:19:38.219 --> 00:19:40.180 position:50% align:center
So, you ready?

00:19:40.263 --> 00:19:42.057 position:50% align:center
I will hurt you.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:43.767 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU] Fine,
I'll fire it into the air.

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:46.394 position:50% align:center
[KYO] Yeah? Then why are you
still pointing it at me?

00:19:46.478 --> 00:19:48.772 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Here we go! Firecrackers!

00:19:48.855 --> 00:19:49.981 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
They're so loud!

00:19:50.065 --> 00:19:52.192 position:50% align:center
[HATSUHARU]
They're kinda supposed to be.

00:19:52.275 --> 00:19:54.819 position:50% align:center
They sure are pretty,
aren't they?

00:19:57.364 --> 00:20:00.158 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] When Master Kazuma
showed Kyo fireworks,

00:20:00.241 --> 00:20:02.035 position:50% align:center
it wasn't to prepare
him for a future

00:20:02.118 --> 00:20:05.246 position:50% align:center
spent locked away in a cage.

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:07.707 position:50% align:center
And when Yuki
continues to fight,

00:20:07.791 --> 00:20:12.212 position:50% align:center
it's not because he wants to
return to the Soma estate.

00:20:12.295 --> 00:20:13.963 position:50% align:center
I think they all have
their own idea

00:20:14.047 --> 00:20:16.383 position:50% align:center
of what the future might bring,

00:20:16.466 --> 00:20:20.136 position:50% align:center
if only they had the
freedom to strive for it.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.055 position:50% align:center
But they hold back.

00:20:22.138 --> 00:20:26.226 position:50% align:center
And if it's the curse
that's restraining them...

00:20:26.309 --> 00:20:29.396 position:50% align:center
...I wanna break it.

00:20:29.479 --> 00:20:31.690 position:50% align:center
I'm probably in over my head.

00:20:31.773 --> 00:20:36.569 position:50% align:center
It's easy to say you'll protect
someone, and harder to do it.

00:20:36.653 --> 00:20:39.072 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Mind your own business.

00:20:39.155 --> 00:20:41.074 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I have to try, though.

00:20:41.157 --> 00:20:42.492 position:50% align:center
I have to do whatever I can,

00:20:42.575 --> 00:20:46.246 position:50% align:center
because if it means
seeing them set free,

00:20:46.329 --> 00:20:50.333 position:50% align:center
seeing them laugh and cry
with their whole hearts,

00:20:50.417 --> 00:20:53.128 position:50% align:center
then I don't care
about being punished.

00:20:54.295 --> 00:20:56.297 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I wanna break the curse.

00:20:56.381 --> 00:20:58.216 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Miss Honda?

00:20:58.299 --> 00:21:00.301 position:50% align:center
Here.

00:21:00.385 --> 00:21:02.971 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
It's so pretty.

00:21:03.054 --> 00:21:05.056 position:50% align:center
Everyone seems to be
enjoying themselves.

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:06.474 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Yeah.

00:21:06.558 --> 00:21:08.643 position:50% align:center
This trip, it's the first time

00:21:08.727 --> 00:21:10.854 position:50% align:center
we've all gotten
together like this.

00:21:10.937 --> 00:21:13.898 position:50% align:center
Just for fun, you know?

00:21:13.982 --> 00:21:15.900 position:50% align:center
It's strange.

00:21:15.984 --> 00:21:18.361 position:50% align:center
Summer comes around every year,

00:21:18.445 --> 00:21:21.406 position:50% align:center
but it's never the
same summer twice.

00:21:21.489 --> 00:21:27.078 position:50% align:center
I'm glad I'm here, getting to
spend this summer with you.

00:21:27.162 --> 00:21:30.832 position:50% align:center
I'll treasure it forever.

00:21:30.915 --> 00:21:32.584 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI]
Um...

00:21:32.667 --> 00:21:34.002 position:50% align:center
Can I sit here, too?

00:21:34.085 --> 00:21:34.711 position:50% align:center
Sure!

00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:35.587 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:37.380 position:50% align:center
[MOMIJI laughs]

00:21:37.464 --> 00:21:39.382 position:50% align:center
I brought some sparklers for us.

00:21:39.466 --> 00:21:40.550 position:50% align:center
Great!

00:21:40.633 --> 00:21:43.345 position:50% align:center
Kyo! Come over and
do sparklers with us!

00:21:43.428 --> 00:21:45.722 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna listen
to your screeching.

00:21:45.805 --> 00:21:47.807 position:50% align:center
You guys just do 'em without me.

00:21:47.891 --> 00:21:49.934 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
What's the matter?

00:21:50.018 --> 00:21:54.814 position:50% align:center
Waiting for me to get up and
offer you my seat, stupid Cat?

00:21:54.898 --> 00:21:57.025 position:50% align:center
What? Screw you, Rat boy!

00:21:57.108 --> 00:21:58.109 position:50% align:center
It's okay, Kyo.

00:21:58.193 --> 00:21:59.778 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
I can sit wherever I want to!

00:21:59.861 --> 00:22:01.488 position:50% align:center
It's not like I need
your permission.

00:22:01.571 --> 00:22:03.031 position:50% align:center
[YUKI sighs]

00:22:03.114 --> 00:22:05.241 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] You're impossible when
you get stubborn like this.

00:22:05.325 --> 00:22:07.577 position:50% align:center
--[MOMIJI] Stubborn Kyo!
--[KYO] Shut up!

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:09.788 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU, MOMIJI chuckle]

00:22:09.871 --> 00:22:11.790 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I'll fight for them.

00:22:13.875 --> 00:22:15.543 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I'll do my best

00:22:15.627 --> 00:22:19.047 position:50% align:center
to protect the futures
they're striving for.

00:22:21.091 --> 00:22:25.553 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Whatever strength
I have, is theirs.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.356 position:50% align:center
[KAGURA]
"All mine."
