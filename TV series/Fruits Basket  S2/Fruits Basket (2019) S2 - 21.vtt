[YUKI coughing]

00:00:14.973 --> 00:00:16.558 position:50% align:center
[HEAD SERVANT A]
The birth of the Rat is a matter

00:00:16.641 --> 00:00:18.685 position:50% align:center
of great celebration
for the Somas.

00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:21.104 position:50% align:center
So I'm sure you can imagine
how highly anticipated

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:22.897 position:50% align:center
your arrival has been.

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:25.817 position:50% align:center
Akito, the current family head,
is thrilled, of course.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.610 position:50% align:center
And I have no doubt that
the late family head

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:30.155 position:50% align:center
would have been elated, as well.

00:00:30.238 --> 00:00:31.740 position:50% align:center
Still, though.

00:00:31.823 --> 00:00:34.909 position:50% align:center
The fact that he's such a sickly
child must be cause for concern.

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:36.202 position:50% align:center
The family head may find him

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:38.788 position:50% align:center
a frustrating and
inadequate companion.

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:42.334 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. I wouldn't
let that worry you.

00:00:43.335 --> 00:00:45.795 position:50% align:center
It's said between God
and the zodiac members,

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.507 position:50% align:center
there is a bond--one so deep
it defies description.

00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:52.427 position:50% align:center
Given that, I'm sure they will
quickly become good friends.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.804 position:50% align:center
[YUKI coughing]

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:58.141 position:50% align:center
Yuki, you're not to cough
in front of the family head.

00:00:58.224 --> 00:00:59.809 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:02.937 position:50% align:center
[HEAD SERVANT A] Akito,
I've brought him to meet you.

00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:04.481 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:09.319 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:12.614 --> 00:01:15.158 position:50% align:center
[YUKI'S MOTHER] What's this
about? Why are you crying?

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:16.326 position:50% align:center
Don't be rude!

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.537 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
But... I couldn't help it.

00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:21.414 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Something I couldn't name

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:27.295 position:50% align:center
from deep, deep, deep in
my chest was crying out.

00:01:27.379 --> 00:01:29.714 position:50% align:center
I wanted to see you.
I didn't want to see you.

00:01:29.798 --> 00:01:32.884 position:50% align:center
I want to embrace you.
I want to escape.

00:01:32.967 --> 00:01:35.136 position:50% align:center
The older ones who
possess zodiac spirits

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.805 position:50% align:center
cried like that, as well.

00:01:36.888 --> 00:01:39.099 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't see it as rudeness.

00:01:39.182 --> 00:01:40.642 position:50% align:center
Rather, I believe it is evidence

00:01:40.725 --> 00:01:43.186 position:50% align:center
of the incredible
bond they share.

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:46.731 position:50% align:center
It must be an
unbreakable connection.

00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:48.400 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I love you.

00:01:48.483 --> 00:01:50.694 position:50% align:center
I hate you.

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:56.700 position:50% align:center
Finally, we meet.
I'm so glad, my Yuki.

00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:32.212 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] For as long as I can
remember, I was by Akito's side.

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:33.546 position:50% align:center
Hey, did you know,

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.174 position:50% align:center
the Rat's the first among
all the zodiac animals?

00:03:36.257 --> 00:03:39.552 position:50% align:center
That means the Rat is closer
to God than the others are.

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:40.762 position:50% align:center
And that out of all of them,

00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:43.098 position:50% align:center
you're the one who's
most similar to me.

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:47.102 position:50% align:center
You're special, just like I am.

00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:51.398 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I spent all day, every
day inside, playing with Akito.

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:53.983 position:50% align:center
A captive audience of one.

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:56.861 position:50% align:center
As young as I was at the time,
it didn't occur to me

00:03:56.945 --> 00:04:00.699 position:50% align:center
to question anything,
let alone object.

00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:02.992 position:50% align:center
[YUKI coughing]

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:04.619 position:50% align:center
Shut up already!

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:08.498 position:50% align:center
I hate your stupid cough.
It's annoying.

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:12.085 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Back then, Akito had tantrums,

00:04:12.168 --> 00:04:14.421 position:50% align:center
but they weren't
like they are now.

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:21.052 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] In fact, I remember tears
along with the screaming.

00:04:21.136 --> 00:04:26.307 position:50% align:center
It wasn't unusual to catch sight
of Shigure comforting Akito.

00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:31.104 position:50% align:center
I didn't understand the sadness,
or the frustration.

00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:33.606 position:50% align:center
Then one day, it got much worse.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.486 position:50% align:center
Akito's mind...
slipped over the edge.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.198 position:50% align:center
[AKITO] This world--
my world--is pitch-black.

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:44.159 position:50% align:center
That's why I'm doing this.

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:46.995 position:50% align:center
I need to make the room
match. Make it dark, too.

00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:48.413 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Akito?

00:04:48.496 --> 00:04:52.000 position:50% align:center
And you're next. You need
to be pitch-black like me.

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:54.711 position:50% align:center
We've always been the same,
and that can't change now,

00:04:54.794 --> 00:04:57.547 position:50% align:center
so you have to become
part of the darkness.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.425 position:50% align:center
It's not fair if we're
not the same.

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:07.432 position:50% align:center
No, wait. That's wrong.

00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:09.601 position:50% align:center
We're nothing alike.

00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:13.229 position:50% align:center
We can't be, because
I'm not useless.

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:14.731 position:50% align:center
Useless?

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:19.944 position:50% align:center
[AKITO] Everyone needs me.
I'm the chosen one.

00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:22.530 position:50% align:center
I'm here because
all of you need me.

00:05:22.614 --> 00:05:25.325 position:50% align:center
How could I ever think
we were alike?

00:05:25.408 --> 00:05:28.078 position:50% align:center
You're just a toy
for me to play with!

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:31.081 position:50% align:center
Don't you see?
Your mother gave you to me!

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:35.418 position:50% align:center
Ha! I mean, you were
basically thrown away!

00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:36.586 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Please.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.464 position:50% align:center
Please, Mom, when
can I come back home?

00:05:39.547 --> 00:05:41.383 position:50% align:center
Eventually.

00:05:42.967 --> 00:05:45.220 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Get it through your head, idiot!

00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:47.639 position:50% align:center
The Rat is despised by everyone.

00:05:47.722 --> 00:05:50.892 position:50% align:center
No one cares about you.
No one at all!

00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:52.811 position:50% align:center
You're lucky I'm here.

00:05:52.894 --> 00:05:54.979 position:50% align:center
I look out for you,
and if I didn't,

00:05:55.063 --> 00:05:58.900 position:50% align:center
then your life would be
worth less than nothing!

00:05:58.983 --> 00:06:01.403 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I realized something.

00:06:01.486 --> 00:06:03.697 position:50% align:center
In all my life,
I had never talked

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.908 position:50% align:center
to any of the other
zodiac members.

00:06:06.991 --> 00:06:09.077 position:50% align:center
I was always with Akito.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.746 position:50% align:center
I'd seen the person they
called my older brother,

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.082 position:50% align:center
but I'd never spoken to him.

00:06:14.165 --> 00:06:15.083 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:17.585 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
The Rat is despised.

00:06:19.254 --> 00:06:21.214 position:50% align:center
[SERVANT A]
Oh, the little Cat child?

00:06:21.297 --> 00:06:22.966 position:50% align:center
Yes, he's always there.

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:24.551 position:50% align:center
[SERVANT B]
Really? Outside?

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:28.263 position:50% align:center
Lurking around with a bitter
look on his face. So rude.

00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:31.433 position:50% align:center
[SERVANT B] He's probably
upset about being left out.

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:33.393 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
The Cat?

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.606 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] At that point,
I'd never met Kyo, either.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:39.899 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:45.113 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Wow. What a pretty orange color.

00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:46.865 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Um, I...

00:06:46.948 --> 00:06:48.867 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
So, you're the Rat?

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.326 position:50% align:center
[YUKI gasps]

00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:53.997 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
You... I won't forgive you.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.498 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:58.710 position:50% align:center
That's right. No matter what,
I'll never forgive you!

00:06:58.793 --> 00:07:01.755 position:50% align:center
It's the Rat's fault--all of it!

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:03.506 position:50% align:center
Because of you--

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.259 position:50% align:center
Because of you,
everything went wrong!

00:07:06.343 --> 00:07:10.347 position:50% align:center
You should just... drop off
the face of the earth!

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:20.940 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Mom.

00:07:21.024 --> 00:07:23.860 position:50% align:center
Mom, please, can I--?

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:27.197 position:50% align:center
Where did you wander off to?

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.575 position:50% align:center
Go back to the family head
at once! Right now!

00:07:30.658 --> 00:07:33.036 position:50% align:center
The Rat is despised by everyone.

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:36.247 position:50% align:center
No one cares about you.
No one at all!

00:07:37.665 --> 00:07:40.085 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
You're deluding yourself.

00:07:40.168 --> 00:07:42.671 position:50% align:center
Listen, this world is dark.

00:07:42.754 --> 00:07:46.091 position:50% align:center
You'll spend your life
along a pitch-black path

00:07:46.174 --> 00:07:49.427 position:50% align:center
with no hope and no
chance of salvation.

00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:52.722 position:50% align:center
Don't ever allow yourself
to think otherwise.

00:07:52.806 --> 00:07:57.227 position:50% align:center
You will never
be saved. Not ever.

00:07:58.436 --> 00:08:01.773 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Every day,
I heard words like that.

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:03.900 position:50% align:center
Every single day.

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:07.779 position:50% align:center
Akito burned those pitch-
black thoughts into me.

00:08:07.862 --> 00:08:12.784 position:50% align:center
And eventually,
I started to believe them.

00:08:12.867 --> 00:08:18.498 position:50% align:center
Nobody cared about me.
I was worthless. Insignificant.

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:23.086 position:50% align:center
And even when I reached out,
hoping someone would save me...

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:28.008 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Knowing I'd only be
looked at with indifference,

00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:32.178 position:50% align:center
or with hatred,
I grew afraid to be seen.

00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:35.724 position:50% align:center
[SOMA WOMAN A]
I hear that Yuki's parents

00:08:35.807 --> 00:08:37.809 position:50% align:center
are living quite the life.

00:08:37.892 --> 00:08:39.936 position:50% align:center
They're treated better
than the other parents.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.522 position:50% align:center
The Rat has special status
in the zodiac, you know.

00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:44.607 position:50% align:center
[SOMA WOMAN A] And they did
essentially sell their child

00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:45.734 position:50% align:center
to the family head.

00:08:45.817 --> 00:08:47.986 position:50% align:center
[SOMA WOMAN B]
So very eager to please.

00:08:48.069 --> 00:08:49.404 position:50% align:center
[SOMA WOMAN A]
Right?

00:08:49.487 --> 00:08:52.907 position:50% align:center
Sacrificing their son like
that--I could never do it.

00:08:52.991 --> 00:08:55.243 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Nobody was going to rescue me.

00:08:55.326 --> 00:08:57.996 position:50% align:center
Certainly not my parents.

00:08:58.079 --> 00:09:02.125 position:50% align:center
Everything was working
out so well for them.

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:06.254 position:50% align:center
Among the Somas,
my parents were "winners."

00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:12.719 position:50% align:center
So, how's school treating
you, Yuki? Having fun?

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:14.346 position:50% align:center
There's no point asking.

00:09:14.429 --> 00:09:17.098 position:50% align:center
The boy has no
opinions of his own.

00:09:17.182 --> 00:09:19.476 position:50% align:center
You'd think we'd be seeing
better results by now.

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:22.729 position:50% align:center
His school is superior to
the other zodiac children's.

00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:25.857 position:50% align:center
You can drop me off first.
And I'll be home late.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.442 position:50% align:center
[DRIVER A]
Yes, ma'am.

00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:32.947 position:50% align:center
Hey! What're you doing? Let go!
Stop it, you little pest!

00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:37.452 position:50% align:center
[YUKI'S MOTHER]
Yuki, sit as you're supposed to.

00:09:41.998 --> 00:09:45.752 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Elementary school
was difficult for me.

00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:49.047 position:50% align:center
I kept to myself as much
as I was able to.

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.591 position:50% align:center
Even if I'd tried,
I would've had no idea

00:09:51.675 --> 00:09:53.718 position:50% align:center
how to talk to the other kids.

00:09:53.802 --> 00:09:56.471 position:50% align:center
I didn't want them
to hate me, too.

00:09:56.554 --> 00:10:00.517 position:50% align:center
But then one day,
something changed.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.519 position:50% align:center
[SCHOOLBOY A]
Come play with us!

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.772 position:50% align:center
Hanging out alone
must get pretty boring.

00:10:05.855 --> 00:10:07.816 position:50% align:center
It's soccer time. Let's go!

00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:09.317 position:50% align:center
Um, I can't.

00:10:09.401 --> 00:10:11.194 position:50% align:center
[SCHOOLBOY A]
Sure ya can. Come on!

00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:13.571 position:50% align:center
Don'tcha want to be friends?

00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:16.199 position:50% align:center
We can be friends?

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:17.367 position:50% align:center
Yeah, totally!

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.786 position:50% align:center
Right! Come on, Yuki!

00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:26.668 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Friends.

00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:30.755 position:50% align:center
For the first time...
I have friends.

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:35.969 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I was happy. Utterly elated.

00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:39.556 position:50% align:center
Such an unfamiliar emotion.

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:42.600 position:50% align:center
Some of these friends
were actually Somas,

00:10:42.684 --> 00:10:47.272 position:50% align:center
and we decided to go out
and explore the estate.

00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:49.649 position:50% align:center
I got carried away.

00:10:49.733 --> 00:10:51.192 position:50% align:center
I was having so much fun,

00:10:51.276 --> 00:10:54.320 position:50% align:center
I forgot to keep my
distance from the girls.

00:10:56.072 --> 00:10:58.199 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
It was a huge incident.

00:10:58.283 --> 00:11:02.579 position:50% align:center
In the end, my friends had
their memories erased.

00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:06.458 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
A person turning into a rat

00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:09.377 position:50% align:center
is obviously something
no one would understand.

00:11:09.461 --> 00:11:11.713 position:50% align:center
People would be sickened
by your existence

00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:14.799 position:50% align:center
and they'd begin to
avoid you at all costs.

00:11:14.883 --> 00:11:17.177 position:50% align:center
You would be utterly alone.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.138 position:50% align:center
Is that what you want?

00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:23.016 position:50% align:center
Didn't I tell you?

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:25.769 position:50% align:center
Don't delude yourself, fool.

00:11:27.228 --> 00:11:28.897 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Please!

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.900 position:50% align:center
Please, don't erase
their memories.

00:11:31.983 --> 00:11:35.820 position:50% align:center
They're the first friends
I've ever made!

00:11:35.904 --> 00:11:38.573 position:50% align:center
The only ones I have.

00:11:38.656 --> 00:11:41.076 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
They'd begin to avoid you.

00:11:44.245 --> 00:11:46.039 position:50% align:center
[SCHOOLBOY B]
Ha-ha! Yeah, right!

00:11:46.122 --> 00:11:47.165 position:50% align:center
[SCHOOLBOY A]
It's true!

00:11:47.248 --> 00:11:48.541 position:50% align:center
Let's go check it out
on the way home!

00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:49.459 position:50% align:center
[SCHOOLBOY B]
Okay!

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:50.835 position:50% align:center
[SCHOOLBOY B laughs]

00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:52.545 position:50% align:center
[SCHOOLBOY A]
You're gonna be so surprised!

00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:54.047 position:50% align:center
[SCHOOLBOY B]
Really?

00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:01.096 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Master, wait!

00:12:01.179 --> 00:12:03.223 position:50% align:center
My hat flew--

00:12:06.685 --> 00:12:07.894 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:10.313 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Um, your hat...

00:12:10.397 --> 00:12:11.815 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.990 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
There was something I wanted.

00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:25.704 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Parents who would embrace me.

00:12:25.787 --> 00:12:28.623 position:50% align:center
A home I liked returning to.

00:12:28.707 --> 00:12:32.335 position:50% align:center
A place where everyone smiled.

00:12:32.419 --> 00:12:36.965 position:50% align:center
A version of myself that
people wouldn't avoid.

00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:44.180 position:50% align:center
[YUKI crying]

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:50.562 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I wanted it. I yearned for it.

00:12:54.983 --> 00:12:56.234 position:50% align:center
[YUKI coughs]

00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:59.112 position:50% align:center
[AKITO] He's weak and
his cough's gotten worse.

00:12:59.195 --> 00:13:00.572 position:50% align:center
He doesn't need to lie down?

00:13:00.655 --> 00:13:02.532 position:50% align:center
No, propped up like
this is better.

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:04.701 position:50% align:center
It will help ease his breathing.

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:06.828 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
I feel so bad for him.

00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:09.539 position:50% align:center
Can I at least keep him
company for a little bit?

00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:13.293 position:50% align:center
[HEAD SERVANT A] You've got
such a kind heart, Akito.

00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:17.422 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:20.258 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Are you going to die, Yuki?

00:13:20.342 --> 00:13:23.386 position:50% align:center
Well... are you?

00:13:25.347 --> 00:13:27.640 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
You're no fun at all.

00:13:29.559 --> 00:13:32.062 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Was it my body
that was slowly weakening,

00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:33.980 position:50% align:center
or something else?

00:13:34.064 --> 00:13:36.066 position:50% align:center
Like my soul?

00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:37.734 position:50% align:center
[SERVANT B] His parents aren't
going to come to see

00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:39.069 position:50% align:center
how he's doing?

00:13:39.152 --> 00:13:40.695 position:50% align:center
Not anytime soon.

00:13:40.779 --> 00:13:42.781 position:50% align:center
They're off on a trip somewhere.

00:13:42.864 --> 00:13:45.241 position:50% align:center
[SERVANT B] All right.
Then what about Ayame?

00:13:45.325 --> 00:13:48.286 position:50% align:center
[SERVANT A]
He just said, "Oh?" That was it.

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:51.664 position:50% align:center
[SERVANT B] It's like he doesn't
even remember he has a brother.

00:13:51.748 --> 00:13:53.375 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
You know Kyo?

00:13:53.458 --> 00:13:56.586 position:50% align:center
The kid with the orange hair
who's got the Cat spirit?

00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:00.799 position:50% align:center
A few years ago,
his mom killed herself.

00:14:00.882 --> 00:14:04.636 position:50% align:center
Officially, they said it was
an accident, but it wasn't.

00:14:04.719 --> 00:14:07.764 position:50% align:center
Apparently, she
even left a note.

00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:10.558 position:50% align:center
She talked about how hard
it was to be near him.

00:14:10.642 --> 00:14:14.145 position:50% align:center
And how she'd've been happier
if she'd had a different child.

00:14:14.229 --> 00:14:16.856 position:50% align:center
"The Rat might not
have been so bad."

00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:20.235 position:50% align:center
So, he despises you now.

00:14:20.318 --> 00:14:22.070 position:50% align:center
You know what he said?

00:14:22.153 --> 00:14:24.698 position:50% align:center
At his mom's funeral,
he told his dad:

00:14:24.781 --> 00:14:27.992 position:50% align:center
"I'll kill Yuki,
then I'll kill myself."

00:14:28.076 --> 00:14:32.622 position:50% align:center
Oh, and then there's Hatsuharu.
He's the Ox. He hates you, too.

00:14:32.706 --> 00:14:34.374 position:50% align:center
He's a laughingstock, you know.

00:14:34.457 --> 00:14:37.419 position:50% align:center
And he believes it's
your fault, so...

00:14:37.502 --> 00:14:39.337 position:50% align:center
Ha. Must be rough.

00:14:39.421 --> 00:14:42.132 position:50% align:center
It sounds like
everyone detests you.

00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:46.386 position:50% align:center
You should just... drop off
the face of the earth!

00:14:55.061 --> 00:14:57.022 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Huh?

00:14:57.105 --> 00:15:00.483 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Even the dawn
light seemed dreary.

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:12.162 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I need to return this,
but he probably won't take it.

00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:14.247 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I didn't know his story.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.166 position:50% align:center
How much he must
have been hurting.

00:15:16.249 --> 00:15:17.959 position:50% align:center
None of it.

00:15:18.043 --> 00:15:19.210 position:50% align:center
If I did what he wanted

00:15:19.294 --> 00:15:21.755 position:50% align:center
and dropped off the
face of the earth,

00:15:21.838 --> 00:15:25.842 position:50% align:center
would some of that pain
disappear with me?

00:15:27.719 --> 00:15:30.305 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Doesn't look good.

00:15:30.388 --> 00:15:36.561 position:50% align:center
If I go away, maybe for the
first time, I'll be useful.

00:15:36.644 --> 00:15:40.482 position:50% align:center
The world is dark.
Everyone hates me.

00:15:40.565 --> 00:15:42.400 position:50% align:center
If nobody needs me,

00:15:42.484 --> 00:15:47.322 position:50% align:center
then what reason is there
for me to even be here?

00:15:47.405 --> 00:15:49.741 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Are you going to die?

00:15:49.824 --> 00:15:53.620 position:50% align:center
Well... are you?

00:15:59.167 --> 00:16:00.794 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Something burst.

00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:04.673 position:50% align:center
Something inside
my heart tore open.

00:16:04.756 --> 00:16:06.132 position:50% align:center
I didn't think.

00:16:06.216 --> 00:16:09.969 position:50% align:center
I just desperately needed
to move--to run away.

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:14.766 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I'm not sure if
I wanted to hurt myself,

00:16:14.849 --> 00:16:17.310 position:50% align:center
or to escape the pain.

00:16:17.394 --> 00:16:19.229 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:19.312 --> 00:16:23.358 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Or maybe... just didn't
know when to give up.

00:16:23.441 --> 00:16:26.528 position:50% align:center
It was so early,
almost no one was around.

00:16:26.611 --> 00:16:28.613 position:50% align:center
I ran on and on.

00:16:28.697 --> 00:16:31.533 position:50% align:center
I kept running even
when it was painful.

00:16:32.826 --> 00:16:37.747 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I found myself in an area
I didn't know, but I kept going.

00:16:37.831 --> 00:16:39.833 position:50% align:center
Then I heard something
that made me stop.

00:16:39.916 --> 00:16:41.001 position:50% align:center
[KYOKO crying]

00:16:41.084 --> 00:16:42.961 position:50% align:center

Please lower your voice.

00:16:44.587 --> 00:16:47.007 position:50% align:center
[KYOKO] You want me to
lower my damn voice?

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:50.176 position:50% align:center
How can I do that when my
precious baby is missing?

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.721 position:50% align:center
Stop talking and help me
look for her already!

00:16:52.804 --> 00:16:54.889 position:50% align:center
Like I said, we need a
thorough description of her--

00:16:54.973 --> 00:16:56.099 position:50% align:center
You have one!

00:16:56.182 --> 00:16:57.350 position:50% align:center
I already told you,

00:16:57.434 --> 00:16:59.144 position:50% align:center
she's a cute girl with
a cute round hair tie,

00:16:59.227 --> 00:17:01.479 position:50% align:center
cute clothes, a cute voice,
and a cute little face!

--What more do you need?!
--[POLICE A] So much more!

She's so adorable--

00:17:05.608 --> 00:17:08.820 position:50% align:center
that alone could be reason
enough to kidnap her!

What'll I do?

00:17:10.613 --> 00:17:14.492 position:50% align:center
If anything were to happen
to my sweet girl, I would...

00:17:14.576 --> 00:17:16.202 position:50% align:center
...have to kill someone!

00:17:16.286 --> 00:17:19.706 position:50% align:center

Um, please calm down, ma'am!

00:17:20.957 --> 00:17:22.375 position:50% align:center

[POLICE A]
Uh, please.

00:17:25.837 --> 00:17:27.130 position:50% align:center
It's a better idea for
you to wait at home.

No!

She's really upset.

around here...

Oh, no, she's following me!

What should I do?

00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:02.749 position:50% align:center

Right now,

she's entrusting her
entire world to me.

00:18:35.907 --> 00:18:37.117 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Huh?

00:18:44.249 --> 00:18:46.793 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Mommy? Mommy!

00:18:46.876 --> 00:18:48.920 position:50% align:center
Mommy!

00:18:49.004 --> 00:18:50.046 position:50% align:center
Tohru?

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:52.090 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU crying]

00:18:52.173 --> 00:18:52.841 position:50% align:center
[KYOKO]
Tohru!

00:18:52.924 --> 00:18:54.926 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Mommy!

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:57.721 position:50% align:center
[BOTH crying]

00:18:57.804 --> 00:19:00.932 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Good. I'm glad.

00:19:01.016 --> 00:19:04.019 position:50% align:center
Was I actually useful for once?

00:19:06.187 --> 00:19:08.857 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I think I was.

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:12.318 position:50% align:center
That makes me so happy.

00:19:12.402 --> 00:19:15.572 position:50% align:center
Because...
I'll always have this.

00:19:15.655 --> 00:19:17.490 position:50% align:center
No matter what,

00:19:17.574 --> 00:19:21.119 position:50% align:center
I'll know that there was
a moment when I mattered.

00:19:21.202 --> 00:19:24.539 position:50% align:center
When someone else... needed me.

00:19:24.622 --> 00:19:27.167 position:50% align:center
Even if nobody remembers...

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:31.463 position:50% align:center
Even if you forget, I'll know.

00:19:31.546 --> 00:19:35.091 position:50% align:center
There was, definitely.

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:40.472 position:50% align:center
[HEAD SERVANT A gasps]

00:19:40.555 --> 00:19:43.183 position:50% align:center
[SERVANT A] Yuki, where in
the world have you been?

00:19:43.266 --> 00:19:46.311 position:50% align:center
[HEAD SERVANT A] Not now.
The doctor. Call him at once!

00:19:46.394 --> 00:19:48.271 position:50% align:center
[SERVANT A]
Yes, ma'am.

00:19:48.355 --> 00:19:52.942 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] This world isn't
all brightness and light.

00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:55.945 position:50% align:center
But it's not all dark either.

00:19:57.322 --> 00:20:01.868 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] There's more than just
darkness. I know that now.

00:20:01.951 --> 00:20:03.661 position:50% align:center
Much more.

00:20:04.621 --> 00:20:05.872 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
So...

00:20:05.955 --> 00:20:08.792 position:50% align:center
What's this pitiful,
pathetic secret of yours?

00:20:08.875 --> 00:20:11.461 position:50% align:center
You've been sittin'
there all quiet.

00:20:11.544 --> 00:20:16.007 position:50% align:center
Sorry. I got lost
in an old memory.

00:20:16.091 --> 00:20:18.259 position:50% align:center
It was a dark time in my life.

00:20:18.343 --> 00:20:19.803 position:50% align:center
I was abandoned by my parents

00:20:19.886 --> 00:20:23.765 position:50% align:center
and kept isolated from
the rest of the world.

00:20:23.848 --> 00:20:27.102 position:50% align:center
That's around when
I met Miss Honda.

00:20:27.185 --> 00:20:28.645 position:50% align:center
It was just once.

00:20:28.728 --> 00:20:32.273 position:50% align:center
We were really little,
and I didn't ask her name,

00:20:32.357 --> 00:20:36.111 position:50% align:center
so I didn't realize it was her
when we finally met again.

00:20:38.154 --> 00:20:42.701 position:50% align:center
That day, she gave me hope--
made me want to stay strong.

00:20:42.784 --> 00:20:46.538 position:50% align:center
'Cause the world's not all dark.

00:20:46.621 --> 00:20:51.668 position:50% align:center
But it didn't last.
In time, I got weak again.

00:20:51.751 --> 00:20:53.336 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
My soul did.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.964 position:50% align:center
I could see what was
happening, of course,

00:20:56.047 --> 00:20:58.216 position:50% align:center
but little by little,

00:20:58.299 --> 00:21:02.178 position:50% align:center
I began to lose the small
amount of ground I'd gained.

00:21:02.262 --> 00:21:05.974 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] The darkness was
immense and overwhelming.

00:21:06.057 --> 00:21:10.645 position:50% align:center
And in the end,
it twisted me, too.

00:21:10.729 --> 00:21:13.148 position:50% align:center
I'm an idiot.

00:21:13.231 --> 00:21:16.026 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Hope turned into despair.

00:21:16.109 --> 00:21:20.363 position:50% align:center
And adoration into envy.

00:21:20.447 --> 00:21:22.657 position:50% align:center
I wanted him to like me.

00:21:22.741 --> 00:21:25.326 position:50% align:center
For us to become friends.

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:27.537 position:50% align:center
That's all I wanted.

00:21:30.206 --> 00:21:34.711 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Ultimately,
I withdrew into my shell.

00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:39.257 position:50% align:center
As if by rejecting the world,
I could protect myself.

00:21:39.341 --> 00:21:41.426 position:50% align:center
I was lost.

00:21:41.509 --> 00:21:47.015 position:50% align:center
But then, she showed up again,
like she had so long before,

00:21:47.098 --> 00:21:50.560 position:50% align:center
to remind me of
what I'd forgotten.

00:21:50.643 --> 00:21:53.313 position:50% align:center
Always there, by my side,

00:21:53.396 --> 00:21:57.650 position:50% align:center
willing to listen to any stupid
thing I needed to talk about.

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:03.740 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] She didn't scold,
just heard me out.

00:22:03.823 --> 00:22:07.577 position:50% align:center
Over... and over.

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.914 position:50% align:center
Time and again, she accepted me.

00:22:12.665 --> 00:22:15.126 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
She's precious to me.

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:20.507 position:50% align:center
Like the sky--so close,
and yet... so far.

00:22:22.342 --> 00:22:24.135 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Like a mother.

00:23:57.395 --> 00:23:59.606 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
"That isn't what <i>I</i> want!"
