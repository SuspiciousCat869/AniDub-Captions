[YUKI]
I wanted to say sorry.

00:00:14.055 --> 00:00:16.057 position:50% align:center
You know, about my mom.

00:00:16.141 --> 00:00:19.728 position:50% align:center
Nah, don't worry.
I'll see you then.

00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:21.062 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:00:21.146 --> 00:00:23.857 position:50% align:center
Uh. Hey, Yuki.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.775 position:50% align:center
What's up? Is something wrong?

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.694 position:50% align:center
Oh, my mom just decided
to reschedule

00:00:27.777 --> 00:00:31.156 position:50% align:center
our parent-teacher conference
at the last minute.

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:33.575 position:50% align:center
Honestly.

00:00:33.658 --> 00:00:36.745 position:50% align:center
Still, I guess it's a miracle
that she's coming at all.

00:00:36.828 --> 00:00:38.121 position:50% align:center
So there's that.

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:40.540 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Stop thinking you're special.

00:00:40.623 --> 00:00:43.335 position:50% align:center
The zodiac members will
come back to me in the end--

00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:45.045 position:50% align:center
every last one.

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:48.757 position:50% align:center
As it should be.
Forever unchanging.

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:53.428 position:50% align:center
Hey. It's not about
her, you know?

00:00:53.511 --> 00:00:54.971 position:50% align:center
The conference, I mean.

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:58.350 position:50% align:center
It's supposed to be a chance to
think about your own future.

00:00:58.433 --> 00:01:01.561 position:50% align:center
So, um, I guess what
I'm saying is...

00:01:01.644 --> 00:01:04.981 position:50% align:center
Do your best, okay?

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:06.524 position:50% align:center
[AKITO]
Mind your own business.

00:01:06.608 --> 00:01:07.400 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
No!

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:08.943 position:50% align:center
I won't mind my own business!

00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:10.528 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:01:10.612 --> 00:01:12.072 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
It was finally time for our

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:15.158 position:50% align:center
parent-teacher
conferences to begin!

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:48.001 position:50% align:center
I wanna land myself
a full-time job.

00:02:48.084 --> 00:02:51.087 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure how long Pops's
income is gonna cut it.

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:53.423 position:50% align:center
Hey, I bring in a decent amount.

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:56.843 position:50% align:center
Okay. There any particular
job you're interested in?

00:02:56.926 --> 00:02:59.137 position:50% align:center
I haven't given it much thought.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.681 position:50% align:center
Uo- <i>chan</i> , you should
totally become a model.

00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:03.224 position:50% align:center
Just think of how
cool it would be.

00:03:03.308 --> 00:03:05.101 position:50% align:center
Yeah? Think so?

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:06.603 position:50% align:center
Right. I'll become a model.

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:08.271 position:50% align:center
What?! A model?

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:10.732 position:50% align:center
Feel free to think it
over a little more.

00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:13.985 position:50% align:center
It was tough,
but I've decided...

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.404 position:50% align:center
...my goal is... to graduate.

00:03:16.488 --> 00:03:17.947 position:50% align:center
You can aim higher than that!

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:20.784 position:50% align:center
Whether or not that happens
is gonna be up to you.

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:23.411 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Some of us know what we
want the future to look like.

00:03:23.495 --> 00:03:24.662 position:50% align:center
Some of us don't.

00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:27.832 position:50% align:center
But we're all graduating
in a little over a year.

00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:29.167 position:50% align:center
[CLASSMATE E]
Uh! Did you see?

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.002 position:50% align:center
Who's the hot guy
in the fancy suit?

00:03:31.086 --> 00:03:34.047 position:50% align:center
Think Ms. Mayu- <i>chan</i> 's
gonna make a move?

00:03:35.674 --> 00:03:37.425 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:41.304 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] Yes! That's what
I was after! Pure loathing!

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:42.597 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Is everything all right?

00:03:42.681 --> 00:03:44.140 position:50% align:center
Oh. Yeah. I'm sorry.

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:46.643 position:50% align:center
I'd just heard that Mr. Soma
here had been very busy lately,

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:48.687 position:50% align:center
so I was a bit surprised.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.106 position:50% align:center
It was so thoughtful
of you to come today.

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:53.483 position:50% align:center
Thanks for making time
in your hectic schedule.

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:55.151 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Not at all.

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:58.905 position:50% align:center
I'm sure anybody else would've
done the same thing in my place.

00:03:59.948 --> 00:04:01.241 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
What is this?

00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:04.536 position:50% align:center
It's like a cold front blew
in from out of nowhere.

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:05.745 position:50% align:center
Now, why don't we start?

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.748 position:50% align:center
Uh! Right! That sounds
good, thank you!

00:04:08.832 --> 00:04:11.292 position:50% align:center
Let's see. You plan
to work right away?

00:04:11.376 --> 00:04:12.544 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Yes.

00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:14.212 position:50% align:center
You sure you don't want
to continue with school?

00:04:14.295 --> 00:04:16.172 position:50% align:center
There are still scholarships
you could apply for.

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:17.215 position:50% align:center
It's not too late.

00:04:17.298 --> 00:04:20.010 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Thank you, but I've decided.

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:22.554 position:50% align:center
I'm going to graduate
from high school first,

00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:24.472 position:50% align:center
then work full-time.

00:04:24.556 --> 00:04:26.349 position:50% align:center
That's the plan.

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:30.812 position:50% align:center
And you're going to move
out of Mr. Soma's house

00:04:30.895 --> 00:04:33.565 position:50% align:center
after you've graduated?

00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:35.275 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:04:35.358 --> 00:04:38.278 position:50% align:center
Here's a thought: Why not
stay and marry me instead?

00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:38.987 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Huh?

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.113 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO groans]

00:04:40.196 --> 00:04:42.699 position:50% align:center
I am 28 years old, after all.

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:44.659 position:50% align:center
At my age, you get a lot
of people telling you

00:04:44.743 --> 00:04:46.202 position:50% align:center
it's past time to settle down.

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:47.829 position:50% align:center
Well, it's just...

00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:49.289 position:50% align:center
No, that won't do.

00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:50.832 position:50% align:center
We ladies take
marriage proposals

00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:52.417 position:50% align:center
very seriously, you know.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.669 position:50% align:center
You can't just throw it
out there like that.

00:04:54.753 --> 00:04:57.505 position:50% align:center
At this rate, you'll never find
anybody to marry you.

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:59.716 position:50% align:center
What's this? Don't tell me.

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:01.301 position:50% align:center
You're the type who
sits around dreaming

00:05:01.384 --> 00:05:03.553 position:50% align:center
about receiving the
perfect proposal?

00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:07.807 position:50% align:center
You should be careful. You'll
waste all your best years.

00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:11.186 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Where's all this
diamond dust coming from?

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:12.062 position:50% align:center
Honda?

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:13.563 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Uh! Uh, yes, ma'am?

00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:16.024 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO] Let's go with your plan
to start working for now.

00:05:16.107 --> 00:05:17.275 position:50% align:center
But just remember,

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:18.985 position:50% align:center
there's still time to
change your mind, okay?

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:20.820 position:50% align:center
Um, sure.

00:05:20.904 --> 00:05:22.530 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO]
Honda.

00:05:22.614 --> 00:05:26.159 position:50% align:center
You know, you don't have
to bear it all alone.

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:29.245 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:30.830 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Are we finished already?

00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:32.957 position:50% align:center
I suppose time does fly.

00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:35.752 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Oh, um, thank you for
coming, Shigure. It really--

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:39.422 position:50% align:center
You go on, okay?
I need a moment more.

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:41.466 position:50% align:center
There's something I would like
to discuss with your teacher,

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:42.717 position:50% align:center
but it doesn't concern you.

00:05:42.801 --> 00:05:44.886 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:48.431 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] But, um, what about
all the diamond dust?

00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:51.893 position:50% align:center
I swear. You say the strangest
things sometimes, Tohru.

00:05:51.976 --> 00:05:53.186 position:50% align:center
Ugh!

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:55.522 position:50% align:center
Goodbye. I'll see ya later.

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:57.357 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Ahh.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.608 position:50% align:center
One glimpse of you
in teacher mode

00:05:58.692 --> 00:06:00.819 position:50% align:center
and I've fallen for
you all over again.

00:06:00.902 --> 00:06:03.238 position:50% align:center
Please. You're just
here to torture me.

00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:05.865 position:50% align:center
And you even had the nerve
to show up in Hatori's suit.

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:08.076 position:50% align:center
I'm amazed you
realized it's his!

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:10.203 position:50% align:center
Such is the power
of undying love.

00:06:10.286 --> 00:06:12.497 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO]
I hate him so much!

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.166 position:50% align:center
We really ought to try
to get along, you and I.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.420 position:50% align:center
After all, if you and the good
doctor get married someday,

00:06:18.503 --> 00:06:19.671 position:50% align:center
we'll be family.

00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:20.964 position:50% align:center
[grunts]

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:23.967 position:50% align:center
Well, good thing we
never got down and dirty.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.386 position:50% align:center
This is what you stayed
behind to tell me?

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:27.470 position:50% align:center
Yep! Sure is.

00:06:27.554 --> 00:06:29.806 position:50% align:center
Let's never speak of it again.

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:32.475 position:50% align:center
But I did wanna talk to you.
It's about Honda.

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:33.768 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Hm?

00:06:34.978 --> 00:06:37.605 position:50% align:center
Treat her with greater
care than you have been.

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:39.816 position:50% align:center
She's hardworking and selfless,

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:42.610 position:50% align:center
but she can't bear
every burden herself.

00:06:42.694 --> 00:06:46.239 position:50% align:center
Insightful of you, but I can't
tell how much you know.

00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:47.949 position:50% align:center
I heard something
similar recently

00:06:48.033 --> 00:06:50.618 position:50% align:center
from a relative of mine.

00:06:50.702 --> 00:06:53.705 position:50% align:center
[ISUZU] Are outsiders like
that girl people to you?

00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:57.417 position:50% align:center
Or are they just... things?

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:02.255 position:50% align:center
Like books fallen on the floor.
And scraps of paper.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.716 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
However it may seem,

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:06.760 position:50% align:center
I'd say I'm taking
excellent care of her,

00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:08.553 position:50% align:center
especially by my standards.

00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:09.596 position:50% align:center
Tch.

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:11.723 position:50% align:center
Well, time to raise
your standards.

00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:12.974 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE chuckles]

00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:15.769 position:50% align:center
That's asking too much.
I'm me, after all.

00:07:15.852 --> 00:07:18.813 position:50% align:center
You've heard the saying about
leopards and spots, haven't you?

00:07:18.897 --> 00:07:22.192 position:50% align:center
Besides, looking after her
isn't supposed to be my job.

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:24.194 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you would say that.

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:25.737 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I doubt
you're even kind

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.281 position:50% align:center
to the people you love, are you?

00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:31.618 position:50% align:center
Honda, I hope you never see

00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:33.703 position:50% align:center
the true darkness
of this man's soul.

00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:35.246 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on!

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.833 position:50% align:center
You're acting like I'm evil
incarnate or something, Mayu.

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:44.547 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
Tohru.

00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:45.256 position:50% align:center
Tohru!

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:46.299 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU gasps]

00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:47.801 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
What's got you so spacey?

00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:49.511 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's nothing, really.

00:07:49.594 --> 00:07:51.721 position:50% align:center
That isn't true.
Something's up.

00:07:51.805 --> 00:07:52.764 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU gasps]

00:07:52.847 --> 00:07:54.349 position:50% align:center
Your turbulent waves
gave you away.

00:07:54.432 --> 00:07:55.517 position:50% align:center
Yup.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.894 position:50% align:center
Please! It's nothing
serious, I promise!

00:07:57.977 --> 00:08:01.356 position:50% align:center
Just feeling a little anxious
after talking about the future.

00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:03.108 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:08:04.275 --> 00:08:07.404 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
No. It's not that.

00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:12.158 position:50% align:center
It's something... much deeper.

00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:17.205 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI] You're not alone
on that one, trust me.

00:08:17.288 --> 00:08:20.041 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's got me feelin'
pretty stressed, too.

00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:22.210 position:50% align:center
Pops says I gotta start
really thinking about

00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:23.795 position:50% align:center
what I'm gonna do.

00:08:23.878 --> 00:08:25.088 position:50% align:center
It is rough.

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:27.966 position:50% align:center
I've been told I'm
expected to graduate.

00:08:28.049 --> 00:08:31.428 position:50% align:center
Jeez, not exactly shooting
for the stars there, are ya?

00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:33.388 position:50% align:center
Listen, I know this is hard,

00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:36.266 position:50% align:center
but I also know you tend
to overthink things.

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:38.977 position:50% align:center
Don't stress out too much
about the future.

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.813 position:50% align:center
It's a waste of the time
you've got now.

00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:44.607 position:50% align:center
Plus, it worries me.

00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:46.735 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
If you focus on that too much,

00:08:46.818 --> 00:08:49.612 position:50% align:center
you'll trip over what's
right in front of you.

00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:53.742 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Yeah. I think you're right.

00:08:53.825 --> 00:08:55.577 position:50% align:center
It's time for some <i>somen</i> .

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.537 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
<i>Somen</i> ? That a joke?

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.164 position:50% align:center
Uh? No! I swear!

00:08:59.247 --> 00:09:01.791 position:50% align:center
I-It's just something
Shigure told me one time.

00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:03.335 position:50% align:center
"Sometimes you have
to take a break

00:09:03.418 --> 00:09:05.587 position:50% align:center
and eat <i>somen</i> with
your friends."

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:08.882 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
Really? Doesn't sound like him.

00:09:08.965 --> 00:09:12.844 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Uo- <i>chan</i> , Hana- <i>chan</i> .
Thank you both so much.

00:09:12.927 --> 00:09:14.804 position:50% align:center
I feel a lot better now.

00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:17.515 position:50% align:center
Please don't thank me. Really.

00:09:17.599 --> 00:09:20.101 position:50% align:center
I was simply trying to give you
a fraction of the comfort

00:09:20.185 --> 00:09:21.811 position:50% align:center
that you always give me.

00:09:21.895 --> 00:09:23.313 position:50% align:center
You mean it?

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:28.151 position:50% align:center
Hanajima, don't hog all the
credit. Ah, just forget it.

00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:31.905 position:50% align:center
Tohru, I wouldn't be too
trusting of that writer.

00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:34.157 position:50% align:center
Uh? Wh-What do you mean?

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.910 position:50% align:center
Let's just say the vibe
I get from him is pretty dark.

00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:38.036 position:50% align:center
He's quite twisted.

00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:39.079 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Uh?

00:09:39.162 --> 00:09:40.538 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, you're wrong.

00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:43.375 position:50% align:center
Shigure is such a kind
and considerate man.

00:09:43.458 --> 00:09:45.835 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI] Guess there's no
changing her mind at this point.

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:47.212 position:50% align:center
[HANAJIMA]
Maybe her blind trust

00:09:47.295 --> 00:09:49.589 position:50% align:center
will guilt him into
good behavior.

00:09:49.673 --> 00:09:54.094 position:50% align:center
Oh, my. It's Kyo Soma.
And who is that?

00:09:54.177 --> 00:09:57.430 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Master's here!
Oh, he's Kyo's dad!

00:09:57.514 --> 00:09:59.599 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
Seriously? That guy?

00:09:59.683 --> 00:10:02.519 position:50% align:center
I figured Carrots's dad would
be a redhead like him.

00:10:02.602 --> 00:10:03.770 position:50% align:center
Oh, well--

00:10:03.853 --> 00:10:05.438 position:50% align:center
He doesn't look anything
like Kyo, but he is--

00:10:05.522 --> 00:10:07.691 position:50% align:center
Incredibly handsome.

00:10:07.774 --> 00:10:09.150 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU, UOTANI gasp]

00:10:10.151 --> 00:10:13.780 position:50% align:center
[KYO] So, are you sayin' I've
gotta decide on a career now?

00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:15.240 position:50% align:center
Oh, no.

00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:16.700 position:50% align:center
But have you thought
about what you might want

00:10:16.783 --> 00:10:18.952 position:50% align:center
your future to look like?

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:21.121 position:50% align:center
My future.

00:10:22.247 --> 00:10:24.499 position:50% align:center
Honestly? I can't
really imagine him

00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:27.585 position:50% align:center
as a college student or working
full-time in an office.

00:10:27.669 --> 00:10:29.671 position:50% align:center
Uh, gee, thanks.

00:10:29.754 --> 00:10:31.256 position:50% align:center
Fair enough.

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:35.927 position:50% align:center
Aren't you gonna say something?

00:10:36.011 --> 00:10:37.554 position:50% align:center
I don't believe that
adults have the right

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:40.515 position:50% align:center
to deprive their children
of their free will.

00:10:40.598 --> 00:10:45.311 position:50% align:center
That said, I do believe that
we have the right to worry.

00:10:45.395 --> 00:10:47.188 position:50% align:center
Think it over, Kyo.

00:10:47.272 --> 00:10:50.191 position:50% align:center
It may take you twice as long
as it does your friends,

00:10:50.275 --> 00:10:51.693 position:50% align:center
and that's fine.

00:10:51.776 --> 00:10:54.738 position:50% align:center
But I'd like to know your
answer when you have it.

00:10:56.948 --> 00:11:00.869 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
It's close. So little time left.

00:11:00.952 --> 00:11:04.414 position:50% align:center
So little time.

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:08.960 position:50% align:center
Being with you,
every moment I can...

00:11:09.044 --> 00:11:12.213 position:50% align:center
That's the only thing I can
think about right now.

00:11:13.882 --> 00:11:15.175 position:50% align:center
Can't believe you
actually managed

00:11:15.258 --> 00:11:16.968 position:50% align:center
to catch that, ya mopey twerp.

00:11:17.052 --> 00:11:18.428 position:50% align:center
You're such a jerk, Uotani.

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:20.347 position:50% align:center
Shut your mouth and let's go.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:23.308 position:50% align:center
We're headin' to your house.
Might as well all walk together.

00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:25.602 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Yeah, um, you'll come, right?

00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:29.230 position:50% align:center
We're going to have a <i>somen</i>
party with everyone!

00:11:29.314 --> 00:11:33.485 position:50% align:center
[KYO] I guess nobody knows
what their answer will be yet.

00:11:34.652 --> 00:11:35.945 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Huh?

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:38.156 position:50% align:center
Wait, you're telling me that
Hanajima likes Sensei?

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:40.033 position:50% align:center
Although, I don't
know how I feel

00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:41.743 position:50% align:center
about him having an older child.

00:11:41.826 --> 00:11:44.579 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you'll be one big
happy family. Won't'cha?

00:11:44.662 --> 00:11:46.039 position:50% align:center
I hate you all.

00:11:46.122 --> 00:11:50.585 position:50% align:center
Hang on, a sec. Doesn't the
man in question get a say?

00:11:50.669 --> 00:11:52.712 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Until graduation.

00:11:52.796 --> 00:11:55.548 position:50% align:center
I have that long, at least.

00:11:55.632 --> 00:11:56.633 position:50% align:center
[YUKI'S MOTHER]
It's not like you have

00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:58.968 position:50% align:center
something else to do
that day, right?

00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:01.429 position:50% align:center
I'm very busy you know.

00:12:01.513 --> 00:12:04.265 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I heard my mother's
voice over the phone.

00:12:04.349 --> 00:12:06.810 position:50% align:center
As sharp and cold
as it was in person.

00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:08.186 position:50% align:center
[YUKI'S MOTHER]
Nothing else?

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:10.355 position:50% align:center
Good, I'll see you then.

00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:15.735 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] And just like that, those
feelings came rushing back.

00:12:15.819 --> 00:12:20.407 position:50% align:center
I'm sinking. I'm falling.

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:24.160 position:50% align:center
Everything is
turning dark again.

00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:46.016 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Mom, will you please
just take me home?

00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:47.976 position:50% align:center
I don't like being in that room.

00:12:48.059 --> 00:12:49.978 position:50% align:center
Akito's always saying
such scary stuff!

00:12:50.061 --> 00:12:51.229 position:50% align:center
My.

00:12:51.312 --> 00:12:53.356 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I just wanna go home!

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.608 position:50% align:center
Don't make me go back in there.

00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:57.736 position:50% align:center
Please, Mom. Let's go.

00:12:57.819 --> 00:12:59.738 position:50% align:center
Help me!

00:12:59.821 --> 00:13:01.990 position:50% align:center
The family head's
taken a liking to you.

00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:04.034 position:50% align:center
Aren't you a lucky boy, Yuki?

00:13:04.117 --> 00:13:06.911 position:50% align:center
Make sure you don't do
anything to change that.

00:13:06.995 --> 00:13:08.496 position:50% align:center
Bye, now.

00:13:13.918 --> 00:13:15.253 position:50% align:center
[coughs]

00:13:19.007 --> 00:13:21.092 position:50% align:center
[YUKI'S MOTHER] I hope
I didn't keep you waiting.

00:13:21.176 --> 00:13:22.135 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO]
Not at all.

00:13:22.218 --> 00:13:24.095 position:50% align:center
[YUKI'S MOTHER]
Well, that's good.

00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:27.849 position:50% align:center
Now, if you don't mind,
I'd like to get started.

00:13:27.932 --> 00:13:29.851 position:50% align:center
Don't wanna waste more time.

00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:33.646 position:50% align:center
Though I don't really see
what there is to discuss.

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:34.981 position:50% align:center
Your son's future.

00:13:35.065 --> 00:13:36.775 position:50% align:center
That's been settled already.

00:13:36.858 --> 00:13:39.194 position:50% align:center
He'll be continuing his
education at one of the colleges

00:13:39.277 --> 00:13:40.820 position:50% align:center
I've selected for him.

00:13:40.904 --> 00:13:42.072 position:50% align:center
Yuki's a Soma,

00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:43.990 position:50% align:center
and he is expected to
assume a leadership role

00:13:44.074 --> 00:13:45.658 position:50% align:center
within the family in the future.

00:13:45.742 --> 00:13:47.619 position:50% align:center
It's essential that his
schooling reflect his status.

00:13:47.702 --> 00:13:48.787 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Wait. Hold on, what?

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:51.331 position:50% align:center
Why did you--?
You can't just decide that!

00:13:51.414 --> 00:13:53.792 position:50% align:center
You should be
thanking me right now.

00:13:53.875 --> 00:13:54.584 position:50% align:center
Ma'am, please.

00:13:54.668 --> 00:13:56.127 position:50% align:center
Well, isn't it true?

00:13:56.211 --> 00:13:59.089 position:50% align:center
You're practically incapable
of making your own decisions.

00:13:59.172 --> 00:14:00.423 position:50% align:center
When given the chance,

00:14:00.507 --> 00:14:02.967 position:50% align:center
you elected to attend
this obscure high school.

00:14:03.051 --> 00:14:06.262 position:50% align:center
Yuki, you've never had
your own opinions before,

00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:09.057 position:50% align:center
so don't try to pretend
like you've got one now.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.893 position:50% align:center
If this is your attempt to
rebel, it's a childish one.

00:14:11.976 --> 00:14:14.646 position:50% align:center
You need to get with the
program. It's time to grow up.

00:14:14.729 --> 00:14:17.565 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO]
Ma'am. Please stop.

00:14:17.649 --> 00:14:18.858 position:50% align:center
Let your son speak.

00:14:18.942 --> 00:14:20.151 position:50% align:center
I don't think this
kind of language

00:14:20.235 --> 00:14:21.653 position:50% align:center
is very helpful right now.

00:14:21.736 --> 00:14:22.737 position:50% align:center
[YUKI'S MOTHER chuckles]

00:14:22.821 --> 00:14:24.906 position:50% align:center
I don't know what you mean.

00:14:24.989 --> 00:14:26.157 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Say it.

00:14:26.241 --> 00:14:30.453 position:50% align:center
Find the right words.
Tell her what you think.

00:14:30.537 --> 00:14:31.830 position:50% align:center
[YUKI'S MOTHER] Did you
take offense to my calling

00:14:31.913 --> 00:14:33.248 position:50% align:center
this school "obscure"?

00:14:33.331 --> 00:14:35.875 position:50% align:center
No, ma'am. I honestly couldn't
care less about that.

00:14:35.959 --> 00:14:37.002 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Hurry up and say it.

00:14:37.085 --> 00:14:38.962 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing you
have no children yet.

00:14:39.045 --> 00:14:40.171 position:50% align:center
Life's simpler that way.

00:14:40.255 --> 00:14:41.214 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Hurry!

00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:42.716 position:50% align:center
Children always
complicate things...

00:14:42.799 --> 00:14:44.759 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Hurry! Hurry!

00:14:44.843 --> 00:14:46.344 position:50% align:center
...and selfish.

00:14:46.428 --> 00:14:49.139 position:50% align:center
We argued against our son coming
to this school, of course.

00:14:49.222 --> 00:14:52.267 position:50% align:center
He threw a fit like
a child losing a toy.

00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:56.104 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
That's not it.

00:14:56.187 --> 00:14:57.897 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
That's not it.

00:14:57.981 --> 00:15:01.109 position:50% align:center
I just want to go to a high
school outside, that's all.

00:15:01.192 --> 00:15:02.736 position:50% align:center
Nobody put me up
to it or anything.

00:15:02.819 --> 00:15:04.362 position:50% align:center
This is so abrupt, though.

00:15:04.446 --> 00:15:06.322 position:50% align:center
Where did you come up
with such an idea?

00:15:06.406 --> 00:15:09.659 position:50% align:center
I don't like the Soma family,
Mom. That isn't anything new.

00:15:09.743 --> 00:15:13.246 position:50% align:center
It's how I feel now
and how I've always felt.

00:15:13.329 --> 00:15:14.789 position:50% align:center
I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:15:14.873 --> 00:15:17.959 position:50% align:center
You haven't said anything like
that since you were a child.

00:15:19.419 --> 00:15:22.047 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Mom.

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:25.759 position:50% align:center
Am I... your tool?

00:15:25.842 --> 00:15:28.178 position:50% align:center
I don't see why it
could possibly matter.

00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:31.556 position:50% align:center
So what if you are a tool?

00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:35.185 position:50% align:center
That's enough! I already
have Ayame to deal with!

00:15:35.268 --> 00:15:38.521 position:50% align:center
The head of the family likes
you. What more do you want?

00:15:38.605 --> 00:15:40.482 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
What's the point?

00:15:40.565 --> 00:15:43.193 position:50% align:center
My words have no
power or meaning.

00:15:43.276 --> 00:15:47.781 position:50% align:center
They're fragile things that die
before they even reach you.

00:15:49.699 --> 00:15:54.120 position:50% align:center
I remember thinking... if it's
always going to be that way,

00:15:54.204 --> 00:15:56.623 position:50% align:center
I might as well
never speak again.

00:15:57.832 --> 00:16:01.127 position:50% align:center
Greetings, lovelies!
I've arrived.

00:16:01.211 --> 00:16:02.462 position:50% align:center
[ALL grunt]

00:16:02.545 --> 00:16:03.922 position:50% align:center
Forgive my tardiness.

00:16:04.005 --> 00:16:05.715 position:50% align:center
It was because of
the rain, you see.

00:16:05.799 --> 00:16:07.634 position:50% align:center
Not only does it prevent
one from waking,

00:16:07.717 --> 00:16:10.804 position:50% align:center
but it also renders one's
hair impossible to style.

00:16:10.887 --> 00:16:13.640 position:50% align:center
I know you must've been worried,
Yuki, but never fear!

00:16:13.723 --> 00:16:15.809 position:50% align:center
You can rest easy now that
your brother has come

00:16:15.892 --> 00:16:18.269 position:50% align:center
to lend you the support
of his undying love.

00:16:18.353 --> 00:16:19.604 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:19.688 --> 00:16:20.814 position:50% align:center
[YUKI'S MOTHER yelps]

00:16:20.897 --> 00:16:23.525 position:50% align:center
What on Earth do you
think you're doing here?

00:16:23.608 --> 00:16:25.151 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
These roses are for you.

00:16:25.235 --> 00:16:27.987 position:50% align:center
A token of appreciation for
the dual roles you fill.

00:16:28.071 --> 00:16:29.656 position:50% align:center
As a guide to
shepherd my brother

00:16:29.739 --> 00:16:31.032 position:50% align:center
through his high school years,

00:16:31.116 --> 00:16:34.452 position:50% align:center
and as a romantic figure
to feed his fantasies.

00:16:34.536 --> 00:16:36.454 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO]
Uh, thanks.

00:16:36.538 --> 00:16:39.124 position:50% align:center
Let us tarry no longer but
begin this conference at once!

00:16:39.207 --> 00:16:40.917 position:50% align:center
Enough! Explain
yourself, Ayame!

00:16:41.001 --> 00:16:44.004 position:50% align:center
You're being rather distracting,
Mother. Please calm down.

00:16:44.087 --> 00:16:45.672 position:50% align:center
We're here to discuss
a weighty matter:

00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:47.716 position:50% align:center
Yuki's post-high school future.

00:16:47.799 --> 00:16:49.759 position:50% align:center
It'd be foolish to interfere
with the process.

00:16:49.843 --> 00:16:52.679 position:50% align:center
What?! You interfered just by
showing up in the first place!

00:16:52.762 --> 00:16:56.266 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I never realized that Mom
was so bad at handling Ayame.

00:16:56.349 --> 00:16:59.144 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO]
Aya has a power all his own.

00:16:59.227 --> 00:17:00.353 position:50% align:center
Leave right now!

00:17:00.437 --> 00:17:02.731 position:50% align:center
You have no business
meddling in Yuki's life.

00:17:02.814 --> 00:17:05.650 position:50% align:center
And since when do you care?
You've always ignored him.

00:17:05.734 --> 00:17:06.443 position:50% align:center
Now go.

00:17:06.526 --> 00:17:07.694 position:50% align:center
Too much time around you

00:17:07.777 --> 00:17:10.989 position:50% align:center
and he'll become as dumb
and useless as you are.

00:17:11.072 --> 00:17:15.035 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I can depend on him. On Ayame.

00:17:15.118 --> 00:17:19.247 position:50% align:center
He can be ridiculous and
over the top sometimes...

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:23.501 position:50% align:center
...but he isn't useless...
or dumb.

00:17:25.837 --> 00:17:28.214 position:50% align:center
Stop! Don't even think
about calling Hatori.

00:17:28.298 --> 00:17:30.884 position:50% align:center
[AYAME] I wouldn't do that.
I'm sending a text message.

00:17:30.967 --> 00:17:32.302 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
That's not any better!

00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:33.511 position:50% align:center
[YUKI'S MOTHER]
When did this happen?

00:17:33.595 --> 00:17:35.138 position:50% align:center
You two were never close.

00:17:35.221 --> 00:17:36.598 position:50% align:center
Oh, good.

00:17:36.681 --> 00:17:39.642 position:50% align:center
We've conveyed the depth
of our brotherly love to you.

00:17:39.726 --> 00:17:41.936 position:50% align:center
I woke up, Mother.

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:46.149 position:50% align:center
And luckily, Yuki was willing
to give me another chance.

00:17:46.232 --> 00:17:47.484 position:50% align:center
Things are changing.

00:17:47.567 --> 00:17:49.110 position:50% align:center
Even the indifference
he felt toward you

00:17:49.194 --> 00:17:51.321 position:50% align:center
is becoming something more.

00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:54.991 position:50% align:center
You don't see it, but you
and I have something in common.

00:17:55.075 --> 00:17:57.202 position:50% align:center
You're like I used to be.

00:17:57.285 --> 00:17:59.662 position:50% align:center
You've beaten down and
trampled a thing for years,

00:17:59.746 --> 00:18:03.583 position:50% align:center
without realizing how
very precious it is.

00:18:03.667 --> 00:18:04.959 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:05.043 --> 00:18:07.003 position:50% align:center
You think you can speak
to your own mother that way?

00:18:07.087 --> 00:18:08.797 position:50% align:center
I deserve your respect!

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.423 position:50% align:center
I won't listen to this!

00:18:10.507 --> 00:18:12.175 position:50% align:center
You have no clue
what I've been through!

00:18:12.258 --> 00:18:14.219 position:50% align:center
If I'd known you'd
turn out this way,

00:18:14.302 --> 00:18:17.681 position:50% align:center
I never would've
given birth to you two!

00:18:17.764 --> 00:18:19.057 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
Leave her be.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.226 position:50% align:center
There's no talking to her
when she gets like this.

00:18:21.309 --> 00:18:23.812 position:50% align:center
You'd only waste your breath.

00:18:23.895 --> 00:18:26.398 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Do your best, okay?

00:18:26.481 --> 00:18:28.650 position:50% align:center
Do your best, Yuki.

00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:31.986 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
One sec. I'll talk to her.

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:35.156 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
Are you sure that's a good idea?

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.449 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Hey.

00:18:36.533 --> 00:18:39.452 position:50% align:center
I'm glad that you came today.

00:18:39.536 --> 00:18:41.079 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:48.169 position:50% align:center
All right, Tori, here
you go. Full report.

00:18:48.253 --> 00:18:50.380 position:50% align:center
Wasn't sure if you were
gonna make it or not.

00:18:50.463 --> 00:18:52.007 position:50% align:center
With the date change and all.

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:53.717 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
Gure informed me.

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.011 position:50% align:center
[groans] Will I never
be free of him?

00:18:56.094 --> 00:18:58.555 position:50% align:center
[AYAME] I can't imagine this
was easy on you, either.

00:18:58.638 --> 00:19:01.141 position:50% align:center
Our mother really is
something else, isn't she?

00:19:01.224 --> 00:19:03.560 position:50% align:center
Perhaps her biggest weakness
is her insatiable appetite

00:19:03.643 --> 00:19:05.270 position:50% align:center
for money and status.

00:19:05.353 --> 00:19:07.147 position:50% align:center
Oh, and her inability to handle

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:09.733 position:50% align:center
my regal temperament
and natural charisma.

00:19:09.816 --> 00:19:14.320 position:50% align:center
It is a truly unfortunate flaw,
especially in a parent.

00:19:14.404 --> 00:19:16.156 position:50% align:center
If she'd been able to
make something of me,

00:19:16.239 --> 00:19:19.075 position:50% align:center
she might not expect
so much of Yuki now.

00:19:19.159 --> 00:19:22.078 position:50% align:center
So I suppose this is
partially my fault.

00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:27.167 position:50% align:center
Still, though, he said
he could depend on you.

00:19:29.044 --> 00:19:30.670 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Mom, wait!

00:19:30.754 --> 00:19:32.005 position:50% align:center
Wait!

00:19:33.131 --> 00:19:36.051 position:50% align:center
You know, if you
continue like this,

00:19:36.134 --> 00:19:38.970 position:50% align:center
you'll achieve nothing
in your life.

00:19:39.054 --> 00:19:40.972 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
So small.

00:19:41.056 --> 00:19:44.809 position:50% align:center
Is that new, or has she
always been like this?

00:19:44.893 --> 00:19:47.687 position:50% align:center
Her shoulder is so thin.

00:19:47.771 --> 00:19:51.608 position:50% align:center
When I was young, it felt like
she was larger than life.

00:19:53.318 --> 00:19:57.238 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I thought that if she
abandoned me, rejected me,

00:19:57.322 --> 00:20:00.825 position:50% align:center
everything would turn dark.

00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:04.704 position:50% align:center
Without her...
it would all be over.

00:20:05.622 --> 00:20:10.752 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Mom, I'm real. A person.

00:20:10.835 --> 00:20:15.882 position:50% align:center
A living part of this
world. Not just a prop.

00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:20.261 position:50% align:center
But being part of the world
means putting in effort,

00:20:20.345 --> 00:20:22.347 position:50% align:center
and that's what I intend to do.

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:24.516 position:50% align:center
To try.

00:20:24.599 --> 00:20:27.102 position:50% align:center
I'm well aware the result
may not be something

00:20:27.185 --> 00:20:29.938 position:50% align:center
you appreciate or agree with,

00:20:30.021 --> 00:20:34.734 position:50% align:center
but at least it'll be something
I can be proud of.

00:20:34.818 --> 00:20:38.905 position:50% align:center
So please, don't make
these decisions for me.

00:20:38.988 --> 00:20:41.241 position:50% align:center
Don't decide what my
life is going to be

00:20:41.324 --> 00:20:43.660 position:50% align:center
before I've even begun it.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.288 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I plan on going to college,

00:20:47.372 --> 00:20:50.291 position:50% align:center
but I'll choose the schools
I'll be applying to.

00:20:50.375 --> 00:20:51.918 position:50% align:center
Not you.

00:20:57.382 --> 00:20:58.842 position:50% align:center
[YUKI sighs]

00:21:07.892 --> 00:21:10.145 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:21:10.228 --> 00:21:13.064 position:50% align:center
There you are! I've been
looking all over for you!

00:21:13.148 --> 00:21:14.149 position:50% align:center
Hurry! You need to come with me!

00:21:14.232 --> 00:21:16.109 position:50% align:center
Wait. What? Right now?

00:21:16.192 --> 00:21:18.278 position:50% align:center
[NAOHITO]
Yes, it's an emergency!

00:21:22.824 --> 00:21:24.325 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
See ya later.

00:21:28.913 --> 00:21:31.332 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Yeah. See you.

00:21:34.085 --> 00:21:36.796 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
The rain may have cleared,

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.299 position:50% align:center
but there's still
a chill in the air.

00:21:39.382 --> 00:21:42.844 position:50% align:center
So I know that winter
is on its way.

00:21:42.927 --> 00:21:46.890 position:50% align:center
But... the warmth in
my chest tells me

00:21:46.973 --> 00:21:51.227 position:50% align:center
that the light remains even now.

00:21:51.311 --> 00:21:55.607 position:50% align:center
It's so tiny, the slightest
breeze might snuff it out.

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:59.861 position:50% align:center
Still weak, but
definitely there.

00:23:32.078 --> 00:23:33.496 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Commander!

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:35.331 position:50% align:center
At last we have found you!

00:23:35.415 --> 00:23:36.791 position:50% align:center
The one who was destined to lead

00:23:36.875 --> 00:23:39.210 position:50% align:center
our School Defense
Force to victory!

00:23:39.294 --> 00:23:41.629 position:50% align:center
An intriguing offer, indeed.

00:23:41.713 --> 00:23:44.883 position:50% align:center
Well, do something about him.
Nothing's getting done!

00:23:44.966 --> 00:23:48.053 position:50% align:center
Idiot. What the hell
are you doing?

00:23:48.136 --> 00:23:49.971 position:50% align:center
[AYAME]
Ah, Yuki! There you are.

00:23:50.055 --> 00:23:51.598 position:50% align:center
[HATORI]
Sorry about him.

00:23:51.681 --> 00:23:53.016 position:50% align:center
I feel worse for you.

00:23:53.099 --> 00:23:55.435 position:50% align:center
Is it always like this
when he's around?

00:23:57.604 --> 00:23:59.522 position:50% align:center
[MOMO]
"Ask him for me."
