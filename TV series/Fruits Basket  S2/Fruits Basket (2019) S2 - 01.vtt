[MOTOKO sighs]

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:21.354 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO]
I love Yuki.

00:00:21.438 --> 00:00:23.940 position:50% align:center
I love his hair and
the way it gleams,

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:26.735 position:50% align:center
silver in the sunlight.

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:31.197 position:50% align:center
His dusky lashes and the shadows
they cast on his cheeks.

00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:35.118 position:50% align:center
His dignified,
penetrating voice.

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:39.914 position:50% align:center
Everything about Yuki
is everything to me.

00:00:39.998 --> 00:00:41.416 position:50% align:center
But...

00:00:43.793 --> 00:00:46.755 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO]
She came out of nowhere.

00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:48.840 position:50% align:center
An interfering interloper

00:00:48.923 --> 00:00:52.093 position:50% align:center
determined to
confound all my plans.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.350 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO]
Absolutely unacceptable.

00:00:58.433 --> 00:01:01.895 position:50% align:center
I will not allow other women
free access to Yuki.

00:01:01.978 --> 00:01:04.814 position:50% align:center
They must all be kept at bay.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.870 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Hello again! Tohru Honda here!

00:02:43.621 --> 00:02:44.873 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Almost a year has passed

00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:47.459 position:50% align:center
since I came to stay at
Shigure Soma's house,

00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:51.087 position:50% align:center
and it's been pretty eventful.

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:52.839 position:50% align:center
I'd lost my mom.

00:02:52.922 --> 00:02:56.343 position:50% align:center
I was living on my own
in a tent, which was okay,

00:02:56.426 --> 00:03:01.056 position:50% align:center
but then the Somas found me
and offered to take me in.

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.016 position:50% align:center
The family has a secret, though.

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:04.851 position:50% align:center
They transform into
zodiac animals

00:03:04.934 --> 00:03:07.687 position:50% align:center
when hugged by the opposite sex.

00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:09.189 position:50% align:center
Living here has
been an adventure

00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:10.940 position:50% align:center
from the very beginning.

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:14.110 position:50% align:center
I've met a lotta the Somas now,
and they're all so different.

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:16.488 position:50% align:center
Some are loud, some are shy,

00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:19.616 position:50% align:center
but they're all so kind
in their own way.

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:24.579 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Still, I can feel
the sadness they carry

00:03:24.662 --> 00:03:29.709 position:50% align:center
wherever they go, buried
deep inside their hearts.

00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:31.628 position:50% align:center
Especially Kyo.

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:33.755 position:50% align:center
He's possessed by
the spirit of the Cat,

00:03:33.838 --> 00:03:36.716 position:50% align:center
who was shunned by the
other zodiac animals.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.845 position:50% align:center
Even among the Somas,
he's special.

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:43.723 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure what
someone like me can do,

00:03:43.807 --> 00:03:47.602 position:50% align:center
but I wanna help them all
in whatever way I can.

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:54.275 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] If I keep trying,
maybe someday I'll understand...

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.112 position:50% align:center
...the true nature of the curse.

00:03:57.195 --> 00:03:59.155 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Summer break approaches.

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.116 position:50% align:center
You children are so lucky.

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:03.535 position:50% align:center
Adulthood offers
no such reprieve.

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:05.412 position:50% align:center
Better enjoy it while you can.

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:08.164 position:50% align:center
You've gotta be kidding.
What are you whining about?

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:10.375 position:50% align:center
Your whole life's
a freaking vacation.

00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:13.753 position:50% align:center
Ha. Alas, not true.

00:04:13.837 --> 00:04:15.547 position:50% align:center
This paltry freedom
we adults have

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.299 position:50% align:center
can't compare to a society-
sanctioned summer break.

00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:20.343 position:50% align:center
Yeah, whatever.

00:04:20.427 --> 00:04:21.636 position:50% align:center
You'll understand all too well

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.222 position:50% align:center
once you've got a job
of your own, trust me.

00:04:24.305 --> 00:04:25.765 position:50% align:center
But you know,

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:28.059 position:50% align:center
I'm sure we'll have lots of
homework to do over the break.

00:04:28.143 --> 00:04:30.228 position:50% align:center
So, I'll have to try hard.

00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:32.772 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] It breaks my heart to
see you this worried, Tohru,

00:04:32.856 --> 00:04:35.233 position:50% align:center
so let me give you
a piece of advice.

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:38.653 position:50% align:center
Talk to our faultless Yuki
and ask very politely

00:04:38.737 --> 00:04:40.238 position:50% align:center
if you can copy his homework.

00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:42.991 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] Huh?! No, no! I could
never do something like that!

00:04:43.074 --> 00:04:45.160 position:50% align:center
Right. Because he's so perfect.

00:04:45.243 --> 00:04:48.913 position:50% align:center
More like boring and robotic.
The guy's just lame.

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:50.290 position:50% align:center
--[KYO yells]
--[TOHRU] Kyo!

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:51.750 position:50% align:center
Better than being stupid.

00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:53.335 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Uh, is he--?

00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:56.212 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] Never fear. It'll take
far more than that to kill Kyo.

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:57.547 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Unfortunately.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:58.590 position:50% align:center
Bastard!

00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:00.050 position:50% align:center
There, see?
He's still breathing.

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:02.802 position:50% align:center
If you're gonna attack,
do it head-on. Dirty cheater!

00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:04.929 position:50% align:center
You'd have known I was there
if you weren't so stupid.

00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:06.973 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Stop calling me stupid!

00:05:07.057 --> 00:05:09.809 position:50% align:center
Please! Don't fight, you guys!
I don't want you getting hurt!

00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:11.478 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
Then watch what you're doing!

00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:13.772 position:50% align:center
Heading out now,
Yuki? It's early.

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:17.317 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I've got student
council business.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.985 position:50% align:center
So, see ya later?

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:21.696 position:50% align:center
Right. Have a good day.

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:27.202 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Well, I suppose I do have

00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:28.912 position:50% align:center
one consolation this summer.

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:30.830 position:50% align:center
I'll get the pleasure of
watching things play out

00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:32.582 position:50% align:center
between you crazy kids.

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:33.750 position:50% align:center
What do you mean by that?

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:34.459 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE chuckles]

00:05:34.542 --> 00:05:36.044 position:50% align:center
I can't wait!

00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:39.297 position:50% align:center
You three have gotten so close.
I can almost taste the drama!

00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:41.800 position:50% align:center
Seriously, you've lost me.

00:05:41.883 --> 00:05:43.134 position:50% align:center
You should be ashamed!

00:05:43.218 --> 00:05:45.345 position:50% align:center
I've seen rocks that are
less dense than this.

00:05:45.428 --> 00:05:48.431 position:50% align:center
The summer dream is utterly
wasted on the likes of you!

00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:50.684 position:50% align:center
Either start making sense
or stop talking!

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:54.104 position:50% align:center
It's no use. Sorry.
I'm afraid Kyo is a lost cause.

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:56.940 position:50% align:center
The poor fool has no
potential whatsoever!

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:58.900 position:50% align:center
All I know right now is
you're messing with me

00:05:58.983 --> 00:06:00.735 position:50% align:center
and I don't like it.

00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:06.616 position:50% align:center
[KYO]
The guy's just lame.

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:11.746 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Yeah, well.
I knew that already.

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:16.626 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO]
Makoto!

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.378 position:50% align:center
You should know,
I've come prepared

00:06:18.461 --> 00:06:20.797 position:50% align:center
to drag the information
out of you.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.590 position:50% align:center
Give me the names of
the new board members

00:06:22.674 --> 00:06:26.219 position:50% align:center
Yuki will be leading next year
as student council president.

00:06:26.302 --> 00:06:29.764 position:50% align:center
[TAKEI] Hmph. You're like
a dog with a bone, Motoko.

00:06:29.848 --> 00:06:32.350 position:50% align:center
Why on earth would I tell you
when your reasons for asking

00:06:32.434 --> 00:06:35.812 position:50% align:center
are so obviously personal ones?

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:38.857 position:50% align:center
Are there any females
among the new members?

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.233 position:50% align:center
That's all we care about.

00:06:40.316 --> 00:06:42.402 position:50% align:center
Tell us and we'll
leave you in peace.

00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:44.821 position:50% align:center
Have you considered
the repercussions?

00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:47.824 position:50% align:center
Suppose one of them turns out
to be a devious temptress

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:52.537 position:50% align:center
who works her wiles on
our unsuspecting Yuki?

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.123 position:50% align:center
[TAKEI] With all due respect,
my sole concern

00:06:55.206 --> 00:06:57.876 position:50% align:center
is that the board members
capably support Yuki.

00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:00.337 position:50% align:center
Gender is irrelevant.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.049 position:50% align:center
Indeed! If I could, I'd ask
to be held back a grade!

00:07:04.132 --> 00:07:06.259 position:50% align:center
I would remain here to
offer our new president

00:07:06.343 --> 00:07:09.012 position:50% align:center
the unquestionable loyalty
and unwavering devotion

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:10.513 position:50% align:center
that is his due!

00:07:10.597 --> 00:07:12.724 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO] And if possible, I
would have Yuki skip a grade

00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:15.143 position:50% align:center
so we could experience
college life together,

00:07:15.226 --> 00:07:18.480 position:50% align:center
venturing hand in hand
into the great unknown!

00:07:18.563 --> 00:07:20.023 position:50% align:center
And there they go.

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:24.027 position:50% align:center
They'll probably keep at it
right up until graduation day.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.570 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGISHI sighs]

00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:27.989 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGISHI] President Takei
didn't give up a single name.

00:07:28.073 --> 00:07:29.407 position:50% align:center
What do we do now?

00:07:29.491 --> 00:07:31.868 position:50% align:center
Maybe we should sneak into
the student council room

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:33.703 position:50% align:center
and find the list ourselves.

00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:37.916 position:50% align:center
We must consider carefully.
He refused to reveal anything.

00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:41.086 position:50% align:center
Could that be a clue
in and of itself?

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:43.421 position:50% align:center
Should we take it as proof
that there is a rogue female

00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:44.506 position:50% align:center
among the new members?

00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:46.508 position:50% align:center
[ISHIHARA]
Uotani! There you are!

00:07:46.591 --> 00:07:48.760 position:50% align:center
Oh, no! Motoko- <i>senpai</i> !

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:51.888 position:50% align:center
[UOTANI]
Jeez. You're here again?

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:54.599 position:50% align:center
Stop wandering around
other people's schools.

00:07:54.683 --> 00:07:56.559 position:50% align:center
Have you at least been
going to classes?

00:07:56.643 --> 00:07:57.519 position:50% align:center
Of course we have...

00:07:57.602 --> 00:07:59.062 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO]
Minami, who are they?

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:00.105 position:50% align:center
[KINOSHITA]
I don't know.

00:08:00.188 --> 00:08:01.356 position:50% align:center
By the way they're acting,

00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:03.858 position:50% align:center
they must be Uotani's
underlings or something.

00:08:03.942 --> 00:08:06.361 position:50% align:center
Will someone please
tell me what's going on?!

00:08:06.444 --> 00:08:08.780 position:50% align:center
This school's been invaded
by a witch, a demon queen,

00:08:08.863 --> 00:08:10.407 position:50% align:center
and a flock of delinquents!

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.034 position:50% align:center
How many vile horrors must
our sweet, innocent Yuki

00:08:13.118 --> 00:08:14.703 position:50% align:center
--be exposed to?!
--It's so lively out here.

00:08:14.786 --> 00:08:16.246 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS scream]

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:18.331 position:50% align:center
Hey, check it out. I'm tryin'
something new with my brows.

00:08:18.415 --> 00:08:20.500 position:50% align:center
I almost dyed my hair.

00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:22.043 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:22.127 --> 00:08:23.920 position:50% align:center
What's that about?

00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:25.588 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I don't know.

00:08:28.258 --> 00:08:30.301 position:50% align:center
I wonder why we're meeting
in the counselor's office

00:08:30.385 --> 00:08:32.721 position:50% align:center
instead of the student
council room.

00:08:33.888 --> 00:08:36.641 position:50% align:center

[GIRL]
I'm sorry. I'll clean it up.

00:08:57.037 --> 00:08:59.873 position:50% align:center
Hey, are you all right?
If you're not feeling well--

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:04.461 position:50% align:center
I'm fine.

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:05.879 position:50% align:center
Hold on.

00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:10.425 position:50% align:center
[GIRL]
Manabe, get up.

00:09:10.508 --> 00:09:11.801 position:50% align:center
Somebody's here.

00:09:11.885 --> 00:09:14.262 position:50% align:center
[MANABE] If it's not an alien,
I'll keep sleeping.

00:09:14.346 --> 00:09:16.389 position:50% align:center
[GIRL]
It's Yuki Soma.

00:09:16.473 --> 00:09:17.974 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Huh?

00:09:19.142 --> 00:09:20.435 position:50% align:center
[MANABE screams]

00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:21.811 position:50% align:center
[MANABE] Why didn't you
wake me up sooner?!

00:09:21.895 --> 00:09:24.189 position:50% align:center
Now he knows I was slacking off!

00:09:24.272 --> 00:09:26.441 position:50% align:center
Which I wasn't. I'd never
do something like that.

00:09:26.524 --> 00:09:28.985 position:50% align:center
I was just deep in thought,
with my eyes closed.

00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:29.819 position:50% align:center
Are you--?

00:09:29.903 --> 00:09:30.904 position:50% align:center
Whoa, what a mess!

00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:33.365 position:50% align:center
Aw, man. Are you
at it again, Machi?

00:09:33.448 --> 00:09:35.784 position:50% align:center
You'd better start
cleanin' this up.

00:09:35.867 --> 00:09:36.409 position:50% align:center
[MANABE yells]

00:09:36.493 --> 00:09:37.035 position:50% align:center
[YUKI gasps]

00:09:37.118 --> 00:09:38.370 position:50% align:center
I'm Kakeru!

00:09:38.453 --> 00:09:40.372 position:50% align:center
Kakeru Manabe, if you wanna
know the whole name.

00:09:40.455 --> 00:09:41.498 position:50% align:center
And it's nice to meet you.

00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:43.208 position:50% align:center
People call me all
sorts of things.

00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:45.043 position:50% align:center
"Manabe," of course,
or "Kakeru."

00:09:45.126 --> 00:09:46.294 position:50% align:center
Those are the obvious ones.

00:09:46.378 --> 00:09:48.129 position:50% align:center
Then there's "Nabe,"
or "Hey, you."

00:09:48.213 --> 00:09:49.798 position:50% align:center
Anyway, call me
whatever you want.

00:09:49.881 --> 00:09:52.801 position:50% align:center
Actually, scratch that. I'd
prefer if you called me "Sho."

00:09:52.884 --> 00:09:54.386 position:50% align:center
I could use a change of pace.

00:09:54.469 --> 00:09:56.221 position:50% align:center
--[YUKI] Uh.
--Nope! Stop right there!

00:09:56.304 --> 00:09:58.973 position:50% align:center
There's no need for you to
introduce yourself, Yuki Soma.

00:09:59.057 --> 00:10:02.560 position:50% align:center
By the way, I'm a second-year.
Class A, if you're interested.

00:10:02.644 --> 00:10:05.146 position:50% align:center
And that's Machi Kuragi.
She's a first-year.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:06.815 position:50% align:center
Oh! I forgot!

00:10:06.898 --> 00:10:08.775 position:50% align:center
Now listen, I want black.

00:10:08.858 --> 00:10:12.320 position:50% align:center
Uh. I'm sorry, um, like,
coffee? I don't understand.

00:10:12.404 --> 00:10:13.571 position:50% align:center
No, I won't budge!

00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:15.824 position:50% align:center
It's the one thing that
I will never give up!

00:10:15.907 --> 00:10:18.410 position:50% align:center
You're cool with
that, right? Cool.

00:10:18.493 --> 00:10:22.414 position:50% align:center
Then I've said my piece and
there's a couch callin' my name.

00:10:22.497 --> 00:10:24.457 position:50% align:center
Look, before you go anywhere,

00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:26.251 position:50% align:center
could actually tell
me who you are?

00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:28.253 position:50% align:center
Huh? Like I said, I'm Manabe--

00:10:28.336 --> 00:10:29.170 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
That's not what I meant!

00:10:29.254 --> 00:10:30.255 position:50% align:center
[MACHI]
Manabe.

00:10:30.338 --> 00:10:31.923 position:50% align:center
You never told him
why we're here.

00:10:32.007 --> 00:10:33.008 position:50% align:center
That we're board members.

00:10:33.091 --> 00:10:36.052 position:50% align:center
Oh, I forgot that part, huh?

00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:40.682 position:50% align:center
I'm the VP, and over here,
we have the new class treasurer.

00:10:40.765 --> 00:10:42.851 position:50% align:center
So, we'll be working under you,

00:10:42.934 --> 00:10:45.603 position:50% align:center
our student council
president extraordinaire.

00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:48.440 position:50% align:center
Yep. It's gonna be
all kinds of fun.

00:10:48.523 --> 00:10:50.859 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
This... is not okay.

00:10:50.942 --> 00:10:52.819 position:50% align:center
Whoa, no need to
look so worried.

00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:54.529 position:50% align:center
We'll follow all
your orders, Prez.

00:10:54.612 --> 00:10:56.698 position:50% align:center
I mean it, so don't
be shy, okay?

00:10:56.781 --> 00:10:58.283 position:50% align:center
I think we're done here.

00:10:58.366 --> 00:11:01.369 position:50% align:center
Sleep's beckoning me
and it's time to answer.

00:11:01.453 --> 00:11:02.495 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Hey.

00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:03.747 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Nighty-night.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.498 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] There's something
uncomfortably familiar

00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:08.835 position:50% align:center
about the way this
Manabe guy acts.

00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:11.046 position:50% align:center
He says one thing when
he clearly means another

00:11:11.129 --> 00:11:14.382 position:50% align:center
and has a complete disregard
for everyone around him.

00:11:14.466 --> 00:11:17.427 position:50% align:center
Just being near him makes
me almost physically ill.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:18.595 position:50% align:center
[AYAME laughs]

00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:20.972 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
No! Not another one!

00:11:21.056 --> 00:11:23.767 position:50% align:center
[TAKEI] Hello, Yuki!
A pleasure, as always!

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.019 position:50% align:center
I apologize for my tardiness.

00:11:26.102 --> 00:11:28.229 position:50% align:center
So, you've met
Manabe and Kuragi.

00:11:28.313 --> 00:11:30.732 position:50% align:center
I'm interested to know what
you think of our line-up.

00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:33.610 position:50% align:center
Come on, let's hear it.
What are your first impressions?

00:11:34.903 --> 00:11:36.988 position:50% align:center
Wow! You're so overcome
with excitement

00:11:37.072 --> 00:11:38.740 position:50% align:center
you've been rendered speechless.

00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:40.617 position:50% align:center
Then all the effort I put
into the selection process

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.660 position:50% align:center
was worth it. Eee!

00:11:42.744 --> 00:11:44.537 position:50% align:center
Now I just need to find
two more candidates

00:11:44.621 --> 00:11:46.539 position:50% align:center
who will complement
your leadership style.

00:11:46.623 --> 00:11:49.459 position:50% align:center
Rest easy, Yuki,
I'll handle everything!

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:51.127 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Right. I'm sure you will.

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:52.671 position:50% align:center
I can't wait to meet them.

00:11:52.754 --> 00:11:54.214 position:50% align:center
Yes! Trust in me.

00:11:54.297 --> 00:11:57.217 position:50% align:center
I will overcome any obstacle
to ensure your success.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:00.512 position:50% align:center
[phone rings]

00:12:00.595 --> 00:12:02.847 position:50% align:center
What?! Oh, crap!
I'm gonna be late!

00:12:02.931 --> 00:12:04.808 position:50% align:center
I need to get to work,
like, yesterday.

00:12:04.891 --> 00:12:06.309 position:50% align:center
[TAKEI]
Manabe!

00:12:06.393 --> 00:12:08.228 position:50% align:center
When you officially assume
your duties as vice-president,

00:12:08.311 --> 00:12:10.063 position:50% align:center
work will have to
take a backseat.

00:12:10.146 --> 00:12:11.398 position:50% align:center
Yeah, no problem!

00:12:11.481 --> 00:12:15.777 position:50% align:center
I'm off. Your VP is leaving.
Walk with me, 'kay?

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.946 position:50% align:center
Come on, we can get to
know each other better!

00:12:18.029 --> 00:12:19.489 position:50% align:center
Cease and desist!

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:21.866 position:50% align:center
I won't have you manhandling
Yuki like that!

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:24.202 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Got it! See ya, Machi.

00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:28.373 position:50% align:center
[MANABE] Work has been keepin'
me super busy lately.

00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:30.000 position:50% align:center
It's rough, ya know?

00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:32.877 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I'm surprised you took
on being vice-president, then.

00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:35.922 position:50% align:center
Had to. "School Defense Force"
has such a cool ring to it.

00:12:36.006 --> 00:12:37.340 position:50% align:center
I couldn't resist.

00:12:37.424 --> 00:12:38.758 position:50% align:center
What?

00:12:38.842 --> 00:12:40.301 position:50% align:center
You didn't know?

00:12:40.385 --> 00:12:42.595 position:50% align:center
The student council is also
called the School Defense Force.

00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:44.764 position:50% align:center
I'm into <i>Super Sentai</i> stuff.

00:12:44.848 --> 00:12:47.559 position:50% align:center
Now, first step in setting
up our new defense force

00:12:47.642 --> 00:12:49.519 position:50% align:center
is deciding who's
gonna be which color.

00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:51.855 position:50% align:center
Like I said, I call black.

00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:54.482 position:50% align:center
All dark and mysterious,
like an outlaw.

00:12:54.566 --> 00:12:56.359 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
That's the reason he joined?

00:12:56.443 --> 00:12:58.194 position:50% align:center
[MANABE] You're the prez
and our fearless leader,

00:12:58.278 --> 00:13:00.488 position:50% align:center
so you should be red,
but I dunno,

00:13:00.572 --> 00:13:02.949 position:50% align:center
red doesn't really
fit you somehow.

00:13:03.033 --> 00:13:07.537 position:50% align:center
If I was the one picking,
I'd say you're more of a pink.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.123 position:50% align:center
Know what I mean?

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:12.500 position:50% align:center
Just look at that delicate face.

00:13:12.584 --> 00:13:14.836 position:50% align:center
It's so feminine.

00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:19.716 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
He's... making fun of me.

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:23.720 position:50% align:center
We just met and I
already hate this guy.

00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:27.057 position:50% align:center
Well, excuse me
if you don't like my face.

00:13:28.892 --> 00:13:31.478 position:50% align:center
[MANABE]
Wow. You're mad.

00:13:31.561 --> 00:13:32.604 position:50% align:center
Awesome, man.

00:13:32.687 --> 00:13:33.855 position:50% align:center
It turns out you're
more interesting

00:13:33.938 --> 00:13:36.107 position:50% align:center
than I thought you would be.

00:13:36.191 --> 00:13:38.902 position:50% align:center
Anyway, sorry if
I pissed you off.

00:13:38.985 --> 00:13:41.029 position:50% align:center
You'd be surprised
how often it happens.

00:13:41.112 --> 00:13:43.031 position:50% align:center
I'm kind of an idiot sometimes.

00:13:43.114 --> 00:13:45.658 position:50% align:center
But I'm sure we'll still
get along, right?

00:13:45.742 --> 00:13:48.536 position:50% align:center
Thanks for walkin' me out, Prez!

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:51.456 position:50% align:center
See you around.
Had fun chattin' with ya.

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:58.046 position:50% align:center
[MANABE humming]

00:13:58.129 --> 00:13:59.381 position:50% align:center
[TAKEI]
Huh?

00:13:59.464 --> 00:14:02.550 position:50% align:center
Oh! Great, you're back!
Hope you had a good talk.

00:14:02.634 --> 00:14:04.094 position:50% align:center
Where's Kuragi?

00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:06.554 position:50% align:center
[TAKEI] She went home, but I'm
sure you'll see her again soon.

00:14:06.638 --> 00:14:08.014 position:50% align:center
Those two may seem a little odd,

00:14:08.098 --> 00:14:10.141 position:50% align:center
but I assure you they are
more than well qualified

00:14:10.225 --> 00:14:11.393 position:50% align:center
to sit on the student...

00:14:11.476 --> 00:14:14.521 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] So weird.
What was she up to in here?

00:14:14.604 --> 00:14:16.731 position:50% align:center
[TAKEI] ...fine line between
genius and insanity.

00:14:17.816 --> 00:14:21.111 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO]
Yuki... our time grows shorter.

00:14:21.194 --> 00:14:23.154 position:50% align:center
And my heart aches.

00:14:23.238 --> 00:14:24.781 position:50% align:center
After I graduate next spring,

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:27.325 position:50% align:center
how often will I be able
to see your face,

00:14:27.409 --> 00:14:30.745 position:50% align:center
or hear your breathtaking voice?

00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:33.164 position:50% align:center
Do you remember it as I do?

00:14:33.248 --> 00:14:37.377 position:50% align:center
That momentous day
when we first spoke?

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.379 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO]
Yuki?

00:14:39.462 --> 00:14:43.675 position:50% align:center
I just wanted to say...
you're beautiful.

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:46.720 position:50% align:center
Thank you very much.

00:14:46.803 --> 00:14:49.431 position:50% align:center
Alas! Our destiny
is like a single rose

00:14:49.514 --> 00:14:50.890 position:50% align:center
growing along a black gate!

00:14:50.974 --> 00:14:53.893 position:50% align:center
A fragrant flower framed
by darkness and despair!

00:14:53.977 --> 00:14:56.396 position:50% align:center
Will you pipe down?! No one
wants to hear your whining!

00:14:56.479 --> 00:14:58.481 position:50% align:center
Too bad! If you cared
about my happiness at all,

00:14:58.565 --> 00:15:00.734 position:50% align:center
you'd have waited another
year to have me, you hag!

00:15:00.817 --> 00:15:02.152 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO'S MOTHER]
Stop yelling and go to bed,

00:15:02.235 --> 00:15:03.486 position:50% align:center
you ungrateful little brat!

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.739 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO]
Get out of my room!

00:15:05.822 --> 00:15:09.034 position:50% align:center
I'm not telling,
and that's final!

00:15:09.117 --> 00:15:10.744 position:50% align:center
Final!

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:14.414 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO]
I can't stand this any longer.

00:15:14.497 --> 00:15:15.707 position:50% align:center
It's time for Plan B.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.084 position:50% align:center
We break into the
student council room.

00:15:18.168 --> 00:15:20.670 position:50% align:center
[AIDA]
I assume that's why I'm here.

00:15:20.754 --> 00:15:21.629 position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:15:21.713 --> 00:15:23.548 position:50% align:center
I trust you'll do this for us,

00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:26.885 position:50% align:center
third-year Prince Yuki Fan
Club member, Rika Aida.

00:15:26.968 --> 00:15:31.014 position:50% align:center
Don't worry. There's nothing
I won't do for Yuki's sake.

00:15:31.097 --> 00:15:32.265 position:50% align:center
It'll be easy.

00:15:32.349 --> 00:15:33.767 position:50% align:center
I can open any door
in this school

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:35.268 position:50% align:center
with a mere flick of my wrist.

00:15:35.352 --> 00:15:37.896 position:50% align:center
Your loyalty is unparalleled.

00:15:37.979 --> 00:15:40.315 position:50% align:center
[YAMAGISHI] That's an unusual
hidden talent to have.

00:15:40.398 --> 00:15:41.566 position:50% align:center
[KINOSHITA]
Yeah...

00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:44.235 position:50% align:center
The kind of talent that
can land you in jail.

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.947 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO] All right.
Let's see what you can do.

00:15:48.031 --> 00:15:50.575 position:50% align:center
[AIDA]
This won't take long.

00:15:50.658 --> 00:15:51.951 position:50% align:center
Hold on.

00:15:52.035 --> 00:15:53.745 position:50% align:center
What's the matter?

00:15:53.828 --> 00:15:55.497 position:50% align:center
[AIDA]
It's not locked.

00:16:00.418 --> 00:16:01.961 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:02.045 --> 00:16:03.254 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO, AIDA]
Yuki!

00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:05.465 position:50% align:center
[AIDA] Hello! What are
you up to in here?

00:16:05.548 --> 00:16:07.258 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I had some time,
so I thought I'd go over

00:16:07.342 --> 00:16:09.552 position:50% align:center
the student council's
yearly calendar.

00:16:09.636 --> 00:16:12.847 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO]
My prince in the flesh.

00:16:12.931 --> 00:16:14.474 position:50% align:center
It's been awhile, huh?

00:16:14.557 --> 00:16:16.976 position:50% align:center
So tell me, what
brings you here?

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.311 position:50% align:center
Can I help you with something?

00:16:18.395 --> 00:16:21.648 position:50% align:center
Nope. I just had a question
for President Takei.

00:16:21.731 --> 00:16:23.483 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Oh, I'm sorry, Senpai.

00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:25.276 position:50% align:center
I don't know if he's
going to stop by today.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.405 position:50% align:center
[AIDA] That's fine! Can we
wait here in case he does?

00:16:28.488 --> 00:16:30.031 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Of course.

00:16:30.115 --> 00:16:33.660 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO] Oh! This is a gift from
the Goddess of Fate herself!

00:16:33.743 --> 00:16:37.497 position:50% align:center
I need to say something.
Something witty and memorable.

00:16:38.957 --> 00:16:40.375 position:50% align:center
Yeah, so anyway, Yuki!

00:16:40.458 --> 00:16:43.920 position:50% align:center
I was wondering what you
had for breakfast today!

00:16:44.004 --> 00:16:47.674 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] What did I have
for... breakfast?

00:16:47.757 --> 00:16:50.135 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO]
I've failed you, Goddess.

00:16:50.218 --> 00:16:52.554 position:50% align:center
Um, yes?

00:16:52.637 --> 00:16:54.639 position:50% align:center
Well, let me think.

00:16:54.723 --> 00:16:57.017 position:50% align:center
Some rice and a
bowl of miso soup,

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.728 position:50% align:center
with some fish and
simmered vegetables.

00:16:59.811 --> 00:17:01.354 position:50% align:center
And <i>natto</i> .

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.108 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO, AIDA]
The prince eats <i>natto</i> ?

00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:06.901 position:50% align:center
That's... an interesting choice.

00:17:06.985 --> 00:17:09.487 position:50% align:center
But you know, I've heard that
it's good for your heart

00:17:09.571 --> 00:17:11.948 position:50% align:center
and immune system and
can prevent canker sores.

00:17:12.032 --> 00:17:14.117 position:50% align:center
I like the type made
from ground beans.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.494 position:50% align:center
Yeah, so do I.

00:17:16.578 --> 00:17:19.080 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO]
He smiled! Yuki smiled at me!

00:17:19.164 --> 00:17:20.665 position:50% align:center
Minagawa- <i>senpai</i> ?

00:17:20.749 --> 00:17:24.169 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO] Oh! It's like a bolt of
lightning straight to my heart!

00:17:24.252 --> 00:17:28.381 position:50% align:center
Can this be true? Yuki and I
like the same kind of <i>natto</i> ?

00:17:28.465 --> 00:17:30.050 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Excuse me, but...

00:17:30.133 --> 00:17:32.719 position:50% align:center
...you tend to speak very
formally, don't you?

00:17:32.802 --> 00:17:35.472 position:50% align:center
Well, um, yes.
I suppose that I do.

00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:37.474 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised you noticed.

00:17:37.557 --> 00:17:38.600 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Really?

00:17:38.683 --> 00:17:40.560 position:50% align:center
You find it annoying, don't you?

00:17:40.643 --> 00:17:43.188 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
No, not at all.

00:17:43.271 --> 00:17:47.525 position:50% align:center
If anything...
I think it's cute.

00:17:47.609 --> 00:17:49.277 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:49.361 --> 00:17:51.571 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Did you hear
that, Motoko?

00:17:51.654 --> 00:17:53.615 position:50% align:center
He just called you cute.

00:17:53.698 --> 00:17:55.200 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO]
No.

00:17:55.283 --> 00:18:00.497 position:50% align:center
When did smiles start to come
so easily to your solemn face?

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:04.668 position:50% align:center
And how did I fail
to notice the change?

00:18:04.751 --> 00:18:07.545 position:50% align:center
I've been watching you
since the day we met,

00:18:07.629 --> 00:18:10.465 position:50% align:center
soaking up every detail.

00:18:10.548 --> 00:18:15.470 position:50% align:center
Yuki, I wonder...
is this only the beginning?

00:18:15.553 --> 00:18:18.765 position:50% align:center
Will you continue to change
without me knowing?

00:18:18.848 --> 00:18:23.103 position:50% align:center
Will you smile even more
with someone else's help?

00:18:23.186 --> 00:18:25.563 position:50% align:center
Someone who isn't me?

00:18:25.647 --> 00:18:27.065 position:50% align:center
Well, in that case,
you should know--

00:18:27.148 --> 00:18:28.483 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO]
Stop it.

00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:29.859 position:50% align:center
Minagawa- <i>senpai</i> , are you--?

00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:32.487 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO]
Stop it! Just back off!

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:34.906 position:50% align:center
Stay away from Yuki!

00:18:34.989 --> 00:18:37.617 position:50% align:center
You're ruining everything!

00:18:39.703 --> 00:18:40.704 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:40.787 --> 00:18:42.831 position:50% align:center
Oh. Um. I'm sorry.

00:18:42.914 --> 00:18:46.918 position:50% align:center
I got confused.
Please excuse me.

00:18:47.002 --> 00:18:49.713 position:50% align:center
Hey, wait. Motoko!

00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:52.757 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO]
I'm a horrible person.

00:18:52.841 --> 00:18:55.427 position:50% align:center
How could I say those
things in front of him?

00:18:55.510 --> 00:19:01.141 position:50% align:center
Even though... they're true.
That's how I really feel.

00:19:02.392 --> 00:19:05.103 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO] I hate all girls
who dare to come near Yuki.

00:19:05.186 --> 00:19:06.521 position:50% align:center
Including Tohru Honda

00:19:06.604 --> 00:19:10.525 position:50% align:center
and any who might be
joining the student council.

00:19:10.608 --> 00:19:15.071 position:50% align:center
I despise them.
They're my enemies.

00:19:15.155 --> 00:19:18.950 position:50% align:center
But... the one
I hate most of all

00:19:19.034 --> 00:19:22.871 position:50% align:center
is the girl who thinks
these hideous thoughts.

00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:29.711 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO] The one whose eyes
look back at me in the mirror.

00:19:29.794 --> 00:19:31.171 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Minagawa- <i>senpai</i> ?

00:19:31.254 --> 00:19:32.339 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:32.422 --> 00:19:37.302 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO] Oh! Yuki!
Did you need something?

00:19:37.385 --> 00:19:42.140 position:50% align:center
I'm just worried that what I
said before might've upset you.

00:19:42.223 --> 00:19:45.018 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO] Uh! No, you didn't say
anything wrong, I promise.

00:19:45.101 --> 00:19:47.270 position:50% align:center
I'm fine! Please don't
concern yourself!

00:19:47.354 --> 00:19:49.606 position:50% align:center
Though, honestly, it's nice,

00:19:49.689 --> 00:19:52.108 position:50% align:center
having someone as cool
as you worry about me.

00:19:52.192 --> 00:19:53.193 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO chuckles]

00:19:53.276 --> 00:19:56.863 position:50% align:center
Please. I'm the
opposite of cool.

00:19:56.946 --> 00:20:00.617 position:50% align:center
Most of the time I can
barely keep it together.

00:20:03.745 --> 00:20:06.581 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO]
Yes. I know what you mean.

00:20:06.664 --> 00:20:10.043 position:50% align:center
I feel that way a lot, too.

00:20:14.214 --> 00:20:15.632 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:20:17.676 --> 00:20:20.053 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO]
As much as I hate to admit it,

00:20:20.136 --> 00:20:23.056 position:50% align:center
I know I have her
to thank for this.

00:20:23.139 --> 00:20:24.933 position:50% align:center
If she hadn't interfered,

00:20:25.016 --> 00:20:29.354 position:50% align:center
he wouldn't be standing
here now, smiling at me.

00:20:31.272 --> 00:20:34.609 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO] Yuki, you've
changed in the last year.

00:20:34.693 --> 00:20:35.902 position:50% align:center
I...

00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:39.739 position:50% align:center
However! I have no intention
of giving up yet!

00:20:42.367 --> 00:20:43.535 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO]
Hmph!

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:49.749 position:50% align:center
[MOTOKO] It's too early to know
how this love will end.

00:20:49.833 --> 00:20:52.585 position:50% align:center
We still have time.

00:20:55.422 --> 00:20:58.341 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] So their names
are Manabe and Kuragi?

00:20:58.425 --> 00:20:59.801 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Yeah.

00:20:59.884 --> 00:21:03.346 position:50% align:center
From what I can tell so far,
they seem pretty strange.

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:05.932 position:50% align:center
And I mean zodiac-level strange.

00:21:06.016 --> 00:21:07.517 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
Oh, wow.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:08.852 position:50% align:center
And since I'm the president,

00:21:08.935 --> 00:21:11.104 position:50% align:center
it'll be my job to
keep them in line.

00:21:11.187 --> 00:21:14.232 position:50% align:center
Sounds like you'll have your
work cut out for you next term.

00:21:14.315 --> 00:21:17.569 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Still, I'm sure he just
meant he was looking forward

00:21:17.652 --> 00:21:20.655 position:50% align:center
to teasing me some more.

00:21:20.739 --> 00:21:22.032 position:50% align:center
But...

00:21:22.115 --> 00:21:24.617 position:50% align:center
You're more interesting
than I thought!

00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:28.496 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
It caught me off guard.

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:31.124 position:50% align:center
No one's ever said anything
like that to me before,

00:21:31.207 --> 00:21:36.504 position:50% align:center
so when he did,
it made me feel...

00:21:36.588 --> 00:21:38.256 position:50% align:center
...kind of happy.

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:39.883 position:50% align:center
I guess.

00:21:43.803 --> 00:21:47.015 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU]
I think you'll enjoy it.

00:21:47.098 --> 00:21:51.728 position:50% align:center
Things will be tough
sometimes, maybe even scary,

00:21:51.811 --> 00:21:54.689 position:50% align:center
but if you stick with it,

00:21:54.773 --> 00:21:58.526 position:50% align:center
I bet you'll end up with more
good memories than bad ones.

00:22:01.988 --> 00:22:04.491 position:50% align:center
[TOHRU] That's the feeling
I get, anyway.

00:22:04.574 --> 00:22:07.660 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Yeah, You're right.

00:22:09.371 --> 00:22:12.290 position:50% align:center
I'll try. Thanks.

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.838 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Who knew a trivial remark

00:22:18.922 --> 00:22:23.093 position:50% align:center
could have the power to
hurt as well as heal.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.606 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
"Eat <i>somen</i> with your friends."
