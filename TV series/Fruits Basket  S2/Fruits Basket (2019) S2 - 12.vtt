00:00:12.637 --> 00:00:14.264 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO]
In the hospital? From a cold?

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:16.766 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO'S MOTHER] Your father's
not as young as he used to be,

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.477 position:50% align:center
but with him so ill,
what will I do about the shop?

00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:21.396 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO]
That's easy. Close it up.

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:23.023 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO'S MOTHER]
I can't do that!

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:24.566 position:50% align:center
It would upset our regulars.

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:28.445 position:50% align:center
Oh! And your poor father!
If he heard the shop was closed!

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:30.530 position:50% align:center
Okay, enough crying. You win.

00:00:30.613 --> 00:00:32.073 position:50% align:center
I'll stick around and
watch the shop for you.

00:00:32.157 --> 00:00:36.327 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO'S MOTHER] Oh, wonderful!
I'll leave it to you, then!

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:37.829 position:50% align:center
Honestly.

00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:40.665 position:50% align:center
Teachers have stuff to do over
summer break too, ya know!

00:00:43.918 --> 00:00:47.380 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Come on.

00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:48.840 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:00:51.926 --> 00:00:53.345 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO] If there was any
way to give them back

00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:55.930 position:50% align:center
what they lost that day,

00:00:56.014 --> 00:01:00.101 position:50% align:center
I would've done it,
whatever it took.

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:02.562 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO]
Uh? Welcome-- Huh?

00:01:06.524 --> 00:01:10.445 position:50% align:center
Oh. Mayu, hey! It's been ages!

00:01:11.946 --> 00:01:13.573 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] I still don't
understand why you would want

00:01:13.656 --> 00:01:16.743 position:50% align:center
to be a teacher if you could
run this shop instead.

00:01:16.826 --> 00:01:18.495 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO] If you think it's
such a glamorous calling,

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:21.039 position:50% align:center
you're more than welcome
to switch places with me.

00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:22.999 position:50% align:center
Seriously, it's just his hobby.

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:26.002 position:50% align:center
Why not close the place
while he's hospitalized?

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:29.005 position:50% align:center
As a regular, I would find
that quite upsetting.

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:30.507 position:50% align:center
Kinda sad for my ex-boyfriend

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.676 position:50% align:center
to be hanging around
my father's bookstore.

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.260 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
I don't know.

00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:37.806 position:50% align:center
We may have broken up, but isn't
it romantic meeting like this?

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:41.101 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO] There isn't a damn
thing romantic about it.

00:01:41.184 --> 00:01:43.937 position:50% align:center
By the way, that book
you ordered's not in.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.731 position:50% align:center
And it's not gonna
be until tomorrow.

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:49.651 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO]
Ugh, this guy.

00:01:49.734 --> 00:01:51.486 position:50% align:center
I can't seem to shake him.

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:54.406 position:50% align:center
We still run into each other
around town sometimes.

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:55.407 position:50% align:center
And of course it doesn't help

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.076 position:50% align:center
that the Soma kids
go to my school.

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.498 position:50% align:center
It's been two years. It should
all just be a memory by now.

00:02:03.581 --> 00:02:05.083 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Well, here she is!

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:07.002 position:50% align:center
This is Mayuko Shiraki,

00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:09.838 position:50% align:center
the best friend you hear
me talk about so much.

00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:13.383 position:50% align:center
Mayu, meet the Soma
family doctor, Hatori.

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:16.970 position:50% align:center
My boss. Come say hello!

00:02:17.053 --> 00:02:18.638 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO]
Neither of them mentioned it,

00:02:18.722 --> 00:02:20.432 position:50% align:center
but they didn't need to.

00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:23.351 position:50% align:center
I could tell they were together.

00:02:23.435 --> 00:02:26.938 position:50% align:center
Knowing that didn't stop me
from being an idiot, though.

00:02:27.022 --> 00:02:30.859 position:50% align:center
Why did I let myself
start liking him?

00:02:30.942 --> 00:02:32.193 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Hey.

00:02:32.277 --> 00:02:33.903 position:50% align:center
I was thinking that
I might tell Hatori

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:35.822 position:50% align:center
about your family's bookstore.

00:02:35.905 --> 00:02:39.284 position:50% align:center
I think he'd enjoy looking
through all those old books.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.621 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO] Kana kept smiling,
not knowing how I felt.

00:02:43.705 --> 00:02:47.292 position:50% align:center
And every time she did,
the guilt made me sick.

00:02:47.375 --> 00:02:51.212 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. Kana can be pushy,
but she means well.

00:02:51.296 --> 00:02:53.381 position:50% align:center
Nah, don't worry. It's fine.

00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:54.883 position:50% align:center
[HATORI]
I'll browse these for a bit.

00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:57.427 position:50% align:center
You don't have to
babysit me, Mayu.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.845 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:58.928 --> 00:03:01.222 position:50% align:center
So, we've moved on
to nicknames already?

00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:02.807 position:50% align:center
Oh. Sorry.

00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:06.561 position:50% align:center
That's just what Kana always
calls you. Guess it stuck.

00:03:06.644 --> 00:03:08.646 position:50% align:center
She talks about you a lot.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.232 position:50% align:center
I can tell that she
must really trust you.

00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:13.360 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, we're best friends.

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:15.320 position:50% align:center
There's not much to the story.

00:03:15.403 --> 00:03:18.907 position:50% align:center
We met back in college,
and the rest is history.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.075 position:50% align:center
It's funny.

00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:21.326 position:50% align:center
Whenever I'm with Kana,

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:24.621 position:50% align:center
I feel like some of her
kindness rubs off on me.

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:28.083 position:50% align:center
She laughs when she's happy
and cries when she's sad.

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:31.795 position:50% align:center
She's a straightforward,
good-hearted person.

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:35.048 position:50% align:center
I wish I could be more like her.

00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:36.091 position:50% align:center
[HATORI]
Trust me.

00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:37.092 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:39.427 position:50% align:center
I know just what you mean.

00:03:41.846 --> 00:03:43.139 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO]
Oh, yeah?

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:45.517 position:50% align:center
Is that what it's like with
your best friends, too?

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.270 position:50% align:center
What were their names?
Shigure and Ayame, right?

00:03:49.354 --> 00:03:52.315 position:50% align:center
My best friends? Is that what
those guys are? Really?

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:54.150 position:50% align:center
Why're you asking me?

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:55.819 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:57.070 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO]
I couldn't help it.

00:03:57.153 --> 00:03:59.781 position:50% align:center
I loved that quiet
chuckle of his.

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:03.159 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO]
Then I met Shigure and Aya,

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:07.247 position:50% align:center
and learned a little more
about the reserved doctor.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.377 position:50% align:center
I loved his voice, his
eyes, his personality.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.588 position:50% align:center
Everything about him.

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:18.675 position:50% align:center
Even though I knew I
could never be with him.

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:21.970 position:50% align:center
Even though it was impossible.

00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:25.640 position:50% align:center
Idiot. I should've just
forgotten about him.

00:04:25.724 --> 00:04:29.728 position:50% align:center
Kana wants us to grab
a drink again. All of us.

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:32.605 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO]
She and Hatori.

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:34.816 position:50% align:center
They've been dating
for how long?

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:37.402 position:50% align:center
Why are they keeping
it a secret?

00:04:38.653 --> 00:04:42.073 position:50% align:center
Sometimes a secret's kept for
the sake of everyone involved.

00:04:42.157 --> 00:04:43.283 position:50% align:center
Who knows?

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:45.410 position:50% align:center
Maybe Kana thinks it's
easier on you this way,

00:04:45.493 --> 00:04:48.455 position:50% align:center
given your little crush.

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:50.248 position:50% align:center
How do you know about that?

00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:52.000 position:50% align:center
You'll find I'm
surprisingly perceptive

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:54.586 position:50% align:center
when it comes to
matters of the heart.

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.005 position:50% align:center
You should just steal him.

00:04:57.088 --> 00:04:58.965 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO]
Stop joking around.

00:04:59.049 --> 00:05:02.510 position:50% align:center
I could never compare to Kana.

00:05:02.594 --> 00:05:05.263 position:50% align:center
That's a level of
perfect I can't reach.

00:05:05.347 --> 00:05:08.850 position:50% align:center
Besides, I want them
to be happy together.

00:05:08.933 --> 00:05:10.143 position:50% align:center
So happy that it shows me

00:05:10.226 --> 00:05:13.438 position:50% align:center
how ridiculous it is
for me to want him.

00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:16.775 position:50% align:center
Until I can't even
dream of it anymore.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.236 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
How very wise.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.489 position:50% align:center
So, why not go out with me?

00:05:22.572 --> 00:05:23.823 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:26.493 position:50% align:center
In what world does that
suggestion make any sense?

00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:29.037 position:50% align:center
Think about it: You're
lonely, aren't you?

00:05:31.206 --> 00:05:32.874 position:50% align:center
And you're at the point
where anyone will do

00:05:32.957 --> 00:05:34.876 position:50% align:center
as long as you don't
have to be alone.

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:37.879 position:50% align:center
I've got some time to kill
and nothing better going on.

00:05:37.962 --> 00:05:40.465 position:50% align:center
So why don't we help
each other out?

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:45.470 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO] I told Kana and
Hatori that we were dating.

00:05:45.553 --> 00:05:46.721 position:50% align:center
At least the looks
on their faces

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:49.265 position:50% align:center
gave me something
to laugh about.

00:05:50.684 --> 00:05:53.812 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO] Never really knew
how to describe Shigure.

00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:56.856 position:50% align:center
He was like a ripple
on the water.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.027 position:50% align:center
He never touched me.
There were no hugs or kisses.

00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:05.407 position:50% align:center
He was just...
always there, somehow.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.373 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:06:18.461 --> 00:06:19.838 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO]
Nothing.

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:25.844 position:50% align:center
[KANA] So, are things
going okay with Shigure?

00:06:25.927 --> 00:06:26.886 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.888 position:50% align:center
They're fine. Why're you asking?

00:06:28.972 --> 00:06:30.890 position:50% align:center
[KANA] I know you hold yourself
back a lot of the time

00:06:30.974 --> 00:06:33.476 position:50% align:center
because you're more worried
about other people.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.397 position:50% align:center
So it's hard to tell whether
you're actually happy.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.898 position:50% align:center
Oh, I get it.

00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:40.775 position:50% align:center
Basically, what you're saying
is you don't trust Shigure

00:06:40.859 --> 00:06:42.152 position:50% align:center
any further than
you can throw him.

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:45.447 position:50% align:center
What? Oh, no! I didn't mean
it that way, I swear.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:46.197 position:50% align:center
It's just, I, uh...

00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:47.866 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO]
Thank you.

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:50.076 position:50% align:center
But I'm okay.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.871 position:50% align:center
You're the one I
want to be happy.

00:06:52.954 --> 00:06:54.998 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about me.

00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:00.587 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Oh. Hi, Mayu.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:04.382 position:50% align:center
I didn't realize you were
coming to visit today.

00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:07.844 position:50% align:center
Sorry, it's been so long
since we've seen each other,

00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:09.679 position:50% align:center
and I'm a total mess.

00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:10.972 position:50% align:center
You know you don't
have to worry about

00:07:11.056 --> 00:07:13.016 position:50% align:center
that kind of stuff with me.

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:16.019 position:50% align:center
It really has been a long
time, though, you know.

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:19.522 position:50% align:center
I haven't been able to get ahold
of you, so I've been worried.

00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:23.693 position:50% align:center
I asked Shigure to help me sneak
in so I could check on you.

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:25.445 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Have you seen Hatori?

00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:29.282 position:50% align:center
Uh? No, I came straight to you.

00:07:29.366 --> 00:07:33.620 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Hatori, his eye...

00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:37.248 position:50% align:center
It got hurt. There was blood.

00:07:37.332 --> 00:07:40.502 position:50% align:center
And... it was all my fault.

00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:43.630 position:50% align:center
What should I do?
Please, tell me!

00:07:43.713 --> 00:07:46.758 position:50% align:center
He's hurt. He's hurt
and it's all my fault.

00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:49.010 position:50% align:center
I can't fix it!

00:07:49.094 --> 00:07:51.930 position:50% align:center
I was there. Right next to him.

00:07:52.013 --> 00:07:57.268 position:50% align:center
And still... he got
hurt so terribly!

00:07:57.352 --> 00:07:59.646 position:50% align:center
My fault. My fault.

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:04.275 position:50% align:center
I was standing right there
and I couldn't protect him.

00:08:04.359 --> 00:08:07.237 position:50% align:center
I couldn't protect him!

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:11.408 position:50% align:center
Well?

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:14.327 position:50% align:center
I did tell you it would
be better not to see her.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.914 position:50% align:center
Is Hatori up next?

00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:23.336 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO]
I didn't know why or how.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:28.675 position:50% align:center
All I knew... was that their
happiness was shattered.

00:08:28.758 --> 00:08:33.054 position:50% align:center
Broken so completely they
could never get it back.

00:08:33.138 --> 00:08:35.223 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
I was stuck in bed so long.

00:08:35.306 --> 00:08:37.475 position:50% align:center
You must've been
pretty worried, huh?

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:38.852 position:50% align:center
I'm fine now, though.

00:08:38.935 --> 00:08:40.270 position:50% align:center
Are you sure about that?

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:41.980 position:50% align:center
Your cheeks still
don't look so good.

00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:43.356 position:50% align:center
[KANA laughs]

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.233 position:50% align:center
Yeah, Hatori actually
said I should spend

00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:48.820 position:50% align:center
some more time recuperating,
maybe even go away somewhere.

00:08:48.903 --> 00:08:51.281 position:50% align:center
So, I was thinking I
might go visit my mom

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:54.242 position:50% align:center
and just take it
easy for a while.

00:08:54.325 --> 00:08:56.369 position:50% align:center
You really did forget,
didn't you?

00:08:56.453 --> 00:08:58.913 position:50% align:center
--What?
--Never mind.

00:08:58.997 --> 00:09:01.291 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO]
The one thing Shigure told me

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:04.336 position:50% align:center
was that they had
suppressed her memories.

00:09:04.419 --> 00:09:08.298 position:50% align:center
How could Hatori stand it,
erasing their time together?

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:10.383 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Oh, yeah, Mayu.

00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:13.094 position:50% align:center
Is it true you
broke up with Shigure?

00:09:13.178 --> 00:09:14.929 position:50% align:center
Uh. Uh-huh.

00:09:15.013 --> 00:09:16.222 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
I hope you don't mind,

00:09:16.306 --> 00:09:18.433 position:50% align:center
but I'm actually
a little relieved.

00:09:18.516 --> 00:09:19.642 position:50% align:center
What?

00:09:19.726 --> 00:09:20.894 position:50% align:center
He always seemed sort
of cold toward you,

00:09:20.977 --> 00:09:23.563 position:50% align:center
and I think you deserve
better than that.

00:09:23.646 --> 00:09:25.648 position:50% align:center
You should be with
someone more like...

00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:29.527 position:50% align:center
Oh, I know! Someone like
Hatori would be perfect.

00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:32.405 position:50% align:center
Aw! You guys would make
such an adorable couple!

00:09:32.489 --> 00:09:34.240 position:50% align:center
I think you'd be
better with him.

00:09:34.324 --> 00:09:36.993 position:50% align:center
Huh? No, I totally wouldn't!

00:09:37.077 --> 00:09:40.747 position:50% align:center
Sure, I look up to him and all,
but we just aren't a good fit.

00:09:43.458 --> 00:09:46.461 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO]
I wanted you to be happy.

00:09:46.544 --> 00:09:48.213 position:50% align:center
Both of you.

00:09:49.381 --> 00:09:51.591 position:50% align:center

00:09:52.801 --> 00:09:54.344 position:50% align:center
[KANA]
Mayu?

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.098 position:50% align:center
What's wrong? You're crying.

00:09:59.099 --> 00:10:01.309 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO]
When people fall in love,

00:10:01.393 --> 00:10:03.978 position:50% align:center
they're hoping
to find happiness.

00:10:04.062 --> 00:10:07.399 position:50% align:center
They don't expect
heartache and loss.

00:10:07.482 --> 00:10:11.611 position:50% align:center
Still, even though
it ended terribly,

00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:15.323 position:50% align:center
I hate that what they had
was lost so completely.

00:10:15.407 --> 00:10:17.617 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Kinda sad, isn't it?

00:10:17.701 --> 00:10:19.869 position:50% align:center
You're the only one
who hasn't moved on.

00:10:19.953 --> 00:10:22.247 position:50% align:center
It has been more
than two years now.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.207 position:50% align:center
I don't know what you mean.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:25.542 position:50% align:center
Don't deny it.

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:27.168 position:50% align:center
The fact that you haven't
met up with Hatori once

00:10:27.252 --> 00:10:29.212 position:50% align:center
since that day is proof.

00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:31.881 position:50% align:center
Kudos to you for being
such a loyal friend,

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:33.258 position:50% align:center
but don't you think
it's about time

00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:36.011 position:50% align:center
to let go of the past
and live a little?

00:10:36.094 --> 00:10:38.513 position:50% align:center
I mean, the other two
obviously have.

00:10:38.596 --> 00:10:40.890 position:50% align:center
Kana's married and
Hatori has a girlfriend.

00:10:40.974 --> 00:10:42.392 position:50% align:center
[gasps] You're lying.

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:43.601 position:50% align:center
No, it's true.

00:10:43.685 --> 00:10:45.895 position:50% align:center
I haven't talked to
Hatori about it myself,

00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:49.524 position:50% align:center
but I do know that she's a
Soma, and her name is, um...

00:10:49.607 --> 00:10:51.735 position:50% align:center
Satsuki, I think?

00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:54.654 position:50% align:center
She reminds me a little of Kana.

00:10:54.738 --> 00:10:57.574 position:50% align:center
Oh. Wow.

00:10:57.657 --> 00:11:01.828 position:50% align:center
So, he finally found someone.

00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:04.039 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] Makes you feel
like an idiot, huh?

00:11:04.122 --> 00:11:05.749 position:50% align:center
How could it not?

00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:08.585 position:50% align:center
Those tragic lovebirds have
found happiness elsewhere,

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:11.379 position:50% align:center
and meanwhile, you're
still here, pining away.

00:11:11.463 --> 00:11:14.591 position:50% align:center
You've even lost your chance to
confess your feelings to Hatori.

00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:17.344 position:50% align:center
The loneliness must be
downright suffocating.

00:11:17.427 --> 00:11:18.470 position:50% align:center
If it'll make you feel better,

00:11:18.553 --> 00:11:20.013 position:50% align:center
you and I could
give it another go.

00:11:20.096 --> 00:11:23.058 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and
shut that idea down right now.

00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:24.476 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Aw, so cold.

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:25.977 position:50% align:center
Don't give me that.

00:11:26.061 --> 00:11:29.105 position:50% align:center
I don't see you with anybody
special on your arm.

00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:30.648 position:50% align:center
And as for me,

00:11:30.732 --> 00:11:32.233 position:50% align:center
I've learned better
than to date someone

00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:35.403 position:50% align:center
just because I'm feeling lonely.

00:11:35.487 --> 00:11:39.282 position:50% align:center
The only thing it does is
make the loneliness worse.

00:11:39.366 --> 00:11:42.285 position:50% align:center
And there you go,
acting like an idiot again.

00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:44.829 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO] At least I helped
you kill some time, right?

00:11:44.913 --> 00:11:46.498 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE]
Yeah, you did.

00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:49.501 position:50% align:center
Never said I had a problem
with idiotic women.

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:55.465 position:50% align:center
[SHIGURE] And, for what it's
worth, he liked you well enough.

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:57.717 position:50% align:center
[door closes]

00:11:57.801 --> 00:12:00.387 position:50% align:center
Well, thanks for stopping by.

00:12:05.475 --> 00:12:08.728 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO] Should I try to
find my own happiness?

00:12:08.812 --> 00:12:11.147 position:50% align:center
Where would I look?

00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:16.152 position:50% align:center
And what are the chances...
that it would work?

00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:17.737 position:50% align:center
How can I help y--?

00:12:19.656 --> 00:12:22.867 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO] I won't let it
make the loneliness worse.

00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:24.703 position:50% align:center
Not this time.

00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:31.876 position:50% align:center
It's been awhile.
I guess, two years?

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.545 position:50% align:center
No, even longer.

00:12:33.628 --> 00:12:37.007 position:50% align:center
Anyway, it's good to
see you again, Shiraki.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:39.759 position:50% align:center
Doesn't look like the
shop has changed at all.

00:12:39.843 --> 00:12:41.302 position:50% align:center
You, either.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:46.307 position:50% align:center
Hi, Hatori. Um.

00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:47.809 position:50% align:center
[HATORI]
Hm?

00:12:47.892 --> 00:12:50.353 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO] Just looking at you
in that suit makes me sweat.

00:12:50.437 --> 00:12:51.896 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry about that.

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.774 position:50% align:center
Oh, no. Ignore me.
I'm just surprised.

00:12:54.858 --> 00:12:59.154 position:50% align:center
I'm not seeing things, am I?
Give me a second, please.

00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:00.530 position:50% align:center
Shigure was here a minute ago,

00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:03.283 position:50% align:center
and we started talking
about... stuff.

00:13:03.366 --> 00:13:04.951 position:50% align:center
I'm actually here
because of Shigure.

00:13:05.035 --> 00:13:07.412 position:50% align:center
He ordered me a book;
I came by to pick it up.

00:13:07.495 --> 00:13:08.913 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO gasps]

00:13:08.997 --> 00:13:10.665 position:50% align:center
Hold on, you're telling me
that book was for you, not him?

00:13:10.749 --> 00:13:12.792 position:50% align:center
[HATORI]
Did he forget to mention that?

00:13:15.712 --> 00:13:18.798 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO] Oh, he didn't forget.
It was totally on purpose.

00:13:18.882 --> 00:13:22.844 position:50% align:center
Well, I'm sorry, but it's not
going to be in until tomorrow.

00:13:22.927 --> 00:13:26.014 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's weird.
He specifically said today.

00:13:26.097 --> 00:13:27.515 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO] He probably thought
it would be hilarious

00:13:27.599 --> 00:13:30.435 position:50% align:center
if we ran into each other.

00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:32.562 position:50% align:center
In that case,
I'll come back tomorrow.

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:35.398 position:50% align:center
Uh. No, it's okay.
I'll ship it to you.

00:13:35.482 --> 00:13:38.902 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you must
be busy, as always.

00:13:38.985 --> 00:13:42.364 position:50% align:center
Thanks, but I'll come back.

00:13:42.447 --> 00:13:43.448 position:50% align:center
See you.

in like this, by the way.

dirty schemer thinking?

[MAYUKO] Hatori was just
as I remembered him:

00:14:15.397 --> 00:14:18.775 position:50% align:center
Calm, serious,
and matter-of-fact.

00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:20.443 position:50% align:center
I didn't get to tell
him how glad I am

00:14:20.527 --> 00:14:22.529 position:50% align:center
he found someone new.

00:14:22.612 --> 00:14:23.822 position:50% align:center
It was strange, though.

00:14:23.905 --> 00:14:25.198 position:50% align:center
Even as reserved as he is,

00:14:25.281 --> 00:14:29.077 position:50% align:center
I would've expected him
to act a little happier.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.996 position:50% align:center

seemed sort of...

for some time.

You really shouldn't
run off like--

00:14:44.467 --> 00:14:45.593 position:50% align:center

leave the estate so often?

Just think of what could
happen while you're gone.

Do not forget.

Akito trusts you more
than anyone else

preserve that trust

00:15:03.653 --> 00:15:05.405 position:50% align:center

out where anyone can hear him?

00:15:17.417 --> 00:15:20.295 position:50% align:center
A shameful display.

00:15:20.378 --> 00:15:24.924 position:50% align:center
Now, Hatori, make haste.
You've delayed long enough.

[MAYUKO'S MOTHER]
Mayuko!

00:15:35.268 --> 00:15:37.437 position:50% align:center
Here. The book Shigure
ordered came in.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.606 position:50% align:center
Right. Thanks.

00:15:39.689 --> 00:15:41.107 position:50% align:center
You know, I've been thinking.

00:15:41.191 --> 00:15:42.901 position:50% align:center
Why don't you just
marry Shigure?

00:15:42.984 --> 00:15:44.402 position:50% align:center
He seems like a nice enough boy.

00:15:44.486 --> 00:15:48.365 position:50% align:center
I told you. I broke up
with him a long time ago.

00:15:48.448 --> 00:15:50.742 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO'S MOTHER] But isn't it
about time you settled down?

00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:52.744 position:50% align:center
Look at Kana--she's married!

00:15:52.827 --> 00:15:54.996 position:50% align:center
Mom, I'll find someone
when I find someone.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.414 position:50% align:center
Now let it go!

00:15:56.498 --> 00:15:59.042 position:50% align:center
Well, at least let us
introduce you to some people.

We won't live forever, you know.

in the hospital.

Just ignore the crazy lady.

00:16:16.893 --> 00:16:18.561 position:50% align:center
I've got your book right here.
Now let's go outside.

00:16:18.645 --> 00:16:19.437 position:50% align:center

Wanna tell me why we
came all the way out here?

00:16:26.695 --> 00:16:27.946 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO]
No.

Every woman's got ups
and downs in life.

00:16:29.739 --> 00:16:31.908 position:50% align:center
It doesn't mean she
wants to talk about 'em.

I don't quite understand you
there, but it sounds tough.

00:16:34.703 --> 00:16:39.374 position:50% align:center
Wait. You lost the suit.
What's with the casual look?

00:16:39.457 --> 00:16:40.625 position:50% align:center
I thought I'd wear something

00:16:40.709 --> 00:16:42.961 position:50% align:center
that wouldn't make you
sweat when you saw me.

00:16:43.044 --> 00:16:46.881 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO chuckling]

00:16:46.965 --> 00:16:47.966 position:50% align:center
Did I say something funny?

No. Sorry.

Hm?

00:16:55.724 --> 00:16:57.559 position:50% align:center
I hope I didn't hurt
your feelings.

00:16:57.642 --> 00:17:00.895 position:50% align:center
Uh. Um, no.

00:17:00.979 --> 00:17:03.231 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO]
Well, something's bothering you.

00:17:03.314 --> 00:17:06.234 position:50% align:center
You seem listless.
I noticed it yesterday, too.

00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:08.319 position:50% align:center
[HATORI] I don't feel sick,
if that's what you mean.

00:17:08.403 --> 00:17:11.531 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO] No. I'm not
talking about physically.

00:17:11.614 --> 00:17:13.867 position:50% align:center
Umm. How can I put it?

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:16.703 position:50% align:center
You don't seem cheerful
or perky, you know?

[MAYUKO] You're not
like you were back then.

00:17:20.832 --> 00:17:25.253 position:50% align:center
You're just missing that
aura of happiness. I guess.

a new girlfriend, right?

what you're trying to tell me,

out for happiness.

All I wanted was to be
somewhere else for a bit.

00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:23.329 position:50% align:center

get away from there.

To escape.

I was just tired.

Though, I guess, if I could cry,
it might make me feel better.

There's freedom in that.

The older we get,

the harder it is for us
to cry without restraint.

about my maturity level?

deserve my tears!

now, with interest!

you well enough.

in the right direction.

00:21:33.543 --> 00:21:36.755 position:50% align:center
No need to thank me, of
course. I'm happy to help.

00:21:36.838 --> 00:21:40.342 position:50% align:center
Really? Not even the
smallest show of gratitude?

00:21:40.425 --> 00:21:42.802 position:50% align:center
Well, anyway, it's up
to you from here on out,

00:21:42.886 --> 00:21:44.471 position:50% align:center
so good luck with that.

It's Hatori, after all,

00:21:45.805 --> 00:21:47.807 position:50% align:center
so I'm not sure how much
longer it might take.

00:21:47.891 --> 00:21:50.727 position:50% align:center
But you've stubbornly held onto
your feelings all this time,

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:53.563 position:50% align:center
so really, what's another
five or ten more years?

Never call me again, you jerk!

'Kay!

00:22:06.701 --> 00:22:10.080 position:50% align:center
[MAYUKO] Five or ten years
was an exaggeration,

00:22:10.163 --> 00:22:13.333 position:50% align:center
but the time when I would
cut my hair short.

00:22:13.416 --> 00:22:18.296 position:50% align:center
when he would start calling
me plain "Mayu" again.

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:22.384 position:50% align:center
And when the two of us would go
out together on a clear day,

00:22:22.467 --> 00:22:25.053 position:50% align:center
was still a little while off.
