[indistinct conversations]

2
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:11,416
[TAKUYA]
It's true.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,708
My friend here
touched her thigh.

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:19,208
But, come on. 100,000 yen
for a single bottle of beer?

5
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:21,541
Sorry, man,
but those are the rules.

6
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:22,791
See this?

7
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:26,791
To be fair,
that's really fine print.

8
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:28,208
'Kay, you win.

9
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:32,750
-I'll pay the 140K.
-Seriously?

10
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:36,000
In exchange, he gets 150K.

11
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:37,500
For medical bills and glasses.

12
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:40,750
You think you're
pretty hilarious, huh?

13
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,125
[door opens]

14
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,375
[KAIBARA] All right, all right,
that's enough.

15
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:46,500
Do me a favor
and take the hit this time.

16
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:48,208
[MAN 1]
Who the hell are you?

17
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:50,750
[MAN 2 sighs] Sorry,
we can't do that, Mr. Kaibara.

18
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:53,333
We've got rules in this place
for a reason.

19
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:57,041
I heard you guys
are expecting a pretty big deal

20
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:58,458
to go down real soon.

21
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:02,750
I'd be happy to keep that
from the police, though.

22
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:05,916
Yeah, I'd appreciate that.

23
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:08,666
Get back to work.

24
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:12,458
[scoffs]

25
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:15,708
Who are you?

26
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:19,083
You up for some ramen?

27
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:00,458
[YOSHIAKI] Lacuna is
a major organization, though.

28
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,125
I never would've thought
they'd be connected

29
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:04,708
to that little facility.

30
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:08,375
But it's true. So the police
can't do anything.

31
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:11,916
We'll need to find some really
solid evidence to crush them.

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,250
[KEIGO] The problem is
that the academy

33
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,750
is in the lock-down district,

34
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,000
so that's tricky.

35
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,625
It's gonna be helpful
having you two

36
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,583
since you know
what it's like inside.

37
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,625
[TAKUYA]
Is that what you really believe?

38
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,708
You honestly think
that's the only way to live?

39
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,708
Wow. You digging
a new flower bed?

40
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,250
[GEEK]
It's an underground shelter.

41
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:43,000
Who knows what's next,
you know what I mean?

42
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,916
Better to prepare.

43
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:51,375
Oh, the anemone. Beautiful.

44
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,083
[EIJI]
Yeah, they've grown well.

45
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,291
Did something happen?

46
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:59,041
Though very small, there was
a change of gravitational waves.

47
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,500
[EIJI]
Hmm.

48
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:01,750
Just as I thought.

49
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:06,958
[YUMIKO]
Here.

50
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:11,208
Thank you.
Hey, Yumiko?

51
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:14,416
Didn't Takuya come from the same
detective agency as you?

52
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,958
[YUMIKO]
Yes, until the Lost.

53
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,500
[YUKI] So, has he always
been like this?

54
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,458
[YUMIKO] I bet you're curious
about his past.

55
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:35,041
I'd be happy
to tell you what I know.

56
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,333
He has a very good reason
for being a lone courier,

57
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,041
now, that's for sure.

58
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,958
He has his reasons
for being more than

59
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,125
a little hung up
on contracts, too.

60
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,125
We're a pretty small agency.

61
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,750
But it makes us close,
like family.

62
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,833
Yumiko, Takuya,
take care of him, would you?

63
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:55,791
[YUMIKO]
Sure.

64
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:59,250
[KAIBARA] Well, have fun
but don't overdo it.

65
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,625
Take that last part
with a grain of salt.

66
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:06,250
This work requires dedication.

67
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,875
It's a dangerous job,

68
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:10,750
and sometimes we have
to operate outside the law.

69
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,791
[groaning softly]

70
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,916
Give me 50 more.

71
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,125
I don't know whether
it was sheer perseverance

72
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:21,541
or innate talent,

73
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,916
but Takuya's skills
got stronger and stronger.

74
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:28,000
Before anyone knew it,
he was the ace of our agency.

75
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,291
[KAIBARA] She's got some mileage
on her, but she runs great.

76
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,083
Take care of her.

77
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,416
You want me to ride a scooter?

78
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,208
Detectives and scooters
go together. Here.

79
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:53,541
Don't worry, I'll take care
of things here. Cool?

80
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:56,250
Sorry, we can't, Mr. Kakizaki.

81
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,625
Come on, help me out.

82
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:58,958
Let's go on patrol.

83
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:01,958
We can only give you an hour.

84
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,291
[YUJI]
Got it. Thanks.

85
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,208
[KAIBARA]
An undercover investigation.

86
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,083
The Ministry of Health,
Labor, and Welfare

87
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,250
wants to investigate
a possible case of abuse

88
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,708
at a certain orphanage.

89
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,083
Poor children.

90
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,625
Well, I'm obviously perfect
for this gig.

91
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,666
I'm great with people
and kids freaking love me,

92
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,833
you have no idea.

93
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:22,708
Nope, not this time. Takuya.

94
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:23,875
Will you take it?

95
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,166
Yes.

96
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,625
[KAIBARA]
You'll be infiltrating

97
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:31,208
the Light of Hope Academy
for Disabled Children.

98
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,916
[YOSHIAKI]
Look how run down it is.

99
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,291
[KEIGO] It's been three years
since the Lost.

100
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,791
The whole lock-down district
looks exactly like this.

101
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:44,083
I hope there's still
some evidence left in there.

102
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:47,833
Let's go.

Takahiko?

00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,458
Wait, where did
this kid come from?

110
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:11,708
Hey, where did you go?

111
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,958
You didn't clean
the rabbit hutch again.

112
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,333
I'm gonna tell
Mama Hinako on you.

113
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,583
[gasps in fear]
A noisy girl has appeared.

114
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:19,458
Block it out.

115
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:20,958
Karin.

116
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,208
Big Brother Takuya.

117
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,291
Did you buy us
some more bananas?

119

[HINAKO]
Takuya.

120
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,041
I'm glad you're back.

121
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:34,041
[TAKUYA]
Ayano. Hinako.

122
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,500
Everyone, the baby chicks
have finally hatched,

123
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:37,500
if you'd like to see.

124
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,958
Oh, they have? Yay!

125
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:42,875
[TAKAHIKO]
Can we play with them?

126
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:44,166
No, they were just born,

127
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,125
so we can't touch them
quite yet.

128
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,125
Would you like
to join us, Takuya?

129
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,000
[TAKAHIKO] She means
she's real lonely without you,

130
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,750
Big Brother Takuya.

131
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,416
I don't...
We'll go on ahead inside.

132
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,875
So, then, are all of 'em...

133
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,291
That's right. Tama-shi.

134
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:03,291
Both her and the kids.

135
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,166
They'd all gone to see
the circus together.

136
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,958
And they got caught in the Lost.

137
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:08,958
...disturb them too much.

138
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,375
Light of Hope Academy
for Disabled Children.

139
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:16,416
Turns out they actually have
a connection with you.

140
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,125
The things that were happening
to them were similar.

141
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,166
Huh. You're talking about

142
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,916
the suspected child abuse,
aren't you?

143
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,041
It was Takuya's mission
to find the truth,

144
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,291
and he took that mission
very seriously.

145
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,208
[TAKAHIKO] Are there really
chicks up there?

146
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:34,250
Oh, look.
They're peeking out now.

147
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,500
-[chirping]
-[NAOYA] Aw, they're so cute!

148
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:40,208
-Shh. Stop being so loud.
-[NAOYA] Right.

149
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:43,500
[KEIGO] It's an entire world
made by Tama-shi.

150
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:46,666
Sheesh. Anyone know
how to get out of here?

151
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:50,166
As far I know, the only way out
is for the Tama-shi

152
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,791
who made it to be released
from their regret somehow.

153
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,583
[YOSHIAKI]
So in order to leave,

154
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:55,750
first, we need to figure out

155
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,708
who created
this world and why,

156
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,083
do I have that right?

157
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:01,791
It's me.

158
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,583
[TAKUYA]
Listen to that chirping.

159
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,166
They're just like all of you.
