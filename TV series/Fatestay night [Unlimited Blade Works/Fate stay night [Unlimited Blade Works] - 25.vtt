Is that all you've got?

[Gilgamesh] You're just
a fake after all.

00:01:49.485 --> 00:01:52.324
You're incapable
of saving anything.

00:01:52.391 --> 00:01:56.032
It's so painfully obvious,
even Archer could tell.

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:58.838
Your ideals

00:02:18.376 --> 00:02:20.648
Equality is nonsense.

00:02:20.715 --> 00:02:24.623
A lie spouted by those too weak

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.531

<i>[Shirou] Yeah, he's right.</i>

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.110
<i>My feelings aren't my own.</i>

00:02:35.778 --> 00:02:37.582

00:02:42.491 --> 00:02:44.730

<i>and there was nothing</i>
<i>I could do to save them.</i>

00:02:50.107 --> 00:02:52.846
<i>I tried to convince myself</i>
<i>that people can't live without</i>

00:02:52.912 --> 00:02:54.516
<i>other sacrifice.</i>

00:02:54.583 --> 00:02:56.720
<i>Otherwise I could never</i>
<i>have survived.</i>

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:58.891
<i>That's why...</i>

00:03:00.661 --> 00:03:02.932
<i>That's why I had</i>
<i>so much admiration</i>

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:04.468
<i>for his ideal.</i>

00:03:04.903 --> 00:03:06.372
<i>Is that so wrong?</i>

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:10.013
<i>Are my feelings fake because</i>
<i>I got them from someone else?</i>

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.382
<i>And if so,</i>

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:13.554
<i>does that mean</i>
<i>I shouldn't even try?</i>

00:03:14.923 --> 00:03:17.729
No, there's no way that's true.

00:03:18.296 --> 00:03:21.402
<i>It doesn't matter if it's fake</i>
<i>or impossible to achieve.</i>

00:03:22.304 --> 00:03:24.609
I know I can't save everything,

00:03:24.676 --> 00:03:26.613
<i>and that you can't save</i>
<i>one person</i>

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.450
<i>without sacrificing another.</i>

00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:33.393
<i>And even though I knew it</i>
<i>was just an ideal,</i>

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.432
<i>I've longed for it more</i>
<i>and more every day.</i>

00:03:38.604 --> 00:03:41.710
<i>Even if I had to hurt some</i>
<i>to save many,</i>

00:03:41.777 --> 00:03:44.783
<i>I'd keep reaching for a world</i>
<i>where no one ever had</i>

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:45.818
<i>to get hurt again.</i>

00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:54.201
<i>In the end,</i>

00:03:54.268 --> 00:03:56.507
<i>this world was his reward.</i>

00:03:56.573 --> 00:03:59.211
<i>He once told me that</i>
<i>what I believe in‐‐</i>

00:03:59.278 --> 00:04:02.919
<i>what I've always believed in‐‐</i>
<i>was hypocritical.</i>

00:04:03.486 --> 00:04:05.457
<i>But despite what he said,</i>

00:04:05.525 --> 00:04:08.430
<i>he stayed true</i>
<i>to that same hypocrisy until</i>

00:04:08.496 --> 00:04:10.066
<i>the day he died.</i>

00:04:10.501 --> 00:04:12.404
<i>So I can, too.</i>

00:04:12.471 --> 00:04:14.308
<i>I don't care if it's</i>
<i>a borrowed ideal,</i>

00:04:14.375 --> 00:04:16.112
<i>or if it's fake.</i>

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.483
<i>It's still my ideal</i>

00:04:18.551 --> 00:04:19.986
<i>and I'm going to do whatever</i>

00:04:20.053 --> 00:04:22.759
<i>it takes to keep</i>
<i>that dream alive.</i>

00:04:23.126 --> 00:04:24.663
<i>Even if I never find</i>

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:27.000
<i>a single thing</i>
<i>I'm searching for.</i>

00:04:30.107 --> 00:04:31.743
I get it.

00:04:32.344 --> 00:04:35.585
All this time,
that was it.

00:04:36.854 --> 00:04:39.258
I'll admit that I
was holding back,

00:04:39.325 --> 00:04:42.565
but you must have been affected
by the blast from Ea.

00:04:42.632 --> 00:04:45.036
[Shirou] All those weapons
and you really expect me

00:04:45.103 --> 00:04:46.305
to believe you're holding back?

00:04:46.372 --> 00:04:47.809
Gimme a break.

00:04:47.876 --> 00:04:50.681
Ea was forged only
for supreme kings,

00:04:50.748 --> 00:04:53.988
and someone like you
isn't even worthy

00:04:54.054 --> 00:04:55.525
of gazing upon it.

00:05:06.613 --> 00:05:08.751
Are you okay, Shirou?

00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:11.189
I will take over from here.

00:05:11.255 --> 00:05:12.391
No.

00:05:12.457 --> 00:05:13.694
You go help Tohsaka.

00:05:13.761 --> 00:05:15.463
Make sure that she's okay.

00:05:15.531 --> 00:05:17.034
I can handle him.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.038
Just leave Gilgamesh to me.

00:05:21.977 --> 00:05:24.616
A mage is simply no match
for a servant.

00:05:24.683 --> 00:05:26.620
I know,
but remember.

00:05:26.687 --> 00:05:28.824
Both of us are exceptions
to the rules.

00:05:29.391 --> 00:05:30.427
Don't worry.

00:05:30.493 --> 00:05:31.864
I can beat him.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.399
I know I can!

00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:34.703
[gasps]

00:05:42.585 --> 00:05:44.054
Then good luck.

00:05:44.523 --> 00:05:46.627
I promise I will save Rin.

00:05:47.227 --> 00:05:48.096
[Shirou] Saber!

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.039
I tried my best but I'm sorry.

00:05:53.106 --> 00:05:54.074
I couldn't save you.

00:05:55.176 --> 00:05:56.547
[Shirou] But listen.

00:05:56.613 --> 00:05:58.918
I don't think this Grail
is what you hoped it would be.

00:05:58.984 --> 00:06:01.590
So go ahead and take
a good look.

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.130
Make sure that next time
you can get it right.

00:06:05.798 --> 00:06:06.767
Shirou.

00:06:07.201 --> 00:06:09.839
[Shirou] Sorry, it's kinda hard
to explain.

00:06:10.307 --> 00:06:13.547
I guess I never really had what
it takes to be your master.

00:06:14.215 --> 00:06:15.585
So...

00:06:16.385 --> 00:06:17.822
I don't think that's true.

00:06:18.624 --> 00:06:20.995
Shirou, you are my master.

00:06:21.062 --> 00:06:22.732
[exhales]

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:25.538
[Saber] I must go fulfill
my duty as a servant.

00:06:26.573 --> 00:06:29.111
We will continue afterwards.

00:06:39.231 --> 00:06:46.145
[laughing]

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:50.186
[Gilgamesh] Are you out
of your mind?

00:06:50.253 --> 00:06:53.059
You're seriously going
to sacrifice yourself instead

00:06:53.126 --> 00:06:54.763
of using Saber?

00:06:54.829 --> 00:06:56.165
You fool!

00:06:56.232 --> 00:06:58.637
Giving up your own life
so that someone else

00:06:58.704 --> 00:07:00.675
can keep theirs is a lie.

00:07:00.741 --> 00:07:02.979
Even now you still
can't see that,

00:07:03.046 --> 00:07:05.751
making you
an inveterate hypocrite.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.793
A hypocrite and a fraud.

00:07:09.859 --> 00:07:11.530
[Shirou] It's like you said.

00:07:11.596 --> 00:07:13.166
I'm a fake, remember?

00:07:13.867 --> 00:07:14.703
Hmm?

00:07:14.769 --> 00:07:16.707
[Shirou] But I had it all wrong.

00:07:16.773 --> 00:07:19.779
My skill has nothing
to do with making swords.

00:07:20.213 --> 00:07:22.852
There's only one thing I can do,

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:26.727
and that's give form
to what's in my mind!

00:07:27.595 --> 00:07:29.833
I am the bone of my sword!

00:07:30.501 --> 00:07:33.641
Steel is my body
and fire my blood.

00:07:33.707 --> 00:07:36.647

over 1,000 blades.

You see?

It's not swords I make.

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.284
I create a world

00:08:12.351 --> 00:08:13.554

There's no law that says

Keep an eye on me.

00:20:53.506 --> 00:20:56.512
I'm helpless,
but you already know that,

00:20:56.579 --> 00:20:58.817
so just be there for me.

00:21:00.252 --> 00:21:02.356

[whimpers]

00:21:03.025 --> 00:21:04.595

I promise I'll try.

00:21:08.202 --> 00:21:10.406
I'll do my best to make sure
he doesn't turn into

a jerk like you,

00:21:12.076 --> 00:21:14.748
and I promise I'll do all I can
to get him to learn

00:21:14.815 --> 00:21:16.184
to like himself.

00:21:16.251 --> 00:21:17.855
You do the same, okay?

00:21:19.257 --> 00:21:21.061
That's good enough for me.

00:21:21.762 --> 00:21:24.367
Don't worry, Tohsaka.
I'll be fine.

00:21:24.935 --> 00:21:26.138
I swear.

00:21:26.204 --> 00:21:28.041

[Rin] Dammit.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.905
I didn't even get a chance
to chew him out.
