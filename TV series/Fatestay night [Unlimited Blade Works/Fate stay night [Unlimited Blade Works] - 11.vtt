Mr. Kuzuki's the master.

[Shirou] I've heard that you're

00:11:30.446 --> 00:11:32.818
Which means you
couldn't possibly overlook

00:11:32.885 --> 00:11:34.622
the things Caster is doing.

<i>[Souichirou] What exactly</i>

00:11:38.062 --> 00:11:40.066

from people everywhere all over
<i>the town.</i>

00:11:42.672 --> 00:11:46.478
Those people are nothing more
than sacrificial lambs to her.

00:11:47.047 --> 00:11:49.886
As long as Caster keeps
draining people like this,

00:11:49.953 --> 00:11:52.424
she'll eventually end up
murdering somebody.

00:11:53.125 --> 00:11:55.531
There's simply no way
to avoid that from happening.

00:11:55.598 --> 00:11:57.167
It's inevitable.

00:11:57.234 --> 00:11:58.570
So I see.

00:11:58.637 --> 00:12:01.910
And that is the reason you think
that I would turn a blind eye

00:12:01.977 --> 00:12:04.716
to her deeds and why I,
her master,

00:12:04.782 --> 00:12:06.553
would actually be under
her control?

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:07.755
[Shirou] Yeah.

00:12:07.822 --> 00:12:09.124
So if that's the case,

00:12:09.191 --> 00:12:11.362
we'll only take down Caster,

00:12:11.428 --> 00:12:14.401
but if you gave Caster
free reign knowing full well

00:12:14.468 --> 00:12:15.771
what she was doing,

00:12:15.838 --> 00:12:18.543
then you're
a cold‐blooded murderer

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:20.313

but all I could do back then
was just mimic.

00:18:38.035 --> 00:18:39.639
There wasn't any substance
to it.

00:18:39.772 --> 00:18:40.841
Trust me.

00:18:40.907 --> 00:18:43.613
I'm just as surprised
as you are at this.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:46.118
So what you're saying
is you mastered projection

00:18:46.184 --> 00:18:47.086
before strengthening?

00:18:47.153 --> 00:18:48.255
Yeah, but look.

00:18:48.322 --> 00:18:49.959
It was the only thing
I could do.

00:18:50.359 --> 00:18:52.163
[Shirou] Kiritsugu said
it was totally useless

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:54.067
and that I should focus
on strengthening.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.537
He was right.

00:18:55.604 --> 00:18:57.708
I probably would have said
the same thing.

00:18:58.475 --> 00:19:01.415
[Rin] Still,
it's awfully strange.

00:19:01.916 --> 00:19:02.818
[Shirou] What do you mean?

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.289
[Rin] Let's get outta here.

00:19:05.724 --> 00:19:06.726
Mm?

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:09.497
[winces]

00:19:09.565 --> 00:19:10.499
Shirou!

00:19:11.001 --> 00:19:12.103
[gasps]

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:13.673
[Shirou] I'm okay.

00:19:23.025 --> 00:19:25.931
[creatures squeaking]

00:19:28.536 --> 00:19:31.776
[Shinji] Ah,
so this is where you were.

00:19:32.143 --> 00:19:33.479
[chuckles nervously]
Just so you know,

00:19:33.546 --> 00:19:35.282
I didn't come here to complain.

00:19:35.717 --> 00:19:38.890
Honestly, I don't care at all
where you go or what you do.

00:19:38.957 --> 00:19:40.092
But listen.

00:19:40.159 --> 00:19:42.230
I have some really great news
for you.

00:19:42.296 --> 00:19:44.300
Kotomine says he'll turn
a blind eye

00:19:44.367 --> 00:19:46.304
to anything we do!
Isn't that great?

00:19:46.839 --> 00:19:47.975
I see.

00:19:48.042 --> 00:19:50.580
The priest seems
to think rather highly of you.

00:19:50.947 --> 00:19:54.087
Yeah, well,
I think he sees my true ability.

00:19:54.622 --> 00:19:56.559
I'll give him a little token
of appreciation

00:19:56.626 --> 00:19:58.930
once I get my hands
on the Grail.

00:19:58.997 --> 00:20:00.199
So then,

00:20:00.266 --> 00:20:02.370
when do we start
killing everyone in sight?

00:20:02.437 --> 00:20:04.007
I can't wait for you
to gobble up souls

00:20:04.074 --> 00:20:07.246
so you can get stronger,
and then it'll be their turn!

00:20:07.313 --> 00:20:09.451
It's gonna be great!
[laughs]

00:20:09.518 --> 00:20:12.156
I'm going to even
the score with Emiya.

00:20:12.223 --> 00:20:14.628
We're going to have such
a good time.

00:20:16.899 --> 00:20:18.737
[groaning]

00:20:18.803 --> 00:20:20.206
Shinji.

00:20:20.574 --> 00:20:23.412
You have no clue as to what
the Grail is all about.

00:20:23.479 --> 00:20:25.316
[gasps]
What?

00:20:26.351 --> 00:20:28.288
If you really desire the grail,

00:20:28.355 --> 00:20:30.861
you should start ignoring
the other masters.

00:20:31.394 --> 00:20:34.502
For they are nothing more
than living sacrifices.

00:20:35.035 --> 00:20:38.041
But there are other matters
that we must attend to first.

00:20:38.442 --> 00:20:40.647
Oh, yeah?
Like what other matters?

00:20:41.014 --> 00:20:44.154
Well, it's not like
I don't understand how you feel.

00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:47.393
I know the sweet taste
of revenge.

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:50.266
To seek out pleasure is a sign
that one is human.

00:20:50.901 --> 00:20:53.773
Once I have done what needs
to be done,

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:56.846
then I shall be more than happy
to join you.

00:20:56.913 --> 00:20:57.981
[gulps]

00:20:58.248 --> 00:20:59.718
Oh, hey!

00:20:59.785 --> 00:21:02.089
I never got the chance
to ask you what your wish was.

00:21:02.156 --> 00:21:03.459
What is it?
Tell me.

00:21:05.597 --> 00:21:08.435
I have a great taste
for extravagance.

00:21:08.503 --> 00:21:11.943
Extravagant decoration
is to be admired above all.

00:21:12.611 --> 00:21:14.782
But there is no sense
in wasting time

00:21:14.849 --> 00:21:16.084
on the superfluous.

00:21:16.151 --> 00:21:18.455
[Shinji] Oh, what do you mean?

00:21:19.057 --> 00:21:20.259
[Gilgamesh] A long time ago,

00:21:20.326 --> 00:21:22.363
I put together a group
of ten slaves with

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:23.633
the intention of slaying

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:25.570
the ones that would never
be missed.

00:21:26.772 --> 00:21:29.010
What do you suppose happened?

00:21:29.545 --> 00:21:32.651
[Shinji] Well, I suppose
you ended up killing them all?

00:21:34.788 --> 00:21:37.126
[Gilgamesh] I found I could not
slay any of them.

00:21:37.928 --> 00:21:41.301
They were simple laborers,
none of them with no value.

00:21:41.368 --> 00:21:42.771
Not in the old world.

00:21:44.942 --> 00:21:48.215
But this world is overflowing
with the superfluous.

00:21:48.917 --> 00:21:51.923
I could choose ten men,
perhaps even thousands of men,

00:21:51.989 --> 00:21:55.196
and I would not find one
of whom I then could not kill.

00:21:55.997 --> 00:21:58.302
[Shinji] Sorry, but I don't
get what you're saying.

00:21:58.368 --> 00:22:00.105
So what is it
that you really want?

00:22:00.172 --> 00:22:02.076
It's quite simple, really.

00:22:02.578 --> 00:22:04.414
Too much of any one thing

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.886
can be quite sickening
in the end.

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.422
