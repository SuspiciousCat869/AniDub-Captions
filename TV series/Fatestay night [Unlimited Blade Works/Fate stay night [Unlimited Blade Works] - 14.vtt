that man on, Rin.

00:10:35.436 --> 00:10:36.740
Nothing at all.

00:10:36.807 --> 00:10:38.777
If you didn't actually see
his corpse,

00:10:38.844 --> 00:10:40.548
he's still clinging
to life somewhere,

00:10:40.614 --> 00:10:41.616
that's all.

00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:43.186
[Rin] But enough about him.

00:10:43.252 --> 00:10:44.889
Let's get this over with.

00:10:44.956 --> 00:10:46.827
You don't have
a human shield this time,

00:10:46.893 --> 00:10:48.630
so I can go all out.

00:10:49.031 --> 00:10:52.337
Do you really think that you
can beat me in a magic battle?

00:10:52.404 --> 00:10:54.809
It depends on how I do it.

00:10:54.876 --> 00:10:56.546
I can see that
you don't have control

00:10:56.613 --> 00:10:57.949
over Saber yet.

00:10:58.015 --> 00:11:00.888
Also, I know how strong
Mr. Kuzuki is.

00:11:00.955 --> 00:11:04.027
He's no match for my Archer.

00:11:04.428 --> 00:11:05.998
Are you ready to do this?

00:11:06.398 --> 00:11:07.668
Yes, I'm ready.

00:11:08.202 --> 00:11:10.206
[Archer] As planned, then, Rin?

00:11:10.273 --> 00:11:11.475
[Rin] Yes.

00:11:11.543 --> 00:11:13.346
I won't hold back.

00:11:13.412 --> 00:11:15.250
I'm using everything I've got.

00:11:20.493 --> 00:11:23.165
[haunting whispers]

00:11:23.232 --> 00:11:24.936
Oh, how adorable.

00:11:25.003 --> 00:11:27.909
You think you can take me
one‐on‐one.

00:11:30.313 --> 00:11:33.787
However, aren't you forgetting
the powerful trump card

00:11:33.854 --> 00:11:35.356
I'm holding?

00:11:35.423 --> 00:11:37.027
Using my command seals,

00:11:37.093 --> 00:11:40.333
I could make Saber my puppet
right now if I desired.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.805
All right, then.
Why don't you try it?

00:11:42.872 --> 00:11:44.742
Saber could resist easily.

00:11:45.043 --> 00:11:47.715
[Rin] I don't know if it
would be for one minute or two,

00:11:47.782 --> 00:11:52.490
but that's enough time
to take you down

00:11:52.558 --> 00:11:53.894
and you know it!

00:11:53.961 --> 00:11:57.467
[magical booming]

00:12:03.312 --> 00:12:04.348
[gasps]

00:12:07.387 --> 00:12:08.422
[grunts]

00:12:08.489 --> 00:12:10.126
A distraction?
[gasps]

00:12:10.193 --> 00:12:12.264
Now come down
so I can kick your ass!

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:16.372
Archer!

00:12:19.177 --> 00:12:20.179
[whooshes]

00:12:20.246 --> 00:12:21.248
[snickers]

00:12:22.417 --> 00:12:23.486
[blow lands]

00:12:28.296 --> 00:12:29.532
[gasps]

00:12:29.599 --> 00:12:30.734
Dammit!

00:12:30.801 --> 00:12:32.203
Archer, why?

00:12:33.974 --> 00:12:35.310
[grunts]
[booming]

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:43.292
What do you think you're doing?

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.096
[Rin] Archer!

00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:47.868
You see,

00:12:47.935 --> 00:12:49.939
defeating her here struck me
as more than just

00:12:50.006 --> 00:12:51.876
a little idealistic.

00:12:51.943 --> 00:12:53.714
[Archer] When it comes
to escaping,

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.216
she's the best there is.

00:12:55.718 --> 00:12:57.153
After all,

00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.592
she's a woman who would tear
her own younger brother

00:12:59.659 --> 00:13:00.995
to pieces to escape.

00:13:01.997 --> 00:13:04.334
You talk as if
you know who I am.

00:13:04.401 --> 00:13:07.842
Are you trying to imply
you know my true identity?

00:13:07.908 --> 00:13:10.079
[Archer] Using dragon teeth
as vessels

00:13:10.146 --> 00:13:11.783
are the hallmark
of the magecraft

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:13.452
of the King of Colchis.

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.291
His daughter‐‐
the princess Medea‐‐

00:13:16.358 --> 00:13:19.131
is widely hailed
as a witch without peer.

00:13:19.197 --> 00:13:20.433
[grunts]

00:13:21.101 --> 00:13:22.938
That son of a bitch!

00:13:28.449 --> 00:13:29.484
[scoffs]

00:13:29.552 --> 00:13:31.088
[shudders]

00:13:32.223 --> 00:13:34.094
[Archer] If I may ask,
Caster,

00:13:34.161 --> 00:13:35.664
do you have
sufficient energy left

00:13:35.731 --> 00:13:38.770
to sustain yourself
and one additional servant?

00:13:38.837 --> 00:13:41.910
Archer, what are you doing?

00:13:45.283 --> 00:13:48.757
[laughing]

00:13:48.824 --> 00:13:50.426
[Caster] Of course.

00:13:50.493 --> 00:13:53.967
I have more than enough mana
to sustain not just one more

00:13:54.034 --> 00:13:55.938
but all the servants.

00:13:56.005 --> 00:13:58.109
Then that simplifies things.

00:13:58.476 --> 00:13:59.712
All right, then, Caster.

00:13:59.779 --> 00:14:02.350
[Archer] I will take you up
on your earlier offer.

00:14:02.417 --> 00:14:03.352
[gasps]

00:14:03.419 --> 00:14:04.856
[snarls]

00:14:04.922 --> 00:14:07.628
So what is it
that changed your mind?

00:14:07.695 --> 00:14:11.368
The situation has changed
with Saber under your control.

00:14:11.435 --> 00:14:14.141
It's only natural
that I switch sides.

00:14:17.213 --> 00:14:20.420
I do not trust traitors
who betray their masters.

00:14:20.486 --> 00:14:22.190
Nor should you.

00:14:22.257 --> 00:14:25.329
I'm only yielding to you
for my own benefit.

00:14:25.864 --> 00:14:28.269
There's no trust
or loyalty in that.

00:14:28.804 --> 00:14:30.574
But isn't that
how all servants are

00:14:30.641 --> 00:14:32.545
by their very nature?

00:14:32.945 --> 00:14:35.149
Huh.
Very well.

00:14:35.517 --> 00:14:37.588
If I could not keep control
of you myself,

00:14:37.655 --> 00:14:40.761
it would speak poorly
of my magical abilities.

00:14:40.828 --> 00:14:42.531
My offer still stands.

00:14:42.598 --> 00:14:45.403
I will give you
what you wish for.

00:14:45.904 --> 00:14:47.641
[booming]
[gasps]

00:14:47.708 --> 00:14:49.344
[grunting]

00:14:55.691 --> 00:14:56.760
Tohsaka!

00:14:56.826 --> 00:14:58.530
‐ [gasps]
‐ [grunts]

00:14:58.597 --> 00:15:00.934
[groaning]

00:15:01.536 --> 00:15:05.176
[shouting]

00:15:06.345 --> 00:15:08.115
‐ [grunts]
‐ [shouts]

00:15:08.182 --> 00:15:10.420
[both groaning]

00:15:10.486 --> 00:15:11.623
Trace...

00:15:11.823 --> 00:15:12.992
On!

00:15:22.477 --> 00:15:25.851
[wincing]

00:15:25.918 --> 00:15:27.120
You idiot!

00:15:27.187 --> 00:15:28.657
What were you thinking?

00:15:29.926 --> 00:15:32.330
Nice try but not enough.

00:15:32.397 --> 00:15:34.802
Your interruption
was an irritating surprise,

00:15:34.869 --> 00:15:36.773
but the outcome is the same.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.478
I shall finish you here and now.

00:15:39.846 --> 00:15:41.950
[Archer] No.
Wait, Caster.

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:48.129
I want to attach one condition
to me joining your forces.

00:15:48.195 --> 00:15:49.699
What are you talking about?

00:15:51.001 --> 00:15:52.605
[Archer] I'll surrender
my freedom to you

00:15:52.671 --> 00:15:53.807
without resistance.

00:15:53.874 --> 00:15:56.846
My price is that you let
them both leave here alive

00:15:56.913 --> 00:15:57.982
and uninjured.

00:15:58.048 --> 00:15:59.484
[scoffs]

00:15:59.952 --> 00:16:01.255
For all your words and actions,

00:16:01.321 --> 00:16:03.359
you're just a softie.

00:16:03.627 --> 00:16:04.829
No.

00:16:04.896 --> 00:16:07.233
I thought it would be wrong
for a heroic spirit

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.839
to cut down his former master.

00:16:10.473 --> 00:16:13.245
It's odd
to hear common decency coming

00:16:13.312 --> 00:16:15.416
from the mouth
of someone who's a traitor.

00:16:15.483 --> 00:16:16.853
[whooshing]

00:16:16.953 --> 00:16:18.155
[both groaning]

00:16:18.222 --> 00:16:20.293
[Caster] Very well.
I shall let them go,

00:16:20.359 --> 00:16:23.700
but I promise if they ever get
in my way again...

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.604
Yes, of course.

00:16:25.671 --> 00:16:28.910
If they prove foolish enough
to take up a hopeless fight,

00:16:28.977 --> 00:16:31.148
they'll simply be annihilated.

00:16:31.215 --> 00:16:32.651
Archer's right.

00:16:32.718 --> 00:16:34.989
Let's get out
of here while we can.

00:16:35.691 --> 00:16:37.026
[Archer] If you hate me,

00:16:37.093 --> 00:16:38.630
it is misplaced, Rin.

00:16:38.697 --> 00:16:41.669
This woman just happens
to be the superior master.

00:16:41.736 --> 00:16:43.005
That's all.

00:16:43.072 --> 00:16:45.911
I always side
with the most powerful.

00:16:45.978 --> 00:16:47.681
[Rin] That's true.

00:16:47.982 --> 00:16:49.317
But you'll regret it.

00:16:49.652 --> 00:16:51.154
Because I'll never quit.

00:16:52.123 --> 00:16:53.425
You hear me?

00:16:53.492 --> 00:16:56.164
I'll defeat Caster
and then take you back.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.870
And once I do that...

00:16:59.605 --> 00:17:01.676
I won't forgive you,
no matter what.

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:03.379
[grunts]

00:17:12.998 --> 00:17:15.102
[Shirou groaning]

00:17:15.169 --> 00:17:17.106
That's what you get
for that stunt!

00:17:17.173 --> 00:17:19.211
Just sit down and rest,
all right?

00:17:19.411 --> 00:17:20.514
No.

00:17:20.581 --> 00:17:22.851
Let's get back to my place
as soon as we can.

00:17:23.152 --> 00:17:24.789
And don't worry.
I'm okay.

00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:26.693
No, you're not.

00:17:26.759 --> 00:17:28.195
Don't try to tell me you're okay

00:17:28.262 --> 00:17:29.832
when you've got
an injury like that.

00:17:30.099 --> 00:17:31.368
[groans]

00:17:31.435 --> 00:17:32.805
Are you even listening?

00:17:32.871 --> 00:17:35.777
I mean, why did you have
to come here in the first place?

00:17:35.844 --> 00:17:38.617
Couldn't you tell right away
that the church wasn't safe?

00:17:38.683 --> 00:17:40.052
I'm not that stupid.

00:17:40.119 --> 00:17:41.522
Of course I knew it wasn't.

00:17:41.589 --> 00:17:43.727
Then you should have turned
right around, you idiot!

00:17:43.793 --> 00:17:46.265
How could you try
a projection like that?

00:17:46.331 --> 00:17:48.803
Doing that's only gonna make
your injuries worse,

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:51.576
and you're trying to tell me
that you're not in pain?

00:17:51.643 --> 00:17:54.180
[Rin grunts]
You're so messed up!

00:17:55.416 --> 00:17:58.122
You know,
you're hurting worse than I am.

00:17:58.188 --> 00:17:59.491
[gasps]

00:17:59.558 --> 00:18:00.794
So let's go home.

00:18:01.796 --> 00:18:02.765
Once we get there,

00:18:02.831 --> 00:18:04.568
you can gripe
and moan all you want.

00:18:06.204 --> 00:18:07.340
[gasps]

00:18:12.216 --> 00:18:13.753
[Shirou shudders]

00:18:14.956 --> 00:18:16.626
I can't believe it.

00:18:16.993 --> 00:18:19.164
The guy actually made me cry.

00:18:21.134 --> 00:18:23.540
Uh, T‐‐Tohsaka,
what are you...

00:18:24.742 --> 00:18:25.844
Shut up.

00:18:25.911 --> 00:18:27.447
You're gonna make this right.

00:18:33.225 --> 00:18:34.427
Listen.

00:18:34.494 --> 00:18:36.365
Don't you dare turn around,
got it?

00:18:39.104 --> 00:18:40.306
If you see my face,

00:18:40.373 --> 00:18:41.776
I'll get really mad.

00:18:42.711 --> 00:18:43.713
[Shirou groans]

00:18:46.318 --> 00:18:47.688
[Rin] Archer was right.

00:18:49.625 --> 00:18:51.929
I should have defeated Caster
when I had the chance

00:18:51.996 --> 00:18:53.165
no matter what.

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.837
I'm not whining
or anything like that.

00:18:56.639 --> 00:18:57.608
But...

00:18:58.075 --> 00:19:01.281
I always seem to mess up
on the most important things.

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:03.452
The less important things,

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.524
I can get done easily enough.

00:19:07.026 --> 00:19:09.431
I don't know why,
but I've always been like that.

00:19:10.567 --> 00:19:12.571
Archer's not
the only one at fault,

00:19:12.638 --> 00:19:14.474
for going over
to Caster's side.

00:19:15.309 --> 00:19:16.946
Boy, what a mess.

00:19:17.347 --> 00:19:19.150
After all my big talk...

00:19:20.319 --> 00:19:22.256
I suddenly find myself cornered.

00:19:25.564 --> 00:19:27.367
I think this
is where you're supposed

00:19:27.433 --> 00:19:29.070
to ask me by what.

00:19:29.572 --> 00:19:33.178
Oh, so, what was it
that you were cornered by?

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.751
[Rin] I wish I hadn't
heard you earlier.

00:19:35.817 --> 00:19:38.823
I'm even more depressed now
that I totally failed.

00:19:39.457 --> 00:19:41.395
You'll feel better soon,
all right?

00:19:41.829 --> 00:19:43.900
You haven't done anything
to beat yourself up over,

00:19:43.967 --> 00:19:44.969
you know?

00:19:45.369 --> 00:19:46.606
Yes, I have.

00:19:47.206 --> 00:19:50.046
We're in this big mess because
my strategy turned out

00:19:50.112 --> 00:19:51.281
to be wrong.

00:19:51.783 --> 00:19:53.820
[Shirou] All that means
is that you failed

00:19:53.887 --> 00:19:55.256
in one aspect of it.

00:19:55.824 --> 00:19:57.694
But that doesn't mean
you were wrong.

00:19:58.262 --> 00:19:59.431
[exhales sharply]

00:19:59.965 --> 00:20:03.973
[Shirou] To be honest,
I admire how brilliant you are.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:05.944
I don't regret things, either.

00:20:06.512 --> 00:20:09.451
I believe that what I've done
was the right thing to do.

00:20:09.885 --> 00:20:10.987
But...

00:20:11.522 --> 00:20:13.459
That belief is a patchwork.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:17.901
But I bet you'd pay back double
whatever you got,

00:20:17.968 --> 00:20:20.473
once you've pushed all
that regret out of your system.

00:20:21.141 --> 00:20:22.544
[grunts]

00:20:25.684 --> 00:20:26.786
By the way,

00:20:26.853 --> 00:20:28.857
why did you come
and try to save me?

00:20:28.923 --> 00:20:30.459
[Shirou grunts]

00:20:32.698 --> 00:20:35.369
W‐‐Wha‐‐
how did you get that?

00:20:36.405 --> 00:20:38.008
You can have it back,
if you want.

00:20:38.442 --> 00:20:40.446
I have another pendant
just like it.

00:20:40.514 --> 00:20:42.618
I keep it hidden in my bedroom.

00:20:42.684 --> 00:20:45.456
It was lying next
to me after Lancer's attack.

00:20:46.057 --> 00:20:49.297
I grabbed it after I came to
and have had it since.

00:20:49.899 --> 00:20:52.437
You say that you have one
just like it at home?

00:20:52.704 --> 00:20:53.673
[gasps]

00:20:54.708 --> 00:20:55.510
Huh?

00:20:55.577 --> 00:20:57.280
Did I say something strange?

00:20:57.581 --> 00:20:59.718
Um, no, not really.

00:21:00.119 --> 00:21:01.221
But you lost me.

00:21:01.288 --> 00:21:02.691
Why would this be a reason

00:21:02.758 --> 00:21:04.562
for you to come try to save me?

00:21:05.496 --> 00:21:07.300
[Shirou] Well...

00:21:11.809 --> 00:21:13.112
[exhales sharply]

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:15.917
I've gotta admit,
that was an excuse.

00:21:16.619 --> 00:21:18.322
<i>[Shirou] To come clean</i>
<i>with you...</i>

00:21:18.823 --> 00:21:21.929
I've always adored
and watched you from a distance,

00:21:21.996 --> 00:21:24.000
but it was complicated.

00:21:24.067 --> 00:21:25.202
[grunts]

00:21:25.269 --> 00:21:26.404
[Shirou] When I finally
got around

00:21:26.471 --> 00:21:29.277
to talking to you,
I fell for you even more.

00:21:29.778 --> 00:21:31.816
‐ [grunts]
‐ [Shirou] So I just jumped down

00:21:31.883 --> 00:21:33.252
to help you without
even thinking.

00:21:33.318 --> 00:21:34.588
That's all.

00:21:35.389 --> 00:21:36.759
[grunts]

00:21:36.826 --> 00:21:38.796
‐ [shouts]
‐ Hey, what's with you?

00:21:38.863 --> 00:21:41.101
If you go blurting out things
like that without thinking,

00:21:41.168 --> 00:21:43.907
you'll end up giving people
the wrong idea!

00:21:43.973 --> 00:21:45.109
What do you mean?

00:21:45.176 --> 00:21:47.046
I really do have feelings
for you.

00:21:47.113 --> 00:21:48.482
Y‐‐You jerk!

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:49.952
You hopeless idiot!

00:21:53.125 --> 00:21:54.728

00:21:55.229 --> 00:21:57.500
Uh...
[gasps]

00:21:58.736 --> 00:22:00.841
Thanks for coming
to my rescue.

00:22:01.241 --> 00:22:04.013
I'm so happy you saved me.
