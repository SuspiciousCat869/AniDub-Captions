Why is Lancer helping them?

[Souichirou] Something wrong,
Caster?

00:00:25.183 --> 00:00:27.087
There's no problem here,

There's a question that I've

Well, what is it?

00:00:45.592 --> 00:00:48.163

you have no desires to speak of.

All humans have these
to some degree or another,

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:08.671
but you have never spoken
of any of them.

00:01:08.738 --> 00:01:12.712
You are without desires,
and yet you have an objective?

00:01:14.115 --> 00:01:15.450

<i>with whom I had no quarrel.</i>

00:01:29.345 --> 00:01:31.750
<i>I stood to gain nothing</i>

00:01:32.117 --> 00:01:34.088

That was unexpected.

00:11:41.536 --> 00:11:44.876
To think there's a spear
that can penetrate the Aias.

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:46.513
Impressive.

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:49.819
It's even stronger than
the original Gungnir.

[Lancer] I doubt that.

00:11:56.465 --> 00:11:58.604

Yes, depending on the situation,

it didn't work perfectly,

00:12:04.816 --> 00:12:07.354
even though I used up almost all
my mana.

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:09.057
I lost use of an arm

00:12:09.124 --> 00:12:11.529

was completely destroyed.

Sad to say,

00:12:13.165 --> 00:12:14.869

powerful defense

[Archer] More importantly,
have you noticed?

00:12:21.048 --> 00:12:22.985

her hands full.

Yes, of course.

00:12:39.117 --> 00:12:42.223

[Souichirou] I see.

00:20:16.398 --> 00:20:17.467
[Souichirou] It's true.

00:20:17.534 --> 00:20:19.638
I don't have a reason
to fight.

00:20:19.705 --> 00:20:22.443
I never had any interest
in the Holy Grail.

00:20:22.511 --> 00:20:24.582
You and I are alike in that way.

00:20:24.648 --> 00:20:25.584
Then why?

00:20:28.021 --> 00:20:30.961
[Souichirou] Because I have
to finish what I started.

00:20:31.428 --> 00:20:33.332
I joined this fight
without concern

00:20:33.398 --> 00:20:34.835
for good or evil,

00:20:34.902 --> 00:20:37.975
but I can't walk away until
I've seen it through.

00:20:45.022 --> 00:20:45.991

00:21:18.155 --> 00:21:20.594
[Saber wincing]

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:21.662
Shirou.

00:21:21.729 --> 00:21:22.764
[gasps]

00:21:23.432 --> 00:21:24.668

00:21:24.735 --> 00:21:26.037
[gasps]

00:21:27.106 --> 00:21:28.977
Damn.
Not even close.

00:21:29.043 --> 00:21:31.014
Archer, what are you doing?

00:21:31.081 --> 00:21:33.285
Drop the macho act, okay?

00:21:33.352 --> 00:21:34.955
Caster's already been beaten

00:21:35.022 --> 00:21:37.226
and I've had it
with all your nonsense!

00:21:37.293 --> 00:21:39.364
I see you have,

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:42.203
but fortunately I don't need
your permission.

00:21:42.638 --> 00:21:44.508
You are not my master,
after all.

00:21:44.975 --> 00:21:45.911
[gasps]

00:21:45.977 --> 00:21:47.180
[screams]

00:21:47.246 --> 00:21:49.718
Consider our
contract terminated.

00:21:50.352 --> 00:21:51.656
It can't be!

00:21:51.722 --> 00:21:53.492
Why are you doing this?

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.664
Archer,
you still wanna kill Shirou,

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:56.732
don't you?

00:21:56.799 --> 00:21:58.168
‐ [Archer] Of course.
‐ [grunting]

00:21:58.235 --> 00:22:01.576
[Archer] I'll kill Shirou Emiya
with my bare hands.

00:22:01.642 --> 00:22:04.380
After I was reduced
to a lowly guardian,

00:22:04.447 --> 00:22:08.222
this became my only wish.
