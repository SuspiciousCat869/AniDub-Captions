00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:23.673
<i>The Japanese islands are under</i>

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:26.144
<i>a strong winter pressure</i>
<i>distribution pattern...</i>

00:18:26.211 --> 00:18:27.948
[Shirou] Hello?

00:18:28.349 --> 00:18:30.186
Earth to Ms. Fujimura.

00:18:30.252 --> 00:18:31.589
Are you ignoring me?

00:18:31.656 --> 00:18:33.560
[Taiga] Sorry,
request denied.

00:18:33.893 --> 00:18:36.532
I won't be able
to walk Sakura home for a while.

00:18:36.599 --> 00:18:37.701
And why is that?

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:41.308
[grunting]

00:18:41.375 --> 00:18:44.147
Because starting tonight,
I'll be staying here, too!

00:18:44.214 --> 00:18:45.684
What?

00:18:45.751 --> 00:18:47.721
Care to join me, Sakura?

00:18:47.788 --> 00:18:48.690
I can call your home

00:18:48.757 --> 00:18:50.059
to make sure
it's okay with them,

00:18:50.126 --> 00:18:51.395
so you don't have to worry.

00:18:51.461 --> 00:18:52.898
[gasps]
Oh, yes!

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:54.200
Thanks!

00:18:54.267 --> 00:18:56.138
I can always count on you,
Ms. Fujimura.

00:18:56.204 --> 00:18:57.941
[grunts]
Huh?

00:18:58.008 --> 00:18:59.277
All right!

00:18:59.344 --> 00:19:01.716
Let's use the big room
in the back of the house!

00:19:01.783 --> 00:19:03.419
There's lots of futons!

00:19:03.485 --> 00:19:05.456
You don't mind,
do you, Saber?

00:19:05.524 --> 00:19:06.926
Mm.

00:19:06.993 --> 00:19:09.364
[chuckles nervously]

00:19:22.056 --> 00:19:25.630
[snarling]

00:19:25.697 --> 00:19:26.933
[grunts]

00:19:27.634 --> 00:19:28.870
[snarling]

00:19:38.823 --> 00:19:40.694
[crashing]

00:19:41.863 --> 00:19:42.865

[grunts]
[booming]

00:20:09.518 --> 00:20:11.455
What kind of incense is this?

00:20:11.522 --> 00:20:13.560
It's a witch's incense.

00:20:13.626 --> 00:20:14.595
Powerful.

00:20:14.662 --> 00:20:17.066
It supposedly destroys love.

00:20:17.534 --> 00:20:19.805
[Archer] In which case,
we're dealing with a woman here.

00:20:20.507 --> 00:20:21.909
Her rage must be deep

00:20:21.976 --> 00:20:24.548
to be vented
even after becoming a servant.

00:20:24.615 --> 00:20:27.621
Quit chattering
and open the windows already.

00:20:29.558 --> 00:20:30.994
[groans]

00:20:34.835 --> 00:20:37.206
<i>[Archer] The flow</i>
<i>is towards Ryuudou Temple?</i>

00:20:37.574 --> 00:20:39.411
[Rin] Yes,
all the stolen life force

00:20:39.477 --> 00:20:41.281
is flowing towards
the mountains.

00:20:41.749 --> 00:20:43.853
The culprit behind
all those comas

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:45.289
is probably Caster.

00:20:45.356 --> 00:20:47.895
So there's a witch lurking
at the temple.

00:20:47.961 --> 00:20:51.001
That means we made
a mistake last night.

00:20:51.334 --> 00:20:52.504
Mistake?

00:20:52.704 --> 00:20:55.176
Fighting Berserker to a draw,
you mean?

00:20:55.242 --> 00:20:57.079
I think that
was the optimal outcome.

00:20:57.146 --> 00:20:58.616
[Archer] I'm not so sure.

00:20:58.683 --> 00:21:01.556
If caster has spread such
a wide net around the city,

00:21:01.622 --> 00:21:04.394
she must have observed
last night's battle in detail,

00:21:04.461 --> 00:21:06.164
and if that's not bad enough,

00:21:06.231 --> 00:21:08.937
we tipped our own hand while at
the same time failing

00:21:09.003 --> 00:21:10.306
to defeat our opponent.

00:21:12.076 --> 00:21:13.445
I'm not so sure.

00:21:14.949 --> 00:21:16.351
[Rin] We'll track Caster.

00:21:16.819 --> 00:21:19.124
You can still sense her,
can't you?

00:21:19.491 --> 00:21:22.531
We'll finish this before
she can run to Ryuudou Temple.

00:21:22.598 --> 00:21:24.334
[Archer] I thought it
was your policy not

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.706
to do things you knew
were beyond your ability.

00:21:26.772 --> 00:21:30.112
It is,
but this is a special case.

00:21:30.814 --> 00:21:32.851
[Archer] You won't be satisfied
unless you pick

00:21:32.918 --> 00:21:33.987
a fight with her, huh?

00:21:36.224 --> 00:21:38.530
You're ignoring
an easy opponent

00:21:38.596 --> 00:21:41.569
and going after
the most difficult one there is.

00:21:41.936 --> 00:21:43.272
Look, don't worry.

00:21:43.338 --> 00:21:46.378
We can beat a rookie like him
whenever we feel like it.

00:21:46.779 --> 00:21:48.550
<i>[Rin] I'm just choosing</i>
<i>to ignore him as long</i>

00:21:48.616 --> 00:21:50.554
as he stays hidden in his house.

00:21:51.288 --> 00:21:52.591
Tell me.

00:21:52.658 --> 00:21:54.695
What if you come across
Shirou Emiya again,

00:21:54.762 --> 00:21:58.335
and he still possesses
no self awareness as a master?

00:22:00.574 --> 00:22:01.742
I'll kill him.

00:22:02.878 --> 00:22:04.615
[Rin] I'm not going
to show any mercy on him

00:22:04.682 --> 00:22:06.484
if he doesn't understand that.

00:22:07.053 --> 00:22:08.088
You got it?
