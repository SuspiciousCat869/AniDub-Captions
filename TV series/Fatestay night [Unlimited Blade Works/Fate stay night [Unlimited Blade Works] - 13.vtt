a difficult child.

00:17:20.379 --> 00:17:22.718
This should be
a simple decision.

00:17:22.785 --> 00:17:24.054
I know what you're thinking,

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:25.791
but no matter how skilled
your Saber is,

00:17:25.857 --> 00:17:29.464
she cannot defeat me with my
limitless reserves of mana.

00:17:29.532 --> 00:17:32.270
<i>My power is being supplied</i>
<i>to me by all</i>

00:17:32.337 --> 00:17:33.873
<i>the denizens of this city.</i>

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:37.648
<i>It's as if I have thousands</i>
<i>upon thousands of masters.</i>

00:17:37.715 --> 00:17:40.119
<i>Do you understand</i>
<i>what I'm saying?</i>

00:17:40.186 --> 00:17:41.956
No!
You wouldn't!

00:17:42.023 --> 00:17:43.158
I would.

00:17:43.492 --> 00:17:45.530
Humans may be devoid of mana,

00:17:45.597 --> 00:17:47.968
but they still have souls,
don't they?

00:17:48.503 --> 00:17:50.908
We are soul eaters by nature,
are we not?

00:17:50.974 --> 00:17:54.314
By taking mana in the form
of life from our masters,

00:17:54.381 --> 00:17:56.986
we may extract
as much as we like.

00:17:57.053 --> 00:17:58.823
[shuddering]

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:00.459
Are you listening to me, boy?

00:18:00.527 --> 00:18:02.363
You've no chance of winning.

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:05.637
This is my generous offer
to serve me next to Saber.

00:18:08.677 --> 00:18:10.246
You let Fujine go.

00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:14.421
Were you not listening
to what I just said?

00:18:14.889 --> 00:18:17.594
Surrender and she goes free.
You're mine.

00:18:17.661 --> 00:18:18.930
The hell I am!

00:18:18.997 --> 00:18:20.499
I said let her go!

00:18:20.567 --> 00:18:21.603
[gasps]

00:18:23.072 --> 00:18:26.679
[Caster] So you have no interest
in working with another master?

00:18:26.746 --> 00:18:29.451
[Shirou] I have no interest
in working with you!

00:18:29.518 --> 00:18:32.691
[Caster] It appears that I got
on your bad side somehow.

00:18:32.758 --> 00:18:34.729
That really is tragic.

00:18:35.296 --> 00:18:37.066
If you had decided
to work with me,

00:18:37.133 --> 00:18:38.369
I would have been more
than willing

00:18:38.435 --> 00:18:40.439
to share the Grail with you.

00:18:40.907 --> 00:18:42.911
You got the wrong idea about me!

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.316
I decided I would fight
in this war

00:18:45.383 --> 00:18:47.387
to stop people like you
from winning.

00:18:47.453 --> 00:18:49.457
[Shirou] The Grail has nothing
to do with this!

00:18:50.159 --> 00:18:52.665
[giggling]

00:18:52.731 --> 00:18:54.669
[cackling]

00:18:54.735 --> 00:18:56.238
What's so funny?

00:18:56.606 --> 00:18:59.110
Oh, my.
Must have touched a nerve.

00:18:59.444 --> 00:19:01.281
But you've only yourself
to blame,

00:19:01.348 --> 00:19:04.220
saying things you know
in your heart aren't true.

00:19:04.287 --> 00:19:05.423
[Caster] After all,

00:19:05.489 --> 00:19:07.493
you're a victim
of the Grail yourself.

00:19:07.561 --> 00:19:10.166
The Grail has nothing
to do with this?

00:19:10.232 --> 00:19:12.236
Even the act
of saying those words

00:19:12.303 --> 00:19:15.577
exposes how much hatred
you truly hold for it.

00:19:15.644 --> 00:19:17.080
Is that true?

00:19:17.447 --> 00:19:19.819
[Caster] You can't hide anything
from me.

00:19:19.885 --> 00:19:21.388
I know what's in your past,

00:19:21.455 --> 00:19:25.096
and I know that you
lost everything in the last war.

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:28.302
I know how you were found
by Kiritsugu alone

00:19:28.369 --> 00:19:30.707
and surrounded
by flames doing nothing more

00:19:30.774 --> 00:19:32.443
than waiting to die.

00:19:32.945 --> 00:19:34.381
How you must have suffered,

00:19:34.447 --> 00:19:37.086
adopted for the sole purpose
of the next war

00:19:37.153 --> 00:19:39.792
and having magic training forced
upon you.

00:19:40.259 --> 00:19:41.796
No way.

00:19:42.096 --> 00:19:44.502
Emiya, is any of that true?

00:19:44.869 --> 00:19:46.104
[Caster] Ah, yes.

00:19:46.171 --> 00:19:47.975
The Grail has always been
a focal point

00:19:48.042 --> 00:19:50.379
and a constant enemy to you.

00:19:50.446 --> 00:19:53.352
It is for that very reason
you have every right

00:19:53.419 --> 00:19:55.256
to claim the Grail
as compensation

00:19:55.322 --> 00:19:56.526
for what happened,

00:19:56.592 --> 00:19:58.462
and the Grail
is as good as mine,

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:00.199
as I'm sure you can imagine.

00:20:00.266 --> 00:20:02.370
It would be child's play
to grant your wish

00:20:02.437 --> 00:20:03.840
if you said the word.

00:20:04.207 --> 00:20:05.510
[Saber] Stop this nonsense!

00:20:05.577 --> 00:20:07.480
Everyone knows that the Grail
will not appear

00:20:07.548 --> 00:20:09.952
until one servant alone
stands victorious!

00:20:10.019 --> 00:20:11.421
Not true.

00:20:11.488 --> 00:20:13.593
I know of a way to claim
the Grail

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:15.564
without engaging
in any battles.

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:17.400
It's a useful gift I have.

00:20:17.467 --> 00:20:19.705
I sense the inner workings
of the Grail.

00:20:19.772 --> 00:20:20.941
‐ [gasps]
‐ [Caster] That's right.

00:20:21.007 --> 00:20:23.747
And if you
with your powerful mana output

00:20:23.813 --> 00:20:26.084
were to assist me
in this task...

00:20:26.819 --> 00:20:28.990
I believe I could create
the power to summon

00:20:29.057 --> 00:20:30.660
the Grail right now!

00:20:30.727 --> 00:20:31.963
[both gasping]

00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:35.937
[Caster] This is your last
chance, boy.

00:20:36.304 --> 00:20:38.877
You wish to avoid
senseless fighting, right?

00:20:38.943 --> 00:20:43.419
Then come and serve me,
Saber's master!

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:50.801
Not a chance.

00:20:51.168 --> 00:20:53.338
I will never submit to you!

00:20:53.405 --> 00:20:56.111
[gasps]
Have you gone insane?

00:20:56.178 --> 00:20:59.284
Do you have any understanding
of the position that you're in?

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:01.221
[Shirou] I won't help a witch
who views people

00:21:01.288 --> 00:21:02.658
as nothing more than food!

00:21:02.724 --> 00:21:05.229
Your methods are vile and wrong!

00:21:05.296 --> 00:21:06.999
And another thing.

00:21:07.066 --> 00:21:10.072
I didn't become a mage
'cause somebody else forced me!

00:21:10.139 --> 00:21:11.642
It was my choice to do this.

00:21:11.709 --> 00:21:13.680
To follow
the old man's footsteps.

00:21:15.049 --> 00:21:16.284
A witch?

00:21:16.853 --> 00:21:19.190
You just chose to call me
a witch.

00:21:19.257 --> 00:21:20.594
So...

00:21:20.994 --> 00:21:22.998
I have no use for you, then!

00:21:23.065 --> 00:21:25.102
You will now die here!

00:21:25.169 --> 00:21:27.006
‐ Why, you‐‐
‐ No, stop!

00:21:27.073 --> 00:21:28.510
‐ Don't move!
‐ [gasps]

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:29.912
I beg you.

00:21:30.881 --> 00:21:32.183
Just stay where you are.

00:21:32.651 --> 00:21:35.790
Shirou, but she‐‐
[gasps]

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:43.606
Oh, my.

00:21:43.673 --> 00:21:46.512
I did wonder if you
were completely irrational.

00:21:46.979 --> 00:21:49.384
[Caster] But you do understand
your situation,

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:50.821
don't you, boy?

00:21:51.454 --> 00:21:52.691
You're a coward!

00:21:52.758 --> 00:21:55.129
You can't just kill Shirou
in cold blood!

00:21:55.196 --> 00:21:56.899
Of course not.

00:21:56.966 --> 00:21:59.872
I'm merely stripping him
of his status as a master.

00:21:59.939 --> 00:22:01.241
‐ [gasps]
‐ [Caster] You reject

00:22:01.308 --> 00:22:02.778
my overtures to join me

00:22:02.845 --> 00:22:04.982
but you still wish
to save this girl.

00:22:05.049 --> 00:22:07.019
That tells me that you
are prepared

00:22:07.086 --> 00:22:09.023
to hand over your command seals.

00:22:11.896 --> 00:22:13.298
All right, then.

00:22:13.365 --> 00:22:14.835
And how do I do that?

00:22:15.336 --> 00:22:16.706
No!
You can't!

00:22:16.772 --> 00:22:18.108
Even if you do,
she'll‐‐

00:22:18.175 --> 00:22:19.410
Yes, that's right.

00:22:20.212 --> 00:22:22.083
I'll just take them arm and all.

00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:23.218
[gasps]

00:22:23.285 --> 00:22:25.122
That's enough of this.
Shirou!

00:22:25.189 --> 00:22:28.462
I won't allow you to continue
to play into Caster's hands!

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:30.332
There's no way
we're letting this happen!

00:22:30.399 --> 00:22:33.038
Besides, do you honestly believe
that she'd release a hostage

00:22:33.105 --> 00:22:34.374
that easily?

00:22:37.446 --> 00:22:38.883
Just take it.

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:40.452
It's what you want!

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.256
‐ No!
‐ Dammit, Shirou!

00:22:42.323 --> 00:22:44.862
You don't have to go to extremes
like that to help others!

00:22:44.929 --> 00:22:46.064
I do!

00:22:46.699 --> 00:22:48.937
If my arm
can help save Fujine...

00:22:49.404 --> 00:22:51.007
Then I don't even have
to think twice.

00:22:52.443 --> 00:22:53.780
[giggles]

00:22:53.846 --> 00:23:00.259
[laughing]

00:23:00.326 --> 00:23:02.430
You're a truly foolish child,

00:23:02.496 --> 00:23:04.434
and you're quite
a nuisance as well!

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:06.037
Now it's time to die!

00:23:07.406 --> 00:23:08.442
[blow lands]
[Saber grunts]

00:23:09.143 --> 00:23:10.145
[Saber grunts]

00:23:11.716 --> 00:23:14.120
‐ [Shirou] No, stop it!
‐ [Saber grunting]

00:23:14.187 --> 00:23:15.289
Saber!

00:23:15.356 --> 00:23:16.826
[grunts]

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:18.930
[both gasping]

00:23:19.364 --> 00:23:20.667
[exhales]

00:23:23.506 --> 00:23:27.046
[screaming]

00:23:27.346 --> 00:23:29.885
[screams]

00:23:29.952 --> 00:23:31.288
Saber!

00:23:31.354 --> 00:23:34.895
[shouting]

00:23:35.262 --> 00:23:36.933
[Saber groans]

00:23:42.511 --> 00:23:47.253
[Caster laughing]

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.257
I hope you were enchanted.

00:23:49.324 --> 00:23:51.161
This is my Noble Phantasm.

00:23:51.227 --> 00:23:52.597
It's the Rule Breaker.

00:23:52.664 --> 00:23:55.002
Magic is totally useless
against it.

00:23:55.069 --> 00:23:57.406
It'll nullify all magic
in the world!

00:23:57.473 --> 00:23:59.745
A dagger of betrayal and denial!

00:23:59.812 --> 00:24:04.521
The pact has been forged.
Now I am your master,

00:24:04.588 --> 00:24:06.892
and you will find yourself now
as I am.

00:24:06.959 --> 00:24:08.630
Time for you
to betray your master

00:24:08.696 --> 00:24:10.499
and pledge your sword to me.

00:24:10.567 --> 00:24:12.537
[Saber groaning]

00:24:12.604 --> 00:24:14.007
[Rin] No way.

00:24:14.073 --> 00:24:16.779
You can take a servant
even though you're one yourself?

00:24:16.846 --> 00:24:17.714
Yes.

00:24:17.781 --> 00:24:19.652
I've made her my familiar,

00:24:19.718 --> 00:24:22.323
and Saber now belongs to me!

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:24.360
[sizzling]
All right.

00:24:24.427 --> 00:24:25.997
Let me give you
your friend back,

00:24:26.064 --> 00:24:26.999
little fool.

00:24:27.066 --> 00:24:28.201
Fujine!

00:24:28.268 --> 00:24:29.370
[grunts]

00:24:29.437 --> 00:24:30.774
Can you hear me?

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:32.644
Are you okay?
Answer me!

00:24:32.711 --> 00:24:34.213
‐ [groans]
‐ [gasps]

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.583
Oh, thank God.

00:24:36.184 --> 00:24:37.386
You know what?

00:24:37.821 --> 00:24:40.059
I think I might actually
let you go.

00:24:40.492 --> 00:24:42.196
That show of yours
was wonderful.

00:24:42.263 --> 00:24:45.102
A little annoying
and over the top for my taste.

00:24:45.169 --> 00:24:46.639
However...

00:24:47.306 --> 00:24:51.214
So, I suppose this is how things
usually work, then.

00:24:51.281 --> 00:24:53.018
‐ That right?
‐ Yes.

00:24:53.085 --> 00:24:56.157
Sorry to inform you
that playtime is over.

00:24:56.224 --> 00:24:57.694
It's your turn, Saber.

00:24:57.761 --> 00:25:00.165
Go strike down Archer's master!

00:25:00.232 --> 00:25:02.036
[Saber gasps]
Never!

00:25:02.103 --> 00:25:04.273
I'll never obey
the likes of you!

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:06.378
[whooshing]
[groans]

00:25:06.444 --> 00:25:08.983
Ah, but I believe that you will,
Saber.

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:11.822
I control these command seals
and you can't defy me

00:25:11.889 --> 00:25:13.760
in either body or soul.

00:25:15.964 --> 00:25:16.932
[gasps]

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:30.527
Shirou!
Idiot!

00:25:30.593 --> 00:25:32.229
[Caster] A tragic pity.

00:25:32.296 --> 00:25:33.733
Such a waste, really.

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.572
I actually found that little boy
to be quite fascinating.

00:25:37.574 --> 00:25:39.978
Now obey my command seal,
Saber.

00:25:48.495 --> 00:25:51.569

[gasps]

00:25:58.181 --> 00:26:00.587
Saber's anti‐magic
is still effective against

00:26:00.653 --> 00:26:02.557
the binding of a command seal?

00:26:03.024 --> 00:26:05.563
But nevertheless
you still won't escape!

00:26:06.297 --> 00:26:07.667

00:26:30.446 --> 00:26:31.615
Apologies.

00:26:31.916 --> 00:26:34.020
Breaking the bounded field
took time.

00:26:34.454 --> 00:26:36.859
However, now that I'm inside...

00:26:37.694 --> 00:26:39.230
[electric sparking]

00:26:39.297 --> 00:26:41.635
Archer, get Ms. Fujimura
outta here!

00:26:42.203 --> 00:26:45.109
Now, we won't have
this chance for long!

00:26:45.175 --> 00:26:46.244
[gasps]

00:26:50.653 --> 00:26:52.123
‐ Saber...

[scoffs]

00:27:14.968 --> 00:27:16.672
[Rin] This was all for the best.

00:27:17.039 --> 00:27:18.341
I'm grateful you're alive.

00:27:21.247 --> 00:27:24.220
You just get some rest for now,
okay?

00:27:32.036 --> 00:27:34.473
<i>[Archer] So, while I was</i>
<i>breaking through the field,</i>

00:27:34.541 --> 00:27:36.044
<i>Saber was taken.</i>

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:37.714
<i>[Rin] That's all you have</i>
<i>to say?</i>

00:27:37.781 --> 00:27:38.983
<i>[Archer] Yes.</i>

00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:40.787
<i>Don't discount the fact</i>
<i>that we now know</i>

00:27:40.854 --> 00:27:43.158
what Caster's Noble Phantasm is.

00:27:43.225 --> 00:27:44.561
<i>In any case,</i>

00:27:44.628 --> 00:27:47.834
<i>Caster is as sloppy on</i>
<i>the follow through as always.</i>

00:27:47.901 --> 00:27:49.705
<i>Deep down there</i>
<i>might actually be</i>

00:27:49.771 --> 00:27:51.407
<i>a decent woman in there.</i>

00:27:51.474 --> 00:27:54.213
<i>[Rin] I don't understand why</i>
<i>you don't seem very concerned</i>

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:55.517
<i>about Saber.</i>

00:27:55.583 --> 00:27:58.054
<i>I kind of thought you</i>
<i>were rooting for her.</i>

00:27:58.321 --> 00:27:59.390
<i>[Archer] Oh, really?</i>

00:27:59.457 --> 00:28:01.529
<i>I don't recall ever giving</i>
<i>that impression.</i>

00:28:01.595 --> 00:28:04.233
<i>And what exactly would make</i>
<i>you think that, Rin?</i>

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:06.772
Would you believe I picked
it up through a bit

00:28:06.839 --> 00:28:08.141
of women's intuition?

00:28:08.509 --> 00:28:10.580
<i>[Archer] Not at all.</i>
<i>First of all,</i>

00:28:10.647 --> 00:28:13.184
<i>are you even old enough</i>
<i>to qualify as a woman?</i>

00:28:13.653 --> 00:28:17.359
<i>You are lacking</i>
<i>in certain voluptuous charms,</i>

00:28:17.426 --> 00:28:19.598
<i>and refinement as well.</i>

00:28:19.665 --> 00:28:20.833
<i>Additionally‐‐</i>

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:23.071
and this is your most
fatal drawback‐‐

00:28:23.138 --> 00:28:25.910
your appeal is difficult
to find.

00:28:27.581 --> 00:28:28.583
[Rin giggles]

00:28:28.649 --> 00:28:29.985
Well, well.

00:28:30.052 --> 00:28:32.389
I'm glad to see you found
your groove again.

00:28:34.861 --> 00:28:36.231
Welcome back.

00:28:37.499 --> 00:28:38.603
[chuckles]

00:28:39.003 --> 00:28:40.540
[Rin] I think we need
to get back

00:28:40.607 --> 00:28:41.809
to the topic at hand.

00:28:42.209 --> 00:28:43.913
Here's the first piece
of evidence showing

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:45.984
that you were actually rooting
for Saber.

00:28:46.819 --> 00:28:48.556
When you initially met Saber,

00:28:48.623 --> 00:28:50.325
you went quite easy on her.

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:53.231
<i>No matter how powerful she is,</i>

00:28:53.298 --> 00:28:55.603
<i>I just don't believe she could</i>
<i>have gotten the better of you.</i>

00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:57.373
Not with your defenses.

00:28:57.439 --> 00:28:59.945
Let's just say
she caught me unawares.

00:29:00.012 --> 00:29:01.347
I'm just like you.

00:29:01.414 --> 00:29:04.420
I'm not good
at unexpected situations.

00:29:04.487 --> 00:29:06.257
We're not talking about me.

00:29:06.324 --> 00:29:08.696
And now for the second piece
of evidence.

00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:10.733
After the incident with Rider,

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.371
you clearly tried
to provoke Saber.

00:29:13.438 --> 00:29:15.710
<i>That was completely out</i>
<i>of character for you.</i>

00:29:15.777 --> 00:29:17.379
<i>There's no two ways about it,</i>

00:29:17.446 --> 00:29:19.651
<i>but when I looked at it</i>
<i>from another angle,</i>

00:29:19.718 --> 00:29:20.787
it made sense.

00:29:20.853 --> 00:29:22.289
The truth is,

00:29:22.356 --> 00:29:24.493
you were actually
scolding Saber, right?

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:27.266
Oh, I am right!

00:29:27.333 --> 00:29:28.936
I knew I was!

00:29:29.337 --> 00:29:31.842
I don't know if you two knew
each other in a previous life,

00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:33.445
but it's highly unusual for you

00:29:33.512 --> 00:29:36.284
to be so unnecessarily cold
to someone.

00:29:36.351 --> 00:29:37.453
You think so?

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.925
I'm quite sure I respond
to everyone that way,

00:29:39.992 --> 00:29:41.996
regardless of who they happen
to be.

00:29:42.062 --> 00:29:45.002
Nobody but you yourself
thinks that way, you know.

00:29:45.068 --> 00:29:46.772
So this is how I see it.

00:29:46.839 --> 00:29:48.375
[Rin] You're good at almost
everything

00:29:48.441 --> 00:29:51.114
but you're so awkward when
it comes to yourself.

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:53.051
You're quite smooth
when dealing with others which

00:29:53.118 --> 00:29:54.655
is why nobody else notices.

00:29:54.721 --> 00:29:55.823
[groans]

00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:58.361
Well?
Have you remembered yet?

00:29:58.428 --> 00:30:01.234
Do you know which land's
heroic spirit you are?

00:30:01.902 --> 00:30:03.839
If you have a connection
to Saber,

00:30:03.906 --> 00:30:06.679
then you must come
from an era near hers.

00:30:07.146 --> 00:30:09.718
Sorry,
everything is still quite hazy.

00:30:10.252 --> 00:30:12.156
But now that you mention it,

00:30:12.222 --> 00:30:14.795
I do have memories
of this Saber,

00:30:14.861 --> 00:30:16.699
but she does not seem
to remember me,

00:30:16.765 --> 00:30:19.370
so I do not think that we could
have been very close.

00:30:20.339 --> 00:30:21.709
Oh.

00:30:22.276 --> 00:30:23.879
[Archer] More to the point, Rin,

00:30:23.946 --> 00:30:25.817
how is your visitor
that you brought here?

00:30:26.184 --> 00:30:27.887
<i>[Rin] Hmm.</i>
<i>Well,</i>

00:30:27.954 --> 00:30:29.825
<i>luckily she missed</i>
<i>anything vital,</i>

00:30:29.891 --> 00:30:32.062
<i>but it doesn't seem like</i>
<i>his wounds</i>

00:30:32.129 --> 00:30:33.666
<i>are healing at all this time.</i>

00:30:34.066 --> 00:30:35.302
<i>Since their pact is broken,</i>

00:30:35.369 --> 00:30:36.905
<i>he might have lost</i>
<i>the healing ability</i>

00:30:36.972 --> 00:30:38.542
<i>he'd been getting from Saber.</i>

00:30:39.377 --> 00:30:41.682
<i>[Archer] No, I wasn't talking</i>
<i>about him.</i>

00:30:41.749 --> 00:30:43.118
<i>I meant the other one.</i>

00:30:43.686 --> 00:30:46.725
<i>[Rin] Oh, uh,</i>
<i>you mean Ms. Fujimura?</i>

00:30:47.393 --> 00:30:49.564
I'm betting that Caster put
her under some type

00:30:49.631 --> 00:30:53.371
of sleeping spell,
but she's doing very well now.

00:30:53.438 --> 00:30:55.977
<i>[Rin] I've treated her so she</i>
<i>can sleep a whole week</i>

00:30:56.044 --> 00:30:57.847
<i>without having</i>
<i>any major problems.</i>

00:30:57.914 --> 00:30:59.116
[exhales]

00:30:59.183 --> 00:31:00.586
But knowing Ms. Fujimura,

00:31:00.653 --> 00:31:02.724
she could jump out
of bed any second now.

00:31:02.791 --> 00:31:03.759
Perhaps,

00:31:03.826 --> 00:31:04.995
but what that woman casts

00:31:05.062 --> 00:31:07.099
are fare more curse than spell.

00:31:07.466 --> 00:31:09.470
The most efficient way
to break that curse

00:31:09.538 --> 00:31:10.940
is to defeat Cater.

00:31:11.374 --> 00:31:12.309
I agree.

00:31:22.129 --> 00:31:24.500
Killing Caster
is our top priority.

00:31:25.035 --> 00:31:26.204
Yes, I know.

00:31:26.605 --> 00:31:28.809
If we can I want
to do it before Saber falls

00:31:28.876 --> 00:31:30.613
completely under her control.

00:31:32.249 --> 00:31:33.552
[Archer] Understood.

00:31:33.619 --> 00:31:34.755
So then,

00:31:34.821 --> 00:31:37.493
I assume that your pact
with the boy is over now.

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:38.696
What?

00:31:38.763 --> 00:31:40.566
Don't give me that "what."

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:43.438
Shirou Emiya is no longer
a master now, right?

00:31:44.608 --> 00:31:45.710
[Archer] What's this?

00:31:46.244 --> 00:31:47.914
Surely you don't mean
to spend time

00:31:47.981 --> 00:31:51.220
and energy looking after him
as some sort of fallen brother.

00:31:52.791 --> 00:31:54.026
[Rin] Hardly.

00:31:54.093 --> 00:31:55.930
I'm not that big of a softie.

00:31:56.598 --> 00:31:57.834
[Archer] What, then?

00:31:57.901 --> 00:32:00.205
It's just not over yet.

00:32:00.573 --> 00:32:02.911
<i>[Rin] My promise still stands</i>
<i>until he tells me</i>

00:32:02.977 --> 00:32:04.514
<i>that he wants out of this war.</i>

00:32:05.716 --> 00:32:07.252
<i>I will reject him.</i>

00:32:07.319 --> 00:32:09.791
<i>However, nothing is over until</i>
<i>he explicitly says</i>

00:32:09.858 --> 00:32:11.595
<i>to my face that he wants out.</i>

00:32:13.899 --> 00:32:15.135
Rin.

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:17.807
That is my decision, Archer.

00:32:18.341 --> 00:32:20.378
[Rin] I trust you have
no problems with it?

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:22.784
There's nothing I can do.

00:32:22.851 --> 00:32:25.422
I know painfully well what sort
of person you are.

00:32:25.489 --> 00:32:27.527
We need not discuss it further.

00:32:27.594 --> 00:32:28.896
[giggles]

00:32:28.963 --> 00:32:30.967
All right, then.

[Rin] Oh, no.

00:33:38.268 --> 00:33:40.038
Why are you here?

00:33:40.606 --> 00:33:42.810
Why did you have
to pick this hour

This debt...

This is one I'll never be able
to repay!

[Caster] Are you even listening
to me, Assassin?

00:34:32.543 --> 00:34:34.480
I said I wanted you
to continue guarding

00:34:34.547 --> 00:34:36.450
the front gate.
Do you understand?

00:34:36.518 --> 00:34:39.056
[Assassin] There was something.
An intruder, you see.

00:34:39.423 --> 00:34:42.396
I spotted an unusual bird
so I struck it down.

00:34:42.462 --> 00:34:45.101
Is this something used
by your kind?

00:34:45.168 --> 00:34:48.207
[Caster] Yes,
it's a familiar used for spying.

00:34:48.642 --> 00:34:49.744
[glass shattering]

00:34:49.811 --> 00:34:51.080
Huh.

00:34:51.147 --> 00:34:53.451
That young lady really
has terrible luck.

00:34:53.519 --> 00:34:55.422
If she were slightly
less talented

00:34:55.488 --> 00:34:58.595
I may have considered taking
her on as a pupil.

00:34:59.296 --> 00:35:01.835
I leave my master's defense
to you, Assassin.

00:35:01.902 --> 00:35:04.206
I trust you will guard
the gate with your life.

00:35:04.273 --> 00:35:06.645
You know,
since I was summoned,

00:35:06.712 --> 00:35:09.350
I have never truly felt
that I was fully alive

00:35:09.416 --> 00:35:11.087
deep inside myself.

00:35:11.555 --> 00:35:13.291
Ordering such a person
to do anything

00:35:13.358 --> 00:35:15.428
to death is rather useless,
is it not?

00:35:15.495 --> 00:35:17.466
I'm not going
to quibble with you.

00:35:17.533 --> 00:35:20.472
Remember that you are a servant
that I summoned.

00:35:20.539 --> 00:35:23.444
If you will not or cannot
pledge fealty to your lord,

00:35:23.512 --> 00:35:25.516
I shall eliminate you right now.

00:35:25.583 --> 00:35:28.488
Oh, I see.
Someone is touchy.

00:35:29.658 --> 00:35:32.029
[Assassin] My life
is as ephemeral as vapor,

00:35:32.095 --> 00:35:34.366
but I don't want it extinguished
just yet.

00:35:35.068 --> 00:35:36.437
After all,

00:35:36.505 --> 00:35:39.276
I am still committed
to upholding the promise I made.

00:35:39.343 --> 00:35:41.848
Then remember that
and hold your tongue.

00:35:41.915 --> 00:35:45.322
Your concern is in guarding
this place and nothing else.

00:35:46.057 --> 00:35:47.994
And guard it I shall.

00:35:48.562 --> 00:35:50.833
[Assassin] But do you think
this wise, Caster?

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:53.338
<i>I am also disloyal</i>
<i>to my lord,</i>

00:35:53.404 --> 00:35:55.375
<i>but you are acting</i>
<i>on your own authority</i>

00:35:55.442 --> 00:35:56.511
<i>far too much.</i>

00:35:56.578 --> 00:35:58.214
<i>Is your errand tonight also</i>

00:35:58.281 --> 00:35:59.751
without your master's knowledge?

[squelching]

00:36:03.257 --> 00:36:05.095
[groans]

00:36:05.161 --> 00:36:08.034
Day by day you overstep
your bounds ever

00:36:08.101 --> 00:36:10.372
and ever farther.
You go too far.

00:36:10.438 --> 00:36:12.075
That's enough of that.

00:36:12.142 --> 00:36:14.413
The next time you make me
repeat myself,

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:16.217
I'll destroy you
without waiting out

00:36:16.283 --> 00:36:17.754
the next five days.

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:19.490
Oh, dear.

00:36:19.557 --> 00:36:21.728
The saying that women
and children are difficult

00:36:21.795 --> 00:36:25.335
to manage turns out to be true,
I see.

00:36:28.207 --> 00:36:29.844
You need not worry.

00:36:29.911 --> 00:36:31.581
I understand.

00:36:31.648 --> 00:36:35.255
All is to be carried out without
your master's knowledge, right?

00:36:35.689 --> 00:36:37.960
Yours is truly
the touching tale.

00:36:38.461 --> 00:36:41.535
I can only hope that your love
for your lord can somehow

00:36:41.601 --> 00:36:43.471
find its way through
to that man.

00:36:43.539 --> 00:36:45.475
Assassin, you mind your words.

00:36:45.543 --> 00:36:47.345
[Assassin] I am a sore loser.

00:36:47.412 --> 00:36:50.085
Allow me these poor excuses
for jests.

00:36:50.418 --> 00:36:51.888
On my blade,

00:36:51.955 --> 00:36:54.761
I swear that I shall protect
this gate from all things,

00:36:54.828 --> 00:36:55.730
but tell me,

00:36:55.796 --> 00:36:58.034
where will you be
while I'm here?

00:36:58.468 --> 00:37:00.539
Is it that you do not trust
my protection?

00:37:00.606 --> 00:37:02.008
[Caster] Of course not.

00:37:02.075 --> 00:37:04.681
You are nothing more
than my insurance plan,

00:37:04.748 --> 00:37:06.918
but I no longer require that.

00:37:06.985 --> 00:37:08.221
<i>Now that Saber's mine</i>

00:37:08.287 --> 00:37:11.762
it's no longer necessary for me
to use this place as my temple.

00:37:11.828 --> 00:37:14.667
<i>[Assassin] Hmm.</i>
<i>A change of location?</i>

00:37:14.734 --> 00:37:18.040
Which means that you
will have no further use for me.

00:37:18.842 --> 00:37:21.280
There's a sacred spot superior
to this mountain?

00:37:21.347 --> 00:37:22.617
[Caster] Yes.

00:37:22.683 --> 00:37:25.422
Actually, there's a place
that suits me perfectly.

00:37:26.858 --> 00:37:30.365
Now I'm off to claim
my prize earlier than planned.

00:37:30.432 --> 00:37:32.937
I have a new fortification
plus the Grail,

00:37:33.004 --> 00:37:35.943
and also the addition of Saber
as my pawn.

00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:38.682
Even my usually‐reserved master
won't be able

00:37:38.749 --> 00:37:40.920
to find a way to object
to my plans.

00:37:42.155 --> 00:37:43.525
And once I have the Grail,

00:37:43.592 --> 00:37:45.763
I will have no reason
to fear anything.

00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:46.865
Yes.

00:37:46.932 --> 00:37:49.136
No one will be able
to stand against me,

00:37:49.203 --> 00:37:51.407
no matter how powerful they are!

00:37:51.474 --> 00:37:55.649
<i>[laughing]</i>

00:38:05.769 --> 00:38:07.540

00:38:09.176 --> 00:38:10.846
Hello, Caster.

00:38:10.913 --> 00:38:12.884
[Caster] I guess I should say,
"How do you do,

00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:16.157
my good overseer
of this fully mad ritual?"

00:38:16.223 --> 00:38:18.327
What is it you want, Caster?

00:38:18.394 --> 00:38:21.167
You know that this place
is neutral territory.

00:38:21.233 --> 00:38:23.639
Regardless of which
heroic spirit they may be,

00:38:23.705 --> 00:38:26.277
no servant may be allowed entry
into this space.

00:38:26.343 --> 00:38:28.582
It seems the rules have changed.

00:38:29.584 --> 00:38:31.788
Mm?
What?

00:38:32.155 --> 00:38:33.391
[Kirei] Command seals?

00:38:38.401 --> 00:38:40.071
[gasping]

00:38:40.138 --> 00:38:41.708
[Kirei] Saber!

00:38:41.775 --> 00:38:45.215
You see,
Saber is now my sweet puppet,

00:38:45.281 --> 00:38:47.687
and I hope you know
what that means.

00:38:47.753 --> 00:38:49.189
[Caster] The outcome
of this war

00:38:49.256 --> 00:38:50.693
is as good as decided.

00:38:50.759 --> 00:38:52.530
Is there any reason why
I wouldn't be able

00:38:52.597 --> 00:38:55.001
to simply claim my prize now?

00:38:55.068 --> 00:38:56.505
Indeed there is.

00:38:56.571 --> 00:38:58.140
The Grail will not appear until

00:38:58.207 --> 00:39:00.478
a single servant
stands victorious.

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:03.384
I find it hard to believe you
were not made aware of this

00:39:03.451 --> 00:39:05.890
when you were summoned
into existence.

00:39:05.956 --> 00:39:07.793
[Caster] Oh,
the Grail did say that.

00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:10.031
It ordered me to slay
the other heroic spirits

00:39:10.098 --> 00:39:12.435
if I wanted to activate
the Grail myself.

00:39:13.037 --> 00:39:16.010
But that refers only
to the greater Grail,

00:39:16.076 --> 00:39:17.012
does it not?

00:39:17.078 --> 00:39:18.247
[gasps]

00:39:18.314 --> 00:39:21.220
So, tell me where
the lesser Grail is.

00:39:21.287 --> 00:39:24.226
You priests are the ones
who keep the key to the Grail.

00:39:24.293 --> 00:39:25.629
[Caster] Isn't that right?

00:39:27.567 --> 00:39:29.637
[Kirei] There
is no Holy Grail here.

00:39:29.704 --> 00:39:32.309
Do you wish to die now, Priest?

00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:35.215
[scoffs]
You shouldn't try so hard.

00:39:35.683 --> 00:39:37.319
[Kirei] You can't hide
your true self,

00:39:37.385 --> 00:39:38.689
Princess of Colchis.

00:39:38.755 --> 00:39:42.697

for raw brutality.

to prove,

but you're only getting
in my way.

I won't go.

00:42:10.224 --> 00:42:12.696
I promised I'd fight
by your side, remember?

00:42:14.166 --> 00:42:16.470
[Rin] Forget about
that stupid promise.

00:42:17.238 --> 00:42:18.775
Anyway,
what could you possibly do

00:42:18.842 --> 00:42:20.344
in the shape you're in now?

00:42:20.779 --> 00:42:22.248
You've lost Saber.

00:42:23.084 --> 00:42:24.052
I know.

00:42:24.921 --> 00:42:26.156
Besides,

00:42:26.223 --> 00:42:28.562
there isn't any need
for you to continue fighting.

00:42:29.129 --> 00:42:31.266
You're simply not
a master anymore.

00:42:31.333 --> 00:42:33.471
Why don't you go take shelter
in the church?

I can leave Saber like that!

from here on out,

00:42:40.786 --> 00:42:42.923

Your injuries
had been healed thanks

00:42:47.499 --> 00:42:49.136
to Saber,
but without her,

00:42:49.202 --> 00:42:50.271

for all of your talk
about Saber,

00:42:57.085 --> 00:42:58.955
what happens to her

So what if I'm not a master?

00:43:03.297 --> 00:43:06.504
Saber,
she‐‐she hated what happened.

00:43:06.571 --> 00:43:08.340
[Shirou] No way
am I gonna let her

00:43:08.407 --> 00:43:09.977
be somebody's fool like that.

I see.

00:43:12.348 --> 00:43:14.587
[Rin] The problem
is that you're powerless.

00:43:15.221 --> 00:43:16.490
You got that?

00:43:16.891 --> 00:43:19.196
If you still refuse
to accept the facts here,

00:43:19.262 --> 00:43:21.901
then I guess I have
to spell it out for you.

As you are right now,

You've lost Saber
and you're no longer a master.

There's no reason for you
to be involved

Do you understand?

00:43:41.406 --> 00:43:42.877
