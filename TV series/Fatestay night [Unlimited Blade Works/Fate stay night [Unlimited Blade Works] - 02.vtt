00:19:51.749 --> 00:19:52.818
it was hilarious.
[both laughing]

00:19:52.885 --> 00:19:55.724
He got so scared,
he about peed his pants!

00:19:55.791 --> 00:19:56.726
[all laughing]

00:20:05.376 --> 00:20:06.713
When Shinji gets mad,

00:20:06.779 --> 00:20:08.750
he just doesn't know when
to stop.

00:20:08.817 --> 00:20:10.286
‐ [Kaede] Hey, you there!
‐ Hmm?

00:20:10.352 --> 00:20:12.390
‐ [Kaede shouts]
‐ Oh!

00:20:12.791 --> 00:20:13.727
[Shirou grunts]

00:20:14.762 --> 00:20:16.164
Shinji Matou!

00:20:16.231 --> 00:20:17.634
I hate to break it to you,

00:20:17.701 --> 00:20:20.406
but Rin Tohsaka isn't going
to show up,

00:20:20.473 --> 00:20:23.378
no matter how long you wait!
[scoffs]

00:20:24.147 --> 00:20:25.416
[scoffs]

00:20:25.617 --> 00:20:26.652
Huh?

00:20:27.053 --> 00:20:28.288
[Kane] Maki,

00:20:28.355 --> 00:20:29.324
this guy doesn't match

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:31.394
the description Mitsuzuri
gave us.

00:20:31.729 --> 00:20:33.298
He doesn't have seaweed hair,
either.

00:20:33.365 --> 00:20:34.434
[Kaede] The way I see it,

00:20:34.502 --> 00:20:36.639
he just wet down
his naturally curly hair

00:20:36.706 --> 00:20:37.508
to straighten it,

00:20:37.574 --> 00:20:39.043
and a face this stupid‐looking

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:40.847
can only belong
to Shinji Matou!

00:20:40.914 --> 00:20:41.883
You've got it all wrong.

00:20:41.949 --> 00:20:43.185
I'm not Shinji, okay?

00:20:43.252 --> 00:20:44.454
See what I mean?

00:20:44.522 --> 00:20:46.391
That's what
the bad guys always say.

00:20:46.458 --> 00:20:47.694
Wait a second.

00:20:47.761 --> 00:20:48.897
[gasps]

00:20:49.464 --> 00:20:51.468
I'm sorry
but would you mind showing

00:20:51.536 --> 00:20:53.105
your student ID to us?

00:20:53.172 --> 00:20:54.675
Sure.
Here.

00:20:57.581 --> 00:20:58.917
Hmm.

00:20:59.384 --> 00:21:01.087
‐ [Kaede gasps]
‐ Like he said,

00:21:01.154 --> 00:21:02.691
we've got
the wrong guy cornered.

00:21:02.758 --> 00:21:04.762
[Kaede] Emiya?
That Emiya?

00:21:04.829 --> 00:21:07.066
The guy who fixes all our gear
whenever he has

00:21:07.133 --> 00:21:08.970
a moment to spare?
That one?

00:21:09.037 --> 00:21:11.241
The one they call
the Homurahara Brownie?

00:21:11.308 --> 00:21:13.078
You know,
I've never heard that nickname,

00:21:13.145 --> 00:21:15.851
but I do know the president
of the track club.

00:21:15.917 --> 00:21:17.855
[shouts]
I'm sorry!

00:21:18.355 --> 00:21:19.625
[Yukika] We're all sorry.

00:21:19.692 --> 00:21:21.361
It seemed like you were looking
for someone,

00:21:21.428 --> 00:21:23.198
so we just assumed
you were Matou.

00:21:23.265 --> 00:21:24.702
It's okay.

00:21:24.768 --> 00:21:27.340
What was that you said
about Tohsaka not coming here?

00:21:27.406 --> 00:21:28.877
Did something happen to her?

00:21:28.943 --> 00:21:32.416
She stayed home and said
she wasn't coming in today.

00:21:32.483 --> 00:21:34.387
Yeah, Tohsaka's sick, dude.

00:21:34.454 --> 00:21:35.590
She says she's got a cold,

00:21:35.657 --> 00:21:37.093
so she's gonna hang out
in bed today.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.732
Can you believe a model student
like her is capable

00:21:39.798 --> 00:21:42.336
of catching a common cold?
[groans]

00:21:42.403 --> 00:21:43.973
‐ We're very sorry, Emiya.
‐ [groaning]

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:46.579
Especially
for our exotic beast here,

00:21:46.646 --> 00:21:48.983
but you shouldn't be here,
either.

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:51.421
Weren't you told that students
with no club meetings

00:21:51.488 --> 00:21:52.524
were to go straight home?

00:21:52.591 --> 00:21:54.060
[Shirou] No, I wasn't.
Why?

00:21:54.127 --> 00:21:55.997
Uh, so you don't know?

00:21:56.364 --> 00:21:57.634
[Kane] There was
a terrible murder

00:21:57.701 --> 00:22:00.907
at an intersection
very near our school.

00:22:00.974 --> 00:22:02.443
<i>Of a family of four,</i>

00:22:02.511 --> 00:22:04.380
<i>the only survivor</i>
<i>was a little kid.</i>

00:22:04.447 --> 00:22:07.286
<i>The parents and older daughter</i>
<i>were stabbed to death.</i>

00:22:07.754 --> 00:22:09.658
<i>The killer is still at large,</i>

00:22:09.725 --> 00:22:12.129
<i>and everybody's freaking about</i>
<i>about how it seems like</i>

00:22:12.196 --> 00:22:13.498
<i>a random killing.</i>

00:22:14.735 --> 00:22:17.039
<i>In New City,</i>
<i>they have those gas leaks.</i>

00:22:17.473 --> 00:22:19.444
<i>Over here,</i>
<i>we've got a grizzly murder.</i>

00:22:20.212 --> 00:22:21.414
<i>With all that happening,</i>

00:22:21.481 --> 00:22:22.584
<i>it's no wonder they're sending</i>

00:22:22.651 --> 00:22:24.087
<i>students home early.</i>

00:22:24.153 --> 00:22:27.059

00:22:39.852 --> 00:22:42.691
[engine rumbling]

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:45.564
I don't need reminding.

<i>[dramatic piano music]</i>

00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:59.090
[Kiritsugu] Yes, I see.

00:22:59.157 --> 00:23:00.426
Thank you.

00:23:11.348 --> 00:23:12.483
Hello.

00:23:12.751 --> 00:23:14.087
You must be Shirou.

00:23:15.189 --> 00:23:16.491
I suppose I'll come right out

00:23:16.559 --> 00:23:18.228
and ask you
what you would prefer:

00:23:18.295 --> 00:23:22.169
being sent off to an orphanage
or being taken in by

00:23:22.236 --> 00:23:23.640
a man that you just met.

00:23:44.447 --> 00:23:45.717
[Kiritsugu] I'm glad.

00:23:45.784 --> 00:23:48.188
Then let's get you dressed
right away.

00:23:48.623 --> 00:23:50.560
You need to get acclimated
to your new home

00:23:50.627 --> 00:23:52.163
as soon as possible.

00:23:52.229 --> 00:23:53.298
Oh.
[chuckles]

00:23:53.365 --> 00:23:55.804
I forgot to mention
something you should know.

00:23:56.071 --> 00:23:58.442
I have to tell you
an extremely important fact.

00:23:58.509 --> 00:23:59.745
Ready?

00:24:00.981 --> 00:24:02.149
Yeah.

00:24:02.416 --> 00:24:04.120
I should do this right now.

You see, Shirou...

00:24:06.993 --> 00:24:08.128
I am a mage.

[bus engine revving]

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:16.946

<i>[Shirou] It's all very murky,</i>

00:24:49.545 --> 00:24:52.249
<i>but the only thing I remember</i>
<i>of that day ten years ago</i>

00:24:52.316 --> 00:24:55.055
<i>is that it was hot</i>
<i>and that I couldn't breathe,</i>

00:24:55.122 --> 00:24:57.527
<i>and that I was trying</i>
<i>to save someone,</i>

00:24:57.594 --> 00:25:00.700
but that someone ended up dying
<i>after all.</i>

00:25:01.301 --> 00:25:02.637
<i>I hate that.</i>

00:25:02.704 --> 00:25:04.207
<i>It makes me mad when people</i>

00:25:04.273 --> 00:25:06.779
<i>who try so hard die anyway.</i>

00:25:07.413 --> 00:25:10.386
<i>Is it greedy of me to wish</i>
<i>for an outcome where everyone</i>

00:25:10.452 --> 00:25:13.125
<i>is saved and shares</i>
<i>their happiness with others?</i>

00:25:14.962 --> 00:25:16.899
[Kiritsugu]
It's not that simple,

00:25:16.966 --> 00:25:19.170
because what
you're describing...

00:25:19.738 --> 00:25:22.376
Is trying to save everyone
in the world, Shirou.

00:25:22.443 --> 00:25:24.180
<i>[Shirou] The kid me listened,</i>

00:25:24.247 --> 00:25:27.019
<i>but wasn't convinced at all</i>
<i>by Kiritsugu's answer.</i>

00:25:27.587 --> 00:25:28.623
<i>I mean...</i>

00:25:28.956 --> 00:25:30.927
<i>He saved my life, right?</i>

00:25:31.394 --> 00:25:34.535
<i>I knew he was a mage who</i>
<i>could do just about anything.</i>

00:25:35.302 --> 00:25:37.641
<i>So I asked Kiritsugu</i>

00:25:37.708 --> 00:25:39.912
if he could have saved everyone
<i>back then.</i>

00:25:40.513 --> 00:25:43.085
<i>And if he could,</i>
<i>why didn't he?</i>

00:25:43.318 --> 00:25:44.588

<i>But his answer confused me.</i>

00:25:48.495 --> 00:25:49.832
Shirou,

00:25:49.898 --> 00:25:52.604
choosing to save someone
means choosing not

00:25:52.671 --> 00:25:53.906
to save another.

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:55.510
You see,

00:25:55.577 --> 00:25:57.714
no matter what
your intention is...

00:25:58.281 --> 00:26:01.054
You can only save those
who belong to your side.

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:04.293
I know it should be obvious...

00:26:04.862 --> 00:26:07.266
But that's the definition
of a hero of justice.

00:26:09.404 --> 00:26:10.940
[Shirou] I understand that now.

00:26:11.474 --> 00:26:13.880
<i>When you put it like that,</i>
<i>it's obvious.</i>

00:26:14.213 --> 00:26:17.019
<i>But still‐‐</i>
<i>but still I hate it.</i>

00:26:17.086 --> 00:26:19.525
<i>I don't care about salvation</i>
<i>that's limited</i>

00:26:19.591 --> 00:26:21.060
<i>to a set number of people.</i>

00:26:21.896 --> 00:26:23.265
<i>I can't bear seeing others</i>

<i>who I didn't know</i>
<i>dying around me</i>

00:26:24.902 --> 00:26:26.672
<i>like they did that day.</i>

<i>[Man] You sure about that?</i>

<i>[Woman] I'm actually an expert</i>

00:27:07.587 --> 00:27:09.157
[Taiga] Mm, she was feeling kind
of tired

00:27:09.223 --> 00:27:10.927
and needed
to go home early tonight.

00:27:10.994 --> 00:27:12.764
Why'd you let her go home
by herself?

00:27:12.831 --> 00:27:14.300
It's too dangerous.

00:27:14.367 --> 00:27:16.906
You were the one who warned
us both that it wasn't safe

00:27:16.972 --> 00:27:19.143
to go out alone right now.
Don't you remember?

00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:20.613
[Taiga] Don't worry.

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:23.385
<i>I sent one of my guys with her</i>
<i>so she'll be fine.</i>

<i>[Shirou] You know you should</i>
<i>have been the one to go.</i>

00:27:25.289 --> 00:27:27.293
<i>You're our teacher,</i>

00:27:27.627 --> 00:27:28.896
<i>[Taiga] Huh?</i>

00:27:28.963 --> 00:27:30.600
If I did that I wouldn't get
to eat dinner

00:27:30.667 --> 00:27:32.303

00:27:32.369 --> 00:27:33.606
Anyway, don't blame me.

00:27:33.673 --> 00:27:35.543
It's your own fault
for coming home so late because

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:36.679
of work.

00:27:36.745 --> 00:27:38.415
My stomach always
waits patiently

00:27:39.551 --> 00:27:40.653
It does, huh?

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.056
You do know that you have
the option

00:27:42.122 --> 00:27:44.026
of eating dinner
at your own house, don't you?

00:27:44.093 --> 00:27:45.262
Hmm?

00:27:45.329 --> 00:27:48.134

This is my own house.

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:50.405
Yeah, right.

00:27:51.007 --> 00:27:51.775
Huh?

00:27:51.842 --> 00:27:53.011

I gotta kill

00:37:16.404 --> 00:37:18.474
the same person twice
in one day.

00:37:18.542 --> 00:37:20.445
I guess the human world

00:37:20.513 --> 00:37:22.282
is a bloody place whatever
the era.

00:37:22.349 --> 00:37:24.353

00:37:30.766 --> 00:37:31.968
Huh?

00:37:32.436 --> 00:37:34.173
[scoffs]
This time, kid,

00:37:34.239 --> 00:37:35.876
you're going straight
to the afterlife.

00:37:48.869 --> 00:37:49.971
Wow.

00:37:50.506 --> 00:37:52.242
Now that's a rather odd trick.

00:37:52.309 --> 00:37:54.514
[breathing heavily]

00:37:54.581 --> 00:37:57.385
It's faint
but I sense mana in you.

00:37:57.452 --> 00:37:59.289
So that's why you're still alive

00:37:59.356 --> 00:38:01.160
after having
your heart skewered.

00:38:01.227 --> 00:38:03.297

00:38:23.972 --> 00:38:25.008
Huh.

00:38:25.074 --> 00:38:27.312
I was kind enough
to give you a chance, kid,

00:38:27.379 --> 00:38:28.582
but you blew it.

00:38:29.216 --> 00:38:30.853

00:38:46.852 --> 00:38:49.389
That last move
was pretty surprising, kid.

00:38:49.456 --> 00:38:51.595
[whimpering]

00:38:51.661 --> 00:38:54.166
But I really don't get it,
though.

00:38:54.233 --> 00:38:55.401
You're fast on your feet

00:38:55.468 --> 00:38:57.172
but you're hopeless
at magecraft.

00:38:57.239 --> 00:38:59.142
You do have a knack for it.

00:38:59.811 --> 00:39:02.617
It could be that you are meant
to be the seventh master.

00:39:02.683 --> 00:39:06.023
Well, even if you were,
this is the end for you.

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:07.960
Screw all this.

00:39:08.027 --> 00:39:09.831
[shuddering]

00:39:10.666 --> 00:39:12.770
[Shirou] My live was spared.

00:39:13.137 --> 00:39:14.039
And so I'm not going

00:39:14.106 --> 00:39:16.477
to let myself be killed
that easily.

00:39:17.847 --> 00:39:21.621
I have to live
and fulfill all my obligations,

00:39:21.688 --> 00:39:23.659
and I can't do that if I'm dead.

00:39:24.861 --> 00:39:27.667
I'm not gonna be killed here
for no reason!

00:39:29.369 --> 00:39:31.775
Not by a bastard like you!

00:39:32.275 --> 00:39:33.979
No matter what it costs me!

00:39:41.227 --> 00:39:42.697
The seventh servant is here?

00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:54.554
‐ [Saber] I ask you.
‐ [gasps]

00:39:57.727 --> 00:39:59.162
[Saber] Are you worthy to be...

00:40:00.532 --> 00:40:01.901
My master?

00:40:09.918 --> 00:40:11.988
Your master?

00:40:14.527 --> 00:40:16.330
I'm your servant, Saber.

00:40:16.397 --> 00:40:18.869
I have come in response
to your summons.

00:40:19.202 --> 00:40:20.773
Your order, master.

00:40:21.808 --> 00:40:23.044
[groans]

00:40:24.547 --> 00:40:27.018
My sword will henceforth be
at your side.

00:40:27.085 --> 00:40:29.757
Your fate is now my fate.

00:40:30.258 --> 00:40:31.828
[Saber] Our pact is now sealed.

00:40:33.865 --> 00:40:34.901
Wait!

00:40:34.968 --> 00:40:36.671
What do you mean by "our pact?"

Who do you think you are,

00:41:20.993 --> 00:41:23.598

like some kind of a coward?

[grunts]

00:41:28.608 --> 00:41:30.111
What is wrong, Lancer?

00:41:30.178 --> 00:41:32.717
Simply standing there
will give spearmen a bad name.

00:41:33.084 --> 00:41:34.419
[Saber] If you will not come
to me,

00:41:34.486 --> 00:41:35.723
I shall go to you.

00:41:35.789 --> 00:41:38.027
Before you do,
let me ask you this.

00:41:38.361 --> 00:41:40.666
Is a sword your Noble Phantasm?

00:41:41.066 --> 00:41:42.770
[Saber] Perhaps.
Perhaps not.

00:41:42.837 --> 00:41:45.141
It may be a battle axe
ore a polearm.

00:41:45.208 --> 00:41:46.578
[weapon clangs]

00:41:46.644 --> 00:41:48.682
Or it might even be a bow,

00:41:48.749 --> 00:41:50.919
or a weapon like yours, Lancer.

00:41:51.554 --> 00:41:52.623
[scoffs]

00:41:52.690 --> 00:41:55.194
Very funny,
swordsman.

00:41:55.261 --> 00:41:57.132
What is that stance?

00:41:57.198 --> 00:41:59.771
[Lancer] I have
one more question for you.

00:41:59.837 --> 00:42:02.042
Since this is our first meeting,

00:42:02.108 --> 00:42:04.212
would you like to just call it
a draw?

00:42:04.279 --> 00:42:05.582
I think not.

00:42:05.649 --> 00:42:08.688
You will fall here, Lancer,
and you know it.

00:42:09.089 --> 00:42:10.191
Is that so?

00:42:10.258 --> 00:42:12.963
Damn, my objective was simply
to observe.

00:42:13.932 --> 00:42:14.967

You're very lucky, Saber.

00:43:09.911 --> 00:43:12.182
You dodged my ultimate blow.

00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:16.758
[electric sparking]
A curse?

00:43:17.425 --> 00:43:18.595
No, wait.

00:43:18.662 --> 00:43:20.933

and effect?

00:43:21.366 --> 00:43:22.736
[Saber] That was Gae Bolg.

00:43:22.803 --> 00:43:25.241
You must be Ireland's child
of light.

00:43:25.308 --> 00:43:26.443
Damn.

00:43:26.511 --> 00:43:28.013
I really messed up.

00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:29.282
If I use that move,

00:43:29.349 --> 00:43:31.588
it has to be fatal
or I'm in big trouble.

[footsteps approaching]
[gasps]

00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:36.263
[Lancer] My master is somewhat
of a coward, you see.

00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:38.668
You dodged my spear
so he's ordering me

00:43:38.735 --> 00:43:39.704
to retreat now.

00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:41.674
You're running away?

You're more than welcome
to follow.

00:43:45.616 --> 00:43:46.818
But if you do,

00:43:46.885 --> 00:43:49.089
you had better prepare yourself
to die.

00:43:52.162 --> 00:43:53.532
Wait, come back!

00:43:53.598 --> 00:43:56.236
Is she some kind of idiot?

00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:59.209
Hey, are you all right?

00:44:04.319 --> 00:44:05.421
Oh, my God.

00:44:05.488 --> 00:44:06.791
What the hell are you?

00:44:07.593 --> 00:44:08.728
As you can see,

00:44:08.795 --> 00:44:10.833
I am your saber‐class servant.

00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:13.738
As such,
could you please call me Saber?

00:44:14.306 --> 00:44:15.509
[gasping]

00:44:15.943 --> 00:44:17.580
My name is Shirou.

Shirou Emiya.

00:44:20.519 --> 00:44:21.821
Emiya?

00:44:23.825 --> 00:44:26.063
I live here.
No, wait.

00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:28.267
That's not what I really want
to say.

00:44:30.471 --> 00:44:31.641
[Saber] I see.

00:44:31.975 --> 00:44:34.212
I understand that you are not
a proper master.

00:44:34.279 --> 00:44:36.183
[Shirou] Uh...

00:44:36.518 --> 00:44:37.887
But despite that fact,

00:44:37.953 --> 00:44:39.590
you are my master all the same.

00:44:39.657 --> 00:44:42.395
[Shirou] Wait, isn't it weird
to start calling me master all

00:44:42.462 --> 00:44:43.665
of a sudden like that?

00:44:44.634 --> 00:44:46.704
Then I shall call you Shirou.

00:44:49.209 --> 00:44:52.850
Yes, the sound of that
is quite pleasing to my ears.

00:44:54.085 --> 00:44:55.254
[groans]

00:44:55.789 --> 00:44:57.726
[gasps]
What the hell?

00:44:58.595 --> 00:45:00.999
[Saber] Those are what is known
as command seals.

00:45:01.066 --> 00:45:03.137
Try to avoid
using them carelessly.

00:45:04.574 --> 00:45:06.476
Shirou, please heal me.

00:45:06.878 --> 00:45:08.414
You're asking me to do that?

00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:11.420
Sorry, but magic like that
is way beyond me.

00:45:11.486 --> 00:45:13.758
I shall face them
in my current condition, then.

00:45:15.094 --> 00:45:16.998
[Saber] There
are two enemies outside.

00:45:17.065 --> 00:45:20.004
One more battle should not pose
a problem for me.

00:45:20.071 --> 00:45:22.075
[Shirou] What do you mean,
enemies outside?

00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:24.379

Saber, stop!

Are you insane, Shirou?

00:45:42.850 --> 00:45:44.887
I could have defeated them
handily right now!

00:45:44.954 --> 00:45:46.223
Why did you stop me?

00:45:46.290 --> 00:45:47.993
[Shirou] Just hold on a second!

00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:50.431
I have no idea what's
going on here!

00:45:50.498 --> 00:45:51.634
If I'm your master,

00:45:51.701 --> 00:45:53.470
at least tell me what this
is about!

00:45:53.538 --> 00:45:56.143

in front of the enemy!
