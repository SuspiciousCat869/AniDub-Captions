He's running out of mana.

00:00:37.107 --> 00:00:38.578
[Archer] Don't get
your hopes up.

00:00:39.111 --> 00:00:41.482
I have the lifespan
of the Archer class,

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.621
but even if it reaches
its limit,

00:00:43.688 --> 00:00:46.560
this boy is still no match
for me in combat.

00:00:46.627 --> 00:00:48.496
Not by a long shot.

00:00:49.165 --> 00:00:50.602
Shirou Emiya,

00:00:50.668 --> 00:00:53.741
you are going to die here
no matter what.

00:01:06.065 --> 00:01:07.502
Now Rin,

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:10.307
in a moment I'm going
to relieve you of your heart.

00:01:10.374 --> 00:01:11.442
[grunts]

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.346
[Shinji] Hey, hold on just
a second here!

00:01:13.413 --> 00:01:14.683
That wasn't the deal!

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.288
You told me I could
have Tohsaka, remember?

00:01:17.354 --> 00:01:18.925
[grunts]
You can't!

00:01:18.991 --> 00:01:20.127
She's mine!
It's final!

00:01:20.193 --> 00:01:21.730
[shudders]

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.905
Do you have any last words
before we settle

00:01:25.972 --> 00:01:27.308
the business at hand?

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.581
[Kirei] A final request,
perhaps?

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:32.151
[Rin scoffs]

00:01:32.217 --> 00:01:33.420
Don't act like you don't know

00:01:33.486 --> 00:01:34.890
what I'm thinking right now.

00:01:34.957 --> 00:01:36.760
You know me too well for that.
[footsteps approaching]

00:01:37.696 --> 00:01:38.965
[Kirei] Very true.

00:01:39.031 --> 00:01:41.870
I've become quite familiar
with your tenacity.

00:01:41.937 --> 00:01:43.674
At the same time,

00:01:43.741 --> 00:01:47.181
I also know that you are
a person who accepts reality

00:01:47.247 --> 00:01:49.151
when it cannot be altered.

00:01:49.218 --> 00:01:50.722
[shuddering]

00:01:51.089 --> 00:01:52.458
I'm impressed.

00:01:52.525 --> 00:01:55.832
I find that contradiction
to be most exquisite.

But how did you...
[groans]

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.944
I hate to break it to you,
Kotomine...

00:02:19.613 --> 00:02:21.917
But if a scratch like that
did me in,

00:02:21.984 --> 00:02:24.723
I wouldn't be much
of a hero now, would I?

00:02:25.257 --> 00:02:26.727

00:02:39.418 --> 00:02:41.657
So this is how it all ends.

00:02:41.724 --> 00:02:42.792
Pathetic.

What's with, "The Holy Grail
will be mine," bullshit?

00:02:58.924 --> 00:03:02.164
You always were pretty useless,
weren't you?

00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:04.068
Right, holy man?

00:03:05.337 --> 00:03:06.707
But I"m okay with it.

00:03:06.774 --> 00:03:08.009
I'm not complaining.

00:03:08.076 --> 00:03:11.182
I'm not the kind of person
who holds a grudge.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.587
Besides, I suppose
it's kinda lame

00:03:13.654 --> 00:03:15.490
to complain to a dead man,
right?

00:03:15.558 --> 00:03:17.929
But it's worse
to keep a lady waiting!

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:20.267
No more distractions.

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:22.572
We finally got a little privacy.

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:25.444
I worked so hard
to make this happen.

00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:27.481
Can't have you dying
that easily.

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.185
I mean,
it wouldn't be fair!

00:03:29.251 --> 00:03:31.623
Not after I've been so patient.

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.861
I'm so close to having
the Holy Grail,

00:03:33.928 --> 00:03:35.197
I can taste it.

00:03:35.263 --> 00:03:37.234
It isn't too late,
you know.

00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:39.506
You can still agree
to be mine forever.

00:03:39.573 --> 00:03:41.910
Just say yes
and you can have your share.

00:03:42.377 --> 00:03:44.683
‐ [Rin] What an idiot.
‐ Huh?

00:03:45.417 --> 00:03:46.954
[Rin] You still haven't
learned anything,

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.156
have you?

00:03:48.223 --> 00:03:49.425
[scoffs]

00:03:49.492 --> 00:03:51.162
Don't you get it?
It's not too late.

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:52.264
Not for you!

00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:53.667
Get out of here,
you idiot!

00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:55.571
You'll die if you stay,
so go!

If I like what I hear,

00:04:20.287 --> 00:04:22.759
then I might even let you live!

00:04:23.326 --> 00:04:25.865
Damn, you're beyond saving,
aren't you?

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:28.069

dirty hands again.

[groans]
The hell?

00:04:46.239 --> 00:04:50.247
Shouldn't you be dying right now
instead of offering up opinions?

00:04:52.384 --> 00:04:53.687

I'll make sure your death
is a painful one.

[Shinji] You hear that,
Gilgamesh?

00:04:57.929 --> 00:05:00.233
This guy says he wants
to die like a hero,

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.570
so help him out!

00:05:04.041 --> 00:05:07.549
Hey, what's going on?
Why isn't he coming?

00:05:07.615 --> 00:05:09.251
Aren't you listening?

00:05:09.318 --> 00:05:11.189

You saved my life.

Heh.

You thought your own projections

were on par with mine?

00:06:08.336 --> 00:06:10.106
You might be able
to mimic the designs

00:06:10.173 --> 00:06:11.108
and materials,

00:06:11.175 --> 00:06:12.144

[Archer] Now I see why
you're so persistent.

00:06:45.778 --> 00:06:48.216
I've heard of magecraft
that allows mastery

00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:51.489
of old skills by evoking them
from a previous life

00:06:51.556 --> 00:06:53.459
and letting them possess you.

00:06:53.527 --> 00:06:55.798
Your skill keeps improving

Guess that makes both
of us copycats.

You keep acting cool.

00:07:03.179 --> 00:07:05.450

You're an optimistic fool.

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:12.464
You have no idea

00:07:19.311 --> 00:07:20.615
you have no chance of winning.

00:08:33.961 --> 00:08:36.566
That's what catching up
to me means.

00:08:36.633 --> 00:08:38.804
See it again for yourself.

00:08:39.806 --> 00:08:42.177
The world I ended up in.

00:08:42.678 --> 00:08:46.520
I am the bone of my sword.

00:08:46.586 --> 00:08:49.993
Unknown to death
nor known to life.

00:08:50.761 --> 00:08:53.767
Unlimited blade works!

00:09:04.121 --> 00:09:05.991
[shudders]

00:09:08.496 --> 00:09:09.532
[coughs]

00:09:09.599 --> 00:09:10.968
[gasps]

00:09:11.035 --> 00:09:12.538
‐ [Lancer] Don't worry.
‐ [gasps]

00:09:13.507 --> 00:09:15.243
I've gotten rather used
to this.

00:09:16.513 --> 00:09:18.416
It's the fate of being a hero.

00:09:18.817 --> 00:09:22.157
Sacrificing your life
to follow some stupid order.

00:09:22.692 --> 00:09:23.927
Ah, well.

00:09:24.361 --> 00:09:27.602
I guess we both ended up
with crappy partners, huh?

00:09:27.668 --> 00:09:29.104
[Rin] You're right.

00:09:29.471 --> 00:09:31.543
But mine wasn't crappy, exactly.

00:09:32.043 --> 00:09:34.114
More like completely
unmanageable.

00:09:34.883 --> 00:09:36.452
You're not kidding.

00:09:36.953 --> 00:09:40.694
Most humans are a pain
in the ass on the best of days,

00:09:40.761 --> 00:09:43.600
but that guy's really goin'
for the gold.

00:09:44.067 --> 00:09:46.272
[Lancer] Too much for even you
to handle.

00:09:46.338 --> 00:09:49.779
Yeah, but it made me try harder.

00:09:50.313 --> 00:09:52.785
For as long as Archer acted
as my servant,

00:09:52.852 --> 00:09:56.392
I swore I would only do
what I truly believed in,

00:09:56.459 --> 00:09:58.564
despite the consequences.

00:09:58.630 --> 00:09:59.799
<i>[Rin] I hate to say it,</i>

00:09:59.866 --> 00:10:02.270
<i>but I don't think</i>
<i>I can save him.</i>

00:10:02.772 --> 00:10:05.443
<i>Because I think he's right.</i>

00:10:05.811 --> 00:10:09.284
<i>His choices,</i>
<i>even his regrets,</i>

00:10:09.351 --> 00:10:10.721
<i>they're all justified.</i>

00:10:11.222 --> 00:10:13.727
<i>Makes me feel so callous</i>
<i>to think that way,</i>

00:10:13.794 --> 00:10:16.265
<i>and that makes me angry</i>
<i>at myself.</i>

00:10:16.332 --> 00:10:20.340
That's why all I can really do
is pursue my own goals.

00:10:20.908 --> 00:10:22.945
I need to keep fighting
for what I believe in

00:10:23.012 --> 00:10:25.818
just like a certain someone
that we both know.

00:10:25.885 --> 00:10:28.156
And besides,
what else can I do?

00:10:29.391 --> 00:10:31.095
I've got to repay him.

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:33.934
And I can't think
of a better way to do it.

00:10:34.468 --> 00:10:36.706
Ah, geez.

00:10:37.508 --> 00:10:39.746
Things mighta been different
if I'd had the chance

00:10:39.813 --> 00:10:42.050
to partner up
with a woman like you.

00:10:42.417 --> 00:10:45.223
[Lancer] But I never did have
much luck finding good women.

00:10:46.025 --> 00:10:47.060
Damn.

00:10:47.494 --> 00:10:51.268
I guess that'll never change
no matter how many times I try.

00:10:51.335 --> 00:10:52.839
[flames sizzling]

00:10:52.905 --> 00:10:54.609
Well, you'd better get going.

00:10:55.043 --> 00:10:56.713
I'll take him with me.

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:00.186
[grunts]

00:11:02.324 --> 00:11:03.660
[Rin] Goodbye, Lancer.

00:11:03.727 --> 00:11:05.831
I didn't know you very long,

00:11:05.898 --> 00:11:07.902
but you make me wish
that I had.

00:11:11.877 --> 00:11:14.414
Heh, silly girl.

00:11:15.183 --> 00:11:17.655
Come find me again
when you're older.

00:11:22.497 --> 00:11:24.001
[whooshes]

00:11:25.971 --> 00:11:29.044
[Shirou breathing heavily]

00:11:30.781 --> 00:11:33.252
A fool who knows his dreams
are unattainable

00:11:33.319 --> 00:11:34.856
but comes anyway.

00:11:34.923 --> 00:11:37.628
A fraud without a will
of his own who's wasted

00:11:37.695 --> 00:11:39.766
his life on a ridiculous ideal.

00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:43.105
Can you finally admit
that's who you truly are?

00:11:44.341 --> 00:11:46.913
Saving people just because
you want to

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:49.586
is both selfish
and misguided.

00:11:50.186 --> 00:11:52.157
[Archer] You're a defect
of humanity.

00:11:52.224 --> 00:11:54.829
You should never have existed
in the first place!

00:11:55.396 --> 00:11:57.735
There's no point
in a life like yours!

00:11:57.802 --> 00:11:59.037
[grunts]

00:11:59.104 --> 00:12:01.610
You know that I'm your ideal,

00:12:01.676 --> 00:12:04.916
and you should know now
your dream never comes true.

00:12:04.983 --> 00:12:07.755
[shudders]
[hissing]

00:12:07.822 --> 00:12:09.124
[groans]

00:12:09.525 --> 00:12:12.598
[screaming]

00:12:12.665 --> 00:12:14.669
[blades clang]
I see.

00:12:15.236 --> 00:12:17.842
I suppose it's only natural
for you to deny me...

00:12:18.677 --> 00:12:20.848
As the ideal of Shirou Emiya.

00:12:21.382 --> 00:12:23.687
I'm the only person
you can never bring yourself

00:12:23.754 --> 00:12:24.756
to accept.

00:12:24.822 --> 00:12:26.225
[groaning]

[gasping]

00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:31.870
[grunting]

00:12:31.937 --> 00:12:33.707
‐ [Shirou gasps]
‐ [Archer scoffs]

00:12:33.774 --> 00:12:35.009
Now tell me.

00:12:35.076 --> 00:12:36.412
Knowing what you know,

00:12:36.478 --> 00:12:39.619
do you honestly want
to be a hero of justice?

00:12:39.686 --> 00:12:42.257
[winces]
I've already told you that.

00:12:42.758 --> 00:12:44.829
It isn't that I want
to become one.

00:12:45.229 --> 00:12:48.302
It's that I will become one
no matter what!

00:12:48.369 --> 00:12:49.572
[groaning]

00:12:49.639 --> 00:12:51.041
You're right.

00:12:51.108 --> 00:12:53.479
You must become one
no matter what.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.651
You are Shirou Emiya,

00:12:55.718 --> 00:12:58.523
and it's the only thing you've
ever been passionate about,

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:01.563
even though you know that
the heart of a hero

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:03.767
of justice simply isn't in you.

00:13:03.834 --> 00:13:05.671
‐ [groaning]
‐ There, you see?

00:13:05.738 --> 00:13:06.973
Your reaction tells me

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.277
that you've always suspected
it yourself.

00:13:10.113 --> 00:13:12.785
<i>[Archer] Memories</i>
<i>of my past faded long ago.</i>

00:13:13.654 --> 00:13:14.889
<i>But there's still one sight</i>

00:13:14.956 --> 00:13:16.993
<i>that stayed with me</i>
<i>all this time.</i>

00:13:18.295 --> 00:13:19.464
<i>The flames</i>

00:13:19.532 --> 00:13:21.870
<i>and the pervasive stench</i>
<i>of death,</i>

00:13:21.936 --> 00:13:23.974
<i>wishing for help</i>
<i>when there was none,</i>

00:13:24.041 --> 00:13:26.011
<i>what I felt when the wish</i>
<i>was granted,</i>

00:13:26.078 --> 00:13:27.782
<i>but most of all,</i>

00:13:27.848 --> 00:13:31.121
<i>I remember the look of relief</i>
<i>on Kiritsugu Emiya's face</i>

00:13:31.188 --> 00:13:32.490
<i>when he saved me.</i>

00:13:32.558 --> 00:13:34.696
That is where your dream began.

00:13:34.762 --> 00:13:37.500
<i>It was some time before</i>
<i>you finally felt gratitude</i>

00:13:37.568 --> 00:13:39.271
<i>for being saved.</i>

00:13:39.872 --> 00:13:42.410
You adored Kiritsugu Emiya.
That's all.

00:13:43.547 --> 00:13:45.083
And because of him,

00:13:45.149 --> 00:13:48.189
because you saw how happy
he was when he saved you,

00:13:48.255 --> 00:13:51.261
you began to think you
could have the same thing.

00:13:51.996 --> 00:13:53.399
<i>[Shirou] He's right.</i>

00:13:53.466 --> 00:13:56.138
<i>It wasn't me who</i>
<i>was saved that day.</i>

00:13:56.205 --> 00:13:59.378
<i>A massive blaze</i>
<i>that left no survivors,</i>

00:13:59.444 --> 00:14:01.883
<i>a child who should</i>
<i>have been beyond saving,</i>

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:04.689
<i>and the man</i>
<i>who stumbled across him.</i>

00:14:04.756 --> 00:14:06.358
<i>To tell the truth,</i>

00:14:06.425 --> 00:14:09.031
<i>I don't know which one</i>
<i>was the real miracle.</i>

00:14:09.464 --> 00:14:12.270
Children will often idolize
their parents.

00:14:12.738 --> 00:14:17.080
But when he died,
a curse was your inheritance.

00:14:17.848 --> 00:14:19.317
<i>[Archer] At that moment,</i>

00:14:19.384 --> 00:14:22.457
<i>that man left you no choice</i>
<i>but to become a hero.</i>

00:14:23.927 --> 00:14:26.633
The ideals you cling to
are second‐hand.

00:14:26.699 --> 00:14:29.872
Ideals Kiritsugu Emiya failed
to live up to.

00:14:29.939 --> 00:14:31.609
In the end,

00:14:31.676 --> 00:14:34.882
all you're doing is imitating
what he believed was right.

00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:36.653
You're wrong.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:40.928
[Archer] Hero of justice?
Don't make me laugh.

00:14:41.529 --> 00:14:43.900
Just because
the idea consumes you,

00:14:43.967 --> 00:14:47.240
it doesn't mean helping others
is something you truly want.

00:14:47.307 --> 00:14:49.579
It's nothing but
a borrowed dream.

00:14:49.645 --> 00:14:53.219
Someone like you thinking you
can be a force for good?

00:14:54.087 --> 00:14:56.458
It is the height of hubris!

00:14:56.526 --> 00:14:57.762
[glass shattering]

00:14:57.828 --> 00:14:59.498

00:15:02.905 --> 00:15:04.174
That's right!

00:15:04.241 --> 00:15:06.478
You couldn't help but admire
the beauty

00:15:06.546 --> 00:15:08.517
in your father's dream
of helping others!

00:15:08.583 --> 00:15:12.290
That's why you never developed
any real passions

00:15:12.357 --> 00:15:13.627
of your own!

00:15:14.361 --> 00:15:17.935
If that isn't hypocrisy,
then what is?

00:15:18.469 --> 00:15:20.741
[Archer] You're driven
by this ridiculous obsession

00:15:20.808 --> 00:15:23.580
with sacrificing yourself
for the sake of others,

00:15:23.647 --> 00:15:25.483
blind to your own arrogance!

00:15:25.551 --> 00:15:26.719
[blow lands]
[Shirou groans]

00:15:26.786 --> 00:15:28.055
No!

00:15:28.122 --> 00:15:30.059
[Archer] But in the end,
you're a fraud,

00:15:30.126 --> 00:15:32.998
and your hypocrisy
can't save anyone!

00:15:33.065 --> 00:15:34.936
How could you when
you never knew

00:15:35.002 --> 00:15:36.773
who you should save
to begin with?

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.109
And look.

00:15:38.175 --> 00:15:39.846
This is the result.

00:15:40.213 --> 00:15:42.050
You could never be a savior.

00:15:42.117 --> 00:15:44.020
You never had anything to save!

00:15:44.087 --> 00:15:46.626
You became the embodiment
of justice,

00:15:46.693 --> 00:15:48.563
and justice can be cruel!

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:49.699
[grunts]

00:15:51.135 --> 00:15:53.707
[Archer] Your ideals
are falling apart.

00:15:54.307 --> 00:15:57.280
Maybe other people aren't
more important than you are.

00:15:57.347 --> 00:16:00.219
It's dawning on you that a world
where everyone is happy

00:16:00.286 --> 00:16:02.357
is just a fairy tale,

00:16:02.423 --> 00:16:05.062
and if you can't live without
that dream,

00:16:05.129 --> 00:16:07.768
let it drag you down
and drown you!

00:16:07.835 --> 00:16:10.941
[whimpering]

00:16:20.761 --> 00:16:22.197
<i>But I couldn't</i>
<i>help thinking there</i>

00:16:48.984 --> 00:16:50.286
<i>You were right.</i>

00:16:50.353 --> 00:16:52.658
<i>At least,</i>
<i>I think you were.</i>

00:16:55.764 --> 00:16:57.701

[exhales sharply]

00:17:00.674 --> 00:17:03.445
It seems to me like you've lost
a lot of things.

00:17:05.016 --> 00:17:06.686
[Archer] You've got
it all wrong.

00:17:07.253 --> 00:17:10.359
I'm here because I tried not
to lose anything.

00:17:11.128 --> 00:17:12.330
And I didn't.

00:17:12.998 --> 00:17:14.200
Not one thing.

00:17:15.436 --> 00:17:18.577
No,
come to think of it,

00:17:18.643 --> 00:17:20.246
there is one thing.

00:17:20.647 --> 00:17:22.050
Something I forgot.

00:17:25.256 --> 00:17:28.830
[Shirou] I saw the hell that led
<i>to all the others.</i>

[Shirou whimpering]
