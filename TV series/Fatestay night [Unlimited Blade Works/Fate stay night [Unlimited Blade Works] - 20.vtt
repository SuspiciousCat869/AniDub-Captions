You sure took your time
getting here,

00:02:31.402 --> 00:02:33.574
Shirou Emiya.

00:02:34.008 --> 00:02:36.446
Yeah, I finally understand.

00:02:36.513 --> 00:02:39.151
There's no way there were two
of those pendants.

00:02:39.686 --> 00:02:41.557
‐ Originally it‐‐
‐ [Archer] That's right.

00:02:44.462 --> 00:02:46.934
You see,
after your life was spared,

00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:49.405
you carried it for the rest
of your life.

00:02:49.806 --> 00:02:53.480
A unique memento that belonged
to Rin Tohsaka's father.

00:02:53.547 --> 00:02:56.987
A heroic spirit cannot
be summoned without a catalyst,

00:02:57.054 --> 00:03:00.595
but Rin Tohsaka didn't have one
to use in the invocation.

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:03.934
<i>That's why she assumed‐‐</i>
<i>wrongly, of course‐‐</i>

00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:06.774
<i>that she had summoned</i>
<i>a servant at random.</i>

00:03:07.408 --> 00:03:10.882
But no heroic spirit
is ever called upon by chance.

00:03:10.948 --> 00:03:14.288
A link must exist between
the summoner and the spirit.

00:03:14.756 --> 00:03:15.758
But wait.

00:03:15.825 --> 00:03:18.096
If Rin had no catalyst herself,
then‐‐

00:03:18.163 --> 00:03:19.498
[Archer] Yes.

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:21.570
That piece of the puzzle
was provided by

00:03:21.637 --> 00:03:24.910
the heroic spirit being summoned
and not the summoner.

00:03:33.794 --> 00:03:34.963
Which means...

00:03:35.363 --> 00:03:36.533
[Archer] Right.

00:03:37.034 --> 00:03:40.708
It means it's quite possible
to summon a heroic spirit

00:03:40.775 --> 00:03:41.910
from the future.

00:03:42.444 --> 00:03:43.714
[Shirou] Archer.

00:03:43.781 --> 00:03:45.317
Where is Tohsaka?

00:03:45.852 --> 00:03:48.724
I gave her to Shinji Matou
when he stopped by.

00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:49.826
You did what?

00:03:49.893 --> 00:03:51.597
‐ [Lancer] Take it easy, kid.
‐ [both gasping]

00:03:52.431 --> 00:03:54.736
[Lancer] Just leave
the little lady to me.

00:03:54.803 --> 00:03:56.005
Are you sure?

00:03:56.472 --> 00:03:58.443
[Lancer] Those are
the master's orders.

00:03:59.145 --> 00:04:01.416
The only reason I've been
working with you this whole time

00:04:01.482 --> 00:04:03.219
was to keep her alive.

00:04:03.654 --> 00:04:07.094
But I have to admit,
it's actually been kind of nice.

00:04:07.161 --> 00:04:09.198
I rarely enjoy the tasks
I'm given.

00:04:09.265 --> 00:04:11.235
This was an exception.

00:04:11.637 --> 00:04:14.308
So why don't you let me
look after her for now?

00:04:14.375 --> 00:04:15.578
Once this is over,

00:04:15.645 --> 00:04:17.882

00:04:30.373 --> 00:04:32.311
I shall remain here
for the time being.

00:04:32.377 --> 00:04:33.581
Seriously?

00:04:33.647 --> 00:04:35.885
But the little lady
is your master now.

00:04:36.553 --> 00:04:37.789
[Saber] I know that.

00:04:38.223 --> 00:04:42.464
However, I choose to stay
and bear witness to this battle.

00:04:42.932 --> 00:04:44.001
[scoffs]

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.038

00:04:46.405 --> 00:04:47.742
Have it your way.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.617
[Archer] Bear witness, huh?

00:04:52.317 --> 00:04:53.787
That's good to hear.

00:04:54.756 --> 00:04:56.359
I wouldn't want you interfering.

00:04:56.425 --> 00:04:57.795
If you did,

00:04:57.862 --> 00:05:00.467
I'd have severed my contract
with Rin for nothing.

00:05:00.868 --> 00:05:03.006
No.
No matter what happens,

00:05:03.072 --> 00:05:05.611
I will not stand between you
and Shirou.

00:05:05.978 --> 00:05:08.416
In exchange for this,
answer me.

00:05:08.818 --> 00:05:11.557
Why exactly is killing him
so important to you?

00:05:11.623 --> 00:05:13.928
I'm surprised you even have
to ask.

00:05:13.994 --> 00:05:16.867
Neither of us can accept
each other as we are.

00:05:16.934 --> 00:05:19.573
Sorry to disappoint you,
but it's as simple as that.

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:21.309
[Saber] That cannot be true.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.481
You're the very embodiment
of the ideals and dreams

00:05:24.549 --> 00:05:26.285
of Shirou Emiya.

00:05:26.352 --> 00:05:27.722
You are both the same.

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:29.960
How can you reject yourself?

00:05:30.126 --> 00:05:31.663
Unlike you,

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.237
I didn't become a heroic spirit
entirely on my own merits.

00:05:35.738 --> 00:05:38.476
I simply traded one afterlife
for another.

00:05:38.544 --> 00:05:40.848
I'm a guardian.
Nothing more.

00:05:40.915 --> 00:05:42.317
A guardian?

00:05:45.156 --> 00:05:46.425
Now go.

You may wanna be nice
to me for a change.

00:05:59.084 --> 00:06:00.320
Know what I mean?

00:06:00.387 --> 00:06:03.594
Or have you not yet realized
the position you're in?

00:06:03.661 --> 00:06:05.765
Yeah, well,
look who's talking.

00:06:05.831 --> 00:06:08.236
It's you who's in
for a rude awakening.

would ya?

00:06:10.373 --> 00:06:11.944

you have a thick skull.

00:06:17.855 --> 00:06:19.258
Ah, there.

00:06:19.325 --> 00:06:20.728
You're giving up,
aren't you?

00:06:20.795 --> 00:06:23.233
So does that mean that
you've finally come around?

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:25.103
You've accepted
that you're mine?

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:27.074
[Shinji chuckles]
Damn.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.313

of perfectly toned legs.

[grunts]

00:06:31.883 --> 00:06:34.656

00:06:43.239 --> 00:06:44.643
Ah.

00:06:44.976 --> 00:06:46.245
Really sorry about that.

00:06:46.312 --> 00:06:49.051
I meant to say stop,
but I punched you instead.

00:06:49.385 --> 00:06:50.453
[gasps]

00:06:50.521 --> 00:06:52.090
Lancer?

00:06:52.725 --> 00:06:53.894
Hey.

00:06:53.961 --> 00:06:56.432
But what‐‐what
are you doing here?

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:57.602
Save your breath.

00:06:57.669 --> 00:06:59.438
Let's focus on getting you free.

00:06:59.506 --> 00:07:01.375
Then you can do what you want.

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:03.514
[Lancer] Stop those idiots
from fighting

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.116
or just sneak out and go home.

00:07:05.183 --> 00:07:06.586
All the same to me.

00:07:06.653 --> 00:07:08.624
[gasps]
Lancer, look out!

00:07:09.358 --> 00:07:10.628
Who's there?

00:07:11.095 --> 00:07:13.433
[Kirei] That's quite enough,
Lancer.

00:07:14.769 --> 00:07:16.974
I instructed you
to work with them.

00:07:18.811 --> 00:07:21.950
But I did not tell you
to care about them.

00:07:23.086 --> 00:07:24.188
Kirei, you're...

00:07:25.156 --> 00:07:26.593
<i>[Saber] A guardian?</i>

00:07:26.927 --> 00:07:29.532
But then you're supposed
to be protecting humanity

00:07:29.599 --> 00:07:31.637
by serving as a deterrent force.

00:07:32.304 --> 00:07:33.707
And if that is the case,

00:07:33.774 --> 00:07:35.978
you are a heroic spirit.

00:07:36.045 --> 00:07:38.282
That's where you're wrong,
Saber.

00:07:38.817 --> 00:07:41.222
Guardians don't
protect humanity.

00:07:41.556 --> 00:07:43.594
They're just here
to clean up the mess.

00:07:43.661 --> 00:07:45.230
But Archer‐‐

00:07:45.296 --> 00:07:46.700
You're right, though.

00:07:46.767 --> 00:07:49.071
I suppose I did become a hero.

00:07:49.572 --> 00:07:52.210
In fact,
I became a hero of justice.

00:07:52.277 --> 00:07:55.450
The kind Shirou Emiya
always wanted to be.

00:07:55.518 --> 00:07:56.753
[grunts]

00:07:58.222 --> 00:08:01.028
[Saber] A hero of justice?

00:08:01.462 --> 00:08:04.001
Yes, and that's what opened
my eyes

00:08:04.068 --> 00:08:06.573
to the fatal error
of this failed reality.

00:08:07.508 --> 00:08:09.178
The fact of the matter is,

00:08:09.244 --> 00:08:11.282
that man's life is worthless.

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:13.453
[Saber] A life with no value?

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.589
[Archer] None.

00:08:14.656 --> 00:08:16.626
I'm sure you understand.

00:08:16.693 --> 00:08:18.630
You of all people know
what it's like

00:08:18.697 --> 00:08:20.467
to want to change the past.

00:08:20.534 --> 00:08:22.471
Take back the choices
you've made.

00:08:22.839 --> 00:08:25.243
‐ [Shirou] Saber?
‐ What?

00:08:25.644 --> 00:08:27.447
Do you mean to tell me
that you never asked her

00:08:27.515 --> 00:08:28.617
what her wish was?

00:08:29.619 --> 00:08:31.857
Why she wants the Holy Grail
so badly

00:08:31.923 --> 00:08:34.028
that she would submit
to this pointless bloodbath?

00:08:34.461 --> 00:08:35.931
[exhales]

00:08:35.998 --> 00:08:38.069
[Archer] Allow me
to fill you in.

00:08:38.136 --> 00:08:40.641
‐ You see, she's‐‐
‐ [Saber] Enough!

00:08:43.981 --> 00:08:45.016
Shirou.

00:08:49.759 --> 00:08:51.295
I did want the Grail.

00:08:51.696 --> 00:08:53.934
It alone can grant me my wish.

00:08:54.803 --> 00:08:57.140
<i>The chance to undo</i>
<i>a decision I made.</i>

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.650
<i>To undo that mistake.</i>

00:09:19.284 --> 00:09:21.857
<i>To alter the course</i>
<i>that led Britain to ruin.</i>

00:09:22.224 --> 00:09:24.763
<i>I could not die.</i>
<i>Not yet, at least.</i>

00:09:27.735 --> 00:09:30.106
<i>That is why I need</i>
<i>to win the Grail.</i>

00:09:32.845 --> 00:09:35.150
I failed to reach my ideals.

00:09:35.751 --> 00:09:37.855
And I should never
have become king.

00:09:38.657 --> 00:09:40.193
But you are different.

00:09:40.661 --> 00:09:42.598
For you
are Shirou Emiya's ideals.

00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:45.103
You represent the realization.

00:09:45.638 --> 00:09:48.176
Is that what you think I am?

00:09:49.712 --> 00:09:51.248
Indeed,

00:09:51.315 --> 00:09:55.758
I became the so‐called "hero
of justice" I had longed for,

00:09:55.825 --> 00:09:59.498
but all I got in return
was a life of regrets.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.106
<i>[Archer] In life I allied</i>
<i>with the deterrent force.</i>

00:10:03.473 --> 00:10:05.644
<i>In death I became</i>
<i>the deterrent force</i>

00:10:05.711 --> 00:10:07.648
<i>as a guardian of humanity...</i>

00:10:08.382 --> 00:10:11.623
Challenging those who disrupted
<i>the balance of the world.</i>

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:14.361
<i>I did whatever I was ordered</i>
<i>to do.</i>

00:10:14.863 --> 00:10:18.336
<i>I killed and I killed.</i>

00:10:18.402 --> 00:10:20.373
<i>I killed without ceasing.</i>

00:10:21.877 --> 00:10:25.518
<i>I killed until</i>
<i>I finally stopped caring.</i>

00:10:26.152 --> 00:10:29.158
<i>Every life I took meant</i>
<i>thousands more would survive.</i>

00:10:32.164 --> 00:10:35.136
I fought over and over whenever
<i>I was needed.</i>

00:10:41.081 --> 00:10:42.150
<i>Again...</i>

00:10:43.486 --> 00:10:45.089
<i>And again...</i>

00:10:45.658 --> 00:10:47.427
<i>And again.</i>

00:10:47.762 --> 00:10:49.131
<i>Before long,</i>

00:10:49.198 --> 00:10:51.736
<i>I learned that no matter</i>
<i>how many lives I took,</i>

00:10:51.803 --> 00:10:53.540
<i>there would always be more.</i>

00:10:53.607 --> 00:10:56.880
<i>I was not so naive</i>
<i>as to try and achieve a world</i>

00:10:56.947 --> 00:10:58.517
<i>without any fighting.</i>

00:10:58.584 --> 00:11:02.157
What I truly wanted
was a world without tears.

00:11:02.859 --> 00:11:05.163
The kind of world in which
no one I knew ever

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:06.600
had cause to cry.

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.971
And that's when it hit me.

00:11:09.037 --> 00:11:11.910
The dream that Shirou Emiya had
for this world

00:11:11.977 --> 00:11:15.551
was nothing more
than shallow idealism.

00:11:16.185 --> 00:11:17.822
[Saber] How can you say that?

00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:21.061
[Archer] Because it's impossible
to save everyone.

00:11:23.232 --> 00:11:26.338
You might save many,
but you leave the few to die.

00:11:26.405 --> 00:11:27.842
There's no way around it.

00:11:27.909 --> 00:11:29.712
But I don't have
to tell you that,

00:11:29.779 --> 00:11:31.015
do I, Saber?

00:11:32.518 --> 00:11:35.724
I found those whose happiness
was destined to die

00:11:35.791 --> 00:11:38.195
and bestowed that honor
on them instead.

00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:40.935
That's what a hero does.

00:11:41.001 --> 00:11:44.441
The ideal he holds true
is mercy incarnate.

00:11:44.809 --> 00:11:46.947
Isn't that the point,
after all?

00:11:47.013 --> 00:11:49.284
To save as many people
as possible?

00:11:49.351 --> 00:11:50.754
So there you have it.

00:11:50.821 --> 00:11:52.892
I'd kill one to save many,

00:11:52.959 --> 00:11:55.864
just like any hero
of justice would do,

00:11:55.931 --> 00:12:00.273
but even though I said I wanted
to forge a world without tears,

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:03.379
<i>I brought more than my share</i>
<i>of despair and suffering.</i>

00:12:04.248 --> 00:12:05.450
[grunts]

00:12:08.322 --> 00:12:09.926
That is who I am.

00:12:09.993 --> 00:12:12.464
The heroic spirit Emiya.

00:12:13.466 --> 00:12:14.736
Do you see it now?

00:12:14.802 --> 00:12:16.171
Why the world would be so much

00:12:16.238 --> 00:12:18.242
better off without him in it?

00:12:20.413 --> 00:12:21.348
[gasps]

00:12:30.801 --> 00:12:33.874
Now kill yourself,
Shirou Emiya.

00:12:37.515 --> 00:12:39.351
[groaning]

00:12:39.418 --> 00:12:41.957
[Lancer] I thought my master
was bound to the shadows,

00:12:42.023 --> 00:12:44.161
never to show his face.

00:12:44.529 --> 00:12:46.533
[Kirei] I have no such policy.

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.904
But I am a bit worried.

00:12:48.971 --> 00:12:51.342
You're disobeying orders,
Lancer.

00:12:51.408 --> 00:12:54.414
I seem to recall telling you
to terminate Archer.

00:12:54.481 --> 00:12:55.483
[chuckles]

00:12:55.551 --> 00:12:58.155
Yeah, well,
Archer can do away with himself.

00:12:58.657 --> 00:13:01.529
What I wanna know is,
did you put the kid up to this?

00:13:01.596 --> 00:13:04.101
My motives aren't so sinister.

00:13:04.167 --> 00:13:06.673
It's only
a simple business arrangement.

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:08.877
Only one will win
the Holy Grail.

00:13:08.944 --> 00:13:11.315
We came
to a mutual understanding.

00:13:11.382 --> 00:13:16.025
Yeah, something told me I wasn't
gonna be rid of you that easily,

00:13:16.091 --> 00:13:18.195
and now you team up
with someone like Shinji?

00:13:18.262 --> 00:13:19.966
I mean,
what's the point?

00:13:20.033 --> 00:13:22.738
You actually believe
he's perfectly harmless?

00:13:22.805 --> 00:13:24.942
You never change, do you?

00:13:25.009 --> 00:13:27.815
Not even
in a situation like this.

00:13:27.882 --> 00:13:30.453
That you were such
a promising student

00:13:30.521 --> 00:13:32.992
makes this all
the more regrettable.

00:13:33.059 --> 00:13:35.063
Hold on, Kotomine.

00:13:35.129 --> 00:13:38.169
That talk about how you wanted
to rescue your pupil,

00:13:38.235 --> 00:13:40.340
you're saying that was a lie?

00:13:40.406 --> 00:13:41.609
[grunts]

00:13:41.676 --> 00:13:43.479
It certainly was not.

00:13:43.547 --> 00:13:44.949
I've invested a great amount

00:13:45.016 --> 00:13:47.153
of time nurturing
this little pawn.

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:50.426
An undertaking that has required
a decade of deceit,

00:13:50.493 --> 00:13:53.332
so I'm not about to let her
be stripped from me so easily.

00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:56.171
[Kirei] That is why
I entrusted her to you.

00:13:56.238 --> 00:13:58.710
‐ For insurance, you see.
‐ [exhales sharply]

00:13:58.777 --> 00:14:00.146
Counterfeit priest.

00:14:00.213 --> 00:14:02.985
You can play or you can referee,
but you can't do both.

00:14:03.052 --> 00:14:04.722
That is so against the rules.

00:14:04.789 --> 00:14:08.162
And yet you don't seem to be
at all surprised, Rin.

00:14:08.697 --> 00:14:11.335
Perhaps you
were already suspicious of me.

00:14:11.402 --> 00:14:12.805
Of course I was.

00:14:12.872 --> 00:14:14.174
That said,

00:14:14.241 --> 00:14:15.911
it never occurred to me
that I'd been tricked

00:14:15.978 --> 00:14:17.180
from the beginning.

00:14:17.247 --> 00:14:19.384
From the beginning,
you say?

00:14:19.451 --> 00:14:20.888
Yeah, so?

00:14:20.954 --> 00:14:23.059
Well, when you use
a phrase like,

00:14:23.125 --> 00:14:24.461
"from the beginning,"

00:14:24.529 --> 00:14:27.100
I have to wonder if you realize
when that was.

00:14:28.002 --> 00:14:30.206
Wait, what are you...

00:14:30.607 --> 00:14:32.678
It's possible you're referring
to the beginning

00:14:32.745 --> 00:14:34.414
of the current Grail War.

00:14:34.481 --> 00:14:37.454
Or maybe you mean the beginning
of the previous war.

00:14:37.822 --> 00:14:39.124
[Kirei] You'll have
to forgive me.

00:14:39.191 --> 00:14:41.328
I don't suppose
it really matters.

00:14:41.395 --> 00:14:42.330
[gasps]

00:14:46.973 --> 00:14:48.375
[Rin] I get it.

00:14:48.844 --> 00:14:50.581
That's what this is all about.

00:14:50.647 --> 00:14:52.050
You killed my father.

00:14:52.117 --> 00:14:53.754
Of course it was me.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.058
He was my beloved teacher.

00:14:56.559 --> 00:14:59.331
<i>[Kirei] Ambushing him</i>
<i>was child's play.</i>

00:15:01.636 --> 00:15:03.172
[Archer] What's wrong?

00:15:03.239 --> 00:15:05.978
Now that you know what you are,
why hesitate?

00:15:06.044 --> 00:15:07.280
[Saber] Archer.

00:15:07.347 --> 00:15:10.052
I do not think
you betrayed your ideals.

00:15:10.119 --> 00:15:12.090
Could it be that you
have been betrayed

00:15:12.157 --> 00:15:14.729
by the very ideals you meant
to protect?

00:15:15.096 --> 00:15:16.298
If that were not so,

00:15:16.365 --> 00:15:18.570
you'd never consider atoning
for your sins

00:15:18.637 --> 00:15:19.906
by ending your life.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.509
[scoffs]

00:15:21.576 --> 00:15:25.249
[laughing]

00:15:25.316 --> 00:15:27.588
Oh, you can't be serious.

00:15:28.022 --> 00:15:30.761
Atone for my sins?
Really?

00:15:30.828 --> 00:15:32.665
Don't be foolish, Saber.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.002
You're right.

00:15:35.069 --> 00:15:38.242
I have been betrayed before.
Countless times.

00:15:38.309 --> 00:15:41.448
I was always willing
to lay down my life for others.

00:15:41.516 --> 00:15:44.054
No one understands
a man like that.

00:15:44.822 --> 00:15:45.891
In the end,

00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:47.393
I was framed as the mastermind

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:49.832
of the conflict and executed.

00:15:49.899 --> 00:15:52.303
But that can't be!

00:15:52.872 --> 00:15:54.307
<i>[Saber] That is how you died?</i>

00:15:55.042 --> 00:15:56.178
[chuckles]

00:15:56.245 --> 00:15:58.617
So if I had any sins
to speak of,

00:15:58.683 --> 00:16:01.155
I fully atoned for them
in that moment.

00:16:01.221 --> 00:16:03.760
[Archer] I never asked them
for their gratitude.

00:16:03.827 --> 00:16:05.229
I didn't want any.

00:16:05.296 --> 00:16:08.102
Nor did I wish to be lionized
as a hero.

00:16:08.169 --> 00:16:09.539
After all,

00:16:09.605 --> 00:16:12.310
what I really wanted
was for everyone to be happy,

00:16:12.377 --> 00:16:15.784
but even that simple desire
was denied me in life

00:16:15.851 --> 00:16:17.320
as well as death.

00:16:17.387 --> 00:16:19.391
I knew that guardians
were essentially

00:16:19.457 --> 00:16:21.461
automatic defense mechanisms.

00:16:22.363 --> 00:16:24.535
And that those
who become guardians after life

00:16:24.602 --> 00:16:27.340
are removed from the cycle
of life and death.

00:16:27.407 --> 00:16:30.514
They become mere tools
to protect humanity.

00:16:31.148 --> 00:16:33.419
Still, I thought that if‐‐
as a guardian‐‐

00:16:33.485 --> 00:16:35.323
I could save someone
who needed help,

00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:37.126
it would be worth it.

00:16:37.193 --> 00:16:39.030
But I couldn't
have been more wrong!

00:16:39.097 --> 00:16:40.333
<i>[Rin] Bastard!</i>

00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:42.437
I hope you get lost
in the afterlife!

00:16:42.505 --> 00:16:45.109
Even hell would be too good
for you, you monster!

00:16:45.176 --> 00:16:46.579
Same with purgatory!

00:16:46.646 --> 00:16:49.384
You'd probably get passed around
to all the other sickos!

00:16:49.451 --> 00:16:51.188
You're not fit for Heaven,
either!

00:16:51.255 --> 00:16:53.158
They'd never take
a eunuch like you!

00:16:53.225 --> 00:16:55.496
You'd have to sleep outside
on a bed of thorns!

00:16:55.564 --> 00:16:58.637
[gasping]

00:16:58.904 --> 00:16:59.872
[Shinji] Kotomine,

00:16:59.939 --> 00:17:01.074
I hope you haven't forgotten

00:17:01.141 --> 00:17:03.078
that you said I
could have Tohsaka.

00:17:03.479 --> 00:17:05.984
It's not like she would be
much use to you or Archer.

00:17:06.051 --> 00:17:08.657
Oh, no.
I'm not done with her yet.

00:17:09.024 --> 00:17:13.432
[Kirei] Because I require her
to become the Holy Grail for me.

00:17:13.499 --> 00:17:14.669
Huh?

00:17:14.735 --> 00:17:17.340
Once Archer and Saber
are gone from here,

00:17:17.407 --> 00:17:20.948
the time will finally be right,
but until that happens,

00:17:21.014 --> 00:17:23.285
I do not want her
wearing herself out.

00:17:23.352 --> 00:17:25.022
And that means
we should conclude

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:26.458
this business quickly.

00:17:26.526 --> 00:17:29.565
[Kirei] Lancer,
dispose of the trash.

00:17:29.632 --> 00:17:32.136
The vessel has no use
for a heart.

00:17:34.542 --> 00:17:36.713
[Archer] Guardians
do not save humans.

00:17:36.779 --> 00:17:39.719
They only clean up
after humanity's messes.

00:17:39.785 --> 00:17:42.056
The only use for their power

00:17:42.123 --> 00:17:44.695
is to negate
what's already happened

00:17:44.762 --> 00:17:46.265
and sweep away

00:17:46.331 --> 00:17:49.104
the bad energy created
by humans.

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.241
They are butchers bent
on killing anyone

00:17:51.308 --> 00:17:53.279
who threatens humanity
without regard

00:17:53.345 --> 00:17:55.116
for whether they're good
or evil.

00:17:55.617 --> 00:17:57.621
It's almost funny,
isn't it?

00:17:57.688 --> 00:18:00.727
It's no different from when I
was completely powerless.

00:18:01.461 --> 00:18:03.600
[Saber] You wish
to save many lives.

00:18:04.467 --> 00:18:05.436
Did you?

00:18:05.504 --> 00:18:07.206
Throughout your existence,

00:18:07.273 --> 00:18:09.545
did your wish even once come
to fruition?

00:18:10.146 --> 00:18:11.549
[Archer] No.

00:18:11.616 --> 00:18:12.685
Not once.

00:18:12.751 --> 00:18:15.323
I mercilessly disposed
of the very people

00:18:15.389 --> 00:18:17.493
I had dedicated myself to save,

00:18:17.561 --> 00:18:21.301
all because of my stupid ideal
of becoming a hero of justice.

00:18:21.769 --> 00:18:24.140
I'm sick of cleaning up
after humanity,

00:18:24.207 --> 00:18:25.677
but as a heroic spirit,

00:18:25.744 --> 00:18:28.617
I'm cursed to do exactly that
for eternity.

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:31.288
I don't belong
to this existence,

00:18:31.355 --> 00:18:34.562
and I know the only way
to make myself disappear.

00:18:34.629 --> 00:18:37.868
[Saber] If you kill one who
is destined to become a hero,

00:18:37.935 --> 00:18:39.972
then that hero will never
be born.

00:18:40.039 --> 00:18:41.676
Is that what you think?

00:18:41.743 --> 00:18:44.247
[Archer] I've waited patiently
for that opportunity,

00:18:44.314 --> 00:18:47.120
hoping that someday
my chance would come.

00:18:47.588 --> 00:18:49.457
[Saber] It will not work,
Archer.

00:18:49.525 --> 00:18:52.564
You are a guardian.
The die is already cast.

00:18:52.631 --> 00:18:55.169
You are exempt from the bounds
of time.

00:18:55.837 --> 00:18:58.242
Even if you do eliminate
this Shirou,

00:18:58.309 --> 00:19:00.514
you will still not disappear.

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:01.883
Maybe not,

00:19:01.949 --> 00:19:05.456
and yet it's not beyond
the realm of possibility.

00:19:05.524 --> 00:19:07.995
That's why I'll destroy not only
his flesh,

00:19:08.062 --> 00:19:10.433
I will also kill his spirit.

00:19:10.867 --> 00:19:12.070
[Archer] At the very least,

00:19:12.136 --> 00:19:13.807
the hero of justice
is a mistake

00:19:13.873 --> 00:19:16.144
that will never appear
in this world again.

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:19.017
What's the matter, Shirou?

00:19:19.084 --> 00:19:20.721
If my existence offends you,

00:19:20.787 --> 00:19:23.192
kill yourself now
and put an end to it!

00:19:27.233 --> 00:19:28.469
[sword clangs]
[gasps]

00:19:29.404 --> 00:19:30.674
[Saber] Shirou.

00:19:31.509 --> 00:19:33.278
Something wrong, Lancer?

00:19:33.345 --> 00:19:35.483
Your target is just a child.

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:38.188
Killing her
should be quite easy.

00:19:39.224 --> 00:19:40.761
[Lancer] I won't do it.

00:19:40.827 --> 00:19:42.798
I cannot obey this time.

00:19:42.865 --> 00:19:44.835
You won't?

00:19:45.202 --> 00:19:46.739
The only way I'll kill that girl

00:19:46.806 --> 00:19:48.943
is if you use a command seal
on me.

00:19:50.547 --> 00:19:52.518
[scoffs]
Very well.

00:19:52.584 --> 00:19:54.287
You leave me no choice.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.462
[gasps]

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:01.268
I hereby order you
by command seal.

00:20:02.971 --> 00:20:04.675
<i>[Rin] I'm sorry, Emiya.</i>

00:20:05.276 --> 00:20:08.082
<i>Looks like you'll have</i>
<i>to fight the war without me.</i>

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:11.556
Now kill yourself,
Lancer.

00:20:11.622 --> 00:20:15.429
[gasping]

00:20:23.045 --> 00:20:24.982
[gasping]

00:20:30.259 --> 00:20:31.796
[Rin] Lancer!

00:20:31.863 --> 00:20:34.702
[crackling]

00:20:34.769 --> 00:20:35.837
[Shirou] Archer.

00:20:36.539 --> 00:20:38.475
Do you have any regrets?

00:20:38.943 --> 00:20:40.312
[Archer] Of course I do.

00:20:42.283 --> 00:20:44.020
[gasps]

00:20:44.087 --> 00:20:45.657
Well, there you have it.

00:20:46.091 --> 00:20:47.393
We aren't anything alike.

00:20:47.895 --> 00:20:49.230
What?

00:20:51.001 --> 00:20:53.305
'Cause no matter what happens
to me,

00:20:53.372 --> 00:20:55.042
I won't regret a thing.

00:20:55.476 --> 00:20:58.983
That is the reason that I
can never accept you.

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:01.321
[Shirou] If you really are
my ideal,

00:21:01.388 --> 00:21:02.490
then it's up to me to correct

00:21:02.558 --> 00:21:04.394
the mistakes
you tarnished it with

00:21:04.461 --> 00:21:06.364
and start over again.

00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:09.070
That kind of thinking
is where this all began.

00:21:09.137 --> 00:21:10.507
Before long,

00:21:10.574 --> 00:21:13.045
you'll wake up
and find you've become me.

00:21:13.112 --> 00:21:14.180
No.

00:21:14.247 --> 00:21:16.351
No way that's ever gonna happen.

00:21:16.418 --> 00:21:17.487
Maybe not.

00:21:17.554 --> 00:21:19.625
You may yet escape that fate.

00:21:20.092 --> 00:21:21.629
But if you refuse to run,

00:21:21.696 --> 00:21:24.434
I'm afraid you have
no future at all.

00:21:28.075 --> 00:21:29.210
[grunts]

00:21:29.277 --> 00:21:30.514
Archer!

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.183
[Shirou] Saber,
it's okay.

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:33.920
‐ [gasps]
‐ [Shirou] Thank you.

00:21:34.387 --> 00:21:36.491
But I still want you
to stay out of this.

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:42.370
This is my fight,
and I have to finish it.

00:21:43.706 --> 00:21:44.675
Trace...

00:21:45.677 --> 00:21:46.813
On.

00:21:52.691 --> 00:21:55.496
Do you think you can keep up
with my blade works?

00:21:55.564 --> 00:21:58.001
If your precision
is even slightly off,

00:21:58.068 --> 00:22:00.574
remember that it will mean
your death.

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:05.082
