I just didn't feel
like that anymore.

00:09:24.763 --> 00:09:26.298
Yeah, I could tell,

00:09:26.365 --> 00:09:29.238
'cause you didn't change
at all after the Grail War.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:31.743
I think I get it now.

00:09:32.244 --> 00:09:34.148
The Holy Grail War
was definitely

00:09:34.214 --> 00:09:35.718
a major event for me,

00:09:35.785 --> 00:09:37.955
but when I look
at the grand scheme of things,

00:09:38.022 --> 00:09:40.193
it was just one piece
of a bigger puzzle.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.765
[Shirou] A lot has stayed
the same since then,

00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:45.203

of changes, too.

I don't know how much I matured
or anything,

00:09:48.176 --> 00:09:51.248

that battle really was.

I'm starting to think that

00:09:57.494 --> 00:09:58.897
it really wasn't
anything special.

00:09:58.964 --> 00:10:00.467
Not in the slightest.

00:10:00.868 --> 00:10:03.239
[Rin] The Holy Grail War,

00:10:03.306 --> 00:10:04.976
lazy days like today,

00:10:05.043 --> 00:10:07.214
things like that
aren't ever going to change.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.654
You relied on Saber's support,
but when she was alive,

00:10:10.721 --> 00:10:12.859
Saber herself actually relied
on the support

00:10:12.925 --> 00:10:14.796
of the people
that came before her.

00:10:14.863 --> 00:10:17.167
So you see,
we're all connected.

00:10:17.234 --> 00:10:19.438
None of us are here
by our own strength.

00:10:19.506 --> 00:10:21.843
We count on the hard work
of people in the past

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:23.312

00:10:23.379 --> 00:10:26.285
The clock tower is steeped
in ancient traditions.

00:10:26.352 --> 00:10:28.924
That's always on my mind
while I'm studying.

00:10:28.991 --> 00:10:31.696
Like someone is always watching
and judging me.

00:10:31.763 --> 00:10:36.305
It feels like‐‐like they want
to know what I'll contribute.

00:10:36.907 --> 00:10:38.309
[Shirou] I see.

00:10:38.911 --> 00:10:41.215

they'd wanna know.

Besides, that's where he first

[Rin] So Emiya,

00:14:25.864 --> 00:14:28.002

00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:29.572
[Shirou] Track?
No.

00:14:29.639 --> 00:14:31.108
I've always been in archery.

00:14:31.175 --> 00:14:33.079
Never really had time for both.

Oh, I see.

00:14:35.049 --> 00:14:37.955
Sorry, guess my mind
was wandering a little.

00:14:38.355 --> 00:14:40.928
Looking at the sunset
just got me thinking.

00:14:41.295 --> 00:14:44.201
It's just,
time has really flown by.

00:14:44.669 --> 00:14:46.305
The Holy Grail War is over now,

00:14:46.371 --> 00:14:48.275
you signed on as my apprentice,

00:14:48.342 --> 00:14:49.946
and it's only been a month.

00:14:50.146 --> 00:14:51.348
At this rate,

00:14:51.415 --> 00:14:53.486
a year will be over
before you know it.

00:14:53.553 --> 00:14:54.655
And when that happens,

00:14:54.722 --> 00:14:56.659
we'll leave this school
for the last time.

00:14:58.195 --> 00:15:01.001
[Rin] So do you have any plans
for after graduation?

00:15:01.503 --> 00:15:03.874
You gonna follow
in your father's footsteps?

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:05.376
[Shirou] Yeah, probably.

00:15:05.443 --> 00:15:06.746
Why do you ask?

00:15:06.813 --> 00:15:08.115
Curious.

00:15:08.182 --> 00:15:10.119
I'll be going to London
when I leave here.

00:15:10.554 --> 00:15:14.361
I got a letter of recommendation
from the Mage's Association.

00:15:14.428 --> 00:15:16.699
You're going
to the Mage's Association

00:15:16.766 --> 00:15:17.902

00:15:18.603 --> 00:15:19.972
The clock tower place?

00:15:20.039 --> 00:15:22.110
They picked me to be
the representative

00:15:22.177 --> 00:15:23.880
of the Tohsaka family.

00:15:24.381 --> 00:15:27.086
And they said that I'm allowed
to bring an apprentice with me

00:15:27.153 --> 00:15:28.489
if I want to.

00:15:28.924 --> 00:15:30.393

Do you want to go

Ah, dammit.

00:15:39.745 --> 00:15:42.618

taking advantage of me again.

00:15:43.687 --> 00:15:44.722

00:15:44.789 --> 00:15:46.559
Uh, nothing.

00:15:46.626 --> 00:15:50.066
This is a big deal,
so give it to me straight, okay?

00:15:50.701 --> 00:15:53.439
Look me right in the eye
and say you'll come.

00:15:56.679 --> 00:15:59.619
Ah, knock it off.
You already know I will.

00:15:59.685 --> 00:16:00.854
Great.

00:16:00.921 --> 00:16:02.725
I mean,
we work so well together.

00:16:02.791 --> 00:16:04.161
Am I right?

00:16:04.896 --> 00:16:08.335
I promise I won't let up until
I turn you into a proper mage.

00:16:08.402 --> 00:16:10.173
So I sure hope you're ready.

00:16:10.607 --> 00:16:12.410
You're going

but not without its merits.

00:18:22.938 --> 00:18:24.942
[Waver] A hero of justice.

00:18:25.009 --> 00:18:29.150
I fear your dream is too large
for this place to contain.

00:18:36.966 --> 00:18:38.536
[gasping]

00:18:40.006 --> 00:18:41.308
[Shirou] Tohsaka.

00:18:41.375 --> 00:18:43.445
Did we have dinner plans
I forgot about?

00:18:43.913 --> 00:18:45.349
[giggles]

00:18:45.416 --> 00:18:47.453
I was just waiting for you.

00:18:47.521 --> 00:18:48.523
Huh?

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:49.592
So then,

00:18:49.659 --> 00:18:51.663
have you made
a decision about joining?

00:18:51.729 --> 00:18:54.334
Uh, I said no.

00:18:55.504 --> 00:18:56.471
Oh.

00:18:56.839 --> 00:18:59.144
[Shirou] Wait a minute.
You're not angry?

00:18:59.712 --> 00:19:02.083
Well, I can't say
I'm too surprised.

00:19:02.851 --> 00:19:06.425
I guess if you're not going
to join the Mage's Association,

00:19:06.491 --> 00:19:08.930
I've only got three more years
before they throw me out

00:19:08.997 --> 00:19:10.266
on the street.

00:19:10.333 --> 00:19:12.203
But there's no law that says
you have to...

00:19:12.738 --> 00:19:14.140
[chuckles]

00:19:15.811 --> 00:19:17.313
Are you okay with this?

00:19:17.781 --> 00:19:19.719
It's all I've been thinking
about lately.

00:19:20.119 --> 00:19:23.325
I just don't think I'll ever
be able to live any other way.

00:19:23.392 --> 00:19:26.131
Even if I know it's not
the right path for me,

00:19:26.198 --> 00:19:27.901
I can't change now.

00:19:31.408 --> 00:19:33.245
It's just like he said.

00:19:33.312 --> 00:19:35.449
He and I might share
the same fate.

00:19:35.517 --> 00:19:37.220
[Rin] Can't argue
with him there.

00:19:37.286 --> 00:19:38.857
With as many mistakes
as you make,

00:19:38.923 --> 00:19:40.493
I think he's got a point.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.965
You're walking
in the same direction down

00:19:43.032 --> 00:19:44.502
the path he left for you.

00:19:44.668 --> 00:19:45.737
But still,

00:19:45.804 --> 00:19:48.910
how far you can go may be
a lot different from him.

00:19:49.411 --> 00:19:52.518
All that matters
is where you land in the end

00:19:52.584 --> 00:19:54.755
and how far you can go
from there.

00:19:54.822 --> 00:19:58.295
Even if you find yourself
at the same destination someday,

00:19:58.362 --> 00:19:59.965
it doesn't have to be the end.

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:02.538
Just keep moving forward,
and before you know it,

00:20:02.604 --> 00:20:04.909
I know you'll find
what you're looking for.

00:20:04.975 --> 00:20:06.445
Maybe so.

00:20:06.512 --> 00:20:09.084
I hope that's the way
it turns out.

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:13.092
But it's up to me
to make it happen.

00:20:13.158 --> 00:20:14.829
‐ [Rin] Don't worry.
‐ [gasps]

00:20:14.895 --> 00:20:15.931
Think about it.

00:20:15.997 --> 00:20:18.435
You've had the answer all along,
haven't you?

00:20:18.503 --> 00:20:20.239
Wait, are you sure?

00:20:20.306 --> 00:20:21.642
[Shirou] I mean,

00:20:21.709 --> 00:20:24.214
I know how important
the clock tower is to you.

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:26.051
[Rin] Oh, I'll be fine.

00:20:26.118 --> 00:20:28.590
I'll probably settle
down there one of these days.

00:20:28.656 --> 00:20:31.796
For now I've got some things
to work out of my system.

00:20:31.863 --> 00:20:34.267
There's a lot of world left
to experience.

00:20:34.334 --> 00:20:35.570
I see.

00:20:35.637 --> 00:20:37.975
My turn to drag you around
for a change.

00:20:38.041 --> 00:20:39.210
[Rin] Yep.

00:20:39.277 --> 00:20:41.248
But all that's still
a long way off.

00:20:42.918 --> 00:20:44.254
Either way,

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.458
having a good time
and traveling,

00:20:46.526 --> 00:20:48.362
even suffering,

00:20:48.429 --> 00:20:51.736
it all leads
to our happily ever after.

00:20:54.508 --> 00:20:57.948
That's what our future holds.
I know it.

<i>"I don't want</i>

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:01.729
