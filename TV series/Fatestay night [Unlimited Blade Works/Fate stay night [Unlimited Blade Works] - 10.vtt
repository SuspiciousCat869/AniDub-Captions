Respect for Rin compels me

00:04:20.988 --> 00:04:23.661
[Rin] Anyway,
if we want to beat Caster,

00:04:23.727 --> 00:04:25.998
we have to find out where
her master is.

00:04:26.065 --> 00:04:27.334
Fortunately or not,

00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:30.340
Caster's master comes
to this school every day.

00:04:30.908 --> 00:04:33.279
We don't wanna scare him
or put him on guard,

00:04:33.346 --> 00:04:35.618
so let's go ahead
and leave him be for the moment.

00:04:36.018 --> 00:04:39.125
So then we find a way
to identify the master.

00:04:39.191 --> 00:04:41.763
Then we stop him from going
to the Ryuudou Temple.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:42.966
That's the plan.

00:04:43.032 --> 00:04:45.805
Okay, but won't he
just stop coming to school?

00:04:45.872 --> 00:04:48.443
Won't it be too risky after
a big ruckus like this?

00:04:48.511 --> 00:04:50.247
Highly unlikely.

00:04:50.615 --> 00:04:52.351
I doubt
that caster's master still

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:53.854
has that type of free will.

00:04:53.921 --> 00:04:55.357
That's not her style.

00:04:55.423 --> 00:04:57.394
I'm certain the first thing
that she did

00:04:57.461 --> 00:04:59.465
was turn her master into
a puppet.

00:05:00.568 --> 00:05:01.904
That'd make sense.

00:05:02.772 --> 00:05:03.874
In the meantime,

we locate Caster's master.

Caster's lair is Ryuudou Temple.

00:17:09.257 --> 00:17:10.694
Stop being ridiculous.

00:17:10.761 --> 00:17:13.098
I went to your class
to report back to you,

00:17:13.165 --> 00:17:15.604
to tell you about Issei,
but you'd already left.

00:17:15.671 --> 00:17:16.940
What?

00:17:17.006 --> 00:17:19.244
Issei's definitely not a master.

00:17:19.311 --> 00:17:21.315
[Rin] Wait a minute.
So you already checked him out?

00:17:21.381 --> 00:17:23.219
‐ Seriously?
‐ I sure did.

00:17:23.285 --> 00:17:24.855
Issei's in the clear.

00:17:24.922 --> 00:17:27.795
If you choose not to believe me,
I don't really care.

00:17:27.861 --> 00:17:29.732
Huh?
[grunts]

00:17:29.799 --> 00:17:31.335
No, I believe you.

00:17:31.401 --> 00:17:33.907
I know you're not the type
to ever lie to me.

00:17:33.974 --> 00:17:37.247
If you say he's innocent,
then Issei is innocent.

00:17:37.748 --> 00:17:38.783
[exhales]

00:17:39.785 --> 00:17:40.921
But tell me.

00:17:40.988 --> 00:17:42.490
What did you do
to check him out?

00:17:42.558 --> 00:17:45.496
I made him take off his clothes.
What do you think I did?

00:17:45.564 --> 00:17:47.233
[Shirou] I took off his shirt
and checked to see

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:48.937
if he had
any command seals on him.

00:17:49.004 --> 00:17:51.141
[groans]

00:17:51.208 --> 00:17:53.613
All right.
Now why are you here?

00:17:54.114 --> 00:17:55.249
Oh.

00:17:55.684 --> 00:17:58.757
Well, I think I was just worried
about Sakura.

00:17:58.823 --> 00:18:01.094
We're kind of acquaintances.

00:18:01.161 --> 00:18:02.463
From what Fujine says,

00:18:02.531 --> 00:18:04.234
she'll be discharged today.

00:18:04.301 --> 00:18:06.104
She may even be home already.

00:18:07.473 --> 00:18:08.442
Good.

00:18:11.415 --> 00:18:13.085
Hey, wait.
You're leaving?

00:18:13.887 --> 00:18:14.822
Oh.

00:18:15.891 --> 00:18:17.093
[grunts]

00:18:21.769 --> 00:18:22.805
[grunts]

00:18:22.871 --> 00:18:25.677
I have something I'd like
to run by you.

00:18:25.978 --> 00:18:27.480
Okay, what's on your mind?

00:18:29.017 --> 00:18:31.321
Well, uh,
it's just a hypothetical.

00:18:32.156 --> 00:18:33.392
Tell me.

00:18:33.459 --> 00:18:35.396
How do you think a child
would feel if‐‐

00:18:35.463 --> 00:18:37.467
if she were given away
to be adopted?

00:18:38.002 --> 00:18:40.641
Adopted into another family
with no say at all?

00:18:41.174 --> 00:18:42.343
[grunts]

00:18:43.112 --> 00:18:44.047
Emiya?

00:18:44.114 --> 00:18:45.249
[gasps]

00:18:45.316 --> 00:18:48.322
Well, it depends on
the situation.

00:18:49.024 --> 00:18:50.393
If her new home was nice,

00:18:50.459 --> 00:18:52.430
then she'd probably
never complain,

00:18:52.497 --> 00:18:54.902
and if it wasn't nice,
then she would complain.

00:18:56.071 --> 00:18:57.240
I see.

00:18:57.941 --> 00:18:59.177
I guess you're right.

00:18:59.244 --> 00:19:01.749
Why am I even asking such
an obvious question?

00:19:04.321 --> 00:19:05.791
We'll start again tomorrow.

00:19:05.857 --> 00:19:08.462
We need more ideas on how
to find Caster.

00:19:08.897 --> 00:19:10.399
Okay, sounds good.

00:19:16.846 --> 00:19:18.449

00:19:22.691 --> 00:19:24.327
Ah.

00:19:24.729 --> 00:19:27.868
Ah, it's been quite a long time
since you practiced kendo

00:19:27.935 --> 00:19:28.970
in the old dojo.

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:30.607
Wait, a long time?

00:19:30.674 --> 00:19:33.145
Even though he had a fine
sparring partner like you?

00:19:33.212 --> 00:19:35.483
Well, guess it has been a while.

00:19:35.917 --> 00:19:38.656
I think I pretty much stopped
after my dad died.

00:19:38.723 --> 00:19:40.126
It's true!

00:19:40.192 --> 00:19:42.397
You know,
after Kiritsugu died,

00:19:42.463 --> 00:19:44.702
Shirou hardly picked up
his bamboo sword at all.

00:19:44.769 --> 00:19:47.340
You don't know how sad
it made me.

00:19:47.407 --> 00:19:50.212
Fujine, there's no reason
to dredge up the past.

00:19:50.279 --> 00:19:51.649
Oh, fine.

00:19:51.716 --> 00:19:52.684
Oh.

00:19:52.751 --> 00:19:54.722
You have tales
from Shirou's childhood?

00:19:54.789 --> 00:19:56.893
Yeah!
Wanna hear, wanna hear?

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.732
Yes.
I am quite curious.

00:19:59.799 --> 00:20:01.001
Wonderful, then!

00:20:01.068 --> 00:20:04.307
Prepare to be regaled
by big sister Fujine!

00:20:05.476 --> 00:20:08.082
He was so adorable
as a little one.

00:20:08.148 --> 00:20:10.386
He was always so trusting
of everybody

00:20:10.453 --> 00:20:12.123
and if anyone had
a request for him,

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:13.960
he would instantly agree to it.

00:20:14.027 --> 00:20:15.496
‐ [Saber gasps]
‐ However,

00:20:15.564 --> 00:20:17.433
he had a really bad
stubborn streak.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.237
Whenever he set his mind
to something,

00:20:19.304 --> 00:20:20.907
there was just no budging him.

00:20:21.208 --> 00:20:23.880
You could say he was
the polar opposite of Kiritsugu

00:20:23.947 --> 00:20:24.882
in that regard.

00:20:24.949 --> 00:20:26.418
Polar opposite?

00:20:26.886 --> 00:20:29.925
Kiritsugu was the type of person
who was always open.

00:20:29.992 --> 00:20:32.296
He thought that good
and evil were subjective.

00:20:32.363 --> 00:20:34.200
He was one of those
"What will be will be,"

00:20:34.267 --> 00:20:35.604
kind of guys.

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:36.873
[Taiga] However,
if he saw someone

00:20:36.939 --> 00:20:39.512
who was in need,
he would always try to help,

00:20:39.578 --> 00:20:42.350
and little Shirou here
would always try to mimic him.

00:20:42.751 --> 00:20:43.787
[grunts]

00:20:44.154 --> 00:20:46.859
Shirou tended to see the world
in black and white

00:20:46.926 --> 00:20:48.328
much more than Kiritsugu.

00:20:48.395 --> 00:20:50.166
Shirou would even beat up
any bullies

00:20:50.232 --> 00:20:51.903
he saw hanging around town.

00:20:52.336 --> 00:20:54.207
Yep, even in those days,

00:20:54.274 --> 00:20:56.779
Shirou was one
of justice's heroes.

00:20:57.614 --> 00:20:59.885
Why do you want to be
a hero of justice?

00:20:59.952 --> 00:21:00.887
Why?

00:21:00.954 --> 00:21:02.825
That's a tough question
to answer.

00:21:03.258 --> 00:21:04.762
I looked up to them
when I was a kid.

00:21:04.829 --> 00:21:05.597
That's all.

00:21:05.664 --> 00:21:07.266
So you look up to them,

00:21:07.333 --> 00:21:09.572
to those heroes of justice?

00:21:09.638 --> 00:21:11.976
Mm, you could say that.

00:21:12.043 --> 00:21:13.813
All right.
Why is that?

00:21:14.214 --> 00:21:15.584
What do you mean, why?

00:21:15.984 --> 00:21:16.919
Why not?

00:21:17.721 --> 00:21:18.723
Shirou?

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:19.825
[gasps]

00:21:19.892 --> 00:21:20.861
Excuse me.

00:21:20.927 --> 00:21:22.330
I'm going to my room.

What is it?

Why do you want
to be a hero of justice?

00:21:40.734 --> 00:21:43.305
Why be a hero of justice?
Why?

[Shirou] Fine, since you can't,
