Someone'll come if we make
a scene.

00:09:37.688 --> 00:09:39.191
Oh, I'll come up with something.

00:09:39.258 --> 00:09:42.264
My policy is not to miss
the opportunities

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:43.433
in front of me.

00:09:43.499 --> 00:09:44.869
[Rin] Sorry, Emiya,

00:09:44.936 --> 00:09:47.474
but I'm going to deal
with you right here and now.

00:09:47.542 --> 00:09:48.844
And besides,

00:09:48.911 --> 00:09:50.581
I don't think my nerves
could handle it

00:09:50.648 --> 00:09:51.883
if you were
to keep fumbling around

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:53.019
like you did today.

00:09:53.085 --> 00:09:54.989
No, just wait a minute,
dammit!

00:09:55.056 --> 00:09:57.260
The last thing I want
is to get in a fight with you!

00:09:57.327 --> 00:09:58.864
It doesn't matter
if you don't want to fight!

00:09:58.931 --> 00:10:02.505
I do!
Now say your prayers, Shirou!

00:10:02.572 --> 00:10:04.742
[booming]
[grunting]

00:10:05.176 --> 00:10:06.112
[grunts]

00:10:06.178 --> 00:10:07.314
[gasps]

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:08.817
Those are Gandr shots?

00:10:08.884 --> 00:10:11.155
They're different
from what I know.

00:10:11.222 --> 00:10:12.324
Trying to kill me?

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:14.094
[Rin] I thought I made that
perfectly clear!

00:10:14.161 --> 00:10:16.666
[grunts]
Hold it right there!

00:10:17.535 --> 00:10:19.839
[grunting]

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.375
[grunts]

00:10:21.442 --> 00:10:24.047
Would you stop that?
You're gonna hurt somebody!

00:10:24.114 --> 00:10:26.152
If you don't like pain,
then stand still!

00:10:26.218 --> 00:10:28.356
I'll do my best
to put you down quickly!

00:10:28.422 --> 00:10:30.861
You'll die instantly if they hit
a vital spot!

00:10:34.368 --> 00:10:36.773
[grunting]

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.610
That doesn't sound like
a mercy killing to me!

00:10:38.677 --> 00:10:39.946
Shut up!

00:10:40.013 --> 00:10:41.716
Why don't you quit
running around, then?

00:10:41.783 --> 00:10:44.388
[Rin] I'm getting all worked up
because you won't stand still,

00:10:44.454 --> 00:10:46.693
dammit!
[grunts]

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:48.764
[grunts]

00:10:49.431 --> 00:10:51.435
[shouts and groans]

00:10:51.636 --> 00:10:53.005
[both grunting]

00:10:53.072 --> 00:10:54.408
Oh, crap!

00:10:54.474 --> 00:10:55.845
[gasps, grunts]

00:10:56.847 --> 00:10:58.182
[groaning]

00:10:58.249 --> 00:11:01.222
[breathing heavily]

00:11:02.457 --> 00:11:03.527
[grunts]

00:11:03.594 --> 00:11:06.432
[speaking foreign language]

00:11:08.336 --> 00:11:11.275
[gasping]

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:12.879
[grunts]

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.518
Dammit.
A bounded field.

00:11:15.584 --> 00:11:16.887
[grunts]

00:11:18.824 --> 00:11:21.428
[speaking foreign language]

00:11:21.495 --> 00:11:23.199
Trace on!

00:11:25.069 --> 00:11:26.038
[groans]

00:11:27.207 --> 00:11:28.810
[groans]

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:34.889
[groans]

00:11:36.626 --> 00:11:37.929
[gasps]

00:11:37.995 --> 00:11:40.968
[glass shattering]

00:11:41.503 --> 00:11:43.206
She's gotta be out of mana.

00:11:43.272 --> 00:11:44.274
[gasps]

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:49.886
[grunts]

00:11:52.825 --> 00:11:53.961
[gasps]

00:11:54.428 --> 00:11:55.731
[gasps]

00:11:59.606 --> 00:12:01.175
[distant booming]
[gasps]

00:12:03.647 --> 00:12:05.083
[gasps]

00:12:06.051 --> 00:12:07.087
[grunts]

00:12:10.761 --> 00:12:12.765
[booming]
[grunts]

00:12:12.832 --> 00:12:14.134
[giggles]

00:12:14.201 --> 00:12:16.305
You finally came out, Emiya.
Welcome back.

00:12:16.372 --> 00:12:19.812
[breathing heavily]

00:12:19.879 --> 00:12:22.284
Oh, put down whatever
that silly weapon is.

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:24.889
You know you don't have a chance
of winning this.

00:12:24.956 --> 00:12:28.396
Maybe.
We'll never know unless I try.

00:12:28.462 --> 00:12:30.567
Really now?

00:12:30.968 --> 00:12:32.638
This is a final warning to you.

00:12:32.705 --> 00:12:35.811
Put your weapon on the ground.
Show your command seals.

00:12:35.878 --> 00:12:37.314
At the very worst I'll strip

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.017
the nerves right out
of your hand,

00:12:39.084 --> 00:12:41.021
but better to lose that
than your life.

00:12:41.088 --> 00:12:43.259
No way.
I won't give them up.

00:12:43.326 --> 00:12:44.294
To me,

00:12:44.361 --> 00:12:45.564
that's no different
than telling me

00:12:45.631 --> 00:12:47.267
I have to betray Saber.

00:12:47.334 --> 00:12:48.537
I see.

00:12:49.071 --> 00:12:50.473
I'll give you three seconds.

00:12:50.541 --> 00:12:53.780
It's your life that's at stake,
so it's your decision.

00:12:54.682 --> 00:12:55.851
[grunts]

00:12:58.924 --> 00:13:00.460
That's three.

00:13:00.527 --> 00:13:02.163
What'll it be, Emiya?

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:04.034
[distant screaming]
[both gasping]

00:13:04.602 --> 00:13:06.706
[gasps]
Was that a scream?

00:13:06.773 --> 00:13:08.175
I think so.
Yeah.

00:13:08.242 --> 00:13:09.512
‐ [grunts]
‐ Wait a minute!

00:13:09.579 --> 00:13:10.814
Emiya!

00:13:10.881 --> 00:13:14.254
[breathing heavily]

00:13:14.321 --> 00:13:16.358
It looks like
she's just unconscious.

00:13:16.425 --> 00:13:17.728
[breathing deeply]

00:13:17.795 --> 00:13:18.897
[gasps]

00:13:18.964 --> 00:13:20.366
She's not just unconscious!

00:13:20.433 --> 00:13:22.337
Can't you see she's
been drained dry?

00:13:22.404 --> 00:13:24.441
[Shirou] What
are you talking about?

00:13:24.509 --> 00:13:25.844
Her mana.

00:13:25.911 --> 00:13:27.915
Her life force,
to be more precise about it.

00:13:27.982 --> 00:13:29.986
She has hardly any blood left.

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.792
She'll die
if we don't do something.

00:13:32.858 --> 00:13:35.229
She'll die?
Are you kidding me?

00:13:35.296 --> 00:13:36.866
I should be able
to stabilize her

00:13:36.933 --> 00:13:38.169
with the stones I have.

00:13:41.375 --> 00:13:42.177
[gasps]

00:13:42.243 --> 00:13:44.615
‐ [Girl coughing]
‐ [gasps]

00:13:44.682 --> 00:13:45.984
[grunts]

00:13:49.559 --> 00:13:50.794
Oh, crap!

00:13:50.861 --> 00:13:51.763
[booming]
[Shirou] Look out!

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:53.199
[blow lands]
[sounts]

00:13:54.234 --> 00:13:55.604
[gasps]

00:13:55.671 --> 00:13:56.806
Huh?

00:13:56.873 --> 00:13:58.409
W‐‐What is that?

00:13:58.476 --> 00:14:00.881
[groaning]

00:14:02.818 --> 00:14:05.624
Why did you protect me?
[gasps]

00:14:05.691 --> 00:14:07.093
We gotta do something!

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.064
You're bleeding really badly!

00:14:09.131 --> 00:14:10.968
D‐‐Doesn't that hurt?

00:14:11.035 --> 00:14:13.540
[Shirou] Are you kidding?
Of course it hurts.

00:14:16.278 --> 00:14:18.249
Tohsaka, take care of the girl.

00:14:18.315 --> 00:14:19.351
[Rin] What?

00:14:19.418 --> 00:14:21.689
[gasps]

00:14:21.756 --> 00:14:27.233
[Shirou breathing heavily]

00:14:29.438 --> 00:14:30.607
[gasps]

00:14:31.976 --> 00:14:33.145
[gasps]

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:35.149
[blow lands]
[grunts]

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:36.452
Wha‐‐

00:14:39.726 --> 00:14:40.994
It's a servant!

00:14:41.796 --> 00:14:43.399
[gasps]
What the...

00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:44.602
[gasps]

00:14:44.669 --> 00:14:45.938
[grunts]

00:14:48.275 --> 00:14:49.411
[groans]

00:14:49.746 --> 00:14:50.948
What's the matter?

00:14:51.014 --> 00:14:52.785
You aren't going to use
a command seal?

00:14:52.852 --> 00:14:53.987
I'm surprised.

00:14:54.187 --> 00:14:57.060
Sorry, I don't have many
of 'em left.

00:14:57.628 --> 00:14:58.897
[Rider] I see.

00:14:58.964 --> 00:15:01.669
Unlike my own master,
you have courage.

00:15:02.203 --> 00:15:05.042
In that case,
I will take a different tack.

00:15:05.109 --> 00:15:06.345
Young master,

00:15:06.412 --> 00:15:09.251
I will endeavor
to kill you gently.

00:15:10.052 --> 00:15:11.488
Huh?
[weapons clang]

00:15:11.556 --> 00:15:13.927
[grunting]

00:15:13.994 --> 00:15:15.329
[both grunting]

00:15:15.396 --> 00:15:17.935
[blow lands]
[groaning]

00:15:18.002 --> 00:15:19.204
[gasps]

00:15:19.271 --> 00:15:21.509
[gasps]
Not very impressive.

00:15:21.576 --> 00:15:23.547
Compared to the other servants
I've seen,

00:15:23.613 --> 00:15:25.416
you don't pack any punch.

00:15:25.951 --> 00:15:28.022
You're wrong,
and this is why.

00:15:28.355 --> 00:15:31.094
You've been caught by me
and you have been since

00:15:31.161 --> 00:15:32.565
the very beginning.

00:15:32.631 --> 00:15:38.042
[shouting]

00:15:38.109 --> 00:15:40.747
Now then,
what was that you were saying?

00:15:40.814 --> 00:15:43.285
I'm not sure I actually
heard you correctly.

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:45.089
[Rider] What was it?

00:15:45.156 --> 00:15:46.893
Something about me
being inferior

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:48.462
to the other servants?

00:15:48.964 --> 00:15:51.001
No, that won't do.

00:15:52.403 --> 00:15:53.707
[grunts]

00:15:53.773 --> 00:15:55.476
[shouting]

00:15:55.544 --> 00:15:58.215
[Rider] I'll pluck out
those badly‐mistaken eyes

00:15:58.282 --> 00:16:00.687
and then move onto your limbs.

00:16:00.754 --> 00:16:01.856
[groans]

00:16:01.923 --> 00:16:03.425
[booming]

00:16:03.492 --> 00:16:04.494
[gasps]

00:16:05.363 --> 00:16:06.431
[groans]

00:16:08.804 --> 00:16:10.273
[Rin panting]

00:16:10.339 --> 00:16:12.410
Emiya!
Are you okay?

00:16:12.477 --> 00:16:14.181
[groans]

00:16:14.615 --> 00:16:17.353
[Rin] Okay, we have to stop
this bleeding.

00:16:17.688 --> 00:16:18.957
I need a cloth.

00:16:19.024 --> 00:16:20.326
Do you have anything I
can wrap it with?

00:16:20.393 --> 00:16:23.499
[Shirou groans]
I, uh, have a handkerchief.

00:16:23.567 --> 00:16:26.371
Sakura always puts one
in my pocket.

00:16:26.438 --> 00:16:27.240
[gasps]

00:16:27.307 --> 00:16:29.010
I don't have much, either.

00:16:29.077 --> 00:16:30.647
Well, it's better than nothing.

00:16:30.714 --> 00:16:32.350
If I use it with my towel,

00:16:32.417 --> 00:16:34.689
the bleeding can at least
be stopped for a while.

00:16:35.323 --> 00:16:36.593
[groans]

00:16:36.659 --> 00:16:37.628
So then,

00:16:37.695 --> 00:16:39.532
I assume that woman
was a servant?

00:16:39.966 --> 00:16:40.968
Yeah.

00:16:41.034 --> 00:16:42.370
She attacked out of nowhere.

00:16:42.437 --> 00:16:43.507
[groans]

00:16:43.573 --> 00:16:44.374
[Shirou gasps]

00:16:44.441 --> 00:16:46.378
Don't look at me like that.

00:16:46.445 --> 00:16:48.215
I couldn't find out who it was,

00:16:48.282 --> 00:16:49.886
but this means
that there's another master

00:16:49.952 --> 00:16:51.355
at school besides us.

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:54.327
That's right,
and he's finally made his move.

00:16:55.096 --> 00:16:56.265
Okay.

00:16:56.331 --> 00:16:58.102
That should hold
for a little while.

00:16:58.402 --> 00:17:00.774
[Shirou] More importantly,
what happened with that girl?

00:17:00.841 --> 00:17:02.143
She bounced back.

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:04.014
I think she's out
of the woods now.

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:05.449
‐ [Shirou] Good.
‐ [gasps]

00:17:05.517 --> 00:17:07.020
[Shirou grunts]
That's great.

00:17:08.623 --> 00:17:09.792
[grunts]

00:17:11.361 --> 00:17:13.132
[gasps]
Hey, what's with you?

00:17:13.198 --> 00:17:14.835
Don't you give me the stink eye!

00:17:14.902 --> 00:17:16.539
Y‐‐You get this straight!

00:17:16.606 --> 00:17:18.342
I'd never do something
like that servant!

00:17:18.409 --> 00:17:20.814
Listen, I got all that, okay?

00:17:21.315 --> 00:17:23.285
I know you'd never attack me
like her.

00:17:23.787 --> 00:17:26.693
What I want to know is,
is our fight still on?

00:17:26.993 --> 00:17:28.162
Still wanna do it?

00:17:29.264 --> 00:17:31.101
[gasps, sighs]

00:17:32.671 --> 00:17:34.542
Tohsaka?
Well?

00:17:35.744 --> 00:17:37.247
What are you gonna do?

00:17:37.313 --> 00:17:38.717
[Rin] I quit.
[grunts]

00:17:38.783 --> 00:17:40.119
Let's just call it a day.

00:17:40.186 --> 00:17:42.290
Besides, I'm in your debt again.

00:17:42.357 --> 00:17:44.261
Come on.
Let's go.

00:17:44.327 --> 00:17:46.566
Your wound should be treated
right away.

00:17:46.633 --> 00:17:48.937
Please bear with it until
we get to my place.

00:17:49.004 --> 00:17:50.239
What?

00:17:50.607 --> 00:17:51.542
To your place?

00:17:52.076 --> 00:17:53.279
[Shirou] Really?

00:17:58.255 --> 00:17:59.324
[Rin] To put it simply,

00:17:59.391 --> 00:18:01.194
in addition to the two of us,

00:18:01.261 --> 00:18:03.065
there's another master
at school.

00:18:03.132 --> 00:18:04.635
It looks like
he's picking off students

00:18:04.702 --> 00:18:06.806
like that girl over
and over again.

00:18:07.173 --> 00:18:08.710
But why do something like that?

00:18:08.777 --> 00:18:11.348
[Rin] To win the Holy Grail War,
<i>of course.</i>

00:18:11.415 --> 00:18:13.887
<i>His plan is to sacrifice all</i>
<i>the students he can</i>

00:18:13.954 --> 00:18:16.258
<i>in order to strengthen</i>
<i>his own servent.</i>

00:18:16.325 --> 00:18:17.795
Is that guy nuts?

00:18:17.962 --> 00:18:19.297
Don't know,

00:18:19.364 --> 00:18:21.569
but there's already
a bounded field extending around

00:18:21.636 --> 00:18:24.140
the school.
Once it's activated,

00:18:24.207 --> 00:18:26.011
everyone inside
will pretty quickly start

00:18:26.078 --> 00:18:27.848
to grow weak and die.

00:18:27.915 --> 00:18:29.084
[grunts]

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:30.687
‐ [Rin] Emiya?
‐ [grunts]

00:18:30.754 --> 00:18:33.158
[Rin] This may sound strange
coming from me...

00:18:34.127 --> 00:18:36.198
But I think we need a truce.

00:18:37.266 --> 00:18:39.839
You want a truce between you
and me?

00:18:40.339 --> 00:18:41.976
[Rin] I want some time
to find a way to deal

00:18:42.043 --> 00:18:43.580
with this other master first.

00:18:43.947 --> 00:18:44.982
So until then,

00:18:45.049 --> 00:18:46.184
why don't we call a truce

00:18:46.251 --> 00:18:48.122
and track him down together,
you and I?

00:18:48.723 --> 00:18:51.328
What do you say?
I think it's a pretty fair deal.

00:18:51.796 --> 00:18:52.831
Sure.

00:18:52.898 --> 00:18:53.967
It'll be great to get help

00:18:54.034 --> 00:18:55.336
from someone dependable.

00:18:55.403 --> 00:18:57.975
Look, we've just agreed
to a temporary ceasefire.

00:18:58.042 --> 00:18:59.411
That's all.

00:18:59.477 --> 00:19:01.448
It's not like I'm gonna
spend time helping you,

00:19:01.516 --> 00:19:04.254
but I do promise
to always have your back

00:19:04.321 --> 00:19:06.592
as long as you never turn on me.

00:19:06.959 --> 00:19:08.128
That's great.

00:19:08.195 --> 00:19:10.032
You'll be on my side forever,
then.

00:19:10.466 --> 00:19:12.738
‐ Tohsaka, let's do our best.
‐ [grunts]

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:15.343
[gasps]
Well...

00:19:15.744 --> 00:19:17.413
It's only going
to be a short time,

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.317
but try to make yourself useful.

00:19:22.423 --> 00:19:23.626
[Rin] I get it now.

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.897
The reason you're so limited
is that you aren't

00:19:25.964 --> 00:19:27.467
a legitimate magical heir.

00:19:27.534 --> 00:19:29.437
Before he could pass on
his magical crest to you,

00:19:29.505 --> 00:19:31.308
your father passed away.

00:19:31.843 --> 00:19:33.245
I'm not so sure.

00:19:33.646 --> 00:19:35.216
He was always
dead set against me

00:19:35.282 --> 00:19:37.588
even thinking about becoming
a mage.

00:19:37.955 --> 00:19:39.692
Isn't that a bit contradictory?

00:19:40.259 --> 00:19:41.562
Yeah, maybe.

00:19:41.863 --> 00:19:42.831
You know,

00:19:42.898 --> 00:19:44.635
I think the only reason
my dad taught me

00:19:44.702 --> 00:19:46.539
was that I refused to give up.

00:19:47.206 --> 00:19:48.442
[Shirou] In the end,

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:50.714
he only ever taught me
strengthening magic,

00:19:50.781 --> 00:19:52.483
so that's all I can use.

00:19:52.551 --> 00:19:54.889
Hey, hold on!
What's the matter with you?

00:19:54.955 --> 00:19:56.458
Why would you even tell me that?

00:19:57.694 --> 00:19:59.097
What do you mean?

00:19:59.698 --> 00:20:01.502
‐ [Shirou gasps]
‐ Look, Mr. Newbie.

00:20:01.569 --> 00:20:04.608
We might be partners for now,
but we're still enemies.

00:20:04.675 --> 00:20:07.246
A mage must keep his arts
a closely‐held secret.

00:20:07.313 --> 00:20:09.752
What's the point
of hiding all that now?

00:20:09.819 --> 00:20:12.256
My old man always said
that magic isn't something

00:20:12.323 --> 00:20:13.927
you should go out of your way
to hide.

00:20:13.993 --> 00:20:14.962
[grunts]

00:20:16.532 --> 00:20:18.737
You mean he seriously said that?

00:20:18.803 --> 00:20:19.772
Yeah.

00:20:19.839 --> 00:20:21.374
I think he was trying
to tell me not

00:20:21.441 --> 00:20:23.178
to be tied down by rules.

00:20:23.813 --> 00:20:25.784
He told me that
I could always quit

00:20:25.851 --> 00:20:27.186
if I wanted to.

00:20:27.253 --> 00:20:28.355
That's enough!

00:20:28.422 --> 00:20:29.457
As far as I'm concerned,

00:20:29.525 --> 00:20:30.727
your father was no mage!

00:20:30.794 --> 00:20:32.798
I refuse to recognize you
as a mage,

00:20:32.865 --> 00:20:34.434
if he's the one
that trained you!

00:20:34.502 --> 00:20:36.438
Why are you getting mad?

00:20:36.506 --> 00:20:39.310
I know perfectly well that
I can't call myself a mage,

00:20:39.377 --> 00:20:41.649
but my old man
was the real deal.

00:20:42.049 --> 00:20:44.522
[Rin] That's not what I mean,
and I think you know that!

00:20:44.922 --> 00:20:46.324
I'm trying to say...

00:20:48.061 --> 00:20:49.397
[groans]

00:20:51.736 --> 00:20:54.742
Shirou, it's your lack
of training that I'm having

00:20:54.809 --> 00:20:55.844
a problem with.

00:20:56.311 --> 00:20:57.881
[Shirou] What can I do about it?

00:20:57.948 --> 00:20:59.284
My old man died.

00:20:59.652 --> 00:21:03.158
Yes, that is the inherent limit
of a single mage.

00:21:03.593 --> 00:21:05.329
Mages never know
when they're going to die,

00:21:05.396 --> 00:21:06.966
so they leave behind
a magic crest

00:21:07.033 --> 00:21:08.603
for someone to inherit.

00:21:09.003 --> 00:21:10.974
That's why I'm angry
at your father.

00:21:11.041 --> 00:21:13.947
It's unforgivable to me
that he failed to take any steps

00:21:14.013 --> 00:21:15.517
to prepare you for this.

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:19.658
<i>[Rin] Magic is the fruit</i>
<i>of lifetimes of labor</i>

00:21:19.725 --> 00:21:21.596
<i>handed down from parent</i>
<i>to child</i>

00:21:21.662 --> 00:21:23.933
for generation after generation.

00:21:24.835 --> 00:21:27.508

00:21:27.574 --> 00:21:29.612

<i>That is what we were born for,</i>

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.824
<i>and that is what we die for.</i>

00:21:38.997 --> 00:21:42.370
It is the duty of a mage family
to take the human child

00:21:42.436 --> 00:21:44.307
that they gave birth to
and over long years

00:21:44.374 --> 00:21:47.981
of rigorous training turn it
into something else entirely.

00:21:48.716 --> 00:21:51.889
That's why I said your father
was no mage before.

00:21:52.958 --> 00:21:54.494
I think I understand now.

00:21:54.962 --> 00:21:56.699
Your father decided that it
was better to be

00:21:56.766 --> 00:21:58.837
a devoted parent than a mage.
