00:00:11.222 --> 00:00:13.260
It's a little late to check
but how are you?

00:00:13.326 --> 00:00:14.362
Huh?

00:00:14.428 --> 00:00:15.430
Uh...

[whooshing]

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:19.305
[Shirou] I'm fine.

00:00:19.773 --> 00:00:22.211
Honestly, better than I would
have thought.

00:00:22.546 --> 00:00:26.286
I think I could pull off 10
or even 20 projections.

00:00:27.421 --> 00:00:29.793
[Rin] I'm just glad
it actually worked.

00:00:32.197 --> 00:00:33.400
Okay, then.

00:00:34.135 --> 00:00:35.470
Now's our chance.

00:00:39.312 --> 00:00:40.648
Let's go over the plan.

00:00:40.715 --> 00:00:43.420
Shirou and I will sneak into
Ryuudou Temple

00:00:43.486 --> 00:00:45.357
from the rear
and then give the signal.

00:00:45.424 --> 00:00:47.161
Then, Saber,
that's when you storm

00:00:47.228 --> 00:00:49.198
the temple through
the front entrance

00:00:49.265 --> 00:00:51.269
and keep Goldie busy
for a while.

00:00:51.336 --> 00:00:52.672
[Shirou]
While you're doing that,

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.776
we find Shinji and the Grail
and do what we have to

00:00:54.843 --> 00:00:55.945
to shut it down.

00:00:56.012 --> 00:00:57.014
After that,

00:00:57.081 --> 00:00:58.250
the only thing left is for you

00:00:58.316 --> 00:00:59.820
to destroy the Grail itself.

00:01:00.855 --> 00:01:02.224
There's one more thing.

00:01:03.026 --> 00:01:04.028
‐ [Saber] Shirou.
‐ [gasps]

00:01:04.095 --> 00:01:06.132
I must tell you something.

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:07.736
What is it?

00:01:08.905 --> 00:01:10.407
The fact is,

00:01:10.474 --> 00:01:13.413
I can only use my holy sword
one more time.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.282
[gasps]

00:01:14.348 --> 00:01:16.085
She's run out of mana.

00:01:16.152 --> 00:01:17.722
The moment she uses her sword,

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:19.826
she ceases to exist
in this world.

00:01:20.662 --> 00:01:21.597
What?
No!

00:01:21.664 --> 00:01:22.766
Why is that?

00:01:22.832 --> 00:01:23.801
Think about it.

00:01:23.868 --> 00:01:26.540
I'm supplying all the mana
for both of you.

00:01:26.607 --> 00:01:27.876
[gasps]

00:01:27.943 --> 00:01:29.579
But what about Saber?

00:01:29.646 --> 00:01:32.017
How is she supposed
to keep Gilgamesh busy

00:01:32.084 --> 00:01:33.019
without using her sword?

00:01:33.086 --> 00:01:34.388
Shirou.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.326
This was my own decision.

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:39.231
What else can we do?

00:01:39.298 --> 00:01:41.770
This is the only way we can win.

00:01:42.338 --> 00:01:44.676
Saber is pacted as my servant.

00:01:46.145 --> 00:01:48.383
You think I want her
to be sacrificed?

physical form.

Ten years ago!

have been too small for it.

to crack the vessel open

[Rin] I mean Shinji is cracking.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.727

Up at the top,
is that a person?

00:04:16.547 --> 00:04:18.918
[Rin] Yeah, it looks like
the Holy Grail is using

00:04:18.984 --> 00:04:20.721
a human body this time.

00:04:21.422 --> 00:04:23.126
Listen, if we do nothing,

00:04:23.193 --> 00:04:25.665

of the weird hole in space

00:04:35.985 --> 00:04:39.024
So then we've gotta pull
Shinji out of there fast.

00:04:39.091 --> 00:04:40.260
Wait!

00:04:40.327 --> 00:04:42.030
You think you can just walk up
to it?

00:04:42.097 --> 00:04:44.903

will we?

00:04:47.007 --> 00:04:48.644
We have to hurry.

00:04:48.711 --> 00:04:51.315
By now Saber's already fighting
at the front gate.

for indecision.

00:04:53.754 --> 00:04:55.825

what a surprise.

00:04:55.892 --> 00:05:00.400

then who's Saber fighting?

00:05:16.934 --> 00:05:18.303

[Saber] With Caster gone,

00:05:25.483 --> 00:05:27.722
it should be impossible
for you to still be here!

00:05:29.158 --> 00:05:31.395
I am a unique case,
you see.

00:05:31.462 --> 00:05:35.070
I am a false servant summoned
with this location functioning

00:05:35.136 --> 00:05:36.372
as my anchor.

00:05:36.974 --> 00:05:40.146

to appear only at this gate

00:05:40.213 --> 00:05:41.583

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.731
I shall not live through
the night.

00:05:48.797 --> 00:05:52.705

you seem to have been forsaken
by fate.

00:06:01.857 --> 00:06:04.094
I would venture to say that you
were not aware

00:06:04.161 --> 00:06:06.465
that a servant who has yet
to vanish is still

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:08.069
at the main gate.

00:06:08.236 --> 00:06:10.273

Now then,

00:06:13.847 --> 00:06:16.653
simply killing you
would be very dull,

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.857
so I've decided
to grant you both

00:06:18.924 --> 00:06:20.026
a brief reprieve.

00:06:20.093 --> 00:06:22.264

are you talking about?

00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:25.571

if I were the only one

Bearing witness to how
this great work concludes

that you would dare
to question me.

00:06:47.047 --> 00:06:49.886

And therein lies your answer,

This era in which
the common rabble

00:06:56.934 --> 00:07:01.409
have bred to excess
is far crueler than necessary.

00:09:36.485 --> 00:09:37.922
The fact of the matter is,

00:09:37.989 --> 00:09:40.493
I am not even Kojirou Sasaki.

00:09:40.561 --> 00:09:41.797
[gasps]

00:09:41.863 --> 00:09:44.602
You needn't be surprised.

00:09:44.669 --> 00:09:47.073
It's likely
that Kojirou Sasaki existed

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.276
at one point.

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:50.180
[Assassin] And it's likely there
was a warrior

00:09:50.246 --> 00:09:52.852
with a long sword called
Laundry Pole as well.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:57.294
However, these two were not
the same individual.

00:09:57.795 --> 00:10:00.500
Kojirou Sasaki‐‐
who people said acted

00:10:00.568 --> 00:10:03.306
as a foil
to some noble swordsman‐‐

00:10:03.372 --> 00:10:06.078
was merely a fiction found
in folktales.

00:10:06.813 --> 00:10:08.784
A fictional hero?

00:10:08.851 --> 00:10:09.953
<i>[Assassin] Yes.</i>

00:10:10.019 --> 00:10:12.525
Kojirou Sasaki is only a mantle.

00:10:12.592 --> 00:10:14.027
<i>As for myself,</i>

00:10:14.094 --> 00:10:17.200
<i>I was merely the swordsman</i>
<i>best suited to wear it.</i>

00:10:18.604 --> 00:10:20.541
<i>I do not even have a name.</i>

00:10:20.975 --> 00:10:23.814
<i>However, I was able to perform</i>
<i>the techniques</i>

00:10:23.881 --> 00:10:26.418
<i>the records attribute</i>
<i>to Kojirou Sasaki.</i>

00:10:26.485 --> 00:10:30.026
<i>It's the only reason that</i>
<i>a ghost like me was summoned.</i>

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:32.932
So you see,

00:10:32.999 --> 00:10:35.236
there was never any meaning
to this.

00:10:35.671 --> 00:10:37.542
I am an empty,
hollow shell.

00:10:37.608 --> 00:10:40.146
Nothing has meaning for me.

00:10:40.514 --> 00:10:41.750
‐ However‐‐
‐ [gasps]

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.054
[Assassin] If there
were something

00:10:44.121 --> 00:10:46.927
that could possibly give meaning
to my existence...

00:10:49.231 --> 00:10:51.101
It would be this moment.

00:10:51.168 --> 00:10:56.412
That is, if a man who died
in obscurity had such a thing

00:10:56.478 --> 00:10:58.015
as a wish.

00:10:58.482 --> 00:10:59.719

[inhales sharply]

Learn your place, mongrel!

00:11:30.046 --> 00:11:32.952
I'd prefer you didn't spoil
the festivities.

00:11:34.822 --> 00:11:36.760
It's finally happening.

Look up there.

00:12:05.483 --> 00:12:07.822
Would you like
to know what that is?

00:12:08.222 --> 00:12:10.928
[Gilgamesh] The Holy Grail
is drawing in wishes.

00:12:10.995 --> 00:12:13.834
The true nature of you mongrels.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.071
The malevolence of all mankind.

00:12:16.138 --> 00:12:17.173
[gasps]

00:12:20.547 --> 00:12:23.486

<i>bringing forth</i>

00:12:39.519 --> 00:12:42.457
<i>Why do wishes fail</i>
<i>to be granted?</i>

00:12:42.525 --> 00:12:45.263
<i>Because humans</i>
<i>are inherently limited.</i>

00:12:45.764 --> 00:12:49.906
<i>Fairness, peace, happiness</i>
<i>can never be obtained</i>

00:12:49.973 --> 00:12:52.444

00:12:56.285 --> 00:12:57.989
<i>That is why humans constructed</i>
<i>the Holy Grail</i>

00:12:58.055 --> 00:13:00.093
<i>in the first place.</i>

00:13:00.694 --> 00:13:03.466
<i>Not to release your people</i>
<i>from all suffering,</i>

00:13:03.533 --> 00:13:06.506
<i>but rather to subjugate</i>
<i>and conquer them.</i>

00:13:13.553 --> 00:13:16.458
[laughing]

00:13:16.526 --> 00:13:19.364
This is the end result
of that ideal!

00:13:19.431 --> 00:13:22.337
No quality so capable
of bringing change

00:13:22.404 --> 00:13:24.876
is more powerful
than human malevolence!

00:13:25.611 --> 00:13:27.213
That is its fuel,

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.420
and its tool
is self annihilation.

00:13:31.188 --> 00:13:33.960
That is the true nature
of humanity.

00:13:34.027 --> 00:13:37.300
So this wish granter fits
this age perfectly.

00:13:37.367 --> 00:13:40.841
Vastly different in scope
than ten years ago.

00:13:41.342 --> 00:13:44.214
The curses will stream forth
without end.

00:13:45.016 --> 00:13:48.389

You don't even wanna let go

Well, apparently
it got pissed off

00:14:43.265 --> 00:14:44.836
when I yanked its heart out.

It would smack of defeat to take

So be it.

Shut up, Archer.

How the hell am I supposed

00:15:39.077 --> 00:15:40.379
[Shirou] My sword skills

00:15:40.446 --> 00:15:42.651
to get past his Noble Phantasm.

00:15:43.152 --> 00:15:45.757
There's no choice.
Only one thing to do.

00:15:46.325 --> 00:15:48.930
I have to cancel out
his Noble Phantasms

00:15:48.997 --> 00:15:51.268
by smashing them
with exact duplicates.

00:15:52.036 --> 00:15:53.339

You duplicated every one

But no matter how good
they may be,

00:16:36.526 --> 00:16:39.699

For glasswork,
they are remarkably durable.

However, you'll have to copy
a lot faster than that.

This stalemate
is an utterly foolish notion.

[Gilgamesh] If you know
you cannot defeat me,

00:17:10.326 --> 00:17:13.365
then destroying the Holy Grail
is the correct decision.

00:17:14.267 --> 00:17:15.704
<i>But if that's your thinking,</i>

00:17:27.895 --> 00:17:29.331
<i>What hypocrisy.</i>

From this position,

flying backwards.

[Assassin] Yes,

Just as I am the guard

there's a thing that you guard,
