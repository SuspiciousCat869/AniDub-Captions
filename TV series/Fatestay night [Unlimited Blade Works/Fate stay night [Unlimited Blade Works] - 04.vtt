00:13:36.766 --> 00:13:38.202
[shouts]

00:13:40.239 --> 00:13:43.012
[Rin] Those are autonomous types
<i>that pursue on their own.</i>

00:13:43.079 --> 00:13:45.584
<i>Plus they're even generating</i>
<i>mana themselves,</i>

00:13:45.651 --> 00:13:47.521
<i>like some kind of mini mages.</i>

00:13:48.189 --> 00:13:50.426
<i>But high‐performance familiars</i>
<i>like these must</i>

00:13:50.493 --> 00:13:52.565
<i>have some limitation</i>
<i>I can exploit.</i>

00:13:54.267 --> 00:13:55.103
[gasps]

00:13:55.169 --> 00:13:56.539
Gosh, what nimble prey.

00:13:56.606 --> 00:13:59.311
I think I'm going
to add two more just for you.

00:13:59.912 --> 00:14:01.148
Oh, come on!

00:14:02.083 --> 00:14:03.419
Complain later.

00:14:03.486 --> 00:14:05.356
[Rin] If they flank me,
it's all over.

00:14:06.291 --> 00:14:07.460
In which case...

00:14:08.429 --> 00:14:09.766
[gasps]

00:14:09.832 --> 00:14:11.936
[Illyasviel] A frontal assault?

00:14:12.003 --> 00:14:14.575
That's brave but very foolish,
Rin.

00:14:14.642 --> 00:14:15.611
[grunts]

00:14:15.677 --> 00:14:17.347
[breathing heavily]

00:14:17.414 --> 00:14:18.650
[grunts]

00:14:18.717 --> 00:14:20.253
Gandr!

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:24.896
[grunts]

00:14:27.467 --> 00:14:28.436
[gasps]

00:14:28.837 --> 00:14:30.173
Two more to go!

00:14:30.239 --> 00:14:31.375
[gasps]

00:14:32.645 --> 00:14:35.383
[Rin] No way!
The familiar changed its shape?

00:14:36.653 --> 00:14:40.761
So you can fend off Zel,
but you can't block Degen.

00:14:40.828 --> 00:14:42.598
I thought this was going
to be fun.

00:14:42.665 --> 00:14:44.167
Too bad.

00:14:44.869 --> 00:14:46.639
Well, this is the end.

00:14:46.706 --> 00:14:49.979
I believe impalement would suit
a vulgar girl like you.

00:14:50.848 --> 00:14:52.050
[gasps]

00:15:04.542 --> 00:15:06.579
[breathing heavily]

00:15:06.646 --> 00:15:08.617
<i>[Archer] Are you all right,</i>
<i>master?</i>

00:15:08.683 --> 00:15:10.954
Or was my assistance unwelcome?

00:15:11.589 --> 00:15:14.227
Are you kidding?
That was perfect timing.

00:15:14.595 --> 00:15:16.800
To be honest,
my back was against the wall.

00:15:17.267 --> 00:15:19.137
Any idea where Illyasviel went?

00:15:19.204 --> 00:15:20.574
<i>[Archer] My apologies</i>

00:15:20.641 --> 00:15:22.678
<i>but the location</i>
<i>isn't clear enough.</i>

00:15:23.179 --> 00:15:25.082
<i>Although I can sense</i>
<i>my own master,</i>

00:15:25.149 --> 00:15:27.187
<i>I cannot track enemy masters.</i>

00:15:28.022 --> 00:15:29.291
I suppose not.

00:15:29.357 --> 00:15:31.328
Anyway, what a monster she is!

00:15:31.395 --> 00:15:33.132
She's beyond common sense.

00:15:33.199 --> 00:15:35.369
Creating familiars out
of a hair like that?

00:15:35.436 --> 00:15:37.240
<i>[Archer] So it would seem.</i>

00:15:37.675 --> 00:15:40.113
<i>Your decision to defeat</i>
<i>Berserker's master first</i>

00:15:40.179 --> 00:15:41.983
<i>was a good one</i>
<i>but it's not going</i>

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:43.553
<i>to be an easy thing to do.</i>

00:15:44.054 --> 00:15:45.389
<i>And because of that‐‐</i>

00:15:45.456 --> 00:15:48.496
We have no choice
but to count on Saber.

00:15:48.563 --> 00:15:51.335
Stay put and watch
the battlefield from above.

00:15:51.736 --> 00:15:53.573
<i>[Rin] I'm going to go meet up</i>
<i>with Saber.</i>

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:54.842
[Archer] Understood.

00:15:54.909 --> 00:15:57.615
Don't wait until it's too late
to leave the battle.

00:15:57.681 --> 00:15:59.317
<i>[Rin] Yeah, yeah.</i>

00:16:00.119 --> 00:16:01.488
[Archer exhales sharply]

00:16:06.699 --> 00:16:08.770
[breathing heavily]

00:16:08.837 --> 00:16:10.139
[both gasping]

00:16:10.206 --> 00:16:11.743
[both grunting]

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:12.745
Tohsaka!

00:16:12.812 --> 00:16:13.980
Emiya?

00:16:14.749 --> 00:16:15.851
[grunts]

00:16:16.218 --> 00:16:18.155
Don't you "Tohsaka" me!

00:16:18.222 --> 00:16:19.826
[both grunting]

00:16:20.259 --> 00:16:22.263
Can't you see if you've got
no skill to fight,

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:24.067
you're just gonna get
in the way?

00:16:24.134 --> 00:16:25.838
If you die without
accomplishing anything,

00:16:25.904 --> 00:16:27.173
you'll have died for nothing!

00:16:27.541 --> 00:16:30.313
[Shirou] Well, why the hell
are you getting mad over that?

00:16:30.379 --> 00:16:32.217
It's none of your business
if I wanna decide

00:16:32.283 --> 00:16:33.687
I'm gonna die for nothing!

00:16:33.753 --> 00:16:35.423
[Rin] It is my business!

00:16:35.489 --> 00:16:38.262
I told you I was gonna give you
a free pass for today,

00:16:38.329 --> 00:16:40.934
so if you don't go home
it'll be a big pain for me!

00:16:41.001 --> 00:16:43.038
'Cause I can't kill you!

00:16:43.105 --> 00:16:44.742
[gasping]

00:16:44.809 --> 00:16:46.044
[grunts]

00:16:46.111 --> 00:16:47.681
N‐‐Never mind that.

00:16:47.748 --> 00:16:48.984
At least you're still alive.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:50.721
You should run while you can.

00:16:50.787 --> 00:16:52.625
That brat Illyasviel is serious.

00:16:52.691 --> 00:16:54.695
She's determined
to horrifically kill all

00:16:54.762 --> 00:16:56.064
of us right here and now.

00:16:57.968 --> 00:16:59.539
I can't do that.

00:16:59.972 --> 00:17:01.843
Saber's fighting as hard
as she can.

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:04.214
So I'm not about
to leave her to die.

00:17:04.281 --> 00:17:06.819
[Rin] Only real mages get
to talk like that.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.457
You can't offer any experience
or support

00:17:09.525 --> 00:17:11.028
so you'll just die for nothing.

00:17:11.094 --> 00:17:12.698
[Shirou] There has
to be something I can do.

00:17:12.765 --> 00:17:15.571
As long as I have a body,
I can contribute to this fight.

00:17:15.637 --> 00:17:18.008
‐ Now look here‐‐
‐ [Shirou] And besides, Tohsaka.

00:17:18.342 --> 00:17:19.912
Are you going
to make someone do something

00:17:19.979 --> 00:17:21.081
that you can't do for yourself?

00:17:21.148 --> 00:17:22.283
[gasps]

00:17:22.685 --> 00:17:24.321

00:17:32.738 --> 00:17:34.207

00:17:34.274 --> 00:17:36.713
[both panting]

00:17:36.779 --> 00:17:42.156
[snarling]

00:17:42.223 --> 00:17:43.492
[Rin] Very good, Saber.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.363
She confused Berserker
and allowed his blow

00:17:45.429 --> 00:17:46.733
to land on purpose.

00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:48.068
I get it.

00:17:48.135 --> 00:17:50.139
She did that to try
and lure Berserker here.

00:17:50.206 --> 00:17:51.375
[Rin] Right.

00:17:51.441 --> 00:17:53.045
Fighting that thing in a spot

00:17:53.112 --> 00:17:55.449
with no cover
would be utter suicide.

00:17:55.817 --> 00:17:58.823
That's why Saber chose
this particular location.

00:17:59.457 --> 00:18:01.094
As well as
to draw Berserker away

00:18:01.161 --> 00:18:02.463
from you, Emiya.

00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:06.606
Of course she can't expect
any support

00:18:06.673 --> 00:18:08.743
from Archer
in a battle like this.

00:18:09.311 --> 00:18:11.214
But Berserker
is a monster who's capable

00:18:11.281 --> 00:18:13.252
of neutralizing Archer's arrows.

00:18:13.319 --> 00:18:14.922
Support from him would
have been pointless

00:18:14.989 --> 00:18:16.258
no matter what.

00:18:16.693 --> 00:18:17.861
Archer's bow, huh?

00:18:22.203 --> 00:18:24.207
[Saber] We have neither thoughts
to converse

00:18:24.274 --> 00:18:26.445
nor freedom to name ourselves.

00:18:26.879 --> 00:18:29.351
Our intercourse is limited
to blows meant

00:18:29.417 --> 00:18:30.821
to kill each other,

00:18:30.887 --> 00:18:32.323
and so I shall answer you

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:34.494
with a blow containing all
my might.

00:18:34.762 --> 00:18:35.998
Here I come.

00:18:36.566 --> 00:18:39.437
This is where you die,
Berserker!

00:19:12.905 --> 00:19:14.341
Is it all over?

Saber!

00:19:18.115 --> 00:19:19.752

00:19:21.388 --> 00:19:22.323
What, Archer?

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:23.727
[wind blowing]

00:19:23.793 --> 00:19:25.463
<i>[Rin] What do you mean,</i>
<i>I should get clear?</i>

00:19:29.137 --> 00:19:32.678
[Archer] That was magnificent,
but not nearly enough.

00:19:40.627 --> 00:19:41.929
[gasps]

00:19:41.996 --> 00:19:43.432
[Saber] Regeneration?

00:19:43.499 --> 00:19:45.537
No, that is almost
like rolling back time.

00:19:45.604 --> 00:19:47.508
The curse of resurrection.

00:19:47.574 --> 00:19:50.379
A Noble Phantasm
that activates upon his death!

00:19:50.446 --> 00:19:52.016

Shirou, what was it?

00:21:05.496 --> 00:21:07.133
It was Archer's arrow.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.937
Beyond that,
I really don't know.

00:21:09.672 --> 00:21:10.674

00:21:12.511 --> 00:21:14.414
[Illyasviel] I've changed
my mind about you, Rin.

00:21:14.481 --> 00:21:16.686
Your Archer is very impressive.

00:21:17.253 --> 00:21:18.155
That's enough.

00:21:18.222 --> 00:21:19.892
Return to me, Berserker.

00:21:20.459 --> 00:21:21.863
I had hoped to get
the boring stuff out

00:21:21.929 --> 00:21:24.434
of the way first
but under the circumstances,

00:21:24.502 --> 00:21:25.804
my plans changed.

00:21:25.871 --> 00:21:27.641
Wait a minute.
You're leaving?

00:21:27.708 --> 00:21:30.312
<i>[Illyasviel] Yes.</i>
<i>I changed my mind.</i>

00:21:30.847 --> 00:21:33.920
<i>I don't care about Saber</i>

<i>in your Archer.</i>

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:39.063
So I'm going to let you live
a little while longer.

00:21:39.497 --> 00:21:41.034
Okay, then.
Bye‐bye.

00:21:41.101 --> 00:21:44.207
Let's play again sometime,

Thank you for coming
