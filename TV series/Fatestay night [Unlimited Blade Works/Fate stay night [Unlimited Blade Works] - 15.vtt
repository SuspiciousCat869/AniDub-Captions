<i>[singing voice] Aniplex.</i>

00:00:09.085 --> 00:00:10.655
[Shirou] Ow, ow, ow!

00:00:10.722 --> 00:00:13.426
‐ [Rin] Now just hold still.
‐ [Shirou groans]

00:00:13.828 --> 00:00:15.297
[quietly groans]

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:17.702
There.
We're done.

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:18.771
Thank you.

00:00:21.075 --> 00:00:22.144
[Shirou] What are you doing?

00:00:22.211 --> 00:00:23.614
I thought I'd make some dinner.

00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:26.185
What?
With all of this going on?

00:00:26.252 --> 00:00:27.656
Yeah, why not?

00:00:27.722 --> 00:00:29.893
We can't come up
with any decent ideas

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.264
on an empty stomach, right?

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.803
<i>[Shirou] I've done a lot</i>
<i>of thinking...</i>

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.709
<i>About why I joined</i>
<i>in the Grail War.</i>

00:00:38.376 --> 00:00:40.414
<i>About what I really wanted</i>
<i>to achieve.</i>

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:43.086
Hmm.
And so?

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.794
At first it was because I
was dragged into it.

00:00:47.762 --> 00:00:49.098
But that's not really why.

00:00:49.165 --> 00:00:50.768
[Shirou] I've always
admired heroes

00:00:50.835 --> 00:00:54.543
of justice so I need
to protect everyone.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.714
Even if I'm not a master,

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.483
or if Saber is gone,

00:00:58.551 --> 00:01:00.788
I'm going out
to fight all the same.

00:01:01.256 --> 00:01:03.360
Okay.
I see.

00:01:03.426 --> 00:01:06.132
[Shirou] Hey, I'm talkin'
serious stuff here.

00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:07.736
You think you might pay
a little attention?

00:01:07.802 --> 00:01:09.138
Heard every word.

00:01:09.573 --> 00:01:11.944
You don't have a problem
with putting yourself in danger

00:01:12.011 --> 00:01:13.981
but you simply can't bear it
when other people do

00:01:14.048 --> 00:01:15.317
the same thing,

00:01:15.384 --> 00:01:17.656
and so you go out to fight

00:01:17.722 --> 00:01:19.726
even if you're
not strong enough.

00:01:19.793 --> 00:01:22.799
Uh, that pretty much covers it,
I guess.

00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:23.968
[Rin] Then what's the deal?

00:01:24.035 --> 00:01:26.707
You look like a squirrel
that ate a rock by mistake.

00:01:26.774 --> 00:01:30.013
Well, I just didn't think
that you'd be okay with it.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.984
Oh, I don't like the idea.

00:01:32.051 --> 00:01:35.257
However, after you swooped in
and saved me like that,

00:01:35.324 --> 00:01:37.494
I really can't object to it,
can I?

00:01:38.096 --> 00:01:42.204
And also there's the fact that
you'd still fight regardless

00:01:42.271 --> 00:01:43.608
of how I felt about it.

00:01:43.674 --> 00:01:46.714
So then that would mean
that in all of this,

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:47.882
we're still partners?

00:01:47.949 --> 00:01:49.418
[Rin] I suppose.

00:01:50.053 --> 00:01:52.291
Anyway, I couldn't sleep knowing
I'd turned you loose

00:01:52.358 --> 00:01:53.928
to do everything by yourself.

00:01:54.295 --> 00:01:56.667
Besides,
to put it in simple terms,

00:01:56.734 --> 00:01:58.571
it's not like I hate you
or anything.

00:01:58.638 --> 00:02:00.173
I mean,
as a partner,

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.944
and your cooking's pretty good.

00:02:02.378 --> 00:02:04.482
So that's how I feel about it,

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.687
and you're still okay
with us work together.

00:02:06.754 --> 00:02:07.689
Is that right?

00:02:08.691 --> 00:02:09.660
[grunts]

00:02:09.726 --> 00:02:12.064
I need a refill.

[Rin] For the moment,
our enemy is Caster.

00:03:49.793 --> 00:03:52.498
She's protected by
the close combat fighter Kuzuki

00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:54.803
and Archer,
who's on her side now.

00:03:55.337 --> 00:03:56.707
Soon enough she's going

00:03:56.774 --> 00:03:58.711

too.

00:03:58.778 --> 00:03:59.746
[Shirou] Yeah.

00:03:59.813 --> 00:04:01.683
Once she's got full control
of her,

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.554
we're not gonna stand much
of a chance.

00:04:03.621 --> 00:04:06.827
You're right about that.
You got any good ideas?

00:04:07.562 --> 00:04:09.398
Here's one.
Now, don't get mad.

00:04:09.933 --> 00:04:12.906
What do you think about trying
to work with some other masters?

00:04:14.475 --> 00:04:15.645
I"m not mad.

00:04:15.711 --> 00:04:17.414
I have to admit I
was actually thinking

00:04:17.481 --> 00:04:18.818
the same thing.

00:04:18.884 --> 00:04:21.222
We still have no idea
who Lancer's master is,

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:22.692
so that's out,

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:25.698
but we just might have
a good shot with Illyasviel.

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:28.537
[Shirou] Well, the first problem
is finding her.

00:04:28.604 --> 00:04:31.209
[Rin] I've got a pretty
good idea where to look.

00:04:31.275 --> 00:04:33.246
‐ Hmm?
‐ [Rin] A long time ago,

00:04:33.313 --> 00:04:35.083
my father told me something‐‐

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.856
that there's an estate way out
in the forest where

00:04:37.922 --> 00:04:39.258
the Einzberns live.

00:04:50.213 --> 00:04:52.484
[Caster] Why does it elude me?

00:04:52.552 --> 00:04:55.357
[Kirei] There is no
Holy Grail here.

00:04:55.423 --> 00:04:56.527
[Caster] Not true.

00:04:56.593 --> 00:04:58.531
He obviously lied to me.

00:04:58.597 --> 00:05:00.902
The overseer of the Grail War
would never allow

00:05:00.968 --> 00:05:02.972
the catalyst that
is his trump card out

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:04.441
of his sight.

00:05:05.511 --> 00:05:07.247

[Atrum] My family is fairly new
<i>to the mage's association.</i>

00:05:16.032 --> 00:05:19.840
I'm fighting in this Grail War
to win us prestige and glory.

00:05:19.906 --> 00:05:21.877
El‐Melloi
didn't take it seriously

00:05:21.944 --> 00:05:24.114
in the last one,
but I'm different.

00:05:24.181 --> 00:05:25.885
I plan to win this one.

00:05:25.952 --> 00:05:26.920
For one thing,

00:05:26.987 --> 00:05:29.291
I've invested a great deal
of capital.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.064
[Atrum] Do you think that
a purchase title

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:33.734
will tarnish any accomplishment?

00:05:33.801 --> 00:05:35.070
Not at all.

00:05:35.136 --> 00:05:38.009
One should always make use
of all the tools available.

00:05:38.076 --> 00:05:40.413
[Caster] If you're using wealth
as a weapon,

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.785
I expect there's
a strategy behind it.

00:05:42.852 --> 00:05:43.954
[scoffs]

00:05:44.021 --> 00:05:45.691
Don't get the wrong idea.

00:05:45.758 --> 00:05:48.531
I am fully prepared
to overwhelm the other masters

00:05:48.597 --> 00:05:50.233
with my mage ability.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.072
Come.
Allow me to demonstrate.

00:05:53.874 --> 00:05:55.277
[gasps]

00:05:55.343 --> 00:05:57.347
[Caster] I, uh, gather, then,

00:05:57.414 --> 00:05:59.586
that this would be
your alchemy workshop?

00:05:59.653 --> 00:06:01.422
A family business.

00:06:01.489 --> 00:06:03.393
A magic system
that generates mana

00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:04.930
using exchange.

00:06:04.996 --> 00:06:06.867
It's a primitive curse

00:06:06.934 --> 00:06:08.971
that relies on human sacrifice.

00:06:09.038 --> 00:06:12.177
This workshop was designed
to modernize that system

00:06:12.244 --> 00:06:14.081
and make it much more efficient.

00:06:14.148 --> 00:06:16.252
Here, allow me to show you.

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:17.722
[beeping]

00:06:21.362 --> 00:06:23.199
It works best when
the raw materials

00:06:23.266 --> 00:06:24.603
are still fresh.

00:06:39.164 --> 00:06:40.635
[whooshing]

00:06:48.383 --> 00:06:49.653
What do you think?

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:51.690
It normally takes a month
to create this

00:06:51.757 --> 00:06:53.560
but I can do it in an instant.

00:06:53.627 --> 00:06:56.833
Oh, and please don't worry about
the raw materials.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.572
[Atrum] I won't procure them
in Fuyuki.

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:01.075
I always make sure to get them
from another‐‐

00:07:01.142 --> 00:07:03.012
[Caster] This
is wildly inefficient.

00:07:03.079 --> 00:07:06.252
Wasting all these lives
for such puny crystals.

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:08.423
Work of a third rate mage.

00:07:09.224 --> 00:07:10.160
[booming]

00:07:10.226 --> 00:07:13.232
[gasping]

00:07:13.667 --> 00:07:15.605
[Atrum] What the hell
did you just do?

00:07:15.671 --> 00:07:19.078
How can you create mana
from an empty kiln?

00:07:19.144 --> 00:07:20.615
[Caster] What do you mean?

00:07:21.182 --> 00:07:24.623
Oh, so to the eyes
of you modern mages,

00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:27.060
this vessel appears
to be empty?

00:07:27.127 --> 00:07:30.000
Your method of generating mana
must be one step‐‐

00:07:30.066 --> 00:07:33.172
no, more‐‐
a dimension lower than mine.

00:07:33.239 --> 00:07:34.709
W‐‐What?

00:07:34.776 --> 00:07:36.445
What about the incantation?

00:07:36.513 --> 00:07:39.251
Countless hours designing
this workshop

00:07:39.318 --> 00:07:42.324
just to get around that aspect
of mana creation.

00:07:42.391 --> 00:07:43.794
The incantation alone,

00:07:43.861 --> 00:07:46.465
that takes at least three days
and nights.

00:07:46.533 --> 00:07:49.271
[Caster] But I have no need
of incantations.

00:07:49.338 --> 00:07:53.279
Magic is simply a power
that responds to my command.

00:07:53.346 --> 00:07:54.716
[Atrum shudders]

00:07:54.783 --> 00:07:56.920
Please forgive my bluntness,

00:07:56.987 --> 00:07:59.224
but I strongly urge
that this workshop

00:07:59.291 --> 00:08:00.561
be shut down.

00:08:00.628 --> 00:08:03.600
'Caster] It is unwise
to waste lives this way.

00:08:04.034 --> 00:08:05.871
As a mage of great proficiency,

00:08:05.938 --> 00:08:09.011
I abhor
an unprofessional workshop.

00:08:09.546 --> 00:08:11.750
Ah, that is very good to know.

00:08:11.817 --> 00:08:15.223
Apparently I didn't quite grasp
what a servant was.

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:17.094
I order you by command seal.

00:08:18.329 --> 00:08:21.068
[Atrum] Do not use
your noble phantasm on me.

00:08:21.135 --> 00:08:23.540
I have no desire to be stabbed
in the back

00:08:23.607 --> 00:08:25.511
by a treacherous witch.

00:08:36.365 --> 00:08:37.769
[Caster] A witch.

00:08:37.835 --> 00:08:39.906
He called me a witch.

00:08:40.407 --> 00:08:43.547
Everyone of them calls me
a witch.

00:08:43.614 --> 00:08:44.749
[inhales sharply]

00:08:47.522 --> 00:08:50.561
[Kirei] Are you telling me
that you can't control Caster?

00:08:51.262 --> 00:08:53.366
It's not a question
of using her,

00:08:53.433 --> 00:08:54.969
but of trusting her.

00:08:55.036 --> 00:08:58.109
Her sense of values
is far different than ours.

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:02.117
She's able to make magic with
the simple wave of her hand.

00:09:02.585 --> 00:09:05.123
To her human life
has no more value

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:06.459
than a paper scrap.

00:09:06.526 --> 00:09:09.699
[Atrum] She killed a romantic
rival by burning her alive

00:09:09.766 --> 00:09:11.001
in her own castle.

00:09:11.068 --> 00:09:13.039
It would be crazy to trust her.

00:09:13.106 --> 00:09:14.609
I see your point.

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:17.214
[Kirei] If that is how
you interpret the stories

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.617
of Princess Medea...

00:09:19.084 --> 00:09:21.723
It is my job to accommodate
the masters' wishes

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:23.159
as best I can.

00:09:23.827 --> 00:09:25.330
And all the more so,

00:09:25.396 --> 00:09:28.035
since you have the backing
of the Mage's Association.

00:09:28.537 --> 00:09:31.041
There are five masters who
are currently selected

00:09:31.108 --> 00:09:32.043
by the Grail.

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:34.949
For now,
two slots remain open.

00:09:39.759 --> 00:09:41.663
I hoped that you would say that.

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:44.134
It would be possible for me
to make a new pact

00:09:44.201 --> 00:09:45.805
with a different servant,
then?

00:09:45.871 --> 00:09:49.378
It has never been done before
but it is possible.

00:09:49.445 --> 00:09:51.248
However, before that...

00:09:51.683 --> 00:09:53.219
Something will need
to be done about

00:09:53.286 --> 00:09:55.758
the servant with whom
you currently have a pact.

00:09:55.825 --> 00:09:58.329
Regardless
of her magical ability,

00:09:58.396 --> 00:10:01.770
she's nothing but a vixen with
a keen talent for deception.

00:10:01.837 --> 00:10:04.007
I've already laid
the groundwork.

00:10:04.074 --> 00:10:07.748
But better safe than sorry,
Father Kotomine.

00:10:07.815 --> 00:10:10.688
I'd like you to give this
to Lancer's master.

00:10:10.754 --> 00:10:14.294
I think it little enough
to do for a fellow member

00:10:14.361 --> 00:10:15.931
of the Mage's Association.

00:10:18.804 --> 00:10:20.173
And this is?

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.845
[Atrum] Oh,
just a contract assigning

00:10:22.912 --> 00:10:25.283
the right to dispose of Caster.

00:10:25.851 --> 00:10:26.920
If he accepts,

00:10:26.987 --> 00:10:28.624
I'll be rid
of Caster without having

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:31.162
to waste a command seal.
[door creaks open]

00:10:31.663 --> 00:10:33.534
[door clangs shut]

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.103
[scoffs]

00:10:35.771 --> 00:10:38.276
Give this to Lancer's master,
you say?

00:10:39.111 --> 00:10:40.748
[elevator dings]

00:10:43.486 --> 00:10:44.756
[gasps]

00:10:46.125 --> 00:10:48.129
[Atrum] What the hell
did you do?

00:10:48.196 --> 00:10:49.632
[Caster] I thought
it would be best

00:10:49.699 --> 00:10:52.939
to dismantle your workshop
before I take you

00:10:53.005 --> 00:10:56.078
to a more suitably
fortified location.

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.286
Dismantle, eh?

00:11:00.353 --> 00:11:02.090
And my supplies?

00:11:02.157 --> 00:11:05.396
I know I had around 50
of them still in stock.

00:11:05.998 --> 00:11:08.670
They were unnecessary
so I released them.

00:11:09.238 --> 00:11:10.508
Did you, now?

00:11:10.574 --> 00:11:11.776
So tell me.

00:11:11.843 --> 00:11:13.847
What's this more
suitable location?

00:11:14.582 --> 00:11:16.686
The heart of this ritual.

00:11:16.753 --> 00:11:19.091
The place where
the greater Grail rests.

00:11:19.157 --> 00:11:22.264
I have found a natural fortress
to keep you safe

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:23.567
from other servants.

00:11:23.634 --> 00:11:27.708
You have but to do as I say
and I shall take you to it,

00:11:27.775 --> 00:11:29.011
master.

00:11:29.979 --> 00:11:31.983
That's not necessary,

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:34.556
because you
are no longer needed.

00:11:35.123 --> 00:11:38.697
By this command seal,
kill yourself, Caster.

00:11:42.237 --> 00:11:43.439
[gasps]

00:11:43.774 --> 00:11:45.043
[Atrum] What the hell's
the problem?

00:11:45.109 --> 00:11:47.147
‐ Does it take more than one?
‐ [giggling]

00:11:47.214 --> 00:11:50.053
[Atrum] By command seal,
I order you!

00:11:50.119 --> 00:11:52.390
Terminate yourself, Caster!

00:11:53.827 --> 00:11:57.467
[laughing]

00:11:57.535 --> 00:11:59.471
What a foolish master you are.

00:11:59.539 --> 00:12:03.279
Have you forgotten the name
of my Noble Phantasm?

00:12:03.647 --> 00:12:05.216
[Atrum] Rule Breaker!

00:12:05.283 --> 00:12:08.256
But I used a command seal
forbidding you to use it!

00:12:08.322 --> 00:12:12.430
Yes, but only against you,
so instead,

00:12:12.497 --> 00:12:16.305
I used it on myself in order
to undo our little pact.

00:12:16.372 --> 00:12:17.775
[gasps]

00:12:17.842 --> 00:12:19.411
I‐‐Impossible!

00:12:19.478 --> 00:12:20.781
To you servants,

00:12:20.848 --> 00:12:23.754
that's tantamount
to committing suicide!

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:26.660
You won't be able to maintain
your physical form anymore!

00:12:26.726 --> 00:12:28.931
Perhaps,
and what of that?

00:12:29.398 --> 00:12:31.603
You are on the verge
of losing your life,

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:33.306
so why should that concern you?

00:12:34.542 --> 00:12:37.380
[Atrum shouting]

00:12:39.852 --> 00:12:41.255
[lighter flicks]

00:12:41.856 --> 00:12:42.858
[shouts]

00:12:42.925 --> 00:12:44.862
[shouting]

00:12:44.929 --> 00:12:46.599
[panting]
What is this?

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.202
What's going on?

00:12:48.269 --> 00:12:50.139
I refuse to go out like this!

00:12:50.206 --> 00:12:53.179
[gasping]

00:12:54.281 --> 00:12:56.786
The Grail War
hasn't even begun yet!

00:12:56.853 --> 00:12:58.690
I haven't fought
a single battle!

00:12:58.757 --> 00:13:00.527
Not like this!

00:13:00.594 --> 00:13:03.734
[panting]

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.940
[grunting]

00:13:07.608 --> 00:13:13.486
[panting]

00:13:17.662 --> 00:13:18.997
[Caster] Yes.

00:13:19.064 --> 00:13:21.770
Perfect end for a man
who celebrated victory

00:13:21.836 --> 00:13:24.241
before he ever started.

00:13:24.742 --> 00:13:28.249
You treacherous,
evil witch.

00:13:29.519 --> 00:13:30.486
[gasps]

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:35.129
I feel hot.

00:13:41.543 --> 00:13:42.578
[gasps]

00:13:43.714 --> 00:13:45.016
[elevator dings]
[gasps]

00:13:47.521 --> 00:13:48.557
[exhales sharply]

00:13:48.623 --> 00:13:49.592
Hmm.

00:13:49.659 --> 00:13:50.861
[grunts]

00:13:50.928 --> 00:13:52.330
[exhales sharply]

00:13:52.965 --> 00:13:55.537
[rain pattering]

00:13:55.604 --> 00:14:00.279
[laughing]

00:14:00.346 --> 00:14:03.687
So in the end I will die
like this again?

00:14:04.321 --> 00:14:06.593
Passed around from hand
to hand,

00:14:06.659 --> 00:14:08.162
exploited,

00:14:08.229 --> 00:14:10.701
reviled as a traitorous witch?

00:14:10.768 --> 00:14:13.707
All I wanted‐‐
all I wished...

00:14:14.374 --> 00:14:18.015
[Caster] Was to return
to my homeland once more.

00:14:21.321 --> 00:14:22.290
Huh?

00:14:26.465 --> 00:14:28.235
[Souichirou] What has happened
to you?

00:14:31.475 --> 00:14:33.814
<i>[Caster] You are willing</i>
<i>to believe such a story?</i>

00:14:34.281 --> 00:14:35.851
<i>[Souichirou] I can't think</i>
<i>of a purpose served</i>

00:14:35.918 --> 00:14:37.621
<i>by your lying to me.</i>

00:14:37.688 --> 00:14:38.990
Is there one?

00:14:39.057 --> 00:14:41.529
A reason why you would wish
to deceive me?

00:14:41.596 --> 00:14:44.167
Rather you are the one
with no reason

00:14:44.234 --> 00:14:46.639
to help some
blood‐covered stranger.

00:14:47.073 --> 00:14:48.543
[Souichirou] Rest here tonight.

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:51.816
We will speak in the morning so
that I may learn more about you.

00:14:51.883 --> 00:14:53.385
[gasps]

00:14:54.421 --> 00:14:55.791
[Souichirou]
Have you calmed down?

00:14:56.258 --> 00:14:57.895
If you have,
we should begin.

00:14:57.962 --> 00:15:00.667
You mean you were willing?

00:15:01.301 --> 00:15:04.509
You said that for you
to survive a vessel is needed.

00:15:05.076 --> 00:15:06.813
If I were to become your master,

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.917
that would be
the opportunity you need.

00:15:08.984 --> 00:15:10.654
Or am I wrong?

00:15:12.257 --> 00:15:14.595
Just a while longer
and the Holy Grail

00:15:14.662 --> 00:15:16.131
will be in my hand.

00:15:19.137 --> 00:15:22.277
[birds chirping]

00:15:30.126 --> 00:15:31.763
[Rin] I guess we'll have
to pin our hopes

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:33.432
on Illyasviel.

00:15:33.499 --> 00:15:37.107
Berserker is not exactly what
you'd call a big fan of Caster.

00:15:37.173 --> 00:15:40.747
Is there some connection
between Caster and Berserker?

00:15:40.814 --> 00:15:42.283
[Rin] Yes, Archer told me.

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:45.323
He said Berserker's
true identity is Hercules.

00:15:45.891 --> 00:15:49.397
If Caster really is the great
and powerful witch Medea,

00:15:49.464 --> 00:15:51.769
then they would have started
when they met on the Argo.

00:15:51.836 --> 00:15:55.276
Kinda like how Kirei sets
me off by just breathing.

00:15:55.343 --> 00:15:59.050
Everybody has someone that just
rubs them the wrong way.

00:16:00.086 --> 00:16:01.288
[gasps]

00:16:01.656 --> 00:16:04.461
Shirou, would you mind walking
out ahead a little bit?

00:16:04.529 --> 00:16:06.031
Yeah, I guess so.

00:16:06.733 --> 00:16:07.735
[sizzling]
[shouts]

00:16:07.802 --> 00:16:08.703
What was that?

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:09.939
I knew it.

00:16:10.006 --> 00:16:11.241
Looks like the Einzberns have

00:16:11.308 --> 00:16:13.179
the whole forest
under surveillance.

00:16:13.245 --> 00:16:15.249
[Shirou] If that's so
it means we just set off

00:16:15.316 --> 00:16:16.953
their burglar alarm.

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:18.657
I don't think it's really
a problem.

00:16:18.723 --> 00:16:20.794
We didn't come here
to launch an attack.

00:16:20.861 --> 00:16:22.263
Just to talk to her.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:24.167
[Rin] So this way she'll know
we don't intend

00:16:24.234 --> 00:16:25.403
to start anything.

00:16:25.571 --> 00:16:26.673
I get it.

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.877
Well, be careful, okay?

00:16:28.944 --> 00:16:30.814
It's got a bit
of a bite to it.

00:16:30.881 --> 00:16:32.083
Don't worry.
I got it.

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:33.587
[sparks]
[screams]

00:16:33.653 --> 00:16:34.689
[grunts]

00:16:34.989 --> 00:16:36.291
[Shirou] Uh...

00:16:36.693 --> 00:16:38.028
[Rin groans]

00:16:38.095 --> 00:16:40.433
That little twerp's
pissed me off now!

00:16:40.499 --> 00:16:42.370
<i>I heard you laugh just now!</i>

00:16:42.437 --> 00:16:44.174
<i>I know I heard you laughing!</i>

00:16:44.241 --> 00:16:45.844
[Illyasviel laughs]

00:16:45.911 --> 00:16:48.148
Got her good
with my little trap.

00:16:48.215 --> 00:16:50.521
Rin is just so much fun
to play with.

00:16:50.587 --> 00:16:53.593
She'll never give you anything
but honest reactions.

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:56.699
Although, I wonder if they'll
make it here all right.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.672
[Illyasviel] Maybe I ought
to disable a few of the traps.

00:16:59.739 --> 00:17:01.275
Mistress, really.

00:17:01.341 --> 00:17:03.680
You're not actually serious
about allowing those people

00:17:03.747 --> 00:17:04.549
to come in?

00:17:04.615 --> 00:17:06.719
Well, of course.
Why wouldn't I?

00:17:06.786 --> 00:17:09.291
They just said they're only
coming here to talk.

00:17:10.761 --> 00:17:12.130
[Illyasviel] And besides...

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.004
<i>I need to ask Shirou</i>
<i>a few things.</i>

00:17:16.071 --> 00:17:17.273
Listen to yourself!

00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:19.211
Don't be a worry wart, Sella.

00:17:19.277 --> 00:17:21.181
Even if they were planning
on something,

00:17:21.248 --> 00:17:23.152
they're certainly no match
for Berserker.

00:17:23.219 --> 00:17:24.922
While that may be true,
mistress,

00:17:24.989 --> 00:17:26.391
I am solidly against it!

00:17:26.458 --> 00:17:28.697
Stop, please!
I decided!

00:17:28.763 --> 00:17:31.903
I'm lord of the castle.
You're supposed to do as I say!

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:33.272
If you are lord of the castle,

00:17:33.339 --> 00:17:35.309
that's all the more reason
to drive them off!

00:17:35.376 --> 00:17:37.615
[Sella] You are
the Einzbern princess.

00:17:37.681 --> 00:17:39.785
They must be properly invited
to attend

00:17:39.852 --> 00:17:41.823
an appropriate evening
soiree here with the rest‐‐

00:17:41.889 --> 00:17:43.225
Sella, you're being stubborn.

00:17:43.292 --> 00:17:45.998
Also, you're a little off
with your metaphor.

00:17:46.064 --> 00:17:47.735
[both grumbling]

00:17:48.803 --> 00:17:50.273
Oh, all right then.

00:17:50.339 --> 00:17:52.243
Have you come
to your senses now?

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:54.582
Okay, you two can just go out
and get them.

00:17:54.649 --> 00:17:55.717
Mistress?

00:17:55.784 --> 00:17:58.088
I want you to catch them
and bring them here!

00:17:58.155 --> 00:18:00.226
[inhales and exhales sharply]

00:18:01.161 --> 00:18:06.839
[screaming]

00:18:06.906 --> 00:18:09.645
[whimpering]

00:18:09.712 --> 00:18:12.216
[groaning]

00:18:12.283 --> 00:18:13.485
[Shinji] That jerk,

00:18:13.553 --> 00:18:15.389
dragging me along with him into
this crap!

00:18:15.456 --> 00:18:17.695
And just where the hell am I?

00:18:17.761 --> 00:18:19.765
Is this really
where Berserker is?

00:18:19.832 --> 00:18:21.636
That is not Shirou.

00:18:21.703 --> 00:18:24.274
No, a harmless,
irritating little fly.

00:18:24.341 --> 00:18:26.512
Let's deal with him
and be on our way.

00:18:27.046 --> 00:18:28.750
[gasping]

00:18:28.817 --> 00:18:30.419
[Shinji] Ah, good.

00:18:30.486 --> 00:18:32.758
Are you two maids
of the Einzbern household?

00:18:32.825 --> 00:18:34.160
Well, that's convenient.

00:18:34.227 --> 00:18:37.635
So, take me to Berserker's‐‐
[screams]

00:18:37.701 --> 00:18:39.304
[shuddering]

00:18:39.371 --> 00:18:41.174
Hold your tongue, invader.

00:18:41.241 --> 00:18:43.647
We have no time
for more uninvited guests.

00:18:43.713 --> 00:18:45.449
Either you can jump
from the battlements

00:18:45.517 --> 00:18:48.556
to escape or you can fall victim
to this weapon.

00:18:48.623 --> 00:18:50.594
You have ten seconds to decide.

00:18:50.661 --> 00:18:54.669
‐ Nine, eight, seven, six..
‐ Oh! No, w‐‐w‐‐w‐‐wait!

00:18:54.735 --> 00:18:56.438
‐ Five, four...
‐ Hold on a second!

00:18:56.506 --> 00:18:57.841
‐ Are you nuts?
‐ [Leysritt] Three, two, one.

00:18:58.910 --> 00:18:59.845
[gasps]

00:19:02.183 --> 00:19:03.787
I was wondering who was here.

00:19:03.853 --> 00:19:05.056
A pair of homunculi.

00:19:05.323 --> 00:19:07.528
[scoffs]
Nicely made, too.

00:19:07.594 --> 00:19:09.699
Even though you are only human
in shape,

00:19:09.765 --> 00:19:12.437
you almost function as well
as real ones.

00:19:12.504 --> 00:19:15.376
[Gilgamesh] Oh, they used a fine
mold when they made you.

00:19:15.443 --> 00:19:18.917
‐ Sella, he's incredibly strong.
‐ I can sense it.

00:19:18.983 --> 00:19:21.556
See to the mistress
and don't worry about me.

00:19:21.622 --> 00:19:23.727
Oh now,
don't be afraid.

00:19:23.793 --> 00:19:27.300
I forgive your disrespect,
assuming it came from fear.

00:19:29.805 --> 00:19:32.711
You should leave now
if you value your lives.

00:19:32.778 --> 00:19:35.383
I'll give you ten seconds
in appreciation

00:19:35.449 --> 00:19:38.022
for allowing my master
to escape.

00:19:38.088 --> 00:19:40.192
[Sella] That boy is your master?

00:19:40.694 --> 00:19:43.298
Then there is no way we can do
as you ask.

00:19:43.566 --> 00:19:45.403
Our purpose is to protect
the mistress

00:19:45.469 --> 00:19:47.173
from all outside threats.

00:19:47.641 --> 00:19:49.545
At first I took you for a king

00:19:49.612 --> 00:19:51.348
but a man who reeks of blood

00:19:51.415 --> 00:19:53.920
as you do cannot be allowed
to pass.

00:19:53.987 --> 00:19:55.456
Is that so?

00:19:55.524 --> 00:19:57.661
Then like these flowers,
you will fall.

00:19:57.728 --> 00:20:01.301
I expect that the Grail's vessel
will come running when she hears

00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:02.838
your many screams.

00:20:02.905 --> 00:20:05.142
You called her
the Grail's vessel?

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:08.482
‐ Then you are Illya's enemy!
‐ [gasps]

00:20:11.288 --> 00:20:14.427
Shirou is coming here
to the castle,

00:20:14.494 --> 00:20:15.897
where Mother lived.

00:20:16.264 --> 00:20:17.500
[squelching]
[gasps]

00:20:21.776 --> 00:20:22.845
[whimpers]

00:20:23.646 --> 00:20:24.782
[gasps]

00:20:26.519 --> 00:20:28.288
‐ Leysritt, no!
‐ [gasps]

00:20:34.802 --> 00:20:37.775
These mages never learn,
do they?

00:20:38.676 --> 00:20:41.381
[Gilgamesh] You should never
give a human heart to a doll.

00:20:42.851 --> 00:20:47.360
Humans are simply not capable
of equaling your pure loyalty.

00:20:50.232 --> 00:20:51.435
[Sella gasping]

00:20:51.502 --> 00:20:54.775
As long as I can draw breath...

00:20:55.309 --> 00:20:57.514
You won't go near the mistress.

00:20:58.048 --> 00:20:59.451
Really?

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:11.475
[Gilgamesh] Then be proud you
did not break your word.

00:21:13.212 --> 00:21:14.915
[whimpers]
[blow lands]

00:21:15.316 --> 00:21:18.021
[gasping]
[booming]

00:21:18.088 --> 00:21:20.159
[gasps]
[Illyasviel] Leys!

00:21:20.226 --> 00:21:21.562
Sella!

00:21:28.375 --> 00:21:30.246
I gather you are the doll
that was made

00:21:30.312 --> 00:21:31.949
to be the Grail's vessel.

00:21:32.684 --> 00:21:35.489
The crossing of a human being
and a homunculus

00:21:35.557 --> 00:21:38.295
has spawned a bit
of an oddity, I see.

00:21:38.663 --> 00:21:40.867
You killed them for no reason.

00:21:42.036 --> 00:21:43.305
Kill him now!

00:21:43.372 --> 00:21:46.044
This instant, right now!
Kill him, Berserker!

00:21:47.681 --> 00:21:48.850
[scoffs]

00:21:49.618 --> 00:21:50.720
[Gilgamesh] You heard her.

00:21:51.321 --> 00:21:52.691
I'm right here.

00:21:54.093 --> 00:21:56.899
[growls]

00:21:57.266 --> 00:21:59.538
[Gilgamesh] Toying with you
just might relieve me

00:21:59.605 --> 00:22:01.374
of a little of my boredom!

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:04.013
Tell me what you think of this.

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.621
Let's you and I reenact
a battle of legend!
