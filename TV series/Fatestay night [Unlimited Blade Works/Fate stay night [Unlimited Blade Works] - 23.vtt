This means he got rid

Shinji's idea,
no doubt.

00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:01.169
Exactly what the little coward
would do,

00:05:01.235 --> 00:05:02.672

because we know exactly
where he'll be,

00:05:17.702 --> 00:05:20.207

is to stop the summoning

00:05:20.273 --> 00:05:21.209

00:05:21.275 --> 00:05:23.046
Saber takes the main gate

00:05:23.112 --> 00:05:25.918
and while she keeps him busy out
in the front of the temple,

00:05:25.985 --> 00:05:28.958
we'll be climbing the mountain
from the other side sneaking in

so how's that gonna work?

00:05:36.205 --> 00:05:37.341
You're right.

00:05:37.407 --> 00:05:38.911

we won't be able

00:05:38.978 --> 00:05:41.482
to destroy the Grail
once it's been summoned,

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.453
but I know we can
completely destroy

00:05:43.521 --> 00:05:45.558
its vessel before that happens.

00:05:45.625 --> 00:05:47.595
Basically, what we're going
to do is shut down

00:05:47.662 --> 00:05:49.498
the Grail before it's activated.

00:05:50.367 --> 00:05:51.637
What do you mean?

00:05:51.703 --> 00:05:53.908
[Rin] Look,
from what we've learned so far,

00:05:53.974 --> 00:05:57.047
the Holy Grail
is probably Illyasviel's heart.

00:05:57.114 --> 00:06:00.621
I think that the Holy Grail
is the combination

00:06:00.688 --> 00:06:02.992
of the magic circuits
and her heart.

00:06:03.359 --> 00:06:06.432
There's no way Goldie was going
to stand for Illyasviel becoming

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:09.606
<i>the Grail so he ripped out</i>
<i>her heart to make the core.</i>

00:06:09.973 --> 00:06:12.845
But that means
to make it function

00:06:12.912 --> 00:06:14.014
as the Grail,

00:06:14.081 --> 00:06:17.187
he's got to put it inside
the body of another mage.

00:06:17.956 --> 00:06:20.327
Since the two of us
are safe here,

00:06:20.393 --> 00:06:22.364
he's only got one
possible choice.

00:06:22.431 --> 00:06:24.703
[gasps]
You mean Shinji?

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:26.439
But he's not able to...

00:06:26.873 --> 00:06:28.109
I mean...

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.648
The Matou bloodline is gone
but he still

00:06:30.715 --> 00:06:32.417
has latent magic circuits.

00:06:32.484 --> 00:06:34.455
Illyasviel's heart is strong,

00:06:34.522 --> 00:06:37.327
enough to force open
even atrophied circuits.

00:06:37.695 --> 00:06:39.799
[grunts]
And that means we have

00:06:39.866 --> 00:06:42.371
to track Shinji down
and get to him first.

00:06:42.739 --> 00:06:45.678
So then I'll need
to keep Gilgamesh distracted

00:06:45.745 --> 00:06:48.283
until you two manage
to stop the Grail.

00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:49.552
Right.

00:06:49.619 --> 00:06:51.455
And just as soon as we stop
the Grail,

00:06:51.523 --> 00:06:52.792
we'll come back and join you.

00:06:52.859 --> 00:06:54.763
No, come on.
That's crazy.

00:06:54.829 --> 00:06:56.767
Saber doesn't stand
a chance against him.

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:59.238
On what do you base
that assessment?

00:06:59.305 --> 00:07:00.508
‐ [Saber] Shirou?
‐ [both gasping]

00:07:01.075 --> 00:07:04.415
Uh, well, there's no way
he could possibly hold a candle

00:07:04.481 --> 00:07:06.052
to you with a sword,

00:07:06.118 --> 00:07:09.693
but even the strongest warrior
can't fight against war itself.

00:07:10.628 --> 00:07:12.799
He's that kind of heroic spirit.

00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:17.040
You will fall unless
you also become war, too.

00:07:17.709 --> 00:07:20.581
So what you are telling me
is that he and I cannot have

00:07:20.648 --> 00:07:21.950
a fair fight?

00:07:22.017 --> 00:07:23.319
Mm‐hmm.

00:07:24.221 --> 00:07:27.929
And that's the reason we can't
have Saber fight him without

00:07:27.996 --> 00:07:29.298
a solid strategy.

00:07:29.833 --> 00:07:31.803
She needs an advantage
on her side.

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:35.410
Since his Noble Phantasm
is the very embodiment

00:07:35.477 --> 00:07:36.847
of war itself,

00:07:36.913 --> 00:07:38.449
and he's a servant
who specialized

00:07:38.517 --> 00:07:42.157

if you're going to beat him,

00:07:42.224 --> 00:07:45.063

I know why Goldie hated Archer.

00:08:00.594 --> 00:08:04.569
Right, a heroic spirit without
a Noble Phantasm of his own,

00:08:04.636 --> 00:08:07.074
so there's no original weapon
he's based on.

00:08:07.975 --> 00:08:09.144
It'll work.

00:08:09.211 --> 00:08:11.182

is go to your room

00:10:01.235 --> 00:10:03.372
You wanna go up against him,
don't you?

00:10:03.574 --> 00:10:04.676
[Shirou grunts]

00:10:05.978 --> 00:10:08.851
You did it.
You figured it out after all.

00:10:08.917 --> 00:10:11.322
Archer's magic
is the natural enemy

00:10:11.388 --> 00:10:13.794
of Goldie's Noble Phantasm.

00:10:14.294 --> 00:10:15.531
Really, is that right?

00:10:15.598 --> 00:10:17.300
Y‐‐W‐‐Wait just a minute.

00:10:17.367 --> 00:10:19.037
You did not
have it figured out yet

00:10:19.104 --> 00:10:21.510
but still you made
that idiotic suggestion?

00:10:21.576 --> 00:10:24.949
No, I just had this feeling
that out of all of us,

00:10:25.016 --> 00:10:26.820
I'd stand the best chance.

00:10:26.887 --> 00:10:30.393
Well, guess you're not wrong
about that.

00:10:30.794 --> 00:10:33.065
One thing that makes Gilgamesh
so powerful

00:10:33.132 --> 00:10:35.236
is his number
of Noble Phantasms

00:10:35.303 --> 00:10:36.172
and that source book

00:10:36.238 --> 00:10:38.510
for killing heroic spirits
he's got.

00:10:38.977 --> 00:10:42.184
Archer didn't have
a Phantasm tied to his death.

00:10:42.885 --> 00:10:45.223
More than that,
as long as he had mana,

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:47.394
he could match
any opponent's force of arms.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:48.997
[grunts]

00:10:49.064 --> 00:10:52.805
That's why Gilgamesh insisted
on calling the two of you fakes,

00:10:52.872 --> 00:10:55.276
probably because
he identified both

00:10:55.343 --> 00:10:56.513
of you as threats.

00:10:56.913 --> 00:10:59.051
Heroic spirit Emiya's really
the only one

00:10:59.117 --> 00:11:01.623
that he might have had
to face in a fair fight.

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:03.426
There's a flaw, though.

00:11:03.861 --> 00:11:06.031
If he fired a lot of Phantasms
at once,

00:11:06.098 --> 00:11:07.568
I wouldn't be fast enough.

00:11:07.635 --> 00:11:09.271
I'd run out of mana.

00:11:09.338 --> 00:11:12.979
Certainly that'd be the case
if your magic stayed the same,

00:11:13.045 --> 00:11:15.985
but you remember Archer's
Noble Phantasm, don't you?

00:11:16.051 --> 00:11:17.855
If you mastered that,

00:11:17.922 --> 00:11:20.226
<i>if you had control</i>
<i>of that reality marble,</i>

00:11:20.293 --> 00:11:22.665
<i>you could stand</i>
<i>against Gilgamesh.</i>

00:11:23.399 --> 00:11:24.669
You're crazy.

00:11:24.736 --> 00:11:26.873
That kind of power's
just not in me.

00:11:27.307 --> 00:11:28.409
Not right now,

00:11:28.476 --> 00:11:30.581
but there's at least one option
we could look at.

00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:31.950
‐ Huh?
‐ [Rin] Crudely put,

00:11:32.017 --> 00:11:33.987
it's a way
to link two mages together

00:11:34.054 --> 00:11:35.658
so they can share
whatever stores

00:11:35.724 --> 00:11:37.427
of mana they happen to possess.

00:11:37.494 --> 00:11:38.429
[grunts]

00:11:42.972 --> 00:11:45.544
You mean we'd create a path
between you and me

00:11:45.611 --> 00:11:46.713
and then share our mana over it?

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:47.748
Right.

00:11:47.815 --> 00:11:48.817
It doesn't matter whether

00:11:48.884 --> 00:11:50.086
or not you have enough mana

00:11:50.153 --> 00:11:52.825
to use a reality marble,
because I do.

00:11:53.426 --> 00:11:54.328
As a result,

00:11:54.394 --> 00:11:55.931
you'll have all
the power you need

00:11:55.998 --> 00:11:57.702
to take down Gilgamesh.

00:11:58.637 --> 00:11:59.739
But now,

00:11:59.806 --> 00:12:01.509
as to how we'll create
the link‐‐

00:12:01.576 --> 00:12:02.778
[grunts]

00:12:05.483 --> 00:12:06.485
Hey, what's wrong?

00:12:07.287 --> 00:12:08.422
[grunts]

00:12:08.824 --> 00:12:11.128
[inhales and exhales sharply]

00:12:11.963 --> 00:12:15.504
I will take my magic crest
and give it to you.

00:12:15.571 --> 00:12:16.740
[gasps]

00:12:17.407 --> 00:12:18.710
Now, wait a minute.

00:12:18.777 --> 00:12:20.280
The magic crest
is the physical proof

00:12:20.346 --> 00:12:22.417
of a true mage's life,
isn't it?

00:12:22.484 --> 00:12:23.620
That's right.

00:12:24.054 --> 00:12:25.958
At first the crest
is intangible.

00:12:26.025 --> 00:12:27.728
[Rin] The head
of the mage family

00:12:27.795 --> 00:12:29.999
shapes it over the course
of his life.

00:12:30.066 --> 00:12:33.740
It's a legacy passed down
from generation to generation.

00:12:34.374 --> 00:12:37.080
[Shirou] I can't take something
that important.

00:12:37.982 --> 00:12:39.318
[Rin] It's all right.

00:12:39.384 --> 00:12:41.455
It's the most important fight
I'll ever have,

00:12:41.523 --> 00:12:44.094
so I'll use
my most precious possession.

00:12:44.161 --> 00:12:45.229
[grunts]

00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:49.639
Why are you staring at me
all weird like that?

00:12:50.006 --> 00:12:52.344
I was kind of in awe of you.

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:55.985
Sort of late but I just realized
your character's why I fell

00:12:56.051 --> 00:12:57.187
for you the way I did.

00:12:57.253 --> 00:12:58.255
[Rin stammers]

00:12:58.322 --> 00:12:59.926
Uh, you‐‐what‐‐

00:12:59.993 --> 00:13:02.565
it's hardly the occasion
to say that kind of thing!

00:13:03.032 --> 00:13:04.836
Though I‐‐I don't mind listening

00:13:04.902 --> 00:13:06.673
if you need
to unburden yourself.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.543
Yeah, I know.

00:13:08.944 --> 00:13:10.313
There's not much time.

00:13:11.015 --> 00:13:13.386
Okay,
let's get this transplant going.

00:13:13.452 --> 00:13:15.456
Just tell me what you need
for me to do.

00:13:15.524 --> 00:13:16.458
Say the word.

00:13:16.893 --> 00:13:18.062
What?

00:13:18.362 --> 00:13:19.431
Uh...

00:13:19.498 --> 00:13:20.466
Okay, then.

00:13:20.534 --> 00:13:22.672
You can start
by getting undressed.

00:13:22.738 --> 00:13:24.141
What?

00:13:24.207 --> 00:13:25.176
[groans]

00:13:25.711 --> 00:13:26.913

00:13:28.583 --> 00:13:29.819
Something wrong?

00:13:29.886 --> 00:13:32.223
Don't you dare get
any funny ideas!

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:34.862
All I told you to do
was take your clothes off!

00:13:35.463 --> 00:13:38.436
It's only fair 'cause I'll
be taking mine off, too.

00:13:38.503 --> 00:13:39.539
[gulps]

00:13:39.605 --> 00:13:41.208
You're getting undressed, too?

00:13:41.275 --> 00:13:43.880
I‐‐I said don't get
the wrong idea!

00:13:43.947 --> 00:13:47.287
The only reason for it is so we
can transmit our body heat.

00:13:47.354 --> 00:13:49.324
There is nothing more
to it than that!

00:13:49.391 --> 00:13:52.932
It's just that for us
to transfer the magic crest,

00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:55.537
we need to enter a mutual state
of deep rapport.

00:13:55.604 --> 00:13:57.675
Oh, right.
Now I get it.

00:13:57.742 --> 00:14:00.514
So is just my shirt all right?

00:20:40.246 --> 00:20:41.816
But if that is the case,

00:20:41.883 --> 00:20:44.354
then it is the story
of a little girl

00:20:44.421 --> 00:20:46.458
I would no longer recognize.

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:51.435

00:20:56.612 --> 00:20:58.850
I have a favor
to ask of you.

00:20:59.417 --> 00:21:01.254
I will safeguard you both.

00:21:01.789 --> 00:21:04.695
So just make certain
that you two return

00:21:04.762 --> 00:21:05.697
to this house.

00:21:06.999 --> 00:21:09.170
Yeah, we'll come back home.

00:21:09.237 --> 00:21:10.473
Count on it.

00:21:16.619 --> 00:21:19.390
Let's go settle all this,
shall we?

00:21:20.059 --> 00:21:21.261

00:21:22.764 --> 00:21:25.704

your curses, Holy Grail.

00:21:56.899 --> 00:21:59.738
Let us see if the humans
of this time are capable

00:21:59.805 --> 00:22:03.847
of bearing the weight
of their own wishes.

00:22:04.582 --> 00:22:08.188
And now the prophecy
of their judgment day has come.
