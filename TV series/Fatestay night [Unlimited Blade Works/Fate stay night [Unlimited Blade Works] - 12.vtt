is incredibly natural.

[Rin] For a mage's workshop,
it's very open,

It's just the way things are.

to be difficult at all.

More magic training again

00:17:03.312 --> 00:17:04.982
[Shirou] Huh?
Yeah.

00:17:05.049 --> 00:17:06.953
Kiritsugu pounded it into
my brain

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.590
that I can never miss a day.

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:09.892
But to tell the truth,

00:17:09.959 --> 00:17:12.665
that was pretty much
the only thing he taught me.

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:14.969
Only that?

00:17:15.537 --> 00:17:18.275
So he taught you nothing
of basic magical knowledge

00:17:20.046 --> 00:17:22.050
Nah, none of that stuff.

00:17:22.116 --> 00:17:23.352
At the end of the day,

00:17:23.419 --> 00:17:25.524
he really wasn't much
like a mage himself.

00:17:25.924 --> 00:17:27.695
Not a typical adult.

00:17:27.962 --> 00:17:29.164
[Shirou] He used to say,

00:17:29.231 --> 00:17:31.636
"If you enjoy something,
enjoy it to the fullest."

00:17:31.703 --> 00:17:34.040
And then he'd crack up laughing
like a little kid.

00:17:34.107 --> 00:17:35.243
I see.

00:17:35.309 --> 00:17:37.080

00:17:37.146 --> 00:17:38.617
didn't you?

00:17:38.683 --> 00:17:40.554
Yeah, I looked up to him.

00:17:40.621 --> 00:17:43.259
He was a free spirit,
not like a mage at all,

00:17:43.325 --> 00:17:44.461
but in my mind,

00:17:44.528 --> 00:17:47.166
Kiritsugu was one
of the few true wizards.

Oh, yeah.
You noticed that, too?

00:17:58.590 --> 00:17:59.792
Yes.

00:18:00.226 --> 00:18:02.463
It's just a little numb,
that's all.

00:18:02.531 --> 00:18:03.365
And don't worry.

00:18:03.432 --> 00:18:05.236
It's not slowing me down.

00:18:05.604 --> 00:18:07.073
[Saber] Do you know the cause?

00:18:07.675 --> 00:18:08.910
Yeah.

00:18:08.977 --> 00:18:11.849
I think it's related
to the projection magic I did.

[Saber] You.

00:18:17.628 --> 00:18:19.665
You really shouldn't
be surprised at all.

What do you want, Archer?

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:23.607
Last I heard,

00:18:23.673 --> 00:18:25.777
we had a non‐aggression pact

Stop there.

It's okay.

So, tell us what
you're doing here, Archer.

about you performing
a projection.

00:18:48.122 --> 00:18:50.393
[Archer] Half your body is numb
and your center of gravity

00:18:50.459 --> 00:18:52.230
is off by about
seven centimeters.

It looks like something

Something that was closed
has opened?

00:19:10.901 --> 00:19:13.038
[Archer] Circuits that you
were supposed to use

00:19:13.105 --> 00:19:15.510

neglected them for so long.

00:19:15.911 --> 00:19:18.315
Don't worry.
The numbness will go away.

00:19:18.382 --> 00:19:20.353
When you suddenly flooded
those circuits

00:19:20.419 --> 00:19:22.791
you weren't using with mana
at full power,

00:19:22.858 --> 00:19:26.098
you essentially threw them into
a state of intense shock.

00:19:26.566 --> 00:19:28.402
However, this means
that those circuits

00:19:28.469 --> 00:19:30.473
are now active.

You'll make a full recovery

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:44.769
[Archer] And by that time you
should be a slightly better mage

00:19:44.835 --> 00:19:46.204
than you were before.

00:19:47.875 --> 00:19:50.179
[Saber] You certainly know
a lot about this, Archer.

00:19:50.747 --> 00:19:52.785
I went through
something similar.

00:19:52.851 --> 00:19:55.657
I completely lost use
of my arm for a time.

00:19:57.895 --> 00:19:58.897
Hold on.

00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:00.867
What is it?

00:20:04.107 --> 00:20:05.677
I just need to know.

00:20:06.411 --> 00:20:08.449
Ideals drag you down
to your death.

00:20:08.783 --> 00:20:10.721
What the hell was that supposed
to mean?

00:20:11.221 --> 00:20:13.192
It's self‐explanatory.

00:20:13.258 --> 00:20:15.362
There's nothing more
to add to that.

00:20:16.131 --> 00:20:17.233
So what is it, then?

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:18.903
Tell me what it is
you fight for.

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:20.139
It's obvious.

00:20:20.206 --> 00:20:22.043
I fight for myself alone.

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:24.214
There's no other reason
to fight.

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:26.786
For yourself and nothing more?
Really?

00:20:26.853 --> 00:20:27.888
That's right.

00:20:27.955 --> 00:20:30.392
If your main desire
is to never hurt anyone,

00:20:30.459 --> 00:20:32.130
then by all means,
do as you wish.

00:20:32.196 --> 00:20:33.533
It's up to you.

00:20:33.933 --> 00:20:35.002
But be careful.

00:20:35.069 --> 00:20:37.708
Be certain it's your wish
and not anyone else's.

00:20:37.775 --> 00:20:38.877
[gasps]

00:20:38.943 --> 00:20:41.381
Know that if you fight
of your own free will,

00:20:41.448 --> 00:20:43.820
any resulting sins
and punishments will be

00:20:43.887 --> 00:20:45.222
of your own making.

00:20:45.289 --> 00:20:47.628
Bearing it comes
with that decision.

00:20:47.694 --> 00:20:51.569
[Archer] However, if that desire
was borrowed from another person

00:20:51.636 --> 00:20:54.675
then the ideals you claim
are nothing more than fantasy.

00:20:54.742 --> 00:20:56.779
There must be a reason
for fighting

00:20:56.846 --> 00:20:59.484
but that reason must never be
an ideal.

00:20:59.552 --> 00:21:01.121
If you fight for ideals,

00:21:01.188 --> 00:21:03.860
then you will only ever be able
to save ideals.

00:21:05.362 --> 00:21:06.431
That's all.

00:21:06.498 --> 00:21:08.670
You won't be able
to help anyone.

00:21:09.605 --> 00:21:12.410
A desire to save something
or someone stands out

00:21:12.477 --> 00:21:15.416
as a reason to fight,
or at least it does for you.

00:21:15.483 --> 00:21:16.786
Right, Emiya?

00:21:16.853 --> 00:21:17.888
[gasps]

00:21:18.322 --> 00:21:21.596
[Archer] Salvation at the hands
<i>of another is never true.</i>

00:21:22.564 --> 00:21:25.169
Such salvation is like currency.

00:21:25.236 --> 00:21:27.875
When used it passes on
to another.

00:21:28.275 --> 00:21:31.381
It's indeed true that your wish
to save others can probably

00:21:31.448 --> 00:21:33.786
be achieved,
but in doing so,

00:21:33.853 --> 00:21:36.358
you must give up all hope
of saving yourself.

00:21:36.424 --> 00:21:39.164
You shall cling to ideals
not your own,

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:42.805
and you will pursue them until
it destroys you in the end.

00:21:42.871 --> 00:21:43.907
[grunts]

00:21:45.075 --> 00:21:46.646
And that is why these ideals

00:21:46.712 --> 00:21:49.184
you hold so dear
are meaningless.
