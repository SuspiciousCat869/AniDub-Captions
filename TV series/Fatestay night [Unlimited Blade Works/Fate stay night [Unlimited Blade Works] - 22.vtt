00:11:43.574 --> 00:11:45.176
[Shirou gasps]

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.750
[Rin] Archer!

00:11:55.831 --> 00:11:59.104
Who knew he had it in him
to save someone else?

00:11:59.171 --> 00:12:01.643
[Rin shudders]
Why you...

00:12:02.143 --> 00:12:04.549
Who the hell said you could lay
a finger on my Archer,

00:12:04.616 --> 00:12:05.751
you bastard?

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:12.364
I'd meant to start by putting
an end to that one's suffering.

00:12:13.132 --> 00:12:16.238
But someone else wishes
to die first, I see.

00:12:16.305 --> 00:12:17.407
[gasps]

00:12:17.474 --> 00:12:19.344
Rin, get back.

00:12:19.879 --> 00:12:21.650
Tell me,
how are you still here,

00:12:21.716 --> 00:12:22.885
and why?

00:12:23.787 --> 00:12:25.791
I thought it was obvious.

00:12:25.858 --> 00:12:28.664
After the last war
had drawn to a close,

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:30.668
I chose to remain
in this world instead

00:12:30.734 --> 00:12:31.836
of disappearing.

00:12:31.903 --> 00:12:34.207
[grunts]
That is impossible.

00:12:35.176 --> 00:12:38.583
I am the only servant who bathed
in the Grail, you see.

00:12:39.418 --> 00:12:42.023
I first donned my physical form
in this time

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:43.727
ten long years ago.

00:12:44.094 --> 00:12:45.129
[Gilgamesh] And for that,

00:12:45.196 --> 00:12:47.334
I have you to thank,
Saber.

00:12:47.935 --> 00:12:49.505
Because of you,

00:12:49.572 --> 00:12:52.878
I came to know its true nature
better than anyone.

00:12:53.379 --> 00:12:56.285
For as its innards
were strewn across my body,

00:12:56.352 --> 00:12:58.890
I caught a glimpse
of what lay within,

00:12:58.957 --> 00:13:01.428
and that's when I made
a decision.

00:13:02.097 --> 00:13:05.003
That I alone would be
the wielder of the Grail.

00:13:05.069 --> 00:13:07.742
The wielder of the Grail?
You jest.

00:13:07.808 --> 00:13:09.378
[Gilgamesh] Not at all.

00:13:09.444 --> 00:13:13.285
It's the ritual that summons
the Grail that's a sick joke.

00:13:13.352 --> 00:13:16.693
A Life‐or‐death battle royale
between seven masters?

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:20.400
A twisted tournament where only
the last master standing wins

00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:21.670
the Grail?

00:13:21.736 --> 00:13:24.241
All of that nonsense
is just a front.

00:13:24.642 --> 00:13:25.778
You see,
in reality,

00:13:25.844 --> 00:13:27.915
the Grail has been here
all along.

00:13:28.449 --> 00:13:30.788
<i>Before each war,</i>
<i>they prepare the Grail,</i>

00:13:30.854 --> 00:13:34.094
<i>and only then do they summon</i>
<i>the seven servants.</i>

00:13:34.161 --> 00:13:36.432
<i>Do you see,</i>
<i>king of knights?</i>

00:13:36.498 --> 00:13:38.970
<i>What they required was not</i>
<i>the Grail itself</i>

00:13:39.037 --> 00:13:41.275
<i>but rather what goes inside</i>
<i>of it.</i>

00:13:42.511 --> 00:13:44.849
Those mages did create
the Grail.

00:13:44.916 --> 00:13:46.251
That much is true,

00:13:46.318 --> 00:13:49.057
but what they could not do
was fill it.

00:13:49.458 --> 00:13:50.527
In the end,

00:13:50.594 --> 00:13:53.065
they finally decided
to summon the contents

00:13:53.132 --> 00:13:55.504
by deceiving the masters
and servants.

00:13:55.571 --> 00:13:56.740
After all,

00:13:56.806 --> 00:13:58.409
it isn't like
they knew any better.

00:13:58.476 --> 00:13:59.846
[gasps]

00:13:59.912 --> 00:14:01.850
It looks like you're
finally beginning

00:14:01.916 --> 00:14:03.085
to understand.

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:04.789
Good.

00:14:05.356 --> 00:14:07.160
<i>[Gilgamesh] They sought only</i>
<i>the purest mana</i>

00:14:07.227 --> 00:14:08.563
<i>to fill the Grail.</i>

00:14:09.097 --> 00:14:11.603
<i>Only the mightiest souls</i>
<i>would do.</i>

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:13.439
<i>So they scoured the Earth</i>

00:14:13.507 --> 00:14:15.978
<i>for the finest specimens</i>
<i>of humanity.</i>

00:14:17.648 --> 00:14:19.117
[gasps]

00:14:19.184 --> 00:14:21.656
But that's impossible.

00:14:21.723 --> 00:14:23.426
That cannot be true!

00:14:23.492 --> 00:14:26.599
The more sacrifices,
the better the outcome.

00:14:26.666 --> 00:14:29.438
If the souls of six servants
were fed into it,

00:14:29.505 --> 00:14:32.511
the result would approach
complete omnipotence.

00:14:32.578 --> 00:14:34.882
[Gilgamesh] The mages
would have access

00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:37.555
to an almost
inexhaustible source of mana.

00:14:38.724 --> 00:14:39.859
If that is true...

00:14:40.561 --> 00:14:44.569
That means only a master
can wield the Grail after all.

00:14:45.169 --> 00:14:48.309
If the Grail really is
a repository of pure mana...

00:14:50.179 --> 00:14:52.685
[Saber] Only a mage
could make use of it.

00:14:52.752 --> 00:14:54.020
[grunts]

00:14:54.956 --> 00:14:56.526
[chuckles]
Well,

00:14:56.593 --> 00:14:59.364
things of that nature
hold no interest for me.

00:14:59.766 --> 00:15:02.070
I'm far more concerned
with the Grail's ability

00:15:02.137 --> 00:15:03.673
to act as a hole.

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:06.211
What do you mean,
"a hole?"

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.886
[Gilgamesh] Think back
to ten years ago.

00:15:11.756 --> 00:15:14.695
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

00:15:22.645 --> 00:15:26.185
When I was only a step away
from finally claiming the Grail,

00:15:26.251 --> 00:15:28.824
you intervened and stopped me...

00:15:29.458 --> 00:15:32.363
<i>Cleaving the Grail in half</i>

00:15:32.865 --> 00:15:33.967

Saber, you destroyed the Grail?

00:15:36.405 --> 00:15:38.075
What flowed
from the pieces became

00:15:38.142 --> 00:15:41.148
a massive flame that engulfed
the entire city.

00:15:49.532 --> 00:15:52.337
<i>[Gilgamesh] I was directly</i>
<i>beneath it at the time,</i>

00:15:52.403 --> 00:15:55.309
<i>so naturally my body</i>

00:15:57.548 --> 00:16:00.654
<i>It was then that I learned</i>
<i>the Grail's true nature.</i>

00:16:01.388 --> 00:16:03.325
<i>And it was rubbish.</i>

00:16:03.392 --> 00:16:05.531
<i>Yet even rubbish has its uses.</i>

00:16:05.597 --> 00:16:08.035
<i>It was a weapon</i>
<i>unlike any other.</i>

00:16:08.102 --> 00:16:10.206
<i>One perfectly tailored</i>
<i>to killing.</i>

00:16:10.941 --> 00:16:12.110
Weapon?

00:16:12.678 --> 00:16:15.316
The Holy Grail
that servants brought into

00:16:15.383 --> 00:16:18.155
the world is a weapon?
You lie!

00:16:18.557 --> 00:16:21.094
Servants are weapons
by our very nature.

00:16:21.663 --> 00:16:24.602
This brings that nature
to its logical conclusion.

00:16:24.969 --> 00:16:27.808
<i>[Gilgamesh] The Holy Grail</i>

00:16:35.791 --> 00:16:39.297
<i>It was a Grail that</i>

00:16:39.364 --> 00:16:42.003
<i>A chalice of greed</i>
<i>that you humans allow</i>

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:43.573
<i>to descend upon the Earth.</i>

00:16:43.974 --> 00:16:47.681
One of the greatest evils
that mankind has ever wrought.

Born to curse
and kill their own.

00:16:51.121 --> 00:16:55.062

Could it be?

00:16:56.465 --> 00:16:57.701
Yes.

Let's pick up where
we left off last war.

00:18:29.585 --> 00:18:31.656
I recall that we
were interrupted

00:18:31.723 --> 00:18:33.025

00:18:33.092 --> 00:18:35.229

a fake

00:18:37.735 --> 00:18:40.072

If you wish to recover it,

00:20:50.266 --> 00:20:51.769
[Gilgamesh] Calm down.

00:20:51.836 --> 00:20:53.338
I can produce the Grail.

B‐‐But how's that?

00:20:56.244 --> 00:20:57.781
Even if you do have the Grail,

00:20:57.848 --> 00:20:59.518
you still have
to provide a vessel.

00:20:59.585 --> 00:21:01.656
The priest said that
was the only way!

00:21:02.457 --> 00:21:04.427
He said it requires a sacrifice.

00:21:04.494 --> 00:21:06.833
He said it wouldn't work
without one.

00:21:06.899 --> 00:21:09.037
That won't be a problem.

00:21:09.104 --> 00:21:12.511
Any master can be an anchor
and we happen to have one

00:21:12.578 --> 00:21:13.980
right here,
don't we?

00:21:14.047 --> 00:21:15.182
Huh?

You wanted to possess the Grail?

00:21:28.142 --> 00:21:29.612
Happy to give it to you.

00:21:30.212 --> 00:21:31.549
When something's important,

00:21:31.616 --> 00:21:33.820
you should keep it close
to you always.

00:21:39.632 --> 00:21:41.569
Not a pretty picture,
is it?

00:21:41.636 --> 00:21:45.242
Still, it doesn't make it
any less delicious.

00:21:45.777 --> 00:21:47.380
At least someone such
as yourself

00:21:47.446 --> 00:21:49.952
will spew forth
a fine mud indeed.

00:21:50.019 --> 00:21:51.722
I can't wait.

00:21:51.789 --> 00:21:52.991
No, it hurts!

00:21:53.058 --> 00:21:55.029
Ah, it really hurts!

00:21:55.095 --> 00:21:56.666

Help me!

00:21:56.732 --> 00:21:58.435
Help me!

No, please, don't go!

00:22:00.841 --> 00:22:02.376
