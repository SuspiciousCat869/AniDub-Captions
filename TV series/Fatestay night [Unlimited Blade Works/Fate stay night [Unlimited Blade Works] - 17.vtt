<i>[Shirou] Gilgamesh.</i>

<i>[Rin] Yeah.</i>

00:08:29.652 --> 00:08:31.022
<i>Half man,</i>
<i>half god.</i>

00:08:31.088 --> 00:08:34.061
<i>King of Uruk,</i>
<i>seeker of eternal youth.</i>

00:08:34.662 --> 00:08:37.334
<i>He's so powerful,</i>
<i>it's almost unfair.</i>

00:08:37.769 --> 00:08:39.839
‐ And yet‐‐
‐ [Shirou] What's bothering you?

00:08:39.906 --> 00:08:41.275
Hmm.

00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:44.248
He definitely had power,
but still,

00:08:44.314 --> 00:08:46.485
I didn't really sense that much
of a power gap

00:08:46.553 --> 00:08:48.289
between Goldie and Berserker.

00:08:49.024 --> 00:08:50.193
Am I crazy?

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:51.262
[Shirou] Not at all.

00:08:51.328 --> 00:08:52.598
On his own,

00:08:52.665 --> 00:08:54.502
I'd put him even with Saber
or Berserker,

00:08:54.569 --> 00:08:55.571
if not weaker.

00:08:55.638 --> 00:08:58.042
His weapons make the difference.

00:08:58.109 --> 00:09:01.650
Every single weapon he used
was a genuine Noble Phantasm.

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:05.858
Or they're weapons made
of Noble Phantasms.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.929
That must be it.

00:09:07.995 --> 00:09:09.966
Gilgamesh comes
from an ancient myth

00:09:10.033 --> 00:09:13.106
and led a life indulged
with every luxury.

00:09:13.473 --> 00:09:16.445
<i>So it naturally follows</i>
<i>that he'd have the originals</i>

00:09:16.513 --> 00:09:17.949
<i>of all the myths and weapons</i>

00:09:18.015 --> 00:09:20.186
<i>the Noble Phantasms</i>
<i>were based on.</i>

00:09:20.253 --> 00:09:21.857
<i>[Rin] You mean</i>
<i>the weapons themselves</i>

00:09:21.923 --> 00:09:23.727
<i>and not his Noble Phantasm?</i>

00:09:24.529 --> 00:09:26.265
[Shirou] Yes, exactly right.

00:09:26.332 --> 00:09:28.971
There must be a storehouse full
of his treasures.

00:09:29.973 --> 00:09:32.377
That's his Noble Phantasm.

00:09:32.444 --> 00:09:36.686
And why Berserker wasn't able
to stand up against him.

00:09:36.753 --> 00:09:39.324
With the originals
of all Noble Phantasms,

00:09:39.391 --> 00:09:41.696
he only has to pull out
the specific weapon

00:09:41.763 --> 00:09:44.001
a given heroic spirit
can't beat.

00:09:44.468 --> 00:09:47.207
Seriously,
that guy is trouble,

00:09:47.274 --> 00:09:48.209
but at the moment,

00:09:48.276 --> 00:09:50.113
Caster
is the more pressing issue,

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:51.817
so we'll just have
to deal with him later.

00:09:51.883 --> 00:09:53.219
Yeah, you're right.

00:09:53.286 --> 00:09:55.256
[Lancer] Only you two going up
against her?

00:09:56.125 --> 00:09:57.160
Come on.

00:09:57.227 --> 00:09:59.264
You know damn well
that's not going to work.

00:09:59.331 --> 00:10:01.135
Don't be idiots.

00:10:01.202 --> 00:10:02.638
[both] Lancer!

00:10:03.072 --> 00:10:05.343
Been a while since
our evening out.

00:10:06.078 --> 00:10:06.980
Ya miss me?

00:10:10.487 --> 00:10:11.790
‐ [grunts]
‐ No, Shirou!

00:10:11.857 --> 00:10:13.694
‐ Get back!
‐ Tohsaka, leave now!

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:14.996
[both grunting]

00:10:15.063 --> 00:10:16.967
No.
While I draw his attention,

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:18.302
you make a break into the woods!

00:10:18.369 --> 00:10:19.639
I said I got this.

00:10:19.706 --> 00:10:21.308
You need to make sure
that you're safe!

00:10:22.177 --> 00:10:23.814
Now, hang on.

00:10:24.181 --> 00:10:26.385
It sounds like you didn't hear
a single word I said

00:10:26.452 --> 00:10:29.559
when I was telling you you have
to start putting yourself first!

00:10:29.626 --> 00:10:31.730
[Shirou] And I said
that it's okay!

00:10:31.796 --> 00:10:33.567
You know I fought him before.

00:10:33.634 --> 00:10:35.303
I have the experience
for the job.

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:37.374
My ranged weapons will
be more effective

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.577
at a distance.

00:10:38.644 --> 00:10:40.079
[Shirou] Exactly my point.

00:10:40.146 --> 00:10:42.618
You just stay clear of him
and give me some cover, okay?

00:10:42.685 --> 00:10:45.791
I don't know any nimble little
quick draw spells like that!

00:10:45.858 --> 00:10:48.362
If I tried to cover you,
I'd likely blow you away, too!

00:10:48.429 --> 00:10:50.300
[Shirou] Hey,
don't bite my head off.

00:10:50.366 --> 00:10:51.970
I don't understand why
it always has

00:10:52.037 --> 00:10:53.807
to be such overkill with you!
‐ [scoffs]

00:10:53.874 --> 00:10:56.378
W‐‐What did you just say to me,
you big jerk?

00:10:56.445 --> 00:10:59.318
I just want you to stay clear
and be safe!

00:10:59.384 --> 00:11:00.420
[grunts]

00:11:01.322 --> 00:11:03.359
Oh, you finished already?

00:11:03.694 --> 00:11:05.029
There's no rush.
Go ahead.

00:11:05.096 --> 00:11:06.332
Get it out of your system.

00:11:06.398 --> 00:11:07.367
[Rin grunts]

00:11:07.434 --> 00:11:08.737
Oh, relax.

00:11:08.804 --> 00:11:10.574
I have no intention of fighting.

00:11:10.641 --> 00:11:12.410
I'm not a spectator,

00:11:12.477 --> 00:11:14.682
so I thought I'd just stick
my oar in the water

00:11:14.749 --> 00:11:16.385
and offer you guys
a little help.

00:11:16.452 --> 00:11:17.655
You what?

00:11:17.722 --> 00:11:19.191
Wait, did I hear you wrong?

00:11:19.258 --> 00:11:21.963
Because I swear I just heard
you make an offer of help.

00:11:22.497 --> 00:11:24.569
Is that so hard to understand?

00:11:25.203 --> 00:11:28.777
By yourselves you two don't
stand a chance against Caster,

00:11:28.844 --> 00:11:30.413
and since that's the case,

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.319
I'm sayin' that I'm willing
to lend you a hand.

00:11:33.386 --> 00:11:34.354
[grunts]

00:11:34.789 --> 00:11:36.125
I see.

00:11:36.191 --> 00:11:38.262
You're seriously butting in,
though.

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:40.601
And this is your own idea?

00:11:41.001 --> 00:11:42.805
[Lancer] An order
from my master.

00:11:43.239 --> 00:11:46.513
To "form a united front
until Caster's little army

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:47.782
is beaten down."

00:11:47.848 --> 00:11:50.588
Not a bad reason,
but still,

00:11:50.654 --> 00:11:51.923
why go with us?

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:54.228
Someone else might be
a better choice.

00:11:54.294 --> 00:11:56.967
The guy who finally
beat Berserker?

00:11:57.033 --> 00:11:58.870
That's not good chemistry.

00:11:58.937 --> 00:12:01.175
I really don't think
we'd get along.

00:12:01.242 --> 00:12:03.914
Although I wouldn't complain
about his power.

00:12:03.981 --> 00:12:06.051
That's a smart decision,

00:12:06.118 --> 00:12:08.790
but is it a smart decision made
by your master?

00:12:08.857 --> 00:12:10.460
Not really.

00:12:10.828 --> 00:12:12.330
[Lancer]
It was personal preference

00:12:12.397 --> 00:12:14.001
that led me to pick you.

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:17.173
As I recall,
you nearly killed me twice.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.810
Do you really think
I'm gonna believe

00:12:18.877 --> 00:12:20.246
a single word you say?

00:12:22.183 --> 00:12:23.452
Of course.

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.793
You've got a good brain housed
in a fine‐looking woman.

00:12:27.193 --> 00:12:29.231
And if she thought it
was a good idea,

00:12:29.298 --> 00:12:32.103
you'd be willing to throw
your lot in with me, right?

00:12:33.372 --> 00:12:34.308
[both exhale]

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:36.412
See now?

00:12:36.478 --> 00:12:38.684
That's why I thought you'd be
the best.

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:40.219
[Lancer] If I can't choose
my job,

00:12:40.286 --> 00:12:42.692
I'd at least like
to choose my coworkers.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.365
I've liked you since
I first laid eyes on you.

00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:49.973
You're beautiful, stubborn,
gutsy, and not stupid.

00:12:50.774 --> 00:12:52.545
When I have a female master,

00:12:52.612 --> 00:12:54.014
I hope she's like you.

00:12:54.081 --> 00:12:55.183
[grunts]

00:12:55.249 --> 00:12:58.255
All right.
I'm willing to do it.

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:00.728
But if Emiya says
he doesn't think

00:13:00.794 --> 00:13:02.163
he can trust you,
you hit the road

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:03.767
and we don't see you again.

00:13:03.834 --> 00:13:04.869
[gasps]

00:13:04.936 --> 00:13:06.338
[Lancer] You heard the lady.

00:13:06.405 --> 00:13:07.842
What's it gonna be, kid?

00:13:07.908 --> 00:13:09.779
It's your judgment that's on
the line here.

00:13:09.846 --> 00:13:11.281
[groans]

00:13:12.283 --> 00:13:13.553
All right, fine.

00:13:14.021 --> 00:13:15.256
[Shirou] But on one condition.

00:13:16.225 --> 00:13:17.595
If it means that
we get your help,

00:13:17.662 --> 00:13:19.131
I'll go along with trusting you.

00:13:20.266 --> 00:13:21.201
In return...

00:13:22.137 --> 00:13:24.676
What is it you want in return?

00:13:24.742 --> 00:13:26.780
You want to know
who my master is?

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:30.086
Not that.

00:13:31.523 --> 00:13:32.958
We're on the same side.

00:13:33.459 --> 00:13:35.798
But you don't cozy up
with Tohsaka.

00:13:36.231 --> 00:13:37.200
Huh?

00:13:37.635 --> 00:13:38.804
Eh?

00:13:40.206 --> 00:13:44.047
[laughs]
Oh, right, I gotcha!

00:13:44.114 --> 00:13:45.517
I see your point there.

00:13:45.584 --> 00:13:48.122
Yeah, kid,
that's a lot more important

00:13:48.189 --> 00:13:50.728
than a little thing
like who might be my master.

00:13:50.794 --> 00:13:53.065
Is there something wrong
with that?

00:13:53.132 --> 00:13:56.171
So we're clear,
I'm not giving her up to you.

00:13:56.238 --> 00:13:57.240
I got it.

00:13:57.307 --> 00:13:58.877
There will not be any poaching.

00:13:58.944 --> 00:14:00.146
[stammers]

00:14:00.213 --> 00:14:01.816
[Lancer] Well, good for you,
little lady

00:14:01.883 --> 00:14:04.154
The kid here's been bit
by the love bug.

00:14:04.221 --> 00:14:06.893
Wh‐‐What the hell
are you babbling on about?

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:10.366
Shirou and I are only, um‐‐
we're, um‐‐

00:14:10.433 --> 00:14:11.970
we're nothing
but fighting partners

00:14:12.037 --> 00:14:13.205
and allies,
and that's all!

00:14:13.272 --> 00:14:15.611
Uh‐huh.
Are ya, now?

00:14:15.677 --> 00:14:18.784
I can see in your eyes you
don't believe a word I'm saying!

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:20.319
Tell him, Shirou!
Go on!

00:14:20.386 --> 00:14:22.223
Tell him that's all that it is!

00:14:23.593 --> 00:14:25.898
Hey, aren't you gonna
say anything to him,

00:14:25.964 --> 00:14:27.333
you big jerk?

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.507
It's‐‐it's just the same
as saying we like each other

00:14:30.574 --> 00:14:31.543
right out loud!

00:14:32.243 --> 00:14:33.245
[groans]

00:14:33.312 --> 00:14:35.183
Like each other?
Give me a break.

00:14:35.249 --> 00:14:37.955
Everyone knows you're a couple.
Man.

00:14:38.355 --> 00:14:41.128
You are in for one hell
of a bumpy ride, kid.

00:14:41.195 --> 00:14:42.097
Yep.

00:14:42.163 --> 00:14:43.734
I already know that.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.537
Tohsaka's a handful.

00:14:45.604 --> 00:14:46.906
[gasps]

00:14:46.973 --> 00:14:48.175
Well, in that case,

00:14:48.242 --> 00:14:50.079
I should probably be careful.

00:14:50.446 --> 00:14:51.516
That said,

00:14:51.583 --> 00:14:54.187
she is rather amusing
when she's being teased.

00:14:54.254 --> 00:14:56.492
Do I have your permission
to chat with her?

00:14:58.129 --> 00:15:00.366
All right.
We'll do it your way.

00:15:00.834 --> 00:15:02.303
Until Caster's taken care of,

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:04.207
we're willing to accept help
from you.

00:15:04.742 --> 00:15:05.911
It's a deal.

00:15:05.978 --> 00:15:07.648
Damn you.

00:15:08.082 --> 00:15:10.052
Now you pissed me off!

00:15:10.119 --> 00:15:12.357
I swear,
if I have to put up with this,

00:15:12.424 --> 00:15:15.129
I'm gonna kick Casters ass
all by myself!

00:15:30.727 --> 00:15:33.967
[door creaks open and shut]

00:15:39.912 --> 00:15:41.081
[grunts]

00:15:41.482 --> 00:15:44.121
Shouldn't you be outside
on guard?

00:15:45.924 --> 00:15:49.431
I'm getting quite tired
of the meaningless activity.

00:15:49.498 --> 00:15:52.638
Caster's eyes covered
the entire church area.

00:15:53.105 --> 00:15:55.143
No reason I should stand watch.

00:15:55.677 --> 00:15:57.948
So you are acting
on your own behalf?

00:15:58.282 --> 00:16:00.954
I think Caster will find you
to be a headache.

00:16:01.021 --> 00:16:03.292
You needn't be concerned
about that.

00:16:03.359 --> 00:16:06.900
I myself am under
her keen watchful eye.

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:08.435
Any suspicious activity

00:16:08.503 --> 00:16:10.874
and I'll be dispatched
via command seal.

00:16:11.275 --> 00:16:13.112
If you know all of that
to be true,

00:16:13.179 --> 00:16:14.515
then why are you here?

00:16:14.582 --> 00:16:16.553
Don't complain
when she scolds you

00:16:16.619 --> 00:16:18.088
for breaching your pact.

00:16:18.824 --> 00:16:19.992
You're right.

00:16:20.059 --> 00:16:21.996
Well, I came here because
I realized

00:16:22.063 --> 00:16:24.201
I'd never had a chance
to get to know you.

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:29.144
[Souichirou] I am someone
who could never cultivate

00:16:29.211 --> 00:16:30.781
an identity.

00:16:30.848 --> 00:16:33.385
My own desires are formless,

00:16:33.452 --> 00:16:36.593
but somehow,
though I cannot explain why,

00:16:36.659 --> 00:16:40.333
I want to make that woman's wish
come true for her.

00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:43.640
I believe that this
is a very human desire,

00:16:43.707 --> 00:16:44.842
is it not?

00:16:44.909 --> 00:16:47.347
You want to grant Caster's wish.

00:16:47.915 --> 00:16:49.484
You know what her goal is?

00:16:49.552 --> 00:16:51.656
To win the Holy Grail
for herself

00:16:51.723 --> 00:16:53.459
and to set herself free.

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:55.631
You accept that as a valid wish?

00:16:55.697 --> 00:16:57.868
This is very different
than a wish.

00:16:57.935 --> 00:16:59.872
It's rather a duty
to be carried out

00:16:59.939 --> 00:17:01.943
in the course of daily life.

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:05.249
Though Caster herself
does not seem to realize it.

00:17:05.918 --> 00:17:07.988
<i>[Souichirou] She simply wants</i>
<i>to go home.</i>

00:17:08.523 --> 00:17:11.228
<i>Freedom has never been</i>
<i>her desire.</i>

00:17:18.342 --> 00:17:20.814
It's time for the final battle.

00:17:21.348 --> 00:17:23.152
Take your post, Archer.

00:17:23.219 --> 00:17:25.356
If they have not given up
the fight by now,

00:17:25.423 --> 00:17:27.695
this chance will be their last.

00:17:27.761 --> 00:17:29.431
I agree with you.

00:17:29.497 --> 00:17:32.671
My assumption has been that they
would be attacking us at dawn.

00:17:37.146 --> 00:17:39.084
I forgot to ask you something.

00:17:39.518 --> 00:17:42.190
What is it you consider right
and proper?

00:17:42.891 --> 00:17:44.595
Let's see now.

00:17:45.229 --> 00:17:47.233
That would be something
that one does not ever

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:48.770
regret having done.

00:17:49.237 --> 00:17:51.542
Even if the choice
to do it was wrong.

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:54.447
I view good and evil
as being equal.

00:17:54.815 --> 00:17:56.853
[Souichirou] And I think that
is the only evidence

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.525
of human‐like goodness
you will find in me.

00:18:08.777 --> 00:18:09.712
[Rin] Hey, Lancer.

00:18:09.779 --> 00:18:11.448
You sure what your job is,
right?

00:18:11.516 --> 00:18:13.520
Don't make me explain it again.

00:18:13.586 --> 00:18:16.893
<i>[Lancer] Yeah,</i>
<i>my job is to battle Archer.</i>

00:18:17.327 --> 00:18:19.765
If worse comes to worst,
I'll deal with Saber, too.

00:18:19.832 --> 00:18:22.270
It won't be a problem
keeping them busy.

00:18:22.337 --> 00:18:23.940
Don't forget assassin.

00:18:24.007 --> 00:18:25.476
She's got him, too.

00:18:25.544 --> 00:18:26.679
Worst case,

00:18:26.746 --> 00:18:28.950
you could wind up facing
all three of 'em.

00:18:29.351 --> 00:18:31.556
[Lancer] Yeah, that bastard
is problematic.

00:18:31.956 --> 00:18:34.662
Hell, I'd rather not even
face him one‐on‐one.

00:18:35.196 --> 00:18:37.935
But he won't be showin' up
at the church for this fight.

00:18:38.002 --> 00:18:39.739
How can you be so sure of that?

00:18:39.805 --> 00:18:42.143
If Caster's not
at Ryuudou Temple,

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:44.247
wouldn't she call Assassin
to where she is?

00:18:44.314 --> 00:18:46.351
It's true Caster may
have summoned him

00:18:46.418 --> 00:18:47.688
to be her servant,

00:18:47.755 --> 00:18:49.625
but that puts limitations
on him.

00:18:49.692 --> 00:18:50.727
For one thing,

00:18:50.794 --> 00:18:52.765
he's not able to leave
the temple grounds.

00:18:52.831 --> 00:18:54.568
‐ Hmm.
‐ [Lancer] To hell with him.

00:18:54.635 --> 00:18:56.371
‐ [grunts]
‐ Are you really sure

00:18:56.438 --> 00:18:58.576
you could beat Caster
by yourselves?

00:18:58.643 --> 00:19:01.315
You don't stand a chance
in a straight magic fight.

00:19:01.381 --> 00:19:03.018
I suppose not.

00:19:03.085 --> 00:19:06.659
Still, if I can just manage
to get Caster one‐on‐one,

00:19:06.726 --> 00:19:08.797
I'm pretty sure
I can blindside her.

00:19:08.863 --> 00:19:10.701
That right?
I see.

00:19:10.767 --> 00:19:12.771
You've got an ace
up your sleeve.

What little stratagem
will it be?

00:19:38.255 --> 00:19:40.292
You aren't the sort
who would come here

00:19:40.359 --> 00:19:42.063

be dealing with me.

00:19:47.508 --> 00:19:49.845
Well, I'm surprised.

00:19:49.912 --> 00:19:51.448
You have a new pact?

00:19:51.516 --> 00:19:55.156

to part ways so tragically?

While I'm not one to talk,

I think your fickleness
is astonishing.

00:19:58.997 --> 00:20:01.368
I guess it was a good idea
to have broken

00:20:01.435 --> 00:20:02.671

to do with you‐‐

I don't care for the idea
that servants like you exist.

In fact,
it really pisses me off!

I'll be sure to pull my punches.

00:20:36.739 --> 00:20:38.777
He still has to be able

Lancer?

Ah, it's nothing.
