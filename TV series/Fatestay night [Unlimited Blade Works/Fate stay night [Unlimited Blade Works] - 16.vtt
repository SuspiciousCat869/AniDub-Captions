00:11:44.642 --> 00:11:47.247
I can manage just fine
on my own.

00:11:47.314 --> 00:11:50.320
I don't need anyone else
to win the Holy Grail War.

00:11:51.021 --> 00:11:52.892
That's not the truth.

00:11:52.959 --> 00:11:55.664
You need Berserker, too.

00:11:55.731 --> 00:11:59.606
Berserker
will keep Illya safely.

00:11:59.973 --> 00:12:01.710
Don't make me laugh.

00:12:01.776 --> 00:12:03.814
A servant is only
a familiar bound by

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.383
a set of magical rules.

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:07.354
[Illyasviel] Without my
command seals,

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:08.590
it would betray me.

00:12:08.657 --> 00:12:10.861
I don't trust anyone anymore.

00:12:12.497 --> 00:12:15.069
[Sella] We will now start
linking you and Berserker.

00:12:15.671 --> 00:12:17.274
The work done throughout
the past years

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:20.881
has placed magic circuits
in over 70% of your body.

00:12:21.248 --> 00:12:24.421
An ordinary master would receive
far less servant feedback

00:12:24.488 --> 00:12:25.858
than you will be feeling.

00:12:25.925 --> 00:12:28.229
Mistress, please use caution.

00:12:28.296 --> 00:12:31.503
Illya, if it hurts,
you need to stop.

00:12:31.569 --> 00:12:32.672
I don't care.

00:12:32.738 --> 00:12:33.941
Let's get started.

What is going on here?

00:12:44.829 --> 00:12:46.533
[Illyasviel] What are you doing?

00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:48.436
I order you to move, Berserker!

00:12:49.806 --> 00:12:51.610
I said move!

00:12:52.344 --> 00:12:53.880
What's the matter with you?
[blow lands]

00:12:53.947 --> 00:12:54.816
Come on!
[blow lands]

00:12:54.882 --> 00:12:56.051
Move!

00:12:56.118 --> 00:12:58.189
You're the most powerful
heroic spirit?

00:12:58.757 --> 00:13:00.293
Dammit, move!

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:04.502
[roaring]

00:13:15.924 --> 00:13:17.193
Mistress, stop!

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.097
You have to sever the link!

00:13:19.164 --> 00:13:22.137
We can perform the ritual
for the pact some other time!

00:13:22.203 --> 00:13:23.807
[Illyasviel] This is nothing.

00:13:23.874 --> 00:13:25.076
Leave me alone.

00:13:25.143 --> 00:13:27.648
I will break him soon enough.

00:13:27.715 --> 00:13:29.451
Just be quiet and watch.

00:13:29.519 --> 00:13:31.422
I will not be beaten!

00:13:31.488 --> 00:13:34.027
I'm the most powerful master
in the world!

00:13:34.796 --> 00:13:36.365
I'll break you!

00:13:45.884 --> 00:13:46.886
What?

00:13:46.953 --> 00:13:48.189
How'd I get here?

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:50.093
Oh, that's right.

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.665
I was in the middle
of the final test.

00:13:53.432 --> 00:13:55.838
If I make it back
to the castle alive,

00:13:55.904 --> 00:13:58.009
then I can go to Fuyuki.

00:13:58.777 --> 00:14:01.181
But I left Berserker
behind somewhere.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.854
Doesn't matter, I guess.

00:14:04.589 --> 00:14:06.659
I'll just summon myself
a new servant

00:14:06.726 --> 00:14:08.362
once I'm back at the castle.

00:14:11.435 --> 00:14:15.009
I'll summon one not as scary
who won't cause me pain

00:14:15.076 --> 00:14:16.412

Why did you come here?

00:14:55.724 --> 00:14:57.795
I went off and abandoned you.

00:14:57.862 --> 00:15:01.970
[wolves snarling]

00:15:02.036 --> 00:15:04.274
Why aren't you fighting
the wolves?

00:15:06.613 --> 00:15:08.650
Because of me?

00:15:09.151 --> 00:15:12.190
[Illyasviel] Because you
don't want to make me suffer?

00:15:12.892 --> 00:15:14.996
Because you don't want
to hurt me?

00:15:16.298 --> 00:15:17.367

00:15:29.057 --> 00:15:31.028
Now I understand.

00:15:31.763 --> 00:15:35.103
You didn't come and protect me
because I ordered you to

00:15:35.169 --> 00:15:37.307
or just because you're
a servant.

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:40.781
You did it
of your own free will.

00:15:41.215 --> 00:15:44.287
Because that's what you wanted
to do, isn't it?

00:15:45.256 --> 00:15:48.630
Berserker, you're so strong.

You get it, right?

00:16:15.684 --> 00:16:16.986
No matter what happens,

00:16:17.053 --> 00:16:18.590
you cannot interfere.

00:16:18.657 --> 00:16:21.629
We don't have any effective way
to fight them right now.

00:16:21.696 --> 00:16:22.832
Got it?

00:16:22.898 --> 00:16:24.569
Before you can save anyone,

00:16:24.635 --> 00:16:26.673
you've got
to save yourself first.

00:16:26.739 --> 00:16:28.375
