Those are the proof that you are

They are also spells
that control your servant,

at least one of those,

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.561

to waste them.

00:03:03.868 --> 00:03:06.607
You'll probably be killed
if you use them all too soon,

Yeah, I guess I do,
sort of.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.597
[Rin] For
a more detailed explanation,

00:04:58.664 --> 00:05:00.133

00:05:06.312 --> 00:05:07.715
to fight once
you've been chosen,

00:05:07.782 --> 00:05:09.686

From what I understand,

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.010
based on what Emiya said,

00:05:22.077 --> 00:05:25.350
I gather you're in
an incomplete state, Saber?

00:05:25.417 --> 00:05:27.487
Yes.
As you've accurately stated,

I am not
at full fighting strength.

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:32.665
The fact is,
Shirou is not a trained master,

00:05:32.732 --> 00:05:35.103

will be difficult.

its physical existence

in this world by being supplied
with mana by its master,

00:05:46.927 --> 00:05:48.797
but she can't get
an adequate amount

00:05:48.864 --> 00:05:50.668
of mana from you because you're
a novice

00:05:50.735 --> 00:05:52.170
and you don't know how to focus.

I'm good.

00:05:58.349 --> 00:05:59.619
I have to say,

00:05:59.686 --> 00:06:01.557
I didn't expect you
to be so open with me

00:06:01.623 --> 00:06:02.926
about all this.

00:06:03.293 --> 00:06:04.729
There was no point in lying.

the truth about my condition

a clear view

of his current circumstances.

00:06:15.685 --> 00:06:17.387

Jeez, I'm beginning
to feel like there's something

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.476
Uh, anyway,

00:07:18.544 --> 00:07:21.115
Saber is a hero from the past,
right?

00:07:21.182 --> 00:07:22.819
So she's just gonna be confused.

00:07:22.885 --> 00:07:25.323
She won't be able to make sense
of the modern world.

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:26.827

As such, I am quite familiar

You're familiar with it?

How can that be?

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:37.849

00:07:37.915 --> 00:07:39.552
This is not the first time

00:07:39.619 --> 00:07:41.590
that I have been summoned
to this time in history.

00:07:41.657 --> 00:07:43.426
What?
No way.

00:07:43.493 --> 00:07:44.663
What are the odds of that?

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:46.232
So then.

00:07:46.465 --> 00:07:47.835
Where is it we are going?

Saber isn't coming in with us?

00:08:24.909 --> 00:08:26.646
[Rin] She said earlier
that she'd been summoned

00:08:26.713 --> 00:08:28.349
to this era before.

00:08:28.684 --> 00:08:30.186
So maybe something happened
between her

00:08:30.253 --> 00:08:32.157
and the fake priest we're here
to see.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:40.306
[Shirou] Tohsaka, what kind
of person is this priest?

00:08:40.373 --> 00:08:43.012

was my father's pupil.

After Father died,

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:46.352
he became my guardian.

00:08:46.787 --> 00:08:49.291
I suppose that makes him both
my senior disciple

00:08:52.732 --> 00:08:54.769
So the priest is also a mage?

00:08:54.836 --> 00:08:56.238
[Rin] Yeah.
Like I said,

00:08:56.305 --> 00:08:57.775
a genuine fake priest.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:04.923
[Kirei] You never accepted
my invitations to come by.

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:07.829
And now here you are
with an odd guest.

00:09:07.895 --> 00:09:10.801
I take it this means that he
is the seventh.

00:09:11.202 --> 00:09:12.137
Rin.

00:09:13.974 --> 00:09:15.243
[grunts]

00:09:17.314 --> 00:09:19.853
My name is Kirei Kotomine.

00:09:19.919 --> 00:09:21.823
Perhaps you will tell me
your name.

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:24.461
Or shall I call you
Seventh Master?

00:09:24.529 --> 00:09:27.033
Shirou Emiya.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.436
Emiya?

00:09:28.504 --> 00:09:29.906
[Kirei scoffs]

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.344
‐ [grunts]
‐ [chuckles]

00:09:32.912 --> 00:09:36.419
I take it, then,
that you are now Saber's master,

00:09:36.485 --> 00:09:38.189
young Shirou Emiya.

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:40.160
[Shirou] I made a pact
with Saber,

00:09:40.226 --> 00:09:41.295
if that's what you mean,

00:09:41.362 --> 00:09:44.334
but all this stuff about masters
and servants

00:09:44.401 --> 00:09:47.775
and the Holy Grail War is just
a lot of gibberish to me.

00:09:48.109 --> 00:09:50.413
If a master is supposed
to be a proper mage

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.119
then you really ought
to pick somebody else

00:09:53.186 --> 00:09:54.188
for your war.

00:09:54.589 --> 00:09:55.891
Yes, I see.

00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.662
This is quite serious indeed.

00:09:57.728 --> 00:09:59.131
He knows nothing.

00:09:59.198 --> 00:10:01.135
You need to start
from square one.

00:10:01.202 --> 00:10:02.304
Ah.

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:03.841
Very well.

00:10:04.208 --> 00:10:06.245
This is the first time you
have ever come

00:10:06.312 --> 00:10:07.815
to me for assistance.

00:10:08.717 --> 00:10:10.320
[Kirei] Shirou Emiya.

00:10:10.821 --> 00:10:13.861
The status of master cannot
be yielded to another,

00:10:13.927 --> 00:10:15.430
and once conferred,

00:10:15.497 --> 00:10:17.602
cannot be simply
walked away from.

00:10:18.102 --> 00:10:21.375
Being a master is a trial
for those who have been chosen.

00:10:21.442 --> 00:10:24.148
You will not be freed
from the burden of that pain

00:10:24.214 --> 00:10:25.684
until you win the grail.

00:10:25.751 --> 00:10:27.387
Now listen carefully.

00:10:27.454 --> 00:10:29.959
The battle you now
find yourself caught up in

00:10:30.026 --> 00:10:32.965
is known by all involved
as the Holy Grail War.

00:10:33.032 --> 00:10:35.236
The messed up war
where seven masters fight

00:10:35.303 --> 00:10:37.174
to the death?
Is that what you mean?

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.979
It is a ritual meant
to seek out and select

00:10:40.046 --> 00:10:42.919
the one mage who is worthy
of holding the grail.

00:10:42.985 --> 00:10:44.154
[Shirou] Now, wait.

00:10:44.221 --> 00:10:46.158
This Holy Grail you keep
going on about,

00:10:46.225 --> 00:10:48.697
you don't mean "the Holy Grail,"
do you?

00:10:48.764 --> 00:10:50.568
The Grail that appears
in this city

00:10:50.634 --> 00:10:52.003
is the genuine article.

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:54.542
For proof,
one need look no further

00:10:54.609 --> 00:10:57.314
than the miracle of the servants
and the heroic spirits

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:58.717
that inhabit them.

00:10:58.784 --> 00:11:00.486
‐ [Shirou grunts]
‐ [Kirei] A Holy Grail capable

00:11:00.554 --> 00:11:03.226
of that will surely grant
the master who holds it

00:11:03.292 --> 00:11:04.328
limitless power.

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:07.535
The item's authenticity
is irrelevant

00:11:07.602 --> 00:11:09.004
in the face of such a fact.

00:11:09.404 --> 00:11:11.375
[Shirou] Well,
why make people go through

00:11:11.442 --> 00:11:13.312
this Holy Grail War thing, then?

00:11:13.747 --> 00:11:15.049
If it's that powerful,

00:11:15.116 --> 00:11:16.953
why doesn't everyone
just share it?

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.191
A fair opinion,
to be sure,

00:11:19.258 --> 00:11:22.030
but only one master may win
the Holy Grail.

00:11:22.097 --> 00:11:24.769
It was not mages who imposed
that restriction,

00:11:24.836 --> 00:11:27.007
but rather
the Holy Grail itself.

00:11:27.073 --> 00:11:27.875
[gasps]

00:11:27.942 --> 00:11:29.979
It decided?
How is that?

00:11:30.046 --> 00:11:33.419
Everything around you
is the work of the Grail itself.

00:11:33.486 --> 00:11:35.089
It selects its true owner

00:11:35.156 --> 00:11:37.995
by having seven masters fight
over it.

00:11:38.597 --> 00:11:41.135
And that is the Holy Grail War.

00:11:41.636 --> 00:11:42.805
[grunts]

00:11:44.542 --> 00:11:46.513
Well, I'm still not convinced.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.951
[Shirou] Even if only one
can be chosen,

00:11:49.017 --> 00:11:50.654
I don't like it that
that person has

00:11:50.721 --> 00:11:52.558
to kill all the other masters.

00:11:52.625 --> 00:11:53.660
[Rin] Hold on a second.

00:11:53.727 --> 00:11:55.396
There's no rule
that says we have

00:11:55.463 --> 00:11:56.967
to kill each other, Emiya.

00:11:57.033 --> 00:11:58.570
It is a fight to the death.

00:11:58.637 --> 00:12:00.373
Oh, Kirei, shut up!

00:12:01.408 --> 00:12:02.410
[Rin] Listen to me.

00:12:02.477 --> 00:12:04.515
The Holy Grail that appears
in this town

00:12:04.582 --> 00:12:06.051
is a spiritual object.

00:12:06.118 --> 00:12:08.690
Since it's intangible,
we can't touch it.

00:12:08.757 --> 00:12:10.594
Can you guess what that implies?

00:12:10.661 --> 00:12:11.963
[gasps]

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:13.700
Right.

00:12:13.767 --> 00:12:15.604
The point of the Holy Grail War

00:12:15.671 --> 00:12:18.577
is to eliminate the servants
of all the other masters,

00:12:18.644 --> 00:12:21.348
which means that there
is no rule saying you have

00:12:21.415 --> 00:12:23.954
to kill the other masters
in order to win.

00:12:24.321 --> 00:12:27.394
Shirou Emiya,
if I may ask a question,

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.464
do you think that you
are remotely capable

00:12:29.532 --> 00:12:30.668
of defeating your servant?

00:12:30.734 --> 00:12:32.003
Huh?

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:34.107
Servants are very difficult
to overcome

00:12:34.174 --> 00:12:35.744
even with another servant.

00:12:35.811 --> 00:12:37.347
So how does one prevail?

00:12:37.414 --> 00:12:39.852
The answer is obvious,
is it not?

00:12:41.121 --> 00:12:43.259
[Kirei] No matter how clever
or powerful the servant,

00:12:43.326 --> 00:12:45.263
if its master ceases
to be alive,

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:48.670
the servant vanishes with him,
in which case...

00:12:48.737 --> 00:12:50.073
[exhales sharply]

00:12:50.139 --> 00:12:52.377
The quickest way is killing
the master.

00:12:52.444 --> 00:12:54.047
[Kirei] Exactly.

00:12:56.051 --> 00:12:57.555
<i>[Shirou] But what if</i>
<i>a master's servant</i>

00:12:57.622 --> 00:12:59.057
<i>is destroyed first?</i>

00:12:59.726 --> 00:13:02.698
<i>Only servants can touch</i>
<i>the Holy Grail, right?</i>

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:04.969
<i>So a master who's lost</i>
<i>his servant</i>

00:13:05.036 --> 00:13:06.840
<i>no longer has any value</i>
<i>in the war.</i>

00:13:06.906 --> 00:13:08.109
<i>[Kirei] No.</i>

00:13:08.175 --> 00:13:10.179
<i>As long</i>
<i>as his command seals remain,</i>

00:13:10.246 --> 00:13:12.083
<i>so do his rights</i>
<i>as a master.</i>

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:14.722
<i>He still has the chance</i>
<i>to rejoin the war</i>

00:13:14.789 --> 00:13:17.728
<i>by teaming up with a servant</i>
<i>that has lost its master</i>

00:13:17.795 --> 00:13:19.431
<i>and has nowhere to go.</i>

00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:24.542
<i>And it is for that reason</i>
<i>that masters kill masters.</i>

00:13:25.043 --> 00:13:28.583
Okay, what if I used all
my command seals right now?

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:30.320
Wait, no!
Don't do that!

00:13:30.386 --> 00:13:32.090
As you surmised,

00:13:32.157 --> 00:13:35.129
your rights as a master
would indeed be lost.

00:13:35.196 --> 00:13:38.603
Although, I cannot imagine
a mage using magic

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:42.611
as powerful as command seals
in a manner so wasteful

00:13:42.678 --> 00:13:44.247
and immature.

00:13:44.582 --> 00:13:45.517
If there were one,

00:13:45.584 --> 00:13:47.487
he would either be
an ignorant novice

00:13:47.555 --> 00:13:50.226
or merely a coward not worthy
of the craft.

00:13:50.293 --> 00:13:51.996
‐ [grunts]
‐ [Kirei chuckles]

00:13:52.063 --> 00:13:54.201
Have I convinced you?

00:13:54.267 --> 00:13:58.109
Then let us go back
to the beginning, Shirou Emiya.

00:13:58.175 --> 00:14:01.448
If you insist on forfeiting
your status as master,

00:14:01.516 --> 00:14:02.885
you may do so.

00:14:02.952 --> 00:14:07.227
Simply use up your command seals
and break your pact with Saber.

00:14:07.293 --> 00:14:08.864
Should you choose that path,

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:12.437
I shall guarantee your safety
until this Holy Grail War comes

00:14:12.505 --> 00:14:13.640
to an end.

00:14:13.707 --> 00:14:15.009
Guarantee my safety?

00:14:15.076 --> 00:14:17.180
Why would I need
to be protected by you?

00:14:17.247 --> 00:14:18.482
[scoffs]

00:14:19.151 --> 00:14:21.188
[Kirei] I was dispatched
to this city

00:14:21.255 --> 00:14:24.529
to officially oversee the series
of Holy Grail Wars.

00:14:24.595 --> 00:14:28.436
Safeguarding the mages
who are no longer masters

00:14:28.503 --> 00:14:31.408
is one of the overseers'
top priorities.

00:14:31.475 --> 00:14:32.878
Wait, you said series.

00:14:33.112 --> 00:14:34.281
[Shirou] Hang on.

00:14:34.347 --> 00:14:36.485
Are you saying that
the Holy Grail War

00:14:36.553 --> 00:14:37.988
didn't begin just now?

00:14:38.824 --> 00:14:40.527
This one is the fifth.

00:14:40.961 --> 00:14:42.865
The previous one
was ten years ago,

00:14:42.932 --> 00:14:45.571
making this the shortest cycle
in the long history of the war.

00:14:47.006 --> 00:14:49.010
I can't believe this
has happened before.

00:14:49.077 --> 00:14:51.716
[Kirei] Yes,
and with each new generation

00:14:51.783 --> 00:14:53.385
of masters summoned,

00:14:53.452 --> 00:14:55.624
the Grail War
has grown ever more brutal.

00:14:56.458 --> 00:14:57.828
Driven by desire,

00:14:57.895 --> 00:15:00.032
masters have engaged
in vicious deeds

00:15:00.099 --> 00:15:02.303
including
indiscriminate slaughter.

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:04.542
How could anyone think
of doing that?

00:15:04.609 --> 00:15:07.715
So what happens if the guy
who wins the Grail

00:15:07.782 --> 00:15:09.217
is a complete and total bastard?

00:15:09.284 --> 00:15:12.223
It is beyond our ability
to stop one whom the Grail

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:14.494
has chosen from using the cup.

00:15:14.562 --> 00:15:15.697
After all,

00:15:15.764 --> 00:15:17.167
it is the omnipotent chalice

00:15:17.233 --> 00:15:19.137
that grants any wish.

00:15:19.204 --> 00:15:22.143
If that is not acceptable
to you, Shirou Emiya,

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:24.214
then go out and win it yourself.

00:15:24.281 --> 00:15:26.719
[Kirei] If you do then at
the very least

00:15:26.786 --> 00:15:30.561
it will not end up in the hands
of an indiscriminate killer.

00:15:30.627 --> 00:15:32.096
[Shirou groans]

00:15:33.466 --> 00:15:34.669
No.

00:15:34.735 --> 00:15:36.405
I have no reason to fight.

00:15:36.472 --> 00:15:37.808
I see.

00:15:37.875 --> 00:15:40.446
So you have no interest at all
in what the holder

00:15:40.514 --> 00:15:41.616
of the Grail does,

00:15:41.683 --> 00:15:43.854
even if there is a disaster
as a result

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.858
of his all too human flaws?

00:15:45.924 --> 00:15:47.360
I didn't say that.

00:15:47.427 --> 00:15:50.567
If you have no reason to fight,
then fine.

00:15:50.634 --> 00:15:53.607
Should I also assume
that you have no interest

00:15:53.673 --> 00:15:56.111
in the disastrous events
of ten years ago?

00:15:56.178 --> 00:15:57.581
Ten years ago?

00:15:57.915 --> 00:15:59.151
[Kirei] Indeed.

00:15:59.217 --> 00:16:02.123
At the very end
of the previous Grail War,

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:05.062
an unworthy master touched
the Holy Grail.

00:16:05.129 --> 00:16:08.269
I know not what it was
that master wished for.

00:16:08.335 --> 00:16:10.774
All that is clear
is the aftermath

00:16:10.841 --> 00:16:13.680
of the disaster that resulted
from his wish.

00:16:13.747 --> 00:16:15.283
Wait just a minute.

00:16:15.651 --> 00:16:16.753
I don't believe it.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:18.055
Are you saying...

00:16:20.527 --> 00:16:21.796
I am.

00:16:22.397 --> 00:16:25.336
<i>Kirei] The New City fire</i>
<i>whose cause remains unknown</i>

00:16:25.403 --> 00:16:27.942
<i>to this day is actually</i>
<i>the aftermath</i>

00:16:28.008 --> 00:16:29.645
of that Holy Grail War.

00:16:31.148 --> 00:16:32.483
[Rin] Emiya!

00:16:32.551 --> 00:16:34.087
[grunts]

00:16:37.327 --> 00:16:39.632
You said that this one
is the fifth time.

00:16:39.699 --> 00:16:42.972
Has anyone in the past ever
actually won the grail, then?

00:16:43.038 --> 00:16:45.944
[Kirei] One man did indeed hold
the Grail in his hands

00:16:46.011 --> 00:16:47.648
however briefly.

00:16:47.715 --> 00:16:49.017
Did he get his wish?

00:16:49.084 --> 00:16:50.253
What happened to him?

00:16:50.319 --> 00:16:51.455
[Kirei] Nothing at all.

00:16:51.523 --> 00:16:52.691
[exhales]

00:16:52.758 --> 00:16:56.231
It seems that Grail
did not achieve completion.

00:16:56.298 --> 00:16:58.469
[Kirei] The result
of a foolish man

00:16:58.537 --> 00:17:00.974
letting sentiment get
the better of him.

00:17:01.441 --> 00:17:04.047
Simply making the Grail appear
is trivial.

00:17:04.515 --> 00:17:06.385
Once the seven servants
are gathered,

00:17:06.451 --> 00:17:09.157
the Grail will appear in time.

00:17:09.692 --> 00:17:10.861
As Rin says,

00:17:10.928 --> 00:17:13.833
it is not necessary to slay
the other masters,

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.369
but unless you do so,

00:17:15.436 --> 00:17:17.407
the Grail will not be complete.

00:17:17.473 --> 00:17:19.377
It chooses the master who
is worthy

00:17:19.444 --> 00:17:21.683
to command its unlimited power.

00:17:21.749 --> 00:17:24.287
That is why this man
who avoided fighting

00:17:24.354 --> 00:17:26.559
did not officially win
the Grail.

00:17:26.626 --> 00:17:27.861
[scoffs]

00:17:27.928 --> 00:17:29.197
In other words,

00:17:29.264 --> 00:17:30.634
even if you do get the Grail,

00:17:30.701 --> 00:17:32.671
it's pointless if you don't
finish off all

00:17:32.738 --> 00:17:33.807
the other masters.

00:17:34.709 --> 00:17:35.744
You see,

00:17:35.811 --> 00:17:37.013
the master who got his hands

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.719
on the Grail in the last war
was weak.

00:17:40.086 --> 00:17:42.023
That is all I have to day.

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:45.396
You need to decide right here
and now if you will participate

00:17:45.463 --> 00:17:48.570

Shirou, you have been my master
