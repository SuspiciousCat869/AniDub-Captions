00:14:55.858 --> 00:14:59.097
The bounded field cuts us off

[Saber] This bounded field

<i>we need to call.</i>

00:20:47.761 --> 00:20:49.632
<i>We'll explain things</i>
<i>to Kirei</i>

00:20:49.698 --> 00:20:51.268
<i>and he'll see to everything.</i>

00:20:51.702 --> 00:20:52.604
I see.

00:20:52.671 --> 00:20:54.407
I'll call him right away, then.

00:21:00.186 --> 00:21:02.558
[Shirou] You said it was Caster
on that floor?

00:21:02.624 --> 00:21:05.229
[Saber] Yes, although it
was merely Caster's shadow

00:21:05.296 --> 00:21:07.033
that was controlling all
the familiars.

00:21:07.701 --> 00:21:08.736
I see.

00:21:08.803 --> 00:21:10.807
Then the real Caster hasn't
set foot outside

00:21:10.874 --> 00:21:13.713
of Ryuudou Temple,
and knowing her,

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:17.053
she manipulated Shinji
to lure Rider into a trap.

00:21:17.554 --> 00:21:18.957
So you believe that Rider

00:21:19.023 --> 00:21:21.027
was killed through deception,
then.

00:21:21.094 --> 00:21:22.430
Crap.

00:21:22.497 --> 00:21:24.802
At least we know
that Caster's master

00:21:24.869 --> 00:21:26.672
is someone that's right here
at this school.

00:21:27.206 --> 00:21:28.342
Hey.

00:21:29.645 --> 00:21:31.148
[Shirou] All right,
if you have something to say,

00:21:31.214 --> 00:21:32.618
then go ahead and say it.

00:21:33.418 --> 00:21:35.524
Emiya, you're level‐headed.

00:21:36.191 --> 00:21:37.995
I'm just surprised.

00:21:38.295 --> 00:21:39.565
[Shirou] I wasn't calm.

00:21:39.632 --> 00:21:42.236
I was probably so pissed
that I lost control.

00:21:42.303 --> 00:21:43.438
[Rin] Even so,

00:21:43.506 --> 00:21:45.442
you checked
on everyone's injuries.

00:21:47.079 --> 00:21:48.950
I don't think
I could have done that.

00:21:50.452 --> 00:21:52.825
Really, it was no big deal.

00:21:53.192 --> 00:21:55.029
I'm used to seeing dead bodies.

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:56.666
[gasps]

00:21:57.868 --> 00:21:59.037
[Rin] You are?
