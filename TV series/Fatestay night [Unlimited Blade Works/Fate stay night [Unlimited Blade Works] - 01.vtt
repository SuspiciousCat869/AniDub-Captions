Just let it slide!

I know this pendant
is very useful

00:10:09.418 --> 00:10:12.290
but it's not going to do
a thing to help me summon Saber,

00:10:12.357 --> 00:10:14.061
the most powerful servant.

when my mana is at its peak,

00:12:02.812 --> 00:12:04.916
I'll get Saber even without
a catalyst.

00:12:04.983 --> 00:12:06.452
Just you watch.

Close the four gates,
come forth from the crown,

the forked road leading

00:12:27.595 --> 00:12:28.797

Fill, fill, fill, fill, fill.

Repeat five times,

destroy it.

00:12:40.821 --> 00:12:42.223
Set.

00:12:42.792 --> 00:12:44.094
Heed my words.

00:12:44.161 --> 00:12:46.265
My will creates your body

00:12:46.332 --> 00:12:49.071
and your sword
creates my destiny.

00:12:49.572 --> 00:12:53.312
If you heed the Grail's call
and obey my will and reason,

00:12:53.379 --> 00:12:54.882
then answer me.

00:12:55.751 --> 00:13:00.226
I hereby swear I shall be all

00:13:40.239 --> 00:13:41.275
Mm?

00:13:48.924 --> 00:13:50.326
Hmm?

[gasps]
Wait.

00:13:57.508 --> 00:13:59.044
[Rin] All the clocks
in the house were running

00:13:59.111 --> 00:14:01.382
an hour early
when I got up this morning,

00:14:01.448 --> 00:14:05.390
which means it's now 1:00 a. m.,
not 2:00 a. m.

00:14:05.858 --> 00:14:07.828
I did it again!

00:14:07.895 --> 00:14:10.166
Well, what's done is done,
I guess.

00:14:10.233 --> 00:14:11.235
[groans]

00:14:11.301 --> 00:14:13.540
Why did you give me
this task, father?

00:14:14.274 --> 00:14:15.376
[groans]

00:14:15.443 --> 00:14:16.679
Oh, all right.

00:14:16.746 --> 00:14:17.915
What are you?

00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:19.886
That's the first thing
you say to me?

00:14:19.952 --> 00:14:21.455
Well, well, well.

00:14:21.523 --> 00:14:23.894
Looks like I was summoned
by quite the master.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.296
No, wait.

00:14:25.363 --> 00:14:27.601
I must have drawn
the shorter straw.

00:14:27.668 --> 00:14:28.870
[grunts]

00:14:28.937 --> 00:14:31.375
Just to be perfectly clear,
whoever you are,

00:14:31.442 --> 00:14:33.980
you're my servant, correct?
[grunts]

00:14:34.047 --> 00:14:36.418
And am I to presume that you
are my master?

00:14:36.485 --> 00:14:38.456
You weren't present
when I emerged

00:14:38.523 --> 00:14:39.257
from the summoning.

00:14:39.324 --> 00:14:40.594
Don't tell me you expected

00:14:40.661 --> 00:14:42.565
your master to be sitting here
waiting for you

00:14:42.631 --> 00:14:44.702
to give you a warm welcome.
Give me a break.

00:14:44.769 --> 00:14:46.004
You're not a baby.

00:14:46.071 --> 00:14:48.209
[groans]
All right, fine.

00:14:48.677 --> 00:14:50.346
Just answer my question, okay?

00:14:50.413 --> 00:14:52.417
You really are my servant,
right?

00:14:52.484 --> 00:14:55.123
Just mine and no one else's.
Is that correct?

00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:57.862
Master‐servant relationships
should be clearly laid out

00:14:57.928 --> 00:14:58.864
right off the bat.

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:00.299
Of course.

00:15:00.366 --> 00:15:02.237
I completely agree
with that opinion.

00:15:02.303 --> 00:15:03.472
However,

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.744
where's the evidence
that you're really my master

00:15:05.811 --> 00:15:07.515
and not some impostor?

00:15:08.048 --> 00:15:09.451
Right here.

00:15:09.519 --> 00:15:12.090
This is all the proof you need
that I am your master.

00:15:13.292 --> 00:15:14.327
[grunts]

00:15:14.394 --> 00:15:15.363
[exhales sharply]

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:16.365
Oh, dear.

00:15:16.432 --> 00:15:18.703
Do you really mean that,
little miss?

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:20.941
That's not what I want to see.

00:15:21.008 --> 00:15:23.179
That token on your hand
is meaningless.

00:15:23.245 --> 00:15:25.183
What I want to see
is if you're someone

00:15:25.249 --> 00:15:26.853
who's worthy
of my loyalty.

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.222
Excuse me?

00:15:28.289 --> 00:15:30.393
I'm not good enough
to be your master?

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:31.495
[grunts]

00:15:31.563 --> 00:15:33.432
[Archer] I'm completely
dissatisfied,

00:15:33.499 --> 00:15:35.771
but I'll acknowledge you
as my master.

00:15:36.338 --> 00:15:38.777
But only on one condition.

00:15:39.344 --> 00:15:42.283
In the war to come,
I will not obey your commands.

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:44.822
I will decide how I battle.

00:15:44.889 --> 00:15:47.293
You don't object to that,
do you?

00:15:47.761 --> 00:15:48.964
[groans]

00:15:49.464 --> 00:15:50.466
I see.

00:15:50.834 --> 00:15:53.974
You begrudgingly acknowledge me
but refuse to listen

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.613
to my tactical opinions.
How can that be?

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.184
You are my servant,
are you not?

00:15:59.251 --> 00:16:01.956
Yes, but in form only.

00:16:02.323 --> 00:16:05.129
So,
I will obey you in form only.

00:16:05.196 --> 00:16:09.004
Oh, and I'll be calling
my own shots until

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:10.741
this Holy Grail War ends.

00:16:10.808 --> 00:16:13.479
I suggest you sit tight down
in some cellar.

00:16:13.547 --> 00:16:14.849
‐ [Rin groans]
‐ [Archer] If you do that,

00:16:14.916 --> 00:16:17.955
even a novice like you should
be able to stay alive.

00:16:18.857 --> 00:16:21.228
Oh, have I made you angry?

00:16:21.629 --> 00:16:24.535
Well, I've great respect
for your office.

00:16:24.602 --> 00:16:25.671
After all,

00:16:25.737 --> 00:16:27.473
I was summoned here
to win a great victory

00:16:27.541 --> 00:16:28.475
for my master.

00:16:28.543 --> 00:16:29.612
[Rin groans]

00:16:29.679 --> 00:16:31.516
[Archer] My victory
will be your victory,

00:16:31.583 --> 00:16:34.354
and I'll pass on any fruits
of battle to you.

00:16:34.755 --> 00:16:36.559
I'm sure that's acceptable?

00:16:36.926 --> 00:16:39.699
So, just leave everything
to me now

00:16:39.765 --> 00:16:42.505
and see to your own safety
and well being.

00:16:43.072 --> 00:16:45.511
I don't expect anything
from you.

00:16:45.577 --> 00:16:46.579
[grunts]

00:16:46.646 --> 00:16:49.084
[Rin] Shut up already!

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:50.687
[grunts]
Fine!

00:16:50.754 --> 00:16:52.758
You asked for it!
I'll show you who's master!

00:16:52.825 --> 00:16:53.793
Anfang!

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:55.162
What?
Wait!

00:16:55.229 --> 00:16:56.733
[Rin] No, I won't!

00:16:56.799 --> 00:16:58.870
You despicable ingrate!

00:16:58.937 --> 00:17:01.408
[speaking foreign language]

00:17:01.475 --> 00:17:03.345
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

00:17:03.412 --> 00:17:05.617
Wasting a command seal
on something like this?

00:17:05.684 --> 00:17:07.555
[speaking foreign language]
Silence!

00:17:07.621 --> 00:17:10.426
Listen,
you are my goddamn servant!

00:17:10.493 --> 00:17:14.735
That means absolute obedience!
You'll do everything I say!

00:17:14.802 --> 00:17:17.307
[grunting]

00:17:21.415 --> 00:17:23.587
[groans]
Are you really that stupid?

00:17:23.653 --> 00:17:26.593
I can't believe you wasted
a command seal on that!

00:17:28.329 --> 00:17:30.333
L‐‐Let's take this elsewhere.

00:17:44.327 --> 00:17:45.764
Well, Master,

00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:47.768
I think I now have
a pretty good idea

00:17:47.835 --> 00:17:49.037
of who you are.

00:17:49.739 --> 00:17:51.408
But just to be clear,

00:17:51.475 --> 00:17:54.147
you do realize how precious
command seals are,

00:17:54.214 --> 00:17:55.416
don't you?

00:17:56.218 --> 00:17:58.122
What's that superior tone?

Absolute obedience
to what I say, my ass.

00:18:01.328 --> 00:18:03.633
They symbolize our power
to compel our servants

up to three times.
Of course I know that.

Listen to me.

00:18:09.077 --> 00:18:10.781
[Archer] Command seals compel
a servant

00:18:10.847 --> 00:18:12.450
to perform a specific action.

00:18:13.185 --> 00:18:14.454
For example,

00:18:18.228 --> 00:18:20.901
However,
if you ordered via command seal,

00:18:20.968 --> 00:18:24.240
it would use both our mana
to make the teleport possible.

00:18:24.609 --> 00:18:26.646

are the crystallization

Oh, stop your whining.

All you get from up here
is a panoramic view of the city.

00:27:13.533 --> 00:27:15.770
You can't get a feel for how
a city is laid out

00:27:15.837 --> 00:27:17.439

Of course not.

00:27:52.777 --> 00:27:55.115
No, it's just an acquaintance.

00:27:55.182 --> 00:27:57.787
A common citizen who has nothing
to do with all this.

00:27:57.854 --> 00:27:59.858
I neglected
to ask you something.

00:27:59.925 --> 00:28:02.029
‐ What?
‐ Rin,

00:28:02.096 --> 00:28:04.467
you were vigorously trained
from an early age

00:28:04.535 --> 00:28:07.206
to be a master
and you went along with that.

00:28:07.273 --> 00:28:08.375
Correct?

00:28:08.643 --> 00:28:09.878
That's right.

00:28:09.945 --> 00:28:11.515
The dream of winning
the Holy Grail

00:28:11.582 --> 00:28:14.588

for many generations.

00:28:14.655 --> 00:28:15.757
Good, then.

00:28:15.823 --> 00:28:17.794
I expect you know
what your goal is.

00:28:17.861 --> 00:28:20.800
I cannot entrust my blades

00:28:22.469 --> 00:28:24.942

what is your wish?

00:28:26.477 --> 00:28:28.048

You don't?

00:28:29.685 --> 00:28:31.054
But that's impossible.

00:28:31.622 --> 00:28:35.195
The Grail is an omnipotent cup
that can grant any desire.

00:28:35.262 --> 00:28:37.834
You can even conquer
the whole world for yourself.

00:28:37.901 --> 00:28:39.705
[Rin] I'll pass

00:28:39.771 --> 00:28:41.307

Why are you fighting

Because, Archer,
