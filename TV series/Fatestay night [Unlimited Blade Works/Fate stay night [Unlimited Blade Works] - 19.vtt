00:10:13.192 --> 00:10:14.161
On!

00:10:15.163 --> 00:10:17.033
[shattering]

00:10:17.835 --> 00:10:19.238
<i>Make them better.</i>

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:21.275
<i>Faster.</i>

00:10:21.877 --> 00:10:23.514
<i>Stronger!</i>

00:10:23.914 --> 00:10:27.320
<i>I can see it‐‐</i>
<i>the structure of these swords.</i>

00:10:28.022 --> 00:10:32.798
Don't screw with me,
you bastard!

00:10:37.508 --> 00:10:39.111
[Rin grunts]
Archer!

00:10:39.178 --> 00:10:42.250
‐ What are you doing?
‐ [groaning]

00:10:42.317 --> 00:10:43.419
[Shirou] Tohsaka!

00:10:43.486 --> 00:10:45.256
[gasping]

00:10:45.323 --> 00:10:46.526
Ah!

00:10:46.593 --> 00:10:47.728
[whimpers]

00:10:49.866 --> 00:10:52.070
[Saber] Archer,
where are you taking her?

00:10:52.137 --> 00:10:54.208
[Archer] It seems I'm back
to square one.

00:10:54.274 --> 00:10:57.247
This little skirmish wiped out
my mana,

00:10:57.314 --> 00:11:00.053
and I'm no match for you now
that you're at your best.

00:11:00.119 --> 00:11:02.992
Taking her
as my insurance policy.

00:11:03.059 --> 00:11:07.067
If you value your master's life,
I suggest you stay out of this.

00:11:07.133 --> 00:11:09.004
Don't come between me
and that boy's‐‐

00:11:09.071 --> 00:11:10.975
Meet me out in the forest.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:12.778
What's that?

00:11:13.312 --> 00:11:16.051
There's a castle
where nobody lives anymore.

00:11:16.118 --> 00:11:17.354
Shirou.

00:11:17.755 --> 00:11:19.659
You've got a problem with me,
right?

00:11:20.126 --> 00:11:23.032
We can talk all about it there,
'cause believe it or not,

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:25.169
I've got a problem with you,
too!

00:11:25.604 --> 00:11:26.907
Hmm.

00:11:26.973 --> 00:11:29.679
I suppose we wouldn't
be interrupted there.

00:11:29.746 --> 00:11:32.317
I admire your resolve,
Shirou Emiya.

00:11:33.152 --> 00:11:34.154
Shut up!

00:11:34.221 --> 00:11:36.258
If you even lay a finger
on Tohsaka,

00:11:36.325 --> 00:11:37.528
I'll kill you!

00:11:37.595 --> 00:11:40.534
[Archer] I will guarantee
her safety for one day,

00:11:40.601 --> 00:11:41.870
but don't dawdle.

00:11:41.937 --> 00:11:43.139
Without a master,

00:11:43.206 --> 00:11:45.778
I myself won't last much longer
than two.

00:11:46.345 --> 00:11:48.517
If I haven't managed
to kill you by then,

00:11:48.584 --> 00:11:50.854
I might have to start
dismembering my hostage

00:11:50.921 --> 00:11:52.057
out of spite.

00:11:54.328 --> 00:11:55.764
[groaning]

00:11:55.831 --> 00:11:57.000
Shirou!

00:11:57.568 --> 00:11:58.604
This is reckless.

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:00.073
You are not ready.

00:12:00.139 --> 00:12:02.745
Even you cannot cast
the same projections as Archer.

00:12:03.714 --> 00:12:05.651
Saber, I'm sorry.

00:12:05.985 --> 00:12:08.322
I let her get captured.

00:12:09.191 --> 00:12:12.030
[Saber] At the moment you are
in far more danger than she is.

00:12:12.632 --> 00:12:13.934
Leave Rin to me.

00:12:14.334 --> 00:12:16.405
<i>You should go home</i>
<i>and try to rest.</i>

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.824
[whooshing]

00:12:27.795 --> 00:12:30.166
I take it everything is over,
kid?

00:12:30.534 --> 00:12:31.937
‐ Not bad.
‐ [grunts]

00:12:32.003 --> 00:12:33.740
Put down your sword, Saber.

00:12:34.074 --> 00:12:35.811
It's fine.
Lancer helped us.

00:12:35.878 --> 00:12:38.015
‐ He's on our side.
‐ Uh, what?

00:12:38.082 --> 00:12:41.088
Are you telling me that Lancer
actually assisted you?

00:12:41.155 --> 00:12:44.027
[Shirou] Yeah, he did,
so for now,

00:12:44.094 --> 00:12:46.198
try not to fight him,
okay?

00:12:46.265 --> 00:12:47.868
Explain yourself.

00:12:48.436 --> 00:12:50.874
Why would you give aid
to Shirou and Rin?

00:12:50.941 --> 00:12:53.145
Do you have some
ulterior motive?

00:12:53.212 --> 00:12:54.114
Huh?

00:12:54.181 --> 00:12:56.352
Of course I have
an ulterior motive.

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.993
I wouldn't o' helped if I didn't
expect something in return.

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:01.630
I see.

00:13:01.997 --> 00:13:03.900
Then you must have
what you were after,

00:13:03.967 --> 00:13:05.169
so begone.

00:13:05.236 --> 00:13:07.508
I have no reason
to fight with you now.

00:13:09.612 --> 00:13:11.048
[Lancer] Hey, kid.

00:13:11.115 --> 00:13:13.520
You don't look
like everything went as planned.

00:13:14.454 --> 00:13:15.924
What happened in there?

00:13:17.427 --> 00:13:18.530
It's not good.

00:13:18.597 --> 00:13:20.333
Archer took Tohsaka hostage.

00:13:26.513 --> 00:13:28.684
<i>[Rin] This hill</i>
<i>is his whole world.</i>

00:13:29.117 --> 00:13:30.954
<i>His eternal reward</i>
<i>for a lifetime</i>

00:13:31.021 --> 00:13:32.157
<i>of helping people.</i>

00:13:32.223 --> 00:13:33.560
<i>The end of the line.</i>

00:13:35.998 --> 00:13:38.269
He seemed to embrace this world,

00:13:38.336 --> 00:13:41.475
<i>dying with a satisfied smile</i>
<i>across his lips.</i>

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:44.381
<i>Seriously,</i>
<i>how stupid is that?</i>

00:13:44.448 --> 00:13:45.651
<i>Anyway...</i>

00:13:46.185 --> 00:13:48.356
<i>That made me really furious.</i>

00:13:49.959 --> 00:13:51.228
<i>He worked ceaselessly,</i>

00:13:51.295 --> 00:13:53.734
striving
for greatness beyond his nature,

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.207
<i>finally buying this miracle</i>
<i>with his blood.</i>

00:13:57.675 --> 00:14:00.714
<i>This victory should</i>
<i>have brought him happiness.</i>

00:14:01.181 --> 00:14:03.319
<i>If he brings happiness</i>
<i>to many people,</i>

00:14:03.386 --> 00:14:05.758
<i>then surely his own happiness</i>
<i>will at least equal what</i>

00:14:05.824 --> 00:14:07.027
<i>he brought to others.</i>

00:14:07.093 --> 00:14:09.164
<i>In fact,</i>
<i>it may even surpass it.</i>

00:14:10.066 --> 00:14:11.268
<i>But alas,</i>

00:14:11.335 --> 00:14:13.673
<i>that was not the reward</i>
<i>he received.</i>

00:14:14.174 --> 00:14:16.345
<i>Instead he was given</i>
<i>a cruel fate,</i>

00:14:16.412 --> 00:14:18.817
<i>one in which he was exploited</i>
<i>as a guardian</i>

00:14:18.884 --> 00:14:20.788
<i>long after his death.</i>

00:14:21.523 --> 00:14:24.227
Why didn't I put it all together
<i>before now?</i>

00:14:24.662 --> 00:14:28.904
Servants can be summoned
from any age without exception.

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:31.175
<i>Heroic spirits</i>
<i>can be called upon</i>

00:14:31.241 --> 00:14:33.045
<i>from the past,</i>
<i>the present,</i>

00:14:33.112 --> 00:14:35.984
<i>or even from some far off</i>
<i>unrealized future.</i>

00:14:36.586 --> 00:14:37.688
<i>There is no law,</i>

00:14:37.755 --> 00:14:38.857
<i>no rule that states</i>

00:14:38.924 --> 00:14:40.226
<i>a servant cannot be summoned</i>

00:14:40.293 --> 00:14:43.065
<i>to the time and place</i>
<i>in which he once lived.</i>

00:14:43.567 --> 00:14:45.571
<i>Just thinking about it</i>
<i>is frustrating.</i>

00:14:45.637 --> 00:14:49.211
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>neither one can be saved.</i>

00:14:49.277 --> 00:14:51.516
<i>Not the one looking back</i>
<i>on his past,</i>

00:14:51.583 --> 00:14:53.720
<i>nor the one looking</i>
<i>to his future.</i>

00:14:54.254 --> 00:14:56.158
<i>All he can do is grieve</i>
<i>for what</i>

00:14:56.225 --> 00:14:58.129
<i>will inevitably happen to him.</i>

00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:02.203
<i>I already know what becomes</i>
<i>of the fool who tries</i>

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.542
<i>to live his life</i>
<i>in service to others.</i>

00:15:06.211 --> 00:15:09.886
<i>He sacrificed everything,</i>
<i>even his own afterlife.</i>

00:15:09.952 --> 00:15:13.058
<i>Death could not prevent him</i>
<i>from helping others.</i>

00:15:13.125 --> 00:15:15.329
<i>It was more</i>
<i>than he'd ever dreamed of.</i>

00:15:15.396 --> 00:15:18.202
<i>He was helpless in life</i>
<i>because he was weak,</i>

00:15:18.269 --> 00:15:21.208
but so convinced was he that he
<i>could avert any tragedy</i>

00:15:21.275 --> 00:15:23.680
<i>as a heroic spirit</i>
<i>that he sold away</i>

00:15:23.747 --> 00:15:26.285
<i>the peace death would</i>
<i>have granted him.</i>

00:15:27.555 --> 00:15:30.026
He believed he
could save thousands of lives‐‐

00:15:30.092 --> 00:15:31.963
<i>tens of thousands.</i>

00:15:32.497 --> 00:15:36.506
<i>But soon even that hope</i>
<i>was betrayed.</i>

00:15:37.273 --> 00:15:39.679
<i>Only one thing can be said</i>
<i>of him.</i>

00:15:39.745 --> 00:15:43.486
<i>His life such as it was</i>
<i>brought him constant betrayal.</i>

00:15:43.887 --> 00:15:45.256
<i>And in the end,</i>

00:15:45.323 --> 00:15:47.060
<i>he was betrayed even by</i>

00:15:47.127 --> 00:15:49.665
<i>the one ideal he</i>
<i>had believed in.</i>

00:15:54.509 --> 00:15:55.544
[gasps]

00:15:56.478 --> 00:15:57.515
[grunts]

00:16:03.292 --> 00:16:05.697
What are you trying to pull,
Archer?

00:16:06.533 --> 00:16:07.500
[scoffs]

00:16:08.335 --> 00:16:09.505
[scoffs]

00:16:10.006 --> 00:16:11.308
You know Shirou
would come anyway

00:16:11.375 --> 00:16:13.112
whether I was here or not.

00:16:13.479 --> 00:16:15.584
You of all people should
have realized that.

00:16:16.519 --> 00:16:17.721
Maybe so.

00:16:18.255 --> 00:16:20.126
But it would be inconvenient
for you to be there

00:16:20.193 --> 00:16:21.461
when he does.

00:16:21.529 --> 00:16:22.698
I see.

00:16:22.765 --> 00:16:25.002
So you intend to kill Shirou
no matter what.

00:16:25.069 --> 00:16:26.338
Is that right?

00:16:26.573 --> 00:16:27.508
[Archer] Right.

00:16:27.575 --> 00:16:29.712
Anybody that naive
should be put down

00:16:29.779 --> 00:16:30.981
before it's too late.

00:16:31.048 --> 00:16:32.217
Hmm.

00:16:32.283 --> 00:16:34.120
I know how naive he can be.

00:16:34.187 --> 00:16:36.425
I've seen it firsthand
many times.

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:38.062
[grunts]

00:16:38.128 --> 00:16:39.665
But that's part of his charm.

00:16:39.732 --> 00:16:43.105
It's what makes him the sweet,
kindhearted person he is.

00:16:43.472 --> 00:16:45.309
<i>[Rin] And I want him</i>
<i>to stay that way.</i>

00:16:45.376 --> 00:16:46.980
<i>It's comforting</i>
<i>to know that someone</i>

00:16:47.046 --> 00:16:48.583
<i>like him can exist.</i>

00:16:50.052 --> 00:16:52.023
But what about you, Archer?

00:16:52.423 --> 00:16:53.793
After all the things
you've done,

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:56.098
you suddenly think it's wrong
to waive one's idealism

00:16:56.164 --> 00:16:57.568
in people's faces?

00:16:57.635 --> 00:17:00.941
Over and over again,
you fought for others.

00:17:01.008 --> 00:17:03.045
Over and over,
you were betrayed.

00:17:03.112 --> 00:17:04.447
Over and over,

00:17:04.515 --> 00:17:06.719
you were forced
to clean up messes humans made.

00:17:06.786 --> 00:17:08.088
Is that it?

00:17:08.155 --> 00:17:10.293
Is that what made you
just give up on humanity?

00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:12.497
Huh?
Answer me!

00:17:16.038 --> 00:17:17.273
[Archer scoffs]

00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:19.512
[Rin] "I am the bone
of my sword."

00:17:20.948 --> 00:17:23.920
The incantation you were given
the day that you became

00:17:23.987 --> 00:17:25.891
a heroic spirit."

00:17:26.358 --> 00:17:30.066
Even a curse should never be
that cruel.

00:17:31.636 --> 00:17:33.773
I don't agree
with a single thing

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:35.209
that's happened in your life.

00:17:36.078 --> 00:17:37.881
Not the messed up way you live,

00:17:37.948 --> 00:17:40.854
not the people who didn't
help you when you needed it.

00:17:41.321 --> 00:17:43.292
And I don't know what
to do with all that.

00:17:44.862 --> 00:17:46.733
But I can't agree with it.

00:17:49.104 --> 00:17:50.507
[Shinji] Well, well.

00:17:50.574 --> 00:17:52.410
‐ [both grunting]
‐ [Shinji] What a surprise.

00:17:52.477 --> 00:17:55.817
I was skeptical at first
but here you are,

00:17:55.884 --> 00:17:57.186
in the flesh.

00:17:58.088 --> 00:17:59.124
[chuckles]

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:00.661
Shinji?

00:18:01.094 --> 00:18:02.330
[Archer] A guest.

00:18:02.665 --> 00:18:05.102
I came here because I thought
we wouldn't be interrupted.

00:18:05.169 --> 00:18:06.171
Easy now.

00:18:06.238 --> 00:18:07.206
Don't go pulling any

00:18:07.273 --> 00:18:09.010
of your famous funny business.

00:18:09.077 --> 00:18:11.816
I didn't come all
the way here for you.

00:18:11.883 --> 00:18:13.352
[Shinji] Fair warning, though.

00:18:13.419 --> 00:18:15.189
Thinking you can take
me on would be

00:18:15.256 --> 00:18:17.360
the last mistake
you'd ever make.

00:18:20.333 --> 00:18:22.938
[laughs]
You're scared, aren't you?

00:18:23.005 --> 00:18:25.911
Well, this guy's a servant
who did away with Berserker

00:18:25.978 --> 00:18:27.514
without even breaking a sweat.

00:18:27.581 --> 00:18:30.019
I guess I'd be pretty scared,
too, if I were you.

00:18:30.086 --> 00:18:31.856
[Archer] You want Rin.
Is that it?

00:18:31.923 --> 00:18:33.392
Uh, huh?

00:18:33.459 --> 00:18:35.296
Yeah, of course I do.

00:18:35.697 --> 00:18:38.135
Then you'll wait until
my business is done.

00:18:38.637 --> 00:18:41.676
You can have her once I finish
with Shirou Emiya.

00:18:41.976 --> 00:18:43.379
[Archer] If you refuse,

00:18:43.445 --> 00:18:46.451
I'll be forced to eliminate
both you and your servant.

00:18:47.086 --> 00:18:48.355
Will you?

00:18:49.257 --> 00:18:51.161
Now hold on, Gilgamesh.

00:18:51.228 --> 00:18:52.463
It's all right.

00:18:52.531 --> 00:18:54.467
Let's take Archer here
at his word.

00:18:54.535 --> 00:18:57.841
You and I will stay here
and keep Tohsaka safe

00:18:57.908 --> 00:18:59.545
until he's taken care of Emiya.

00:18:59.612 --> 00:19:03.586
Oh, guess that means
she's already as good as mine,

00:19:03.653 --> 00:19:06.526
and if she's mine,
I can do what I want to her.

00:19:06.592 --> 00:19:08.897
She will remain unharmed
for now,

00:19:08.963 --> 00:19:13.038
as per my agreement with Shirou,
but that will expire at dawn.

00:19:13.105 --> 00:19:14.441
[Archer] When day breaks,

00:19:14.508 --> 00:19:16.813
you are free to do
with her as you will.

00:19:17.748 --> 00:19:21.889
[laughing]

00:19:21.956 --> 00:19:23.392
Did you hear that, Tohsaka?

00:19:23.459 --> 00:19:25.864
[Shinji] Your devoted servant
just sold his own master

00:19:25.931 --> 00:19:26.866
down the river!

00:19:32.878 --> 00:19:34.214
Faker.

00:19:45.236 --> 00:19:46.371
[groans]

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:48.475
[Saber] Are you awake?

00:19:49.444 --> 00:19:50.881
Good morning.

00:19:51.549 --> 00:19:54.187
Hey.
My headache's finally gone,

00:19:54.254 --> 00:19:55.791
and so's the fatigue.

00:19:56.425 --> 00:19:58.195
[Shirou] My mana's still
pretty low,

00:19:58.262 --> 00:19:59.832
but I don't think
my magic circuits

00:19:59.899 --> 00:20:01.502
are burned out,
so that's good.

00:20:03.472 --> 00:20:05.042
[Saber] Shirou.

00:20:05.476 --> 00:20:07.480
Rin is my master now,

00:20:07.548 --> 00:20:09.952
and rescuing her
is my sacred duty.

00:20:10.654 --> 00:20:13.358
I will stop Archer myself.
As for you‐‐

00:20:13.425 --> 00:20:14.260
[Shirou]
You've got it backwards.

00:20:14.327 --> 00:20:15.429
[gasps]

00:20:15.496 --> 00:20:17.066
[Shirou] Just leave Archer
to me.

00:20:17.133 --> 00:20:19.104
You cannot do that, Shirou.

00:20:19.572 --> 00:20:21.007
After all,
Archer is‐‐

00:20:21.074 --> 00:20:22.343
Yeah, I know.

00:20:22.845 --> 00:20:25.082
I've probably known
since we met.

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:27.654
So you don't have
to explain it to me.

00:20:27.721 --> 00:20:30.861
And that's why he has
to pay for his actions.

00:20:32.196 --> 00:20:33.499
I've got to end this.

00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:36.004
Even if it kills me,
it has to stop.

00:20:36.471 --> 00:20:39.477
[Shirou] So please,
let me fight Archer.

00:20:39.845 --> 00:20:40.914
And when I do,

00:20:40.981 --> 00:20:43.452
I want you to stay out
of it no matter what.

00:20:45.122 --> 00:20:49.464
If that is truly what you want,
I will abide by your request.

00:20:50.901 --> 00:20:53.773
I swore an oath that my body
would be your shield.

00:20:54.441 --> 00:20:57.781
But I will observe until
the fight is decided.

00:20:58.583 --> 00:21:00.720
Thank you.
I mean it.

00:21:06.866 --> 00:21:07.835
[gasps]

00:21:07.901 --> 00:21:10.974
You do have better things
to do, don't you?

00:21:12.143 --> 00:21:14.180
[Lancer] I've changed my mind.

00:21:14.748 --> 00:21:16.786
The little lady's in trouble,
right?

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:19.692
Maybe I should tag along
for a while.

00:21:20.126 --> 00:21:22.230
I'd sleep easier that way.

00:21:22.965 --> 00:21:25.637
What did you and Rin do
to secure his allegiance?

00:21:25.704 --> 00:21:27.808
What manner
of spell did you use?

00:21:27.875 --> 00:21:28.877
[grunts]

00:21:30.045 --> 00:21:31.481
