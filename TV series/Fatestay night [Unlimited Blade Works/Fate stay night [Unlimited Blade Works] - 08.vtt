00:04:30.508 --> 00:04:33.113

00:04:48.611 --> 00:04:51.282

didn't you?

00:05:12.024 --> 00:05:14.161

say that?

00:05:14.696 --> 00:05:16.533

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.704
If one summons
a mage more powerful

00:05:18.771 --> 00:05:20.608
than himself,
he would be on guard,

00:05:20.675 --> 00:05:23.346
even with command seals.
Given that,

00:05:23.413 --> 00:05:24.516
it's difficult
to think that

00:09:13.005 --> 00:09:14.208
[snarls]

00:09:14.809 --> 00:09:16.045
[both grunting]

00:09:18.884 --> 00:09:19.853
Amazing.

00:09:24.629 --> 00:09:27.502
I am the bone of my sword.

00:09:27.568 --> 00:09:28.804
[groans]

00:09:31.175 --> 00:09:32.545
Caladbolg!

00:09:33.012 --> 00:09:33.947
[gasps]

00:09:36.085 --> 00:09:38.122
[screams]

00:09:43.032 --> 00:09:44.769
It seems that my master
could not defeat

00:09:44.836 --> 00:09:46.506
the opponent as planned.

00:09:46.573 --> 00:09:48.242
[Assassin] My own master
is in peril

00:09:48.309 --> 00:09:51.750
so I no longer have the luxury
of concealing my true skill.

00:09:51.817 --> 00:09:54.522
Even now you will not reveal
your noble phantasm?

00:09:54.589 --> 00:09:55.691
[grunts]

00:09:55.758 --> 00:09:57.427
Your master is a novice

00:09:57.494 --> 00:09:58.597
so you must be counting

00:09:58.664 --> 00:10:00.701
on the strength of his luck
to win.

00:10:00.768 --> 00:10:02.471
Your faith is admirable.

00:10:02.538 --> 00:10:05.477
Half‐hearted measures from me
will not put a dent in that.

00:10:05.544 --> 00:10:07.047
[gasps]

00:10:07.582 --> 00:10:09.619
However, that simply won't do.

00:10:09.686 --> 00:10:11.890
You yield the advantage
of higher ground?

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:13.226
What are you playing at?

00:10:13.292 --> 00:10:15.029
Although I may not
be well known,

00:10:15.096 --> 00:10:16.867
I devoted my life
to the sword.

00:10:16.933 --> 00:10:19.004
If you insist on not showing
your strength,

00:10:19.071 --> 00:10:21.676
I'll take your belief
and break it open

00:10:21.743 --> 00:10:23.012
with brute force.

00:10:23.079 --> 00:10:24.047
[gasps]

00:10:25.551 --> 00:10:26.686
Ultimate!

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:28.356
[gasps]

00:10:30.761 --> 00:10:31.663
[booming]
[grunts]

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:32.999
Swallow reversal!

00:10:33.065 --> 00:10:34.234
Too late!

00:10:37.107 --> 00:10:38.977
[sparking]
[clattering]

00:10:44.454 --> 00:10:48.997
[whimpering]

00:10:49.064 --> 00:10:50.333
[gasps]

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.308
Archer, why?
Why do you not finish me off?

00:10:54.374 --> 00:10:55.811
[gasps]

00:10:55.878 --> 00:10:58.216
[Archer] I said I
would make one scratch.

00:10:58.282 --> 00:11:01.288
[groaning]

00:11:01.355 --> 00:11:02.457
[gasps]

00:11:02.525 --> 00:11:04.562
[Caster] So you do not intend
to kill me, then?

00:11:04.629 --> 00:11:05.598
[gasps]

00:11:05.664 --> 00:11:07.400
My objective here was

00:11:07.467 --> 00:11:09.104
to protect this boy from you.

00:11:09.171 --> 00:11:12.210
My policy is to avoid
unnecessary fighting.

00:11:12.277 --> 00:11:13.346
[gasps]
Hey!

00:11:13.412 --> 00:11:16.318
[laughing]

00:11:16.385 --> 00:11:17.555
[Caster] I see!

00:11:17.622 --> 00:11:20.126
You and the boy must be birds
of a feather, then.

00:11:20.193 --> 00:11:21.563
[both] Huh?

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:23.165
That boy cannot abide servants

00:11:23.232 --> 00:11:25.571
like me who feed
on irrelevant people,

00:11:25.638 --> 00:11:27.440
or that stray
from his naive sense

00:11:27.508 --> 00:11:28.544
of morality,

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:29.979
and you simply do not care

00:11:30.046 --> 00:11:31.181
for senseless slaughter.

00:11:31.248 --> 00:11:33.987
You see?
You are completely alike!

00:11:34.054 --> 00:11:36.660
How am I anything
like this stupid jerk?

00:11:36.726 --> 00:11:37.995
Yes, I agree.

00:11:38.062 --> 00:11:39.732
[Archer] I admit we
are both pacifists

00:11:39.799 --> 00:11:41.101
but we are fundamentally
different

00:11:41.168 --> 00:11:41.970
from each other.

00:11:42.037 --> 00:11:43.674
You're a pacifist,
my ass!

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:45.310
[Shirou] I guess you must
have forgotten

00:11:45.376 --> 00:11:47.848
how you tried to take out Saber
along with Berserker!

00:11:47.915 --> 00:11:49.051
That was before you

00:11:49.117 --> 00:11:50.854
and Rin entered into
this alliance.

00:11:50.921 --> 00:11:52.758
[Archer] Surely
you don't expect me

00:11:52.825 --> 00:11:55.163
to save everything I see
that might need saving.

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:56.332
[grunts]

00:11:56.398 --> 00:11:57.835
If I thought that way,

00:11:57.902 --> 00:12:00.240
even Berserker would be someone
to save.

00:12:00.306 --> 00:12:03.279
[laughing]

00:12:03.346 --> 00:12:04.582
I like you two.

00:12:04.649 --> 00:12:08.122
Your powers and existences
are both unique and interesting.

00:12:08.189 --> 00:12:10.661
‐ Huh?
‐ [Caster] Join forces with me.

00:12:10.728 --> 00:12:12.063
I have a strategy that will put

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:14.201
an end
to this Grail War quickly.

00:12:14.268 --> 00:12:15.470
No, never!

00:12:15.537 --> 00:12:18.142
There's no way I'd ever work
with people like you.

00:12:19.244 --> 00:12:20.113
[grunts]

00:12:20.179 --> 00:12:21.917
[Shirou] Hey, Archer,
come on!

00:12:22.484 --> 00:12:23.720
I'll pass.

00:12:24.087 --> 00:12:26.726
Your team has very limited
fighting potential.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.997
No matter how much power
you gain,

00:12:29.064 --> 00:12:31.068
it won't be enough
to beat Berserker.

00:12:31.135 --> 00:12:34.074
What you offer isn't enough
to ally myself with you.

00:12:34.141 --> 00:12:35.143
I see.

00:12:35.209 --> 00:12:37.515
Negotiations have broken down,
then?

00:12:37.581 --> 00:12:38.817
Yes.

00:12:39.318 --> 00:12:42.457
Besides, I decided to come here
on my own initiative.

00:12:42.525 --> 00:12:46.098
My master did not send me
so I have no reason to kill you.

00:12:46.165 --> 00:12:49.004
Shall we call this a draw
on account of injury?

00:12:49.071 --> 00:12:49.839
Hey!

00:12:49.906 --> 00:12:51.342
I'm surprised.

00:12:51.408 --> 00:12:53.346
Your master has been
actively hunting me,

00:12:53.412 --> 00:12:54.582
has she not?

00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:57.487
Yet you would simply let me go
just like that?

00:12:57.555 --> 00:12:58.724
Yes.

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:00.794
It it really no concern of mine

00:13:00.861 --> 00:13:02.765
how many people
you end up killing here.

00:13:02.832 --> 00:13:04.434
Oh!

00:13:04.502 --> 00:13:06.305
What a terrible man you are.

00:13:08.209 --> 00:13:09.779
Wait a minute!
Stop!

00:13:14.321 --> 00:13:15.356
[gasps]

00:13:17.595 --> 00:13:20.567
[Shirou] Why the hell
did you let Caster go?

00:13:21.101 --> 00:13:23.339
Even if I had tried
to strike her down just now,

00:13:23.406 --> 00:13:25.410
she would have made
her escape anyway.

00:13:25.911 --> 00:13:28.984
To defeat Caster,
we must get to her master.

00:13:29.652 --> 00:13:31.055
[Shirou shudders]

00:13:31.121 --> 00:13:33.125
Yeah, but she's the one behind

00:13:33.192 --> 00:13:34.996
all the people
in comas right now.

00:13:35.063 --> 00:13:36.733
Until we stop her,

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.469
victims are gonna keep
piling up.

00:13:38.537 --> 00:13:40.106
On the contrary,

00:13:40.173 --> 00:13:42.344
I want to let her continue
for a while longer.

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:43.379
[gasps]

00:13:43.446 --> 00:13:45.216
Caster will go on
draining people

00:13:45.283 --> 00:13:47.387
of their life force
and will use that power

00:13:47.454 --> 00:13:48.724
to defeat Berserker.

00:13:49.257 --> 00:13:52.263
Then after she's done that,
we take Caster out.

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.602
Tohsaka would never agree
with that plan!

00:13:54.669 --> 00:13:55.838
You're right.

00:13:55.904 --> 00:13:57.240
She would hate it,

00:13:57.307 --> 00:14:00.246
which is why I want Caster
to settle things quickly.

00:14:00.313 --> 00:14:02.417
I don't know how many
will have to die,

00:14:02.484 --> 00:14:04.789
but humans are mortal creatures,
after all.

00:14:04.856 --> 00:14:07.762
[Archer] No matter how
or at who's hands death comes,

00:14:07.828 --> 00:14:09.297
it's all the same.
‐ [Shirou grunts]

00:14:10.701 --> 00:14:11.936
[grunts]

00:14:13.305 --> 00:14:14.274
[gasps]

00:14:16.679 --> 00:14:19.519
Very impressive.
You dodged well.

00:14:19.585 --> 00:14:20.788
[grunts]

00:14:21.155 --> 00:14:23.960
It is not all that special,
as tricks go.

00:14:24.394 --> 00:14:26.398
It is simply something
I mastered one day

00:14:26.465 --> 00:14:28.503
when I had the thought
to slay a sparrow.

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:31.676
[Assassin] A flying sparrow
cannot be snared by my sword

00:14:31.743 --> 00:14:33.112
which is but a single line,

00:14:33.179 --> 00:14:35.551
but with two
or three lines attacking,

00:14:35.617 --> 00:14:37.521
that changes matters entirely.

00:14:37.588 --> 00:14:39.959
However,
they are swift little things.

00:14:40.026 --> 00:14:41.495
To accomplish the feat,

00:14:41.563 --> 00:14:44.936
one must repeatedly strike
within time of a single breath.

00:14:45.002 --> 00:14:47.440
That is beyond the ability
of ordinary men.

00:14:49.311 --> 00:14:51.850
But I had nothing else
to do but to practice

00:14:51.916 --> 00:14:52.985
and master the skill.

00:14:53.052 --> 00:14:54.054
In other words,

00:14:54.121 --> 00:14:56.325
I achieved a goal
I had wished for.

00:14:57.695 --> 00:14:59.732
I used the technique
without knowing it.

00:14:59.799 --> 00:15:02.237
[Saber] Repeatedly strike within
<i>a single breath?</i>

00:15:02.303 --> 00:15:04.174
<i>That is not what that was.</i>

00:15:04.241 --> 00:15:06.345
<i>They were at exactly</i>
<i>the same time.</i>

00:15:06.412 --> 00:15:08.850
<i>In that instant,</i>
<i>three swords existed.</i>

00:15:09.351 --> 00:15:10.888
<i>It is hard to believe,</i>
<i>but that was...</i>

00:15:11.956 --> 00:15:13.860
A dimensional refraction effect.

00:15:14.294 --> 00:15:16.365
How does a servant
with only sword skills get

00:15:16.432 --> 00:15:19.271
a noble phantasm without
employing any magic at all?

00:15:24.682 --> 00:15:26.553
Caster is a softie.

00:15:26.619 --> 00:15:29.357
She should just go drain
their lives completely.

00:15:29.424 --> 00:15:31.462
If everyone in the city
were to die,

00:15:31.529 --> 00:15:33.232
it would be much easier
to fight.

00:15:33.299 --> 00:15:35.671
[Shirou] Damn you!
[grunts]

00:15:35.737 --> 00:15:38.442
[gasping]

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:39.377
I thought that you and I

00:15:39.444 --> 00:15:41.516
were operating under
an alliance.

00:15:41.583 --> 00:15:42.818
That's a load of crap!

00:15:42.885 --> 00:15:44.555
I'm not doing that!

00:15:44.622 --> 00:15:47.127
Like I would even think
of sacrificing the lives

00:15:47.193 --> 00:15:48.864
of everyone around me in order

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:50.734
to achieve
some personal victory!

00:15:50.801 --> 00:15:54.274
I feel exactly the same way,
Shirou Emiya,

00:15:54.341 --> 00:15:57.347
but it's not possible
to save every last person.

00:15:57.815 --> 00:16:00.186
If Caster were to get control
of the Grail,

00:16:00.253 --> 00:16:02.892
the damage would not be limited
to this city.

00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:04.461
If we don't win this war,

00:16:04.529 --> 00:16:06.599
the damage
will affect everywhere.

00:16:06.666 --> 00:16:08.670
[Archer] Therefore
the only choice

00:16:08.737 --> 00:16:11.074
is to sacrifice the people
of the city.

00:16:11.141 --> 00:16:13.012
If we can keep
the overall losses low

00:16:13.078 --> 00:16:15.183
as a result,
it's the same as your strategy,

00:16:15.249 --> 00:16:16.886
isn't it?
‐ [shudders]

00:16:16.953 --> 00:16:21.395
Choosing to save someone means
choosing not to save another.

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:23.465
You've said you didn't want

00:16:23.533 --> 00:16:25.469
to get irrelevant
people involved.

00:16:26.471 --> 00:16:27.741
Then admit it.

00:16:28.209 --> 00:16:30.379
If you try
to avoid killing anyone,

00:16:30.446 --> 00:16:32.718
you won't save anyone
in the end.

00:16:32.785 --> 00:16:33.720
[grunts]

00:16:37.126 --> 00:16:39.532
Do you plan to go after Caster?

00:16:40.333 --> 00:16:42.337
[Archer] To waste your life
after I saved it?

00:16:42.403 --> 00:16:43.305
Bite me!

00:16:43.372 --> 00:16:44.675
To hell with your help!

00:16:44.742 --> 00:16:46.846
Even if you offered it now,
I wouldn't take it!

00:16:46.913 --> 00:16:50.621
[Archer] Well, you not liking me
makes this easier.

00:16:57.935 --> 00:16:59.004
[gasps]

00:16:59.237 --> 00:17:01.275

[Shirou] Son of a‐‐
[grunts]

00:17:32.103 --> 00:17:33.272
[Archer] If you've no will
to fight,

00:17:33.339 --> 00:17:35.076
then die here and now.

00:17:35.142 --> 00:17:37.948

[Archer] Spending
your life fighting

00:17:39.351 --> 00:17:42.423
for others and not yourself
is nothing but hypocrisy.

00:17:42.858 --> 00:17:46.532
Peace is what your desire is,
not victory,

00:17:46.599 --> 00:17:49.170

no such thing in this world

00:17:49.237 --> 00:17:50.707

00:17:53.813 --> 00:17:55.082
Goodbye, Shirou.

00:17:55.149 --> 00:17:57.755

to your death.

[grunts]

00:18:16.659 --> 00:18:20.032
[Saber] Assassin, why did you
not strike me down just now?

00:18:20.567 --> 00:18:23.372
I was captivated,
I suppose.

00:18:23.439 --> 00:18:25.376
You are attractive
when you are fighting,

00:18:25.443 --> 00:18:28.349
but your concern for your master
is an exquisite sight,

00:18:28.415 --> 00:18:30.520
and so you caught my eyes.

00:18:33.158 --> 00:18:34.996
That is enough fighting
for tonight.

00:18:35.329 --> 00:18:36.633
You may both leave.

00:18:37.066 --> 00:18:38.770
[Saber] So you
are letting us go?

00:18:38.837 --> 00:18:40.172
[Assassin] I am indeed.

00:18:40.239 --> 00:18:42.544
Finding a worthy opponent
is a rare thing.

00:18:42.811 --> 00:18:44.582
I could not bring myself
to defeat you

00:18:44.649 --> 00:18:46.451
if you were not in peak form.

00:18:46.519 --> 00:18:49.659
Or do you consider this a debt,
Saber?

00:18:49.725 --> 00:18:52.564
Yes, of course,
Kojirou Sasaki.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:54.835
Please forgive me.

00:18:54.902 --> 00:18:58.075
You are an opponent worthy
of my full attention.

00:18:58.142 --> 00:18:59.344
[chuckles]

00:18:59.712 --> 00:19:02.283
[Saber] Rest assured
I will settle matters with you.

00:19:02.785 --> 00:19:05.489
Regardless of the outcome
of the Holy Grail War.

00:19:05.757 --> 00:19:06.726
I swear it.

You would stand in my way,

00:19:16.879 --> 00:19:19.250
You took the words out
of my mouth.

00:19:19.685 --> 00:19:22.658
I said that they may leave.
Will you make a liar of me?

00:19:22.725 --> 00:19:25.429
My only duty is to stand watch
at this gate.

00:19:25.496 --> 00:19:27.835
I allowed entry,
but leaving is something else.

00:19:27.901 --> 00:19:29.772
[Assassin] Your head
lacks elegance,

00:19:29.839 --> 00:19:32.611
but I shall satisfy myself
by claiming it tonight.

00:19:32.678 --> 00:19:34.782
[Archer] You really think
you can defeat me,

00:19:34.849 --> 00:19:36.451
Caster's lackey?

00:19:36.519 --> 00:19:38.155
I could ask the same.

00:19:38.222 --> 00:19:40.827
I let you win there in order
to give the vixen a bit

00:19:40.894 --> 00:19:41.996
of a healthy scare,

00:19:42.063 --> 00:19:44.234
so imagine my disappointment
to see you flee

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:45.637

allowed Caster to escape?

he's no better than Caster,

aren't you angry at Archer

00:22:01.809 --> 00:22:03.278
for breaking the alliance
and attacking you

00:22:03.345 --> 00:22:04.247

It's Tohsaka I'm allies with,

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.670

Caster is an enemy

that Archer is nefarious.

didn't you, Shirou?

His technique was as pure
as a clear stream.

as pure.
