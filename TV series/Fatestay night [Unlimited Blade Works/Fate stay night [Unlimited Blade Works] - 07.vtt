00:09:59.398 --> 00:10:01.168
[Rin] There really is one there.

00:10:01.603 --> 00:10:02.972
I'm impressed.

00:10:03.473 --> 00:10:04.809
That's a sigil, right?

00:10:04.876 --> 00:10:06.880
Yes.
You know, Emiya,

00:10:06.947 --> 00:10:08.851
for a guy with no sensitivity
to mana,

00:10:08.917 --> 00:10:10.220
you can sense
something off about

00:10:10.286 --> 00:10:11.523
a place fast.

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:14.996
[magical whooshing]

00:10:15.497 --> 00:10:18.069

00:10:18.436 --> 00:10:19.973
<i>[Shirou] When all this</i>
<i>first started,</i>

00:10:20.039 --> 00:10:22.545
<i>you didn't think I was a mage,</i>
<i>either, remember?</i>

00:10:22.945 --> 00:10:24.682
<i>What was up with that?</i>

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.822
[Rin] Really?
Do you want me to spell it out?

00:10:27.889 --> 00:10:29.424
<i>[Shirou] No, forget it.</i>

00:10:29.491 --> 00:10:31.228
<i>I can pretty much guess.</i>

00:10:31.495 --> 00:10:32.698
<i>[Rin] Clever boy.</i>

00:10:32.765 --> 00:10:34.636
<i>Oh, and it's exactly</i>
<i>what you think.</i>

00:10:35.236 --> 00:10:38.075
<i>Mages only recognize people</i>
<i>that exhibit a minimum level</i>

00:10:38.142 --> 00:10:40.848
<i>of mana as actually</i>
<i>being mages themselves.</i>

00:10:41.215 --> 00:10:43.252
<i>[Shirou] I figured it</i>
<i>would be something like that.</i>

00:10:47.662 --> 00:10:51.202
[Rin] Well, that should be most
of the active sigils.

00:10:51.268 --> 00:10:52.772
[Shirou] You were able
to disable

00:10:52.839 --> 00:10:54.174
the bounded field, then?

00:10:54.241 --> 00:10:56.980
No, the field itself
is already in place,

00:10:57.047 --> 00:10:59.051
so all I did was weaken it.

00:10:59.117 --> 00:11:01.055
[Rin] Look at the kind
of field this guy put up.

00:11:01.121 --> 00:11:04.361
He won't stand by and do nothing
when he discovers this.

00:11:04.428 --> 00:11:06.198
So if I'm guessing right,

00:11:06.265 --> 00:11:08.336
he'll reveal himself
by tomorrow.

00:11:08.402 --> 00:11:10.708
Oh?
He will, will he?

00:11:13.379 --> 00:11:14.414

00:11:16.753 --> 00:11:18.222
So anyway...

00:11:18.624 --> 00:11:19.893
I have other business
to tend to,

00:11:19.959 --> 00:11:21.563
so I'm heading home.

00:11:22.197 --> 00:11:23.600
[Rin] There are a number
of supplies

00:11:23.667 --> 00:11:25.403
I'm going to need
to buy for tomorrow.

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:28.042
You should head home
early today, too, Emiya.

00:11:28.342 --> 00:11:29.444
Hey, wait a minute.

00:11:29.512 --> 00:11:31.816
Are you saying you're worried
about me, Tohsaka?

00:11:32.117 --> 00:11:33.185
What?

00:11:33.419 --> 00:11:34.989
No, I‐‐I'm not!

00:11:35.056 --> 00:11:37.394
You and I have an alliance now
so if you just go off

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.899
and do as you please,
it'll mess up all my plans.

00:11:39.966 --> 00:11:41.168
That's all that was.

00:11:41.235 --> 00:11:43.172
I just said it
to be perfectly clear.

00:11:43.507 --> 00:11:44.676
[Rin scoffs]

00:11:50.988 --> 00:11:54.061
[Shinji] Heading home after
a long, weary day, Emiya?

00:11:54.127 --> 00:11:56.432
Sigil erasing can be tedious.

00:11:56.498 --> 00:11:57.969
[chuckles]

00:11:58.336 --> 00:11:59.438
What did you say?

00:11:59.806 --> 00:12:03.012
The bounded field that you've
been erasing by brute force

00:12:03.079 --> 00:12:05.684
is an insurance policy
I set up for myself.

00:12:05.751 --> 00:12:08.456
Shinji.
Why am I not surprised?

00:12:08.523 --> 00:12:11.395
[Shinji] Oh,
don't be so on edge, Emiya.

00:12:11.462 --> 00:12:12.965
Just like you,

00:12:13.032 --> 00:12:15.704
I don't have any mana
but they're making me a master.

00:12:16.573 --> 00:12:18.510
What's the story
with that field?

00:12:18.577 --> 00:12:21.282
I told you.
It's just a little insurance.

00:12:21.683 --> 00:12:24.254
Are you the one who attacked
that girl yesterday?

00:12:25.223 --> 00:12:27.895
Fact is,
I didn't have any choice.

00:12:27.962 --> 00:12:30.768
My servant did that stuff
all on her own.

00:12:31.235 --> 00:12:34.007
[Shinji] Oh, come on, Emiya.
You have to believe me.

00:12:34.074 --> 00:12:36.245
The last thing I wanna do
is fight anybody.

00:12:36.312 --> 00:12:37.447
[grunts]

00:12:37.515 --> 00:12:39.017
All right, then.

00:12:39.552 --> 00:12:40.420
[Shinji] Wait a minute, Emiya.

00:12:41.121 --> 00:12:42.892
Will you team up with me?

00:12:42.959 --> 00:12:44.762
We Matous have been
a mage family

00:12:44.829 --> 00:12:47.067
for a very long time.

00:12:47.133 --> 00:12:48.436
What?
You have?

00:12:48.503 --> 00:12:49.639
Of course.

00:12:49.706 --> 00:12:51.141
It's no surprise
that you wouldn't know

00:12:51.208 --> 00:12:53.145
since you're not a proper mage.

00:12:53.212 --> 00:12:56.085
If you don't believe me,
ask your friend Tohsaka.

00:12:56.686 --> 00:12:57.888
[Shirou] Shinji,

00:12:57.955 --> 00:13:00.026
does Sakura know
about what you are?

00:13:00.561 --> 00:13:03.332
Mage families only hand down
their secret arts

00:13:03.399 --> 00:13:04.802
to the eldest son.

00:13:05.069 --> 00:13:06.940
As if anybody
would teach sorcery

00:13:07.007 --> 00:13:08.610
to that dunce of a girl.

00:13:08.977 --> 00:13:10.881
So, what do you say?

00:13:11.415 --> 00:13:13.252
If you aren't going
to do anything,

00:13:13.319 --> 00:13:15.456
I have no reason
to work with you, right?

00:13:17.127 --> 00:13:18.530
Oh?

00:13:18.597 --> 00:13:20.466
So you won't work with me, huh?

00:13:21.101 --> 00:13:23.807
Emiya, be serious.

00:13:23.874 --> 00:13:26.178
Are you actually going
to try to win?

00:13:26.713 --> 00:13:27.815
[gasps]

00:13:28.182 --> 00:13:30.486
[Shinji] I see.
If so,

00:13:30.554 --> 00:13:32.558
I can't leave my sister
in the home of someone

00:13:32.625 --> 00:13:35.163
who's going to keep taking part
in this slaughter.

00:13:35.229 --> 00:13:36.198
Fine.

00:13:36.265 --> 00:13:38.770
I'll tell Sakura myself
when I get home.

00:13:38.837 --> 00:13:40.039
[Shinji] Okay.

00:13:40.106 --> 00:13:41.609
It's so nice that you're such

00:13:41.676 --> 00:13:43.312
a caring friend to her.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.584
What we discussed here
is between you and me,

00:13:45.651 --> 00:13:47.020
understand?

00:13:47.087 --> 00:13:49.124
The reason I decided
to come clean with you

00:13:49.191 --> 00:13:51.362
was out of respect
for our friendship.

00:13:51.863 --> 00:13:53.399
Yeah, I'll keep quiet.

00:14:49.144 --> 00:14:50.681
[Shirou] Yeah, what is it?

00:14:50.748 --> 00:14:54.254
Nothing except that
I sensed mana in here.

00:14:54.622 --> 00:14:55.758
You were training?

00:14:55.824 --> 00:14:57.127
Yeah.

00:14:57.193 --> 00:14:59.866
Basically I come here
and do this every day.

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:02.103
May I enter and join you?

00:15:02.738 --> 00:15:04.074
Okay.

00:15:04.374 --> 00:15:06.713
[Saber] I understand
that your magical specialty

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:08.048
is strengthening.

00:15:08.115 --> 00:15:09.652
[Shirou] It's the only thing
I can do,

00:15:09.719 --> 00:15:12.525
so I'm not sure if "specialty"
is the right word.

00:15:12.858 --> 00:15:14.194
[Saber] I am curious.

00:15:14.261 --> 00:15:16.633
How does one train
in the art of strengthening?

00:15:17.033 --> 00:15:19.037
[Shirou] Well, strengthening
isn't just about

00:15:19.104 --> 00:15:21.341
simply increasing
something's toughness.

00:15:21.408 --> 00:15:24.147
It also includes increasing
its effectiveness.

00:15:25.316 --> 00:15:27.187
For this rock,
it's making it harder.

00:15:27.253 --> 00:15:28.322
For that light bulb,

00:15:28.389 --> 00:15:30.326
it's about making
it shine brighter.

00:15:30.393 --> 00:15:33.065
I visualize the object's
component materials

00:15:33.132 --> 00:15:35.136
and then concentrate as hard
as I can

00:15:35.203 --> 00:15:37.942
and focus all of my mana
to pass through it.

00:15:38.375 --> 00:15:39.411
I see.

00:15:39.478 --> 00:15:41.014
[grunts]

00:15:41.081 --> 00:15:44.187

than to tell.

00:15:44.589 --> 00:15:47.026
I'll try it on this rock.

00:15:47.093 --> 00:15:49.064

Shirou, recently I have sensed
that your concentration

00:16:18.022 --> 00:16:19.725
has been somewhat lacking.

00:16:20.561 --> 00:16:21.930
Oh, um, really?

00:18:58.342 --> 00:19:00.279
<i>You can see it,</i>
<i>can't you?</i>

00:19:00.346 --> 00:19:02.417
The mana of hundreds
of that rabble

00:19:02.483 --> 00:19:06.024
of humans out there
is stored densely in this soil.

00:19:06.091 --> 00:19:07.628
Caster!

00:19:07.695 --> 00:19:08.830
Damn you!

00:19:08.897 --> 00:19:11.769
You involved outsiders!
How could you do that?

00:19:11.836 --> 00:19:14.909
[Caster] Everyone
in this city belongs to me.

00:19:14.975 --> 00:19:16.846
No way!

00:19:16.913 --> 00:19:18.315
Well, it's been nice,

00:19:18.382 --> 00:19:20.554
but I think we've chatted
for long enough.

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:23.760
[Caster] Now let's get
those command seals off.

00:19:25.229 --> 00:19:26.365
[gasps]

00:19:27.968 --> 00:19:29.204
[buzzing]

00:19:31.943 --> 00:19:33.379
[shudders]

00:19:35.049 --> 00:19:37.387
[Saber] A bounded field
that repels the very concept

00:19:37.453 --> 00:19:38.790
of heroic spirits?

00:19:40.092 --> 00:19:41.094
[scoffs]

00:19:41.161 --> 00:19:42.631
[footsteps approaching]

00:19:45.771 --> 00:19:46.739
[gasps]

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:52.551
If I may ask,
what class of servant are you?

00:19:53.085 --> 00:19:57.060
I am Kojirou Sasaki,
assassin‐class servant.

00:19:57.126 --> 00:19:58.530
Huh?

00:19:58.596 --> 00:20:01.903
It is only natural
to name oneself before combat.

00:20:01.969 --> 00:20:03.540
When an opponent does so,

00:20:03.606 --> 00:20:06.044
I am honor‐bound as a knight
to do the same.

00:20:06.546 --> 00:20:09.017
[Saber] But once I have,
you must withdraw.

00:20:09.084 --> 00:20:10.654
‐ My name is‐‐
‐ No matter.

00:20:13.492 --> 00:20:15.897
[Assassin] My blade
will tell me all that I need

00:20:15.964 --> 00:20:17.868
to know of my enemy.

00:20:18.536 --> 00:20:23.212
If you wish to pass through here
then you must force your way in.

00:20:23.278 --> 00:20:26.184
[Shirou] You wanna take
my command seals?

00:20:26.251 --> 00:20:27.821
‐ [Caster] That's right.
‐ [winces]

00:20:28.155 --> 00:20:30.727
[Caster] I'll transplant them
into my master.

00:20:30.794 --> 00:20:32.631
Then he will have control
of Saber

00:20:32.698 --> 00:20:34.434
and she can deal
with that nuisance

00:20:34.502 --> 00:20:35.637
of a Berserker.

00:20:36.806 --> 00:20:37.908
Oh, and by the way,

00:20:37.975 --> 00:20:40.947
removing command seals
also means extracting all

00:20:41.014 --> 00:20:42.584
your magic circuits.

00:20:43.686 --> 00:20:49.732
[groaning]

00:20:52.771 --> 00:20:53.573
[winces]

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.744
[Caster] That's a good boy.

00:20:55.811 --> 00:20:58.950
I do enjoy it more
when you put up a good struggle.

00:20:59.952 --> 00:21:01.188
[gasps]

00:21:01.254 --> 00:21:02.958
[electric sparking]

00:21:03.025 --> 00:21:05.697
[screaming]

00:21:07.601 --> 00:21:09.003
[grunts]

00:21:09.204 --> 00:21:10.272
[groans]

00:21:10.507 --> 00:21:11.609
<i>[Archer scoffs]</i>

00:21:11.676 --> 00:21:13.445
I expected
to find you long dead,

00:21:13.513 --> 00:21:15.951
but you seem to have
more pluck than I thought.

00:21:17.286 --> 00:21:19.558
[Shirou] Why are you here?

00:21:21.194 --> 00:21:22.330
[grunts]

00:21:24.267 --> 00:21:26.839
Oh, I was just
in the neighborhood.

00:21:27.674 --> 00:21:29.979
So, how is your body feeling?

00:21:30.379 --> 00:21:31.949
My arrows should
have severed all

00:21:32.016 --> 00:21:33.218
of Caster's magic threads.

00:21:33.285 --> 00:21:34.522
[gasps]

00:21:34.922 --> 00:21:36.692
Yeah, I'm okay.

00:21:36.759 --> 00:21:38.428
‐ [Archer] Good for you.
‐ [gasps]

00:21:38.495 --> 00:21:40.399
As much as I'd like to say,

00:21:40.466 --> 00:21:42.604
"Do whatever the hell you want,"

00:21:42.671 --> 00:21:44.742
I suggest you stay
where you are for now.

00:21:44.809 --> 00:21:47.548
Try not to move
without thinking first.

00:21:47.614 --> 00:21:49.785
[groans]
How did the Archer get through?

00:21:49.852 --> 00:21:50.787
Dammit!

00:21:50.854 --> 00:21:51.856
That Assassin!

00:21:51.923 --> 00:21:53.760
What the hell
is he doing out there?

00:21:53.827 --> 00:21:55.029
You see?

00:21:55.095 --> 00:21:58.402
She will take the full force
of her anger out on you.

00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:01.609
A woman's fury
is a difficult thing to control.

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:04.180
Ah, damn.

00:22:04.247 --> 00:22:07.086
I think that things are about
to get rather violent.
