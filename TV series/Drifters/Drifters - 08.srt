That was close.

4
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:52,166
[YOSHITSUNE] Tragic.
You've really lost your edge.

00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,833
By all rights,
you should be a corpse.

No, that's impossible!

00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:03,083
Yoshitsune. How?

[YOSHITSUNE]
What were you thinking,

00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:14,875
What? Did you mistake
yourself for a warrior?

12
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:17,458
Remember what you did
at the Battle of Yashima?

13
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:19,125
I certainly do.

So pathetic!

19

How do you fit into all this?

24
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,958
Clearly, you're involved.

25
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:03,833
[HARUAKIRA] I'm just a man.
A man who hates the Ends.

26
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,958
I'm the leader of the
Octobrist organization

27
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:08,708
to which Olmine has
pledged her allegiance.

28
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:12,333
Giving aiding to the Drifters
ranks as first among my duties.

29
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:15,125
And, the best way I
can lend them that aid

30
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:18,208
is to destroy every
End I encounter.

31
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:21,083
I believe that you're
a Drifter your own self.

32
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:23,250
What's your name?

33
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,958
[HARUAKIRA]
Abe no Haruakira.

34
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:31,125
"Abe no Haruakira"?
You mean Abe no Seimei?

35
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:34,291
That's one way to read
the kanji of my name.

36
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:37,625
I prefer the common version,
as it keeps me grounded.

37
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:38,750
[NOBUNAGA]
Hm...

Good.

[HARUAKIRA]
Huh?

40
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:42,916
[TOYOHISA] It looks like we
won our fights all around.

41
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:47,333
I'm not in the mood
for another stranger.

Who are you?

43
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:52,416
Easy! It's Abe no Seimei.
He needs no introduction.

44
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,708
Abe no Seimei.

46
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:56,791

No clue! Let it go!

50
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,916
I pursued matters
arcane in Kyoto.

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,916
[TOYOHISA]
A fop from the capitol, then?

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,416
Your garb is odd. Is that
what passed for fashion?

53
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,916
No. I did not adopt this
uniform until my arrival here.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,541
[TOYOHISA] Just as well.
It's way too fancy for some

You'll have to excuse him.
Young people, right?

58
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,125
He'd be really
impressed if he knew.

59
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,333
Sir. Such sniffling
is quite unbecoming.

60
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:27,500
How will you conquer the Ends

61
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,625
if you can't even
conquer your own ego?

62
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:34,625
So, you were brought to this
world just as we were.

63
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,791
Sent hence by that
unflappable man

64
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:39,125
holding court
in that hallway.

65
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:42,458
[HARUAKIRA]
Yes. I never saw it coming.

[gasps]

67
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:50,250
[HARUAKIRA] The man.
He opened a portal somehow.

68
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:53,625
And in that moment,
my life began anew.

69
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,416
In time, I came to
realize my appointed task.

70
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,500
Instead of wasting
my time with imps,

71
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:03,541
or reading the night
sky for omens,

72
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:07,250
I was sent here to
destroy the Ends.

73
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,541
[NOBUNAGA]
Ah. So that hulking spearman

called Ends, I take it?

He did not go easily!

76
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,291
I assume you dealt with her.

77
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,541
I did. Knocked her into the well

78
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,291
and brained her one
for good measure.

79
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,166
Wha--?

80
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,541
You didn't finish her off, then?

00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,250
[HARUAKIRA]
Uh! Quickly!

[NOBUNAGA]
No woman.

83
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:31,666
Guess she got away. Must be
tougher than she looks.

84
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,041
[HARUAKIRA]
"Got away"?

85
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:35,833
She got away because
you didn't kill her!

That woman is an End!
They're a plague!

[TOYOHISA] Taking the head
of a woman isn't heroic.

It's shameful.

I don't care what she is!

She's a woman, but she is
an End first and foremost,

He summoned us,

but we are not the man in
the hallway's playthings.

They are brutal, yet they
hold themselves to a code.

That may be their saving grace.

The reason they were plucked
from the multitudes.

106

However, the Ends must
not be suffered to live.

109

00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:53,000
[HARUAKIRA]
Hannibal Barca, of Carthage.

113

A Drifter, like the others.

114
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:58,541
But I fear his mind has been
a clouded mirror as of late.

115
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:02,000
He's been getting worse
over the past several days.

We had another
Drifter from his era.

119
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,083
Scipio, of the mighty
Roman Empire.

120
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:13,583
The two men were bitter rivals,
but there was respect there.

121
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:16,375
Scipio's presence
kept Hannibal lucid.

Suffice it to say,
the road had its perils.

there was no chance of

Manere! Manere! Ne faceris!

160
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,750
[NAOSHI]
What the hell am I lookin' at?

161
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:44,083
Hey, you moron!
I asked you a question!

162
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,250
[SCIPIO]
Huh?

163
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,375
[NAOSHI] If you even
breathe on my plane,

164
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,583
you get my boot
straight up your ass!

165
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,416
Huh? Some white guy?

166
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,166
You better not be
a fuckin' American!

167
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,875
Speak up, ya
blonde-haired dickbag.

168
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:00,000
But if you are an American,
I'm gonna kick your fucking ass!

169
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,750
Got it, asshole?

170
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,875
[SCIPIO] He certainly is a
belligerent one, this savage.

171
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,458
I can hardly believe
he's got the mind

172
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,083
to have flown that
odd device over

173
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,875
the Battle at the Wall
to such great effect.

174
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:14,666
Could it be? This bellowing
baboon is a fellow Drifter?

175
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,458
His words hold no meaning!
It's all'a so staccato!

176
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:20,208
From where does he hail?
And why are his eyes like that?

177
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,333
Look at those scribbles
that pass for writing!

178
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,125
But of course he
can't speak Latin,

179
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:27,125
lingua franca of
the civilized world!

180
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,500
His tribe must live beyond
the cartographer's ken,

181
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:30,666
the poor devil.

182
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,500
Still, there's no way
this howling beast

183
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:35,958
has not heard the name
of my motherland!

184
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:39,000
Roma!

185
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,708
Roma, huh?

186
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,083
Uh...

187
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,541
[gasps]

188
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,500
[BOTH chuckle]

189
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,541
Tandem intelligere.

190
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,416
[SCIPIO]
O Rome, the mere mention of you

191
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,625
forges bonds of
brotherhood eternal!

192
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:02,041
You assholes surrendered!

193
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,875
You abandoned the Axis right
when it needed you most,

194
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:06,750
you rat-bastard!

195
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:09,666
[WOLF MAN A] Well, looks like
the sky-god is angry again.

196
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,625
Why couldn't a friendly god have
come? This one frightens me.

197
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:14,541
You moron!

198
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,833
[SCIPIO]
Non barbarus!

199
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,458
[NAOSHI] That is it! You're
gonna apologize to Germany,

200
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:20,916
you toga-wearing asshole,

201
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,083
if I have to break
every bone in your body!

202
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,375
What is this odd cylinder?

203
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,291
That there's a cartridge.

204
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,666
"Cartridge"?

205
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,291
My word, we got a neophyte.

206
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:42,125
Beggin' your pardon. I done
forgot you're right ancient.

207
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,916
First you pack
in the gunpowder,

208
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,833
and top it all off
with the killin' bit.

209
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,750
The cartridge goes
in the chamber,

210
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,125
hammer hits the primer
when the trigger's pulled.

211
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,458
And if you're lucky,

212
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:53,958
you've let the daylight
into some murderous cuss.

213
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,250
[chuckles]

214
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,666
--[KID] What the...?
--[gunshots continue]

215
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:02,875
[KID] Don't go wastin' bullets!
You loco som'bitch!

216
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,375
[chuckles]

217
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,958
[NOBUNAGA]
And that one there?

218
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,708
The one that tore
the giant to pieces?

219
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:12,291
How did you manage
to fire it so fast?

220
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,416
That's called a Gatlin' gun.

221
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,250
Turn the crank,
and watch 'em fall down.

222
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:21,750
Heh. So much scrap iron,
now we're outta magazines.

223
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,791
[BUTCH]
Hey pardner, feelin' sickly?

224
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:24,958
[BOTH]
Huh?

225
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,458
[NOBUNAGA]
Ha. Glad I had already started

226
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:29,625
in on making gunpowder.

227
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,500
A gun like this could
change the tide

228
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:34,541
of battle like nothing
I've ever seen.

229
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:35,708
We could take down armies

230
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:38,833
of impossible size
with this clever thing.

231
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:41,541
Riflemen will abandon
their boxy formations

232
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,750
and attack from choke-points.

233
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:48,083
Cavalry and spearmen will
become relics of the past.

234
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:54,916
Oh! Yes! How I desire it!
No matter the price!

235
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,041
[HARUAKIRA]
That's no easy task.

236
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,666
The Octobrists have
been looking into it.

237
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,791
That gun would be the
jewel of our arsenal.

238
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,958
But we can't solve the riddle
of how to fashion them.

239
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,333
We have shown this
to many a blacksmith.

240
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:11,291
and all of them admit
it lies beyond their skill.

241
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,791
Even you, Nobunaga lived
hundreds of years

242
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,833
before these were possible.

243
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,625
And that's to say nothing
of the black powder

244
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:19,208
within the bullets.

245
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,208
These men use it
to great effect,

246
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,458
but as concerns
the alchemy of it,

247
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:26,625
they're no better-informed
than we are.

248
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,916
We're making the
powder as we speak.

249
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,958
[HARUAKIRA]
Huh?

250
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,083
[KID]
Hm?

251
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:35,375
[chuckling]

252
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:38,833
[HARUAKIRA] As I thought.
You're a man of bold ideas.

253
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:42,083
Drifters have brought new
weapons into this realm before.

254
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,500
But with your daring,

255
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:46,500
you could alter the very
course of this world's history.

256
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,500
Guess primer's
all we're lackin'.

257
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:49,875
'N what's that?

258
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:52,125
See, when you hit the
tail-end of a bullet,

259
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,208
the primer's what
sparks the powder.

260
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:55,750
It appears this substance is a

261
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,875
chemical mixture distinct
from the powder it lights.

262
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,375
We've been researching it,
but to no avail.

263
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,916
C'mon, Abe no Seimei!
Get it done!

264
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,208
I know you're good for it!

265
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,708
[HARUAKIRA] If this were
a question of magic,

266
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,291
I could be of use.

267
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:11,750
I believe a chemist is
better suited for this task.

268
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,708
Oh dear, have you
caught a cold?

269
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,875
My poor, sniffly contessa!

270
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:20,291
[BOTH] Is there no justice
in this terrible world?

271

[ELF GUARD A]
Bring it to a halt!

00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,458
Who are you with?

274
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,125
[gasps] My greetings.

275
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,250
Any chance the Drifters
are here with you?

276
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,166
[ELF GUARD C gasps]

277
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,541
[SEMU]
I'm with the Octobrists.

278
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:38,333
[MARK] Yeah, the guys
with the Bland Master!

279
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:39,875
[MASHA]
I think it's Grand.

280
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,875
[SEMU] Is anyone
here called, "Boob Dream"?

281
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:43,708
Huh?

282
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,750
Do you mean...?

283
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,750
[HARUAKIRA] You say you're
making black powder.

284
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:48,958
Is that true?

285
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,583
[NOBUNAGA]
Yes. Now we wait on sulfur.

286
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:54,375
I asked your busty
subordinate about it.

287
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,208
[SEMU]
Grand Master, sir!

[HARUAKIRA]
Semu! Why are you--?

289
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,708
I brought the sulfur,
as requested.

290
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:03,375
Olmine contacted headquarters
and requisitioned all we had.

291
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,916
It smells of old eggs.
What purpose could it serve?

292
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,833
[MARK]
Ew, farts!

Three cheers for
that top-heavy girl.

296

She did exactly as I bade.

Remind me to honk her
chest as a thank you.

298

Now we have everything.

[HARUAKIRA]
For all of his usefulness,

301
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,958
Nobunaga may be a threat.

302
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,666
I may need to put
him under watch,

303
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:37,333
lest he turn our
world atop its head.

304
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:39,583
That which makes
Drifters extraordinary

305
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:42,500
also makes it hard to
bend them to one's will.

306
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,041
The Ends act in sync.

307
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:48,125
All serving their master's
quest to destroy this world.

308
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:51,250
Our heroes are
truly a wildcard!

309
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,666
The man who created
the Orte Empire;

310
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,416
he was probably one of them.

311
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,416
The founding of the nation
was likely a noble act,

312
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,583
undertaken to help
the downtrodden.

313
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:04,125
He took a people whose
spirit had been crushed

314
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:05,583
and gave them pride.

315
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:13,541
But it emboldened them to
pursue decades of conquest.

316

For better or worse,
they're unpredictable.

317
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:20,708
I wonder if that's the reason
you've brought them here,

00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,666

319

[NOBUNAGA] Oh-ho!
Breathe in that fragrance!

320
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:30,166
[HARUAKIRA] So, Nobunaga.
What's next in your master plan?

321
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,875
Free the Elves from their
bondage, make black powder,

322
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,750
it doesn't end there.

323
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,208
I'm sure you have
something in mind, sir.

324
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,458
[NOBUNAGA]
Simple. We free the Dwarves.

325
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:40,791
[gasps]

326
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:43,416
Our forces will drift
from place to place, see.

327
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,250
Liberating the demi-humans
and then forming alliances.

328
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,625
We'll cut the Orte
off at the knees.

329
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:52,166
We'll gather manpower
and mass-produce guns

330
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,875
with which to arm them

331
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:57,458
and wipe their empire
off the face of the map!

332
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:01,375
We'll unite the tribes,
but let each people rule itself.

333
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,916
We'll keep the armies
on a leash, of course.

334
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,208
And appoint Toyohisa to lead,
like a shogun above his daimyo.

335
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,666
If our luck holds out,

336
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:14,250
we'll use the precepts of
bushido to establish order.

337
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,458
This is our path to victory.

338
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:17,875
It's the only way
we'll have enough

339
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,458

340
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,500
There's no other way
to beat the Ends.

341
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:23,916
We must have a standing army,

342
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,875
made of those we've freed
from their shackles!

343
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,500
[HARUAKIRA]
If the army's too strong,

344
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,416
then freedom will suffer for it!

345
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,250
Self-government will fail!

346
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,041
There's a danger in
what you propose!

347
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,250
Do not discount it!

348
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:39,708
It'll be a damn sight better
than what they have right now.

You wait and see, Abe no Seimei.

[HARUAKIRA] He's learned the
Elven tongue in so short a time?

Who is this man?

353
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:54,750
[NOBUNAGA] Not to brag, but I'm
a person of singular ambition.

354
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:57,541
In the end, this world will
thank me for taking charge!

355
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:00,250
All of the demi-humans will
have a place at the table!

Well-trained army.

Our nation will be a utopia!
You have my guarantee.

360
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:13,333
Why? Why do you want Toyohisa
to serve as the overlord?

361
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:16,416
What do you gain by
not doing it yourself?

362
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,916
[NOBUNAGA]
Frankly,

363
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,458
I'm not cut from the right sort
of cloth to lead a nation.

364
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,333
[NOBUNAGA] I thought by
assuming the worst of men,

365
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,416
I could see into their motives.

366
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,500
However, the hearts of men

367
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:32,625
don't seem to be
such a tidy affair.

368
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:35,750
That's why I was overthrown.

369
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:41,125
Fifty years of life and what
do I have to show for it all?

370
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:42,875
In the land of our birth,

371
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,875
when Honno-ji temple
was set to the torch

372
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:47,208
and I had to stare
betrayal in the face,

373
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,833
the person I first suspected...

374
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:52,291
...was my own son.

375
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,041
But Nobutada died in battle,

376
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:58,541
thinking he followed me
to the grave. I'm a fool.

377
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:03,500
Unfit for the mantle
of supreme leader.

378
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,208
On the other hand,

379
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:08,666
Toyohisa doesn't give a damn
about what he gains or loses!

380
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,833
He acts with brutal purity!

381

That said, he'll benefit from
wise council. Like mine.

Wait, wait, wait! Come on!

00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:48,833
Wait up, Toyohisa!

472
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:51,791
Hello, beautiful!
Is my dinner ready yet?

473
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:54,083
You already ate and I'm
still not a girl, sir!

474
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:56,333
I didn't ask for this!

475
00:22:57,791 --> 00:22:59,208
How stupid are you?!

476
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:01,875
They come because they want to,
or they don't come at all.

477
00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:04,666
It's pointless if I force them.

We're gathering men to help!
Let the villages know!

480
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:19,791
[chuckles] The lad's smarter
than I give him credit for!

00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:22,666
Boob Dream, make sure
that we're ready to embark.

Hey, One-Eyed Jack!

[NOBUNAGA]
Hm?

484
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:30,458
[BUTCH] Hell, I seen ya
lookin' at it. Call it a gift.

485
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:32,000
We're gon' leave the
Gatling gun behind,

486
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:33,666
on account of no ammo.

Even it turns out you're
able to make more

bullets like you
been talkin' 'bout,

489
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,125
maybe you could
return the kindness,

490
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:41,375
no pressure either way, mind.

491
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:45,166
All right, you rascal samurai.
Good huntin' to ya.

492
00:23:47,916 --> 00:23:52,625
[chuckles] Look at them.
Warriors down to a man!
