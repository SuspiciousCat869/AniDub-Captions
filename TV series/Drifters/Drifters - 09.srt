[hooves clomping]

3
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,000
[PEASANTS]
Huh?

4
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,583
Our lord travels
in high fashion.

5
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:23,750
Have a good journey, my lord!

6
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,750
[ALLISTER chuckles]

7
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,125
My goodness, contessa!

8
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,291
How'd an Elf make his
way into the carriage?

9
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,291
[laughs]

10
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:35,166
[SAINT GERMI] Remind me why
you insisted on coming along?

11
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,916
[ALLISTER]
Don't be like that, contessa!

12
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,875
Hogging them would
be such a cruelty!

13
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:42,375
[FULAME] We want to see those
scrumptious little Elves too!

14
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:45,125
[ALLISTER]
Not to ruin the mood, but...

15
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,166
[SAINT GERMI]
Hm?

16
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,333
I can't help but
assume the Drifters'

17
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:50,041
next target will be
the town of Gadolka.

18
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:53,541
The Dwarves imprisoned therein
would make for valuable allies.

19
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,500
[FULAME]
Mm...

20
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:58,791
Gadolka's the largest armory
within the Orte Empire.

21
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,708
I'm sure it's well-guarded.

22
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:05,750
Those Drifters are a saucy lot.
If only all the kingdom's

23
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:09,791
adversaries were
this intriguing.

24
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,833
If they take that town though,

25
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:15,333
the fall of Orte will be
a foregone conclusion.

26
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:38,333
[ORTE SOLDIER A] All of these
weapons go to the western front?

27
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,708
That's right. Seeing as
how our supply fleet

28
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,708
got sent to the
bottom of the sea.

29
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,916
Took a lot of Orte steel down
with 'em when they sank.

30
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,291
All we can do is ramp up
production to fill the loss.

31
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:52,208
The Dwarves are gonna have to
work faster than ever before.

32
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:55,166
Easier said than done,
I would wager.

33
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:59,333
[ORTE SOLDIER A] If we push
them any harder then we do now,

34
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,375
they'll drop like flies.

35
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:04,041
[ORTE SOLDIER B] Wouldn't be
the first we've worked to death.

36
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,708
[BOTH]
Huh?

37
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,583
What the hell?

38
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:16,333
Damn it all!
Did the mine collapse?

39
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,791
[NOBUNAGA] The night-soil
from the latrines,

40
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:25,333
a little sulfur from Boob Dream,
and some charcoal.

41
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,541
The perfect combination...

42
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:31,166
...for raining hell upon a foe!

43
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,250
Everything's going up!

44
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,375
Are we under attack?

45
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:34,833
[BOTH yell]

46
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,000
[ORTE SOLDIERS scream]

47
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,583
[NOBUNAGA] Flame and shrapnel
have their use, but those

48
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:50,750
explosions give us something
far simpler to exploit.

49
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:53,583
Time for battle!

50
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,208
Make sure the bastards
can hear you!

51
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:01,375
Hit them with all your rage,
then take them down!

52
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:09,291
[ELVES yelling]

53
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,541
[NOBUNAGA]
When met with the chaos

54
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:15,333
of such an assault on
the senses... men break.

55
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,958
Whether cannon-fire
or a flaming arrow,

56
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:20,500
the effect is ever the same.

57
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:24,166
Toyohisa's clan was the first
to copy the foreigner's guns.

58
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,750
Clearly, their knowledge
serves him well!

59
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,916
Kill them all!

00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,958
[ELVES yelling]

61
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,625
[ORTE SOLDIER B] That yelling!
We're under attack!

62
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:33,708
[ORTE SOLDIER C]
Is it the Elves?

63
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:34,791
Damn those Long-Ears!

00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:35,875
Get ready!

[ELF A grunts]
What a terrible concoction.

70
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:54,791
The fruits of our labors are a
devilish substance, to be sure!

71
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:57,041
See that you pour
that stuff with care!

72
00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:00,125
I'd hate for you to
blow us all to pieces!

00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:01,666
Don't lose heart, my friends.

74
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,750
Just handle it
with a light touch

75
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,000
and fire it straight
into their ranks!

00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,791
[ORTE SOLDIERS screaming]

77
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,958
[NOBUNAGA] I knew explosive
arrows would suffice,

78
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:13,916
but Yoichi and the Elves
have outdone themselves.

79
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,208
Who would've
thought that archers

80
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,083
could be the agents
of such destruction?

81
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:22,166
Kind of a shame how all those
weapons are burning to cinders.

82
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,458
We could've cut
through the Orte

83
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,625
with their own stolen steel.

84

Hell, it's a rout either way.

But it would've been
nice to have 'em.

Damned if I know!

[NOBUNAGA] Don't give your

Turn them into corpses!

We've already lost! Run for it!

Forward, men! Conquer the town!

the Armored Guard Corp, have
pledged our lives to defend!

106

You have gained nothing
by your insolence,

107
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,666
but destruction!

108
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:46,166
[TOYOHISA] Heavy armor,
heavy swords, and heavy spears.

All on foot. No bows. No arrows!

Running away? I think not!

[KAFET] I do hope Olmine

Worry not.

Those Japanese Drifters

Among your coterie,

He took sorcery
meant for defense

00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:08,541
and used it to
annihilate the enemy.

I'm sure he wasn't actually
born on a battlefield,

but you'd never know
it to watch him fight.

All the ferocity in the world

00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:13,083
Olmine said if we talk into it,
she'll be able to hear us.

161
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:17,958
Hey! Swole-mine! Hey! Can you
hear me over that chest?

162
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,625
[OLMINU]
Shut up, you!

163
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,500
Call me by name, damn it!

164
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,666
[NOBUNAGA]
Whatever! You knew who I meant!

165
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,916
You still have some
wall charms, right?

166
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,416
Proceed as I tell you,

167
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,250
and our forces will be
inside without delay!

168
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,250
Hurry! It's closing!

169
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,916
And not a moment too soon!

170
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,125
The hell did they use to
make explosions like that?

171
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:42,833
All I know is,
I lit the signal fire.

172
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:45,750
We probably won't see
reinforcements for half a day.

173
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,000
But with the gate shut tight,

174
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,416
there's no way they're
getting in before then.

175
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,833
They'll be trapped against the
very walls they want to breach.

176
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:54,416
It looks like the soldiers
outside of the gate

177
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,666
are losing their courage.

178
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,958
[ORTE SOLDIER G]
Are we all that's left?

00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,833
Damn those Long-Ears!

180
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:03,208
Soon as the reinforcements
show up, they're all dead!

[ALL gasp]

182
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,458
[MARK] It's like they're
making a staircase!

183
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:16,083
Nobunaga! You're not going
to believe it! Take a look!

184
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,583
[NOBUNAGA] Sure, the wall
charms are valuable,

185
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,958
but they can't hold a candle
to what this sphere can do.

186
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:24,416
Why dispatch a rider when you
can speak to the recipient

187
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,166
in the blink of an eye?

188
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,708
This device could
change the world,

189
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:31,625
but the magicians treat
it like any other tool.

190
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:34,250
They remain blind
to its potential,

191
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,333
accustomed as they are to them.

192
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,041
They just see
this miraculous ball

193
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:41,500
as a way to file their daily
reports from the field.

194
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:42,875
The thought that these spheres

195
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:46,125
could let armies coordinate
their attacks from afar

196
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:48,125
never even entered their heads.

197
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,166
They await.

198
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,583
Let's not disappoint them!

199
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,791
[NOBUNAGA] Same goes
for their wall charms.

200
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:56,000
Olmine will cast them to
shield Toyohisa from danger,

201
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,833
but he'd rather use one
to leap towards it.

202
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:01,916
Even now, he breaches
the castle with them.

203
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,250
Maybe that is our strength.

204
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:08,791
As outsiders, we see chances
to which they are blind.

205
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,833
What do we know of
the Ends, though?

206
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,833
Of their strength?

207
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:16,458
Are we only here to make
war upon each other?

208
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:22,000
[NOBUNAGA] We fight, but the
endgame is a riddle to us.

209
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,500
[MURASAKI]
You're right. You are outsiders.

210
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:29,250
Which means you and your fellow
Drifters see things that,

211
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,041
for good or ill,
the others cannot.

212
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,458
Go and turn the old
world on its head.

213
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:37,708
Without change, there can
be nothing but atrophy.

214
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:42,500
Break the paradigm as
only you can, Drifters.

215
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:45,500
The castle belongs to us now!

[ORTE SOLDIERS shouting]

Milord, let's free the
Dwarves right away.

218
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,291
Huh?

219
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:03,916
Ever since we were young,

220
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,916
we've been told how fiercely
the Dwarves used to fight.

221
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,708
Make no mistake,
my people despise them.

222
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,791
Our fathers would tell
dark tales of the Dwarves

223
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,750
to make us behave.

224
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,125
But at its heart.

225
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:19,000
the Elves were jealous
of all that which we lack.

226
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,125
Their strength.

227
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,083
Their dogged perseverance.

228
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,791
The axes they hefted
with such ease.

229
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:27,500
Who knows how many of
them are held captive here?

230
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:30,125
Before now, the thought
of our people ever being

231
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,958
brothers-in-arms
was inconceivable!

But the day has come!

00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:38,916
Better late than never, right?
Let's get to it!

234
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,333
[SHARA] We were told the
Dwarves were a violent bunch.

Wily savages with
beards like a pelts.

Ever eating and drinking.

237
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:49,291
Ever fighting and
seldom prone to bathe.

238
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:53,000
Their arms can crush boulders
to powder, and rule a forge.

239
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,208
Their legs pummel the
earth as they walk.

240
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:58,083
And their axes cleave
the enemy in twain.

241
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,583
When day is done,

242
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:03,166
they carouse and sing as though
that night was their last.

00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,375
Even after we Elves
surrendered to the Orte,

248
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:21,041
the Dwarves kept
resisting their invasion.

249
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:24,166
Now we see the fate of
those who refused to bend.

Life as a slave in
the mines or the forge.

had the stones.

It's just that I
don't quite know

how to describe what's
taking place here.

We freed the Dwarves,

280
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,958
but they're all so malnourished
that Toyoisa decided

281
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,458
a meal was the first
order of business.

[NOBUNAGA] Wait. You mean
to say they're eating now?

With the keep still undefeated?

284

[OLMINU] They raided the
larders, dragged it all here,

then threw it into
giant pots willy-nilly,

286

and set each one to
cook on an open fire.

Starving people overeat
and then drop dead.

taught me that.

They'll dig under the stonework.

Swear it, Drifter!

Swear that you'll keep your

Do that, and we'll quit
