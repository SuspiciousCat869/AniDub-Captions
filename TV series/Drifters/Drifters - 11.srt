00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:09,833
That's quite far enough!

00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:13,000
[ORTE SOLDIER A]
Who goes there?

4
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:14,250
[ORTE SOLDIER B]
Whose carriages are these?

5
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,333
[ALLISTER] They belong
to Count Saint-Germain,

6
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:17,916
leading light of the Empire.

7
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,958
Was the banner too obtuse?

8
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,541
It's a brave man
who bars his entry.

9
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:26,708
Yes, but, so many
carriages at once?

10
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,250
No one gave us any warning.

11
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,541
This isn't how things
are done here, Milord.

12
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:33,125
Your name. I would have it.

13
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:34,708
[gasps]

14
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,875
[ALLISTER] You had the gall to
impede the Count's cavalcade.

15
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:40,375
I daresay the front lines could
benefit from your audacity.

16
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,625
What is your name, Sir?

17
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:45,125
Please, go right on ahead.

18
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,916
[ALLISTER chuckles]
Wise choice.

19
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,375
These are turbulent times.

20
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:49,833
And my master can no longer

21
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:53,083
watch the war effort unfold
from the safety of afar.

22
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:56,083
The count and his convoy
behind us will join the fight.

23
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,916
All for the glory
of the Orte Empire!

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,458
Any help would be a boon!

25
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,625
Um... Raise the gate already!

26
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,125
Hurry up!

27
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,541
[ALLISTER] Past the guards,
and not one lie uttered.

28
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:13,375
My contessa will indeed
be joining the fight.

29
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:17,666
I simply neglected to
tell them for which side.

30
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,541
[SHARA grunts]
I'm burning up in here.

31
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:20,916
[ELF A]
And the stench!

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,375
We're all going to die
amid this horrible smell.

33
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:24,958
Shut up, ya squealing piglet!

34
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:26,875
At least we don't
stink like a forge!

35
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,166
Quiet, you! You're the
one that reek!

36
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,916
Whoever insists on
touching my butt,

37
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,583
had better stop it at once!

38
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,375
Aw! And now they got a boob!

39
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:35,916
Well, I know it's not me!

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,750
[OLMINE] Lying bastard!
When have you not!

[NOBUNAGA] Prove it, then!
Trace the hand up to my arm an--

42
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:42,333
Shut up!

43
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,583
So this is the city
of Verlina, Orte's capital.

44
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,083
What a desolate place.

45
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,625
[NOBUNAGA]
True enough, But still...

46
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:54,833
...we should make it the seat
of our government, as well.

47
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:57,791
[TOYOHISA] Not much of a seat.
The buildings are sound enough,

48
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:00,208
but I've seen carrion
with more life to it.

49
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:01,708
[NOBUNAGA]
Me too.

50
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:04,458
These stall on the main road
into town should be brimming

51
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:08,416
with goods, but instead they
hawk scraps. Trade is dead.

52
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,291
Every civillian I
see is an old one

53
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:14,708
and the streets are
more deserted than not.

54
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:18,791
They threw their able
bodied into the war effort.

55
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,791
Place is on it's
on its last legs.

56
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:23,458
Hell, we're doing them
a favor by conquering it.

57

Half-tempted to burn it all.

00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,583
Look at this place.

59
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:30,625
At this point, cutting off its
head would be a kindness.

60
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:33,083
Bring its suffering to an end.

"Coo day ta"?

62
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,500
What the hell
does that mean?

63
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,541
You cover your words
with greasepaint, too.

64
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:41,958
Silence, rustic.

65
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:45,458
It's the artful seizing of
a capital from the inside.

66
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:47,666
I'll lead the whole
sordid affair

67

and by the time
our fun is over,

Remind me again which one
of you's in charge?

70
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,125
I don't remember
asking for the job,

71
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,208
but they gave it to
me all the same.

Tell me, lad.

00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,875
What are your names,
the three of you?

We are all Drifters here.

00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,208
As such, you might
be familiar to me.

of the Shimazu clan!

Since you've heard of us,

I assume you hail
from a point in history

long after any of ours.

[SAINT GERMI laughs]
Care to hear what happened

93
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:52,083
to the Shimazu after Sekigahara?

94
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,458
I'm a veritable
fount of knowledge.

95
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:58,291
You could tell me, but it
would be a waste of breath.

96
00:05:58,375 --> 00:05:59,833
My uncle fled.

97
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,333
That's why I stayed behind,

98
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:04,458
to buy him time enough to quit
the field and escape.

99
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,208
If he made it
back to Satsuma,

100
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,458
I know well what
happened after that!

101
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:11,208
The Shimazu destroyed
the Tokugawa.

102
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:14,250
Whether it took us
one year or a hundred,

103
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:18,125
I know that the final
victory was ours to be had.

[gasps]

105
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,208
To say such a thing.

106
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,791
To predict such an outcome
after the bloodletting

107
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,458
your forces had to endure.

108

This boy has audacity in spades!

00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,708
Yeah. What you said.

What do people say about
me in the future, huh?

you in curious ways.

[SAINT GERMI]
Brought hell to earth!

And made green tea
out of your own body.

They know you for
being a good archer.

Okay, then?

of world are you from?

124

[NOBUNAGA]
It's a shame.

125
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,666
I'd like to go into this
fight much better prepared.

126
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,791
More muskets made,
for one thing.

127
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,375
And more time for teaching
the troops how to use them.

128
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,750
That cherry blossom of a count

129
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:08,458
rushed the timeline
too damn much.

130
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,458
[TOYOHISA]
Eh. Life is a river.

131
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,583
Why resist the flow?

132
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,416
Much better to let it
take us where it will.

133
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,583
[NOBUNAGA] Spoken like one
who's never been dashed

134
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:20,333
agaisnt the rocks or
drowned within the rapids.

135
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:22,208
[TOYOHISA] Life or death,
I could care less.

136
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:25,625
[NOBUNAGA] I prefer life,
thank you very much.

137
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,875
[TOYOHISA] Why do you
trust that growling geisha?

138
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:28,833
He's a snake.

139
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,000
[NOBUNAGA]
Indeed.

140
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,333
But a traitor's mind
is no great riddle.

141
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:36,291
Betrayal's in their blood.
As soon as it suits their needs,

142
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,583
they'll stick a
knife in your back.

143
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,916
However, they do it
to profit in some way.

144
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,125
It's not based on anything
so tawdry as emotion.

145
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,250
No, not that old viper.

146
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,291
If he's screwing
over someone else,

147
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:52,000
he's too busy right
now to screw us over!

148
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,458
[TOYOHISA] I don't know
what to make of them.

149
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:56,750
The count and his entourage
are rather peculiar.

150
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:59,125
[NOBUNAGA]
"Peculiar"? That's diplomatic!

151
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,375
I'd have gone with
garish or outlandish!

152
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,083
Yeah! Outlandish is a good one!

153
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,625
You know I can hear you, right?!

154
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:06,916
Shut your mouth, you ingrate!

155
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,166
[ARISTOCRAT A]
Count Saint-Germain.

156
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,166
While it lay within your power
to summon us all hence,

157
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,875
I cannot help but wonder,

158
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:17,416
why now? When the health of

317
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,625
Leave it to me.
I will conquer Orte.

318
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:45,208
I will not allow the Drifters
to mar our plans in any way.

319
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,666
[BLACK KING]
Hijikata.

320
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,625
[HIJIKATA gasps]

321
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:48,750
[BLACK KING]
Rasputin.

322
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,250
[RASPUTIN gasps]

323
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,791
[BLACK KING] If you cannot
dislodge them from the capital,

324
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:56,041
I give you leave to
pursue a darker path;

325
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:59,875
Verlina's destruction.
If it will not be ours,

326
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,500
it will know the
fullness of our wrath.

327
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:07,000
Rain fire and death upon them,
and let both eat their fill.

328
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:09,333
The Drifters will
gain nothing by this,

329
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:13,333
but the hard-fought
lordship of a charnel house.

330
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:14,500
Lord.

331
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:18,958
Thy will be done,
my glorious ebon king!

332
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,208
[BLACK KING] Whether we
conquerit now or later,

333
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,000
their fate is set.

334
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:26,916
We shall suffer none to live.

335
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,291
[NOBUNAGA] Enough sleep,
you idiots, wake up!

336
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:32,666
[gasping]

337
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,583
What did I... What did I do?

338
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:37,000
Don't play the fool with me,
you piece of shit!

339
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:40,166
The Black King's army.
You let them into town.

340
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,125
How many, huh?
How many of them are there?

341
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,583
I-I dunno. What are
you getting at?

342
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:48,791
Who are you?
Why do you yell at me?

343
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,958
What'd I'd do?
I don't remember any--

344
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,875
[groans]

345
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,916
He's not above using pain
to wrap up a conversation.

346
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,458
This is my shocked face.

347
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,708
Bring me a map of
the town at once!

348
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,500
Hurry up, dammit!

349
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:03,291
I laid it on a bit too thick.

350
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,875
If I lose after
all that mockery,

351
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,083
the Count'll never
let me forget it.

352
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,125
That's the coldest treatment
Rasputin's gotten

353
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,125
since they tossed
him in the river.

354
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,416
[NOBUNAGA] Two hundred Elves,
two hundred Dwarves.

355
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,208
And no idea what
we're facing off against.

356
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,583
We're lucky your carriages
held that many.

357
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,583
Plus their armor and weapons.

358
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,125
The fighting men I stationed

359
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,208
beyond the capital should be
heading here as we speak.

360
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,958
Every one is a warrior
of high renown.

361
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:31,083
And we have a full 500.

362
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:32,375
Five hundred?

363
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,458
This is war, not a tea ceremony!

364
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:37,041
We thought we'd be fighting
the hapless city guards!

365
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,166
Not the Ends!

366
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,875
Besides, that 500
is my whole army!

367
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,541
What?! That's your army?!

368
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,625
Ha! And again, ha!

369
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:47,416
What kind of Orte big-wig
has only 500 soldiers

370
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,291
at their disposal?!

371
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,166
I prize quality over quantity!

372
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,333
Any two-bit despot could fill
the ranks with slugabeds!

373
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,791
Sorry to interrupt,
but your army is here!

374
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:56,750
Already?

375
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,125
They're quite--

376
00:17:58,208 --> 00:17:59,791
Quite what?

377
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,625
[NOBUNAGA] No doubt
they're ready for battle.

378
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:10,625
But, I'm not sure why every
one of them's bare-chested?

379
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,458
Uh. I have a theory about that.

380
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:17,291
Hey. Real talk.
Your army's morale,

381
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:18,250
it's high, yeah?

382
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,458
High? Puh-lease!

383
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:21,458
Behold the Sacred
Band of Thebes!

384
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,708
They just happened to be the
most perfect specimens

385
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,208
of manhood I could find!

386
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:26,916
My motives were pure, dammit!

387
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,250
Now I understand why there's
only 500 members in his army!

388
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,500
Of course!

389
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,750
Everyone had to enlist
with their best friend!

390
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:37,125
Oh yeah! You nailed it,
all right! Numbskull.

391
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:40,333
Thebai Hieros Lokhos.

392
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:43,708
Wait, so you've heard of
them before? Who are you, man?

393
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:46,708
Epaminondas, oblique phalanxes!

394
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:50,125
Two-bit thief! You stole that
stratagem from Gorgidas!

395
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:53,041
Who is this geezer? I don't
like how he's yelling at me!

396
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,208
Don't know!
The Octobrists said he's

397
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:56,791
Hannibal something-or-other.

398
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:58,541
The Hannibal?

399
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:02,083
I need to eat something.
Rome sounds tasty.

400
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:06,583
[SAINT GERMI gasps] May I die
before I get that old!

401
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,750
[inhales]

402
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,583
At the ready!

403
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,000
All right,

404
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:25,291
you Sacred Band of Thebes,
present your weaponry!

405
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,833
Over the past week, we've
had them running drills

406
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,750
with sticks in
lieu of the rifles.

407
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,958
Either way, this will
be something to see.

408
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,166
[NOBUNAGA chuckles]

409
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,333
[TOYOHISA]
Good so far.

410
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:39,875
[NOBUNAGA]
They look like guns,

411
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:42,000
but they're nothing
until they fire.

412
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:45,125
[YOICHI] Muskets.
A sobering sight indeed.

413
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:46,750
[SAINT GERMI]
Am I dreaming?

414
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:51,666
Such glorious weapons, in the
hands of my private army!

415
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:56,625
[THEBAN A] So this is a
real gun. I feel ill-at-ease.

416
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:59,250
Day n' night we worked
to get these made.

417
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:02,291
Hundred ain't enough to arm
all of 'em, but these'll do.

418
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,583
Before you go
thinking we're idle,

419
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,083
take a look at this beauty.

420
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,916
Should serve ya
fair-to-middlin'.

421
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,083
[TOYOHISA gasps]

422
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,041
[MALE VOICE chants]

423
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,416
What do ya think?

424
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,625
[chuckles]

425
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,625
[BOTH laugh]

426
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,833
They're laughing.
Why are they both laughing?

427
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:24,541
Just smile and nod
and we'll all be okay.

428
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,875
[TOYOHISA] Nobunaga will
lead the musketeers,

429
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,375
and keep them in formation.

430
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:34,083
Dwarves, I'll be fighting
alongside you. Hand-to-hand.

431
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,458
Yoichi will take the
Elvish contingent.

432
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,541
May your aim be true.

433
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:42,375
We'll lure them in and cut
them down. No one escapes.

434
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:45,208
They're corpses the
moment they take the field.

435
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,750
[NOBUNAGA] Look at that
glint in Toyohisa's eye.

436
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,875
Like a hawk surveying the field.

437
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,541
He lives for war.

438
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,833
Well, we don't need to
put every one of them

439
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,000
to the sword, right?

440
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:57,208
Once they see the
capital is denied them,

441
00:20:57,291 --> 00:21:00,333
they'll beat a hasty
retreat soon after.

442
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:01,541
We kill them all.

443
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,625
I don't care how fast they run.

444
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,583
They're done for!

445
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:09,416
Y'know, for a man of letters,
you're no good at strategy.

446
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,625
[SAINT GERMI]
What?! How dare you, sir?!

447
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:14,083
[NOBUNAGA] If I were them,
I'd switch to another plan

448
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:17,333
the moment I figured out this
place isn't up for grabs.

449
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:20,541
Instead of conquest,
one of destruction.

450
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:24,375
Pillaging homes at will.
Kidnapping. Even murder.

451
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:26,291
Now the peasants are the target.

452
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:29,375
I would leave all manner of
hell for them in my wake.

453
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:31,666
Casualties would be high.

454
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,083
We're wise to their puppetry
of the aristocrats from afar.

455
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:37,458
They do the Ends no good now.

456
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:40,791
If the Black King wants to
end the world, why sack a town?

457
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,416
[SAINT GERMI chuckles]

458
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,291
[NOBUNAGA] The place is sure to
suffer under their lack of rule.

459
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,916
Ideally, we'd let them
attack for a bit,

460
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,791
then rescue the Orte and take
the reins as their saviors.

461
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,208
Oh well.

462
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:56,208
Their lives are forfeit!
All of them!

463
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:58,000
We offer no quarter!

464
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,666
Now, men! Are you with me?!

465
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,125
[ALL cheer]

466
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,958
Tell me true, are we
ready for this Yoichi?

467
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,250
We'll be fighting the
Black Kings monsters.

468
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,833
Not within our homeland,
but in the heart of Orte.

469
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:12,375
How could you not be ready?

470
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:15,416
If you ever doubt yoursefl,
yell out "Minamoto Banzai"!

471
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,708
Still no idead what that means,
but, "Minamoto Banzai."

472
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:21,708
[NOBUNAGA] My victory in
Nagashino was a thing of beauty!

473
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:24,250
Now I've got men that
don't know how to shoot!

474
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:26,791
Where did my life go wrong?!

475
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:29,166
Care to inspect
the troops, milord?

476
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,041
I second that.

477
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:35,750
I'm going to kill
you twice, Mitsuhide!

478
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:44,916
[ALL gasp]

479
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:50,541
Olmine! Can you hear me?

480
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:53,250
You're on message duty
between the spheres!

481
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:55,375
Copy that! I'll relay
the messages!

482
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:59,958
Never done anything of
the sort, but I'll try.

483
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:13,291
They're coming. Mark them.

484
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:17,958
They're coming.
Right for us. Like clockwork.

485
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:19,333
[TOYOHISA]
Come on.

486
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:21,791
Come on. Come on!

487
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:23,333
Come on!

488
00:23:23,416 --> 00:23:26,000
[NOBUNAGA]
Thebans, at the ready!

489
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:28,416
Form a line!

490
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,875
This world has never
known gunfire.

491
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:36,125
Combat will never be the same!
You are harbingers of a new era!

492
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:40,083
From these 100 guns,
millions are sure to follow!

493
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:44,875
Your deeds tonight will change
the course of history!

494
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:49,041
Not yet, Thebans. Not yet!

495
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:51,625
Wait for your prey.

496
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:53,541
Let them come.

497
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:56,000
Let them seal their fate.

498
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:57,666
Closer!

499
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,500
Hold, damn you.

500
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:04,500
Open fire!

501
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,041
[KOBOLDS grunting]

[THEBANS gasp]

Heh!

504
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,125
[NOBUNAGA] Factoring the
destruction of the shot itself,

505
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:23,875
plus the spectacle of it,

506
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:26,583
even in the hands
of a rank amateur,

507
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:29,208
the effect of this
new weapon...

508
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:30,750
[gunshots]

509
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:34,916
[NOBUNAGA]
...it's powerful!

510
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,416
It's transcendent!

511
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,416
Signal Yoichi! Do you
hear me, Olmine?

512
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,416
[gasps]
Yo-Yoichi!

513
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:47,541
[YOICHI]
That is incredible.

514
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:52,000
But I prefer our way.
It's time to join the fight.

515
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:55,666
Aim for the center of
them and rain death!

[gasps]

[KOBOLDS grunting]

518
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:08,166
[NOBUNAGA] Perfectly executed!
These spheres are incredible!

519
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:11,000
What I wouldn't give to
revisit my past battles

520
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:13,625
with a few of these in tow!

[growls]

524
00:25:20,416 --> 00:25:23,083
[NOBUNAGA] They're slow,
and who wouldn't be?

525
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:25,666
One more volley and
this battle is over.

526
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,166
But the men are
nervous enough already.

527
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:31,833
[NOBUNAGA] Don't rush!
Measure your gunpowder well!

528
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:36,125
[NOBUNAGA]
Nothing is more important!

529
00:25:36,208 --> 00:25:38,125
Second volley!

530
00:25:39,416 --> 00:25:41,291
[NOBUNAGA]
Fire!

531
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:50,208
[KOBOLDS grunting]

532
00:25:50,541 --> 00:25:52,083
[NOBUNAGA]
The true value of a musket

533
00:25:52,166 --> 00:25:54,791
isn't the distance or
force of its shot,

534
00:25:54,875 --> 00:25:57,833
but the fear it
leaves in its wake!

535
00:25:57,916 --> 00:26:01,291
Every new bullet is born
of thunder and smoke!

536
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:03,291
The corpses pile higher!

537
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:06,333
And soon, their bravery
has left them.

538
00:26:06,416 --> 00:26:09,625
Soon they can go no further.

539
00:26:09,708 --> 00:26:11,166
They're afraid...

540
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:14,708
...and neither love nor duty
will spur them forward again!

541
00:26:14,791 --> 00:26:17,541
Kill 'em all!

542
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:25,750
[NOBUNAGA] Our warriors carve
into the foe without mercy.

543
00:26:25,833 --> 00:26:29,875
[MURASAKI] The human musketeers,
led by the wily Nobunaga.

544
00:26:29,958 --> 00:26:33,416
The Elven archers, led by
the peerless Yoichi.

545
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,666

[MURASAKI]
And last...

548
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:44,833
...the Dwarven infantrymen,
led by the devilish Shimazu.

549
00:26:44,916 --> 00:26:48,041
That's the best
possible outcome.

550
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,541
[HIJIKATA]
Shimazu...

551
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:12,083
You will die by my hand!
