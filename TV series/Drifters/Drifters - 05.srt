00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:42,041
[ORTE SOLDIERS chattering]

2
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,208
It's empty.

3
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:44,708
There's no one
in here, either.

4
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:46,500
The Elves are gone!

5
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:48,833
[ORTE COMMANDER] They're up
to something, but what?

6
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:50,666
Commander! You should see this!

7
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,833
What is it?

8
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:54,333
In the well.

9
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:57,583
[groans] Why does it
smell like shit over here?

10
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:59,166
The Elves.

11
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,041
They've contaminated their own
water-supply with their filth.

12
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:04,208
And that's not the
strangest part of it.

13
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:05,583
[ORTE COMMANDER]
Go on.

14
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,208
[VICE COMMANDER] Well,
they've dug out the contents

15
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:08,958
of the communal toilet, sir.

16
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:10,458
It's empty.

17
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:13,375
Do you mean to tell me
the Elves took their shit

18
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:14,583
along with them?

19
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:16,541
What the hell are
they playing at?

20
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:20,041
Where could they've gone?
None of it makes sense!

21
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:27,125
[TOYOHISA] After dark,
every soldier's life is forfeit.

22
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:29,708
All those heads are coming off.

23
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:41,375
[NOBUNAGA] Twenty swords and
sets of armor from the dead.

24
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:42,958
A decent haul.

25
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:45,916
And two horses. Not that
Elves know how to ride.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,541
Thankfully, I've got
a plan for them.

27
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:50,750
The armor's not much of a boon.

28
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:53,916
As a group, they're pretty
inept with a sword.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,375
Oddly enough,

30
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:58,291
they're damn savants when it
comes to fashioning bows.

31
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:01,125
Yoichi's there to help, but it
comes to them naturally.

32
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:04,541
They're happy. Like it
scratches some nagging itch.

33
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,375
Honestly, any one of them

34
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:09,166
could've given my bowmen
a run for their money.

35
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:13,625
Swords won't win us the day,
but spears we can't do without.

36
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:16,500
The longer they are,
the braver the Elves will be.

37
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:19,083
Even a peasant can
dispatch a samurai

38
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:20,750
if you give 'em the right tool.

39
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,541
[chuckles]

40
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,708
The news wouldn't
have reached you here.

41
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:29,000
Akechi Mitsuhide was killed
by peasants in Fushimi,

42
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,333
armed as you describe.

43
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:33,000
Ha! Did they! Hope they
stabbed him right in that

44
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:35,041
kumquat-lookin' head of his!

45
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,291
To show my thanks,

46
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:39,416
they can skip payin' tax
for the rest o' forever.

47
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,416
Looks to me like you
enjoy the scheming

48
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,916
more than you enjoy
the fight itself.

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,833
Battles are the just
the bloody afterthought

50
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,125
to the moves
you've already made.

51
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:51,000
Ya hand your foe his
defeat in moments like this,

52
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:54,166
well before the carnage.

53
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,666
Ah, Hideyoshi,

54
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,833
only you comprehended
that truth of warcraft.

55
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,916
[chuckles]

56
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:07,041
So that's why we haven't
seen dead soldiers around!

57
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,666
They were all brought here!

58
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,958
Take whatever you like.
And try not to mind the blood.

59
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,166
[ELVES]
Huh?

60
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,916
Once you've scrubbed
away that gore,

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
they're basically
as good as new.

62
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,041
[SHARA groans]
That one's dripping with it!

63
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,500
[ELF A]
How much armor is that?

64
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:21,791
[YOICHI] Telling them
the corpses' fate

65
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:24,666
would only upset them more.

66
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,041
Toyohisa gathered the heads

67
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,666
and buried them with
all due ceremony.

68
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,458
But their bodies
went to Nobunaga.

69
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:36,541
[NOBUNAGA] Good that you paid
respect to the enemy dead.

70
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:40,125
They'll get the chance to fight
again, if all goes as planned.

71
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,166
[OLMINU groans]

72
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:51,208
[TOYOHISA]
I can smell the decay.

73
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,375
You're making saltpeter?

74
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,458
[NOBUNAGA] The butchered
bodies will mix with the grass,

75
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,416
dirt, piss, and shit.

76
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,166
We'll have saltpeter
ready for the taking

77
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,500
about two years out from now.

78
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,041
[OLMINU grunts]

79
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:07,875
[NOBUNAGA] Stole this trick
from those bastard Ikko monks.

80
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:10,500
We should keep people out of
this part of the woods, I guess.

81
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,250
No point lettin'
pestilence spread.

82
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,916
[OLMINU gulps]

83
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,208
[TOYOHISA] And what about
the Elvin night soil?

84
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,750
[NOBUNAGA] We have plenty
of charcoal, but no sulfur.

85
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,333
Just leave it be for now.

86
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:25,291
Throwing 'em in that pit?
You desecrated their corpses!

87
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:26,458
How do you figure?

88
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:28,625
Full burial treats
them no better.

89
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:31,000
Maggots and time claim
their due share.

90
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:34,083
We're just helping
the process along.

91
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:37,041
[NOBUNAGA chuckles]
Waste not, want not.

92
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:40,166
[TOYOHISA] I washed those heads;
set their faces at peace.

93
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,875
I even marked the burial site.

94
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:45,458
In death, I showed
them great respect.

95
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:47,750
You think I wrong them
by taking the bodies,

96
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,791
leaving them here
amid this filth.

97
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:53,666
But this is the filth
hiding within each of us.

98
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,791
In what part of us does
the soul take residence?

99
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:57,791
The seat of thought?

100
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,833
Or the dung-filled
sack below it?

101
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:04,291
The latter is too
profane to be true.

102
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:07,083
[OLMINU] I see.
The biggest chasm between

103
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:11,083
my people and his is
not one of knowledge,

104
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:17,083
industry, or culture,
but in how they treat death.

105
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,875
[OLMINU gasps]

106
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,958
Hey! Listen up, Boob Dream.

107
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:24,416
Why do you delight in the
butchering of my name?

108
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,375
I'm stupid for lettin'
it get to me.

109
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:29,166
I find myself in need of a
certain mineral that often sits

110
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,125
in the shadow of volcanoes.

111
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,041
It's yellow, and smells
like the breezes

112
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,708
that leap out from
your backside.

113
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,666
They call it sulfur.
You got any?

114
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,958
Uh. I don't know what my
backside has to do with it.

115
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:40,916
What do you even
want the sulfur for?

116
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,500
Not your problem.
Just bring me a lot of it!

117
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:46,333
I'm sure your tentacle-chest
compatriots would lend a hand!

118
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:47,458
Who?!

119
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,041
The Octo-Breasts,
or whoever they are!

120
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,208
Octobrists!

121
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,041
Although, I'm sure
they'd help you

122
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,458
track it down if
the price is right.

123
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:55,625
Have any gold?

124
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,791
Tell those Octo-Breasts
not to be greedy!

125
00:05:57,875 --> 00:06:00,208
I'll pay 'em with interest once
I've conquered a few realms!

126
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:03,041
Just bring me the
damn sulfur, woman!

127
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:06,041
[OLMINU] Night soil,
corpses, now sulfur?

128
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,750
What does he mean
to do with it all?

129
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,583
I haven't the foggiest idea!

130
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,541
Goodness! Look at that!

131
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:16,125
See that? A bull's-eye,
but for a couple of inches.

132
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,083
[ELF C]
My turn! Give it here!

133
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,166
Who would've thought?

134
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,500
Your people are
learning so quickly.

135
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:22,958
[SHARA chuckles]

136
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,875
There's a knack for archery
knit up in our very flesh.

137
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,708
For the longest time,
we've been forbidden

138
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,958
to even lay our
hands upon a bow.

139
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,541
As children,
before the war started,

140
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,250
we used to practice
shooting quite a lot.

141
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,500
[YOICHI chuckles]

142
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,083
No one likes a braggart.

143
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,250
[SHARA gasps]

144
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,583
[YOICHI]
Heh.

145
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,875
{ELVES gasp]

146
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,416
[YOICHI]
Huh...

147
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,833
[YOICHI chuckles]

148
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,125
[SHARA]
All right, all right.

149
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,208
I daresay you've
made your point!

150
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:07,625
I don't know
what we did, but...

151
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,083
...we're sorry for it.
Very sorry!

152
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:11,083
[SHARA] We get it, Yoichi,
you're a peerless archer.

153
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,041
Please stop rubbing
our noses in it!

154
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,458
[ELF B] Aren't we going
to need those arrows?

155
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:21,500
[TOYOHISA] After dark,
we ambush the village.

156
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:24,083
Kill every soldier
you lay eyes on!

157
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,750
But the mission doesn't
end with their destruction.

158

And we'd be fools to think
we're not courting an eruption!

Sending a few troops

We must crush this

Sedition will whip
