One of us, I'd wager.

168
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,375
Though his clan is
unknown to me.

169
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,208
[NOBUNAGA]
Dying, or dead?

170
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:20,583
His breathing is faint,
but he does cling to life.

171
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,125
[NOBUNAGA]
A common flaw, that.

172
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:26,083
Do what you can for him
with needle and thread.

173
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:29,875
Fate may be capricious
enough to let him survive.

174
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,458
[NOBUNAGA]
Just as it did us.

175
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:37,791
[NOBUNAGA chuckles]

176
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,666
Our lives are intriguing,
are they not?

177
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,916
A clever bit of kabuki.

178
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:49,083
[IEHISA]
Toyohisa! Just look at you!

179
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:52,625
Took an enemy's head in
your first battle! Fine work!

180
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,625
You've done me proud, my son!

181
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,833
[TOYOHISA]
Really?

182
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:56,541
[IEHISA]
But of course!

183
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,583
[laughs]

184
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:01,708
[TOYOHISA]
Father! Father, wait!

185
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,625
[NOBUNAGA]
Well, look who's up?

186
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,500
[gasps]

187
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:07,791
[NOBUNAGA]
I'd advise you take it easy.

188
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,583
We stitched you up,
but you're still in a bad way.

189
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:13,291
[TOYOHISA grunts]

190
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,458
Who the hell are you? Talk!

191
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:18,541
[NOBUNAGA] Boy, you are in
no shape to demand a name.

192
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,916
I, however, am.

193
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,416
Who are you and
where did you come from?

194
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,416
[TOYOHISA gasps]
The Mokkou Crest.

195
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,000
I know this much;
You're a member of the Oda!

196
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:36,083
Member, huh? I'm a fair
sight more than that.

197
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,583
I am the source of
the clan's moniker.

198
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,958
What are you trying to say?

199
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:44,416
[NOBUNAGA] I am he who
tried to unite our land

200
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,916
of the rising sun, Oda Nobunaga!

201
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,958
[TOYOHISA grunts]

202
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:54,708
[NOBUNAGA] You've some strength,
for a damn fool.

203
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,708
You aim too high, imposter!

204
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,458
Nobunaga's dead!

205
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:02,000
Even the lowest of peasants
knows of his fate!

206
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:05,416
The lie you look to sell?
No man alive would buy it.

207
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,291
Which means I
am dead, and you...

208
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:11,958
...are a devil sent to vex me!

209
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:13,375
[NOBUNAGA]
Huh?

210
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,041
[YOICHI]
I'd rather you didn't.

211
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,291
[YOICHI] You're awake.
That's good, at least.

212
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:27,708
[YOICHI] Looking better
than you did when you came.

213
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:30,416
[TOYOHISA grunts]

214
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,458
I'll cook it for dinner,
but someone needs to pluck it.

215
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,000
Yeah, fine.

216
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,208
Got time on your hands?

217
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:41,958
Uh, yeah.

218
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,291
Then start earning your keep.

219
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,166
[TOYOHISA]
What the pluck?

220
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,958
You said everyone knew
Nobunaga had died.

221
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,166
People really do think I met
my end that day, do they?

222
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,250
Him! Not you!

223
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:07,833
He slit his belly after Akechi's
betrayal at Honnoji Temple.

224
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,541
Sure, they never
found his corpse,

225
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,416
but it's been eighteen years!

226
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,375
[NOBUNAGA]
What?!

227
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:16,458
Eighteen years, you said?!
Who's the charlatan now, huh?

228
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,833
I was sent to this
world that very day

229
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:21,250
and I'll be damned if more
than a handful of months

230
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,625
have passed since
my unexpected exile!

231
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,666
[TOYOHISA growls]

232
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,291
That's why I keep telling you.
Insisting on your story means

233
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,958
you're either a devil
or a madman.

234
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:33,708
Though I suppose you
could be a ghost!

235
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:38,750
[YOICHI laughs]

236
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,833
I'm sorry. It amuses me
to watch grown men argue

237
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:50,708
about the passage of so trifling
a sum of months or years.

238
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:53,916
[TOYOHISA] And who
are you, oh, amused one?

239
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,541
Ha! Tell him. Not that
he'll believe a word of it.

240
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:01,333
[YOICHI]
Fine. I am Yoichi.

241
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:04,666
Nasu Suketaka Yoichi,
to be more specific.

242
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,875
[TOYOHISA]
Do you take me for a fool?!

243
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:09,291
He was a hero
from the Genpei War!

244
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,375
That was over 400 years ago!

245
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:14,583
At least this scoundrel chose
a lie that was reasonable!

246
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:18,875
[YOICHI] Hm... Such a pity
you find my identify wanting.

247
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:22,625
Nonetheless, I am that
selfsame Yoichi of yore.

248
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:26,375
I must be dreaming!
That's the only explanation!

249
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:31,375
[NOBUNAGA] Fine. Tell us
where you hail from, dreamer.

250
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:37,041
I am Shimazu. Shimazu Toyohisa!
Son of Shimazu Iehisa!

251
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:40,833
"Shimazu?" Who're they?

252
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,666
I don't see 'em! Does anyone?

253
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,625
Are we even sure they
they're in Japan?

254
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:47,791
Oh, there they are! Way on
down in the ass-end of Kyushu!

255
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:50,083
That place is about as
boonies as you can get!

256
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,166
Huh...

257
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,041
I'll kill you!

258
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,416
Come to think of it, the name
Shimazu rings a bell.

259
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,916
There was a Lord Shimazu
back in my day.

260
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,500
If memory serves, he lived
in wilds of Kyushu, too.

261
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,458
I see.

262
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,041
Your family's lived out in the
boonies for centuries now.

263
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,000
[TOYOHISA]
That's it! You're both dead!

264
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:10,083
You could try, but you
may be the only fatality.

265
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,541
A shame, after I
just sewed you up.

266
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,083
[NOBUNAGA]
He's too stubborn to die.

267
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,500
Please, have a seat.

268
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:20,875
[TOYOHISA grunts]
Tell me something, Nobunaga.

269
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,500
[NOBUNAGA] 
Go on.

270
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,416
Everyone thinks you
died at Honnouji Temple!

271
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,375
How could you have escaped that?

272
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:30,791
Ha! Well, I wasn't going to lose
my head to the likes of Akechi!

273
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,666
I sped through the temple,
Ranmaru fast at my heels,

274
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,583
looking for any means of escape.

275
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:39,333
You think you invented the
double-cross, you fool?!

276
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:42,291
It'll take more than
this to lay me low!

277
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:46,958
[NOBUNAGA] Suddenly, the temple
was nowhere to be seen.

278
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,333
I found myself in
a hall of white.

279
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:52,500
Countless doors standing
sentinel to either side.

280
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:56,541
In the middle, a mysterious man
seemed to hold court.

281
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,166
And then...

282
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:06,250
Yes, that man. I encountered
him during my journey, as well.

283
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:09,000
It's uncanny how alike
all our stories are!

284
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:12,916
After the battle at Sekigahara,
I beheld him, too!

285
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
[NOBUNAGA]
Sekigahara...

286
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,791
Where's 'at, Mino?

287
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,625
Uh-huh. Ishida and Tokugawa's
men fought it out.

288
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,166
[growls]

289
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,833
Hold on! What the
hell did you say?

290
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,666
Ishida's a lickspittle!

291
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,000
Why would Tokugawa waste
any time on the likes of him?

292
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,416
Had no choice! After
the regent died,

293
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,250
the nation slid
back into civil war.

294
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,875
Did you say regent?

295
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:35,166
Why the hell did the country

296
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,791
have a regent in
the first place?

297
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,500
Hideyoshi could never be shogun,

298
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:40,916
but as kampaku, he still
held all the cards.

299
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,416
Hideyoshi?

300
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,458
Son-of-a--!

301
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,541
How did that little monkey ever
accomplish what I could not?

302
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,625
I don't have time
for a history lesson!

303
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,208
Hideyoshi defeated Akechi,
destroyed Shibata,

304
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,791
and conquered Japan!
End of story!

305
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,625
That's all you get!

306
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,583
Did Katsuie perish in
the meantime? What of Oichi?

307
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:57,625
[OICHI]
Remember me, Lord Brother!

308
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:58,666
I don't know!

309
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,333
Niwa? Kazumasu? Toshiie?

310
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,083
Stop throwing names at me!

311
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,833
These days, the Oda are
just Ieyasu's lackeys!

312
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:08,083
Nobody cares about
your clan anymore!

313
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,250
[NOBUNAGA]
You bite your tongue!

314
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,375
One more name.

315
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:19,291
My eldest son, Nobutada.

316
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:20,958
He's dead!

317
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,666
Mitsuhide cornered
him within Nijo Castle.

318
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,791
But he did your memory proud.

319
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,625
He fought to the bitter end!

320
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:31,000
Even when he knew
the battle was lost!

321
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:36,166
[NOBUNAGA laughs]
How dare he die before me.

322
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:40,291
The son should mourn
the father, not I him.

323
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:46,708
He should've made his way
to safety. Honor be damned.

324
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:53,666
[NOBUNAGA chuckles]
A man gets fifty years of life.

325
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,750
Hard thing, knowing your fifty
years were spent in vain.

326
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:01,625
[YOICHI]
Only uncertainty is certain.

327
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,916
I remember my shock
when Lord Nobunaga

328
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,041
told me of the fall
of the Minamoto Clan

329
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:09,916
and eventual end of the
Kamakura Shogunate.

330
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,666
I hope you won't take
this the wrong way, but,

331
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,708
it's a shame you're stuck
here with this fellow

332
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:17,500
instead of Ranmaru,
given how "close" you were.

333
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:20,500
Woulda made these cold
nights a lot warmer.

334
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,000
[YOICHI]
Huh?

335
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,708
No clue what they're
going on about.

336
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:31,375
At this distance,
it's anyone's guess.

337
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,708
[HARUAKIRA]
Olminu. What's your status?

338
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:37,583
Hello? Do you copy?
Have you found him yet?

339
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:40,208
Yes, sir. There's no
doubt they're Drifters.

340
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:43,250
They're holed up in the
ruins of a castle.

341
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,583
It's worse than we thought.

342
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:49,875
[HARUAKIRA] Hmm...
They have to be dealt with.

343
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:52,708
If we do nothing...

344
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:24,083
...our world will drown
in a maelstrom of blood.

345
00:23:56,708 --> 00:24:01,666
