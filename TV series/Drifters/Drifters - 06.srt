[OLMINU] That portrait before

20
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:17,583
He's the Father and
Founder of the Orte Empire.

21
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:20,916
He appeared out of

Whether with the Drifters or
the Ends, no one can say.

23
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:27,125
What we do know is that he
showed up at a tavern one day,

24
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:30,625
shouting about the overthrow
of the current government.

25
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:34,041
His vitriol must've struck home.
He gathered an army of those

26
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:37,375
buoyed by his words,
and marched on the capital.

27
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:40,791
A powerful orator, he played
on the people's fears,

28
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:43,125
and was catapulted into power.

29
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,666
Oddly enough,
after founding Orte,

30
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,833
he died by his own hand.

31
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:51,250
No one ever found out
what drove him to the act.

32
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:54,000
If he did come
from your world,

You can tell that
just from their men.

Come, lad, you didn't presume
this outcome from the start?

You should not be the one

160
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:49,041
will you meekly hand them back,
so that he may slake his lust?

161
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,458
Or will you fight?

162
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,833
For your families!
For your homes!

163
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:56,041
Join us, and I will see
that you keep them!"

164
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,916
He sent another missive proving
that decades of conquest

165
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,041
had left Orte stretched thin,

166
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:05,125
based on facts Nobunaga gleaned
from the defeated lord's papers.

167
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:08,375
He's a pervert, yes,
but a brilliant one.

168
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:13,125
Emboldened by his words,
the Elf villages rose in revolt.

169
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:16,000
Little by little, the Elves
are throwing off the yoke

170
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:19,041
of 40 years of Orte oppression.

with those Drifters!

[music crescendos]

[SAINT-GERMI]
We're losing on the eastern

and western front alike.

185
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,500
The situation in the
far north is vexing,

186
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,416
and the Elves are feeling
their proverbial oats.

187
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,833
Hate to say it,

188
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:23,375
but this empire's living
on borrowed time.

189
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,333
[ARISTOCRAT A]
This war will be the ruin of us.

190
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,541
We lack the manpower
to keep this up.

191
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:33,000
Forty years of non-stop
conflict has bled us dry.

192
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,583
We've had to resort
to levying troops

193
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,541
from the hinterlands as of late.

194
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,541
We're also running
low on materiel.

195
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,291
Tax revenue, seized assets

196
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,666
and plunder have all
slowed to a trickle!

197
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,083
The time may have
come for a ceasefire.

198
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,625
[ARISTOCRAT B]
Surely you jest!

199
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:49,750
The Father intended Orte
to last for a millennium.

200
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,041
Our kingdom is built
upon that truth!

201
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:54,791
Without conquest,
Orte cannot endure!

202
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,208
A conundrum.

203
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,125
[SAINT-GERMI]
Oh, the gang's all here!

204
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:01,125
And I'm just waltzing in late,
scoundrel that I am.

205
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:05,333
Can you find it in your hearts
to forgive me? Much obliged.

206
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:08,000
Ah. Count San-Germain, welcome.

207
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,666
[ARISTOCRATS]
Hm?

208
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,791
I had hoped with all
my heart to be on time,

209
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:15,291
but unexpected business
demanded my attention.

210
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,750
Why do they tolerate
this mincing popinjay?

211
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,833
Shh! Keep it to yourself!

212
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:23,250
He's been the ruin
of men for far less.

213
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,000
That's Count San-Germain.

214
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:28,333
Huh? Him? You're kidding me!

215
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,000
[GUARD B]
That "mincing popinjay"

216
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,208
rules over a quarter
of the empire.

217
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:33,708
When the Father led his coup,

218
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,375
he was the first noble
to heed the call.

219
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:37,708
[gulps]

220
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,708
[GUARD B] Without that
historic act of betrayal,

221
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:42,875
the Orte Empire would have
been done before it began.

222
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,083
Since that day, the Count's
acted with impunity.

223
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:49,333
He's never taken up arms in war.
He lives a life of ease.

224
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:52,083
Wait, you just said
he helped the Father.

225
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,000
That was 50 years ago!

226
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,333
I know.

227
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,625
How wizened of a man hides
beneath that make-up?

228
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,958
[SAINT-GERMI] Hm. I've brought
an interesting titbit

229
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:04,291
of information along with me.
Consider it my 'mea culpa'.

230
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:05,916
You're all aware of the fleet

231
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,458
that keeps our troops in the
west well-provisioned, yes?

232
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:13,000
[gasps] Anyone have a writing
implement I could borrow?

233
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,375
Give me something
to write with. Quickly!

234
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,666
I'd be honored to sacrifice
my lipstick to the cause,

235
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,000
my dear contessa!

236
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,916
Use mine, or the heartbreak
will surely kill me!

237
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,208
[SAINT-GERMI] Shut
up! Just give it to me!

238
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,458
If memory serves,
I asked you many a time

239
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:30,791
as to whether this sea-route...
was a sensible option.

240
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,291
[ARISTOCRATS]
Hm?

241
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:36,291
Now, the destruction of our
fleet has proven my point.

242
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:36,750
What?

243
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,166
But how?

244
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,125
[ORTE SOLDIER A]
Another direct hit!

245
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,000
[ORTE SOLDIER B] Damn it!
They're taking on water!

[ORTE SOLDIER C grunts] They're
swarming them like vultures!

247
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,041
[ORTE SOLDIER B] How many
of our ships are left?

will be the end of us all!

Shylock Company,

and delivered by
the Gu Binnen Guild!

How do you like our
highly-explosive recipe

257

of fish oil and animal fat, huh?

[PILOT A]
Commander, a question!

262
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,333
What is the meaning
of your battle-cry?

263
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:33,458
[COMMANDER] Huh? Just something
I picked up from the Admiral.

264
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,625
[chuckles]
You're supposed to yell it

when the enemy
never saw ya coming!

266

Tora! Tora! Tora!

[COMMANDER]
Tora! Tora! Tora!

268
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:54,416
Maybe... we win this time.

269
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,041
This is come-uppance

270
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:07,000
for all the chaos we've
sown amid our neighbors.

271
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,333
That said, making a foe
of the Merchant Guild

272
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:12,250
of all people was a
particularly fatal gambit.

273
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:15,958
[SAINT-GERMI laughs]
Can't say I didn't warn you!

274
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,333
Our prospects on
land are no better.

275
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,125
The Elves have
decided to fight for

276
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,416
their freedom after
all these years.

277
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,083
Do pardon my maiden blush.

278
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,875
They leave me weak in the knees!

279
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,833
The serfs lash out
from time to time!

280
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,833
Nothing our troops can't quash!

281
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,375
The more pressing issue...

282
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:35,000
[SAINT-GERMI] They've proven
me right. Morons, one and all.

283
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,291
Orte increased its
holdings through conquest,

284
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:40,291
its borders ever expanding.
That means the Elves

285
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:43,791
rising up in rebellion's the
mere tip of the iceberg.

286
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,000
The other conquered races

287
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,541
will find courage in
their seditious example.

288
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:48,875
Whispers of freedom

289
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,083
will whip through the
territories like wildfire,

290
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,708
igniting a
full-blown revolution.

291
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,333
Our satellite
states to the west

292
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,791
shall prove fertile
ground for these ideas.

293
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,500
When they rise up, we'll be
cut off from the lion's

294
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,333
share of our fighting men.

295
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:05,958
And with that the
empire is in checkmate!

296
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,083
[laughs]

297
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:11,041
I think my nose could use
a thorough powdering!

298
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,291
I hope you'll excuse me!

299
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,833
Best of luck with
the upcoming carnage!

300
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:18,041
I bid you all a fond farewell!

301
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,208
Dear contessa,
you seem nervous.

302
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,208
[SAINT-GERMI] We're leaving
here with all due haste!

303
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:24,333
Oh! Be a love and grab
that painting, would you?

304
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:25,791
Ah! The candelabra!

305
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:28,916
Contact the leaders of the
Elven rebellion immediately.

306
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,458
Wait, I heard that Drifters
might be mixed up in this.

307
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,833
I'll initiate the parley myself.

308
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,291
[ALLISTER] Elves?! I want
to go see the Elves, too!

309
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,333
[FULAME] No fair! If you
take him, you have to take me!

310
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:39,875
Silence!

311
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:47,125
[SHARA]
Halt!

312
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,708
[ELVES gasp]

313
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:52,833
[gasp] You're all from
Fizona Village, aren't you!

314
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,250
So glad you came!

315
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:57,416
Shara, right? I read that
message you sent along.

316
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,583
If we don't do it now,
we never will.

317
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:02,000
More and more Elves are
throwing in with us, friend.

318
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,416
We can win this!

319
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,875
You wrote that Drifters
spearheaded this whole thing.

320
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,041
What're they like?

321
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,416
I'm not entirely
sure how to answer.

322
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,416
They're... like no one I've met!

323
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,000
Even though they aided
you in your moment of need,

324
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,625
they are not of our blood.

325
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:19,125
How do they differ from
the other Short-Ears?

326
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,958
Are they worthy of trust?

327
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:24,750
They are to me.
I trust them with my life.

328
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,375
[TOYOHISA] Don't tell
me you're still upset.

329
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,291
You really should
calm down, milord.

330
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:34,625
This fit of pique is unseemly.
You were a leader of men!

331
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,291
[TOYOHISA] I still don't
see why you're so angry

332
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,083
in the first place.

333
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,833
What kind of fool are you?!

334
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:42,125
Why are you giving the village
heads a spot at the table?

335
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,458
I could have sculpted
you into an warlord!

336
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:47,708
You could have
become king, Toyohisa!

337
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:50,583
[TOYOHISA] Nuance was
never a strength of mine.

338
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:54,166
When I see a problem, I run
toward it and cut it in half.

339
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,625
Nobunaga.

340
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:58,208
You can see through a man's
machinations at a glance,

341
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,750
but the strings that
move his heart to action

342
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,916
remain unknown to you, even now.

343
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,291
Huh?

344
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,791
[TOYOHISA] I know the Elves
will follow me into war.

345
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,958
And I could name myself king.

346
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:13,083
Until the day they let
fly their arrows at us.

347
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,500
They know nothing of
Honno-ji Temple here.

348
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:18,000
But someday they'll recreate it.

349
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:21,375
Do you wish to suffer
that twice? I do not!

350
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,708
The cost is too high.

351
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,250
You don't think I can
read people's emotions?

352
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,875
Gotta say, that's just
downright insulting.

353
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,833
I've faced so much betrayal

354
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,166
I know what's in
there sight unseen.

355
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,375
Were you stabbed in the
back that many times?

356
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:36,458
Lemme see.

357
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,041
Twice by my brother Nobukatsu.

358
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,083
Twice each by the
Katsuie and Hayashi.

359
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,500
Azai, Matsunaga, Araki, Hatano,

360
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,083
Bessho, Mitsuhide.

361
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,041
Yeah, that's a lot!

362
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,250
[NOBUNAGA]
Know this;

363
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:50,166
Once my mind is made up,
I never relent.

364
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,333
I will make you a king.

365
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,625
[ELVES chattering]

366
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,666
What is he trying
to accomplish?

367
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,333
Having them bring the
contents of their latrines.

368
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:01,666
[OLMINU]
No idea.

369
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,750
[chuckles] If you don't
want to get blown to bits,

370
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,041
pour with caution.

371
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,208
Hey, Shara.

372
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,125
We're going to need
a lot more of this.

373
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:12,250
Tell the villagers to dig up as
much as they can and bring it

374
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:13,750
to me without delay.

375
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:16,291
Are all Drifters this
obsessed with shit?

376
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,583
Pardon, sir.

377
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,041
[NOBUNAGA]
Hm?

378
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,500
[SHARA] I asked our
blacksmiths as you bade me.

379
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:25,000
But as I feared, they said
copying this was beyond them.

380
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,958
[NOBUNAGA]
So that's the verdict, huh?

381
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,833
I should've given
the craftsmen of Sakai

382
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:31,708
and Kunitomo more credit.

383
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:34,041
Who can do the job?

384
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:37,208
[SHARA] Perhaps the Dwarves
would be up to the task.

385
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:40,916
Their knack for metal-work
is their one saving grace.

386
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,333
Whatever they are, they'll do.

387
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,250
[YOICHI]
All right!

388
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:50,375
I'm here to sharpen your archery
skills to a razor's edge!

389
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:55,375
I am Nasu Suketaka Yoichi!
Rrgh! And I own you now!

390
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:58,500
I am going to subject you
to training of such intensity,

391
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:01,500
every arrow you shoot will
be a part of your soul!

392
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:05,208
After every answer you give me,
you'll shout, "Minamoto banzai"!

393
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,625
[laughs]

394
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:07,458
"Minamoto"?

395
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,041
Just do it.

396
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:12,166
[YOICHI] Where 100 shots out of
100 may have sufficed before,

397
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,125
now you must make
10,000 out of 100!

398
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:16,541
Prepare yourselves!

399
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,791
[ELVES]
No way, Minamoto banzai.

400
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,458
While jesting,
his face gets very odd

401
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:24,291
but when he's serious,
he's a sigh to behold.

402
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:27,375
He is too beautiful
to be a Short-Ear.

403
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:30,750
I'm not sure what led you to
that conclusion, my dear Elves.

404
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:34,208
I was the youngest of 11
brothers within the Nasu clan.

405
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:37,166
And my looks were the
most unfortunate by far.

406
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,916
No words could do
their beauty justice!

407
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,541
Where they would tread,
flowers bloomed anew.

408
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,333
Oceans cleared a path.

409
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,666
And gold fell from the sky!

410
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,333
You do believe my words,
don't you?

411
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,250
[TOYOHISA shouts]

412
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,625
[ELVES gasp]

413
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,458
[TOYOHISA] That's how we're
taught back in Satsuma.

414
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,541
To put all of your strength
and heart into one slash,

415
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,500
the result be damned.

416
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,083
It's impressive...

417
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,375
...but if the blade should fail
to connect with your opponent,

418
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:12,583
then what?

419
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,083
He strikes you dead.

420
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:18,000
Your spirit leaves
this realm, honor intact.

421
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:21,875
[TOYOHISA] The Elves are
useless with a sword in hand.

422
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,125
I don't think they're
meant for such things.

423
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:25,541
[NOBUNAGA]
Hm...

424
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,416
[YOICHI] They make up
for it with a bow.

425
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,875
Their skill at archery
is beyond reproach.

426
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:34,250
Wish their blacksmiths
were as trusty.

427
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:38,000
[YOICHI grunts]
Why do I feel such icy dread?

428
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:39,333
[OLMINU]
Huh?

429
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,291
Something approaches.

430
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:45,750
And it's not the rank-and-file
of the Orte Army.

431
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:48,708
They are coming for us.

432
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:50,333
[gasps]

433
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:53,458
[TOYOHISA] The night air
smells of Sekigahara.

434
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:56,083
Of blood, waiting to be spilt!

435
00:21:56,166 --> 00:22:01,708
[MALE VOICE chants]

436
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:05,291
[BLACK KING] Find them!
Hunt them down!

437
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:07,208
[JOAN OF ARC] En avant,
Gilles de Rais!

438
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:12,375
That righteous stench will lead
us straight to the Drifters!

439
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:13,750
[BLACK KING]
End them!

440
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,875
Cast them down
into the darkness!

441
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:19,625
Before these
branches bear fruit,

442
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:22,833
consign them to the flames.

443
00:23:57,083 --> 00:24:02,041
[MALE VOICE chants]
