wholesale slaughter

321
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:50,666
and relaxing with a drink
served in the skull of my foe!

322
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,333
[screams]

323
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,500
My, my name is Olmine,
and I'm one of the magicians

324
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:56,500
working for the
Octobrist Organization!

325
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,875
The Grand Master gave me orders
to keep an eye on you Drifters,

326
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:00,833
otherwise I never would
have dared to spy on you

327
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:02,000
and I'm very sorry about it!

328
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:04,041
[groans]

329
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:05,458
What is she going on about?

330
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:07,875
Say it again, and make
it simpler this time.

331
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:09,541
The guy in red is
kind of a dummy.

332
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:11,083
That wasn't complex!

333
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:13,500
Who are you calling a dummy?!
I've beheaded men for less!

334
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:15,375
Oh, fine then.
You're not a dummy.

335
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:17,375
Does that make
you feel any better?

336
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:21,125
Okay. I'll try to
simplify it for you.

337
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:23,708
In this realm, those of you
who hail from the other world

338
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:25,166
are known as Drifters.

339
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,500
Like I was telling you before,

340
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:29,208
I'm a member of the
Octobrist Organization,

341
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:31,375
a group tasked with
monitoring the activities

342
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:34,083
of people like you and
bringing them together.

343
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:36,125
You were sent here to
battle other travelers

344
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:40,291
from your world. Those of
evil intent, known as Ends.

345
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:43,416
Ask if!

346
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,208
That story is such bullshit!

347
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:46,708
No way!

348
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:53,333
[shouts]

349
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,958
