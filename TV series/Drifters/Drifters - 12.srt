There's an incoming

[SAINT GERMI]
No. It doesn't make any sense.

162
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:13,791
Taking the city?
Why would they bother?

163
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,750
What about destroying
the world?

164
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:18,875
I thought that was their goal
from the start, was it not?

165
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:22,833
The Ends pursue a strategy
I cannot begin to fathom.

166
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,875
[SAINT GERMI]
How do their dark designs

167
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,541
unfold at the Northern Wall?

168
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,625
[SAINT GERMI]
The Black King...

169
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:38,541
[SAINT GERMI] Heaven forefend.
Is it someone I know?

[HIJIKATA]
He dares to smile.

173
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:15,833
Shimazu Toyohisa, what path has
led you to your present doom?

174
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:27,333
The act of a coward.

itself with your antics!

184
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,208
[TOYOHISA]
Huh?

185
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,166
This is a fight to the death.

186
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,166
I'm going to strike your head
clean off of your neck.

187
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,208
And when I do, won't your
spirit be pleased to know

188
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:50,208
I had to use every
trick in the book?

189

[HIJIKATA]
Shimazu!

190
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,708
Oh, I can't bear to listen!

191
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,916
The taunts are probably
part of a greater design,

192
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,583
but he's courting his
death with every word!

193
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,458
No, this is perfect.

194
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,416
We have three
frontline commanders,

195
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,166
and near as I can tell,
they only have the one.

196
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,208
Every moment he's focused
on trying to kill Toyohisa,

197
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:15,833
is a moment he's not
leading his men.

198
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,708
They're headed this
way as we speak,

199
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:20,291
following his last order.

200
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:24,208
[chuckles] If only you'd kept
a cooler head out there tonight,

201
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,541
your forces might
have won this thing.

202
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:29,541
Toyohisa can vex someone
better than any man alive!

204

Nobunaga. What sort of scheme
do you have up your sleeve?

205
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,375
I trust you're done?

206
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,500
As soon as you're ready,
we'll be on our way.

We'll let the enemy
pour in unchallenged.

00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,416
Meanwhile, you're to lie in wait

to fire the enemy
like pottery in a kiln!

I'll bet he felt this
watching the temple burn.

Nobunaga and Yoichi, they gave
me no choice but to lead.

But in truth, I've never thought
of myself as a leader of men.

I'm not a tactician.

Sixth Heaven himself!

If I lay down my life here,
to buy him some time,

264

I have no doubt he'll turn
my sacrifice into a victory.

Uh... evenin'.

[HIJIKATA]
Shimazu!

321
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:42,208
[BLACK KING]
Leave the battlefield at once!

322
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:43,875
I command it!

323
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:44,791

[DWARF CHIEF]
Hm?

327
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,916
Who's the coward now?!

328
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,250
For a moment, I thought I had
a challenge on my hands!

329
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:10,958
[TOYOHISA scoffs]
It looked like I could

330
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:14,708
finally cross blades with an
honest-to-goodness samurai,

331
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:17,458
and now you go and ruin my fun!

332
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:21,500
Throw me down your head,
and maybe I'll forgive you!

333
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,541
[HIJIKATA]
Cocky little shit!

334
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,208
This from the coward
who was leaping

335
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:28,791
through windows and
playing the fool!

336
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,541
Pay him no mind. Let's go.

337

[KOBOLD J speaking Orte]


338
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:40,291
Fortune hands me a samurai

339
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:43,375
and only gives me time
enough for a draw.

340
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:46,458
Not "warrior", but "samurai."

341
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:49,625
Well... Perhaps.

342
00:21:56,708 --> 00:22:01,375
Hurts like hell, but we got 'em.

[DWARF CHIEF]
Hey! Hey! Toyohisa!

344
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:08,958
Lord. I beg your forgiveness.

345
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:12,000
To have sent your army
into that massacre!

346
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:16,083
[BLACK KING] Take heart.
My children did not die in vain.

347
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:19,375
We have gained much by
the blood that was shed.

348
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:22,958
The Orte capital has
been dealt a ruinous blow.

349
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:25,250
I believe such
preliminary assaults

350
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:28,125
were a tool of your era,
were they not?

351
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:31,791
[MITSUHIDE]
That voice. The words he used.

352
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,458
It was him.

353
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:36,333
His laughter still
plagues my sleep.

354
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:38,166
Nobunaga.

355
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,041
No wonder we never
found his corpse.

356
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:46,333
If you leave the task of
killing that hyena to me,

357
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:49,541
then I, Akechi Koreto Mitsuhide,

358
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:53,500
pledge myself to
whatever end you seek.
