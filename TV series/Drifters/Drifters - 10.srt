00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,458
[MILLS] Okay, so the
night-soil from the villages

2
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:35,916
goes to the castle.

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,541
Unless they can bring it
straight to us and we store it.

4
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:42,333
But... then where are the
horses and wheat supposed to go?

5
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:45,916
[groans] I'm glad they spared
my life and all, but still!

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,750
[ELVEN BOY A]
Virgin Man!

7
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:49,625
I've been looking
all over for you!

8
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:53,958
For the love of all that's holy,
stop calling me that!

9
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:56,083
A frilly carriage
is on its way.

10
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:58,916
Frilly? Like how?

11
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:04,125
[MILLS] That's the banner
of Count Saint-Germain.

12
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:06,875
[grunts]
A powerful Orte aristocrat!

13
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:10,416
[gasps] All you Elf boys,
run for cover! Do it!

14
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,250
Ladies, you're fine.

15
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:15,916
[ELVEN BOY A]
Why do we have to hide?

16
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:21,875
[FEMALE ELF GUARD A]
Halt, you!

17
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:23,500
[SAINT GERMI]
Hm?

18
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,833
[MALE ELF GUARD A]
Stay back!

19
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:27,250
[FEMALE ELF GUARD A]
Wh-What do you want with us?

20
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:29,166
[SAINT GERMI]
I could die of boredom here.

21
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm already fading away.

22
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:34,041
[ALLISTER] Not much of a feast
for the senses, now is it?

23
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:35,208
I thought the abode
of the Elves

24
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:37,333
would be a far
more magical milieu!

25
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:38,458
Sunlight streaming down

26
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:40,083
through a canopy of
branches overhead,

27
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:41,458
and then we see them!

28
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:44,041
Naked Elven boys frolicking
with no sense of shame!

29
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:47,166
[BOTH]
Oh the thought of it!

30
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,958
Do stop.

31

[MILLS]
Count Saint-Germain!

32
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,250
What could bring a
person of your eminence

33
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:54,000
to a place like this one?

34
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:57,125
You! Drab little man.
Are you a Drifter?

35
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:58,916
No, I'm very much not.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,375
I am Mills, former auditor to
Orte's Elven colonies, milord.

37
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,375
Now I work for my
captors under duress.

38
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,666
[SAINT GERMI] Hmm. A virgin,
from the looks of it.

39
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,250
I'm here for the Drifters,
you milksop.

40
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,541
You would do well
to produce them.

41
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:14,333
I'm not a man you deny.

42
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:16,500
You heard the contessa,
Drifters, tout-de-suite!

43
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:19,333
[ALLISTER] There is a marked
lack of Elf boys prancing about!

00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:22,041
Remedy this at once,
or taste of my wrath!

45
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:25,833
Well, the Drifters
aren't here right now.

46
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:27,375
[ALL]
Huh?

47
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:28,958
[SAINT GERMI] What do you mean
they aren't here right now?!

48
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:30,208
Where else could they be?!

Answer me, virgin,
or I'll devour you whole!

50
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,625
I'm sorry, but they're away!

51
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:35,958
They went off to
free the Dwarves

52
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:37,375
and they took the
Elven men along

53
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,250
and they hope to have the
Dwarves construct firearms

54
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:40,833
for them and I really
wish you'd stop gnawing

55
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:42,250
on my head, milord!

[SAINT GERMI gasps]

00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:46,333
Did you just say they're
going to have the Dwarves

58
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,708
build them guns?!

59
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:50,583
Well, what about...
What about the black powder?!

60
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:52,125
They already have black powder.

61
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,458
They're making a ton
of it all the time.

62
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:58,500
[SAINT GERMI] That's it, Orte.
You had a damn good run.

but this, it sets
my head a-spin.

what the hell have you done?!

you mind at ease!

Murasaki? Who's that?

It's none of you concern.
Don't pry, underlings. Hm.

give me the royal treatment,

Or so your boasting
would have one believe.

You broke the will of the
lesser lights of our tribe,

81
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:16,250
reducing proud dragons
to beasts of burden.

be your undoing.

dare to belittle me thus!

be last and the last, first.

You brandish your title,
but alas, it moves me not.

child is of like worth.

I would have
your answer, serpent.

[BLACK KING] It is a

And hence you are welcome,
fellow outcast.

The sight of it
stills the heart.

It must be something if it moves
you to speak up, Hijikata.

111
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:07,291
Our lord can orchestrate the
replication of life itself.

112
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:11,250
The power to heal is but one
movement in that symphony.

113
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,708
What is cancer,

114
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:16,541

over to ruinous zeal?

[GOBLINS speaking Orte]

[BLACK KING] Please, brothers,
kneel not at my approach.

117
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:35,000
Merely grant me space to
set my talents to use.

118
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:50,500
[RASPUTIN] Anything organic
falls under his dominion.

119
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:53,208
He can copy it, ad infinitum.

120
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,750
To those who struggle
against the Black King.

121
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:59,208
To gaze at such a figure
across the field of battle,

122
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:02,833
it must turn their blood to
ice to know what he can do.

123
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:07,416
Instant healing to his
injured soldiers, however dire.

124
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,666
Even those with one
foot in the grave

125
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,458
make a quick return
to the front line.

126

Firewood and foodstuffs
multiply at his merest touch.

127
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,583
It's that largesse that
puzzles me the most.

128
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,125
Why does he have his
creatures till the earth?

129
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:25,708
To what end, when he could
feed them all forever?

130
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:29,708
[BLACK KING] Simple. God may
reign for time eternal,

131
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:33,000
but I claim no such tenure.

How fares it?

[exhales] This field is
still a passion of mine.

136
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,291
It's a little threadbare
as religions go,

137
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:48,250
but that could be a virtue.
given our simple audience.

138
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,500
For our symbol,
I chose the eye.

139
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,666
Fire-worship serves as
the cauldron in which

140
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,833
I mixed a syncretic
stew of Vedic,

141
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:58,000
Egyptian, and Celtic myths.

142
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:59,833
On the language front.

143

We're giving them a
simplified written alphabet.

144
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:06,333
But I expect integration of
this to take quite some time.

145
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:09,416
[BLACK KING] And how will
you foster a sense of unity?

146
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,250
My people have
precious little in common.

147
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,416
Goblins and Kobolds today,

148
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,833
but in the time to come,
many will join us.

149
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,375
We need to be a haven for all.

150
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,041
They will speak as one.

151
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,625
They will work towards
their mutual betterment.

152
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:28,333
And when they worship, their
acts of devotion will all align.

153
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:31,166
Thus will those
branded monsters,

154
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:37,375
forge a new civilization, and
cast humanity into the dust.

What happened?

158
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:48,750
He beat you.

159
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:51,000
The dragon cavalry
brought you here.

160
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:54,750
[JOAN OF ARC grunts]
What of Gilles?!

161
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:58,666
[ANASTASIA] They killed him.
He's nothing but salt now.

[JOAN OF ARC gasps, grunts]

163
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:01,791
What will you do?

164
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,833
They will burn!
All of them!

165
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,250
Nyet, Joan.

166
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:10,583
You underestimated them.
And it nearly cost your life.

167
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,666
[JOAN OF ARC grunts]
This time I'll kill them!

168
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,458
I'll blacken their bones!

169
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,250
Blood for blood!
This is my right!

170
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,125
[ANASTASIA]
Silence.

171
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:22,458
[ANASTASIA] You will be patient.
And when the time is right,

172
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:26,500
I will help you to slake
your thirst for their blood.

173
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:32,291
[JOAN OF ARC grunts]
Drifter Bastard.

174
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:35,583
When I find you,
you will burn.

175
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,291
What a sight it will make!

176
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:41,625
Your face melting away
from your very skull!

177
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,083
[RASPUTIN]
How did it go, Princess?

178
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,125
She is awake at last.

179
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:49,083
Miraculous for one whose
skull took such a blow.

180
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,666
The Black Lord himself
tended to her wound.

181
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,916
I'm just surprised she didn't

182
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,833
succumb to her injuries
while en route.

183
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:59,708
[RASPUTIN] The Drifter leader,
that samurai Toyohisa.

184
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:04,416
I am surprised he would spare
a foe simply for being a woman.

185
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,125
Maybe he went easy on her.

186
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,916
Who can say?

187
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,666
He fought with her, but he
refused to finish her off.

188
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,083
Instead he brained her
and left her in a well,

189
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,083
still quite alive.

190
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:20,875
These are the acts
of a contradictory man.

191
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,291
Thus behaves their
warrior caste.

192
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,666
They elude all understanding.

193
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,500
Eight hundred years
of their feudal system

194
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,166
and still they just
murder each other

195
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,041
for the same
tiny specks of earth

196

amid the waters of the Pacific.

197
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,875
Yet their descendants defeated
our Russia in battle!

His treatment of Joan has
struck a nerve with you.

Hasn't it, Princess?

Stop this! I beg of you!

Well? Which are you?
A Drifter, or an End?

Yeah, I think your people

at death's door!

[OLMINU] There should be
enough food in this storehouse

If they want to keep eating,

maybe they should
cook for themselves!

for a thing like that?

coulda gone either way.

I hope this missive find
you well. In retrospect,

I realize how unfailingly
loyal you all were to me.

All except you, Mistuhide.

267
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:22,291
I'm going to kill you
the first chance I get!

268
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:27,541
[exhales] Let's have a look
at that "musket," yeah?

269
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,666
[NOBUNAGA]
Just treat it with care.

We ain't gonna break it!

271
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,916
[DWARF B]
An iron tube of some kind.

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,708
Mounted onto the wood.

273
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:42,375
They hot-rolled the iron,
like as not.

274
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,208
[DWARF C] Trigger mechanism's
the same as what ya see

275
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:47,791
on a crossbow.
That part's simple enough.

276
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,041
[DWARF D] Seems the
spring causes this iron bit

277
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,125
to drop down onto the metal pan.

278
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,291
To what end, I wonder?

279
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,625
And how does the
tube come into play?

280
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:58,250
[DWARF E] The wood's just wood,
from the sight of it.

281
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,458
[chuckles]

282
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,833
So, what's this posh
walking stick good for?

283
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:06,625
Uh... killing.
And it does its job well.

284
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:09,000
Gunpowder ignites at the
one end of the cylinder,

285

firing a lead bullet
into your foe.

286
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:17,250
Weaponry! Of course.
Wicked little contraption.

287
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:21,125
Killing your foe from
afar can be right useful.

288
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:24,541
But why bother setting tiny
explosions to get it done?

289
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:27,375
Arrows and crossbows
kill 'em just as dead.

290
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,666
I don't see the need
for this frippery.

291
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:33,958
I'm a bit confused on that
point myself, Lord Nobunaga.

292
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,625
Bows are silent, and fall well
within our means to make,

293
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:39,208
so why this passion
for the musket?

294
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,375
Well... uh...

295
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,875
The noise and smoke
both play a role.

296
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,416
How do I put it?

297
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,625
[TOYOHISA] A musket's battle-cry
can freeze your blood.

298
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:51,458
You compound the terror
with every bullet fired.

299
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,750
And it's an easy
weapon to pick up.

300
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,166
Arm peasants at dawn,

301
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,583
and they can kill trained
soldiers by nightfall.

302
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:02,083
[NOBUNAGA] Yes, as I thought,
the lad's no fool.

303
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,916
But fighting is all he knows.

304
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,208
Their range and stopping power
are impressive, sure.

305
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:11,791
But muskets are a boon
for more than those alone.

306
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:16,250
They make killing so easy.
The merest twitch of a finger.

307
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,416
In a land with muskets,

308
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,791
anyone can take
to the battlefield.

309
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:24,958
A nation at the ready,
all citizens primed for combat.

310
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:28,916
That part I'd be wise

[gasps]
What's that?

315
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,916
I've been eyeing
this iron cylinder.

316
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,291
From the muckit
or what-have-ya.

317
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,916
The blacksmiths of your
country are no joke,

But, there's no
bestin' a Dwarf.

320
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:53,416
Here. Give it a look.

321
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,333
Wha-- You mean to tell
me you've made one?

322
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,250
I showed it to
you yesterday!

323
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,833
[DWARF CHIEF]
Schematic would've been

324
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,750
a different kettle of fish, but
you brought us the real thing.

325
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:05,583
Easy to figure it out
when you're holdin' onto it.

326
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:10,416
Give it a try. Should work
as well as that original.

327
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,250
[NOBUNAGA]
If all the forges in this place

328
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,916
were brought up
to full efficiency,

329
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,333
how many of these
could we make?

330

This town kept more'n half of
their soldiers clad and armed,

and that with us starving.

Giving the task our best effort,

333
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:28,166
that'll be a better
situation for all involved.

334

Let's see, then...

335
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:32,666
Can't forget there will be
a bit of a learning curve.

336
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,333
Little trickier then
a halberd or sword.

337
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,083
Seven or eight's feasible.

Maybe ten, once we've really
hit our stride with 'em.

That's the best you can do?
Not even a dozen muskets?

What do you want, man?
Ten muckits a day is plenty!

341
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,250
No need to dress us down!

00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:50,750
[NOBUNAGA]
A day?!

343

gathered up our young men.

Said he wanted to work the
food off. Practice a little.

352
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:15,958
How on earth he was able
to guess which of you

Dwarves are young,
I'll never understand.

You all look old to me.

355
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:21,625
Is that a curse?

Go to hell!

We're no strangers to war!

Every blow is lethal
when a Dwarf fights!

359

We put all of our passion into
one swing of the battleaxe!

360

That strike was the Jigen-style.
Didn't think I'd see it here.

Uh, Jigen? Never heard of it.

362
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,208
A type of swordplay.

363
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:46,375
It was popular among the
young men in my province.

364
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,583
I didn't have time to pursue it.

365

master the Taisha style.

Your mind's as empty

But why did you help
found Orte, then?

408

How could a Drifter do that?

Bite your tongue, you!

Do you really think the
Ends have the wherewithal

411
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:42,583
to create a nation
on par with this one?

412
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,375
Adolph Hitler was a Drifter,

and I defy you to show
me a finer specimen!

414

The government he
created here as Father

415
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,125
was the model of efficiency.

416
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:53,166
It was ruthless
and lean and pure,

417
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,166
like nothing you've ever seen!

418

He bent the chaos into order
through sheer force of will.

419
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,708
The people took pride
in their country,

420

buoyed by this
new sense of self.

421
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:05,958
And I took my 30% finder's fee.

We did incredible work,
ol' Dolphy and I.

We made a kingdom that's
been at perpetual war

They remind me of
a man I once knew.

He was sly and when
he took his own life,

428
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:23,208
he filled a flawless
teapot full of gunpowder

429
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:25,583
and blew it to hell,
just to spite me.

430
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:26,916

If so, we must be vigilant.

00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:45,125
So. What brought you out here,
Count Saint-Germain?

437
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:46,541
[SAINT GERMI]
I came to judge whether

438
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:50,500
you're worth my switching

And much like the fire-witch,
I can't tell your gender.

Who are you, stranger?
Are you a man of Orte?

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,583
[FULAME grunts]
For Allister!

467
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:02,791
Nothing can stop me

468
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,791
but a ponytailed boy
with hair over one eye,

469
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:07,291
and what are the odds of
anyone matching all that?

470
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:09,333
Toyohisa. A word, if I may?

471
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:10,833
[shouts]

472
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:12,958
[SAINT GERMI] By now, my valets
are testing your leader.

473
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:16,416
Pray that he passes muster,
lest they leave him a corpse.

474
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,125
Though, I'll have
my answer either way.

475
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,166
[FULAME groans]
Contessa!

476
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,333
Help us, Your Loveliness!

[ALLISTER grunts]

478
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:26,875
That's enough outta you two!

479
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:28,791
Toyohisa, how'd it go?

480
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:34,166
The training? Fine. I mean,
except for these fops.

481
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:37,250
And again I don't know if
I'm allowed to take a head.

482
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:39,583
Who's this one?

483
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:41,291
[SAINT GERMI]
I am a turncoat.

484
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:42,541
Why should I believe it?

485
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:45,000
[SAINT GERMI] It's true.
I come bearing gifts.

486
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:47,208
The Empire on a silver platter.

487
00:24:47,291 --> 00:24:50,083
I suppose you could call
it a dowry of sorts.

488
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:50,958
Dowry?

489
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:52,375
Silver platter?

490
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:54,583
Hear me out, gentle folk.

491
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:57,541
A nation is much like
a tree being cut down.

492
00:24:57,625 --> 00:25:00,416
If it's carelessly felled,
what remains is useless.

493
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,666
If other countries
should smell the blood,

494
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:05,458
they'll set at Orte
like it's a suckling pig.

495
00:25:05,541 --> 00:25:07,375
They'll carve up the
kingdom and trundle home,

496
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:09,416
leaving a carcass in their wake.

497
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,750
All right, so what
do you have in mind?

498
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:13,625
Why throw in with us?

499
00:25:13,708 --> 00:25:16,166
We need to topple
Orte with a single blow,

500
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,875
while it still
projects the illusion

501
00:25:17,958 --> 00:25:22,166
of strength and unassailability
to its neighbors.

502
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,875
Interested?
