1
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:38,208
[EASY laughs] So what if
you brought them over?

2
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:40,791
Your stupid little Drifters.

3
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:43,625
All you're doing is tossing
'em into a meat-grinder.

4
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:48,250
They don't stand a snowball's
chance in hell against my Ends.

5
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:50,958
You know in your heart
I'm gonna win this thing.

6
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:53,291
All you're doing is
running down the clock.

7
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:58,291
Admit defeat like the bland
bureaucrat you are, Murasaki!

8
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:04,125
[gasps]

9
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:07,083
[EASY]
You son of a bitch!

10
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:12,958
[OLMINU]
You're not the only ones.

11
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:16,041
People like you, who were
brought here from your world.

12
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:18,541
People of singular skill,

13
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:21,000
are known in this
world as Drifters.

14
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:24,083
But others have been brought
here from your realm, too.

15
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:26,791
Those given over to darkness.

16
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:29,833
They delight in death.

17
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:32,083
We call them, the Ends.

18
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:35,208
As sworn members of the
Octobrist Organization,

19
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:38,416
it's our job to evaluate
Drifters like you,

20
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,541
so that we may unite
them against the Ends,

21
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:43,375
and safeguard our world.

22
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:45,958
So, uh, wanna untie me now?

23
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:47,291
Not a chance!

24
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:49,666
That was just gibberish
falling outta your mouth.

25
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,541
--[OLMINU grunts]
--[NOBUNAGA laughs]

26
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:55,166
If you think I'm a Drifter,
you're mistaken.

27
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:59,208
But you're equally wrong
if you think I'm an End.

28
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:00,750
Yes!

29
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:03,875
Behold the Demon King of the
Sixth Heaven in all his glory!

30
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:07,333
Your "good" and "evil"?

31
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:11,041
These words are nothing
to one such as I!

32
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:16,291
[grunts] I exist beyond
your petty judgment!

33
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:19,083
[TOYOHISA] Look at you,
bellowing like a kabuki actor.

34
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:20,416
Have you no shame?

35
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,666
Not really.

36
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,166
Course not.
The way you carry on,

37
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,291
why should I
expect any subtlety?

38
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:29,041
So. Why do you think
that we're Drifters?

39
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:32,333
Because, I can't imagine
you joining the other side.

40
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:35,000
[chuckles]
How so?

41
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:36,125
[OLMINU]
Those brought here as Ends

42
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:38,875
have cast aside their
former humanity.

43
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:42,916
They hate humanity now.
They want no part of it.

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,458
They look at their fellow man
as something worthless.

45
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,833
A blight, a spreading cancer.

46
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:50,333
I don't know what could have
happened to them in your world

47
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:52,166
to inspire such rage.

48
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,000
But now they burn with it.

49
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,208
The rage fuels and
sustains them.

50
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,583
It's turned each of them
into something less,

51
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,916
and something more.

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,708
Every thought and deed
in service of one goal,

53
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:07,708
The slaughter of all mankind.

54
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:09,166
They first gathered
in the north,

55
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,083
bending the monsters
to their dark will,

56
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,375
before leading an army
of them into our land.

57
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:14,875
If we don't stop them,

58
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:17,875
they will destroy everything
good and pure in the world.

59
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,500
That's why I beg of you.

60
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:22,708
Please help us. We can't
win this fight alone!

61
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:24,875
So how robust is your army?

62
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,375
Army?

63
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,125
[NOBUNAGA] I don't give a
damn if they're monsters or men.

64
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,333
What's clear is,
your foe has troops.

65
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:34,375
You Octobrists must have some
kind of standing army in place.

66
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:38,250
W-Well? We, uh... That is...

67
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,583
"As sworn members
of the Octobrists,

68
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,375
it's our job to evaluate
Drifters like--!"

69
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:43,791
[NOBUNAGA]
So nothing?

70
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,416
[OLMINU] Uh... We put
out the call for troops

71
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,583
to various kings
and feudal lords

72
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:50,916
and then we'll assign Drifters
to command those forces.

73
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,333
You are such an idiot!

74
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:55,875
[OLMINU whimpers]

75
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,458
[NOBUNAGA] I don't know the
particulars of your world yet,

76
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:58,791
but I know this much;

77
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:01,041
A lord holds the reins
to his soldiers.

78
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:03,833
That's what makes him
lord in the first place.

79
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:06,666
No ruler will ever
cede control of his men.

80
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,958
Especially not to
some untested outsider!

81
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,541
It doesn't matter
how terrifying

82
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:15,083
these Ends of yours may
be out on the battlefield.

83
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:18,625
A king is gonna value his
pride over his own head.

84
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:21,583
Even as his foes pour
into his last stronghold,

85
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,250
a leader will keep his
troops on a tight leash,

86
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,708
'til it's time to
slit his own belly.

87
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:30,583
You should know that, idiot.

88
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:35,166
A lord's a lord most anywhere.
People are ruled by emotion,

89
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,041
whether they live
in a palace or a hut.

90
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,791
I'm an avid student of
the human condition.

91
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,666
Almost won me Japan.

92
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,291
[TOYOHISA] This old trickster.
Is he the real Oda Nobunaga?

93
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:49,541
Or just a deluded fool
who wishes it were so?

94
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,750
[OLMINU]
Then what're we to do?

95
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,833
Only Drifters have any
chance of winning.

96
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,083
But you'd need an
army at your back!

97
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:59,291
[NOBUNAGA] The answer
is staring you in the face.

98
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:02,750
We Drifters will overthrow
all of your feudal lords!

99
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,125
[gasps]

100
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,583
From this point on,

101
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:08,791
Toyohisa will lead us on a
mission of utter conquest.

102
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,041
[TOYOHISA]
Huh?

103
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,250
And you will support us.

104
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:15,333
Help us topple your empire
for the sake of this world!

105
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,208
This is no time for
half-measures, woman!

106
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,750
You must be bold!

107
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:22,041
Wait a damn second! Why am I
suddenly in charge of all this?

108
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:23,583
[YOICHI]
Huh?

109
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:26,333
Don't you remember taking the
leader's spot the other day?

110
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:27,833
[NOBUNAGA]
Bet you're beat!

111
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:30,583
Please, make yourself comfy
on this nearby wooden crate!

112

[growls]

113
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,875
Of course there was an angle!

114
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,958
You have met Oda, right?

115
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:40,083
You're not much of
a tactician, are ya, kid?

116
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,583
[TOYOHISA]
Why I oughtta!

117
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,750
[ALL shouting]

118
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:47,708
[OLMINU sighs] Grand Master,
these Drifters are insane.

119
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:51,458
The way they're behaving;
it's simply barbaric!

120
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:58,250
[OLMINU] That said, their idea
does have a certain appeal.

121
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,375
[OLMINU] Unfortunately,
we've suffered many

122
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,625
an attack by the Ends before.

123
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,458
[OLMINU]
And every time,

124
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:13,250
the death and destruction they
wrought were overwhelming.

125
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:18,458
But now the carnage is absolute.
Half-measures are useless!

126
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:21,541
They mean to slay
every one of us!

127
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:27,750
[OLMINU] All by decree
of their Black King!

128
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:30,791
[RASPUTIN] My Dark Majesty.
The Northern Wall of Carneades

129
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:33,541
has been reduced to
so much broken stone.

130
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,041
[BLACK KING]
What of our losses, Rasputin?

131
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,125
I would know of them.

132
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,583
[RASPUTIN]
Two hundred seventy-four dead

133
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:43,083
from the Goblin special forces.
345 from the Kobold

134
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:47,041
advanced guard and
four dragons shot down.

135
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,958
Our losses were by
no means substantial,

136
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:53,000
but the dragons will
be hard to replace.

137
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,958
[BLACK KING] Bring me
to those who need succor.

138
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,875
Do you mean... to aid them?

139
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:03,583
[BLACK KING]
With all of my heart.

140
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:09,041
Goblins, Kobolds, and Dragons
each have served me faithfully.

141
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:13,833
I will save whom I can,
for they are my brethren.

142
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:17,541
You are mercy incarnate,
Your Highness.

you took on these wounds
in my name. Come forth.

[BLACK KING] Send word
to all who would listen.

152
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,625
The Northern Wall is no more.

153
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:03,500
There are many who believe
the humans to be unbeatable.

154
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,000
A force eternal. This will
gladden their hearts

155
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,708
and they will
bolster our ranks.

156

[BLACK KING]
Once, I loved mankind.

[ELF B] Someone break
them up! Quickly!

[ELVES shouting]

316
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,333
[sighs]
This brings back memories

317
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:57,583
of how we used to fight.

318
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,000
Well met, Brother!

319
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:01,458
The ten of us have pledged
fealty to the Taira clan!

320
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:03,291
ou're with the Genji, right?

321
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,916
Great! Then it's brother
against brother!

322
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,083
[YOICHI BROTHERS]
Fight us! Fight us!

323
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,541
[YOICHI] Ten of them
against me by my lonesome.

324
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,333
What fun we had!

325
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,916
I would do it again in a second.

326
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,291
[YOICHI shouts]

327
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,333
What the hell was that for?!

328
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:19,875
[YOICHI laughs]

329
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:22,291
You're an archer, jackass!

330
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,125
[SHARA grunts]
That's quite enough!

331
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,250
[ALL]
Hm?

332
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,083
Whatever your quarrel may be,

333
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:33,833
this is no time for fighting
amongst one another!

334
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:36,083
The lord's men could
be approaching!

335
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,375
What's your name?

336
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,500
I am the son of the
village elder they killed.

337
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:43,041
I'm Shara. You saved
my brothers' lives.

338
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:46,000
Ah! So he's your big brother?

339
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,375
[BOTH]
Mm-hm!

340
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:48,666
[NOBUNAGA
"Could be approaching"?

341
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,333
Don't make me laugh.

342
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:54,375
Of course they're coming.
No doubt about it.

343
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:57,541
Not a-one of those soldiers
made it out of here alive.

344
00:17:57,625 --> 00:18:01,708
Only question is how long it'll
take to muster reinforcements.

345
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:04,041
I think four days
would prove sufficient.

346
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,541
Too long.

347
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,500
The dead were well-armed.

348
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,250
Gear's no issue.

349
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,833
Closer to three.

350
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,708
My clan could have
done it in one.

351
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,958
That's because you had
nothing better to do!

352
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:17,041
Living out in the damn sticks!

353
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:21,000
Point being, the sunrise
after the next,

354
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:24,708
will be the last
this village sees.

355
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:27,333
Then help us! Or we're doomed!

356
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,833
Lend us your strength,
that we may survive!

357
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:33,541
My people are unschooled
in the ways of combat!

358
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:34,916
Forty years ago,

359
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,208
when our land was
conquered by the cruel Orte,

360
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,583
we were but children.

361
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,000
Our men who could fight

362
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:44,291
all died in the futile
quest to defend us.

363
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:47,875
When it comes to warfare,
we are worse than useless!

364
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,333
I ask--no--I beg you!

365
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,125
[NOBUNAGA, YOICHI, TOYOHISA]
Heh?

366
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:55,750
Tsh. I'm still hung up
on one of the details.

367
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,541
You, with the ears!
How old're you?

368
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:01,208
Uh... only 106.

369
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,791
[BOTH gasp]

370
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,250
Don't lie to me, elf.

371
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:07,041
I've killed men for
less back in my homeland.

372
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,750
I'm telling the truth.

373
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,708
Okay. How old're you two, then?

374
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,541
I'm 39.

375
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm 36.

376
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,791
[ALL gasp]

377
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,833
[NOBUNAGA]
Boobine! How can this be true?

378
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,125
It's Olmine!

379
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,375
You're never gonna
remember my name, are you?!

380
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:24,291
And who said you could honk
my boob with wild abandon?!

381
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,500
The Elves are blessed
with great longevity.

382
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,166
Five to six times greater
than yours or mine.

383
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,041
So they mature
more slowly overall.

384
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,458
What's the matter?

385
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,500
Yeah, what's wrong?

386
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,333
I'm younger'n them!

387
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:40,666
Years ago, this was part
of the Elves' own country.

388
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,375
Before a human
kingdom conquered it.

389
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:44,833
Orte.

390
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,291
Orte defeated their Dwarven
and Halfling neighbors in

391
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:48,791
a similar fashion.

392
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,208
Forcing those once-free people

393
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:54,125
to toil to the kingdom's benefit
in the fields and mines.

394
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:57,041
From then on, Orte's fancied
itself an empire,

395
00:19:57,125 --> 00:20:00,708
championing human
supremacy with an iron fist.

396
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:04,208
Is it still expanding,
this "Orte Empire?"

397
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:05,958
[OLMINU] They're waging
numerous battles.

398
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:09,583
Locked in perpetual combat
to retain their holdings.

399
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,416
[NOBUNAGA]
Much as I'd expect.

400
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,708
Hanging onto one's
spoils is the real pisser.

401
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:18,166
You have only two choices
once you've taken a place.

402
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,625
Either you destroy it entirely,

403
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:25,125
or attend to its every need,
like a doting paramour.

404
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,625
[OLMINU] The Orte of
old would have been

405
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,625
a good ally to have at
our side during a war

406
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:32,375
with the Black King,
but much has changed.

407
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:35,958
[NOBUNAGA] Instead, the Elves
were left to nurse their grudge.

408
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:38,166
Forty years
it's festered now.

409
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,125
Every mother's son is filled
with the embers of rage,

410
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,541
and the lord's men fanned them

411
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,750
to full strength
with that attack.

412
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,041
That's why they were so quick

413
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:48,625
to skewer the knight
after a little prodding.

414
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:52,083
But the punishment will
be swift, and harsh.

415
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,625
More soldiers are
marching here as we speak,

416
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,333
with orders to leave
none of you alive.

417

Tell me, how will you face
this threat, Toyohisa?

418
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,666
You are the commander,
after all.

419

Come, pride of the Shimazu.

Let's see your
tactics in action.

421
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,416
[TOYOHISA]
We let them in.

422
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,333
And then we cut them down.

[ORTE SOLDIER A]
Isn't this a bit much?

425

Deploying 200 soldiers to wipe

426
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,666
one measly Elven
village off the map?

If you believe the rumors,

not Elves, who killed 'em all.

Wait... Drifters?

[ORTE SOLDIER F] Not even
a bunch. Only a handful.

They wouldn't just leave.

This makes no sense!
