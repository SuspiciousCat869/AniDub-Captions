1
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:40,000
Mistress Phryne!
Mistress Phryne!

2
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:42,750
She's absconded...! There can
be no other explanation!

3
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:44,750
Calm yourselves.

4
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:50,166
Remember... Phryne
cannot have gone too far...

5
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,958
All parts of this world
are connected...

6
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:55,291
Every road is but another
twist in the grand knot

7
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:57,458
of which we are all part.

8
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:59,375
We shall bring her back soon...

9
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:02,875
Along with the key to the
world which she has taken...

10
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:06,666
And when we do, she will
be rightly punished.

11
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,458
Ta-da!

12
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,833
--Hiya!
--Uh... Uh...

13
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:20,833
Who are you...?

14
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:22,416
Oh, no! My manners are so bad!

15
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,750
I can do a way better
greeting than that...

16
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:30,708
Hello...! Who are you?

17
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:32,250
Clain.

18
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,583
 Good morning, world!

19
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:39,875
And a great big good
morning to Clain!

20
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,708
You're a...

21
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,125
I'm a...?

22
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:47,666
This is probably a dumb
question, but are you a dopple?

23
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:52,541
'Cause... It's almost like I
could reach out and touch you.

24
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:55,708
You wanna pat my head
and see if you're right...?

25
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:59,291
Oh, don't be so shy...
You'll never know if you don't!

26
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:05,500
This is unreal!

27
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,541
That's what everyone
says... Like reaching out

28
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:10,125
and touching someone's the
most mysterious thing ever...

29
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,958
Nessa likes being
mysterious, though.

30
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:13,958
Nessa?

31
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,291
That's m'name!

32
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,875
Is Phryne playing some
kind of trick on me?

33
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:18,875
Phryne?

34
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,458
Oh, c'mon. Really...?

35
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:23,833
You can't tell me you don't even
know the girl who left you here?

36
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:27,708
Nessa got left by this person?

37
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,083
Why did Phryne leave...?

38
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:32,791
Did Nessa do something
to make her angry?

39
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,125
No, no...! I mean, I don't
think that's the case...

40
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,125
Yay! She doesn't hate me!

41
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:41,000
Nessa really doesn't like the
thought of making people angry.

42
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:44,625
Nessa likes making people as
happy as they can possibly be!

43
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:47,291
Cha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha!

44
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:50,708
♪ I look up to the sky... ♪

45
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:53,166
♪ and offer my wish
to the Day Star... ♪

46
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,458
What is going on?

47
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:59,125
If she's not Phryne's dopple,
whose is she...?

48
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:02,500
Safe bet they're a weirdo,
whoever they are...

49
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:05,958
Which does make Phryne
the obvious suspect...

50
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,541
A great big good morning to you!

51
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:14,208
How many girls do you bring
home when we're not around?

52
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:15,750
It's not what
you think, I swear!

53
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,333
She's just something the girl
from yesterday left behind!

54
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,166
Left behind?

55
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,833
Cute!

56
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,083
How can she touch Jackie?

57
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:31,958
Oh, I see... She's not a human
girl, is she? That's different.

58
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,416
That's what I'm saying...
I don't know what she is.

59
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,291
Regardless, you'd better
get her back to her owner.

60
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:38,625
Failing that,
the only thing for it

61
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,583
is to hand her off
to the police.

62
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:41,625
Aw, c'mon!

63
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,666
Now, hey. Does she
belong to you?

64
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,958
Clain!

65
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:48,416
Look...! It turns
into a giant bow!

66
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,750
Even if Phryne wanted
this whatever it is back,

67
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,250
I don't have the first
clue where to find her.

68
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:05,458
Look! Those birds are so
happy they're floating on air!

69
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,291
Nessa thinks birds are neat...

70
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,250
Hey...! Do you know if
Phryne thinks birds are neat?

71
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,958
How the heck should I know?

72
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,708
Phryne...

73
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:19,000
If I manage to track you down...

74
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:21,833
You've got some serious
explaining to do...

75
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,500
The wind feels so
good on my face!

76
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,166
It must think I'm really cute,

77
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,791
'cause it can't stop
tickling my cheeks!

78
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,083
Stop messin' around
up there! You'll fall.

79
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,541
Nessa!

80
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,416
See? What'd I tell you...?

81
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,458
Good thing you're just
a dopple, sort of...

82
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,458
Otherwise you
might've been hurt.

83
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:55,666
Uh, hello?

84
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,208
Clain?

85
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,416
Touch my face.

86
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,083
What are you talking
about? Why should I?

87
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:04,708
Touch me.

88
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,958
You did it...!
You do like me!

89
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,541
No need to make a
big deal out of it!

90
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,750
Clain really likes Nessa.

91
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,750
Why have so many buildings

92
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:33,125
if they're all empty
and sad looking...?

93
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,208
Nessa doesn't like quiet.

94
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,750
Ah-ha! A real person!

95
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,708
You really don't know how
anything works, do you...?

96
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:46,458
Basic facilities are
all that're left here...

97
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:49,583
There's a police
station... a store...

98
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,541
Some other stuff, too,
but not a whole lot...

99
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,541
No one actually
lives here anymore.

100
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:54,958
Huh?

101
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,708
Look, I don't know how
to say this nicely,

102
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,666
but you can't stay
at my place...

103
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,916
Why not give here
a try? Sure, it's...

104
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:07,125
Yay! A clock tower!

105
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,541
Hold up!

106
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:22,833
Bwong bwong bwong bwong...

107
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:26,041
Nessa...! You can't just go
in there without permission!

108
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:30,416
Bwong bwong bwong bwong...

109
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,541
Will you listen to me?!

110
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:37,625
Wow! Beautiful!

111
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,875
Look at all the
vehicle-thingies!

112
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,250
Are all of those
people on vacation?

113
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,833
No, those are caravans.
That's where they live.

114
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,250
What?

115
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:57,208
Some people like not being tied
down to any one place...

116
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,666
That way whenever a star falls

117
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,583
they just kind of pick
up and move on.

118
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,375
--Star?
--You know, balloons...

119
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:05,875
Radio waves are usually stronger
around an old downtown...

120
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,750
When you can go where you
want to, you can tune in easier.

121
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,458
But you still have a
normal house, don't you?

122
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:14,875
Well, yeah... See,
I'm obsessed with old stuff...

123
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:18,333
Heh. My mom says I have too
much of it and it's clutter.

124
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,708
Those people have
lost their way.

125
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,375
None of 'em have real homes...

126
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,833
All they do is wander around
from place to place.

127
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:29,166
It's not all that bad...
If they had a real home,

128
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,833
it's not like they'd have
anybody but dopples

129
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:33,083
waiting there
for them anyway...

130
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,958
This way they can go
where the wind takes them

131
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,666
without answering to anyone...

132
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,083
Believe me, having a picket
fence and a thatched roof

133
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,708
isn't always everything
it's cracked up to be.

134
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:49,708
How can she be so fast?
This is getting ridiculous!

135
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:09,750
Look, please...
Stop taking off like that!

136
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:12,541
Sir? What is this
you're watching?

137
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,333
Excuse me, but wouldn't it
make you ten times happier

138
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:22,625
for someone to pat
you on the head?

139
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:30,250
Wow! So if they actually
sleep in these things,

140
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,291
where do they go
to the bathroom?

141
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,125
Awww... It's gone bye-bye.

142
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,458
You've got to be kidding me!

143
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,625
Uh, I think we should--

144
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,500
Look! Cuteness...!

145
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:53,208
That baby's having so much fun
its face is getting all dimply!

146
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:57,291
Will you pay attention...?!
Oh, come on!

147
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,041
It's flying!

148
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,250
Now they're all having fun.

149
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,041
It's her fault!
That girl over there

150
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,166
screws up everything
she touches!

151
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,333
You're not leaving without
paying some serious damages!

152
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,041
No one... has ever...

153
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,750
annoyed me so much...
so quickly.

154
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:35,791
Oh wow, that was fun!
So, where do you wanna go next?

155
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,666
The police.

156
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,666
You need to be where they can
keep an eye on you...

157
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,875
You're not my responsibility!

158
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:45,083
Why not...? Nessa really
likes having fun with Clain.

159
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,291
Listen--!

160
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,041
After all, Clain is
where Nessa's home is.

161
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,041
Huh?

162
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,291
That's the way it works,

163
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,208
because you're the one
who brought out Nessa...

164
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,833
From that moment on,
Nessa called

165
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:56,125
wherever Clain
happened to be "home."

166
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:06,375
Her smile... Why
does it... terrify me?

167
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,333
What's wrong?

168
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:09,875
Ugh...

169
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,791
Oh no... That's not good...

170
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,291
Clain can't touch Nessa anymore?

171
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,958
Let's go to the police, then.

172
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,625
Nessa...

173
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:32,625
Bear in mind we can't hold
on to her indefinitely...

174
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,916
Let's just hope someone
makes a claim.

175
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,583
Thank you.

176
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,166
Bye-bye, Clain!

177
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,166
Problem, kid?

178
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,541
 You.

179
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:02,166
Oh well... Now you know
what sabotage feels like...

180
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:05,833
Serves you right...
Pay... back's... a... bitch!

181
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,916
Wonderful.

182
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,583
Seize him!

183
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,708
Yes ma'am!

184
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,250
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

185
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,333
Heave ho! Heave ho!...

186
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:21,333
Oh, would you please!

187
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,291
Sunda!

188
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,583
Here's the package, boss!

189
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,666
What is wrong with you people?

190
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,083
This guy...? Seriously...?

191
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,541
Kinda young to be
hiding a priestess.

192
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,041
What?

193
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:44,291
Spill it, kiddo... Where have
you got the girl holed up?

194
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:48,333
I don't know where she is!
She was gone when I woke up.

195
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:51,208
You... you... you... trash!

196
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,208
So you admit she was with
you before you fell asleep!

197
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,041
You filthy, freakin' pervert!

198
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,166
Sanitize!

199
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,041
Sanitize...!

200
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,458
Enri.

201
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:11,708
So a ladies man...
And still a boy.

202
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,375
Like you're so much
older than me...

203
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,833
If I'm a boy then what
does that make you, buddy?

204
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:18,500
I hear you stirred up quite a
scene at the vagabond camp...

205
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:21,208
You gonna own up to it or
insist I've got the wrong guy?

206
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,458
That wasn't me...

207
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,125
It was Phryne's dopple
or whatever she is...

208
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,666
Yeah?

209
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,750
Yeah...! I lost track of her
before you dragged me here!

210
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,416
Dumb thing's got a mind of
its own... I have no idea--

211
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,250
Liar liar pants on fire!

212
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,250
You say this thing is a "she,"
and yet you expect us

213
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:37,541
to believe you haven't kept
tabs on her you pervert?!

214
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,708
Stop saying crap like that...!

215
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,333
You don't know
anything about me!

216
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:42,541
Okay, you're free
to go... Scoot.

217
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,208
Sunda!

218
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:47,000
Thank you.

219
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,666
Tell me something first...

220
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,166
You people rely on dopples
like fish rely on water...

221
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,250
Except that not even
plankton allow the ocean

222
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,916
to do their breathing for them.

223
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,833
But still... You can't tell me

224
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:05,041
you didn't like the shock
of living life first hand.

225
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,666
Assuming someone your age
even has a frame of reference

226
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,625
for what I'm talking about.

227
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,333
Maybe I don't care.

228
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:17,875
Why go through all that
just to cut me loose?

229
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,166
Either they think my
eyesight's terrible...

230
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,750
Or these doofuses are really,
really bad at tailing.

231
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:36,125
Finally. No Phryne. No Nessa.

232
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,041
Peace and quiet, all the way.

233
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:56,250
Is it me, or... does this
room somehow seem bigger?

234
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,583
Some folks think it's strange
I've never had my own dopple...

235
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,041
Truth is, I just
don't like the idea

236
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,416
of there being another
"me" running around.

237
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,416
So yeah, my "frame of reference"

238
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,041
is a little different
than you'd think.

239
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:15,541
'kay... Searching for...
"Touchable dopple."

240
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:21,625
Bingo. A line's been in
development for a while.

241
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,333
That explains Nessa.

242
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,791
Alright... The dopple's remote
processing unit calculates

243
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:31,875
factors like pressure
accrual and specific gravity--

244
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,583
Knock-off prototypes
have been circulating

245
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,541
on the black market...
as concubines.

246
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,833
I guess I kinda do
look like a pervert.

247
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:43,291
Hold on. To interact
with them physically,

248
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,958
the sim's data has
to be transferred

249
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:47,875
into the target user's
Fractale Terminal.

250
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,125
I haven't done
anything like that!

251
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:55,500
So much for explaining
Little Miss Juggernaut.

252
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,166
Clain.

253
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,500
Why don't you have a seat,
son? We'd like to talk.

254
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:06,333
You know, son. Secrets
are very unhealthy things

255
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:09,083
for a family to turn
a blind eye to.

256
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,916
What your father
means is, well...

257
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,208
If something's on
your mind, we want you

258
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:14,875
to feel you can
share it with us.

259
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,458
What would there be?

260
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,625
Your mother and I
simply feel that...

261
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,291
well, that here lately
you just haven't

262
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,125
been acting like
the Clain we know.

263
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,833
You hang out in
unseemly places, and...

264
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,458
You bring strange girls home.

265
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,583
Wait... I know how
it looks, but Phryne--

266
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:35,166
I'm not done. We allow
you to live alone

267
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,583
because we've always felt that
you were mature for your age.

268
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:38,916
That we could trust you.

269
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,125
And we think it's time
you thought of our trust

270
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:44,291
more like a responsibility
than a privilege.

271
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:45,541
If you're so concerned about

272
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,833
keeping tabs on me
twenty-four-seven...

273
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,083
then why don't the
two of you come here

274
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,458
and live with me in person?

275
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,166
Oh don't be absurd, Clain.

276
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,458
Our essential freedoms would be
compromised if we did that...

277
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,833
It's only through a respect
for those freedoms

278
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,041
that a family can
function to begin with.

279
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:02,666
We'd be glorified
babysitters otherwise.

280
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,750
Imagine this family
living under one roof...

281
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,666
We'd essentially be keeping
one another prisoner.

282
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,291
That's the way it works,

283
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,041
because you're the one
who brought out Nessa...

284
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:16,875
From that moment on,
wherever Clain was was home.

285
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,083
Look, if you weren't important
to us, your mother and I

286
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:22,041
wouldn't use our dopples to
watch over you as we do.

287
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:25,166
Spin it however you want to...
You're too wrapped up

288
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,333
in yourselves to really
care about my life.

289
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:29,958
This is exactly what I'm
talking about. This isn't you.

290
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,541
Where does this come from?

291
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,500
You've never talked to
your father that way--

292
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:34,833
'kay. Whatever.

293
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,250
Clain!

294
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:37,833
Maybe it's just your dopples...

295
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,833
Maybe there's a glitch in your
frequencies that makes it seem

296
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:41,541
like I'm acting different.

297
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,083
What's wrong with me...?

298
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,500
It feels like I've been
running for hours...

299
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:02,791
It's like something inside
me's about to tear open...

300
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:05,833
Who runs at full tilt
like this for no reason?

301
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,583
My lungs are
practically fighting

302
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,500
to burst out of my throat...

303
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,416
I am completely alone...

304
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,291
And it's not fair to blame
Mom and Dad, either...

305
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,625
I'm mature enough
to know that...

306
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,750
I choose to be alone...

307
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:44,833
I can't be bothered to risk
having to change pace...

308
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,166
That's why I shrugged Nessa off.

309
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,708
Time for the eight
o'clock prayer...

310
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:59,333
You're not fooling
anyone with that crap...

311
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,583
All you want is my data...

312
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,458
All of this is
just a stupid trick

313
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:04,958
to keep us happy and alone.

314
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:07,791
...let us pray together.

315
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:08,916
Unless...

316
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,083
♪ I look up to the sky... ♪

My wish...

319
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:24,416
Is it that I want to
see Phryne again...?

320
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,958
Or say I'm sorry to Nessa...?

321
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,666
I'm not really sure...

322
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,750
But...

323
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:34,208
I know... I don't
want to be alone.

324
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:38,500
Hey!

325
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:44,416
Hey! Hey!!!

326
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,958
You know... Her smile
isn't that scary.

327
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:06,250
Clain! I'm home!

328
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:09,375
Actually... It's kinda nice.

329
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,708
Welcome back.

330
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,791
You're so warm!

331

So are you.

332
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,750
I don't think I've ever seen any
people worse at what they do...

333
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,333
It's ridiculous.

334
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,750
I spy something cool!

335
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:41,791
You what...?

336
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,458
Nessa!

337
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,708
Oldest trick in the book...
and you fell for it!

338
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:57,250
I didn't fall for it...
Technically.

339
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,708
They sure got us, huh?

340
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,166
The rooster's in the hen house!
Tag 'em and bag 'em!

341
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,583
Right!

342
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,458
C'mon! What are you doing?

343
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:13,000
Whoa! We're flying!
