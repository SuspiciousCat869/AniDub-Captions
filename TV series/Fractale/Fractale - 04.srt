1
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:40,000
Welcome back, my sister.

2
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,791
The stars are glad.

3
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:51,750
I implore each of you to
all look up to the stars

4
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:53,750
and give them
your prayers...

5
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:55,333
Be at peace.
Bask in abundance...

6
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:58,416
Crooked bastards are going right
on with the updating process...

7
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:01,750
Alright, plan A has
been officially thrown

8
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:05,375
out the window...
Time for plan B...

9
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,416
Bag ourselves a priestess!

10
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:10,666
Don't let them
infiltrate the altar!

11
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,250
Nessa, c'mon...!

12
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,625
Snap out of it; we've got to
get out of here right now.

13
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:18,333
It's Phryne...

14
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:21,000
Eternal happiness will
reign for the simple effort

15
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,583
of our obeisance to the sky.

16
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:38,500
Wha... What happened?

17
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,708
What the hell have
they done to us...?!

18
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:44,291
They're all...

19
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:50,750
Please...! Someone help us!

20
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,416
This should make
things easier.

21
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,958
Follow my lead, okay?
Don't be scared...

22
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,916
We're gonna have
a word with Phryne.

23
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,541
My Sister...

24
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:07,875
Come with us.

25
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,875
Phryne!

26
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:21,416
No!! What are you thinking?!

27
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,083
It's her!

28
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,791
Look alive or you can stay here!

29
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,833
We're gonna call it a day.

30
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,000
I've got the whole
world in my hands...

31
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,833
Somehow I thought it'd be a
little harder to get to.

32
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,875
Move it, dumbass!

33
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,500
What're you waiting for?!

34
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,208
Stop where you are!

35
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,291
Don't let them get away!

36
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:23,041
Please, Priestess,
can't you see? We're dying!

37
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,833
Unhand me!

38
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:28,708
Ugh. The Archpriestess must hear
of this outrage immediately!

39
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,166
Switch over to manual
navigation...

40
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,458
We don't want the Temple
sniffing us out.

41
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,125
Roger that.

42
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:57,125
Stupid... stupid...
fat bastard...

43
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,666
Would it have killed you
to lose some weight...?

44
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,625
We told you that you
gotta be able to run...

45
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:06,166
Damn you...
Damn you!!!

46
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:15,083
I've never seen a
dead guy before...

47
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,041
Not up close...

48
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:22,333
It's like... It's like he's made
of plastic now or something...

49
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,250
Just like that...

50
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:31,041
These people are murderers...
This is life for them.

51
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,166
Hey, it's me!

52
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,041
Uh... Hello...
How's it going down here?

53
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:01,000
Right, so...
Let's skip the small talk.

54
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:06,083
It's okay, we're going to get
you out... Just hold tight.

55
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,500
Take my word for it,
we're not among friends...

56
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:12,708
Just do me a favor... Take Nessa
back once we're out of here?

57
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:15,625
Argh! This knot's insane...

58
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,333
You're giving Nessa back?

59
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,166
Don't get me wrong,
it's been fun.

60
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,750
But Phryne is where you
really belong, okay?

61
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,000
Ta-da! Freedom!

62
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,833
Just who do you think you are?!

63
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:38,583
What made you think you were
entitled to awaken Nessa?

64
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,083
Wait, what...?

65
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,666
You walked out on me without
so much as saying thank you.

66
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,708
I was curious about the amulet
so I did a little research--

67
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,166
You presumed to research it...?!

68
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,708
What a despicably
untrustworthy thing to do!

69
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,916
Hold on...!
That's way out of line!

70
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,916
You can't let a mystery
like that hang in the air

71
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,958
and expect a guy not
to be interested!

72
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:59,166
Don't you dare hit
Clain ever again!

73
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,791
Don't... Nessa...

74
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,375
People who hit Clain are mean!

75
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:06,416
Nessa doesn't like mean people
and Nessa likes liking people!

76
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,583
Sorry, it's the legs.

77
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,916
They kinda got a mind
of their own, you know?

78
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,416
You don't say!

79
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,000
Yeah, so I'm gonna have to
break this little party up...

80
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,791
The priestess and I need
a moment to ourselves...

81
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,583
If you'll excuse us,
I'll escort her

82
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,208
somewhere a
bit more private.

83
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,416
I don't need to be escorted.

84
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:33,833
You all right?

85
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:36,583
Nessa doesn't dislike
very many things...

86
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,541
But she definitely dislikes her.

87
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:45,625
Daughter of the Archpriestess--
excuse me: Key to the World...

88
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,791
Why'd you run away
from the Temple?

89
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:51,333
Oh yeah... and that
flighty little dopple

90
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:55,625
you decided to take with you
as a parting gift... Is she...?

91
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,875
It's not important...
Only a matter of time

92
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:03,500
before the whole shebang
collapses anyway.

93
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,416
That's one way of
putting it, yes.

94
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,125
Oh...? So we share
that opinion...?

95
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,708
Well, you know,
with that attitude,

96
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:11,083
someone with your
knowledge of the Temple

97
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,833
would be a prized
addition to the family.

98
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,541
But we'd want you to take your
time with a leap that big...

99
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:18,708
And in the meantime...
you can watch the world

100
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,416
crash and burn from
the safety our our ship.

101
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,083
Sound good?

102
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:32,458
Don't weep. We all return
to ash in the end.

103
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,333
That's the way of things...

104
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:37,375
Remember the cause
our brother died for.

105
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,875
You should be glad for him.

106
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,583
'Kay... I'll be glad...
I won't cry.

107
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:53,375
Atta girl. Spoken
like a warrior.

108
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:59,333
They really have no perspective.
I mean, give me a break...

109
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:02,458
At the end of the day
he was a terrorist...

110
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,833
He got what was coming to him.

Another of Fractale's stars has
dislodged from the firmament,

131
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,500
as did its sister
the day before,

132
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:49,041
and their sisters
before that...

133
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,833
This world is crumbling
before our eyes;

134
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:54,333
fast approaching the brink.

135
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,625
For that reason,
the Lost Millienium

136
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,500
will no longer be tolerated...

137
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,666
We have forgiven them
their wayward antics

138
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,916
in days past out of pity;
that ends now.

139
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,166
By abducting one of the
world's Beloved Maidens,

140
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,916
they have effectively
surrendered their right

141
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,708
to our indulgence...
That they would take advantage

142
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:16,125
of Fractale's decadent
state is unpardonable.

143
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:23,208
There is but one answer for
such an offense... Suppression.

144
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,583
If these errant
children still refuse

145
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,708
to reenter the fold
in the here and now,

146
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:31,833
then they will embrace Fractale
in the sweet hereafter.

147
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:40,791
These goggles are too
big for me, Grandma!

148
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,333
Come here, love.

149
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,500
They've already got us on
their Most Wanted list.

150
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,875
Well, they can cast their
nets wide as they want.

151
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,125
We should still be pretty safe
here, as long as we're watching

152
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,833
the lower frequencies bouncing
off the radial outposts.

153
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:57,875
We come bearing gifts: food and
blankets for the lot of you.

154
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,125
Oho! Thank you!

155
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,416
Go on and wheel 'em in...

156
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,958
Is it true that the whole clan's
gonna clear out of town?

157
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:06,250
Yeah, it's better for everyone
if we leave before the Temple

158
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,500
tries to get its hooks
into you for helping us.

159
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,625
Right now, they're only
ticked off at the Granites,

160
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,416
and we'd like to
keep it that way.

161
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,708
The last thing any of us want
to do is draw their attention

162
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:17,458
to the good folks who've given
us a hand when we needed it.

163
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:23,125
It's inconcievable how
cruel the Temple can be...

164
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:26,083
Forcing an angel like Sanko
into life on the run.

165
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,791
Well I'm a whole lot stronger
than the temple thinks I am...!

166
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,750
I can even eat fish bones
sometimes like Grampa!

167
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,000
In theory, you all stand a much
better chance of survival

168
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,333
the further away the Granite
clan gets from here.

169
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,208
Well yeah, but what
about your own chances?

170
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,708
We'll be alright...
It's a helluva lot easier

171
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,708
running from ghosts than
flesh-and-blood human beings.

172
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,416
And what are they but
a bunch of ghosts...?

173
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,291
I mean, face it:
that's why the Temple idiots

174
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,791
want us in the first place--
they're jealous

175
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:50,208
of the lifeblood coursin'
through our veins!

176
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,416
Maybe, but...

177
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,500
Hey, you agree
with me, don'tcha?

178
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,541
That's right,
use those lungs...!

179
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:01,625
Take a page, everyone: the
future cries out to be fed!

180
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:05,541
Fed on a steady diet of fresh
air, adventure and true freedom!

181
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:06,791
Sunda...

182
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,750
We should all be wailing
like babes right now...

183
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:11,250
Let our voices be heard!

184
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,708
The Lost Millienium
is the future...

185
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,875
And the Granite clan is
proud to be a part of it.

186
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:25,583
Get a move on, we sail at dawn!
No time for dilly dallying!

187
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,750
Now what?

188
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,125
We get out of here while
we're on solid ground...

189
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,833
We've got a ways to go.

190
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:36,500
We're running away?

191
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,500
Yup. We're stuck between
a rock and a hard place

192
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,125
the longer we stay here...

193
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:43,083
The Temple's no good and we
can't trust these freaks...

194
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,666
But what am I going
to do about Phryne?

195
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:53,916
Stop it! Clain's thinking
about Phryne, isn't he?!

196
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,416
Well, I...

197
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,958
Get that mean person out of
your head right this instant!

198
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,375
Think only about
Nessa from now on!

199
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,125
Nessa! Nessa! Nessa!

200
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,375
--Nessa! Nessa! Nessa!
--Okay, okay! Cut it out!

201
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,000
Nessa! Nessa!

202
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,875
All woman and children
take cover in the rocks!

203
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,166
Everyone else to
defensive positions!

204
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,583
Bear in mind, people,
our first priority

205
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:44,041
is to steer the Beloved Maiden
clear of the enemy.

206
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,666
Innocent bystanders should be
spared whenever possible,

207
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,708
but don't let them cloud
your judgement...

208
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:51,041
If these Granites
get in your way...

209
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,708
You have my permission to fire.

210
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:56,875
However, we do not intend
this to be a massacre.

211
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,666
I want these poor
souls to see us

212
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,791
as avatars of
Fractale's blessing...

213
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,666
Hey-hey! Didn't take
you long to find us, huh?

214
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,958
Oh we've been aware
of this place...

215
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,000
In her munificence though,
the Archpriestess

216
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,583
turned a blind eye to you...

217
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:13,333
Would that your sense of
gratitude were equal to it.

218
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,458
Yeah. Damn shame, that.

219
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,916
Now...! Show no mercy!

220
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,625
Come... on...!

221
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,875
Nicely done, Enri.

222
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:37,208
Now go do the east side before
the bastards circle around back!

223
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:43,208
Granny, what are you doing?
We've got to hurry!

224
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:45,750
Where'd Nessa run off to?
I can't see her...

225
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,791
She's just a dopple, she's fine.

226
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,666
Okay. This isn't good.

227
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,291
Wow. Look at all the
pretty flashing lights, Clain!

228
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,375
Nessa, c'mon!

229
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,750
Phryne! That must be where
they were keeping her...

230
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,833
She's gonna get herself killed.

231
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:07,333
Don't even think
about rescuing her!

232
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:08,500
What?

233
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,875
Nessa forbids you
from resucing Phryne!

234
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,333
Nessa, c'mon! This is
no time to be jealous...

235
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:16,125
She's gonna get hurt if
we don't help her out.

236
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,125
So?

237
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,208
Look, I'm going to her.

238
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:29,833
You're not just gonna
stand there...? Seriously?

239
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,000
Suit yourself.

240
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,125
Phryne!

241
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,333
Where is she?

242
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:46,500
W-Well, uh... 

243
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:49,333
You don't have to cover for her.
I know she hates me.

244
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:52,916
What? No... I mean...

245
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,166
It might surprise you to know
she was very fond of you

246
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,375
long before you had
the chance to meet.

247
00:16:58,458 --> 00:16:59,583
I thought no one would be able

248
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,583
to access that data
without guidance...

249
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:04,750
Least of all someone like you...
How could you?

250
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,041
Where are you going?!

251
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,875
I can't let myself be
captured by the temple!

252
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:12,375
I'm sorry, but I don't
think you and I

253
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:15,000
are very likely to
see each other again.

254
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,416
Whether you like it or not...

255
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,625
I have a right to
know what's going on!

256
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,125
You totally left me in the dark!

257
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,583
I'm sorry but there's
no way I'll let you

258
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:36,291
try and pull that crap
on me a second time!

259
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,708
If I left you in the dark
it was for a good reason,

260
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,375
can't you see that?!

261
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:44,583
Is it so wrong of me

262
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,541
to wanna get to know
you a little better?!

263
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,666
That's why I hacked the
amulet in the first place...

264
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,208
I just wanted to see if--

265
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,583
Oh, thank the stars;
our Beloved Maiden is all right.

266
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,583
I was getting a little worried.

267
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,333
They've got us.

268
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:04,791
Clain! Do you...?

269
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,166
What did you say...?
I couldn't hear you!

270
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,625
I was asking if I happened
to be somone you like...

271
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,916
Nessa said she likes
liking people, right...?

272
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,750
Well, I'm sorry... I don't
feel the same way she does.

273
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,791
L... Look out!!!

274
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,416
There you are,
you naughty little girl.

275
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:38,041
Innocent blood was about to
be spilt because of you...

276
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:41,458
Are you so selfish that
another's life holds no value?

277
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:46,083
No, of course we know
you're better than that.

278
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,708
Don't we... Darling girl?

279
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,541
Who the heck is this creep?

280
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,500
It's a shame the same
thing can't be said

281
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:55,375
of your would-be abettor...
Whatever he's convinced you

282
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,666
his motives are,
Phryne, he only wants

283
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:01,041
what every hormone-riddled
boy his age wants.

284
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,833
Now, you've only
three choices...

285
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:06,583
And sadly, the world has
just so much time to spare

286
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:09,166
waiting for you to
reach a decision...

287
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,333
The first option...?
You behave

288
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:15,708
as one of the World's Beloved
Maidens are meant to behave...

289
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:17,125
What is he talking about?

290
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:20,708
Which means you return to
the temple without a fuss.

291
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:23,833
Two... You could do
so flailing about like a bird...

292
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:26,125
Or three, you could stay out
here in the wilderness

293
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:29,375
and waste away to nothing.
Which will it be?

294
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:36,583
Disconsolate child!
There is no fourth option!

295
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:39,625
Phryne, wait...!
What are you gonna do?!

296
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:48,416
Whoa...
Maybe she really can fly.

297
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,041
How much must those
who love you endure

298
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,875
before you'll see reason?!

299
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,291
Damn it all! If you
let them get away,

300
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:10,208
every one of you can bid your
careers a bitter farewell!

301
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,125
Fly to the corners of
the earth, if you like!

302
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,666
Your foulness leaves a
trail wherever you go!

303
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:24,208
I will sniff out your inequities
and track you like common game!

304
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,666
Well, well... Come
crawling back, did we...?

305
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,250
I feel for you, kiddo...

306
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,916
Your options out there must've
been pretty bleak to choose us.

307
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I don't want to hear it!

308
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,916
Nessa...? Are you here?

309
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,291
Did Nessa come with you?

310
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,041
A dopple can go
wherever it pleases;

311
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,625
for all we know she's
dancing on the hull...

312
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,000
Or waiting in ambush
for me in the bathroom.

313
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,625
Nessa, I'm sorry I left you
by yourself out there.

314
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:03,500
Please don't be mad.
It won't happen again.

315
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,416
Great. She's sulking...

316
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,916
She doesn't want to
come out and play?

317
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,666
Well, give it time. I'm sure
she'll turn up before too long.

318
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,625
As long as I'm here...

319
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,333
Don't bet on it.

320
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:23,625
Clain...

321
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,500
You big doof...

322
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:42,083
<i>Down by the salley gardens</i>
<i>my love and I did meet</i>

323
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:55,958
<i>She passed the salley gardens</i>
<i>with little snow-white feet</i>

324
00:21:56,041 --> 00:22:10,000
<i>She bid me take love easy,</i>
<i>as the leaves grow on the tree</i>

325
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:23,958
<i>But I, being young and foolish,</i>
<i>with her did not agree</i>

326
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:47,916
<i>But I was young and foolish,</i>
<i>and now I am full of tears</i>

327
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,916
<i>But I was young and foolish,</i>
<i>and now I am full of tears</i>
