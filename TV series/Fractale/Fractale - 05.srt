1
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,833
Good news, we're
about to converge

2
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:48,000
on a huge blind spot in
the system's coverage.

3
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:49,750
Good. So we've made
a clean break of it?

4
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,083
We're out of the
woods for now,

5
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:53,166
but don't start popping
corks just yet.

6
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,791
Just a matter of time
till another hot zone.

7
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:59,041
One day at a time, Gramps...
Proceed as you will.

8
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,208
Looks like we're back to
square one, doesn't it?

9
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,666
I hope at least after all that,
you can appreciate

10
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,958
that our goals aren't
mutually exclusive.

11
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:13,416
So, uh, where's the
ship headed to...?

12
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,750
Any place marked out
or are we flying blind?

13
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:19,750
Hah! File that question under
"none of your business."

14
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:21,291
You should know you're
in great peril here

15
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:22,916
since you don't
serve a purpose...

16
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,875
You're more like a
growth than a passenger.

17
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:27,083
Is that a threat?

18
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,708
So where'd that sprightly
little dopple run off to, huh?

19
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:32,208
Without putting on a visor,
I can't see or hear her.

20
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:33,500
What makes you
think I would know?

21
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:35,875
C'mon. The two of you
are attached at the hip.

22
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:39,625
Look, it's complicated...
Sort of...

23
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:42,208
No matter... Just keep
the leash nice n' tight

24
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:44,333
so she doesn't get
herself into trouble.

25
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:46,000
Lucky for you, if you can
endure being treated

26
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,458
like a fifth wheel for a bit,
we'll cut you loose.

27
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:50,958
Eventually, that is.
It may be a while

28
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:53,250
before we can plan a side
trip to drop you off,

29
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:56,166
so best steel yourself
to being here... Unless...

30
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,833
 Wait, I--

31
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:00,625
This is...

32
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,708
Your very own parachute...

33
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:05,541
Not a lot of people get to
experience freefall these days.

34
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,041
May seem a bit daunting
on the face of it,

35
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,208
but the most you'll
do is break a leg...

36
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:11,500
You want me to show
you how to use it?

37
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,333
If you don't have the
balls for that, kiddo,

38
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,583
I suggest you make
yourself useful.

39
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,166
Seriously...? Who cleans
by hand anymore?

40
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:26,375
It's barbaric...
No, that's not it...

41
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:29,291
I can think of a better word.

42
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,500
The seat back has not
been sufficiently cleaned.

43
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,541
You've got to be kidding!

44
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:37,916
Ugh! I just told you those
go up on the shelf, bozo!

45
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,958
I heard you... I just need
a second to rest, okay?

46
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,375
Oh, hey, don't worry:
you can rest all you want

47
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,750
after I throw your lazy butt
off the prow of the ship!

48
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,458
For your information,
I didn't sign up

49
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:52,083
to be a cabin boy for
a bunch of terrorists.

50
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,333
You know for someone who treats
women like slabs of beef,

51
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:57,000
you sure do take the moral
high ground an awful lot...

52
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:59,291
The Lost Millennium is
not about terrorism.

53
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,250
Oh, please.
Spare me the lecture.

54
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:04,041
Well, go on! No one is forcing
you to stay on board...

55
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,875
'Course we know you're
too afraid to jump.

56
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,250
You think I'm too scared
to use a stupid parachute?

57
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,625
You're miserable and still
on the ship, aren't you?

58
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,125
Maybe I have other reasons.

59
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:14,958
What's that supposed to mean?

60
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:18,375
Wait... Don't tell me you're
thinking all pervy again.

61
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,125
Give me a break already...

62
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:26,333
I wasn't thinking anything
pervy... It's not like that.

63
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,500
Easy does it, son.

64
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,458
Your first time doing
laundry, I take it?

65
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,708
Ah, me, how I envy all
the new experiences

66
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,041
in store for someone your age.

67
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,166
Very satisfying, isn't it?

68
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,875
You sweat all over the
clothes you work in,

69
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,458
then clean 'em again,
hang 'em out to dry,

70
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,541
only to repeat the
whole mess over.

71
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,291
Circle of life, eh?

72
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,166
In fact...
From the looks of 'em,

73
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,458
I'd say your pants could
use a good scouring.

74
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:22,375
You... think?

75
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,291
Take 'em off and hand 'em over.

76
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,833
Wait... This second?

77
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,041
Uh-huuuh.

78
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,166
But don't we need to
get this laundry done?

79
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,083
Now, now...

80
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,041
There's no need for you
to feel embarrassed.

81
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:39,000
Please, I'm begging you;
don't... do...

82
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,500
Oh!

83
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,375
What on earth is that?

84
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:52,250
I... saw this in an old book
and thought it looked cool.

85
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,791
Well, I don't know
about "cool," but...

86
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,916
You are a man.

87
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,333
First the square one,
then the long one...

88
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:07,291
then we find a little one...

89
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,833
Oh, good job...!
Now make that one next!

90
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,833
Hold on; I'll go
get us some more.

91
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,875
Who are you talking to?

92
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,375
 I'm playing with Nessa.

93
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,791
Aw, she's gone...

94
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,625
Nessa...! Will you just
come out already...?

95
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:28,291
I know you're here somewhere...

96
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,375
Why could Sanko see
her and I couldn't?

97
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:33,458
Does she hate me now? Fantastic.

98
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:36,458
C'mon! Don't be like this!

99
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,791
Fortunately, the Obsidian
boys down south

100
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,166
are willing to take us all in,

101
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,291
if we try to keep a low
profile for the time being.

102
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,041
Do you guys always eat together?

103
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,125
Heh. Sure.
Food's always better

104
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:48,708
when you have some good
conversation with it...

105
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,458
Try to do this whenever we can.

106
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,500
How do you not get
sick of each other?

107
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,791
They keepin' you busy, tiger?

108
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,625
Feels good. Right?

109
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,083
Life returning to those
rarely-used limbs?

110
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,708
Just reminds me how much
I prefer not to be busy.

111
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,875
Naturally... You can
lead a horse to water

112
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,333
but you can't make him think.

113
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,541
A boy raised as this one's
been is never going to learn

114
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,458
the value of a hard day's work.

115
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,083
I don't want to teach
him anything, Gramps,

116
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,416
I just want the kid to earn
his keep while he's with us.

117
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,500
Give me some credit. I'm not
that much of a romantic.

118
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,375
So you've told us for years.

119
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,666
Not yet, son.
We must say grace.

120
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,500
You say grace...?
To the Temple?

121
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:26,708
That's a good one,
kid, but no way.

122
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,541
Granny's talking about
something nobler

123
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,791
than a Temple prayer;
though if I had my druthers,

124
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,791
there'd be no prayer
of any kind on this ship.

125
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,041
Sunda...

126
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,791
Look, I'm not trying to
start another argument.

127
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,625
I'm just saying this
constant need for prayer

128
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:40,291
is what got the human race
into such a bind to begin with.

129
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,750
Institutions like the
Temple have been

130
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,916
taking advantage
of it from day one.

131
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,166
Phryne isn't here.

132
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,666
I told her to come.

133
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,500
Don't expect too
much of a priestess.

134
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:50,875
You gotta remember,
kid, she's had

135
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,500
a lifetime's worth of training
just to prevent her

136
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,666
from becoming a
heathen like us.

137
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:03,083
If you're here, please come out.

138
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,541
Think only about
Nessa from now on!

139
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,833
Believe me, I'm trying to.

140
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:15,250
Why is this getting me
so bent out of shape?

141
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,416
Hi there...

142
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,333
Sorry! I really wasn't trying
to spy on you or anything...!

143
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,500
I was told these clothes
were for anyone...

144
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,875
So I came to pick something out.

145
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,458
You had a chance to
meet the busybodies

146
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,083
that do all the washing up here?

147
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:46,041
Mm mm. Do I look strange?

148
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:55,625
Uh... No, you...

149
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,250
look great.

150
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,333
I thought as much.

151
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,583
I haven't seen her for a while.

152
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:32,958
Typical.

153
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,125
You mean she does this kind
of thing all the time?

154
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,708
Well, only when she's jealous.

155
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,083
Wait, what?

156
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,458
Like it or not, she's become
very attached to you.

157
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,833
Well, attached to the idea of
messing with my head, maybe.

158
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,750
I don't know about "jealous."

159
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,791
I mean, surely she's not...

160
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,541
You really think that?

161
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:57,916
You're rather fond of those
boxers... Aren't you?

162
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:08,583
You know, I... At first I
guess I just kind of assumed

163
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:11,625
that Nessa was
your dopple... But...

164
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:16,208
I hate to ask...
But did you take

165
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,958
the amulet she was in
without, like, permission...?

166
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,416
'Cause that would explain
why everyone's after you...

167
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,958
I mean, not that any of
this is my business!

168
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,958
But if you wanted to
talk about this stuff...

169
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,375
Like, for example,
why that creep

170
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,333
called you a Beloved Maiden...

171
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,291
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
pry so much...

172
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,583
It's just, all these things
are in my head now...

173
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:40,583
Just answer me one thing, okay?

174
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:44,625
Do you... dislike Nessa
as much as it seems?

175
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:50,083
If I do, it's a function
of how I'm meant to act.

176
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,958
What does that even mean?!

177
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,333
Fine. Leave me in
the dark, why don't you...

178
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,083
Does it not seem to be
getting rather hot?

179
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:05,708
You're just now noticing?
It's been hot.

180
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,625
The hell's going on? The place's
heating up like a stove!

181
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,750
It's a systems malfunction...
Trying to pin it down!

182
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:17,250
You mean you don't know which
system's on the blink...?

183
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,208
Tell me you can
fix this, Gramps.

184
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,583
I'm workin' on it...

185
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,375
Keep your shirt on;
it's no big deal...

186
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,750
At least it'll keep
us on our toes!

187
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:28,333
What's with this heat?
Someone forget to clean a vent?

188
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:32,083
Looks like we're keepin' cool
the old-fashioned way.

189
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,250
I don't like this. The two
of you hanging together

190
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:37,750
can't be a promising sign...
Is he up to his old tricks?!

191
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,875
Man, you really don't
have an off switch!

192
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:43,750
Well! No wonder the ship is
starting to feel like an oven!

193
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,625
Don't turn this into a joke;
you'll only encourage him!

194
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:49,583
Sorry everybody--
These clothes are comin' off.

195
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:52,625
Nobody wants to see that
coat rack you call a body.

196
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,875
 Hey, whoa!

197
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,458
Something wrong?

198
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:02,875
What's going on with the heat?

199
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,750
Hey! Mind your
own business, kid.

200
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:07,125
Come on...! Maybe there's
some way I can help.

201
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,375
Get the hell out of here!

202
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:11,000
We don't have time to
babysit you too, kid!

203
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,375
Check-up commencing...

204
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:21,750
Please sit at the proper angle
with your genitals exposed.

205
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,583
Mind your own business.

206
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,958
That's an impressive
patchwork...

207
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,041
It's amazing what you can
do with balloon shrapnel.

208
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:35,291
I may have a newfound respect
for this crew... This might be

209
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:38,250
the best piece of stitched-
together technology I've seen.

210
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:41,250
I hate to admit it,
but this thing might be

211
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,750
a little out of my league.

212
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,125
It's got to be a glitch in
the pre-Fractale components...

213
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,250
Don't you think?

214
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,833
Hmm...

215
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,541
I don't believe it!
How many old OS-es

216
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:52,916
did they hash together
to build this thing?

217
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I mean, some of this stuff

218
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,250
predates Fractale
by generations...

219
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,208
Even if I can hack it,
finding the issue's

220
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,041
going to be a whole other thing.

221
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:02,208
Funny this is what we're
reduced to, huh...?

222
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,916
User manuals; might as
well study warrantees.

223
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,416
Still, ancient texts do get
the blood up don't they?

224
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,125
Sure.

225
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,791
Not even a 26th century
patch works?

226
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,083
Alright, then...

227
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,583
What the heck?!

228
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:20,166
Hm? The hell is that beeping
noise? And why's it roving?

229
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,375
Hey, listen!

230
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,250
Get off this channel, ya brat!

231
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,750
Hang on; let him talk.

232
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,041
You're hearing
that noise, right?

233
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,000
I think it's got to be Nessa...

234
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,208
Nessa?

235
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,916
I may just be shooting
in the dark here...

236
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,416
but I saw a similar sine-wave
when I first let her out.

237
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,916
That doesn't fly, kid.

238
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,708
The blip showed up when we
probed one of the older OS-es.

239
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,708
No way a dopple
would be compatible

240
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,875
with a system dating
that far back.

241
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:44,208
Yeah, I know...
Sounds crazy, but still...

242
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,916
So then what you're
telling me is that Nessa's

243
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,291
wreaking havoc on
our ship, is that right?

244
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:49,625
Probably.

245
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:52,541
Just what we need.
A rogue program pitching a fit.

246
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,416
What's going on?!

247
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,875
For some reason the
auto-pilot's decided

248
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:59,958
to go for a coffee break...
Or it likes storms.

249
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,375
Steer the hell around it!

250
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:05,708
I'm trying! The controls aren't
responding worth a damn!

251
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,708
Kid, you've got to
call Nessa out!

252
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:10,250
I would, but... She's kind
of upset with me right now...

253
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,875
Oh, great. She's upset...

254
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:13,333
What did you do to her now?

255
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:14,666
Nothing...

256
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:18,000
Heh. That's what seeing
two girls at once gets ya.

257
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,416
Look, kid whatever she's
mad at you for, trust me;

258
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,625
find a way to make her feel
real special real quick

259
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,416
or this clunker's toast.

260
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:28,166
You could fry an egg
on my forehead...

261
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,083
Somebody please open a window.

262
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,458
Yeah, and put out a lightning
rod while we're at it?

263
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,416
Look at the bright side;
this is an excellent way

264
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,500
to shed those unwanted
extra pounds.

265
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,708
If this is an endurance
test from the higher ups,

266
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:42,166
then I am jumping ship.

267
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,833
Don't worry, people!

268
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,916
We know what the problem is...
The trick is finding Nessa

269
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,791
and persuading her to come
out of her hiding place

270
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,833
before things get
worse than they are.

271
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:54,833
Are you insane...? What's
Nessa got to do with this?

272
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,458
Let's just say the
longer she hides out,

273
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,541
the more the rest of us
are gonna feel the heat.

274
00:14:58,625 --> 00:14:59,958
Good enough for me.

275
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,833
If it'll cool things off,
I'm up for a little hunt.

276
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,750
How do we find a dopple that
doesn't intend to be found?

277
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,833
I'll track her at a console
and fill everybody in...

278
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:08,291
But if I know Nessa at all,

279
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,333
the best way to coax her out
of wherever she is will be

280
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,833
to make her think we're all
having a lot more fun out here.

281
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:15,416
Perfect! My boy, I can whip up
something in the kitchen

282
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,000
to lure the stubbornest child!

283
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,666
That'd be great if she
could actually eat food...

284
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,500
Wait a minute. Once, she had me
explain the taste of something

285
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,375
by doing this crazy
dance for her!

286
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,250
I believe we can manage
something like that.

287
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,916
Uh... For your
lentil soup,

288
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,666
perhaps a little
something like this?

289
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,333
Surely it's got a much
livelier flavor than that...!

290
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,416
Look at me!

291
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,083
Take a lesson from
the Master, ladies!

292
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:46,166
Yeah, of course...
Why wouldn't this work...?

293
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,541
What a way to go...

294
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:06,875
Taking advantage of the havoc

295
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,041
your little friend
caused, ya pervert?

296
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,583
Oooo! Nessa's never
seen this game before!

297
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:15,166
What a good way to
keep nice and warm!

298
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,541
Yeah. It'd be
great if it didn't

299
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,666
already feel like
a stove in here...

300
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,708
Hey! There she is!

301
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:23,875
Sorry, sorry...

302
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:24,875
You stepped on my hand!

303
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:26,541
Be careful!

304
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,708
She's in storage now! Wait...

305
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,541
She's moved to the kitchen!

306
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,166
She's moving down shaft C-3...

307
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,791
Nessa! Come out come out
wherever you are...

308
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,416
Please?

309
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:59,541
My darling little girl...
You can run but you can't hide.

310
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,541
There she is!

311
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:11,791
Together, just as I thought...
but Nessa is our first priority.

312
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,166
Oh no, she's gone...
How long is she going

313
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,250
to keep us all hunting
for her like this...?

314
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:20,666
It's been hours.

315
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,708
Please, sweetheart!
This is foolishness!

316
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,541
I'll have you know you're
still our prisoner!

317
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:28,458
You've got no right to lock
us out of our own hold!

318
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,500
Prisoner...?

319
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:31,500
Phryne!

320
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,083
Open the stupid door!

321
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,583
It's for your own good...

322
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,333
I know you can hear
me in there, girl!

323
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,000
Phryne!

324
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:43,208
It's no use! The systems
have all the hatches

325
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,875
on automatic lockdown...

326
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,375
What are you even
doing in there?!

327
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,041
It's all my fault.
Nessa won't come out

328
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,166
because of me... I know it.

329
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,750
No you don't!

330
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,208
C'mon, it's Nessa!
For all we know,

331
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:57,375
something shiny
caught her attention...

332
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:58,666
She probably doesn't
even remember

333
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,458
why she's hiding
in the first place.

334
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:04,500
She's just having fun with us;
that's all this is, believe me.

335
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,125
This is why I didn't want you to
bring her out of the amulet.

336
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,708
Phryne, please...

337
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:12,125
Seeing her is too painful.
I didn't wish to endure it!

338
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,833
What are you talking about?

339
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,166
As far as the
Temple's concerned,

340
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,666
Nessa is infinitely more
important than I am...

341
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,958
I just... I wanted to take
her away from them

342
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,333
so we could put an end
to this whole thing!

343
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:25,333
Put and end to what...?
I don't understand you!

344
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,666
For us, putting a stop to
this endless repetition

345
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,083
is the only way that we...

346
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:30,958
No! Whatever you're
talking about,

347
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:33,625
there's got to be a better way!
If you just turn your back

348
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:37,125
on whatever it is,
things can't get better.

349
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:38,833
Think about it;
Nessa would never let you

350
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,916
talk this way if she
could hear you...

351
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,250
She's having too much
fun to end it all...

352
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:46,583
We could all learn
a lesson from that.

353
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:49,666
I mean, hey... That childlike
enthusiasm is kind of infectious

354
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,958
if you just let it work
its magic on you...

355
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:54,208
Take me for example:
I'd have never thought

356
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:55,708
this whole mess was
anything but a drag

357
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:58,333
if I hadn't stopped to see
it through her eyes...

358
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,208
But now I'm actually
having fun...

359
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,208
Nessa's an unfettered
soul. If we'd all just

360
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,291
take a page from her book,
we'd be the same way.

361
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:06,208
How dare you?

362
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:09,333
You don't have the first clue
what you're talking about...

363
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,458
Don't presume to tell me what it
feels like to be "unfettered"!

364
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,083
Then tell me what I'm
supposed to say!

365
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:17,458
Explain the situation!
I just want to help you!

366
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:20,666
No... I won't let you!

367
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:24,500
Wait! Phryne! Don't do
this! I'm begging you!

368
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,291
Phryne! Phryne!

369
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,666
Phryne?

370
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,375
Are you looking for
a good hiding place?

371
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,875
Nessa...

372
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,000
Oh, no. Don't be sad...

373
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:59,333
Nessa doesn't like
to see you cry.

374
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:05,083
Nessa doesn't understand
why people cry.

375
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:08,208
It's fine...
I'm just hiding like you.

376
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,375
You like to hide?!

377
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,208
I like to be found.

378
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,916
You've been found...?
Who found you?

379
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,625
You did... Which means
Nessa did good.

380
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:22,208
Really? So you
want Nessa to find you?

381
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:25,000
It's okay if Nessa plays
hide-and-seek with you?

382
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,625
I don't see why not
if you'd like to.

383
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:32,666
Okay, then... Nessa's
found Phryne and she's it!

384
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,416
You have to do better than that.

385
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,708
The rules to this game
are a little different.

386
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:39,041
You have to take me by the hand.

387
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:47,208
Like this...?
Nessa captured Phryne!

388
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,708
When Phryne found Nessa--
no, wait: rather,

389
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,083
when Nessa found Phryne,
all the system glitches

390
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,666
disappeared in
the blink of an eye

391
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,666
and the ship returned to
what, for it, was normal.

392
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,416
Better still, Nessa settled in
to life among the Granites

393
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,541
like nothing could
be more natural.

394
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:04,041
She wasn't the only one who
settled in, though.

395
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:07,000
Phryne started joining the
rest of us for mealtime;

396
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,875
even started smiling
every now and then.

397
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,666
They no longer yell me
off the flight deck

398
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,666
when I come in to gawk at the
old-fashioned gauges and stuff.

399
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,916
Oh... And I still
wear a fundoshi.

400
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:23,291
No! Stop it!
Please! Waaahhh!

401
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,333
But they made me a red one.
