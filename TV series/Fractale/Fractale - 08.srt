1
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,208
So you're telling me Phryne
and Clain were both captured?

2
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:23,583
Yeah, well... Clain
just had to be Clain.

3
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,625
Was he hurt bad?

4
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:31,458
I can't be sure... But he
did take a couple of slugs.

5
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:35,666
No kidding...? Well...
Don't be too upset...

6
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,083
Little pervs have a way of
bouncing back, I'm told.

7
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:41,625
Hope whoever told
you that was right.

8
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:42,750
What about Nessa?

9
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:45,375
We managed to bring
her back at least.

10
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:48,000
Seeing Clain get shot kind
of sent her over the edge...

11
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:50,791
She's holed-up somewhere in
the Danan's nerve center.

12
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:53,041
We don't know where.

13
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:55,125
Let's just be glad
we got her on board.

14
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:58,166
Now the only question is where
the Temple took the other two.

15
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,791
--We know.
--You know?

16
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:02,166
Granny outfitted us all
with GPS transmitters

17
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,625
when we went out to look
for Clain and Nessa...

18
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:06,416
After their ship
went down, she wanted

19
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,333
to make sure we
didn't get lost...

20
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:09,583
The transmitters
feed back into

21
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:12,583
the onboard navigational
system we use.

22
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:14,750
And Phryne got fitted
with one, too?

23
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:43,625
At least let me
stay by his side!

24
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:45,208
Don't be unreasonable.

25
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:49,000
Calm yourself, my dear,
and come along with daddy.

26
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:52,458
Get your hands off me! Clain!

27
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:54,125
Daddy...?

28
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:29,333
Ah...! What a joy
it is to have you

29
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:32,958
restored to us...
My child, step closer.

30
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:44,250
Ah. Your sweet scent...
My daughter...

31
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,125
It is such bliss to
welcome you back home.

32
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:49,750
If memory serves, you said
I smelled of iniquity.

33
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,875
Yes, but of course; all women
smell of iniquity...

34
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:56,958
And the aura of their
filth is intoxicating...

35
00:03:57,041 --> 00:04:00,416
Aren't you expected to take me
to the Temple right away?

36
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,541
Yes, the inner sanctum affords
me so little free time...

37
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,416
Yet who can fault me
for wanting to spend

38
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,708
a moment alone with my darling?

39
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:09,958
What about Clain?

40
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,958
Worry not, my dear...
The boy's been moved

41
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,458
to the treatment room...
We don't wish to see

42
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:17,208
your special friend
suffer more, I promise.

43
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,416
Just how special a friend is he?

44
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:25,416
Have the pair of you
already been intimate?

45
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,791
You are still
qualified to fulfill

46
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,708
your role as "key," I hope...

47
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,000
What...?

48
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:34,458
We must be sure, you realize...

49
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,041
I daren't bring you before
the Archpriestess...

50
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:40,916
Not before I'm satisfied
on that score.

51
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,833
If you comport yourself
obediently and do as I ask,

52
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:47,041
I promise you the boy's wounds
will be seen to in all haste.

53
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:50,333
You lied to me! You said he
was undergoing treatment!

54
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:53,291
I said only that he was moved
to the treatment room...

55
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,916
Whether or not he will
be treated is up to you.

56
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,958
You... vile...!

57
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,625
Come. Consent
to having daddy

58
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,583
confirm the status of
your virtue, and...

59
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,166
He'll live.

60
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:04,791
Why do you do this...?

61
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:08,000
How long must you
go on tormenting me?

62
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,083
No...! Nessa's going!

63
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,500
Nessa going with you
to look for Clain!!

64
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,291
Give me one good reason!

65
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,875
We know where they've
taken them! It'll be a cinch!

66
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,125
Think it through...

67
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,250
We've got Nessa to worry
about now, right...?

68
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,666
Our first priority
is protecting her.

69
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,958
Spoken like a total 'fraidy cat!
What happened to your balls?!

70
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:29,000
They're still intact. As is my
ability to think straight...

71
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,708
What if we did make a move?
Just how much damage

72
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:34,875
you imagine this ragtag group
we call a crew could sustain?

73
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,666
We can't afford to
go into this blind.

74
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,125
Try to calm down, sweetheart.
It's too dangerous for you.

75
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:43,208
--Let us do the dirty work...
--Nessa's going!

76
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,708
What do you mean
she disappeared?!

77
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,708
I thought you were supposed
to be keeping an eye on her!

78
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:50,166
That's enough...

79
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,625
You can quit with the tone;

80
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:53,500
you know as well as we do if
she wants to do something

81
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,916
there's nothing we
can do to stop her.

82
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,375
Don't tell me she went
for Clain by herself...

83
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,166
Nessa!

84
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,958
Try not to move.

85
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:17,333
Huh... You know,
I don't feel all that bad.

86
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:18,708
It may seem that way now,

87
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:21,375
but you really shouldn't
move for six hours.

88
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:25,083
Only six? You've got
to be kidding me...!

89
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:28,166
I thought I was on the brink of
death and I just need a nap?

90
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,791
You'll live.

91
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:35,500
Sure seems like it, huh?

92
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,541
So who're you?

93
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:42,541
I've seen you before, haven't I?

94
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:49,416
Is... Is Nessa your dopple
or something? I mean...

95
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,708
I don't understand
your question.

96
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,416
Ah...

97
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,666
I'm, uh, guessing
I don't really have

98
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,833
a clue about all of this...

99
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,041
Are you the one who fixed me?

100
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,333
Fixed you?

101
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:11,208
You know, took care
of me and stuff...

102
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,125
No I am not...
I'm merely charged

103
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,666
with making sure
you don't escape.

104
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,791
Ah... Well...

105
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,291
An attack?

106
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,208
We've pinpointed a location
that bears all the marks of

107
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:25,208
a Temple-run facility, but the
clock is ticking as we speak.

108
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,708
Look, I know. I don't like
consolidating forces any more

109
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:30,333
than you... But if we want to
start making serious headway,

110
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:33,083
the L.M. groups have got to
stop operating in isolation.

111
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,875
For the record, I don't
disagree. As a matter of fact,

112
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,375
our battalion's been
preparing for this,

113
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,958
but I still say it's
far to soon to act.

114
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,666
Sure. I mean why not
let the bastards

115
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,333
reboot the whole shebang
while we sit around

116
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,208
on our hands like
chumps, right...?

117
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,958
What does it matter...?

118
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:50,125
I say let the imbeciles attempt
a reboot... Whatever they think

119
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:53,041
they've got up their sleeve,
they're flying blind.

120
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:56,125
Fractale is doomed either way.
Why risk further losses

121
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:59,375
when "sitting on our hands"
will yield the same results?

122
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,458
Heh. Must be nice being
able to hide your cowardice

123
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:02,875
behind the mask of old age.

124
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,166
What was that?

125
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,333
Huh?

126
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,166
Well, regardless...
As things stand now

127
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,625
we simply don't have
enough information

128
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:11,208
to launch a successful
attack anyway.

129
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:19,041
Why are you standing up there?

130
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,708
Uh... Just stretching.

131
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,958
You were trying to escape...

132
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,083
I'm a terrible liar.

133
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,833
Why, though...? It is much
better for your body

134
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,041
if you try not to
exert yourself.

135
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,125
That'd be the
common-sense thing...

136
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,958
Guess I'm just too worried about
Phryne to wanna stay put.

137
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,083
Phryne?

138
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,291
Do you know her?!

139
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:41,125
I am her.

140
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,208
Well... you may have
the same name and all,

141
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,875
but you're not the
Phryne I mean...

142
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,541
No disrespect or anything,
but what's in a name?

143
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:50,083
My Phryne is special to me.

144
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:53,458
I believe the girl you're
talking about is my sister.

145
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:54,791
Your sister?

146
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:58,416
Well... Either that, or one
of the replacements.

147
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,250
The what? Let's get this
straight. There could never

148
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,708
be a "replacement"
for the Phryne I know.

149
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:07,875
Look, you can try to
stop me if you want,

150
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,666
but I'm gonna go
find my girlfriend!

151
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,708
Your girlfriend?

152
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,583
Uh, did I say that...?!

153
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,000
That's not exactly what I meant;

154
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,583
or that's not what
I meant at all...

155
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,291
See, we're close and stuff...

156
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,500
but we're not to
that point yet...

157
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:22,875
Uh... I should probably
shut up now...

158
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,750
Are we doing this
by ourselves, then?

159
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,875
There doesn't seem
to be an alternative...

160
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,833
Even though with the crap
for firepower we've got

161
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,958
it's going to be a
suicide mission...

162
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,875
Oh great...
What do you want?

163
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,750
Forget to pour salt
in my wounds?

164
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:40,166
It isn't like you to
be so forthcoming.

165
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,666
And how's that?

166
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,250
Let's just say trying to
rally the other factions

167
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,791
is out of character for you.
I was surprised by the gesture.

168
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,666
Hey, even a spineless
yokel like me

169
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,125
knows the value of cooperation.

170
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,500
Oh, nice try... But
I think we both know

171
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:56,708
you'd only stoop to it if
you had information...

172
00:09:56,791 --> 00:10:00,583
Information...
'bout the key, maybe?

173
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,208
What are you talking about...?
Don't tell me you buy into

174
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:06,041
the whole "key" fantasy like
the rest of those dinosaurs.

175
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:09,291
Maybe... I'm along
for the ride either way.

176
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,833
What?

177
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:15,250
Suicide missions are for chumps.
You need me... Count us in.

178
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:19,916
C'mon.

179
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,583
Nessa...

180
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:39,458
Are these, like...
your dopples?

181
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:44,666
No, they are not...
They are Phryne.

182
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,916
What? Wait, hold on. I...

183
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,750
I must be going crazy...

184
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,208
How can you touch her?!

185
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,291
There are a whole
host of Phrynes.

186
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,625
They can make as
many as they want.

187
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,875
Hey... She's not a dopple...!

188
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,333
Don't tell me
she's like a clone!

189
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,916
I told you.
Her name is Phryne.

190
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,750
What's the point in doing this?

191
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,375
We're the key.

192
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:26,500
The what?!

193
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,041
I don't really know
what it means...

194
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:32,208
It's just a word they use to
describe us every now and again.

195
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,666
You mean the temptress you
got all lovey-dovey with...?

196
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,500
She's the key to
the world, friend...

197
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:39,416
A priestess of the Temple
with a very harsh fate.

198
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,791
I'm guessing it's not too
far of stretch to assume

199
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,416
all those rumors about
the "key" to Fractale's fate

200
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,708
are about you, yes?

201
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,083
What on earth does
that even mean?

202
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,416
Do you see the Phryne
you are looking for?

203
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,000
I... Uh...

204
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,000
There are more of them.

205
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,500
Please tell me you're joking...

206
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:02,208
They're in a different room.

207
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:03,583
This isn't real.

208
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,083
I know where it is.

209
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:09,000
No... I don't think the Phryne
I'm looking for is here...

210
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,750
She's probably--

211
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:14,916
Sorry! You okay?

212
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,125
You're bleeding!

213
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,958
Oh, man... I didn't
mean to scuff you up.

214
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:24,541
Might be a good thing you have
this in the long run, though...

215
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,791
It'd help me pick
you out of a lineup.

216
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,666
Why would you?

217
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,666
--Well...
--You like me?

218
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,958
Sure thing... I mean,
I don't see why not...

219
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:40,500
Look, we better get back
'fore you get into trouble.

220
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,875
Take the passage opposite
the hall we used coming down.

221
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:46,166
Hardly anyone goes that way.

222
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:50,250
Find your Phryne...
Before it's too late.

223
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,666
Don't be frightened.

224
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,000
We're simply conducting
ourselves as we must...

225
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,125
Swallow your pride and sit.

226
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:02,041
You've nothing to worry about;
Daddy is overseeing this...

227
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,958
We don't have all day.

228
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,375
Clain!

229
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:32,750
Nessa!

230
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,000
Where's Clain?!

231
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,416
He's going to be fine...

232
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,125
Trust me. You shouldn't be here!

233
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:40,333
Go back to the ship
before they find you!

234
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,875
No...! Nessa belongs with Clain!

235
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,500
Nessa!

236
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,833
Clain...! Clain, come here!

237
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,250
Hold on a sec...!
If you want to see Clain,

238
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,208
come with me;
I know where he is.

239
00:13:57,291 --> 00:14:00,000
Then show Nessa
where he is! Now!

240
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,833
It's like hide-n'-seek.

241
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:21,375
We mustn't let anyone here find
us... We have to be sneaky...

242
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:23,916
If they get us, we won't
be able to see Clai--

243
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,708
It's Clain! Ohh! Yay!!

244
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:29,875
Got 'em!

245
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,416
Follow me!

246
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:36,083
I'm a little surprised
you'd know a back way...

247
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,583
Why wouldn't I?
I was brought up here.

248
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:43,000
I got you... So,
that guy I saw... he's...

249
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,375
Does it really matter?

250
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:48,916
Well, I mean, he called
himself "Daddy..."

251
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,208
He raised me as he was
told to... We're not related.

252
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,250
I'm supposed to be the...

253
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,291
Key?

254
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,750
Everywhere I go...
That word's come up...

255
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,541
Some people have used
it to describe Nessa...

256
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:05,250
Someone here used
it to describe you.

257
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,916
Will you tell me
what's going on...?!

258
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,541
Which of 'em's right...?
Or are they both wrong?

259
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,166
Why do you think I was
trying to run away

260
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,958
from all of this to begin with?

261
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,458
For as long as I can remember
they've called me that...

262
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:23,333
I couldn't stand the pressure.

263
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:27,583
I no longer knew where
"the key" ended and I began...

264
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:33,000
So I left... I sneaked out
and took Nessa with me.

265
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,541
And then...

266
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:39,875
And then... I crossed
paths with you.

267
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:54,041
So now what? Which way
are we supposed to go?

268
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,083
I think we might be lost.

269
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:10,291
No! I've led us the wrong way;
we need to double back...

270
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,833
Hold on a sec.

271
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:36,708
I know what these are...
The other Phryne told me...

272
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:39,041
Why are there so many of them?

273
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,500
They're me, you know.

274
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:05,208
Except these versions have all
been labeled superfluous...

275
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:09,583
They're still me, though...
From my childhood...

276
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:12,791
Each of them an incarnation
of my younger self...

277
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:17,583
No... Nessa...

278
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,875
Nessa... doesn't like it when...

279
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:23,125
Phryne cries...
She doesn't like it...

280
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,208
Nessa!

281
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:26,500
She's locked into
the grid now...

282
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:29,208
Only way she knows how to cope.

283
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:32,333
I'm so sorry, Phryne.
Of course you ran...

284
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,708
It can't be!

285
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:39,458
No, no, no! It's the girl
who tried to help me!

286
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,000
What are you doing?!

287
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,833
Stop it, Clain!
This is madness!

288
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,083
The only reason she's in here

289
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,750
is because she tried to
help me rescue you...!

290
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,458
I can't let this happen...!
Not to her...!

291
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:55,458
There's no point trying to
save her, even if you could...

292
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,750
Every last one of us...
is as replaceable

293
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,333
as a piece of hardware.

294
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:02,833
What about all the others...?

295
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:06,125
If you can't save all
of them, why save any?

296
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,041
You all think like that,
don't you?

297
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,125
Why are you buying into
the bullshit these people

298
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,541
tell you about yourselves...?!
Who the hell cares

299
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,916
how many "Phrynes" there
are in the world...?!

300
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,500
This isn't just a damn number;

301
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:19,083
she's someone who
tried to help me!

302
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,708
And who's to say the
Phrynes in this room

303
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,708
can't all be that for someone?!

304
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:25,875
They deserve the chance to carve
out a niche for themselves...!

305
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,541
Maybe they'll cross
paths with someone

306
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,625
who'll be better for it...

307
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:30,625
Clain, you...

308
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,625
Damn it, I'm going to save her!

309
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,583
Dear, oh dear, oh dear...

310
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:39,583
The rat runs about so soon
after we dress his wounds...

311
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,166
Sadly, this is the problem
with advanced medicine

312
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,583
such as ours...
Leave his side at once

313
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,583
and come back to where
you belong, my dear...

314
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:49,666
Before it's too late...
Your cavorting is at an end.

315
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,583
Get a move on! We have
to save the stupid perv

316
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,625
before the fighting breaks out!

317
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:01,416
So the rabble come to
rescue one of their own...

318
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,041
You must delight in seeing me
backed into a corner, my boy.

319
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,708
Don't touch her--

320
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,250
Clain!

321
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:13,041
Dias...! Wait till
I give you the order!

322
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,916
Oh, but I'm afraid we've lost
the element of surprise...

323
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,416
They're rallying their guards as
I speak... Our hand is forced.

324
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,958
What?!

325
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,541
What are you waiting for?!
Cut us loose!

326
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:35,416
Are you seeing this?! If we
launch now, they'll blow us--

327
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,958
Damn you!

328
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:44,208
Let her go... Or I'll...

329
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,416
--Clain!
--Clain!

330
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:55,958
What the hell...?!

331
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,625
Engage!

332
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,583
Barrot, sir,
we have to evacuate!

333
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,250
Now, Phryne!

334
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:13,625
Dias!

335
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,333
Perfect time to use our
new secret weapon,

336
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:19,083
don't you think? A little
field test wouldn't hurt.

337
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:21,833
Damn it...!
Our priority is rescue!

338
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,416
You happen to know
another way out of here?

339
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,958
I do.

340
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,250
This one's been blocked...

341
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,916
Wait a minute...

342
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,750
Fire!

343
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,166
It's a panic room!

344
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,208
I-I think she's telling us
we need to get in there...

345
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,250
Well, what are we waiting for?!

346
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,791
Come with us, please!

347
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,916
Clain, no!!
