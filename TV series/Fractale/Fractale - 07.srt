1
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:45,583
I remember...

2
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:47,166
I was messing around
taking snapshots

3
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,375
with my awesome
new/old camera...

4
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:52,000
The field of vision
on this bad boy's

5
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:55,375
so friggin' dark and
narrow... Cool!

6
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:58,291
Hey, Perv! What gives?

7
00:01:58,375 --> 00:01:59,958
Uh...

8
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,708
I swear to God...!

9
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,333
Hey, if you're just
loafing around...

10
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:18,291
The least you could do is let me
get a decent picture of you.

11
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:23,083
Or not...

12
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,291
Nessa isn't just loafing
around, you know...

13
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:29,583
She's intensely watching
everyone have fun.

14
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:32,375
C'mon... Clain's having
fun now, isn't he?

15
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,166
Sure am.

16
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,500
Then Nessa's having
just as much fun.

17
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,750
I took that smile at face value.

18
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,125
This was, of course,
before I had

19
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:43,125
any clue what was
really beneath it.

20
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:46,250
I had a few things still to
learn about Nessa...

21
00:02:55,541 --> 00:03:00,125
Morning...
Pleasant dreams I hope.

22
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:15,416
Oh, by the way,
welcome to Xanadu.

23
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,458
Impressed?

24
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,541
Yeah?

25
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:25,875
Who are you?!

26
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,250
Someone has a bad memory;
considering the night

27
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,625
the two of us just
spent together...

28
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,333
Please don't tell
me you and I--

29
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,958
Mind the edge there, champ.

30
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,125
Wow, you weren't kidding;
your memory really is shot

31
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,666
if you've fogotten the
mattress and the sheets

32
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,041
are the only two solid
objects in the room.

33
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,416
Everything else about
the decor is virtual,

34
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,166
right down to the carpet.

35
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,458
There's no way you
can be serious...

36
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,125
I mean, the processing
power it'd take

37
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,291
for this much detail--

38
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,750
Believe it.
We do things big in Xanadu.

39
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,541
This is the only
city in existence

40
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:59,708
where Fractale still
functions at full capacity.

41
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:04,083
Full capacity...
So this is--And you're...

42
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,208
Megan.

43
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,958
And you're a... Well, uh...

44
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:10,000
A dopple. Very observant.

45
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:12,916
Whoa!

46
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,291
That's the spirit...
Now please, relax.

47
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,375
We haven't so much as shared

48
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:19,166
a peck on the cheek,
Loincloth boy.

49
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:24,625
The name is Clain! And right
now I'm kind of confused...

50
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:27,750
I found you lying unconscious
on the edge of town.

51
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,333
Oh, wait. Of course!

52
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:32,750
Nessa doesn't get it...

53
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:35,250
Why can't we just use the water
that's right underneath us?

54
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,625
Because all this is salt water;

55
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,791
for drinking we need to find
a source of fresh water.

56
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,208
Seems like a big waste...

57
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,083
Nessa doesn't see
the difference.

58
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,541
Well, the good news
is lakes this size

59
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,333
usually have a river
feeding into them.

60
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,833
Find a river, and we've got
ourselves fresh water...

61
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,291
So keep your eyes
peeled... Sound fun?

62
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:53,125
Aye-aye, cap'n...!
As long as she's with Clain...

63
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:56,000
Nessa has fun doing
just about anything...!

64
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,625
Clain and Phryne are
the only two people

65
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,750
that make Nessa feel
super warm 'n fuzzy...

66
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:04,083
And Phryne gets all weird when
Nessa tries to snuggle with her.

67
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,375
Her loss, I guess.

68
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:07,208
Snuggleys!

69
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,416
Either you're allergic
to me or someone

70
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,208
back on the ship is telling
a good story about you.

71
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,666
You okay?

72
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,208
Nessa doesn't feel so good.

73
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:28,541
Nessa head's all jangly...
And she feels kind of dizzy...

74
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:34,166
 What the...?
We've lost control!

75
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,250
Oh, god... What is
with this thing?!

76
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,916
No sign of 'em this way, Boss.

77
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,416
Oh well... I guess not
finding them's a lot better

78
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,083
than finding bits
and pieces of them.

79
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:02,458
Mm, I suppose. But where
would they have gone?

80
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,041
--Unless...
--Boss.

81
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,791
Beautiful day, don't you agree?

82
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:22,750
You weren't lying, were you...?
This place is huge!

83
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,041
Yeah, it's quite the town...
First time I laid eyes on it,

84
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,666
it was all I could do to pick
my jaw up off the ground.

85
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,958
Best part is,
I never have to rely

86
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:34,500
on a shoddy, third-rate
dopple again.

87
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,000
Okay, I get that...

88
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:39,416
But explain to me exactly why
I have to dress like this?

89
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,750
Because, silly,
if you tool around

90
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,583
in a real body here,
you stick out...

91
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,875
Heh... When in Rome,
chickadee...

92
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:48,750
Fashionistas suffer to look as
exquisite as they do... Yeah?

93
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,583
Imagine those
refugees coming here.

94
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,666
They'd think they'd reached
the promised land.

95
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,958
Maybe Nessa just went
back to the Danan.

96
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,041
I mean, she was kind of under
the weather and all...

97
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,333
Oh, please. Tell me
you're not into that.

98
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,416
A bumpkin has better taste.

99
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,041
Oh, c'mon.
I was just looking at it.

100
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,875
As long as you're ogling,
treat those eyes

101
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:26,458
to something beautiful;
my own art, for example...

102
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:27,875
Your what?

103
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,791
I am actually a first-rate
sculptress...

104
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:32,833
One of my recent efforts had
over twenty-thousand downloads

105
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:35,750
in just under fifteen minutes,
believe it or not.

106
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,458
Cool, I guess--
I mean I don't know

107
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,541
all that much
about art, really...

108
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,166
Well, I guess we can't
expect much of a kid

109
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,375
who doesn't even use a
dopple... Such a pity...

110
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:50,750
Xanadu's not meant for people
comfortable with their biology.

111
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,250
Take my word for it...

112
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,750
This city puts unbelievable
things at your fingertips,

113
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,708
provided of course
they're virtual...

114
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,916
You can experience
just about anything...

115
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,750
Cultural enrichment, odyssesies
of self-discovery...

116
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:04,375
Or, for those more physically
minded, there's always

117
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:07,625
the amorous brush with
discovery of a different sort.

118
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:08,750
I'm sorry!

119
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,208
Why don't we skip
back to my place...?

120
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,333
I can get drugs; we'll get
into whatever trouble

121
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,291
your feverish little
mind can cook up.

122
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:17,166
Uh, thanks, I'll pass...
Actually, I have a friend...

123
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,916
I'm... kind of concerned...

124
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,916
Oh?

125
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,250
Yeah. She goes by Nessa...

126
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,166
I... uh, sort of lost
track of her...?

127
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,291
I really ought to double-check
and make sure that she's okay...

128
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,500
That's her...

129
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,500
Yes, well. I can certainly
see where you'd be worried.

130
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,916
I know everyone
around this valley;

131
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,708
if you'd like I'm happy
to ask if anyone's

132
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,125
caught sight of
your companions.

133
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,375
That'd be extremely helpful.

134
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:45,166
Not to pry or anything, but you
seem off-grid here...

135
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,791
You and your neighbors
aren't by any chance

136
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:49,000
part of The Lost
Millennium are you?

137
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:54,250
Oh? Nothing so radical as
all that, I can assure you.

138
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,666
We're humble folk, really.

139
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,500
Content to live off the bounty
of nature.

140
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,166
Have done for generations...

141
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,541
I'll admit we share some
ideals in common with

142
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,833
the anti-Fractale sympathiziers,
but we're pacifists.

143
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:10,666
Whoa! Get a load of this place!

144
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,375
It's beautiful...!
Don't you think so, Phryne?

145
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,416
Sure. Whatever you say.

146
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:25,125
Are you sure this is the place?

147
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:27,500
Of course. I'd know
that design anywhere.

148
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,083
That room had my "colleague's"
touch all over it...

149
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:32,458
He's a highly sought-after
dopple builder, by the way;

150
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,708
known for creating
exquisite one-offs

151
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,708
not meant
for everyday use.

152
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,583
This thing virtual too?

153
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,375
Hey! Call your off
your guards, Colin...!

154
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,458
It's Megan, you lousy chode!

155
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:06,041
Interesting. Someone I hardly
ever see brings me a guest...

156
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,750
All apologies. You have no
idea how long it's been

157
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,750
since a human's
come to visit.

158
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:13,583
I, uh... I'm looking
for a dopple that looks like

159
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,958
a little ten-year-old girl.
Have you seen her?

160
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:19,750
Oh, yes... Heh, heh...
And you are?

161
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,000
So, she's here?!

162
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,000
I believe I'm the one
asking the questions.

163
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:26,625
Well, I guess... I'm her...

164
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,208
Her what?

165
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,958
Mm. Leave it.

166
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,041
Welcome.

167
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:43,125
Nessa! Nessa...!
Are you alright?! It's me...

168
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:48,333
Hooray...
You came for Nessa...

169
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:50,583
Just hang in there...
You'll be okay...

170
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:53,500
You're on fire...
You've got a serious fever...

171
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:56,416
Wow. She can even transmit
a tactile-emulation signal

172
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,208
to a human host in real time.

173
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,666
This one is really
something else.

174
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,791
What did you do to my friend?
Why is she like this?

175
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:05,208
Relax, kid... All I did
was take her in after

176
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,750
finding the poor thing lying
unconscious in the street.

177
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,750
Chances are she's
contracted a virus.

178
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:11,833
A virus...?

179
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,958
Or it's possible she's
being hacked...

180
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,875
Whatever it is, she's
instinctively trying

181
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:18,833
to fend it off before it
does serious damage.

182
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,083
White blood cells
rally to action

183
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,708
against a virus
in your own body

184
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,833
without you having to
give them the order...

185
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,666
All you're aware
of is a fever...

186
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,250
Same principle here.

187
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,291
Frankly, given her specs,
I'm rather surprised

188
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,875
it's taking her this much effort
to ward off the onslaught

189
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:36,625
of whatever's trying to get
a foothold in her system...

190
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:40,916
But she either doesn't know how
to deal with this, or she can't.

191
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,958
Nessa's... sorry...

192
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:46,208
She thought it'd be a good idea
to come into the city to see

193
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:49,500
if she could find someone
to help us... But then...

194
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:53,458
It's okay... Rest.

195
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,750
Have you still not been
able to break through?

196
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,333
I'm sorry, sir...
The barrier is thick.

197
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:10,708
We are making progress.

198
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:13,208
Proceed, then...
We finally have a lead

199
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:16,125
as to her whereabouts...
Don't let this slip away.

200
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:17,708
Sir.

201
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,833
Barrot, sir...
One of our postings

202
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,708
has garnered a response.

203
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,166
Prepare Odin for
takeoff at once.

204
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,375
You're not just
saying that... right?

205
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:35,625
Hide n' go seek, and also
red rover? And tag?

206
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,625
And hopscotch, and tug-o'-war?

207
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,875
Hey, get better really quickly
and I'll even do another round

208
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,583
of "name that taste via
goofy dance moves."

209
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,250
Pinky swear!

210
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,333
Do what?

211
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,125
Sanko taught Nessa
how to promise...

212
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,125
It's how you're 'sposed
to seal the deal...

213
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:53,541
Give Nessa your pinky finger.

214
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,208
You mean like this?

215
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,166
If you break a pinky swear

216
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,875
you have to swallow
a thousand needles.

217
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:02,958
That doesn't sound
like much fun.

218
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,208
♪ If Clain breaks his
promise to Nessa... ♪

219
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,708
They're the ones, right?

220
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:10,541
The runaways the temple is
offering a generious reward for?

221
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,208
Figured it out, did you?

222
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,416
But of course.
Fortunately you and I

223
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,541
are the only ones
so far who have.

224
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,500
I know it's big favor to ask,
but would you mind

225
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,833
letting me take the credit
for finding them?

226
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:24,333
I'm kind of in bad odor with
the higher-ups these days;

227
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:26,458
I need something to restore
me to their good graces,

228
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:27,916
otherwise I'm on
the verge of having

229
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,791
to surrender my
network privileges--

230
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,833
In your shoes I'd get
the hell out of town...

231
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,708
Settle down someplace
where you can earn donay

232
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:36,083
in lieu of the monay
you feel entitled to...

233
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,833
Live within your means for once.

234
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:41,833
You know very well I'm working
on an installation piece,

235
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,375
and I'll be damned
if it won't earn me

236
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,375
the accolades of every
art critic, connoisseur,

237
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,500
and more importantly,
financier on the grid.

238
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:51,791
So c'mon... Throw momma
a little bone, huh?

239
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,041
Please... You think anyone
will take you seriously

240
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:59,833
after the flame war you started
over your last "installation"?

241
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:05,375
Every Tom, Dick, and Harry
knows your real-world identity.

242
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:06,875
If you'd rather not
talk about shares,

243
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,041
then by all means don't...
But it's only fair

244
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,166
for you to know I've already
contacted the temple.

245
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,333
So any way you slice it,
we'd best keep those two

246
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,750
occupied as long as possible.

247
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,333
The temple's after
two girls, though.

248
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,750
Not a girl and a boy,
last I checked...

249
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,208
The reward will be
halved as it is.

250
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,875
No need to worry about that.

251
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:33,291
As far as the net's concerned,
for the past 24 hours,

252
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:36,000
the two of 'em might as
well have been on Mars.

253
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:39,500
Discouraging...
But not terrible.

254
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:44,875
Hey, Phryne... You and
Clain... What's the lowdown?

255
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,041
Am I supposed to know
what you mean by that?

256
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,041
Uh... I didn't mean anything.

257
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:52,333
I'm just curious about, you
know... how far the two of you

258
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:55,125
have come along in your
relationship recently...

259
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,750
Don't be so naive!

260
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,833
I'm asking if you've
done what most people

261
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,708
who're dating would've
done by now...!

262
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:04,916
You know: people who're dating

263
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,125
and find each other
physically attractive...

264
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,666
Oh... I think I understand.

265
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,875
And...?

266
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,583
Clain and I are friends
and nothing more.

267
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:14,958
You're serious?

268
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,500
Very much so...
That kind of relationship...

269
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:21,500
Isn't something I deserve
to be part a of... ever.

270
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,041
What?

271
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,166
Boss. Got a sec?

272
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,708
Yeah?!

273
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,750
Well now, did you
have some reason

274
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,958
for snooping around my atelier?

275
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,666
Oh... sorry... I just...

276
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,125
I'm teasing, my dear...
Tell you what:

277
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:57,000
give me your impression of
my work and we'll call it even.

278
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,541
It's very... Interesting.

279
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,541
We wouldn't want
it to be a bore.

280
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,916
Oh, it's far from that...
It sort of resembles

281
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,833
a palsied earthworm
trying to dance a polka...

282
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:10,000
Such a pity... Yet another
plebian desperately trying

283
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:13,208
to pass herself off as
a person of substance.

284
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:20,500
The only worm in this
place is you, bitch!

285
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,958
Burrowing in the net
as they all do!

286
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:36,500
Huh... Well... Run out
of steam, have we?

287
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,041
Excellent.

288
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,708
Pervert!!

289
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:45,125
I swear, every man on the planet
is after the same thing!

290
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:47,875
Are you alright, Phryne?

291
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,291
Enri... I...

292
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,125
You feel like you'd be able
to move? These people have been

293
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:54,916
lying through their
teeth since we got here.

294
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
What?

295
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,458
This village is a front.

296
00:16:57,541 --> 00:17:00,333
Practically everyone is
a denizen of Xanadu...

297
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:01,750
Xanadu?

298
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,791
It's a virtual city where
Fractale reigns supreme...

299
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:06,000
Filthy rich degenerates
go there to indulge

300
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,083
in all kinds of
perverted stuff...

301
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,083
Wait. You mean these people...

302
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,125
Are really hedonist
billionares completely

303
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,625
hooked on the grid,
letting their dopples

304
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:16,333
run wild in a digital
paradise? Yep.

305
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:19,750
They're only pretending to lead
lives of quiet contemplation.

306
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:22,666
And according to at least one
of these lying dillweeds,

307
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,875
Gail was seen carrying
a young, unconscious boy

308
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:27,583
from the shoreline to
his hideaway last night.

309
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,125
What?

310
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,333
Damn it...

311
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:58,625
Damn it to hell...
That whore...!

312
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,958
That little whore...

313
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:10,250
If it still hurts,
it's totally okay

314
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,333
for you to put Nessa down...

315
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,833
Not while you're still
running a fever it's not.

316
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,541
You sure?

317
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,833
You know... I... kind of
had what you might call

318
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:22,208
a little revelation while
hanging out in this town...

319
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:25,250
For all the amenities here, not
being able to touch anything

320
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:28,000
is just plain sad when
you get right down to it.

321
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:31,125
Sad, and, well, cold.

322
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,208
That, and I really don't
like what it says about me

323
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,750
that I took so
long to notice...

324
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,333
Clain!

325
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,791
Just where in the hell do
you think you're going?!

326
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:53,416
Allow me to introduce you
to a virus that simply lives

327
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,583
for interfereing with a
body's Fractale terminal!

328
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:02,708
No!! Stop it!

329
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,416
You're hurting him!

330
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,041
Don't worry...

331
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:14,625
Nessa will protect Clain!

332
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,541
Oh, heavens...

333
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:10,375
Holy crap...
Look at this place.

334
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,708
Target at two o'clock, Boss.

335
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,625
Nessa... did good?

336
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:24,333
Yeah, I... I guess so.

337
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,458
Stay away from him!

338
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:33,625
Nice try, but this one's
running stand-alone...

339
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:36,375
Your power is really
breathtaking, though...

340
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,291
I'm guessing it's not
too far of stretch

341
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:39,916
to assume all
those rumors about

342
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,958
the "key" to Fractale's fate
are about you...? Yes?

343
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:48,083
True or not, Fractale's
far too important

344
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,875
for me to take a chance...
Too many people

345
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:55,333
can only ever be genuinely
free as things are now.

346
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:57,666
This world is all they have.

347
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:07,041
No!!

348
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,791
Oh god, Clain!

349
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,541
Clain!

350
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,541
I knew I'd sniff
you out, my dear...

351
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,375
It's so good to
lay eyes on you...

352
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:26,125
We've all been worried sick.
