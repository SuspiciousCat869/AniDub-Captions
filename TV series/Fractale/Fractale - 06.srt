1
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:08,916
We're here!

2
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:15,291
Ah... Good for the ol' dogs
to be on solid ground.

3
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:16,666
One more league to
the west and we'd be

4
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,416
right back within
range of Fractale...

5
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,791
I'd say this is an ideal spot

6
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:21,750
for us to do some
routine maintenance.

7
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,333
Yeah... Wouldn't
want the old girl

8
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:25,708
going all fluey on
us again, would we?

9
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:26,458
Right, Clain?

10
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:28,000
No sir!

11
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:31,375
Well, while the men folk are
tinkering with the ship,

12
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,333
why don't we gals
cook up a nice meal

13
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:35,791
as a reward for all of
their hard work?

14
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:39,125
You heard Granny.
Let's cook!

15
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,250
Not to be a nay-sayer,
but c'mon...

16
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:55,416
The temple's bound to have
extended its reach--Hello?

17
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,000
I don't like this one bit...

18
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,250
Huh?

19
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:02,583
If we're out of range,
then why is it

20
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,541
we can still see
that dopple girl?

21
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:12,125
Wow... No offense,
but that is painful to watch...

22
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:13,875
Here, just let me get the rest.

23
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:15,583
I can do this!

24
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,750
See, look...! I'm
peeling it so that

25
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:20,916
the skin will come off
in a single piece.

26
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,125
Of all the dunder-head things
to get particular about...

27
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:26,958
Good grief.

28
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,375
Hey, no fair!
You can't get wet!

29
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:32,333
Dang it, Sanko! I can tell
you're playing with Nessa!

30
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:33,958
Get up here and help us!

31
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,625
Come on, Phryne! Swim! Let's go!

32
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,000
This is not good.

33
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:55,791
My... That Phryne is
a bold one, isn't she?

34
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,208
You act all prim and proper,

35
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,958
but you sure strip down
at the drop of a hat!

36
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,916
And if I know Clain, by now I
bet his radar is going nuts!

37
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,333
Surprised the perv's
not here already--

38
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:05,833
Hey!

39
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,875
Guys! Sunda wants you...

40
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,333
Clain's a peeping Tom!

41
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,958
Clain is a pervert!

42
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,250
No! I didn't know
you guys were--

43
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:22,458
Perv, perv, perv...
Clain is a pervert!

44
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,750
Cut it out!
The water's cold! Ah!

45
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,750
He's got a camera!

46
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,583
He's taking pictures!

47
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:34,791
Hold on!

48
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,333
Clain!

49
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,708
Wait! I just want to...

50
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:45,083
A genuine, antique digital
camera that actually works!

51
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:46,583
That's awesome!

52
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:49,166
Your kind have to look out for
each other, is that it...?

53
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,125
There anything you pervs won't
let each other get away with?

54
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:58,000
It's one thing to have it...
But getting it to work?

55
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,541
Are you still thinking
about the camera guy...?

56
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,416
Oh, wow...
Where are they going?

57
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,541
Dunno.

58
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:13,458
They go wherever the
wind carries them.

59
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,583
We call 'em out of
range refugees.

60
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,208
They look pretty lost.

61
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,541
Yeah... It's sad.

62
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:20,041
When the balloons
crashed and burned,

63
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:21,916
the radio frequencies
fell off out this way

64
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,833
and left these people
without access.

65
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,208
You're looking at souls who've
grown so dependent on Fractale

66
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,875
they don't know any
other way to live.

67
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,458
Only choice open
to 'em is to pick up

68
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,375
and seek out another hot zone.

69
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,291
The system failed them.
Left them dry...

70
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,458
They've been more
or less condemned

71
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,125
to live life as a
nomadic tribe...

72
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,541
I get pissed off just
thinking about it.

73
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,208
Oh, man...

74
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:44,791
Nessa...

75
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:47,166
Let go! There's not a damn
thing in here for you!

76
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,416
This is mine!

77
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,000
Don't give us that
line, old man...!

78
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,750
We're not stupid; you're
hiding food in there!

79
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,166
Ah! It's...!

80
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,750
We're better off leaving it be;

81
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:57,000
fights like these break out all
the time between these types...

82
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,416
They're animals,
every last one of 'em.

83
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,083
Oh, no!

84
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,041
Uh-oh!

85
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:04,750
No!!

86
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,291
Put it down!

87
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:08,666
Who the hell are you?!

88
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,416
Stop! You'll break something
more valuable than food!

89
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,958
Have you lost your mind...?!

90
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,958
This is not a scuffle you want
to get in the middle of...!

91
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,625
Trust me on this!

92
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,000
Everybody, freeze!

93
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,375
Who are you?

94
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,250
That hurt...?

95
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:51,500
Ah, but this pain is such a
petty, superficial thing...

96
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:54,291
Not really the core of your
problem, I would guess.

97
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,416
Hey! Let go of me...

98
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,625
I bet it's nothing compared
to what your heart feels...

99
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,541
Shattering under the
weight of betrayal...

100
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:03,250
knowing Fractale
abandoned all of you...

101
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,791
Stop it, Dias.

102
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,416
Well, look at that... Sunda...

103
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,916
Feels like I haven't
seen you in forever.

104
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,791
Wish I could say I
felt the same way...

105
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,125
Still up to no good?

106
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:16,833
 You two know each other?

107
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,916
Everyone's attention,
if you please...

108
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,458
We are from the Alabaster clan;

109
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,000
a proud part of the movement
known as Lost Millennium...

110
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:27,125
Our mission is to aid those
whom Fractale left behind...

111
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:30,000
poor souls searching
for a signal.

112
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,666
One sector to the east lies
a village reduced to ruins

113
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,666
by Fractale's treachery,
now our outpost.

114
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,333
If you will follow me there,
you'll have food

115
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,958
and a warm bed to sleep in.

116
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:43,416
Don't be afraid...
We bear you no ill will.

117
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,333
Well, that was kinda weird...

118
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,708
Where's he going?

119
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,583
No loyalty among
perverts, huh...?

120
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,833
You'd think he'd at
least say thank you.

121
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:08,750
Where you going?!

122
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,416
Where the heck could
he have gotten to?

123
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,833
You're kidding me!
An antenna?!

124
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,500
You followin' me?

125
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:35,250
It's not what you think...!
Your hobbies are fine with me.

126
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,833
I don't care who you
photograph...?!

127
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,083
I mean, sure,
it's kind of strange

128
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,541
when you try to be all sneaky...

129
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,375
but Phryne does kind of
take her clothes off a lot,

130
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,458
and you couldn't have
known that about her...

131
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:47,416
Answer me this then, kid...
Why'd you come all this way?

132
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,708
Because... You seem
like a neat guy

133
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,666
to strike up a friendship with.

134
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,625
 Look at all this stuff...!
You've got to be kidding!

135
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:00,458
Whoa...! Vacuum tubes!

136
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,750
I've never seen any up
close like this before...!

137
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,333
This place is like a
friggin' museum!

138
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,916
Got a thing for antiques, do ya?

139
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,458
Yeah!

140
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,833
The hell for...? They're just
garbage from another age...

141
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:14,875
Flotsam and jetsam.

142
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:18,041
I guess you're right...
I don't know why.

143
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,083
Dad kept an old projector
in the house...

144
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:23,000
Maybe that's what started it.

145
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,875
I couldn't really tell you why
my folks had one lying around...

146
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,958
But the damage was done.

147
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,750
Their dopples
consider it junk...

148
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,208
They're always on my
back to throw it out

149
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:34,125
'cause they think it
clutters the place up.

150
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,833
A twenty-first
century cell phone!

151
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,083
Heh... Those were the days
when people appreciated

152
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,000
things you could
actually hold in your hand...

153
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,000
They really knew what they
were doing back then...

154
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,583
No mere raw data for
those folks, huh?

155
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:48,000
Don't tell me...
You're with the L.M.

156
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,750
For the record, I'm not
"with" anybody--

157
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,541
certainly not a bunch of
half-baked extremists!

158
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,916
But, uh... Well, I guess
if I'm totally honest...

159
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,958
I suppose they're not
really all that bad.

160
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:02,250
Somebody's got a lot to learn.

161
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:05,083
There's a new moon tonight,
boy... You're just in time...

162
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,541
Why don't you come back
here after it gets dark?

163
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,541
I'll show you something
you won't soon forget.

164
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:15,791
What?! That was all
we had for tonight?!

165
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,291
Of course it was...!

166
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,166
Should have been here on time
if you were so hungry...!

167
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,000
Part of being a valued
member of this group

168
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,583
is following the rules...
So tough titty!

169
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,291
Oh, wait... Those
Alabaster guys

170
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,166
said they were distributing
food, right...?

171
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,333
Surely they still have
enough left over to--

172
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,541
You even think of mooching
off the Alabaster gang--

173
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:36,166
I'll throw you out of
the Danan myself!

174
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,833
Aren't you guys all part
of the same thing...?

175
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,791
What've you got against them?

176
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:42,208
Let's just say not all
Lost Millennium factions

177
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:43,541
see eye to eye...

178
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:46,375
Not every revolutionary
mind is created equal.

179
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:50,041
Oh, yeah?! Because if you ask
me, between Dias and Sunda...

180
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:53,250
It's pretty clear which of them
has a better head on their--

181
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,041
You know it really is
just too bad someone

182
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,000
couldn't be bothered to show
up for dinner on time...

183
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:59,375
It's a helluva thing having
to keep watch all night

184
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,000
on an empty stomach.

185
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,041
What are you up to?

186
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,083
Uhh... Please don't tell...!

187
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,625
You can't imagine how
badly I need to do this!

188
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,875
What's so important you're
willing to get into trouble?

189
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,750
Well... This is probably
gonna seem a little odd to you,

190
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,166
but I kind of made a promise
to that guy with the camera.

191
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,375
One pervert to another?

192
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:45,958
No, no! Believe me...!

193
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:51,041
This guy really isn't like that
at all... at least... I think.

194
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:54,416
Wow. This man has certainly
piqued your interest...

195
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,500
Well, that settles it then;
I'm going with you.

196
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:01,250
Look, we... sorta agreed to
make this just between us men...

197
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:04,833
I'm sorry, but girls
aren't... allowed.

198
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:08,458
I will have you know, mister,

199
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,416
that I am Phryne
before I'm a girl...

200
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,250
Did this person
expressly tell you

201
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:15,625
no "Phrynes" were allowed
on your little excursion?

202
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:19,416
Well, no, but... Ugh! Fine!

203
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:28,208
Hmm. What's going on down there?

204
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,625
That must be the Alabaster camp.

205
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,708
Patience people!
No cutting in line!

206
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:36,916
There's more than
enough to go around;

207
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,083
everyone'll get their share.

208
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,708
Vaccinations are now
available, my friends...

209
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,416
And if you're not aware
of the alpha virus

210
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,291
the malnourished
are susceptible to,

211
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,291
all the more reason
to protect yourself.

212
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,750
Are the vaccinations...?

213
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,708
Free? Yes... Donay and
Monay units are little more

214
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,458
than empty numbers to members
of the Lost Millennium.

215
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,583
I don't know how to thank you...
You truly are a godsend!

216
00:12:58,666 --> 00:12:59,916
No one's ever been
this good to us!

217
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,291
It's the least we could do.

218
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:04,208
It's more than enough!
One of these days,

219
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,666
we're going to repay you for
the kindness you've shown.

220
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,166
Please... Come in.

221
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,833
Yes, sir!

222
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,666
Right. Line up!

223
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,875
Oh, wow... I guess
Lost Millennium

224
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,083
attracts all types
of people, huh?

225
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,083
You gotta admit: handing
out vaccinations

226
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:29,041
for free is pretty
darn impressive.

227
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:32,500
All the same... I think I
prefer the Granite clan to them.

228
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,083
Hey, look, don't get me wrong:

229
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:37,041
I'm not down on Sunda and the
group or anything... I mean...

230
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,833
yes, I do think they've
got some problems,

231
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,708
but deep down they're
a good bunch.

232
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:43,208
You're still implying
that Alabaster's better.

233
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:44,791
Look at it objectively...

234
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:48,125
You saw how well taken care
of those refugees were...

235
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,333
What's your problem?

236
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:57,958
What's <i>your</i> problem?

237
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,166
Can't stand to lose, can you?

238
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,333
No more than you can!

239
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,416
A girl?

240
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,416
You're not mad... are you?

241
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,666
A pleasant evening to you,
sir... I'm coming inside.

242
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,708
You can't just barge
in there... jeez!

243
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,333
Is this your girlfriend?

244
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,416
Ew, no!

245
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,250
Alright, then...
I suppose she can join us.

246
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:34,666
Hey, thanks a lot...!
Come on, Phryne! Hurry up!

247
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,250
 'kay.

248
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,583
Okay, I'll give her the whole

249
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,500
"I'm Phryne before
I'm a girl" thing...

250
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:49,041
But she could at least
still act like a girl.

251
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:53,916
Holy cow! It looks even more
incredible up close...!

252
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,791
The way you must've
scrapped this thing together

253
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,041
has a lot in common
with the Danan.

254
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,208
Almost there...

255
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,875
In just a few seconds...
I'll show you something

256
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,375
that blows antiquing
out of the water.

257
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,583
Nights of the new moon...

258
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:26,000
The temple range-tests a
bunch of the older balloons...

259
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,416
Spikes up the base frequency
just a fraction...

260
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,625
If I tune this baby right,
the antenna array picks it up.

261
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,750
I get it... This is how
this place looked

262
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,416
before the balloon fell and
it lost its connectivity.

263
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,291
You got it, son... That's
what my work here's about...

264
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:42,208
I'm gonna plug this no man's
land back into the grid.

265
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,875
Right or wrong, Fractale
is how we live now.

266
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,750
People can't
function without it,

267
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:49,125
and why even try...?
It's better than

268
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,333
wandering around
aimlessly in the darkness...

269
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,375
By god...! Give me
one good reason

270
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,916
a place like this doesn't
deserve a second chance...!

271
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,500
I...

272
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,583
You okay?

273
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:06,375
Not yet...! The best part's
still 'round the corner,

274
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:09,666
believe you me...
Come on, girl.

275
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,541
Climb down and go
to the square.

276
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:15,625
See for yourselves...
trust me... It's amazing.

277
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,416
If you say so.

278
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:26,958
it's unbelievable!

279
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,416
This is a Fractale town!

280
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,291
Hey! What is it you see?

281
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:33,000
What the hell...?
I can't see anything!

282
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,875
What is going on?

283
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,791
Where the heck did he fall?

284
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,000
Hold on a minute! Clain!

285
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,291
It's not what it seems!

286
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,041
What happened?

287
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:56,583
Mr. Dias...

288
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,208
The connection's restored...

289
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,291
What the hell--
we haven't finished

290
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,166
the procedure on
everyone yet...

291
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,625
Mister... What is this...?

292
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:03,791
What's going on...?! I--

293
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,791
Ah. Are you ill at ease...?

294
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:08,333
I might've misled you
about the vaccination...

295
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:09,833
What we actually
did was remove

296
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:12,125
your Fractale
terminals permanently.

297
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,666
You bald-faced liar!

298
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,541
Where did all that
gratitude go...?

299
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,916
And you swore to
repay our kindness.

300
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:28,333
Come now...
Redirect that anger...

301
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:31,083
Use it to help us fight
against Fractale.

302
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,166
I'm out of here!

303
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,708
That so?

304
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,541
Escape is someone
else's dream...

305
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,791
Provided you could
find another hot zone,

306
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,291
you've been stripped
of your terminals for good.

307
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:57,333
Connection is impossible.

308
00:17:57,416 --> 00:18:01,708
But don't worry... Lost
Millennium will provide for you.

309
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,291
No!

310
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,916
You all right?

311
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:28,416
Please tell me you're alright!

312
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,958
Has... Has it already
blinked out?

313
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,125
Mister!

314
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:35,541
Good as the antenna is,

315
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:38,041
the frequencies it picks
up are transient...

316
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:41,291
But you saw it...? The square?

317
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,083
Yes, I... I think...

318
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:45,625
But that's not important now...!
You need a hospital...!

319
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,541
Please, Mister...
The Danan can drop you off

320
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,041
somewhere in range
of Fractale...

321
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,666
You can get proper
medical treatment!

322
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,125
Heh... I don't think so.

323
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,291
But... You could die!

324
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,583
So...? Heh...

325
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,250
There's no one around
anymore to grieve

326
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,833
over a cranky old
hobbyist like me.

327
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:07,833
Not true... I'd be really
sad to see you go.

328
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:11,791
Back home I never hang
out with real people...

329
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:13,958
All I do is interact
with dopples...

330
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,916
Hardly anyone shares
my hobbies...

331
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,375
And those that do--
I don't know their faces!

332
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:23,125
So, yeah...! I'd grieve.

333
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,958
You're very nice... But...

334
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,458
I couldn't abandon this
old place if I wanted to.

335
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:29,833
Of course you could!

336
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,583
This house and its clutter
is an extension of me.

337
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:36,208
My most precious memories are
the junk of bygone eras.

338
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,500
You said so yourself:
this stuff isn't

339
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:42,125
some digital ether,
it's real; tangible.

340
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,041
A lot of people wouldn't
understand it...

341
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,916
And I wouldn't really
expect 'em to...

342
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,083
But if I'm gonna keep
searching for Fractale,

343
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:52,458
unless it's from here
there's no point to it for me.

344
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,208
It's alright. I get it.

345
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:57,750
Tell you what...

346
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,416
This should be yours.

347
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,875
Why are you giving this to me?

348
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,000
He'll be okay.

349
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:35,875
Oh... Pics?

350
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:37,458
Stolen ones, I'm afraid.

351
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:38,833
You stole these...?!

352
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:42,500
You've got some scary layers
to you, you know that?

353
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:45,208
Wait, these are the pictures
that pervert took!

354
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:48,583
And I'm a little surprised at
the subject matter, actually...

355
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:51,083
This one's quite a bit
older than the others.

356
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,083
Aww! Little baby fingers!

357
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,750
I think I have a pretty good
idea who this baby is.

358
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,708
Oh, yeah? Who?
