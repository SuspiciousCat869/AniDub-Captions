1
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,916
 Alright, then.
I think the coast is clear.

2
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,666
I've heard tell of God's fury
at a people brazen enough

3
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,166
to try and build an edifice
to equal his glory.

4
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,541
I'm inclined to believe
that we share that hubris,

5
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:34,375
and that it has finally brought
upon us the wrath of heaven.

6
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,083
You speak blasphemy!

7
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,291
Damn the L.M.

8
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,500
Fools! I alone have
walked in the light

9
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,625
where my forebears
stumbled in darkness...!

10
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:46,541
I alone have refined the key
to Fractale's salvation...!

11
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:50,250
Yet a band of ruffians thinks
nothing of spitting in my face--

12
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,583
Oh, my dear... yes...
I have you.

13
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:02,250
152589... I knew
it would be you.

14
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,125
If sapping the life and
love of countless girls

15
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:07,916
is the measure of our success...

16
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,875
Then well have we reaped
the reward of our cruelty...

17
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,625
How fragile this world is--

18
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,291
Is that bitterness I hear?

19
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:18,708
Do you think yourself a
displaced God... No. 141923?

20
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:22,000
You know full well that I do
not consider myself a god.

21
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:25,208
She and she alone
can answer that need.

22
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,291
I wonder what's to become
of you in all this...

23
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:31,166
It breaks my heart to think
what your next move must be.

24
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,500
We are but identical links
in an endless chain.

25
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,333
Fractale decrees that
we shall not be whole

26
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:40,583
in and of ourselves;
but strong only in pieces...

27
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:43,125
One, only together.

28
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,250
It is through submission
to this pitiless scheme

29
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,291
that happiness for
all is ensured...

30
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:51,000
I know this in my heart of
hearts... As Archpriestess,

31
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:55,083
I accept what becomes of me:
what must be done.

32
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:02,166
This world teeters perilously
on the brink of annihilation...

33
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,583
Mutiny prunes the tree
from which we feast;

34
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,958
would see it rotted...
its fruit left to wither

35
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,375
in the unforgiving dust...

36
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,625
Our way of life will
end... cut to tinder

37
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:15,083
by the axe-wielding children
of the Lost Millennium.

38
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,041
Though their blades
be dull and few,

39
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,791
the sheer persistence
of their blows

40
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:22,875
has taken a disastrous
toll upon this Temple.

41
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:25,083
And our mercy has
reached its limit...

42
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:28,583
It is not only us, but the world
which demands their death.

43
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:29,833
You guys are from
that ship docked

44
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:32,291
on the outskirts of the
town, aren't you?

45
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,750
Boss, wait!

46
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:40,416
Grant their souls
everlasting peace...

47
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,125
Let them rejoin Fractale
as symbols of penance.

48
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,375
Her fever shows no
sign of breaking.

49
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,500
What about you, Phryne?
How're you feeling right now?

50
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:55,833
I'm alright.

51
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,625
Look you say that,
but I know better...

52
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:01,083
What you need is rest...
Especially after what you've--

53
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:08,833
I don't disagree... But I'll
need your help to fall asleep.

54
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:13,000
Last thing I want to
do is dream... So...

55
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,708
You want me to stay with you?

56
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:22,000
Nessa wants to hold hands
with Clain and Phryne!

57
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:24,958
Welcome back, Ness.

58
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,291
And it's not a mistake?!

59
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:29,375
I wish. But, no: it's an
all-out imperial ordinance

60
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:32,208
from the Archpriestess;
first of its kind in 300 years!

61
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:35,750
...Sunda, we were just
in town and the Arch--

62
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:39,750
What's Ryme saying? He leaving
us to deal with this alone?

63
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:43,500
Her temperature's starting
to level off, I think.

64
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:46,750
That feels nice... Nessa likes
how cold Phryne's hands are.

65
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,875
Poor circulation has its use.

66
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:52,125
You know, I could swear you were
sisters, seeing you like this.

67
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,958
Oh. Yeah, right.

68
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,916
Silly me; I guess you
two are kinda sisters...

69
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,125
Or, you know, whatever
the name for it is...

70
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:00,875
I'll shut up now...

71
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So, uh... Would you like to
know about Nessa and me?

72
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,750
It'd be nice to have some idea
about what's going on...

73
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:15,708
I really shouldn't have left you
in the dark as long as I have.

74
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:18,125
It's not easy to explain,
but basically Nessa

75
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,625
is like the ephemeral
spirit of a God...

76
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:23,500
A long time ago, in a whole
other life, before Fractale,

77
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,333
her soul was the first
to inhabit this body.

78
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:27,958
What does that mean?

79
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,083
Nessa is the original mind...

80
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:34,250
I am just one of many bodies
prepared for her to inhabit.

81
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,416
The Temple believes that
when Nessa--the soul--

82
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,333
merges with me--the body--

83
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:42,166
the "key" to Fractale's
salvation will manifest itself.

84
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,083
The system's been
breaking down for ages;

85
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:45,625
and the "key" remains
the only hope

86
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:48,000
of staving off what would
otherwise be inevitable:

87
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:51,083
the triumph of
entropy over order.

88
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,208
'Kay, but what does it mean
for the two of you to merge?

89
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:55,166
That's sort of ambiguous...

90
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,333
I don't really know.

91
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:02,083
But when we do merge,
my guess is... Well...

92
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,375
It will be the end
of what we are now.

93
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,375
What does that mean,
"the way you are now?"

94
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,875
Are you saying if you do this
merging thing, you'll die?

95
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:14,416
Clain, I...

96
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,375
What is it?!

97
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:22,500
Nessa saw herself...
Nessa disappeared completely...

98
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:27,125
But... She doesn't want to die!
Nessa wants to be Nessa!

99
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,833
Disappearing is forever!

100
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:32,500
Then there's only darkness and
loneliness and no more friends!

101
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:34,375
Hey! That's not going to happen!

102
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,541
Don't let Nessa disappear!

103
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,583
Say she gets to go
on being Nessa!

104
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,875
You have to promise, Clain!

105
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:48,708
It's going to be okay.
I promise.

106
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,416
Not a damn thing is
going to change...

107
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,291
You're going to go right on
being what you are...

108
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:58,250
Your smile won't fade. Your
laughter's not going to stop.

109
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:02,291
Nessa is going to be Nessa;
Phryne is going to be Phryne.

110
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:05,500
And that's how it'll
always be... From now on.

111
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,875
I have no problem
feeling you right now...

112
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,375
You can still feel me like
you always have, right?

113
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,750
Nessa feels you.

114
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,458
I'm not gonna lie;
the whole thing's still

115
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,958
a big mystery to me,
but you know what?

116
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:24,125
I for one am not gonna look
a gift-horse in the mouth.

117
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,291
Boss!

118
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,875
What is it?
What's going on?

119
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,750
The townspeople have gathered
outside the ship with torches!

120
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,916
I'm sorry, but we need
your people to leave.

121
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,291
Does the damn Temple
intimidate you that badly?

122
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,625
They'd cut off our donay supply

123
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,458
if they found out we were
harboring you lot...

124
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,708
Nothing to be done against
a threat like that...

125
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,375
What would you do in our shoes?

126
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:02,000
This just proves how badly you
need to break free of 'em...!

127
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,291
They've been controlling
every aspect of your lives

128
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:05,791
since the day that
you were born...!

129
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,291
How much longer are
you willing to suffer

130
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,458
before you refuse to be
a puppet anymore?!

131
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:10,958
You'd have us die?

132
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:13,458
That's not what we're saying!
We just want you to act

133
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,666
like genuine human beings
for once in your life!

134
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,625
You're murderers.

135
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,416
You destroyed one of
their medical facilities

136
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,958
without a thought.

137
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,125
Is that true?!

138
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:24,875
That's not how...

139
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,500
It's true.

140
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,041
Butchers!

141
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,125
You sons of bitches don't give
a damn who you have to kill

142
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,708
to bring the system
down, do you?!

143
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:34,291
You'll be the end of us all!
Get out of our town!

144
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,250
Peddle your bullshit
somewhere else!

145
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,666
You're going to
endanger our children!

146
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,666
At the end of the day they're
only human, you know?

147
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,500
At least they own their fear...

148
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:54,750
That's always the first step
toward genuine courage.

149
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:57,875
I don't understand.
Why is the Temple suddenly

150
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:00,250
changing its tune
about you guys?

151
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,666
'Cause they're in dire straits.

152
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,208
They need us to hand you over.
They're upping the ante.

153
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:06,791
They know we'd never
turn you guys in

154
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,208
'cause the last thing we want
is for Fractale to be saved...

155
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,666
The Temple wants to
"reboot" the system

156
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,458
while they still can and
they know we'd be damned

157
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:15,750
before we see that
happen. Make sense?

158
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,833
Yes it does...
Too much sense.

159
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,416
Look, don't overthink
things, kiddo...

160
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,333
What's going on isn't your
fault, it's just that--

161
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:22,666
What?!

162
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,125
What is it?

163
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,666
They've made their move...
The village has been hit...

164
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,833
The Temple set it on fire!

165
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,166
Porphyry, Diorite,
Greywacke, and Granite,

166
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,000
all burned to the
ground tonight...

167
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,541
Four villages destroyed by
the Temple because of us!

168
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,583
I'm told no one in
Greywacke survived.

169
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,000
They took the brunt
of it and none of us

170
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,416
was there to protect them.

171
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,916
You see?! That's why
I was so deadset

172
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,208
against being the
aggressor in all this!

173
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:56,000
Duly noted, but it's meaningless
to assign blame at this point.

174
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,583
We must defend our families!

175
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,583
I agree. We'll separate
and protect our homes.

176
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,791
I'm sorry our first quorum
meeting in fifty years

177
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:04,791
has to end on this note.

178
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:07,291
If there are no objections,
I move we adjourn.

179
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,750
Objection.

180
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,833
How can none of you see
that the Temple's resorting

181
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,916
to these measures because
the position we're in

182
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,833
puts them between a
rock and hard place...?

183
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,458
There is no more opportune
moment to strike than now.

184
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:18,458
Dias, please...

185
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:19,625
I agree with him!

186
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,000
I say we go at them!

187
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,708
We can't just knuckle
under to tactics like this!

188
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,958
Well, I daresay destroying
the lab has given someone

189
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,375
a great deal of clout in
a short amount of time...

190
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,750
Suppose we consent to
your rallying cry, Dias;

191
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,833
what exactly do we have
to strike at them with?

192
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:36,708
Sunda just so happens to have
the key to rebooting Fractale

193
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:39,750
as a guest onboard the Danan.
Isn't that right?

194
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:40,791
Is this true?!

195
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:43,708
Are you holding
out on us, Granite?

196
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:46,291
And what of it if I am?

197
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,208
You do understand...?
The Temple has essentially let

198
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,791
its raison d'etre slip right
through it's greasy fingers.

199
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:54,750
Without the key, they're a husk
of what they once were...

200
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,958
Their position is as
weak as its ever been...

201
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,833
Making this the perfect moment
for our clans to swoop in

202
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:03,083
and realize Lost Millennium's
thousand-year-old ambition!

203
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:08,375
Boss! The quorum
meeting is done!

204
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:09,875
So what did they decide?

205
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:12,166
To attack... The
clans have agreed

206
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,333
to consolidate their military
power and storm the Temple

207
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:17,208
before any further actions
against us can be taken.

208
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,541
Yeah!

209
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:21,375
Yes! Muster up all
the ammunition we have!

210
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,500
It's gonna be a showdown!

211
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,416
Can I talk to you?

212
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,583
What is it?

213
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,250
Okay, so correct me
here if I'm wrong,

214
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,958
but the L.M.'s trying to
change things, right?

215
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,125
It is.

216
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,500
Change them how?

217
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,000
You asking me what kind
of world we'll have

218
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,458
when it's all over with...?

219
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,958
Tell me, kid, what kind
would you like?

220
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,375
I don't know...
I definitely think

221
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:56,000
that what the Temple's
been doing is wrong.

222
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:01,000
I think it's time for me
to get in this fight...

223
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:04,333
I can't just keep standing
around on the side lines.

224
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,708
How much good you think
you'd be in a fight?

225
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:07,875
Gee, thanks!

226
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,250
If you want to be
treated like a soldier,

227
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,125
then I'll give you orders...
Stay here in the village

228
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,041
and promise me that you'll
protect Phryne and Nessa

229
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,791
with everything you've got.

230
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,083
They have to stay
here at any rate...

231
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,541
We can't risk the Temple
getting them back

232
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,875
or shooting them down
with the rest of us, can we?

233
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:25,416
And besides... I
appreciate the sentiment,

234
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,083
but this is Lost Millennium's
fight, not yours...

235
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,500
Trust me... You're a good kid...

236
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,541
Hell, I'd even go so far
as to call you friend...

237
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:35,791
Everyone on board would...
But you're not one of us.

238
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,666
Still... There
actually is one thing

239
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,458
that only you could do
to help the effort...

240
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,041
Yeah?

241
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,333
Everybody move just a
little closer in, 'kay?

242
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:47,708
I wanna make sure I get
all of you in the shot.

243
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:54,416
Nessa, you ready...?
Lookin' good!

244
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,250
Don't take it yet!

245
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,875
There he is!
Way to be on time, doofus!

246
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,458
Hey... I had to get this.

247
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,041
That's very sweet of you...

248
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,583
But late-comers have to move
to the back of the line!

249
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,000
What'd I tell you,
Butcher, old pal?

250
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:09,208
She's a ball-buster...
Same as always.

251
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,541
Damn right I am.

252
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:14,958
Alright, that's everyone...
Let's snap this puppy.

253
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,666
Everybody stay like you are.

254
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,291
I don't want Daddy to be killed!

255
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:31,458
Be sure to leave the picture

256
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:34,166
with Granny Elder
and the others, okay?

257
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,166
Wait, you're going
along for the fight?

258
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,541
Like Sunda's got a chance
in hell of stopping me.

259
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,791
Yeah. No kidding, right?

260
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:44,291
By the way, I kinda wanted...
to tell you something...

261
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,666
Oh, yeah?

262
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:50,333
Well, uh... You see...

263
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,083
Look, if you gotta use
the bathroom or something,

264
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,041
you can tell me later--

265
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,833
Do you always
have to be a perv?!

266
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:57,458
What the hell'd I do
to deserve that?!

267
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:58,791
You shut up!

268
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,250
You've got till we get
back from the front lines

269
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,208
to clean up your act
or so help me, Clain,

270
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:03,750
I will make you rue the
day you hit puberty...

271
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,750
Clean up my act?
You're the one hitting people!

272
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,250
Enri's angry!

273
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,208
How can they laugh and carry on
like that before a battle?

274
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,000
Aren't they terrified?

275
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,750
Well, naturally
they're terrified...

276
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,000
All the more reason to cut up.

277
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:18,125
I think I'm too afraid of death
for that... aren't you?

278
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,541
Hey now... There're
things out there

279
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,250
a lot more frightening
than death;

280
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:24,000
like not being able to
protect your loved ones.

281
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,541
True.

282
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,208
That's why Clain's gonna look
after you while we're gone:

283
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,916
we want you both to feel safe.

284
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:33,041
I do feel safe...
I know Clain will do

285
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,625
everything he can to
protect me from harm...

286
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:37,708
And I'm grateful
to him for that.

287
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:42,666
Alright! Now...!
All hands on deck!

288
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,750
Keep running the
engines at half power.

289
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,458
I want us at a snail's pace.

290
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,208
Done and done!

291
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,875
It's time to bring
this fight to them!

292
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,708
It's so pretty!

293
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,250
It certainly is.

294
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:12,958
You know, there are all sorts
of people in this world...

295
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,083
Those who swear by Fractale;
those who hate it.

296
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,291
Some who'd do anything
to see it continue on;

297
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,125
some who'd do anything
to see it falter;

298
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:22,333
and people like me who
can't make up their minds.

299
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,333
But when it comes down to it,
the world doesn't care

300
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:27,583
about Fractale. It just keeps
moving forward on its own.

301
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,083
Clain...

302
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:35,291
If the Day Star could grant
your wish... What would it be?

303
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,125
Oh that's an easy one;
to be by the side

304
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:40,416
of the people I love
forever... Not bad, huh?

305
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,791
And it's totally gonna happen!
Because Clain gets to stay

306
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,708
by Nessa and Phryne's side
for his whole entire life...!

307
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:53,458
Fooorever!

308
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:56,458
And everyone'll live happily
ever after, won't they?

309
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:57,708
You bet they will.

310
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,250
Absolutely.

311
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,541
"Dear Clain... I wish
I could tell you

312
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,208
why I left that
first night, but...

313
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:16,625
I guess the truth is,
however hard I look at it,

314
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:19,083
I really don't understand
why myself..."

315
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
"I stood by my decision then,
though... and I still do."

316
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,500
"You have to understand
that Nessa was me

317
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:33,083
when I was beautiful and free.

318
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:36,833
I haven't been that person in
a long time, but with you...

319
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:41,250
she stands a chance.
So I'm leaving...

320
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:44,041
If anyone can begin to
convince Archpriestess Moeran

321
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:47,916
or my father,
it would surely be me.

322
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,958
Because I am half of the key."

323
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:54,916
"I'm sorry for leaving
without saying anything...

324
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,125
But since this all started
because I left the temple...

325
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,916
I believe I have to
go back and end it...

326
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,750
It was you, Clain, who made
me feel that I could...

327
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:10,750
that I wanted to...
You, Nessa, and everyone else.

328
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:18,083
I am grateful to you all.
Thank you. With love, Phryne."

329
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,541
Didn't we just talk about the
three of us staying together?!

330
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:25,708
How could she go off and do

331
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,541
a thing like this
without talking to us?!

332
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:28,958
You know what?
It doesn't matter!

333
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,833
I am done trying to get my
head around that woman...!

334
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,208
After all we've been
through together,

335
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:33,916
she's just as self-centered
and arrogant

336
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
as she was the
first time we met!

337
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,250
So, then... What are
you going to do?

338
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,291
Oh, you wanna know what
I'm gonna do about this?

339
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,208
Not a damn thing!
To hell with her!

340
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,541
You promised!

341
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,791
A thousand needles...!
Remember...!

342
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:50,041
Nessa's decided she
really likes Phryne...

343
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,041
Sure, she was mean
and scary at first...

344
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,958
But it turns out Phryne is
pretty nice after all...

345
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,500
More than nice, in fact...

346
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:59,250
And Nessa knows that Clain
really likes her, too!

347
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,375
Well... look, it's not that...

348
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:05,625
Come on. Clain likes being
happy just as much as anyone...

349
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:09,875
So! Admit you like her...
Nessa knows you do.

350
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:17,333
I like Phryne! Is that what
you wanna hear?! You happy?!

351
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,250
Damnit, she really
owes me for this one...

352
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,291
Phryne, you're an idiot!!

353
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,500
We're ready.

354
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:35,125
All ships, prepare to
engage immediately...

355
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:40,041
The second the enemy's in range,
open fire. I repeat: open fire.

356
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,166
Missiles in launch
position, now!

357
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,375
Fire!

358
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:59,375
Just you wait, Phryne...

359
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:03,166
You're not getting away from me
this time. I promise you that.

360
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:05,666
Okay, listen:
I'm not gonna lie,

361
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,625
if the Temple gets
a hold of you, the world is in

362
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:10,666
a lot of trouble... Still sure
you wanna come along?

363
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:15,750
We're staying together, Clain...
Forever... You promised Nessa.

364
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,666
That settles it. Let's go
save Phryne from herself!

365
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,458
Aye-aye, capt'n!

366
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:42,083
<i>Down by the salley gardens</i>
<i>my love and I did meet</i>

367
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:55,958
<i>She passed the salley gardens</i>
<i>with little snow-white feet</i>

368
00:21:56,041 --> 00:22:10,000
<i>She bid me take love easy,</i>
<i>as the leaves grow on the tree</i>

369
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:23,958
<i>But I, being young and foolish,</i>
<i>with her did not agree</i>

370
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:47,916
<i>But I was young and foolish,</i>
<i>and now I am full of tears</i>

371
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,916
<i>But I was young and foolish,</i>
<i>and now I am full of tears</i>
