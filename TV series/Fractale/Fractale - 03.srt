1
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:46,083
Whoa! Look, Clain!
There's a teddy bear...!

2
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:47,250
And some snacks...

3
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:49,125
Both of which will
come in very handy...

4
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:51,708
Since the two of us
are about to be killed.

5
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:56,833
Well, actually you're
a just a dopple... So...

6
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,166
I'm the only one who
has a life to forfeit.

7
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:07,791
Ow...

8
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:14,416
You gonna try and
get out of that net,

9
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,541
or are you two
pretending to be tuna?

10
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:17,958
What's that mean?

11
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:19,916
Move it, seafood!

12
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:33,000
--Whoa!
--Whoa!

13
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,666
And where do you
think you're going...?!

14
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,208
Hey...! Damn it! Wait up!

15
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:42,708
Wow...! Look at this stuff!

16
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:46,500
They're using actual
antique monitors!

17
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,250
All the pretty yellow blooms!

18
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,291
This is not a field
trip, pipsqueak!

19
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:51,708
In case you haven't noticed,
you're prisoners...

20
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:54,083
No way! You've got
to be kidding me!

21
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,583
Jeez.

22
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:02,291
Can it... or we'll can it
for you... Sayyy hello!

23
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:08,208
Your sniper's using a
bona fide optical sight!

24
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,000
I have found paradise!

25
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,750
You're an itchy trigger
finger from the real deal!

26
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,208
 Oh hello!

27
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,166
Enri!

28
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,500
You're back!

29
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:23,291
Yup...! You finish
all your homework?

30
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:24,291
Mm hmm!

31
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,500
Welcome back.

32
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:26,875
I take it that's
the trouble-maker

33
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,833
Sunda's been up in arms about?

34
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,750
Right... Sorry.

35
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,458
We've got more company!

36
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:47,166
It's so nice to meet you!
Let's shake hands, kay?

37
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:57,875
Dear, dear... Does this mean a
dopple came along for the ride?

38
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,416
Sure did.

39
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,875
My, what a darling outfit...

40
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,416
What splendid fashion
sense she has.

41
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,083
Oh, that's precious!
Let me get a closer look...

42
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,083
Aren't you just a darling?

43
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,416
Thank you... Enri!

44
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,000
I don't get it... Why
couldn't they see Nessa

45
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,708
before you pointed her out?

46
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:20,541
--Well, see...
--Keep your distance, everyone!

47
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:23,125
Bad customs spread like plague.

48
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,916
Bad customs?

49
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,583
Right! Meet-and-greet's
over, people...!

50
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:32,000
And big brother wants
a word with you two!

51
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,291
Hey, hey! Welcome!

52
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:48,875
Good to see you both...
Please excuse the mess...

53
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,416
Here.

54
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,791
Let's you and me have a
little pow-wow, tiger...

55
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,791
Just one reckless
romantic to another, huh?

56
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,541
Wait, you...?

57
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:05,541
So now what?

58
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,875
That person doesn't like Nessa.

59
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,416
--Huh?
--Because if he did,

60
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,708
he'd be able to touch Nessa
like the rest of his friends!

61
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:13,708
Seriously?

62
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,416
Nessa chooses to
stay with Enri...

63
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,500
Excuse me?!

64
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,000
Come on, let's hunt treasure!

65
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,625
Show Nessa where you
found the teddy bear!

66
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:21,791
That wasn't treasure!

67
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:24,000
We just used that stupid
thing to bait you!

68
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,041
Race ya!

69
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,166
Like hell you will!

70
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,500
They're all crazy.

71
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,750
Alright, kiddo...

72
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,916
So we're back to that, are we?

73
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,791
You ever heard of
The Lost Millennium?

74
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,041
What?

75
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,791
The thousand years
before Fractale...

76
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,166
The era when we
all lost our way...

77
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,166
When the human race sold its
independence up the river...

78
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,375
All for some naive
idea of luxury.

79
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:56,000
Oh, great. A lecture.

80
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,750
Well, there are some of us
who decided to adopt

81
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:01,291
that dark era's name and take
up arms, to oppose Fractale.

82
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,375
Sure, we Granites are just
a drop in the bucket,

83
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,208
but a sizeable faction
all the same...

84
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,291
Not something to sneeze at,
if you know your stuff.

85
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,166
Oh man. Lost Millennium.

86
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,541
I'm being held hostage by a
ragtag group of terrorists.

87
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,291
Drink your coffee
'fore it gets cold.

88
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,833
Yeah, 'kay...

89
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,166
It's not every day you get
treated to something

90
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,958
made the old fashioned way.

91
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:27,333
This village produces
by hand every single thing

92
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:30,041
it consumes... We don't
rely on dopples...

93
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:33,708
We teach our children
using--wait for it--books,

94
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:35,541
so their heads are filled
with actual knowledge

95
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:38,875
instead of just empty
terabytes of data.

96
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:40,208
And each of us who
calls this place home

97
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:41,833
has had their Fractale
Terminal removed

98
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,916
to make room for more
important things.

99
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,583
C'mon. You're pulling my leg.

100
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:49,250
Not at all... What choice does
a person have if he intends

101
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:53,250
to live as he was
meant to... As a human!

102
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,208
Whoa! You have a dishtowel?

103
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,500
With just a little
bit of patience,

104
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,625
the problem will rectify itself.

105
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,125
You're just going to air dry?

106
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,750
My point is that Fractale is
on the brink of collapse...

107
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,666
The fact balloons keep
falling out of the sky

108
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,333
is proof enough of that.

109
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,166
The powers-that-be
can rail to the contrary

110
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,750
all they like,
it doesn't matter!

111
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,208
The Temple will
preach about Freedom

112
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,291
as long as it has
the breath to lie...!

113
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:17,625
The Lost Millennium sees
through their masquerade!

114
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:20,250
I'm sorry, I really have no idea
what you're talking about,

115
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:23,166
but could you just tell me what
you guys want with Phryne?

116
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,166
You mean the temptress you
got all lovey-dovey with?

117
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,666
Uh... She... I...!

118
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,375
She's the key to
the world, my friend...

119
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:32,291
A priestess of the Temple
with a very harsh fate.

120
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,416
Okay, still not following you.

121
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,583
Look, kiddo, all you need to
know right now is this...

122
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,916
The girl stole a dopple
from the higher ups.

123
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,458
You're not telling me she
made off with Nessa...?

124
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,291
She risked life and limb
to smuggle her out...

125
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,000
Which translates as
pretty damn important!

126
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,750
So it's just as I thought...

127
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,625
Your run-of-the-mill dopple
wouldn't warrant that effort

128
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,791
unless it contained
sensitive information...!

129
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:54,625
Information capable of bringing
the Temple down to its knees!

130
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,458
You're gonna use
Nessa as a pawn...

131
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:07,208
I'd consider my situation
before I got too uppity...

132
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:10,875
After all... You are gonna
be here for a while.

133
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:16,500
You walk so fast, Enri...!
Nessa doesn't see the point

134
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,708
for us to be in such
a big, fat rush.

135
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,250
Gah! Then stop following me!

136
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:28,875
Oh wow! Is this where
you guys live?!

137
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,958
No. It's just our mother ship.

138
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:34,041
Nessa bets where there's a ship
there's all kinds of treasure!

139
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,916
Go back to your stupid
friend already.

140
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,708
You're driving me up
a wall...! Geez...

141
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,583
Ugh! Man! Since
when does a dopple

142
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,208
have to be so damn chummy?

143
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,916
Hello!

144
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,625
Stupid...

145
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,416
Condition check complete...

146
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,416
Your condition today,
according--

147
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,458
Someone's had more sugar
than she should have!

148
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,416
Oh! You wanted privacy
to use the bathroom...

149
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,666
Just remember to wipe your
bottom when you're done, okay?

150
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:11,333
Hey! It's dark in here...

151
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:18,416
Fine mess I've gotten myself
into. Really fantastic.

152
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,125
No!

153
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,916
Nurse, this man
needs a sedative...

154
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,625
Right.

155
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,125
Not that it's any
of my business...

156
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,416
but is this place some
kind of hospital?

157
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,500
Sort of. We have
inpatient facilities,

158
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,666
but there aren't really
enough beds to go around...

159
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,375
We can't do much here
beyond simple first aid.

160
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,541
I've never seen so many
people in need of care

161
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,791
gathered under one
roof like this.

162
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:48,416
Well, if these folks had the
luxury of Fractale access,

163
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,250
they'd be welcome to a hospital
of their choice, more or less.

164
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,166
But this village is
a different story.

165
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,875
Why remove their terminals
if this is the price?!

166
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,125
It may not be pleasant,

167
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,666
but that's the price of
fighting the good fight.

168
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,541
The sooner you understand
that no amenity

169
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,500
is worth giving up
your freedom...

170
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,166
The closer you'll be
to a real person.

171
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,583
But this...

172
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:12,250
No point arguing if you
don't understand the issue.

173
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,875
My damn knees are giving
me trouble again.

174
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,166
I'm so sorry... The wait
today is a fairly long one.

175
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,833
There you are, Clain!

176
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,666
Nessa can tell you what
color underwear...

177
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,833
Ahhhhhh!

178
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,708
A real person.

179
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:34,250
What makes you think
I want to know?

180
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,000
Her underwear
doesn't interest me.

181
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,250
Gah! Just blurt it out,
why don't you...?!

182
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:41,208
Like I wanted you to be
interested anyway!

183
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,458
What's wrong with him?

184
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:49,333
Alrighty...! Let's Drink!!...!

185
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:53,125
No, wait'fore that... Everybody,
visors...! Chop chop.

186
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,583
That is one impressive dopple.

187
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:05,875
Right...! Time for a toast...!
Here's to our esteemed hostages!

188
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,041
Darling!

189
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,791
We're definitely blessed.

190
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,291
You're so quiet...
Are you sad?

191
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:23,458
These people just confuse me...
That's all, I guess.

192
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:26,166
They've built their entire
lives around a crazy idea...

193
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,583
And they look like good people,

194
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,625
but I don't feel like
I can trust them...

195
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,666
Here you go.

196
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,458
And this is... what?

197
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,666
Smellie grass and bean soup.

198
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Go on! Gulp it down!

199
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:47,375
It's not out of a tube,
but oh well...

200
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,875
This is weird!

201
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:57,833
It's such a complicated flavor.
Get out of here...!

202
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:00,458
First it's all sweet...
then it's salty...

203
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:03,791
Ugh! Come on, just
tell us if you like it!

204
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:07,375
Yeah, no... It's amazing.

205
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:08,958
Excellent... Thanks!

206
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:12,125
Help yourself to more.

207
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,958
What's the matter?

208
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:17,541
Beans not agree with
your tummy, sweetheart?

209
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,083
Think about it, Granny...

210
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:22,041
She doesn't have a tummy,
so she can't even eat it.

211
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:25,458
Oh... Quite right, dear...
I'm so sorry.

212
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,500
This is gonna be your bedroom
for the next few days.

213
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,791
Just do us a favor and
don't make too much noise.

214
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,833
I told you before...!

215
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,416
Why the heck is there
only one bed...?

216
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,458
Do these people really
think a guy my age

217
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:50,958
wants to mess around with
a kid like Nessa? Gross.

218
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,750
What's your problem?

219
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,750
Nessa wants you to tell her what
the bean soup thing was like.

220
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,916
Well, it was very tasty...

221
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,291
It was sweet and salty
kind of at the same time.

222
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,166
I need more details than that!

223
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,708
Mmm... I guess the
beans were pretty soft,

224
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,125
but beyond that, I can't think
how best to describe it.

225
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:12,250
There might've been a hint of
bitterness in there somewhere...

226
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,583
Nessa doesn't understand!

227
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,708
You should express the taste
through the power of dance!

228
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:20,291
Uh, how's that
gonna help at all?

229
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,291
Nessa can't understand
words about food

230
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,333
because she doesn't eat food.

231
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:25,375
Oh. I'm sorry...

232
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,041
So the only way
for her to get it

233
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,708
is to sort of make it go
with something else.

234
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:33,916
Okay fine, then.

235
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,958
Maybe it was a little something
like this...? I dunno...

236
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:38,708
Bean soup tastes like
sneaking around in the dark?

237
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,291
No, wait! It was
more like this...!

238
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,875
Kind of starts up here like
this, and then, whoa Nelly...!

239
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,750
Bean soup tastes like
being overjoyed...?

240
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,625
Tell Nessa what the
pancakes were like!

241
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,125
I think they were more
down here like this.

242
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:52,958
Hooray! Pancakes are like
slinking around in the mud!

243
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,791
The lovebirds are
getting lively...

244
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:01,875
You ask me, the lovebirds are
gettin' downright weird.

245
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:21,708
What's the matter, Clain,
did you have a bad dream?

246
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,250
Are you getting ready
for some kind of party?

247
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,666
You could say that.

248
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,208
We just got word they're holding
a Star Festival tonight.

249
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,583
What?

250
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,833
Temple must be getting
anxious to bump up the date.

251
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,583
You mean one of those ceremonies
where the Temple priestesses

252
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,458
gather everyone together
to pray and stuff?

253
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,375
Butcher! Get the
lead out, man...!

254
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,625
In case no one's told you,
the site's three whole sectors

255
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,875
to the west, 'less you
know a faster route?

256
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:48,291
Sorry, sir!

257
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:49,916
Exactly what are you cooking up?

258
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,375
Heh... What do you think,
kid...? The Granite clan

259
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,541
is going to gate crash
themselves a Star Festival.

260
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,208
Huh?!

261
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,625
Best suit up, tiger.

262
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,333
Hold on!

263
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:04,166
Nessa can't wait...!
A Star Festival...!

264
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,416
The Lost Millennium isn't a
travel agency, gingersnap!

265
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,125
You park your butt here!

266
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,916
No!

267
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:34,458
No way...! Their ship is
a goldmine of antiques!

268
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:39,166
This is the coolest thing ever!

269
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,333
Alright! Reality check, people;

270
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,083
we're about to put our
heads in the lion's mouth

271
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,875
and some of us may not
be coming back...!

272
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:45,958
Is that understood!

273
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,125
Yes sir!

274
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,333
Ugh, give me a break...

275
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:49,875
You make it sound like
we're going to war.

276
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:52,875
You have no idea what
you're in for, do you?

277
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,916
Well hey, they say
ignorance is bliss...

278
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
The Fractale Terminals
are good for one thing...

279
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:58,625
letting idiots stay blissful.

280
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,833
Heh... And with all
the womanizing you do,

281
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,625
it's a wonder you
can think at all!

282
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,583
If you don't stop
taking shots at me,

283
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,083
I'm gonna plant
my foot in your--

284
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:09,416
Get this strait, big guy:
Clain is as sweet as they come!

285
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:15,000
What the...?! I thought we
left her back at the village!

286
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,708
Uh-huh. I had a feeling
we'd run into this.

287
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:20,125
She's pure data,
an abstract concept...

288
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:23,500
meaning Little Miss Sunshine
can go where she pleases.

289
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,875
Nessa isn't only data.

290
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,333
That's how she got
in the bathroom...

291
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:28,541
Bathroom?

292
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,375
You stop eavesdropping!

293
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,333
Comin' in for a landing.

294
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,375
What is a Star Festival,
you think?

295
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,958
Eh...? That question is
for our youngest recruit.

296
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,000
Give me a break,
everyone knows that.

297
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,666
At the new moon,
a bunch of stars--

298
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,416
well, balloons, actually--
cluster in the sky,

299
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,208
and Temple priestesses
pray to them.

300
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:49,458
It's how people "guarantee
divine protection"

301
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,541
for themselves for
the upcoming phase.

302
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,541
Refuse to participate
and all kinds of stuff

303
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,291
starts going haywire on you...

304
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,000
Even folks who aren't
really all that religious

305
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,416
take part just to keep
their dopples up to date.

306
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,041
I'd give that answer a D.

307
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,250
Ever wonder why people
toe the line even though

308
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:07,125
the festival can't satisfy
secular needs anymore?

309
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,416
Captain, if we get any
closer we might as well

310
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,208
send the priestess
a gift basket.

311
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,500
Good, good.
Bring 'er down, then.

312
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:21,875
Wowie! There's so
many people here!

313
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,166
'Kay, if I just pick my moment,
maybe I can get somebody

314
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,291
to rescue me from
these head-cases...

315
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:30,791
Put these on before the festival

316
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:34,041
or the so-called stars
will get you, too.

317
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:37,375
Wait. What do you
mean they'll "get me"?

318
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,291
Alright. It's show time.

319
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,583
What's about to happen?

320
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,541
Look up to the stars...
Give them your prayers...

321
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:05,500
Be at peace...
Bask in abundance...

322
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:09,166
You will be received
into heaven's breast...

323
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,500
There you shall know love...

324
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:16,083
Look up to the stars...
Give them your prayers...

325
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:19,916
Be at peace...
Bask in abundance...

326
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,125
You will be received...

327
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,208
What's going on? What's
wrong with everyone?

328
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:25,666
The stars... See how
they're pulsing?

329
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,291
Yeah...

330
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,458
This isn't some quaint
religious rite...

331
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:33,041
It's the Temple's pretext
for updating the nano-stream.

332
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,666
What does that mean?

333
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,125
It's brainwashing.

334
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:37,583
Brainwashing?!

335
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,750
Leave people to their own
thoughts and sooner or later

336
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,291
they start questioning
the powers that be...

337
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:43,708
If you're in a
position of power,

338
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,875
the last thing you want folks
to ask is whether or not

339
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,500
the way things are is the
way they have to be...

340
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:51,291
People start wondering why
they rely on dopples so much;

341
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:54,166
why families don't live
under one roof anymore...

342
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,666
But hey... hook everyone
up to a nano-stream

343
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,458
and a simple update erases
all that pesky "thinking"...

344
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,958
People go right on accepting
life as they've always known it

345
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,166
because they've been sapped
of all incentive to doubt.

346
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,375
But... people...

347
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,833
Open up your damn eyes
and take a look around...!

348
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,166
Do they look like
people to you?!

349
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,125
Fractale's made them husks
of what they could've been!

350
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:17,083
Move out!

351
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,166
Just stay out of the way.

352
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:31,875
You filthy, lying hags!
Die already!

353
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,208
No!

354
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,291
What?!

355
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,125
It's another me!

356
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,708
Hey!!

357
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,291
What the hell are you doing?!

358
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:56,000
Vile, treacherous turncoats who
defile our sacred ceremony...

359
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,375
You shall be judged...

360
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,333
By the heavens.

361
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:03,791
Nessa!

362
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,541
Wait! Come back here!

363
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,125
Butcher!!

364
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,416
Damn you all!!

365
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:31,250
Oh my god...
This isn't happening!

366
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:32,791
This isn't happening!

367
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:43,000
Look up to the stars...
Give them your prayers...

368
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:46,208
Be at peace...
Bask in abundance...

369
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:49,666
Look up to the stars...
Give them your prayers...

370
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:54,041
Be at peace...
Bask in abundance.

371
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:57,125
You will be received
into heaven's breast...

372
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,541
Is that Phryne?

373
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,500
Pray for the departed...

374
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:04,625
Usher them to the stars'
greatest reward...

375
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:08,500
Let those left behind
shelter in earthly plenty.

376
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,708
Welcome back, my sister...
The stars are glad.

377
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:42,083
<i>Down by the salley gardens</i>
<i>my love and I did meet</i>

378
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:55,958
<i>She passed the salley gardens</i>
<i>with little snow-white feet</i>

379
00:21:56,041 --> 00:22:10,000
<i>She bid me take love easy,</i>
<i>as the leaves grow on the tree</i>

380
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:23,958
<i>But I, being young and foolish,</i>
<i>with her did not agree</i>

381
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:47,916
<i>But I was young and foolish,</i>
<i>and now I am full of tears</i>

382
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,916
<i>But I was young and foolish,</i>
<i>and now I am full of tears</i>
