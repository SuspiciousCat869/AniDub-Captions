1
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:36,375
So, I suppose we ought to expect
you home late again today?

2
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:38,625
Sweetie, big boys
don't prop their chins

3
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:39,958
on their hands like that.

4
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:42,375
"Flea market" doesn't
sound very reputable.

5
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:44,208
Sure it's someplace
you ought to be?

6
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:46,375
Trust me, it's fine.

7
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:48,583
The boy gets his
curiosity from your side.

8
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:51,291
Those itchy feet of
yours give him ideas.

9
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:54,291
Oh, I got the wanderlust out
of my system a while back.

10
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:57,208
Retired. Settled down in
Luimnigh five years ago now.

11
00:00:57,291 --> 00:01:01,166
Really? I live in Vale!
We're practically neighbors!

12
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:05,416
'kay. See ya.

13
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,875
Oh, have fun.

14
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:08,916
Just make sure you're home
in time for dinner, alright?

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,291
Remember: it's important
for us to be together

16
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:13,500
as a family at mealtimes.

17
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:15,333
I'll be home in time.

18
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:23,291
Whoa-ho...!

19
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:36,833
Neat way of putting it,
but kind of weird.

20
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:40,958
"Wishing"? Prayers are what
they're usually called.

21
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:43,666
Which makes sense, 'cause
what's there to wish for?

22
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,166
I mean, how crazy would
that be to actually

23
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,708
have to ask the Day Star
for something...?

24
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:50,666
I'd feel so stupid...

25
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:54,291
Hello!

26
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:57,375
"Illuminate all we
forgot." Whatever.

27
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:04,833
More people here than
I thought there'd be.

28
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:07,208
Mm hmm.

29
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:11,000
Whoa! This place
is a gold mine...!

30
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:13,250
You see anything
compatible with my stuff?

31
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,041
Ah yes, here we go...

32
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,583
Just the right size.

33
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:19,583
Oh, man. I've already burned
through my donay for the month.

34
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:20,458
You need a handout?

35
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,291
Nah, just window shopping.

36
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,208
So? Let papa have
a look! What gen is it?

37
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,500
Hey, don't get all shadow on me.

38
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:29,083
Kid, forget the antiques-
try this stuff out.

39
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:30,125
Try what out?

40
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,083
Don't tell me you're
in the dark?

41
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:35,041
That's a data drug!

42
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:38,083
Yeah, and word is it'll
make your mind explode.

43
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:39,208
You should give it whirl!

44
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,166
I'll pass if it's
all the same to you.

45
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,291
Freeze!

46
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,291
Everybody stay right
where you are.

47
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:52,916
Fantastic. Ninety-five percent
of the suspects were dopples.

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,666
Pay dirt. Step on it!

49
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,791
Ah! There it is...

50
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,625
Fractale is a trillion-machine
cyber network designed at the

51
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:33,666
absolute cutting edge of
22nd century technology...

52
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,333
Well, not as nifty
as an old-school

53
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,958
scratch track download,
I guess, but still.

54
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,208
...their data can be downloaded
at regular intervals

55
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,541
by the Sky High Hovering Server.

56
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,166
A basic income is then allotted

57
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,375
to all participants
in perpetuity.

58
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:49,416
This system creates a world
where everyone's financial means

59
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,791
are met regardless of
their ability to work.

60
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:54,708
Consequently, a world
free of poverty and war.

61
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:57,458
Indeed, it's no overstatement
to call Fractale

62
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:02,083
the godlike manifestation of
humanity's oldest dream.

63
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,000
So this thing was patched
about the time Fractale

64
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:07,583
first came into existence.
Not a bad accidental find.

65
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:09,541
The world this old
info-track is talking about

66
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,458
has been present-tense
for a while now.

67
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:15,000
And it's right. Life is
pretty sweet. Mostly.

68
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,041
People get by well when
they don't have to bother

69
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,166
interacting with each
other in the flesh.

70
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,250
Sometimes it's
boring, sure, but...

71
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,916
it's not like the alterative
wasn't given a shot...

72
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,791
Time for the five
o'clock prayer...

73
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:33,166
Based on your current location,
the direction of the temple is

74
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:37,458
approximately ten degrees to the
right of where you are facing.

75
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,583
And now, let us pray together.

76
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,875
I guess if this is the most
we've got to put up with,

77
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,000
things could be worse.

78
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,250
Remain calm and
refrain from blinking.

79
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,166
The heck is that?

80
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,458
Am I seeing things?

81
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,500
It's a girl!

82
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,625
She's in trouble!

83
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:40,875
This looks serious...

84
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:10,833
I know it sounds crazy... But...

85
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:14,541
Well... for a second there...

86
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,291
Just for a second...

87
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:21,000
It wouldn't have surprised
me to see her fly.

88
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:11,041
Guess they're giving
up the search. Good.

89
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,375
There she is.

90
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,000
Now what?

91
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,250
Off to a great start.

92
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:44,166
Hey, um... Are you like...
okay, or what?

93
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,666
Well... At least
she's breathing...

94
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,875
If she really is
a "she," that is.

95
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,083
Uh, oh!

96
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,750
Er, I, uh...

97
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:27,291
You really shouldn't try to move
till we, uh, know how badly...

98
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:32,333
Oh... Suppose I should say hi.

99
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,916
Um... Nice... night?

100
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,500
Uh... You know, you're right.

101
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,666
The day star's already headed
down, so I guess it is night.

102
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,041
I guess so.

103
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,541
I'll just go and find something
to patch you up with

104
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,583
before it gets any worse...

105
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,791
I... uh...

106
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:57,541
Welcome home, son.

107
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,916
Find anything exciting
at the flea market?

108
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,250
Got a bit more than I
bargained for, actually.

109
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,750
What is it, Jackie?

110
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,750
Not to shrug you guys
off or anything, but...

111
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:10,208
I was sorta hoping you could
give me the night to myself?

112
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:11,916
I just need some time
alone, you know...

113
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,625
What's gotten into
you all of sudden?

114
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:17,083
Well, I suppose we could if
it's alright with your father.

115
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:20,000
Uh, as long as you
don't stay up too late.

116
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,625
Good night, then.

117
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,291
Okay, the coast is clear.
You can come in.

118
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,333
You're very kind. Thanks.

119
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:28,625
You really think
you're okay enough

120
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,041
not to have to go to
the hospital or anything?

121
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:33,208
I forgot! There was one
thing I wanted to-- Clain!

122
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:34,916
And who is this young lady?

123
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,041
No one, just, uh...

124
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,208
My name is Phryne.

125
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:38,333
Don't start a conversation!

126
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:39,875
Oh dear, the poor thing's hurt!

127
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,416
No, no! It's fine.
Believe me. It's--

128
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,416
Look. I'll explain later, okay?!

129
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,083
Hold on just a minute--

130
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,333
Well, they seem very pleasant.

131
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,125
Do those dopples belong
to your parents?

132
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:49,666
That's right...
And the little yapper

133
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,750
who broke our cover was Jackie.

134
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:54,458
You didn't have to do that
just for me, you know...

135
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,625
Make your family
disappear, I mean.

136
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,250
That's kind of a dramatic
way of putting it,

137
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,500
I mean c'mon,
they're just dopples...

138
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:01,500
Sure, if you say so.

139
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:02,916
Oh yeah, let's get you fixed up.

140
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,708
Let's see. First aid kit...

141
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,500
It's not much, but it ought
to take care of the scratches.

142
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,083
I should be able to tend
to my wounds on my own

143
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,583
if you don't mind giving
me a little bit of privacy.

144
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:20,000
Not to impose, of course.

145
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,500
Sure, not a problem at all,

146
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,333
I'll just bury my head upstairs
while you do your thing...

147
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:27,416
You won't even know
I'm here. So, uh, yeah.

148
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:40,041
What a weird girl.

149
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,083
Weird, but...

150
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,875
Well I guess she's
kind of nice, actually.

151
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,125
Um... Sorry to trouble you...

152
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,666
I believe I may need
your help after all.

153
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,125
Fine! No problem!
What'd ya need?

154
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,416
You will have to
look at me first.

155
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,625
You really don't mind?

156
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,666
I can't explain otherwise.

157
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,541
I tried to reach here...
But, I'm too stiff...

158
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,291
So, if you'd be so kind...

159
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:14,166
You sure you...
don't need a hospital?

160
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:26,416
This is wonderful...
I'm absolutely charmed.

161
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,000
These objects wear an
aura of history and care

162
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,666
I find quite delightful.

163
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,666
It's really magnificent.

164
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,916
Did I hear you right when you
said your name was Phryne?

165
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,166
Uh huh.

166
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,083
So, not that it's any of
my business or anything,

167
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,291
but who are you exactly?

168
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:43,416
I mean, why are
people chasing you?

169
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,291
I'd rather not say.

170
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:50,416
Like I told you, it's none
of my business anyway.

171
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:53,541
I'm going to say
this one more time:

172
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,583
are you sure you don't
need a hospital?

173
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,250
I'm so tired.

174
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,916
Huh?

175
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,583
Pardon me, but...

176
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,625
That's right.
Look at daddy, Clain.

177
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:33,916
You startled me...
Did you sleep okay?

178
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,333
What's this?

179
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,291
It's just a video file of
when I was a little baby.

180
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:40,125
Those are my parents. I mean,
you know, the real ones.

181
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,875
I owe you an apology
for implying

182
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,375
your family wasn't
important to you.

183
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,000
Clearly I misjudged
your feelings

184
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,875
if you're sentimental
over something like this.

185
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,958
I don't know if I'd call
myself sentimental...

186
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:54,208
Video data in this format is
crazy hard to come by these days

187
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,333
and I have kind of a thing for
collecting old stuff, so I--

188
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,166
But my parents are cool...

189
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,666
It's different.

190
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,916
Your smile held a
different aura then...

191
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,791
Your face no longer
accommodates such joy.

192
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:13,458
Aw c'mon, I smile plenty,
my face is just more grown.

193
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:14,791
You misunderstand me!

194
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:17,125
I demand that you smile as
you do in this video...!

195
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,541
Like... like this, perhaps...

196
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,791
Is this what you mean?

197
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,375
You have a silly face.

198
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:30,750
Thanks, I guess... Have
you looked in a mirror?

199
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:34,500
Now I'm satisfied
that baby was you.

200
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:40,541

00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,958
I offer a wish on your behalf...
One that I hope...

203
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,125
Oh wait, I need to
know your name first.

204
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,333
It's Clain.

205
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:49,958

My amulet...! Of course!

210
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,125
Here.

211
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,500
What is that?

212
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:14,041
This amulet has always been
the source of my smile,

213
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,583
so keep it close
and from now on

214
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,250
maybe it can be the
source of yours too.

215
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,875
Good evening. We're from
a local medical agency.

216
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,833
We've come to take the
injured woman into custody.

217
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,666
You don't mean like
the hospital, do you?

218
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,166
'Cause I haven't actually
called anyone about it...

219
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,666
Well, that's because
Fractale alerted us

220
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,666
to the woman's condition,
which according to the database

221
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,708
is bad enough to
need an ambulance.

222
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,291
You really expect me to believe
that's an ambulance?

223
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:41,791
Are you calling me a liar...?!

224
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,500
You see that little
red blinky thing?!

225
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:46,041
How much more legit
you want us to look?!

226
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,500
Hey! Don't be a smartass!

227
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:48,625
If we tell you it's
an ambulance,

228
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:51,375
it's a freaking ambulance,
okay punk?!

229
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:55,000
Bad news, Phryne. I think
those guys know you're here.

230
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,250
So that was them, then?

231
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,333
The good news is I think
you still might be okay.

232
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,250
They don't exactly strike
me as brains, this bunch.

233
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,916
There's something
I have to tell you.

234
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,125
Here they come again.
You sit tight, I'll handle them.

235
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,666
I'm traveling with my sick
brothers and we really need

236
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,375
a place to stay for the night
if you'd be so kind.

237
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,375
Uh...

238
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:18,750
Well, I'll give 'em one thing:
they're pretty persistent.

239
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:19,916
Clain, I really should...

240
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,041
Ugh. Oh, come on!

241
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,833
Hello. We're from Security
and we're looking

242
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:27,625
for a suspicious female
whose data can't be tracked.

243
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,916
Okay, apart from the hat
you borrowed from your buddy,

244
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,583
you look exactly the same.

245
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,791
Well excuse us for not
rolling in enough donay

246
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,125
to buy a more convincing
costume, Mr. Detective!

247
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,583
Your finances aren't really
the issue here, so...

248
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,750
I only wanna hear one
thing out of you...!

249
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,583
Where have you got her
squirreled away?!

250
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,250
I don't know what you're--

251
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,250
What gives you lug
heads the right...?!

252
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,791
Upstairs!

253
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,208
Look, you can't just barge
into someone's home!

254
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:56,750
Ahhh!!

255
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,500
You pervert!

256
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,000
We caught you in
the middle of doing

257
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,291
something you
shouldn't have!

258
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,125
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

259
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,250
Don't try to play innocent!

260
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,750
Ignore the act, ma'am!

261
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,333
This little creep is making
all stupid so you'll have to

262
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,166
fill in the blanks yourself
and end up saying something

263
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,916
super embarrassing
and un-ladylike!

264
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,416
Ew, gross...! Sanitize!

265
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,291
Yes ma'am!

266
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:21,958
You better not be making a mess!

267
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,541
Are you checking the bathroom?

268
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,208
You wouldn't believe the things
he's got lying around in here!

269
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,875
Get out of my stuff!

270
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,916
What's the big idea making
us think she's here?!

271
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,791
Hmph. Let's go before
we waste any more time.

272
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,250
Yeah. Big bro'll
be waiting for us.

273
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,583
Wait... Hold on a sec.

274
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,416
Having trouble with
the clutch again?

275
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,083
Not exactly...

276
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,833
Whoa. Okay...

277
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,375
There you are.

278
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:05,375
Do you think they'll mind
that I borrowed this?

279
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,416
That is really cool.

280
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,333
It's just a little farther.

281
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,791
This is the one place where
radio waves don't reach...

282
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,750
No one'll be able to
find you up here.

283
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:25,291
It's the ruins of an old
chapel I found a while back.

284
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,125
Not sure how old
they are, though.

285
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:30,666
I kind of consider them my
secret hideout, or whatever.

286
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,083
You have a very fascinating
perspective on things.

287
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,666
Yeah?

288
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,875
I've often heard that the people
living in this era romanticize

289
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,875
the idea of personal freedom
until it defines them...

290
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,208
They won't be tied down...
Not for anything.

291
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,916
What do you mean "people
living in this era?"

292
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,375
If you don't want to say...

293
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:53,750
I guess it's only natural you'd
be curious about who I am...

294
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,791
I mean, that is a priestess
outfit you've got on, right?

295
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,250
On second thought, never mind.

296
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:02,625
You aren't curious?

297
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,583
Hey, when you want me to...
I'll be all ears.

298
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,833
Nights get pretty
chilly up here.

299
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:17,416
This ought to generate enough
warmth to keep us from freezing.

300
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,416
You say so.

301
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,125
The moon is so bright.

302
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:22,666
Yeah?

303
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:27,125
From where I used to live,
I'd gaze up at it every night.

304
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,541
Of all the lights in the sky,

305
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,833
hers was the only one that
made me feel at peace...

306
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:34,083
No matter what I was
going through at the time,

307
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:37,416
I'd only ever feel her
gazing down on me with love.

308
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,541
I know he'll look after you.

309
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:04,708
Huh...?

310
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,708
Phryne? Where'd you go?

311
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,833
That's gratitude for you.

312
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:28,708
Just like that, she might as
well have never been here.

313
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:32,208
Well, it's the same with
everybody--why not her?

314
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,291
I mean, really...

315
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:36,833
I don't even know why
I'm so ticked about it.

316
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,291
Wait a minute!

317
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:51,625
♪ I look up to the sky... ♪

318
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:55,791
♪ And offer my wish
to the day star... ♪

319
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:59,333
♪ Bidding farewell
to the night... ♪

320
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:03,250
♪ that hides from us
what we once were... ♪

321
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:08,208
The amulet's got some sort
of data embedded on it...

322
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,833
Old data...

323
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,750
The heck is this thing?

324
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,500
Ta-da!

325
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:47,083
<i>Down by the salley gardens</i>
<i>my love and I did meet</i>

326
00:21:47,166 --> 00:22:01,000
<i>She passed the salley gardens</i>
<i>with little snow-white feet</i>

327
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:15,000
<i>She bid me take love easy,</i>
<i>as the leaves grow on the tree</i>

328
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:28,958
<i>But I, being young and foolish,</i>
<i>with her did not agree</i>

329
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:52,916
<i>But I was young and foolish,</i>
<i>and now I am full of tears</i>

330
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,916
<i>But I was young and foolish,</i>
<i>and now I am full of tears</i>
