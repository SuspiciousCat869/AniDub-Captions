1
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,958
Damn it! You'd think
after all the years

2
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:34,666
of peace and prosperity
these Temple bastards'd be

3
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,708
a little softer in a dog fight!

4
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:38,375
Sunda!

5
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:46,083
It's alright...!
Nessa knows Clain can do it!

6
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:47,833
I'm not cut out for this!

7
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,250
What?

8
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:01,208
Damn it!
What are you doing?!

9
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:03,250
It's Phryne...! She ran
away to the Temple

10
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:05,125
to try and talk it
out with them!

11
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:58,000
Greetings. I've been
waiting for you... my dear.

12
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:01,083
A Beloved Maiden
true to her title.

13
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,291
This will be a private
discussion, Barrot.

14
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:04,291
But, I...

15
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:06,500
Remove yourself.

16
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,125
Surely she doesn't think all
this can be solved with talk?

17
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,916
How friggin' naïve can she
possibly be...?! I knew her head

18
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,333
was a rat's nest of stupid,
but this takes the cake!

19
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:26,375
Naïve or not,
she's doing it for us!

20
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,208
She's only there to try
and convince the Temple

21
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,958
not to massacre
the whole battalion!

22
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:33,375
They're coming at us
from the sea!

23
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,791
Enough of this BS...
Turn us around, now!

24
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,250
Come on!

25
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,958
Can you not see what's
right in front of you...?!

26
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,875
This is crazy...! Wake up!
You can't just--

27
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,333
Clain!

28
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,916
C'mon, man...
On your feet.

29
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,916
To hell with this... I knew you
were murderers... But cowards?

30
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,291
Clain...

31
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,291
You were my first
real friends...

32
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:04,416
The closet thing Phryne's
ever had to a family...

33
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,708
Think about it: She's done
what's she done to save you.

34
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,166
She believes in you guys...

35
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,083
We can't just let her face
the Temple herself...!

36
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:14,833
If you're intent on turning
around, then I want off!

37
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:18,208
So... The hen has gone
home to roost, has she?

38
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:22,208
I'm a shameless eavesdropper.
You'll have to forgive me.

39
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:23,791
Dias...

40
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:26,083
If your hothead there wants to
help his friend make her case...

41
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,750
Then in the interest of building
peace between us and the Temple,

42
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,416
I'm happy to act as liaison.

43
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,666
Yeah, right.

44
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,041
You've been chomping at
the bit to wipe 'em out!

45
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,333
I have... But that's hard to
stop once you've begun,

46
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:39,416
so this may be our only chance
to avoid more bloodshed.

47
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,708
Don't you think...?
And besides...

48
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,375
When else would
we make our case?

49
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:45,791
Thank you, sir.

50
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:48,625
Come on... What are you
really playing at here, Dias?

51
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:53,958
Heh... At love... The one
thing that can save us all.

52
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,791
Is that not the unifying factor

53
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,833
behind every
sacrifice we've made?

54
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,791
Nessa's going!

55
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,083
Like hell...! We can't
just let the Temple

56
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,541
have both halves of the key!

57
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,083
Tell her!

58
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:12,083
She's right. We talked
about this. You need to stay.

59
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,541
The whole world could be in
jeopardy if they get you...

60
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:17,833
Phryne wouldn't want that
to happen and you know it.

61
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:20,333
Please, Nessa. For her.

62
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,625
Alright, then... Get one of
the smaller ships ready.

63
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,666
I'm not letting Clain
go in there by himself.

64
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,083
Seriously?!

65
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,875
Don't get me wrong. I know
you're up to something...

66
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:33,166
But we share a mutual
interest, so I'm going.

67
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,958
Whatever gets you there.

68
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,166
Phryne...

69
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:49,166
Step closer to me...
I wish to see you face better.

70
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,791
This fighting is pointless...
I want you to call off

71
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:57,166
your attack on the Lost
Millennium. Immediately.

72
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,458
Oh, Phryne... Despite
what you may think,

73
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:02,125
I have wished harm upon
no one through all this...

74
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:06,666
naive, perhaps; and obviously
not a sentiment shared by you.

75
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,375
But... I am willing to forgive
your youthful selfishness...

76
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:13,333
Because you've come here to
atone... haven't you, dear...?

77
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,791
To comport yourself as a
Beloved Maiden should...

78
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,000
To restore order...

79
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,250
And bestow upon the
world the hope it needs?

80
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,291
I will embrace my life
here at the Temple...

81
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,541
And quietly accept my fate...

82
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,875
But I ask you to release Nessa
of her duties... She's a child--

83
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,708
Out of the question, I fear...
You know that Fractale

84
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,666
cannot be salvaged
from its decayed state

85
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,333
unless you both play
an equal part in this.

86
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,375
Spare her...!
Or I will not spare myself.

87
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:40,375
You wouldn't.

88
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:42,625
I swear to you, I would...

89
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:45,958
I am no longer the girl
this Temple raised!

90
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,000
I know what I'm capable of...

91
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:57,875
and what I am prepared to
protect at any cost!

92
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:00,916
You've no idea what
you're capable of...

93
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,250
Unless you and Nessa fulfill
your roles as Fractale's key,

94
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,291
what you're trying
to protect will perish,

95
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,166
even if the fighting
is stopped...

96
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,916
A world without
Fractale is a world

97
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,291
in which human beings
cannot survive...

98
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:15,416
These friends you love are
not exceptions to this rule,

99
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,333
however they might wish to be.

100
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,583
Stay sharp! Keep 'em
off our engines

101
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,333
with every bullet you
got if you have to!

102
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:25,791
Yes sir!

103
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,833
Ha! Look who's found some
balls all of a sudden...!

104
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,791
You've changed quite
a bit, my friend.

105
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:32,791
I don't know that I've changed
all that much, really...

106
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,791
I'm just tired of standing
around like a kid...

107
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,708
I wanna do something meaningful.

108
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,833
Spoken like a true
L.M-er, Clain...

109
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,416
If more people
embraced that idea,

110
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,458
the system would've bowed down
to the resistance years ago.

111
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:46,541
I'm not all that interested in
overthrowing the system.

112
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,416
Speaking of change, though,
I gotta admit, Sunda...

113
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,458
I'm surprised you
agreed to come.

114
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm the one who ordered you to
protect Phryne and Nessa...

115
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,666
It's my responsibility
to see this through.

116
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,875
Hey, keep those
eyes on the engine.

117
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:09,875
There it is!

118
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,208
The Temple!

119
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,166
Sunda!

120
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:26,875
Oh, wow...

121
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,458
Coming in!

122
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:38,250
Be honest. You're perfectly
aware of how things stand.

123
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,375
Without Fractale,
people can no longer

124
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,750
even form a cogent thought...

125
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,125
If we--if you--were to
strip them of it--

126
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,916
No...! That's the very reason
we have to let it die...!

127
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,541
People need to be able
to stand as people!

128
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,875
And how would they do that...?

129
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,500
Were night to fall
on the system,

130
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,125
humanity would be
condemned to drift.

131
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,166
So what...?!
Perhaps cast adrift,

132
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,750
they'll learn how to
help one another!

133
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,916
You really believe that...?
Begging and scraping

134
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,541
will eclipse any regard
for their fellows...

135
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:15,083
People have grown too
monstrously entitled

136
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,458
to truly stand as people.

137
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:23,000
They can but wait...
Gazing intently up at the sky...

138
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,958
Deprive humanity of
that single comfort...

139
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:30,666
And all that is left to them
is wretchedness and despair.

140
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,916
But... Can't we...?

141
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:46,250
Data analysis complete.
The intruders are confirmed

142
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,375
to be Sunda Granite
and Clain Decran.

143
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,916
No, Clain! Don't...!
This is foolishness...!

144
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,625
You know that if you
come to the Temple...

145
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:56,458
Then Nessa won't be
far behind, is that it?

146
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:59,708
My dear, if you hadn't decided
to act as a part of the key,

147
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,833
what were your
intentions in returning?

148
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,833
I wanted the fighting to stop...

149
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:06,458
You do realize that it
was I who gave the orders

150
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:09,666
to purge all members of the
Lost Millennium, do you not?

151
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,875
What made you presume that
the matter was open to debate?

152
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:17,458
I believed you could be
swayed... And still do.

153
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,666
With what brazen
confidence you speak.

154
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,375
You are... my mother
and my sister, together...

155
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:24,666
Deep down, I know the feelings

156
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,583
that have haunted
me haunt you too.

157
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:30,666
We share a bond...
A strong one...

158
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,291
You and I are both incarnations
of the same little girl!

159
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,416
This way!

160
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,833
We're coming, Phryne.
Just hold on!

161
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:54,375
You were once Phryne yourself,
sister. I know this...

162
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,625
And even if Fractale is
renewed successfully,

163
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:59,416
in another handful of centuries,
this whole sordid drama

164
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,791
will have to play itself
out again, and again...

165
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:05,666
The system's dirty secret is
that a key must be created

166
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,708
repeatedly in order to maintain
the system as a whole.

167
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,583
Every time it begins
to disintegrate,

168
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,583
legions of us must
be made anew...

169
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,708
Each of us subjected
to untold tortures

170
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:18,458
to test our suitability...
Defiled...

171
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,000
Humiliated...

172
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,916
I can stand it no longer...
The same horrible things

173
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,541
done to us over and
over and over again...

174
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:30,250
I'm done with it... I will not
allow any more of us to die!

175
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,916
Help me...! Help us all!

176
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:39,083
Come here... my sister.

177
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,166
Sister...

178
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,708
Please.

179
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:47,666
I knew you would understand.

180
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:11,500
How dare you
condescend to me...?

181
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,791
We are not of the same cloth!

182
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:18,041
You are the World's
Beloved Maiden! And I...

183
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:21,666
A girl rejected by the
world out of sheer spite!

184
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,750
We've got intruders
in the Jade Block!

185
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,583
You lot get your asses
over there immediately!

186
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:28,916
Give them whatever
backup they need!

187
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,125
Yes, sir! We'll report back
as soon as possible.

188
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:35,000
Dammit!
We need more ammunition!

189
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,791
Get with the program, Takamy!

190
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:37,791
I'm on it, I'm on it!

191
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,625
--Hey, um, Enri...
--What?!

192
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,333
Would you really be sad if...

193
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,625
Nessa suddenly
disappeared again?

194
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,916
 Uh--Nessa...

195
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,625
Will you be sad?

196
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:51,541
Dumbass! How is that a
question? 'Course I would!

197
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,458
What would I do
without you, Nessa?!

198
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:56,250
We can play
hide-n'-seek later, okay?

199
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,000
Hide-n-seek...

200
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,875
Boss...! A transmission from
the Tristan coming through!

201
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,541
The Tristan's about to make
a play for the Temple's

202
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,708
front door. Requesting
backup from the Danan.

203
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,333
Wait! You're just
gonna storm it?!

204
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,541
In about five minutes the
hangar door will be wide open

205
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,250
and we're gonna try our luck.

206
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,791
How do you know that?!

207
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,208
Enri, let's go!

208
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,833
Nessa, honey, we've
been through this...

209
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,166
If we let you go in there--

210
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,458
Nessa doesn't care...!

211
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:24,083
Nessa is going whether
you like it or not!

212
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:26,125
Hey!

213
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:30,708
Hold on! Do you really
wanna see Clain so badly?

214
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:33,708
Nessa doesn't like
breaking promises.

215
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,708
Clain, Nessa and Phryne said...

216
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:38,208
That we'd all be together
forever and ever...!

217
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:41,458
It was a promise and Nessa
is going to keep it!

218
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,458
Boss, we, uh...

219
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,958
Alright then...
We'll join Alabaster.

220
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,125
Takamy, turn us around.

221
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:51,083
Wait... You really...

222
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,458
Haven't you
learned anything...?

223
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:55,333
We're not gonna let you
waltz in there by yourself.

224
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:56,875
Enri!

225
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,500
You, doted on and fawned over...

226
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:03,708
And I, cast aside like
so much garbage...!

227
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:06,125
Be grateful someone loves
you enough to despair

228
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,250
the thought of losing
you to the system...!

229
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:11,375
I hate you with every
fiber of my being!

230
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,000
You have all I ever wanted...

231
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,333
And I envy you that
more than I can say...

232
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:19,125
but you will see... my faith
is stronger than your love!

233
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:20,750
Please, sister...

234
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:24,916
I will renew Fractale
infinitely if need be!

235
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,875
People will continue
to walk through life

236
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,833
not knowing what
it is to be alive...

237
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:31,250
They will never know
freedom, nor anything

238
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:34,583
but the shadow of love.
They will never be human.

239
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:42,291
Like me.
Exactly like me...

240
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:45,916
It is what the world deserves.
Thus I mollify my heart.

241
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,333
By robbing mankind
of its humanity.

242
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,458
Excuse me, Archpriestess!

243
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,250
Halt!

244
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,708
Brace yourself, kid...
Look sharp.

245
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,625
 Are you kidding me?

246
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,791
The Lost Millennium hacked
into our security protocols

247
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:24,708
and have wrenched all
the bay doors wide open!

248
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:36,000
Stop right there, Phryne!
I forbid you to leave!

249
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,916
I understand your despair...

250
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
You have suffered as
much as I, my sister.

251
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:43,875
It is for your sake as well
as mine that I do this...

252
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,208
Archpriestess?

253
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,166
For my sake...

254
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:57,916
Who am I...?
Why should I care?

255
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:04,583
She is the world's
beloved maiden.

256
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,625
You bastards!

257
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:08,875
Oh, no...

258
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,666
Let her go or I'll kill
every last one of you!

259
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,458
Nessa?!

260
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,000
Sunda...?! Clain!

261
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,500
Damn it to hell, you're
supposed to be on the ship!

262
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:26,041
Help Nessa! Clain!

263
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:29,375
Nessa!!

264
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:30,916
No, wait!

265
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,791
Looks like we got
here just in time.

266
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,333
Dias!

267
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,125
Wait, that's...

268
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,541
This whole time, you've had a
goddamn Fractale Terminal?!

269
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,541
You freaking hypocrite...!

270
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,708
After tricking the refugees out
of theirs? What the hell?!

271
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,041
There's no other option...

272
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:03,083
The world's still up to
its eyeballs in Fractale.

273
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,375
It's basic strategy for
beating the system...

274
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:08,708
Go home if you can't
fight fire with fire.

275
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:11,000
You son of a bitch...

276
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,500
Enri!

277
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,083
What the hell? You listen
to this guy so much

278
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,541
you don't follow orders anymore?

279
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:19,041
--We...
--This isn't Enri's fault...

280
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:22,583
Nessa just wanted to keep
her promise to her friends.

281
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,833
Clain told Nessa and Phryne
we'd be together forever...

282
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:27,666
And that means sticking
by each other's side

283
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,500
through thick and thin no
matter what happens, right?

284
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,291
But you've got to understand...

285
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,625
I recommend you continue
the search for Phryne...

286
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,875
God knows where she
could be right now...

287
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,750
Nessa, do you have
the ability to pinpoint

288
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,458
her location in the Temple?

289
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:41,500
Yup!

290
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,083
Yeah, but...

291
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,875
Chances are she's desperately
searching for the two of you.

292
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,791
Let's go!

293
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,791
The vital half of the key
is on the move as I speak...

294
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,416
Put a tail on her...
She's going to lead you

295
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,208
to the other half...
When you find her, kill her.

296
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,333
Carry on breaking down
the Temple's defenses--

297
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,833
You bastard!

298
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,750
Oh, I'm sorry, you know a
better way to keep them

299
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:11,416
from rebooting the system
right under our noses?

300
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,250
We want the Temple's morale
at an all-time low...

301
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,041
That's when we strike--

302
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,166
Sunda, what are you doing?

303
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,708
 Nice.

304
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,000
Sunda...! Wait up!

305
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,291
Nessa's starting to feel
less and less substantial...

306
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,666
This isn't good.

307
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,958
♪ I look up to the sky... ♪

308
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,250
Why are you...?

309
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,791
♪ ...and offer my wish
to the Day Star... ♪

310
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,625
What's that song?

311
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:43,458
Wait a minute!

312
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,625
Phryne and Nessa both sang
a version of this song

313
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:46,916
when I first met them...

314
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,833
I'm pretty sure it's
a tune from the era

315
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,708
when Fractale was
first conceived...

316
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,458
That makes sense.

317
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,583
Nessa...

318
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,250
 Who are you people?

319
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,041
We've located one
half of the key.

320
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,916
Wha... What do you want?

321
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,125
Run away, Phryne...
While you can...

322
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:13,166
What is going on...?

323
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,875
Just go, now!

324
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:25,333
♪ I look up to the sky... ♪

325
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:31,083
♪ And offer my wish
to the Day Star... ♪

326
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,875
♪ Asking my wings to return... ♪

327
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,916
Clain?! Nessa?!

328
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,541
Phryne!

329
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:43,291
No, no, no!
I can't hear you!

330
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,666
Nessa...

331
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,541
Wait, now I can hear you...
Perfectly clear...

332
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:57,583
Nessa's acting as a connection
between the two of us...

333
00:19:57,666 --> 00:20:00,458
Listen... Both of you...
You need to know...

334
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:03,250
Look, whatever it is, I don't
care--let's just leave...

335
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,333
That little house
is waiting for us...

336
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:06,833
Let's forget all this crap...

337
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:09,916
We can be happy together,
I know it... the three of us...

338
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,458
Forever.

339
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,958
Come Archpriestess...!
We've prepared Odin.

340
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:20,833
You must leave here at once!

341
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:23,291
Not before the Creation
Ceremony is held...

342
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:26,166
Open the Stairway to Heaven's
Summit immediately.

343
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,708
But, ma'am...

344
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,250
Talk to me.

345
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:34,416
I'm sorry for
all this... Really.

346
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,625
All I ever wanted was
for Nessa to be safe.

347
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:40,375
She represents all that
was beautiful in me.

348
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,250
What do you mean
"was" beautiful...?

349
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:45,041
Phryne, please, you're
not making sense!

350
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,041
Don't be so
self-deprecating, child.

351
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:50,666
You've no idea
what it does to me.

352
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,333
Not you again!

353
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:55,625
What is truly beautiful in you,
my dear, is everlasting...

354
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,708
Lest you forget, I am in a
unique position to know.

355
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,416
Get away, bastard!

356
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,250
Have you still not told
your special little friend

357
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,625
the best part of this story?

358
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,750
Innocence does have
its charm, but alas,

359
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:14,500
the girl you see before
you is bound to me...

360
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,958
By an interminable love.

361
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:42,083
<i>Down by the salley gardens</i>
<i>my love and I did meet</i>

362
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:55,958
<i>She passed the salley gardens</i>
<i>with little snow-white feet</i>

363
00:21:56,041 --> 00:22:10,000
<i>She bid me take love easy,</i>
<i>as the leaves grow on the tree</i>

364
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:23,958
<i>But I, being young and foolish,</i>
<i>with her did not agree</i>

365
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:47,916
<i>But I was young and foolish,</i>
<i>and now I am full of tears</i>

366
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,916
<i>But I was young and foolish,</i>
<i>and now I am full of tears</i>
