1
00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:09,875
Phryne, you...?

2
00:00:09,958 --> 00:00:12,291
Nessa, go to Clain. Now.

3
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:13,291
But...

4
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:14,833
Just do it!

5
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:21,541
Am I coming in loud and
clear for you now, boy?

6
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:23,583
By way of thanking you
for taking such good care

7
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:25,708
of our girl, permit
me to let you in

8
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:29,583
on the secret of this world.
An object lesson, if you like.

9
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:31,708
You're a creep.
Get your hands off her!

10
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:33,750
It's only fair to mention,
your friendship will be

11
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:37,541
sorely tested by the
chestnut of wisdom I offer.

12
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:40,125
Phryne is a copy of the girl
on whose biological script

13
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:42,791
the inner workings of
Fractale are based.

14
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:45,416
To preserve the script,
scientists at the project's helm

15
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,375
split the girl's personality
into abstract neural data

16
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:52,750
and biological information.
In essence: a body, and a soul.

17
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:56,958
Together these formed the key to
Fractale's continued existence.

18
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:59,541
700 years later, however,
when the time came

19
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:02,250
to rejoin them, a fault in
the basic code prevented

20
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:05,291
the key from fitting, as it
were, into the keyhole.

21
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:07,750
Since the original Phryne
was ten years of age,

22
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,791
a "vessel" thought to be
appropriate was cloned

23
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:12,166
from preserved tissue
samples in hopes

24
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,416
of merging the
neural data with it.

25
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,166
Much to their chagrin,
this approach foundered.

26
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,916
Each attempt became
an exercise in futility.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,500
The godhead of Fractale simply
would not be stirred to wake.

28
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:27,125
Countless duplicates were tried
and discarded in the process.

29
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:29,250
Years later, having toiled
for generations,

30
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:31,125
the best minds
then turned to me...

31
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:33,541
By my nature I am a
compassionate soul...

32
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:35,958
During the course of my work
I became fond of the clones

33
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:38,708
and took several under wing
out of a sense of obligation...

34
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:40,583
One was this brazen
young thing...

35
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:43,250
A beloved daughter on whose
supple, milk-white shoulders

36
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:45,250
the responsibilities
of a god shall nest

37
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:49,166
like a majestic peregrine...
Isn't that right, my dear?

38
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,250
Her loveliness far
from distracted me

39
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:54,000
in my work, however.
Quite the contrary:

40
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:56,416
I uncovered the vital
secret my predecessors

41
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,791
in their frenzied
haste neglected.

42
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:01,750
I was staggered, but
understood instantly.

43
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:04,541
My forbears were misled:
god, as it were,

44
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,708
was not a ten-year-old girl
at all... but sixteen...!

45
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:10,375
The exact age of our
darling Phryne here!

46
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:12,541
The maiden on whose
biorhythms Fractale hinged

47
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:14,958
had created a childlike
second persona,

48
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:16,958
an imaginary friend
through whom she might

49
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:20,375
deflect the burden of painful
childhood memories!

50
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,625
We've got to get
them out of here.

51
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,166
Watch your ass!

52
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,208
I need both of you to
backtrack and find

53
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:00,125
a route around these
sons-a-bitches.

54
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:03,666
We're gonna find our comrades.
Before Dias does. Got it?

55
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,291
--Yes sir!
--Yes sir!

56
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:10,416
Why the hell haven't you
found the sanctuary yet?

57
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,125
What happened to the
reinforcements I asked for...?

58
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,000
What do you mean they're
"not responding"?

59
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:18,375
I refuse to accept that!
You find those cowards!

60
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,583
You see, this Phryne
had much the same,

61
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:23,041
shall we say, "experience"
as the original.

62
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:26,750
This is why her biorhythms fit
so perfectly into the mold.

63
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,458
Wait, what kind of experience?

64
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:33,958
It's complex, but...
love was the essential feature.

65
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,833
Love?

66
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:38,375
I don't get it. Phryne,
what does he mean by that?

67
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,875
I mean that despite your
efforts she belongs to me.

68
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:43,083
Just as the world she so
reluctantly preserves,

69
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,750
will eventually belong to
the two of us alone.

70
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:48,375
Yes... I empathize with
your pain at having

71
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:51,750
to give the girl up. After all,
she is the finest specimen

72
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:55,791
brought to maturity under
my care. Just look at her!

73
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,791
Burn with envy,
would-be interloper!

74
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:59,916
You will forever be a
millennium too early to win

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,208
both the maid and the world;
though there is comfort

76
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,708
in knowing she cared enough
to spare you the knowledge...

77
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:07,250
That said, I believe it's time
you showed your affection

78
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,916
by sparing her
the sight of you!

79
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,833
Fare thee well, my
misguided romantic!

80
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,708
What's gotten into you, my dear?

81
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,541
You know it hurts your
father's heart to see

82
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,333
such a refined young
blossom resort

83
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:32,500
to lowly, attention-grabbing
tactics like this...

84
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,416
From where do you
learn this behavior?

85
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,375
Certainly not from me...

86
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:38,916
Nooo!

87
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,791
Don't leave Daddy. He's hurt...

88
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:46,583
Phryne, wait...!
Clain, Phryne needs us now!

89
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,250
Nessa's following her!

90
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,208
Get it off...! Get it off!

91
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,875
Get it off, get it off,
get it off, get it off!!

92
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:12,041
Nessa, wha...
what are you doing?

93
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,958
When Nessa felt cold, this is
how Phryne made her warm...

94
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,250
It was a very nice thing
Phryne did for Nessa,

95
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,458
so she's happy to
return the favor.

96
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:22,791
Believe me, the last
thing I deserve

97
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,833
is to be treated with
anything like kindness, or...

98
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:27,333
Why do you say that?

99
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:30,041
I'm a defiled creature,
Nessa... There's...

100
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,750
There's no denying it...
It's who I am--

101
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,291
Nessa thinks you're pretty...

102
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:42,500
When you cry your tears
sparkle like jewels.

103
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:47,166
Nessa... What's happening?

104
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,458
I remember this song.

105
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:55,750
We should go.

106
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,208
Go where?

107
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,875
As long as we can be together...

108
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,000
I really couldn't
care less where.

109
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,750
Clain can come, too?

110
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,083
Say what you will...

111
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,958
Our love is not of
the common ilk.

112
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,583
For all your boyish infatuation,
the world whose rebirth

113
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,916
she represents shall
belong only to she and I.

114
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,875
Stop saying that crap...

115
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,833
She is the finest
specimen of my art--

116
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,791
the very pinnacle
of my genius...

117
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:27,166
It's only natural you'd
want to possess her.

118
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,375
Stop it... Stop it!!

119
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:31,375
What are you doing?

120
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:32,625
What are <i>you</i> doing?

121
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,291
More to the point,
where is Phryne holed up?

122
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,625
We have to find her before
Alabaster gets to her!

123
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,000
--What?
--Oh, do the math...

124
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,708
Hey, why the hell is
Nessa not with you?!

125
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,916
Please tell me you didn't
just let her wander off!

126
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,541
Suck it up, doll face!
You don't get all wobbly-kneed

127
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,250
when people are
depending on you...!

128
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,291
I mean do you love
them or not, pervert?!

129
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,791
I do...

130
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:56,250
Oh my god... I've never told
Phryne the way I feel about her.

131
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,791
You what?

132
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,333
Come on!

133
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,000
The defensive detail
onboard the Tristan

134
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,333
has been completely annihilated!

135
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,000
We're not going to be able
to hold out much longer.

136
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,000
Without reinforcements,
we're dead!

137
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,291
I wish I could disagree,
but I've just received word

138
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,916
that the three clans
meant to back us up

139
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,500
have broken from the line.

140
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,166
Are you kidding?!

141
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,416
Betrayal is par
for the course...

142
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,916
All's fair in love and war,
my brothers.

143
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,083
My hand has been forced.

144
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,416
I'll enact strategy E
as we discussed...

145
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,750
You two catch a ride
out of here with Sunda.

146
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:25,833
Not a chance!

147
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,666
We're not leaving
our leader's side!

148
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,166
Thank you both.

149
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,416
Things are gettin'
rougher out there...

150
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,500
Enri!

151
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:35,708
There you are!

152
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:38,000
Clain... Hate to be
the bearer of bad news,

153
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:40,333
but for some reason Alabaster's
taken it on themselves

154
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:41,708
to blow the Temple
to Kingdom Come.

155
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:42,875
What?!

156
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,125
I want you both to get
back to the Danan

157
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,333
and steer it as far away
from here as you can.

158
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,166
You're not gonna stay behind...?

159
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,250
I've got some loose
ends to tie up...

160
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,166
Clain, what about you?

161
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,708
Yeah, me too...

162
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,250
I'm giving command of
the Danan to you, Enri.

163
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,500
No, you're the captain!
I refuse!

164
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,916
Now, now...
I haven't misjudged

165
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,708
my little baby sister's
ability to man up, have I?

166
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,375
Please... I can't...

167
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:10,750
C'mon, sis, I'll be home
before you know it...

168
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,291
Takamy, you promise me
you've got Enri's back.

169
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,166
Yes, sir!

170
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,916
Alright, Clain! Let's move!

171
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:25,625
Dias, you asshole.

172
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,875
Least let us get there
before you blow us up.

173
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,375
Hold on...
What is that music?

174
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,625
Sounds like it's coming
from over that way.

175
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,500
What's all this?

176
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,250
Phryne! Nessa! It's me!

177
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:53,458
Stand down, all of you...
We are in the midst

178
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:56,833
of a holy ceremony; I will
not allow violence here.

179
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,125
Phryne, get away from them!

180
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,666
She has come here of
her own volition, boy.

181
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,291
She has embraced her calling.

182
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:03,875
Yeah, sure she has.

183
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:07,500
Without talking to me
about it first? No, c'mon!

184
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,041
You can't.

185
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:13,416
Come forward. You're
welcome to join our prayer.

186
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,625
The millennial rite is calling
the beloved maidens

187
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,916
to heaven's summit, and it
would be a shame for us

188
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
not to share it... I beg
of you, let us both widen

189
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,250
our narrow ideologies
and bestow a blessing

190
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:26,416
upon the world as fellow
spirits in peace.

191
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,666
Nicely done...

192
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,875
I assume it's alright
if I join in as well?

193
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:31,375
Dias...

194
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,500
I can't even begin to tell you
how gratifying it will be

195
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:36,291
to take part in something larger
than my "narrow ideology."

196
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,791
Stand clear, Archpriestess!

197
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,333
He's dangerous!

198
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,500
It's an honor to
meet you, your grace.

199
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:48,166
Stand up, please...
Your words and manner

200
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,666
tell me you are a
kindred spirit, sir...

201
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,791
Permit me to say that in another
life I believe the two of us

202
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,958
might have been the
closest of companions.

203
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:59,166
Permit me to say your words
move me as an ocean.

204
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,750
I assume that you've already
placed a device in our midst?

205
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:04,000
Yes. Two of my greatest
friends since childhood

206
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,333
gave their lives to
see that it was done.

207
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,666
I mourn their loss.

208
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,000
Thank you.

209
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,000
Archpriestess!

210
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,833
What the hell?

211
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,666
Does loneliness plague you?

212
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,625
Sometimes. But in
the final loneliness,

213
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:21,333
the two of us can be the
closest of companions.

214
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:24,333
I yield my life freely without
a qualm in my heart...

215
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:28,500
However... Let it be known
that I do not yield the world.

216
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,458
Now's our chance!

217
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,583
Son of a...

218
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:39,291
Jump the gap!
Don't think about it, just go!

219
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,291
--Are you alright?
--Clain!

220
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,125
Dammit!

221
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,458
You're hit!

222
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,208
Don't worry about it,
just get in the elevator!

223
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,916
Stop looking at me and move!

224
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,125
How do I get it to go up?

225
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,625
The button there on your side.

226
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,000
And this'll take you to
"heaven's summit"

227
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,458
or whatever the hell it is?

228
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:57,583
Right.

229
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,625
Make sure they get
up there safe, 'kay?

230
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,166
 You're not coming?!

231
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,041
I really wish I had more time
to explain it to you, kid...

232
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:08,291
Honestly, I don't have the first
clue how the world ought to be.

233
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,583
But I have zero regrets
for the path I chose;

234
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,125
hell, in the end we've
all gotta pick sides

235
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,333
without knowing what's
right for everyone...

236
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:17,416
And now... it's time
for you to make a choice.

237
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,708
No matter what decision
you make, Clain,

238
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,416
we're in this together.

239
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,458
You're gonna have to
get through me first!

240
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:27,708
Just get in here!

241
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,750
With any luck, I'll see
you on the other side!

242
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,250
That was close.

243
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,041
Don't get comfortable; we're
not out of the woods yet...!

244
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,416
Come on... girl!

245
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,250
We're just gonna leave Sunda
and others back there?!

246
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,166
Full speed ahead.

247
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,166
Boss...!

248
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,125
Captain's orders, Takamy.

249
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:00,666
Hello, Phryne.

250
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,208
Hope you're not cold...

251
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,541
No.

252
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,833
I'm glad it's warm enough
for you in here, then.

253
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:08,625
Nessa likes Phryne's
warmth the best.

254
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,791
Are you gonna go
through with it?

255
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:13,958
Yes.

256
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,416
Why?

257
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,708
Nessa's on the verge of
completely dissipating.

258
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,000
I have to do something.

259
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,458
But... I mean,
you said so yourself:

260
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,750
once the two of you merge,
there's no way of knowing

261
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,250
if either one of
you will survive.

262
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,375
There is that...

263
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,625
Come on...!
It's practically suicide!

264
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,375
And if that's the way this
unfolds, then at least

265
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,833
I'll have walked into it
without any illusions...

266
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:36,916
Oblivion isn't such a terrifying
idea if you think about it;

267
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,625
it's where we come from,
it's where we end up...

268
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:42,208
So you've made up
your mind, then.

269
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,833
Without considering how I feel.

270
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:48,291
What do you mean, Clain?
How do you feel?

271
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:51,666
I don't have the first clue how
the world ought to be either...

272
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,458
Between The Lost Millennium
and the Temple,

273
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,208
both sides have their
pros and cons.

274
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:57,375
If someone asked
me to choose

275
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:59,625
one over the other
right now I couldn't...

276
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,375
But I know this much...

277
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:05,166
If I lose you and Nessa,
I might as well be dead.

278
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,000
That's how much it'll hurt.

279
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:09,250
I really wish you could hear
yourself talk right now;

280
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,666
someone like me
isn't worth a fraction

281
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,375
of the worry you've put
yourself through--

282
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:16,458
Shut up.
I love you, okay...?

283
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:19,791
Yes, you're volatile.
You smack me around.

284
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,791
The crap that comes out of your
mouth sometimes is insane.

285
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,500
The way you do whatever
you want can be selfish.

286
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:29,333
But... I wouldn't
change you if I could...

287
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,458
I would, however,
risk life and limb

288
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,750
to blast my way in here
to tell you that.

289
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:36,083
Please, don't do
this to me, Clain.

290
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,583
Whatever's gonna
happen up there,

291
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:40,750
I want the two of us in it
together as much as possible...

292
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:43,916
No. The three of us.

293
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,541
Clain, Nessa and Phryne
will be together.

294
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:50,083
Forever and ever...
No matter what happens.

295
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,000
Whatever you want, it can wait.
Get back to your post.

296
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,250
No slacking off till we've
reached neutral airspace.

297
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:05,041
I can see your face
reflected in the glass.

298
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:09,125
It's... just that
I don't know...

299
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,500
There there, girl: let it out...

300
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:16,083
Can I tell you something
I think might help...?

301
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:19,083
Despite what you might believe,
The Lost Millennium didn't arise

302
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:22,583
out of the intention to destroy
Fractale and the Temple.

303
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:27,166
It was meant to preserve the
memory of life before Fractale,

304
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,000
so that future
generations would know

305
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,833
there were once
alternatives.

306
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,625
In the end, that's the
essence of freedom.

307
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,166
It's beautiful...

308
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,166
Careful...

309
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,875
Try not to disturb anything;
remember, this is a sanctuary.

310
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,375
So then, what exactly are
we supposed to be doing?

311
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,208
I'm not sure.
Nessa's memory

312
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,291
is meant to lead us
from this point.

313
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,708
Nessa sees you...

314
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,583
Who do you see, Nessa?

315
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,416
That's you, Phryne!

316
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,875
That's God.

317
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,541
Hope I'm in the
shot... 'Kay, so...

318
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:17,291
I finished getting ready and I'm
about to head into work...

319
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:18,708
A couple of weeks
ago some people

320
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,708
with this thing called
Fractale or whatever told me

321
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:23,000
they were looking for a
girl to help 'em out...

322
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:26,208
I can't remember exactly how,
but it has to do with data...

323
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm sorta nervous, actually...
But I've gotta buckle down

324
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,500
and go through with it if I
don't want Dad to get upset...

325
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:34,416
And the last thing any of us
want is for Dad to get upset.

326
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,750
But I'll be okay...

327
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,125
They're letting me bring
Nessa along for the ride!

328
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,041
"Everything's gonna be fine"...

329
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,000
I don't know what I'd
do without my Nessa;

330
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:45,125
I'm so glad they're letting you
be part of all this stuff...

331
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,625
"Nessa's not about to
let you face it alone."

332
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:49,250
Ha! That's what makes
you the best friend

333
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,000
a girl could ask for, right?

334
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,458
How cheerful she
is despite it all.

335
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,500
This is my favorite song! Hey...

336
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:01,958
What is Nessa going to wish for
from the Day Star this time...?

337
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:04,250
"Nessa wants to stuff
her face with cake!"

338
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,875
Ooo, that sounds good!

339
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,750
One with lots of
berries on top, yeah?

340
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,791
Ah, Dad's here--
gotta go... Bye-bye!

341
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:16,541
She's just... an
ordinary... girl...

342
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:19,583
A lot like me... That's right.

343
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:22,583
She's different from me, though,
because she can still smile...

344
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,458
She could accept the
world as she found it,

345
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,083
twisted and
malevolent as it was,

346
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:29,625
and still find something
worth taking joy in.

347
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,791
Just like Nessa.

348
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:35,000
Are you ready... to go?

349
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:38,791
Thank you. I can find
joy in the world now,

350
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:41,416
no matter what
I've been through.

351
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,833
Because of wonderful
people like you...

352
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,625
Because of Nessa...

353
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,125
What I'm doing now
I do because I want

354
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:51,666
to protect the people
I care about...

355
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:55,958
If that means I'm selfish,
so be it, Clain. I'm sorry.

356
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:02,083
I was wrong about that...
Whatever happens...

357
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,333
I'm here for you
both all the way.

358
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,083
Once you've merged,
I'll bring you home.

359
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:10,083
We'll live together
just like we planned.

360
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,375
I wanna protect what
I care about, too...

361
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,083
If that means letting you
go through with this...

362
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,791
So be it.

363
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:23,625
Can you stand?

364
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:24,875
Mm hmm.

365
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,041
Then what do you say to
a game of hide-n'-seek?

366
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,916
Phryne wants to play now?

367
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,166
You bet, only this time,

368
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,458
the whole world will
be our playground.

369
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:37,250
Nessa likes the sound of that...
Phryne is "it" first, though.

370
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:40,125
Whatever you want, sweetheart.

371
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:43,458
Thank you, Clain...
Thank you for you.

372
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,000
Nessa...

373
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:50,500
♪ I look up to the sky... ♪

374
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:55,125
♪ And offer my wish
to the day star... ♪

375
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:58,875
♪ Asking that Clain's
old smile... ♪

376
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:02,875
♪ Be boundless as the
wreathing blue... ♪

377
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:06,041
Oddly enough, I didn't cry...
It occurred to me

378
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:09,333
that anyone else in this
situation would, but...

379
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:13,000
For some reason...
I just didn't.

380
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:16,291
Not because I
wasn't sad... I was...

381
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:20,166
But what Phryne and Nessa wanted
most from me was a smile...

382
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,291
Maybe the best I could
do for them was not cry.

383
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,625
Time for the
Five O'clock Prayer.

384
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,583
Today we celebrate
the first anniversary

385
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,708
of Fractale's
glorious renewal...

386
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:42,125
Let us bear in the mind the
noble sacrifices of those

387
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:45,416
who made it possible as we offer
up a prayer for continued peace

388
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,458
and prosperity under Fractale's
benevolent guidance...

389
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,875
My left foot under its
benevolent guidance.

390
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,958
How gullible do those
drones think we are?

391
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,708
Let 'em spout whatever nonsense
helps 'em sleep at night;

392
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,625
least the Temple's out of
commission for now.

393
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,166
Good point.

394
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,958
Not to complain, but do our
nails have to get so grubby?

395
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,916
C'mon man, you're killin' me
here; of course they do.

396
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,125
You teaching these folks to
work the soil or aren't you?

397
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,916
I'm doing my best...!

398
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,291
Enri's taken to leadership
like a duck to water;

399
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,708
Sunda'd be so proud.

400
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:16,500
Yep.

401
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,291
Ooooh, I found a squirmy!

402
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,666
Look, your rear-end's stickin'
out like a sore thumb...

403
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,000
You gotta bend those knees more.

404
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,833
Get your hands off me, you perv!

405
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,125
What the heck was that for?!

406
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,041
Someone's taken a page
from Clain's book...

407
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,250
Maybe.

408
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,041
Yeah, well...
Don't expect to live up

409
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:33,416
to that tiger's level
any time soon...

410
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,500
That boy... I wonder
what he's up to.

411
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:39,833
You want some bread...?

412
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:42,208
Weirdo dog... Have at it.

413
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:47,250
You sure get excited over
something you can't taste.

414
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,916
It's been a year... I've started
cooking at home more...

415
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,791
Struck me as nice
chance of pace.

416
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,500
I'm getting better.

417
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,958
Another lovely day you're
sleeping through, girls.

418
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,500
Neither of 'em have stirred

419
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:09,375
so much as an eyelash
since that day.

420
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:10,833
Goin' out. Gonna
scrape something up

421
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:13,541
for us to call dinner.
Back in bit.

422
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,333
Hey, you're awake...

423
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,458
Have you ever seen
a morning so lovely?

424
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:26,166
Uh... Are you feeling...

425
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,666
The Day Star looks
so pretty! I like it...!

426
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,166
And I like liking things,
don't you?

427
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,291
Yeah, it's pretty
great, isn't it?

428
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:39,625
Nessa...?

429
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:40,666
Huh?

430
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,333
Oh, nothing... I was
just wondering

431
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:43,750
if you were hungry yet.

432
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:46,375
Am I hungry...?
Well this part in here

433
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,625
hurts a little bit so I
guess I must be...

434
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,166
Wait right there. I'll have
breakfast up in two shakes.

435
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,708
Hooray!

436
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:56,833
Clain... Thank you.

437
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:05,791
Thank you...

438
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:08,875
You've been the best friend
a girl could ask for.

439
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:13,416
And the truth is I've liked
you since the day we met...

440
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,291
You make me happier
than I've ever been.

441
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:34,250
You don't have to
get all weepy...

442
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:37,000
Though it is kind
of adorable...
