So, what did that guy do?

[YASUSUKE] He and some others
raided the imperial storehouse.

Lately, we've seen an increase
in crimes of that nature.

[RAIKOU]
"Discharge"?

41
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:59,375
Yes. I was granted a
documentation of innocence,

42
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,125
and released from prison
under the condition

43

that I work for Yasusuke.

44

But I was locked up for
the same crime as that man.

You are... a very strange man.

Ha, the name is Raikou.

50
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:23,875
That man, the one
we ran into earlier?

51

You know, it's funny, but he
kinda reminded me of you.

Well, I found this stone
near the Kamogawa river

and polished it for you.

I mean, I know that noblewomen
never let their hair down

00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:02,791
or use pins like this,

65
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:05,625
but... it's just...

then you can throw it away.

it, but we should go.

that I wanted, so I took it.

is absolutely incredible!

and the crushed bean paste

go together in perfect harmony!

even my potato.

somehow incomplete.

In fact, I actually came here
to talk to you about something.

163
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:40,666
[RAIKOU]
Hm?

164
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,500
Hey, I'm gonna go
put some tea on, okay.

165
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:48,791
All right, the thing is,

166
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,166
I'm thinking about asking
Kosode to marry me.

167
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,333
[RAIKOU gasps]

168
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,500
Seriously? You can't.
You're the police.

169
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:58,458
And Kosode is a... a...

170
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:01,500
So then, you're the
same as all the rest.

171
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,875
Look, it's not that I think
Kosode's a bad person,

172
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:06,416
it's only, you know...

173
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,708
[YASUSUKE]
Well,

174
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,916
what if we were both
criminals, how about then?

175
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,750
Don't even think about
doing something so stupid.

176
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,666
Yasuske, you've
devoted your life

177
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,541
to leading people
down the right path.

178
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,333
Don't stray from
it now yourself.

179
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:23,458
Instead, you should work to get
everyone else to accept Kosode.

180
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,000
Don't stray from
the right path, huh?

181
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,416
You are straight as an arrow.

182
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,083
But you see, Raikou,
the real problem is,

183
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,916
looking at this capital now,
I'm beginning to believe

184
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,583
that all the so-called
criminals are, in fact,

185
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,000
the righteous ones.

186
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,125
Wow.

187
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:54,166
Nice, right?

188
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,208
I can't believe that you did it.

189
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,166
You really were able
to pull this off.

190
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,458
Oh, all it takes is charming
an aristocrat here and there.

191
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,916
Who are you?
Where'd you come from?

192
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,041
These people, they live in
constant fear of evil spirits,

193
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,750
and throw obscenely
decadent parties.

194
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:13,000
What a collection of
cowards and scumbags.

195
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,375
That may be, but...

196
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,666
...I still long to achieve
a higher status...

197
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,750
...to wear the finest kimonos.

198
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,708
Ah, so that's how it is.

199
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:21,750
[gasps]

200
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:26,750
What do I do?

201
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,208
[SEIMEI]
Hold your head high.

202
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,333
[KOSODE]
Please stop.

203
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:45,083
I... I've had enough now.

204
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,291
[SEIMEI] That little ride
really was enough for you?

205
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,500
[KOSODE]
Yes.

206
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,166
I guess that I'm just
not really cut out

207
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,833
for the high life after all.

208
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,791
So tell me, are you in
love with an aristocrat?

209
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,375
The man who gave me
this hair stick,

210
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:06,625
well, he was the police official
who caught me stealing.

211
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,291
You wanna forget him.

212
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:14,416
No. You're letting it go 'cause
you want him to forget you.

213
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,291
[SEIMEI] Now don't go and
ask for it back later.

214
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,583
[KOSODE]
Don't worry, I won't.

215
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,250
He already gave me
something far more valuable

216
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:27,791
than a hair trinket.

217
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:51,458
Today... was dangerous.

218
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,541
[YASUSUKE]
That's enough.

219
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,375
[KOSODE]
We can't do this.

220
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,333
[YASUSUKE]
Kosode. With you, I--

221
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,750
[KOSODE]
Yasusuke.

222
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,083
I want you to let me go.

223
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,583
[YASUSUKE gasps]

224
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,500
Wait, what do you mean?

225
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,500
[KOSODE]
Exactly what I said.

226
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:18,041
I can't be with you anymore,
Yasusuke. I just can't.

227
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,541
[YASUSUKE]
Tell me why.

228
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,583
[KOSODE] Because you carry
the Fujiwara name.

229
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:22,750
[YASUSUKE]
I told you!

230
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,750
I don't care about
my family or my name.

231
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,541
[KOSODE]
You don't get it, do you?

232
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,125
The only reason I
became a criminal

233
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,666
was because I had no
other choice in life!

234
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,166
And now you're just
gonna walk away

235
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,250
from the good life
you were born into?

236
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,750
Why would I want
to be with a fool

237
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:39,166

he has, and is so reckless?

Hold on!

Where's the hair
stick I gave you?

240
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,916
[KOSODE]
I don't have any need for it.

241
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:53,250
Every single day, the people
around us die of hunger.

Don't act like you don't see it!

243
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:58,166
Maybe. But crime
must be punished.

244
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:02,250
[KOSODE] Your idea of justice...
I don't have any need for it!

to death right now.

I hereby renounce
my name and status.

You can't be serious.

259
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,625
[YASUMASA] You have a sworn
duty to fulfill as a Fujiwara.

260
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:55,000
Really, and what sort
of duty would that be?

261
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,458
You know full well.

262
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:59,083
You're required to work
on behalf of the capital.

263
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,291
And who does this
capital work for?

264
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,791
The citizens who live
here? Or Michinaga?

265
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:07,625
I believe our lord knows
what's best for his subjects.

266
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,291
People are forced
to commit crimes

267
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,916
because our lord turns a
blind eye to their suffering!

268
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,708
[YORINOBU]
That's enough, Yasusuke!

My lord, what's going on?

[YASUMASA]
Stand down.

271
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,000
I'd rather tread
the path of a criminal

[YASUSUKE grunts]

00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,541
Nice try, Yasusuke.

00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,958
But you lack composure
and discipline.

It's impossible!

they were never

So ugly. So ugly.

You will always be

But there won't be a next time.

It seems a new Horror appeared
on the scene last night.

What happened?

The only person attacked
was an aristocrat's daughter.

The monster was apparently
wrapped in a very fine kimono.

You know that's

that you can save everybody
