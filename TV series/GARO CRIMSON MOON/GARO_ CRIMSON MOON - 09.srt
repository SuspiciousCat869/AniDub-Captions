Come!

[SEIMEI grunting]

7
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:04,625
[SEIMEI]
Why you little...!

8
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:09,500
[gasps]

9
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:12,250
Summoning a Horror,
then fighting against it?

10
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,833
And, at such a young
age takes guts,

11
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:16,583
I'll give you that much, girl.

12
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:19,375
But you're in over your head.

13
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:22,083
All that I want is
to become stronger.

14
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:25,000
And I've given up
everything to do so.

15
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:28,125
[DOUMA]
Tell me. Who are you?

16
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:30,750
My name's Kiyome.

17
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:33,416
You know, I heard rumors
that Abe no Haduaki

18
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,458
had branded his own
granddaughter "filth".

19
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:38,083
And afterwards he
banished the girl.

20
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:40,125
Now I know those
rumors were true.

21
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:42,083
Do you know my Grandpa?

22
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:44,458
[DOUMA]
It's strength you seek, huh?

23
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:47,500
I want to defeat those demons!

24
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:50,916
All right, then, I would
suggest you follow me.

25
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:59,083
[DOUMA] She possesses
extraordinarily rare talent.

26
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,041
And such a strong will.

27
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:02,833
There's no doubt
in my mind this girl

28
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:06,666
will become an unparalleled
Alchemist. However...

29
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,291
[DOUMA]
Kiyome.

30
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:11,166
[SEIMEI]
Yes, Doushi?

31
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,416
From now on, you shall
be known to all as Seimei.

32
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,791
Ah, Seimei.

33
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:21,041
I'm honored to receive
such a name from you, sir.

34
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:24,500
Henceforth, whether you
shine brightly in the light,

35
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:27,041
or fall deeply
into the darkness.

36
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:29,666
That is all up to you.

37
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:45,250
[DOUMA]
Uh. Seimei.

38
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:27,250
[SEIMEI]
Oh, look how it sparkles!

39
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,750
It's like staring at a
completely blue rainbow!

40
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:31,583
[KINTOKI]
Jeez, another one?

41
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,375
[SEIMEI]
Another one? Ha!

42
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,250
You just do not understand.

43
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,708
See. This vase is a
one-of-a-kind treasure

44
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,958
that traveled from across
the ocean to get here.

45
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,208
Not what I meant.

46
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,625
I don't care about that vase,

47
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,708
I'm mad that you bought
any vase at all!

48
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:47,083
I bet you went and borrowed
money from someone again,

49
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,166
didn't you?

50
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,916
[SEIMEI]
Oh, it's absolutely beautiful!

51
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,291
So enchanting!

52
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,041
[KINTOKI] It's too bad
"enchanting" knick-knacks

53
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,458
don't fill the belly.

54
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,208
You know, I think that
this vase sparkles

55
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,791
even more because of my
intense love for it.

56
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,125
[KINTOKI]
Sheesh!

57
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:03,250
And what about the bottom
of our empty rice box?

58
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,166
Does that sparkle, too?!

59
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,791
Hey, wait a second.
Where is Raikou?

60
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:11,375
[KINTOKI cries]
He went to the Watchdog Center

61
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:15,083
in hopes of finding work.
Had to swallow his pride.

62
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,291
A Makai Knight
begging for a job?

63
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,958
How pathetic can you get?

64
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,458
[KINTOKI growls]

65
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,541
Maybe if we didn't give you
three meals a day for free!

66
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:23,916
[RAIKOU]
Seimei! Kintoki!

67
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,416
Whoa, what happened?

68
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,791
[SEIMEI]
What's wrong?

69
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:28,958
A new Horror!

70
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,166
[KINTOKI] Hey, so, what kind
of Horror is this one?

71
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,125
[RAIKOU]
I didn't get a ton of details,

72
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,083
but it sounds like
it could be trouble.

73
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,625
Yeah, well, aren't they all?

74
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:39,000
Whatever it's like,
I'm gonna destroy it.

75
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:42,000
For certain. Seimei. Hurry!

76
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,250
Yeah, whatever.

77
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:46,000
Could you be any less
enthusiastic right now?

78
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,750
[RAIKOU]
Look, there it is!

79
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:52,625
[KINTOKI] That thing?
It's definitely creepy.

80
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:56,166
Uh? But how?
There was no breeze.

81
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,666
Raikou. The light.

82
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,375
[RAIKOU]
The Horror sucks in all light,

83
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,916
hunts humans, and fades
into the darkness.

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,666
We won't be able to see a thing.

85
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,333
I guess we'll just have
to make a little light

86
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:08,958
of our own then, won't we?

87
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,166
How?

88
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,708
Some shiny Golden Armor
should do the trick.

89
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,166
Raikou!

90
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,791
[RAIKOU]
Got it!

91
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:26,708
[KINTOKI]
Raikou?

92
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,000
[SEIMEI]
What the...?

93
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,666
This thing even absorbs
the armor's light!

94
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:34,625
[SEIMEI yells]

95
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:38,833
[SEIMEI]
It's no use.

96
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,625
This one really is
gonna be trouble.

97
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:43,041
[KINTOKI] Great, now the
light of the armor is gone.

98
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,208
Raikou!

99
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,291
[RAIKOU grunts]

100
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,708
[ZARUBA]
Calm yourself.

101
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:52,875
You may not be able to see,
but you can use the blindness

102
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:55,833
to heighten your
sense of movement.

103

106
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,791
[KINTOKI] You did it!
Just like I knew you would!

107
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:14,208
I mean, sure, I was a
little worried at first.

108
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,958
But I was always confident
you'd pull through in the end.

[RAIKOU groans]

110

[KINTOKI]
Raikou?

113
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,625
Seimei, what happening to him?

114
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:28,000
I have no idea.

115
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,041

Uh! No, no, Raikou!

120
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,333
Hey, please, are you okay?

121
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:44,541
Come on, Raikou! Get up!

122
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:49,416
[RAIKOU snoring]

123
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,583
[KINTOKI]
He's been completely out cold

124
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,791
ever since he collapsed.

125
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:58,333
Oh, man you think he's
gonna be all right?

126
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,750
Well, we took the armor
off of him, so...

127
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,208
he'll probably wake
up sooner or later.

128
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:06,000
How can you be so calm
about something like this?

129
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,208
[RAIKOU yawns]

Raikou!

00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:13,041
[RAIKOU] Man, I'm starving.
How 'bout some grub?

133
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,333
[KINTOKI]
You got it! Right away!

134
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:15,666

00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,000

138
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,875

Coming right up!

139
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:28,541

[KINTOKI]
Coming right up!

Third seconds!

Coming right up!

[KINTOKI laughs]
Well, they do say

144
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,916
that hunger's a sign
of good health, right?

145
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,083
Ah!

146
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,583
[belches]

[SEIMEI]
Mm?

148
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,750
[KINTOKI] Oh no, Raikou.
I am so sorry!

149
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:45,625
We're out!

150
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,166
The steamed rice is all gone!

151
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,166
And there's nothing left in the
rice box to heat up, either!

152
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,875
We don't have money to buy more.

153
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:55,166
[RAIKOU] Hey, calm down,
don't worry about it.

[KINTOKI]
Uh?

00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,375
Wait, Raikou,
where are you going?

156
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,833
[RAIKOU] Got no money,
I gotta go get us some.

157
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:05,791
[SEIMEI]
Raikou.

158
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:06,666
[RAIKOU]
Hm?

159
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,958
It's too soon for you to go out.

160
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,250
We really should monitor
you a little longer.

161
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,458
And besides, Zaruba is--

162
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,083
[RAIKOU] Yeah, well,
we're all outta rice.

163
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,458
So why don't you just sit there

164
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:17,125
and stare at that hair
thingy and shut up.

165
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,625
[KINTOKI]
Hey, wait for me!

166
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:21,666
[SEIMEI]
U-Uh...

167
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:25,041
Oh man, I can't believe you
told off Seimei like that!

168
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,500
"Why don't you just sit there
and stare at that hair thingy

169
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:28,916
and keep your damn mouth shut."

170
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,458
Y'know, I gotta say,

171
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:33,583
you're finally starting to sound
like a real man now, Raikou!

172
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,583
Hey, wait. Where are you going?

173
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,333
Don't do that!

174
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:38,416
Hey there, baby.

175
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,125
Wow, you are one hot mama.

176
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,708
[WOMAN 9]
Uh! Excuse me?

177
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,916
Oh, I'm sorry,
are you not a mama?

178
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,250
I can fix that for ya.

179
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,958
Oh, well, I never! How rude!

180
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:51,250
Damn. What a prissy,
stuck-up prude.

181
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,166
This is why I hate aristocrats.

182
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,500
Uh, Raikou.

183
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:57,166
[RAIKOU] See. Deep down,
they wanna have some fun.

184
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,791
But they're always so worried
about their "reputation."

185
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,916
Really, they're
annoying as hell.

186
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,416
[MAN A] What was that?!
What'd you just say to me?!

187
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,500
[MAN B] I'm telling you!
You're blind as a bat!

188
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:07,833
[MAN A]
Don't joke about that!

189
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:10,208
[MAN B] I called you blind
because you are blind!

190
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:11,583
[MAN A]
You bastard!

191
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,458
Fighting in the middle
of the street.

192
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:15,583
Just how inconsiderate
can you get?

193
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,458
Yeah, that is uncivilized.

194
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:20,541
Okay! I'll go take care of it.

195
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,583
Sure, he may be a little
bit rougher now,

196
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:26,333
but deep down, he's basically
still the same Raikou.

197
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,791
'Least I think?

198
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,625
[MAN A groans]

199
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:30,708
[MAN B screams]

200
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:31,916
[RAIKOU]
What's the problem?!

201
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,125
[MAN B]
Please forgive us!

202
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:35,208
[SEIMEI]
But why?

203
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,375
Because the Madou
Ring turned black?

204
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,958
[INARI A]
You mentioned that the Horror

205
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,666
stole the armor's
light, correct?

206
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,958
[INARI B] This is the result
of armor clad in darkness.

207
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,166
[INARI A] The darkness that
has collected in his armor

208
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,208
is affecting him negatively.

209
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:52,958
Are you saying that cleansing
the Madou Ring isn't enough?

210
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:55,916
[INARI C] You must banish the
darkness from the armor itself.

211
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,541
Otherwise, history
will only repeat.

212
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:02,125
If this continues, the owner
will lose his sanity as well.

213
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:07,625
Indeed, the situation
here is rather serious.

214
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:21,166
[MASAMUNE]
Come. Just a little closer now.

215
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,583
We're all alone.

216
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:25,000
I'll be gentle, I promise.
It'll be okay.

217
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,291
No, we can't.
We shouldn't.

218
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:28,541
I mean, come on.

219
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,250
You've got a wife
for goodness' sake.

220
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,541
Worst mistake of my life
was marrying a woman

221
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,791
who does nothing but
criticize and complain

222
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,625
every time she sees my face.

223
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:41,458
I'm gonna leave that harpy
for good, I swear!

224
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:44,208
But, for now, how 'bout
you start as my concubine?

225
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:44,916
Kissy, Kissy, Kissy!

226
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,291
Wait, no. It's wrong.

227
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,041
[RAIKOU]
Woo! I saw that. I saw it all!

228
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,208
Who's there? Show yourself!

229
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:52,500
[RAIKOU]
You're quite the ladies' man,

230
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,333
aren't you, Masamune?

231
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:57,041
[screams] It's you!

232
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,916
What are you doing in
a place like this?!

233
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,791
You get the hell outta here!

234
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,625
Hard to believe a
guy like Masamune

235
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:06,541
would ever have the guts
to abandon his wife.

236
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,125
Gee, you know,

237
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,875
I wonder how she's gonna react
when she finds out about this.

238
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,958
Do you think that she'll
take it lying down?

239
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:15,541
[MASAMUNE] Huh?! Wait, what?
How would she find out?

240
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:16,791
Hold on there.

241
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:19,083
Why don't you come
down here so we can talk?

242
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,458
Come. Come.

243
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:25,291
Let's talk. We can work
this out. [laughs nervously]

244
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:28,333
[RAIKOU laughs]
Y'see,

245
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:32,208
this is what happens when
ya put in a little effort!

246
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,708
What you did back there,
that was blackmail!

247
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,250
You don't know what
you're saying.

248
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:39,583
Look, I didn't ask the idiot
for any money, not even once.

249
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:42,083
Masamune just gave
it to us on his own.

250
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:45,208
Well, yeah, I guess that
is true, technically.

251
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,041
[RAIKOU]
Oh, hey, Seimei's home.

252
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,416
Here, check it out!

253
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,583
We can afford to buy
all the rice we want!

254
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:53,583
Go on, get yourself
something nice!

255
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:58,916
He's different.

256
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,750
He's not the Raikou I used to
know. He's like somebody else.

257
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:04,125
[whimpers]

258
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:07,625
Unfortunately, he's still being
affected by that Horror.

259
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,500
Well then, we've
gotta exorcise it!

260
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:13,416
Sorry, I'm afraid
it's not that easy.

261
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,375
[laughing] Hey! Hey, Kintoki!

262
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:21,125
We'll have a whole fish
for breakfast tomorrow!

263
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:21,791
[SEIMEI]
Raikou!

264
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:22,750
[RAIKOU]
Huh?

265
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,541
What the hell do you think
you're doing, Seimei?

266
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:27,916
Why'd you do that?

267
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,791
Damn, I can't move
at all in this!

268
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,916
It's tightening around me!

269
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:35,750
[SEIMEI] Kintoki, at the
rate things are going,

270
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,166
Raikou will lose himself.

271
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,416
[KINTOKI]
Oh, no.

272
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,375
I leave him in your care.

273
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,916
Watch him if you
don't want him to die.

274
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,041
[KINTOKI]
Mm.

275
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,750
What the...?!

276
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,000
Come on, untie me right now!

277
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,625
How am I supposed to
eat like this, huh?!

278
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,500
Hey, wait! Get back here!

279
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:55,125
Kintoki, listen,
grab that sword for me.

280
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,791
[DOUMAN] Ah. A visit from
you is such a rare treat.

281
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:05,875
But what's an excommunicated
student like you doing here?

282
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:09,791
Not here to see you. Sorry.
Don't get any ideas.

283
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,375
Well, too bad,

284
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,791
because you have to deal with
me before you can get to him.

285
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,333
[SEIMEI]
I may have been exiled,

286
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,708
but I've known him
for a very long time.

287
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:19,791
So step aside.

288
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,208
I see you're still as boorish
a nuisance as ever.

289
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:30,041
A sad, pathetic little girl
rejected not once, but twice.

290
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:35,208
[DOUMA] So, were you lured
here by the full moon?

291
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,125
[SEIMEI] No. I've come
to ask you something.

292
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,833
[DOUMA]
What is it?

293
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,791
[SEIMEI]
How do I exorcise darkness

294
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:44,000
once it has seeped into armor?

295
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:49,166
[DOUMA]
Ah, so you came to beg for help?

296
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,291
If he's affected
by the darkness,

297
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:55,708
all he has to do is accept
it and become one with it.

298
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,875
I won't let him slip
into darkness!

299
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:00,125
That is not an option!

300
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:04,791
It seems coming here was
a waste of my time.

301
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:07,416
[DOUMA] There are other
things you can do.

302
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,416
Like what? Just tell me!

303
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,291
[DOUMA] I see.
The one they call Raiko.

304
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:15,791
Don't you say his name!

305
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:19,958
[DOUMA] Ah. So that young
man really is your light.

306
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,541
You know, Seimei, it
has been far too long

307
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,583
since last you stood before me.

308
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:28,583
Let's have a little fun,
for old times' sake.

309
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,791
[DOUMA] My, my, you've developed
into quite a woman.

310
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:37,666
Go ahead and do with
me what you will.

311
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,166
Like you always have.

312
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,583
[DOUMA]
You are truly special.

313
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:46,166
One of the few who can balance
both light and darkness.

314
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:49,583
So you need only absorb
the darkness into yourself,

315
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,583
and seal it away there.

316
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,708
[SEIMEI]
Inside myself?

317
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:56,416
[DOUMA] I'll give you
the spell you need,

318
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,291
to pull that darkness into
yourself, as your mother did.

319
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:03,333
I wonder if you have
ever asked yourself

320
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:06,541
why I used the words
for "star" and "light"

321
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:09,625
to grant you the name
Seimei so long ago?

322
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,208
[gasps]

323
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:15,666
[DOUMA] A single light deepens
the darkness that surrounds it.

324
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,625
Though you will
be able to remove

325
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,791
the darkness from the armor...

326
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,166
[SEIMEI gasps]

327
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:24,625
[DOUMA] ...once that darkness
resides within you,

328
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:27,750
it will never be stripped away.

329
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,166
[groaning]

330
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,333
[KINTOKI]
Please, Raikou.

331
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:36,166
You gotta try to
calm down a little!

332
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,625
You're just gonna hurt yourself!

333
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,791
This is awful.

334
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,583
I mean, what if I never get to
see the Raikou I know again?

335
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:44,375
[RAIKOU grunts]

336
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:45,416
[KINTOKI]
Uh?

337
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:47,625
[KINTOKI screams]

338
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,541
[DOUMAN]
Why did you do that?

339
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,583
We should seize this opportunity
to crush Raikou!

340
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,666
[DOUMA]
Raikou is insignificant.

341
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,333
No, it is Seimei
who I wish to test.

342
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:04,916
Her? But why?

343
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
[DOUMA]
You still don't see it, do you?

344
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:10,875
The way the light and the
dark wage war inside her.

345
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:12,208
[DOUMAN]
I refuse to allow

346
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:15,458
even a single shining
star to burn brightly.

347
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:18,333
This world doesn't need light.

348
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:20,750
[SEIMEI]
Kintoki!

349
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,750
I know how to save Raikou!

350
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,958
Kintoki? Uh! Kintoki!

351
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:28,875
Oh, my goodness!
Are you all right?

352
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:31,041
[KINTOKI groans]
It hurts.

353
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,333
[SEIMEI] What's going on?
How did this happen?

354
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:34,666
[KINTOKI]
Uh... Well, uh.

355
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,666
[SEIMEI laughs]
That bump is huge!

356
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,333
[KINTOKI]
Gee, thanks.

357
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,083
Oh, right! Raikou!

358
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:43,166
He got away!

359
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,541
Go find Raikou for me!

360
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:46,833
[SHIKI DOLL A]
Shiki!

361
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,750
Shiki!

362
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,666
[SEIMEI] Come on.
We've gotta go get him back!

363
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,541
All right!

364
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:55,083
Raikou!

365
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,708
[KINTOKI screams]

366
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:10,000
[RAIKOU gasping]

367
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,666
[RAIKOU]
I can't believe I hit Kintoki.

368
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,875
What's wrong with me?

369
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:19,333
[RAIKOU chuckles]

370
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,416
[RAIKOU yells]

371
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,750
[DOUMAN] Oh, what a
pathetic sight you are.

372
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:28,791
Do you want to escape
this suffering?

373
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,208
You're turning into a beast.

374
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:34,375
Why not allow me to put an end
to the pain you're feeling,

375
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:38,125
before the darkness
consumes you.

376
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,541
Succumb to the
darkness, Raikou!

377
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:45,625
[RAIKOU groaning, yelling]

378
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,416
I'll make sure that
wretched woman

379
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,416
soon knows the agony of despair.

380
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,458
For the one who inherited
the name of Ashiya Doumahn...

381
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,083
is me!

382
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,000
[RAIKOU]
Uh!

383
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,375
[DOUMAN]
Feel the hate! The anger!

384
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,625
Drown in the darkness!

385
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:01,875
Huh?

386
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,541
Nice of you to come.

387
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,041
[SEIMEI]
Stop this, Douman!

388
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,541
Oh, you're far too late!

389
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:12,333
I'm afraid the boy has already
given into the darkness.

390
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:15,250
[SEIMEI]
Raikou! Summon your armor!

391
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,625
[KINTOKI]
Come on, Raikou!

392
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,416
[SEIMEI]
Raikou.

393
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,000
[RAIKOU growls]

394
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:26,958
The armor. Seimei, look!

395
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:31,916
[DOUMAN] Your Golden Knight
doesn't look so golden anymore.

396
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,541
A foolish mistake.

397
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,875
Now that he's put on
the Makai armor,

398
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:39,250
watch as he sinks into the
darkness even more rapidly.

399
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:42,416
[RAIKOU groaning]

400
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,958
Ha. It seems there's no need
for me to even finish him off.

401
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,583
I'll let nature run its course

402
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:51,000
and leave you to watch
him surrender to his fate.

403
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,750
Uh. Seimei, is...

404
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:56,041
is Raikou... going to die?

405
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:58,625
[SEIMEI]
I won't let him.

406
00:19:58,708 --> 00:19:59,666
[RAIKOU groans]

407
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,916
Even if it means giving my life!

408
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,083
Seimei.

409
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,083
Seimei!

410
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,666
[SEIMEI]
Listen, Zaruba!

411
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,125
I'll absorb the darkness
that has infected the armor.

412
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,000
Don't fight against it.

413
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,875
[SEIMEI] This is the only
way left to save Raikou.

414
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,208
But Seimei!

415
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:19,500
[SEIMEI]
Oh, Raikou. Please don't die!

416
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,708
[RAIKOU grunting]

417
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:25,250
[SEIMEI grunting]

418
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:27,458
[RAIKOU roars]

419
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:31,791
[SEIMEI yelps]
Everything...

420
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:35,875
that I love...
shines... brightly.

421
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:40,750
Which means... you...
have to... Raikou...

422
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:44,625
You have to... shine!

423
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:47,458
Raikou.

424
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,375
Come back!

425
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,583
His light's back.

426
00:20:54,666 --> 00:21:00,000
[RAIKOU gasps, yells]

427
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:02,458
[SEIMEI gasps]

428
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,166
[KINTOKI]
Seimei! Oh, Raikou!

429
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,000
Thank goodness!
You guys are all right!

430
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:14,375
Don't scare me like
that ever again!

431
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,458
[ZARUBA]
Did I cause you some trouble?

432
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:19,208
[SEIMEI]
Yeah. Just a bit.

433
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:24,250
[KINTOKI gasps]

434
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,458
Hey, you're awake.

435
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:32,583
Uh. What's up?
Have I been sleeping?

436
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,208
[KINTOKI]
Oh, Raikou!

437
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:39,583
Hey, what's wrong?
Wipe those tears, Kintoki.

438
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:42,041
Men aren't supposed
to show 'em, remember?

439
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:44,416
At least not in front
of other people.

440
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:49,333
[DOUMA]
Seimei, do not forget.

441
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,500
Though you will be
able to remove

442
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:55,416
the darkness from the armor,
once that darkness resides

443
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,625
within you, it will
never be stripped away.

444
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,208
[RAIKOU]
Whoa. Seimei.

445
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,791
What happened to your shoulder?

446
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:05,958
Oh. I got bit by a dog.
It was no big deal.

447
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:07,916
[RAIKOU]
It bit you?! Man.

448
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,083
What kinda dog was it?

449
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:10,958
Big and black, and so not cute.

450
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:13,125
Like, not even in the slightest.

451
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:16,166
[RAIKOU] Wow, sounds scary.
Glad you're okay.

452
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,666
[KINTOKI]
Seimei!

453
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,958
Come on, we're having a whole
fish for breakfast today!

454
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:21,791
[RAIKOU]
Oh, good. I'm starving!

455
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,750
[KINTOKI]
Really? Again?

456
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:25,541
[RAIKOU]
Oh, looks good!

457
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:26,916
[KINTOKI]
Doesn't it!

458
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,791
[RAIKOU, KINTOKI laugh]

459
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:05,500
[INARI B]
When your perspective changes,

460
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:07,666
so does your view of
the world around you.

461
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:11,666
Not to mention your friends.
