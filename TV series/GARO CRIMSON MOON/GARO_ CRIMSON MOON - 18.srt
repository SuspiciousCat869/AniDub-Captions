1
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:16,125
My God. The Crimson Moon.

2
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:20,291
[HARUAKI] It won't be long
before it resurrects.

3
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:21,958
Before what does?

4
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:23,541
Rudra.

5
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:26,666
Even the powers of ancient
Makai Knights and Alchemists

6
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,875
could not defeat it permanently.

7
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:31,958
It is a Horror with
unimaginable strength.

8
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,708
[SEIMEI]
Damn this curse!

9
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:35,833
What was I trying
to do back there?

10
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:38,958
If Shiki hadn't stopped me,
my Grandfather would be--

11
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:40,541
[DOUMAN]
If you wish to know the secret

12
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:42,541
to the seal on the Crimson Moon,

13
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,791
you have to get through me.

14
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:50,708
A pointless struggle.

15
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:54,708
[DOUMA]
But you know this darkness

16
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:56,916
is impossible to control.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,250
As strong as you've become,
it will devour you!

18
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:03,666
[DOUMAN]
And with this, I bid farewell

19
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,541
to the previous Ashiya Douman.

20
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:11,458
It's back.

21
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:13,333
[INARI B]
The catastrophe.

22
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:18,583
[INARI A]
It's begun.

23
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:21,041
I'm afraid that we don't
have any more time.

24
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:23,291
The dire threat contained
by the Crimson Moon

25
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:27,250
is the one known as... Rudra.

26
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:29,125
Rudra?

27
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:30,583
[INARI B]
A Horror so powerful

28
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:32,666
the knights of old
couldn't defeat it.

29
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,000
Their only option was
to seal the beast away

30
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:38,791
behind a moon barrier crafted
by highly skilled alchemists.

31
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:41,000
[INARI C] The moon turning
red was the first harbinger

32
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:44,291
of its inevitable release
upon the hapless world.

33
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:48,416
And now, it has found a
suitable vessel to inhabit.

34
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,750
Wait, this terrible monster
has been resurrected?

35
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:55,958
No. It still hasn't
completed the process yet.

36
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:57,958
[INARI B] At the moment,
it is gathering power

37
00:01:58,041 --> 00:02:02,000
within the vessel,
building up its strength.

38
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:05,041
[INARI C] And that vessel is
most likely in the hands of...

39
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,500
...none other than Douma Houshi.

40
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:10,416
Douma Houshi? But why him?

41
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,458
'Cause he was the one
who removed the seal,

42
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:14,708
freeing the beast.

43
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:16,750
[ZARUBA] This situation
is even more perilous

44
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:19,666
than I could've anticipated.

45
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:23,208
[INARI B] If Rudra emerges,
the capital will certainly fall.

46
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,458
[INARI C]
Golden Knight Garo.

47
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:26,916
Yes.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,208
[INARI A]
We hereby order you,

49
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:32,458
prevent Douma Houshi
from executing his plan.

50
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:36,208
And before Rudra's full power
can be completely restored...

51
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:38,250
[INARIS]
...eliminate it.

52
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,125
[YORINOBU] Michinaga has
officially appointed me

53
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,458
to be head police magistrate.

54
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,625
[COMMONER A] Yorinobu?
In charge of the police?

55
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,666
First, I want to apologize

56
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,125
for how the magistrate
has treated you in the past.

57
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,083
Got some nerve
after all you've done!

58
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,333
Quiet down! They'll kill you!

59
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,541
[YORINOBU] Listen, I know that
it isn't going to be easy

60
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,333
for us to rebuild trust.

61
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:56,625
However, without it, there's
no way the capital can prosper.

62
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:59,625
So I ask you all to
lend me your faith.

63
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,250
Please do.

64
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,583
[COMMONER A]
The police magistrate

65
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:05,625
are bowing their heads to us.

66
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:08,833
Let's work together to
make things better here!

67
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,958
[PEOPLE screaming]

68
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,750
[chuckles]

69
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,541
What was that?

70
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,541
Red lightning?

71
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,833
What on earth is going on?

72
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,208
Get all these people to safety!

73
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:04,375
Who is that?

74
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:05,500
Hold it!

75
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,458
Hey, wait! Who are you?

76
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:25,333
Could it be you?
Are you Seimei?

77
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:26,416
[grunts]

78
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:31,000
[DARK SEIMEI] Tell me,
where is the Golden Knight?

79
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,750
[YORINOBU]
Why would I...?

80
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,291
He was lucky enough to be
found by some citizens

81
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:50,250
who administered first aid.

82
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,500
Yeah.

83
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:54,000
If Yorinobu weren't so
beloved by the people,

84
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,833
he'd probably be--

85
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,458
[SUETSUMUHANA]
According to the officers,

86
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,625
right after the red lightning
struck the city,

87
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:03,375
he started chasing
after someone.

88
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:07,333
[RAIKOU] I never imagined things
would escalate so quickly.

89
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:09,333
[YORINOBU]
Brother...

90
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:10,625
[SUETSUMUHANA]
Yorinobu!

91
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,166
[RAIKOU]
You're awake!

92
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,958
I... saw... Sei--

93
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,208
[RAIKOU]
Yorinobu!

94
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:24,166
[MICHINAGA]
Yes, I understand.

95
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,583
So there weren't any
serious problems then?

96
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:27,791
[YASUMASA]
That's correct.

97
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,916
The Light Palace
sustained no damage.

98
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,916
Though strong, the lightning
wasn't powerful enough

99
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,916
to pierce the barrier.

100
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,958
You're in charge.

101
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,458
You're leaving, sir?

102
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:41,458
Not your concern. Haruaki. Come.

103
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:42,875
Yes.

104
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,916
I believe this world
is indeed my own,

105
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,708
as it was destined to be.

106
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:30,791
Like the full moon,
I lack nothing.

107
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,166
[gasps]

108
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:53,083
What was... that?

109
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,833
[YASUSUKE] Okay, so putting
aside Douman for a minute,

110
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,541
you wanna tell me who the
hell this Douma Houshi is?

111
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:03,958
Douma Houshi, the
previous Ashiya Douman.

112
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,791
[RAIKOU]
That's all I know.

113
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,291
The previous one?

114
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,083
So this Douma
is somehow involved

115
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,208
with that super Horror Rudra,

116
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:14,541
as well as the brutal attack
that nearly killed Yorinobu?

117
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:17,791
I have no proof,
but I believe so.

118
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,708
[YASUSUKE]
Well, then this will be easy.

119
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:23,791
He's been causing so many
problems, one after another.

120
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:26,708
It's only a matter of time
before he shows himself.

121
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,500
[RAIKOU]
How can you be so sure?

122
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,500
[YASUSUKE]
Just my gut feeling.

123
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:34,250
Your gut has quite the keen
understanding of villains.

124
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,583
He did used to be
a police officer.

125
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:39,041
Ugh, don't remind me.

126
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,416
Hey, you know,

127
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,666
it's possible the vessel may
be Douma Houshi himself.

128
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,583
I know that if it were me,

129
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,250
I would wanna keep
something that valuable

130
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,791
where I could see it.

131
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,333
Is that your thief's
instinct speaking this time?

132
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:52,666
[YASUSUKE]
Hmph.

133
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,875
There's simply no way
to know for certain

134
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,666
until we meet him face to face.

135
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,000
[RAIKOU]
You're right.

136
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,625
At the moment, there's
only one thing we do know.

137
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:06,208
If we don't stop them,
the capital will fall.

138
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,166
[YASUSUKE]
Ah, damn it.

139
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,166
Now I feel like I'm back working
for the magistrate again.

is over, Ashiya Douman.

Oh, but you're wrong.

Things are about
to get interesting.

144
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,416
Are they? I think you know
what I'm here to find out.

145
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,916
The only way you'll get me to
talk is to force it out of me.

146
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,291
Well, if you insist, then.

00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:33,208

00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:21,125
[INARI A] And you, Golden
Knight, where were you?

162
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:24,166
Would you care to tell
us what kept you away?

163
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,875
We will treat Hakamadare
here and help him to heal.

164
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:31,666
He was mumbling
something feverishly before.

165
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:36,375
Indeed, he said, "If you
falter, you will fail."

166
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:37,416
[gasps]

167
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,041
[RAIKOU]
Kintoki.

168
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:49,541
I know that I'm not supposed
to show any weakness.

169
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:54,000
But right now, if she
were here beside me...

170
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:58,125
Hey now, that is no way for
the Golden Knight to talk!

171
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:01,750
Even though, I feel
the exact same way as you.

172
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,750
She may've been difficult
most of the time,

173
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,083
but you could always
count on her

174
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:07,416
when things got rough like this.

175
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:16,583
[KINTOKI] Raikou, maybe you
should ask for some help.

176
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:22,750
[HARUAKI] So then, you've
come to me for assistance.

177
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,416
Seimei must be off fighting
somewhere by herself

178
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,250
as we speak.

179
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:31,375
[HARUAKI]
By now, Kiyome is probably--

180
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,375
[HARUAKI] Unfortunately,
the power of the Golden Knight

181
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,875
will be necessary.

182
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:44,083
Yes, I understand. I'll try
to help you find my Kiyome.

183
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,125
You mean that's possible?

184
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:50,000
Yes, but it will take
some time to prepare.

185
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,625
Please wait here.

186
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,708
[gasps]

187
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:20,083
[KAGUYA whimpers]

188
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,541
[KAGUYA]
I am--

189
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,833
The pulse that I'm
about to send out

190
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:30,958
will only reach members
of the Abe family.

191
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:35,375
If it finds Kiyome, then it will
surely respond back to us.

192
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,125
Then please, hurry.

193
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:40,333
All right. I shall begin.

194
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,416
Whoa, look at
that shiki, Raikou!

195
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,041
Quick, let's follow it!

196
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:11,083
Thank you for all
your help! See ya later!

197
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,666
You take care of her!

198
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:21,333
Oh, alas. What cruel fate.

199
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,125
[RAIKOU]
We're coming.

200
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,458
No, Brother.

201
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,375
You don't have
anything to worry about.

202
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:39,166
Raikou's proven himself
to be quite strong.

203
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,000
Brother, you mustn't fight her.

204
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,625
You can't win against her.

205
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,791
She's gotta be here!

206
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:57,791
Seimei! Seimei!

207
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,791
[DOUMAN]
Who are you looking for?

208
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:00,833
[BOTH gasp]

209
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,166
[RAIKOU]
Douman! You evil bastard!

210
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,375
[DOUMAN] You can don
the armor by yourself now,

211
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:09,666
yet, you still
call out for your Seimei

212
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,750
like a child crying
for his mother.

213
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,208
[RAIKOU]
Shut up!

214
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,500
[KINTOKI] Come down here
and say that, you coward!

215
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,750
Or maybe you know you
don't stand a chance

216
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,958
against Raikou and
Seimei together!

217
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,708
[DOUMAN]
Oh, quiet down.

218
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:24,916
After all, we were nice
enough to wait for you.

219
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,666
[RAIKOU] What the hell
are you doing here?

220
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,916
Trust me, you'll find
out soon. Patience.

221
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,416
Not to ruin the surprise,

222
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,000
but I'm not the only one
who's been looking for you.

223
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,125
You mean Douma Houshi?

224
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:41,083
[laughing]

225
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:45,375
[DOUMAN] Douma Houshi is dead.
I killed him with my own hands.

226
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:48,125
He was just a helpless,
senile old man.

227
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,500
I am the one true
Ashiya Douman!

228
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,750
There is no other but me!

229
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,958
Wait, you killed him?
Then who--?

230
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:58,666
[DARK SEIMEI] So you're the
current Golden Knight, are you?

231
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,208
[gasps]

232
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,166
Seimei...

233
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,083
I was hoping to meet you.

234
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:24,666
Sheesh, you made us
worry for nothin'.

235
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,541
[ZARUBA]
Wait, this woman is--

236
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:27,333
[gasps]

237
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:28,666
[ZARUBA]
Watch out!

238
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:33,583
[RAIKOU]
Kintoki!

239
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,416
[DARK SEIMEI]
Well, he's a tough kid.

240
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,625
Why are you doing this?

241
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,208
I don't get it!

242
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:44,541
[DARK SEIMEI]
Arch-enemies face off

243
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,625
and fight each other
to the death.

244
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,625
What's not to get about that?

245
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:49,666
[gasps]

246
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,500
Stop this!

247
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,958
Why won't you fight me?

248
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,083
Well why do I have to?

249
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,583
[DARK SEIMEI] Hard to believe
you're a Makai Knight.

250
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:10,625
[gasps]

251
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,333
Move, Kintoki.

252
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,458
Look, Raikou, I dunno
what's goin' on.

253
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,833
I don't have any idea.

254
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:30,916
However, I do know,
if you kill Seimei...

255
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,375
...no matter how valid
your reason may be,

256
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:34,958
you're always gonna regret it

257
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:37,000
and you'll never be
the same again.

258
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,208
Yeah, but--

259
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,208
I get it, you're a Makai Knight,

260
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,833
and it's your sworn duty
to protect the citizens.

261
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:47,208
But my job... Well, it's my
job to take care of you, okay?

262
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:51,125
I mean, I am your
attendant, after all!

263
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,041
Kintoki.

264
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:58,833
[yells]

265
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,291
Kintoki!

266
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:07,166
[DOUMAN] This isn't your fight.
Stay out of it, boy.

267
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,583
Come on now, I can't
give up that easily.

268
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:14,291
If I do, how will I still
be able to protect Raikou?

269
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,000
Stop! That's enough!

270
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,000
[KINTOKI grunts]

271
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,208
[gasps]

272
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,916
Is he dead this time?

273
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:32,958
[RAIKOU yelling]

274
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,583
Seimei!

275
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:36,916
[gasps]

276
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,750
Poor Raikou.

277
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,041
[ZARUBA]
Here she comes!

278
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:05,250
[ZARUBA]
Look up!

279
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:06,291
[gasps]

280
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:33,250
[ZARUBA] Put on your armor,
Raikou! Protect yourself!

281
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,625
[yelling]

282
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:43,208
What a miserable
sight to behold.

283
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,958
This is the end for
you, Golden Knight!

284
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,000
[KAGUYA]
Who's that?

285
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,291
[gasps]

286
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:00,666
[gasps]

287
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,375
[RAIKOU]
Kaguya.

288
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,250
You little...

289
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:16,666
[gasps]

290
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:24,041
This is...

291
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:33,458
She was the one who
sealed me up before.

292
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:37,916
I never expected her
to turn up here.

293
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,958
It seems we're done
for the night.

294
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,375
[DARK SEIMEI]
Well, Golden Knight,

295
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:43,875
I'll have to kill you next time.

296
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:44,958
[RAIKOU]
Wait!

297
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:52,458
No.

298
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:55,333
[KAGUYA] So it was you
that I heard, Raikou.

299
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:58,041
That painful cry from the soul.

300
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:03,625
Kaguya, why are you here?

301
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,916
Because I remember now.

302
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,125
[KAGUYA]
I'm the one...

303
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,250
...who seals away Horrors,

304
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,083
trapping them within
the Crimson Moon.

305
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:17,125
[RAIKOU]
Uh?

306
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:06,750
[INARI A] One of darkness.
One of pure light.

307
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:10,625
They will face each other
to the ends of untainted truth.
