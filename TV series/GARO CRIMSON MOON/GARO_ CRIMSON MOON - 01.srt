1
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:34,375
[CARPENTER B] I can't believe
how chilly it is today.

2
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,458
It's been like this
since this gate broke.

3
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:38,958
Cold wind keeps blowin'
through the capital.

4
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,291
I'm sure you've
heard the rumors.

5
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:46,208
Lotta people think spirits
are invading the city.

6
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:49,083
It would make sense if they
destroyed the gate next.

7
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:50,000
[CARPENTER D]
Uhh...

8
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,916
You're giving me the chills. Uh.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,958
[CARPENTER A]
Hey!

10
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:54,375
[BOTH]
Huh?

11
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:57,041
Break's over! Up off your lazy
asses and back to work!

12
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:58,916
[CARPENTERS]
Yeah, yeah.

13
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:05,041
Worthless.

14
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:07,958
They slack off soon as you
take your eye off 'em.

15
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:10,791
Not like it matters.

16
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:13,166
Not now that the
sun's gone down.

17
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,458
That's all we can do for today.

18
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:32,750
[whimpering]

19
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:37,125
Evil spirits. We're being
attacked by spirits!

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,875
Spirits are nothing
more than illusions

21
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:08,666
created by the human heart.

22
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,208
But some of these illusions
are so tainted with misery

23
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:13,458
that they consume humans.

24
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:17,125
These are known as Horrors.

25
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:18,916
You may wish to
enter the capital,

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,458
but you are forbidden from it.

27
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,083
Now return...

28
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,708
...to the darkness!

29
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,708
[HORRORS howling]

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,916
[HORROR D]
A Makai Alchemist?

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,666
Your power alone is not
strong enough to banish us.

32
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,541
[ALCHEMIST] Whatever gave you
the impression I was alone?

33
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,708
[HORROR D]
The Golden Knight?

34
00:02:58,416 --> 00:02:59,708
[HORROR D]
The bloodlines of that armor

35
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:01,708
were presumed to have
long faded from this world!

36
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:04,750
Which does help with
the element of surprise.

37
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,250
[MICHINAGA]
So beautiful.

38
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,708
Even I, Michinaga,

39
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,458
would secretly visit
you despite your age.

40
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,541
Thank you, that's kind of you.

41
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:31,291
[MICHINAGA]
You look glum, Kintou.

42
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:32,541
Something wrong?

43
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:35,291
Spirits have attacked
the Rajou Gate again.

44
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,750
And many carpenters
have lost their lives.

45
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,041
And what am I to do
with this information?

46
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,541
I'm worried, sir. There've
been numerous reports

47
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:46,125
of evil spirits
throughout the capital.

48
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,958
[MICHINAGA]
Has a single spirit ever managed

49
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,000
to breach the walls
of this Light Palace?

50
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,083
[YASUNORI] Never has
such a thing happened.

51
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:55,750
The Light Palace is secure under
the protection of the Onmyouryo.

52
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,791
We would never allow
a spirit to so much as

53
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,583
approach these grounds.

54
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:06,041
[MICHINAGA] Eternal glory
to the Heavenly Emperor.

55
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,666
And to the Light Palace.

56
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,708
[KINTOU, YASUNORI]
Yes.

57
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,375
The city may be safe
during the day,

58
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,958
but is that so at night?

59
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,875
[YASUNORI]
Only the poor travel by night,

60
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,916
the commoners who carry
no status to speak of.

61
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,416
Therefore, it's nothing
to concern yourself over.

62
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,416
Which is to say that the
spirits own the night.

63
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,125
[giggles]

64
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,125
[chuckling]

65
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:56,583
[WIFE] A gifted entertainer,
but far too mysterious.

66
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,041
How long do you intend to
allow her to stay in our home?

67
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,125
But the way she sways her hips.

68
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,625
I mean, her biwa!
Plays her biwa!

69
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,416
The guests clearly love it.

70
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,208
This Seimei woman.
She's indecent.

71
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:16,916
Please, Seimei, I'd
like you to have this.

72
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,708
A tooth of a whale,
for a toothsome lady.

73
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:23,333
[SEIMEI] Oh, from a whale?
That is quite the rare gift.

74
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:26,083
Oh! Look at that,
it even has a cavity!

75
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,875
Wonderful, it's exquisite.

76
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:30,125
A piece with such elegant
depth and history.

77
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,458
[WIFE]
No, you don't! Stop right now!

78
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:35,083
You're not giving away
a treasured family heirloom!

79
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,291
Let go of me, woman!

80
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:39,000
[WIFE] No! Not until
you come to your senses!

81
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,750
Well, then, I'll just
take these sweets.

82
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:44,166
[MASAMUNE] What? Is that
really all you want?

83
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,500
[giggles]

84
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:55,875
So, Raikou, Seimei seems to
have disappeared on us again.

85
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:59,166
[RAIKOU] I'm sure she's playing
at another aristocrat's mansion.

86
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,791
[RAIKOU]
Nothing to worry about.

87
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,916
[JUNKEI]
It's done.

88
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,166
It's so beautiful.

89
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:50,125
[SEIMEI] So, this Nio
statue won't stay put?

90
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,500
[MONK]
That's right.

91
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:54,416
We believe that he roams
the land on a nightly basis.

92
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,458
We've chosen to insert
a bodhisattva within him.

93
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:00,125
Hopefully such a measure
will quell his anger.

94
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:05,166
Oh, wonderful, he's arrived.

95
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,541
This skilled young
man is Junkei.

96
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:10,458
He is the finest Buddha
sculptor in the capital.

97
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:12,750
Thank you, Junkei.

98
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:15,375
We are genuinely grateful
for your assistance.

99
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:16,958
Think nothing of it.

100
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,916
It's no good.

101
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,958
[JUNKEI]
Huh?

102
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,083
[JUNKEI gasping]

103
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:42,375
[screams]

104
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,833
Why? Was that not
enough to satisfy it?

105
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:47,750
Could that be what the
Nio statue is telling us?

106
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,208
There was no life
in that bodhisattva.

107
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,333
[JUNKEI]
What?

108
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,291
Who's that woman?

109
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,875
[MONK]
Her name is Seimei.

110
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:01,916
Please, hold on!

111
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,583
Oh, just ignore me.

112
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,666
I simply deduced that
that carving of yours

113
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,041
must have been lifeless.

114
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,041
[JUNKEI] But the only way
to calm the Nio statue

115
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,791
is with a bodhisattva
imbued with life.

116
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,625
Maybe if I use a more
beautiful woman as a base.

117
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,208
[giggling]

118
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,208
[SEIMEI] But you can
only imbue a bodhisattva

119
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:20,458
with your own life source.

120
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:24,333
You cannot depend on another
for the strength that you lack.

121
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,583
[gasps]

122
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,166
[JUNKEI] What the hell
did you just say to me?

123
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,041
It looks like we'll make it just
in time. Don't'cha think so?

124
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,791
All we have left to do now
is finish up this final batch,

125
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,291
and then we can go exchange
them for some rice.

126
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,166
Almost done.

127
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,750
[RAIKOU sighs]

128
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,208
I could use a small break.

129
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,333
Kintoki, I'm feeling
a bit parched.

130
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:52,458
Okay.

131
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,625
Just a minute,
I'll make us some tea.

132
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,916
Sorry, Kintoki.

133
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:07,625
Hey, Raikou!

134
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,833
[RAIKOU yelps]

135
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,083
What're you doing in there?!

136
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,500
You can't pull a fast one.

137
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:15,625
You're sneaking off to
examine the Nio statue, right?

138
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,958
You got me. You've
heard the rumors.

139
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,250
A Nio statue that
goes walking at night.

140
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,875
And you believe that a
Horror might be causing it?

141
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,708
It's the job of a Makai
Knight to investigate.

142
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,833
But then what
are you gonna do?

143
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,708
The Madou Ring looks
like stone to me.

144
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:31,875
[RAIKOU]
Who cares?

145
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,833
I can eliminate Horrors
without the armor.

146
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,416
I believe I'll go with you.

147
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,125
That's my job as your
attendant, after all.

148
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,291
[RAIKOU]
Fine, do what you want.

149
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:47,916
[KINTOKI]
Uh, Raikou?

150
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,875
[RAIKOU]
Hm?

151
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,500
That's where it should be.

152
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,541
And yet it's not.

153
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,208
I suppose we better find it.

154
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:56,250
[KINTOKI]
Right!

155
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:14,250
[JUNKEI]
Now to imbue you...

156
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,708
...with life!

157
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,708
[JUNKEI]
Why?

158
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:25,416
Why do you refuse life?

159
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,250

Please, please forgive me.

162
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,208
I do not have the strength
to carve a bodhisattva

163
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,291
that will calm you.

[NIO] What is that
you wish for the most?

[JUNKEI]
Life!

166
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:50,291
I wish to carve a Buddha
coursing with blood.

167
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,500
The most beautiful
one in the world.

168
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:55,375
For that, I would
sacrifice anything!

169
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,916
[NIO]
Anything, you say?

170
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,833
I was waiting for those words.

Let's go home, Raikou.

00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,125
I can't do this on
an empty stomach.

179
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,500
You want me to starve out here?

180
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,416
Goodness. Then go home
and eat if you'd like.

No way! You need me
right by your side!

Get down!

Why're you pushing on my head?

[RAIKOU]
Shh!

187
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,125
There's a trail of blood.

188
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,750
How terrible.

189
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:57,875
Unforgiveable.

190
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,708
[SEIMEI] I take it the Buddha
sculptor, Junkei, is to blame?

191
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:06,333
Are there any signs that he's
been possessed by a Horror?

192
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,333
What? So you know the man?

193
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,791
Sure. Well, I've met him.

194
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,416
So, what did you discover?

195
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,000
Let me take a guess.

196
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:18,625
He did not successfully sculpt
a bodhisattva worthy of the Nio.

197
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:19,833
No.

198
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:22,083
He was attempting to
carve them from women,

199
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:23,666
but he didn't seem to finish.

200

[SEIMEI]
Hmm.

Oh, that's right!
Hold out your hand.

00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:28,291
[RAIKOU]
What is that?

203
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,125
A gift I received.

204
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:33,083
They're sweets with sugar
from another country.

205
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,666
Oh, wow! They're amazing!

206
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,458
Right? Right? Right?

207
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,250
No fair! I want
some sweets as well!

208
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,750
Oh, sure, Kintoki. Try it.

Whoa! It's delicious!

So the matter is settled.
I'll lend you some assistance.

What? I do not need
any help from you.

to accomplish on your own?

Not to mention the fact
that you will need

214
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:06,000
a beautiful woman
to lure him out.

215
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:09,666
I feel like you could've put up
more of an argument there.

216
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,958
Probably.

You fell right for it, Junkei.

220
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:33,916
[SEIMEI] You are trapped in
the confines of this barrier.

If you choose to
manipulate the weakness

in people's hearts, your
actions are unforgivable.

223

There are creatures
from Makai that exist

to possess humans
and consume them.

225
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,458
They are known... as Horrors.

226
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,708
Such pressure from his blade!

something like that

You handled that well.

Could he be another Horror?

Afraid not. He's actually
even worse than that.

Much worse than that.

I am the darkness.

I was born from the darkness,

and I have thus become
darkness itself.

[INARI A] There are some

no matter how much
you desire them.

The more you desire,
the more they escape you.

263
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:11,625
So why not stop desiring them?
