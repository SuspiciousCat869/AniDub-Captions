to escape your wrath.

Awaken from your forced

Now go! Reclaim your
legacy of darkness.

I tend to avoid buying

They're typically just
rubbish, but this one?

I'd never've guessed
I'd find such a gem.

That's not even close to a gem.

and that's the
junk you purchase?

Uh...

Not everyone finds bizarre

save his mother

I told you.

In this crooked life, the only
sane thing for a man to do

become without Kosode?

Are you that stupid?

I'm doing it to try
and help my mom!

126
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,250
Do you think this
will make her happy,

127

knowing that her son
has become a thief?

128

[GOBEH]
Yeah, it will!

129
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:58,500
She'll be happy if
she stops being sick!

130
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,583
And then she'll be able
to make milk again!

131

If my sister can drink
milk, she'll laugh!

132

And if my little
sister laughs again,

and even medicine!

Good job, Gobeh. I love that
it still smells like potpourri

even though there's nothing
left inside of it. Oh.

fakery is so charming!

[GOBEH]
Here, boss!

A charred corpse doll
from the city of magic!

[SEIMEI] Ohh! The wind-up
motions are such morbid fun!

No, that one's boring.

A toy for laggard
aristocrats. Too trivial.

311
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,583
Not even darkness. No.

312
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:54,250
Instead of becoming
nothingness...

313
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,708
...I would rather
become darkness!

314
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:02,916
[RAIKOU] Kintoki, the
desire to continue living,

315
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,500
is it a strength or a weakness?

316
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:06,833
Isn't it a strength?

317
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,750
But to choose to
give up your life,

318
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:11,333
is that a strength
or a weakness?

319
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:12,875
A weakness, right?

320
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:17,458
It is. I believe
that. However...

321
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,208
[SEIMEI]
You really want to know?

322
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,583
Let's find out.

323
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,291
[GOBEH]
Oh, Mom.

324
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,166
[DOUMAN]
Darkness over nothingness.

325
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,291
Such a lovely sentiment.

326
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:33,083
I must live for my children.

327
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:36,166
I can't leave them
alone in this world.

328
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:42,250
[DOUMAN] Then accept the
darkness. Just let it in.

329
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:45,958
[BABY crying]

330
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:50,833
It's okay, little sis.
Hey. C'mon. Here.

331
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:54,541
Rattle rattle! Rattle rattle!

332
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:58,166
[BABY laughing]

333
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,083
[GOBEH]
There ya go!

334
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,625
Rattle rattle!

335
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:03,875
[GOBEH chuckling]

336
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,583
My dear Gobeh.

337
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,916
Why is she...? Accept it.

338
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:13,416
It'll be okay.

339
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:18,250
Accept the darkness, damn you!

340
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,500
[DRAGON HORROR howling]

341
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,333
[roaring]

342
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,208
[whirring]

343
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,083
You came!

344
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:27,166
[roars]

345
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:33,958
[yelling]

346
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,541
Now, Seimei!

347
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:38,583
Right!

348
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,375
[RAIKOU screaming]

349
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:52,750
Raikou...

350
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,875
He can't be...

351
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,375
Raiko, no.

352
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:05,958
[yelling]

353
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,458
What the hell is
wrong with that brat?

354
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:39,250
I can't believe Gobeh's
keeping us waiting.

355
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,791
Forget it. He's better off.

356
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:55,916
Hey, Seimei.

357
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,458
What's up?

358
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,875
Can there be strength
in giving up your life?

359
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:01,208
What do you think?

360
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,458
Who knows?

361
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,208
That's a little too much for
me to wrap my head around.

362
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:06,166
[INARI B] Read the moon if
you wish to see the world.

363
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:09,166
Follow the darkness if you
wish to hunt the demons.

364
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:12,083
For the true intent
of each lies there.
