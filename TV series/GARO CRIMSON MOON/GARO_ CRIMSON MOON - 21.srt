00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:16,750
[RAIKOU]
Wait!

2
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:20,125
[YASUSUKE]
Move, Raikou! Or else!

3
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:21,666
[RAIKOU]
Yasusuke, listen!

4
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,000
Seimei is drowning in darkness,
but she can still be saved!

5
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:26,666
She just needs my help!

6
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,708
[YASUSUKE]
You're in denial!

7
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:32,791
This is for murdering
my brother!

8
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:35,125
[DARK SEIMEI gasps]

9
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,708
[YASUSUKE]
All right. You win.

10
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:45,416
I'll stop trying to kill her.

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,458
I make that vow as a
fellow Makai Knight.

12
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:53,958
But, in exchange, stopping
Seimei falls on you. Deal?

13
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:55,083
[RAIKOU grunts]

14
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:59,958
[DOUMAN]
Rudra's resurrection is near.

15
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:04,125
[INARI A]
The preparations are complete.

16
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:07,166
Inform Haruaki at once.

17
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:09,500
[KINTOKI]
You guys, look!

18
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:09,958
Uh!

19
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:11,750
Haruaki!

20
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:21,708
Raikou!

21
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:23,916
Now. We're ready!

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,125
[gasps]

23
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:28,625
Go fetch Kaguya, and
bring her to my house!

24
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:13,708
[DARK SEIMEI grunts]

[RAIKOU groans]

27
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,500
What's wrong, Golden Knight?

28
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:28,458
Finally lost the will to fight?

29
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,791
[RAIKOU grunting]

30
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:49,125
Did you really think you
could get away that easily?

31
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:53,375
[gasps]

32
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:59,208
Why is she here?

33
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,291
[DARK SEIMEI gasping]

34
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,958
[DARK SEIMEI groans]

35
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:13,791
Stop! Let me go!
What's going on here?

36
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,833
You're really trying to defeat
me with these parlor tricks?!

37
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:19,791
Oh, it was never my plan
to defeat you in this form.

38
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:22,833
What does that mean?! [grunting]

39
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:26,708
Quickly, Haruaki.
It won't hold for long.

40
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:30,625
[HARUAKI grunts]

41
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:42,250
You old fool.
What are you up to?!

42
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,541
Are you prepared for this?

43
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:46,916
Yes.

44
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,500
[RAIKOU] You want me to go
inside Seimei's heart?

45
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,291
[HARUAKI]
That's correct.

46
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:58,333
Since Rudra is bound
to Kiyome's spirit now,

47
00:04:58,416 --> 00:04:59,916
that's how we attack it.

48
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,541
[BOTH gasp]

49
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:05,083
And you, who Kiyome trusts
more than anybody else,

50
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:08,625
are the only one who will
be able to enter her heart.

51
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,125
However, if you should fail,

52
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:15,125
then I'm afraid that you
too will never return.

53
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,458
In which case...

54
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,583
[YORINOBU gasping]

55
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,291
I'll do it.

56
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,750
But Raikou, wait!

57
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:31,125
Don't worry. I promise I'll
make it back, with Seimei.

58
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,250
All right, then I'm
going with you!

59
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,166
There's no need.

60
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,625
What, why not?!

61
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,083
[RAIKOU]
Listen.

62
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,625
I know I don't have
a ton of experience.

63
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:42,875
I only just learned to
don the armor on my own.

64
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:45,416
But still, despite all that,

65
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,750
I would like to bring some honor
to the Golden Knight lineage.

66
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:53,250
So please, just let me do this.

67
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:56,875
Gallantry is not arrogance.

68
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:01,041
Whatever you say, Raikou.

69
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:02,500
[HARUAKI]
Actually, there is something

70
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,458
that you can do, Kintoki.

71
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:05,791
Great!

72
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,000
In fact, we're going to
need the combined strength

73
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,291
of everyone here.

Oh, no!

[YORINOBU]
Are you all right?

You all right?

[SEIMEI]
I'm so sorry.

99
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:38,583
Don't worry about it. Okay?

100
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:42,208
We all know you didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

101

Can you stand?

Uh... yeah.

103

so long to save you.

Yeah. He's waiting for you.

106
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:57,166
[SEIMEI]
So then, he didn't tell Raikou.

107
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,291
Come on. Let's go.

It's fine.

I'll be the one to
save you this time.

As the Golden Knight.

119

Thanks, Raikou.

And also, hopefully, as
your Makai Knight, Seimei.

the darkness....

Hm?

00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,333

Oh, you old fool.

Do you see?

130
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:22,000
She moves on her own
even when I'm not looking.

131
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,708
Although she's still incomplete.

132

He finally arrived.

133
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,541
All right. That's my cue.

134
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:36,583
Boy, have you already forgotten

135
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,666
how you were beaten
half to death?

way I'll lose this time!

Oh, how sad.

What's going on here?!

[SEIMEI] This may be
hard for you to grasp.

152

See, you're inside of me.

153
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,125
And here, my feelings are
in control of everything.

154
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:03,416
The darkness ate away at me
thanks to Douma Houshi's curse.

00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,250
Until I felt alone in the world,
leaving my heart vulnerable.

Fragile.

157
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,958
Enough that a Horror like you
could enter and take over.

158
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:14,666
Fully infecting me. But now...

159
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,291
The light has returned
to me once again.

160
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,041
I can feel it inside me.

00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,791
What are you
trying to tell me?

162
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:23,708
[SEIMEI] Here, I'll make
it simple for you.

It can't be!

171
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:17,416
[KINTOKI] See, I don't have
to actually beat you myself.

172
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,000
[DOUMAN]
Huh?

173
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:25,125
If I can just hold you off long
enough, well, y'know, we win.

174
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,125
[DOUMAN]
You pests!

175
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:31,208
You obnoxious little parasites!
No more games!

176
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:35,875
I swear, I'm going to kill you
all, right here, right now!

177
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:39,500
You did it, Raikou.
I'm proud of you.

178
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,375
[DOUMAN]
Hm?

179
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,208
Kintoki. You have done well.

180
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:09,375
Now it is my turn to help.
I won't let you die!

181
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,041
Uh?!

182
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:14,500
[DOUMAN]
There's no escaping me, rat!

183
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,750
I've grown tired of your tricks.

184

[KINTOKI groans]

187
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,833
[DOUMAN] Now you just wait there
until it's your turn to die.

188
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:32,083
This is inevitable.

189
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:41,250
All that's left is to
create another path.

190
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:44,333
[coughs]

191
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,583
Oh, no, Haruaki!

192
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:49,791
[HARUAKI] I'm fine!
Don't let your guard down!

193
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,041
Hold on to Kiyome!

194
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,791
Well, I commend you for
making it this far, old man.

195
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,041
[HARUAKI]
Douman!

196
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,625
But I will kill you,

197
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:05,041
and eliminate the Golden Knight
along with the vessel's body.

198
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,000
[DOUMAN]
So that's how it is.

199
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,625
[HARUAKI groaning]

200
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:20,125
[DOUMAN] In that case, you're
coming with me, Abe no Haruaki!

[yells]

204

[INARI A] My, my,
what a persistent fellow.

205
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,958
[KINTOKI gasping]

206

[KINTOKI]
Inari!

207
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:54,083
[INARI B] Hey, get your act
together, little bean!

208
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:59,083
[INARI C] Our superiors have
reprimanded us because of you.

209
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,958
Don't get in my way!

210
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:04,458
You took the words right out
of my mouth... you cretin.

211
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,208
It's all gone
according to plan.

212
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:07,958
Just as Haruaki said.

213
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,458
But if we lose now,

214
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:12,541
then everything until this point
will have been for naught.

215

[DOUMAN growls]

216
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:28,416

Whoa. Amazing.

00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,750
[INARI A] The little bean's
so easily impressed.

224
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,166
[KINTOKI gasps]

225
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,416
The only thing we did was
catch him off guard,

226
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,208
then swat him away.

227
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,458
That's it.
Once those two return,

228
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:14,083
then our task here will
have been completed.

229
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:17,500
What you do next is
entirely up to you.

It's okay, I've got you.

233
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,416
How's Kiyome? Is she--?

234
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,041
She's safe.

Kaguya.

236
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,083
Yes.

237
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:11,333
Promise me, Golden Knight.

238
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:12,541
Anything.

239
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,583
Promise me that you'll
take care of Kiyome.

240
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,666
[RAIKOU] What do you mean?
What's wrong?

241
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,291
Hey, Haruaki!

242
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:27,333
Haruaki, wake up!
He... can't be.

[RAIKOU grunts]
Seimei!

245
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,708
It's an onmyou spell
typically used

246
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,583
to call back the
souls of the dead.

247
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:38,541
It can be quite powerful.

248
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:43,208
However, though, you must
pay a price of equal value.

249
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,541
What kind of price?

250
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:49,000
It means that, in order for
him to bring me back here,

251
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,625
he had to become the
vessel in exchange.

Yes, yes.

After all, you've finally
been returned to me.

I'm so, so sorry.

262
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,708
There's no reason to be sorry.

263
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,708
I'm your grandfather.
That's what I'm there for.

264
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,791
I know that it was your spell.

265
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:34,625
You helped me keep the darkness
at bay and hold on to myself.

266
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,958
Well, at least as
much as I could.

267
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:43,958
That's why I was able to
last until Raikou came.

268
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:48,125
Twas the least I could do for
my beloved granddaughter.

269
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,041
If I hadn't done it,

270
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,041
well then, I never would've
been able to face

in the next life.

[SEIMEI cries]

Please, Kiyome, thank
the others for me.

00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:02,250
[SEIMEI sobs]
I will.

275
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,958
[HARUAKI] Now, you know
what you have to do.

276
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,458
I can't.

277
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,208
[HARUAKI]
You must. Use the power

278
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,625
of the Golden Knight to
destroy what's inside me.

279
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,875
I can't!

My goodness.

You haven't changed a bit,
have you, child?

282
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,291
You're as stubborn as ever.

283
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,500
I... can't.

284
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:31,958
Kiyome, can you smile
one last time?

285
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,500
Please, won't you
do that for me?

slay my grandfather.

Haruaki, why?

He gave his own life to
bring all this to an end.

298
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:08,875
I see. Then it will all be over.
