The extravagance of my home
should match my stature.

Do tread lightly, sir.

Don't let the Vice-Minister
overhear you.

He's bound to only
grow more resentful.

[MICHINAGA] And what
brings you here, Haruaki?

I was seized by the feeling
of an alarming presence.

00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:00,708
Alarming enough to drag
this withered body of mine

to speak with you.

00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:06,458
That I've been targeted
by a sinister force?

Correct.

There is no misreading
the augury.

Without a doubt, somebody has
placed a curse on Michinaga.

You would have suffered the
same terrible fate as this dog

placed curses on his family.

They found a number of cursed
items inside his mansion.

Michinaga's daughter will
soon become an imperial bride.

Undoubtedly, there are many

It is a known fact, unlawful
onmyou users lack all morality.

They regularly create
and sell curses for profit.

must be stopped.

will be punished.

And there you have it.

not a part of the Onmyouryo,

they're to be targeted and
apprehended for inspection.

Oh, please, call me Izumi.

97
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:34,250
That's why Seimei was arrested?
Because she's a Makai Alchemist,

98
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:38,000
and not an Onmyou affiliated
with the Light Palace?

She surpasses most Onmyou users.
Even Professor Yasunori.

With that lineage, I have
no clue why she chose

to be a Makai Alchemist.

Lord Michinaga is an

He should not be allowed to

But there must be
something you can do.

151
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,166
It seems that someone

It what? And how do you figure?

155
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,583
Because it's a curse
placed by a human,

00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:58,166
which rarely amounts
to more than trickery.

00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,708
And so they feel sick and
become prone to disease.

159
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:06,250
It's nothing more than a
self-fulfilling prophecy,

160
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:09,541
a subconscious deception
that manifests as truth.

161
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,708
It is simply not the place
of a Makai Knight

162
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:13,750
to interfere with
the world of man.

163
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:16,000
But you can rest assured
I will call for you

164
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,916
if another troublesome
Horror emerges.

165
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,500
[RAIKOU] Wait, but I'm
meant to protect the people!

166
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:24,166
All of them! It's my duty
as a Makai Knight!

167
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,208
You take care, Raikou.
Until we meet again.

168
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,958
So you know your
Golden Armor, Garo?

169
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,291
It harnesses the power of Makai.

170
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,708
If you're not careful and
wear the armor for too long,

171
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:45,583
it will devour you, and
transform you into a beast.

172
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:48,875
A lost soul beast to be exact.

173
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,833
I had almost reached that
point when Seimei found me.

174
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:55,250
I had lost my sanity
from wearing the armor.

175
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,875
Now don't exaggerate, Raikou.

176
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,375
You weren't even close
to going berserk.

177
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:02,750
Your form may have changed,
but your soul remained intact.

178
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,458
That's why Seimei helped you.

179
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:09,541
By sealing away the armor,
and making me dependent on her.

180
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,958
Well maybe she did
it to protect you.

181
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,541
No, that's not her.

182
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,625
We'd better go. Come on.

183
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,833
Go where, to save Seimei?

184
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:21,625
[RAIKOU] Of course. I need her

I've been led to understand

that you are the
new Ashiya Douman.

191

Then you have adequate council.

That is the name
my teacher gave me.

I wouldn't consider
being named successor

something to be proud of.

195
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,958
A variety of curses
were found in my home.

196
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:24,083
You were responsible
for them, were you not?

197

Not that I recall.

You're the only one
who could've made them.

Do not deny it.
You're radiating guilt.

201
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,833
And I'm certain you
were commissioned

202
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:35,458
by the Vice-Minister, Korichika.

203
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:38,625
He may be Michinaga's nephew,
but that changes nothing.

204
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,958
It's quite evident
he hungers for power.

205
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:44,875
He had you create those curses
to advance his position.

206
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:47,833
And if I were to confess
to such an egregious act.

207

Korichika and his
entire bloodline

would be mercilessly executed.

A powerful Onmiyoji.

In skill my equal, who chose
to embrace the darkness

rather than the light.

Throughout the land,

as he gained mastery
over curses.

He wanted people to believe
he had been cursed.

it on the Vice-Minister

of him and his family.

to naïvely believe

316
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,166
the Light Palace is protected.

317
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,791
But the gate to darkness
can be opened anywhere!

318
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,375
Don't be so foolish, Raikou.

319
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:02,666
We're outnumbered.
We need to catch Douman.

Come on, Seimei!

Release the seal on
Raikou's armor already.

[SEIMEI]
Huh.

00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,125
Oh no, Seimei!

Illuminate Raikou!

Hey, Raikou,

331
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,500
you do realize there will
never be an end to Horrors

332

no matter what you do.

333

[RAIKOU]
I am a Makai Knight.

334
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:24,916
[RAIKOU] I will destroy
every Horror I find.

335
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,125
[RAIKOU]
If that burdens you,

336
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:32,250
then you can release me
from this accursed seal!

[HARUAKI] You may have
destroyed the prison today,

344
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,666
but I believe this is
something we can overlook.

345
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,541
[SEIMEI]
Sure.

346
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:37,750
And I'll overlook the fact

347
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,750
that your boss faked
this curse business,

348
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:42,041
even though you rounded up
a horde of innocent people,

349
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,708
including yours truly.

350
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,500
Oh, and here's this.

351
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,875
I would rather you hold onto it.

352
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,958
I was unable to do
anything for you

353
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,583
when you left the house
at such a young age.

354
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,666
Giving you that is
the least I can do.

355
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,166
So please, keep it.

356
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,333
You may have chosen to take
the path of a Makai Alchemist,

357
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,250
but do not ever forget
that you hail from

358
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:05,500
the Abe family of
Onmiyoji, Kiyome.

359
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,041
So, Kiyome, huh?

360
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,791
Never call me by that name.

361
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:17,166
Why did you leave
the Abe family?

362
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,125
Well, it was rather
stifling there.

363
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:22,250
Hmph. Another lie.

364
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,125
You certainly do have
a long way to go

365
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:25,791
before you understand women.

Uh! Quit it, stupid!

And release me, already!

00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:30,416
Remove the seal
you've got on me!

369
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,000
No way.

370
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,041
Why would I ever let go of the
wonderful thing we've got going?

00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:48,250
Stay away from me.
Back, Yorimitsu!

374
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:52,583
I've come to check
on you, Father.

375
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:53,708
How are you?

376
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:04,166
Fine, Yorinobu.

377
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:10,166
No reason to worry.
Just a dream.

Tell me, Father.

379
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,666
The Golden Armor.

380
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:20,208
It should be passed down the
Minamoto family, should it not?

381
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:21,791
[SHINBOCHI]
Hm?

382
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:24,666
[YORINOBU] So how is it that a
man like that could possess it?

383
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:28,333
How, Father?

[INARI A]
Once upon a time,

there was a bamboo harvester
called Tahkaytori no Okina.

No, no, I'm sorry,
that's not this story.
