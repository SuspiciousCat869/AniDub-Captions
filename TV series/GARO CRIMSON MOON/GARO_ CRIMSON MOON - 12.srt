A Makai Knight.

6
00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:01,208
I now understand the power
that I've inherited.

7
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:03,291
It's my destiny after all.

[GORUBA]
That is so,

Silver Knight Zanga.

[RAIKOU]
Yasusuke.

11
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:11,458
So you're a Makai
Knight as well.

12
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:13,125
That's amazing.

13
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:14,375
Glad you're amazed.

14
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:16,708
This makes us brothers
in arms now!

15
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:18,291
We could fight together!

16
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:20,750
You're sorely
mistaken, Raikou.

17
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:23,500
The only will I
follow is my own.

18
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,458
And this armor
that I've acquired,

19
00:01:25,541 --> 00:01:27,041
I'll choose how I use it.

[gasps]

21
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:31,583
I will do what I want and I
will continue to do it alone.

[RAIKOU]
Hold on! Listen to me!

00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:35,416
That's not your power,
it's for the people!

[RAIKOU grunts]

Don't you preach to me.

00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:39,125
Tell me what the hell
you've even done

27
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:41,958
with this power to actually
help the citizens here?

28
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:44,875
Take a look around you.
Look at the capital.

29
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:49,333
It's just as bad as it was back
before I became a thief.

30
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:52,583
I don't intend to take the
easy path you have chosen.

31
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:53,833
Take that back!

32
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:56,000
Just who do you think
you are to insult him!

33
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,666
That's some big talk for a
self-righteous petty thief.

34
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,208
What could you possibly
know about being a knight?

35
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:05,208
[GORUBA laughs] You are
the only person I see here

36
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,791
with a big mouth, little girl.

37
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:10,416
[gasps] Well, your Madou
tool shares your manners.

38
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,208
[GORUBA] This man was accepted
by the armor and is my master.

39
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:17,416
He has inherited
the name of Zanga!

40

[YASUMASA] You could
come with me, you know.

41
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:26,583
As far as I'm concerned,
the past is just the past.

42
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:29,250
Well, I've become quite
the popular one tonight.

43
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,250
Return to the Light Palace.

[YASUSUKE grunts]

45
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:34,583
How long do you expect
to last as a thief?

46
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:39,250
Do you honestly think you'll
achieve your goals like this?

47
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:40,958
Let's go, then.

48
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,666
[KINTOU]
Impressive, isn't it?

49
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,333
It won't be much longer
now before it's finished

50
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,708
and then we'll no longer need
to worry about sickness

51
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:32,125
and evil spirits when
the Rajou Gate crumbles.

52
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,625
We won't know until we use it.

53
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,416
It's nothing to fret over.

54
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,000
With this gate and
Haruaki's barrier,

55
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:41,375
as well as the strength
of our police magistrate,

56
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,791
the security of the
Light Palace is assured.

57

His barrier.

58
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,083
Because nobody can best
the great Onmioji.

59
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:51,166
Only Abe no Haduaki can do it.

60

You know, I'd be
lying if I told you

61
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:59,791
that I wasn't quite envious
of your upcoming retirement.

62
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,541
Is there something the matter?

63
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:05,125
No. Never mind, it's nothing.

64
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,958
Ah! Delicious!

65
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:27,833
That's nice of you
to say, but y'know,

66
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:30,750
it would be nicer if you
didn't eat all of our food!

67
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:34,958
Oh, please, do you really expect
me to cook for myself every day?

68

[SHIKI DOLL]
Shiki, shiki. Shiki, shiki.

Uh? Mm...

00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:47,583
Tell me what the hell you've
even done with this power?

71
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:52,500

Don't surprise me like that!

75

And just what do you
have on your mind

76
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:02,375
that's wiped your face as blank
as a piece of parchment?

77
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:03,916
What, nothing.

78
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,041
Ah, are you finally starting
to take an interest in girls?

79
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,791
I can tell you anything
you wanna know.

80

Oh, give me a break!

81

[MICHINAGA]
Looks like you've grown stronger

82
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,875
since last we spoke.

83
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,666
[YASUSUKE] Yes, well,
it has been a long time.

84
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,250
Yasusuke, let us not
dance around the subject.

85
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,750
Would you lend me your strength?

86
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,541
[YASUSUKE] What exactly do you
wish from a thief like me?

87
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:30,500
I'd like to see you become a
warrior for the Light Palace.

88
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:33,416
And destroy all the Horrors
threatening the capital.

89
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,916
[YASUSUKE]
The capital, huh?

90
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,625
Don't you mean the things
that specifically threaten you?

91
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,041
[YASUMASA]
Yasusuke!

92
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,000
[YASUSUKE] That huge gate
you're building out there?

93
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,208
It's evident that the Light
Palace is only interested

94
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,250
in protecting themselves.

95
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,291
I don't care about
your orders.

96
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:52,583
I'll destroy every single
Horror I encounter.

97
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,833
Because that is my duty.

98
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,666
Ah-ha.

99
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,333
So there's no need for me
to directly serve under you.

100
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:00,583
[YASUMASA]
That's enough!

101
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,875
I serve only the people.

102
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:05,166
If they're human, then
I will protect them.

103

[YASUMASA] Have you forgotten
who you're talking to?

00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,541
You must be insane.

Oh, Brother.

Look at you trying to save face.

00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,375
You watch your mouth!

You haven't changed
in the slightest!

You're nothing more
than a common criminal!

This is who the armor chose?

[SEIMEI]
It's not happening!

112

Ask all you want, I'm
not removing the seal.

113
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:27,041
[RAIKOU] But I'm not
doing enough out there!

114
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:30,291
I need to save more people!
And to do that...

115
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:33,458
You're taking the judgment of
a thief way too close to heart.

116
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:36,208
I promise you that I
can control my power!

117
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,833
Give it up, I'm not doing it.

118
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,458
Besides, don't you know it's
impossible to save everyone?

119
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,708
Uh! That is the whole reason
why Makai Knights exist!

120
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,416
Such a big hero.

121
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,541
Are you even listening to
a word I'm saying to you?

00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:51,000
Quit giving me commands
like I'm your pet!

don't you calm down?

Wait, Raikou!

126
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:02,500
I swear that guy can be
such a hot head sometimes.

127
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,583
[YASUSUKE] No good will come
of working under Michinaga.

128
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:14,125
Nothing will change

Hello, Yasusuke.

130

[YASUSUKE] Hey, Yorinobu,
Long time no see.

131
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,250
[YORINOBU]
How foolish can you be?

132
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,833
Yeah, it's not too smart
to go against Michinaga.

133
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,750
[YORINOBU] And yet you still
haven't learned that lesson.

134
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,625
No? What gives you that idea?

135
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,458
[YORINOBU sighs]
Oh, a combination

136
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:29,916
of your actions and words.

137
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,291
The only way to truly lessen
the sadness and suffering

138
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:35,500
of the poor is for the
Light Palace to change.

139
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,875
I disagree.

140
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,500
That can't possibly be
the solution to everything.

141
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,750
Sure, that may be true.

142
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:44,250
But it's not enough
to stop me from trying.

Don't worry about me.

I'd rather not, but you
make it hard not to.

here, you wanna spar?

00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,208
--[SEIMEI] Uh?
--[SHIKI DOLL] Shiki, shiki.

159
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,041
[SEIMEI] We'll just have
to have faith in him.

160
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,000
But at least Kintoki's with him.

161
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:37,125
[SHIKI DOLL]
Shiki, shiki, shiki.

162
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,500
Huh?

163
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:47,250
[DOUMA] Everything
has fallen into place.

164
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,750
The fall of the Rise
Gate is all we need.

165
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,625
The perfect opportunity.

166
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,250
With all the effort they've
put into building that gate,

167
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,458
they believe it to
be their salvation.

168
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:59,958
Little do they realize, it is
in fact their destruction.

169
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,625
[DOUMA] We couldn't dream
of a more perfect cover,

170
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:05,541
but the key is what happens
directly afterward.

171
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:08,666
[DOUMAN] The light of the
capital will fade to darkness.

172
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,166
But will they really move
as you say they will?

173
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,791
[DOUMA]
Don't worry.

174
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:16,250
Just proceed with the plan
as I've explained it.

175
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,125
Now go.

176
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,500
[DOUMAN]
Yes.

177
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:26,416
[DOUMA] The die has been cast,
the result already determined.

178
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:40,416
[RAIKOU] So I thought
of you, Miss Shikibu.

179
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,583
[IZUMI]
Just Izumi, please.

180
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,250
[RAIKOU]
Right, Izumi.

181
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,791
I thought you might know.

182
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,791
[IZUMI] You need a method to
remove not a curse, but a seal.

183
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,708
I'm afraid that's
not my expertise.

184
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:53,625
Why don't you just ask Seimei?

185
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,791
She hasn't happened to
come by here, has she?

186
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,291
Are you saying she's
not come home?

187
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:58,208
Yes.

188
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,500
Well.

189
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,208
Would you like me to pass
on a message to her?

190
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,208
No.

191
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,041
Please don't tell
her I was here.

192
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,708
[SEIMEI]
That stupid Raikou.

193
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,666
He looked rather
troubled to me.

194
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,708
Such a fragile expression
on his face.

195
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,666
[SEIMEI]
He's so dutiful.

196
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,208
And it's suffocating him.

197
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,958
[IZUMI]
I'm not sure I understand.

198
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,666
How is that such a bad thing?

199
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,958
He may be a knight,
but he is still a human.

200
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:24,291
He needs a life outside
of saving people.

201
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,541
[IZUMI] So you think he
should take things easier?

202
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:29,000
He's constantly sticking
his neck out for others

203
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,791
and tightening a
noose around it.

204
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:33,916
It won't be long before
he stops breathing.

205
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,291
Raikou has a ways to go

206
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:38,083
before he understands the
weight of his own life.

207
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,916
[IZUMI]
Lost within my thoughts,

208
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,375
fireflies seem like my forlorn
soul leaving my body,

209
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,208
forever lost in the night.

210
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,375
Confusing your soul
with fireflies?

211
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:58,500
I suppose that's what enough
worrying can do to you.

212
00:11:58,583 --> 00:11:59,833
[IZUMI]
Well,

213
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:02,875
a human would be an empty
vessel without the soul.

214
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,958
You really should tell him
your feelings, you know.

215
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,750
Raikou's not the
only one at risk

216
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,916
of losing the fireflies
of his soul.

217
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,250
Oh, be quiet!

218
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,958
He won't listen
to anything I say!

219
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:15,833
And quit saying fireflies,
it makes me think of b-b-b--

220
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,041
[IZUMI]
You mean butterflies?

221
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,583
Don't say it!

222
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:21,666
[IZUMI] Fine, if you insist,
but you owe me for that haiku.

223
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,083
I am not payin' for that!

224
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:29,875
[OFFICERS murmur]

225
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:38,041
You have all done
an admirable job.

226
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,208
Abe no Haruaki will
place the barrier

227
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:41,666
during tomorrow's inauguration,

228
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,458
and afterward, the Rise Gate
will finally be complete.

229
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,208
You should feel quite proud.

230
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:47,291
It's an honor.

231
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,375
I cannot think of
a more noble task

232
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,791
than helping to construct
the object that will protect

233
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,125
the capital and our
families from disaster.

234
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,291
[KINTOU]
Indeed.

235
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,000
Michinaga would like
to say a few words.

236
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,333
[MICHINAGA]
For the greater good.

237
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,541
[ALL]
Hear, hear!

238
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:04,333
[MICHINAGA]
Haruaki, show them just once.

239
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,583
That is not wise.
It is too risky,

240
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,875
the preparations are
not yet complete.

241
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,750
[MICHINAGA] It'll be fine.
They deserve to see.

242
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,458
If that is your wish,
I'll do it.

243
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:20,791

[CARPENTERS murmur]

246
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,958
It's utterly dazzling!

247
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:34,208
[CARPENTER B] The capital is
guaranteed to be safe now!

248
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,625
[HARUAKI] I'm sorry, but that's
the most I can do tonight.

249
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:45,166
A truly impressive
feat, Haruaki.

250
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,791
I do believe tonight
calls for a celebration!

251
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,458
[BOTH gasp]

252
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:59,833
[YASUNORI] I won't leave things
like this. Abe no Haruaki.

253
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:03,083
[DOUMAN] Michinaga seems to only
rely on the skills of Haruaki.

254
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:06,416
[YASUNORI] Wha... Who said
that? I recognize you!

255
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,333
[DOUMAN] At this rate, your
family's name will be forgotten.

256
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:10,875
Speak no more!

257
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,833
[DOUMAN]
You must hate Haruaki,

258
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:16,583
but that hatred can become
your greatest strength.

259
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,000
With it,

260
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:21,833
you can become something that
surpasses all Onmioji.

261
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,666
[YASUNORI]
You shut that mouth of yours!

262
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,583
[DOUMAN] And at long last,
the Raise Gate is complete.

263
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,333
You're the one who's responsible
for that, aren't you?

264
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:30,666
Oh, don't try to tell me

265
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,333
you didn't find that
gate to be an eyesore.

266
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,291
Now tell me, Kamo no Yasunori.

267
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,458
What will your name
mean to this world?

268
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:40,208
Dignity? Or chagrin?

269
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:42,625
Hatred is the only
power you have left.

270
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,833
Hate Haruaki with
all your might.

271
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,166
I do hate that
pompous bastard.

272
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,333
I will make him understand
what true strength is.

273
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:54,291
[laughs] Beautifully said!

274
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,291
[YASUNORI screams]

275

[growls]

276
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:00,750
[DOUMAN]
Now listen.

277
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,416
The spell I've placed on you.

278
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,375
It will allow you to pass
through the barrier

279
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:07,333
of the Light Palace.
And once you're inside,

280
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:10,000
you can devour as many
people as you wish.

281

[YASUNORI growls]

282
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:15,291
[DOUMAN] And of course, that
includes the loathsome Haruaki.

Hey, Raikou!

Have you seen that?

Uh? What is it?

[SOLDIERS gasping]

292

It's too dangerous, you must
return to the Light Palace!

293
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:47,875
[YORINOBU]
Lord Michinaga,

294
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,166
please allow me to stay
behind and protect the Gate.

295
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,416
I'll allow it.

Get as far away as
you can! Hurry!

Just hang on!

Get away from there!

I won't let you
destroy that gate!

Stop!

help as many people
escape as you can.

even have your armor!

314
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,541
Hey, I've got a duty to perform.

315
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:31,750
[KINTOKI growls]

316
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,500
[RAIKOU] Ashiya Douman!

317
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,041
I should've known.

318
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:41,166
[DOUMAN] And so the feast
of darkness begins.

319
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,666
Look, don't even
worry about me.

320
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,291
Just save everyone you can.

321
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,291
[KINTOKI]
Wait!

322
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:47,791
[RAIKOU yells]

323
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:50,625
[DOUMAN] I'm afraid that
I need you to stay put.

324
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:51,416
[RAIKOU grunts]

325
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,291
[DOUMAN yells]

326
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:54,625
[RAIKOU groans]

327
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,500
Kintoki!

328
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,208
There you are.

329
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:09,041
Was this all an excuse
to drag me out here?

330
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,458
Seimei!

331
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:13,625
Why don't you leave old
patchwork face to me, all right?

332
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:23,291
I'll never grow accustomed to
seeing that exasperating light.

333
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:23,916
[SEIMEI]
Go!

334
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,333
Raikou!

335
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,583
[RAIKOU]
Everyone! Escape now!

336
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,458
[RAIKOU]
Damn! There's no end to it!

337
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:39,250
[SEIMEI grunts]

338
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:40,416
[DOUMAN grunts]

339
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:43,500
[SEIMEI]
What is this?

340
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,458
Why isn't he fighting back?

341
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:52,583
He really is such a poor
excuse for a knight.

342
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,375
This ought to whip
him into shape.

343
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:55,166
[HORROR A roars]

344
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,583
[SEIMEI gasps]

345
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,791
[SEIMEI] Raikou!
You need to stop Douman!

346
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,250
[RAIKOU]
I'm on it!

347
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm relieved to see you're safe.

348
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:14,875
Yes.

349
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,958
[KINTOU]
Please, go inside.

350
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,916
Close and seal the gates.

351
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:29,041
[SEIMEI] I've gotta stop
that thing. [yells]

352
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:41,416
[RAIKOU groaning]

353
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,125
Keep struggling,
there's no escape.

354
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,125
[grunts]

355
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,916
[RAIKOU]
Sei... mei...

356
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,291
[DOUMAN]
You sit still and watch.

357
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,375
[RAIKOU grunting]

358
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,833
[SEIMEI pants]
Damn you!

359
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:06,458
[DOUMAN] This seems like a good
time to bring things to an end.

360
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:09,000
[RAIKOU screams]

361
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:09,916
[DOUMAN]
Hm?

362
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,208
He's grown stronger.

363
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,208
I've toyed with
them for too long!

364
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,083
[DOUMAN grunts]

365
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,583
[RAIKOU yelps]

366
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:35,083
[DOUMAN laughs] Allow me to
put you out of your misery.

367
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,458
This is where we say goodbye.

368
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:40,041
[SEIMEI]
Raikou!

369
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:49,500
Dammit, Douman, you bastard!

370
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,208
You're welcome to
delay the death

371
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:54,083
of your precious Raiko
for as long as you want.

372
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,333
But you have to decide

373
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:58,666
between saving him or
the people around you.

374
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,791
You must choose one
and sacrifice the other.

375
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:04,125
Oh, such a difficult
predicament.

376
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:07,000
Seimei. What will you do?

377
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:10,916
Please.

378
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,166
Seimei.

379
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,041
[SEIMEI whimpers]

380
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:17,666
Just forget about me.
Save the people!

381
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,708
[SEIMEI gasping]

382
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:23,041
We can't just let him die!

383
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,708
Kiyome. no!

384
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,416
No, I can't.

385
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,708
Raikou!

386
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,833
Seimei, no!

387
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:49,416
[HORROR A roars]

388
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:57,750
[HARUAKI grunts]

389
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,458
[DOUMAN laughs]

390
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:02,416
[MEN groaning, screamin]

391
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,916
[HARUAKI]
How could we let this happen?

392
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,916
[SEIMEI]
Are you all right?

393
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,833
[RAIKOU]
Why did you save me?

394
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:50,708
[RAIKOU]
How many died in my place?

395
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:53,208
Answer me, Seimei!

396
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:56,375
How many times do I have to tell
you that we can't save everyone?

397
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,875
[RAIKOU]
But we could have saved them!

398
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:01,000
How much will you
make me suffer?

399
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:02,041
[SEIMEI]
I saved you!

400
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:03,291
At what cost?

401
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:06,375
You chose me and you let
all of those people die.

402
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:09,625
Now we're responsible
for their deaths.

403
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:13,666
[RAIKOU]
This is the end.

404
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,291
[SEIMEI gasping]

405
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:20,541
[DOUMA] The things you love
are brimming with radiance.

406
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:22,250
Douma Houshi.

407
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:23,500
[DOUMA]
I wonder...

408
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:26,333
Is it even possible for
him to forgive this?

409
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:28,958
How could he ever
partner with you again?

410
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:31,083
[SEIMEI gasps]
I should have known

411
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:32,791
this has been your
plan all along.

412
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:36,083
To separate us, so you could
seal away the Golden Knight.

413
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:38,583
That's what you wanted,
wasn't it?!

414
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:42,083
[DOUMA] Perhaps you're beginning
to see the light, Seimei.

415
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:43,875
Finally.

416
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:58,583
Raikou. Oh, no.

417
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,958
[INARI A] When lost within
the pitch black darkness.

418
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:11,041
You must only wait for the
starlight of dawn to guide you.
