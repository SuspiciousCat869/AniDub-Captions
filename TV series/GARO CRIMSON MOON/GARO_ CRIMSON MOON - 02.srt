1
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:26,833
Go, Kintoki.

2
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:28,291
Right, I'm on it!

3
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,708
He doesn't seem to be a Horror.

4
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:37,625
You look worse than ever.

5
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:39,625
If you continue down this path,

6
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:42,250
the darkness is bound
to consume you.

7
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,541
[laughing]

8
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:47,000
And that is precisely my wish.

9
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:32,083
Right there.

10
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:38,833
[SAMURAI gasping]

11
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:41,208
It appeared. We've finally
found the evil spirit

12
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:43,000
that's been plaguing the area.

13
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:45,541
[laughing]

14
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:50,125
[MAN]
My, such a fine sword.

15
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,583
I shall take it.

16
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:55,416
That sword belongs to me!

17
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,375
I believe that we should
let the sword itself

18
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,333
choose a worthy possessor.

19
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:00,208
Hah.

20
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,250
Oh, who will it choose?

21
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:20,125
[SAMURAI screaming]

22
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:34,166
Lovely. So exquisite. I adore
the way it's cracked right here.

23
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,708
[RAIKOU]
Seimei.

24
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,166
Hey, Seimei.

25
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,125
You mind your tone. So rude.
I'm clearly busy, Raikou.

26
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:42,416
I'd rather you not interrupt

27
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,500
when I'm in the
middle of something.

28
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:46,375
May I see that one
as well, please?

29
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,625
[RAIKOU]
Who was that guy earlier?

30
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,875
Ashiya Douman.

31
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,666
So then you do
actually know him?

32
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,291
Well, who is he?
A Makai Alchemist?

33
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,916
On second thought, this
one's not to my taste.

34
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,250
[gasps]

35
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:12,958
[OFFICER A] Should we fan out
and search the area?

36
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:24,541
Oh, Seimei. And how
are you this fine day?

37
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,083
Oh, how am I?

38
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,291
I'd say I'm not in the mood
to be intimidated or bullied.

39
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:31,000
And no, not even by the head
of the police magistrate

40
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,791
such as yourself, Kintou.

41
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,666
Now, if you'll excuse me.

42
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,416
[KINTOU]
No, not so fast.

43
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,625
I'd like to know when
you will finally relent

44
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:42,125
and accept the
affections of Michinaga.

45
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:45,250
You cannot simply disappear
and run away forever.

46
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,041
Look over there, sir.

47
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,208
[KINTOU]
Hm?

48
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,375
[SEIMEI]
Run away!

49
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,791
[SEIMEI laughs]

50
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:57,541
Hah. Just let her run.
We will eventually catch her.

51
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,083
The city is plagued by Horrors
and the police chase after me.

52
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,583
It's like the fools
don't even care.

53
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:14,208
[INARI A] Oh, but the same
could be said of you.

54
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,166
[gasps]

55
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,833
[INARI A]
Makai Alchemist Seimei,

56
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,333
you are summoned to
the Watchdog Center.

57
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,833
[SEIMEI]
Oh. Today's not a good day.

58
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,541
Hey. Wait. Hold on!

59
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:40,125
Oh, really? I see they
dragged you in as well, huh?

60
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,166
I assure you that
I am nothing like her.

61
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,875
There's no need for
you to ambush me.

62
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,541
[SEIMEI]
Ha.

63
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:49,875
It's been quite some time.
Dear Seimei. Raikou.

64
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,875
You must have
information on a Horror.

65
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,166
That's why you called us.

66
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,875
Why else would you
summon us here?

67
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:58,250
After all, that is the point of
this Eastern Watchdog Center.

68
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,833
[SEIMEI]
We've already been over this.

69
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,166
You keep offering me jobs,

70
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,916
but I don't have the
time to take them.

71
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,875
Is that so? Are you too busy
hunting Horrors on your own?

72
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,291
That's right.

73
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,541
The two of us do just fine
without your instruction.

74
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,833
You spend all your time
searching for strange items

75
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:13,750
for your collection.

76
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:14,875
[SEIMEI grumbles]

77
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,750
[INARI A]
Your reluctance is a problem.

78
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,333
This request was
specifically made

79
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,166
for the two of you after all.

80
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,291
--[RAIKOU] I accept!
--[SEIMEI] I refuse!

81
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:23,666
[growling]

82
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,708
[gasps]

83
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:29,416
Is tha-that what
I think? Say no.

84
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,791
Yes. A butterfly.

85
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,875
Please! Get it
off me! Right now!

86
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,750
Get it off! I'm begging you!

87
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,000
Oh, that's right.

88
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,916
I had forgotten that you
don't like butterflies.

89
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,791
I never said that!
I said I hate them!

90
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:44,250
Ugh! No! Its pollen's
gonna get in my mouth!

91
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,666
That is unfortunate.

92
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:49,208
Especially since there
are so many of them.

93
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,833
[SEIMEI yelping]

94
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:54,291
You're actually
resorting to torturing me?

95
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,250
[INARI A] It's fine if
you don't want the job.

96
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,416
You do seem quite busy.

97
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,750
No, I'll do it!

98
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,666
I'll do any job you want,
just make them go away!

99
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,125
Wonderful. You are
such a selfless child.

100

My name is Katsuragi
no Hisayori.

101
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,416
[KINTOKI] So you've
been assigned to study

102
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,916
as Raikou's apprentice?

103
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:21,625
I guess, technically, you
already are a Makai Knight, huh?

104
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,750
You just haven't inherited
your armor yet.

105
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,041
Do you think
you'll get it sooner

106
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,500
by shadowing your seniors?

107
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,458
Is that what you're hoping
to learn from him?

108
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:29,875
Well, of course.

109
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:32,333
I'm hoping to learn everything.
With your guidance.

110
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:35,833
Uh. Well, I-I still have quite
a long way to go myself.

111
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,708
I'm glad to hear
you realize it.

112
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,208
[RAIKOU grumbles]

113
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,833
Oh, no. I've heard the tales
of your great achievements.

114
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,083
You managed to summon
the Golden Armor.

115
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,750
And it was believed to
have been gone forever.

116
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:50,125
Well, that's not really as
amazing as it might sound.

117
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,791
It's everything I aspire to.

118
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,791
I need to inherit
my father's armor.

119
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,000
Oh, wow.

120
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,041
So your father was a
Makai Knight as well?

121
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,958
A little light.

122
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:03,625
We're already struggling to
put food on the table, y'know.

123
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:07,291
Yet the great senior has chosen
to add another to our budget.

124
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,333
Where is the alchemist?

125
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,666
[KINTOKI, RAIKOU gasp]

126
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:24,166
Whoa, whoa hey! Why don't
you have any clothes on?

127
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,500
I'm trying to make sure
none of that loathsome pollen

128
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:27,875
was left on my skin.

129
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,000
[RAIKOU]
The butterfly pollen?

130
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,708
Don't even say the name!

00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,708
[RAIKOU yelps]

132
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:33,750
Oh, he's fine.

133
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,625
Could you wipe down
my back for me?

134
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:36,791
Huh? Yeah!

135
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,000
No, not you.

136
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:41,291
Oh, sorry, you were asking me?

137
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:44,875
[SEIMEI] So, Hisayori,
the Watchdog Center said

138
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,958
that you requested to
apprentice under us.

139
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,083
[HISAYORI]
Well, your renown precedes you.

140
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:54,041
Oh, is that all? Could it be
you're interested... in me?

141
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:57,333
No, ma'am. I wish to learn the
sword style of Master Raiko.

142
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:58,500
That so?

143
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,250
You're just another
idiot eager to fight

144
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:03,375
because it's the so-called
duty of a protector.

145
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,916
A protector? Not me.

146
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,666
I wish I could.

147
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,208
But I couldn't protect anyone.

148
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,708
[KINTOKI] There have been
a series of brutal attacks

149
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:23,250
on warriors who
possess famous swords.

150
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,791
A Horror?

151
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,916
Now that you mention swords,
yours is quite famous as well.

152
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,958
I was hoping that you might
allow me to take a look at it.

153
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,000
That one?

154
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:37,666
[RAIKOU] It's nothing special.
I've had it for a long time.

155
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,958
Have you, really?

156
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,125
Did you happen to inherit
it from your father?

157
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,083
[RAIKOU]
No. I did not.

158
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,000
I actually never knew the man.

159
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:53,250
I was abandoned as a child.
Outside the capital.

160
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:08,125
[IZUMI] Kahtsuragi no
Hisayori, that's his name?

161
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,333
[SEIMEI] I feel you're the
only one I can trust with this,

162
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:11,333
Miss Shikubi.

163
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,916
Oh, no, please. Call me Izumi.

164
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,291
I must say it's rare for you
to depend on me for anything.

165
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,875
I have a rather bad
feeling about this one.

166
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,500
[IZUMI]
Oh, yes, of course.

167
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,083
He's the son of
Katsuragi no Chiharu.

168
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,666
He was a Makai Knight,

169
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,625
a warrior devoted to
fighting evil spirits.

170
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:35,333
He was also suspected of taking
part in a rebellion in the East.

171
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:38,083
So I'm assuming he
escaped from the capital?

172
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,458
I'm scared, Father.

173
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:56,500
[CHIHARU] You mustn't be,
Hisayori. You must live on!

174
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,208
[IZUMI]
One step outside the capital,

175
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,083
and you're in a world
controlled by spirits.

176
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:04,625
It is written that Chiharu
died in this savage land.

177
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:13,416
[SEIMEI] Then the Makai
Knight father fell in battle.

178
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,166
And only his son returned
to the capital alive.

179
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,333
Life can be so tragic.

180
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,333
[gasps]

181
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,500
Well, if it isn't Seimei.

182
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,750
Minister of the Left.

183
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,625
Are you still not quite ready
to accept your place by my side.

184
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,125
[SEIMEI]
Oh, how you jest.

185
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,750
[YORINOBU] That woman just now,
do you know who she was?

186
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,750
Someone who lives by night.

187
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,916
Much like those evil spirits.

188
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,125
[MICHINAGA] She was actually
born of high status.

189
00:11:58,208 --> 00:11:59,375
Such a waste.

190
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:02,833
She chose to surround
herself with darkness.

191
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,458
Our informants told
me she came here

192
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,916
to speak with Izumi
Shikibu about the West.

193
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,625
Yes, of course she did.

194
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:20,625
--[thud]
--[KINTOKI] Who's there?

195
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:21,833
[HISAYORI gasps]

196
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,333
What do you think
you're doing in here?!

197
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,791
[RAIKOU]
Kintoki!

198
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,666
Raikou, quick, there's a thief!

199
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,750
It's you, Hisayori.

200
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:50,416
I don't understand.

201
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,875
[laughing]

202
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:58,583
That sword. It belonged
to my father.

203
00:12:58,666 --> 00:12:59,833
[RAIKOU]
Your father?

204
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,791
My father is dead.
He was murdered.

205
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:06,375
The fact you hold his sword
is proof you're his murderer!

206
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:07,916
[RAIKOU]
That can't be.

207
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,541
Careful, Raikou.
He's become a Horror.

208
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,250
Did you hear me?

209
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:22,458
I know that you killed
him, you bastard!

210
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,875
[SEIMEI] To think an
apprentice Makai Knight

211
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,125
could be possessed by a Horror.

212
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:41,416
There's no way the
Watchdog Center was unaware.

213
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,708
They looked the other way
and dumped this burden on us

214
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:44,916
to deal with.

215
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,458
It sure would've
been nice of them

216
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:50,041
to have given us some kind of
a warning, but here we are.

217
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,250
[SEIMEI] Come, Raikou,
let's take care of him.

218
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,708
What's the matter?

219
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:59,750
I need to know.
How'd I get this sword?

220
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:03,500
Good question.
Definitely worth asking.

221
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:08,208
[RAIKOU] What if he's right?
What if I did do it?

222
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,458
I may have murdered his father.

223
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:28,375
Are you entirely certain
this child is his son?

224
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:29,958
[KINTOKI]
Yes.

225
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:33,666
Even though he's the first-born,
he was exiled from the capital.

226
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,250
Along with his mother.

227
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,083
We couldn't save them.

228
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,958
We tried, but there was
nothing that we could do.

229
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,500
The descendant of
a Makai Knight.

230
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:46,541
Let's hope we're lucky enough
to find him still alive.

231
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,166
Look. A Horror.

232
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:03,916
Not quite.

233
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,458
[growling]

234
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,166
I demand that you reveal
your true form to me!

235
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,458
Horror?

236
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,416
[SEIMEI] They flocked and
attacked in hopes of a feast,

237
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,250
like moths to a flame.

238
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:34,208
[SEIMEI] And what is this food
that would attract so many?

239
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:35,750
Show yourself!

240
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,500
[KINTOKI]
It can't be!

241
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,583
He must've subconsciously
summoned the Golden Armor.

242
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,916
And he's managed to survive.

243
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,666
Unless, the armor has chosen
to protect this child.

244
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:04,000
[SEIMEI]
The Madou Ring.

245
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,958
I am Zaruba. Who stands
alongside the Golden Knight.

246
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,291
The longer a Makai
Knight dons their armor,

247
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:14,916
the greater the danger.

248
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,500
[ZARUBA] The armor might
consume their body and soul,

249
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:20,375
preventing them from returning
to their original form.

250
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,458
A lost soul beast.

251
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:26,333
But this child was able
to maintain his humanity?

252
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,541
He is a chosen child.

253
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,041
It is decided.

254
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:47,458
He will be my Makai Knight.

255
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,875
[RAIKOU] I have no
recollection of that time.

256
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:58,625
A legion of Horrors attacked me,

257
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:02,458
and I was on the verge of
becoming one of them myself.

258
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:04,916
There's a chance I might've
killed Hisayori's father.

259
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,041
And what difference would it
make if you had killed him?

260
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:09,666
To begin with,
you don't even know

261
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,208
if that sword actually
belonged to his father.

262
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:15,125
It's never wise to believe
the word of a Horror.

263
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:19,000
So then, what will you do?

264
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:22,041
I'll return his father's
sword to him. That's what.

265
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,000
Remember, he is a Horror.

266
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,291
It would be pointless for you

267
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:28,291
to return a sentimental
keepsake to him.

268
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:29,875
He lost his father.

269
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:32,291
And surrounded by Horrors,

270
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:37,041
his only chance for survival
was to become one himself.

271
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:39,208
I was just like him.

272
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,458
If you hadn't found me...

273
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:43,500
Enough feeling
sorry for yourself.

274
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:44,958
On your feet!

275
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,083
You won't return it?!

276
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:01,083
Then I suppose we'll have to
leave the decision to the sword.

277
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,125
Who's the rightful owner?

278
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:11,708
Who's it going to be?
Who will you choose?

279
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,750
Hisayori, your old master's son?

280
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:17,333
Or Raiko, the very
man who murdered him?

281
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,458
[RAIKOU]
If the sword does have a will,

282
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:22,791
it will know the
truth, and then...

283
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:25,000
You better not be thinking
something so stupid

284
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:28,666
as to actually let a sword
make this decision.

285
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:32,166
I'm sorry, but I will not
allow you to do that, Raikou.

286
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,041
That choice is not
yours to make.

287
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:37,416
I decide whether
you live or die.

288
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,083
[RAIKOU] I'm the only one
who controls my life.

289
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:46,458
It would seem that the sword
has chosen to take your life!

290
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,291
[yelling]

291
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,250
Listen to my words, sword.

292
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,666
I've been held captive
by the darkness.

293
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,708
And that is why I now
yearn for the light.

294
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,458
So I'm asking you...

295
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,916
...help me to
protect that light!

297
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,791
Looks like the sword
knows what it's doing.

298
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,083
It chose Raikou!

299
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:17,791
But, Father... how could you?

300
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,291
How could you?!

Seimei.

302
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:32,000
Don't you start
ordering me around.

you encountered, Raikou.

Minamotono Yorimitsu
is his birth name.

[OLD MAN]
You two have much in common.

You're both cursed children.

It's absolutely splendid!

Obviously. I can see
the family resemblance.

317
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,291
[SEIMEI chuckles]

318
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,125
This is the Makai Knight
who owned your sword.

319
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:19,958
I don't understand. What was he
doing with his father's skull?

320
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:23,000
Simply put, Hisayori
ate his father.

321
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,041
[gasps]

322
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:31,833
[SEIMEI] Hisayori was desperate
to escape his guilt.

323
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:35,000
So he convinced himself the one
who carried his father's sword

324
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,500
was the true killer.

325
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:38,541
[ZARUBA]
But the truth,

326
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,416
the sword came into
your possession

327
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,416
in order to defeat Hisayori.

328
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,916
You knew all along, didn't you?

329
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,125
I don't understand why
you wouldn't tell me.

330
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:51,250
I was starting to honestly
believe I had killed his father.

331
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:52,958
Hisayori became a Horror,

332
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:54,666
but you were strong
enough to resist.

333
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:58,125
And that is the only difference
between the two of you.

334
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,416
Don't act so surprised,

335
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,333
you're the one who said
you were the same.

336
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:02,875
On the path of a Makai Knight,

337
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:05,791
you'll have to continue to
hunt others just like you.

338
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:08,000
I needed to confirm
your resolve.

339
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:12,708
This woman worries for you
in her own complicated way.

340
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,000
As to why--

341
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:17,000
You talk too much.

342
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:18,541
[KINTOKI chuckles]

343
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:19,916
What's so funny?

344
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,583
[KINTOKI chuckling]

345
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:23,750
[SEIMEI]
Come on, out with it!

346
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:26,500
[KINTOKI]
No, no. It's nothing.

347
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:29,041
[SEIMEI]
And yet you keep laughing.

348
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:05,333
[INARI A] Creatures
gather toward the light.

349
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:08,458
Humans and insects,
they are both the same.

350
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:12,041
But is it the same desire
that drives them?
