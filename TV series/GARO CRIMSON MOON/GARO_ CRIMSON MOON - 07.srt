1
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:22,500
We just keep walking in circles.

2
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:25,125
There has to be an entrance.

3
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:27,625
Yasumasa why don't
you and Yorinobu

4
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:30,958
run on ahead and figure out
how to get in this place.

5
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:33,541
[yelping]

6
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:38,916
[MASAMUNE]
Hm?

7
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:47,666
[HARUAKI] Well if it isn't
Masamune, what a surprise.

8
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,083
How nice.

9
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:52,500
Oh, and you've brought
Yorinobu and Yasuma with you.

10
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:55,541
So what's the occasion
for this unexpected visit?

11
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:57,500
I'm guessing that
you're here on behalf

12
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:59,500
of the Minister of the Left?

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,791
[MASAMUNE, YORINOBU gasping]

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,416
[HARUAKI]
As I'm sure you've noticed,

15
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,333
it's been quite
dangerous lately.

16
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:15,500
We've been careful to keep
the grounds locked up.

17
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,375
[MASAMUNE]
Uh?

18
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:27,208
My, look at those lovely
creatures. [laughs]

19
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:29,791
Tell me, you old dog, just
where have you been hiding

20
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:31,958
these beautiful women
all this time?

21
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:33,291
I do have to say,

22
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:36,291
you are quite the progressive
Onmyouji, Haruaki.

23
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:37,625
This is certainly not...

24
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:40,541
About what we discussed.
Well, I've been concerned.

25
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:44,041
You mean Ahshiya Douman?
You should be concerned.

26
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:47,041
Yes. I've heard stories
of his skills.

27
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:49,208
Back when I was just a child.

28
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:50,666
You've dealt with him before.

29
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,000
I've been told the two of you

30
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:54,291
often pitted your abilities
against one another.

31
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:55,833
So I wonder,

32
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:59,416
is it true that he's able to
easily curse others to death?

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,833
Yes, that's true, but...

34
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:05,833
the Ashiya Douman who currently
carries that dreadful name,

35
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:08,083
he is not the man you speak of.

36
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:10,625
[YASUMASA] You mean a pupil
who inherited the name?

37
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:13,416
Regardless, we've seen
that his skill is true.

38
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,041
And Michinaga is fully
determined to have that man

39
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:17,625
serve by his side.

40
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:21,291
Do you personally believe that
to be a wise decision, Yasumasa?

41
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:22,333
[YASUMASA]
Hm?

42
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:25,750
The man can kill others
with mere chanting.

43
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:29,041
Not to mention he can also
summon forth evil spirits.

44
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,500
Is he that powerful?

45
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,208
[MASAMUNE]
Are you two sticks in the mud

46
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,916
going to discuss serious
business all night?

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,291
Can't you see that we're
surrounded by beautiful ladies?

48
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,041
Um. Masamune.

49
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:42,583
I'm pretty sure these women
are actually shikigami.

50
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,083
[MASAMUNE]
Oh, come now.

51
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:45,791
What's wrong with you, Yorinobu?

52
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,583
Have you gone blind?

53
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:50,500
Such a stupid supposition
makes me worry for the future

54
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:53,541
of the Genji family. [hiccups]

55
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,250
Uh, are you okay?

56
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:56,125
[MASAMUNE]
Meow.

57
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:57,375
Uh! Meow?

58
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:58,750
Why don't you sit down.

59
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,708
I think you've had
too much drink.

60
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:01,833
[MASAMUNE groans]

61
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:04,666
[HARUAKI]
No, that's not what this is.

62
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:09,916
[growls]

63
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,416
Did someone put
catnip in his wine?

64
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,250
It's an evil spirit.

65
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:16,291
[MASAMUNE growling]

66
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,875
[YORINOBU]
So he's possessed.

67
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,833
[MASAMUNE growls]

68
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,541
[MASAMUNE groans]

69
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,375
It's coming!

70
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,125
[FEMALE VOICE]
Kiyome.

00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,791
[HARUAKI exhales]

00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:48,291
[FEMALE VOICE]
Kiyome!

73
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,625
What's going on here?

74
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,041
[KINTOKI]
Stop right there!

75
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,041
[RAIKOU growls]

76
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,666
So we finally caught
you in the act.

77
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,458
We know you're the one
behind this. Seimei!

78
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,250
[SEIMEI]
Oh... What is it?

79
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,208
Do you realize how early it is?

80
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,750
[yawns]

81
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,916
Oh, what are you up to,
Shikinyan?

82
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,333
What, you named it?

83
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:06,125
Well, of course, why
wouldn't I name it?

84
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:09,208
Do you like Shiki-Shiki
more? Or Shikicchi?

85
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,083
I really don't care
what you call it.

86
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:12,583
You wanna explain this?

87
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,500
The money I've been
saving up for Raikou

88
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,583
has been steadily going missing.

89
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:19,000
And now we know
the exact reason why.

90
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,916
[SHIKI DOLL A]
Shiki, shiki, shiki, shiki.

91
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,916
Uh. Look, it can't be
helped, all right?

92
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,541
There's a Buddha statue
I've just got to have.

93
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:29,458
It's only this big, but
it's carved so ornately.

94
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,250
[SEIMEI]
You want your palm read?

95
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,458
Hand it over, Seimei, right now!

[gasps]

97
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:40,083
[KINTOKI] You've stolen
a total of 3,677 mon,

98
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,625
and you will return
every last bit of it!

99
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,583
I... Well, I've already used it

100
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,500
for a down payment
on the statue.

101
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,666
Then you better get
dressed and get it back.

--[YASUMASA] Excuse us!
--[door opens]

[KINTOKI]
Uh?

104
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,583
Hello. Can I help you?
Yasumasa, right?

105
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,541
[KINTOKI]
And you're Yorinobu.

106
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,125
Sorry to surprise you.

107
00:06:58,208 --> 00:06:59,750
We're here to speak with Seimei.

108
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,750
We have a favor to ask of you.

109
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,000
What, no way!

110
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,000
First off, I don't do favors.

111
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,208
And I'm done dealing
with you aristocrats.

112
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,916
So I don't want any part
in whatever this is.

113
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,416
You're not thinking
this through.

114
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,208
If you do a favor for Michinaga,

115
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:16,416
I'm sure you'll be able to milk
him for a nice, hefty reward.

116
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,500
Big deal.

117
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,291
Thirty-six hundred
seventy-seven mon.

118
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:22,833
[SEIMEI groans]
Back me up against a wall.

119
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:25,458
Fine but you two
are coming with me!

120
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:31,083
What? Is there not an entrance?

121
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,583
Wait for us here.

122
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,458
What the hell is going on here?

123
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:44,666
If what I've heard is true,

124
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,000
this is the house that
Seimei was born in.

125
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,958
Wait, did you say
where she was born?

126
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,208
Forget about that.

127
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:52,500
I have a question for you.

128
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,916
All right, go ahead. What is it?

129
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,750
Do you...

130
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,500
You and Seimei...

00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,000
[growls] Are...

132
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,541
Are you two sleeping together?

133
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,125
[RAIKOU]
U... Uh...

134
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:11,666
[SEIMEI]
Heh.

135
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,125
It looks like things got
a little out of hand here.

136
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,875
What, did the greatest
Onmyouji of this generation

137
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,791
have a shiki turn on him?

138
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,291
[MICHINAGA]
Try a Horror.

139
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,291
A Horror. Really?

140
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:25,958
I'm curious, Michinaga.

141
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,625
Did you recently become a
Makai Knight or Alchemist?

142
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,791
Because, otherwise, you're not
exactly an expert on Horrors.

143
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,000
Kiyome!

144
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:34,875
[MICHINAGA]
Evil spirits from another plane.

145
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,708
The world of Makai.

146
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:40,208
They possess humans, and
ultimately consume them.

147
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,041
That's correct.

148
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:44,541
Well, Seimei.

149
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:47,000
I command you to
eliminate this Horror.

150
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,916
Well, too bad, I refuse.

151
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,041
I've already warned you
that this would happen.

152
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,333
[MICHINAGA]
Hm...

153
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:57,791
Horrors are attracted to the
dark emotions of mankind.

154
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:01,666
And this specific Horror, I'm
afraid that it involves you.

155
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,833
Involves me? And how is that?

156
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:05,708
I heard it calling for you.

157
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,166
It said Kiyome.

158
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,416
[SEIMEI]
Uh!

159
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,166
[HARUAKI] The true name
you were given at birth.

160
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,250
Only one Horror would know
to call out that name.

161
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,583
It can't be.

162
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:28,250
[KINTOKI]
Uh!

163
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,416
We've finished our discussion.

164
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,208
You may both return home now.

165
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,583
Wait, where's Seimei?

166
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:39,000
That's nothing for you
to be concerned about.

167
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:43,166
Well I am concerned!
Without her, I...

168
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,166
Don't get bent out of shape.

169
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,041
She wants to do this job alone.

170
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,875
Alone?

171
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,375
[KINTOKI]
So, um...

172
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:54,416
A job commissioned by the
Minister of the Left himself.

173
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,958
I bet that came
with a nice reward.

174
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,791
As expected of Seimei,

175
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:01,166
she took quite a hefty
amount from me.

176
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,791
Uh! Payment up front?!

177
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:35,708
Now, what's wrong?

178
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:38,458
Don't tell me that's all
the strength you have left.

179
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,833
Just a bit more now,
you can do it.

180
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:44,250
[SEIMEI] Looks to me like you're
having some trouble there.

181
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:49,416
[DOUMAN]
Seimei. So you've come.

182
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,166
[SEIMEI]
Haven't you already done this?

183
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,500
Do you have any other plans

184
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:56,625
than awakening every
sealed up Horror you find?

185
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,625
Where's your imagination?

186
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,791
I'm simply acting
on shear logic.

187
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,625
The fact that both Horrors you
speak of were sealed away

188
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,541
means that the previous
Makai Knights

189
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,000
were unable to defeat them.

190
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,000
[SEIMEI]
And this particular Horror.

191
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,750
It's Princess Katsoorako.

192
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:13,458
You're trying to
awaken my mother.

193
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,541
[DOUMAN chuckles]

194
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:20,041
[RAIKOU] Wait, Seimei is
the daughter of a Horrror?

195
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:23,500
[INARI A] Oh! If you could
only see your face!

196
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,500
Are you that surprised?

197
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:28,250
But, Horrors, they...
can they birth children?

198
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,708
Of course they can't,
absolutely not.

199
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:33,083
And even if they could,
the moment it was born,

200
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:36,083
they would chop off its head.

201
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,458
[RAIKOU]
Then it's not true.

202
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:38,625
It's a lie.

203
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,541
Try using your brain.

204
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,833
The poor woman obviously
became a Horror

205
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,666
after she gave birth to Seimei.

206
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,125
Oh.

207
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:49,291
[INARI A] Seimei's father,
Abe no Shidamaru,

208
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,166
was expected to take
over the Abe family.

209
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,458
But that never happened, as
he mysteriously disappeared.

210
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:59,375
Most likely, his Horror
wife devoured him.

211
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,166
Or, perhaps...

212
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,916
[RAIKOU]
Yeah? Perhaps what?

213
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,583
He sacrificed his own
life to seal her.

214
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:08,500
Shidamaru was a Makai Alchemist.

215
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,916
He was unable to eliminate
Horrors on his own.

216
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,166
He could only seal her
between the dimensions

217
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,583
of yin and yang. However,
such a seal is weak,

218
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:20,000
there is a chance that it could
easily break anytime now.

219
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,083
Please give me the order.

220
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,041
Let me defeat this Horror.

221
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,708
You want to, huh?

222
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,833
Do I really need to remind you?

223
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:30,250
Your armor is sealed
away without Seimei.

224
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,041
Just what do you plan to do?

225
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,083
[gasps]

226
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,458
[HARUAKI] I already know what
you've come here to ask.

227
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:51,541
I'll tell you what I can,
although, about Kiyome's mother,

228
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:54,500
I could not tell you when
she became a Horror.

229
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,208
How did it happen?

230
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,625
[HARUAKI] Are you familiar
with Kamo no yasunori?

231
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:02,125
He's an Onmayu professor and
a close aide to Michinaga.

232
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,791
The Kamo family presides
over the Onmyouji.

233
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,833
Their skills are unsurpassed.

234
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:10,458
Princess katsurako was
the daughter of Yasunori.

235
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,208
So Kiyome, she was
born with the blood

236
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:15,416
of the Kamo and Abe families.

237
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,750
Making her destined to become
the strongest of all Onmyouji.

238
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,291
[HARUAKI] What are you
doing out there, Kiyome?

239
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:23,583
Look, Grandfather.

240
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,791
I can exorcise evil
spirits, watch!

241

[HORROR 7A growls]

[SEIMEI laughs]

244
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,583
[KATSURAKO]
Kiyome! Why?

245
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,000
Why did you lock her up?

246
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,625
[HARUAKI]
The job of eliminating Horrors

247
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,291
belongs to a Makai Knight!

248
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:50,208
Kiyome is supposed to
inherit the Abe family!

249
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:53,666
She is meant to read the stars,
work for the aristocrats,

250
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,958
and protect the
Heavenly Emperor!

251
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:57,875
I'd rather do some
real good in the world

252
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,166
and get rid of the evil spirits!

253
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,208
[KATSURAKO cries]

254
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,166
[HARUAKI]
It didn't take much longer

255
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,541
for my fears to come true.

Those damn monsters!

259
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,750
The Horrors know
of Kiyome's power

260
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,000
and plan to murder her

261
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:16,125
before she can become
a true threat to them.

262
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,625
What do we do?
We have to protect her.

[SEIMEI whimpers]

264
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,125

touch my daughter!

[KATSURAKO yells]

266
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,166
For Kiyome.

You have to destroy
me with them!

No, Mother!

[KATSURAKO gasping]

274
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,541
[SHIDAMARU]
I refuse to let you go alone.

275
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,666
This is for our daughter.

276
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,541
[HARUAKI] After depleting
the last of his life

277
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,625
to create the seal to
bind her, Shidamaru drew

278
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:21,583
his last breath with his
beloved Princess katsarako.

279
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,583
[HARUAKI]
I buried the two of them

280
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:29,833
in the sacred ground of Kumano.
And there they remain.

281
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:32,041
[RAIKOU]
What about Seimei?

282
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,375
[HARUAKI]
She witnessed everything.

283
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,208
And then, one day...

284
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,833
[HARUAKI]
Where are you going, Kiyome?

285
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,666
I'm leaving this life behind.

286
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,083
My fate is to destroy Horrors.

287
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,708
I forbid you to do so!

288
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,833
You will inherit the
Abe family as planned!

289
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:53,750
Both my parents died
so that I could live.

290
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:56,916
I won't allow such a
thing to happen again.

291
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,833
So I will fight the Horrors.

292
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,083
[RAIKOU]
Has the seal been broken?

293
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,375
The only driving impulse
that a Horror knows

294
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:09,541
is to consume humans.
And yet Katsaraku...

295
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:12,208
she's obsessed with this
house and her daughter.

296
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,583
Tell me the truth.

297
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:16,166
You sent Seimei to kill her
own mother, didn't you?

298
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,958
[HARUAKI]
I'm afraid it can't be helped.

299
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:20,208
She's the only one among
us who can do it.

300
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:23,541
And you must understand that
that is no longer her mother.

301
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,791
It is nothing more
than a Horror.

302
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:28,291
I bear the guilt for
everything that happened.

303
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:32,458
I could not save my
son, nor his wife.

Shiki. You know how to
find Seimei, right?

Take me straight to her.
Faster than the wind.

I will eliminate
Seimei's mother.

As a Makai Knight, it's my duty.

[DOUMAN] Your mother, Princess
Katsurako became a Horror.

318
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:25,000
Sealed away by your father,
buried by your grandfather.

319
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:28,708
And now, her only
thought is of revenge.

320
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,458
[KATSURAKO (HORROR) growls]

321
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:34,375
See that? The seal
is falling away.

322
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:36,666
The energy that leaked
from the seal last night

323
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,958
wreaked havoc at the Abe house.

324
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,958
That destruction was nothing
but residual seepage.

325
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:44,416
Imagine what will happen
when the Horror emerges.

326
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,916
[SEIMEI] There's a faster way
of doing things, you know.

327
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,333
Just stand back, I'll do it.

328
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,916
[DOUMAN chuckles]
As expected.

329
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,625
Douma Houshi predicted you
would offer your services

330
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,333
in place of mine.

331
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,166
Wait, Douma Houshi?

332
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,333
[DOUMAN] He said you would
never be able to toss

333
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:03,958
your mother aside. Even if
she had become a Horror.

334
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:08,083
Now, release her and
obtain your revenge.

335
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:13,791
These vines are all that's left
of my father's body and spirit.

336
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,875
To go this far.

337
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,625
[RAIKOU]
Don't do it!

338
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:34,041
Seimei! You're acting
like a damn fool!

339
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,291
What, Raikou?!

340
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,083
Why the hell are you here?!

341
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,666
I know what you must
be going through.

342
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,458
Your mother's Horror.
Let me destroy it for you.

343
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:48,083
[SEIMEI laughs]

344
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:51,375
Oh, goodness, what am
I going to do with you?

345
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:54,125
[DOUMAN] Just how naïve
are you, Golden Knight?

346
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,416
She's not here to
destroy a Horror.

347
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,208
She's here to release the
seal of her beloved mother.

348
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:02,833
[RAIKOU] You're wrong!
Seimei would never do that.

349
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,083
Right?

350
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:05,750
You're not...

351
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:11,416
[RAIKOU] If that's true, Seimei,
then you give me no choice.

352
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,208
You will not do a damn thing!

353
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:15,250
[RAIKOU grunts]

354
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:19,541
This should keep you
sufficiently busy.

355
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,875
How did he get the seal lifted?

356
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,416
Going behind my back.

357
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,583
[RAIKOU grunts]

358
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:48,083
[DOUMAN]
Finally! You did it!

359
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:51,416
Behold the true form
of your dear mother!

360
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,875
This is what became of her

361
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,541
after absorbing the
Horrors within her!

362
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:58,083
[KATSURAKO (HORROR) roars]

363
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,125
[DOUMAN]
Now.

364
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:04,125
Release your hatred
on the world!

365
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,083
[SEIMEI grunts]

366
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,375
[DOUMAN] What? What are you
doing, Seimei?

367
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,208
[KATSURAKO (HORROR) groans]

368
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:23,791
[SEIMEI]
Raikou!

369
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:24,833
[RAIKOU]
Uh?

370
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:29,500
[roars]

371
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,250
Hurry up and get on!

372
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,666
[RAIKOU]
Right.

373
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,416
[METAL DRAGON 7A roars]

374
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,291
[RAIKOU yells]

375
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,250
[roars]

376
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,458
[RAIKOU]
Heh.

377
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:08,541
[DOUMAN]
Seimei.

378
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:11,375
So this is the reason you
wanted to release your mother.

379
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:14,125
It's not just Madou Rings
and Madou Statues.

380
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,583
I've honed my skills to
allow me to seal Horrors

381
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:19,333
into all forms of Madou Tools.

382
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:21,791
To prepare for this day.

383
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:26,875
[DOUMA] I should've known. The
light within you does not fade.

384
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:29,791
Not even flicker, Seimei.

385
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:30,958
[SEIMEI]
Douma Houshi!

386
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,041
[DOUMA] And I was so
eager to watch you

387
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,416
coldly kill your
mother's Horror.

388
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,250
Or at least, watch you
collapse in despair

389
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:39,875
and succumb to the darkness

390
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:42,916
as you suffer from your
inability to kill her.

391
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,958
However, I never I expected you
to turn her into a Motto tool.

392
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:49,583
It's the natural state
for humans to waver

393
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,875
between light and darkness.

394
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:56,208
My only natural
state is darkness.

395
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:00,416
[RAIKOU]
Who was that next to Douman?

396
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,083
[SEIMEI]
Douma Houshi.

397
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,041
The previous Ashiya Douman.

398
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,416
Previous?

399
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,666
[SEIMEI]
Heh.

400
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,416
You really were worried
about me, weren't you?

401
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,375
[RAIKOU grunts]
I bet you'd like that.

402
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:12,916
I don't even need you now.

403
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,541
I can summon my armor on my own.

404
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:17,916
[SEIMEI]
Oh, can you, how special.

405
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,375
--[RAIKOU] Uh!
--[SEIMEI laughs]

406
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:20,958
Seimei! Hey!

407
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:22,333
You have to face up
to reality, Raikou.

408
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:23,958
[RAIKOU]
Back off!

409
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:25,625
Sorry to tell you.

410
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:29,166
But you're my personal Makai
Knight, and mine alone.

411
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,541
[SEIMEI laughs]

412
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:05,541
[INARI C] There are things
that can be gained from loss.

413
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:10,250
It is from that lack, that light
begins to fill the darkness.
