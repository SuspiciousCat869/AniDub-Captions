1
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:23,375
[yelling]

2
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:26,041
[RAIKOU] Why are so many
becoming Horrors?

3
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:27,958
Does it have
something to do with...

4
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:30,583
...the moon suddenly
turning crimson?

5
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,208
[KINTOU] There are more
than a few people

6
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:36,708
who feart this red moon
may be an ominous sign.

7
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:38,291
[laughs]

8
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:40,750
The very fact that it's unusual
is what makes it interesting.

9
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:50,708
[RAIKOU] Seimei, it's true
that humans are weak.

10
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:52,583
That's why they continue
to spread darkness

11
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:55,125
and turn into Horrors.

12
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:58,291
You may not be able to forgive
them for their weakness,

13
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:03,416
but I'll still fight to
protect the people.

14
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,875
If we should meet again...
this time...

15
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:16,500
[howling]

16
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:20,500
[yelling]

17
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,250
[RAIKOU]
Flurries of rising red embers.

18
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:37,958
It happens every time now.

19
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:41,083
It's impossible to see that
and not get creeped out.

20
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:43,625
Kinda feels like
the end of the world.

21
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:46,875
[yelps]

22
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:48,000
[gasps]

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,208
[gasps]

24
00:01:58,416 --> 00:02:00,666
Did you see that? The symbol!

25
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,958
[RAIKOU]
Yeah.

26
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:05,750
It's the one Seimei
uses for her magic.

27
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:07,791
So how'd it get on the moon?

28
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:11,166
Like I said, it feels
like the end is coming.

29
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,916
Ah! I wish Seimei was here to
help us with this weird stuff!

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,833
Oh, um, not that you can't
handle it. Sorry, Raikou.

31
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:22,458
It's fine. I understand
what you meant.

32
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:26,000
[RAIKOU]
Seimei.

33
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:07,666
[KINTOKI] We want you to start
telling us what's going on!

34
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,958
[INARI A] My, my, someone
has an attitude.

35
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:13,916
[KINTOKI] Well, I'm getting
pretty frustrated.

36
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,291
He's right. You know what
this moon means, don't you?

37
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:21,791
Yes. The moon that you see
is not the moon that you know.

38
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,875
It's something else.

39
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:26,125
It's actually a barrier.

40
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:30,166
A long time ago, a wise
alchemist of the Abe family...

41
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,166
...created that red, phantom
moon to seal off a catastrophe.

42
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,000
In short, it keeps evil out.

43
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,250
What? This seems
like a big deal.

44
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:40,750
Why keep it a secret from us?

45
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:43,208
You know how tough the
Horror's have becom--

46
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:44,833
We are quite aware, Kintoki,

47
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,833
because the lost key has
been used by someone

48
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,291
to open the seal.

49
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,041
We clearly didn't
want that to happen,

50
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,583
so we tried to find it first.

51
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,791
We sent magicians and
knights to many lands

52
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,625
searching for that one key.

53
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,208
Hold on.

54
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,916
Is that why there haven't been
other knights in the capital?

55
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,875
Yes. That's exactly it.

56
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,541
Unlike that Kinktoki character,

57
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,208
you have a good head
on your shoulders.

58
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:09,833
Hey! That's enough? Just
tell us how to fix it-- Ah!

59
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,375
You don't need to know
that information.

60
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:16,250
Well, more like, we
can't tell you that.

61
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:19,166
It's an order that's
come down from above.

62
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,541
[INARI B]
And with that,

63
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:23,041
I'm afraid we've come to
the end of today's meeting.

64
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:25,583
This is not a simple
challenge we face.

65
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,875
We hope a way can be
found to resolve it safely

66
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:31,125
and without any
unnecessary complications.

67
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,041
[gasps]

68
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:58,500
[screaming]

69
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:09,458
Oh? Well, well, I wasn't
expecting a guest.

70
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:16,208
I've finally found you, Douman.

71
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,416
Where is Douma Houshi?

72
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:25,375
You have no intention
of answering me? Well...

73
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:28,166
Fine then.
I'll beat it out of you!

74
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,750
How childish you are.

75
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:37,583
[DOUMAN] Your impatience blinds
you to what's really here.

76
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,208
I pity your simple mind.

77
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,583
What'd you say?

78
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,958
What I'm saying is,
I am not your foe.

79
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,833
Take a look behind you.

80
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:47,333
[gasps]

81
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,750
[SEIMEI]
I didn't stop him in time.

82
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,708
Hold on!

83
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,375
Not this time.

84
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,875
[SEIMEI screams]

85
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:48,625
[SEIMEI] I can't believe he
surprised me. I lost focus.

86
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,666
Well, no more.

87
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,541
I've seen men stronger than you!

88
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:59,250
The only thing you Horrors
care about is eating.

89
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:04,208
[yelling]

90
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:07,125
Well, here ya go. Eat this!

91
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,666
Come on! That all you got?!

92
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,333
[gasps]

93
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,500
[KINTOKI]
Raikou! You see it?

94
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,916
It's a Horror? We were right.

95
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,166
Can't hide from us,
even at night!

96
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,708
Yeah.

97
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:29,875
But who was the
person it was chasing?

98
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,291
You ready for this?

99
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:34,083
Right. It's time
to go to work.

100
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:45,750
[howling]

101
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,750
[RAIKOU]
There it is again.

102
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,875
[KINTOKI]
Even creepier than last time.

103
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,291
Is it just me,

104
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:02,083
or is it getting redder every
time we kill a Horror?

105
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,833
Raikou.

106
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,375
[groans]

107
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:21,791
Of course. I should've known.

108
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,083
Of everyone in our group,

109
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:26,208
I turned out to be
the most pathetic.

110
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:27,708
Alone.

111
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:31,458
I always keep moving
until I end up alone.

112
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:33,708
Some life.

113
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:37,458
[SEIMEI] I lost my mother.
I lost my father.

114
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:41,958
I threw away my own name.
And any family I had left.

115
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:46,333
Even when I filled their
absence with a new mentor...

116
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:50,125
...we ended up taking
different paths.

117
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:54,208
Then one day, I found a light.

118
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,291
But was it real?

119
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,791
Or just a passing illusion?

120
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:06,583
[SEIMEI] If it was real,
one thing's for sure,

121
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,791
I didn't deserve it.

122
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:13,083
There was no way I could spend
the rest of my life by his side.

123
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:48,833
Where am I?

124
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,166
[laughter]

125
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,958
Hey? Who's there?

126
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,916
Where am I? Come out!

127
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,291
[SHADOW]
The darkness has finally awoken.

128
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:05,791
There's nowhere left
for you to run.

129
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,291
No! I don't believe you!

130
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:11,083
[gasping]

131
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:13,333
[laughter]

132
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:17,125
What? No!

133
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:21,250
[SHADOW] Be afraid.
Give into your despair.

134
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:25,833
Both your body and your soul,
they now belong to me.

135
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,791
[SEIMEI] Don't threaten me from
the shadows. Show yourself!

136
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,958
[SHADOW]
They belong to me.

137
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:34,291
You belong to me.
You're mine. Mine!

138
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:37,208
No! No! No!

139
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,583
No!

140
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,708
More nightmares, I assume.

141
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,208
I've been listening to
your moaning all night now.

142
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,791
So you were eavesdropping
on a sleeping woman.

143
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:54,250
An Onmyou professor
should be above that.

144
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:57,458
You should not disrespect
the person's who's helping you.

145
00:11:57,541 --> 00:12:01,875
The sad woman who sits before me
has been cursed by Douma Houshi.

146
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,250
Isn't that right?

147
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,916
[HARUAKI] Thanks to your
friends Raikou and Yorinobu,

148
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,125
I was made aware of your
disappearance from the capital.

149
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:23,333
But I didn't expect to find you
here trying to purify yourself.

150
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:28,500
[SEIMEI] And why are
you here, Grandfather?

151
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,125
[HARUAKI] This is the holy
mountain of the Abe family,

152
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:34,916
where both your mother
and father were put to rest.

153
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,500
It's quite understandable
that I visit to honor them.

154
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,416
[HARUAKI]
But I do admit,

155
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,125
this time I have come for
a very different reason.

156
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:54,833
[HARUAKI]
This is also the place

157
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:57,541
where we watch over
the Crimson Moon.

158
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:02,625
[HARUAKI] It is a great duty
passed down in the Abe family.

159
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:09,125
My God. The Crimson Moon.

160
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:12,958
The great barrier used
to seal away catastrophe.

161
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:17,500
[HARUAKI]
But that seal has been broken.

162
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:20,500
It won't be long
before it resurrects.

163
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,125
Before what does?

164
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,666
Rudra.

165
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,833
Even the powers of ancient
Makai Knights and Alchemists

166
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:29,000
could not defeat it permanently.

167
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,916
It is a Horror with
unimaginable strength.

168
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,291
The catastrophe we
sealed away with the moon

169
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:36,208
was caused by Rudra.

170
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:40,208
This occurred long before the
establishment of the capital.

171
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,166
But now, the Horrors
of the capital

172
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,791
are growing ever stronger.

173
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:47,458
And it's all due to Rudra's
unstoppable influence.

174
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,458
That is why I've come
looking for the key

175
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:50,958
that will restore the seal

176
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:54,375
and stop Rudra from causing
another catastrophe.

177
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,291
So the fate of
everything we hold dear

178
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:59,750
comes down to us being able
to find one measly little key?

179
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,375
[HARUAKI]
I'm afraid so.

180
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:04,166
But before we find that key--

181
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,083
[SEIMEI]
What're you doing?!

182
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:13,291
Whatever's necessary to free you
from the curse Douma's cast!

183
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,416
But to use a spell like that,

184
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,875
you have to sacrifice
your own life!

185
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:35,916
[screaming]

186
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,708
Kiyome!

187
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:44,041
Stop this!

188
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,791
[HARUAKI] Fight it, Kiyome.
I can still save you.

189
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,833
I just need more time!

190
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:52,583
Silence! You can't.
You're weak!

191
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:55,833
[groaning]

192
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:59,750
Grandfather, the only
way is to kill me!

193
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:07,250
[screaming]

194
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:15,166
[HARUAKI groans]

195
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:26,125
[HARUAKI]
It was too little and too late.

196
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:36,333
My-oh-my. You'll
never try that again.

197
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:39,041
Die, Grandfather.

198
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:44,416
[SHIKI DOLL A]
Shiki. Shiki, shiki.

199
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,416
[gasps]

200
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,041
[screaming]

201
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,958
[SEIMEI]
Damn this curse!

202
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,500
What was I trying
to do back there?

203
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:03,416
If Shiki hadn't stopped me,
my Grandfather would be--

204
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,458
All right.

205
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,791
The only one who
can lift this curse

206
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:09,250
is the man who put it on me.

207
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:15,666
[SEIMEI]
Faster. You have to keep moving.

208
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:19,541
There's not much time
left to set things right.

209
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,416
[SEIMEI]
Douma!

210
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:29,125
[DOUMA]
So you've appeared after all.

211
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:32,666
Good. I've been waiting
for you, Seimei.

212
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,875
Everything you've done has
been about getting me here.

213
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,208
You're behind it all.

214
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:40,125
The curse. The moon. Rudra.

215
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,375
Answer me, Douma!

216
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:46,625
It was you who broke the
seal on Rudra! It was you!

217
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,500
[DOUMA]
And if that's true?

218
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,208
Then you need to tell
me where the key is

219
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:51,916
so I can relock the seal.

220
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,583
And if you don't--

221
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:56,166
[DOUMA]
You will kill us, I presume.

222
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,208
Very well. I can accept that.

223
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:04,041
[DOUMA] But even if you succeed
and kill me and Douman,

224
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,583
the curse on you remains.

225
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:10,333
There is no escaping
the trap we've set, Seimei.

226
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:11,833
That's fine.

227
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:15,541
I've strayed from the correct
path so many times now...

228
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:18,541
...I deserve this.

229
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:22,291
And so will you both
when you die with me.

230
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,125
[DOUMA]
Splendid.

231
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,750
The clashing of light
and darkness.

232
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:30,000
Once they pass
the critical point,

233
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:34,625
your power as an Onmiyo will
reach the highest peak possible.

234
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:37,916
Even a Makai Knight with
the purest possible heart

235
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,250
could not know such power.

236
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:46,416
Seimei, your opponent will be
this man, Ashiya Douman.

237
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,833
[DOUMAN]
If you wish to know the secret

238
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:52,125
to the seal on the Crimson Moon,

239
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,666
you have to get through me.

240
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,708
Fine. I'm happy to do just that.

241
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:01,833
This thing between
us ends today!

242
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,291
[yells]

243
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,375
[SEIMEI]
Douman!

244
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:11,000
Why do you still listen
to that crazy, old man?

245
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,541
You know full well he
can't control Horrors.

246
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,125
If Rudra resurrects,

247
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:18,458
he won't hesitate to devour you
right along with everyone else!

248
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:21,125
Exactly what I want to happen!

249
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:26,750
I will re-make this world
into one without light or life!

250
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,000
[DOUMAN]
And at that moment,

251
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,333
my long dreamed-of revenge
against that man

252
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,291
will finally be in hand.

253
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,041
[SEIMEI]
Wait, "that man"?

254
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,458
I've heard you use
that phrase before.

255
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:43,750
I know who you're talking
about. It's Michinaga.

256
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:44,500
[DOUMAN chuckles]

257
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:45,708
[gasps]

258
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:56,583
[SEIMEI] Keep fighting.
Don't let things end like this.

259
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:04,541
[SEIMEI] If you fail here now,
then Raikou will die.

260
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:05,416
[gasps]

261
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,583
[SEIMEI yelling]

262
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,125
[growls]

263
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,791
[DOUMAN] How do you
still have such power?

264
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,833
A pointless struggle.

265
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:48,583
[DOUMA] It seems that she
has finally awakened.

266
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,500
Which means your
long-held dream

267
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,416
has also come true today.

268
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,791
How will you put to use
what you have created?

269
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,916
[DOUMA]
First we must test its strength

270
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,791
while we're confident
it's contained

271
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,541
within this mortal vessel.

272
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,833
[DOUMAN] To think, everything
we've fought so hard for

273
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,541
is right here at our feet;

274
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,333
all that beautiful darkness,

275
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,500
ready to burst
forth from Seimei.

276
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,541
[DOUMA] I do think
it would be interesting

277
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:15,333
to send her into battle
against the Makai Knights.

278
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:18,958
But it's probably safer to keep
her sealed within Seimei

279
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,583
until we find the key.

280
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:24,041
[DOUMAN]
Hold on. I have a better idea.

281
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,250
[DOUMA]
What?

282
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,750
I will absorb the evil
trapped within her.

283
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:31,125
And become an entity
of living darkness.

284
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:34,583
[DOUMA] No. Once you do that,
there's no coming back.

285
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:35,958
You're gone forever.

286
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,625
[DOUMAN]
I appreciate the warning,

287
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:41,000
but trust me, I have
no plans to return.

288
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:44,000
All that remains in
front of me is darkness.

289
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,333
It's rather fitting,

290
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,458
seeing as how I never once
yearned for the light.

291
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:48,916
[DOUMA]
But you know this darkness

292
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,541
is impossible to control.

293
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:55,583
As strong as you've become,
it will still devour you!

294
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,000
[DOUMAN]
Hmph.

295
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,541
How can it if I'm the one
who's doing the devouring?

296
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,125
[DOUMA] It seems you
no longer have any need

297
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,208
for your mentor's wisdom.

298
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:06,208
[DOUMAN] Why should I
bother listening to a man

299
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:08,583
who knows so little of the dark?

300
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:19,125
I know your magic well,
Douma. It bores me.

301
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:22,416
[DOUMA] Just because you've seen
it before, doesn't make it weak.

302
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,750
Using dice to control fate
is the essence of my spells.

303
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:31,041
And now, fate demands
Douman's fall.

304
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,541
I promise you a quick death.

305
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,000
Well then,

306
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,541
I guess the darkness will be
devouring someone tonight,

307
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,833
only it'll be you!

308
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,875
[DOUMAN]
And with this, I bid farewell

309
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:46,750
to the previous Ashiya Douman.

310
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:51,875
It's back.

311
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:53,625
The catastrophe.

312
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,375
[INARI A]
Rudra.

313
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:12,958
Raikou, what is that?

314
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:05,125
[INARI A]
A distant roar in the dark.

315
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:07,875
Links breaking on old chains.

316
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:11,000
Bolts of lighting
stained red with blood.
