He was truly a great man
whom I will miss, dearly.

00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:36,666

would become possessed

and then meet a violent
end as a lowly Horror.

the regrets he had.

That's why we gather
for this poetry reading

and honor only the
good man we knew.

Lord Masamune, I believe
it's your turn to read.

It'll be okay.

I'll be gentle, I promise.

[MASAMUNE]
My wife's a demon!

She's the meanest person
in the whole capital.

28
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,083
Izumi, can you believe
she's banned me

29
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,750
from having any more poetry
readings in my own house?

30

Happiness is so fleeting.

But she's right to be angry.

32
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,541
You laid hands on a girl during
a gathering to honor a dead man.

33
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:26,333
That's not true.
I never got the chance.

34
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:29,000
That jealous old mare had
the nerve to interrupt me!

[IZUMI]
Either way, you're unfaithful.

36
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,875
Now, have you done
your homework?

37
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:33,750
My what?

38
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,166
Your new poem!

39

You have been meeting with me
to work on your poetry,

40
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,125
have you not?

41
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:41,000
Right! How could I forget?

"Redder than the red

Your flower bud's scent fills
my nose, when I get up close!"

45
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,583
That was terrible.

46
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:52,958
But it kind of rhymes.

47
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,166
It has bad structure

48
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,458
and obviously
inappropriate metaphors!

49
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:59,125
We're writing poetry here,
not pornography!

50
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:00,666
You're a mean teacher.

51
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,208
[IZUMI] Masamune, I give you
this lesson not as a teacher,

52
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:05,708
but as a friend.

53
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,166
After years of marriage,

54
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,958
many things can come between
the nobleman and his wife.

55
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,250
You must learn to
ignore those things,

56
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:15,458
so you may gaze again upon her
with the eyes of a young man,

57
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,333
the eyes which first saw her.

58
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:20,833
If you can train yourself to
see her with those young eyes,

59
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,791
your passion for her
will be renewed.

60
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,958
Then putting those renewed
feelings into words

61
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,833
should come easily.

62
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:30,750
And real poetry will
flow from your pen.

63
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,416
Do you really think so?

64
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,750
Yes. Now go.
We're done for today.

[MASAMUNE chuckles]

66
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,625
An aristocrat who does
not truly love his wife

67
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,416
will move the hearts
of no women.

68
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,041
I don't believe
you believe that.

Ohh...

Happiness is fleeting.

how can I stop it?

On Masamune?

[IZUMI] All I want you to do
is act like house servants

76
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,500
and keep an eye on him.

77
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:04,666
And if he lays hands
on any servant girls,

78

report back to me
about it right away.

Why tell you?

00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,666
We can punish him
right then and there!

81
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,333
You can't ask me to ignore
a man who cheats like that.

00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,666
I hold aristocrats accountable!

[IZUMI] Masamune is foolish,
but he's not a bad man.

Our families have been close
since our parents were young.

It's important I address
his lack of discipline

without hurting him or
embarrassing his wife.

to become a monstrosity.

day do you take?

that right here?

[WIFE] I'm reviewing
our household's budget.

The old servant girl left,
so I hired a new one.

112
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:36,166
Our kitchen is also in need
of some sort of renewal.

113
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,625
So, I'm going
through our savings

114
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,166
and seeing what improvements
we can afford.

115
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,958
I see right through
her little mind games!

116
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,125
She took away the money
I used for poetry parties

117
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,291
and is now talking of
using it for herself!

118
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:49,458
She's turning me into
the woman of my own house!

00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:51,375
Don't worry about that.

120

I'll take care of
the household expenses

as soon as I'm
feeling more awake.

That's a lie and you know it.

123

You spend your free
time playing around

124

instead of servicing your court

125

and performing upkeep on
your house and holdings.

126

Because of this, the budget
is being eaten away.

And don't think it's just money
you need to manage better.

As a young man,

you took pride in everything
you did, public and personal.

You had passion,
ideals, and ambition!

I remember how you would
visit me every night.

climbing the ranks

to bring me wealth and status.

That man... is gone.

Now he just sleeps between
parties and chasing women.

He can't even keep his hands
off his own servant girl.

140
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,250
What a fool I was
to ever believe

141
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,500
a single one of
the lies you told me.

142
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,166
I've even overheard
people call me,

"the wife of the most useless
aristocrat in the capital."

I swear, my pillow now has
more tears than feathers!

But no,

146
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,500
my hurt feelings are just a
symptom of the larger issue.

You've lost your passion,

I knew coming in here to do
the books would make you angry,

but I also hoped it'd
finally wake you up!

00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:28,916
[MASAMUNE]
The Light Palace.

[WIFE]
What?!

162
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,125
I knew Izumi was crafty,

163
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,541
but I never thought she'd take
advantage of us like this.

164
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,833
I wish we could pay back our
debts by helping anyone else.

165
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,916
Masamune's a dirty old man.

166
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,458
I don't get women.

167
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:47,666
I just know a Makai Knight
has a duty to repay his debts.

168
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,458
[MASAMUNE]
Turn up here at the corner.

169
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,333
What about the Light
Palace, my Lord?

170
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:52,625
Change of plans.

171
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:55,458
I wish to call on
one of my relatives.

172

[MASAMUNE'S NIECE] Good day.
It's been too far long.

173
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,833
You've become quite
the lovely woman.

[MASAMUNE'S NIECE]
Thank you, my Lord.

175
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:07,750
I've forgotten, dear,
how old are you now?

176
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,458
I recently turned 14.

177
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:13,791
Oh! Wonderful!
And you are so cute!

178

[RAIKOU] I guess everyone's
got family that loves 'em.

[KINTOKI]
Must be his mom's side.

180
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,791
I heard that his father
denounced him long ago

181

It'll be okay! Just trust me!

00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,750
[MASAMUNE'S NIECE]
No, please don't!

185

Don't worry. I promise
I'll be gentle.

No! We can't hurt him!
Izumi said not to, remember?

[MASAMUNE'S NIECE]
Mother, help!

00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,416
Masamune, no!

191
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,833
What kind of an uncle tries
to defile his own niece?

192
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,416
This is unforgivable!
We're denouncing you, too!

193
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,666
[RAIKOU] Well, sounds like
it worked itself out.

No, get away from me!

Don't worry, I promise,
I'll be gentle!

[BOTH grunting]

Don't hurt him! We're not
supposed to hurt him!

199
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,458
Don't you wanna clear
our debt to her?

200
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,875
That's all that matters here!

201
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,833
[RAIKOU]
I'm so tired.

202
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,208
We should've told her no.

203
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:12,250
I mean, it's not like she
can hurt us or anything.

204
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,041
Driver, stop the carriage.

You, girl. Come up
here for a bit.

He's becoming a
full-fledged kidnapper!

207

Let's drop him off at Izumi's
and let her deal with him.

Don't stop me this time!

Welcome home, dear.

[MASAMUNE]
Hello.

220
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,875
[KINTOKI] And with that, we'll
take our leave now, my Lord.

Please excuse us.

You know, you ruined my day.

Sorry you didn't
get to hurt him.

I'll cook you dinner
to make up for it.

[WIFE]
Don't go just yet.

There's something very important
that I must ask of you.

227
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,875
Would you please tell me
where my husband went

228
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,083
and what did he did today?

229
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,416
[RAIKOU]
What? Oh, lots of things.

230

[KINTOKI] He, uh,
went to the Light Palace!

I sent someone myself

232
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:12,250
and he confirmed that Masamune
did not go there today.

233
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,458
Tell the truth.

Where did my husband go,
and what did he do?

out of my own house!

Happiness is so fleeting.

But her actions make sense.

00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,083
I warned you about
acting on your passion,

and still, you groped
three girls today.

my hands on one!

That's a pretty important
fact you're overlooking!

Hey, knight and squire boy.

and tell all my secrets
to that demon woman!

How underhanded! I hesitate
to call you men!

Oooh!

[IZUMI] Arguments between men
and women are quite tricky.

Placing the blame
solely on Masamune,

262
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,375
that's like picking a side in

"which came first,
the chicken or the egg?"

You don't mean that.

not an easy illness to cure.

315
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,041
[ARISTOCRAT A]
Masamune!

316
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,875
[ALL] Turn yourself
into the authorities!

317
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,791
But I'm innocent! I don't
know who killed those women!

318
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,083
Is that so?

319
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:46,250
That night you found
the first murder victim

320
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,458
was only after you'd
snuck out of bed.

321
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,000
And the short time
you were with us,

322
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:52,083
you talked in your sleep about
wanting to nibble her neck.

323
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,625
Come to think of it,

324
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,708
there hasn't been one night
you haven't babbled about girls

325
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,083
in your sleep.

326
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,541
And it's gross stuff I don't
feel comfortable saying

327
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,000
in front of Izumi.

328
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,333
[MASAMUNE] I have no idea
what they're talking about.

329
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,375
I can't remember what
I say when I sleep!

330
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:04,750
Do any of you have proof?

331
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,541
If you're going to accuse me
of murdering women,

332
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,875
I want to see the
evidence against-- Ah!

333
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,250
[RAIKOU]
This!

334
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,000
Kintoki!

335
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,083
Got it!

336
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,041
[RAIKOU]
He's not a Horror?

337
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,666
How can a man with such
darkness be just a man?

338
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,666
Kintoki, let's go to
the Watchdog Center!

339
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,708
[KINTOKI]
Right!

340
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,125
[IZUMI] I'm sorry for your
troubles, but you should leave.

341
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:29,750
Staying any longer here will
look suspicious. You understand.

342
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,875
Oh, and I doubt you
need to be reminded,

343
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,625
but keep quiet
about this, please.

344
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,625
[ARISTOCRAT A]
Of course, Madam Izumi.

345
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:37,333
Oh, I almost forgot.

346
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:39,708
Masamune's wife gave this to me.

347
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:43,416
[IZUMI]
Happiness is so fleeting.

348
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,791
[MASAMUNE]
Izumi.

349
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,000
You believe me when I say

350
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,166
I have nothing to do
with these women dying.

351
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,708
I love women too much
to ever hurt them.

352
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,416
And I certainly wouldn't
kill the very women

353
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,375
whose beds I dream
of hopping into.

354
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,833
[IZUMI]
Your wife has sent you a letter.

355
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,833
A love note?

356
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,875
[WIFE]
"If naught for evil women,

357
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:04,833
who tempt him with their
youth and beauty so,

358
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:08,708
the heart of my one true
love would never bleed."

359
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:11,583
If the world didn't have women
who turn jealous then evil,

360
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,958
you could never be blamed
for such a monstrous crime,

361
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,875
for there'd be no one
to spread such rumors.

362
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,041
[MASAMUNE]
She believes in me.

363
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:23,208
The wife I called a demon
still stands by her husband.

364
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:29,500
Wandering from the dark of
lustful shadows that bound me.

365
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:34,291
I gaze upon the face of the wife
I first fell in love with.

366
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:35,291
[IZUMI]
You pass.

367
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:36,166
Huh?

368
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,625
[IZUMI]
That was beautiful.

369
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,291
There's nothing left for me
to teach you about poetry

370
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,000
or romance.

371
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,208
You mean it?

372
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,458
[IZUMI]
Not only can you write,

373
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,958
you've beaten the lust
that had consumed you.

374
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:49,791
Go. Return as her faithful poet.

375
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,416
[MASAMUNE]
I caused you such trouble.

376
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,833
A weight's been lifted.

377
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,541
I'll face the police,
and the public

378
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,125
knowing full well the truth:

379
00:16:57,208 --> 00:17:00,541
My wife's love is on my side
and will clear my name.

380
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,125
I have a love in my life
that will stand beside me

381
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,250
to the very end.

382
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,000
[sighs]

383
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:08,958
Again, thank you.

384
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,416
Uh, Izumi?

385
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,791
Oh, Masamune.

386
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,083
I've known you for as
long as I can remember.

387
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:22,875
But this is the first time I've
ever seen you as a full man.

388
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,041
Maybe this is the
paradox of womanhood.

389
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,333
The day you've beaten lust

390
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:28,583
and fallen back in
love with your wife,

391
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,708
is the day I fall for you.

392
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,875
[MASAMUNE]
I don't know what to say.

393
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,833
[IZUMI]
Does this make me an evil woman?

394
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:37,375
[MASAMUNE]
No, no! Of course it doesn't!

395
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,416
[IZUMI]
Long have we known each other

396
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:44,375
before I see your manhood,
almost too late, but not quite.

397
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:49,500
Happiness is so fleeting,
but not for tonight.

398
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,750
[WIFE] Oh! I thought they'd
thrown you in a dungeon!

399
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,583
[MASAMUNE] I'm sorry
I've caused you to worry.

400
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,541
I promise, I'm not
going anywhere.

401
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:58,583
I'll be by your side tonight and
for the days and years to come.

402
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:01,458
[WIFE] I'm so happy
to hear you say that!

403
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:12,833
Izumi. You have such
soft earlobes.

404
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,791
[MASAMUNE chuckles]

405
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:15,958
Eh?

406
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,291
[MASAMUNE screaming]

407
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:20,041
Hey! Why're you--?
Put that knife down!

408
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,125
[WIFE] Don't act so
surprised, my darling.

409
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:25,083
After all, you call me a demon
behind my back so much,

410
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,958
I might as well start
acting like one.

411
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:27,791
[MASAMUNE]
Oh, no!

412
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:28,958
Are you saying that it's you

413
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,833
who's been killing
all those poor women?

414
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:32,250
[WIFE]
Yes.

415
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,208
I decided that if you were
going to lay hands on them

416
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,750
well, then I would, too.

417
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,291
[MASAMUNE] Yeah, but h-how'd
you even know I touched them?

418
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,666
[screaming]

419

[WIFE] "Most arousing place
on my relative's mother,

her neckline."

421
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:44,750
The next girl, you
say it's her breasts,

422
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,375
and this one, you say
it's her buttocks!

423
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:48,666
[MASAMUNE whimpering]

424
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,708
How can I read this
and not bubble with rage?

425
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:53,625
Tell me, how can I forgive you?!

426
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:57,916
[HORROR A] I can give you power.
The power to get revenge.

427
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,458
[WIFE]
Give it to me!

428
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:01,750
[gasping]

429
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:04,416
[MASAMUNE screaming]

430
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:09,416
Don't worry, darling.
I won't kill you now.

431
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,083
The police will
take care of that,

432
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:14,541
but only after I finish framing
you for killing those women.

433
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:18,166
Including your old friend,
Izumi, with her soft ear lobes.

434
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,166
I'm coming for you, slut!

438
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,375
[RAIKOU] Well, the Watchdog
Center knew nothing.

439
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:30,666
[KINTOKI] Makes you wonder if
they're even doing their jobs.

440
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:32,750
[RAIKOU]
A Horror!

441
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,416
[WIFE]
A Makai Knight?

442
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,208
I recognize you.

443
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:40,291
Masamune's wife.
You killed all those women!

444
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:43,333
If you harbored this kind
of darkness against Masamune,

445
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,125
why not just kill him
instead of innocents!

446
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,333
[WIFE] You know even less
about women than he does!

00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:51,375
There are no innocent
women in an affair!

[WIFE]
Don't underestimate my powers.

449
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,416
The Crimson Moon
makes me stronger

450
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,583
than the Horrors you've fought!

[SEIMEI, WIFE] I've taken
the form of the woman

who dwells deep
within your heart.

What do you think?
How can you fight your love?

456
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,416
You certainly can't
destroy her, now can you?

457
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,375
You are paralyzed
by your feelings.

[SEIMEI, WIFE chuckle]

459
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,708
[SEIMEI, WIFE]
That is the weakness of men!

No!

[RAIKOU]
Don't underestimate my powers!

463
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:55,458
I do not have the
weakness of normal men!

464
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:58,000
[WIFE screams]

465
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:04,375
[MASAMUNE] I've caused
you all so much trouble.

466
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,208
And yet, your testimonies
to the police

467
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:08,958
have cleared my name among
them and the public alike.

00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,958
This is the least
I can do to thank you.

00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,958
[IZUMI] What will you do
now that you are a widower,

470
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,708
Lord Masamune?

471
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,000
[MASAMUNE] First, I will
atone for my immorality.

472
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,333
I will pay my dearly departed
the respect in death

473
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:22,125
I never did in life.

474
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,333
You have become a better man.

475
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:25,750
[MASAMUNE]
Thank you.

476
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:29,041
[IZUMI] I appreciate how
hard you've worked.

477
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,000
Consider your debts cleared.

478
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,083
In fact, I think you
deserve a small reward

479
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,333
for your troubles
these last few days.

480
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:37,958
Thank you, but all I want
is to know something.

481
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:39,583
And what's that?

482
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,166
[RAIKOU]
The Crimson Moon.

483
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:44,958
I want to know why it happens
and why it affects the Horrors.

484
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:47,250
[IZUMI]
I'll look into it for you.

485
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:52,875
[KINTOKI]
One thing still bugs me.

486
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:54,125
[RAIKOU]
What?

487
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:56,208
Okay, Masamune's wife
killed a bunch of women,

488
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:58,875
but it was only women who had
been Masamune's mistresses.

489
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:00,666
[RAIKOU]
So what's your point?

490
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,875
[KINTOKI] So, why did
she show up at Izumi's?

491
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,750
[RAIKOU] I guess I should've
asked her about that.

492
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,791
[MASAMUNE]
She's dead.

493
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:14,750
At long last,
the demon's dead! Tehe!

494
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:18,833
[WOMEN chattering]

495
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:21,083
[MASAMUNE]
I'm a free man!

496
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:23,416
[laughing]

497
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,416
[yelping]

498
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,541
[MASAMUNE]
Freedom is rather painful.

499
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:30,708
Happiness is fleeting.

500
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,125
[INARI A]
For your master's sake,

501
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:06,791
for your own sake,

502
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:09,041
be careful of endless desire,

503
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:11,833
for it may warp
your personality.
