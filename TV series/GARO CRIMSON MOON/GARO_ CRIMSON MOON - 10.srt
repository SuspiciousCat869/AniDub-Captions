[RAIKOU]
Kintoki?

What! Did that Horror
turn you into a giant?

179
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:51,291
Or... maybe... he shrank me?

180

He did! That horror shrank me!

Sounds like Raikou
screaming from far away.

Great! What's that
Horror doing now?

yell again!

Well, somehow I
survived those rapids,

so all I gotta do is float
my way back to Seimei.

And now that I've
got my bearings,

00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,500
I'm enjoying how different
everything looks

I searched all night and
couldn't find a single clue.

I warned you two.

I said if something
involves Onmyouji,

don't go anywhere near it.

you find Raikou.

Um. Raikou is that really you?

[RAIKOU]
Yes!

218
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,250
Well, it's hard
to tell, for sure.

219

You're shrunk,
and riding a turtle!

Oh, him?

221
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,125
We met down on the water.

222
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,791
At first we didn't like each
other and fought sword to sword,

223
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,250
or I should say, sword to fang,

224
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,166
but by the end, we became
pretty good friends!

Oh, wow.

I just want to take you
and your little sword

a way to remove this spell

together myself!

Hold on. Those are

We're not putting
Raikou in those.

No, no.

261

They're from a woman who's
been shrunk, like he was!

I see!

263
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,208
All those Onmyouji
from the mansion

264
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:59,000
who seemingly vanished
had actually been shrunk!

265
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:02,000
[SEIMEI] Precisely. They were
shrunk by the Horror.

266
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,958
And then what, he just
carries them around?

267
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:05,583
That'd be weird.

268
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,458
The clothes were
covered in slime.

269
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:10,000
Have any thoughts on what
its origins may be?

270
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,250
[KINTOKI]
I don't know.

271
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:14,291
I believe that slime was
drool from the Horror.

272
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:15,833
It's Drool?

273
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:20,291
Then that means the people
it shrank were... oh, no.

274
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:23,791
Yep. It's the only explanation.

275
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,541
[YORINOBU]
High Monk Jihou!

276
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,541
[JIHOU] Hm? Oh, Yorinobu
how nice to see you!

277
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:35,208
I'm glad to see that you're
up and moving about.

278
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,833
I'd heard you weren't feeling
well and brought some food.

279
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,458
Won't you please try some?

280
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,166

281
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,500
Thank you, for thinking
of me, Yorinobu.

282
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:48,416
But I assure you, lately,
I've been eating quite well.

283
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,041
[YORINOBU] The prayers you
offered at my father's funeral

284
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,916
were very moving.

285
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,583
I never got a chance
to thank you for that.

286
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:09,541
I cannot remember a time
when your dear father and I

287

were on anything
other than good terms.

288

But tell me, now that Tada
no Shinbochi has left us,

289
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,625
what do you plan to
do with your life?

290
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,125
I'm not sure I understand.

291
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,375
Michinaga's been... corrupted.

292
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:21,750
Not by a woman,

293
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:24,208
but by the unnatural
spellcasting of the Onmyouji.

294
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:27,750
He's lost his way, and no longer
thinks of the common people.

295
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,000
I don't know.

296
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,375
If that's true,

297
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:31,708
I'm sure he has good reason
for listening to them.

but the whole capital [coughs]

will end up being destroyed.

00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,250
Wow, that's so unlike you.

319
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,916
[INARI A] The barrier they
create protects the capital.

320
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,083
Without them, it disappears.

321
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,708
And without a barrier,
it's only a matter of time

322
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,208
before the city's
overrun by Horrors.

323
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:51,916
[RAIKOU] Understood.
We'll save the shrunken--

324
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,416
There better be a good reason
why you're choosing us

325
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,125
for this job. If you haven't
noticed, Raikou's been shrunk.

326
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,916
[INARI A]
Yes, we've noticed.

327
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,583
[SEIMEI] There should
be other Makai Knights

328
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:05,000
you can turn to for this.
Though come to think of it,

329
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,583
we haven't crossed paths
with any of them.

330
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,666
Hell, with teacup Raikou here,

331
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,625
the capital doesn't even
have one to protect it!

332
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,333
[RAIKOU]
Seimei! That's not fair!

333
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:17,833
[laughs] You always think of
the funniest things to say,

334
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,958
young lady.

335
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,250
Seimei.

336
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,250
You are also deeply
connected to the Onmiyogi.

337
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:28,083
That is the reason I've
chosen you for this mission.

338
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,250
Yeah, but--

339
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,666
[INARI A]
Besides, you don't want Raikou

340
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,250
to stay that way forever.

341
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:33,666
Doesn't matter.

342
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,500
Whether he's big or small,
he's still useless to me.

343
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:37,250
[RAIKOU]
Hey!

344
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:38,708
Seimei.

345
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,708
'Kay, fine...

346
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,000
[KINTOKI]
So what's the plan?

347
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:48,791
Security at the Onmyouji mansion
is tighter than a drum now.

348
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,708
We can't lurk around
waiting for the Horror

349
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,708
without the guards
spotting us first.

350
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,208
[RAIKOU]
So then we have to learn

351
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:57,541
the Horror's identity the hard
way: By talking to people.

352
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:58,833
The hard way?

353
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,958
Fine then! Your plan is?

354
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:01,666
Hey!

355
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,791
Seimei!

356
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,791
[RAIKOU groaning]
I... can't breathe.

357
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:05,916
[Raikou!

358
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,708
Calm down. No use
causing a scene.

359
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,416
[RAIKOU]
C'mon, Seimei!

360
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,250
You're gonna crush me in here!

361
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,333
[gasps]

362
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,125
[YORINOBU]
Uh...

363
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,583
Yorinobu, why're you here?

364
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,125
Are you all right?

365
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:26,166
Yorinobu?

366
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,750
Wait. Is that Raikou?

367
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:28,416
Yeah.

368
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,250
It's me.

369
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,625
Wha... What's going on here?

370
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,375
Why's he small, too?

371
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:37,208
And why... is he all
nestled in your bosom?

372
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm the one who should
be turning red. Not you.

373
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:43,583
So, sounds like you know
something that may help.

374
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,333
[YORINOBU]
I'm sure you already know

375
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:49,708
the ones who hold the most power
in the capital are the Onmyouji.

376
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,583
They answer to Michinaga.

377
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:52,916
Predicting disasters

378
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,208
and managing various
functions in court.

379
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:58,166
At Michinaga's right hand
is his closest advisor

380
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,083
the great Onmyouji,
Abe no Haruaki.

381
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,916
[RAIKOU]
Seimei, that's your grandfather.

382
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,916
Can't you talk
to him about this?

383
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,250
There are still
the Buddhist monks,

384
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,125
but they're impotent
and mostly ignored.

385
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,916
They're given no formal
power in politics.

386
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,291
Thanks to the Onmyouji,

387
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,916
the only job they have left
is praying at funerals.

388
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And the High Monk, Jihou.

389
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,875
He refused to accept
such a fall from grace.

390
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:22,333
Just like my departed father.

391
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:25,458
He worried for the future
of the capital we call home.

392
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:26,958
Not your father.

393
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:28,458
Ours.

394
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:31,083
Even though I saw it,
I still can't believe it.

395
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:34,375
How could a holy man like
that become a Horror?

396
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,583
Seimei, please! Help him!

397
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,750
Turn High Monk Jihou
back into a man!

398
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,083
Seimei!

399
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,583
[exhales] Good grief.

400
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:45,583
I can't stand you two and
your big puppy dog eyes.

401
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,875
Shouldn't be surprised
they act similar,

402
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,958
they are brothers, after all.

403
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,541
[SEIMEI sighs]

404
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:55,500
All right, if we're gonna find
Jihou, we better get started.

405
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:05,833
[COMMONER A]
Who is that?

406
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:07,750
The only person I can think

407
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:11,333
who would ride in such
a carriage is Lord Kamo.

408
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,000
[COMMONER A]
You mean, the Onmyouji professor

409
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,583
Kamo no Yasunori?

410
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,500
[COMMONER B]
The one and only.

411
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,291
[JIHOU chuckles]

412
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,541
[RAIKOU]
Is this gonna work?

413
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:22,791
I don't think it's gonna work.

414
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,333
[SEIMEI]
Hush! You worry too much!

415
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:34,541
[YORINOBU]
What's wrong?

416
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:35,625
[KINTOKI]
If they're stopping the carriage

417
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,250
that means he's taken the bait.

418
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:38,000
Look!

419
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,041
[YORINOBU gasps]

420
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,416
[JIHOU growls]

421
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,458
[JIHOU growls]

422
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,500
Jihou! It's me!

423
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,500
[SEIMEI] I'm sorry you
had to learn this way.

424
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,958
But the High Monk is
no longer a human.

425
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:06,916
Once someone becomes a Horror,
they can't be changed back.

426
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,333
But, I thought...
maybe he would...

427
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,375
[SEIMEI] Like his victims, the
real Jihou's been eaten, too.

428
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,833
What you see before you
is a monster from Makai,

429
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:17,125
hiding in human flesh.

430
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,875
Raikou.

431
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,416
It's time.

432
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,666
I'm ready!

00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:31,708
[RAIKOU yells]

434
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:37,458
Ah! No! Now Raikou
got eaten, too!

435
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,166
Do something! Please!

436
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,541
Save Raikou!

437
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:44,041
Don't be so dramatic!
This is all part of my plan.

438
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:48,291
[RAIKOU screams]
Oh, crap!

00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,250
Seimei. Come on.

00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:57,750
Uh! If we don't destroy him
fast, I'll end up like them!

[groaning]

443
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,625
[SEIMEI]
All right, Raikou! Here you go!

444
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:22,416
[RAIKOU yells]

445

[JIHOU groaning]

446
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:35,750
He made it out!

00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,875
Sorry, brother.

Yes, I understand.

449

We weren't able to save Jihou.

450
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,791
But counting Tsuna and Father,

451
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,291
that's three now
who I've failed.

452
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:52,375
So what can I do?

453
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:53,791
No matter.

454
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,666
I'm once again thankful
for your help.

Get a move on, knight!

I'm tired!

00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,666
That Horror's spell
really drained me.

459
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,291
My legs won't listen
to my brain. Ah.

460
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:19,958
Then I'll make a
special meal for you

461
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:21,083
to rebuild your strength!

462
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:22,250
Huh?

463
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:24,416
[SHIKI DOLL A]
Shiki, shiki!

464
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,833
[ALL]
Uh...

465
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:29,791
[SEIMEI]
I guess that's dinner.

466
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:32,458
[RAIKOU]
I guess.

467
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,875
[INARI C]
A light unwanted.

468
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:06,416
A power, desired.

469
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,875
An outstretched hand, grasping
for brilliant, white silver.
