1
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:26,625
[MIYUKI] Ah, with this,
I will easily win your heart.

2
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:29,791
My beautiful
blue-eyed princess.

3
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:31,125
[chuckling]

4
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:33,000
Jade from a dragon's neck
gives me an advantage

5
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:34,791
over all your other suitors.

6
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,666
[MIYUKI laughing]

7
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,625
Keep up now, Kintoki!

8
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:53,458
[KINTOKI yelling]

9
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,208
[MIYUKI]
What's happening out there?

10
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,708
[MIYUKI] Hey! Get this
cart moving at once!

11
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:08,000
Wha--? You're no
ordinary house servant.

12
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:11,333
Wait, you're her.

13
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:13,708
You didn't have to come out
here to greet me like this.

14
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:15,375
I was happy coming to you!

15
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:17,416
Oh. Please allow
me to gaze upon

16
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,041
your beautiful
blue eyes, princess.

17
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:22,458
Kaguya.

18
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:26,416
[thud]

19
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,916
[gasps]

20
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:32,083
[MIYUKI screams]

21
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:35,250
Where is Seimei?

22
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:36,750
Right beside you.

23
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:39,250
Is it true that Horrors have
been attacking aristocrats?

24
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:42,375
Why would I lie? When are
you gonna trust me?

25
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:47,500
[RAIKOU]
We're too late.

26
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:49,291
[SEIMEI]
Yeah, you got that right.

27
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:53,166
[KINTOKI]
This was a bunch of people.

28
00:01:57,416 --> 00:01:58,583
[HORROR growls]

29
00:01:58,666 --> 00:01:59,750
Kintoki!

30
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:01,583
Horror!

31
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:04,083
Come.

32
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:07,958
[yells]

33
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,041
[SEIMEI]
It must be her.

34
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:18,416
The whole capital's been talking

35
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,000
about a cursed,
blue-eyed princess.

36
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:32,791
[SEIMEI]
Kaguya.

37
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,625
[RAIKOU]
Sanuki no Miyatsukomaro.

38
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,166
Started out as a bamboo cutter,

39
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:25,208
and now the old man owns all
this land and the mansion on it.

40
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,791
[SUITOR A] I've heard
some of the men in line

41
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:30,583
have bought hundreds of tickets
to see her over and over again.

42
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,500
[SUITOR B]
Oh, I know it for a fact.

43
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,541
One of them is the Middle
Counselor over there.

44
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:37,000
[SUITOR C] How irresponsible
for a public servant.

45
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,208
[SUITOR D] I've heard Kaguya
will give tasks to her suitors

46
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:40,750
so they can impress her.

47
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:43,541
[SUITOR B] I'm guessing the
richest men get the best tasks.

48
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,000
[SUITOR C]
Hey, keep quiet.

49
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,250
They might hear you and kick
us to the back of the line

50
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,208
with the ugly suitors!

51
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,333
[KINTOKI]
Hey, Raikou!

52
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,833
You're finally gonna get to
meet the princess face-to-face!

53
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,250
Here, I brought your ticket!

54
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,416
[RAIKOU]
Good job.

55
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:04,708
"The moment has come to
don the celestial robe."

56
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,750
Hey, you said this was a ticket.

57
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,541
It's just a card with a poem.

58
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,791
It's because the
police are sticklers.

59
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,875
They consider buying
tickets to be a lottery,

60
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,833
which is gambling,
so to get around that,

61
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,291
we buy a poem with the chance
to meet her as a bonus.

62
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:20,625
Ah. So that's how it is.

63
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,125
[RAIKOU sighs]

64
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:24,083
[RAIKOU] I don't think this
line's moved a single inch.

65
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,541
We're going to be
standing here all night.

66
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,416
I bet a patient man
is one of the things

67
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,375
that Kaguya's looking for.

68
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,500
[gasps]

69
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,458
Well, hello there, sir.

70
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:40,000
Have you come to save me?

71
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,916
[SEIMEI]
Don't let her get in your head!

72
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,833
You know that girl is a Horror.

73
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:46,500
[SERVANT A]
Princess Kaguya!

74
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:47,791
[SERVANT B]
What was all that screaming?

75
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,208
[SERVANT C] Are you
all right? What happened?

76
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:50,208
[MIYATSUKOMARO]
Kaguya!

77
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:51,541
Oh, my little treasure!

78
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,958
How could something like
this happen in our house!

79
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:58,083
[MIYATSUKOMARO]
No. Ootomo no Miyuki.

80
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,833
What a terrible end for him.

81
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:02,750
My child, do you have
any idea who did this?

82
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,958
[SEIMEI]
It was an evil spirit.

83
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:06,833
We heard the screams
and fought it off.

84
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:10,208
That's why it didn't have
a chance to eat Miyuki.

85
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,291
[MIYATSUKOMARO] So it's to
you three I owe my thanks.

86
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,666
If it wasn't for your help,
my girl would be dead.

87
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,791
May the gods smile upon you.

88
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,375
--[SEIMEI] Hmph.
--[WIFE] Yes, thank you.

89
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:22,416
[WIFE]
You saved our little angel.

90
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,958
[SEIMEI] At this rate, you'll
be standing here all night.

91
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,250
I said that, too.

92
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:27,875
Just know that
meeting a princess

93
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,541
isn't like meeting
a normal girl.

94
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:32,125
At best, you'll see her
through a bamboo curtain.

95
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,833
Well, then I'll have
Kintoki go check

96
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,375
to see if she's a Horror.

97
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,458
I never thought someone
who shunned women like you

98
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,916
would be so easily
deceived by one.

99
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,375
[KINTOKI]
Hey, what are you insinuating?

100
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,291
You better take
that back, Seimei!

101
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,291
We're talking about Raikou here.

102
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,833
Raikou would never allow
himself to be deceived

103
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,416
by the desires of a woman.

104
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,958
He is a man of great discipline.
He has sworn off a woman's love.

105
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:59,000
All for the sake of his
sacred duty to the people.

106
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:02,708
He has a heart made of gold.

107
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:05,333
And his body is the purest
one in all the land.

108
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:09,291
Like freshly fallen snow,
he's never touched a woman!

109
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,791
[SEIMEI] Kintoki, none
of that is a compliment.

110
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,208
Uh?

111
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:16,000
Seimei, tell me everything
you've heard about Kaguya.

112
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,166
I know the story
of her first suitor.

113
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,833
Name was Abe no Mimuraji
and he fell hard for her.

114
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:24,458
Kaguya said she'd only
accept his marriage proposal

115
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,583
if he found a certain
treasure for her.

116
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:31,083
Mimuraji did as she asked, and
then sprinted to her residence.

117
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,958
According to the
servants of the house,

118
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,958
he didn't even make
it through the door.

119
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,625
Instead, an evil spirit
cut him in two.

120
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,708
It then took its time
consuming his soul,

121
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,708
while flames carried
away his flesh.

122
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:42,916
[RAIKOU]
Bad way to go.

123
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,041
[KINTOKI] Uh, more like
the worst way to go.

124
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,416
[SEIMEI] The Negi priests of
the Shinto shrine were there

125
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,541
for the death of Kaguya's second
suitor, Miko Ishizukurino.

126
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:55,083
According to the priests,
a sacred shintai boulder

127
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:59,083
suddenly tumbled, pinning
lovelorn Miko to the ground.

128
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:02,750
Whereupon he was eaten.
While still alive, of course.

129
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:05,833
In both cases, the treasures
the men had brought for her,

130
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:08,833
well, they vanished
along with the Horror.

131
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,666
[RAIKOU]
So that makes Miyuki Ootomono

132
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,500
the third suitor to die.

133
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,000
And like the others,

134
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,708
it definitely wasn't
the work of a human.

135
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,416
[RAIKOU gasps]

136
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,750
And you think Kaguya
is this monster.

137
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:24,291
The treasures that she took
were the rarest of the rare.

138
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:28,291
Using her feminine whiles to
rip off and kill those men?

139
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,416
Please, what kind of
princess would do that?

140
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,708
This whole thing,
makes me sick.

141
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:36,000
Mm. I think in that regard, you
two are sort of the same to me.

142
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,500
[yelps]

143
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:41,166
Well, then, if she is
a Horror, she dies.

144
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,875
That is my duty.

145
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,791
[SERVANT A] Will the next
suitor please come forward?

146
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,875
[KINTOKI] So they gotta
pay just to see her.

147
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,166
And if that's not greedy enough,

148
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,875
she makes the suitors
bring treasures for her.

149
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:57,416
Even if she wasn't a Horror,
she's a mean girl.

150
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,250
Though, obviously quite
talented at deceiving men.

151
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,791
Why do women have that
kind of power over us?

152
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,916
Well, I mean, except for when it
comes to you of course, Raikou.

153
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,958
[RAIKOU groans]

154
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,000
[SERVANT A]
Everyone out of the way!

155
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,125
[SERVANT C]
Make a path for his lordship.

156
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,666
The great Marotari!

157
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,416
You stay right where you are.

158
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,375
I've seen a line-up of eunuchs
more impressive than this one.

159
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,250
Imagine, spending what
little money you have

160
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,833
just for the opportunity
to see a pretty face?

161
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:26,375
I pity men wasting precious
time on such a fool's errand.

162
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:27,541
Hm?

163
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,000
Tch. I see even some
low-born riff-raff

164
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,583
have snuck into the line.

165
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:32,750
[KINTOKI grumbles]

166
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,041
This is the last
night Princess Kaguya

167
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:38,000
will waste meeting
you impotent suitors.

168
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,291
[ONLOOKERS chattering]

169
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:42,000
I have fulfilled
the Princess's demand.

170
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:45,083
You see, I have obtained the
cowry shell of the swallow

171
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,708
to present to her.

172
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:50,958
And upon doing so, I,
Isonokami no Marotari,

173
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,708
will ask the Princess
for her hand in marriage.

174
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,208
[MIKO]
Wait! Wait!

175
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:58,166
Stop all of this
talk of marriage!

176
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,458
Looks like yet
another rich suitor.

177
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:01,791
That makes five in all.

178
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,541
How can she keep
track of these guys?

179
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:07,708
Oh, if it isn't Kuramochi
no Miko, standing before me.

180
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:10,291
And all alone,
without any servants.

181
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:12,791
[MAROTARI]
In fact, I don't even see

182
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:15,541
that you've brought the
treasure she requested.

183
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,541
[MAROTARI] That you'd bother
showing your face here at all

184
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,375
is a joke.

185
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:24,000
I will never allow Kaguya to
marry a man as dishonest as you.

186
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,416
What did you just call me?!

187
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,500
[BOTH growling]

188
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:28,458
[screams]

189
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:29,625
[MAROTARI]
You bastard!

190
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:31,708
[MIKO]
Charlatan!

191
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,041
[MAROTARI]
Insolent fool!

192
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:39,750
[RAIKOU]
Kaguya!

193
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,833
Yes, and who might you be?

194
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,625
My name is Raikou.

195
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,208
Oh, from last night.

196
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:53,000
I've been waiting for you
to come see me, Raikou.

197
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,000
[SERVANT A] Get them!
Two men jumped the line!

198
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:55,833
Stall for me!

199
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,625
[KINTOKI]
Right!

200
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:58,833
[KINTOKI yelling]

201
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,125
[SERVANT A]
Who the hell is this kid?

202
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:03,000
So, Raikou, will you
do something for me?

203
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,916
Will you save this princess?

204
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,041
[RAIKOU]
Well, if you want to be saved.

205
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,208
--[thud]
--[KINTOKI groans]

206
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:09,875
[SERVANT A]
Get away from the princess!

207
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,708
Oh, no! He's coming back!

208
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,916
Then come with me.
It's too dangerous here.

209
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,375
Kintoki, I'll leave
the rest to you.

210
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:18,416
Right!

211
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:20,583
What?

212
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,583
[SERVANT A] The princess
has been kidnapped!

213
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,833
Are you okay?

214
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,541
[KAGUYA]
Mh-hm.

215
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,000
[RAIKOU]
I'm sorry.

216
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,750
For what? I told you
I was all right.

217
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,708
[RAIKOU] I just feel like
I treated you a bit roughly

218
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,333
as we made our escape.

219
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,625
Come closer.

220
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,375
[RAIKOU]
No. I'm sorry. I'm not really.

221
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,250
[KAGUYA]
But...

222
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,625
[screaming]

223
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,041
Oh, good, you're awake.

224
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,708
[RAIKOU] I'm not supposed
to trip and fall off a cliff.

225
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,500
I'm a Makai Knight!

226
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:38,083
Damn. I can't be so careless.

227
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:46,375
Princess, my duty is to check
whether or not you're a Horror.

228
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:47,958
[KAGUYA]
Horror?

229
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:52,125
It's an evil spirit. Attracted
by the negative, feeds on souls.

230
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:56,083
Princess, would you please
tell me you're not one of them?

231
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:59,208
[KAGUYA] Raikou, I know that you
are the man who will save me.

232
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:05,916
[RAIKOU]
Wait!

233
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,833
[KAGUYA]
My father always told me

234
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:17,208
that I was born from
a magical bamboo stalk.

235
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:21,041
[RAIKOU]
That is one weird bedtime story.

236
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:24,875
[KAGUYA] But... I don't
remember anything like that.

237
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,791
I only remember two
things, actually.

238
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:32,916
First, that I am not really born
of bamboo, but from the moon.

239
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,166
And, that also...

240
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,875
...one day, a man will come
into my life bringing salvation.

241
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:45,333
Yeah, but what is it
you need saving from?

242
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:49,041
Horrors, right?

243
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,875
Then why demand your suitors
bring treasures with them?

244
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:54,166
Why do something that
only attracts evil spirits

245
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,666
that hurt you?

246
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,416
I have demanded no special
gifts from any man, not ever.

247
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,291
The suitors started it all.

248
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:03,833
They're not trying to impress
me, only jockeying for position.

249
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:06,166
Seeing who can bring
the rarest treasure.

250
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,916
[RAIKOU] So one of these men
wants you as his wife so badly,

251
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,291
he's killing his rival suitors

252
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,875
and stealing the
gifts they bring you.

253
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:15,958
His desire attracts the Horror.

254
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,416
How frightening.

255
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:21,625
[RAIKOU] Only two suitors
are still alive.

256
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:25,625
Isonokami and Kuramochi.

257
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:28,416
One of them must be the Horror.

258
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,916
[KAGUYA]
I feel so sorry for them.

259
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,583
[SEIMEI]
Hmm. So what?

260
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,416
[RAIKOU] Well, like I said,
if she's not the Horror,

261
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,000
one of the last two
suitors must be.

262
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,000
[SEIMEI]
No, not two, just one.

263
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,875
We know for a fact
it's not Marotari.

264
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,458
[RAIKOU]
How do we know that?

265
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,833
Because, Raikou, while you were
running off with the princess,

266
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:52,291
a Horror appeared
for us to deal with.

267
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,333
Oh, yeah. What happened?

268
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:57,583
It attacked Marotari,
and cut him clean in half.

269
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,541
He was surrounded
by so many servants,

270
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:00,833
it didn't bother eating him,

271
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,791
but it did take off with
the treasure he brought.

272
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:06,083
[RAIKOU] And where was
Kuramochi in all this?

273
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,333
[KINTOKI] He pulled out his
sword and went on a rampage.

274
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,333
Finally ended when
the police caught him.

275
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,833
[RAIKOU] Well, this seems pretty
obvious. Kuramochi's the Horror.

276
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:13,791
[SEIMEI]
Wrong, Raikou!

277
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,916
[KINTOKI yelping]

278
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,750
[SEIMEI]
Kaguya is the Horror.

279
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,875
And I can tell just
by looking at you...

280
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:25,083
...that you've totally fallen
for her, like the other suitors.

281
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,166
[RAIKOU]
How could Kaguya kill Isonokami

282
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,916
when she was with me
on the mountain?

283
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,291
[SEIMEI]
And she never left your sight

284
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,333
the entire time
you were up there?

285
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,416
[RAIKOU]
I'm going to the jail.

286
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,250
Kintoki, let's find
out ourselves

287
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,166
if this rampaging
suitor's really a Horror.

288
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,083
[KINTOKI]
Uh. Yes! Good idea, sir!

289
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,500
[SEIMEI]
Hold on, I'm coming, too.

290
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:50,000
[POLICE shouting]

291
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,666
Lot of commotion in there.

292
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,541
And it's coming this way.

293
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,500
He can't be far!

294
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:04,625
Find Kuramochi no Miko
at all costs! No excuses!

295
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,208
He cut down one of us.

296
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,958
I don't care if you bring
him back dead or alive.

297
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,125
They're in a panic.

298
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:13,166
So then if Kuramochi
is the Horror...

299
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,458
The princess!

300
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,791
It seems that Miko has
returned to his own home.

301
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,583
You sure?

302
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,000
Well, let's go see
for ourselves.

303
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:32,708
[KINTOKI] Ugh. His home
is like a slaughter house.

304
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:36,791
[SERVANT F] That monster stole
the jeweled branch of Hourai.

305
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,041
[SEIMEI]
That's a Miko family treasure.

306
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,416
[KINTOKI] I can't believe
he killed his own parents.

307
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,458
[RAIKOU] To do it so brutally,
and then steal their heirloom.

308
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:48,666
Now we know.
He's truly a Horror.

309
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,541
Now that he got what he wanted
here, the next place he'd go...

310
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,583
...is back to Kaguya's house.

311
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,208
[thud]

312
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:06,333
[MIKO chuckling]

313
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:07,791
Kaguya. I want her!

314
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,333
[MIYATSUKOMARO whimpering]

315
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:10,916
[KAGUYA]
I'm right here.

316
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,083
Daughter!

317
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,916
Don't come any closer! Run away!

318
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:20,333
No, father. I won't. This
is all my fault, is it not?

319
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,291
[MIKO]
Oh, my sweet.

320
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:26,083
Look. This is the
Jeweled Branch of Horai.

321
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,583
But in order for me to get it,

322
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:30,000
I had to kill so
many along the way.

323
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:36,083
Policemen. Household staff.
Even my own father.

324
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,125
This is the end for me.

325
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:41,083
[MIKO]
Kaguya...

326
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,375
[MIKO]
We'll die together in love!

327
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:46,166
Stop it!

328
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,916
[yells]

329
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:50,000
Kintoki!

330
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,041
Yes, sir!

331
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,208
[yells]

332
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,250
It isn't either one of them.

333
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,500
[KINTOKI]
Raikou, look!

334
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,083
Her parents!

335
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,666
[RAIKOU]
It can't be!

336
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:07,250
[laughing]

337
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:09,875
[RAIKOU] All this time,
it was her own parents!

338
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:22,958
[BOTH laughing]

339
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,875
[MIYATSUKOMARO]
I knew Kaguya was beautiful,

340
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,666
but I never imagined her
suitors would grow so overcome

341
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,833
with lust and greed!

342
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,375
It must be the treasures.

343
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,875
Your greed has called
forth the Horrors.

344
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,458
[MIYATSUKOMARO] I found
Kaguya inside a bamboo stalk

345
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:37,791
when she was a baby!

346
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,416
You cannot have her!

347
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,166
We'll never let her go!

348
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,333
Oh yeah?

349
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,375
That smell.
That delicious smell.

350
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:52,916
The aroma of a fresh soul!

351
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:57,250
[SEIMEI]
Two Horrors, huh?

352
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,791
That explains why
some of the victims

353
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,875
were killed in different ways.

354
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,416
How could we miss that?

355
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,583
[RAIKOU]
Nevermind. The seal, Seimei.

356
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:05,625
Right.

357
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,291
[RAIKOU]
Zaruba!

358
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,750
[RAIKOU] You devoured
the souls of all the men

359
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,958
in love with the
blue-eyed princess.

360
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,625
[RAIKOU]
You must be punished!

361
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,625
[RAIKOU]
It's no use.

362
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:00,916
[laughing]

363
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
[screams]

364
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,291
[yelling]

365
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:18,166
The shared greed of
these two lost people...

366
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:22,250
...can form an even
stronger Amalgam Horror.

367
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:23,625
[RAIKOU]
Understood.

368
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:36,416
[laughing]

369
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:02,750
[KAGUYA]
Not only did they raise me,

370
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,916
I thought of them as
my mother and father.

371
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,916
That love grew over many years.

372
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,833
Now I understand how
very wrong I was.

373
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:15,125
They're gone. You're free now.

374
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,083
[KAGUYA]
That isn't it.

375
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,750
Isn't what?

376
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:21,083
[KAGUYA] You showing up
and destroying them,

377
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:24,500
that isn't the redemption
I've been waiting for.

378
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,833
[RAIKOU] How do you know
I'm not meant to save you?

379
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,458
I just do.

380
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:35,375
I have to go now.

381
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:40,291
Farewell, dear Raikou.

382
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,333
[RAIKOU]
Kaguya!

383
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:46,333
No, wait! I...

384
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:07,125
Kaguya.

385
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:11,583
Hey, I didn't even
get to say goodbye.

386
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:12,750
So, she wasn't a Horror,

387
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,666
but she wasn't human, either.

388
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:20,458
Kaguya.

389
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:07,791
[INARI A] Making a small
wish, is that a sin?

390
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:11,750
What will become of this
tangle of complex feelings?
