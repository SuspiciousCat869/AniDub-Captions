1
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:28,041
[CARRIER]
Major Counselor.

2
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:29,875
Come in.

3
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:31,666
Pardon the intrusion.

4
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,958
The woman everyone refers
to as "The Tragic Princess,"

5
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:37,791
Suetsumuhana.

6
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:39,125
I've made it quite clear

7
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:41,916
that I wish to see her face
as soon as possible.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,083
Tell me, where is her reply?

9
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:45,666
[CARRIER]
I've invited her several times,

10
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,375
but she refuses to come

11
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:49,708
because of turbulence
in the capital.

12
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:53,000
She says that now is not
the time for romance.

13
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:55,000
I do not understand.

14
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:56,208
[CARRIER]
Sir?

15
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:59,208
A letter carrier is
meant to carry letters.

16
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:02,166
Yet this woman here,
she brings me none

17
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,208
and speaks of things
I never asked her about.

18
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:08,375
Don't you find that
a little strange?

19
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:11,375
Yes. I think it's very strange.

20
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:12,291
[gasps]

21
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:13,791
[CARRIER]
Please forgive me!

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,208
[gasps]

23
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:21,583
[CARRIER screams]

24
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,125
[gasps]

25
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:33,916
Oh, you poor thing.
Your face has grown quite pale.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,583
It's not a very good
look for you.

27
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:41,250
[TOORU]
Hm. Oh well.

28
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:53,333
[TOORU]
What a terrible taste.

29
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,250
[SEIMEI] Look, who cares
what happened in the past.

30
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,500
Why don't you think
about the future?

31
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:37,708
Goodbye.

32
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:41,250
[RAIKOU]
I understand you even less.

33
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:45,875
[KINTOKI] Raikou. You really
should eat something.

34
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,041
Come on, Raikou!

35
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:51,125
What now? What do I do?

36
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,416
[grunts]

37
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,125
You snap out of it!

38
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:57,458
I get that you're upset right
now. It's only natural!

39
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:00,208
But you really can't afford to
be in a funk at the moment!

40
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,666
In case you've forgotten,
the Light Palace was attacked

41
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,833
and the capital's
descending into chaos!

42
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,375
If ever there were a time when
your powers were needed, Raikou,

43
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,041
it's now!

44
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:12,083
[RAIKOU]
You're right. Sorry, Kintoki.

45
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,291
That a fox spirit?

46
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,500
[INARI A]
You came.

47
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:22,583
Yes.

48
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,083
And the little one tagged along.

49
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,500
It's a great honor

50
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:29,208
for me to be called to
the Watchdog Center today!

51
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:32,291
I am so, so unbelievably
honored to be here!

52
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:33,750
All right, calm down.

53
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,291
[INARI A]
What's wrong?

54
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:39,666
What's got that funny little
bean so worked up and excited?

55
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,458
[RAIKOU] Don't mind him,
he's just nervous

56
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,458
being called here
for the first time.

57
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,125
[KINTOKI]
Also, I'm not a bean!

58
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:46,375
I'm Kintoki!

59
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:47,875
[INARI C]
A Kintoki bean.

60
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:50,625
Well, I would rather you
leave the "bean" part off.

61
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,291
Try not to tease the
guy too much, okay?

62
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,750
[INARI A]
So, Raikou.

63
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,291
it appears you can finally
don your armor on your own,

64
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:58,375
without any help.

65
00:04:58,458 --> 00:04:59,708
[RAIKOU]
Yes, that's right.

66
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,625
And yet, somehow,
I still can't bring myself

67
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,833
to completely place
my trust in you.

68
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:07,208
Noted. I'll keep that in mind.

69
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,833
Oh my goodness.
You and Hakamadare.

70
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,416
How did I get stuck with
such difficult knights?

71
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,208
[RAIKOU]
Problems with Yasusuke?

72
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,000
[INARI A]
Ugh, that one.

73
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,916
The other day, when I
was talking to him...

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,500
[INARI A]
Are you even listening?

75
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:21,750
I heard enough to know

76
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:24,291
that you're pretty full
of yourself, old lady.

77
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,375
[INARI A] What did you say?

78
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,458
Yeah. I'm not taking
orders from you.

79
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,958
I do my own thing, ya got it?

80
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,666
[INARI A]
Such insolence.

81
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,916
[INARI B] I don't care for
that Hakamadare.

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
[INARI C] Gold is steadfast.
Silver is savage.

83
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:38,916
Uh, I see.

84
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,666
Now then, let's talk about
why we summoned you today.

85
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,666
Don't crowd! There's
plenty to go around!

86
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,708
Ow, hot!

87
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:57,583
Ha! Yorinobu burned
himself again!

88
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,166
[SUETSUMUHANA]
Sheesh.

89
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,958
This is why I can't leave you
in charge of anything, Yorinobu.

90
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,708
Hello, Suetsumuhana.

91
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,291
[MAN A]
Is she the one they say she is?

92
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,791
[WOMAN A] Look at her. Can't you
tell by the way she's dressed?

93
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:11,791
[MAN A]
I've heard rumors,

94
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,500
but I didn't think
they were true.

95
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,250
So did you burn yourself?

96
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,541
No, no. It's fine, really.

97
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,666
And here's some for you, ma'am.

98
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,708
Oh, thank you so much.

99
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:27,625
Pity to waste it on
an old crone like me.

100
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,250
Don't be ridiculous.

101
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:32,583
Now, please eat
before it gets cold.

102
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:36,291
Everyone's going over to
Yorinobu and avoiding me.

103
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,875
Hey there, kid,
what're you so afraid of?

104
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:42,291
Do I look like an
evil spirit to you?

105
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,583
[LITTLE GIRL B]
Mmm.

106
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,875
Then come here and get
some porridge, okay?

107
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,958
Just try not to
spill it on yourself.

108
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,750
You know, like
Yorinobu over here.

109
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:50,791
Yeah. Thanks!

110
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:53,958
[CHILDREN laughing]

111
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:57,833
All right, everyone,
get in a straight line now!

112
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,500
Okay, here you go.

113
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,416
Oh, great. Thank you, miss!

114
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,333
[YORINOBU]
Over the last few days,

115
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,083
since the Horrors
were wiped out,

116
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:15,333
the Light Palace has almost
completely recovered.

117
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:17,541
Still, the destruction
of the gate

118
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,375
caused many to lose their homes.

119
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:23,000
And as you can see,
the capital is in bad shape.

120
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,000
[RAIKOU]
Well,

121
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:27,000
will Kintou let you join us?

122
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:31,208
Look, Brother. I may not don
armor and fight like you can,

123
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:32,708
but rest assured,

124
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,583
I'll fight in my own way and
give it everything I've got.

125
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,583
Titles don't matter
to me at the moment.

126
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,750
And I've told my
commanders as much.

127
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,208
You've grown into
quite a man, haven't you?

128
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,958
I'm proud of you. You're
showing some real guts here.

129
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:46,208
Uh! You're embarrassing me!

130
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,666
If anything, it was you
who gave me the courage.

131
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,416
Well, you and...
the Lady Seimei.

132
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,458
[RAIKOU]
Uh.

133
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:57,125
So, um, what is
Seimei doing now?

134
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,791
[KINTOKI] We've been looking
for her, but so far, no luck.

135
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:03,375
Knowing her, I'm sure she's off
enjoying herself somewhere.

136
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:04,541
[SUETSUMUHANA]
Well, Yorinobu,

137
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:07,000
looks like we managed
to feed everyone.

138
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,416
Great, thank you.

139
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,958
Please, if you have a moment,
meet my brother, Raikou.

140
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:14,208
Oh, it's a pleasure
to meet you, Raikou.

141
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:17,166
Brother, this is
Miss Suetsumuhana.

142
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,458
She kindly responded
to my request for aid.

143
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,458
She has been a great help here.

144
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:24,041
It must've been tough
for an aristocratic woman,

145
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,791
making the voyage.

146
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:26,958
It's admirable.

147
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,833
I don't care about that stuff.

148
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,958
All the silly rules
and etiquette.

149
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,375
My family did put up
a bit of a fuss though

150
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:36,333
since they don't approve of me
leaving the house like this.

151
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,875
I'm sure that was hard for you.

152
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,125
No, not really.

153
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,375
But forget about me,

154
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,250
you've got it a whole lot
rougher than I do!

155
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,500
You think so?

156
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:44,958
Yes, well, perhaps.

157
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,416
Aw, you two are so
adorable together!

158
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,750
Right, don't they make
a cute pair, Raikou?

159
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,000
[SUETSUMUHANA laughing]

160
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,625
I think he's blushing!
Quit teasing Yorinobu!

161
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,416
Aw! Hey!

162
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,208
A strong woman, that one.

163
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:58,583
Gotta say, she's impressive.

164
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,166
Yes. Yes, she is.

165
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,208
[RAIKOU]
Who's that?

166
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:10,750
It's Tooru.

167
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:11,541
So that's him?

168
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:12,750
What, you know that guy?

169
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,291
Yes.

170
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:18,041
When I was young, I visited
his mansion on Rokujo Street.

171
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,916
He's considered the top
ladies' man among the Genji.

172
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,291
They call him "The Shining One."

173
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,125
[chuckles]

174
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,708
Wait, that name.

175
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:29,083
I hear people mention it all the
time in rumors of love affairs.

176
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,291
He overstepped boundaries

177
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,541
and the aristocracy
turned against him.

178
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,416
So he was forced to retire
in the country of Akashi.

179
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,583
Then what's he doing here now?

180
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:38,916
[YORINOBU]
The attack on the Light Palace

181
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,666
created a need for
court officials,

182
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,166
so he was asked to return.

183
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,541
[TOORU]
Let's go.

184
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,583
[YORINOBU] Somehow, he still
looks as young as ever.

185
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,166
He sends me letters
all the time.

186
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,791
What does he say?!

187
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:53,916
He wants to visit me
tomorrow evening.

188
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,458
Really? What is he up to?

189
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:01,833
[KINTOKI]
Whoa!

190
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:04,833
I wondered why they summoned us,
but I never expected this.

191
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:07,708
Such a spread just for
becoming a full-fledged knight!

192
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:10,750
The Watchdog Center's
really generous!

193
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:13,416
I doubt that they would give
us anything without wanting

194
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,083
something in return.

195
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,791
What're you saying?

196
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:19,833
[ZARUBA] Its possible danger
may be just around the corner.

197
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,666
You should be cautious.

198
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,250
[KINTOKI] They said they'd
give you a mansion,

199
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,208
complete with servants
and everything!

200
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,583
You should've taken
them up on their offer!

201
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:30,458
[RAIKOU] I'm more comfortable
here, just the two of us.

202
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:33,125
And I prefer the
peace and quiet.

203
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,416
[TOORU]
There's no need for words.

204
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,916
Your rapturous beauty says
more than your lips ever could.

205
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Oh, indeed. I feel the same.

206
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:52,000
I am content just to gaze
upon your gorgeous face.

207
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,541
[TOORU]
I see.

208
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,916
Well, in that case, how would
you like to help sustain it?

209
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,625
Sustain?

210
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,500
Alas, I'm afraid this is
no longer going to be enough

211
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,583
to get the job done.

212
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,041
[YORINOBU]
Girls are disappearing?

213
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,166
[KINTOU] We've had several
aristocrats come in lately

214
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,083
to report missing girls
and I'm concerned.

215
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,583
When did this start?

216
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:36,666
Only a couple of
days ago, I believe.

217
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,125
[YORINOBU]
A couple days ago. And girls.

218
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:43,208
All right. I'm giving
this case to you.

219
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:47,208
I won't let you down.

220
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,708
[KINTOKI]
Hey, Raikou!

221
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:52,208
The Watchdog Center
sent a message!

222
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,041
Well, what is it now?

223
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,166
A Horror.

224
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,875
Then I'd better go
get dinner started!

225
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,791
You can't fight on
an empty stomach!

226
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,625
Yeah, I guess that would
be a problem, wouldn't it?

227
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,416
Have your senses dulled?

228
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,458
Ha.

229
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:06,666
[SUETSUMUHANA]
What?

230
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,083
You're saying Tooru
may be an evil spirit?

231
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,083
We're not completely sure yet.

232
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:15,416
But, after looking into it, we
can't dismiss the possibility.

233
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,958
And if it's true, you
could be his next target.

234
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,541
He's going after ladies
like you, Suetsumuhana.

235
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:21,750
[SUETSUMUHANA laughing]

236
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,916
Oh, come on, you've
gotta be kidding me.

237
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,541
I mean, you know what everybody
calls me behind my back,

238
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:27,625
don't you?

239
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,416
I'm the Tragic Princess!

240
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,958
What does that mean?

241
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:34,250
With my demeanor and body type,
and lack of musical talent,

242
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:37,000
I promise, no one
considers me a lady.

243
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,708
Once Tooru gets a look at me--

244
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,541
But that's utterly absurd!

245
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:41,958
[SUETSUMUHANA]
Uh...

246
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,125
[YORINOBU]
I don't know any woman

247
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,458
with a heart as
beautiful as yours!

248
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,500
Uh, Yorinobu.

249
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:54,208
Oh, boy! You've got some
serious game, there--

250
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:55,625
[laughing]

251
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:59,291
Calm down. Yorinobu's just
trying to be polite, kid!

252
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,000
Suetsumuhana,

253
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:04,125
I think you should take
everybody somewhere safe.

254
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,416
Tooru.

255
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,166
[TOORU]
A Makai Knight, huh?

256
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:36,166
[SUETSUMUHANA yelling]

257
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:40,666
Hey, evil spirit!
Brace yourself!

258
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,000
[SUETSUMUHANA]
I give up.

259
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,833
You shouldn't be here!
Why did you come?

260
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,750
[SUETSUMUHANA]
Please, let him go.

261
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,833
Oh, and who are you now?

262
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,000
You should know,
you've been writing me.

263
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,041
[TOORU]
What?

264
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,250
That's right, I'm Suetsumuhana.

265
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,708
Now go ahead, take me.

266
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,958
Really, you?

267
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,083
So hideous and unrefined.

268
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:07,125
You truly are the tragic
princess they say you are.

269
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:08,208
What?

270
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,708
[TOORU]
Just looking at you disgusts me.

271
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,250
Get out of my sight!

272
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:15,333
But wait. I thought she
was your next target.

273
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,041
Yorinobu,

274
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:20,458
I must say that you have
become quite beautiful.

275
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:23,041
Now, let's get out of here.

276
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,333
Huh? I don't get it!

277
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,791
What could he possibly
want with Yorinobu?

278
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:32,208
Well, maybe, uh...

279
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:34,083
You know, I'm thinking
it may take a while

280
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,333
for you to wrap your head
around this one, Raikou.

281
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,125
I'll explain it to you later.

282
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,625
But for now, we've
gotta just go after him!

283
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,333
Yeah, right.

284
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,791
What's going on here,
Tooru? Tell me!

285
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,125
[TOORU] I've brought you here
because you're beautiful.

286
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:57,125
And simply put,
I love beautiful things.

287
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:58,875
[YORINOBU]
But I'm a man!

288
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,416
[TOORU] Doesn't matter
if you're a man or a woman.

289
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,333
I find all beauty delicious.

290
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:06,583
[YORINOBU] How did someone as
lucky as you become a Horror?

291
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:09,791
[TOORU] Unfortunately,
I had no other choice.

292
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,916
[GIRL]
For a common girl like me,

293
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,666
you're a dream come true.

294
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,291
Beauty is not determined
by one's status or class.

295
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,458
[GIRL gasps]

296
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:20,666
[GIRL chuckles]

297
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,208
[GIRL]
You've got a gray hair.

298
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:24,666
Don't be upset.

299
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,041
It just shows that you're
working hard for the people.

300
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,166
[TOORU growls]

301
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:38,416
No, not me,
I refuse to believe it!

302
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,041
Impossible!
I can't be getting old!

303
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:45,958
No, no, no, this can't
be happening! Not to me!

304
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,625
Are you afraid of getting old?

305
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,291
Toru, what's wrong?

306
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:53,833
Do you want a body
that won't wither?

307
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,208
But how?

308
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,708
All you have to do is
accept me as a part of you,

309
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,875
and I promise to make it so.

310
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,250
[TOORU]
Yes!

311
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:04,916
Please! I deserve to be
beautiful for all eternity!

312
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,916
As you wish.

313
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:17,583
[TOORU screaming]

314
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,375
[GIRL screaming]

315
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,875
[YORINOBU] That's your idea
of having no choice?

316
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,333
You're insane!

317
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:33,875
[TOORU]
Sanity.

318
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:36,791
It's a small thing to sacrifice
to have beauty such as mine.

319
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:40,166
[YORINOBU] Is that all you see
when you look at people?

320
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,583
No, I see food.

321
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:42,458
[YORINOBU]
Bastard!

322
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,041
[YORINOBU yelling]

323
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,500
[TOORU]
You know, I wonder.

324
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:58,083
What does a man as beautiful
as you taste like? Yum.

325
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,541
[thud]

326
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,916
[yelling]

327
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:06,833
Kintoki, please help Yorinobu.

328
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,625
I'm on it!

329
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:12,583
[TOORU] This is why I hate
Makai Knights so much.

330
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,875
Right. Yorinobu?

331
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,750
What are you--?

332
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,958
[RAIKOU]
Snap out of it!

333
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,333
Damn!

334
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,916
Prepare to die, evil spirit!

335
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,083
Oh, it's you again, is it?

336
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,291
Yorinobu?

337
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,708
He's possessed right now.
Stay back!

338
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:35,416
Why am I being forced to look
at such ugliness in front of me?

339
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,291
Do you not find
her offensive too?

340
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:41,791
Yes, I find her very
offensive as well.

341
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,291
Stop, Yorinobu!

342
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,916
You're the one that told me
that I had a beautiful heart.

343
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,041
Remember!

344
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,458
[YORINOBU, TOORU]
Silly girl.

345
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:53,166
The word "beautiful" describes
my features, not yours.

346
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,666
True beauty is on the inside.

347
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,541
It's a person's heart
that makes them beautiful.

348
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,708
Suetsumu...

349
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,375
Come on,

350
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,291
don't let an ugly monster
like this guy control you!

351
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:12,625
[TOORU]
Me, ugly?

352
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,791
What, are you blind, girl?

353
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,416
I'm beautiful!

354
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:23,458
[yelling]

355
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,458
Now, Seimei!

356
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,083
Lingering feelings, eh, Raikou?

357
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,583
Oh, shut up!

358
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:50,000
[MASKS laughing]

359
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,375
[yells]

360
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,625
[RAIKOU]
The moon.

361
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:37,416
[yelling]

362
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,583
[RAIKOU]
I have to protect her!

363
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,416
[gasps]

364
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,875
[laughing]

365
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:03,916
[YORINOBU]
He won't hurt you.

366
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,125
I swear on my life,
I won't let him.

367
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,916
[SUETSUMUHANA]
Yorinobu!

368
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,333
[RAIKOU]
Yorinobu!

369
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,333
I'll protect you all!

370
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,208
[growls]

371
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,000
Go, Raikou!

372
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:33,208
[yelling]

373
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:58,833
[YORINOBU]
Brother. Kintoki.

374
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:02,250
Please, forgive me,
Suetsumuhana.

375
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:04,583
I'm so sorry.
I would never hurt you.

376
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:07,041
[SUETSUMUHANA] You're the first
man to ever stand up for me.

377
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,916
That was very brave of you.

378
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,125
I'm grateful for that, and
your kindness makes me happy.

379
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:19,333
I was right. You
truly are... beautiful.

380
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:21,000
[SUETSUMUHANA]
No! Yorinobu!

381
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,500
[KINTOKI]
It's okay.

382
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,708
He just passed out, that's all.

383
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:31,750
[RAIKOU] Seimei. It's true
that humans are weak.

384
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,708
That's why they continue
to spread darkness

385
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:36,166
and turn into Horrors.

386
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,375
You may not be able to forgive
them for their weakness,

387
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:44,458
but I'll still fight
to protect the people.

388
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:48,916
If we should meet
again, this time...

389
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:57,166
So it has begun.

390
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,500
[INARI B, INARI C]
It has begun.

391
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:00,750
[DOUMAN]
Beautiful.

392
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:03,625
It's as if the moon
were stained with blood.

393
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:07,375
[DOUMA]
This is the Crimson Moon.

394
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:08,708
[RAIKOU]
Zaruba.

395
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:11,500
I'm starting to think your
prediction may be right.

396
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:14,083
[ZARUBA]
I take no pleasure in that.

397
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:19,000
I swear, no matter what happens
next, I will not give up.

398
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:05,708
[INARI A]
It doesn't matter the era.

399
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:10,458
Some things never change.
Such is mankind.
