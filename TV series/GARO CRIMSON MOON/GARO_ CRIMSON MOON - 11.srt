You that thief from the capital?

2
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:26,958
Hakamadare?

3
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:27,666
Yeah.

4
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,375
That's me, all right.

5
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:32,791
I was surprised when this was
suddenly delivered to me.

6
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:36,708
The man who requested to meet
me, your boss, Tenkaimaru.

7
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:40,375
He controls all the thieves in
the old Southern Capital, right?

8
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:42,583
I hear he's also a man of honor,

9
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:46,875
that he's ordered you to
steal only from aristocrats.

10
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:50,250
So what would a man like this
want from someone like me?

11
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:53,250
You can go ask him right now.

12
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:54,833
Come on through.

13
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,625
[YASUSUKE]
So, you sent for me?

14
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:09,250
Hakamadare, or should I say
"Fujiwara no Yasusuke."

[YASUSUKE gasps]

16
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:11,375
Why lose that name?

17
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:12,833
It's a good one.

18
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:14,458
'Cause I'm not a fool.

You can't defend the weak,
with a name of the wealthy.

[laughs]

21

Well it certainly
wasn't a mistake

22
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,333
to have you come down here.

23
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:28,125
I've heard a lot about
your work in the capital.

24
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:31,250
It's not everyday
rumors are true.

25
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:33,125
Hakamadare.

00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:36,125
I think you're a man
I can work with.

[MICHINAGA]
A major problem has arisen.

29
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,041
It seems the Rajou gates alone

30
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,541
are no longer
enough to guard us.

31
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:28,000
Suzaku Avenue
has one going up.

32
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,250
The Raise Gate.

33
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:32,041
Construction is supposed
to be finishing soon.

34
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,416
Good. Push them to
finish even faster.

35
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,458
Yes.

36
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,291
It will be the
strongest built yet.

37
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,916
In fact, with the spells
of Haruaki's Onmyou,

38
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,666
it'll be impenetrable.

00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,916
[grunts] Wait, Haduaki?

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,583
Don't be alarmed, Yasunori.

41
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,750
You'll be responsible
for using your magic

42
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,416
to protect the Light Palace.

[YASUNORI grunts]

44
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,583
And with that,

45
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,875
no evil spirit will ever again
set foot in the capital.

46
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,916
Or to be more specific, my lord,

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,791
no evil will ever again set
foot in the Light Palace.

48
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,958
But what if you're wrong?

49
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,375
[KINTOU]
Hm?

50
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,500
[YASUMASA] I take it you still
want the Golden Armor.

51
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:10,375
Tada no Shinbochi made a promise
to give it to his son, Yorinobu,

52
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,708
who would in turn,
be loyal to you.

53
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,583
Thus making it yours to command.

54
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,458
But none of that came to pass.

55
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:19,666
The man who goes by the name
"Raikou" inherited the armor.

56
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,250
He lives with Seimei.

57
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,333
Haruaki's granddaughter.

[gasps] My lord is
that why you want her?

59
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:28,791
I mean, you want Seimei
in this house under you?

60
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,750
To attain the Golden Knight?

61
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,125
[MICHINAGA]
Yes, of course.

62
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:35,500
She can help protect
this palace.

63
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,250
We'll bring them
both in at once.

64
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,416
Even by force, if need be.

65
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,125
[MICHINAGA]
No, there's no point in that.

66
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:44,791
She'd never cooperate, anyway,
if here under duress.

67
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:47,333
Which makes the Armor
useless to us.

68
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:48,708
She's placed a spell on it

69
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:51,416
that prevents Raikou
from using it on his own.

70
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,666
Well then.

71
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,791
This is quite the mess.

If I may be so bold, my lord.

73
00:04:56,916 --> 00:05:00,416
We could find a Makai Knight
other than the Golden one.

74
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,458
Just as that armor is
passed down the line

75
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,708
of the Minamoto
family, it is said

the Southern Fujiwara clan
passes down the Silver Armor.

it is these days.

[IZUMI]
Did you say silver armor?

154
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,500
[YASUMASA]
Yes, it's like an heirloom,

155

passed down from one
generation to the next

156

in the Fujiwara

they say this handover
always happens in secret.

00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,875
Or ever existed
in the first place.

161
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:24,958
Interesting.

162
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,916
I can say it still exists.

163
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,125
And there're a few places
it could be hiding.

164
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,750
Here, go through this list

165
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,750
and you'll find it sooner
or later, I'm sure.

166
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:34,791
Well, thank you!

167
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,375
Uh!

168
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,333
What?

169
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,125
Hand shake?

170
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,875
Do I look like a dog
doing a trick?

171
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,916
[sighs] Money, right?

172
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,583
You are one hard lady.

173
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:49,333
[IZUMI laughs]
Thank you!

174
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,416
[YASUSUKE]
Hm?

175
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,833
Sure would be nice if they built
a wall to protect everyone.

176
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,333
Damn aristocrats.

177
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,375
All they ever worry about is
protecting the Light Palace.

178
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:05,625
Uh!

179
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:39,833
Oh?

180
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:41,125
Is he the one?

181
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,000
[YASUMASA]
Yes, my lord.

182
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,416
My little brother.

183
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,500
Yasusuke!

184
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,083
Come over here!

185
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:50,833
[MICHINAGA]
It's nice to meet you.

186
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:53,458
Looks like this year's crop
of young service candidates

187
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,000
is our best yet.

188
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:58,416
I've heard the Emperor
himself is quite pleased.

189
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,916
Devote yourself fully
during your time here.

190
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,291
It will not only ensure you're
chosen for the service,

191
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,708
it'll pave your path
to success in life.

192
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:06,958
Yes!

193
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,625

[NARIMICHI screams]

[YASUSUKE]
Narimichi, wait!

199
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:05,708
Hold on.

200
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,458
Why'd you push
yourself like that?

201
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:11,166
Because you were
blocking my path.

202
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,750
Shoulda been me.

203
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,208
I was supposed to be the first
chosen from our class, not you!

204
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,041
You'll have plenty
more chances.

205
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,791
Your ankle can't be
that bad, right?

206
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,458
There's no next year
for me, I'm too old!

207
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:22,958
But...

208
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,000
[NARIMICHI]
Well, Yasusuke.

209
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,541
I'm impressed you
remembered our old school.

210
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,291
It's been a long time.

211
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,708
Narimichi.

212
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,333
So you are behind the killings.

213
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:46,666
Last I had heard you died
from fever years ago.

214
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:50,708
Can't you just be
happy to see me?

215
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,250
Death-by-kemari ball?

216
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,333
Well, you sure got my attention.

217
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:58,916
But why hit my crews first
instead of coming right at me?

218
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,041
[NARIMICHI] Because I
didn't want to kill you.

219
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:04,875
I just wanted to play kemari
with you, without distraction.

220
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,750
Like the old days.

221
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,875
Huh? What's wrong?

222
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,083
C'mon, let's have some fun.

223
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,625
[YASUSUKE]
How is this fun?

224
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,333
[NARIMICHI] 'Cause you're
with an old friend.

225
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:18,125
Or are you saying, I'm still not
good enough to play with you?

226
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,916
If that's it...

227
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:28,416
[NARIMICHI laughs] Maybe this
will change how you feel.

228
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:32,541
You didn't really die from a
fever, you just became a Horror.

229
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:35,000
[NARIMICHI]
Let's play ball!

230
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,125
[YASUSUKE]
Ah!

231
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,125
[RAIKOU growls]

232
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,583
[NARIMICHI grunts]

233
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,333
Yasusuke.

234
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:57,708
Are you still in one piece?

235
00:12:57,791 --> 00:12:58,500
You?

236
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,500
You're the Golden Knight?

237
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,416
[TOSHINAGA]
Oh?

238
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,125
Long time since someone
asked about silver armor.

239
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,500
[YASUMASA] If you know anything
about it, please tell me.

240
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,583
I've visited every
branch of the family,

241
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,458
begging for even the tiniest
morsel of information.

242
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:28,708
You're the last one on my list
who can help, Toshinaga.

243
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,125
[TOSHINAGA exhales]

244
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:33,666
[YASUMASA] I would be grateful
for anything, please.

245
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,333
I have never seen the
armor with my own eyes.

246
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,208
Last I heard, it was
in the possession

247
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,791
of theFujiwara no
Tokitada family.

248
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:43,083
Tokitada, you say?

249
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,375
Then that means...

250
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:45,791
That's right.

251
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,166
He fell out of favor
with Lord Michinaga.

252
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,625
With no hope to improve
his court standing,

253
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:53,125
he vanished from the
capital, or worse.

254
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,625
[YASUMASA]
Hm...

255
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,625
[TOSHINAGA]
This armor.

256
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,625
No one has seen it
for generations.

257
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:01,541
We only know it exists based
on word-of-mouth stories.

258
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:06,500
And now with Tokitada dead or
missing, we may never know.

259
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:09,291
[YASUMASA]
Thank you, Toshinaga.

260
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,541
[YASUSUKE]
Well, you gave me a surprise.

261
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,708
Honestly, I never
would've expected

262
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,208
you to be the Golden Knight.

263
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,125
Yeah, he's pretty impressive.

264
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:22,291
The magic behind the armor
ensures it's only passed down

265
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,958
to one most worthy in a
Makai Knight's family.

266
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:26,375
Right.

267
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,875
Family.

268
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,208
That Horror.

269
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:30,750
What do you know about it?

270
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,416
Is it related to you?

271
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,583
Did it live in
this mansion once?

272
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,208
What'll you do to it?

273
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,916
Well, we'll find it
and we'll kill it!

274
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,500
There are many evil
spirits in the capital.

275
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,416
It's my duty to stop them.

276
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,458
I see.

277
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:46,708
Thanks for the help,

278
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:49,625
but I'd rather take care
of this problem myself.

279
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:52,000
[RAIKOU] Listen! I know
that you know how to fight,

280
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,833
but a normal human
can't take him.

281
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:56,416
Leave this one to us.

282
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,916
[YASUSUKE] I don't like
people who meddle.

283
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:06,125
[KINTOKI]
Raikou.

284
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,666
Did you see it, as well?

285
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:11,166
The metal bracelet he was
wearing on his left wrist.

286
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,125
Small world, huh?

287
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:20,500
[GORUBA laughs] Why didn't
you tell him about us?

288
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,750
It's too soon.

289
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:29,416
I'm Tenkaimaru, but a long time
ago I answered to the name

290
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,458
Fujiwara no Tokitada.

291
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:34,541
Now I help the weak having
left behind the life

292
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:38,041
of the aristocrat. Never in all
my years in the wilderness

293
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:40,541
did I expect another to
appear in my bloodline

294
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,791
who shared my ideals.

295
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:46,375
[YASUSUKE groaning]

296
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,583
The secret is to hold
it up with your soul.

297
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:57,791
With your heart.

298
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,750
Not brute force alone.

299
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:04,333
Follow this teaching and it
becomes lighter than a feather.

300
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:07,583
Holding the Makai sword aloft
is only the first step.

301
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,416
You must also learn to wield it

302
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,291
as effortlessly as you
move your own arm.

303
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:15,250
Just hold on, wait a second.
I haven't agreed to this.

304
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:18,125
The usual way would be
that I become your mentor

305
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,666
and train you for years.

306
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:23,750
But, unfortunately, I don't
have much time left for that.

307
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,083
Are you dying?

308
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,041
[TENKAIMARU]
He may not look like much,

309
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:30,500
but this is who will
train you in my place.

310
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:33,416
Stop your running, Hakamadare.

311
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,083
Turning your back and leaving
the life of the aristocrat

312
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:40,291
doesn't enable you to
avoid your destiny.

313
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:44,208
It is your duty in life
to protect the innocent.

314
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:50,458
[YASUSUKE]
His ramblings about destiny.

315
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:52,500
[YASUSUKE]
And just when I thought

316
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:56,166
I was free to do
whatever I wanted.

317
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,791
[GORUBA] That's the crest
of a Fujiwara descendant.

318
00:16:58,875 --> 00:16:59,791
Yeah.

319
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:02,000
Same family I left
to be a thief.

320
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:05,625
Funny how the past has a way of
coming back to haunt you, huh?

321
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:08,791
Now you're saying it's
my destiny to be a hero?

322
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:12,125
Heh. Am I supposed
to laugh or cry?

323
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,458
[gasps]

324
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,166
[YASUSUKE]
Back so soon?

325
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:21,416
Are you finally ready to play?

326
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,125
Why'd you do it, Narimichi?

327
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,291
For what?

328
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:25,625
Huh?

329
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,375
[YASUSUKE] You were still
advancing in the ranks.

330
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:30,416
Why give it all up
to become a Horror?

331
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,083
[NARIMICHI]
Advancing?

332
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:35,875
Well, maybe that's how
others saw my life unfold!

333
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,875
But it was hardly the fate
deserved by someone

334
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,166
with my bloodline,
skills, and potential!

335
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,458
In fact, it was just offensive!

336
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:46,666
Status, house, wife...
all came up short!

337
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,875
I remember as a child how my
life was as bright and perfect

338
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:52,041
as a full moon at the
mid-autumn festival!

339
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,625
Until that day.

340
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:58,625
All the failures in my life came
from a single, sprained ankle!

341
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:01,250
And the biggest disappointment
of them all...

342
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:04,541
There I was, in what should
have been the prime of my life,

343
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,125
dying from a routine fever.

344
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,166
[YASUSUKE]
I see.

345
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,875
So the rumors of you dying from
the plague were true, after all.

346
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,708
That's right, and
it's all your fault.

347
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,000
The life I should have
had was stolen from me,

348
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,458
and it's all because of you!

349
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,625
I don't care how
much you hate me.

350
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,166
You got that?!

351
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,750
Your resentment is still not
an excuse to become a Horror!

352
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,833
High social status
and a big house.

353
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:34,291
Living the high life
as an aristocrat?

354
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,208
You fell for a worthless lie.

355
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:39,791
[NARIMICHI] Yeah, but now that
I'm a Horror I feel great!

356
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,000
[NARIMICHI]
You're talented!

357
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:44,291
But that's to be expected
from the first boy

358
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,958
chosen during youth
service selection!

359
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:50,041
Ah. Why do you have
that blank face?

360
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,375
Are you afraid?

361
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:52,583
No.

362
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,125
I'm sad.

363
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:58,250
That your soul had become so
rotten that you became a Horror.

364
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,833
I look at you now
and feel only pity.

365
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,166
[NARIMICHI]
You pity me?

366
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,708
Impossible.

367
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:09,125
A worthless man cannot pity
a being as strong as I!

368
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,541
What's that?

369
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,500
[YASUSUKE grunts]
Enough!

370
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:18,583
Narimichi!

371
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:20,250
[NARIMICHI]
I'll devour them all.

372
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,916
Your friends, subordinates,

373
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,166
every one from the service
selection all those years ago.

374
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,708
They will know my revenge!

375
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,958
[laughing]

376
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,250
[gasps] Yasusuke.

377
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,000
What?

378
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,291
What are you doing?

379
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,791
[NARIMICHI]
Oh, look who came.

380
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,125
Perfect timing, too!

381
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:43,750
Because I blame you just
as much as your brother!

382
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,875
After all, if he'd never
directed Michinaga's attention

383
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:50,208
onto you, there's no telling
what I would've have achieved!

384
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,208
I will make you atone.

385
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,666
I will quell the
hunger within me

386
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,666
by devouring your paltry souls!

387
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,375
[YASUSUKE grunts]

388
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,125
[GORUBA]
It's true we didn't have time

389
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,916
to do things the
traditional way.

390
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,208
But the training we did manage,
you survived quiet well.

391
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:15,583
Thanks. I thought you
were trying to kill me.

392
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:23,291
[TENKAIMARU] That is the face
of a man prepared to serve.

393
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:28,500
Well then. Do you
feel ready now?

394
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,708
Then on your way.

395
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:40,416
You are now a Makai Knight, the
inheritor of my Silver Armor!

396
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,041
[YASUSUKE] I have taken
the name Zanga!

397
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:46,541
And it is my duty to
kill Horrors like you!

398
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,833
I am a Makai Knight!

399
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:13,625
It can't be.

400
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:14,791
My brother?

401
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,958
[NARIMICHI yells]

402
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,833

[BOTH grunt]

404
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,625
According to the
Watchdog Center,

405
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,791
it should be right around here.

406
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:29,250
[RAIKOU] 
Well, Seimei?

407
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:29,875
[ALL gasp]

408
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,458
Well, Seimei?

409
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:32,458
Let's go!

[ALL grunt]

[YASUSUKE yells]

415
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:06,791
I don't believe it.

416
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,375
[KINTOKI]
Whoa!

417
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:10,750
[SEIMEI]
Who is that?

418
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:28,041
A Makai Knight.

419
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:06,583
[INARI A] The unchanging
weight of the hanging scale.

420
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:07,833
Be careful.

421
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:11,333
Choosing a side may very
well tip the balance.
