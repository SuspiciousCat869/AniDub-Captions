1
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:18,791
Yasumasa, go and
fetch me Raikou.

2
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:20,541
I need to speak with him now.

3
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:24,416
My Lord, that may be difficult
to arrange at this late hour.

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,291
Why not just wait until morning?

5
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:29,375
Because it's urgent
and because I said so!

6
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:32,041
Go and fetch him, hurry!

7
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:33,333
Yes!

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,333
[YASUMASA] Something's happened
to put fear in Michinaga.

9
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:40,125
But what?

10
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:45,833
[YASUMASA]
Who are you?

11
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:47,416
Why're you out here in
the middle of the night?

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,458
Hm?

13
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:53,041
Oh, it's only you, Seimei.

14
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:54,666
You have perfect timing.

15
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,708
I was just heading over to your
place to see your friend Raikou.

16
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:01,916
Raikou. He is the Golden Knight.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,791
[gasps] What's wrong?

18
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:07,000
You don't sound like Seimei.

19
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:09,291
Kanihera! Get out
of here, quickly.

20
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:10,458
[KANEHIRA]
Sir!

21
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:22,000
[YASUMASA yelps]

22
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:24,291
[YASUMASA groaning]

23
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:35,125
[KANEHIRA whimpers]
She killed him!

24
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:47,916
Fujiwara no Yasumasa.
Such a foolish man.

25
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,625
Hey.

26
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:42,416
Isn't that same red
lightning from before?

27
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,875
That's right.

28
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,041
[INARI A]
Now you listen, to me.

29
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,166
I am giving you an order.

30
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:05,625
You have to destroy Rudra's
current vessel--Seimei.

31
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,958
[INARI A]
Oh! I almost forgot!

32
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:13,625
There's something we must
give you that may be of help.

33
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:16,833
Carry this orb with you
on this latest quest.

34
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:21,875
[YASUSUKE]
Hm?

35
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:24,083
[INARI A] You have lost
to Rudra once already.

36
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,458
You simply don't
have the strength

37
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:27,875
to face its power alone.

38
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,000
[INARI B]
We don't have any time to spare.

39
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,000
It looks like--

40
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:34,458
Inside that orb is Madou Fire.

41
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:35,875
Your Madou tool, Goruba,

42
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,750
will instruct you
on its proper use.

43
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,583
[YASUSUKE]
If Seimei is our enemy,

44
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:45,625
I can't ask Raikou
for help killing her.

45
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,333
[YASUSUKE]
I must do this alone.

46
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:59,708
[SERVANTS weeping]

47
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,250
[YORINOBU]
What's going on here?

48
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,791
[SERVANT 20A]
Yorinobu!

49
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,666
[SERVANT 20B]
It's Yasumasa!

50
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,750
[SERVANT 20AA]
He's dead!

51
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:10,291
It can't be! Yasumasa, no!

52
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:14,000
Who would do this? Why him?

53
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:18,208
But my Lord. It was Seimei.

54
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:19,250
[gasps]

55
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,041
I refuse to believe that.
Seimei would never.

56
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,583
[YASUSUKE]
Well, now I know.

57
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:28,583
My brother's dead
and Seimei did it.

58
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,875
[YORINOBU]
Yasusuke.

59
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:34,083
[YASUSUKE] I just received
a pretty dangerous job.

60
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,041
So I figured I'd come
see my brother.

61
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:39,541
I actually thought I might
be the one who died today.

62
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:46,375
[YASUSUKE]
My brother...

63
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:49,750
Yasumasa!

64
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,583
Why, dammit?

65
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,083
[YASUSUKE grunts]

66
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:04,208
[YASUSUKE yells]

67
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:06,708
Did you hear, Raikou?!

68
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:10,416
It's Yasumasa! He's been
murdered... by Seimei!

69
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,666
[RAIKOU]
What?!

70
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:19,583
There's no way...
She couldn't have!

71
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:23,416
[KINTOKI]
Where're you going?

72
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,250
[RAIKOU]
The Watchdog Center.

73
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:26,291
Uh!

74
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,375
[RAIKOU]
Take care of Kaguya.

75
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:31,166
Yasusuke might still be
staying with the Inari.

76
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,875
I need to be the one to tell
him so he doesn't act rashly.

77
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,541
[RAIKOU] He's already left?
Do you know where?

78
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:43,083
[INARI A] No, but I did
order him to kill Seimei.

79
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,916
Since you've been
dragging your feet.

80
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,791
[RAIKOU]
Kill!

81
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,458
No, there's still good in her.

82
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,583
And we don't even know
what really happened!

83
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,625
We know she murdered
Yasusuke's brother

84
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:54,500
and that's enough for us.
Golden Knight.

85
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,750
If you do not clear your
heart of your emotions,

86
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,958
and fulfill your duty, many
more innocents will die.

87
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,291
[RAIKOU grunts]

88
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,666
[INARI B] There's no
time left to hesitate.

89
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,125
The moon glows
redder every hour.

90
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,541
[INARI C]
And the lightning increases

91
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,583
in its violence and intensity.

92
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:13,041
The time of his resurrection
is almost at hand.

93
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,375
[INARI A] We must not allow
Rudra back into this realm,

94
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:18,875
no matter what! Will you do
whatever it takes to stop him?

95
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,916
Even if that means
killing Seimei?

96
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:30,333
The Golden Knight abandons
us in our darkest hour.

97
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,625
We will be okay.

98
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,375
We still have the
Silver Knight on our side.

99
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,208
He will cut down Seimei.

100
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,750
Whereas Raikou has love,

101
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,291
he will have hate for his
brother's murderess.

102
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:43,916
Such are the many complex
sides to human emotion.

103
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,625
[RAIKOU]
You don't have to hide.

104
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:58,000
I know you've been
following me, Yasusuke.

105
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,583
I bet you'd hoped I was Seimei.

106
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,125
I'm hoping to find out why
you're following me home.

107
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,916
I've been watching you all day,

108
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,375
since you left your house.

109
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:09,875
Seimei is targeting
you, too, after all.

110
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:12,583
Perhaps, but did
she really do it?

111
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:15,125
Did she cut down your brother?

112
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,458
[YASUSUKE grunts]

113
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,833
[RAIKOU]
No, I'm so sorry.

114
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,916
If only I could have brought
her back to the light sooner.

115
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,500
[YASUSUKE]
Rudra's taken over Seimei!

116
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,708
All we can do is kill her!

117
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:29,291
[RAIKOU] No! You're wrong!
She can still be saved--

118
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,916
[DARK SEIMEI]
Golden Knight.

119
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,958
[RAIKOU, YASUSUKE gasp]

120
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,916
[RAIKOU]
Seimei.

121
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,583
Tonight you shall
meet your doom.

122
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:43,208
So it's true. I didn't believe
you killed Yasamasa.

123
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,750
[DARK SEIMEI]
That was his name?

124
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:47,791
[RAIKOU] There was no reason
for him to be a target of yours!

125
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,125
I don't make a habit of
remembering the details

126
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,333
of every bug I flatten.

127
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,583
You evil, murdering,
witch! I'll kill you!

128
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,000
[RAIKOU]
No, wait!

129
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,208
[YASUSUKE yells]

130
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,541

[yells]

132
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:06,916
Hold on!

133
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,458
Stay out of my way, Raikou!

134
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,750
You're not thinking clearly.
You're attacking out of rage!

135
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,083
She killed my brother!

136
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:15,041
No matter who you fight,
if anger fuels your fire,

137
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,666
it'll just darken your heart!

138
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,458
Making it easier for a
Horror to possess you.

139
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,000
So what?!

140
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:24,333
All that matters is avenging
my brother, by killing Seimei!

141
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:27,958
[DARK SEIMEI]
You're free to try to stop me.

142
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:31,833
I just hope you're
prepared to die tonight.

143
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,750
This fight will be your last!

144
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,583
[YASUSUKE]
I will avenge my brother.

145
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,375
With this...

146
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,750
Uh!

147
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,875
Oh? Fire, huh?

148
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,208
Well, then...

149
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:07,166
[YASUSUKE]
Hell, no! You don't get to run!

150
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,791
You're too slow. [laughs]

151
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,125
[YASUSUKE]
Dammit!

[exhales] Yasuske.

153
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,500
[ZARUBA] He's completely
consumed by his own anger!

154
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:27,916
I'm well aware.

155
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,958

[YASUSUKE]
Move, Raikou! Or else!

[BOTH grunt]

161
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,958
Well, Kaguya, any thoughts
on how to stop this?

162
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,166
Hey! Wait!

163
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,458
No, where are you going?!

[grunts, screams]

00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,458
[RAIKOU]
Yasusuke, listen!

166
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:14,750
Seimei is drowning in darkness,
but she can still be saved!

167
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,083
She just needs my help!

168
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,750
[YASUSUKE]
You're in denial!

169
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,708
[YASUSUKE groans]

170
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,791
[YASUSUKE]
Ha. Gotcha-- Ah!

171
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:34,250
[YASUSUKE growls]
She won't get away with this!

172
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,416
[RAIKOU]
No!

173
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,041
[DARK SEIMEI chuckles]

174
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,875
[YASUSUKE] Raikou, can't you
see Rudra's taken over her?

175
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:44,875
She's gone!
There's nothing you can do now!

176
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,750
[RAIKOU] No, there's
still good in her heart!

177
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,166
[YASUSUKE]
Where was that good when she

178
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,833
was murdering my brother?!
The girl you knew is dead!

179
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:54,916
[RAIKOU] She is not dead!
She's just possessed!

180
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,625
Oh, man. The Golden Knight
versus Silver Knight!

181
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,208
Disagreement.

182
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:08,500
[RAIKOU grunts]

183
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:20,416
[RAIKOU] I know your pain,
but I can't let you kill her!

184
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,291
[YASUSUKE] If my words
can't get through to you,

185
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,125
then my sword will!

186

[YASUSUKE yells]

187
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:42,458
[RAIKOU groans]

188
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:54,625
[YASUSUKE] This is for
murdering my brother!

189
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,166
[DARK SEIMEI gasping]

190
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,666
Seimei!

191
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,583
She's... Oh, no!

192
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,958
[YASUSUKE]
I've avenged your death.

193
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,250
My dear brother.

194
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:17,291

[YASUSUKE gasping]

196
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,750
[YASUSUKE]
What?

197
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,583
[YASUSUKE]
What the...?

198
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:51,000
You just... You saved
me from that blast.

199
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,541
There's an old saying.

200
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,291
[YASUSUKE gasping]

201
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:02,041
That affection is not
the same as fixation.

[YASUSUKE gasps]

203
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,625
[YASUSUKE]
Oh, no.

204
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:14,375
You dare disrespect me...
Makai Knight.

205
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:15,875
Seimei!

206
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,208
Rudra has resurrected her!

207
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:20,833
And now you die.

208
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:23,250
You and the Golden Knight.

209
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,666
Actually, my dear,
let's take a break.

210
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,541
[RAIKOU]
Wait!

211
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:30,541
[footsteps]

212
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,500
Let go of her, Douman!

213
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:35,125
[DOUMAN] The Seimei you
love no longer exists.

214
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,458
No! I refuse to believe it!

215
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,458
I'll save her!

216
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:43,000
[DOUMAN laughs]
You're a fool!

217
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,375
You hang on to hope
like it's your mother.

218
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:48,333
Your faith in the light is
what I hate most about you!

219
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,250
I said let go of her!

220
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:51,500
[DOUMAN grunts]

221
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:56,750
[DOUMAN] I will extinguish
that light in your heart.

222
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,791
Along with that of everyone
else in this deluded world.

223
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,916
[RAIKOU grunting]

224
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,875
[DOUMAN] And I'll do it all
with the power of Rudra,

225
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,916
who will soon be
fully resurrected.

226
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,625
[YASUSUKE]
Wake up, Raikou.

227
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:15,291
You have to admit that
she's gone forever.

228
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:18,791
Rudra's not here! And that
means there's still time

229
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,416
to bring back the real Seimei.

230
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:26,208
Fine then. I'll do what I must.

231
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,083
You guys, don't do it!

232
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,375
You'll hurt each other!

233
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:40,125
I won't hold anything back!

234
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,125
Same here!

235
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,083

is not hostility.

[YASUSUKE whimpers]
All right. You win.

247
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,750
I'll stop trying to kill her.

248
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:12,750
I make that vow as a
fellow Makai Knight.

249
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:17,083
But, in exchange,
stopping her falls on you.

250
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,958
I don't want any more
innocents to die!

[KINTOKI]
Raikou!

253
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:40,416
I'm okay. Let's go home
and get some rest.

00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,458
[YORINOBU]
Brother.

00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:50,041
[RAIKOU]
Yorinobu, something wrong?

256
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:53,291
Michinaga wants to
see you right now.

257
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,625
[SERVANT GIRLS gasp]

258
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,833
No need to worry!

259
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:05,166
Our preparations here
are almost complete.

260
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,833
All that's left for us to do

261
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:10,833
is harness the power
of the Madou tool.

262
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,166
[MICHINAGA]
Raikou, I have a task

263
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,958
that only you can help me with.

264
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:17,500
I'm afraid it requires the
assistance of a Makai Knight.

265
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,875
[RAIKOU]
What is it?

266
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,916
[MICHINAGA]
Kill Ashiya Douman.

267
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,083
[RAIKOU gasps]

268
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,000
Lord Michinaga.

269
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,708
I believe Makai Knights are not
allowed to kill other humans.

270
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,083
[KINTOKI]
That's true, my Lord.

271
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,416
Makai Knights can only
cut down Horrors.

272
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,125
Y'know, things that
are very not human.

273
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,166
Have you all not seen
the red lightning

274
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,541
attacking the capital
the last few days?

275
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:41,833
Surely, it is a product of
Douman's black magic.

276
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:43,500
And if his powers
are that great,

277
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,041
then he's ceased to be human.

278
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:48,083
There's no harm in killing
such a monster.

279
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:51,166
The capital is running out
of those who would defend it.

280
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:55,000
Yasumasa and Kintou
are both dead.

281
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,833
You will kill him.

282
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:02,958
I won't hesitate to kill him,
provided he's a Horror.

283
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:06,125
But, Lord. We knights
are not assassins.

284
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,916
We protect the people only
when they are attacked.

285
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,958
So then, ordering his death
makes you no different than him.

286
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:17,875
Hey! Watch what you say!

287
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,791
[MICHINAGA]
So in your eyes,

288
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:23,500
Douman and myself are
interchangeable?

289
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:26,625
Interesting. And what
makes you think that?

290
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:30,625
You both use people as pawns,
for your own personal advantage.

291
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,458
That's enough, Raikou!

292
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,041
[MICHINAGA]
I see.

293
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:39,583
Although, to me, it is Douman
and you who seem very similar.

294
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:43,958
Yin and yang.
Two sides of the same coin.

295
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:47,500
We're done here. You may leave.

296
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:01,041
[DOUMAN]
Rudra's resurrection is near.

297
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:29,375
[YORINOBU] There it is again.
That cursed red lightning.

298
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,875
Like a bad dream.

299
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,458
Yorinobu. I'm sorry.

300
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,041
Wha...?

301
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,791
I'm worried that what I said

302
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:41,041
may make your life
more difficult.

303
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:44,250
You don't have to worry
about me, Brother.

304
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:47,291
Though, I appreciate having
a Makai Knight watch my back.

305
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,708
I will be keeping an eye
on Michinaga, too.

306
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,500
I'm glad to hear it, Brother.

307
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:56,958
As for, well, Seimei...

308
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:59,750
[RAIKOU] Thank you.
I know she's still in there,

309
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,208
and I'm going to do everything
I can to bring her back.

310
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,666
Yasusuke.

311
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,958
How's he? I've not
heard from him.

312
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:09,791
[YASUSUKE] Don't tell me
that you called me here

313
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,500
just to lecture me.

314
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:13,083
[INARI A]
Of course we did.

315
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:15,125

Raiko goes against

316
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,916
the code of
the Makai Knights.

317
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,375
[INARI C]
For shame!

318
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,666
[YASUSUKE]
Yeah. I know.

319
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,833
[INARI B] We are sorry about
your brother's murder, though.

320
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:27,291
I didn't know that you ladies
were capable of empathy.

321
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,375
[INARI A] Goodness!
What do you take us for?

322
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:30,625
Horrors?

323
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:33,041
We'll ignore that insult
since you're grieving.

324
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,333
[INARI C] To the point, we have
a job for you, Silver Knight.

325
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:39,416
[INARI B] Or rather, for your
old persona of Hakamadare.

326
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,875
We need you to steal something.

327
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:47,250
[INARI A]
The preparations are complete.

328
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,791
[INARI A]
Inform Haruaki at once.

329
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,333
[RAIKOU]
Yasusuke made a vow to me

330
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:00,750
that he wouldn't try
to kill Seimei again.

331
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:03,666
But, he's still tormented
by the loss of his brother.

332
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,708
Of course... the loss.

333
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,375
[KINTOKI]
You guys, look!

334
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:09,125
Haruaki.

335
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,541
Raikou!

336
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:27,666
Now. The time has come.

337
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:28,791
[gasps]

338
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:32,458
Fetch Kaguya.
Bring her to my house!

339
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,083
[INARI A]
The feelings are strong.

340
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:06,791
Light into darkness.

341
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:10,333
In this time of
immeasurable lament.
