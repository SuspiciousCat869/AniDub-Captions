This has been
your plan all along;

3
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:23,041
to separate us so you could
seal away the Golden Knight.

4
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:25,625
That's what you
wanted, wasn't it?

5
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:27,500
[DOUMA]
Perhaps you're finally beginning

00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:28,958

[OFFICER A]
I have an update.

12
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:27,833
The Rise Gate has
been destroyed.

13
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:30,791
However, the revolt has
not spread into the city.

[OFFICER B]
Whoa...

15
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:52,125
Glad to see you're safe.

16
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,708
But where's Seimei?

17
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:55,958
All those people.

18
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,708
They lost their lives
so I could live.

19
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:05,083
[RAIKOU] Remove the seal!
Like you did before.

20
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,875
Please, let me don
my armor freely!

21
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,916
I can't do that.

22
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,666
I know you blame yourself
for what's happened here

23
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,000
and you're seething with anger.

24
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:18,000
If I released the seal
under these circumstances

25
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,833
and allowed you to summon
your armor in this state,

26
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:24,083
I'm confident it would
absolutely destroy you.

27
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,875
I came to this
realization last time.

28
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,333
While it's true you're strong,

29
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,791
you're also dangerously
impulsive.

30
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,416
Your passion is so resolute,

31
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,625
you won't hesitate to
sacrifice yourself for it.

32
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,208
That is the reason Kiyome
puts her own life at risk

33
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:39,416
to keep you sealed.

34
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,958
It's not out of some
desire to control you.

35
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:45,375
No, she does it to protect you
from destroying yourself.

36
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,083
Puts her life... at risk?

37
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,333
What do you mean?

38
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:50,916
So you were unaware?

39
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,541
Kiyome is the one who has
continuously cast the spell

40
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,416
sealing you.

41
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,791
Even as we speak,

42
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,541
it's draining a vast amount
of her spiritual energy.

43
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:02,541
So much so, she must be
adding her life force as well

44
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,958
in order to sustain it.

45
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,625
Bear this in mind.

46
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:09,833
She is the only person
capable of keeping you sealed.

[DOUMA]
So tell me.

62
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:11,916
Have your own gates of darkness
begun to open yet?

63
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,791
Once that darkness
resides within you,

64

it will never be stripped away.

Well, well. Poor Seimei.

66

[DOUMA] Never mind that.
It's almost time now.

Go.

Yes.

[SEIMEI]
Well, that's just perfect.

70
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,291
I was so worried about
looking after everyone else,

71
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:41,333
I failed to take care of myself.

72
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:42,416
Get a grip.

73
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,833
There has to be
more to their plan

74
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:45,791
than destroying us with doubt.

75
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,875
So if it's just
a means to an end,

76
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,625
what's their ultimate goal?

77
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,625

00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:32,375
[yelps] No, get away from me!

164
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:38,916
[gasps]

165
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:43,708
[YASUSUKE] Much as I dislike the
thought of saving aristocrats,

166
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,708
I hate seeing an
aristocrat-turned-Horror

167
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,958
go free even more!

168
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,375
[GORUBA]
Don't let your guard down.

169
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,000
[YASUSUKE]
Let's go!

170
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,750
[RAIKOU]
So Seimei was protecting me?

171
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,875
And she used her
life force to do it?

172
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,958
Ha, that's rich!

173
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,541
She's always repeating "It's
impossible to save everyone"

174
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:25,333
like it's her damn motto.

175
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:28,291
But I'm different.
I want to save people.

176
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:31,750
And I don't care who mocks me
for that or calls me naïve.

177
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:36,750
I swear, I'm going to save
as many people as possible!

178
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,583
Seimei has the exact same goal!

179
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,583
Oh really, you think so?

180
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:47,250
Then why'd she let
all these people die?!

181
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,625
Think about it,

182
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,708
you just saved my life
back there, did you not?

183
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:54,666
And I'm sure you'll go on
to save many more lives.

184
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,833
Don't you see?

185
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,958
Without Seimei,
none of that will happen!

186
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,375
If she hadn't chosen you,

187
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:04,041
imagine all of the future lives
that would've been lost.

188
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,083
Would you rather that?

189
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,125
Are you all right?

190
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:13,333
I'm fine.
But more importantly...

191
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,208
[KINTOKI]
Are they?

192
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:17,625
We missed it.

193
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:21,125
The Light Palace was Douman's
real target all along.

194
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,291
Meanwhile, we took the bait

195
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,958
and were distracted
by his diversion.

196
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:26,125
Are you sure?

197
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,625
There must be a Horror inside.

198
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,041
[HARUAKI]
Kiyome!

199
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,375
Why do this, Kiyome?

200
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,541
Why would you risk
going in there?

201
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,583
She's in there alone?

202
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,375
Oh, Seimei!

203
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,541
[yells]

204
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,041
Let's see...

205
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,416
When you're a Makai Alchemist

206
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,125
who's almost drowned
in your own darkness,

207
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,166
how long can you
keep up your strength

208
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,625
before you finally give in?

209
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,625
[screaming]

210
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:30,875
[gasps]

211
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:46,500
[DOUMAN] Raikou, the lost child
chosen by the Golden Armor.

212
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:49,208
It was your destiny to find him.

213
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:02,416
[DOUMAN] In a world where,
as you so insistently believe

214
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,333
it is impossible
to save everyone,

215
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:08,375
he has stubbornly
tried to do just that,

216
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:11,333
despite all of the
odds against him.

217
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:56,125
[DOUMAN] You know that Raikou
was your one and only hope,

218
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:59,250
the single light that shone
through the darkness.

219
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:02,500
And now, you've gone and
extinguished the light

220
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,041
beneath your own filthy foot.

221
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:07,125
[RAIKOU] Now we're responsible
for their deaths.

222
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,416
This is the end.

223
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,458
No, wait, Raikou!
Please don't leave me!

224
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:15,250
[DOUMAN]
I know. And I understand

225
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,583
The deep anguish you
felt chosing Raikou

226
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,125
over all the others,

227
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:22,708
and by doing so, now, you've
ironically snuffed out the light

228
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,208
for which you cherished
him in the first place.

229
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:29,166
And, that, Seimei,
was your fatal mistake.

230
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:34,333
[DOUMAN] You put up a good
fight, I'll give you that.

231
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:37,791
But now, just give in
to the darkness.

232
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:43,083
Accept it, and let
yourself rest at last.

233
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,375
[SHIKI DOLL A]
Shiki, shiki.

234
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:45,708
Shiki.

235
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,458
[SHIKI DOLL A]
Shiki, shiki.

236
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,166
Shiki, shiki, shiki.

237
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,958
Shiki, shiki, shiki, shiki.

238
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,416
Shiki, shiki.

239
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,958
Shiki, shiki, shiki.

240
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,458
Shiki, shiki.

241
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:57,916
Shiki.

242
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,666
Yeah. You know, you're right.

243
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,833
And I think I've heard
enough lectures for today.

244
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,583
[yelling]

245
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:18,791
So. You still have
some fight left in you?

246
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,083
Well, no matter
how hard you try,

247
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:24,125
you could never defeat him
in your current state.

248
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:26,375
[yelling]

249
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,916
[RAIKOU] Seimei, could you
really have the same goal as me?

250
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,416
To save as many
lives as possible?

251
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,708
[KINTOKI]
Uh, Raikou.

252
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:43,375
I wasn't gonna tell you this,
but I guess maybe now I should.

253
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,500
[RAIKOU]
Uh?

254
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:48,958
[SEIMEI] Everything that
I love shines brightly.

255
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:52,666
Which means... that you
have to shine, Raikou.

256
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,625
Seimei really said that?

257
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:55,541
She did.

258
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,125
And to be honest,

259
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,416
it kinda bugged me 'cause I know
you don't really need her help

260
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,750
to put on the Golden
Armor and shine.

261
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:04,666
But still, Seimei's
unconditional devotion to you

262
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,083
is for real.

263
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:09,250
It's just like Yorinobu
was saying earlier!

264
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:14,000
She went that far... for me?

265
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,458
[SEIMEI]
Raikou will definitely return.

266
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,750
[RAIKOU]
Because of my immaturity...

267
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,750
[SEIMEI]
He'll be by my side!

268
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,166
[RAIKOU] ...I forced
Seimei to sacrifice herself.

269
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,875
[SEIMEI] I know he will,
because Raikou and I...

270
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,208
[RAIKOU]
Well, this time...

271
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,083
[SEIMEI]
...the two of us are one!

272
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,208
[RAIKOU]
...I'll be the one to save her!

273
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:34,083
[yelling]

274
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:41,041
[SEIMEI] Raikou removed
the seal by himself?

275
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:57,375
So, you finally did it.

276
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,916
Ohh. Way to go!

277
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,208
I am the protector!
The Golden Knight!

278
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:10,791
Brother!

279
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:11,666
Raikou!

280
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,250
This must be his true form!

281
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:20,625
[yelling]

282
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:43,958
[gasps]

283
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,791
[growls]

284
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:57,125
[SEIMEI]
Is that you... Raikou?

285
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,750
[RAIKOU]
Seimei.

286
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,541
It can't be.

287
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:06,791
The Golden Knight.
How can he be here?

288
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:09,291
[YASUSUKE]
You're late, Raikou.

289
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:12,416
But hey, you're
lookin' pretty manly.

290
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,166
[RAIKOU]
If you say so.

291
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,416
[YASUSUKE]
Let's get this over with!

292
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,916
[RAIKOU]
You got it!

293
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:26,375
[yelling]

294
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:34,333
[screaming]

295
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,083
[chuckles]

296
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:52,625
You just wait until
I'm through with you.

297
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:03,250
[DOUMAN] So then, you really
hate me that much, do you?

298
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,875
Good, good.
Give in to the hate.

299
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:08,416
I'd be honored to
feed your darkness.

300
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,750
To play such a crucial part in
turning you into a Horror. Look.

301
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,416
--[DOUMAN] The gate is opening.
--Son of a bitch!

302
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,791
[DOUMAN]
It's opening for you!

303
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,291
[DOUMA]
You damn fool.

304
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:37,250
Turning your own
body into a gate.

305
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:40,500
[DOUMAN]
Why? Why did you stop me?

306
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:44,625
[DOUMA] Because you
wouldn't be able to return.

307
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:47,333
[DOUMAN] Do you really
believe that matters to me?

308
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:48,833
[gasps]

309
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:53,625
The darkness that I so desire
is far deeper than yours!

310
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:01,541
[SEIMEI]
I can't believe you were able

311
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,625
to remove the seal on your own.

312
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:04,833
Well, I guess this means

313
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:07,541
you're a full-fledged
Golden Knight now.

314
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:10,625
Guess so.

315
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:15,541
Um... Seimei, I have
to tell you something.

316
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:16,958
Yeah, what?

317
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:19,500
Up until now...
What I mean is...

318
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,875
There are so many things
I need to make right.

319
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,166
And I, uh...

320
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,958
What? You spied on me
while I was changing?

321
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:27,333
I did not!
It's nothing like that!

322
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:30,208
Oh. So you watched
Shiki change? Naughty boy!

323
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,875
Oh, give me a break!
Listen to me!

324
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,333
Look, who cares what
happened in the past.

325
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:37,791
Why don't you think
about the future?

326
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,416
Goodbye.

327
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,916
[RAIKOU]
What does that mean? Seimei!

328
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,166
Seimei!

329
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,541
[SEIMEI] It means I've
got better things to do

330
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,083
than babysit a Makai Knight

331
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:48,958
who's finally ready to
take care of himself.

332
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,791
Hey, wait! Don't go. Please!

333
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:57,666
Kiyome.

334
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,541
No. Seimei.

335
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:22,250
[SEIMEI]
Darkness, huh...

336
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,250
[INARI A]
A mirror can only distort.

337
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:07,958
True beauty lies in
the eye of the beholder.

338
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:10,500
Each and every one.
