My name is Tokiwaka.

Thought so. Tell us then.
Why not don your armor?

that this Horror has managed

But, who was that other man?

27
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,916
[INARI B]
Minamoto no Mitsunaka.

28
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,333
He's a trainee who has
yet to receive his armor.

29
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,416
He's of no use until
his body has healed.

his injuries here.

Nice to meet you,
my name's Tamagushi.

Well, sort of nice.

wasn't exactly pleasant.

But I can keep apologizing
if you want me to.

Oh, wow, that smells delicious.

Thanks, cooking's a
specialty of mine.

to take to it naturally.

Although it's a little bizzare,

68
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,250
I don't remember where
I learned to cook.

Uh. No! Just forget I said that.

71

It's impossible
to forget the thing

someone's asking you to forget.

[chuckles] Regardless.

74

Let's eat while it's warm.

Oh. It's great!

76
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:11,500

It's rabbit stew.

of not eating rabbit or deer,

80
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,833
but it's delicious.

[TOKIWAKA]
So, you mentioned earlier

84
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,083
that you snuck out
of your house.

85
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:37,791
Why take the risk when there's
an evil spirit roaming around?

86
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,666
[TAMAGUSHI] Because my husband
has grown tired of me.

87
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,333
[TOKIWAKA]
Husband? Oh, of course.

88
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,083
You... have a husband.

89
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:49,416
[TAMAGUSHI] I'm convinced that
he's begun seeing another woman.

90
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,958
He's been sneaking out at
night for some time now.

91
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:55,000
My suspicion finally
got the better of me.

92
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,166
But when I confronted
him about it,

93
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,583
he grew furious and
stormed out of the house.

94
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:04,208
And then I was so upset, I
locked myself in my bedroom.

95
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,916
But I felt like I
was suffocating.

96
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,666
Next thing I knew, I left.

97
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,583
How could any man be unhappy

98
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,416
with a woman like
you as his wife?

99

Y'know...

102

I-If you were my wife,
and I-I... I was your husband,

103

then I would never--

104
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:26,125
[TAMAGUSHI] So you are an evil
spirit that tricks people?!

105
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,458
[TOKIWAKA] No, no, no!
That's not-- That's no it!

106
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:31,291

explaining myself well!

[TOKIWAKA] Her husband's
definitely a reason for concern.

109
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,666
He started sneaking out
a few nights ago.

110
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,958
Around the same time the
Horror Shutendoji appeared.

111

Here's hoping it's
just a coincidence.

find out as soon as possible.

be a problem.

to make that request today.

All of Shutendoji's
victims were female.

123

And each one of the poor women
happened to be pregnant.

even though it's commonly
referred to as Shutendoji,

it originally called itself
the "abandoned child."

[TOKIWAKA]
What? That's impossible!

170
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,500
[INARI B]
We're certain of it.

171
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,208
[INARI A]
A female has been abducted

172
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,791
by the Shutendoji
near Shijo street.

173
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,750
I know for a fact I cut
it down with my own hands!

174
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,916
[INARI B] Well, we're having
trouble believing that.

175
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,541
You failed to vanquish it.
Now complete your duty.

Could there be another one?

[ringing]

179
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,833
[TOKIWAKA]
The sound of those bells again.

180
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:11,916
[TAMAGUSHI]
Tokiwaka.

181
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,041
[TOKIWAKA]
Mm?

182
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,291
Tamagushi?

183
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,000
[TAMAGUSHI]
So you're a Makai Knight.

184
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,833
Yes, that's why
I'm in the capital.

185
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,750
I have come to defeat
the Horror, Shutendoji.

186
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,333
[TAMAGUSHI gasping]

187
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,833
[TOKIWAKA] I tried to hide it
from you but I guess you saw me.

188
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:41,875
So maybe, y'know,
try to forget what you saw.

189
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,250
We're doing this again?

190
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,166
You can't forget the
thing you've been--

191
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,333
Wait.

192
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:47,875
Hold on.

193
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,041
Do you think there's a chance
that your loss of memory--?

194
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,458
[TOKIWAKA gasps]

195
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,875
Maybe it has something
to do with this.

196
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:05,875
When we fight Horrors,
we don a mystic armor.

197
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:08,500
It's really the only
way to fight them.

198
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:11,708
The specific armor my teacher
bestowed upon me,

199
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,375
it's unsurpassed in
strength. Although...

200
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,500
It also carries a curse.

201
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,375
What type of curse?

202
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:23,208
Believe it or not.
I'm actually a 40 year old man.

203
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,791
Forty?!

204
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,625
When I don my Makai Armor,

205
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:29,708
it takes a chunk of
my time as payment.

206
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:33,291
But as a result, my time
has also been frozen.

207
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,375
[TAMAGUSHI]
So you continue to grow young,

208
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,250
and you never age either?

209
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:40,541
[TOKIWAKA] Would you believe a
lot of people envy me for it?

210
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:44,000
You live alone in your
own different time.

211
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,125
I think that's tragic.

212
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:49,916
Well, you're the first person
I've met who ever felt that way.

213
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,250
[TAMAGUSHI sighs]

214
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,416
Whenever I remove my armor,

215
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,291
I see a vision of
a golden butterfly.

216
00:13:56,375 --> 00:14:01,458
I think it's like an echo--
a shimmer of my lost time.

217
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,875
[TAMAGUSHI] I suppose
it could be that, but...

218
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,125
What if you stop?

219
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:08,125
Just don't use it and
you can stay this way.

220
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,125
[TOKIWAKA] I've performed
my duty all these years

221
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,708
without the need for my armor.

222
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:16,583
But, this time is
different, and, well...

223
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,458
I'll be a child next
time I grow younger,

224
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:24,041
and then I'll no longer be
able to fight as a knight.

225
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,791
This doesn't have
to be your fight.

226
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,291
But I'm the only one
in the capital who can.

227
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:33,166
And I can't turn my back
on that. I can't show fear.

228
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,625
And I cannot hesitate.

229
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:40,666
[TAMAGUSHI] So that's what
it means to be a Makai Knight.

230
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,166
I'll never forget you!

231
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,291
[TOKIWAKA gasps]

232
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,041
I'll remember your eyes,
your voice.

233
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:50,250
Your warmth. Your kindness.

234
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,125
[TAMAGUSHI]
Everything about you!

235
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,416
[TAMAGUSHI cries]

236
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,500
[IZUMI] There was a
mortally injured monk

237
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,208
discovered yesterday afternoon

238
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,375
just along the edge
of the capital.

239
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,333
[TOKIWAKA]
Okay, what of him?

240
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:22,458
He used his final dying breath
to speak these words.

241
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:25,833
"There is an evil spirit
residing in Ooe Mountain."

242
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:28,333
Ooe Mountain. Interesting.

243
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:31,083
[IZUMI]
Right? So I did some research.

244
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,750
The crops of the village
by the mountain

245
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:35,250
were failing and the people
were all starving.

246
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,500
So they left the village,

247
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:39,083
deserting their children
to fend for themselves.

248
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:42,208
Deserted. The abandoned child.

249
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:46,791
It hates its parents for...
forsaking it!

250
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,833
That's the reason
why it targets women

251
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:51,375
carrying children in their womb.

252
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,958
[IZUMI]
Happiness is so fleeting.

253
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,291
[TOKIWAKA]
I heard what you yelled.

254
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,875
You said, "I have to be
the one to kill it."

255
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,750
I haven't been able to shake
those words ever since.

256
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,291
[MITSUNAKA]
My single drive in life

257
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,791
is to inherit the
armor of a knight.

258
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,833
The knights of the capital
have been falling,

259
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,375
one after the other.

260
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,291
I felt totally useless
and impotent

261
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,166
only being able to watch,

262
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,166
and I let myself be
consumed with anger.

263
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,250
A strong heart is
far more important

264
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,583
than physical strength.

265
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:28,583
One can't don the armor.
Not with a weak heart.

266
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:33,625
[TOKIWAKA] One can't don the
armor. Not with a weak heart.

267
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:36,875
I know I don't really have
the right to ask this of you,

268
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,833
but please, kill Shutendoji.

269
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,666
[TOKIWAKA]
You can leave it to me.

270
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,416
I left my house in
the middle of the night

271
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,875
without a word to my wife.

272
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,625
Aw, jeez, that's awful.

273
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:54,125
I'm so worried about her now.

274
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,208
[TAMAGUSHI panting]
I did it.

Hello, Tokiwaka.

279
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,916
I've finally made up
my mind, thanks to you.

280
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,916
You have?

281
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,125
I know that I'll succeed.

282
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,500
Uh.

283
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:18,375
And rest easy. Your husband's
not what you assume.

284

He continues to
think only of you.

Mitsunaka loves you.

286
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,375
How do you know his name?

287
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,750
He'll be coming home in
no time at all and then,

288
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:29,416
well, then he can explain
everything to you.

289
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,750
Trust me, you don't need to
close your doors any longer.

290
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,833
Are you telling me
that you met with him?

291
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:40,458
He tries to carry too
much on his shoulders.

292
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:43,458
And he's got a bad habit
of blaming himself.

293
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,333
Please keep that in mind.

Oh, I already know.

I'd like you to take
this with you.

What is it?

A protection charm.

my hair, but my hope as well.

I pray that the golden

00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,958
Running's not gonna
do you any good.

[HORROR 24A roaring]

317
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:44,625
What?

318
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,875
[HORRORS roaring]

319
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,083
So this is how you defeated
all the other knights.

[TOKIWAKA groaning]

324
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,958
I have a reason

325
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:27,375
I have someone who
needs my protection.

326
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:31,875
And now I know that I have
people who'll remember me.

327
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,666
That's all I need!

[yells]

329
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:40,083
I'll cut out your darkness.

330
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,000
Right here and now!

331
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:16,791
[KINTOKI]
Good day.

332
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,625
I've arrived to begin my service
under Minamoto no Mitsunaka.

333
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,458
Oh. I was waiting for--

334
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:22,875
[gasps]

335
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:27,208
Nice to meet you.

336
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:30,250
Please call me Kintoki,
all right?

337
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:31,875
Uh. What's wrong?

338
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,875
Are you okay, my lady?

339
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,375
[TAMAGUSHI cries]

340
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,416
Please, I want you
to hold him.

341
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,625
Huh? Uh. Well, uh--

342
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,333
[RAIKO laughs]

343
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:54,375
[TAMAGUSHI]
You saved him.

344
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:56,791
This is the child you protected.

345
00:21:58,375 --> 00:21:59,541
[TAMAGUSHI]
I'd like you to continue

346
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,916
to watch after him, okay?

347
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,333
Yes, ma'am!

348
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:06,833
[TAMAGUSHI]
His name is Yorimits.

349
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:09,833
We've all just taken to calling
him Raiko, though.

350
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:12,333
Little Raiko. I like it.

351
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:14,875
Don't worry, you can
count on me.

352
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,625
I'll protect him with my life,
no matter what.

353
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:21,041
From now on, I'll be your
attendant, Raikou--

354
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:23,416
[KINTOKI gasp, screams]

355
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,250
[KINTOKI]
That hurt, Raiko!
