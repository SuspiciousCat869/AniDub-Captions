[RUDRA roars]

2
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:03,583
I now remember all
12 parts of the spell.

3
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,083
Rudra!

4
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,708
[roaring]

5
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:08,958
With these words,

6
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:11,833
I know once more who I
am and what I must do!

7
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:14,375
I am a Madou Tool,
and with my powers,

8
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:17,291
I will seal you away forever.

9
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:19,458
[RAIKOU, YASUSUKE]
Let's go!

10
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,000
--[SEIMEI] Yeah!
--[KINTOKI] Right!

11
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:36,375
[RAIKOU grunts]

12
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:37,250
[RUDRA roars]

00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:38,875
[YASUSUKE grunts]

14
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,250
[KINTOKI]
Okay!

15
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:46,500
We'll have that giant monster
dismembered in no time at all!

16
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,750
[roaring]

17
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,041
What's it doing?

18
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,583
[screaming]

19
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:52,458
Huh?!

20
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,166
[KINTOKI]
Huh!

21
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,458
[CROWD screaming]

22
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:01,166
[RAIKOU]
It's consuming their souls!

23
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,791
[YASUSUKE] It's gonna suck up
every soul in the capital!

24
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,375
[RUDRA roars]

25
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:17,666
[RUDRA roars]

26
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,583
Is this for real?
How do we stop that thing?

27
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,708
[SEIMEI] There has to be
some way to defeat it.

28
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:24,500
[RUDRA'S LEFT ARM roars]

29
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:25,375
[RUDRA'S RIGHT ARM roars]

30
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:26,833
[YASUSUKE]
Dammit!

31
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:30,166
Until we stop it, it's only
going to kill more people.

32
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,583
So first, we need to isolate
it from the population.

33
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,791
[RUDRA roars]

34
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,833
What happened? The roar
destroyed my spell!

35
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,916
[SEIMEI, KINTOKI scream]

36
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,916
[KINTOKI screaming]

37
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,583
[SEIMEI screaming]

38
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:53,750
[KINTOKI]
You saved us!

39
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,708
[KAGUYA] I take it that you've
noticed as well, Seimei?

40
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:59,083
That Rudra is not the
same as it was before.

41
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,500
[SEIMEI]
Yeah.

42
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:05,333
This power of Rudra's--it's not
your basic regeneration.

43
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:06,750
[KAGUYA]
Precisely.

44
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:09,583
This is not the same Rudra
I sealed away in the past.

45
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,958
The one before us
is vastly different.

46
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:16,458
It was already unnaturally
powerful when I first fought it,

47
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:19,583
but this beast is stronger
than I ever imagined.

48
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:20,833
Wha...?

49
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,250
Then it probably--

50
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,875
No, I'm sure of it.

51
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:26,250
It absorbed Douman
into its very being

52
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:29,333
and it's using him as a gateway
to connect to Makai.

53
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,291
That's why new Horrors
keep sprouting up

54
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,125
to fill in the damage we create.

55
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:35,833
Is it even possible to
take down that monster?

56
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:40,125
Don't you worry. There
is most certainly a way.

57
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:44,041
All we have to do is separate
Douman's body from Rudra's.

58
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:46,250
Our first move is to
slice that creepy,

59
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:49,375
shattered face of his
from the main body.

60
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,958
And so long as a new face
doesn't grow back,

61
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:55,125
well, then we've got it
right where we want it.

62
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,500
Right, I see.

63
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:59,041
We cut out the power source
and it's back to basics.

64
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,333
The same Rudra Kaguya sealed.

65
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:02,708
Exactly.

66
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:05,166
It should be smooth sailing
from that point onward.

67
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,083
We'll only need the Makai
Knights to properly weaken it.

68
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,291
Once that has been done,

69
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:12,208
Seimei must then use
me to seal Rudra away.

70
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:15,208
Just use you, huh? You make
it sound so effortless.

71
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,416
Well, you are the only one
who can do it after all,

72
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,000
and it should come naturally.

73
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:23,708
You are the descendant of the
Abe family, so it is your duty.

74
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,375
It's just as
Grandfather told me.

75
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:34,833
The light will show me the way.

76
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,750
Now, Seimei! Invoke the
barrier spell again!

77
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,333
[SEIMEI]
Here goes!

78
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,041
[DOUMAN roars]

79
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:07,208
[RUDRA roars]

80
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,416
[YASUSUKE] You can leave
the rest of this to us.

81
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,791
All right, then.

82
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:21,083
Listen, guys. It's a pretty
straightforward plan.

83
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:24,208
The first thing to deal with is
removing Douman from the body.

84
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:27,000
Slice him out like
a deep-rooted cyst.

85
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,125
[RAIKOU]
You got it.

86
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:30,208
[YASUSUKE]
I think we can handle that.

87
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,000
[RAIKOU]
Kintoki!

88
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,041
[KINTOKI]
Right!

89
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:44,041
[KINTOKI] Honorable Sirs--
to the field of battle!

90
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,166
[YASUSUKE] Try to keep up
with me, Raikou.

91
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,666
[RAIKOU] I was gonna
tell you the same thing.

92
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,708
But, y'know--I'm proud
to fight by your side.

93
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,166
[YASUSUKE] It's damn
embarrassing how earnest

94
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,375
you are. But I like
that about you.

95
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,208
[RAIKOU]
Let's go!

96
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,416
[YASUSUKE grunts]

00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,208
Man, they're so strong!

100
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:11,250
Well done. Just keep it up, now!

101
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,166
[RAIKOU]
You don't disappoint, Yasusuke!

102
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,166
[YASUSUKE] Heh. Don't you
have a head to be severing?

103
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,541
[RAIKOU]
I'm on it!

104
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,666

00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,041
[RAIKOU]
Kaguya! Seimei! Now!

109
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,125
[DOUMAN growls]

110
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:49,458
But how...?

111
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,041
[RUDRA'S ARMS roaring]

112
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,750
Oh, crap, that wasn't enough!

113
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:53,958
There's no end to it!

114
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,166
I don't understand this,
it should've worked!

115
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,666
Douman's the conduit!

116
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,666
You're right, and it
will still work.

117
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,125
The complication, though.

118
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:05,000
We must cut away Douman's
darkness from Rudra.

119
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,708
Not just his physical form.

120
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,708
But how? For all we know,

121
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:11,333
Douman's completely
assimilated with Rudra.

122
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,583
How are we supposed
to isolate that?

123
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:16,291
It'll be nearly impossible
to find and cut out.

124
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,958
[YASUSUKE]
No point in thinking about it!

125
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,750
Just let the swords handle it.

126
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,541
We'll eventually cut out
Douman's darkness!

127
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:26,083
[RAIKOU]
I'm fine with that plan!

[INARI A]
No!

135
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:46,125
It appears that cracks
have formed in the barrier,

136
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,833
and time is seeping in!

137
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,833
The limit of their armor...

138
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,916
...is fast approaching!

soul beast will roar!

[YASUSUKE]
What the hell is happening?

142
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:02,458
[GORUBA] I'm afraid the armor
has reached its limit.

143
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:05,083
At this rate, it will
consume you.

144
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,291
Release before it's too late!

145
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:10,041

Raikou, no!

[GORUBA]
Stop!

150
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:40,541
You must release yourself
from the armor!

[YASUSUKE]
Yeah, like I have a choice here.

152

I can't... not when I still
have to save that idiot.

Are you all right?

00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:56,708
[RAIKOU]
You're wrong.

320
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,958
If you were nothing
more than darkness,

321
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,875
you would have fully merged
and disappeared within Rudra.

322
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,750
[DOUMAN]
You are a damn fool!

323
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:06,083
You know absolutely
nothing about me!

324
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:08,708
There's light and
darkness in everyone!

325
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:11,208
And I believe that
includes you as well.

326
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:14,666
You only see the light and
you dare say that to me?

327
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,000
No! I also have--

328
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,541
[DOUMAN] These words
are getting us nowhere!

329
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:19,750
[RAIKOU]
No, stop!

330
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:22,041
[DOUMAN yells]

331
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:36,583
Douman. I only wanted to...

332
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:45,708
[gasping]

333
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:49,666
You can rest now.

334
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:53,458
I'll shoulder the weight
of your darkness for you.

335
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:55,208
It's okay.

336
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,958
I feel so warm.

337
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:06,583
Is this what the light
actually feels like?

338
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:24,416
[SEIMEI]
Farewell now, Ashiya Douman.

339
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:05,083
[INARI A]
Hidden Power.

340
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:07,125
Hidden Feelings.

341
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:11,375
The path chosen
is a path of white.
