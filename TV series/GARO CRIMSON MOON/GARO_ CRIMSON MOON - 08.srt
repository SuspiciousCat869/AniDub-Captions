Unless... he's a Horror?

162
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,541
That could explain
our master's illness.

163
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,833
Yorimitsu has returned
as an evil spirit,

164
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:48,333
and has cast a revenge
spell on Shinbochi.

165
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:49,208
That must be it!

166
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:51,291
[YORINOBU]
Tsuna, I'm back!

167
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,541
And I have someone
who can help.

168
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:56,250
That man there has served
my family for years.

169
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,458
Watanabe no Tsuna.

170
00:08:58,541 --> 00:08:59,916
I see.

171
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:01,833
Finally, you come forward!

172
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,000
This is Raikou.

173
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,041
He has great experience
with evil spirits.

174
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,208
He'll solve our problem.

175
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,500
I assume he knows
much of Horrors.

176
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,000
Much indeed.

177
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,250
That face! It's him!

178
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:15,541
Yes, it has to be the
same Raikou we exiled.

179
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,916
[RAIKOU'S MOM] Don't banish
us from the capital!

180
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,041
The accusations are false!

181
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:26,333
Please tell him again that
I've not cursed anyone!

182
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:28,791
[RAIKOU groans]

What was that for?!

184
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,041
[TSUNA]
Stand up!

185
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,333
If you resist,
I'll beat you harder!

186
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,125
[DOUMAN]
Oh.

187
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:40,500
I followed the Darkness I
felt and I ended up here.

188
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,958
And what an interesting show.

189
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,125
I must make sure that
no one interferes

190
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,708
with how things are unfolding.

191
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,416
[INARI A]
I see, so...

192
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,041
Raiko went to the House
of Shinbochi alone.

193
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,625
Seimei.

194
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:58,041
Why did you not tag-along with
him to keep an eye on things?

195
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,833
When he visits Shinbochi
we risk him remembering,

196
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:03,250
things from his past
that neither he, nor us,

197
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,000
want him to remember.

198
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,333
If Raikou were to somehow
overcome the seal

199
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:10,666
you've placed on him, he'd
lose control of his power.

200
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,875
And I'm afraid that we, well,
we wouldn't be able to--

201
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:15,750
We cannot turn a blind eye!

202
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:16,875
No, we cannot!

203
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,333
[KINTOKI]
They got a point, Seimei!

204
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,583
What in the world
were you thinking?

205
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,541
[SEIMEI]
I guess I just wanted to see.

206
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:23,625
That's all, really.

207
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,041
[KINTOKI]
Oh, yeah? See what?

208
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,875
[SEIMEI] I wanted to
see how Raikou reacts

209
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,583
when confronted with
the scars of his past.

210
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:33,416
Does he have the strength
to overcome them on his own?

211
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,583
I want to believe he does.

212
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:38,375
Deep in my heart. I can feel it.

213
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:39,625
[KINTOKI]
Yeah, but--

214
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,333
[INARI A]
No matter what you "feel,"

215
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,666
this is a risk we cannot take.

216
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,208
Because, if you sit this out,

217
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:48,083
we also risk letting
a Horror run free.

218

Fine! I'll help him!

00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,875
Seems we got carried away
by an alchemist's spell.

226
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:11,833
And there's only one man
who can pull that off.

Well, if it isn't
our old friend.

I won't let you meddle.

230

So, for now,
this will be your prison.

To be fair, my teacher doesn't
want me to meddle, either,

but things have gotten too
interesting for me not to.

How are you still alive?!

We exiled both you and your
mother from the capital!

Going outside the walls
is a death sentence!

have made short work of you!

you have to do something!

[YORINOBU]
Father. I need to know.

00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,375
Please tell me about Yorimitsu!

252
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:48,541
The men of our bloodline
inherit the Golden Armor.

253
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,166
I thought that it would be mine.

254
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,791
You raised me my whole
life to believe that.

255
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,500
But however much I've asked
to see my birthright,

256
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,958
you've never once
shown it to me.

257
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:03,083
Is it... Is it possible ours
is the armor Raikou wears?

258
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:12,000
[TSUNA] Unfortunately,
our lord, Tada no Shinbochi,

259
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,250
did not have the strength
nor the talent

260
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:17,708
to don the Golden Armor himself,
regardless of his lineage.

261
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,958
So, he cultivated a new dream:

262
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,875
to raise a child with those
attributes he lacked.

263
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:25,958
A boy who could fulfill
a duty he could not.

264
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,333
Alas. This desire of his, too,

265
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:32,333
eventually unraveled
when Michinaga spoke up.

266
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,875
[SHINBOCHI] Nothing would
make me happier, my lord

267
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:39,458
than to take the Princess of
Nara's famous Fujiwara family,

268
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,291
to be my wife.

269

My sister does not object.

270
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,833
But one, small matter.

271
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,583
Yes, anything you ask.

272
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,375
The Golden Armor
is in your bloodline,

273
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:52,083
passed down through
the generations, correct?

274
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,083
[SHINBOCHI] Uh, My Lord,
how did you know?

275
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,458
[YASUMASA] Of course,
if you are to marry my sister,

276
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,958
the one to inherit it
will be her child.

277
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,250
[SHINBOCHI] Well, the armor
isn't really inherited.

278
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:04,083
It chooses its wearer
from amongst the family.

279
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,708
I already have a son,
named Yorimitsu.

280
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:09,041
So, I have no clue
if it will choose him,

281
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:12,208
or any of the future children
your sister bears for me.

282
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,500
The Golden Armor will
have no choice to make,

283
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,208
if there's but one son.

284
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,750
What?

285
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,708
[MICHINAGA] The son you have
with this beautiful princess.

286
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:22,208
Do I misunderstand
the armor's rules?

287
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:25,833
If he is your sole heir,
well, he will be chosen.

288
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,125
[SHINBOCHI]
Ah...

289
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,041
[TSUNA] On condition of
marrying the princess,

290
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:32,541
Shinbochi was to murder
his first son, Yorimitsu.

291
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,875
That's what Michinaga demanded.

292
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,583
Control over the Light Palace

293
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:39,125
will soon pass
to Lord Michinaga.

294

When that time comes,

295
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:43,416
he wants the Golden
Knight at his command.

296

[MICHINAGA] With the
Golden Knight on our side,

297

we would be able to defeat enemy

Perhaps even...

[SHINBOCHI]
No.

300

[SHINBOCHI whimpers]

304
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,208
[TSUNA]
Shinbochi had been cowed.

305
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,750
He obeyed Michinaga's wishes.

And when the time was right,

Shinbochi ordered his retainer
to train his new son,

Yorinobu, to be worthy of
inheriting the Golden Armor.

Do not deny the truth!

318
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,625
You've got it all wrong.

319
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:01,041
I'm not a Horror.
And I don't hate my father.

320
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,333
Or the servants who helped him.

321
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:04,625
[BOTH gasp]

322
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:05,958
As a young boy,

323
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:09,458
I would struggle every
day with who I was,

324
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,750
and with what I should be.

325
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,375
I couldn't be like my father

326
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:17,458
who selfishly obeyed
Michinaga to gain status.

327
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:18,416
So...

328
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,958
for a long time, I was lost.

329
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:24,083
But then, I found myself.

330
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,458
How dare you double down
on your lies, boy!

331
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:29,250
[KINTOKI]
Stop right there!

332
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,291
[TSUNA]
Wait, are you Kintoki?

333
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,750
In the flesh!
Long time, Tsuna.

334
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:38,541
You look like an old man
compared to when I last saw you!

335
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,458
[TSUNA] And you
haven't changed at all!

336
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,000
No matter how many years pass

337
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,875
you still look
like a little boy.

338
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,250
Like your friend here,

339
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,666
the only explanation is that
you're an evil spirit!

340
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,416
You think he's a Horror?

341
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,416
You can say whatever
you want about me,

342
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,416
but I will not let you drag
Raikou's name through the mud!

343
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,791
Tsuna!

344
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,875
You want the truth?!
The only evil spirit is yours!

345
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:01,875
Uh!

346
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,000
[SERVANT B]
What?

347
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,416
[SERVANT A]
Look at his eyes!

348
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,916
[TSUNA]
No! That's Impossible!

349
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,416
[TSUNA screams]

350
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,125
I was right?

351
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,500
He took a Horror's
arm as a trophy.

352
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,291
But its evil has taken
possession of him.

353
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,666
You lie!

354
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,958
[groaning, roaring]

355
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,916
And now, Tsuna, that Horror's
feeding on a darkness

356
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,208
that's always been in you.

357
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,541
You can't be Yorimeets,
he's dead!

358
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,083
You're the monster, not me!

359
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,541
I helped exile the boy
and his mother!

360
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,791
I am the one who murdered them!

361
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,375
It makes sense now.

362
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:48,083
Deep down, ever since he exiled
you as a boy, he's felt regret.

363
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:52,000
Over the years, that guilt
only made his soul darker.

364
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,958
[TSUNA groaning]

365
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,750
[RAIKOU]
So when I returned,

366
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,333
his only way of
handling the guilt was

367
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,916
to convince himself
I was a monster.

368
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,041
But you're the one full
of darkness, Tsuna.

369
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,625
[TSUNA roars]

370
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,541
[TSUNA roars]

371
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,583
[SHINBOCHI]
Watch out! [groans]

372
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,083
My lord, no!

373
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,791
[TSUNA growling]

374
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,166
[RAIKOU grunting]

375
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,416
Raikou. You are...

376
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,250
I owe my life to the Armor.

377
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,916
It let me survive
the Horrors of exile.

378
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,875
And then,

379
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,125
I was saved by that silly woman.

380
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,708
Although, I think
she only did it

381
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:50,166
because she wanted a Makai
Knight who would obey her.

382
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:54,583
Years later, I finally went back
to the house I was born in.

383
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,833
I didn't have much of a plan.

384
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,791
I think I just wanted
to surprise my father

385
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:02,125
and everyone else who
now assumed I was dead.

386
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:05,541
And, maybe give them
a piece of my mind.

387
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:08,125
[YORINOBU laughing]

388
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,250
[YORINOBU'S MOM]
Great job!

389
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,208
[RAIKOU]
But then, I realized...

390
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,375
Revenge wasn't my fate.

391
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:21,166
It was to protect others,
like that smiling child.

392
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,250
That's why the
Golden Armor chose me.

393
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:28,583
To become a Makai Knight and
serve all of the innocent.

394
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:29,875
Yorinobu.

395
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:33,791
Seeing you as a boy
gave my life meaning.

396
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:37,750
The infectious laughter
of my little brother.

397
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,166
[YORINOBU gasps]

398
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,708
Brother!

399
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:47,666
[RAIKOU]
Uh!

400
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,208
Seimei!

401
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:50,583
[SEIMEI]
Oh, you look the same.

402
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,166
I heard your hatred
for your father

403
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,458
had made you a Horror already!

404
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:57,041
[RAIKOU] Really? And what would
you have done if that were true?

405
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,083
[SEIMEI] I'd crush you
with this chariot.

406
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,166
Yeah, I figured as much.

407
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:02,916
[SEIMEI grunts]

408
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,125

[TSUNA roars]

412
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,500
The Golden Armor in action.

413
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,500
It's so beautiful.

414
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:28,958
[SEIMEI grunts]

415
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:41,250
[TSUNA growling]

00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,666
[TSUNA roars]

417
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,041
[SEIMEI]
All right, here we go.

418
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,875
Get ready, Raikou!

419
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:55,000
[LION CHARIOT roars]

420
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,250
[SEIMEI]
Hit him while he's down!

421
00:20:58,333 --> 00:20:59,541
[RAIKOU grunts]

422
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:04,208
[RAIKOU yells]

423
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:06,458
[TSUNA screams]

424
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:19,750
So, that is what this man
Raikou is capable of, eh?

425
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,541
[YORINOBU] Tradition demands
that as the eldest son,

426
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,833
you move back into
this household.

427
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:31,458
[RAIKOU]
Tradition or no tradition,

428
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,625
I'm Raiko now, a Makai Knight.

429
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,666
I'm no longer an aristocrat.

430
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,625
And I cannot go back
to that life.

431
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:40,666
Yorinobu, you are
the patriarch now.

432
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,666
This family is yours to protect.

433
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,583
And I'll protect everyone else,

434
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,416
as the Golden Knight.

435
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,333
Of course.

436
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:01,458
[KINTOKI]
So the whole time

437
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:04,250
you knew about Yorinobu,
Tsuna, everything?

438
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:05,000
[RAIKOU]
Yep.

439
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,250
[SEIMEI]
Well, great.

440
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:07,916
I spent all that time
worrying about nothing.

441
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,666
[RAIKOU]
Well let me ask you, Seimei,

442
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,083
would you return
to the Abe family?

443
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,791
No. I'd never go back there.

444
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,166
Exactly.

445
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,083
So true.

446
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:06,458
[INARI A] Light and shadow.
Black and white.

447
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:08,375
It is the contradiction
between the two

448
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:12,083
that makes them interesting.
