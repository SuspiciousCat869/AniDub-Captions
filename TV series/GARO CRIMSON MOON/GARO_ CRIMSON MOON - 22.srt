represent the 12
parts of a spell

which will cut Rudra's
12 ties to darkness,

This darkness comes
from deep within man.

For this reason, I must give you
this spell to use against it.

00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:57,583
Its words will prevent Rudra
from tapping into that power

and returning to this realm.

[INARI B]
At the end of the day,

00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:05,041
the Silver Knight is not one
to back down from a job.

[INARI C] All that's left
for him to do now

302
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,416
is tell Kaguya what he knows.

303
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,166
[INARI A] And with those
phrases on her tongue,

304
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,125
she will regain her
full powers at last.

Yasuske's done quite
well for someone

whose previous job was a thief.

Though I worry that this time

00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:22,250
we may be cutting it
a little too close.

[RAIKOU] Rudra no longer
possesses Seimei.

I can get some real revenge
for my brother's death.

If the fate of the world
wasn't at stake,
