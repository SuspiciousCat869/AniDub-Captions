1
00:00:13,916 --> 00:00:16,166
[ANCESTOR] Here, under
the fullness of the moon,

2
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,666
we gather to summon a
savior who will lead us out

3
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,500
of the encroaching darkness
and into the light.

4
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:22,625
[yells]

5
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:29,000
[baby cries]

6
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:33,125
Listen, child,
sadness is not abandon.

7
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:36,375
Anger is not hatred.

8
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:39,541
Disagreement is not hostility.

9
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:43,000
Affection is not fixation.

10
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:48,416
You shall be known
to the world as Kaguya,

11
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,083
the one who seals
the great beast, Rudra.

12
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:32,208
Wait a second here--you seal
Horrors in the Red Moon?

13
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,541
What does that mean exactly?

14
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:35,875
Well, it's--

15
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:39,166
[HARUAKI] Perhaps you should
allow me to explain.

16
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,500
Wait, Haruaki? Why're you here?

17
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:46,875
I'll fill you in,
back at my place.

18
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,666
Please, listen carefully, now.

19
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:54,416
Kaguya's a Madou Tool created
by an Abe ancestor, long ago.

20
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,000
They created... a tool?

21
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,416
That's correct.

22
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,916
And just as Kaguya already
mentioned to you earlier,

23
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,666
she was keeping a giant
Horror contained within

24
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,125
the Crimson Moon.

25
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:07,500
So then,

26
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:11,208
the broken seal that the
Watchdog Center described...

27
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,250
...it's Kaguya?

28
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:15,125
Oh. So you knew about the seal.

29
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,333
Though judging by
your expression,

30
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:20,083
I'm guessing the Watchdog Center
must have been unaware

31
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,625
that the seal was Kaguya.
Is that right?

32
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:23,666
Think so.

33
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,500
But, wait. If Kaguya
is a Madou Tool,

34
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:29,291
she can just seal up
Rudra again!

35
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,458
--Actually--
--[HARUAKI] Unfortunately,

36
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:34,208
it is not quite
as simple as that.

37
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,666
For starters, how much
did they tell you

38
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,125
about this specific Horror that
was sealed in the Red Moon?

39
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,958
[RAIKOU]
I know that it's powerful.

40
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:43,833
And that its name is Rudra.

41
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,875
And also, as we speak,

42
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,666
it's continually gathering
strength inside its vessel.

43
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,041
So. That's the
information you have.

44
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,541
Now, what mission did the
Watchdog Center assign

45
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:55,666
to the Golden Knight?

46
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,208
Stop Rudra's resurrection.

47
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:00,583
They ordered you
to eliminate Rudra,

48
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,666
and by any means
necessary, right?

49
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,125
That's right.

50
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:07,791
They want me to destroy it
before it resurrects fully.

51
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:10,291
Wait, does that mean that...?

52
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,083
It can't...

53
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,791
I can't.

54
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,916
You're just now realizing

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,458
the Watchdog Center has given
you quite a cruel order

56
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:18,916
to carry out this time.

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,208
No, hey, hold on!

58
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,541
I mean, sure,

59
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,916
Seimei seemed completely
different back there, but,

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,416
I refuse to believe she would
give in to the enemy so easily.

61
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,958
It didn't happen overnight.

62
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:33,250
She was already cursed
by Douma Houshi long ago.

63
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,625
Excuse me?

64
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,083
[HARUAKI]
The darkness within her,

65
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,250
it grew because of that curse.

66
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:43,250
And now, well, you've seen
the result for yourself.

67
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:46,416
[RAIKOU]
So Seimei... She really is...

68
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,000
...the vessel.

69
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,166
I'm sorry.

70
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,791
I tried to fix matters before
it could come to this.

71
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:56,291
But, alas, I lacked the strength
necessary to resolve it.

72
00:04:56,375 --> 00:05:00,583
And, at the moment, Kaguya is
unable to access her full power.

73
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,791
Unfortunately,
it's closely linked

74
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:06,416
to the current status
of Rudra's resurrection.

75
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,958
[RAIKOU gasps]

76
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,083
Because Kaguya was a Madou Tool

77
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,708
created specifically
to seal away Rudra,

78
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:15,541
she only activates
her seal in response

79
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:19,041
to the tremendous power
that Rudra releases.

80
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,708
Her power's useless?

81
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,875
At least until Rudra's
fully restored?

82
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,333
[HARUAKI]
Correct.

83
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:27,375
For the time being, the few
spells the girl possesses

84
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:30,583
include some healing
and barrier powers.

85
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:33,250
And although she does contain
the spell within her

86
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,583
for sealing Rudra, once
it is completely re-formed

87
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,833
that spell simply cannot be used

88
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:41,875
when Rudra is still incubating
within a vessel.

89
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,541
[RAIKOU]
Right, the vessel.

90
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,583
Is there any way to save Seimei?

91
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:46,833
There is.

92
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:50,000
But it will take me a
bit of time to prepare.

93
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,833
So, would you mind looking after
Kaguya for a little while,

94
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:53,833
Raikou?

95
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,750
No, not at all.

96
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,333
[KINTOKI]
That really happened?

97
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,583
[RAIKOU]
What I saw reflected in her eyes

98
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:05,833
wasn't me as her friend.
She just saw a sworn enemy.

99
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,625
Just the Golden Knight.

100
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,083
Are you sure?

101
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,750
I mean, I'm just having a
lot of trouble believing it!

102
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,916
That Seimei would ever...

103
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,375
[RAIKOU]
Yeah, I feel the same way.

104
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,750
[gasps] Is that...?

105
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,833
[RAIKOU] A summons from
the Watchdog Center.

106
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,083
Hold down the fort.

107
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,458
[KINTOKI]
Huh?! Uh...

108
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,125
No, wait, Raikou!

109
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:29,625
Just what exactly are
you wanting me to do?

110
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:33,375
[KINTOKI] A Madou Tool
in the shape of a human.

111
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:36,583
Uh, um... Sorry our
place is so shabby.

112
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:39,041
I hope you're
comfortable enough.

113
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,666
[KAGUYA]
Of course.

114
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,791
[INARI A] So what you're saying
is that, all this time,

115
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,458
the seal was hiding
in plain sight,

116
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,291
disguised as a human girl?

117
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,833
[INARI C] Well, no wonder
it couldn't be found.

118
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,125
Does this mean she's unable

119
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:54,833
to use her original
power right now?

120
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,125
It means that she's
of no real use to us

121
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:00,125
until Rudra regenerates.
We can't afford

122
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:04,000
to depend exclusively on such
an unreliable power as hers.

123
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:08,125
And since that is the case,
then Raikou...

124
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,125
Hey, are you even
listening to me?!

125
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:11,625
Uh! Uh, yeah.

126
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:14,000
Oh. It would appear
that you're still upset

127
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,541
about what happened
between you and Seimei.

128
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:17,833
[RAIKOU grunts]

129
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:23,458
Too bad! You must attack
Seimei and eliminate Rudra!

130
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,583
That was the order
that we gave you.

131
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:28,458
Seimei is the vessel
of Rudra now.

132
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:32,250
This is the only way Rudra's
resurrection may be prevented.

133
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:35,833
This should already be more
than clear to you, Raikou.

134
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,208
Don't run from it.

135
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,916
[INARI C]
Don't turn away.

136
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
[INARI A] Remain strong
and fulfill your duty

137
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,666
as the Golden Knight!

138
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,041
Well, Golden Knight.

139
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,708
I'll just have to
kill you next time.

140
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,000
You're being silly.

141
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,333
Look, I know Raikou,
and trust me,

142
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:55,875
there's no way that he sees
you as a burden, okay.

143
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,541
But... He's acting
so differently

144
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,375
around me now
than he was before.

145
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:03,333
I feel like I can't even
approach him anymore.

146
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,041
He's just a little
confused right now.

147
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:09,791
And honestly, so am I.
It's overwhelming, really.

148
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:12,500
All those things
happening at once.

149
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,041
The Horrors of the
Crimson Moon awakened.

150
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,416
Our allies kept on
getting attacked.

151
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,291
Out of the blue, you reappear,

152
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,208
and then, as if that
weren't enough--

153
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,666
[KAGUYA]
Huh?

154
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,458
[RAIKOU]
Stop that! Stay away from there!

155
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,000
[KAGUYA whimpers]

156
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm sorry, I... the person
who lives there,

157
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:40,625
well, she's gone right now.

158
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:43,500
You must mean Seimei. I see.

159
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,583

[KINTOKI] Whoa, really?
That's what Inari said to you?

161

What should I do here?

00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,291
Hey, how's the water?
Is the temperature okay?

164
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,583
Oh, yes. It's nice and warm.

165
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,416
Perfect! That's great to hear!

166
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,125
Say, you know something?

167
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,500
She's actually pretty swell
once you get to know her.

168

It's not like she's really
a cursed princess.

169
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:13,583
And she's not just some
dangerous Madou Tool here

to cast some
scary spells, either.

for that, right?

173
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:20,000
Yeah, what?

174
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:21,833
You really don't have
to act so chipper.

175

I can see right through it.

176
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:28,625
Kaguya, there's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

177
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,333
[KAGUYA]
Yes?

178
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:33,000
You once said you had been
waiting for someone

179
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,625
to come along and save you.

180
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,875
But then you made it
clear I wasn't the one.

181
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:42,666
So why'd you come
back to me again?

182
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,916
Well, I came because
sadness is not abandon.

[RAIKOU, KINTOKI]
Hm?

184

[KAGUYA] Last night, I felt
a sudden, overwhelming pain.

185
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,416
And as that pain shot
through my entire body...

186
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,541
I remembered those words.
They came to me in a flash.

187
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,208
And before I even realized it,

188
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,916
you were right there,
standing in front of me.

189

"Sadness is not abandon."
What's it mean?

Does it have something
to do with Rudra's seal?

191

That's what I'm hoping.

192

remembering things and soon.

The people are afraid.

198

They think it's a sign
the world is ending.

199

alike are fleeing.

Please, my Lord, calm their
fears and show them the way!

A few words from Michinaga would
surely strengthen their hearts!

I'll consider it later.

203

But, sir! Time is of
the essence here--

204

turns to darkness.

You came.

[DOUMAN]
Michinaga. I must say,

212
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:26,250
I was truly honored to
receive your invitation.

213
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:29,833
And I am very honored
that you accepted it.

214
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,500
So you refuse my hospitality.

What's the matter, not thirsty?

216
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,666
Just tell me what you want.

217
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,041
May I ask why you killed
the previous Ashiya Douman?

218
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:54,125
I was disappointed that
he wasn't the darkness

219
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:57,041
that I yearned for.
It's as simple as that.

220
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,916
So you toss aside those
for whom you have no use?

That's rich, coming from you.

222
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:05,416
Seeing as though you've done
the same thing, Michinaga.

223

[MICHINAGA] Hmph. True,
I once depended on Haruaki,

224

but he outlived his
usefulness to me.

Man cannot fight off old age.

And I came to realize there were
limits to Haruaki's power.

[DOUMAN] So what, you want me
to serve you in his place?

No, of course not. I wouldn't
ask you to serve me.

But I think that you should
join me. Why not work together?

different things.

it even matter?

without the other, right?

differently than you do.

Wait, no.

I want to see this entire world

swallowed up by darkness until
there's nothing else left in it.

And when that happens,

I'll watch as you
plunge into despair.

256

Because light is a thing that
people who have never known

true suffering will
cling to desperately.

But, you see it's
a fleeting thing

by great darkness.

Ah. Well then,

why did you even
accept my invitation?

I only came here
to get a glimpse

at the darkness
that lies within you.

that was a mistake on my part.

in your power to try

and keep your hands
clean and untainted.

He doesn't pay any attention
to Kaguya at all!

to get sick of it!

Life is so tough sometimes.
But there's no way around it.

279
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,500
Because Seimei is
Rudra's vessel now,

00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:23,541
that means that he's obligated
to attack her, yes?

281
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,583
Knowing Raikou, he
isn't usually the type

282
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,625
to obey an order
like that so easily.

Yeah, you have a point there.

True, he's stubborn
and he never listens.

287

But he's always pure of heart
and straight as an arrow

And I can tell, Kintoki,
that deep down,

00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,875
you are every bit as worried
about Seimei as Raikou is.

Even if you never show
it on your face,

out of concern for
your master, no doubt.

Damn it! What do I do?!

315
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:29,791
[RAIKOU yelps]

316
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:34,500
[KINTOKI grunting]

317
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,500
Raiko?

318
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:39,500
Uh. Hey, where are you?

319
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:43,333
Uhh!

320
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:50,000
[DARK SEIMEI] What a
disappointing adversary.

321
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,458
Are you certain that you're
the Golden Knight?

322
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,958
[RAIKOU groaning]

323
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,125
[DARK SEIMEI]
Oh?

324
00:17:57,291 --> 00:18:00,000
[RAIKOU]
I was... unsure.

325
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:04,000
Well, Golden Knight,
after I take care of you...

326
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,541
[RAIKOU]
I almost forgot my duty.

327
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:09,416
...then there will be nothing
left to stand in the way

328
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,416
of my coming resurrection.

329
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,750
[RAIKOU]
I should just...

330
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,041
And once my power
has been fully restored,

331
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,208
I will then bathe this
world in darkness.

332
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:18,791
No!

333
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:23,125
You are Rudra!

334
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,291
[RAIKOU]
Which is why...

335
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,333
...I will defeat you!

336
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:42,375
You're finally getting serious.

337
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,333
[RAIKOU grunts]

338
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,458
[DARK SEIMEI]
Not bad.

339
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:01,458
[RAIKOU yells]

340
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:02,500
[DARK SEIMEI grunts]

341
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:08,291
[RAIKOU yelling]

342
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,666
[KINTOKI panting]

343
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,416
Hey, Raikou!

344
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:22,000
Seimei. What's she doing?

345
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:26,625
[RAIKOU yells]

346
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:27,708
[DARK SEIMEI grunts]

347
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,500

349
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,416
[RAIKOU yells]

350
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,583
[gasps] Kaguya!

351
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,708
Golden Knight.

352
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:55,125
You mustn't kill her like
this, do you understand?

353
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,291
[RAIKOU gasps]

354
00:19:56,791 --> 00:20:00,958
Raikou, if you were
to defeat her now...

355
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:04,541
Just remember that
anger is not hatred.

356
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:07,250
Sadness is not abandon.

357
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:11,000
You brat! Stop it!
Shut the hell up!

358
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:14,583
Ah! Go away! Get out!

359
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,500
You don't exist anymore!

360
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:20,791
This body belongs
to me now! It's mine!

361
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,083
[RAIKOU gasps]

362
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:31,958
[DARK SEIMEI grunts, panting]
Dammit!

363
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:36,166
What the-- What the hell
is going on with me?

364
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,500
Every last trace of her
should have disappeared

365
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:43,333
completely by now.
Why is this happening?

366
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:45,958
[INARI A]
Well, Silver Knight,

367
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,291
have your wounds begun
to properly heal?

368
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:49,791
[YASUSUKE]
Yeah.

369
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,958
Wouldn't say I'm at my best
yet, but I'll be all right.

370
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:55,500
[INARI C]
Oh? That's good to hear.

371
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:59,458
Huh. You didn't call me here
just to see how I was feeling.

372
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:00,833
So get to the point.

373
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:03,125
I can see that you're
still as impatient a man

374
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,833
as ever, Silver Knight.

375
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:05,833
[YASUSUKE]
Hmph.

376
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:08,083
[INARI A]
Now you listen to me.

377
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,083
I am giving you an order.

378
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:13,125
You have to destroy Rudra's
current vessel, Seimei.

379
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,625
[gasps]

380
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:18,083
Rudra is a Horror possessing
tremendous power.

381
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,291
There's no telling
how many casualties

382
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,916
we could be facing
after it's resurrected.

383
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,750
You must attack before the
people you're sworn to protect

384
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:28,125
are slaughtered.
Zanga has to stop Rudra.

385
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,041
[YASUSUKE gasping]

386
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,083
[INARIS]
Eliminate Seimei!

387
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:08,541
[RAIKOU] I really can't
thank you enough, Kaguya.

388
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:12,000
If it weren't for you...
if you hadn't stopped me,

389
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:14,250
I'd have murdered Seimei.

390
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:16,625
I owe you a thank you as well.

391
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:19,291
I've remembered another line.

392
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:21,416
So we've got two parts.

393
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,333
Sadness is not abandon.

394
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:27,416
And anger is not hatred.

395
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,416
I really believe those words
have something to do with Rudra.

396
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,458
Or at least the seal
of the Crimson Moon.

397
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:39,083
I admit to feeling anger,
and sadness, but not hatred.

398
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:43,833
And I have not given up yet.
You understand, right?

399
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:47,208
The way she experienced
pain and responded to it.

400
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:51,458
It's proof that Seimei hasn't
totally disappeared.

401
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:58,916
[RAIKOU] She's still alive. And
I promise... I will save her.

402
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:04,500
[INARI A]
Crisscrossing light.

403
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:06,750
Now is the time to ask yourself:

404
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:10,666
for what reason do
you wield your blade?
