[YASUSUKE]
'Kay, guys, careful in here.

2
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:34,333
[BANDIT A]
Yeah, gotcha.

3
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:36,625
We may steal, but we don't kill.

4
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:39,083
Such is the code of
the Hakamadare thieves.

5
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:40,333
Let's go!

6
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:08,125
[gasps]

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,041
[chuckles]

8
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:12,083
You bastard!

9
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:13,958
[YASUSUKE yells]

10
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:17,500
[chuckles] A tasty treat!
What perfect timing!

11
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:19,500
Wouldn't you know it,
I just finished devouring

12
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:21,833
the last of the people
in this house.

13
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,916
What in the hell
happened to you?

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,166
Huh? You can't be serious.

15
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,833
Isn't it obvious?

16
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:30,416
The entire world
around us has gone mad.

17
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,541
And meanwhile,
the Light Palace refuses

18
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,083
to acknowledge my talents.

19
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:35,416
And that's the reason why

20
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,625
you just consumed all
the people who lived here?

21
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:40,500
Yes, and so what if it is?
That a problem?

22
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:42,083
Yeah, it is!

23
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,000
[yelling]

24
00:01:58,083 --> 00:01:59,625
[grunts]

25
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:13,416
What's goin' on boss?
You run into some trouble?

26
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,458
No. Good work, guys.

27
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:18,416
There's just one
thing left to do.

28
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,666
[KINTOU]
Listen up!

29
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,916
We must capture these
thieves at all costs.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,250
In the last few days alone,

31
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,166
they've broken into dozens
of aristocrats' homes

32
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,166
and stolen their valuables.

33
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,208
And worse, they've
won popular support

34
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:34,666
by giving much of what
they steal to the people!

35
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,625
They are the enemy
of the rich!

36
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:38,000
If you find these scoundrels,

37
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:40,625
you should not hesitate
to cut them down!

38
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:41,375
Now go!

39
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,208
[OFFICERS]
Yes, sir!

40
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:44,708
Yasusuke.

41
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:23,958
[INARI A] So, are you having
fun pretending to be a thief?

42
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:26,041
[INARI B, INARI C giggle]

43
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:29,875
Who said this was pretend?
I really am a thief now, okay?

44
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:30,750
Yasusuke.

45
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,083
I'm only targeting the houses

46
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,500
of the rotten and
corrupt aristocrats.

47
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,125
We may take the riches
that they hoard,

48
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,000
but we never take their lives.

49
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,875
Except for--

50
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,500
For what?
What're you saying here?

51
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:45,000
Sometimes, if I'm lucky,

52
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,541
the owner of the
house I'm robbing

53
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:49,583
might turn out to be a Horror
and then I get to kill them.

54
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:53,375
Last I checked, that is
my duty as a Makai Knight.

55
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:54,666
Am I mistaken?

56
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,791
I won't chastise you for it.

57
00:04:56,875 --> 00:05:00,750
But have the remnants of these
Horrors been red by any chance?

58
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,583
That's what you've been
waiting to ask me about?

59
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:04,916
[chuckles]

60
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,958
Yeah. They have been red.

61
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,041
You gonna tell me why?

62
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,666
[KINTOKI] Help yourself
to some fried sweets.

63
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:20,333
Yasusuke. What you said
to Inari, is that true?

64
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:21,791
Yeah, why would I lie?

65
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,166
And it wasn't just last night.

66
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,125
I've been seeing a lot
more of 'em lately.

67
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,958
Why're so many
becoming Horrors?

68
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:30,875
And what's with the red?

69
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,125
Does it have something
to do with...

70
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,208
...the moon suddenly
turning crimson?

71
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,791
You brute! What're
you doin' to Raikou?

72
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:42,166
You're worrying too much
about what's above you.

73
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,416
You should look down.

74
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,208
Who cares what's going on
with the moon, Raikou?

75
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,333
I'm a whole lot more
concerned about the creatures

76
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,166
scurrying around
down here, you get me?

77
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,041
A respectable position.

78
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,083
Yasumasa. Hey.

00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:02,000
'Scuse me, I need to have
a word with my brother.

[MICHINAGA]
Give me a status report.

81
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:07,833
Yes.

82
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,208
We're investigating
all the attacks

83
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,791
on the aristocrats' mansions.

84
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,458
They've occurred frequently
the past few nights.

85
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:13,791
[MICHINAGA]
Not that.

86
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:14,916
Sir?

87
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The preparations for
the moon viewing.

88
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,375
I trust everything is
proceeding smoothly.

89
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,583
Yes. Just as you have planned.

90
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,875
Although, there are
more than a few people

91
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,541
who fear this red moon
may be an ominous sign.

92
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,125
[laughs]

93
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:30,541
The very fact that it's unusual
is what makes it interesting.

94
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:33,458
It's the reason we're
having the feast.

95
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:34,875
My Lord.

96
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,500
You know, I actually came
here for the express purpose

97
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,958
of asking Raikou if he
knew how you were faring.

98
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,750
And yet, you're here in person.

99
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:45,458
[YASUSUKE] You care what
I'm up to? That's rare.

100
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:48,500
The bandits who've been
running rampant in the capital,

101
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,791
are you their ring leader?

102
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:53,375
Right, I think I heard
something about that.

103
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,208
[YASUMASA]
Answer the question, Yasusuke.

104
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:58,000
I don't know.
But so what if I was?

105
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,208
[YASUMASA]
I won't forgive anyone

106
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,666
who threatens the capital.

107
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,083
Even you.

[yelling]

Weren't you committed
to protecting people?

110
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,041
Here I thought that you
had washed your hands

111
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,500
of this thievery business!

112
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:15,083
Hey, don't jump to
conclusions, all right!

113
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:18,250
Then show me some proof
that I'm wrong! Prove it!

114
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,208
Come on! Just give
it a rest already!

Well, I could say
the same thing to you!

116
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,541
Fine, then answer this.

117

Even with that fancy
uniform you're wearing,

118
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:29,250
aren't there still plenty of
lives that you just can't save?

[growls]

120
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,208
What happened to you anyway?

121
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:35,833
You used to be so strong.

122
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,541
You taught me the
way of the sword.

123
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,916
Brother, why did you
sacrifice that strength,

124
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,250
your pride as a warrior, to work
under someone like Michinaga?

125
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,916
And become nothing more
than Kintou's puppet?

126
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,500
I may have to
ignore some things.

127
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,791
However, that
pales in comparison

128
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,375
to the vital importance
of maintaining the peace.

129
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,833
Nothing matters more than
keeping the people safe.

130
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:58,583
If you think killing me will
help the people, then fine.

131
00:07:58,666 --> 00:07:59,833
So be it.

132
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:00,625
[YASUMASA]
Hmm.

133
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,250
Well, unfortunately,

134
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:06,208
I don't have any proof that
you are, in fact, a thief.

135
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,041
Not yet, anyway.

[OFFICER B]
You all seem to be living

137
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,958
pretty comfortably
for commoners.

138
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,291
I know you didn't earn
this stuff on your own,

139
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,875
so don't play dumb.

140
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:26,166
Tell me everything you
know about these thieves!

141
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,583

[VILLAGER A screams]

[YASUMASA]
Hm?

I-I don't know
anything, I swear!

Please have mercy!

[gasps]

00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,833
I believe that's
quite enough, don't you?

149
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,458
Oh, Yasumasa.

150
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:51,583
I'm here under direct orders
from Kintou himself!

151
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,791
He told us to
find the thieves

152
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,708
by any means necessary!

153
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,291
[YASUMASA] Has an official
written decree been released?

154
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,125
Well. No, but--

155
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,041
Go on and confiscate
the stolen goods

that have been doled out.

157
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,750
But the interrogations
must end now.

158
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:11,750
[YASUMASA]
Kintou is acting too rashly.

159
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:15,666
He must be compensating for
his failure at the Rise Gate.

No. That can't be
the only reason.

00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,916
What's this about?

162
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,541
[BANDIT A]
So for our next targets,

163
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:26,333
first, we'll hit Fujiwarano
Yasuchika on Conoay Road.

164
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:29,500
And then there's Fujiwara
no Motofusa on the North Road.

165
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:32,125
Both of them have been using
their status in the Light Palace

166
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,416
to amass quite a fortune.

167
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,750
Hold off for now.

168
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,791
We're gonna have to lay
low for a little while.

169
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:37,791
What?

170
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,416
[YASUSUKE]
I'm going out.

171
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,875
[BANDIT A]
Uh, boss?

172
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:44,458
[IZUMI] Sorry, but I'm
a little busy right now.

173
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:47,958
I've been doing some research
on the Red Moon for Raikou.

174
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,666
What all have you
found so far?

175
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,750
I managed to track down
a record of the moon

176
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,458
turning crimson once
before, long ago.

177
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,666
After which, a great
disaster occurred.

178
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,625
Oh, really?

179
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:58,875
Bear in mind,

180
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,916
it happened back before
the capital was built.

181
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,541
So I haven't found
a lot of solid facts.

182
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:06,500
On the other hand, I did
find what you requested

183
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:09,000
regarding Kintou
and the Fujiwaras

184
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,000
Well, let's hear it.

185
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:16,583
It seems that Nagaske, Hirofumi,
Norinaga, and Kiyotada,

186
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:17,958
every one of them,

187
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:21,000
all of these Fujiwaras fell
out of Kintou's favor.

188
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,875
So much so that he
even barred them

189
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,708
from further social advancement.

190
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:25,666
[gasps]

191
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,458
What, is that important?

192
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:30,083
Thanks. That's all
I needed to know.

193
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:36,333
[YASUSUKE] So all the men I
targeted lately were aristocrats

194
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:40,125
who just happened to get
on Kintou's bad side.

195
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:43,250
And they all had become Horrors
by the time I got to them.

196
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:48,250
[YASUSUKE]
Kintou. What're you up to?

197
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,958
[KINTOU]
Fujiwara no Hirofumi!

198
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,125
Norinaga!

199
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,416
Kiyotada!

200
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,750
Fujiwara no Nagasuke!

201
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:03,583
Dare go against me?
You'll pay the price.

202
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:06,125
Divine punishment is quite
the glorious thing,

203
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,333
wouldn't you say?

204
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,541
Everyone who even thinks
about challenging me

205
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,416
continues to disappear.

206
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,750
I suppose I should
thank you for your help.

207
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,291
I can't afford to lose my
status at the Light Palace

208
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,833
with the way things are.

209
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:19,375
[DOUMAN]
Oh, is that all?

210
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:20,625
[KINTOU]
Hm?

211
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:23,416
[DOUMAN] Have you really
set your sights so low?

212
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,375
You should be aiming for more.

213
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,125
Why don't you
take down Michinaga

214
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,833
and seize control
of the Light Palace?

215
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:33,416
Seize control...
of the Palace myself?

216
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,666
[DOUMAN laughing]

217
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,625
[KINTOU]
I'll show no mercy today!

218
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:04,000
You must know something
about the thieves!

219
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,333
Start talking!

220
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:08,291
If you don't, I'll have no
choice but to kill you!

221
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,958
[YASUSUKE]
Damn! What a bastard!

222
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,500
[YASUMASA]
Hold your fire!

223
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:21,875
Brother.

224
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:36,500
[YASUMASA] Your investigation
has become pure sadism!

225
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:39,583
As a member of the police
magistrate, I'm embarrassed!

226
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:42,791
[KINTOU]
What did you say? Tell me.

227
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,708
Have you gone
completely mad?

228
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:47,625
I was going to ask you
the exact same thing.

229
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:48,875
I noticed something.

230
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:51,375
In the recent string
of robberies,

231
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,750
I've found an interesting
pattern to them.

232
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,750
I can't wait to hear this.

233
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,708
[YASUMASA] Most of the
aristocrats who've been robbed

234
00:12:57,791 --> 00:13:00,750
were left unscathed, but
there have been exceptions.

235
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,958
The heads of certain
households went missing

236
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,333
and remain unaccounted for.

237
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,458
And all those
missing aristocrats,

238
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:10,833
it seems that they all had less
than favorable opinions of you.

239
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:14,125
Hah. That may be, but it was
thieves who attacked them.

240
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,291
Need I remind you,
murdering an aristocrat

241
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,833
and hiding their body's
a serious crime.

242
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:21,125
So we're using every
method at our disposal

243
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:22,625
to hunt down these bandits.

244
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,583
Sorry, but I just don't buy it.

245
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:27,416
The thieves that you're
talking about live by a code.

246
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,541
They don't kill.

247
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,583
[KINTOU]
Tch. Incredible.

248
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:34,833
Are you defending
lawless hooligans?

249
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,000
While casting suspicion on me?

250
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:40,291
Really? Because that sure
is what it sounds like.

251
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,458
I'm starting to wonder if
you're actually in cahoots

252
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,583
with this band of thugs.

253
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:47,333
This man right here is a
threat to the Light Palace!

254
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:48,750
A criminal turncoat!

255
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,833
Don't you listen to
a word that he says!

256
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,791
Now, cut him down!

257
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,333
But, Sir, are you--?

258
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,000
What is this? You dare
question my orders?

259
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,916
It's treason to disobey me!

260
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:06,250
Attack.

261
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,166
[OFFICERS yell]

262
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,500
You leave me no choice.

263
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:14,875
You might want to
brace yourselves

264
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:17,083
for a couple of broken bones.

265
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,458
He's not holding
anything back.

266
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:25,708
[yells]

267
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,500
[OFFICER I]
Die!

268
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,125
What? Yasuske?

269
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,375
You shouldn't push
yourself so hard.

270
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,333
You're not a young man anymore.

271
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,750
Ah, so it's finally
becoming clear.

272
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:46,916
The great thief Hakamadare,
or should I say Yasuske,

273
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,541
conspiring with his brother

274
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:51,291
to throw the Light
Palace into chaos.

275
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:55,083
He set a trap and I let
myself walk right into it.

276
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:59,083
Look, Kintou. I promise,
I will not lose to you today!

277
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,958
Kill the both of them!

278
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,416
Yasumasa.

279
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,541
I'm gonna need you to follow
my lead here, you got it?

280
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,041
Let's go!

281
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:10,750
[YASUMASA]
Hey! Where are we going?

282
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,291
[KINTOU]
Stop them!

283
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:25,208
[YASUSUKE] Well, you got me
mixed up in a tricky situation.

284
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,625
[YASUMASA]
Did I really?

285
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,125
You're only in this mess
because you continue to steal.

286
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,708
[YASUSUKE]
Hey now,

287
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:33,583
is that any way to speak to the
man who just saved your life?

288
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,000
Funny, I didn't hear
a denial in there.

289
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:39,125
So you basically just admitted
that you are a thief.

290
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:40,250
Did I?

291
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,583
Yeah, you did, without a doubt.

292
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:46,000
Tell me, why would you go
and provoke Kintou like that?

293
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:49,750
I've been looking into the man
myself and he's crooked, but...

294
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:53,458
You know, the Light Palace
is already a rotten place.

295
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,375
You should just
let it decompose.

296
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:58,125
Well, there are
limits to everything.

297
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,083
So what do you
plan to do now?

298
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,750
I mean, you can't go back
to the Light Palace.

299
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:05,583
I know that Kintou
is behind all of this.

300
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:08,541
The reason he's so desperate
to hunt down the thieves

301
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,458
is he intends to pin
the blame on them

302
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:13,208
for the robberies and
the missing aristocrats.

303
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:14,666
[YASUSUKE]
Probably.

304
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,333
I'll expose Kintou's sins.

305
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:20,541
And I have a good idea
where I can find some proof.

306
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,500
Gee, let me take a wild guess.

307
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:26,291
It's hidden somewhere at
police headquarters, right?

308
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,833
Then we have no choice.

309
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,583
After all, we have
come this far.

310
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:31,583
[YASUMASA]
Huh?

311
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,208
You're not seriously thinking

312
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,541
of sneaking into
police headquarters.

313
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,625
Why not? Who better
than me to do it?

314
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:40,875
I am a thie-- I mean, I'm a
former police magistrate.

315
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,833
So I already know
the layout of the place.

316
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,125
Well, I'm going with you.

317
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,583
You'll just slow me down.

318
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,333
You've been gone for a long time

319
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,583
and it's changed a lot
since you were last there.

320
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:52,708
You'll need me to show
you around, trust me.

321
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,083
[sighs]

322
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,500
In that case,

323
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:58,333
looks like us brothers
will be thieves together.

324
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:14,208
Security seems
lighter than usual.

325
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,416
[YASUMASA] I'm sure most of
the officers are out on patrol

326
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,625
looking for us.

327
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,875
Thank goodness for small favors.

328
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:26,708
[YASUMASA]
Nothing here. Any luck?

329
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:29,583
[YASUSUKE]
No. Haven't found anything.

330
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,083
[YASUSUKE grunts]

331
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:32,375
[YASUMASA]
What is it?

332
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,458
[YASUSUKE]
I wonder...

333
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,916
[YASUMASA]
Is-Is that?

334
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,791
I think we found it.
The proof we need.

335
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,583
[ARISTOCRAT A] True to your
reputation, Michinaga.

336
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,958
You truly understand
the art of elegance.

337
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,458
What could be more exquisite

338
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:58,291
than drinking under such
an unusual red moon?

339
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,291
[ARISTOCRAT B] Ooh, have
you heard the latest gossip

340
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,916
about Fujiwara no Yasumasa?

341
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,708
[ARISTOCRAT C]
Oh, it's absolutely terrifying!

342
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:09,708
For someone of such high status
to be consorting with outlaws!

343
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,833
[YASUMASA]
Let me through!

344
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:13,041
[OFFICER K]
Hold it there! Stand down!

345
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,833
--[YASUMASA] Lord Michinaga!
--[OFFICER K] Don't move!

346
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:15,916
It's Yasumasa!

347
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,791
You must be out
of your damn mind

348
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,333
to show your face
here like this!

349
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,083
I've come here
to offer information

350
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,791
vital to the security
of this capital! Hear me!

351
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:24,750
Kill him!

352
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:25,333
[MICHINAGA]
Wait!

353
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,666
[KINTOU]
Tch.

354
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,208
If you have something to
say here, then say it.

355
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,833
[YASUMASA] This is a letter
that was sent to you, my Lord.

356
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:38,208
In it, there's a strong
condemnation

357
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:42,541
of a particular individual
within the Light Palace.

358
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:46,791
But this letter was intercepted
before it could reach you.

359
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:50,041
And its writer was
murdered in cold blood...

360
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,041
...by none other than Kintou!

361
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,875
[gasps]

362
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:57,541
I found it stashed away
in a secret hiding place.

363
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:00,750
Along with it, were
many other documents

364
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,833
originally intended
for your eyes.

365
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:08,458
As well as... mementos of
the slain aristocrats.

366
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:12,125
ll displayed like trophies
from successful hunts.

367
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,125
Please, Michinaga.

368
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:18,000
Come see. See all the
evidence for yourself.

369
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,125
Oh, I think I will.

370
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:26,166
[laughing]

371
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:33,541
[KINTOU]
So this is the end for me.

372
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:36,666
Well, I'm not going alone.

373
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,416
Michinaga! I'm taking
you to Hell with me!

374
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,666
[DOUMAN]
Hmm...

375
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:50,000
[yelling]

376
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:54,166
Lord Michinaga,
please stand back!

377
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,583
Michinaga.

378
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:59,458
Ashiya Douman.
Those scars on your face.

379
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:03,166
Oh, don't tell me that
you don't remember.

380
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,625
Remember what?

381
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,791
[chuckles] Never mind that.

382
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:10,125
I believe that my work
here is done for the night.

383
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,458
Get out of here! Run!

384
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,458
[YASUSUKE] Hey,
I'm the one you really want!

385
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,083
Yasuske!

386
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,833
[YASUSUKE]
I'll take it from here.

387
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,833
[YASUMASA]
Sorry I've caused you trouble.

388
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:27,875
No more than I've caused you.

389
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,458
This is as far as
our alliance goes.

390
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,125
[YASUSUKE]
Looks like I'm the lucky one

391
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,625
who gets to finish you off...

392
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,375
...once and for all!

393
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:12,750
[YASUSUKE] You're just as
annoying as you ever were.

394
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,791
[MICHINAGA]
Minamoto no Yorinobu.

395
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:41,708
I want you to be the new leader
of the police magistrate.

396
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,333
Serve the capital honorably.

397
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:46,708
Yes. I won't let you down.

398
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:49,125
Well, look who we have here.

399
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,166
The magistrate? No kidding.

400
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,916
Jeez, they're here already?

401
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,083
Because now they have
a new man in charge.

402
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,041
Come on. Let's go.

403
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,541
Look. Up there! After them!

404
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,666
[gasps] Is that?

405
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,958
Did you see that man?

406
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:09,416
He looked an awful
lot like your brother.

407
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,583
What, Yasuske?
You're seeing things.

408
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:16,208
That's Hakamadare, the ring
leader of the bandits.

409
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm absolutely certain.

410
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,583
C'mon, hurry!

411
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:21,833
We hafta distribute this stuff
to the villagers before morning.

412
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:22,625
Let's go!

413
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:23,708
[BANDIT A]
You got it!

414
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:28,791
[YASUMASA] Don't
underestimate me, Yasusuke.

415
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:31,625
I'll pursue you
until the bitter end.

416
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,958
[INARI A] The stars fade away.
The moon grows redder.

417
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:11,041
And the darkness,
it gets deeper and deeper.
