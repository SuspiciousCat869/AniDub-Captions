Time certainly flies when
you're destroying universes.

323
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:23,028
Just 50 tacks left.
Halfway done.

324
00:19:23,111 --> 00:19:24,487
Jiren.

325
00:19:24,571 --> 00:19:25,947
Understood.

326
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:27,741
You can take it from here.

327
00:19:27,824 --> 00:19:30,994
The fighters who hoped
to challenge me...

328
00:19:35,081 --> 00:19:37,167
...have already failed.

329
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:52,474
[BOTH]
Whoa! What's he doing?

330
00:19:52,557 --> 00:19:56,811
A remarkably bold fighter.
He's begun meditating, sires.

331
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:59,272
Even though half the
allotted time remains,

332
00:19:59,356 --> 00:20:02,233
Jiren is evidently certain
of his team's victory.

333
00:20:02,317 --> 00:20:03,943
Now, I'm not complainin'
or anything,

334
00:20:04,027 --> 00:20:06,613
but it's kind of anticlimactic
to have all this time

335
00:20:06,696 --> 00:20:08,531
and no one who can
pose a real threat.

336
00:20:08,615 --> 00:20:09,949
That's some nerve.

337
00:20:10,033 --> 00:20:13,411
Acting like there's no one
left who's worth his time.

338
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,542
That's what you think, huh?

339
00:20:19,626 --> 00:20:22,962
You think you can just float
there and ignore me?

340
00:20:23,046 --> 00:20:24,547
[CATOPESRA]
If we're going to defeat him,

341
00:20:24,631 --> 00:20:25,882
this is our best chance.

342
00:20:25,965 --> 00:20:27,384
[BIARRA]
Yeah.

343
00:20:27,467 --> 00:20:30,261
It's like he's just begging us
to knock him off the edge.

344
00:20:31,429 --> 00:20:33,807
[DYSPO]
Oh. Look at this.

345
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:38,436
While I commend your courage
for wanting to face Jiren...

346
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,438
[BOTH]
...you're finished!

347
00:20:41,314 --> 00:20:43,274
[BIARRA]
Go! Now is our chance!

348
00:20:43,358 --> 00:20:45,026
[DYSPO]
What the--?!

349
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,445
[CATOPESRA]
Ha!!

350
00:20:48,238 --> 00:20:49,322
[CATOPESRA yelps]

351
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:53,159
[BIARRA]
What just happened?

352
00:20:53,243 --> 00:20:56,162
Why is it so hard for
your small minds to grasp?

353
00:20:56,246 --> 00:20:57,706
You cut-rate amateurs

354
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:00,291
aren't qualified to
fight against Jiren!

355
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:03,503
If you're not strong enough
to pierce the energy barrier

356
00:21:03,586 --> 00:21:07,924
he has raised, there's no point
in fighting him at all.

357
00:21:13,388 --> 00:21:14,764
Jiren...

358
00:21:18,435 --> 00:21:20,770
[NARRATOR]
By defeating the assassin Hit,

359
00:21:20,854 --> 00:21:24,774
Jiren has once again shown
the vastness of his power.

360
00:21:24,858 --> 00:21:26,651
Will Goku be able to reach

361
00:21:26,735 --> 00:21:29,821
his Autonomous Ultra
Instinct level again?

362
00:21:29,904 --> 00:21:31,364
And even if he can,

363
00:21:31,448 --> 00:21:35,035
will it be enough to topple
this incredible opponent?

364
00:21:35,118 --> 00:21:37,704
The Tournament of Power
is halfway finished,

365
00:21:37,787 --> 00:21:41,207
and the great battle to decide
the fates of the universes

366
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:44,419
is about to enter
a whole new phase.

367
00:21:44,502 --> 00:21:47,547
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super!

368
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,884
<i>A 70 centimeter squared window</i>

369
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,855
<i>Today the sun broke</i>
<i>through the clouds</i>

370
00:22:03,938 --> 00:22:07,650
<i>The rain is fin'ly gone</i>

371
00:22:07,734 --> 00:22:10,362
<i>Gonna open up</i>
<i>the window for once</i>

372
00:22:10,445 --> 00:22:14,240
<i>No reason, just because</i>

373
00:22:14,324 --> 00:22:16,826
<i>This room has been</i>
<i>stained with the sighs</i>

374
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:19,329
<i>Of everyday regret</i>

375
00:22:19,412 --> 00:22:22,540
<i>Now it's time to clear the air</i>

376
00:22:22,624 --> 00:22:27,420
<i>Every moment was consumed</i>
<i>with my thoughts of you</i>

377
00:22:29,089 --> 00:22:34,219
<i>Knowing in my heart those dreams</i>
<i>won't be coming true</i>

378
00:22:35,136 --> 00:22:41,851
<i>I've always wanted nothing more</i>
<i>than to see your face</i>

379
00:22:41,935 --> 00:22:47,065
<i>I move on knowing that your</i>
<i>mem'ry can't be erased</i>

380
00:22:51,152 --> 00:22:52,487
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

381
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:55,156
The body-expanding Monna
from the Fourth wants a fight,

382
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,201
while Namekians are taking
on Piccolo and Gohan.

383
00:22:58,284 --> 00:23:00,453
With my energy low
I've got to be careful,

384
00:23:00,537 --> 00:23:02,914
so Vegeta and Cabba will
try to knock out Monna--

385
00:23:02,997 --> 00:23:05,250
<i>if</i> they don't knock
each other out first!

386
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:06,876
When Monna turns into a giant,

387
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,754
can Cabba harness his
Saiyan pride and win?

388
00:23:09,838 --> 00:23:11,548
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

389
00:23:11,631 --> 00:23:14,009
"A Saiyan Oath!
Vegeta's Resolve!"

390
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:16,136
Make sure you don't
miss it, okay?
