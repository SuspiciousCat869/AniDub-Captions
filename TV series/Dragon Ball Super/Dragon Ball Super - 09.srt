but although the Super

With his friends' energy
flowing through him,

this Saiyan shall then take the
form of a Super Saiyan God.

confused halfway through it.

Basically, if I understand
what Shenron was saying,

is five Saiyans have to hold

and channel them
into another Saiyan,

who will supposedly
turn into some sort of deity.

And that's one of those
