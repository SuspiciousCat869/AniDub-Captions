[FUTURE TRUNKS grunts]

[ZAMASU] Doesn't matter
how whipped up

177
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:20,416
you Saiyans get. The only thing
you will accomplish

178
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,250
is further justifying our plan.

Trunks!

180
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,208
[FUTURE TRUNKS] Considering
how much strength I've got left,

181
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:34,375
the best I can do is put it all
into one more attack.

182
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,500
Everything depends on this.

183
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:39,875
This is hardly entertaining
if all you do is run away.

184
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:43,458
Where's that great enthusiasm
you were showing before?

[ZAMASU]
Heh.

186
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,250
[FUTURE TRUNKS]
Here goes!

187
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,125
[ZAMASU groans]
There, that's better,

188
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:51,541
but now what?

189
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,666
[FUTURE TRUNKS] Your body can
regenerate when damaged,

190
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,875
but let's see what happens
if there's no body left!

[GOKU BLACK]
Not a bad attack, I must say.

196
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:24,375
You know, he might have
even bruised me.

197

[BOTH]
Hm.

198
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,375
Goku and the others
are back, as expected.

00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:32,458
So the curtain rises
and our act three begins.

00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:36,333
I can sense your
energy, too, Father.

201
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,666
You really did come back.

202
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,250
[BULMA]
How's Trunks?

203
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,333
He's still breathing,
I can at least say that.

204
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,791
Well, that's hardly reassuring.
What do you mean?

205
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,083
His energy's on the verge
of disappearing.

206
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:53,583
Can you translate that, please?

207
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,500
Are you saying
he's about to die?

208
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:56,958
Yes, to be blunt.

209
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,500
Then what are you
standing around for?

210
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:01,000
Go find those bastards
and kick their butts!

211

No need, they've come to us.

212
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,333
Huh?

--[VEGETA] Great.
--[GOKU] Hey!

[GOKU BLACK] There will be
no more retreating.

216
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,208
Now you're trapped here.

217
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:21,125
So this world will be
the last you ever see.

218
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,916
[VEGETA] For a god,
you're surprisingly confused.

219
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,500
This isn't going to be
<i>our</i> final resting place.

220
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,583
It's going to be yours.

221
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,625
We were even going to
bring you a casket,

222
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:33,125
but we couldn't
find one small enough.

224
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,000
Are you okay?

225
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,791
Well, I am now.
[gasps]

226
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:43,541
Goku and my parents
just arrived again.

227
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,125
They wouldn't have
come back like this

228
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,791
unless they've found
a way to defeat them,

229
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,291
I'm sure of it.

230
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,083
[ZAMASU] Our master
Gowasu and the other Kais

231
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,625
were foolish enough to believe

232
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,375
mortals could be
entrusted with intellect.

233
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:58,833
As a result, you malefactors
have developed time travel...

00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,041
Hey, Kakarot,
where are you keeping that jar?

235

Oh crap, it was still
in the time machine

when they blew it up!

237
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,750
How can you be that stupid?

238
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,833
Hey, don't blame me--
you forgot it, too!

239
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,958
'Cause I thought you
still had it with you!

have a place to put it. See?

listening to you,

244
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,375
[ZAMASU] No matter.
I'm so intoxicated by myself,

245

I don't care
if I have an audience.

246
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,750
[GOKU BLACK] One of the many
benefits of being a god.

Ha! I was just thinking
the exact same thing.

Hm!

[ZAMASU]
What? Gowasu?

256
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,541
And here I thought
I had murdered you.

257
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:59,708
Hey, look, our Supreme Kai's
here, too! But how?

258
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,541
Oh, yes, of course.

259
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,500
So you're the Gowasu
from their timeline,

260
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,958
saved by the
Destroyer's intervention.

261
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:11,291
[GOWASU] Indeed. And Lord
Beerus told me everything.

262
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:14,583
How could you strike me down
after all I taught you, Zamasu?

263
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:15,875
[ZAMASU]
Hmm?

264
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,750
Wait, Gowasu! You're talking
to the wrong one.

265
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:21,666
The Zamasu you knew
is inside that one!

266

Oh, right, my mistake.

[coughs]

268
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:29,791
How could you, Zamasu?
Your behavior is pathetic.

269
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,666
How could a Kai
commit such atrocities?

270
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,958
[GOKU BLACK] That's hardly
the word <i>I</i> would use.

271

What's so atrocious
about cleansing creation

272
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:40,875
from its mortal blight and
restoring its original beauty?

273
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,041
Your views are unspeakable!

274
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:46,500
Is that how you justify
killing other deities as well?

275
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:47,750
[GOKU BLACK]
You can't comprehend

276
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:50,166
the paradise
I'm trying to create.

277
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,166
You would've tried
to stop me, correct?

278
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,625
Yes, of course!

279
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:54,791
[GOKU]
Wait a minute.

280
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,375
You said all the gods
here are dead,

281
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,250
which must mean
the Kais and the Destroyers,

282
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,333
but what about Whis
and his kind?

283
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:02,125
He's even tougher than Beerus.

284
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,166
There's no way you could
have taken him out.

285
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,583
There'd be no need.

286
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,958
When a god falls, the angel
attendant serving him

287
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,791
automatically goes
out of commission

288
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,208
until the next god appears
for him to serve.

289
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,625
Hold on, an angel?

290
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:16,666
You're telling me
Whis is a real-life angel?

291
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,958
But I thought angels were little
winged babies on clouds

292
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,041
with their butts
hanging out with harps.

293

[GOKU BLACK chuckles]
How strange, master.

294
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,666
Who would've guessed I'd
have to kill you three times?

Go. You shouldn't
be at this fight.

00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,541
All you'll do now
is get in our way.

300
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:49,166
The truth is
Gowasu insisted we come.

301
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,875
It's not too late
to right these wrongs.

302
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,000
We will use the
Dragon Balls of this world

303
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:58,166
to resurrect all those who fell
victim to your rampage of hate.

304
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,708
I'm sorry, old Kai, but we
destroyed all the Dragon Balls.

305
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:04,416
So, no one will ever
gather them again.

306
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,458
What? How could you?

307
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,458
Gowasu!

308
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,208
[BULMA]
Oh no! So if Trunks dies,

309
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:13,375
there's no way to
bring him back to life!

310
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:14,916
Are you done, Supreme Kais?

311
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
We'd like to
get to the fight now.

312
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,333
You should get out
while you still can.

313
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,666
--They're right.
--No, I'm not leaving.

314

This fool was my apprentice
and my responsibility,

315
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,458
so I'll see this through
to the end.
