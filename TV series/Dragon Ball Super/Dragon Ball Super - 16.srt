on Dragon Ball Super,

00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:58,208
Lord Beerus the Destroyer
defeated Goku in battle,

5
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:01,250
and it seemed the loss
had sealed Earth's fate.

exhausted Beerus,

[hollers gleefully]

163
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,625
All right, here it goes!

164
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:41,041
[WHIS shrieks]

165
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,916
[hollers gleefully]

166
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,041
Ah, it's delicious!

167
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,750
My, this is
absolutely exquisite!

168
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:53,916
Crispy and crunchy,
yet spongy at the same time!

169
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,708
It's like
a ballet in my mouth!

170
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:59,625
Oh. What is this
liquid called again?

171
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,208
That's tempura sauce.

172
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,083
[WHIS]
Right! Tempura sauce!

173
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:05,000
Such a fragrant
bouquet! I love it!

174
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,041
The sauce alone
is a work of art!

175
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,375
You have done
magnificently, chef.

176
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:10,750
[CHEF 16A]
Uh, thanks.

177
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,625
Let's try the shrimp
and vegetable next.

178
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,958
[CHEF 16A]
Sure, coming right up!

179
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,583
[WHIS]
Mmm. That lively sound.

180
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:22,041
[sniffs]
That rich aroma.

181
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,541
Oh thank you, Bulma,
it's even better than the last.

182
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:27,708
I can always count on you for a
fabulous culinary adventure!

183
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,291
Of course, Whis,
don't mention it!

184
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:32,125
I mean that's what indispensable
friends are for, right?

185
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,958
Yes indeed!

186
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:39,625
Oh-ho-ho!
An inspired combination!

187
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,666
On their own I find
decapod crustaceans

188
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,291
too small for my taste.

189
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,541
But the added heft
here is great!

190
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:46,791
[giggles]

191
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,666
Like I was saying,
I'm so glad we're friends!

192
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,625
We're lucky Beerus
didn't destroy the earth

193
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,500
so I could show you
all this food!

194
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,750
And naturally if he comes back,
you'll use your sway

195
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,666
to keep my family safe,
at least.

196
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,875
I mean isn't that right, Whis?

197
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,583
Aaah-mmm!

198
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,708
Well, that's
difficult to say...

199
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,500
[BULMA]
Hm?!

200
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:08,833
[hollers gleefully]

201
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:12,291
This is brilliant!

202
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:13,666
I know.

203
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:43,083
[BULMA] You're back sooner
than I expected, for once.

204
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,541
I wish you would've told me.

205
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,916
You do realize some couples
communicate, right?

206
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,875
And in case you haven't noticed,
you're totally filthy.

207
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,666
Every time you come back
from a training binge,

208
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,291
you track mud
all through the house.

209
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,875
It's like, "Oh, I forgot
my living room was

210
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:58,000
a mud-wrestling pit!"

211
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,625
Are you listening to me
or am I talking to myself?

212
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,291
Honestly, Vegeta,
it'd be nice if you could

213
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:05,208
at least make eye contact
after being gone so long.

214
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,083
Did you forget
how to speak or what?

215
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,500
[VEGETA gasps]

216
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:10,916
Whis, it's you!

217
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,250
Salutations, Vegeta,
it's been too long.

218
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,416
[VEGETA] What's going on?
Why're you here?

219
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,166
Who, little old me?
Oh-ho-ho!

220
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,041
I simply dropped by
to share a meal with Bulma.

221
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:22,458
With Bulma?

222
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,333
Didn't I tell you?
Whis and I have become

223
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:27,000
really good friends.
He visits every now and then

224
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,708
and I take him to lunch.

225
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,625
Just having lunch
with my wife are you?

226
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,291
Bulma has been
introducing me to some of

227
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,791
the most sensational
cuisines I've ever tasted.

228
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,791
Earth seems to have
an endless cornucopia

229
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,625
of flavors and
cooking techniques.

230
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:41,041
Honestly, I'm not sure I'd ever
get tired of coming here.

231
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,833
If it wasn't for our
wonderful friendship,

232
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,833
you wouldn't have tasted
any of those things!

233
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,125
Don't you forget!

234
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:47,708
I doubt you'll ever let me!

235
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,333
And of course I'm grateful.

236
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,875
If you've been coming here,
then why the hell didn't I know?

237
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:54,125
Why are you getting
so mad, Vegeta?

238
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,708
Oh! Now I get it!

239
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,916
You're feeling jealous,
aren't you?

240
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,333
A charming and dignified
alien going to lunch

241
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,166
all alone with
your beautiful bride.

242
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,416
I can understand why
that might make you worry.

243
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,291
No, I don't
give a damn about that!

244
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:09,041
What?! You could
at least pretend!

245
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,208
Yeah, sure, fine, babe.
Is Beerus here?

246
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,333
Lord Beerus is currently
on his home world

247
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:14,583
enjoying a bit of rest.

248
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,916
Is that so? Then I demand
you take me there

249
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,125
to see him immediately!

250
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,083
I'm going to show
that arrogant feline

251
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,666
the true power
and might of a Saiyan!

252
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,583
[BULMA]
Vegeta...

253
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,583
[chuckles]

254
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,083
Spit it out!

255
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,875
Have you completely
lost your mind?

256
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:36,166
You know how close Beerus
came to destroying Earth.

257
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,625
What if you get him mad and
he decides to finish the job!

258
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,916
Shut up! You don't
understand, Bulma;

259
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,375
I have to fight him!

260
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,750
It's the only way I can
find out how far I can go!

261
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,583
I'm sorry to burst your
self-delusional bubble,

262
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,208
but you don't stand a chance!

263
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,250
Beerus nearly killed Goku
and that's after Shenron

264
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:51,916
helped him
find that new power.

265
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,083
Tch. And that's what
gets me the most--

266
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,333
it should have been me!

267
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,541
Take it out on a boulder
and stay out of my way!

268
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,291
The whole reason I'm
making nice with that guy

269
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,375
is so if his master comes
back to blow up the earth,

270
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,083
I can at least keep
our family safe.

271
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:06,000
And I'm not gonna let you
screw that up! You hear me?

[BULMA] Lover's quarrel;
shall we go?

274
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,125
Indeed. I can't wait
to taste the dessert

275
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,708
you've arranged for me, Bulma.

276
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,958
I admit I have
quite the sweet tooth.

277

[VEGETA] Hold on! I'm not
done talking with you!

[VEGETA] If that's
how you want to do it,

279
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,166
I'll stop you by force!

280
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:24,333
What's happening?

281
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:27,666
Some sort of energy.
It's-It's holding me back.

282
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,000
It won't let me attack!

283
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,083
[gasps]

284
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,250
Who the hell
are you actually, Whis?

285
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:36,416
You're more than just Beerus'
servant, aren't you?

286
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,291
[WHIS]
Oh. Did I neglect to mention?

287
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:43,666
Sorry-Yes, I am
Lord Beerus' teacher as well.

288
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,916
His... teacher?

289
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,750
Wait. Come again? You mean
like his fighting teacher?

290
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:50,958
Yes, that's right.

291
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,333
So you're even stronger
than the Destroyer?

292
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:56,791
[chuckles]
Oh, I don't know about that.

293
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,875
Well all I know
is I'm hungry!

294
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,958
Ready to go have
that dessert I promised?

295
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,166
Yes, of course!

296
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,291
Is this the one they
only make ten of a day?

297
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,458
Actually, it's only five!

298
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:10,541
Honestly?
You're Beerus' teacher?

299
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:14,416
May I be so bold? I'd like
to offer you a bit of advice.

300
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,375
You've achieved
considerable power,

301
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:19,291
through what I assume is
intense physical training,

302
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:21,541
but if you continue
focusing on power alone,

303
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,791
you'll never defeat Lord Beerus.

304
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,750
The most crucial skill
you lack is a method

305
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,791
for controlling your energy.

306
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,750
If you can learn that...

307
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,291
...I suspect you'd be able
to surpass your fellow warrior

308
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,083
who always seems
one step ahead.

309
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,541
You mean Kakarot?

310
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:38,166
Unfortunately, it won't be
easy to learn that control.

311
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,958
Bye!

312
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:43,958
What is with you today?

313
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,958
This skill you say
I need so badly--

314
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:49,125
controlling my energy--
can you teach me that?

315
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:56,000
[intense music plays]

316
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,708
Make me your student, please!

317
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:00,041
And I won't let you down!

318
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,166
Would you give your crazy
obsession a rest for one minute!

319
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,666
I told you, Whis and I
already have plans!

320
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,000
[WHIS]
I'll train you...

321
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,333
[gasps]

322
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,416
...if you agree to become
a Destroyer one day--

323
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,791
I guess I should have
led with that.

324
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,750
All right, Bulma,
shall we go now?

325
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:18,166
[BULMA] Absolutely.
Sorry he's being annoying.

326
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,458
[WHIS] Oh, it's no bother.
I'm all for having goals.

327
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,208
Hold on!

328
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,791
[chuckles]

329
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,291
What if I said I could
feed you the most

330
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,125
delicious cuisine on Earth?

331
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,625
Think that might
change your answer?

332
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,333
The most delicious food on
Earth; are you sure of that?

333
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:34,833
You bet I'm sure!

334
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:37,708
And you have my guarantee it
will blow your feeble mind!

335
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,958
Okay, that's enough!

336
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,375
You can't just swoop in
and steal my thing!

337
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,250
[WHIS]
Food that blows the mind?

338
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,000
Huh?

339
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,500
[VEGETA chuckles]

340
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:51,208
I-would-not-pass-this-up.
Do we have a deal?

341
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:54,250
Oooh. Sorry, Bulma.

342
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:57,916
Whis, wait! Oh, come on,
this is ridiculous!

343
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,583
Get ready!
The tempura here is...

344
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:06,541
...so crispy! Tender!
Crunchy! And divine!

345
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:09,000
One bite and you'll be
in flavor heaven!

346
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,375
[laughs]

347
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,208
It will literally
melt in your mouth!

348
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,916
It is delicious, I agree.

349
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,125
You mean you've had it?

350
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,416
Bulma brought
me here earlier

351
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,166
and we had a fantastic meal.

352
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,541
[grunts]
In that case then...

353
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,666
[exhales] The aroma here
is like nothing else!

354
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,625
This place serves the best eel
with a killer secret sauce!

355
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,916
Oh yes, I remember.
It was exceptional!

356
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,125
What?! So you've
been here too?

357
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:33,583
[VEGETA] How 'bout
this noodle shop?

358
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:34,583
[WHIS]
Mhm!

359
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,208
[VEGETA] How about
this steakhouse?

360
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:37,416
[WHIS]
Uh-huh!

361
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,166
[VEGETA] And the world's
best food stand?

362
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,625
[WHIS]
My favorite was the beef!

363
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:41,875
[BULMA] Don't forget
about the radish!

364
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,875
Been here too? How nice!

365
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:46,625
[grunts]

366
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,166
You leave me no choice!

367
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,166
I'll just have to
cook you my own dish then!

368
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,833
Ha! Brace yourself!

369
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:58,416
Vegeta's world-famous
gourmet rice omelet!

370
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,333
Do you even know
how to crack an egg?

371
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:01,791
[VEGETA]
Silence!

372
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:06,000
You can do this.
Fingertips only.

373
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,041
Aah!

374
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:14,833
Careful now...
Gently-gently!

375
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:17,250
Like you're holding a child!

376
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:25,708
[grunts]

377
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,416
Come on!
You weakling shells!

378
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,958
This might be
a good time to go.

379
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,250
How disappointing.

380
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,625
I was hoping he'd actually
pull something off.

381
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,833
Wait! Don't leave!

382
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:38,958
--Aah!
--[chirps]

383
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,500
Give it up, Vegeta.

384
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:43,041
We both know you've never cooked
a rice omelet in your life.

385
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,083
[grunts]
You've got some nerve

386
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:48,041
criticizing my cooking skills,
Miss Microwave Dinner!

387
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,916
[gasps] Hold on.
Whis, can you tell me

388
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,375
everything that Bulma
has fed you so far?

389
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:56,125
Let's see: tempura,
the eel, the food cart,

390
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,250
beef stir-fry,
a softshell crab soup,

391
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:01,166
and a rather wonderful meal as
part of a tea ceremony, why?

392
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,208
[VEGETA laughs intensely]

393
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:05,666
Just as I suspected.

394
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,916
Bulma's fed you good dishes
but she's holding back

395
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,583
the greatest food of all!

396
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,500
Well that's quite
a provocative claim.

397
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,458
[VEGETA] It's true.
I'm talking about a meal

398
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,708
she can't go one week
without eating!

399
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,875
[gasps]
Vegeta!

400
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,750
All right,
you have my attention.

401
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,416
What is this irresistible fare?

402
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,208
[timer dings]

403
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,666
[VEGETA]
Perfection in a cup.

404
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,166
Hmm. So you're
telling me that this

405
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,916
is the most delicious meal
on your entire planet?

406
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:45,000
[WHIS]
Hm. Hmmm.

407
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:53,500
[WHIS gasps, moans]

408
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:56,208
I think my mouth is in love!

409
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,541
It's wonderful!
The texture is so velvety

410
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:00,791
and the broth is superb!

411
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,291
And the noodles
slide down my throat

412
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,416
like they've been spun
by a galactic silkworm!

413
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,375
I never dreamed such food heaven
could come in a paper cup!

414
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:11,125
I'm not sure what I should
think about this, Bulma.

415
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:14,291
It seems you've been hiding
this one from me on purpose!

416
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:18,250
That's my guilty pleasure!
No one's supposed to know!

417
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,916
Got him!

418
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,333
[WHIS chuckles]

419
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:24,041
Bulma certainly was mad
when you showed me the ramen;

420
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,208
even angrier than
I expected she would be.

421
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,041
Hm? What does that mean?

422
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,750
Are you saying you knew
she was hiding them from you?

423
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:34,041
I wouldn't say that exactly,
but I did have a hunch.

424
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,666
It was awfully nice
of her to give you that

425
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,833
handsome new uniform,
though, wasn't it.

426
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,666
I think you look nice in gray.

427
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,416
[VEGETA]
This is for me? Why?

428
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,958
Well, I can't let you
leave the planet

429
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,500
in those filthy rags.

430
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:48,041
We'd become the laughingstock of
the intergalactic community!

Hey! It's me, Goku!

451
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:03,958
I can't believe Vegeta gets to
train on Beerus' world

452
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:06,500
while I'm stuck
back at home. It's not fair!

But Chichi is on me like a hawk,

454
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:10,375
and for some reason
Gohan is watching me too!

Plus, I don't know how
to get to Beerus' world,

and who knows when
Whis will come back.

Hey Bulma, you think
you can help me?
