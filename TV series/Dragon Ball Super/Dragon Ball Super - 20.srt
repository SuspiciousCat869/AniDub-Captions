00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,416
There was never a need.

160
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,958
Imagine what
could happen if I

161
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,541
unlocked my latent potential.

162
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:27,083
If I train in earnest
for the next four months,

163
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:30,333
my body should be capable of an
enormous leap in strength.

164
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:32,291
I can easily shatter
through the power ceiling

165
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:33,875
of that monkey race.

166
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,416
[laughs]

167
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,791
I can't wait to reap the harvest
this training will bring.

168
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,916
[distant banging]

169
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,458
[WHIS]
Hmmm.

170
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,208
[yells]

171
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,916
[yells]

172
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,041
Mmm. I've noticed
a problem, boys.

173
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,625
You're both allowing
your heightened energy

174
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,125
to leak out of you.

175
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,541
You must keep it within your
body to maximize your power

176
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:06,125
and keep your opponent
in the dark.

177
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,250
Ooh.

178
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,166
[chuckles]

179
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,041
[WHIS] It's hard to believe
they've progressed so far

180
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,666
in such little time.

181
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm beginning to understand what
Beerus sees in these Saiyans.

182
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,500
[BEERUS]
What's going on?

183
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,416
Sounds like a damn
screaming contest.

184
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,125
My lord. I didn't believe
you would be up this early.

185
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:49,750
What do you expect?
Have you seen these ears?

186
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:50,958
[chuckles nervously]

187
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,666
Hi, Lord Beerus, what's up?

188
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,416
[sniffs]

189
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,083
[hollers]

190
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,166
[sneezes]

191
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,333
Whoa, talk about a sneeze!

192
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,458
Good thing it missed us!

193
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,333
I definitely wasn't
ready for that!

194
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:11,250
Yeah. Clearly we need to
stay on guard around here.

195
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:14,750
It's just a moon this time
so we won't need a do-over.

196
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,041
--[BEERUS] Mmm.
--[GOKU, VEGETA] Eeh!

197
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,625
Now that I think about it,
what are you two

198
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:20,166
punch-jockeys doing
on my world, anyway?

199
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,958
We asked Whis to train us,
and he was nice enough to agree.

200
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,583
Yes, Saiyan, I figured
that much. I'm not a fool.

201
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,416
What I mean is how did you two
get here from Earth?

202
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,000
It wasn't too hard,
we just asked Whis

203
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,375
to give us a ride.

204
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,416
Is that a fact?
Ha, and let me guess--

205
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,083
all it took to get
on his good side

206
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,958
was something high in calories.

207
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,791
I honestly don't remember.

208
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,708
Yes, that's pretty much it.

209
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:41,916
And why's it so important

210
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,833
to build your strength,
Saiyans, huh?

211
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,708
I hope this training
isn't your secret way

212
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,833
of gunning for
the job of Destroyer.

213
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,708
Oh, no way.
I'd never want your job.

214
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,583
All I want is to get stronger.

215
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,041
And I'm training
because I don't want

216
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,208
this clown
to leave me in the dust.

217
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,750
What are you talking about?

218
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,583
You're the one who came here
first without saying anything

219
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:00,166
and got the jump on <i>me</i> !

220
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,500
Only 'cause you were
too dumb to think of it!

221
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:05,958
It never ceases to amaze me
how terribly you two get along.

222
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,833
So. What was the treat
and where's my share?

223
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:11,875
I had some for you.
But this time I

224
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,125
dropped it during
the journey back,

225
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,458
clumsy old me.

226
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,500
It's probably floating
through some asteroid belt

227
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:17,958
or nebula right now.

228
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,333
Dropped it in space, huh?
Is that true?

229
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,208
Uh, yeah, that's right,
your lordness!

230
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,791
Whis has some serious
butterfingers, doesn't he?

231
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,625
They both cried.
It was a real tragedy.

232
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:30,083
Oh yes, I'm sure they did.

233
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,041
Hold on. You said
you dropped it

234
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,541
during your journey
back <i>this</i> time.

235
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:37,041
[WHIS]
Mmm...hmmm...

236
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,958
While your lord and
master was sleeping,

237
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:41,666
you've gone to Earth multiple
times, haven't you?

238
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,166
[whistling]

239
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,500
[BOTH gasp]

240
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,500
I'm only going to ask you
this once more, Whis.

241
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,083
You've gone repeatedly?

242
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,750
Yes. That's right, my lord.

243
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:51,875
[BEERUS grunts]

244
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,458
But it's nothing
to get mad about.

245
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:57,166
I've been traveling to Earth for
the most excellent of reasons.

246
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,750
To test the food.

247
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:01,000
--Test it for what?
--For quality, my lord.

248
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,291
And to maximize your
enjoyment in the future!

249
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,250
While much of
their food is gourmet

250
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,750
some is beneath your standards,

251
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,916
and I wanted to spare you
any unpleasant dining.

252
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,458
Taste testing?

253
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:11,666
Uh-huh!

[BOTH gasp]

256

Greetings,
Earthling-human-pups,

257
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,458
this is Bulma's dwelling, right?

258
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,875
Uh, yeah. My mom lives here.
What do <i>you</i> want?

259
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,333
[ALIEN]
Your mom? Fascinating.

260
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,083
You're telling me
you're Bulma's son?

261
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,583
Yeah, that's right. You got
a problem with that, mister?

262
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,666
To think she's become
a broodmare now.

263
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,666
I guess the times
really have changed.

264
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,958
[gasps] Speaking of time
we don't have any.

265
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,750
I need you to
call Bulma right now!

266
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,833
You think he's one of
your mom's friends or what?

267
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,416
Are you kidding?
There's no way

268
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,916
she'd be friends with him.
I mean, look at

269
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,333
his fashion sense.
He's wearing full body tights!

270
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,541
[ALIEN] These are
not tights, little larvae.

271
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:08,791
This is my skin!

[GOTEN, TRUNKS]
Eh?

273
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,583
Hey, where'd you
buy that mask?

274
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,083
I think it's pretty funny!

275
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,916
A mask? What are you
talking about?

276
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,958
It's my face!

Wow, what a costume!

00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,541
Yeah, did you
make this in school?

281
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:27,750
What grade are you?

282
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,875
Would you get off me!
I'm not in school!

283
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:32,166
I'm an adult!

You stupid,
what did you do?

287
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,708
I didn't mean to!
His ear just came off!

288
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:43,916
Relax, it's not my ear.
It's a radio communicator.

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,833
The latest model!

290
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,833
Now will you please hurry
and get Bulma?

291
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,500
You know,
you're kinda bossy.

292
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,791
What's your name, mister?

293
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:54,916
I am the shield
protecting millions of stars!

I am the blazing
torch of justice!

Sorry, dude, that was lame.

[JACO grumbles]

[BULMA]
Oh, hey! It's you, Jaco.

299
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,250
That makes more sense!

300
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,083
Trunks said a "taco"
was here to see me

301
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,500
which sounded odd,
but I've learned

302
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,041
to be ready for anything.

303
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,083
Your child's a handful.

304
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,666
Hey, no touching the Super Elite

Galactic Patrol car
without permission!

306
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:24,916
So, did you
just come to say hi?

307
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,416
It's my understanding
that you're friends with

308
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,583
the man who defeated Frieza,
is that true?

309
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,916
Sure. I guess technically
there were two guys

310
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,833
who beat Frieza,
but I do know them both.

311
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,250
My son Trunks is one of 'em.

What? Wait.

You're telling me that a child
defeated the Evil Emperor?

314
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,666
No silly,
he wasn't even born.

315
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,125
That wouldn't
make sense at all.

I'm talking about
the Trunks who came from

317
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,125
the future in a time machine.

318
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,833
Uh, what the hell, Bulma?

319
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:49,000
You tell me that
like it's no big deal.

320
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:51,833
Galactic Law states altering
time is a high felony offense,

321
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:54,375
punishable by exile
to a penal colony!

322
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,708
[BULMA] Well, nobody told us
anything about that!

323
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,166
Crimes against
space-time aside,

324
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,625
that would be impressive
for any version of your son.

325
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,083
No one in the universe
would expect

326
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,833
that a human
could defeat Frieza.

327
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,583
Well, actually,
he's only half-human.

328
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,291
You see, Trunks and
his little buddy Goten

329
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,625
over there, both have
Saiyan fathers.

330
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,125
Hold on, Saiyans?

331
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,750
You mean <i>the</i> Saiyans,
like from Planet Vegeta?

332
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,083
Yep, that's right!

333
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,250
Saiyans, as in
the warrior race Saiyans?

334
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,041
Are there really
more than one kind?

335
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,708
Are you telling me
you've taken a Saiyan

336
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:21,875
as your life-mate?

337
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,583
We say "husband,"
but sure.

338
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,208
My mind's officially blown.

339
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,041
[beeping]

340
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:29,041
All right, boys,
come down from there.

341
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,916
Don't break
my friend's spaceship.

342
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,041
[BOTH]
Awe!

343
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:33,250
Actually,
they're all right, Bulma.

344
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,500
I don't mind in the least.

345
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,500
Have a great time
up there, okay boys?

346
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:39,250
Is it me or did you
just become a lot nicer?

347
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,666
[chuckles nervously]

348
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,958
Hey, what do you think
that big button does?

349
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,416
There's one way
to find out! Boop!

350
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:48,333
Oh great!

351
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:49,791
Think your mom's
trying to say something.

352
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,583
I don't know. I can't
hear a thing in here.

353
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:55,541
[JACO] Saiyans on Earth? It was
my mission to prevent that.

354
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:58,291
I could get in
major trouble for this.

355
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:01,375
Nah, that was decades ago.
Who's gonna remember?

356
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:04,250
You goofball. Anyway,
you keep getting sidetracked.

357
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,541
Why are you here again?

358
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,250
Like I was saying,
I need to speak to one of

359
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,916
the fighters who stopped Frieza.

360
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,833
Who's the other guy, the one
who's not your time-bending son?

361
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:14,333
That would be Goku. I've
known him most of his life.

362
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:15,958
You need to take me
to him immediately!

363
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,583
I have grave news for him!

364
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,875
Sorry, Jaco, but that's
not happening today.

365
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,250
He's with my husband right now

366
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,833
on Lord Beerus' world
doing who knows what.

367
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,000
Lord Beerus?

368
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,666
[BULMA]
Yeah, Beerus the Destroyer.

369
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,625
Oh come on, Bulma,
that's impossible.

370
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,916
They can't be with Beerus,
he's just a myth.

371
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,125
Well, you're free to think
that if you want, I guess.

372
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,791
I don't have time to debate
cosmic theology with you!

373
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,666
Frieza's been resurrected
and he's on his way

374
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,666
to Earth as we speak, leading
an army of a thousand men!

375
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,208
Huh? Frieza's come back?

376
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,625
[chuckles nervously]

377
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:47,333
This has to be
some kind of joke, right?

378
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:50,166
--Uh, right?
--Uh, wrong.

379
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,125
And with a thousand soldiers?

380
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,375
At least.

381
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,625
Hmm. Frieza's one of
the most ruthless

382
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,750
and evil monsters
we've ever faced.

383
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,250
I should think so.

384
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:02,666
And if you've never faced
his face, I did a quick sketch.

385
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,166
[BULMA]
Ah, that's horrible!

386
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,541
But I can't tell if it's your
drawing or that ugly mug.

387
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,791
[JACO] Reports indicate
he appeared four months ago.

388
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,750
He's strengthened
his force dramatically.

389
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:13,250
And we have reason to believe
they're now as lethal as ever.

390
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,083
Unless something's done,
your entire planet's

391
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,541
going to be conquered.

392
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,208
He's gonna conquer the earth?

393
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:19,708
You could have told me
that first instead of

394
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,791
wasting all this time.
What are we gonna do?

395
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,250
Well, now that I told you,
I'm getting outta here.

396
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:27,666
'Cause I'm young and smart
and do not feel like dying.

[BULMA] Ugh! This is the last
thing I need right now!

400
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,500
Get in the house, boys!

401
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,458

Okay.

Oh, Whis! Hello!

404
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,625
Where are you, Whis?

405
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:50,125
I've got a super-deluxe
strawberry sundae for you!

406
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:51,666
If you want it,
you better get down here

407
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,375
before the sun melts it!

408
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:56,291
It's hot out today and no one
likes ice cream soup!

409
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,250
Always sad
to see the mind go.

410

Hey, Whisy-poo!

I need details, Jaco.
How much time

414
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:06,916
do we have
'til Frieza gets here?

415
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,375
Are we talking like a week,
or ten days, or what?

416
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,875
I'd say about an hour.

417
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:17,000
An hour?! Why didn't
you say that, you bozo!

418
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:20,416
Now I barely have time
to warn anyone who can help!

419
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,416
So rude.

00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:39,208
Okay, here we go.
Looks like it's Bulma.

What's up?
I can't talk long.

I'm a chatterbox,

although I think he just
doesn't get comedy.

00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,833
What? Frieza's back?

428
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,875
That's impossible!

00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,833
An hour? What kinda
warning is that?

430
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,250
Okay, understood.

431
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,208
I'll start getting
ready right now.

432
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:02,416
Don't worry about Master Roshi,
I'll call him myself.

00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,583
Sounds like a plan.
We'll be there soon.

[A18]
Here you go.

435
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,791
Thanks, 18.
You sure got here quick.

436
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,000
Sure.

437
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,708
I thought I'd never
wear this again,

438
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:13,083
but that's what I get
for thinking.

439
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,958
There's no way I'll be
killed twice by the same guy.

440

Life's not that cruel. I hope.

441
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,083
I should be going with you.

442
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,416
Don't get your feelings hurt,

443
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,375
but I'm still a lot
stronger than you are.

444
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,333
Maybe so,
but you can't go.

445
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,041
Somebody's gotta
keep Maron safe

and get her away
if it comes to that.

trying to reach 'em.

She's not sure it'll work,
so we just have to hope.

Luckily we'll have Gohan
and Buu with us, at least.

00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:33,208
[KRILLIN]
Mm!

472
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:34,750
[GOHAN]
Right behind you!

473
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,625
Hey, you guys.
Good timing.

474
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:39,041
Wow, it's been a while
since you've gone full cue ball!

475
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,125
I know, right?
Back in fighting shape.

476
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,416
I started to worry
you wouldn't join us.

477
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,833
I know that you got a little
girl to think about now.

478
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:48,958
Same as you,
but we can't sit this one out.

479
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,875
[ALL gasp]

480
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,208
All right guys,
they're here.

481
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:54,583
But that's massive.

482
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:57,958
Can this resurrected Frieza
really be that strong?

483
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,000
[ROSHI grunts]

484
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,708
Damn it.

485
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:04,250
[SORBET] We'll be landing
on Earth shortly, my lord.

486
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,875
[FRIEZA laughs]
Let me get this straight.

487
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,125
You've had over a decade
and the most advanced fleet

488
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:10,625
of all time yet
you've only found

489
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,583
one of the Saiyans
who defeated me?

490
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,541
[SORBET] Yes. Believe
me sir, we've looked

491
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,000
everywhere for the other one.

492
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,083
[FRIEZA] Fine. That'll
have to do for now.

493
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,500
But Lord Frieza,
once you get your revenge,

494
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,875
what's to stop someone from
using the Dragon Balls

495
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,166
to bring the Saiyan
back all over again?

496
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,416
Ha-ha!
Don't worry, my minion.

497
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,833
I've already thought of that.

498
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,833
They're landing. This is it.

499
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:45,208
Hell was a womb,
and the dream of vengeance,

500
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:47,583
my umbilical.
Now I am reborn

501
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,958
and will suckle
the sweet milk of victory!

502
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:51,333
[laughs intensely]

503
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:53,000
[NARRATOR]
The invasion begins.

504
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:56,041
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super!

505
00:21:57,666 --> 00:22:00,958
<i>I look back</i>
<i>to when I was young</i>


506
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:04,083
<i>Reminisce on all that I've done</i>


507
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:06,458
<i>In my hands, I held</i>


508

<i>The dreams of my childhood,</i>

00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:14,750
<i>So let's ride upon</i>

510
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,375
<i>A world we've never known</i>


511
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:23,000
<i>(It's a brand new story)</i>
<i>Now, a new chapter starts</i>


512

<i>Shining Star</i>

<i>Take me to where I belong</i>


515

<i>The warmth we once shared</i>

522
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:02,208
[GOHAN]
Hi everybody, it's Gohan.

523
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:04,916
I can't believe Frieza is back
after all these years.

524
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And he's a lot more
powerful than before.

525
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:08,833
With my dad
and Vegeta so far away,

526
00:23:08,916 --> 00:23:11,708
we've got to make our stand
against a thousand warriors.

527
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:14,666
But the odds don't matter.
We can't afford to fail!

528
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,041
Krillin, watch out!

529
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:17,250
I'm coming to help!

530
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:19,541
[GOKU] Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

531
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:21,291
"The Start of Vengeance!

532
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:23,958
The Frieza Force's
Malice Strikes Gohan!"

533
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:26,208
Make sure you don't
miss it, okay?
