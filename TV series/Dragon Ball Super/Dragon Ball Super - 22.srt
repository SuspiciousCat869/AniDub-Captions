00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,875
but Goten and I can do
way cooler action poses!

161
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,541
--Right?
--[JACO] I can't even.

162
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,750
Captain Ginyu. It's been
a long time indeed

163
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,333
since I've seen you.

164
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:28,791
Between your battle
with the Saiyans

165
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,083
and the explosion of Namek,

166
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,666
I thought you'd
perished for sure.

167
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,500
Would you like to hear the
tale of my survival, my lord?

168
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,000
I hope you won't
think less of me,

169
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,500
but it brings me to tears
just thinking about it!

170
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:39,958
The whole ordeal
began when I was

171
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,833
fighting that traitor Vegeta.

172
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:45,291
I was trying to use my
body-swapping power against him!

173
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:46,833
I thought it would
serve him right if he had

174
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:48,875
to watch his
own body be defeated!

175
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,958
[laughs]

176

[GINYU]
I've got you now!

177
00:09:55,541 --> 00:10:00,916
[GINYU]
Change now!

[VEGETA grunts]

[FROG groans]

180
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,750
[GINYU] The other Saiyan
interfered with my battle,

181
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:10,125
and I was trapped in the body
of that Namekian frog!

182
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,458
[GINYU FROG croaks]

183
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:12,541
I hate that frog.

184
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,416
I forgot all about that.

185
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,458
[FEMALE NAMEK FROG]
Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!

186
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:18,333
[GINYU] I thought
my fate was sealed!

187
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:21,416
I was trapped in that
Namekian wasteland!

188
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,291
[GINYU FROG]
Huh?

189
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,000
[GINYU] Then suddenly,
I was on this planet,

190
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,250
for reasons
I couldn't understand!

191
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,875
It was the Dragon Balls.

192
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,166
What do you mean? When?

193
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,250
On Namek.
When Frieza's attack

194
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,416
was about to rip
the planet apart.

195
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,916
Dende asked their Dragon
to transport everyone

196
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,583
except Goku and Frieza to
Earth to avoid casualties.

197
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:43,833
Ginyu came, too?

198
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,708
So, you mean he's
been here this whole time?

199
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,208
I hate that frog!

200
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,083
So, I'm guessing
you two have some history?

201
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,541
I don't wanna talk about it.

202
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:51,958
[ALL gasp]

203
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:53,750
[GINYU] But my hardships
didn't end there!

204
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:56,583
I endured years
of humiliating struggle!

205
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:59,166
But I persevered no matter
how awful it got!

206
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,416
Because I always believed
in my heart that one day

207
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,083
I'd be able to fight
for you again, Lord Frieza!

208
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:06,166
And now that time has come.

209
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,958
Let me show you something
I've been working on, sir!

210
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:13,375
A special fighting pose
to mark this day!

211
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,458
[FRIEZA]
Mm.

212
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,333
If you really want
to show me something,

213
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:20,000
then why don't you show me
a few heads on a platter.

214
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,083
Yes, sir!

215
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,875
I haven't gotten
used to this body yet

216
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,375
but I'm sure it'll be enough
to handle these maggots.

217
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:31,541
Sorry, but you're facing
the great Captain Ginyu now!

218
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:35,958
[yells]

219
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:46,625
So? Shall we get started?

220
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,083
[laughs]

221
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,291
Who would've
guessed that exuberant

222
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,416
old captain was still alive?

223
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,333
I normally hate being wrong,
but this is delightful.

224
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:17,375
[laughs]

225
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:18,541
I know you.

226
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,500
You were that child
who was with Vegeta

227
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,333
back on Namek, correct?

228
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,250
And you were there too, baldy.

229
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:27,666
I'm going to enjoy
settling these scores.

[laughs]

234
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:47,375
Marvelous, captain,
this body fits you well!

235
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,416
He's so strong.

236
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,958
His energy is
even greater than before.

237
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,750
Tagoma's body was strong
but he had nothing

238
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:56,083
close to Ginyu's
experience in battle.

239
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,666
The captain must know
how to maximize his power.

241

I was due some good luck!

Inhabiting a body
with this level

243
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,875
of battle power is
almost indescribable!

244
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:08,333
All those years hopping
in the dirt were worth it!

I feel so good!

I'm never going to let this
vessel go, I swear it!

It's the best body
I've ever worn!

Just a shame
we can't do anything

249

to swap out that
farcical personality.

250

with all that speed
and fighting skill.

Master Roshi, Tien,
you can't help in this fight.

Then you're gonna
help me make a call.

We've gotta contact Whis.

So he can tell your dads to
come join the fight, okay?

I'm gonna
stick my face in it!

Well, it looks like
the crazy is spreading.

270
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,291
It's a little greasy,
but I could see it

271
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:25,333
on the regular menu.
Now, what it's called again?

272
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:26,791
That's "pizza," my lord.

273
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,125
Pizza, yes.

274
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:31,041
Ridiculous name for
a food, don't you think?

275
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:33,916
Now that you've been fed,

276
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,625
do you still think
it was wise to send them

277
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,291
to that realm, my lord?

278
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:39,791
Relax, Whis, they're fine.

279
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,375
They're the type
of fighters who can only

280
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:44,083
reach their full potential if
they're pushed to their limits.

281
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:47,166
Besides, if we're doing this,
I want it done quickly.

282
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,625
So I can have someone
to play with.

Ah! Damn it!

Come on!

288
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,875
So, that's the trick.

289
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,750
If I raise my energy
but control it

290
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,041
so it doesn't
leak out, I can move.

291
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:29,833
Nice, Vegeta! Shoulda
known you'd figure it out!

292
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,041
Yeah, it's working
for me, too.

293
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,416
That's way better.

294
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,458
Pretty demanding to
keep it all inside, though.

295
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:43,000
So is this the secret
to divine energy?

296
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,625
The pressure
inside's so intense.

297

Kakarot. Doesn't this place
remind you of somewhere?

298
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,416
Yeah! The way the air
feels is definitely

299
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,958
ringing a bell.
All weird and humid.

300
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:58,250
It feels exactly like the
Hyperbolic Time Chamber!

301
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,750
[VEGETA]
Hmph!

302
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,541
Eeeh! This is the
ultimate training space!

303
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:05,708
This must be where Lord Beerus
goes to get stronger, too!

304
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,291
Wait, I just realized!

305
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:08,666
What Kakarot? Spit it out!

306
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,750
If it's like the Chamber

307
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:10,875
then it's
a different dimension,

308
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,416
so there may not be an exit.

309
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,916
We've got to find
the supply building

310
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,625
or wherever Beerus
keeps his food in here

311
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,333
before we're
too drained to move.

312
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,791
Or we could starve to death,
which is kind of a problem.

313
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,333
Of course it's
a problem, you moron.

314
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,625
It might be another way
he's testing us!

315
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:27,500
And the only thing that might
help us is that staff.

[yells]

317
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:37,250
You definitely don't live up
to my expectations, boy.

318
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,000
Why'd you jump at
the chance to fight me

319
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,208
if this is all you can do?

320
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,375
[GOHAN] I'm not tapping
into my full strength!

321
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,958
Is that 'cause
I haven't been training?

322
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,041
--[GINYU yells]
--[GOHAN groans]

323
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,583
I got you now, boy!

324
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:01,666
[laughs]

325
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,291
Gohan, no!

326
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:14,458
[GOHAN] No choice.
I have to do it now.

327
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:17,583
[bellows]

328
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,750
He's a Super Saiyan, too?

329
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,041
Huh?!

330
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,291
It seems Goku shared
his technique with

331
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:28,291
both his sons, like some
twisted monkey virus.

332
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:29,666
Evidently,
you've been hiding

333
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,666
a massive amount
of power from me.

334
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,291
Like you didn't think you needed
it to battle Captain Ginyu.

335
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,875
And that's an insult
I do not take lightly.

336
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:40,125
[GOHAN] If I am out of shape,
it's time to find out

337
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:41,625
how much I can take.

338
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:43,000
A real Super Saiyan.

339
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:46,000
This should be far
more interesting now.

340
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,791
[yells]

341
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:54,708
Way to go!

342
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,375
Man, my brother's awesome!

343
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,666
We both know
this battle's over.

344
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,625
I won't keep hurting you
just to feed my own ego.

345
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,333
[gasps]

346
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,000
[snarls]

347
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:14,583
Now get off my planet
before I change my--

348
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,416
[groans]

349
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,916
Miserable Saiyan.

350
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,916
Thank you, Lord Frieza,

351
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,791
he merely
caught me by surprise.

352
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,416
I can handle
the fight from here.

353
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,791
[FRIEZA]
Stand down, Captain!

354
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:27,958
Yes, sir!

355
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,583
I appreciate your
overflowing enthusiasm,

356
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:32,166
but I've decided
to kill this one myself.

357
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,958
After inflicting
a great deal of pain.

358
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:35,875
Gohan!

359
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:36,958
Stay back, Goten!

360
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,375
But why?

361
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,791
[GOHAN] You're no match for him.
I don't want you hurt.

362
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,000
[GOTEN grumbles]

363
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:44,583
What brotherly love;
I can barely stomach it.

364
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,333
I would be
an unforgivable villain

365
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,291
if I separated
the two of you boys.

366
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,166
When I'm done with Gohan
I'll kill you, too,

367
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,125
so you can hold hands in Hell.

368
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,958
It shames me to admit,
but did you know

369
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,875
that I was once
spared by your father?

370
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,666
The same way you just
spared Captain Colorful?

371
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:04,125
There. I've given you
some of my energy.

372
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,166
With any luck,
it should be just enough

373
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,208
to get you off this planet
before it blows.

374
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,500
But that's all you get.

375
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,416
I was a filthy
simian's charity case.

376
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,250
Do you realize how
I've suffered from that,

377
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:19,333
reliving the humiliation
every day since?

378
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:22,125
And now you have the gall
to remind me of it again!

379
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,041
You'll pay dearly for that.

380
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,500
Yes, you'll pay
with your suffering

381
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,500
and the pleasure
it will afford me.

382
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,916
For the sight of Goku's face

383
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,125
when he finds
what is left of you.

384
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:32,875
When he imagines the agony
I put you through,

385
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,791
now that is a fair recompense!

386
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,625
Gohan!

387
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:40,041
I will not allow you
to interfere with this fight!

388
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:43,416
[yells, groans]

389
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,458
Well? What are you waiting for?

390
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,416
If you're entertaining
any hope of survival,

391
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,166
then you had better run.

392
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,708
[yells]

393
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,041
[BULMA]
Gohan!

394
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:57,541
Sorry, I can't watch this.
I'm a very easy fainter.

395
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:02,750
Does that hurt, child?
Are you suffering now?

396
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,500
It hardly compares
to what Goku did to me

397
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,500
so we're not remotely
close to being done.

398
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:09,541
And not because I'm a sadist,
it's simply tit for tat.

399
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,291
[yells, groans]

400
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:16,166
Go on. Try to escape;
I enjoy a moving target!

401
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,208
[yells, groans

402
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:20,875
[FRIEZA] Oh, drat,
now I've done it.

403
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,458
You can't even stand.

404
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:25,250
[groans]

405
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,750
I see you haven't inherited
all of daddy's traits.

406
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,916
You give up much faster.

407
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,125
[screams]

408
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,875
[FRIEZA] If you think I'll stop
once when you're on the ground,

409
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,208
well, you're not
thinking at all.

410
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:41,250
[screams]

411
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,458
You don't know how this works.

412
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:45,708
Once you can't move anymore,

413
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,833
you're supposed
to beg for mercy.

414
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:50,708
Say you'll do anything
if I spare your life.

415
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:54,416
Let's hear it, boy!
Cry for me! Scream!

416
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,166
Soak your face in tears
and rend your clothes!

417
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,000
[laughs]

418
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,250
Not that I would
let you go,

419
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,791
but it's all part of
the experience for me.

420
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,000
No, mercy would be impossible.

421
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:08,333
I've waited for this too long.

422
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,333
Your death will
balance the scales.

423
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,791
It's what you get
for being a Saiyan.

424
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:17,000
And it's what you deserve
for being Goku's son.

425
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,791
[FRIEZA]
Now die!

426
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:20,750
Gohan!

427
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:23,166

429
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:44,833
[GOHAN]
Piccolo, why?

430
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:48,750
Why would you do that? Piccolo!

431
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,750
[NARRATOR] Piccolo has
paid the ultimate price.

432
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,708
How will Gohan respond?

433
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:57,583

Hey! It's me, Goku!

452
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:03,333
Vegeta and I have
to help our friends,

453
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:05,750
but first I need find
a way to get us back!

454
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:07,000
And once we do get there,

455
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:09,500
the action is going
to heat up fast!

456
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:11,416
Frieza says
he's gotten stronger,

457
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,416
but could he really
be on our level?

458
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,416
I guess we're
about to find out!

459
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,791
Next time,

"Earth! Gohan!

Hurry and Get Here, Goku!!"

Wait, that's me!
I'll do what I can, okay?
