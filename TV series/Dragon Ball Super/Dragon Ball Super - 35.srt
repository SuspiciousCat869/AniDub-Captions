Wishing on the starlight

In the sky, let's paint a door for tomorrow

Just step on the new stage don't be shy

[NARRATOR] Previously,
on Dragon Ball Super,

17
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,530
Frost, known as a heroic
ambassador for peace

18
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,600
in the Sixth Universe,
defeated Goku and Piccolo

19
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,530
in the Tournament of Destroyers.

20
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:41,440
But then, Frost's
true nature was exposed.

21
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,740
[laughs]

22
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,910
Yes, I start my own wars.

23
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,410
But then I resolve them,
and buy up all the

24
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:53,280
war-ravaged land
at bargain prices.

25
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,920
After that, I make a killing
off the very lucrative

26
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,020
post-reconstruction profits.
I'm tellin' ya,

27
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,720
it's quite a business model
I've cooked up here.

28
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,290
I'm the problem
 and the solution.

29
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,630
That's funny.
Now he doesn't seem to be

30
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,830
all that different from Frieza.

31
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,430
He cheated! Frost has
been using a weapon,

32
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,540
which is prohibited
by the rules!

33
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,370
[NARRATOR]
Thanks to Jaco's sharp vision,

34
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,680
Frost was caught
using a toxic needle

35
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,510
and disqualified
from the tournament,

36
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,380
enraging Lord Champa.

37
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,050
You really think
you can just walk away

38
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,450
after bringing this
kind of shame on me?

39
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,880
I will destroy you!

40
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,350
[VEGETA]
Hold on!

41
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,950
There's no need for threats.

42
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:36,020
And no need to disqualify him.

43
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,530
'Cause I'm up next. Got that?

44
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,900
And I'd like to
beat that bastard myself.

45
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,770
[FROST] So, you want me
to keep my victory?

46
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,500
You must be pretty
sure of yourself.

47
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,780
Don't blame me if you wind up
regretting this in the end.

48
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,550
Shut up. Your voice annoys me.

49
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,680
Oh, really? Too bad.

[NARRATOR]
The fight between Vegeta

51
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:05,390
and the cheating
Frost begins now!

52
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,800
That looked rough,
Piccolo--you okay?

53
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,470
[PICCOLO] I'm fine. Vegeta.
Don't let your guard down.

54
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:26,010
That snake will
do anything to win.

55
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,880
Seems he has a rather
low opinion of me.

56
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:35,120
That always appears to happen
when people learn the truth.

57
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,820
Judging from your
sour countenance

58
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:40,550
I won't be getting on
your good side, either.

59
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:44,060
[laughs]
But that's okay, I don't mind.

60
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,660
You're correct to be suspicious.

61
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,360
I believe cunning
and deception

62
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,530
are the ultimate weapons
in a warrior's belt.

63
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,700
Of course,
now that you're aware

64
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:57,540
of my lethal secret,
the game has changed.

65
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,680
[VEGETA]
Hm?

66
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,680
In my battle
with your green friend,

67
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,850
I waited till the last moment
to use this needle

68
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,550
so as not to lose
the element of surprise.

69
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,620
Now, since it's
no longer a mystery,

70
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,960
I don't have to be so careful.

71
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:19,590
That means no more hesitation.
No more holding back.

72
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,530
And no more mercy.

73
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,800
Now I can use this venom
with joyful abandon.

74
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,840
Wait a minute--
you can't do that!

75
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,540
These tournament rules
are sacred,

76
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,410
and they have to be respected!

77
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,840
Use that weapon again
and I  will disqualify you!

78
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,010
That's what the little green
man with the microphone says.

79
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,020
But what do you say?

80
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,750
He can use whatever he wants.

00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,120
Are you sure about that?

82
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,050
I won't let this
prideless bastard walk off

83
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,920
on some technicality.

84
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,860
He will leave because
I have knocked him out!

Aw, for heaven's sake.

Does he have to play the hero
when there's poison involved?

Go ahead.

There. That wasn't
so hard, now was it?

94
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,620
So it's agreed.

95
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,120
For this match only,
the use of all weapons,

96
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,160
including venom, is allowed.

97
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,160
We can fight as we see fit.

98
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,000
But wait. There's still
that pesky restriction

99
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:31,630
against killing your
opponent, isn't there?

100
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,000
Now that we can use weapons,

101
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,970
what if we accidentally
land a lethal blow?

102
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,140
Well, I suppose we'll just
have to cross that bridge

00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,760
Yeah, but we're
pretty strong, too.

161
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,760
What if we win the whole
thing before his turn?

162
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,270
That's not exciting.
I want to see him fight!

163
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,900
Believe it or not,
I don't care what you want.

164
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,900
[GOKU] You can't blame me
for being curious.

165
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,340
Look at him; he's so focused.
He doesn't even blink!

166
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,770
[quietly]
It's not because he's focused,

167
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,040
it's because he's unconscious.

168
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,010
Has been ever since he saw
your Kamehame-Ha Wave.

169
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,110
[GOKU]
Huh?

170
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,380
[BEERUS hollers]

171
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,880
[BEERUS] No-no-no-no,
he didn't say anything,

172
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,920
just nonsense--
muttering nonsense. Forget it!

173
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,890
Are you trying
to ruin everything?

174
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,920
You're playing
a most dangerous game.

175
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,930
Exactly how long do you plan
to keep this up, my lord?

176
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,260
As long as I possibly can.
Hopefully forever!

177
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,000
I order you to keep this
a secret. Do you hear me?

178
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,230
I'll do my best.

179
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,440
[screams]

180
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,870
I know we're focusing
on the matches now,

181
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,400
but after we're done
you'll fight me, right?

182
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,070
I told you, no contact!

183
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,240
I'm not swinging at him.
I just want to talk!

184
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,340
Absolutely not, Goku!

185
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,310
--That's weird.
--What? What's weird?

186
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,250
He's not reacting to us at all.

187
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,050
[growls]
Get out of here!

188
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,090
[GOKU groans]

189
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,820
Ow!

190
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,230
Don't you think you're
overreacting just a little, sir?

191
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,930
It's for your own
protection, Goku.

192
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,300
He's very dangerous when
he's focusing like that.

193
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,160
If you disturb him
while he's in this state,

194
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,430
he'll lash out like a man
startled from a dream,

195
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,800
flailing at all in his path.

196
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,270
He once destroyed
a world because of

197
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,740
an ill-timed
tap on the shoulder.

198
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,940
What? Why didn't you tell me?

199
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,380
[quietly]
Impressive adlibbing.

200
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,780
[sighs]

201
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,350
This is exhausting.
I don't know what I did

202
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,380
to deserve all this
ridiculous stress.

203
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,250
[WHIS, quietly]
Agree to this contest, for one.

204
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:49,520
Did someone say something?
It must've been those Kais.

205
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,390
Now on to the next match!

206
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,430
But first, let's talk about
the rule change!

207
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,760
The what?

208
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,370
[ALL gasp]

209
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,000
[VEGETA]
Hm?

210
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,310
What's going on?

211
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,380
As you can see,
the ring has been enclosed

212
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,380
in a brand new cubic barrier!

213
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,280
Since this structure
is outside the ring,

214
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,420
touching any part of it
during your match

215
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:20,020
will now mean automatic
victory for your opponent!

216
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,160
[VEGETA huffs]

217
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,360
I'm afraid that's all I can do
without delays, my lord.

218
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,160
But, with some more time I could
make it far more protective.

219
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,030
Oh, spare me your
perfectionist drivel.

220
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,530
I don't really care about that!

221
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,100
That's not the point of this.

222
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,200
What are you up to, Champa?

223
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,540
Nobody told me
about a rule change!

224
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,340
[CHAMPA]
Hey, take it easy, brother!

225
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,770
I certainly didn't mean
to upset you.

226
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,780
You remember how the
larger dome was damaged

227
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:45,080
in the last fight, don't you?
That was really dangerous!

228
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,780
I simply want to ensure
the safety of our guests.

229
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,350
These fighters are powerful!

230
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,120
We need to take
some precautions!

231
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,490
And, of course,
if we add a barrier

232
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,390
we have to address it
in the rules.

233
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,790
You can't make changes
without asking me!

234
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,330
Hm! Sure I can.

235
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,960
You told me setting up
the arena was my job.

236
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,560
Fine. But you can't
change the rules, too!

237
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,500
[CHAMPA] Don't you care about
protecting our guests?

238
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,930
[BEERUS]
Of course not!

239
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,000
Why would I care
what happens to mortals?

240
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,940
And the gods can
take care of themselves!

241
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,940
[CHAMPA] You sit down!
You're whining over nothing!

242
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,140
[BEERUS, CHAMPA growl]

243
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,810
Why not settle this peacefully

244
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,580
with a game of
rock-paper-scissors, eh?

245
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,350
[BOTH growl]

246
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,280
That works for me.
[growl]

247
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,220
Rock-paper-scissors!
One-two-three!

248
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,990
One-two-three! One-two-three!

249
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,190
One-two-three-one-two-three-
one-two-three-one-two-three--

250
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:35,260
[BEERUS, CHAMPA holler rapidly]

251
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,170
[VADOS]
Hmmm.

252
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,510
[panting]

253
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,180
[chuckles]

254
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,850
As you can see I've collected
more than enough incentive

255
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,350
for you to give your all.

256
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,960
If the five of you
win this contest for me,

257
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,290
you can take all you want.

258
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,430
Don't even ask
what happens if you lose.

259
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,200
[FROST]
Champa's hexahedron.

260
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,000
If I move the treasure
in there and get it to fly,

261
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,970
I can jump across
the universe in no time.

262
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,080
Not even Galactic Patrol
or Destroyers

263
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,110
will be able to catch me.

264
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,450
[MAN]
Not so fast.

265
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,620
[gasps]

266
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,460
[FROST grunts]

267
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,700
That's close enough!

268
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,710
[FROST]
Hit, the legendary assassin.

269
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,080
I know your reputation.

270
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,610
Did Champa
order you to kill me

271
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:11,210
for losing my battle
against the Saiyan?

272
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,020
Or maybe you've
been hired by some

273
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,680
vengeance-seeking
prey from one of

274
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,620
the countless planets
I plundered for profit?

275
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,430
[FROST groans]

276
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:33,440
[screams]

277
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:38,340
What did you do to me?
You didn't even move.

278
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,210
No one hired me, Frost.
I just can't let you

279
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,680
steal something
that's been promised to me.

280
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,080
Hm. My favorite
sort of problem;

281
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,390
one that handles itself.

282
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,090
Aah. Damn that game.

283
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,200
All it accomplished
was a sore hand!

284
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,760
All those rounds
of rock-paper-scissors

285
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,300
ended in a tie?

286
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,170
We kept throwing
the same thing!

287
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,270
Are you certain
you're okay with this?

288
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,540
[BEERUS grunts]

289
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,540
I still don't like it,
but it's not worth

290
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:12,610
fighting Champa over.
Besides, if our own contestant

291
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,250
doesn't mind a cage match,
why should I?

292
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,120
I don't know what trick those
bastards are trying to play,

293
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,550
but it's going to
take a whole lot more

294
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:23,290
than a glass box to stop me.

295
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,490
Thank you for waiting
through that delay!

296
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,090
We're back on track!

297
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:31,460
And ready for the next
world-shaking face-off!

298
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,460
The ring's set up
for you, Magetta!

299
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,560
Now make sure you deliver!

Gulp! Gulp!

You're sure that's
a living organism

308
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,320
and not a robot, right?

309
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,460
[laughs] If you mean
the Metalman from

310

Galactic System
Six-Six-Nine-Five-Zero,

311
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,700
then of course. You probably
have them as well.

312
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,800
Which you would know
if you'd bothered to look.

[ELDER KAI grunts]

314

You ever hear of
a Metalman before?

315
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,840
Actually, now that
you mention it...

It does ring a bell, sir.

317
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,510
I may have heard
of them once and forgot.

research better?!

Yes, sir, I'm sorry.

[MAGETTA]
Gulp! Gulp! Gulp!

322
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,860
Let's hear it for
Vegeta's next opponent!

323
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:39,230
From Universe Six!
Contestant Otta Magetta!

Look at that ridiculous hulk.

00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,640
There's no question
how he's going to fight.

Just as I thought.

332
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,320
Now that's some power.

333
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,750
His style's obvious.

334
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,690
He's hoping his strength can
make up for his lack of speed.

335
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:10,260
I'd laugh if it
weren't so pathetic.

336
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,900
You can't win with
speed or power alone.

337
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,570
True warriors have both.

malfunctioned or something?

Despite the fierce barrage
of blows from Vegeta

353
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,490
and his own fists,
Magetta's okay!

Damn it. You're one tough
bastard, I'll give you that.

His power is up, too.

[VEGETA] Close combat's
too risky against him now.

Without understanding
his language,

we can only speculate!
What's the iron behemoth doing?

370
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,960
He's once again stopped moving,

00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,990
simply staring at
his opponent above.

Be careful; the barrier's
right behind you!

If you touch it, that counts
as a ring-out, remember!

I know that, Kakarot.
I'm not a fool!

Okay folks, I've just received
a full anatomic report!

The Metalman race can
naturally produce lava saliva!

392
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,550
It is therefore permissible!
