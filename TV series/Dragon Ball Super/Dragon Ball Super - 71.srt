00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,916
and you could go into hiding.

317
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,708
How would the great Goku respond
to such a merciful offer?

318
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:29,083
Well, for starters, I'd say,
"Thanks, but no thanks."

319
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:32,833
[HIT] Yes. That's exactly
what I thought.

320
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:36,250
Now then, it's time for me
to make the donuts.

321
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,166
Turn around and face me.

322
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,250
[GOKU] So you can't kill me
with my back to you, huh?

323
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:44,416
[HIT] Normally I don't mind
sneaking up on my prey.

324
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,166
It makes it easier on them.

325
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,833
They have less time
to be afraid.

326
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:50,458
But you're different.

327
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:53,875
I've decided my single strike
to you will be head on.

328
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:57,083
A single strike? Hm.

329
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,125
Long time no see, Hit.
How's it goin'?

330
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:04,875
This is goodbye.

331
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:08,166
Your Time Skip ain't
gonna work on me anymore.

332
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,333
[HIT] You really think I'd use
the same technique on you again?

333
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,416
Do I look that charitable?

334
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,916
So you're admitting I can
outmaneuver it now.

335
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,375
You're gonna have to
get more creative

336
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,416
if you want to bring the pain.

337
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,208
There will be no pain.

338
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,291
Like I said, it will
take just one strike.

339
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:24,958
Sorry, but I don't think so.

--Huh?
--[GOKU] I didn't hit him?

343
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:38,875
[GOKU] That's definitely
not Time Skipping.

344
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:42,125
If punching won't work
on him, maybe this will!

345
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,666
[GOKU]
No, that wasn't his attack.

[GOKU gasps]

347
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,500

[continues groaning]

352

I will be back.

Once the dust has fully settled.

Stay with us, you hear me!
