[BASIL groans]

159
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,916
[KRILLIN]
He-heh.

160
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:34,166
[laughing]

161
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,416
Uh-uuh!

162
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:40,000
This will finish you off
once and for all!

163
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,541
Uh...

164
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:45,500
[KRILLIN yells]

165
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:50,333
You know, maybe this fight
is too much for Krillin.

166
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:53,916
No way. Krillin'll do
just fine there.

167
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,750
He's started training again.

168
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,166
Huh? Really? He has? Since when?

169
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,958
He's even got this awesome
technique you've never

170
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,958
heard of before, so he'll be
more than all right, son.

171
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,541
So that makes six.

172
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:07,250
What do you think about adding
Goten and Trunks to the team?

173
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,791
They seem to have
extensive latent abilities.

174
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:13,083
Nah, that's not gonna work.
Those boys are still too green.

175
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:16,000
This tournament is more than
just a raw test of strength.

176
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,791
You win by pushing others
out of the ring,

177
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,333
which requires strategy.

178
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,250
They don't have
enough experience.

179
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:24,000
Okay, in that case,
what about Master Roshi?

180
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,125
I mean, he's got
centuries of experience,

181
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,625
and knows all kinds
of tricky maneuvers.

182
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:32,291
[GOKU] Oh, yeah. I guess the
old-timer can fight well enough.

183
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:33,916
All right, that makes seven.

184
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,666
--[MR. SATAN] 'Scuse me.
--Huh?

185
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,375
Might I suggest
you ask Number 18?

186
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:41,375
Aah! That's a great idea!

187
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:44,541
Yeah, and there's
Number 17, too.

188
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,166
We should ask 18
where to find him.

189
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,791
[SUPREME KAI]
Are you sure that's allowed?

190
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,833
Those two are technically
robots, aren't they?

191
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,500
Well, they're human-based.

192
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,166
Just upgraded
to superhuman strength

193
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,041
at the cellular level,
that's all.

194
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,500
[SUPREME KAI]
But still...

195
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:00,291
I'm going to have to pretend
I didn't hear any of that!

196

[SUPREME KAI]
Lord Beerus.

197
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,166
If they can win, then I
don't care what they are!

198
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,958
That makes nine. One more to go.

199
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:09,916
[GOKU]
Hmm. Who else is there?

200
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,333
Well, we still have
some time to figure it out,

201
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,958
so I see no need to force
a decision right away.

202
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,375
Indeed--that's a good point.

203
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,208
And there still could be
people on other worlds

204
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:21,541
with high combat abilities.
We should explore that.

205
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,083
Then I'll leave you to it.
I'm gonna stick around

206
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,333
a little longer and
finish things up here.

207
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,500
[SUPREME KAI]
Don't overdo it, Great Ancestor.

208
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,458
Yeah, yeah, I know!

209
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,875
Man, this Tournament
of Power is shaping up to be

210
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:39,000
tons of fun already!
Oh, before it starts,

211
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,166
we'd better go get
some senzu from Korin.

212
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,958
Actually, I believe those
are against the rules.

213
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,833
--[GOKU] Uh?
--[WHIS] If I'm not mistaken,

214
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,625
[WHIS] "senzu" are
those beans that recover

215
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,125
your physical strength?

216
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,000
That technically makes
them an "outside weapon,"

217
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,750
which is clearly not allowed.

218
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:56,291
Wait, so no senzu?
I don't like the sound of that.

is like, really huge!

There's this one guy, Top,
from the Eleventh Universe,

232

and even after
turning Blue, I'm not sure

have to count me out.

Uuh...

Why are you so eager
for me to join your little team?

253
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,583
That isn't like you, Kakarrot.

254
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,041
Ordinarily,
you'd be much happier

hogging an opportunity
like this all to yourself.

256

That way, you'd be able
to fight 80--well, 70--

Yeah, just think. Then you

465
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,500
[YAMCHA laughing]
Then I get to play the hero!

466
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:57,083
Now to head home and just wait
for them to come beggin'!

467
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,583
[YAMCHA]
All right, check this out.

468
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,666
Excuse me there, Bulma!

469
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,166
I just remembered there's
something I need to do.

470
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,916
Guess I'll see ya later, then!
Goodbye for now!

471
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:11,541
That Yamcha sure is
a popular guy, isn't he?

472
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,041
Bulla, hmm?

473
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:17,083
[laughing]

474
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:21,125
[VEGETA]
Well, it's not the worst name.

475
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,458
[BULMA giggles]

476
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,916
[NARRATOR] Unbeknownst
to his friends and family,

477
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,208
Goku races around the globe

478
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:30,416
gathering a team of warriors
to keep them safe

479
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,000
and protect the universe
from potential doom.

480
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,250
Thirty-nine hours
remain until the start

481
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:44,583
of the Tournament of Power,
which will determine

482
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,875
the fate of
the Seventh Universe.

483
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:50,833
Will Goku be able to assemble
his ten champions by then?

484
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:55,125
Find out next time
on Dragon Ball Super.

485
00:21:57,375 --> 00:22:00,208
<i>An angel and a demon sit</i>

486
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:03,333
<i>One to my right,</i>
<i>one to my left</i>

487
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:09,416
<i>In between I'm tryin'</i>
<i>to figure out the right way</i>

488
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,333
<i>Is one way good?</i>
<i>Is one way bad?</i>

489
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:15,500
<i>Too much confusion in my head</i>

490
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:20,875
<i>I can't think with all</i>
<i>this noise, I'm goin' crazy</i>

491
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:24,916
<i>Is there any way to know</i>
<i>what's right or wrong?</i>

492
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:29,791
<i>Demons in an angel mask</i>

493
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:32,958
<i>Hopin' that I'll do</i>
<i>just what they ask</i>

494
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:36,041
<i>Telling me</i>
<i>they know what's right</i>

495
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:39,000
<i>Lead me to the light</i>

<i>"For the sake of everyone</i>

<i>You have to destroy</i>

498
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:47,958
<i>That's the only path, you see"</i>

499
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:51,583
<i>So they said to me</i>

500
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:02,000
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

501
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:03,875
I stopped by Krillin's place,
but it looks like

502
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:05,625
he's been off
training in secret.

503
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:07,583
[GOHAN] Krillin's just
full of surprises,

504
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:09,625
including some
awesome new moves.

505
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:11,625
[GOKU] In that case,
let's mix it up a little bit

506
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:14,500
before the tournament and
see how strong he really is.

507
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:17,916
Time for a full-power
contest, Krillin!

508
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,291
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

509
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:24,208
"Goku the Talent Scout.
Recruit Krillin and Android 18."

510
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:26,250
Make sure you don't
miss it, okay?
