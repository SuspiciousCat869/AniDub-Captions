00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,833
I don't care if he
is a Destroyer, Goku,

161
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:23,041
you cannot let my brother
hit one off you!

162
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:24,958
Throw that ball
at maximum power!

163
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,458
[GOKU]
Maximum? Are you sure?

164
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,041
Do I look unsure?

165
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,500
All right, Beerus,
you're the boss.

Ha! You don't scare me.

00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:37,958
Do not disappoint me!

169
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,375
Why don't you take the screaming
down a notch, Lord Beerus?

170
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,416
It's a friendly game.
It's just for fun.

171
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,750
A battle is a battle,
and I'll win no matter what!

Uuuh...

177

And that is Strike One!

178
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:18,291
[CHAMPA growls]
Come on, you call that a strike?

179
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,708
What was left of it
went right down the middle.

180
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:24,375
I've heard of a breaking ball,
but that ball broke apart.

181

[YAMCHA]
Ow! Ow, ow! Ow! Aah!

182
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,041
Man! I'm all for Goku
bringing some heat,

183
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,416
but that was like,
thermonuclear!

184
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,083
Uh. I guess I'm out of
practice putting my guard up.

185
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,708
That impact
nearly obliterated me!

186
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,458
Let's give it another shot, huh?

187
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:42,875
You must be tougher
than you look, Earth boy.

188
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,041
--All right!
--Here we go!

189
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,875
[laughs]
Baseball is awesome!

190
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,041
Goku, this is meant
to be a goodwill game,

191
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:53,458
and I specifically
warned you that

192
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,583
all acts of destruction
were thus forbidden.

193
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,791
Annihilate anything else
and I'll have no choice

194
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,333
but to eject you from the game.

195
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,000
Aw, that's no fun!

196
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,875
Well, we can't have that!
I'm changing my pitcher!

197
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,500
Hit the showers, Goku!

198
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,333
I'm afraid that's
not allowed, my lord.

199
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,833
What are you talking about?

200
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,250
Barring injury, the starting
pitcher cannot be changed

201
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,750
until he has finished pitching
to at least one batter.

[BEERUS growls]

203
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:18,166
Fine, from now on
throw it softly, Goku.

204
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,458
You understand me?

205
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:22,416
Uh. Yeah, sure,
whatever you say.

206
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,666
All righty, nice and soft.

He definitely hit that.

00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,375
Don't worry about it, Dad.
It's a foul ball.

225
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,291
[GOKU] How's it foul?
Does it smell bad?

226
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:28,666
That means it's Strike Two.

Seriously? That's dumb.

[BEERUS]
You got lucky, Goku!

229

Now throw it harder
and strike him out!

[GOKU]
Uuuh. Now harder?

231
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,666
I feel like I'm getting
some mixed signals here.

232
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:43,750
Okay, I'll split the difference
and throw it just right!

Yeah! Now that's
an explosive defense!

No, no, no, no, no!

That must be against the rules!

250
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,041
One would assume so,
my lord, but unfortunately

251
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,958
the rule book says nothing about
affecting the ball with energy.

252
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,458
That's quite an oversight.

253
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:32,958
This is ridiculous!

00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,458
In your face!
[laughing]

255
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,875
Of course you'd rub it in,
you smug braggart!

Du-dee, du-dee, doo!

I'm not really sure
what happened with that,

259
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,583
but apparently it was good?

260
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,125
[YAMCHA] Technically. But if
Trunks hadn't stepped in,

261
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,583
that would've been a home run.

262
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,583
So why don't you let me
handle the pitching from here?

263
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,416
Let the Yamcha show you
what it's like

264
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,000
to dominate on the mound.
[chuckles]

265
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,750
My turn!

266
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,916
I'll rip that ball to shreds!

Watch and learn.

This is how it's done.

my Wolf Fang Fist

You just have to take out

Oh, good point. Leave it to

[WHIS] You're clearly missing
the objective, Vegeta.

Next time you hit a batter,

That's enough, my lord.

Have you forgotten it's
one of the greatest taboos

478
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:43,000
of the cosmos for Destroyers
to fight each other?

Are you trying to obliterate

that acts of destruction

you're in gross violation

Hey, the way he's lying in that
crater kinda rings a bell.

Yeah, a very painful bell.
