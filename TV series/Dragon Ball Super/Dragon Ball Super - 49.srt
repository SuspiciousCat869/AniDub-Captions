Change the right civilization,

159
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,916
and a planet could be
wiped off the map.

160
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,791
I get that, but what if
you're trying to save a planet?

161
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,375
[WHIS]
Motives don't matter.

162
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,708
The repercussions are too great,
which is why even most deities

163
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:15,000
are not allowed to move
unfettered through time.

164
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,458
Much less mortals.

165
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:17,791
Hold on, deities?

166
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:18,958
Yeah, you heard 'em right.

167
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,458
That one dude's
called a Destroyer god!

168
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,666
And maybe destruction
is needed here.

169
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,125
Call it "damage control."

170
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,625
What kind of destruction?

171
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,875
Wait, you can't
punish him for this!

172
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,375
I'm the one who invented
the machine, not him!

173

But future me, not now me.

[FUTURE TRUNKS]
Uh.

00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:48,166
Believe it or not, the kitty
cat is a Destroyer god.

181
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,958
I am merely Lord Beerus'
faithful attendant.

182

[FUTURE TRUNKS]
Seriously? Huh.

183
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,500
I thought you were the god
and he was the pet.

[BULMA giggles]

185

[FUTURE TRUNKS] I mean, sorry!
You're very godly!

186

Lord, please, if you have
to judge someone for this,

187
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,750
spare my mother and judge me!

188
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,500
Hey! Go easy on him,
Lord Beerus.

189
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:06,666
He's a good fighter!

00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,541
And no one told him
it was wrong.

This is a tough one, my lord.
How will you handle it?

Hmm. Let me see. Am I

I've never tasted
and I'll let you off

I have just the thing.
Ever had fish sausage?

200
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,500
Obscenely questionable.

Mm!

It's delicious!

Like a mouthful of paradise!

205
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,416
Was the fate of our planet
just decided by sausage?

206

Those musta' been
some good weenies!

Shou, give me yours!

210
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,250
[KRILLIN]
I'm having flashbacks.

211
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,916
It's like the old days when
we were training with Roshi.

212
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,375
Hey, that's what
Goku said to rope me in.

213
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:05,416
Well, you gotta admit
we worked up a sweat.

214
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,750
[PICCOLO]
That we did.

215
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:10,708
[CHICHI] Guys, there's trouble!
It's an emergency!

216
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:12,916
--Great, now what?
--You sense something?

217
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,125
I've been too busy with lettuce.

218
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,125
A time machine just showed up!

219
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,000
Time machine--
what are you talking about?

220
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,833
Going by the odds,
I would guess Trunks.

221
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:25,375
That's right. He popped up
at Capsule Corp.

222
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,666
and everyone's trying to
figure out what's going on!

223
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,083
We heard it was a big enough
deal that Dad and Vegeta

224
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,166
came back from training
so they could help!

225
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,666
Something bad
could have happened again

226
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,291
in Trunks' future.

227
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,416
Well, I guess
break time is over.

Yeah. Hmm.

have the perfect reason.

save that coin I dropped.

[MAI] Does that mean
big Trunks is stuck here?

he has dogs to feed?

what it uses for power!

Couldn't future me include some
kind of instruction manual?

It's in my own handwriting.

So, what kind of trouble
are we talking about?

Don't tell me. Is it Majin Buu?

dealt with that threat.

at you earlier, Goku.

But what I'm trying
to tell you is,

285
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,291
well, there was
a reason I attacked.

my escape through time

had failed and
I was still seeing him.

Uh. Still seeing who?

Spit it out. Who was it?

292
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:47,875
This foe. He told us
that he was Goku.

Yeah. I'm afraid so.

Well, isn't that
a slap in the face!

299
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,416
Except he wears
dark clothes instead of

300
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,500
your orange ones, so we started
calling him Goku Black.

00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,291
[GOKU] That makes him
sound really cool!

So he's cooler than me?

Please! Goku Black?
You couldn't be more creative?

Yeah, I guess.

the day he showed up.

He looked down on all of us

and said he was going to
exterminate the human race.

<i>Wow</i>

474
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,791
<i>I don't wanna draw the line</i>

475
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:33,458
<i>I gotta see it through some way</i>

476

<i>Fight for what I know is mine</i>

477
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:36,708

[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

487
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:03,791
At least, I think I am.

488
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:06,500
It's hard to know what's
going on with this Goku Black!

489
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:09,250
Who is he, and how'd he
get here from the future?

490
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:11,166
He doesn't have a time machine!

491
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,208
Well, I may not know
all that, but at least

492
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:15,375
I can answer the most
important question:

493
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:16,875
how strong is he?

494
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:19,041
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

495
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:23,000
"Goku vs. Black! A Closed-Off
Road to the Future!"

496
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:25,333
Make sure you don't
miss it, okay?
