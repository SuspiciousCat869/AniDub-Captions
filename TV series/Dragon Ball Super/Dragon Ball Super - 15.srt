We've learned
there's a hero here

who has battled Lord Beerus

that's right, Snacks.

In the custom
of our warriors,

I can't acknowledge him as a
hero until we meet in the ring.

243
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,458
If this man really
bested the Destroyer,

244
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:52,458
it should be easy for him
to prove his strength.

I must apologize,
but it is our tradition.

Galbee is the official hero
of Planet Snack,

so it would be a great honor if
you would join him in combat.

but it would mean a lot.

[GOKU] You're a worldly guy.
You must know things.

that boring stuff,

what do you say you step in
and fight this alien for me?

Uh. That big guy?

319

[MR. SATAN]
Yeah, how 'bout it?

320
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:56,000
A little morning training?

321
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,250
Thanks, that's real nice
of you, but I shouldn't.

322
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,958
I'd feel bad
hogging all the fun.

323

Don't be silly, I don't mind.
I'm a gracious guy!

324
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,625
And I can fight him
myself any time I want!

325
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:10,541
If you're sure it's okay,
I guess I could go a few rounds.

326
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,750
The truth is Chichi isn't
letting me train right now,

327
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,125

like crazy for a fight!

Ah man, thank goodness.

Hey, your name's Galbee, right?

330
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,250
Well you'll have to
fight this man first,

331
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,291
and prove you're worth
my precious time.

332
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,291
You're joking.
You want me to battle

333
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,000
some unproven amateur?

334
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,041
This is an unexpected
development.

335
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,458
I should say so.

336
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:33,208
He looks like a backwoods
commoner to me.

337

I've never been so insulted.

Just you wait, big boy.

It's gonna take my boys
quite a while

Sure it's a lot of cooking,
but I love having Gohan over.

And we have to make sure
Videl's eating healthy

fighting Galbee after all!

the strange visitor's attacks!

His dodging skills
are impressive.

00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,333
[HOST 15A] This is
certainly an unconventional

approach to fighting.

his incredible power
in what I can only assume

Why isn't he fighting back?
