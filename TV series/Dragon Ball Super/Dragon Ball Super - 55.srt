Why did you take his life?

We could have easily returned
without interference.

For all we know,
that individual could have had

a major impact on
the future of the Babari.

and led his people
to true reformation.

robbed them of that.

Yup, that's what I said!
Can you take me, pretty please?

Would you be so kind?

Why in the worlds
would he do that?

Beats me, he didn't say.

To think! Goku laying
eyes on the palace!

But I haven't even been there!

getting through.

I suppose we shouldn't
keep him waiting.

Don't be trifled
for a moment, my friend.

that is the most important

you have, is it not?

Let me show you
the way, gentlemen.

224
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:10,750
That guy may not look like much,

225
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,958
but I get the feeling
he'd be tough in the ring.

226
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,958
Most keenly recognized, Goku.

227
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,833
Many would be deceived
by his appearance,

228
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,416
but when it comes
to fighting prowess,

229
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,000
the Grand Minister is considered
to be in the top five.

230

Among all the universes.

231
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,875
Yeah? That's awesome!

232
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:27,875
Shh! I know your tendencies
quite well, Goku.

233
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,541
But you must not
under any circumstances

234
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,500
ask him to fight,
do you understand?

Aw man, but now I'm all curious!

You'll just have to
take my word for it.

237

Suffice it to say not even <i>I</i>
can hold a candle to him.

314
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,291
You bet, and we're all good!

315
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,375
[sighs]

316
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,416
[GOKU]
I told ya not to worry.

317
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,041
All right, Zenny, I'll see ya!

318
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,666
Okay!

319
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:11,458
You okay, Supreme Kai?
You totally fainted.

320
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,541
[SUPREME KAI]
Yes. I'm fine.

321
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:16,125
[GRAND MINISTER] You have quite
an interesting friend there.

322
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,958
[WHIS]
Indubitably.

323
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,500
I would enjoy seeing him
again myself, if possible.

324
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:23,541
I know he would be
delighted as well.

325
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,416
Until next time.

326
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,250
[SUPREME KAI]
Kai-kai.

327
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:31,708
Whew! That's done.

328
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:32,916
Thank goodness you're all right.

329
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,583
Oh by the way, Goku,

330
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,375
what was that business
about you promising

331
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:39,333
to bring Grand Zeno an even
better companion next time?

332
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:40,958
Who do you have
in mind for that?

333
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,416
Wait, you promised what?

334
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,166
Oh. Right,
the whole friend thing.

335
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,791
I just said that on the fly.

336
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,125
Do you guys know
anyone he'd like?

337
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,875
Are you telling us
you made that promise

338
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,833
with no idea how to fulfill it?

339
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,583
Well duh,
I had to say something.

340
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,750
I thought if I didn't,
he wouldn't let me go home.

341
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,166
[SUPREME KAI]
This is a disaster!

342
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,041
You've raised the hopes
of the Omni-King,

343
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,375
and now if you can't deliver

344
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,375
he'll retaliate
by destroying us all!

345
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:03,625
[laughs]

346
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:06,166
It's fine! I'll think of
something later, okay?

347
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,750
What? You're back already?

348
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,666
Like I said,
you didn't have to worry.

349
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,583
Zenny's a totally awesome dude!

350
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,791
[BEERUS yells]
Did you just say "Zenny"?

351
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,000
Uuuaah!

352
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,375
[GOKU]
Lord Beerus?

353
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,500
You'd better let me
handle this from here.

354
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:26,041
You go on home and tend to that,
uh, "important business."

355
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:27,250
[GOKU laughs]

356
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:30,750
He said Zenny. He said Zenny.

357
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:43,041
[GOWASU] You lack faith
in mortals. Tell me why.

358
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:50,125
This tea is a mirror,
pointed inward.

359
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,583
If the soul of
its maker is clouded,

360
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,708
the tea will be as well.

361
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:57,541
So is it fear
that clouds this cup?

362
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,333
Or bewilderment?

363
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:00,750
Speak.

364
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:03,833
[ZAMASU] Master Gowasu,
you have said something often.

365
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,833
To make mistakes
but learn from them,

366
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,458
thus forging a better world.

367
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:10,166
That is the essence
of a mortal spirit.

368
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,916
[GOWASU]
Mmm.

369
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,291
But as far as I can see,

370
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,750
mortals do not
learn this way at all.

371
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,916
Planet Babari
is no outlier, Master.

372
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,500
You've seen this
countless times before.

373
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:25,916
Patience, Zamasu.
Every seed needs time to grow.

374
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,875
Gardens are tended.
Not just watched.

375
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:31,541
Should a gardener
not pluck the weeds?

376
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:32,833
When I was invited here,

377
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:35,375
I thought you would
teach me divine justice.

378
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,166
But all you seem to do is watch

379
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,000
while these monsters
stain existence

380
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,666
with each other's blood!

381
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,291
[GOWASU]
Hmm.

382
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:50,166
[GOWASU] Zamasu, do you ever
ponder the relationship

383
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,250
between good, evil, and justice?

384
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,458
[ZAMASU]
Yes. All the time.

385
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,666
Evil is the
great obstacle to good.

386
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,291
And justice,
the sword by which good

387
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,791
can overcome
this obstacle and flourish.

388
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,541
[GOWASU]
That is one perspective.

389
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,750
But I have come
to view it this way:

390
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,541
Justice is not a sword
eradicating evil,

391
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:11,291
but a scale keeping good
and evil in balance.

392
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:12,791
Balance, master?

393
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,458
[GOWASU]
One can succumb to evil,

394
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:17,291
but reject that darkness
and rediscover the light

395
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:18,666
with new understanding.

396
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,125
Justice makes
that journey possible.

397
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:22,666
Evil informs good.

398
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:26,291
And that is why we give
the mortals their minds.

399
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,708
[ZAMASU] You give corruption
far too much credit.

400
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,125
Evil does not inform good.

401
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,583
It sullies it.

402
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,083
Like the Babari sullied
their world with violence.

403
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,666
And that arrogant Goku
sullied this sacred ground

404
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,416
by swinging his fists at a god.

405
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,208
Mortals received
the divine gift of intellect--

406
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:51,708
the potential for wisdom--

407
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:55,750
but they misuse it to destroy
the beauty of creation.

408
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:59,625
Mortals do not succumb to evil,
they are the evil.

409
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,125
They create it and spread it

410
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,541
with minds they
shouldn't possess.

411
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:06,625
How can we call ourselves
gods if we watch this blight

412
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,750
and do nothing to stop it?

413
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:16,041
[GOWASU] Zamasu. You have
a strong hunger for justice

414
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:18,125
and that can be a great thing.

415
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,958
But we must put temperance
over righteousness.

416
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,333
And guide lost children
to the good path

417
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,875
at a pace that seems slow
even for us.

418
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,291
Do not forget the true
reason you have honed

419
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,833
your fighting ability
is to strengthen your mind

420
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:33,500
for your journey
toward enlightenment.

421
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:36,500
Being gods does not
make us perfect.

422
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:40,708
We too must learn
and mature over time.

423
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,583
Reflect on our discussion
as you make more tea.

424
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:58,875
Merely watching.
That's a sin, too.

425
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:01,000
Don't you see?

426
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:09,000
[BULMA] Okay guys,
get ready to be impressed!

427

Wow, it looks brand new!

430
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,958
Of course, we're the ones
who polished it!

431
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,791

00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:39,125
<i>Everybody dance</i>

[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

472
00:22:43,916 --> 00:22:46,250
After all these years
hearing about Trunks' future,

473
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:48,083
I finally get to see it myself!

474
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,666
Black continues to terrorize
Earth's survivors,

475
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,291
but they've held on this long
'cause they believe in Trunks,

476
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:56,083
and now Vegeta and I are here
to give them the help they need.

477
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:59,416
But with Black's new power up,
it won't be an easy fight.

478
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,666
[GOKU] Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

479
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:05,875
"Rematch with Goku Black!
Enter Super Saiyan Rosé."

480
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:08,000
Make sure you don't
miss it, okay?
