00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,041
into your own hands.
That was dangerous!

162
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,333
Please. Those jerks
interrupted a young lady's

163
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:54,875
trip to the beauty salon.

164
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:57,125
There's not a jury in the whole
world who would convict me.

165
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,583
Trying to argue with you
is like trying to

166
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,666
fight a dragon with a yo-yo.

167
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,541
You haven't changed
one bit. Here.

168
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,208
And what the hell is this?

169
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,041
[KRILLIN] Ticket for speeding
and reckless driving.

170
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,916
I'll overlook
the unlicensed jet.

171
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,125
Huh?!

172
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,458
--[phone ringing]
--Hey wait a second,

173
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:12,750
--[phone ringing]
--you can't give me a ticket.

174
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm the victim here.
I'm telling you,

175
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,625
I was supposed to
get my bangs cut.

176
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,500
Gohan's calling.

177
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,875
Hello? What?

178
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:23,125
Yeah, okay.
I'll be right there.

179
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,666
[GOHAN]
What do you think?

180
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,708
[MR. SATAN]
Hmmm.

181
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,250
[knock on window]

182
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,166
Let us in, Gohan.
Dad's here too.

183
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,958
[BULMA, GOKU, KRILLIN]
She locked you out?

184
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,541
Yeah. She says it's not
safe to leave Pan with us

185
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,125
until we clean up our act.

186
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,291
Sorry, Gohan.
This is kinda my fault.

187
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:41,541
I got carried away with the
future plans thing, too.

188
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,791
Look. We just have to
hold our ground

189
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,041
until they see things
our way, okay?

190
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,333
[VIDEL]
Uh-huh.

191
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:50,166
Though maybe I'm
speaking out of turn here.

192
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,125
I haven't asked how <i>you</i>
want to raise Pan, have I?

193
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,291
I mean, what kind of future
do you want for her?

194
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,083
Just take your time,
and think about it.

195
00:09:57,166 --> 00:10:00,166
Whatever you choose,
I'll be on your side.

196
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,375
O-kay.

197
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,333
I beg ya, Goku!
Ask Chichi to let us in.

198
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,958
I can't take another
minute without Pan!

199
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,833
Sorry I'm no good talking to
Chichi when she's like this.

200
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,166
I'll just make it worse.

201
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,375
Can you talk to her?

202
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,083
You're a cop. You're
trained for this right?

203
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,375
Ahhh...

204
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:20,125
Hostage situations
aren't exactly my specialty.

205
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,375
Leave it to me you guys.
I'll convince her for you.

206
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:23,583
[ALL gasp]

207
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,458
[BOTH] Oh, thank you,
Bulma. You mean it?

208
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,333
And in return, Krillin's
gonna make that ticket

209
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,583
he gave me
magically disappear.

210
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:30,875
No can do.

211
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,458
I'm dealing with
a crisis you just said

212
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,291
you can't handle,
Mr. Policeman.

213
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,458
So dropping a ticket
is the least you can do!

214
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:37,666
I said I can't!

215
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,833
Fine, be that way! You jerk!

216
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,250
[knock, knock]

217
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,916
Hey, Chichi. It's Bulma.
Can you open the door for me?

218
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,125
[rattling]

219
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:51,208
[rattling, clanging]

220
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:56,333
[ALL]
Uhhh...

221
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,583
[BULMA] I know, right?
The guys don't get it!

222
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:00,458
They think they can do
whatever they want.

223
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:01,833
It drives me up the wall!

224
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:04,041
[CHICHI] I hear you, sister!
You and me both!

225
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,541
I don't know if it's
the way Saiyans did it

226
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:06,958
back on their planet or what,

227
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,291
but when I
gave birth to Trunks,

228
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,166
Vegeta didn't even
bother to show up!

229
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,083
Saiyans are clueless.
They have no idea

230
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,708
how much trouble we go through!

231
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,208
[BULMA]
What do you think, Videl?

232
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,875
I know your daughter's
part Saiyan,

233
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,875
but how do you feel
about her fighting?

234
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,791
It's got to worry you, right?

235
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:24,333
It's hard to say. I grew up
studying martial arts,

236
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,541
and that's partly
what drew me to Gohan.

237
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:27,833
[BOTH]
Mhm, mhmmm.

238
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,916
It was fun for me,
but I also liked books

239
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,916
and dolls and all sorts
of things, too.

240
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,250
When it comes down to it,

241
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,250
I guess I just want her
to have all the options

242
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,625
and grow up to be
whatever she wants.

243
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,333
That sounds
pretty good to me.

244
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:42,791
Chichi, I think Pan
is gonna be just fine.

245
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:46,041
Think of everything Gohan did as
a boy and now he's a scholar!

246
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:49,541
Even Goku's got a regular job.
It all works out.

247
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,000
I think when you
marry a Saiyan,

248
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,458
you have to let life unfold
in a little different way.

249
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,000
Take my husband for instance.

250
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:57,250
He's across the universe
training with that Whis guy

251
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,291
and I haven't seen him
in six whole months!

252
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:04,250
[GOKU]
Vegeta's doing whaaat?!

253
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,458
What do you mean
he's off training with Whis?

254
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:09,541
How did that happen,

255
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,166
and why didn't anybody
tell me, Bulma?

256
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,791
I don't know.
'Cause you never asked,

257
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,291
and it's not a big deal.

258
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,916
Whis is just helping him reach
a new level like you did.

259
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,125
[screams]

260
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,791
He's been off training
this whole time

261
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,666
while I've been out farming?

262
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,166
[KRILLIN]
Wow, this is nuts-o.

263
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,166
I seriously can't believe
Whis was actually

264
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,000
Beerus's teacher all along.

265
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,500
I'm guessing he likes
to keep his cards

266
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:42,833
close to his chest.

267
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,125
It's a common practice
of great martial artists.

268
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,875
And naturally
I had my suspicions.

269
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,750
[KRILLIN]
Uh-huh.

270
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,416
What's the plan, Bulma?

271
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,500
You're friends with Whis,

272
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,958
so when's he coming
back to Earth?

273
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:55,000
I gotta make sure I talk to him
the next time he's here

274
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,916
so I can convince him
to train me too.

275
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,666
He was here pretty recently
so I think it'll be a while.

276
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,833
Based on his usual pattern,
I would say it's gonna be

277
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:03,708
about a month, or maybe two.

278
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,791
Are you kidding me?
I can't wait that long!

279
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,333
Isn't there some way
you can call him

280
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:08,708
and tell him to come?!

281
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:11,458
Stop it, Goku! You're
acting like a crazy person!

282
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,458
Busting through walls
at your son's house

283
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:14,916
where your
granddaughter's sleeping

284
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,625
'cause somebody
mentions training?

285
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,958
No! I won't allow it!

286
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,875
[whimpers]

287
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:25,083
[grunts] Oh, why am I even
trying? You're hopeless!

288
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,541
[whispers]
Goku. Wait.

289
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:27,958
If Vegeta's on Beerus's world,

290
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,833
then can't you just
search for his energy?

291
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:31,125
Once you lock onto his power,

292
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,500
you can use your Instant
Transmission, right?

293
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:36,125
[whispers] Oh yeah,
I didn't think of that!

294
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,291
[whispers] It's no use.
I can't sense his energy.

295
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,083
I think he's too far away.

296
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,833
Guess all I can
do now is wait.

297
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,875
Is Whis here?

298
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,791
[BULMA]
No! Not yet!

Don't scare me like that!

302
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,875
So how 'bout now?

00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,875
[BULMA grunts]

304

[BULMA]
Here, take this.

307
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,458
When Whis shows up,
I'll call you, got it?

308
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,166
I came all the way here
to give you that,

309
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,750
so thank me and promise
you'll stop bugging me!

310
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,500
Are you sure you won't
forget to call me?

311

[BULMA]
Yes, I'm sure!

giving Goku a phone?

Uh, it's for Pan, actually.

316
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,041
Bulma wants to throw a giant
surprise party for her

317
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,041
without Gohan
or Videl finding out.

318
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,916
Yeah. And this is
to help us plan it!

319
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
[CHICHI]
Hmmm...

320
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,375
Oh, that's great!

321
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:49,125
So you're finally taking
your grandpa job seriously!

322
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,541
[GOKU]
Uh, yes, exactly!

323
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,541
That's right,
he's a changed man!

324
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:53,541
[chuckles]

325
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:54,625
[whispers]
You've had all this time

326
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,000
and you still
haven't talked to her

327
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,583
about training there yet?

328
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,750
I tried.
[chuckles nervously]

329
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,000
Still no call.

330
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,458
Is this thing broken?

331
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,416
--[door knob clicks]
--[GOHAN] I'm back!

332
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,041
Here you go, Mom. I got
everything on your list.

333
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:14,125
[CHICHI]
Wonderful, thank you!

334
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:17,583
Hey, Goku!
Look who stopped by!

335
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:18,875
Uh, Dad?

336
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,833
[gasps]

337
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:28,000
Is something wrong with Dad?
He's sure acting funny.

338
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,166
[laughs]

339
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,166
Nice try, but you won't
get me to talk!

340
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,083
Let's just say
fun is on the horizon!

341
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,625
Goku's being
such a great grandpa.

342
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:38,250
[GOHAN] Now I'm
definitely suspicious.

343
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,250
Still no call. Huh.

344
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,666
[GOHAN]
Hm?

345
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,375
[phone rings]

346
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,333
[GOKU]
It's her! Bulma?

347
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:48,458
[gasps]

348
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,833
[GOKU] Yeah! Of course!
I'll be there!

349
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,708
Finally!

350
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:56,833
Don't tell me--

351
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,791
You're definitely
gonna love today's menu!

352
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,791
[GOKU]
Hey, Whis! Whis!

353
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,666
Whis!

354
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,791
Hi there!

355
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,916
Greetings, Goku.
What a surprise.

356
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,333
Long time no see.

357
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:20,166
Oh man, I knew it!

358
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,416
I heard a rumor
that Vegeta's been

359
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,208
training on your world,
is that true?

360
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:24,958
--[WHIS] Hm?
--[BULMA] Mm-mmm!

361
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,375
That's correct. The Saiyan
prince introduced me

362
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,458
to an unbelievably
delicious cuisine,

363
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:30,916
so I practically had no choice.

364
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,208
That's great!
While you're at it,

365
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,458
would you mind training me too?

366
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:34,916
[sighs]

367
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,416
I want to become as
powerful as Lord Beerus.

368
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,875
It's all I can think about!

369
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,916
I beg you,
I'll do whatever it takes!

370
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,958
Please be my teacher!

371
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,166
Sorry.

372
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,916
I don't see why not.

373
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,916
--[GOKU exclaims]
--[GOHAN gasps]

374
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,833
--Wow, you mean it?
--Of course.

375
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,208
I have been thinking
this was about

376
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:56,958
the right time to do it, anyway.

377
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,375
Hold on, what was that?

378
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,041
So this isn't a joke,
you'll train me?

379
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,208
I will.

380
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:02,458
All right, let's go.

381
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:03,833
I don't want to waste
any more time!

382
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:06,500
Sorry, Goku, I'm afraid
you have to wait.

383
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,416
You don't expect me
to cancel my lunch plans

384
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,875
with Bulma, do you?

385
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,041
That is the whole reason

386
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,833
I made this journey
to Earth, after all.

387
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,833
Oh yeah, sorry.
I just got excited.

388
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,708
You guys have a great lunch
and enjoy yourselves,

389
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,458
and I'll wait right here
'til you get back.

390
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:20,250
Take all the time you need!

391
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:21,750
How generous of him.

392
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,583
Yeah. Let's go eat!

393
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:24,875
What did you mean
when you said

394
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,500
it's about the right time?

395
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,458
I don't know, Bulma.
Did I say that?

396
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:29,791
I can't remember.

397
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,083
I can't believe
this is happening.

398
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:32,500
I get to train on his world!

399
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,541
This is gonna be so awesome!

400
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,791
[sighs]
This is gonna be so awful!

401
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:40,583
When Mom hears, she's
gonna totally flip out!

402
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:45,083
Ooooh!
What a wondrous custom!

403
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:48,000
So you dip the meat in the
water and cook it yourself?

404
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,125
An interactive
dining experience!

405
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,208
I can't wait to hear sizzles!

406
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,750
Are you guys done yet?

407
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:57,583
Eh, no, Goku.
We haven't started yet.

408
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:02,500
Oh, right. Sorry,
just take your time.

409
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:05,416
He is quite the
impatient one, isn't he?

410
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,416
Anyway, back to the fun!

411
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,625
Look, Bulma! Here I go!

412
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,125
So... now are you done?

413
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:14,833
Eh. No, as I said,
we're only starting.

414
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:17,041
Oh, right. Heh. Sorry!

415
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,541
You know, if you wanna save
time you can eat it raw!

416
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,416
[chuckles nervously]

417
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,208
[WHIS] Look, it's changing
color! How delightful!

418
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:26,833
Now are you done yet?

419
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,583
Goku, please.

420
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,208
If you continue with
these interruptions,

421
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:31,750
I won't actually
have a chance to eat,

422
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,500
and you'll have
to wait even longer!

423
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:34,875
[GOKU] Sorry,
I just want to start!

424
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,083
Can you get it to go?

425
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,250
Goku, he offered to help

426
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,333
and all you're doing now
is pestering him!

427
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:42,166
Be careful or he might decide
not to train you after all!

428
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,708
[gasps]

429
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:45,958
[laughs nervously]

430
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,708
My mistake.
Just take your time!

431
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:50,333
I'll be over there,
waiting patiently.

432
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,708
[GOKU chuckles]

433
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:57,333
[WHIS exhales]
He's like a gnat.

434
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:00,625
It's absolutely fantastic!

435
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,291
Elegant in its
simple preparation,

436
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,833
allowing the quality of the
ingredients to truly shine.

437
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:07,291
Okay, you're done,
so we can go, right?

438
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,916
Goku. Your complete
inability to sit still

439
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,083
is a most troubling sign.
If this is how you'll

440
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,625
be training, I don't
believe I can teach you.

441
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,000
Aw come on,
that's not fair!

442
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,416
You said you'd teach me!
You can't take it back now!

443
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,291
I can do as I please, Goku.

444
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,041
[CHICHI]
Nobody move!

445
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,833
[GOKU]
Huh?!

446
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,541
It's Chichi! Oh crap!

447
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,583
[CHICHI]
Goku!

448
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,666
Sorry, Dad,
but I had to tell her.

449
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,000
For my own safety.

450
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,416
What is this
about training?

451
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,083
You know how I feel
about this. You can't go!

452
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,708
Tell him, Bulma. He's
too busy being a grandpa!

453
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,458
--[BULMA chuckles nervously]
--[CHICHI] Hey!

454
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,125
Look, Chichi.
It's not a big deal,

455
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,958
I'm not talking about
a long time.

456
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,291
Just a little training.

457
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,125
That's all I need,
a little eency bit!

458
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,083
Do you think
I was born yesterday?

459
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:52,541
That's what you always tell me

460
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,250
but I'm not falling
for it this time!

461
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,833
Come on, Mom, it's okay.
Why don't you let him go?

462
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:59,541
It's gotta be important
if Dad wants it this bad.

463
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,833
Hush, Goten,
Mom and Dad are talking!

464
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:03,083
[GOTEN]
Okay.

465
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,291
Don't get angry, Mom,
but I think you should

466
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,500
let him go, too. We saw
how strong Beerus is

467
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,291
and how close he came
to blowing up the earth,

468
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,291
and we couldn't
do anything to stop him.

469
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,291
If there's ever trouble,
I'll always try to help.

470
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,458
But we know Dad's our
best shot at keeping us safe,

471
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,833
and if he can get stronger,
that's better for all of us!

472
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,833
I said no and I
meant no, Gohan!

473
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,375
I want Pan to have a granddad
who sets a good example

474
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:22,958
so she can have
a nice, normal life

475
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:24,916
and not run around
battling monsters!

476
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,458
Just a bit of training!
Just a teeny tiny little bit!

477
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,583
It appears this dispute
could take a while.

478
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,000
I think I should go, Bulma.

479
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,708
Thank you for
the meal as always.

480
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,833
Uh, you're leaving now?

481
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,416
Look Chichi, I'm sorry!

482
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,208
I tried to do it your way,
but I just can't manage it.

483
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:42,875
I need to train
and get stronger.

484
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:46,166
It's too important
to pass up! Bye!

485
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,458
Wait!

486
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:51,083
Oh my!

487
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,625
Hey, it's Goku!

488
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:57,000
Goku! Goku!

489
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:00,791
[CHICHI sighs]

490
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:04,083
I almost thought
he'd changed this time.

491
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,416
But that's Goku for you.

492
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,416
I guess I can't really
be surprised.

493
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,291
He'll come back eventually,
when he's hungry,

494
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:10,875
then we'll start it all again!

495
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:12,041
[GOHAN]
Huh?

496
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:13,708
[CHICHI] So Bulma,
on to important things--

497
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,625
when are you having
that big party?

498
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:19,541
Huh? Who me?
Might as well, I guess.

499
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:23,250
Yeah! We'll make it
even bigger than the last!

500
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,625
That was a rash move.

501
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:26,833
[chuckles]

502
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,791
Are you sure you want
to leave like that?

503
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,666
I would hate to be
called a home-wrecker.

504
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,625
Nah. Chichi may get mad,

505
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,208
but she understands me
more than anybody.

506
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,333
And do we get to have
a bingo tournament, too?

507
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:38,500
Oh, you know it!

508
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,000
I won't have time
to get the Dragon Balls,

509
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:43,291
but I'll make sure to load up
with really cool prizes!

510
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,166
[GOHAN] Well, Dad,
looks like you don't have to

511
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,416
worry about Mom after all.

512
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,375
You're free to
train your heart out.

513
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,041
[CHICHI] I've got to go
shopping right now!

514
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,958
I've always wanted
to put a baby girl

515
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:54,458
in a cute little party dress!

516
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,666
Mom, you really are amazing.

517
00:21:57,666 --> 00:22:00,958
<i>I look back</i>
<i>to when I was young</i>


518
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:04,083
<i>Reminisce on all that I've done</i>


519
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:06,458
<i>In my hands, I held</i>


520
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:11,208
<i>The dreams of my childhood,</i>
<i>that now've come to pass</i>


521
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:14,750
<i>So let's ride upon</i>
<i>the wind and journey to</i>


522
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,375
<i>A world we've never known</i>


523
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:23,000
<i>(It's a brand new story)</i>
<i>Now, a new chapter starts</i>


524
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,375
<i>Shining Star</i>


525
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:27,208
<i>In the night be</i>
<i>my compass and guide</i>


526
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:30,458
<i>Take me to where I belong</i>


527
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:33,625
<i>The warmth we once shared</i>
<i>Will always be there</i>


528
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:36,250
<i>Its magic lives on in our hearts</i>


529
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:37,416
<i>Shining Star</i>


530
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,208
<i>Give me strength</i>
<i>from your light up above</i>


531
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:43,208
<i>Show me the way to be brave</i>


532
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:49,458
<i>My hands still hold onto hope</i>
<i>that together we'll manifest</i>


533
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:54,333
<i>All that we dreamed of</i>


534
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:01,416
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

535
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,083
Vegeta's definitely stronger
from his time with Whis.

536
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:05,625
I barely recognize the guy!

537
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:07,500
And here's a challenge
I've never faced:

538
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:09,541
making a deity's bed!

539
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:11,625
Trouble is brewing
in space, but for now,

540
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:14,166
Vegeta and I are focused on
some pretty strange training.

541
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,083
But hey, I'm willing
to do anything

542
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:18,125
if it gets me to a new level.

543
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:20,500
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

544
00:23:20,583 --> 00:23:21,750
"I'm Here, Too!

545
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:24,083
Training Commences
on Beerus' World!"

546
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:27,083
And we've got new characters
you won't want to miss!
