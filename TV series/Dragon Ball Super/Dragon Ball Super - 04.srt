silly island, Emperor?

160
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,208
[PILAF] Listen,
you insolent servants.

161
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:38,333
If the map says treasure,
there's treasure, okay?

162
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:41,208
It can't be wrong!
It cost me fifty Zeni!

163
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,958
Well maybe next time
you shouldn't believe

164
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,833
a cheap little map!

165
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:46,291
Just like you shouldn't
believe that a cheap

166
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:47,916
motor boat
would work, either!

167
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,708
Now the engine's totally
shot and it's leaking

168
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,458
from at least thirteen places!

169
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,500
How are we supposed to
get back to civilization

170
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,125
in that piece of junk?

171
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:58,583
On the bright side, at least
I've already dug a grave.

172
00:09:58,666 --> 00:09:59,958
[PILAF grunts]

173
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,083
Enough talking back!
We won't stop until we find it,

174
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,666
even if it takes us
the rest of our lives!

[PILAF'S stomach grumbles]

179
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,708
[PILAF] My stomach sounds
like some jungle beast!

180
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,333
All I want
is some food. But no!

181
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,500
I can't even
catch a measly guppy!

182
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,541
Aaah! Even the fishies in
the ocean are disrespecting

183
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,416
the glorious Emperor Pilaf!

Oh.

[PILAF]
Huh. Uuh!

[TRUNKS]
Amazing, right?

191
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,875
My mom tracked 'em
all down, just for today!

192
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:01,250
[PILAF] All seven Dragon Balls,
all in one place!

193
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,375
And that place
is moving this way!

194
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,666
[fog horn blows]

195
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:10,708
But what are the chances
of that? Can this be?

196
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:14,708
Can this be?!

197
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:17,083
Daaah!

198
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,875
[chuckles]

199
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:23,833
Finally, the great wheel of
fortune is turning our way!

200
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,083
Sire, look!

201
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,875
Your line is moving--
you caught something!

202
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,833
What?

203
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,666
Gotcha! Ah, ahh-uh.

204
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,750
The Dragon Radar!

205
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,250
No, we need that! Come back!

206
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,500
[SHOU, MAI] We need
that food a whole lot more!

[PILAF grunts]

208
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,458
Oh, that's it. We're dead.

209
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:42,791
Oh well! We don't need
some rinky-dink fish now anyway!

210
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,000
The real feast is coming!

211
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,375
Because your genius
Emperor just found

212
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,208
all seven Dragon Balls!

213

216

[TRUNKS] Better put 'em back
before my mom catches us.

[PILAF laughs intensely]

218

Bet you won't doubt me now!

00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,125
[SHOU, MAI]
Hmm!

220
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,291
You do realize there's
nothing on the screen, right?

221
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,000
You haven't eaten
for so long, sire.

222
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,541
I think your head might be
workin' a little bit funny.

223
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:27,791
Hm?
[yells]

224
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,291
Lose your mind
all you want,

225
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,208
but did you have to
lose the fish, too?

226
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:34,750
I saw it! I'm not delusional,
it was there!

227
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,125
Well sire, if you're
sure about your sanity,

228
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:39,666
then maybe the radar broke
when it went underwater.

229
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,875
[PILAF]
This is waterproof!

230
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:48,625
I know I saw 'em!
Who's messing with me?!

231
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,000
[SHOU, MAI]
This is how we row the boat!

Sir, I'm too hungry to row!

Yeah, I'm starving!

Buck up, soldiers!
We're almost there.

[fog horn blows]

239
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,291
[MAI] Emperor Pilaf!
The boat's filling up!

240
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,833
Just keep rowing!
Go, go, go!

241
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,208

This is how we row the boat!

00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:39,958
Seriously, sire. I'm sorry,
but we're all rowed out!

247
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,791
Aw, come on, guys.
We're almost there.

248
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,666
But my arms
feel like noodles!

249
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,166
Don't cry, it's okay.

250
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,125
What about
any of this is okay?

251
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,416
Not you too, Shou!

252
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,375
Once we get the Dragon Balls
we can do and eat

253
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,791
whatever we want, you just
gotta think big picture!

254
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,458
Picture? You're the
only one who saw anything!

255
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,500
Are you sure it was
all seven Dragon Balls

256
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:01,791
and we won't just row around for
no reason until we're fish food?

doing down there?

for Dragon--uh.

Uh, hunting Dragon Fish--
you know, the fish?

281
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:16,333
But don't you need
nets or fishing poles?

we fish by hand!

Not so fast, you two!

but just try to listen
like a grown-up.

368

It's Lord Beerus
and he's not a human

00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,083
or anything close
to that, he's a deity.

On the same level as
Supreme Kai, roughly speaking,

heading here now.

Okay, cool. But deities
are good, right?

Why are you worried?

374
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:42,000
Because Lord Beerus is a
very different sort of deity.

00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,791
He's moody, unpredictable,
and very scary.

Well what does he do
that's so scary?

377
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,375
He's called a Destroyer

destroy stuff, which he does
on the slightest of whims.

If you do anything
he doesn't like,

is that Beerus is dangerous
