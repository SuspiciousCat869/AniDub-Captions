00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,750
I never thought
this day would come!

156
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,708
In that case, I'll give you
your medal now.

157
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:53,666
You've truly earned
this one, Dr. Norimaki.

158
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,875
Thanks!

159

Dr. Mashirito!

164
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:05,875
As this generation's
greatest scientific mind,

165
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,416
not to mention Norimaki's
most well-known rival,

166
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,375
imagine my surprise
when I failed to receive

167
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:13,083
even an invitation
to this silly gala!

168
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,750
Wait just a minute!

169
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,375
Ah, I knew it! See!

170
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,791
In the original Dr. Slump
comics, you died!

171
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,000
So how the heck can you
be standing here now?

172
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:25,041
--[MASHIRITO grunts]
--Eh?

173
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:29,291
I was so upset about
being snubbed I escaped

00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,541
from the Home For Infinite
Losers just to get my vengence!

175

[SENBEI]
Aaah!

176
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,916
Well, that's an unscientific
thing for a scientist to do!

177
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Have you no respect
for the laws of nature?

178

Gatchans, too, huh?

182
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:50,791
Yup, that's right!

183

[GATCHANS]
Cupi-pee!

184
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,041
[MASHIRITO] You left them
all alone at your place,

185
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,958
so I mixed some of this
in with their food.

186
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,416
I call this elixir "Playtime-X"!

187
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,583
It's a tonic that takes
a child's desire to play

188
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,375
and multiplies it a hundredfold!

189

[ALL]
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

190
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,333
All right,
Arale and you Gatchans,

191
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,333
go ahead and cavort
with everyone here!

192
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,083
Cavort to your hearts' content!

193
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,625
I can't abide anyone
who would dare to ignore me!

194

Oh, this could get ugly!

Hey. I'm the star of this show

198
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:24,000
and now they're trying
to upstage me!

Wait, brainstorm coming.

200
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,041
If I were to buddy up with those
spotlight-stealing runts,

201
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:31,000
then maybe...
[chuckles]

Hey there, little ones!

How'd you like to play
with me, famous Mr. Satan?

204
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,666
[ARALE, GATCHANS]
Oh wow, really?

205
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,000
Yes, really, I promise!

206
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,333
Right now we're
in the middle of a

we can play tag.

You guys got a smarty-pants
explanation for that?

472
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,833
Too many exotic cuisines
from around the world

473
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,458
mixed together, causing a
chemical reaction, perhaps?

474
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:48,041
Is it possible the flavor
was so intense not even

475

a god's stomach
could tolerate it?

[BULMA, SENBEI]
Hmm.

477
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,375
Or maybe it's 'cause
nobody bothered to clean

finished making a poop.

Really? Are you sure?

be more careful in the future.
