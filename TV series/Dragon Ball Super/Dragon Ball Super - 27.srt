In the sky, let's paint a door for tomorrow

[NARRATOR] Previously,
on Dragon Ball Super,

17
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:41,280
the titanic battle between
the resurrected Frieza and Goku

18
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,920
began with each more
powerful than ever before!

19
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,660
But Frieza's new Golden form
proved even stronger

20
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,400
than Goku expected,
overwhelming the Saiyan hero.

21
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:00,400
[FRIEZA] I'm ready
to claim my victory. Die!

22
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,480
[NARRATOR] However,
the resurrected Emperor's

23
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:15,320
lust for revenge blinded him to
his Golden form's fatal flaw:

24
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,590
it uses a tremendous
amount of power!

25
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,960
Goku exposed
Frieza's weakness,

26
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:24,890
and it seemed the old
arch rival had lost once more!

27
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,530
Until...

[FRIEZA] You're too strong
for your own good,

31
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,810
it's made you overconfident.

32
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,740
A fearless fool who
insists on second chances

33
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,680
and habitually lowers
his guard. When powered up

34
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,810
you're one of the strongest
mortals in the cosmos,

35
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,850
yet you've allowed yourself
be felled by a common ray gun.

36
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:51,650
How pitiful does that
make you feel, Goku?

with bated breath,
because they've just seen

41

the shocking climax
in my theater of revenge!

[wails]

43
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,170
[FRIEZA] And with a final bang,
the drama ends!

44
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,310
Down comes the curtain.

45

[FRIEZA]
Huh?

46

Wait. You forgot
I'm in this show, too.

47
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,170
[VEGETA] Sorry, Frieza.
I can't let you kill Kakarot.

48
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:48,180
As annoying as he may be,
I need to him in my life

49
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:51,680
so I have someone who's always
pushing me to get stronger.

You're a coward.

from now on and let me fight!

Sure. Knock yourself out!

[FRIEZA] Honestly, Vegeta.
You're as arrogant as ever

73
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,670
if you think you can stop me
from getting my revenge.

74

Any swing you take
at me will surely miss.

the job to serve me?

90

Wait, what?
So Vegeta has figured out

91

how to reach the power level of

92
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,680
a Super Saiyan God
on his own, too?

93
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,750
Yeah. And unlike me,
Vegeta didn't have the benefit

94
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,360
of absorbing the energy
from the Saiyan ritual.

95

all out from scratch.

00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:44,210
Hold on, a do-over?
Just what do you mean by that?

162
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,250
I remember you saying it
once before, but...

163
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:54,020
Ah... ah... ah.. achoo!

164
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,930
[GOKU]
Whoa, talk about a sneeze!

165
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,030
Good thing it missed us,

166
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,800
I definitely
wasn't ready for that!

167
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:06,430
It's just a moon this time,
so we won't need a do-over.

168
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:09,300
I possess the ability
to turn back time.

169
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,240
Occasionally I must use it,
like when my lord

170
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,340
accidentally destroys
our system's star.

171
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,740
I manipulate the temporal
dimension a little bit,

172
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,780
then I can go back in time
and bop him on the head

173
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,250
before he has the opportunity
to make his mistake.

174
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,050
One can't properly
enjoy a picnic

175
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,020
without sunshine, after all.

176
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,220
I shouldn't be hearing this.

177
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,360
You're serious, Whis? No catch?

178
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,220
The catch is
you'll have to act fast.

179
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,660
Three minutes back
is all I can manage.

180
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,060
So, are you ready
for your second chance?

181
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,530
Goku. Please.

182
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:44,040
Yeah. All right. Do it, Whis.

183
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,280
Very well then. Let's go.

184
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,180
Oh! I almost forgot
to mention this.

185
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,450
Once I reverse the time
by three minutes,

186
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,480
I'm afraid I won't be able
to use that power again

187
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,590
for quite a while.
So, this time,

188
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,420
you better stop Frieza.

189
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,090
It's the only do-over
you'll get.

190
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,260
Now the pressure's really on!

191
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,920
[gasps]

192
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,620
[BOTH gasp]

193
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,930
[FRIEZA]
How could this happen?

194
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,360
Of all the beings
in the universe,

195
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:02,000
the one who got the better of me
this time was Vegeta?

196
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,540
[bellows]

197
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:09,210
[FRIEZA grunts, yells]

[bellows]

199
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:13,980
At least try to face your death
with some shred of honor.

200
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,380
[yells]

201
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,480
Stop him!

202
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,990
Don't dream of
resurrecting again.

203
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,590
[GOKU yells]

204
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,260
You can all
go to hell without me.

205
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:28,060
--[chuckles]
--Huh?

206
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,300
[GOKU]
Outta the way, Vegeta!

207
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,370
Frieza!

208
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:39,570
[yells]

209
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:47,580
[screams]

210
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:53,090
Damn you, Goku!

211
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,700
Whew! It all worked out!

212
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,470
You self-serving glory hog!

213
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,640
You stole my win!
Have you no shame?

214
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,310
Hey! Would you chill out?

215
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,710
It was the only way
to save Earth.

216
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,050
What's that mean?

217
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,450
Well done, Goku. You made it
with just seconds to spare.

218
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,280
You saved the earth, man!

219
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,290
Nice, Dad!

220
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,190
Everybody's okay thanks to you!

221
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,990
Thanks to Kakarot?
What's going on here?

222
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,430
[JACO] Well, hello, Frieza Force
spaceship. Finders-keepers!

223
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,240
So, wait, wait, wait.

224
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,310
I died, so Kakarot
gets to go back in time

225
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,510
to make me look
like a fool again?

226
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:54,580
Well, Whis I'm not sure
I'll ever live this one down.

227
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,620
What sort of a Destroyer helps
bring a world back to life?

228
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,150
We Earthlings aren't so bad!

229
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:01,420
Think of all the innocent
people you just saved!

230
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,220
Which is why I'll repay you both

231
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,460
with the best feast
you've ever had!

232
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,960
My mouth's
already watering, Bulma!

233

[BULMA chuckles]

234
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,630
Sure you don't want to
arrest 'em, Jaco?

235
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,370
After all, manipulating time is

236
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,270
a serious galactic
offense, right?

237
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,970
If I didn't see it happen,
it didn't happen.

238

[ALL laugh]

239
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,210
All right. Guess I should
go to the Lookout

240
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,080
and pick up Goten and Trunks.

241
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:28,180
Plus, I should probably use
the Namekian Dragon Balls

242
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:32,020
to bring Piccolo back
to life, too. See ya later.

243
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:35,020
Bye, guys. I better
make sure Videl's okay.

00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,020
See ya!

You missed the whole

Earth exploding thing.

250
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,270
Forget it; all that matters
is we're safe now

251
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,310
and I'll make sure
that we stay that way.

as it sounds?

Yeah. I came closer to
losing than I woulda liked!

there to take

everything you had
in that fight.

I have a growing family
that I need to protect

as much as I possibly can.

I understand.
But it won't be easy.

to talk about that.

I'm just curious what you think
about Whis saying

314

that if we'd team up in these
battles then people like Frieza

training together again?

00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,170
No! I would rather
die than do that!

318
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:45,040
[chuckles]
Glad to hear it. Me too.

319
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,410
It's about time
we agree on something.

320
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:50,520
[BOTH chuckle]

321
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:09,370
[cheerful music plays]

322
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,640
[growls]

323
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,510
[music continues]

324
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:18,440
[FRIEZA growls]

325
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,580
[ALL]
Welcome home!

326
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:31,360
No!

327
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,310
Goodbye to our adventure

328
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,820
In twilight we must go our separate ways

329
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:57,350
And try to discover the path to our own destiny

330
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,600
I can't find the words

331
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,130
to tell you how much our parting hurts

332
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,630
I hope you know I'll always love you

333
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:07,580
And all that we shared will be remembered

334
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,890
How could I forget your face?

335
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,790
All my memories erased

336
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,870
I can still hear the melody of your voice

337
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,430
Petals fall in from above

338
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,070
Fade away, all that we love

339
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:28,580
In the twilight,

340
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:28,580
fade away,

341
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,580
fade away

342
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:34,990
Sayonara,

343
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,990
fade away,

344
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,990
fade away

345
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,420
Hey, it's me, Goku!

346
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:43,250
A new God of Destruction
has shown up on the scene

347
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,670
and this one's itching for a fight with Beerus!

348
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:48,050
When you've got two Destroyers
going fist to fist

349
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,720
things can get crazy fast.

350
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,510
He looks a lot like Beerus, too!

351
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:53,310
I mean, with a few dozen extra pounds...

352
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:55,390
Wait, is that Beerus's brother?!

353
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:57,890
And what does the...sixth universe mean?

354
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:00,270
Next time on Dragon Ball Super:

355
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:04,400
The 6th Universe's Destroyer!
His name is Champa!

356
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,150
Make sure you don't miss it, okay?
