Vegeta's been watching.

He must have seen something in
that quick flurry of punches

Jiren unleashed on Goku.
Some kind of small opening

187
00:12:00,418 --> 00:12:02,587
or defensive weak point
he could exploit.

[WHIS] Could Vegeta have another
motive for challenging Jiren?

207
00:12:52,846 --> 00:12:56,516
Perhaps he seeks a catalyst
for unlocking Ultra Instinct.

That would make sense.

00:13:00,854 --> 00:13:05,108
And the way he was dodging--
is he knocking on the door?

Jiren and his squad are
just too much for you!

than that to stop our team.

If the past is prologue,
then that last attack

Ego infects your techniques
and makes them impure.

with these Saiyans and
their bottomless power?

00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,291
Jiren may have thought
that critique

304
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,668
would embarrass Vegeta,

305
00:18:14,751 --> 00:18:17,003
but all it actually did was
remind him of his pride

306
00:18:17,087 --> 00:18:18,546
and awaken even more power.

is very bright!

won't act like a coward,

325
00:19:40,545 --> 00:19:47,844
[laughs]

326
00:19:48,511 --> 00:19:51,014
Ha! Serves you right!

327
00:19:51,097 --> 00:19:54,225
That's what you get for doubting
the greatest in the cosm--

328
00:19:54,309 --> 00:19:55,685
[gasps]

329
00:19:56,561 --> 00:19:58,229
Vegeta!

330
00:19:58,313 --> 00:20:02,150
[gasping]

331
00:20:11,117 --> 00:20:14,788
I commend you for harnessing so
much power in your last attack.

332
00:20:14,871 --> 00:20:16,956
[gasping]

333
00:20:19,793 --> 00:20:22,921
[screams]

334
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:29,052
[screaming continues]

335
00:20:29,135 --> 00:20:30,136
[JIREN grunts]

336
00:20:42,315 --> 00:20:43,858
[BEERUS gasping]

337
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:45,777
[KRILLIN gasping]

338
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,986
Hmph.

339
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,447
It doesn't matter how
high his foe climbs.

340
00:20:49,531 --> 00:20:51,157
He still climbs higher.

341
00:20:51,241 --> 00:20:53,034
[BOTH]
Wow!

342
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:57,122
Vegeta's attack was so amazing,
but it didn't do anything.

343
00:20:57,205 --> 00:20:59,749
Jiren's incredible!

344
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:06,506
Vegeta!

345
00:21:09,384 --> 00:21:12,095
[gasping]

346
00:21:15,306 --> 00:21:16,850
[JIREN grunts]

347
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:21,312
[NARRATOR] Vegeta unloaded his
most ferocious attack yet,

348
00:21:21,396 --> 00:21:24,482
but the mighty Jiren has
still brought him down.

349
00:21:24,566 --> 00:21:27,944
Have we witnessed the final
stand of the Saiyan prince?

350
00:21:28,028 --> 00:21:30,572
And can any combatant
in the Seventh Universe

351
00:21:30,655 --> 00:21:34,659
match the Eleventh's seemingly
invincible champion?

352
00:21:34,743 --> 00:21:36,286
With the clock ticking down,

353
00:21:36,369 --> 00:21:39,122
there is little time to
find a road to victory.

354
00:21:39,205 --> 00:21:41,875
Two universes continue
to fight for survival,

355
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,919
with only eight minutes left
in the Tournament of Power.

356
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:47,589
Next time, on Dragon Ball Super.

357
00:21:48,381 --> 00:21:51,926
<i>Whirling all around</i>
<i>and then back again</i>

358
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:55,847
<i>The song that connects you</i>
<i>to the heavens</i>

359
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:59,392
<i>Strength that goes</i>
<i>beyond all measure</i>

360
00:21:59,476 --> 00:22:02,270
<i>Expanding to a beat</i>
<i>that won't end</i>

361
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:05,982
<i>The meteors fall like rain drops</i>

362
00:22:06,066 --> 00:22:09,736
<i>Astrological tears</i>
<i>from my eyelids</i>

363
00:22:09,819 --> 00:22:15,075
<i>A strong emotion</i>
<i>from deep within</i>

364
00:22:15,158 --> 00:22:17,369
<i>Has been awakened</i>

365
00:22:17,452 --> 00:22:20,997
<i>A spark of possibility</i>

366
00:22:21,081 --> 00:22:24,834
<i>Shines softly like a star</i>
<i>in the night sky</i>

367
00:22:24,918 --> 00:22:29,923
<i>A wish from long</i>
<i>ago now shoots by</i>

368
00:22:30,006 --> 00:22:32,217
<i>And I'm awakened</i>

369
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,970
<i>A never-ending melody,</i>
<i>so enchanting</i>

370
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:39,724
<i>You're always the one</i>
<i>who makes me tremble</i>

371
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:44,020
<i>The meteors keep falling down</i>

372
00:22:44,104 --> 00:22:47,315
<i>Surging right into my heart</i>

373
00:22:51,361 --> 00:22:52,654
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

374
00:22:52,737 --> 00:22:53,905
With Vegeta on the ground,

375
00:22:53,988 --> 00:22:55,657
I've got to try every
trick in my book

376
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,909
to create an opening
in Jiren's defenses,

377
00:22:57,992 --> 00:23:01,162
and let's just say things
could get... explosive.

378
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:02,706
But no matter how hard I fight,

379
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:05,375
it still may not be enough
against this incredible warrior,

380
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:07,210
so you better recover
fast, Vegeta.

381
00:23:07,293 --> 00:23:09,045
Is there anything
else you've got?

382
00:23:09,129 --> 00:23:11,214
Next time, on Dragon Ball Super:

383
00:23:11,297 --> 00:23:14,801
"Body, Soul and Power Unleashed!
Goku and Vegeta!"

384
00:23:14,884 --> 00:23:16,636
Make sure you
don't miss it, okay?
