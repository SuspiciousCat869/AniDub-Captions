Hey, you guys, you okay?

165
00:09:49,204 --> 00:09:49,954
[A18]
Yeah.

166
00:09:50,038 --> 00:09:51,247
[A17]
I guess so.

167
00:09:51,331 --> 00:09:53,625
[GOHAN]
I'm fine, too.

168
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,710
[GOKU] So, do you think
he can sense our energies

169
00:09:55,794 --> 00:09:58,004
at that ridiculous speed?

170
00:09:58,088 --> 00:10:01,174
That's not it.
18 and I are different.

171
00:10:01,257 --> 00:10:03,301
We don't emit that
kind of energy.

My guess is he can send
out ultrasonic waves.

174
00:10:07,681 --> 00:10:10,100
Much like a dolphin or a bat.

well-suited for that.

00:10:13,728 --> 00:10:16,940
He can probably pinpoint
all our positions instantly,

I'm so sorry we've

There's nothing to
apologize for, Doctor.

While the result
is disappointing,

we know you and your colleagues

for joining in the tag-team.

Will the winner be the Seventh
Universe, led by Goku?

Or will it be the Eleventh,
led by the unflappable Jiren?

You're one of the strongest
fighters in the cosmos,

411

but even you are gonna
struggle against Jiren.
