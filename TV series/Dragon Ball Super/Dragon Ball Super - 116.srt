Even with Goku elevated
to Super Saiyan Blue,

32
00:02:12,288 --> 00:02:16,501
the combined power of Caulifla
and Kale seemed to be too much.

Once before in this Tournament,

39
00:02:35,353 --> 00:02:38,773
Goku had achieved an immense
new height of power difficult

40

Be your best ape.

Is that it? Oh, my. Has Goku
really found it again?

56

into the domain of the gods.

I wonder, how will the
mighty Jiren respond?

incredible heat!

It's that same focused glimmer
he had against Jiren.

66
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,923
It's Ultra Instinct, all right.

He couldn't have achieved
this without another catalyst.

00:04:29,592 --> 00:04:31,428
This time it must
have been Kefla.

69
00:04:31,511 --> 00:04:33,763
You mean it was her
enormous energy?

Yes, sir.

71
00:04:35,265 --> 00:04:37,017
The first time that Goku
reached Ultra Instinct it was

72
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,185
the sheer force of his Spirit
Bomb that triggered him,

73
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:41,896
and Kefla's energy is roughly
equivalent to that blast.

[CABBA]
Caulifla! Kale!

320
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:24,177
[CAULIFLA]
Ow...

321
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,514
[BOTH] Wowie! That was
such an amazing fight!

322
00:18:27,597 --> 00:18:30,266
Contestants Kale and Caulifla
of the Sixth Universe,

323
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:33,603
known collectively as Kefla, are
eliminated from the Tournament.

324
00:18:33,687 --> 00:18:36,731
Bye now, Kale and Caulifla.

325
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,069
Supreme Kai Fuwa...
Lord Champa...

326
00:18:41,152 --> 00:18:43,905
I'm sorry. We've failed you.

327
00:18:43,988 --> 00:18:46,157
Hey, Goku! You bastard!

328
00:18:46,241 --> 00:18:49,035
Next time I'll kick
your ass, I swear it!

329
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:51,037
Hey, now! Take it easy!

330
00:18:51,121 --> 00:18:54,249
Fuwa, what to do, what to do?

331
00:18:54,332 --> 00:18:56,918
They couldn't even stop
him with the Potaras!

332
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:59,129
How could you both lose
to that numbskull?!

333
00:18:59,212 --> 00:19:01,339
That means it's down
to the Namekians, sir.

334
00:19:01,423 --> 00:19:03,633
If they're knocked out,
too, then we're done.

335
00:19:03,717 --> 00:19:05,343
[CHAMPA growls]
Crap!

336
00:19:05,427 --> 00:19:08,888
Only two more fighters left?
This is really bad!

337
00:19:08,972 --> 00:19:12,600
How can the fate of my whole
Universe rest on Namekians?

338
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:15,186
Hey! Saonel! Pilina!

339
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:18,064
You know what you
have to do, right?

340
00:19:18,148 --> 00:19:20,108
Yes, Lord Champa,
just leave it to us.

341
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:22,569
We won't let you down.
No matter what!

342
00:19:22,652 --> 00:19:25,780
We will take out the Seventh
and then win this whole thing!

343
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:29,701
[sighs] He won. Oh man,
that was close.

344
00:19:29,784 --> 00:19:32,871
In view of the circumstances,
Goku made an excellent choice.

345
00:19:32,954 --> 00:19:35,415
With limited stamina,
he needed to win quickly.

346
00:19:35,498 --> 00:19:39,002
And a close-range Kamehameha had
the power his punches lacked.

347
00:19:39,085 --> 00:19:41,504
With the superior reflexes
of Ultra Instinct,

348
00:19:41,588 --> 00:19:44,215
he knew he could avoid her
onslaught while he charged up,

349
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:47,218
then unleash everything in one
attack to knock Kefla out.

350
00:19:47,302 --> 00:19:49,095
It may have worked
this time but I doubt

351
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:51,014
he'll be able to
use that trick again.

352
00:19:51,097 --> 00:19:53,850
He'll have to face Jiren
and whoever else attacks.

353
00:19:53,933 --> 00:19:55,977
You're right, Master Roshi.

354
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:58,396
If only he could punch
without thinking, too.

355
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,191
[WHIS] That is the hardest
aspect of Ultra Instinct.

356
00:20:01,274 --> 00:20:03,610
Skilled martial artists
think constantly in battle,

357
00:20:03,693 --> 00:20:06,154
probing for weaknesses and
devising the best assault.

358
00:20:06,237 --> 00:20:08,198
Goku's melee attacks
were underwhelming

359
00:20:08,281 --> 00:20:10,992
because he was still trying to
command his body consciously,

360
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:13,119
thus sending contradictory
signals to his muscles

361
00:20:13,203 --> 00:20:15,413
that were moving independently
through Ultra Instinct.

362
00:20:15,497 --> 00:20:17,665
To succeed, he must
learn to let go,

363
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:20,710
separating his conscious mind
from his body so the subliminal

364
00:20:20,794 --> 00:20:23,463
can take over. The question
is whether he can do this

365
00:20:23,546 --> 00:20:25,548
in the short time
remaining in this contest.

366
00:20:25,632 --> 00:20:27,967
It's a most fascinating
development to watch.

367
00:20:28,051 --> 00:20:29,803
You agree don't you,
Lord Beerus?

368
00:20:29,886 --> 00:20:33,181
Don't try to rope me
into your prattling, Whis.

369
00:20:33,264 --> 00:20:35,850
[DYSPO] Looks like Goku's
attacks are improving.

370
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:39,145
He's getting even more
polished in that new form.

371
00:20:39,229 --> 00:20:42,273
[TOP] The longer we wait, the
stronger he's going to become.

372
00:20:42,357 --> 00:20:43,566
[JIREN]
Mm.

373
00:20:44,442 --> 00:20:46,569
[GOKU grunting]

374
00:20:46,653 --> 00:20:49,406
[panting]

375
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:57,330
I can't hold that form anymore.
Looks like I'm out of energy.

376
00:20:57,414 --> 00:21:00,667
The glories of this "Ultra
Instinct" do not come cheap.

377
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,628
It seems to dance through battle
like an untouchable god

378
00:21:03,712 --> 00:21:05,088
one's body must pay a toll

379
00:21:05,171 --> 00:21:08,216
so severe it's
essentially paralyzing.

380
00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:09,801
Heal quickly, Goku.

381
00:21:09,884 --> 00:21:12,637
As distasteful as it may be
to associate with you,

382
00:21:12,721 --> 00:21:15,724
I'm afraid I need you to
keep working on my behalf.

383
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:17,183
[chuckles]

384
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:19,144
This Ultra Instinct.

385
00:21:19,227 --> 00:21:22,397
If you can do it,
then obviously I can, too.

386
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,815
Damn you, Kakarot.

387
00:21:23,898 --> 00:21:28,403
You may have gotten there first,
but I will master it.

388
00:21:28,486 --> 00:21:30,739
[NARRATOR]
Goku has prevailed over Kefla.

389
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:32,824
But with only 17 minutes left

390
00:21:32,907 --> 00:21:36,578
in the desperate Tournament of
Power, there's no time to rest.

391
00:21:36,661 --> 00:21:38,955
Can Goku find a way
to fully embrace

392
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,084
Autonomous Ultra Instinct,
and keep his universe intact?

393
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:47,547
The clock keeps ticking,
next time on Dragon Ball Super!

394

[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

407
00:22:52,612 --> 00:22:54,906
Now the Second Universe
is coming at us

408
00:22:54,989 --> 00:22:56,533
in a full-on group attack!

409
00:22:56,616 --> 00:22:58,868
After Ribrianne uses her
love-power to make

410
00:22:58,952 --> 00:23:02,706
a crazy transformation, the
battle gets unexpectedly tough.

411
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:04,666
And since I can barely
stay on my feet,

412
00:23:04,749 --> 00:23:06,334
I'll have to depend
on the Androids

413
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,253
to get me out in one piece.

414
00:23:08,336 --> 00:23:10,630
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

415
00:23:10,714 --> 00:23:12,215
"Showdown of Love!

416

The Androids vs.
the 2nd Universe!"

417

Make sure you don't
miss it, okay?
