1
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,740
Don't you wanna dream again?

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,920
Now it's calling for me go back to the start

3
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,910
Wishing on the starlight

4
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,770
In the sky, let's paint a door for tomorrow

5
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,550
Just step on the new stage don't be shy

6
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,510
Gonna take the challenge of God

7
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,680
Kyo-Let's☆Mo-Let's☆Dynamic!

8
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,240
Let's! Go! Go! Big panic

9
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:50,990
I don't care 'bout limits, no regret

10
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:56,540
Make me tougher even though I lose

11
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,440
Nothing gonna stop me no mo' try me

12
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,750
So-Zets☆Cho-Zets☆Dynamic!

13
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,400
Let's Go! Yes! Give a kick!

14
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:10,780
Keep on going power pumpin' up

15
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:14,740
something greater waiting not so far away

16
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,750
[NARRATOR] Previously,
on Dragon Ball Super,

17
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:33,920
Beerus' brother Champa,
a fellow Destroyer,

18
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,390
arrived from the Sixth Universe.

19
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,330
Say, Beerus!
Let's have a contest, huh?

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,030
A contest? What exactly
are you proposing?

21
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,600
I mean a fighting
competition, obviously!

22
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,930
And if I win, we trade
Earths with each other.

23
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,900
[NARRATOR] Champa suggested a
five-against-five match-up

24
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,610
between their universes,
offering to give up

25
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,680
the Super Dragon Balls
he'd collected

26
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,640
if his team should lose.

27
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,450
All right then.
I could use a good battle!

28
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,380
[NARRATOR] The high-stakes
face-off has been set in motion

29
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,550
and it's ramping up quickly.

30
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,020
Ah! Hell yeah!

31
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,660
[NARRATOR]
Now!

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,540
--[BEERUS] Hm!
--[CHAMPA] Hm!

33
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,740
[GOKU chuckles]

34
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:24,940
[BOTH sigh]

35
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,840
Now we just have to decide
where to hold this competition.

36
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,680
Oh, I know the perfect place.

37
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,580
Why don't we do it on
The Planet With No Name--

38
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,950
the one that's floating
in neutral space?

39
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,920
That way neither of us will
have home-team advantage.

40
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,320
But, Lord Champa.

41
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,520
[CHAMPA]
Huh?

42
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,320
That world only has
a tiny sun nearby

43
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,920
to shed any warmth or light.

44
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,760
It's a rock
with little to offer.

45
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:46,790
Not even an atmosphere.
It's quite desolate.

46
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:47,890
[CHAMPA]
Hmmm...

47
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,730
Well, this is your idea, Champa.

48
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,860
So, you figure out
how to make it all work.

49
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,800
Trust me, I will.

50
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,040
Hey, as long as
I'm in planning mode,

51
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,440
you want me to draw up
the competition rules, too?

52
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,670
It shouldn't be too hard.

53
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,580
--Hm?
--[GOKU] Oh, hey, I know.

54
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,750
Let's make it like the
World Martial Arts Tournament.

55
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,810
And what might
that entail, Saiyan?

56
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,720
You lose when you surrender
or if you step outside the ring,

57
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,890
and there's no killing
or weapons allowed.

58
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,420
Huh...

59
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,620
You can't boost your
natural power by cheating,

60
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,860
and there should be
a written test

61
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,530
for anyone who wants to enter.

62
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,960
We don't need some mindless
monster on either side.

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,600
You need a brain big enough
to understand the rules.

64
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,900
[chuckles]

65
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:29,440
Yes, that all sounds
reasonable to me. Champa?

66
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,470
Yeah, you in? Your lordship?

67
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,540
[CHAMPA]
Mmmm, hmmm...

68
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,310
Oh, all right, fine.

69
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,010
So, the games shall begin
at seven o'clock sharp,

70
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:42,380
one week from today, by the
Eighth Solar Calendar. Good day.

71
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,480
[WHIS]
Hm.

72
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,320
That equates to five
of your Earth days, Goku.

73
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,620
[GOKU]
I can't wait!

74
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:53,390
And Champa, remember,
you wanted this contest.

75
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,430
So, don't back out on me.

76
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,600
[CHAMPA]
Hmph! Don't be absurd.

77
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,430
You just make sure
you keep your word, Beerus.

78
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,900
Guess that goes double for you.

79
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:05,770
[CHAMPA] Pft!
Oh, I almost forgot. Here.

80
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:16,350
[hollers]

81
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,650
Boy, that was close!

82
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:18,820
[CHAMPA chuckles]

83
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,790
Consider it a parting gift.

84
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,990
[GOKU]
Gee, thanks, Lord Champa!

85
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,990
Are you sure about this?

86
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,900
If you lose, you'll have to
give up the six wish orbs

87
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,930
you worked so hard to collect.

88
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:32,970
[chuckles]

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,500
You saw that klutz
fumbling around with the egg.

90
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,900
[laughs]

91
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,270
His reflexes were awfully slow,
even for a mortal!

92
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,240
If that's the best
Beerus has to offer,

93
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,880
then we have absolutely nothing
to worry about, Vados.

94
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:45,880
[chuckles]

95
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,910
The Seventh Universe's Earth
and all of its

96
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,780
delicious goodies will
belong to us soon enough!

97
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:55,620
[GOKU] Man, things are starting
to get interesting now.

98
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,520
That was heavy!

99
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,590
[VEGETA] This competition
is merely a waypoint for me.

100
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:04,430
What I'm really after is the
title of "Number One Warrior."

101
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,730
Someday, I'm going to
take them all down!

102
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:09,640
Beerus, Whis, Champa, and Vados!

103
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,000
[chuckles]

104
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,910
Yeah, guess neither
of us wants to be

105
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,910
runner-up to those guys.

106
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,680
By the way, these matches
are five-on-five, right?

107
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,750
So, I wonder who else
Lord Beerus is gonna pick

108
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,380
to fill out
the rest of our team.

109
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,450
Ha. It doesn't really
matter who they are.

110
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,890
They won't even
have a chance to fight

111
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,360
if I crush every one on the
Sixth Universe's team myself.

112
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,690
Wait a minute,
you can't hog all the fun.

113
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,630
That's it,
I'm calling it right now!

114
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,860
I'm gonna be the leadoff guy
and fight first!

115
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,230
No way! Do you honestly
believe I would allow that?

116
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,470
[GOKU] You have to!
I called it! Ha-ha!

117
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,240
[BEERUS]
Hey, you two!

118
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,640
Get a move on
or we're leaving you here.

119
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,840
[VEGETA]
Yes, sir!

120
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,610
--[GOKU] Huh?
--Right away, sir!

121
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,680
[chuckles nervously]

122
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,750
Huh?!

123
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,350
How'd you wind up
in this situation?

124
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,960
I don't know,
it sort of happened.

125
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,520
--It's not like I take notes.
--[laughs]

126
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,290
I think what's
truly important is that

127
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,730
we come up with
a device capable of

128
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,600
finding the remaining
Super Dragon Ball.

129
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,500
I don't suppose you can
help with that, Bulma?

130
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,530
Well, yeah, sure, that
shouldn't be too big a deal.

131
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,800
If the Super Dragon Ball's
really that huge,

132
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,800
then hopefully its signature
will be strong enough

133
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,770
to compensate for
the increase in distance.

134
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,940
I just need to tweak the
Radar's design. But you know...

135
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,410
Know what?

136
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:26,710
There's a much easier way
to find this thing,

137
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,510
don't you think?
[chuckles]

138
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,520
Just gather up
the earth's Dragon Balls

139
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,920
and have Shenron
tell us where this

140
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,220
Super Dragon Ball is hidden.

141
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,890
--[BEERUS] Oh!
--That could work.

142
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,460
Great idea!

143
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,430
Oh, yeah!
[chuckles]

144
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,990
Must admit, I'm impressed.

145
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:44,760
Turns out, you really are more
than just an overbearing nag.

146
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
[WHIS]
Oh!

147
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,970
[BOTH yell]

148
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,400
Been a long time
since I've seen someone

149
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,240
strike you like that, my lord.

150
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,500
Augh! You little--!

151
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,470
[chuckles nervously]

152
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,840
Oh, never mind.

153
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,840
In light of your smart proposal,
I'll let it pass this time.

154
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,310
[sighs]

155
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,580
Hey, Vegeta!

156
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,480
Ah, yes, sir!

157
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,720
[BEERUS]
Go fetch.

158
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,320
Yes, sir!

159
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,650
The Dragon Radar! Honey! Bye!

160
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,490
Whoa, wish he'd
obey me like that.

161
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,600
[GOKU chuckles]

162
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,960
[VADOS] My goodness,
transporting these

163
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,800
Super Dragon Balls is
getting to be quite tiresome.

164
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,770
[CHAMPA snores]

165
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,490
Wake up, my lord. We're here.

166
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,860
Already? That was fast.

167
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,210
The Planet With No Name, huh?

168
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,480
That just won't do.

169
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,150
I know! I'll come up
with a brilliantly eloquent

170
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,490
new moniker for it!

171
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:18,090
I shall dub thee...
The Nothing Planet! Ha!

172
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,830
You certainly possess an
uncanny gift for naming things

173
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,460
and a poetic way with words
befitting a Destroyer.

174
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,930
[CHAMPA chuckles]

175
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:28,170
No, do I really?
Stop it, you're flattering me!

176
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,300
Mm. You know, sir,
whenever you think that hard

177
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,400
about something and give
your brain a good workout,

178
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,310
it consumes a massive
amount of calories,

179
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,780
which is quite beneficial
for your diet. Thirsty?

180
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:42,210
I've told you,
I don't need to be on a diet.

181
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,150
[VADOS] That juice
is freshly squeezed from

182
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,390
the bitter niganiga greens
of Planet Yago.

183
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,190
[CHAMPA]
Ah! Yuck!

184
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,760
[VADOS] Now, to turn The
Nothing Planet into something--

185
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,200
something appropriate
for a tournament, that is.

186
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,130
Where should I start?

187
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,970
That's about
the right size, I think.

188
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,970
[CHAMPA]
Huh?

189
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:14,080
Aah! Not bad.
[coughs]

190
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,850
[yells]

191
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,220
I had to check and make sure.

192
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,220
Can't have it break
during a match, you know.

193
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,890
Ooh, look. Not even
a scratch. Nice work.

194
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,130
[VADOS]
Naturally.

195
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,100
[CHAMPA]
Moving on.

196
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:32,670
[inhales]

197
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,970
Ah, now that is some
nice high-quality air!

198
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,270
Yes, I was trying to reproduce
the fresh, crisp air

199
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,440
found in the high plains
of Planet Sorert.

200
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,070
Great. So, what's next?

201
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,040
The fight ring.

202
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,780
What size, my lord?

203
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:48,110
[CHAMPA] Fifty standard lengths
a side ought to be sufficient.

204
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,950
Make it too big and
the spectators can't

205
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,750
be close enough to the action.

206
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,920
[VADOS]
Now item three.

207
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,190
[CHAMPA]
Concession stands!

208
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,320
That's the one thing
we can't do without!

209
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,990
[VADOS]
Oh, all right. Fine.

210
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,760
It's so beautiful!
[laughs]

211
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,370
Try to use restraint. Now then.

212
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,310
[CHAMPA]
Mmm? Aah!

213
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,780
[BULMA]
Okay, here we go.

214
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,820
I summon forth
the Eternal Dragon Shenron!

215
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,860
You really get things
done quickly, don't you, Vegeta?

216
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:36,060
Precisely what
I look for in a gofer.

217
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,000
You don't thank people
by humiliating them!

218
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,940
Ignore him, sweetie;
you did good.

219
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,440
[VEGETA]
Aah!

220
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,840
Hey! Are you nuts?

221
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,770
You know I hate
your sneak attacks!

222
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:50,080
[BULMA giggles]

223
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,480
[ALL gasp]

224
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,180
[SHENRON roars]

225
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,920
I am the Dragon, Shenron.

226
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,290
I shall grant you
any three wishes.

227
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,860
Now speak your first wish!

228
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,960
Here.

229
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,770
Oh, Lord Beerus, sir?

230
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,130
What a humbling surprise!

231
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,900
Though you seem to be on Earth
quite a lot these days.

232
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,100
Yes, well, at the moment,

233
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,770
this planet is
turning out to be crucial

234
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,010
to both the Sixth
and Seventh Universes.

235
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,980
Oh? Really?

236
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:38,810
[BEERUS] Anyway, we could use a
little bit of assistance today,

237
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,150
which is why
I'm willing to put up

238
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,220
with your whole pompous routine.

239
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,420
Oh...

240
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,890
[BEERUS]
Now, go ahead.

241
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,160
[BULMA] Okay. Shenron,
we want you to tell us

242
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,990
where we might be able to find
something in the Sixth Universe.

243
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,760
It's the last Super Dragon Ball.

244
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,030
--So...?
--[GOKU] Uh...

245
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,860
[WHIS]
Hmmm?

246
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,070
I can't.

247
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,240
[ALL]
You can't?

248
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,040
Space is so very vast.

249
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,810
I'm afraid my powers are not
so almighty that I can

250
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,280
pinpoint one object floating
in its boundless expanse.

251
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:13,850
Let alone, locate it in an
entirely different universe.

252
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,880
I see. So, it seems
we've bumped up against

253
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,020
the limitations
of Earth's Dragon Balls.

254
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,350
Well, that's
disappointing, isn't it?

255
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:23,460
Well, guess it's not
gonna be that easy after all.

256
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:26,090
Uh. I'll get to work
on that radar.

257
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,130
We'll see if science
can beat a dragon.

258
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,330
You really are a useless
lizard, aren't you?

259
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,100
Forgive me, sir.

260
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,230
[clears throat]

261
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,970
Perhaps you have
another wish for me, maybe?

262
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:38,410
Just go away.
That's my bloody wish.

263
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,410
Oh. Farewell.

264
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,380
Honestly, that was almost
too pitiful to watch.

265
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,050
Huh. Feels like I'm
forgetting something.

266
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:53,220
Ooh! Oh, right, King Kai!

267
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,960
I'm supposed to ask Shenron
to bring him back to life!

268
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:58,890
[BULMA] Can't you just
do it next time?

269
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,930
I guess.

270
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,100
Uuh!

271
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,230
--[GREGORY sighs]
--[KING KAI] Oh, no, no...

272
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,240
[CHAMPA] It sure is relaxing,
going into a contest

273
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,080
you know
you can't possibly lose.

274
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:20,350
Just picturing Beerus weeping
in defeat works up an appetite.

275
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,050
Why, I could scarf down
ten bowls of rice right now.

276
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:25,090
[VADOS] My lord, have you
picked the five contestants

277
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,790
you want to fight on our behalf?

278
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,920
Well, let's see, those
two fighters at Beerus' place

279
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,420
looked like Saiyans,
didn't they?

280
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:33,190
That means our team
oughta have some Saiyans, too.

281
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,760
We'll go scout talent
as soon as you fix that.

282
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,100
Fix it? What's wrong?

283
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:40,370
You didn't make me
handsome enough, Vados!

284
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:44,210
I mean, you put my head
on some fatso's body! Really!

285
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,870
Oh, good grief.

286
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,010
[WHIS]
Mmm, that beef stew was divine.

287
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,780
Earth's bountiful
delicacies never cease

288
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,310
to satisfy my palate.

289
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:55,120
Yes, and that's why I refuse
to lose Earth to Champa.

290
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,450
That was excellent.

291
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:59,420
Now then, I'm afraid that
we really must be getting back.

292
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,460
Obviously, we still
have to tell Monaka

293
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:04,360
about the competition
so he can prepare.

294
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:07,060
[GOKU] Whoa, hold on,
who's this Monaka guy?

295
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,330
Oh, we didn't tell you?

296
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,000
He's a warrior Lord Beerus
has chosen to fight for us.

297
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,100
Really?

298
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,140
You and Vegeta go fill
the remaining two slots

299
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,500
and let me know when
you're done. You got that?

300
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,210
Wait. This guy you know--
is he super strong?

301
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,410
C'mon, tell me!

302
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,410
[BEERUS] Well, of course,
he's tremendously strong.

303
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,280
Okay, tell me more!
What's he look like?

304
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,450
Like is he an earthling?
Or from some other planet?

305
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,780
He's not a deity, is he?

306
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,220
Come on, you gotta
gimme something here!

307
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,860
Leave me alone!

308
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:36,190
[GOKU]
Aaah, sorry!

309
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,860
If you must know,
Monaka just happens to be

310
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,260
the strongest opponent
I've ever gone up against.

311
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,970
What? Strongest ever?

312
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,170
Aw, for real?

313
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,200
Come now, Saiyan.
Don't tell me you thought

314
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,170
 you were the toughest
I'd ever faced.

315
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:51,440
I thought I'd made
that clear to you before.

316
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,540
[chuckles]

317
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:57,040
You're number two, Goku.
Second-best. Disappointed?

318
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,210
[VEGETA grunts]

319
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,850
You hear that Vegeta?
Another fighter!

320
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,880
Is that awesome or what?
I can't wait to meet this guy!

321
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,390
I will never
understand you, Kakarot.

322
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,990
So, when do I get to spar
with this Monaka guy?

323
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,260
Like, is tomorrow okay?

324
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:10,460
Not a chance.

325
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:13,390
Your opponents are the fighters
from the Sixth Universe.

326
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,400
Focus all your
attention on them.

327
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:17,500
Well, okay, but who knows
what kinda competition

328
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:19,830
they'll turn out to be.
And if you're worried

329
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,200
it could affect us
for the tournament,

330
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,770
does it really matter?

331
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:24,240
I mean, even if we lose
and the earth moves

332
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,910
to a whole other universe,
nothing changes for us.

333
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,310
What? Bite your tongue!

334
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,880
Have you forgotten
the debt you owe me

335
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,180
for not destroying
your precious little planet?

336
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,720
If you don't try as hard
as you can to win this thing,

337
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,920
you'll have to answer to me!

338
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:40,120
Okay, okay, I got it, chill.

339
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,060
And anyway, just so you know...

340
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,760
[BEERUS]
Hm?

341
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,390
I always give it
everything I've got,

342
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,730
no matter what!

343
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,030
Tell Monaka I said hi!

344
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:54,100
[yawns]

345
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,370
Mornin'! You're up early.

346
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:57,840
Hey, what's that?

347
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,940
The Super Dragon Radar,
of course.

348
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,710
Whoa, no way! Really? Wow!

349
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,380
I can't believe you built it
in one night. That's so cool.

350
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:08,980
How can you be
so laid back about this?

351
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,450
You know we're short on time;
take this seriously.

352
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:14,920
Have you guys forgotten
what they said yesterday?

353
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,760
I'll be back to pick you up
in five of your Earth days.

354
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,690
Please be ready
at one o'clock sharp.

355
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:20,900
Okay, awesome!

356
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,500
I have to say
this other Destroyer

357
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,500
doesn't sound too bright.

358
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:26,770
I mean, if these
Super Dragon Balls really can

359
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,200
grant any wish,
no matter how impossible,

360
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,110
then he wouldn't need
to make this wager.

361
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,840
He could just use them to ask
for an exact copy of Earth,

362
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,340
couldn't he?
Or even say,

363
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,810
"I wish to always
have delicious food."

364
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,250
He doesn't need the earth.

365
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,350
[BEERUS chuckles]

366
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,350
As clever as you may be,
young lady,

367
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:45,050
your problem is that you still
think like a mere human.

368
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,890
Hey! What does that mean?

369
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,060
To deities like us,
Super Dragon Balls

370
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:52,090
are inconsequential baubles,
little more than an excuse

371
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:55,760
to compete over something.
Just think about it.

372
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,000
The Sixth and Seventh
Universes are counterparts

373
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:01,070
to one another. So, I'm sure
if you poked around enough,

374
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,110
you'd probably find some
Super Dragon Balls here, too.

375
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,210
[gasps]

376
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,440
Deities such as myself
don't make wishes.

377
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,340
Though if we did,
it might be more like,

378
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,480
"Wipe out all of existence!"

379
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,220
-[BEERUS laughs]
--[BULMA gasps]

380
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,480
[BEERUS]
Or something similar.

381
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,720
Now, that would be
truly exciting.

382
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,420
[GOKU chuckles]
Yeah, but if you did that,

383
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,460
there wouldn't be anything
good left for you to eat!

384
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,220
And where would be
the fun in a universe

385
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,790
where nothing at all exists?

386
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:27,430
Well, maybe you're right.
[laughs]

387
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,060
Let's go, Whis.

388
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,870
Yes, sir.

389
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,800
[BULMA gasps]

390

[GOKU]
Tell Monaka I said hi!

391
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,080
The look on his face
when he said that.

392
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,010
Listen, we don't know
what kind of dangerous wish

393
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,950
Beerus would make
if he got the chance!

394
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,180
Bulma, stop!

395
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,720
[GOKU] Whoa, he was
just joking around!

396
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,450
No need to get
all worked up about it!

397
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:54,990
Just a joke? And how
can you be so sure of that?

398
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,460
I don't know.

399
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,400
If what Beerus said is right,
and there's a possibility

400
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,560
our universe has
Super Dragon Balls, too,

401

then I say we use this thing
to collect them all first!

402
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,040
That way if he does
make a horrible wish,

403
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,170
we have the chance
to cancel it out!

404
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,570
Cut it out, Bulma!

405
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:13,770
Why should I?

406
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,610
Look, Beerus may be
the God of Destruction,

407
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:18,550
but he'll still act rationally
if he feels he's respected.

408
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,480
[BUU hollers]

409
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,650
Much as I shrug off
the constant shortcomings

410
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:27,120
of the witless masses, there's
one thing I can't tolerate.

411
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,760
And that is the callous
arrogance of those

412
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:32,760
who do not pay me the respect
a Destroyer is due.

413
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,400
I really don't think
Beerus would wipe out

414
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,760
all of existence
without a good reason.

415
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,330
Yeah, I agree.

416
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,670
Say what you will about the guy,
but he didn't blow up the earth,

417

even when he told us he would.

--[VEGETA] Precisely.
--[GOKU] Yeah.

[GOKU]
Mmm?

00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,340
If you boys won't help me,
that's no problem.

422
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,240
I have other ways
to get what I want.

423
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,680
Hey, wait!
Who are you calling?

424

Ah, hi, sis.

[BULMA]
You're pals with Jaco, right?

428
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,390
Last time I saw him,
he mentioned something

429
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,020
about upgrading his ship.

430
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,160
He was inspired by
the Frieza Force's tech.

431
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,400
[TIGHTS]
Mm-hmm, he was super psyched.

432
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,160
[BULMA] So, has he told you
how long it will take him

433
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,100
to get to Earth
with that upgrade?

434
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,200
[TIGHTS] Uh, yeah,
I wanna say fifty minutes.

435
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,570
He told me his ship
was gonna be way faster now.

436
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,570
So fast it'd be
downright nauseating.

437
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:20,210
Can you believe that?

438
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,610
[BULMA] Listen, could you ask
him to come over to my place,

439
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,480
like, now?

440
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,380
[TIGHTS]
Sure, I'll tell him. No sweat.

441

Hang on, just gimme
a second. Let's see.

443

the angle is crucial.

you to get over to her place

get through to me,

470
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,440
Why don't you go
and do some of that

471
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,410
training you love so much?

472
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:35,080
--Okay.
--Cool. Be careful out there.

473
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,580
Hold on, are you serious?

474
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,690
You're not actually
supposed to leave!

475
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,750
We haven't tested
the Super Dragon Radar

476
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,790
I worked so hard to build!

477
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:45,760
Why isn't this working?

478
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,830
It's not reading
anything at all.

479
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,260
[BULMA chuckles]

480
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,200
Hey, what's going on?
What are you up to?

481
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:53,270
Aw, can't figure it out, boys?

482
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,200
Do you need me
to explain it for you?

483
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,100
You can be
such a pain sometimes!

484
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,840
Listen. We're all the way
on the edge of the universe,

485
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,310
so we can't search
every part of it from here.

486
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,550
And I can't make the Radar
any more powerful,

487
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,350
so to find
the Super Dragon Balls,

488
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:09,320
we're gonna have to go
to the center of the universe.

489
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,850
Well, how long's
that gonna take?

490
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,290
Depends on the ship.

491
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,760
I'm not gonna let Beerus
get whatever he wants.

492
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:17,190
And that means getting
to those Super Dragon Balls

493
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:20,330
before he does,
no matter what! Uh!

494
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,830
[GOKU] Hey, that's fine and all,
but try not to let it

495
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,670
get in the way
of our tournament, okay?

496
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,570
Are you kidding me?
You guys care more about

497
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,840
this stupid tournament
than the fate of the universe?

498
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,510
[chuckles]
The universe'll be fine!

499
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,970
Don't worry about it, Bulma.

500
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,580
Besides, I've gotta
meet this Monaka guy.

501
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,310
Goodbye to our adventure

502
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,820
In twilight we must go our separate ways

503
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:57,350
And try to discover the path to our own destiny

504
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,600
I can't find the words

505
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,130
to tell you how much our parting hurts

506
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,630
I hope you know I'll always love you

507
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:07,580
And all that we shared will be remembered

508
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,890
How could I forget your face?

509
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,790
All my memories erased

510
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,870
I can still hear the melody of your voice

511
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,430
Petals fall in from above

512
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,070
Fade away, all that we love

513
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:28,580
In the twilight,

514
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:28,580
fade away,

515
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,580
fade away

516
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:34,990
Sayonara,

517
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,990
fade away,

518
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,990
fade away

519
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,040
Hey, it's me, Goku!

520
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,170
I can't wait for this tournament!

521
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:47,300
I'm sure the 6th Universe is putting
together an All-Star squad of fighters

522
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,340
so we've got to do whatever it takes
to build a great team too!

523
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,850
Even if that means giving away
one of the Super Dragon Ball wishes.

524
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,810
I hope Beerus is cool with that!

525
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:58,020
Next time on Dragon Ball Super:

526
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,770
Make sure you don't miss it, okay?
