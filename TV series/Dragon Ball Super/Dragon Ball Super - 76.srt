tells <i>me</i> about it.

319
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:14,875
What? There's no secret?

320
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,125
So what you're saying is,

321
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,083
you were just wasting
their time with this?

322
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,666
No. I mean, it's--

323
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,458
[KRILLIN]
It's not like that, 18.

324
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:22,458
[GOKU, ROSHI, A18]
Huh?

325
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,500
It's about
controlling our energy.

326
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,125
Isn't that right, Goku?

327
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,708
Yeah, that's right.

328
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:30,041
Once we calmed down
and reigned in our energy,

329
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,208
Frieza and the rest
just disappeared.

330
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:33,833
That's what Master Roshi
wanted me to get

331
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,875
outta this all along.

332
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:38,708
Somehow, you knew
everything that I needed.

333
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:41,625
[laughing]
Why, of course I did!

334
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,708
I wouldn't go so far
as to say he knew <i>everything</i> .

335
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,916
So you don't even
need these herbs, do you?

336
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,958
[ROSHI]
Well, I wouldn't say that!

337
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,833
Jeez, you look
like a cow, old man!

338
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:56,666
Ya-haaa!

339
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:00,083
Wow, talk about an energy boost!
I feel younger already!

340
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,166
I could live
for a thousand years!

341
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,083
[BABA] Well, you'd better.
It might just take you

342
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:07,041
that long to pay off
my assistance fee in full.

343
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:11,041
Aw, why couldn't I have a sister
who likes to help me for free?

344
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,208
[GOKU chuckles]

345
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,666
--[KRILLIN] Hey, Goku!
--[GOKU] Huh?

346
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,916
Looking forward
to continuing our training.

347
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,958
[GOKU]
Hm. Good.

348

350
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:28,291
There, all done.

351
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:33,291
Wow! It's so smooth!

352
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,541
You think your old man
looks cool, Marron?

353
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:36,833
[MARRON]
Super cool!

354
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:39,041
[KRILLIN chuckles]

355
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:41,291
[GOKU]
Heya, Krillin!

356
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:42,708
Hey, what's up?

357
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,291
I gotta do some training
and I'm gonna need a partner.

358
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,333
How'd you like to
spar with me again?

359
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:49,541
Count me in.
There's just one thing.

360
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,416
Oh yeah, what is it?

361
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,125
No turning Super Saiyan on me.

362
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:56,291

367
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:15,708
<i>Too much confusion in my head</i>

<i>I can't think with all</i>

369
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:25,083
<i>Is there any way to know</i>

[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

379
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:05,500
Yo, Vegeta, let's go do some
more training with Whis.

380
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:08,166
Huh, whaddaya mean,
you're not coming?

381
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,541
What's gotten into you?

382
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:10,916
Does this have
something to do with

383
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,291
Bulma's tummy getting bigger?

384
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:15,291
All right, I can't
take it anymore!

385
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:16,958
I'm just gonna
go ahead and ask Zenny

386
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:19,291
to hold another tournament.

387
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:21,541
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

388
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:25,250
"Let's Do It, Grand Zeno!
The Universes' Best Tournament!"

389
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:27,166
Make sure you don't
miss it, okay?
