00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:01,125
[NARIRAMA]
Okay.

161
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,000
[NIGRISSI]
You'll note the iron claws--

162
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:06,125
to keep him from being
pushed from the ring.

163
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:07,583
[NARIRAMA grunts]

164
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,416
[MOSCO beeping]

165
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,125
[NIGRISSI]
If, by some freak occurrence,

166
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,791
he does fall or get thrown,

167
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:17,833
he can avoid a ring out
by using this ability.

168
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,500
[MOSCO beeping]

169
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,166
Lord Mosco wishes to know:

170
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,583
How will he save himself
if the arm's cut off?

171
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,500
[NIGRISSI] In that case,
he'll hold on to the ring

172
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:33,833
using super suction cups!

173
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,166
[NARIRAMA roars]

174
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,500
He will not be eliminated!

175
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,458
In fact, he will
do the eliminating

176
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,166
with his extended limbs!

177
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,500
[gasps]

178
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:54,916
Now you have seen the scope of
Narirama's super survivability!

179
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,291
And the retrofits on our
other team members

180
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,083
are just as ingenious.

181
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:02,916
There couldn't be a more
perfectly-suited team.

182
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:07,916
The victory and survival of
our universe is inevitable.

183
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,041
[EA]
Hmph.

184
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:14,041
[MOSCO beeping]

185
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,541
Ooh, wow!

186
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,166
[MARRON giggles]

187
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,958
[GOHAN]
Uh? Over here, guys!

188
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,166
[BEERUS]
Hm?

189
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,125
Sorry if we kept you waiting.

190
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,458
It's fine.

191
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:33,083
Hey there 18, it's always
a pleasure to see you.

192
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,166
That goes for you, too, Marron.

193
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,750
[MARRON laughs]

194
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,500
What's up, Tien.
Long-time-no-see, pal.

195
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,875
Uh...?

196
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,583
Hey, where's Master Roshi?

197
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,333
I heard he was at your dojo.

198
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:45,708
He didn't come back with you?

199
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,666
He had something to attend to.

200
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,291
A last bit of training
he considers essential.

201
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,333
Training?

202
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:52,833
What's he still have to learn?

203
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,958
In this tournament,
if you leave yourself open

204
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,791
for even an instant,
you're toast.

205
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,541
Roshi's making sure
his one weakness

206
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,000
won't put him in a bad spot.

207
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,666
His one weakness, huh?

208
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,458
I think I know what that means.

209
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,791
[ROSHI panting]

210
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,541
[ROSHI]
You can't distract me.

211
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,083
You don't affect me.

212
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:18,791
Never again will I fall under
the spell of a woman!

213
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,875
It worked. I'm cured!

214
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:25,458
All right! I conquered
my weakness!

215
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,208
Who knew the day would come

216
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:31,000
where hot girls no longer
distracted Master Roshi?

217
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,000
I know!

218
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,291
[GOTEN]
Yay, they're here!

219
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:34,500
[ALL]
Huh?

220
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,666
Hey there, Krillin. What's up?

221
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,000
Wow.

222
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,333
You two have really grown
up since I last saw ya!

223
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,583
What's the new baby like?

224
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:45,083
She's the sweetest thing ever!

225
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,125
[MARRON]
I wanna see her! Can I see her!

226
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:48,750
[TRUNKS]
Sure! Let's all go!

227
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:49,583
[GOTEN]
C'mon!

228
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:50,458
[TRUNKS]
Follow us!

229
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,416
[MARRON]
Yay! Heh-heh!

230
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,583
I can't believe how
relaxed they are.

231
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:57,166
Well, it appears that Goku
has still not told everyone

232
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,333
that their universe will be
eliminated should his team

233
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,125
not win the Tournament of Power.

234
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:04,250
All right. We just
need Vegeta and 17.

235
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,125
[KRILLIN]
Hey, Tien!

236
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,750
[TIEN]
Yeah?

237
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,291
Whaddaya say we warm up?

238
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:09,916
Sounds like we got
plenty of time waiting

239
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,250
for ten people to show up.

240
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,666
[TIEN grunts]

241
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,916
As of now, we don't
have ten warriors,

242
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,583
due to an unforeseen problem.

243
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:19,041
Uh? What kinda problem?

244
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,875
[PICCOLO] Buu fell asleep,
and he won't wake up.

245
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,291
[KRILLIN]
Aw man, again?

246
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,625
So what does that mean
for the rest of us?

247
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,208
Well, if Buu's gone,

248
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:29,250
we'll just compete
as a team of nine.

249
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,916
[SUPREME KAI]
That will not be an option.

250
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,250
--[KRILLIN] Uh?
--[PICCOLO] Hm?

251
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,583
What do you mean by that?

252
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,708
If the Omni-King
wants ten fighters,

253
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:37,791
there must be ten.

254
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,708
That's right, Gohan.
You listening?

255
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:42,500
Last I checked, you're our
universe's team leader.

256
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,375
So fill that spot!

257
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,166
It'll all work out.

258
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,125
If there's anyone around
who can wake up Buu,

259
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,916
I'm confident it's my dad.

260
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,208
And on the off chance he
can't get the job done,

261
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:58,000
I guarantee I'll find our
squad another fighter.

262
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,791
[KRILLIN]
Hey, I'll help, too!

263
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,708
No way I'm letting
a sleeping Buu

264
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,791
come between me and
ten million zeni!

265
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:04,833
[GOHAN]
Uh...

266
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:06,791
But, I shouldn't
get ahead of myself

267
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:09,583
considering 18 says
she's taking my cut.

268
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:13,000
What's this about ten
million zeni? A prize?

269
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,791
[KRILLIN] Goku said everyone
on the winning team

270
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,083
gets ten million each!

271
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:16,833
Uh?

272
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,708
Then he lied to you.

273
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:21,000
[TIEN]
Wait. There's no reward?

274
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,916
I thought we were all here
for a chance at that money.

275
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,375
[gasps] So if
there's no prize...

276
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:30,875
Then what, exactly, is the
Tournament of Power all about?

277
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:34,958
[VEGETA yells]

278
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,291
[gasping]

279
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,083
[TIEN grunts]

280
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:43,583
So help me, if he blew up the
Hyperbolic Time Chamber again...

281
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,625
[CABBA]
Watch closely.

282
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:12,333
I shall demonstrate the
Super Saiyan transformation.

283
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,291
[CAULIFLA]
Yeah, yeah. Just get on with it!

284
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,666
[CABBA]
Uh, right. Sorry.

285
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:23,375
[yells]

286
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,458
[laughs]

287
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,916
And that is how you
become a Super Saiyan!

288
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,500
It's even stronger
than I was expecting!

289
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:33,541
Teach me!

290
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,208
Teach me how to do it,
right away!

291
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,500
Now! Now!

292
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:37,916
Uh... Uh!

293
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,625
I was taught how to do it
by a warrior named Vegeta.

294
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,000
I barely got the
ins-and-outs of it myself!

295
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,291
It seems it helps to be in
a certain frame of mind

296
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:48,375
to tap into the power, and I'm
not sure I can get you there.

297
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,458
But I'll do my best to try.

298
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:51,333
Great!

299
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,583
So... You're a big weirdo.

300
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,791
What?!

301
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:59,208
U-Uh. And, uh, you're
like... stupid, too.

302
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:00,875
What?!

303
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:03,041
Is this your idea of a joke?

304
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,541
No joke! I swear!

305
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,208
It's all part of the training.

306
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,041
[KALE]
Heh.

307
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,541
[CABBA grunting]

308
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:12,791
So, uh. How are you feeling
right now, any different?

309
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,583
Different in what way?

310
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,375
I was insulting you
just then in hopes

311
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,416
of drawing out the energy
through your anger.

312
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,000
You really thought that
stuff would get me mad?

313
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,083
Well, you looked
pretty angry to me.

314
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,208
[CAULIFLA growls]
What?

315
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:25,375
I'm sorry!

316
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,083
You're tellin' me every
time you transform

317
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,958
into a Super Saiyan
you're angry?

318
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,833

00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,416
[BULMA] In return,
just make sure you win

480
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,083
and keep us all un-destroyed.

481
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,291
Thanks! We won't let you down!

482
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,125
Bulma's prize doesn't
change the fact

483
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:40,333
that we're still down a man.

484
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,375
Yes! And we're almost
all out of time!

485
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:45,875
There must be someone else!
This universe is enormous!

486
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,375
And yet all the decent fighters

487
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:50,583
seem to be on or from this
teeny booger of a planet!

488
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,000
We wouldn't have such an issue
filling that tenth spot

489
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:56,583
if you goody-two-shoes hadn't
wiped out the Frieza Force!

490
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:57,875
I got it!

491
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:58,666
[GROUP]
Huh?

492
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,750
'Kay. Let's hear it.

493
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,333
Lord Beerus, thanks to you,
I know who to ask!

494
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:06,791
It's Frieza!
That's who we should get!

495
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:09,250
He can be the tenth
fighter on our team!

496
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:12,083
[ALL]
Frieza?!

497
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:18,250
[NARRATOR] Goku's friends
couldn't believe their ears!

498
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:21,166
No one expected
to hear that name

499
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:25,958
uttered for their team's
tenth and final spot!

500
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:29,875
Will a resurrected Frieza
actually make common cause

501
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:33,416
with Goku and the others
to defend the universe

502
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,208
he once ruled as Emperor?

503
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:44,083
Only three hours remain until
the Tournament of Power begins!

504
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:52,083
[FRIEZA growls]

505

00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:05,458

507
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:09,291

[GOKU]
Hey, it's me, Goku!

523
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:59,833
Well, Frieza, the way I see it,
we don't have a choice:

524
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:01,291
If we're gonna win
the Tournament

525
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:02,875
and save our universe,

526
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:06,500
we'll need you, the mightiest,
wickedest guy in our universe!

527
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:09,208
So, whaddaya say?
Will you join the team?

528
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:10,625
What? Seriously?

529
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:13,500
Oh, man, that is one heck
of a demand you're making!

530
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:15,791
Next time, on Dragon Ball Super:

531
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:19,125
"You're Our Tenth Warrior!
Goku Approaches Frieza!!"

532
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:21,291
Make sure you don't
miss it, okay?
