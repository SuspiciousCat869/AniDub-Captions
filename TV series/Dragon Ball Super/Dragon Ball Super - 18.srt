[NARRATOR] Previously,
on Dragon Ball Super,

3
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:54,291
Vegeta left Earth to train
under the mysterious

4
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:56,625
alien being known as Whis.

5
00:01:56,708 --> 00:02:00,125
While back home, Gohan
and Videl's daughter, Pan,

6
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:03,541
was born, bringing
great joy to her family.

7
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:05,541
Krillin has become
a police officer,

8
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,958
finally ready to
close the door forever

9
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:10,083

10

And Goku tried
his own steady job,

11
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,708
toiling as a farmer
in the field.

12
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:17,625
But when he learned Vegeta had
spent the last six months

13
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:20,208
training with Whis,
Goku couldn't handle

14
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:22,875
falling behind
in the race for power.

15
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:27,458
So despite Chichi's protests,
Goku left with Whis as well.

16
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:31,416
The two mighty Saiyans will
attempt to train side-by-side

Sorry, my bad.

But how are we supposed
to change his sheets

without waking him up?

161

We bide our time.

Ow, that hurt!

For a guy who likes
to nap for years at a time,

he sure is a light sleeper.

Nothing light
about that tail, though.

We're waiting for Beerus

That alarm's going to explode!

do something with this?

How can he attack like that
while he's sleeping?

It's like he knows
exactly what he's doing.

Who said this was
the training?

All we've been doing...

This is the price we pay

[VEGETA] These are
the Seer's fishbowls.

each one by hand.

I'll finish my chores first,

I have a new

Wait, you got me
a new outfit?

You'll find that it
fits you precisely,

261
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,375
and I stayed with the orange
and blue you seem to like.

262
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:27,750
Every detail
has been tailored

263
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:30,208
with your specific
fighting style in mind.

264
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,500
I would have made Vegeta one
but Bulma gave him

265
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:35,166
that armor and I assume
it has sentimental value.

it to your liking, Goku.

to break it in now?

Yeah. Let's do this.

272
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,375
So the goal's
to put our arms through

273
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:07,958
and lift as high
as we can, right?

00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:10,083
Yes.

All right,
Whis, here I go!

Oh man! It's so heavy,
I can't lift it at all!

If you could do it easily,

278
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:22,625
then it wouldn't be
training, now would it?

Use your head, Kakarot.

280

these, which I've mastered.

What the--?

283
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,541
Sorry, Vegeta. But you
got too comfortable

284
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,708
training with these,
so I doubled the weight.

285
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,500
What? Doubled it?

There we go!

That's the spirit.
Now keep holding them up

flying will help

It's just about time!

317
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,166
Very good, Seer.
Thank you.

[VEGETA]
What?

320
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,250
[GOKU]
How'd we get back here?

[GOKU chuckles]

325
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,500
Looks like they were
just able to avoid it.

326
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,083
I'm glad it worked out.

327
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:50,916
Another successful day
of training in the books.

328
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,791
[GOKU]
I am beat!

329
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,333
That's really
impressive, Vegeta.

330
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:55,916
I can't believe
you've had to face Beerus

331
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,333
blasting you in his sleep
every day you've been here!

332
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,291
His power was
totally unchecked!

333
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,625
I thought we were
finished for sure!

334
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,458
If you've lost
your nerve, go home!

335
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:07,708
Oh, I haven't lost
my nerve! This is great!

336
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:10,958
Or at least the actual training
part of the day is great.

337
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:13,833
It's all those chores
I'm not sure I can handle.

338
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,916
I don't have to do
any of this stuff at home,

339
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,875
so I don't really
know how, ya know?

340
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,750
[VEGETA grunts]

341
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,250
Well, I certainly
hope you don't think

342
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,875
that tactic's
going to work on me.

343
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,750
I'm dragging you out of bed
at six, so be ready!

344
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:29,208
--[GOKU snores]
--[VEGETA grunts]

345
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:32,291
[SEER] Are you sure you're not
training them a little too hard?

346
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,166
They're not deities, you know.

347
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,458
If you keep this up, you really
might end up killing them.

348
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,083
You could at least
let them do their little

349
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,208
Super Saiyan business.

350
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,375
That's not an option, Seer.

351
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:44,750
Why not?

352
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,083
They've just barely reached
a level where they're

353
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,958
starting to sense divine energy,

354
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,958
and they have a long way to go.

355
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:53,375
Look up there. Let's say
the top of our lovely castle

356
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,541
represents divine power.

357
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,125
The Saiyans' power

358
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,583
is about at the height
of this tree.

359
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:01,291
They need to push
far beyond the limits

360
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:02,958
of strength
as they know them.

361
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,875
Right now, relying on
the Super Saiyan boost

362
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,500
would get in the way.

363
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,208
They've become dependent on it

364
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,541
and it masks the roots
of their shortcomings.

365
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,875
I believe they
understand that already.

366
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:16,125
I haven't told them
not to "go Super Saiyan,"

367
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:19,125
and yet they've both chosen
not to, on their own.

368
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:22,125
Aw...
Whatever you think is best.

369
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:23,625
Just don't kill them, okay?

370
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,125
Well this is unusual.

371
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,916
I've never known
an Oracle Fish that was

372
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,166
so concerned
about lowly mortals.

373
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,708
[SEER]
I like having them here.

374
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,625
Ever since they came around,
I've been getting more snacks.

375
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:36,083
[WHIS] Ah, I should've
known that was why.

376
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,208
[groans]

377
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:42,166
[VEGETA] You won't beat me,
Kakarot. Not this time!

378
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,958
[WHIS] For today's training,
we're going to spice things up.

379
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,875
I want the two of you to try
attacking me at the same time.

380
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,041
Wow, you're gonna
fight us, really?

381
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,875
Well. This is a first.

382
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,083
Wait a second, Vegeta.

383
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,458
You mean you've been
training on this world

384
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,500
over six months, and Whis
hasn't let you fight him

385
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,000
even once the whole time?

386
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:00,125
So? What's it to you?

387
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,625
I guess he didn't think you
were ready for it yet, did he?

388
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,000
What was that?

389
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,791
Well, it's the truth;
you were not strong enough.

390
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:09,416
Of course, Goku's not
strong enough, either.

391
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,333
--I'm not?
--Oh, no, not by a long shot,

392
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:13,958
but the two of you
together might at least

393
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,916
be decent enough
to make it instructive.

394
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,791
[VEGETA, GOKU gasp]

395
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,375
Do you want to give it a try?

396
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,166
You have to ask?

397
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,625
[yells]

398
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,500
[grunts]

399
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,916
[WHIS giggles]

400
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,500
[WHIS]
All right, stop!

401
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,833
Neither of you possess
the necessary speed.

402
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,791
You two are both still
thinking before you move,

403
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,125
rather than just moving.

404
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,583
And I'm afraid this habit

405
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,791
is especially strong
with you, Vegeta.

406
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,375
All this overthinking's
limiting your fighting speed.

407
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,416
Listen, messages
only travel through

408
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,125
your nervous system so fast,

409
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:58,750
relying on thoughts
for physical action

410
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,666
costs you precious
fighting time.

411
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,500
Yeah, you really do like
to overthink stuff, Vegeta.

412
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:04,833
Oh, shut your face.

413
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:06,875
You're only thinking less
because you're an idiot.

414
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,708
The end goal for
you both should be

415
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,833
to master the ability to have
each part of your body

416
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:13,250
think and move independently
of all the other parts.

417
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,541
I admit, this is
exceedingly difficult.

418
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,500
In fact, not even Lord
Beerus has mastered this

419
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,333
completely yet, and he's a god.

420
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:21,166
But if you overcome
the learning curve,

421
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,916
you'll be able to avoid
any danger, however severe.

422
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,541
You're saying your body reacts
without you having to think?

423
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,125
[WHIS]
That's exactly right.

424
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,708
But uh, Mr. Whis,

425
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,500
it looks like you
stepped in poop.

426
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:32,833
[WHIS]
Uh!

[chuckles nervously]

428
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:35,875
Well, my feet do think
for themselves,

429
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:38,041
but I said nothing
about my shoes.

It's Planet 448, sir.

We can't keep them down
for much longer.

themselves the Frieza Force?

That's the trouble, sir.

With all the fighting
on other worlds,

440
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:58,583
we barely have any to spare.

441

Ugh! Damn it!
Disengage! Disengage now!

442

Yes, this must be it.

This time I'm sure. Go on.

446
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,250
Do I have to, my lord?

447
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:28,416
I thought you might like to
handle it yourself for a change.

448

Just do it, Vados!

[VADOS]
Hm.

450
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:40,875
[CHAMPA]
Guess I was wrong.

451
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:42,625
[VADOS] That should
have been obvious.

452
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,583
[CHAMPA] If you knew,
why didn't you tell me?

453
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:47,041
Because I also knew
that you wouldn't listen.

00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:54,333
<i>All that we dreamed of</i>

Hey! It's me, Goku!

473
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:04,416
Does Whis have some
crazy skills, or what?

474
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,875
I can't even touch him!

475
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:08,125
But just wait! I'm gonna
train harder than ever,

476
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:10,166
until I'm as powerful as he is!

477
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,666
Hold on, what was that?

478
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,625
I just a got a weird
feeling, you guys.

479
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:15,291
It's an energy
that feels familiar,

480
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:17,500
and it's definitely bad.

[GOKU] Next time,

483
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:24,250
The Return of the
Evil Emperor, Frieza!"

484
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:26,500
Make sure you don't
miss it, okay?
