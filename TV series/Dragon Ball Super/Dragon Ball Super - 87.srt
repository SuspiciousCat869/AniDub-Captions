At last, I've captured
an elusive Minotaros!

[POACHER BOSS]
Uh?

I asked you what was so funny to
have you laughing hysterically.

You say that like
it's a bad thing.

here to help you?

selling endangered animals,

not just from Earth, but
from other planets, too.

to pin them down.

did was show up

after we'd already
taken them down.

be easier for me.

be sending you one.

I'll join your team
for the tournament.

I don't like being
in debt to anybody.

I'll leave Trunks and Goten
in charge of the island

That's great!

427
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,500
Y'know, I've given it some
thought, and once we win,

428
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,666
I think I'd like to use
the Super Dragon Balls

429
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,833
to wish for a boat.

430
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,333
A boat, huh? Really.

431
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,125
What do you want that for?

432
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:42,291
[A17]
Now, when I say boat,

433
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,333
I'm talking about a
giant cruise liner,

434
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,500
the kind that costs
billions of zeni.

435
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,625
It's been my dream to
travel around the world

436
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,291
with my family someday.

437
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:51,916
Oh, yeah?

438
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,791
And what are you
gonna wish for?

439
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,041
Who, me? Really?

440
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,500
[laughs]

441
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:57,958
Oh, right, of course.

442
00:19:58,041 --> 00:19:59,791
Guess that's a
frivolous question.

443
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,000
You're only in this to
save the world, right?

444
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,250
No, see.

445
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,875
I don't think of it like
I'm saving the world.

446
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:08,291
The fact is, it's 'cause I'm
usually trying to challenge

447
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,375
the strongest
warriors I can find.

448
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,541
That's how this tournament
happened, too.

449
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:15,166
But I can't bear the thought of
innocent lives getting wiped out

450
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,000
just 'cause I wanna
fight the best.

451
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,958
So I'll do what I can for them.

452
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,833
[A17]
You are a fascinating man, Goku.

453
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,333
[GOKU]
I am?

454
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:26,458
Well, if so, it's all thanks
to the Old Man's teachings.

455
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,250
[A17]
Still, for someone like me,

456
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,125
who was engineered to kill you,

457
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:34,125
to now end up on your team,
it's an odd twist of fate.

458
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,583
It's not that odd, though.

459
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,666
Tien, Piccolo, Vegeta,

460
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,375
they all started out
as my enemies, too.

461
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:44,208
So, is my brother gonna be
on the team with us, as well?

462
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:46,583
Hold on, you have a brother?

463
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,583
You know, mister mini monk.

464
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:49,750
I mean, Krillin.

465

Oh. Right, Number 18's
your twin sister,

466
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,625
and Krillin's her husband.

467
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,333
That makes him your
brother-in-law, right?

468
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:57,708
Believe it or not, I'd never
thought of that before!

469
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,083
I believe.

00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,541
[GOKU
'Course Krillin's on the team!

00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:01,458
You should see him.

00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,000
He's all bulked up now.

473

And then there's Buu.

Who you fought with
the Spirit Bomb? That Buu?

476
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,125
That's him. But don't
worry about it.

477
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:11,333
He's changed since then.

478
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,083
He's a good guy now.

479
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:16,291
[A17] This is gonna be
one hell of a team.

480
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:18,708
[GOKU] Looks like you'll
have a bunch of folks

481
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:21,083
cheering for you back home, huh.

482
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:23,916
We're gonna have to win this
thing, no matter what it takes!

483
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,416
That's right.

484
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:33,791
[NARRATOR] At last,
Android 17 has agreed to join

485
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:37,166
the rest of the fighters on
the Seventh Universe team.

486
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,208
But can Goku and the others

487
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:42,708
emerge victorious
from the battle royale?

488
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,041
The fate of the earth
depends on it.

489
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:48,000
Only 23 hours and
20 minutes remain

490
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:50,583
until the Tournament
of Power begins.

491
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:53,166
The race to build
a team continues.

492
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:56,541
Next time on Dragon Ball Super!

493
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,208
<i>Boogie Back!</i>

494
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:10,375
<i>Wish we had better timing</i>

495
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:14,208
<i>To explore this attraction</i>

496
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,583
<i>Put on a smile, it's showtime</i>

497
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:21,250
<i>And I'm just playing a part</i>

498
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:25,291
<i>Let's get lost in the rhythm,</i>
<i>dancing dancing heart</i>

499
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:28,416
<i>Head over heels</i>
<i>I'm falling falling down</i>

500
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,500
<i>(Boogie Back!)</i>

501
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:32,125
<i>My heartbeat</i>
<i>keeps growing faster</i>

502
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:35,875
<i>Every step that I take</i>
<i>brings me back to you</i>

503
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:36,875
<i>(Boogie Back!)</i>

504
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:39,541
<i>Give me happy ever after</i>

505
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:44,375
<i>Let the dream</i>
<i>of our love come true</i>

506
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:46,250
<i>Boogie Back!</i>

507
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:48,041
<i>Boogie Back!</i>

508
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:53,708
<i>Boogie Back!</i>

509
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:55,625
<i>Boogie Back!</i>

510
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:02,458
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

511
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:03,958
Now, Piccolo, please tell me

512
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:05,958
you're entering the
Tournament of Power.

513
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:08,625
Oh, you're training
Gohan before it starts?

514
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:09,708
That's awesome!

515
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:11,125
You really are the only one

516
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:13,666
who can push that kid
beyond his limits.

517
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,666
We're counting on you, Piccolo.

518
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,625
Now Gohan, let's see
what you've got!

519
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:21,125
Next time, on Dragon Ball Super:

520
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:22,416
"Gohan and Piccolo

521
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,291
Master and Pupil Clash
in Max Training!"

522
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:27,041
Make sure you don't
miss it, okay?
