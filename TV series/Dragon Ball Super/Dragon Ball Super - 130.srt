327
00:22:30,006 --> 00:22:32,217
<i>And I'm awakened</i>

328
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,970
<i>A never-ending melody,</i>
<i>so enchanting</i>

329
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:39,724
<i>You're always the one</i>
<i>who makes me tremble</i>

330
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:44,020
<i>The meteors keep falling down</i>

331
00:22:44,104 --> 00:22:47,315
<i>Surging right into my heart</i>

332
00:22:51,486 --> 00:22:52,987
[GOKU]
Hey. It's me, Goku!

333
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:55,198
When I collapsed,
I thought we were finished.

334
00:22:55,281 --> 00:22:57,283
But no, this fight
isn't over yet.

335
00:22:57,367 --> 00:22:59,411
Our team's got one last
trick up our sleeves,

336
00:22:59,494 --> 00:23:01,413
and we just have to
hope it's enough.

337
00:23:01,496 --> 00:23:04,332
It's a shocking climax to
the Tournament of Power,

338
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:08,086
with the fate of the entire
Cosmos on the line!

339
00:23:08,169 --> 00:23:10,130
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super,

340
00:23:10,213 --> 00:23:11,756
"A Miraculous Conclusion!

341
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,342
Farewell Goku!
Until We Meet Again!"

342
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:16,511
Make sure you
don't miss it, okay?
