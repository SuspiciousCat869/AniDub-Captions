163
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,666
[JACO]
My spaceship!

164
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,041
[coughs]

165
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,958
[gasps]

166
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,916
Oh no. My favorite picture.

167
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,916
This is the real tragedy.

168
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,083
I guess all that effort
you put into training

169
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,541
was worth it, huh?

170
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:40,708
What?

171
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,166
I never would have
believed somebody could

172
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,291
get this much stronger
in just a few months!

173
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:47,291
You said I filled you with rage
and yet you're complimenting me?

174
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,875
It's exactly this
sort of absurd chatter

175
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,791
that makes me hate you so!

176
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:54,291
Going after my eyes,
Frieza, really?

177
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,875
[FRIEZA] Of course.
I told you, this isn't

178
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,875
some game where we play nice.

179
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,041
This is revenge,
you reeking ape!

180
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,500
Tch! What are those
imbeciles doing?

181
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,416
How long are they
going to warm up?

182
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,500
[FRIEZA] While we're
drudging up past remarks,

183
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:07,833
I couldn't help
but eavesdrop on your

184
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,833
father-son moment earlier.

185
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,625
You told him
the Namekian Dragon Balls

186
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:14,333
could be used to bring your
green friend back to life.

187
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,500
Yeah. So, what if I did?

188
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:17,916
I simply want you
to know that won't

189
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,166
be an option, and I'll
make sure of it myself.

190
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,666
After I'm done with you,

191
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,958
I'm not only going to annihilate
this planet's Dragon Balls

192
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:27,083
but the Namekians'
enchanted orbs as well.

193
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:28,833
No one's coming back.

194
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,958
Ha! Just when I think
you can't get more evil

195
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:34,500
you go and surprise me again.

196
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:35,875
[grunts]

197
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:39,583
But it doesn't matter.
I'll never let that happen!

198
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:52,791
You're going
to need more power.

199
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:56,583
[FRIEZA] Funny. That's exactly
what I was about to tell you!

200
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,833
--[GOKU hollers]
--[FRIEZA] Huh?

201
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:12,291
[groans]
Huh?

202
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,666
[grunts]

203
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,666
Come on, Vegeta!
What was that?

204
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,250
[FRIEZA]
Hmm?

205
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:39,541
Damn you, clown!
Enough already!

206
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:42,166
Sorry, but enough
of what, already?

207
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,125
[VEGETA yells]

208
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:47,791
Stop it!
Why are you fighting me?

209
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,041
Shut up! Like you don't know!

210
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,333
[chuckles]

211
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,458
Well, how flattering.

212
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,416
It seems no matter
how far a pet strays

213
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,958
he never forgets
who holds the leash.

214
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,291
What's Vegeta up to?

215
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,666
If that's a strategy
it's way too clever for me.

216
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,666
I have no idea.

217
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,166
What the hell is he thinking?

218
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,208
We're trying to
stop a damn invasion!

219
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,333
Did he hit his head
too many times while training

220
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,083
and turn his brain into mush?

221
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,291
I think his brain's
been mush for a while now.

222
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,166
Wait, is it possible?

223
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:19,500
[TIEN] He served
Frieza a long time.

224
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,416
We can't know
how that changed him.

225
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,916
Now his old master's back,
stronger than ever.

226
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,083
Could he have gone back
to Frieza's side?

227
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,875
That's my husband
we're talking about!

228
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:31,166
There's no way
he would ever betray us!

229
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,333
[KRILLIN]
I'm with Bulma.

230
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,458
Vegeta would never
turn against his family.

231
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,000
He's one of us now.

232
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,333
[TIEN] Well, I sure
hope you're right.

233
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,250
[GOKU gasps]

234
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,916
Come on. What's wrong
with you? Talk to me!

235
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,750
[FRIEZA]
Yes, Vegeta, talk.

236
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,375
We're all dying to know
what's going through

237
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,166
that head of yours.

238
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,958
You always had
a pragmatic streak.

239
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,833
Did you realize
you're on the losing side

240
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:07,583
and want to return
to your old master?

241
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:10,458
Congratulations on
coming back to life, Frieza.

242
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:14,875
That couldn't
have been easy. Bravo!

243
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:22,000
[claps]

244
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,666
You may hold
a smattering of applause,

245
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,875
although I do deserve it.

246
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:30,833
[clapping echoes]

247
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,916
[snarls]

248
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,708
What is this? Now Vegeta
wants my job, too?

249
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:46,458
[FRIEZA chuckles]
Hm?

250
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,708
[VEGETA chuckles]

251
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:51,250
I'm all for you showing
respect, Saiyan Prince.

252
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,291
But how long are you
going to keep that up;

253
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:56,625
it's starting to bother me!

254
00:15:56,708 --> 00:16:01,958
You're offending my ears.
Knock it off!

255
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,541
[VEGETA] Your mere existence
offends me, Frieza.

256
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,541
Why don't you quit that?

257
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,250
What did you say to me?

258
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,833
You come to my home
whining about

259
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,375
a few months of effort.

260
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:21,125
And have the nerve
to talk of <i>your</i> revenge?

261
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:24,291
You should keep your mouth shut!

262
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:28,041
[grunts]
No one speaks to me like that.

263
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:32,541
[bellows]

264
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,166
[VEGETA] How long did you
think I'd stand aside

265
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,083
while you screw around
with your training wheels on?

266
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,833
Don't ask me to be patient
if you won't even

267
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,250
use your full power!

268
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,791
I'll kick the crap
out of both of you!

269
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:49,666
Oh, okay, Vegeta, so that's
what this is about?

270
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,458
You really shouldn't
worry me like that.

271
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,250
Man, I thought it was way worse.

272
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:56,500
It's not funny! I didn't stop
my training to come here

273
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:59,125
so I could just watch this
fight from the sideline!

274
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:01,041
That's why you attacked him?

275
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,291
What a miserable
disappointment you are, Vegeta.

276
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:04,625
For a moment
I thought you and I

277
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,250
could have some fun again.

278
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,750
I always thought
you shone brightest

279
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,375
while I was
keeping you as my pet.

280
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,625
Like a tiny insect
glowing in a jar.

281
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,958
[chuckles]

282
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,875
I was never
your servant, Frieza.

283
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,000
I only used you
for my own agenda.

284
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,583
Whatever helps you
sleep at night.

285
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,041
I really don't care,
so long as you

286
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,625
don't interfere with
my revenge against Goku.

287
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,250
If killing him's
so important to you

288
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,791
then why don't you
get on with it?

289
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,250
Because I had
to wait a long time

290
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,125
and I only get to do this once.

291
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,875
You can't blame me for wanting
to savor it, can you?

292
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,583
This is my special day, Vegeta,

293
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,125
and I need you
to wait a while longer

294
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,708
so I can make sure
it goes exactly as planned.

295
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,541
I'll be more than happy
to murder you after that.

296
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:44,791
Ha! I would sure as hell
love to see you try.

297
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,083
But, just don't
blow him off 'cause of

298
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,958
all the crazy stuff
we've been through.

299
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,541
I don't know how he managed it,

300
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,250
but he's a whole lot
stronger than before.

301
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,458
[VEGETA] Really? You think
I can't sense that?

302
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:55,416
Clearly you have
been through "crazy stuff"

303
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,083
as you so
eloquently describe it.

304
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:58,833
I heard of your
defeating Majin Buu

305
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,750
so it was obvious
you'd improved yourself,

306
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,958
but you're even stronger
than I guessed.

307
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,666
[GOKU] Well, don't say
I didn't warned ya.

308
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,291
Fine. I'll give you
more time to fight.

309
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:08,791
But I won't wait much longer

310
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,458
so you'd better
both make it count!

311
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,250
I actually thought
I had a decent shot

312
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,708
at taking you on without
powering up, Frieza.

313
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:18,166
I guess that was
pretty dumb, huh?

314
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,250
Well it's a bad idea
to piss off Vegeta,

315
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,791
so I'd better get serious.

316
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:28,666
Good thing I trained so hard
or I might be frightened.

317
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,250
[laughs]

318
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,625
I knew it! You've been
holding back

319
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:34,041
something major, haven't you?

320
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,291
[FRIEZA chuckles]

321
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:40,083
That's well-deduced for
such a simpleton.

322
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,666
Indeed. The same as you have.

323
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,375
Then how 'bout
we do like Vegeta says

324
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,708
and go all in.

325
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,708
No more tricks
and no reserves, okay?

326
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:50,416
Very well.
Go ahead, monkeys first.

327
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,916
Are you sure about that?

328
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,333
I'd really hate for you
to get discouraged.

329
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,041
[chuckles]

330
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:59,083
But fine, Frieza,
I'll show you first.

331
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,875
You know I can sense that,
so don't even try it.

332
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,125
Just having some fun.

333
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,750
[gasps]

334
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,875
[bellows]

335
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:39,625
[FRIEZA grunts]

336
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:44,458
[ALL grunt]

337
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,291
[VEGETA grunts]

338
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,666
[snarls]

339
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,291
I'm not sensing
Goku at all anymore;

340
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,208
it's like his energy
just vanished.

341
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,416
That happened when
he was a Super Saiyan God.

342
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,291
Did he learn
how to do that again?

343
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:36,250
No, I think it's something
different; look at him.

344
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:39,166
His hair. His aura. It's blue.

345
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,375
A good point. I remember
when he was fighting

346
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,375
with Lord Beerus it was red.

347
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:44,583
That ceremony on the ship

348
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,500
basically turned him
into a deity.

349
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,583
Is it possible
he's even stronger now?

350
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:49,875
This is total insanity.

351
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,333
How far is Goku gonna go
before he's satisfied?

352
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,208
Well, at least we get to watch.

353
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,791
[KING KAI] So, he's got the
power of a Super Saiyan God,

354
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,250
but now he doesn't
even need energy

355
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:01,083
from the rest of the
Saiyans to get him there?

356
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,666
[sighs] What kind of
training were they doing

357
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,833
on Lord Beerus' world?
And why'd they think

358
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:07,916
that was a good idea?

359
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,916
[snarls]

360
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,666
That's a decent form,
I suppose.

361
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,666
Don't try to
sell it short, Frieza.

362
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,625
You and I both know
it's an incredible jump.

363
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,458
It's changed
my whole idea of power.

364
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,291
So what are you calling
this precious level:

365
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,458
Super Saiyan with blue hair dye?

366
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:25,333
[chuckles]
That's funny.

367
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,625
I'd say it's a little more
complicated than that.

368
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:28,791
I know you don't
have the patience

369
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,666
for the full story, Frieza.

370
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,208
But I got a taste of something
called Super Saiyan God

371
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,250
and then tapped into
that power on my own,

372
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,625
and it's the
Super Saiyan level of that.

373
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,000
[FRIEZA] So, a Super Saiyan
who's as strong as

374
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,625
a Super Saiyan God yet
is not a Super Saiyan God

375
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:44,125
is now the Super Saiyan
version of that?

376
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,708
You really do need to work
on your descriptions, Goku.

377
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:49,750
I nearly bit my tongue just
trying to spit it all out.

378
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,875
Well, I've held up
my side of the deal

379
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:54,333
and shown you my real power.

380
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:56,041
It's your turn.

381
00:21:57,666 --> 00:22:00,958
<i>I look back</i>
<i>to when I was young</i>


382
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:04,083
<i>Reminisce on all that I've done</i>


383
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:06,458
<i>In my hands, I held</i>


384
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:11,208
<i>The dreams of my childhood,</i>

385
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:14,750
<i>So let's ride upon</i>

386
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,375
<i>A world we've never known</i>


387
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:23,000
<i>(It's a brand new story)</i>
<i>Now, a new chapter starts</i>


388
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,375
<i>Shining Star</i>


389

391

<i>Give me strength</i>
<i>from your light up above</i>


395
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:43,208
<i>Show me the way to be brave</i>


396
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:49,458
<i>My hands still hold onto hope</i>

397

<i>All that we dreamed of</i>


398
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:01,916
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

399
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,833
I can never forgive Frieza for
the terrible things he's done,

400
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:07,416
but I have to admit
his power's impressive.

401
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,000
His speed and strength
are about the same as mine.

402
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:11,625
And with his brand new form,

403
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:13,708
is it possible
he's even stronger?

404
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:15,583
This could be really bad news!

405
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:17,958
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

406
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:22,333
"A Full-Throttle Battle!
The Vengeful Golden Frieza"!

407
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:24,583
Make sure you don't
miss it, okay?
