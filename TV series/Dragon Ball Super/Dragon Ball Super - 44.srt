for you in no time.

160
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,833
What is this place anyway?

161
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,500
We're on Planet Pot-au-feu.

162
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,041
Planet Pot-au-feu, huh?

163
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,166
I've never even
heard of it before.

164
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,291
--[POTAGE yelling]
--What the--?

165
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,125
[POTAGE, MONAKA]
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

166
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:21,166
Oh, that really hurt.

167
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,000
Oh? It's Monaka!

168
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,291
Hey there, Potage.

169
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,666
I have this
"Space Martial Arts Monthly"

170
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,125
magazine you ordered.

171
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,833
Thank you for choosing us
for all your shipping needs

172
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:35,166
and please consider using us
again in the future.

173
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,583
Monaka!

174
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:39,625
Ow! Hey!

175
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:43,750
Mm? That's weird.
What's wrong with his foot?

176
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,750
It's been way too long
since I've seen you!

177
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:46,958
So how have you been?

178
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,666
Looks like you have
lost some weight.

179
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,958
[MONAKA]
Uhh...

180
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,625
Really, old man?
You thought you could

181
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:57,583
get away from me that easily?
I'm disappointed.

182
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:00,125
[POTAGE] Oh, no! I was so
excited to see you, Monaka,

183
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,291
I forgot all about
those bastards!

184
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,958
Aren't you gonna introduce us
to your friends over there?

185
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,541
Whoa, who are
those ugly dudes?

186
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:11,166
[grunts]

187
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,666
Uuh...

188
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,291
These good people
have nothing to do with us!

189
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:23,083
I'm the one you have
unfinished business with!

190
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,208
They about to fight?

191
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,125
That stance of his
looks pretty strong.

192
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,166
It does.

193
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,625
That doesn't matter.
Let 'em have it.

194
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,291
[screams, hollers]

195
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,916
[MONAKA]
Uuuagh!

196
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,416
Well, guess gramps
isn't so tough after all!

197
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,458
Looks like Monaka
just collapsed, too.

198
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,958
--What the--?
--Get 'em, Goten!

199
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,416

Yeah!

00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,166

[screams]

203
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:59,083
I don't know who these
guys are, but fall back!

204
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,541
[TRUNKS] Hey, where you
running off to, scaredy-cats?

205
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:04,666
If you want a real fight,
we'll take you on anytime!

206
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,333
[GRYLL GOON 44A]
Hm?

207
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,000
[chuckles]

208
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,750
Oh, I cannot believe
how strong you boys are.

209
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,708
So strong, in fact, that for a
second you took my breath away.

210
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,208
Are you kidding?
That was nothing.

211
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,833
We coulda taken on hundreds
of guys like that, easy.

212
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:21,958
Yep!

213
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,250
Hundreds you say?

214
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,708
Okay so tell us,
who were those jerks anyway?

215
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,541
No-good thieves.
Plunderers who came

216
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,291
to rob this planet
of the tremendous power

217
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,625
that lies within.

218
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,875
So, wait, there's some kinda
hidden power here?

219
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,666
Yes, and I protect it
with the help of this.

220
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,750
It's gone! It's gone!

221
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,541
I--I must have
dropped it somewhere.

222
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,958
This is a disaster!
If they got their hands on it,

223
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,041
we're in serious trouble!

224
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,291
Say, I sure would
appreciate it if you boys

225
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,833
could come with me.
There's just no way

226
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:59,208
I can defeat those guys
all on my own.

227
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,125
Yeah, no sweat.

228
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:04,791
Hey, Monaka, wait here!
We'll be back in no time, okay!

229
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:08,250
Hey, Monaka?

230
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:11,000
Oh my, the poor guy's out cold.

231
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:21,666
[POTAGE] Is it here?
Or is it here? It's not here.

232
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:25,791
[GRYLL] Is this
what you're looking for?

233
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:26,916
[chuckles]

234
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,583
Hey, where did you get that?

235
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,291
Uh, Trunks,
am I wrong or is that

236
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,916
just a plain old pacifier
like babies use?

237
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,541
Sure looks like it,
but seems like that one's

238
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,625
pretty important to this guy
for some reason.

239
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,583
[POTAGE]
Ah. If I don't do something,

240
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,750
then the Superhuman
Water will be...

241
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:43,166
You just need to get that little
pacifier thing back, right?

242
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,708
Well, leave it to us.
Ready, Goten?

243
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:46,666
You bet!

244
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,416
Might wanna wait.

245
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,041
--[MONAKA sniffs, sobs]
--[GRYLL chuckles]

246
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,416
No, they've got Monaka!

247
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,916
I'm really sorry, you guys!

248
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,916
Superhuman Water.
A miraculous tonic that is said

249
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,958
to increase anyone's power
hundreds of times over.

250
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,208
And I thought Videl's
toilet water was fancy.

251
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,375
A miraculous tonic, meh!

252
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,375
It's a fairy tale,
you understand?

253
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,666
And if you break that seal,
all that will happen

254
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,291
is you'll be swallowed up!

255
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:19,041
Man, it'd be so easy for us
to bust outta these ropes.

256
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:22,041
If only there weren't
hostages to worry about.

257
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,666
[GRYLL]
Open it. Heh.

258
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,000
So this is the
Superhuman Water!

259
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:45,833
Now that I have it,
the universe will be mine! Hm?

260
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:51,416
Uh!
[screams]

261
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,125
[VEGETA] What?
Trunks and Goten stowed away

262
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,500
on Monaka's vessel?

263
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,333
Yeah, they were supposed
to be back home a while ago,

264
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:11,541
but when I couldn't
find them anywhere...

265
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,375
...I got worried something
might have happened to them,

266
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,416
so I checked
the security footage

267
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,875
and it showed them
climbing into the back

268
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,291
of Monaka's delivery truck
right before he took off.

269
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:24,833
Damn it. That's what happens
when you order all that garbage.

270
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,166
You've gotta be kidding.

271
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,125
You're saying it's my fault
they snuck onboard?

272
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,500
What? I said
nothing of the kind.

273
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:30,625
You're twisting my words.

274
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,083
[BULMA]
But that's what you meant!

275
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,708
You think Trunks is gone
because I have a sweet tooth

276
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,333
and believe
in galactic commerce!

277
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,333
Forgive me for interrupting
your little marital spat,

278
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,458
but if you don't need me,
I'll be leaving.

279
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,666
She calls me halfway
across the galaxy for this?

280
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,666
[BULMA] Wait a minute,
Jaco, come on.

281
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,958
Don't be upset with me.

282
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,875
You know you're
the only one I can turn to.

283
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,708
--You're my hero.
--[JACO] Hmph!

284
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,250
I mean you're so brave!

285
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,541
Would you save the day
and pick up

286
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,250
Trunks and Goten for me?

287
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:55,666
[JACO]
Huh?

288
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,541
Monaka said he was headed
to Planet Pot-au-feu next,

289
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,416
so that's probably
where they are now.

290
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,916
Wait, Pot-au-feu? That's odd.

291
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,916
Nobody is supposed
to be living there.

292
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,875
But regardless,
I have to say no.

293
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,041
Huh?

294
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,458
[JACO] Ma'am, I am
a Galactic Patrolman.

295
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,458
One of the select few
chosen to protect the galaxy

296
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,125
and maintain inter-system peace.

297
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,458
I am not a super elite
bus driver.

298
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:16,041
Who cares what your title is?
You're not doing anything.

299
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,166
Ugh, how rude!
And for your information,

300
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,041
I'm currently on
an important mission.

301
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:23,958
To find and arrest Gryll
the Sautéan: a vicious thug!

302
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,708
Hm!

303
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:30,916
Hmm. Oh, come on.
Can't you get to that later?

304
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,416
Are you serious?
Clearly you have no idea

305
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,291
how evil and dangerous
this rogue is

306
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,250
or else you wouldn't
suggest such a thing.

307
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,125
In order to keep
our fine galaxy safe,

308
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,541
it's my duty to apprehend
this violent criminal

309
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,375
as quickly as possible.

310
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,166
[BULMA] No way I can
change your mind?

311
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,458
Absolutely not.

312
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:50,333
Well then, maybe I should
ask the Galactic King.

313
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:53,291
I could tell him how you drew
a mustache on his picture.
