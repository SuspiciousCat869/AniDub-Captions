Using them is quite easy.

62
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,333
But first you must locate them,
spread across the vast expanse

Then once they've
been collected,

you must speak
in the divine tongue.

"Come forth, divine dragon
and grant my wish,

Once you say that,

the Divine Dragon
will be summoned forth

75

to defeat an enemy

sustain damage?

C'mon, we'll think of something.

162

Think of what, you imbecile?
There's no way!

163

Maybe we'll all
become invincible, too.

Wait a sec.
What do you mean by that?

165
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,916
You really think
that's possible?

166
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,875
Yeah, you betcha.
We just need to bring

--[PILAF, SHOU] Uh?

184

So then what?
What happened to her?

185
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:48,250
I'm sorry. We only
barely made it back,

186
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,291
and I couldn't
convince her to join us.

187
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,666
Does that mean--?

188
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,541
You've got nothing
to worry about, Mai.

189
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:56,083
Your future self isn't
gonna give up that easily.

190
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,250
Yeah, the kid's right!

191
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,416
Your future self
is super strong!

192
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,958
'Course we've never
actually met her.

193
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:06,041
Yeah. I know she'll make it--
she's proven that much.

194
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:09,416
She's helped me escape
to this time twice now.

195
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,875
And I'm gonna stop those
monsters and return the favor.

196
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:17,750
Sounds good.
But if Zamasu's invincible,

197
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,750
how can you win?

198
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,916
[WHIS]
Good evening.

199
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,250
Whoa, you're back!

200
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,833
And this time you've got
Supreme Kai with you, too?

201
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,541
[WHIS]
Please forgive the intrusion.

202
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,500
But do you know
if Goku is nearby?

203
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,916
Our most honorable Supreme Kai
tells us there's something

204
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,833
he needs to say to him.

205
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,583
It's most important.

206
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:41,708
[WHIS]
Mm!

207
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,666
Aaah!

208
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,000
What is this?

209
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,666
[MAI, PILAF, SHOU chuckle]

210
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:54,416
[GOKU] Yo, Supreme Kai. Did you
need to tell me somethin'?

211
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,083
If the Kai charged with
overseeing our whole universe

212
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,000
has come all the way
here to talk,

213
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,875
I'm pretty sure
it won't be good.

214
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,791
As it so happens,
I received a message

215
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:06,833
from an expert collector
of information named Zuno.

216
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,250
You mean Master Zuno?

217
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,791
How's he doing these days?

218
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,541
He's doing fine now, I suppose.

219
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,250
But according to his message,

220
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,291
someone travelled
an incredibly long distance

221
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,166
to ask him about
the Super Dragon Balls.

222
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,791
And about Goku.

223
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:23,833
Somebody asked about me?
Do you know who it is?

224
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,583
Your old pal Zamasu.

225
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,416
Zamasu, really?

226
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,250
Why would <i>he</i> be asking
about the Super Dragon Balls?

227
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,708
Sounds like we have
something we need

228
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,333
to share with you, too, then.

229
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:35,916
And just what
would that be, Saiyan?

230
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,250
My goodness,
is it empty already?

231
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:45,833
Zamasu, I'm in need
of another pot of tea!

232
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:48,916
Zamasu?

233
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,708
Zamasu?

234
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:55,166
Where in the world did he go?

235
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,791
Zamasu assaulted you?

236
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,458
And he's literally invincible?

237
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:01,041
A transformation called
Super Saiyan Rosé?

238
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:04,625
That sounds like a tasty
flavor of ice cream.

239
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,083
--[BEERUS chuckles]
--[SUPREME KAI gasps]

240
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,666
Considering what
we're dealing with,

241
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,708
we could really use your advice.
How do you get rid of a deity?

242
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,875
Goodness. That's a
rather casual request

243
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:14,916
for something so dreadful.

244
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,791
I could take that as a threat
against me, too, Bulma.

245
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,916
Come on, you know
this is an emergency!

246
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,916
[BULMA, BEERUS growling]

247
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,333
Well, this is perplexing.

248
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:30,958
If Zamasu and Black aren't
the same being after all...

249
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:34,625
...then why are their
energies so much alike?

250
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:38,166
Two individuals could have
similar energies by coincidence.

251
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,833
Indeed, but the odds
would be most extraordinary.

252
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,875
There are two stories here.

253
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:45,791
Zuno's and Goku's
from the future.

254
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:48,958
Put together, they suggest
some intriguing possibilities.

255
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,166
[BULMA]
Huh?

256
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,791
Sounds like you've got a theory.

257
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,541
What are you
waiting for? Tell us!

258
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:56,541
She's right, Whis. Stop milking
the drama and speak.

259
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,125
Of course.

260
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,041
Consider what we know
has transpired

261
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,333
in the two timelines.

262
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:05,708
Zamasu, a Kai heralded for
his gifts as a fighter,

263
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,666
was defeated by Goku
in a sparring match

264
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,875
and has since gone out of
his way to question Zuno

265
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:13,166
about the Saiyan,
suggesting a strong fixation.

266
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,458
Why research an opponent
who bested him?

267
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:18,166
Could he want
that power for himself?

268
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,125
Perhaps he imagines
he could accomplish

269
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,958
his own ambitions
with such might.

270
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,791
His own brand of justice.

271
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,875
<i>I</i> believe Zamasu
seeks a collaborator

272
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:28,583
with the offensive power
he's realized he lacks.

273
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:31,333
He also would like to make
himself harder to defeat.

274
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,583
His intention
is to achieve both.

00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,791
Yes. That's correct, Goku.

280
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,625
He'll need the great power
of those orbs

for something other
than a head-butt.

285

Think! That dragon can grant
any wish Zamasu makes,

286
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:56,833
which explains
the mystery we haven't

been able to crack

00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,083
[BULMA] This is no time
for a victory lap!

300
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,750
There's a bad guy out there
with the same strength as you,

301
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,291
and we don't know
how to stop him!

302
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:44,208
Of course at this point, this is
nothing more than a theory.

303
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,833
But it fits what we know so far.

304
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:49,750
Black could be
a magical copy of Goku,

305
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:53,416
created with the limitless power
of the Super Dragon Balls.

306
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,041
Give me a servant
who possesses the same body

307
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,666
and fighting power
as the Saiyan Goku!

308
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,458
It explains things well,
for the most part.

309
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,958
You're saying Black
is Kakarot's doppleganger?

310
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:08,166
Yeah, but why would this
Zamasu-guy pick Goku?

311
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,458
Like I said,

312
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:12,208
Goku defeated Zamasu
in battle when we visited.

313
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,875
The Kai must have taken
special interest in him then.

So this is your fault
for picking another fight?

00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,958
Aw come on, I wouldn't
exactly put it like that.

316
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:22,666
And then
after Black is created,

317
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,166
Zamasu will wait
for another year.

318
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:29,125
Until the Super Dragon Balls
become active once again.

319
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:33,791
Emoc hitirof, enivid nogarid,
dina tinarig yim sihiwi.

320
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,833
Peas and carrots.

321
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:43,333
[ZAMASU] Give unto me
the power of invincibility!

322
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:54,833
[chuckles]
Now I'm ready.

323
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:59,000
[ZAMASU]
I have an invincible body

324
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:04,250
and the offensive power of Goku
to eliminate all mortals!

325
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:08,208
At last I have the means
to carry out divine justice.

326
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:11,250
Once empowered,
Zamasu and Black will launch

327
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:14,333
their attack on the earth
in Trunks' future.

328
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,375
Waiting a year between wishes
would take some real patience.

329
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:21,875
Yeah, as angry
as he must be,

330
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,583
it's hard to believe
he'd wait that long.

331
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:26,291
Plus all the time tracking down
the Super Dragon Balls,

332
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,875
not once but twice?

333
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,375
It's hard enough
to search a planet,

334
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,416
let alone across two universes!

335
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,208
That's some major perseverance.

336
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:36,291
I'd get way too bored.

337
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:39,125
But wait, of course!
He has that Time Ring!

338
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:40,541
If he uses that handy thing,

339
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:43,333
then he wouldn't have to wait
a year between wishes!

340
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,458
That's correct, my lord.
He could simply travel

341
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,416
a year into
the future instantly.

342
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,125
But Black's the one
wearing it, right?

343
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:50,375
How'd he get to use it?

344
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,166
[BEERUS groans]
I hate riddles.

345
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,333
Why can't you ask him yourself?

346
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,458
Well, I guess if Zamasu gets it,

347
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:59,083
then he <i>could</i> let Black
borrow it, couldn't he?

348
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,208
[BEERUS grunts]
We've already covered this--

349
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,833
Time Rings can only
be used by Supreme Kais.

350
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:06,625
It's not like checking
things out from a library.

351
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,458
Plus, the Zamasu in our time

352
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:11,041
is only a Supreme Kai
in training--

353
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:13,750
he couldn't use it either.

354
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:17,208
So this neat little theory
still doesn't explain the Ring.

355
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:18,833
We don't know
how Black wears it,

356
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,916
but we can explain
how Zamasu does.

357
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,958
He's either named Supreme Kai
between now and then,

358
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,625
or he takes the title.

359

--You don't mean...
--[GOKU] Uh.

362
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,208
You believe Gowasu, Supreme Kai
of the Tenth Universe,

363
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,916
is in imminent danger, is that
what you're suggesting?

364
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,666
Okay, I missed that.
Why would he be in danger?

365

Why don't you use
that brilliance you showed us

[GOKU]
Hmmm...

368
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,791
Oh, come on! It's obvious!

369
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,000
Zamasu is prob'ly
gonna kill his master

370
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,833
to become the new Supreme Kai!

371
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:55,291
He'll take the Time Ring
right off Gowasu's finger,

372
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,625
then be able to use it
however he wants!

373

Is that clear enough for ya?

374
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,708
[GOKU]
Hmm. Wow, that's messed up.

375
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,708
So you really think
Zamasu's turning into

376
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:07,625
that bad of a guy, huh?
He sure fooled me.

377
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:10,291
If we're right,
Zamasu ruins my future.

378
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,916
And he claims it's all
in the name of justice.

379
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Nobody who trumpets justice
ever turns out to be rightous.

I'm gonna look Zamasu in
the eyes and find out for sure.

383
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,250
It's hardly settled.
We still haven't explained

384
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:28,875
Black wearing the Ring or why
their energies feel so alike.

385
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:32,208
True, my lord. If Black's
a copy of Goku as we suspect,

386
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,875
why is his energy
so akin to Zamasu's?

all be answered in due time.

I'm more concerned

00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,208
He's still a young Kai.

469
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,416
I have already
put those doubts to rest.

470
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,833
Doubts, you say?

471
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:50,125
Zamasu is in the process
of learning his divine duties.

472
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,958
And in due time, he will
oversee the Tenth Universe

473
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:56,208
as its Supreme Kai,
as I have for eons.

474
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,208
What is the meaning
of mortality?

475
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:01,250
Of wisdom? What is
the essence of godhood?

476
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:04,166
We watch the ups and downs
of countless worlds,

477
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,625
and questions arise.

478
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:08,166
He and I maintain
a healthy dialogue.

479
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,500
[BEERUS] Questions.
That's a gentle way to put it.

480
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:11,958
And you're saying
those "questions"

481
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,583
have been put to rest?

482
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:17,458
[GOWASU] Yes. Right now,
his soul is perfectly clear.

483
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:21,041
For a time he was apprehensive--
about a Kai's role,

484
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,291
about the interplay
between good and evil,

485
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:25,541
and his own desire for justice.

486
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,791
But I have helped him
understand the perspective

487
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:31,208
necessary for a Supreme Kai,
and he has opened the door

488
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,583
that leads to enlightenment.

489
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,500
Huh?

490
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:42,791
Zamasu!

491
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:55,750
Gowasu, I have
brought your tea, master.

492
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:00,000
<i>Get ready!</i>
<i>Instant Transmission!</i>

493
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,541
<i>Two fingers placed</i>
<i>right between the eyes</i>

494
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:04,958
<i>Get ready!</i>
<i>My hair will stand up!</i>

495
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:07,541
<i>'Cause I got</i>
<i>all the power of a Saiyan!</i>

496
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:08,875
<i>Ohhhh HEY!</i>

497
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:11,166
<i>YOKA YOKA DANCE! (HEY!)</i>
<i>YOKA YOKA DANCE! (HEY!)</i>

498
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,708
<i>YOKA YOKA YOKA YOKA YOKA YOKA</i>
<i>DANCE! (KAMEHAMEHA!)</i>

499
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,291
<i>YOKA YOKA DANCE! (HEY!)</i>
<i>YOKA YOKA DANCE! (HEY!)</i>

500
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:18,833
<i>YOKA YOKA YOKA YOKA</i>
<i>YOKA YOKA YOKA YOKA</i>

501
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:21,333
<i>DANCE! It's what you need</i>

502
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:23,750
<i>Feel the magic of the beat</i>
<i>(Woo-hoo)</i>

503
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:26,291
<i>DANCE! It makes you smile</i>

504
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:28,666
<i>Nothing else can</i>
<i>quite compete (yoka yoka)</i>

505
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,958
<i>So when the world is lame</i>

506
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:31,416
<i>Don't play that game</i>

507
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,791
<i>You know that every problem</i>
<i>can be answered the same</i>

508
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:36,708
<i>Just let go and feel the rhythm</i>

509
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:39,125
<i>Everybody dance</i>
<i>with all your might!</i>

510
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:43,916
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

511
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,166
And this drama in the Tenth
Universe feels pretty intense.

512
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:50,250
Does Zamasu really plan
to overthrow his own master?

513
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:53,125
Because if so, we can't just
stand here and let it happen!

514
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:54,291
We've gotta stop this guy,

515
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:56,625
but our Supreme Kai
says we need proof!

516
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,958
If we wait any longer, though,
it could be too late!

517
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:02,333
[GOKU] Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

518
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:06,333
"Protect the Supreme Kai Gowasu.
Destroy Zamasu!"

519
00:23:06,416 --> 00:23:08,583
Make sure you don't
miss it, okay?
