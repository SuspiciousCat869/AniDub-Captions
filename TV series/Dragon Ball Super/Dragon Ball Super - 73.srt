Classic Barry!
You got excellent taste.

157
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,250
This here's my daughter.

158
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,000
[BARRY]
Oh, is that so?

159
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:08,083
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Barry Kahn.

160
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:10,125
If you'd like,
I can give you an autograph.

161
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:12,666
Anywhere you want.

162
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,875
Oh, no thanks.

163
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:18,583
Now, if you'll please
excuse us. Let's go, honey.

Coming dear. Heh.

165

Bye bye.

Uuh!

Well, uh, apparently
she's illiterate

only be wasted on her!

You coulda just
humored him, y'know.

I know, but I don't want it.

A big star's autograph?

173
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:44,500
Hey, listen, Gohan.
You're a much bigger deal to me.

Huh?

[VIDEL, GOHAN chuckle]

[A.D. 73A] All right, everyone,
we're shooting Scene 26.

178
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,791
This is Great Saiyaman's
first big action sequence,

179
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,875
where he narrowly
dodges the charging tank

180
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,541
at the last second.

181
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,750
[GOHAN]
Mm?

182
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,541
[exhales]

183
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,291
Wait. Barry's not doin' it?

184
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,041
Yeah, he's always saying
how he wishes he could

185
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,625
do all the stunts himself,
but unfortunately,

186
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:15,291
the suits won't let him 'cause
if an A-list star gets injured,

187
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:16,833
they've gotta
shut down production.

188
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,625
But otherwise, he totally would.

189
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,375
[VIDEL]
He's so brave.

190
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,041
Okay, guys, I'm all set!

191
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,833
[A.D. 73A]
All right, picture's up!

192
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,250
And...

--[BARRY] Hold on a sec!
--Huh?

194
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,541
I just wanna make
one minor adjustment.

195
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,458
[A.D. 73A]
Uh, sure. What is it?

196
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:33,208
Instead of leaping away
like a chump,

197
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,583
right before it hits him,
he leaps inside the tank.

198
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,791
That'll make me look
more heroic, you feel me?

199
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,666
[A.D. 73A] Well, if we rig up
some wires, then maybe...

200
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,916
--[BARRY] We're not using wires.

points of my movies is

--[BARRY] I never use 'em.
--[hollers]

203

If you can't do it,
you're fired.

00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:53,166
Oh, and I'll make sure you never
work in this business again.

[STUNTMAN 73A whimpers]

206
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,083
Hey, Barry, don't you
think that's asking

207
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,583
a bit too much?

208
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:00,791
"A hero is one who, no matter
what obstacles may arise,

refuses to give up and always
answers the call to fight."

210
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,583
That quote sounds familiar.

211
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,166
[BARRY]
It should. It's a quote

212
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,916
from the first brilliant
page of your memoir.

213
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,333
A truly great book
by a man among men.

Wow, you really do have a ton
of respect for me, don't cha?

00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:18,541
I'm touched. I'm deeply touched!

[BARRY] Hm. First page
is the only one I read.

Excuse me, sir.

Huh?

Is there any way you'd
let me do the stunt instead?

[A.D. 73A]
Huh?

For real? You're no stuntman!

I know why you want this.

229
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:46,500
You think if you appear in
my movie, you can brag about it

230
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,208
and impress women.

[GOHAN] I was thinking
when Pan's a little older

234
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:55,708
we could show her the movie,

235
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,291
and she might get a kick outta
seeing her dad as a superhero.

a man claiming to be

an attempted bank robbery.

366

The vigilante's true identity
remains a mystery,

367
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,458
however many people
believe it to be part of

viral marketing campaign,

with some even
suggesting the man

in the Great Saiyaman

Really, what's that?

00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,250
that I put together
for the production?

389
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,125
Well, I also made
a spare suit just in case

390
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,500
the first one was
damaged during filming.

391
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,666
Unfortunately, we had
a break-in at the lab,

392
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,500
and the back-up suit was stolen.

393
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,875
But on the bright side,
at least the thief used it

394
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,333
to fight crime and
not perpetrate it, right?

395

[A.D. 73A]
Wow, are you sure?

[STUNTMAN 73A] Yeah, I was
convinced Gohan here

Uh. What? That's ridiculous.

Don't come on my set
acting like a big shot.

406
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,375

a few measly stunts

Sorry about that. I'll just
go change into the suit now.

[GOHAN] Thank you, Bulma!
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

[GOHAN] You really
saved my bacon back there.

That was quite a performance.

412
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,583
[BULMA] That story
was pretty implausible,

are used to gaping plot holes.

you haven't changed at all--

you put that silly outfit on.

Sure do!

00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,250
[GOHAN] Yeah, but wouldn't you
rather work with a real actor?

This is a pivotal scene
between me and Great Saiyaman.

And it's not like I can
ask Barry to do it with me.

to rehearse back at your place?

That's right.

[GOHAN]
Then why are we up here?

442
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:17,958
Well, I was thinking
maybe you could just

443
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:20,083
fly me back home.

444
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,833
I must say,
I was quite surprised.

445
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,791
Imagine, the Great Saiyaman
who thwarted those bank robbers

446
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,916
was actually little old you!

[GOHAN gasps]

448
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,166
[COCOA] I may have accidentally
overheard you and Bulma

449
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,416
talking up here earlier.

450
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,416
Uh, listen, Cocoa.

Hey, don't worry about it.

for my discretion...

the long way there?

Great Saiyaman!

468
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:27,208
I don't know who that is
behind that mask,

469
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:34,041
but I have no doubt
that Watagash's host is you!

470
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,833
That's weird.
Do you know this guy?

471
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:40,708
Great Space Cannon, engage!

472
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,541
And now, I shall
disintegrate you

473
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:50,750
before you can cause me any
more trouble here, Watagash!

474

[GOHAN gasps]

475
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,333
<i>An angel and a demon sit</i>

476
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:03,458
<i>One to my right,</i>
<i>one to my left</i>

477
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:09,541
<i>In between I'm tryin'</i>
<i>to figure out the right way</i>

478
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:12,458
<i>Is one way good?</i>
<i>Is one way bad?</i>

479
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:15,625
<i>Too much confusion in my head</i>

480
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:21,000
<i>I can't think with all</i>
<i>this noise, I'm goin' crazy</i>

481
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:25,083
<i>Is there any way to know</i>
<i>what's right or wrong?</i>

482
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:29,916
<i>Demons in an angel mask</i>

483
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,083
<i>Hopin' that I'll do</i>
<i>just what they ask</i>

484
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:36,166
<i>Telling me</i>
<i>they know what's right</i>

485
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,125
<i>Lead me to the light</i>

486
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:42,083
<i>"For the sake of everyone</i>

487

<i>You have to destroy</i>
<i>the evil ones</i>

488
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:48,083
<i>That's the only path, you see"</i>

489
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:51,750
<i>So they said to me</i>

490
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:01,500
[GOHAN] Uh, hi there.
It's me, Gohan.

491
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:03,416
Y'know, shooting
a movie is hard work.

492
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,083
In fact, the only thing
harder might be

493
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:07,916
saving the world from
a vicious alien parasite.

494
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,750
But I won't back down.

495
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:12,458
[SAIYAMAN]
Transform! Ha-ha-ha!

496
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:14,833
I am the unmitigated
champion of justice!

497
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:16,750
Who tolerates no evil!

498
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:19,125
[GOKU] Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

499
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:23,583
"For My Beloved Ones!
The Indomitable Great Saiyaman!"

500
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:26,000
[SAIYAMAN] Make sure
you don't miss it, okay?
