if either Destroyer won.

or an existential threat?

27
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,660
To safeguard against the latter,
Bulma devised a plan

28

to find the Super Dragon Balls
in the Seventh Universe,

29

hoping to counteract
wishes made by

00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,640

from the Sixth.

31

[BULMA] We're all the way
on the edge of the universe,

32
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,910
so we can't search
every part of it from here.

33
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,050
And I can't make the Radar
any more powerful,

34
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,950
so to find the
Super Dragon Balls,

35
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,620
we're gonna have to go to
the center of the universe.

00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,380
[NARRATOR] But to do that,
she'll need help

I'm with Chichi, too.

156
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,200
We're wired that way,
didn't you know?

157
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,900
Saiyans only like strong women.

158
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,870
--Huh?
--Uuh...

159
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:12,580
[PICCOLO] That's it.
That explains everything.

160
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,510
[JACO] Now there
are Super Dragon Balls?

161
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,780
And a Sixth Universe?
I'm the best of the best

162
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,720
and I've never heard
of any of those things!

163
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,220
Well, before yesterday,
I'd never

164
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,050
heard of any of it, either.

165
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:24,190
That fighting contest
does sound pretty good.

166
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,590
You wouldn't mind if I
tag along for that, would ya?

167
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,190
Sure, I don't think
they would care.

168
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,190
They did say that contestants'
friends and family

169
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,700
are welcome to attend,
and if you want,

170
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,930
you should bring your
girlfriend so I can meet her.

171
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,640
--[JACO] Uh.
--What's up? Oh, don't tell me.

172
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,770
She already dumped
your butt, didn't she?

173
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,840
[JACO] She didn't dump me!
She let me go.

174
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,040
She said  I "deserved
someone better than her."

175
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,740
Uh-huh. That's just a line
girls use to break up

176
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,680
without triggering
the waterworks!

177
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,720
[JACO] You don't have
a gentle bone in your body.

178
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,190
Huh?

179
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,890
Like making me feel bad?
I'll return the favor.

180
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,490
[BULMA]
Uh.

[panting]

184
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,770
I thought I was gonna die.

185
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:19,180
I don't feel
that great, either.

186
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,180
You're such an idiot!

187
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:22,910
What? That too harsh?

188
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,580
Oh, no. Not as
harsh as your age.

189
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,720
Aaah! Sorry,
I didn't mean it that way.

190
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,220
I'm just reflecting
on how much you've grown

191
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,950
and changed since we first met.

192
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,190
We really have known
each other a long time, huh?

193
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,760
[JACO]
Yep.

194
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,200
What the--? That's my ship!

195
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,170
Cool, I figured it out!

196
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,200
Aah!

197
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,910
Yeah, easy-peezy.

198
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,010
[JACO sighs]

199
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,010
My little sister's a genius.

200
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:57,050
And she's stealing my ship!

201
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,720
With her brains,
she's gonna accomplish

202
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:02,820
whatever she wants.
And she's totally fearless, too!

203
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,720
It's been several decades!

204
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,790
So, of course,
I'm gonna age a little bit.

205
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:09,030
[JACO] I remember thinking that
with you smarts, attitude,

206
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,260
and piloting skills,
you might even become

207
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,160
a member of the Galactic Patrol.

208
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,070
Flying through space
and protecting the galaxy

209
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,100
does sound like a good time.

210
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,570
But when you're
married to Vegeta

211
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,670
and mom to a boy like Trunks,
you don't look back.

212
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:23,510
I'm perfectly content with
how my life has unfolded.

213
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,180
[JACO chuckles]
There we go.

214
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,230
And, we're here.

Well, Bulma, you don't see

217
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,070
That's classy?

218
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,990
[BULMA]
That is a very large head.

219
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,420
Hello there,
thank you for coming.

220
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,420
Sorry, are you Master Zuno?

221
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,060
I am not.

222
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,030

We are Master Zuno's

his every need in this manse.

[BOTH gasp]

225
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:43,510
We are encircling you
on these steps

226
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,140
because Master Zuno informs us

227
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,310
you are uninvited guests
to his planet.

228
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,050
Then how are we
supposed to see him?

229
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,310
I'm sorry for your ignorance,

230
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,520
but Master Zuno will not
see anyone without notice.

231
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,650
You never said
anything about this!

232
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,620
Guess I forgot, sorry.

233
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,560
[ATTENDANT 31A] Let me see
when we can get you in.

234
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:03,590
Are you busy seven years
from next Monday?

235
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,090
[BULMA] Okay, how much money
do you want?

236
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,330
No bribes, please.

237

Look, I see your schedule!

238

Today's got tons of room!
Can't you just pencil us in?

239

it works around here.

Oh, good, we've been
waiting for you.

Huh? What's your problem?

249
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,090
Are you trying to stare
a hole in me, or what?

we might be able

255
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,380
to take his spot on the schedule

256
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,920
and ask Master Zuno
our questions!

257

[GEPPUMAN] He knows who I am.
I should scram.

my dine-and-dash question!

00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:10,590
[JACO] But, if I do
bring him in, HQ could learn

00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:13,270
I'm the one who destroyed
the Galactic Monument.

[GEPPUMAN]
Okay. He hasn't made a move.

263

of the galaxy's most wanted.

Huh?!

Our only option left
is to assume Beerus was joking,

272
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,330
and he won't
destroy the universe.

That's why we're
on this mission,

but at least we won't
have any regrets.

Because we both
did everything we could.

I am Master Zuno.

I am he in this galaxy
who can give answers

this galaxy asked by those

You're embarrassing me!

Before you ask,
you must offer tribute.

Hm! You're gonna
love this, Bulma.

320

[BULMA]

[BULMA shrieks]

While I do appreciate the
tribute, because you are male,

323
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,410
I will only allow you
to ask one question.

324
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,940
[JACO] Yes, sir. Watch this,
you're gonna be

325
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,380
blown away by how much he knows!

326
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,380
Oh, wise master.
Can you please look at

327
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,550
the Earth woman behind me and
tell us her chest measurement?

328
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:23,520
Her bust is 83.4
centimeters around.

329
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,590
They used to measure
at 87 centimeters,

330
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,920
but in her advancing age
they've begun to sag,

331
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,430
as is normal
for the human female.

332
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,500
What'd I tell ya?
Lord Zuno's always right.

333
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,030
And now would the
older Earth female

334
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,970
with the somewhat
sagging chest care to ask

335
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,400
the great Master Zuno
a question of her own?

336
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,270
Ah! Well, yeah,
I would, obviously.

337
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,210
I mean it's the whole
reason we came here!

338
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,580

and pay him your tribute.

I do thank you
for your tribute kiss

and for being so gentle,

345

but because you are
a middle-aged Earth woman,

346
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,000
I will only answer
three questions for you.

347
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,670
Hey, I'm still
in awesome shape!

348

You're only gonna
give me two more questions

349
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,770
than that puny,
little patrol man?

350
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:19,480
[ZUNO]
That is correct.

351
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,540
He has answered your first one.

352
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,780
Now please ask your
remaining two questions.

353
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,750
Hold on! That wasn't
supposed to count!

354
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,650
Calm down. Just be
more careful with your words.

355
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,850
This is ridiculous.

356
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,590
Um, Master Zuno.

357
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:35,320
Can you tell us everything
about the Super Dragon Balls?

358
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,530
That's my next question!

359
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,600
Very well, I shall give
you a comprehensive answer

360
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,570
on these cosmic artifacts.

361
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,240
Super Dragon Balls
are called "wish orbs."

362
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:48,770
They were created in the
Year 41 of the Divine Calendar

363
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:51,770
by the dragon god, Zalama, and
they are perfectly spherical,

364
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:54,580
planet-sized celestial objects,
measuring exactly

365
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:59,650
37,196.2204 kilometers
in diameter.

366
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,780
Super Dragon Balls
are extremely rare

367
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,350
and only number seven.

368
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:06,320
They are divided between the
Sixth and Seventh Universes.

369
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,360
To the mortal eye, they will
appear as pale, yellow spheres.

370
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,560
In the center of each is
a unique arrangement of red

371
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,630
star-shaped markings, numbering
them one through seven.

372
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,370
These red marks refract light,

373
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,800
--Wait. Hold on a sec.
--so that they appear as stars

374
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,640
from any viewing angle.

375
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,970
This is a result of Zalama's
brilliant structural design,

376
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:24,470
and in Divine Year 42,
Zalama requested

377
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,680
and was granted
a patent for this design.

378
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,540
Once all Super Dragon Balls
have been found

379
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,250
and gathered
in one place, the phrase,

380
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,450
"Come forth, divine dragon
and grant my wish,

381
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,220
peas and carrots" must be said
in the Divine tongue.

382
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,290
The Divine Dragon Zalama
will then appear

383
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,190
and grant thee one wish,
and after granting

384
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,920
said wish he will
then disappear,

385
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,530
whereupon the Super Dragon Balls
will re-scatter themselves

386
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,260
throughout universes
Six and Seven

387
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,230
and wait in silence
for another seeker

388
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:50,170
with an unfulfilled wish
to gather them again.

Did you get all that?

Because I'm not gonna lie,
I didn't get any of it.

392
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,810
So, to summarize all that,

393
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,840
there are seven
Super Dragon Balls in total,

394
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,310
scattered across the Sixth
and Seventh Universes

395
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,850
that can be used to summon
the dragon god Zalama?

there are only

And if Champa
already has six of them,

Yeah, definitely ten.

466
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,310
Goodbye to our adventure

467
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,820
In twilight we must go our separate ways

468
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:57,350
And try to discover the path to our own destiny

469
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,600
I can't find the words

470
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,130
to tell you how much our parting hurts

471
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,630
I hope you know I'll always love you

472
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:07,580
And all that we shared will be remembered

473
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,890
How could I forget your face?

474
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,790
All my memories erased

475
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,870
I can still hear the melody of your voice

476
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,430
Petals fall in from above

477
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,070
Fade away, all that we love

478
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:28,580
In the twilight,

479
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:28,580
fade away,

480
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,580
fade away

481
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:34,990
Sayonara,

482
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,990
fade away,

483
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,990
fade away

484
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,330
Hey, it's me, Goku!

485
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:43,300
Well, my training's goin' great,
and I'm all ready to fight...

486
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,670
...and not just the 6th Universe's warriors.

487
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:49,590
I can't wait to meet the new guy on our team
who's supposed to be stronger than me!

488
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:53,890
I might even have to give him a little test
to see what he's really got, he he he he he.

489
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:55,850
But I won't have much time to mess around!

490
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,700
The tournament's about to start!

491
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,060
Next time on Dragon Ball Super:

492
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,230
Make sure you don't miss it, okay?
