[NARRATOR] Previously,
on Dragon Ball Super,

3
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:55,791
Shenron told Goku the secret
to becoming a Super Saiyan God.

4
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:58,000
But the instructions
presented a problem.

5
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:00,708
That means you need
five-plus-one Saiyans, or six.

6
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:03,625
Oh, no! That's more than
we have here, right?

7
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,833
[NARRATOR] But as
the group soon discovered,

8
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:10,750
there was a sixth Saiyan:
the baby growing inside Videl.

9
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:13,125
With this assist
from his unborn grandchild,

10
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:17,041
Goku added the power
of five Saiyans to his own.

11
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:19,750
It may have taken more time
than Beerus would have liked,

12
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:24,375
but at long last, Goku had
become a Super Saiyan God.

13
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:38,500
[BEERUS] Well, well. Seems this
was worth the wait, after all.

find him now. This is nuts.

it looks like he's in his
regular Saiyan form.

29

I thought he'd bulk up
like a Super Saiyan,

he looks leaner now.
