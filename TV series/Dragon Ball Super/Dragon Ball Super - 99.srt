[SHOSA growling]

323
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:54,666
[KRILLIN]
Here!

324
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:55,791
[SHOSA]
Huh?!

325
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:56,958
[KRILLIN, A18 grunting]

326
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,708

[yells]

328
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:05,708
[SHOSA] It just keeps getting
faster, and bigger, too!

329
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:08,416
[A18] Take this, you
possum-playing weasel!

330
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,083
Oh, yeah!

331
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:11,791
[SHOSA gasping]

332
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,708
[SHOSA screaming]

333
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:18,750
Got him!

334
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,250
[A18]
Hmm...

335
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,625
Hey, up high, 18!

336
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:22,875
You got it.

337
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:26,083
[KRILLIN laughing]

338
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,041
[A18 laughs]

339
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,041
That fight was fantastic!

340
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,583
And fun-tastic, too!

341
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:34,083
[BEERUS]
Well done! Nice teamwork, guys!

342
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,291
That really hurts!

343
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:39,375
[SHOSA cries]
I'm so terribly sorry.

344
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:42,000
This is just embarrassing.

345
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:42,875
[KRILLIN gasps]

346
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,416

00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,833
[KRILLIN groaning]

348
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,750
Ow, ow, owie! [gasps]

349
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,333

[MAJORA groans]

353
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,541
Thanks, guess we're even.

354
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:59,083
They just keep comin' out of
the woodwork, don't they?

355
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,416
Are you okay?

356
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,708
Yeah.

357
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,625
I guess that's just what
a battle royale is like.

358
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:07,250
Well its clear they're
all targeting us now.

359
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,041
If it weren't for Goku,

360
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,708
they wouldn't even have a
chance to save themselves,

361
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,916
but they'll never show
him any gratitude.

362
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,333
[MAJORA laughs] You managed
to catch me by surprise.

363
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:21,000
I must've let my guard down.

364
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:24,000
But you won't be so
lucky a second time.

365
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:27,000
Do you honestly think you
can best one such as me?

366
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:29,500
Hey, 18, ya might wanna
put these on now.

367
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:30,958
'Kay.

368
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,791
Wait, those are mine.
When did he snatch 'em?

369
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,208
Here I go!

370
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,625
[MAJORA grunts]

371
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:41,583
Hundred-Times Solar Flare!

372
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:45,708
[MAJORA grunts]

373
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:46,625
[KRILLIN]
What the--?!

374
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,791
[KRILLIN groans]

375
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,041
[gasps]

376
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,625
I don't understand.
What just happened?

377
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:57,541
How was he able to attack
in that blinding light?

378
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,583
[QUITELA laughs]

379
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:03,416
[KRILLIN groans] Why didn't
my Solar Flare work on you?

380
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,375
[laughing]

381
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:10,041
[MAJORA] My eyes have long since
lost their power of sight.

382
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,541
[gasps] So that's why
it had no effect.

383
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,333
But then how could you
tell where we were?

384
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,750
Your aim's annoyingly
accurate, y'know!

385
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:19,666
That is the question, isn't it?

386
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,750
There's only one thing
I think it could be.

387
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:23,916
[MAJORA]
Hm?

388
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,958
He's tracking us...
by using our scent.

389
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,333
[KRILLIN]
Our scent?

390
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,166
[A18] Yeah that's right,
I'm betting he

391
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,291
probably had to develop
a pretty impressive sense

392
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,416
of smell to make up
for losing his vision.

393
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,208
A brilliant deduction.

394
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:38,750
You're quite perceptive,
aren't you?

395
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,041
Okay, fine.

396
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,333
Now that I know how you did it--

397
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,291
You believe you can defeat me?

398
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:44,708
Huh?

399
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:45,666
I know I can.

400
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,208
[A18 sighs]
Krillin!

401
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:50,500
Well... Though your
bravery is impressive,

402
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:53,958
trust me, you should keep
that bravado in check.

403
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,666
[KRILLIN] It's not really
bravado if I can back it up.

404
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,000
[MAJORA growls]
You're making a grave mistake.

405
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,875
Unless you <i>want</i> me to
tear you limb from limb.

406
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,458
Well go ahead and try it!
I'm not scared.

407
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:06,541
Stop it!

408
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:09,375
It's all right.
Just let me handle this.

409
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:10,625
[A18]
Huh?

410
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:13,375
I've got a surefire way
to outmaneuver this guy.

411
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:16,125
You must actually be delusional.

412
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:20,250
[laughs] I've never heard of
anything so preposterous!

413
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,916
With my heightened
sense of smell,

414
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,375
I can track your exact location.
There's no way around that.

415
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:28,625
I'll come after you
with everything I have.

416

I've got you now!

00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,375
[KRILLIN]
H'ya!

423
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:19,083

Huh?!

[screams]

00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:23,875
What is that offensive odor?

426
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:26,750
Gah! The stench is overpowering!

427
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,166
[KRILLIN]
Good!

428
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,958

And Contestant Majora

of the Fourth has
been eliminated.

[FUTURE ZENO]
Tap, tap!

00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:56,458
Let's see... Majora, Majora.

439
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,666
Boop! He's gone.

440
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,666
[ZENO]
No more Majora.

441
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,500
They're dropping so quickly now.

442
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:03,875
Yes, it's exciting!

443
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,750
[groans] What a disgrace!

444
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,583
Success!

445
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,958
Yeah, but the way you
won was disgusting.

446
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,041
When we get home,
I'm washing those shoes.

447
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,833
Or better yet, burning them.

448
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:18,416
You're exceeding my extremely
low expectations for you!

449
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,416
Oh, yeah! Hear that?

450
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,083
I am absolutely
Krillin' it today!

451
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,166
[KRILLIN laughs]

452

How quickly the tide can change.

[KRILLIN]
Uh?

454
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:29,625
[KRILLIN screams]

455
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,041
[A18, BEERUS]
What?

456
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,791
[FROST chuckles] Carelessness
is your greatest foe.

457
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,875
You mess with him,
you mess with me!

458
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:40,083
[FROST] A tempting proposition,
but I have places to be!

00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:41,291
[A18 gasps]

460
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,166
[A18]
Turning tail like a coward.

461
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,916
Sheesh, way to
blow it, big time!

462
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,375
Shame on you, Curly!

463
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,666
Uh. Yeah...
it's still Krillin, sir.

464
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,708
I only learn the
names of winners.

465
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:58,083
I'm sorry! You can call
me whatever you like!

466
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,833
You performed admirably
out there, Krillin.

467
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:03,333
I'm not too upset
about your loss.

468
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,291
Then you should tell
that to your face!

469
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,958
Well, no sense dwelling on it.
What's done is done.

470
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,916
But you'd better
cheer extra loud.

471
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,291
That's literally all <i>you</i>
can do at this point.

472
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:13,833
Yes, sir.

473
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:17,000
Sorry, guys. My bad.

474
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:20,250
Now you're gonna have to fight
even harder 'cause of me.

475
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:26,541
[NARRATOR] The Seventh Universe
has just lost its first fighter.

476
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:30,083
As the Tournament of Power
grows more and more intense,

477
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:33,041
can Goku and his
teammates defeat the best

478
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,208
in the Cosmos to secure victory?

479
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:40,083
Forty-three minutes remain
until time runs out,

480
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:45,041
and the fate of all competing
universes will be decided.

481
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:50,708
The battles continue,
next time on Dragon Ball Super.

482
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:56,750
<i>When the time has come</i>
<i>to say goodbye</i>

483
00:21:56,833 --> 00:22:00,041
<i>Your voice will</i>
<i>echo in the night</i>

484
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:04,541
<i>Though we may be apart,</i>
<i>you're always in my heart</i>

485
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:11,750
<i>Forever in my mind</i>
<i>as I look up to the sky</i>

486
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:16,875
<i>I was watching you</i>
<i>from your left side</i>

487
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:21,250
<i>Was trying to get</i>
<i>a good look at your face</i>

488
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:25,791
<i>The tears in your eyes;</i>
<i>were you laughing or crying?</i>

489
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,333
<i>Your long hair in the way</i>

490
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:30,458
<i>Blocking the thoughts inside</i>

491
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:34,625
<i>When the time has</i>
<i>come to say goodbye</i>

492
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:37,875
<i>Your voice will</i>
<i>echo in the night</i>

493
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:42,375
<i>Though we may be apart,</i>
<i>you're always in my heart</i>

494
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:46,833
<i>Forever I will wait,</i>
<i>for the light to show the way</i>

495
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:51,833
<i>For us to meet again</i>

496
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,041
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

497
00:22:57,125 --> 00:23:00,416
Finally, we get to see some
Saiyan-on-Saiyan action!

498
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,791
And Super Saiyan 2 Caulifla's
power is off the charts!

499
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:05,333
But don't sleep on Kale!

500
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:07,833
She's rocking some
incredible energy, too!

501
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:10,791
Whoa, is this what Saiyans
are supposed to look like?

502
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:12,458
I can't let them
have all the fun.

503
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:14,708
I'd better start
powering up, too!

504
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:17,000
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

505
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:20,541
"Rampage! A Crazed Warrior's
Savagery Awakens!"

506
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:22,125
Make sure you don't
miss it, okay?
