wanting to talk to you.

I saw you across the ring,
and you powered up

Why can't I land a punch?!

225
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,666
You pumped up your
muscles for strength,

226
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,625
but in exchange you
killed your speed.

[grunting, sighs]

229

On top of that, that bulk
drains your stamina--

230
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,208
so it's not suited for
a drawn-out fight.

[CAULIFLA grunts]

For those reasons,

the Saiyan transformation

you should be aiming
for... is this!

to repeat it since

Really? You did?

244

with the feeling in your back?

about it that way before!

stay on my toes around you.

could be at Super Saiyan Three.

she's taken--it's grotesque!
