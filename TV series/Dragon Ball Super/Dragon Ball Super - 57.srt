[FUTURE ZAMASU chuckles]

163
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,583
I used the most powerful
techniques I've got,

164
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:20,666
and at Super Saiyan,
but none of it phased him!

165
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,583
[FUTURE TRUNKS] And when I ran
him through with my sword,

166
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,333
his wound healed instantly.

167
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:29,500
Is it true--
is he really invincible?

Are you now keenly aware
of your own powerlessness

to fight me, don't you?

Go ahead and
challenge me all you like

sheer impotence. Heh.

I want both of you to listen
to me very carefully here.

and repeated affronts
toward a deity,

But that's completely unfair!

A mortal.

321
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:04,041
A mere mortal taking
divine power for himself?

322
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,875
[ZAMASU growls]

323
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:08,916
[ZAMASU]
Huh?

324
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,125
Master, what are
those bizarre planets?

325
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,583
Oh, those things?

326
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:16,416
If I had to guess, I'd say
they're Super Dragon Balls.

327
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,833
[ZAMASU]
Super Dragon Balls, sir?

328
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,208
Believe it or not,
this is actually the first time

329
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,125
I've seen them myself.

330
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,416
This tournament was
between the Destroyers

331
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,791
from the Sixth
and Seventh Universes.

332
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,916
They were competing
with each other to determine

333
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,958
who would get
the Super Dragon Balls.

334
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:36,625
[ZAMASU] A prize even
Destroyers would vie for?

335
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:39,791
They must be
something truly special.

336
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,958
So exactly what sort
of item are they, master?

337
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,333
My understanding is that
they're orbs that can

338
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:50,208
grant their possessor
any wish they desire.

339
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:54,208
[ZAMASU]
Truly? Any wish at all?

340
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:57,791
[ZAMASU] Are you sure this isn't
just some rumor? A fairy tale?

341
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:58,958
[GOWASU]
Mmm.

342
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:03,416
--[GOKU yelling]
--[HIT groaning]

343
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,125
Look, I'd say the contest
is about to reach its climax.

344
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,791
[ZAMASU]
Yes.

345
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,375
[ZAMASU]
Super Dragon Balls.

346
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,625
[ZAMASU]
Hmm.

347
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,708
[MALE ATTENDANT hollers]

348
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,166
[ZUNO gasps]

349
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,541
[ZUNO]
What do you want?

350
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,125
What I want is
for you to tell me about

351
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:48,333
the Super Dragon Balls.

352
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,250
Tell me everything
that you know!

353
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:00,000

357
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:08,875

[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

372
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:45,041
Come on, Vegeta and Trunks!

373
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:47,416
Let's snap out of it
and go back to the future

374
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,500
to take down Black and Zamasu!

375
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:51,125
Huh, what's that, Whis?

376
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:53,416
Present Zamasu's
talkin' to Zuno about me

377
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,958
and the Super Dragon Balls?

378
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:57,666
Man, this time travel stuff's
givin' me a headache!

379
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,833
Wait, I just figured out
what future Zamasu's

380
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:01,458
gonna do in the past!

381
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:03,791
[GOKU] Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

382
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:06,958
"Zamasu and Black.
The Duo's Mystery Deepens."

383
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:09,125
Make sure you don't
miss it, okay?
