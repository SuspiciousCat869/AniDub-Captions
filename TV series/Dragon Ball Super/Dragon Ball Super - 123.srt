He keeps moving in close

one of those blasts

counterattack against Jiren.

325
00:21:26,192 --> 00:21:30,655
Goku has amplified his Super
Saiyan Blue with his Kaio-ken,

326
00:21:30,739 --> 00:21:34,826
while Vegeta has reached a level
we've never seen before.

327
00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:36,453
With this combined assault,

328
00:21:36,536 --> 00:21:39,164
Jiren seems to be
backed into a corner.

329
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:41,583
But can he truly be defeated?

330
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:44,878
Only seven minutes remain
in the Tournament of Power.

331
00:21:44,961 --> 00:21:47,589
Next time, on Dragon Ball Super!

332
00:21:48,465 --> 00:21:51,968
<i>Whirling all around</i>
<i>and then back again</i>

333
00:21:52,052 --> 00:21:55,889
<i>The song that connects you</i>
<i>to the heavens</i>

334
00:21:55,972 --> 00:21:59,434
<i>Strength that goes</i>
<i>beyond all measure</i>

335
00:21:59,517 --> 00:22:02,312
<i>Expanding to a beat</i>
<i>that won't end</i>

336
00:22:02,395 --> 00:22:06,024
<i>The meteors fall like rain drops</i>

337
00:22:06,107 --> 00:22:09,778
<i>Astrological tears</i>
<i>from my eyelids</i>

338
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:15,116
<i>A strong emotion</i>
<i>from deep within</i>

339
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,410
<i>Has been awakened</i>

340
00:22:17,494 --> 00:22:21,039
<i>A spark of possibility</i>

341
00:22:21,122 --> 00:22:24,876
<i>Shines softly like a star</i>
<i>in the night sky</i>

342
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:29,964
<i>A wish from long</i>
<i>ago now shoots by</i>

343
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:32,258
<i>And I'm awakened</i>

344
00:22:32,342 --> 00:22:36,012
<i>A never-ending melody,</i>
<i>so enchanting</i>

345
00:22:36,096 --> 00:22:39,766
<i>You're always the one</i>
<i>who makes me tremble</i>

346
00:22:39,849 --> 00:22:44,062
<i>The meteors keep falling down</i>

347
00:22:44,145 --> 00:22:47,357
<i>Surging right into my heart</i>

348
00:22:51,152 --> 00:22:52,654
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

349
00:22:52,737 --> 00:22:55,407
Vegeta and I are amping things
up in our fight against Jiren,

350
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,742
hoping we've finally
found an advantage.

351
00:22:57,826 --> 00:23:00,161
But that's not the only
action in the ring!

352
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:03,331
Gohan's about to find himself
in a tough spot against Dyspo,

353
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:05,875
and it looks like Frieza's
happy to jump in!

354
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:10,005
Come on, you guys, let's see how
the two of you fight as a team!

355
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:12,257
Next time, on Dragon Ball Super:

356
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,427
"A Storm-and-Stress Assault!
Gohan's Last Stand!"

357
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,512
Make sure you don't
miss it, okay?
