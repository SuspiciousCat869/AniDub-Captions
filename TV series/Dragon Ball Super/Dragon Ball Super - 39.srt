Now it's calling for me go back to the start

3
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,910
Wishing on the starlight

00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,770
In the sky, let's paint a door for tomorrow

Just step on the new stage don't be shy

[NARRATOR] Previously,
on Dragon Ball Super,

17
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,480
the 6th Universe
had been whittled down

18
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,780
to its last,
most fearsome warrior:

19
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,350
the legendary assassin, Hit.

20
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,020
Vegeta powered up
to Super Saiyan Blue,

21
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:42,390
but not even that could
stop Hit's astonishing

22
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,550
special attack.

23
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,670
[NARRATOR] With Hit's ability
to jump a fraction of a second

24
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:04,380
into the future, it seemed
his time-defying advantage

25
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,480
was too much to overcome.

26
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,710
Until Goku stepped
into the ring.

27
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,810
Still lucky?

28
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,680
[HIT]
What?

29
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,990
[GOKU chuckles]

30
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,420
Your whole advantage
is moving a tenth

31
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,930
of a second forward in
time for a surprise shot.

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,560
So then I just anticipated--

33
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,060
guessing where your
moves will take you

34
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,760
after you start your attack.

35
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,100
Based on watching
your fighting style.

36
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,340
A new phase of
the fight begins.

37
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,850
You're finally taking this
thing seriously, aren't ya?

38
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,180
Then I'll be doing
the same, Hit!

39
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,720
Now I'm going all out!

40
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,110
[GOKU]
Okay, here goes.

41
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,710
Thanks for waiting, Hit.

42
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,050
He defended himself
from that Time Skip

43
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,820
by predicting how
Hit would attack.

44
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,630
Damn! Kakarot makes it
sound like it's child's play!

45
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,830
But why would he tell Hit
what he was doing?

46
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,600
He had a critical advantage
and he may have just blown it!

47
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,870
[HIT]
You show poor judgment, Goku.

48
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,440
Now that I know
what you're doing,

49
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:40,810
I can outwit you by
being harder to predict.

50
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,740
You can try. But these
are split-second reactions.

51
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,080
Going against your instincts
is harder than you think.

52
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,950
And my speed's gonna make it
even more of a challenge.

53
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,590
I gotta give Hit credit.

54
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,430
He's hanging in there
against Goku even though

55
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,300
he's in his
Super Saiyan Blue form.

56
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,880
What's the matter?

57
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,050
Aren't you gonna
use that Time Skip?

[GOKU yells]

59
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:37,090
I'll admit it. Without that
technique, I won't last long.

60
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,360
Okay, so what are
you waiting for?

61
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,800

Very well.

Yeah! Nice one!

Damn it! No one's ever
stopped his Time Skip!

Yes, it seems Goku
has found its flaw.

68

Now they see what
my Saiyan can do.

Your Saiyan? And here I thought
I was the one training him.

Of course, it's
easier to go second.

to study Hit's moves!

[GOKU] You kinda caught
me off guard there.

yells when he powers up, too.

fighting any differently.

[CHAMPA] I thought the
point of that screaming fit

was to boost his power!

to know why he screamed?

He can ascend to new
levels just like a Saiyan!

106

I don't think so.

107
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,250
It seems that was
merely dramatic flair.

You mean all that screaming?

109
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,060
[VADOS] Perhaps he wanted
to start his attack

110
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,630
with some showmanship,
like Goku does.

111
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,130
I can't increase my ability
through some kind of

112
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:13,170
noisy transformation the way
Frost and you Saiyans do.

113
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,740
If I wanna become more
lethal, I don't have the luxury

114
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:19,110
of cutting corners; I just have
to do it the old-fashioned way.

115
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,610
Anybody know what
he's talking about?

116
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,680
He's talking about
his pure technique.

117
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,850
And what does that mean?

118
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,420
Somehow, he's figured
out how to improve

119
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,290
his fighting move in
the middle of this match,

120
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,120
without any boost to his power!

121
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,090
Combat is craft. What matters
most is not raw power,

122
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,200
but the skill by
which you hone it.

123
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:42,770
I'd never even thought
of improving my Time Skip.

124
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,170
Up to now there was no reason,

125
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,300
since I could defeat
anyone I faced.

126
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,670
And then came you.

127
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:50,510
So I thought,
maybe I can push it farther.

128
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,810
And as you can see,
my experiment paid off.

129
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,480
By refining my technique,
I've managed

130
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,010
to jump twice as far
into the future.

this stance should
maximize the effectiveness

right through my defenses.

doubling his Time Skip,

154

he can jump ahead about two
tenths of a second now.

I can only take a few
more shots like that,

that far out of reach.

during battle is in our blood.

161
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,470
It's what makes Saiyans
the ultimate warrior race.

162
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,440
I refuse to believe this
"Hit" can do it better.

163
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,670
[HIT] You're badly misreading
the situation you're in, Goku.

164
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:13,930
[GOKU]
How's that?

165
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,570
Right now, you're trying
to calculate how many

166
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,340
of my blows you'll
be able to absorb

167
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:20,110
while you try to
predict my attacks.

168
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,010
You believe two tenths
of a second won't make

169
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,610
enough difference,
and you'll still be able

170
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,650
to take the damage and
make a counter-strike,

171
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,080
but that's where you're wrong.

172
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,320
[HIT] Because I'm not
done improving yet.

173
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,600
[HIT] That time I skipped
forward half a second,

174
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,830
which is five times better
than my initial technique

175
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,040
and obviously more
than you can handle.

176
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,500
He's joking!

177
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,670
Usually Goku's the one who
gets better as a fight goes.

178
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:55,510
That's how he managed
to save us so many times!

179
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,610
If this guy can step it up
faster than Goku can,

180
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,310
we really are in trouble!

181
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,050
[HIT]
Referee.

182
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,550
[TD REF]
Yes, contestant?

183
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,790
[HIT] We've established that
killing will disqualify me.

184
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,320
[TD REF]
That's right.

185
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,390
[HIT] Then as with Vegeta, it's
up to you to end this fight.

186
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,630
A while back, you nearly
called this match.

187
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,260
What are you waiting for now?

188
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,300
Goku, get up!

189
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,810
[TD REF]
Uh...

190
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,140
[HIT]
Make a decision!

191
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,280
[TD REF] Contestant Goku is
somehow back on his feet!

192
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,020
[GOKU]
I'm not giving up.

193
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,920
[HIT] It seems you're too proud
to admit when you've failed.

194
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,330
That's not it!

195
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,630
What?

196
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,900
[GOKU] Stopping now
wouldn't be fair to you.

197
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,430
It'd give you the wrong idea.

198
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,000
[HIT]
What does that mean?

199
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,870
[GOKU] Look, it's not 'cause
I've been trying to trick you,

200
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:58,370
or make you think you're
stronger than you are, okay?

201
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,870
I'm just still working
on something

202
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,940
and I didn't want to use it
in battle till I was sure

203
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,540
it was time.

204
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,410
Honestly, I didn't think I'd try
it till after this tournament,

205
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,510
when I was ready to
challenge Lord Beerus again.

206
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,320
Say what? Do you know what
he's talking about, Whis?

207
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,400
[GOKU] Since I am
still figuring it out,

208
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,770
at this point I only have about
a one-in-ten chance

209
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,100
of pulling it off.

210
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,270
And if I mess this move up,
it's gonna do a lot more

211
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,470
than just knock me out
of this tournament.

212
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,710
But here goes!

213
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,580
[GOKU yelling]

214
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,720
Is he actually
trying what I think?

215
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,650
Surely he hasn't
discovered a transformation

216
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,320
beyond "Super Saiyan Blue."

217
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:51,620
But if not that, what
could he be trying to do?

218
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:53,890
Defeat him, Hit,
while you still can!

219
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:56,760
I don't know what he's up to
and I don't wanna find out!

220
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,770
Don't just stand there! Attack!

221
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,410
Come on!

222
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:18,150
[HIT] Your greatness has
fueled my own, Goku.

223
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:21,850
As you rise even higher,
by necessity, so will I.

224
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,160
I wanna see where
this competition goes,

225
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,990
for my own sake.

226
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,190
Let's take this to its peak.

227
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,800
The assassin's sounding
more and more

228
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,100
like a martial artist.

229
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,500
He's certainly
acting differently.

230
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,630
I've never heard him
talk so much before.

231
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,500
He has an effect
on his opponents.

232
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,340
That's what's unique about Goku.

233
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,490
[GOKU chuckles]

234
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,630
Now, I'll show you
the Kaio-ken!

235
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,370
I pulled it off!

236
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,200
All the power of
Super Saiyan Blue

237
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,040
intensified with the
Kaio-ken technique!

238
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,880
If I'd messed this up
even a little,

239
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,580
my energy would've
run out of control,

240
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:20,010
and with this much of it,
I woulda been toast.

241
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:22,050
But it looks like
I've got it in check.

242
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,180
Good old Kaio-ken.

243
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:28,120
I guess it was worth
the risk after all.

244
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,590
And what exactly
does this technique do?

245
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,830
[GOKU] It's basically
an energy multiplier.

246
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,090
I learned it a long time
ago from King Kai.

247
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,560
This version doubles my
strength, speed, and senses,

248
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,900
and all the other traits
I use in a fight.

249
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,740
Here it comes!

250
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,670
[HIT]
Impossible!

251
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,980
[GOKU]
Over here!

252
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,680
I couldn't follow
his movements at all!

253
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,820
That uppity, disrespectful
Saiyan was planning

254
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,380
to use this move against me?

255
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,020
I'm detecting a hint of concern
in your voice, my lord.

256
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,850
Do you think that would
be a problem for you?

257
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,460
Don't be ridiculous!
Why would I even care?

258
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:07,130
If you're not at all worried,
then why are you sweating?

259
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,100
I'm sweating because
I hate losing to my brother

260
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,100
and Goku holding back
could've cost us.

261
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,600
Now leave me alone!

262
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,400
[VEGETA] Beerus doesn't
understand what sort of

263
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,970
technique that is.

Kaio-ken! Times four!

267

[VEGETA yelling]

268
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,500
[VEGETA] The Kaio-ken
does amplify his attacks,

269
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:48,970
at least for a while,
but it takes a huge toll on him.

270
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,500
Going Super Saiyan
strains his body, too,

271
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:54,110
and I'm sure that so-called
Super Saiyan Blue's

272
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,810
exponentially worse.

273
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,910
Adding Kaio-ken on top of that?

274
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:00,580
It's hard to imagine the
damage he's doing to himself.

275
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,280
No wonder he didn't
use it earlier.

276
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,620
He was saving it
as a last resort.

277
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:07,590
I know it's risky,
but there's a big payoff, too.

278
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,120
Super Saiyan Blue's all about
power through extreme control.

279
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,930
Combining that with the
calming focus of the Kaio-ken,

280
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,000
and now there's no
telling how high I can go!

281
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,600
[VEGETA]
Damn it! No!

282
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,800
He's leapt past me once again!

283
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:33,780
His energy keeps shooting
higher; it's extraordinary!

It won't work.
I don't care how far

you push your Time Skip;
it won't stand a chance

end this war between universes?

The Tournament of
Destroyers concludes,

00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:35,730
next time on Dragon Ball Super!

785

Whoa–oa

788
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:52,790
It's hard to say - don't wanna stay

789
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,300
I twist and fight, can't find my way

790
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:59,000
I must believe, that fear and trouble

791
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:02,500
can even be fun if you think the right way

792
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,990
Whoa–oa

793
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,140
Whoa–oa

794
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,140
Whoa

795
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:12,500
I don't wanna draw the line, I gotta see it through some way

796
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:16,000
Fight for what I know is mine, the dream I had of me that day

797
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,130
Whoa–o-oa

798

Whoa–o-oa

799
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,300
Whoa–oa–oa

800
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:24,200
Don't care if they call me greedy,

801
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,800
If they ever make it make it through,

802
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:27,240
Don't care if they laugh at me,

803
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,100
cus' I will make the dream come true

804
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:32,090
Whoa–oa

805
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:36,000
Whoa–oa

806
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:36,000
Whoa–oa–oa

807
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,250
Hey, it's me, Goku!

808
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:44,460
I hope you like encores,
'cause this battle isn't over just yet!

809
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,510
Ha! I may have unleashed
a whole new level of power

810
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:51,510
but there's a reason Hit was chosen
as the strongest fighter from the 6th Universe.

811
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:56,140
And if I'm gonna win, I'll have to
find the strength for one last shot.

812
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,640
Next time on Dragon Ball Super:

813
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:05,230
Make sure you don't miss it, okay?
