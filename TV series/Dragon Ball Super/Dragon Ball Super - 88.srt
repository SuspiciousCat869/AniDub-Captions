How was work, honey?

You hit lots of buttons

You're running out

You're supposed to
pull your punches!

When we win, I'm taking
your ten million zeni

Telling yourself you have to win

193
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,125
isn't training, Gohan.

194
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,500
It's pointless.

195
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,916
You need to face reality,
and do the real work.

196
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,250
If you can't tap
into your true power,

all the motivation
in the world

[PICCOLO]
Sure, having something

201
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,916
to defend or fight for
can drive you.

202
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,333
But when feelings dominate,

203
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:59,250
they can just as quickly
drag you down.

204
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,916
You want your emotions to
complement your strength,

if love makes you afraid--

00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,208
you won't be able to assess
the fight logically.

210
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:14,708
You'll misjudge your opponent's

So that's it.

There's no such thing as

If we lose, our entire universe
will be destroyed.

216
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:38,458
You must accept that fact,
and come to terms with it.

Only then can you prevail.

Unbelievable.

We're in a fight with our

I don't care how strong Hit is,

229
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,750
there are no sure things

I've tried to keep up
with your career, though.

you're now an ace

in the Sadala Defense Force's
Saiyan Elite Corps.

I couldn't have done it if not
for your training, Captain.

Oh. I see.

a new fighting move.

of fighters possible.

There is one way I can
help you, though.

The fighter you should
be recruiting is Caulifla.

Uh. Wait.

No, I think she's
an amazing fighter,

289

it's just that I sometimes...

see eye-to-eye, is all.

I know, she's a rebel.

A punk, if I'm being blunt.

293

But still, Caulifla's latent
abilities far outclass my own.

I think we've both
warmed up enough.

From here on out,
the gloves are off.

You're strong,
that much I'm aware of.

But you have another weakness.

303
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:01,583
And unless you can overcome it,

304
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,583
you won't last long
in the Tournament.

won't be far behind.

Did you really think I was

00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,041
sittin' on my hands
all this time,

321

buried in some textbook?

[PICCOLO]
Gohan, it's over.

326
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,375
You're strong, but you lack--

327
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:20,750
Well...

328
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,833
You just might not have
the heart of a true warrior.

329
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,625
If there's a chance to win,
you have to close the deal.

330
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:27,541
[gasps]

331
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,333
It's an old problem.

332
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,000
Remember when you
fought Majin Buu,

333
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,458
after the Elder Kai
drew out your power?

334
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:36,958
You were overcome by a
different feeling: arrogance.

335
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,583
You had struggled for so long
to unlock your potential

336
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,875
that when you did,
you enjoyed it too much.

337
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,875
Instead of using your
strength to win,

338
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,250
your arrogance left
you open to attack.

339
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,583
Succumb to that again,

340
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:50,791
and you'll lose no matter
how powerful you are.

341
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,208
Be a warrior!

342
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,291
No matter the opponent,

343
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,916
you fight with
everything you've got!

344
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,583
All right, Piccolo.

345
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:01,625
This time, I won't let you down.

[yelling]

347
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,791
Ha. I want to see something

348
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,416
even more powerful than
just Super Saiyan!

[GOHAN grunting]

[PICCOLO] Show me the power you
had when you fought against Buu!

351
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,875
Re-awaken the fighter
you truly are!

How's that?

354
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,250
So is this what you
wanted to see?

355
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,791
That's perfect, Gohan.

Piccolo!

00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:41,625
[PICCOLO]
Yes, that's it. That's good.

364
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:42,875
Huh?!

365
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:44,833
If you can fight like
this in the Tournament,

366
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:50,041
then those other universes don't
stand a chance against our team.

367
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,791
Thank you, Piccolo.

[GOHAN groans]

371
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,583
But you didn't close the deal.

372
00:18:58,666 --> 00:18:59,791
It's the same thing
that happened

373
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,291
when you fought against Buu.

374
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,875
You thought you defeated him,
and dropped your guard.

375
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,875
Which allowed him to sneak up
from behind and absorb you!

376
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,500
[GOHAN gasps]

377
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,416
It's not entirely your fault.

378
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,583
Your father often makes
the same mistake.

379
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,333
Don't you forget this.

380
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:16,916
Stay focused.

381
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,833
Drop your arrogance
and keep your guard up

382
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,875
until the tournament's over.

383
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,458
Right.

384
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,625
[PICCOLO]
Good! Let's go again!

385
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,500

All right, Piccolo.

389
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:46,708
Thanks again for the training.

390
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:47,791
Oh, no.

391
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:50,250
Your training is
only getting started.

392
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:51,583
[GOHAN]
What?

393
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,875
Listen, I believe that
what you tapped into today

394
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,416
was actually a fraction
of your latent power.

395
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,208
We pushed through one wall and
now I wanna find the next.

396
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,000
[PICCOLO]
Aren't you curious?

397
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,750
Don't you wanna know
how strong you truly are?

398
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:09,833
Don't settle for being better,
when you could be the best.

399
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:12,083
Tournament doesn't
start till tomorrow.

400
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:13,875
We still have a little time.

401
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,500
Let's put it to good use.

402
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:19,166
You wanna be stronger than
you've ever been, right?

403
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,708
Stronger than I've ever been.

404
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:23,916
Yeah.

405
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,916
Let's do it!

406
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,291
Oh, and since we'll be
hangin' out together,

407
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,666
maybe we can come up with
some combos moves, too?

408
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,291
[PICCOLO]
Combo moves, huh?

409
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:35,083
[GOHAN] Yeah! We'll need
every advantage we can get.

410
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:36,625
[PICCOLO]
Interesting...

411
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:39,875
[PICCOLO chuckles]
All right, why not!

412
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,166
[NARRATOR] Thanks to Piccolo's
intensive training,

413
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,500
Gohan's preparations
for the tournament

414
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,458
are proceeding quickly.

415
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:51,500
We are now just 9 hours
and 30 minutes away

416
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,291
from the start of the
Tournament of Power!

417
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:57,000
What is the depth
of Gohan's abilities?

418
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,125
What combo moves
can he and Piccolo

419
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,291
master in the remaining time?

420
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,958
How well can they
fight as a team?

421
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,666
And most importantly:

422
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:09,916
who will take the final slots
for the Seventh Universe?

423
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,750
[YAMCHA]
All right, he'll ask me,

424
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:16,041
but first I'm gonna
play hard-to-get.

"The 'Tournament of Power?,' eh?

to wash my hair that night."

428
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:25,291
Or, wait. Maybe I should
go for false modesty.

"But I'm not on
your level, Goku.

I'd only hold the
rest of you back."

431
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,541
Nah, that doesn't
sound believable.

[YAMCHA] And what's with him
taking so long to ask?

I mean, really, Puar.

Don't you think he should
have been here by now!

Wait! Knowing Goku, he'll just
use Instant Transmission!

No? Okay, what about here?

Ah, you can zap yourself
in anytime now!

and our team will be set!
