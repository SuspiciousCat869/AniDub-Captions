Great Saiyaman
got his own movie!

Gohan worked as
the movie's stuntman

20
00:01:57,416 --> 00:02:00,583

thanks to the scheming

Barry Kahn.

love proved stronger

this symbiotic menace

lose the little piggy

riding our tail!

We could barely keep up!

Where did you learn
to ride like that?

164

Well it's not that complicated--
you just don't use the brakes.

Are you okay?

00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,583
I'm fine.
It's just a flesh wound.

Oh, thank heavens.
You're a hero!

He's a monster!

I'm not a monster!

your help, citizen!

I'm guessing you didn't
rush into town to save us.

So, why are you here?

194
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,791
I wanna get some
good training in!

195
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,416
And to do that,
I need a good partner!

You wanna train with me?

just take a bullet in the arm?

I don't think training
with you is a good idea, okay?

203
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,583
I can't give you
what you're looking for.

You gotta remember,
I don't fight anymore.

in the fight with everyone else!

as we're training again...

with Master Roshi!

this little training session

I'm back as a fighter.

[GOKU]
Really? Are you sure?

255
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,125
[KRILLIN] Yeah.
I saved that other officer,

256
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,583
but I shouldn't have
let myself get hit at all.

Why are you guys here
so early in the morning?

262
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:08,083
[KRILLIN] Sorry, Master Roshi.
I know it's been a long time,

263
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:11,000
but I'm humbly asking you
to train me again.

264
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:14,583
I know it's not much,
but I brought you a gift.

00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,625
[ROSHI]
Ooh-ho-ho!

266
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:24,041
[ROSHI] Those are some
prime cuts of babe!

267
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:27,125
Wow. They're even tastier
than my breakfast!

268
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:28,875
Krillin, didn't you
give him a gift like this

269
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,458
back when we first met him?

270
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:31,791
[ROSHI grunts]

271
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,708
Ow! Hey, why'd you hit me for?

272
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:36,291
Because! You didn't
pay your respects to me!

273
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,208
You'd think a man
with a grandkid of his own

274
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,833
would treat his elders right!

275
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:43,666
Jeez, I'm sorry. You don't
have to hit me, though.

276
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:47,125
Master Roshi, we'd be honored
if you'd train us again.

277
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,666
That's much better.

278
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,416
[GOKU] Great! Where should
we start the sparring?

279
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,708
In here, or on the beach?

280
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:54,041
Goku, if you've already
obtained divine power,

281
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,750
I don't really think I can give
you what you're looking for.

282
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,916
[GOKU] What? That's almost
the exact same thing

283
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,625
Krillin told me earlier!

284
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,583
But there is a way
for Goku and I

285
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,083
to both get what we want.

286
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,750
If you'll train me, he'll have
a better sparring partner.

287
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:09,208
Maybe he's far beyond
what a mortal can teach,

288
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,750
but you can sure help me!

289
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,208
Make me stronger, Master,

290
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:15,416
so I can be a proud father
and better officer!

291
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,916
[ROSHI]
Heh...

292
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,333
[GOKU] Hey! How come
I'm stuck wearing the goofy

293
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:24,125
turtle costume!
It's not even comfortble.

294
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,791
This thing weighs a ton!

295
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:29,250
[ROSHI laughing]
It looks good on you!

296
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,250
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!

297
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,958
I can't even walk in this thing!

298
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:35,375
You are not allowed
to fly against me, either.

299
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,583
[GOKU]
Aw, man.

300
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,375
The same goes for
turning Super Saiyan.

301
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:39,875
[GOKU]
Ah, come on!

302
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,333
Well, I gotta handicap you!

303
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:43,083
You've gotten so powerful,
you could kill me

304
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,916
with a single attack, Goku!

305
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,291
Look, to be honest, I don't
trust you to pull punches.

306
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,916
[GOKU] Man, this won't be
training for <i>me</i> at all.

307
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,750
[ROSHI]
Just get to it, already!

308
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,041
We'll start with some freestyle.

309
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:57,750
All right, I'll give
this turtle suit a shot.

310
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,375
Come at me hard, Krillin!

311
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,458
Okay, here goes nothing'!

312
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,500
[KRILLIN yells]

313
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,250
[GOKU chuckles]

314
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,333
[ROSHI]
Hmmm.

315
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,791
--[KRILLIN] Huh?
--[GOKU chuckles]

316
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,708
[KRILLIN] This is crazy!
How does he do it?

317
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,583
Even wearing that
silly turtle costume,

318
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,375
he seems as fast as ever!

319
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:27,166
[GOKU grunts]

320
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,250
Uuh!

321
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,250
[ROSHI]
Enough!

322
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:39,708
[KRILLIN panting]

323
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,625
[GOKU]
Krillin! Nice work!

324
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,333
You actually made that
a halfway decent

325
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:44,875
training session for me!

326
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:47,875
[KRILLIN]
Oh, great. He-heh.

327
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:54,916
[GOKU snoring]

328
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:02,458
[KRILLIN grunting]

329
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,083
[sighs]

330
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:28,333
Son, I can tell you're lost.

331
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:29,958
You're frustrated
with your strength

332
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,416
and you want to get better,

333
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,333
but you don't know
how go about it.

334
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:35,041
So, you end up stuck in place,

335
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,791
which only makes you
feel more frustrated!

336
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:40,583
I know all that just from
seeing the little hesitations

337
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,083
in your fists and footwork.

338
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,666
[KRILLIN]
My little girl, Marron,

339
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,750
says she wants a strong dad.

340
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,166
[ROSHI]
Mm.

341
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:54,166
[KRILLIN] I got called timid.
Well, a wimp, really,

342
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,500
by my own wife.

343
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,916
[yawns]

344
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,041
Now then, today's training's
will not be easy!

345
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,166
[BOTH gulp]

346
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,416
[ROSHI]
You're running an errand.

347
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,708
An errand?

348
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,041
Huh?

349
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,041
Yeah, well, the truth is
I'm actually not as young

350
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,916
as you probably think I am.

351
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,791
So. I need you to go pick
a rare medicinal herb

352
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,375
to help boost my strength.

353
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:26,166
Whaddaya mean, pick it?
Like, pick it up at the store?

354
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,583
They don't sell it
in stores! Look!

355
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,125
Ooh!

356
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,791
I've never seen that
herb before. What's it called?

357
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,666
They call it the paradise herb.

358
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:39,416
It's a rare, precious plant
found on only one island.

359
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,041
And on that island,
it's found in only the deepest,

360
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,875
darkest part of the forest.

361
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,166
Sounds like fun!

362
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,666
There's more.
The errand's also a race.

363
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,500
Oh, yeah? Now this is
sounding better and better!

364
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:51,833
A race, huh?

365
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,208
And whoever brings me back
one of the herbs first

366
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,375
will win this prize!

367
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,291
My treasured
magazine collection--

368
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,875
each one approved
by yours truly!

369
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,041
Come on. You gotta give us
something better than that.

370
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,541
Krillin, help me out here, bro.

371
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,666
Yeah.

372
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,375
You want a better
prize than this?

373
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:08,791
Nothing's better than this!

374
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,708
I can't believe young fellas
like yourselves

375
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,875
have no need for my magazines!

376
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,708
Look, if we don't want 'em,
we don't want 'em. That's all.

377
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:18,708
All right, fine. And here
I was thinking I might also

378
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,625
give the winner a bonus prize.

379
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,541
I was gonna teach him
a secret technique

380
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,208
that instantly boosts
his fighting energy.

381
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:26,875
--[BOTH] Ooh!
--[KRILLIN chuckles]

382
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,416
That sounds awesome!
We'll take that prize!

383
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,083
[ROSHI chuckles]
Well, good luck then!

384
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,833
He's a funny guy.
Master Roshi never changes.

385
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,375
You haven't changed either.

386
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,208
Do you really think so?

387
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:46,416
What has changed is how
strong you are compared to me.

388
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,708
What? Can ya
say that again please?

389
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,833
There's too much wind noise.

390
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,791
Oh. It's nothing important.

391
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:55,416
Aw, c'mon!
Now you got me curious!

392
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,875
Really, Goku, it's not
important. I promise.

393
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:00,000
Okay.

394
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,708
We're almost there!

395
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:11,083
[birds chirping]

396
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:15,583
[GOKU] Aw, man! We gotta search
all this for one little plant?

397
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,791
[KRILLIN] Man, I wish he
gave us a hint or something.

398
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,125
[GOKU]
I know, right?

399
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,333
[BABA]
Hold it right there!

400
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,458
--[GOKU, KRILLIN gasp]
--[GOKU] It's you?

401
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,250
[BABA]
Long time no see!

402
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,500
Master Roshi's
older sister, right?

403
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:33,958
The fortune-seller!

404
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,500
[BABA]
Aah!

405
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:36,916
That's fortune-teller!

406
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,791
I don't really see
much of a diffence.

407
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,708
Of course there's a difference!

408
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,916
So, what are you doing
on this island?

409
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,625
[BABA] I'm here
'cause my brother asked.

410
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:49,291
He wants to use my crystal ball
to watch the rest of the race.

411
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,833
Does that mean we still
have further to go

412
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,166
to reach the plant?

413
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,708
Oh, yeah, this is perfect.

414
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,333
If you know where the plant is,
you can just tell us, right?

415
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:58,541
[BABA] If I told you,
it wouldn't be training!

416
00:19:58,625 --> 00:19:59,541
[GOKU]
Aw.

417
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,333
You better start looking, boys!

418
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:04,958
The herb is somewhere
in that forest!

419
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:08,625
You hear that, Krillin.
The paradise herb race is on!

420
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,416
And, they're off!

421
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,375
They're calling this a race,
but it seems more like

422
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,375
it'll be a marathon!

423
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,250
We could be running around
this island for months

424
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,291
until we stumble upon it.

425
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,583
[GOKU]
Whoa!

426
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:30,333
[KRILLIN] It's like a giant
sculpture of Baba's face!

427
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,625
--[BABA] I heard that!
--[GOKU] Ah!

428
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:36,416
[BABA] This is where
your true training begins!

429
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:44,875
--Hey, uh, Goku?
--[GOKU] Hm?

430
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:46,583
[KRILLIN] Is it just me,
or does this place

431
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,375
give off a weird vibe?

432
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:51,250
[GOKU] Oh, yeah.
It's way creepy in here!

433
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,833
[KRILLIN] I'm actually
getting a little scared.

434
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,750
Huh?

435
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:08,000
[KRILLIN]
Aah. Goku, what's going on?

436
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,375
[GOKU]
I don't know,

437
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:12,125
but somehow
it just got creepier!

438
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,125
Oh, no way!

439
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:32,166
What are these guys doing back?

440
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:41,500
[GOKU] It's everyone we've ever
defeated, all in one spot!

441
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:45,333
Uh! Goku! Look over there!

442
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:51,166
[hollers]

443
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,333
[KRILLIN]
Oh, no. What're we gonna do?

444
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,541
<i>An angel and a demon sit</i>

445
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:03,458
<i>One to my right,</i>
<i>one to my left</i>

446
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:09,541
<i>In between I'm tryin'</i>
<i>to figure out the right way</i>

447
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:12,458
<i>Is one way good?</i>
<i>Is one way bad?</i>

448
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:15,708
<i>Too much confusion in my head</i>

449
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:21,000
<i>I can't think with all</i>
<i>this noise, I'm goin' crazy</i>

450
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:25,083
<i>Is there any way to know</i>
<i>what's right or wrong?</i>

451
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:30,125
<i>Demons in an angel mask</i>

452
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:33,083
<i>Hopin' that I'll do</i>
<i>just what they ask</i>

453
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:36,166
<i>Telling me</i>
<i>they know what's right</i>

00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,125
<i>Lead me to the light</i>

<i>"For the sake of everyone</i>

<i>You have to destroy</i>

457
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:48,250
<i>That's the only path, you see"</i>

458
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:51,916
<i>So they said to me</i>

459
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:02,000
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

460
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:04,416
What's going on
in this weird forest?!

461
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,041
It's like everyone
we ever defeated

462
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:08,041
just stepped out of the fog.

463
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:10,541
Krillin, watch out!
They're attacking us!

464
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:13,541
C'mon, man, this is
no time to freeze up!

465
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,291
We gotta lay these guys out
so we can get

466
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:18,500
the paradise herb
for Master Roshi!

467
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:20,708
Next time
on Dragon Ball Super:

468
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:22,666
"Conquer the Terrifying Foes!

469
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:25,208
Krillin's Fighting
Spirit Rebounds!"

470
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:27,166
Make sure you don't
miss it, okay?
