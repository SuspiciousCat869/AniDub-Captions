for your next match, aren't you?

318
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,550
[FROST] Why would you
suggest such a strategy?

319
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:14,120
[GOKU] 'Cause I've been
doing the same thing!

320
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,290
[FROST]
Huh?

321
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:21,660
[GOKU bellows]

322
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,670
What's he doing?

323
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,600
Since when can you Saiyans
transform like that, Cabba?

324
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,270
Since never! I haven't
seen or even heard of

325
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,640
anything remotely like this.

326
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,550
Are you ready, Sixth Universe?

327
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,050
You're about to meet
a Super Saiyan!

328
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,580
[GOKU] From here on out,
neither of us holds back, Frost!

329
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,390
Let's both agree
that from now on

330
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,120
we will use our full power.

331
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,660
Now, you give me your final
form like I asked you to!

332
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:51,090
Very well, but then
you'll see the true reason

333
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,200
I've concealed my final form.

334
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,260
And that reason has
nothing to do with keeping

335
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:59,470
something in reserve for matches
later in this tournament.

336
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:04,070
[FROST bellows]

337
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:07,140
Ha!

338
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,610
All right, all right! Enough!

339
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,350
[FROST] Controlling my power
in this final form

340
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:19,390
is exceedingly difficult. It is
best used only to destroy.

341
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,790
As such, there has been
but one time I have been

342
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:24,590
forced to use it
against an adversary.

343
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:27,030
After what happened
in that fateful duel,

344
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:30,730
I've kept it locked away
ever since. But you, Goku...

345
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,640
I believe that in you
I have met someone

346
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:35,470
able to match its full
destructive fury.

347
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:38,340
Good! Don't hold back;
I can take it!

348
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:42,750
Hm. I have truly enjoyed
meeting you, warrior. All right!

349
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,620
[yells]

350
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:50,750
Behold, Goku.
This is my full power!

351
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,570
[yells]

352
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:11,540

[6TH SUPREME KAI gasps]

354
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,280
See. I told you
you shouldn't feel

355
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,350
too confident, young fella.

356
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:28,660
It can't be.
How are you so strong?

357

--[GOKU grunts]
--[FROST groans]

359
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,440
I take it that's the limit
of your final form's power.

360
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,710
Since you seem like
an honorable guy, Frost,

361
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,210
I don't want to hurt you
any more than I have to.

362
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,580
Tap out and let your teammates
take it from here.

363
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,850
I appreciate your
concern for my health,

364
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:56,150
but I'll never give in
to you or anyone else

365
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,250
from your universe's team.

366
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,860
I'm fighting for a cause.

367
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:03,490
It's imperative I win this
match, and then the tournament.

368
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:05,360
So I can continue to forge peace

369
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,730
by securing
Lord Champa's support!

370
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,640
Baah!

[yells]

372
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,850
I can't watch this anymore!

373
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,950
C'mon! It's not over yet, Frost!

374
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,480
Okay, now what?

375
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,850
He seems so nice.

376
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:34,420
[FROST] "No matter
what happens, never give up.

377
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,390
Get back on your feet."

378
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,730
That's right. The same
encouragement I give

379
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:44,330
my liberated orphans is
the encouragement I'll use now!

[NARRATOR]
In a stunning turn,

390
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:25,940
Goku has fallen
outside the ring.

391
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:29,980
Can the Seventh Universe prevail
without the powerful Saiyan?

392
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:35,280
The battles continue, next time
on Dragon Ball Super.

393
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,310
Goodbye to our adventure

394
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,820
In twilight we must go our separate ways

395
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:57,350
And try to discover the path to our own destiny

396
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,600
I can't find the words

397
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,130
to tell you how much our parting hurts

398
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,630
I hope you know I'll always love you

399
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:07,580
And all that we shared will be remembered

400
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,890
How could I forget your face?

401
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,790
All my memories erased

402
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,870
I can still hear the melody of your voice

403
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,430
Petals fall in from above

404
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,070
Fade away, all that we love

405
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:28,580
In the twilight,

406
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:28,580
fade away,

407
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,580

Hey, it's me, Goku!

412
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:43,460
I have no idea what kind of
super-punch Frost used on me

413
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,880
but now it's up to Piccolo
to find a way to win

414
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,470
'cause if we lose another match,
I don't even wanna know what Beerus will do.

415
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:52,930
Piccolo might not be on the same level
as us anymore when it comes to power

416
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:55,850
but with the right technique
he just might even the score.

417
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:58,390
Next time on Dragon Ball Super:

418
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,030
Make sure you don't miss it, okay?
