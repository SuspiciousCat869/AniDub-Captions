Now call off the fight, Gohan.

[ROSHI] That leaves no doubt:
Gohan is back in fighting shape.

And that combination
move with Piccolo

195
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,791
was quite impressive.
However...

isn't over just yet.

[GOKU]
Ya did good, Gohan.

Just a quick training

your old fighting chops.

You've already shown us the
hard work you've put in today.

206
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,666
It's pointless to
continue this fight!

It's all right.

[GOWASU grunting]

212
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:44,333
Why do I have to pick the
fighters for Universe Ten!

213
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:45,958
There are too many
things to consider

214

when trying to win a
cosmic battle royale!

215
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,750
What if I end up enabling
another reprehensible character,

216
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,083
like Zamasu?

217

[RUMUSH]
You're overthinking this.

218

[GOWASU]
Hm?

219
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,125
[RUMUSH]
It's a flaw of yours.

220
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,041
One of many, really.

221
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,041
Wait? What do you mean?

00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,083
Have you come to insult me?

about this, you're paralyzed!

00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,833
Yes, but understandably so.

225
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:13,041
Our survival hangs
on the outcome.

226

Would you rather I randomly
grab warriors for our team?

All I'm saying is that
it's not that complex.

228

You need to change
your approach.

Stop trying to find the
fighters with your brain

and use your body.

Don't rely on tiresome logic.

understand you, Rumush.

This contest calls for muscle,

You failed to put
together a team

because you couldn't
recognize this fact.

the way your brain never could.

more, you say?

I couldn't make a decision,

If you want to get as
shredded as we are,

267
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,916
it's essential that you chug

every hour, on the hour.

Well, what do you think?

fighting, anyway--
