00:08:27,622 --> 00:08:29,332
Farewell now.

162
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,376
[FRIEZA laughs]

163
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:32,711
[GOHAN gasps]

164
00:08:32,794 --> 00:08:36,506
[FRIEZA laughs] You seem
to be having difficulties.

165
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:37,382
[GOHAN growls]

166
00:08:37,465 --> 00:08:38,550
[FRIEZA chuckles]

167
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:39,926
A friend of yours?

168
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,886
Good, perfect timing!

169
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:44,889
Save Junior's rear and
show him how it's done!

170
00:08:44,973 --> 00:08:49,561
[FRIEZA laughs] How are you
struggling against this runt?

171
00:08:49,644 --> 00:08:51,563
It would seem you failed
to inherit any of your

172
00:08:51,646 --> 00:08:55,025
Daddy's skills. Is he
as disappointed as I am?

173
00:08:55,108 --> 00:08:56,359
What'd you say?

174
00:08:56,443 --> 00:08:57,819
[FRIEZA]
Well, so much for the great

175
00:08:57,902 --> 00:09:00,405
and powerful Saiyan
warrior race.

176
00:09:00,488 --> 00:09:02,073
But perhaps this
is the opportunity

177
00:09:02,157 --> 00:09:04,034
I've been waiting for.

178
00:09:04,117 --> 00:09:08,872
Oh, knock off the pontificating
and get to it already!

179
00:09:20,425 --> 00:09:21,718
Hey, Frieza?!

180
00:09:21,801 --> 00:09:24,387
Why isn't he attacking
the other fighter?

181
00:09:24,471 --> 00:09:25,722
I don't like this.

182
00:09:25,805 --> 00:09:28,058
You don't think Frieza's
planning to turn on Gohan

183
00:09:28,141 --> 00:09:30,643
to get him out of the
competition, do you?

184
00:09:30,727 --> 00:09:33,021
Why would he take out
his own teammate?

185
00:09:33,104 --> 00:09:35,315
Frieza knows it's
a numbers game, right?

186
00:09:35,398 --> 00:09:38,860
If the Seventh Universe loses,
he'll be erased along with us!

187
00:09:38,943 --> 00:09:41,029
Yeah, well.
You don't know Frieza.

188
00:09:41,112 --> 00:09:43,073
He really is a rotten bastard.

189
00:09:43,156 --> 00:09:44,616
[BEERUS]
Hm?

190
00:09:44,699 --> 00:09:46,659
There's no doubt in my mind
that creep's working some angle,

191
00:09:46,743 --> 00:09:50,538
plotting to use this opportunity
for some nefarious purpose.

192
00:09:50,622 --> 00:09:52,999
What do you mean,
"nefarious" purpose?

193
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:56,670
I thought his reason for being
here was to obtain resurrection.

194
00:09:56,753 --> 00:09:58,797
Yes, but even so...

195
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,926
He could have an
ulterior motive. Mm...

196
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:05,595
If he makes it to the end of the
tournament and proves himself

197
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:09,724
the strongest fighter, he'll be
awarded the Super Dragon Balls.

198
00:10:09,808 --> 00:10:11,810
And then, he could
make a wish far greater

199
00:10:11,893 --> 00:10:15,730
than anything that Earth's
orbs could possibly fulfill.

200
00:10:15,814 --> 00:10:18,400
Such as erasing a deity,
for example.

201
00:10:18,483 --> 00:10:19,943
[ALL gasp]

202
00:10:20,026 --> 00:10:23,488
If that's true, he must
see Gohan as an obstacle

203
00:10:23,571 --> 00:10:26,241
to winning this thing
and getting his wish.

204
00:10:26,324 --> 00:10:28,827
[KRILLIN growls]
I really hate that guy!

205
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,162
So long as the possibility
remains for Frieza

206
00:10:31,246 --> 00:10:33,123
to be granted a wish,
given that we don't know

207
00:10:33,206 --> 00:10:35,667
what that wish might entail,
you won't be able to feel safe,

208
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,836
my lord, even if
the Seventh does prevail.

209
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:39,254
[BEERUS growls]

210
00:10:39,337 --> 00:10:43,174
Hey! Frieza! If you lay
a finger on that kid,

211
00:10:43,258 --> 00:10:45,844
I will strike you down
where you stand!

212
00:10:45,927 --> 00:10:47,846
[JIMIZU laughs]

213
00:10:47,929 --> 00:10:52,392
[JIMIZU] I can see that your
soul is a truly ugly one.

214
00:10:52,475 --> 00:10:55,020
For the love and peace
of the Second Universe,

215
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,439
I shall defeat you
both together!

216

[laughs]

217
00:10:58,982 --> 00:11:02,027
Amusing as it would be to
see you make the attempt...

218
00:11:03,486 --> 00:11:06,448
[FRIEZA] ...I prefer to do
my fighting one on one.

219
00:11:06,531 --> 00:11:09,117
I'll just sit back and observe
until you're done with him.

220
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,287
So please, put on
a good show for me.

221
00:11:13,872 --> 00:11:16,458
Abandoning your own
ally in battle?

222
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:19,794
My goodness, what an
unbecoming universe.

It's over.

to defeat you.

Uh?

[FRIEZA laughs]

233
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:02,337
Pardon me. My hand
must've slipped just now.

234
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,880
What's your problem?

235
00:12:03,963 --> 00:12:06,466
Wait, I thought you had said
you weren't going to interfere.

236
00:12:06,549 --> 00:12:09,594
[FRIEZA] Yes, but then I got
bored and had a change of heart.

[FRIEZA laughs]

dispense with you first!

But how did you...?

Since I know about
your proclivity for,

and overreliance on

there's really nothing to it.

[PELL] He killed him!
He's disqualified!

258
00:13:03,148 --> 00:13:04,691
What? Kill him?

259
00:13:04,774 --> 00:13:09,112
Do you honestly believe I could
make such a foolish mistake?

[JIMIZU groans]

261
00:13:10,447 --> 00:13:12,782
I avoided anything
that's immediately vital.

262

Though of course...
I cannot be held accountable

for what happens once
he's out of the... ring!

has been eliminated, sires.

I know, Jimizu, I know.
Don't say another word.

269
00:13:36,306 --> 00:13:39,684
[HELES] Such ugliness.
I would have never believed

270
00:13:39,768 --> 00:13:43,605
that anyone in the cosmos
could fight so dirty!

Hey, Frieza!

274
00:13:48,318 --> 00:13:52,197
[FRIEZA] Hm? Oh, dear.
Why the sour look on your face?

275
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,282
This is what happens
when you hold back--

276
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:57,410
declining to use
your full strength.

277
00:13:57,494 --> 00:13:59,954
Hmph. You could've
turned Super Saiyan

278
00:14:00,038 --> 00:14:01,915
and actually put up
something of a fight,

279
00:14:01,998 --> 00:14:03,166
but no, no, no.

280
00:14:03,249 --> 00:14:05,669
You waste your time
sizing up opponents.

281

It is one of the many
annoying flaws

Well, look who's back!

Oh come on, what is
Frost up to now?

291
00:14:27,065 --> 00:14:30,193
Perhaps, sir, he wants to
challenge Frieza himself.

292
00:14:30,276 --> 00:14:33,446
Uh...? Hey, are you
outta your mind?!

293
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:36,408
Don't try to be a hero!
You can't take him!

You have nothing to
worry about, Lord Champa.

295
00:14:39,369 --> 00:14:41,454
Our intended foe...

296
00:14:41,538 --> 00:14:46,001
...is this half-Saiyan who
doesn't know when to quit.

297
00:14:46,084 --> 00:14:47,627
Did he just say "our"?

298
00:14:47,711 --> 00:14:50,922
As in, he and Frieza are working
together to take out Gohan?!

Heh, I suppose the cat
is out of the bag now.

301
00:14:55,093 --> 00:14:59,556
Heh, I was hoping to keep it
a secret a wee bit longer.

302
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:01,891
Frost and myself share
a common loathing

303
00:15:01,975 --> 00:15:04,394
of the Saiyan race.

304
00:15:04,477 --> 00:15:06,730
As such, we've agreed
to join forces.

305
00:15:06,813 --> 00:15:08,273
How charming.

306
00:15:08,356 --> 00:15:11,484
Then what would you say to
us teaming up, on the sly?

307
00:15:11,568 --> 00:15:14,029
Oh, yes, by all means.

308
00:15:14,112 --> 00:15:15,655
[FROST, FRIEZA laugh]

309
00:15:15,739 --> 00:15:17,657
[ROSHI]
So that's what his angle was!

310
00:15:17,741 --> 00:15:19,909
He didn't save Gohan
right away in that fight

311
00:15:19,993 --> 00:15:23,371
with Jimizu because he wanted
Gohan to waste his energy,

312
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:26,833
making it easier for Frieza and
his new best friend to win!

313
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,376
[SUPREME KAI]
Then Frieza's goal really is

314
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,211
to be the last man standing.

315
00:15:30,295 --> 00:15:32,797
So he can get a wish from
those Super Dragon Balls.

316
00:15:32,881 --> 00:15:36,051
And then erase anyone

Please, be my guest and
take the first crack at him.

319
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:41,556
And by all means,

320
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:43,975
use as much force as you
deem pleasurable.

321
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:46,436
You're kind, but after you.

323
00:15:48,104 --> 00:15:50,607
Well, all right, if you insist.

[CHAMPA]
Well, how about that?

I don't really know
what's happening,

326
00:15:53,818 --> 00:15:54,861
but if they're
fighting each other

327
00:15:54,944 --> 00:15:56,363
that's good news for our team!

Forgive my caution,

329
00:15:57,822 --> 00:16:00,033
but I must make certain that
you're truly committed

330

to this alliance of ours.

331
00:16:02,327 --> 00:16:05,497
Because if you intend
to double-cross me...

332
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,375
I see your trust in me
is less than complete.

this way too much!

to show your true power?

[laughing] In that case,

00:17:23,658 --> 00:17:26,911
I suppose I ought to start
getting serious, as well.

Attaboy, Frieza!

00:18:17,837 --> 00:18:20,507
With him on our side, the
Sixth Universe is unstoppable!

We're guaranteed victory!

That was outstanding.

[FRIEZA]
Hm?

00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:32,686
I didn't know you possessed
such incredible power.

00:18:32,769 --> 00:18:36,189
[FRIEZA] With a little effort,
you too can reach this level.

00:18:36,272 --> 00:18:37,774
[FROST]
You really think so?

380

[FRIEZA]
Well, maybe not Golden.

[FRIEZA grunting]

382
00:18:46,533 --> 00:18:49,285
But you should at least
be able to do this.

383
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:51,287
[FROST]
Undoubtedly.

384
00:18:51,371 --> 00:18:53,623
[FROST grunting]

385
00:18:56,543 --> 00:18:59,337
[FRIEZA] Very good.
You know, there's a secret

386
00:18:59,421 --> 00:19:01,589
to fighting more
efficiently in this form.

387
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:03,133
Would you like me to teach you?

388
00:19:03,216 --> 00:19:05,010
[FROST]
Yes, please do!

389
00:19:05,093 --> 00:19:07,595
In combat, it's best to
hit your stride early on,

390
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,806
maximizing your
full potential up front.

391
00:19:09,889 --> 00:19:11,349
Because this
enhanced mode we're in

392
00:19:11,433 --> 00:19:14,144
consumes energy rather
swiftly, I'm afraid.

there is one more bit of
wisdom I'd like to impart.

And that is...

397
00:19:22,652 --> 00:19:25,488
...you should never
trust anyone. Ever.

00:19:46,634 --> 00:19:49,262
So, does this mean
what I think it does?

407
00:19:49,346 --> 00:19:52,057
Those two were only
pretending to brawl.

408
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,100
When I took that
first attack from you,

409
00:19:54,184 --> 00:19:55,435
I knew right away.

410

You held back as if
it were all for show.

411
00:19:57,979 --> 00:20:00,482
So then I chose
to play along

with whatever you had planned.

413

Well, if you had been
too dense to figure it out,

then I would have had
no choice but to kill you.

go that far.

on to what he was up to,

00:23:13,883 --> 00:23:15,844
Heh, heh. I'm thrilled
to be fighting someone

477
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:18,263
as powerful as him!
There's a special technique

478
00:23:18,346 --> 00:23:20,265
I've been saving for
just such an occasion,

479
00:23:20,348 --> 00:23:22,976
but I'll need everyone to share
their spirit energy with me!

480
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:25,228
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

481
00:23:25,311 --> 00:23:27,439
"The Mightiest Enemy
Zeroes In on Goku!

482
00:23:27,522 --> 00:23:29,399
Launch the Knockout
Spirit Bomb Now!"

483
00:23:29,482 --> 00:23:31,735
Make sure you don't
miss it, okay?
