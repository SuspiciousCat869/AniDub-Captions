00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,780
It's his Special Beam Cannon!
This'll be awesome!

162
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,010
--[VEGETA] Tch!
--[GOKU] Huh?

163
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,920
To me, it seems like
a desperate effort

164
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:44,750
from a fighter who knows
he's too weak to win.

165
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,190
It looks like you're
preparing to unleash

166
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,420
some kind of
spectacular technique.

167
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,090
But it takes time,
doesn't it?

168
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:54,090
Requiring you to focus
and build a tremendous

169
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,100
amount of energy
before you use it.

170
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,130
[PICCOLO grunts]

171
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,670
Yeah. He does have a point.

172
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,000
Yes, an obvious flaw.

173
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:17,150
That's it! Don't stop now!

174
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,160
[PICCOLO grunts]

175
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:24,490
Yes! I haven't
seen that in a while!

176
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,390
Heh. Those feeble moves
won't do much

177
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,400
against a foe like Frost.

178
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,630
--[PICCOLO grunts]
--Nice try, but no!

179
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,270
[FROST grunts]

180
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,150
[PICCOLO groans]

181
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,620
Your concentration
is impressive.

182
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,560
However, with that wound,

183
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:57,360
you won't be
dodging much anymore.

184
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,490
Hm?

185
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,160
Duplicates?

186
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,700
Hey! These matches are
supposed to be one-on-one

187
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,670
not one-on-thirty!
Hey, ref! Yellow card him!

188
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,740
Or better yet,
you should make it red!

189
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,780
Disqualify him now!

190
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,380
That tactic is permmitted.

191
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,550
There are no rules against it.

192
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,750
A lowly mortal referee
does not contradict a Destroyer!

193
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,220
How dare you?!

194
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,190
Shut up! During the matches

195
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,060
the referee outranks
even us deities!

196
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,960
You don't really
mean that, do you?

197
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,600
Well, of course I don't.
That's absurd.

198
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:38,470
[FROST yells]

199
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:41,700
Aw, what's he waiting for?
He should fire now, right?

200
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:44,410
Not yet. Piccolo's
still charging up.

201
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:48,240
[KRILLIN] He's trying to win
the match with one go.

202
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,940
It'll take all he's got!

203
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,750
[FROST]
He's stalling for time.

204
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,450
And I can't see his face
through all that light.

205
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,450
I find both of these
things disturbing.

206
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:02,720
[FROST grunts, yells]

207

[PICCOLO groans]

208
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:13,770
If Frost knocks his hand away,
he'll lose that attack.

209
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,370
He's too close in!
Get some space!

[PICCOLO]
Oh, really?

What the--?

217
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,630
[FROST]
What is this?

218
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:45,770
[PICCOLO] You played
right into my hands, Frost.

219
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,800
Two things are gonna happen.

220
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,370
I hold you in place as I
charge myself up. And, then...

221
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,480
...Special Beam Cannon.

222
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,550

[BOTH]
Hmm.

225
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:23,130
[FROST] I was paying close
attention to that energy

226
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,560
you were focusing.

227
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,200
When I saw it slip
out of your fingers

228
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,530
I thought you'd lost
all chance at victory.

229
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:31,100
And so you let your
guard down, didn't you?

230
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,440
Are you saying...
getting shot in the leg

231
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:36,440
was all part of your plan
to lower my defenses?

232
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,140
--[PICCOLO] Hm.
--[FROST chuckles]

233
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,280
Well, you got me good.

234
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:43,210
Guess you literally had
this trick "up your sleeve."

235
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,050
I can't possibly
see any way for me

236
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,080
to dodge your
finishing attack now.

237
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,620
[PICCOLO]
May not look like much,

238
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:53,390
but in the Seventh Universe
I pass for resourceful.

239
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,320
In the end,
underestimating me

240
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:58,530
will prove to be
your biggest mistake.

In what way?

267
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,550
Frost has been using a weapon

268
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,850
which is prohibited
by the rules!

269
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:30,150
Weapon?

Check out his right arm.
Open your eyes.

It's something sharp and pointy.

You can't sneak
anything past this guy!

Hold your tongue!

Baseless accusations
are beyond the pale!

That's right!
I know Mr. Frost well.

276
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,900
I fought alongside him
on Planet Mayonnai

277
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,670
and can attest to his character!

278
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,400
He's a hero
who risked his life

279

to rescue its citizens from
marauding space pirates!

280

He would never cheat!

281

They're right.
Frost doesn't seem like

the kinda guy who'd fight dirty.

you lost! But all right.

find nothing on him,

off my nose, after all.

it is just Jaco.

A-ha!

305
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,250
What is the meaning of this?

306
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,020
I assure you
this is not a weapon!

307
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:11,820
It's part of my body!

308
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,660
No. No way.

309
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:16,960
There are some clear signs
of trickery at play here!

310

For violating the rules
of the tournament,

311
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,660
Frost is disqualified!

312
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:26,440
Which means the
winner is... Piccolo!

Nice going, Jaco!

315
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:33,280
For the first time ever
you actually seem useful!

316
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,940
Are you kidding me here?

317
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,450
I don't get it! Why would
somebody as honorable as him

318
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,720
ever do something
that's so underhanded?

319
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,320
Gentlemen.
The truth is quite simple.

320
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:45,050
This is who the great
Mr. Frost truly is.

321
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,720
You see, those space pirates
who attacked Planet Mayonnai

322
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,660
are part of an underworld
crime syndicate,

323
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:51,730
and Mr. Frost here
is the group's leader.

324
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,060
That can't be!

325
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,700
[ALL gasp]

326
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:58,700
You accuse me of
such terrible things, Vados.

327
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:04,340
I'm so hurt.
[laughs]

328
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,580
Yes, I start my own wars.

329
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,010
But then I resolve them
and buy up all the

330
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:12,820
war-ravaged land
at bargain prices.

331
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:15,550
After that, I make a killing
off the very lucrative

332
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:19,760
post-reconstruction profits.
I'm tellin' ya,

333
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,320
it's quite a business model
I've cooked up here.

334
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,760
I'm the problem
 and the solution.

335
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,060
Aw!

336
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,160
That's funny.
Now he doesn't seem to be

337
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,400
all that different from Frieza.

338
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,770
He passes himself off
as a noble savior

339
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,670
to provide cover for
all his nefarious plans.

340
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:38,240
Hmph! Even in another
universe, there's no way

341
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,240
Frieza could ever be
legitimately good at his core.

342
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,850
[ALL booing]

343
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,390
[PICCOLO] So, if anyone's gonna
walk out of here a disgrace,

344
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,160
looks like it'll be you, Frost!

345
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,590
You can tell yourself that,
but we both know

346
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:01,700
who really won. Turns out
you underestimating me

347
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:04,570
was your big mistake,
Mr. Resourceful.

348
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,640
Are you nuts?
How could you go

349
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,870
and pick that creep
to be on my team?

350
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:10,410
My lord, you never
asked me to take

351
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,740
the candidates' morality
into consideration.

352
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,140
In fact, I believe your
exact words to me were,

353
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,650
"I don't want to
be bothered with this.

354
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,480
Just find fighters who
will do whatever it takes

355
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,550
to win their rounds,
no matter what."

356
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,150
[CHAMPA grunts]

357
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,820
Well, best of luck.

358
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:27,490
I hope that you give it
your all in the next match.

359
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,590
[CHAMPA grunts] You really
think you can just walk away

360
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,760
after bringing this
kind of shame on me?

361
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,500
I will destroy you!

362
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:35,800
[VEGETA]
Hold on!

363
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,470
There's no need for threats.

364
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:40,570
And no need to disqualify him.

365
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,940
'Cause I'm up next. Got that?

366
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:45,770
And I'd like to
beat that bastard myself.

367
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,980
But, your teammate
Piccolo's loss

368
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,750
has been reversed already.

369
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,410
That means he's scheduled
to fight in the next match.

370
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,980
Piccolo says
he forfeits. Right?

371
00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:00,790
[intense music plays]

372
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:05,430
Yeah. I think I'll do that.

373
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,830
Hey, wait!

374
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,700
I just called dibs on destroying
this embarrassment!

375
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:12,700
How dare you try to
take that away from me?!

376
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,970
Why not go along with this?

377
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:18,270
Our loss will be reversed,
and one of their men forfeits.

378
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,180
In terms of numbers, we win,

379
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:23,050
and we don't have to risk
anything in the process.

380
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,780
You've got a point.

381
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,880
Unless, of course, you would
prefer to lose to Lord Beerus?

382
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,520
[CHAMPA grunts]

383
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,950
Hey, Frost!
If you win this match,

384
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,460
I'll wipe the slate
and forgive you

385
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:35,790
for tarnishing
my sterling reputation!

386
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,330
And then if you
can pull of a victory

387
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,130
in the next round,
I'll even consider

388
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,600
rewarding you the way
we agreed. Got it?

389
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,000
Heh.

390
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,170
How gauche. The smirk
of a self-satisfied egotist.

391
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,880
Does that remind you
of anyone, sir?

392
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:56,150
Hey, Vegeta! Defeat
this guy once and for all!

393
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:59,820
Then I can relax! You got that?

394
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:10,230
Vegeta! You've got this!

395
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,530
[FROST] So, you want me
to keep my victory?

396
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:18,270
You must be
pretty sure of yourself.

397
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:22,670
Don't blame me if you wind up
regretting this in the end.

398
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:25,270
Shut up.
Your voice annoys me.

399
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,380
Oh, really? Too bad.

400
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:29,680
[VEGETA chuckles]

401
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,310
Goodbye to our adventure

402
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,820
In twilight we must go our separate ways

403
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:57,350
And try to discover the path to our own destiny

404
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,600
I can't find the words

405
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,130
to tell you how much our parting hurts

406
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,630
I hope you know I'll always love you

407
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:07,580
And all that we shared will be remembered

408
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,890
How could I forget your face?

409
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,790
All my memories erased

410
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,870
I can still hear the melody of your voice

411
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,430
Petals fall in from above

412

Fade away, all that we love

In the twilight,

Hey, it's me, Goku!

420
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:44,130
Man, Frost turned out to be
a pretty bad guy, didn't he?

421
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:46,590
I hate to admit it,
but he sure had me fooled!

422
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:50,050
The good news is, Vegeta won't make the same mistake I did.

423
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:52,100
He won't put up with any dirty tricks.

424
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,430
And I for one can't wait to see him go after Frost at full power.

425
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:58,890
Next time on Dragon Ball Super:
