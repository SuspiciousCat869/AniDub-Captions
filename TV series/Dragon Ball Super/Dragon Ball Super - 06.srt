00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,166
Oh you're from space, huh?

159
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,333
I guess I should have
put that together.

160
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:42,958
Well this is
a pleasant surprise.

161
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,375
To tell you the truth, I didn't
think Vegeta had friends.

162
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:46,875
No, stop!

163
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,208
I'm Bulma, Vegeta's
wife, believe it or not.

164
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,333
It's both an honor
and a pleasure to meet you.

165
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,750
Today's my birthday and
we're having a little party.

166
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:56,083
Though I guess it's a "big
party" when you rent a ship.

167
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,458
You're both welcome
to join us if you'd like to.

168
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,625
My, my, what a generous
offer, Earth Woman.

169
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:03,416
Thank you. Honestly my nose
has been tantalized

170
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,291
by some most intriguing aromas
since we came aboard.

171
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,583
In that case, let's go!

172
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,458
[VEGETA]
Wait!

173
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,041
[BULMA]
Everybody, listen up!

174
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:17,583
Allow me to introduce Vegeta's
friends, Beerus and Whis!

175
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,916
[BEERUS]
A pleasure to meet you all!

176
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,291
[cheering]

177
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:22,708
[BEERUS]
Why thank you, thank you.

178
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:25,291
You're entirely too kind.

179
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,708
[BEERUS]
Hmm?

180
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,625
Hmmm.

181
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:35,750
[chuckles]
Hello.

182
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,041
[VEGETA] He seems
to be in good spirits.

183
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,000
We might actually survive this,

184
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:43,000
assuming nobody makes him mad.

185
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,500
[BUU]
Mmm, mmm, mmm!

186
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:49,333
[VEGETA] I'd say those two are
most likely to screw things up.

187
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,625
[BULMA]
This is my old friend, Yamcha!

188
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,041
Salutations.

189
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,916
[laughs] Don't be
so formal, bring it in!

190
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,208
Ah!

191
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,958
Compared to all these
Saiyans and kids,

192
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,125
I'm kind of an old-timer.
But the fact is--

193
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,125
and I don't want to say this
too loud and embarrass people--

194
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,666
but I'm one of the greatest
martial artists here.

195
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,625
So I totally get
why you're nervous.

196
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,250
But this is a party, man.
No one's gonna start a fight!

197
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,916
You can relax, bro.

198
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:17,000
Could you be more stupid? Augh!

199
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,666
[KRILLIN]
Okay, who's hungry?

200
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,750
--[ALL gasp]
--[KRILLIN] Ha-hah!

201
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,125
What is that?

202
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,625
I don't believe
I've ever had this before.

203
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,458
[KRILLIN]
It's a party special!

204
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,791
Russian Roulette Takoyaki!

205
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,000
[ALL gasp]

206
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,625
[VEGETA]
Uuuh...

207
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,583
The way the game works
is most of these are filled

208
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:36,166
with delicious octopus
but one has wasabi instead,

209
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,000
and you won't know
'til you bite down!

210
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:41,000
So try your luck and
let's get this party started!

211
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,333
[VEGETA]
Of all of the--

212
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,750
They're not playing
your childish game!

213
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:47,166
Okay, who ordered
the party-pooper?

214
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:50,041
Yes, no one likes
a pooper of parties.

215
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,291
[laughs nervously]

216
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,541
I've never heard of
this "wasabi" you speak of,

217
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:00,916
but this roulette aspect
adds a fascinating

218
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,333
mystery and visually
it's quite pleasing.

219
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:04,750
[WHIS] That drizzled
topping reminds me

220
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:07,000
of the ultra-sweet blackfruit
sauce on Planet Banna.

221
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:09,708
Although, the smell of it
is another matter.

222
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:12,666
Quiet, Whis.
I'd rather be surprised.

223
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,083
Wow. So you're volunteering
to take the first bite, huh?

224
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,250
I guess you really do
know how to party, don't cha!

225
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:18,708
[KRILLIN]
Let's cheer 'em on, guys!

226
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:19,791
[KRILLIN]
Go Beerus!

227
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:22,166
[ALL] Go Beerus!
Go Beerus! Go Beerus!

228
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,583
[KRILLIN]
Together now!

229
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:26,416
[ALL] Go Beerus! Go Beerus!
Go Beerus! Go Beerus!

230
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,958
[VEGETA] It's all right,
no need to be alarmed.

231
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,083
There are so many,
and only one has wasabi.

232
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,958
His chance of choosing
the bad one is infinitesimal!

233
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:35,291
Please, please, please!

234
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:40,333
[intense music plays]

235
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,708
[gasps]

236
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,625
[cries out]

237
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:06,791
[gasps]

238
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:28,416
[VEGETA]
This is it; it's over.

239
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:34,666
[BEERUS grumbles]

240
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,500
It's great!

241
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:41,041
[echoes]

242
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,375
[gasps]

243
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,416
Inside a warm and fluffy
ball of powdered grain

244
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,291
lurks the chewy sensation of
an eight-armed Earth mollusk!

245
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:48,750
The combination's inspired!

246
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,208
I can't believe
I've never tried it!

247
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,875
And the sauce adds
a perfect counterbalance!

248
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,958
[WHIS]
Mm! I agree, it is tasty.

249
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,458
I'll add it to our
normal menu at once.

250
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,541
There's no wasabi.
I got lucky!

251
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:02,833
What are you talking about?

252
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,541
The wasabi ball
makes it even better.

253
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,541
It's like finding
the buried treasure!

254
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,291
Darn. Not in mine.

255
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:14,291
I don't think my heart can
take all these close calls.

256
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:17,208
Relax, buddy.
A little fun won't hurt ya.

257
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:27,125
[KRILLIN screams]

258
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:30,500
Why is it always...
gotta be me.

259
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:33,875
[BEE panting]

260
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,708
[PILAF]
Well this feels pretty nice.

261
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,708
Yeah, I'm satisfied
instead of dizzy

262
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,958
and feeling my stomach
trying to eat itself.

263
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,125
I totally forgot
what that was like.

264
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,583
When you're
feelin' this awesome,

265
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:46,625
takin' over the world seems
like way too much trouble.

266
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,375
Mhmm. It kinda does.

267
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,166
Wait, like hell it does!

268
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,666
World domination
is everything!

269
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,541
It's the only reason the
fearsome Pilaf Empire exists!

270
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,333
We will never quit,
never surrender!

271
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,125
Not even to a buffet bar!

272
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:02,750
I'm telling you, the Dragon
Balls are on this ship! See?

273
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,416
[PILAF grumbles]

274
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,458
If you're done imagining
things on the Radar, sir,

275
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,458
could you help
pack the leftovers?

276
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,333
[PILAF]
Yeah, I guess.

277
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:24,166

[dramatic music plays]

279
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,708
[GOTEN]
Here goes nothin'.

280
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:41,791
Whoa!

281
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:44,750
[chuckles]

282
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,041
[GOTEN]
Aw, man!

283
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,541
[TRUNKS]
I'm not done yet!

284
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,791
[GOTEN] Knock it off. That's
mean! I'm already soaked!

285
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:51,208
Those two are only
half-Saiyans,

286
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:52,833
and hardly out of
their training pants.

287
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:55,666
And the older one doesn't
seem the fighting sort.

288
00:15:57,166 --> 00:16:00,000
[sighs] Once again
the trail has gone cold.

289
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,125
Where is that
Super Saiyan God hiding?

290
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,791
[VEGETA]
Sorry for the wait!

291
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,750
A pyramid of takoyaki,
Your Grace!

292
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,125
Oh, nice work.

293
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:10,458
[WHIS]
Thank you.

294
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,125
Well at least
the food here isn't cold.

295
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,666
Yes, indeed,
but my stomach is filling up

296
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,958
and I don't know
where else to look,

297
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,583
on this planet or otherwise.

298
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:19,333
Maybe I'll just go home
and take another nap.

299
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,375
[VEGETA]
Yes, that's right, you monster!

300
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:22,958
Get back to your own world!

301
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,958
--[BEERUS] So, Prince.
--[VEGETA] Yes, sir!

302
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,958
That Saiyan on
King Kai's world--

303
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,500
oh, I've already
forgotten his name.

304
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:29,625
[WHIS]
Goku, my lord.

305
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,291
Yes, that's right: Goku.

306
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:34,750
What exactly is your
relationship to that fighter?

307
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,083
He's my enemy.
But we've made a truce.

308
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:40,666
A truce, you say?
And you accept that?

309
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,875
[grunts]

310
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,833
Saiyans have changed
during my nap--

311
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,875
or at least those who survived.

312
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,333
