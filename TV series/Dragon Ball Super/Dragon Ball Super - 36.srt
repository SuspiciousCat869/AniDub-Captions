[NARRATOR] In the
Tournament of Destroyers,

25
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,720
Vegeta defeated the villainous

26
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,760
Way to take it to him!
All right!

27
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,390
[NARRATOR] The Saiyan prince
seemed ready for any foe,

28
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,430
but a sudden rule change
threatened to turn

29
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,600
the competition on its head.

30
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,770
As you can see,
the ring has been enclosed

31
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,730
in a brand new cubic barrier!

32
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,610
Since this structure
is outside the ring,

33
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,610
touching any part of it
during your match

34
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,320
will now mean automatic
victory for your opponent!

Chug, chug, chug!

[NARRATOR] Vegeta's next
opponent was Magetta,

37
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,000
a robot-like giant
from the Metalman race.

38
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,290
With his seemingly
indestructible body

39
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,290
and a host of powerful attacks,

40
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:34,920
it was clear this battle
would put Vegeta to the test.

41
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,800
Vegeta hoped
to gain an advantage

42
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,640
by going Super Saiyan.
But fighting inside

43
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,010
the cubic barrier presented
daunting new challenges.

44
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,140
Not only is it harder
to dodge Magetta's

45
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,680
fearsome lava attacks,
but another change

46
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,190
is happening in the ring--

47
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,150
a change Vegeta is only
now beginning to realize.

48
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,030
Is it too late for Vegeta
to understand the truth

49
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,990
and find a way to prevail?

50

[VEGETA panting]

[TD REF] We seem to have
reached a stalemate.

58
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,250
Contestant Vegeta
has stopped his onslaught.

59
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,540
Has he run out
of ways to attack?

60
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:56,670
[panting]
What the hell is going on?

61
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,210
Obviously, he's emitting heat

62
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,590
but I've trained
for extremes like this.

63
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:04,390
There's something else.
Why do I feel so weak?

64
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,850
[CHAMPA giggles]

65
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:12,770
Champa, my lord.
Your giggling's in poor taste.

66
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:17,610
Oh, relax!
[giggles]

67
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,110
Something's fishy.

68
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,070
My brother only laughs like that
when he's up to no good.

69
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:25,240
Like when he stole the steak I'd
been aging for two centuries

70
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,410
and replaced it
with a rubber chew toy.

71
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,460
Vegeta! You gotta
get down while you can!

72
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,750
What, why?

73
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,710
Explain, Goku. Now!

74
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,790
Vegeta is not getting
enough oxygen in there,

75
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:40,590
and near the ceiling
is the worst place to be.

76
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,510
It's because of
that new barrier.

77
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,260
 Thatand the Metalman's
physiology

78
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,430
are a dangerous combination.

79
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,260
The air inside is getting
increasingly thin.

80
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,640
So, I'm right! He doesn't
care about safety;

81
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,270
it was all just a trick!
Hey, Champa!

82
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,730
Yeah, what?

83
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,440
[BEERUS] You rigged that barrier
to suffocate my fighter!

84
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,440
That's an outrageous
accusation, Beerus.

85
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,320
I don't know what
you're talking about!

86
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,280
There is nothing
abnormal about it.

87
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,070
You've sealed off the air!

88
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:09,160
[CHAMPA] No, we haven't!
Look at the bottom edge, genius!

89
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,120
[CHAMPA] We knew
ventilation was important,

90
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,790
and as you see,
air's getting through just fine!

91
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:22,800
[breathing heavily]

92
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,130
[CHAMPA] Now is it possible
Magetta's using his combustion

93
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,470
and lava to exceed
the airflow capacity?

94
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,970
Perhaps. But we
can't account for

95
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,850
every tactic a fighter takes.

96
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,640
If you had a problem
with the barrier,

97
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,940
you shouldn't have
approved it at the start.

You gotta get to the floor!

100
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:42,020
At least you'll have a better
chance of breathing there!

101
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,690

102
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,990
I won't let you
tell me how to fight!

103
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,780
I know what I need to do!

104
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,530
I will not be grounded!

105
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,370
If my oxygen's running out,
that just means

106
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,870
I need to deal
with this quickly!

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,880
Even talking makes me
light headed.

Come on! Why's he
have to be so stubborn.

111

he's gonna pass out!

Come on, Dad, you got this!

I'm gonna pass out first!

[sighs] Like I just
demonstrated with Bulma,

117
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,190
a fighter's gotta be
fast on his feet.

set off some kind of bomb.

Checking now! Nope!

That's a
naturally-produced attack,

142
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,640
and therefore
technically not a weapon!

143

I've never seen anybody

319
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,550
There's no escaping me now!

320
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,140
[grunts]

321
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:56,270
You like that?

322
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:59,480
Because you're finished,
you pathetic pile of junk!

323
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,440
[MAGETTA]
Chicka-chicka-klunk-hiss.

324
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,950
[MAGETTA]
Clacket-a...

325
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,090
Ring out: Contestant Magetta!

326
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:35,970
Contenst Vegeta wins the match!

327
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:37,430
[VEGETA]
Hm!

328
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:40,520
--He did it!
--Nobody beats my dad!

329
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,150
Now we've lost Magetta, too?

330
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,650
I guess you should have
given me time

331
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:46,360
to strengthen that barrier.

332
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,690
You are so annoying!
[growls]

333
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,950
[VADOS] Cheer up.
It was a spirited battle,

334
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,700
and we're not finished yet.

335
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,870
All we can do is
focus on the next match--

336
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:00,200
though, clearly, I'll need to
make some repairs first.

337
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,290
I need some water.

338
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,840
Well done, Vegeta.
That's two now.

339
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,840
Crushing the ring was a little
bit excessive, if you ask me.

340
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,300
Don't give him a hard time--
that guy was like a tank!

341
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,380
He wasn't going down
the normal way.

342
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,050
It was far from the
easiest way you could have

343
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,850
defeated the Metalman,
but I suppose a win is a win.

344
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:18,970
Say what?

345
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,850
[MAGETTA]
Sniff, sniff, sniff.

346
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,230
[GOKU]
Whoa, is he crying?

347
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:27,020
[MAGETTA] Sniff, sniff.
Clickety, thunk!

348
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,520
Hard to believe
that's the guy who seemed

349
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:30,570
indestructible
a few minutes ago.

350
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,490
We have Vegeta's
"pile of junk" comment

351
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:34,070
to thank for that.
As you see,

352
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,660
Magetta was
rather hurt by the remark.

353
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,530
Despite their
literal thick skin,

354
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,910
the Metalman race are
extraordinarily sensitive,

355
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
and the right insult
during combat can reduce them

356
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,000
to a puddle,
rendering them helpless.

357
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,170
You knew that the whole time
and didn't say anything;

358
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:49,000
even when Vegeta
was about to lose?

359
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,170
Well, I'm glad he didn't!

360
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:51,590
Just think of
all the great fighting

361
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,050
we woulda missed out on!

362
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:55,590
[WHIS laughs]
My thought exactly.

363
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,510
I'm sure you feel
the same way, Vegeta.

364
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,010
I mean, if you just
wanted a quick win,

365
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,220
you could've
powered up at the start.

366
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,640
[VEGETA]
Hmph!

367
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:12,280
That guy in black--you're
curious about him too, right?

368
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,780
He looks like a serious threat.

369
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,880
Now it's my turn to fight.

370
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,460
[NARRATOR] Saiyans from
two universes collide,

371
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:35,340
next time on Dragon Ball Super!

372
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,310
Goodbye to our adventure

373
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,820
In twilight we must go our separate ways

374
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:57,350
And try to discover the path to our own destiny

375
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,600
I can't find the words

376
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,130
to tell you how much our parting hurts

377
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,630
I hope you know I'll always love you

378
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:07,580
And all that we shared will be remembered

379
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,890
How could I forget your face?

380
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,790
All my memories erased

381
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,870
I can still hear the melody of your voice

382
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,430
Petals fall in from above

383
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,070
Fade away, all that we love

384
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:28,580
In the twilight,

385
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:28,580
fade away,

386
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,580
fade away

387
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:34,990
Sayonara,

388
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,990
fade away,

389
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,990
fade away

390
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,540
Hey, it's me, Goku!

391
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:43,670
The Saiyans from the 6th Universe
may be a lot different than us

392
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:48,510
but they're still a warrior race, and it'd be
a bit mistake to think this fight's gonna be easy.

393
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:52,800
After all Vegeta's gone through in this
tournament, I'm worried where his head's at.

394
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,600
Could the old, evil Vegeta make a comeback?!

395
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,060
Next time on Dragon Ball Super:

396
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,320
Make sure you don't miss it, okay?
