Are you done now?

It really irks me when a
creature lacks basic manners.

334
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:40,166
Now then. What was
I talking about?

335
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,333
You had a premonition
about some mysterious figure

you can't recall.

Oh, right. I'm this close
to remembering but I can't.

Oh, and it's such
an annoying feeling,

339
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,875
like having something
caught in your back teeth

that you just can't fish out.

341

Or a dried up bit
of earwax you can't reach

but you feel it rattling
in your head all day.

343
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,625
You know what I mean, right?
It's the worst!

344
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:03,500
So, my lord.
What about the meat?

345
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,958
Shall we try some?

00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:09,916

that tasty, after all.

You are the mightiest Saiyan.

At least for now.

I will surpass you.

I'll keep pushing.

Others might see this
explosion as something foul.

But in my eyes, there is
nothing more beautiful

than a shattering planet.

Are you sure that was wise?

What if that meat
could have helped you?

[BEERUS]
Hm. It's no longer required.

Oh? Is that so?

386
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,750
[BEERUS] Yes. I planned
for the punch of flavor

387
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:01,625
to jog my sleepy mind, but it's
this full-bodied explosion

388
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:04,500
that's done the trick.
Now I see him clearly--

389
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:07,166
the ultimate fighter,
waiting to be awoken.

390

His power will keep me
suitably entertained.

391
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,166
Now the image has a name.

392
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,000
Then by all means,
let's hear it.

00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:28,833
Yes. A Super Saiyan God.

A Super Saiyan God?

I think.

Or is that wrong and
now I'm forgetting again.

They're too slippery.

wouldn't strain your mind

go back and get you fed?
