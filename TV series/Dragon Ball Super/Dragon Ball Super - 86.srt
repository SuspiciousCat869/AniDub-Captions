of the Eleventh Universe

convened his counterparts
from across the cosmos

35

As I was saying. We should
approach Grand Zeno

reconsider this contest.

made up his mind!

I doubt it'll work.
And if we upset him,

42
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,916
it's entirely possible
that he'll simply do away

right there on the spot.

I had hoped to forge a
mutually beneficial agreement

49
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,416
so that all eight
universes might survive,

only one will be spared.

And while it gives me
no pleasure to say this,

it's clear that
my Eleventh Universe

53
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,250
will be the lone survivor.

Man, that Minotauros

They used to be among the more

But poaching has
altered their behavior.

It's made them
aggressive toward man.

Hm. Life is funny.

After Doctor Gero ordered us

Aaah!

312
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:09,958
[sniffing]

313
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:12,583
What a scrumptious spread!

314
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:21,708
[BEERUS]
Aah! That hit the spot.

315
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,958
And with that,
it's time for a nap.

316
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,291
Wake me in an hour.

317
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,375
And get me one more bucket
of those potstickers.

318
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:30,291
All these naps are a vice,
my lord, and so is gluttony--

319
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,250
can you please choose
one or the other?

320
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:35,333
[BEERUS] Hm! Our universe
may be destroyed in mere days,

321
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,458
so I'll do whatever I want.

322
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:41,166
[snoring]

323
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,208
Why do I even bother?

324
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:44,750
[GOKU]
So there you have it.

325
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,125
[A17]
Hm. A tournament of power.

326
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,125
That's quite a story, Goku.

327
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,125
Yeah, but it's all true!

328
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:53,291
So, you're asking me
to leave my responsibilities

329
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,333
down here to fight
in this tournament?

330
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:56,541
[GOKU]
Yep! You in?

331
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:57,750
I'm not.

332
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:00,250
What? 17! Each member
of the winning team

333
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,041
gets ten million zeni!

334
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,208
[A17] When it comes
to money, I'm fine.

335
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:05,333
[GOKU gasps]

336
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,333
[A17]
This job pays surprisingly well.

337
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:08,833
The tournament won't
take you that long,

338
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,625
and you'll still
have this job, too.

339
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:15,500
[A17] Look, it's not about
the job. It's about the island.

340
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,291
I can't afford to leave it.

341
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,333
[GOKU] Hey, when I say the
tournament won't take long,

342
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,500
I mean, like, two hours tops!

343
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,791
[A17] Two hours is more than
enough time for those poachers

344
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:26,541
to come back
and ravage this place.

345
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,750
If this island needs some
protection, I can just have

346
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,750
Trunks and Goten come over
and watch the place

347
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:31,958
while we're gone.

348
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,625
[A17] Trunks, I remember.
Who's Goten?

349
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:38,666
[GOKU] My son! He can rough up
any poachers, no problem.

350
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,625
[A17] This takes
more than just strength.

351
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:43,291
Sorry, Goku. You need
to find someone else.

352
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,791
[GOKU] Huh?
Hey! Don't do this to me!

353
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:49,416
Everyone's fate depends
on this tournament!

354
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,500
Wait, what?

355
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:53,583
What?! Oh, nevermind.
[chuckles]

356
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,791
[A17] All right, what are
you keeping from me?

357
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,208
[GOKU] There's nothing.
I toldya everything.

358
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,875
It's obvious. You'd never
come all the way out here

359
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:07,250
to recruit me for just
a martial arts exhibition.

360
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:10,291
Well, that ain't
nececssarily true!

361
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,541
I want the full story, Goku.

362
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:15,375
Uh. Gohan made me
promise not to tell

363
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:18,208
any of the recruits, but...

364
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,916
...here's the truth.

365
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,250
[GOKU]
If we lose the tournament,

366
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,833
our universe will be destroyed.

367
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:38,416
[GOKU]
I assume you don't want that.

368
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,791
Fight with us and at least
we've got a chance.

369
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:44,500
The guys on the other universes'
teams are all super strong!

370
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,583
[A17]
If we're doomed, so be it.

371
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,208
[GOKU gasps]

372
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,916
[A17] Obliteration for all.
Not just the helpless.

373
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,166
That's a fate I can accept.

374
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,708
[GOKU]
Uh.

375
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:02,958
[A17] Bye, Goku.
I hope you fight bravely.

376
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:16,333
[ALIEN POACHER 86A] Boss! We've
finally reached Earth!

377
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,958
Scans of the southern island
indicate a concentration

378
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:22,125
of lifeforms, including
the fabled "Minotauros"!

379
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:25,541
[ALIEN POACHER BOSS laughing]

380
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,250
All right. Good!

381
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:31,416
What are we waiting for?
Let's start poaching!

382
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,250
[ALIEN POACHERS]
Yeah!

383
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:42,333
[NARRATOR] Only 31 hours
and 40 minutes remain

384
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:45,041
until the start of the
Tournament of Power!

385
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,458
But Android 17 opting out

386
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:50,333
is throwing a serious
wrench in the plans.

387
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:52,500
What's your next move, Goku?

388
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:57,125
The countdown continues,
next time on Dragon Ball Super!

389
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:59,208
<i>Boogie Back!</i>

390
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:10,375
<i>Wish we had better timing</i>

391
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:14,208
<i>To explore this attraction</i>

392
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,583
<i>Put on a smile, it's showtime</i>

393
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:21,250
<i>And I'm just playing a part</i>

394
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:25,291
<i>Let's get lost in the rhythm,</i>
<i>dancing dancing heart</i>

395
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:28,416
<i>Head over heels</i>
<i>I'm falling falling down</i>

396
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,500
<i>(Boogie Back!)</i>

397
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:32,125
<i>My heartbeat</i>
<i>keeps growing faster</i>

398
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:35,875
<i>Every step that I take</i>
<i>brings me back to you</i>

399
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:36,875
<i>(Boogie Back!)</i>

400
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:39,541
<i>Give me happy ever after</i>

401
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:44,375
<i>Let the dream</i>
<i>of our love come true</i>

402
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:46,250
<i>Boogie Back!</i>

403
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:48,041
<i>Boogie Back!</i>

404
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:53,708
<i>Boogie Back!</i>

405
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:55,625
<i>Boogie Back!</i>

406
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,000
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

407
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:04,000
Look! An alien
spaceship is stealing

408
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:06,916
all the island's animals,
including the Minotauros!

409
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,083
C'mon, 17, let's form
a different kind of team--

410
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:13,000
a ranger team--
and save those animals!

411
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:15,291
We'll chase the poachers
to the ends of the universe,

412
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:18,416
if that's what it takes
to get back the Minotauros!

413
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,791
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

414
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:22,208
"Hunt the Poaching Ring!

415
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:25,000
Goku and Android 17's
Joint Struggle!"

416
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:27,000
Make sure you don't
miss it, okay?
