00:22:17,452 --> 00:22:20,997
<i>A spark of possibility</i>

325
00:22:21,081 --> 00:22:24,834
<i>Shines softly like a star</i>
<i>in the night sky</i>

326
00:22:24,918 --> 00:22:29,923
<i>A wish from long</i>
<i>ago now shoots by</i>

327
00:22:30,006 --> 00:22:32,217
<i>And I'm awakened</i>

328
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,970
<i>A never-ending melody,</i>
<i>so enchanting</i>

329
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:39,724
<i>You're always the one</i>
<i>who makes me tremble</i>

330
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:44,020
<i>The meteors keep falling down</i>

331
00:22:44,104 --> 00:22:47,315
<i>Surging right into my heart</i>

332
00:22:51,361 --> 00:22:52,862
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

333
00:22:52,946 --> 00:22:55,740
And Jiren, I always hoped
it would end this way.

334
00:22:55,824 --> 00:22:58,618
As a one-on-one showdown
between you and me.

335
00:22:58,702 --> 00:23:00,161
Let's give it all we've got

336
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:02,914
and keep pushing our limits,
harder than ever before!

337
00:23:02,997 --> 00:23:06,209
With overwhelming speed
and unbelievable power!

338
00:23:06,292 --> 00:23:09,379
This is the end, Jiren.
Here I come.

339
00:23:09,462 --> 00:23:11,631
Next time, on Dragon Ball Super:

340
00:23:11,715 --> 00:23:13,425
"A Transcendent Limit Break!

341
00:23:13,508 --> 00:23:15,677
Autonomous Ultra
Instinct Mastered!"

342
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,679
Make sure you don't
miss it, okay?
