1
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,740
Don't you wanna dream again?

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,920
Now it's calling for me go back to the start

3
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,910
Wishing on the starlight

4
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,770
In the sky, let's paint a door for tomorrow

5
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,550
Just step on the new stage don't be shy

6
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,510
Gonna take the challenge of God

7
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,680
Kyo-Let's☆Mo-Let's☆Dynamic!

8
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,240
Let's! Go! Go! Big panic

9
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:50,990
I don't care 'bout limits, no regret

10
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:56,540
Make me tougher even though I lose

11
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,440
Nothing gonna stop me no mo' try me

12
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,750
So-Zets☆Cho-Zets☆Dynamic!

13
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,400
Let's Go! Yes! Give a kick!

14
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:10,780
Keep on going power pumpin' up

15
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:14,740
something greater waiting not so far away

16
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,980
[NARRATOR] Previously,
on Dragon Ball Super!

17
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:33,910
Cabba the Saiyan contestant
from the Sixth Universe

18
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,250
challenged Vegeta!

19
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,320
But unlike Vegeta and Goku,

20
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,720
he lacked the ability to
transform into a Super Saiyan!

21
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,050
Teach me.

22
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,520
Teach me how to
transform like you do.

23
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,890
[VEGETA]
It's shameful.

24
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,190
Yet you dare...

25
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:53,600
...call yourself a Saiyan!

26
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,270
[NARRATOR] Cabba's weakness
infuriated Vegeta,

27
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,770
and the Saiyan prince
viciously attacked him,

28
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,340
until it awoke the
rage within him.

29
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:08,880
[CABBA]
I will... make you pay!

30
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,050
The best trigger for the Super
Saiyan transformation is anger.

31
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,950
So hold on to that
feeling you just had.

32
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,360
Right.

33
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:20,060
[NARRATOR] Vegeta's rage
was merely tough-love

34
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,790
in order to train
his fellow Saiyan.

35
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,800
[CABBA groans]

36
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:29,600
Making Vegeta the winner!

37
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,310
[NARRATOR] Frost, Magetta,
Cabba, all defeated!

38
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:38,410
Vegeta fights his
next opponent now!

39
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,270
[VEGETA]
So he's my next opponent.

40
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,470
[VEGETA] This guy seems
so calm, it's eerie.

41
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,980
I know hidden deep behind
that face is pure aggression.

42
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,810
He's strong. I can
sense his energy.

43
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,550
It's honed as sharp as a knife.

44
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,150
[chuckles]

45
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,920
[VEGETA] But no matter
how prepared he is,

46
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,590
it won't be enough to beat me.

47
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,520
[BEERUS]
Hm...

48
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,160
So his name is "Hit."
Is that right, Whis?

49
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,760
I know he's from
another universe,

50
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,930
but he seems familiar.

51
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,000
What's his deal?

52
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,300
From what I've been
able to glean,

53
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,200
he's a professional assassin.

54
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,630
In fact, he's the
most talented one

55
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,340
in the entire Sixth Universe.

56
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,970
Stories of his exploits claim
that not a single target

57
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,470
has ever escaped his reach.

58
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,980
They call him, "Never Miss Hit."

59
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,180
[GOKU]
Whoa!

60
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,810
If he's even half that good,
I'm impressed!

61
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,550
Well.

62
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,050
For the sake of winning my bet,

63
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,990
I need Vegeta to
come out on top.

64
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,520
But speaking purely as
a fan of a good fight,

65
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,020
I'm excited to see
these two in action.

66
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,030
Hm.

67
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,800
Wait, what? What's happening?

68
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,640
And begin!

69
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,880
[yells]

70
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,680
[whimpers]

71
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,700
Ha!

72
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:40,700
Wouldn't use that narrow
stance if I were you.

73
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,330
[growls]

74
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:15,700
See that?

75
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,270
Oh, yeah. His guard's perfect.

76
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,710
[chuckles]

77
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,810
This guy knows how to
handle himself in a fight.

78
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,460
[growls]

79
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:41,090
[VEGETA] That guard doesn't make
it easy for me to attack.

80
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:44,660
But I'm not going to stand
here all day, either.

81
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:48,470
He's fast! But it's nothing
I haven't seen before!

82
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,100
[yells]

83
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,600
[groaning]

84
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,310
What the--?

85
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,240
Holy crap!

86
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,340
That speed.

87
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:57,070
Uh-oh.

88
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,280
I second that, my lord.

89
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,380
[CHAMPA chuckles]

90
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,990
So far, so good.

91
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,090
Hit is quite impressive.

92
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,190
[growls]

93
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,090
[VEGETA]
I didn't even see him hit me.

94
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,760
Just like that,
I was on the ground.

95
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,330
Give up, now.

96
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,970
[VEGETA]
Yeah, right.

97
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,170
You're pretty cocky for someone
who's landed a single blow.

98
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:31,610
Agh! I'm gonna end
this fight now!

99
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,510

101
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,550
[VEGETA]
How'd he do that?!

102
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,290
[VEGETA]
He keeps blinking out of sight

103
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,660
right before he strikes.

104
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,200
Hey, Piccolo. Are you
seeing Hit's attacks?

105
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,130
No. Nothing.

106
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,010
[VEGETA]
What the hell is going on?

107
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,080
Is he cheating too?

108
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,920
[VEGETA] All I have to do is
strike just before he moves

109
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:22,360
and then his speed won't matter.

110
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,630
This fight is mine.

111
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:39,180
[VEGETA] I can't believe how
many hits he got on me!

112
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:43,580
[VEGETA groaning]

113
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,860
[VEGETA] Damn. I'm no match
for him if he keeps this pace!

You dare mock me?!

118
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,090
[VEGETA]
He struck from way over there?

119
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,360
And without preparation?

120
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,390
--[GOTEN] Whoa!!
--C'mon, Dad!

121
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,930
Vegeta, what's going on?

122
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,900
I don't see him moving;
you're just flying around!

00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,310
[VEGETA groaning]

124
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,840
You only have one option left.

125
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,340
Surrender.

126
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:49,280
No! I will not!

127
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,350
[GOKU] Jaco, are you able
to see any of Hit's attacks?

128
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,850
Not a one.

129
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,850
I thought you had really good
eyes for this kinda thing.

130
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,250
Well, not here.

131
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,620
Look at that.

132
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:01,090
He's hitting his vital spots
with pin-point strikes.

133
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,830
He's certainly living up to
his "Never Miss Hit" nickname

134
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,200
and being the Sixth Universe's
top competitor.

135

[BEERUS] Once again,
they take the advantage

136
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,930
with a secret skill.

00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,050
[VEGETA]
I can't believe it.

142
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,490
How could I,
at Super Saiyan Blue,

143
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,920
not even lay a finger on him!

144
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,040
[VEGETA] Not being able
to see his attacks coming

145
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,840
has got me off balance.

146
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,150
But even after all
the blows he's landed,

147
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,820
the fact is, I'm still standing.

148
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:02,390
That tells me that while Hit's
got speed, he lacks strength.

your strategy yet?

Well then, what do we do now?

165
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,810
He can't very well announce
his surrender to me

166
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,440
if he's knocked out.

167
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,940
[TD REF]
Uh... Mm...

168
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,310
Okay.

169
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:50,150
The winner, by knockout,

170
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:54,120
Contestant Hit!

171
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,220
Of all the people I've fought

172
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,190
who've taken that
many of my attacks,

173
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:59,490
you are the only one to live.

174

[CHAMPA laughing]

00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,170
[growls]

176
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,400
No. Vegeta lost.

177
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,910
Oh no!

178
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,140
[TRUNKS]
Dad!

179
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,850
Uh. Wait, Trunks!
I'm coming to help, too!

180
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,050
Krillin, hurry.

181
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,380
Go down there and give
Vegeta a Senzu Bean.

182
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,320
Yeah. On it.

183
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,490
After watching that,

184
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,430
I can tell you Hit's
moving at super speed,

185
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,830
and that's what's making
him so hard to beat.

186
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:39,770
Well, yeah, we've all noticed
that so far. C'mon, Jaco.

187
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:43,100
Yes, but have you noticed
what happens when he attacks?

188
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,770
It's more than just speed.

189
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,880
What? I'm not exactly sure
what you're telling me.

190
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,440
[JACO] In the middle of his
attack, he disappears.

191
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,750
Completely.

192
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,410
A fast, invisible man?

193
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,880
No, if that were it,
we'd see his clothes!

194
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,620
Oh. That's right.

195
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,350
So then maybe it's more like

196
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,120
when I use my Instant
Transmission?

197
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,060
Although doing it with
that kind of precision

198
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:06,890
is on a whole other level.

199
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:07,860
[JACO]
Hmm...

200
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,430
--[thud]
--[VEGETA] Damn it!

201
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:14,470
What a waste of time!

202
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,700
Here's an idea.

203
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,900
What if he's actually
time skipping?

204
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,370
What does that mean?

205
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:20,910
Yes! That is it!

206
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,380
Huh? I'm with Bulma.
What is that?

207
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,880
Granted, I've only heard rumors

208
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,580
of the ability to
manipulate time,

209
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,150
but apparently,
there are a few beings

210
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,280
out in the various universes
who can perform this "skip."

211
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,220
And I'm not talking about
much time, mind you,

212
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:35,250
only around a tenth of a second.

213
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,660
I don't understand anything
of what you're saying at all!

214
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,760
What he's saying is that there
are some people out there

215
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,760
who can jump ahead
in time just a tiny bit

216
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,100
and get the drop
on someone else.

217
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:44,300
Yeah, but how's
that enough time

218
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,000
to gain the advantage
in a fight?

219
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:48,300
True, a tenth of a second
doesn't sound like much,

220
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,270
but when combined with
superhuman speed,

221
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,840
like the kind Hit has,

222
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:54,070
that's plenty long enough for
him to surprise his opponent.

223
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,580
Hold on, Jaco!

224
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,580
Didn't you make a big stink
during the last Frieza thing

225
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:00,180
about how messing with time
is against Galactic Law?

226
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,650
Wait, is that true, Jaco?

227
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,650
I know what you're getting at,
and I don't like it!

228
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:06,190
Well good. Then go over
there and arrest him!

229
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,690
No way. We're out
of my jurisdiction.

230
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,020
And you call yourself
an elite patrolman?!

231
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:14,130
Yes, and since I'm super-elite,
my life is super important.

232
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,500
I'm also gonna sit out
this time travel issue.

233
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,670
[BULMA] Come on!
What is wrong with you guys?!

234
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,100
Yeah, I actually don't
want Hit arrested, either.

235
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,670
How'm I gonna fight him
if he's being booked

236
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,140
for some sort of time crime?

237
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:28,670
Argh! You are all so worthless!

238
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:31,440
[WHIS] Hit is even more
impressive than his reputation.

239
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,010
And I didn't expect
this tournament

240
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:35,680
to feature someone else who
is able to manipulate time.

241
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,780
[BEERUS grumbles]

242
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,820
Hit's gonna be a big
problem for us.

243
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,890
[laughing]

244
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,490
[growling]

245
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,290
Although, it seems like
Goku's plotting something.

246
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,760
[GOKU]
Hmm...

247
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,960
[TD REF]
All right, fans!

248
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,330
For our next match,

249
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,470
Contestant Hit will face off
against an old favorite

250
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,400
from the Seventh Universe:

251
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,940
Goku!

252
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:01,170
He's back in the tournament!

253
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:06,410
Well, how do you guys
think I should handle this?

254
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,350
By praying.

255
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,150
Oh, and to make it a good one.

256
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,180
That doesn't exactly help.

257
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,930
Oh, wait!

258
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:26,200
Got any tips for fighting
this guy, Vegeta?

259
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:29,240
How's this? Don't lose.

260
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,370
[GOKU]
What?

261
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:33,240
Vegeta, c'mon!
That's not good advice!

262
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,810
Yeah, you're on your own.

263
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,780
[GOKU] That's pretty cold, dude!
We are on the same team, y'know!

264
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:41,610
[VEGETA]
Hmph. As if I care about that.

265
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,920
[GOKU]
Uh. Ha.

266
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,450
I got myself into a real
pickle with this match.

267
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,790
You're the time expert.

268
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,720
If you have ideas for
how Goku can win this,

269
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,260
now would be the time
to go down and tell him.

270
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,630
An essential part of any
great fighter's training

271
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,900
is that he finds the
solution for himself.

272
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:59,300
But this isn't training,
this is a tournament!

273
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:00,970
Why don't we just
trust that Goku

274
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,940
will figure this out on his own?

275
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,570
How can you be so casual
after that Vegeta loss?

276
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:06,870
If Goku loses, too, then--

277
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,410
Well, we still have
the strongest man

278
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,880
in the Seventh Universe.

279
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,110
I know he's small,

280
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,050
but I hope you haven't
forgotten about Monaka.

281
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,410
All right.

282
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:17,050
You're only acting this way
to spite me, aren't you?

283
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,220
Oh-ho, I can't deny it, my lord!

284
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,390
I am still a little miffed
that you told a lie

285
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,720
to motivate Vegeta and Goku,

286
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,560
and that you filled out
our tournament roster

287
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:27,590
by bringing in such an
egregiously unhelpful amateur.

291

[PICCOLO]
So that's the explanation.

292
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,870
[PICCOLO]
It's up to you, Goku.

293
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,080
[GOKU]
Hm.

294
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,210
[HIT]
Huh?

295
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,550
Begin!

296
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,420
All right, Hit. Let's get
started! Best of luck!

297
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:00,330
So you're not going to
start already transformed?

298
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,360
[GOKU]
Huh?

299
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,260
Oh, doing that uses
a lot of power,

300
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,200
so I always keep it in my back
pocket for later in the fight.

301
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,700
Besides, I still
haven't figured out

302
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,470
a winning strategy
against you yet,

303
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,010
so don't get mad if all I do
right now is stall for time.

304
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:17,210
You showing your cards
tells me... that you're young.

[GOKU chuckles]

306
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,880
Well, I appreciate
the compliment,

307
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,380
because I'm actually
a grandfather!

308
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:25,180
That's young to a man
who's a thousand years old.

310
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:29,160
A thousand years old?
Whoa, for real?

You really are my senior,
and then some!

our fight, sir.

I definitely didn't
see that one coming,

320

and your attacks are really
hard for an old guy.

All right. Attack Plan B!

[GOKU panting]

325
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:46,700
Ow! That really hurt!

326
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:49,640
Try all you like, it won't work.

327
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,270
And it doesn't matter how
tough you are, either.

328
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,470
If I keep striking
your critical points,

329
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,280
you will eventually die.

330
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:58,580
I recommend you surrender.

331
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:00,110
[chuckles]

332
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:02,950
Now why would I
surrender, old man?

333
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,550
After all, I just got my
first hint of the secret

334
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,150
to beating you!

335
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,960
Oh? A hint?

336
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,260
Yeah. A hint.

337
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,230
I think you're bluffing.

338
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,160
All right.

339
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,470
Then why don't you
call me on it?

340
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,310
Try.

341
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:36,050
[yelling]

342
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,320
[HIT]
Hm?

343
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,920
[GOKU chuckles]

344
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,420
Well, well. How 'bout that?

345
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:48,330
I just beat your
time-skipping attack.

346
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:54,100
[GOKU]
Try to dodge me now!

[GOKU yelping]

349
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:09,480
I did it! I just hit
you in the face!

350
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,120
Lucky shot.

351

00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:22,190
So... let's see if you're right.

355
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:25,500
[yelling]

356
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,470
Still lucky?

357
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,470
What?

358
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,210
[chuckles]

359
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,510
That was amazing!
How did Goku do that?

360
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,040
Oh, wow.

361
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,050
Now it looks like Hit's the one
who can't keep up with Goku!

362
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,650
Yeah, I know!

363
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,550
Oh no! C'mon, Hit!

364
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,020
[BEERUS gasps]

365

[growls]

367
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:53,690
Your whole advantage

368
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,530
is moving a tenth of a
second forward in time

369
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,160
for a surprise shot.

370
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,330
So then I just anticipated,

371
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,900
guessing where your
moves will take you

372
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,540
after you start
your attack,

373
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,800
based on watching
your fighting style.

374
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:08,310
A new phase of the fight begins.

375
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,920
[GOKU chuckles]

376
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,130
You're finally taking this
thing seriously, aren't ya?

377
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,660
Then, I'll be doing
the same, Hit!

378
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,170
Now I'm going all out!

379
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,300
Whoa–oa

380
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:49,660

00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:49,660
Whoa–oa

382
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:52,790
It's hard to say - don't wanna stay

383
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,300
I twist and fight, can't find my way

384
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:59,000
I must believe, that fear and trouble

385
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:02,500
can even be fun if you think the right way

386
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,990
Whoa–oa

387
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,140
Whoa–oa

388
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,140
Whoa

389
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:12,500
I don't wanna draw the line, I gotta see it through some way

390
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:16,000
Fight for what I know is mine, the dream I had of me that day

391
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,130
Whoa–o-oa

Don't care if they call me greedy,

395
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,800
If they ever make it make it through,

396
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:27,240
Don't care if they laugh at me,

397
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,100
cus' I will make the dream come true

398
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:32,090
Whoa–oa

399
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:36,000

Whoa–oa–oa

401
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,870
Hey, it's me, Goku!

402
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:42,090
Well, I may have cracked Hit's Time-Skipping

403
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:45,800
but the strongest warrior in the 6th Universe
won't go down without a fight.

404
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,470
When this guy cranks it to 11,
he's even better than I imagined!

405
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,930
So, once again, I'm gonna have to scramble.

406
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:55,310
Thankfully, I've got a secret move
that I've been hiding from everyone!

407
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,680
Next time on Dragon Ball Super:

408
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,230
Trust me, you don't want to...skip...this one.
