the Tournament of Power
is almost here!

00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:58,125
Eight universes will fight!

The losers will be destroyed!

Goku has begun to assemble
a team of ten contestants,

00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,875

Krillin and Number 18.

[GOHAN]
Not so fast, guys.

32
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:09,541

But first, Gohan wanted

33
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:11,541
to test Krillin's strength.

I call that one the
Hundred Times Solar Flare.

Let's push each other
and get better together.

38
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,791
With a little creativity,
and a lotta hard work,

39
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:36,000
we can make all our moves
a hundred times stronger,

40
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:38,583
and win the Tournament of Power.

That's a good point.
I really do lack experience.

00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:47,333
Oh no, I almost forgot!
Hey, Number 18?

43
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:50,625
Do you know where
I can find Number 17?

You're kidding me, aren't you?

45
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,250
Dende keeps an eye
on the whole planet.

46
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,958
I bet he knows where
to find Android 17.

Oh, yeah, I forgot about Dende.

All right, Dad.

00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,666
I'm gonna head off
and talk to Piccolo now.

53
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,583
Oh, yeah, good thinkin'.
That shouldn't be too hard.

54
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,583
Knowing Piccolo, he'll agree
to enter the tournament

55
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,750
before you can even
finish asking him.

56
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,958
Of course. He is a martial
artist at heart, after all.

00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,708
I'm sure he can't resist
the chance to fight

the strongest warriors
in the cosmos.

Honestly, I gotta say
I kinda feel the same way.

60
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,708
Well, tell him
I said "hi," okay.

61
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:42,333
Will do. I'll see ya later, Dad.

62
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,583
All right then.
I'd better pick up the pace

63
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,416
and get to the Lookout.

64
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,791

amped up, isn't he?

I humbly request that
you keep this proposal

73
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:52,375
by Grand Zeno a secret from the
inhabitants of your universes.

Yes, that's fine by me.

00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:59,958
But hold on. At the moment,
we appear to be missing

00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,166
the Supreme Kai
of the Seventh Universe.

78
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,500
That's because I chose
not to invite him.

79
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:07,166
This whole Tournament of Power
nonsense was suggested

80
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,041
by one of his subjects,
after all.

Enough! Get to the point!

a futile quorum like this

discuss our present situation.

And like I just said,

86
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,291

so why should we bother?

concerned about?

This sounds like fun to me!

94
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,083
A bare-knuckle brawl!

95
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:44,791
And that's something the Second
Universe can win easily!

to my brawny colleague

00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,750
from the Second Universe,

99
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,916
perhaps you are
unaware of the superior

of the Third Universe?

Now, now.

How rude! I think I'm insulted!

What a war of words.

115
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,916
How dreadfully unseemly.

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,625
As I was saying...

117
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,625
We should approach Grand Zeno

118
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:36,666
and ask him to
reconsider this contest.

119
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,041
I propose that with one voice,
we Supreme Kais request

120
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,791
each of our universes
be granted a short reprieve

121
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:45,333
from this annihilation,
and in that time,

122
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,666
we shall achieve
the mortal level of seven

123
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,750
the Grand Zeno desires.

124
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,166
Is this the ludicrous scheme

125
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,000
that you called us
here to discuss?

126
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,000
What good will begging do us?

127
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,875
The Omni-King has already
made up his mind!

128
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:00,708
I doubt it'll work.
And if we upset him,

129
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,958
it's entirely possible
that he'll simply do away

130
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:05,458
with all of us
right there on the spot.

131
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:08,625
Now, I, too, am quite busy,
so if that's all.

132
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,791
What to do? What to do?

133
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,916
Hwah. Just what to do?

134
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,125
Sadly, I must agree.

135
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:22,416
Then they leave me
little choice.

136
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,916
I had hoped to forge a mutually
beneficial agreement

137
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,250
so that all eight
universes might survive,

138
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:31,916
but if they won't help,
only one will be spared.

139
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:37,291
[CAE] And while it gives me
no pleasure to say this,

140
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,041
it's clear that
my Eleventh Universe

141
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,291
will be the lone survivor.

142
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:42,875
After all, we do have

143
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,750
the strongest warriors
in the cosmos.

144

Oh, hey there, Goku!

This Tournament of Power,
it sounds like a nightmare.

The end of the whole

is not something
to take lightly.

Hm. I agree. Which is why
we'll need the missing member

of the Pride Troopers.
I believe that he is

off training on
another planet right now.

Mm. We have no choice
but to interrupt his training.

So what brought you here, Goku?

381
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,000
I'm guessing it has
something to do with

00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,166
Well, Supreme Kai and
the Destroyer stopped by here

385
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,958
earlier and I may have
overheard a few things.

leave the job of

no, begging you

to pretend, sir.

you like to begin our search?

know what's goin' on,

please tell me where 17 is?

Sure. I've kept tabs
on him for some time.

417
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,916
He lives on a large island
in the south.

418
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,583
Do you want me
to show you the way?

That'd be awesome, thanks!
