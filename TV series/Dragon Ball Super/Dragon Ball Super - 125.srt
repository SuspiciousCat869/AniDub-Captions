Look at you there, crumpled,

And trash should be tossed,
as should fragile justice.

If they try to punch him,

they'll probably end
up like that rock.

I'll never win this way.

But what other choice do I have?

You'll find no sanctuary.

you're fit to play god?

Well I'll destroy the Destroyer!

You'll make a fine

You think you can
stand against me

the terrible power
of a Destroyer God

has awoken within Top.

has found an answer.

Even with his unlimited energy,

00:21:35,618 --> 00:21:38,455
does this android have
any chance of beating

Now that Top's unleashed

And I guess the challenge
of fighting a new Destroyer

is too tempting for my
