320
00:18:28,181 --> 00:18:30,392
We are all depending on you!

321
00:18:30,475 --> 00:18:32,811
Ah. Hold it right there.

322
00:18:32,894 --> 00:18:34,979
I don't care if you've
discovered my true form,

323
00:18:35,063 --> 00:18:37,440
you will never stop me!

324
00:18:44,364 --> 00:18:47,701
He's effectively too small to
see, especially at long range.

325
00:18:47,784 --> 00:18:49,035
It won't be easy.

326
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:50,870
[ROSHI]
They also have to be careful.

327
00:18:50,954 --> 00:18:53,832
If they squash him,
they'll be disqualified.

328
00:18:53,915 --> 00:18:58,169
Ha, ha! Just keep on trying,
it won't work!

329
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:03,883
[GOKU]
Ha!

330
00:19:05,176 --> 00:19:07,512
Damn it! I can't hit him!

331
00:19:07,595 --> 00:19:10,265
I know where he is by his
energy, but he's so small

332
00:19:10,348 --> 00:19:12,851
and zips around so fast,
it doesn't matter.

333
00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:15,311
This insect doesn't seem
to have wings, though.

334
00:19:15,395 --> 00:19:18,189
Have you noticed he always jumps
at the start of every attack?

335
00:19:18,273 --> 00:19:21,401
Yeah. You're right, he hasn't
flown this whole time.

336
00:19:21,484 --> 00:19:22,819
Well that's something.

337
00:19:22,902 --> 00:19:26,614
If we can make it so he can't
jump, he won't get away.

338
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:29,034
Then if we aim for the
center of his energy,

339
00:19:29,117 --> 00:19:30,910
it could create an opportunity.

340
00:19:30,994 --> 00:19:35,081
Oh, awesome! This should knock
the little guy off his feet!

341
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:38,585
[DAMOM gasping]

342
00:19:38,668 --> 00:19:39,836
[DAMOM screams]

343
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,047
All right, round two!

344
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:43,798
[DAMOM screaming]

345
00:19:45,342 --> 00:19:48,887
Now try to jump off of this!

346
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:53,433
[DAMOM yelling]
Stop it! No fair!

347
00:19:53,516 --> 00:19:56,353
[DAMOM gasping]

348
00:19:57,103 --> 00:20:01,191
[DAMOM]
Wait. What is this?

349
00:20:01,274 --> 00:20:03,193
Yeah, you got him, 17.

350
00:20:03,276 --> 00:20:04,110
I know.

351
00:20:04,194 --> 00:20:05,403
[ALL laughing]

352
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:07,280
Hey, it looks like
they caught him!

353
00:20:07,364 --> 00:20:11,534
Hang on! Let's talk
about this! Don't do it!

354
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:13,995
[DAMOM screaming]

355
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:21,044
[DAMOM grunts]
Sorry, my lord.

356
00:20:21,127 --> 00:20:22,796
You think "sorry"
is gonna make up

357
00:20:22,879 --> 00:20:25,965
for our universe disappearing?

358
00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:27,634
Come here, you little...!

359
00:20:27,717 --> 00:20:29,719
[FUTURE ZENO gasping]

360
00:20:29,803 --> 00:20:32,389
[FUTURE ZENO]
Boop! Damom is bye-bye!

361
00:20:36,184 --> 00:20:38,645
[ZENO] All their pictures
are blacked out!

362
00:20:38,728 --> 00:20:40,647
[FUTURE ZENO]
Their team is blacked out too!

363
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:42,148
It looks like
the Fourth Universe

364
00:20:42,232 --> 00:20:43,900
is out of the Tournament now!

365
00:20:43,983 --> 00:20:45,610
And you know what that means!

366
00:20:45,694 --> 00:20:46,820
[BOTH laughing]

367
00:20:46,903 --> 00:20:49,322
Oh, no! Please, sires!

368
00:20:49,406 --> 00:20:52,450
I-- But I don't want to go away!

369
00:20:52,534 --> 00:20:55,370
This isn't right--
I can't be annihilated!

370
00:20:55,453 --> 00:20:58,206
It's so unfair! I'll show you!

371
00:20:58,289 --> 00:21:01,418
If I have to go,
I'll take all of you with me!

372
00:21:01,501 --> 00:21:03,586
[BOTH]
Bye-bye!

373
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,172
[QUITELA screams]

374
00:21:07,465 --> 00:21:10,844
[GRAND MINISTER] The Fourth
Universe has been obliterated.

375
00:21:10,927 --> 00:21:16,057
[NARRATOR] An invisible man,
a conjurer, and a fighting bug.

376
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:18,935
These were the extraordinary
final members of

377
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:22,564
the Fourth's team, and the
Seventh has defeated them all

378
00:21:22,647 --> 00:21:25,817
to wipe another universe
from existence.

379
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:29,571
Now, the only remaining teams
in the battle for survival

380
00:21:29,654 --> 00:21:32,282
are the Third, Seventh,
and Eleventh.

381
00:21:32,365 --> 00:21:35,076
Which group of hardened
warriors will prevail

382
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,662
and keep their Universe intact?

383
00:21:37,746 --> 00:21:40,331
The competition
continues to intensify,

384
00:21:40,415 --> 00:21:42,125
as it barrels toward the end.

385
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:44,878
Twelve minutes remain in
the Tournament of Power,

386
00:21:44,961 --> 00:21:47,589
next time on Dragon Ball Super!

387
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,884
<i>A 70 centimeter squared window</i>

388
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,855
<i>Today the sun broke</i>
<i>through the clouds</i>

389
00:22:03,938 --> 00:22:07,650
<i>The rain is fin'ly gone</i>

390
00:22:07,734 --> 00:22:10,362
<i>Gonna open up</i>
<i>the window for once</i>

391
00:22:10,445 --> 00:22:14,240
<i>No reason, just because</i>

392
00:22:14,324 --> 00:22:16,826
<i>This room has been</i>
<i>stained with the sighs</i>

393
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:19,329
<i>Of everyday regret</i>

394
00:22:19,412 --> 00:22:22,540
<i>Now it's time to clear the air</i>

395
00:22:22,624 --> 00:22:27,420
<i>Every moment was consumed</i>
<i>with my thoughts of you</i>

396
00:22:29,089 --> 00:22:34,219
<i>Knowing in my heart those dreams</i>

397
00:22:35,136 --> 00:22:41,851
<i>I've always wanted nothing more</i>

[GOHAN]
Hey, Gohan here.

400
00:22:52,445 --> 00:22:54,030
Looks like the
Third Universe squad

401
00:22:54,114 --> 00:22:55,824
is playing the ace
up their sleeve--

402
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:58,576
all three of these engineered
warriors are combining together

403
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:01,830
into some kind of mega-fighter
with unbelievable power,

404
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:04,457
and Dad, Vegeta, and I
will have to step up

405
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:05,792
if we're gonna survive!

406
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:09,212
Okay, here goes! Get ready
to see my full power!

407
00:23:09,295 --> 00:23:11,631
[GOKU] Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

408
00:23:11,715 --> 00:23:13,591
"A Perfect Survival Strategy!

409
00:23:13,675 --> 00:23:15,885
The 3rd Universe's
Menacing Assassin!"

410
00:23:15,969 --> 00:23:17,595
Make sure you
don't miss it, okay?
