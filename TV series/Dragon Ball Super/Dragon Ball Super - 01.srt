on Dragon Ball Z,

faced the most terrifying foe

nothing would remain.

a desperate final stand.

a massive Spirit Bomb,

because of Mr. Satan's plea.

And as more energy flowed in
from across the universe,

proved too powerful

161
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:32,166
Now get! Go back to your
training room.

162
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,625
I'll be there soon
to instruct you

163
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,291
in the art of the dynamite kick.

164
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:36,791
Buu told you Buu hungry!

165
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:39,583
And your mighty sensei
told you to wait in the back!

00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,333
[BUU]
Mmmm!

It's amazing!

He's not just the valiant
protector of Earth!

171
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:01,583
He's the greatest hero
in the whole universe!

[MR. SATAN chuckles]

Excuse me while I powder
my nose. And go pee.

[MR. SATAN]
I'm sorry, Buu. I'm sorry!

00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,500
Come on. Don't be mad!
You know I love ya!

176
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,833
I'll make ya lots of tasty
treats later, and then maybe

177
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,875
a nice bubble bath?
Your favorite!

178
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,458

Okay, okay.
Keep your cape on!

I'm sure there's chocolate

Videl! Give your daddy a hand!

I can't find
the chocolate! Videl!

[VIDEL]
I can't believe we found it.

185
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:38,041
Lucky you. You've wanted
that book for a while.

186
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,083
Oh yeah! This is gonna
make my research

187
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,708
a whole lot easier.

188
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:45,166
Thanks, Videl. I'm not sure
I deserve this, though.

189
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,541
What's that mean?
You've been studying like crazy!

190
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,458
I know. But you keep
buying me all these

191
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,583
incredible gifts like this.

192
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:55,166
And I feel bad 'cause
I can't buy you anything.

193
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,333
[VIDEL] There's an easy fix
for that. Just don't feel bad!

00:10:58,416 --> 00:10:59,291
Huh?

195
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,583
The best gift you can give me

196
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,625
is to keep on
studying hard, Gohan.

197
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:05,166
Then I'll have
a scholar as arm candy!

I want something sweet.

[TRUNKS]
A present?

00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,041
Yeah. My brother

and I haven't
gotten them anything.

206
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:29,125
I want to find a present
that my new sister-in-law

[LADY 1A] It's beautiful!
But I can't ask you

213
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,541
to buy me that, baby.
It's too much!

have a look at that one?

rings for babies.

[TRUNKS] No way she'd be happy
with one of these pebbles.

a magnifying glass.

out, we've gotta get creative.

At least my mom does.

[BULMA] It smells nice, but
it's wrong for my skin type.

Well maybe I should
give it to Videl.

245
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,625

too young for skin care.

better than this fancy crap,

an arm and a leg!

in there's all you need!

You go a long way
in that direction.

Then at the woods,
take a hard left!

And you'll find the springs
swirling up in the mountains!
