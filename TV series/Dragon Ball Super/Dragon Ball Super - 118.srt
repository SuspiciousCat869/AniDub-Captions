It's so clear to me,

neither of you entered this
tournament as solo Namekians,

What you say is true.

186
00:09:05,702 --> 00:09:08,288
We have used our ability
to merge many into one

187
00:09:08,371 --> 00:09:11,124
to share our energy,
wisdom, and power.

188
00:09:11,207 --> 00:09:13,126
We have fused.

189
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:16,004
After we learned our universe
could be annihilated,

190
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:18,340
many of our noble brethren
stepped forward

to give all they
had to the cause.

192
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:24,220
We became the hosts, absorbing
them within ourselves,

193
00:09:24,304 --> 00:09:26,931
and arrived with our
bodies still in flux.

194
00:09:27,015 --> 00:09:28,767
We avoided strenuous combat

195
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,770
until our fused powers
and minds could stabilize.

196
00:09:31,853 --> 00:09:34,064
We planned to use our
strength to help our team

in the second half.

198
00:09:35,732 --> 00:09:39,194
But now that we're finally ready
we're the only warriors left.

199
00:09:39,277 --> 00:09:41,988
Though we're surprised,
we will not be dismayed.

200
00:09:42,072 --> 00:09:43,698
All we can do is keep fighting

with the full might our
brethren entrusted to us.

202

Feel in my grip the resolve
of Planet Namek--

203
00:09:49,579 --> 00:09:52,374
by which we will live or die!

do all I can to keep them busy.

We've seen them regenerate.

210
00:10:14,938 --> 00:10:17,065
If all those Namekian warriors
have fused with them,

211
00:10:17,148 --> 00:10:19,150
their combined energy,
and their resilience,

212
00:10:19,234 --> 00:10:21,361
must be through the roof.

213

So we don't need to
worry about using

lethal force and
getting disqualified.

What is that thing?

319
00:15:33,423 --> 00:15:35,842
It is most likely a
gravitational singularity,

320
00:15:35,925 --> 00:15:37,677
created by taking all
of what they call

the "weight of their love"

322
00:15:39,095 --> 00:15:41,348
and concentrating it into
a single point in space.

323
00:15:41,431 --> 00:15:44,059
That's the elusive technique
not even Ribrianne

00:15:44,142 --> 00:15:46,061
and the maidens were able to do.

325
00:15:46,144 --> 00:15:47,896
Love can be all-consuming.

326
00:15:47,979 --> 00:15:51,232
It can paralyze, and torment
us with its intensity.

327
00:15:51,316 --> 00:15:54,277
Yet those who master love
can control its weight

328
00:15:54,361 --> 00:15:58,615

beautiful, cataclysmic attack!

This weight is something else!

331
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,589
It's way more intense
than Bulma's training rooms.

332
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:16,591
I can't use Instant

[RABANRA] It's too heavy
for the ring to support.

336

It's going to keep sinking,
layer by layer,

00:16:25,892 --> 00:16:28,853
until it crashes all the
way through the bottom!

[ZIRLOIN] Our love has trapped

I thought the Second

you're full of surprises.

All that power of love

but I'm starting to respect
what it can actually do.

345

So I hate to say it.

For me, there's a better
path to power.

Oh, well. I shall not complain
as long as he wins.

374
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:59,754
By continually fighting under
such extreme conditions,

375
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:02,173
he runs the risk of
getting used to it.

376
00:19:02,257 --> 00:19:05,093
And if he no longer minds
feeling trapped in a box,

it may become even harder
to crash through its walls.
