And I did my left ear--
you do your right!

[ZARBUTO gasps]

How can this be?

170
00:08:40,427 --> 00:08:42,303
Treasures turned to dust.

171
00:08:42,387 --> 00:08:44,639
There's beauty in that, as well.

172
00:08:49,853 --> 00:08:51,396
Got sloppy.

173
00:08:52,522 --> 00:08:55,483
Huh? I don't know who you are,

174
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:58,403
but if you're looking to fight,
that's fine with me.

Come on, muscles. Bring it on.

176

[CATOPESRA] Looks like you
got caught in that explosion

177
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:04,743
and injured your leg.

178
00:09:04,826 --> 00:09:07,454
I was just leveling the playing
field so you'd have a chance.

[CATOPESRA] Heh, at least
your spirit's intact.

know about Kefla's power.

Sorry to say it, Beerus!
Goku was already overreaching,

207
00:10:23,154 --> 00:10:25,699
and now his stamina's
being taxed even more.

208
00:10:25,782 --> 00:10:27,992
I don't care how good
your little pet Saiyan is,

209
00:10:28,076 --> 00:10:31,121
he doesn't stand a chance
against both of them combined!

210
00:10:31,204 --> 00:10:33,206
Don't let up until
you finish the job!

211
00:10:33,289 --> 00:10:35,000
Knock him out, Kefla!

212
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:37,669
[BEERUS growls]

[ALL gasp]

214
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:05,572
He's all the way up
to Super Saiyan Blue!

215
00:11:05,655 --> 00:11:08,992
[TIEN] Does this mean Goku's
back to full strength already?

216
00:11:09,075 --> 00:11:11,327
Heh. It's about time.

217
00:11:11,411 --> 00:11:12,787
I've been waitin' for this.

218
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:15,498
Speaking of time, I was
trying to buy a little more,

219
00:11:15,582 --> 00:11:18,418
but if I hold back any longer,
I'll be in major trouble.

220

Took you this long
to realize that?

Well, better late than never!

to crank it up!

I still can't believe how
massive Kefla's power is!

226
00:12:03,296 --> 00:12:06,758
This time, Goku,
we fight for real.

227

[growls]

228
00:12:41,042 --> 00:12:44,713
That's it, Kefla! Go all
in and blow him away!

229
00:12:44,796 --> 00:12:46,840
My Lord, may I remind
you we're talking about

230
00:12:46,923 --> 00:12:48,925
Goku at Super Saiyan Blue?

231
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:51,511
It might be wiser to
test the waters first.

232
00:12:51,594 --> 00:12:53,346
Goku may have come a long way,

233
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,432
but he still hasn't recovered
his full stamina

234
00:12:55,515 --> 00:12:56,933
from when he fought with Jiren.

235
00:12:57,017 --> 00:12:59,769
So you believe that Kefla at
her lower Super Saiyan level

236
00:12:59,853 --> 00:13:01,187
can handle him?

237
00:13:01,271 --> 00:13:04,065
[CHAMPA] Oh, I do now.
Her energy in her current form

238
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:06,568
is much stronger
than I expected.

239
00:13:06,651 --> 00:13:09,279
Ha, ha, ha. Of course,
I'm hardly ever wrong,

240
00:13:09,362 --> 00:13:12,907
but this was a miscalculation
I don't mind at all.

Heh, heh, heh.

and piss your pants.

they going to go?

apart the entire ring?!

this much in that form,

running on fumes, Goku!

you won't surpass me!

you want to see that?

00:15:12,527 --> 00:15:14,529
Though I do hate to say
this about my nemesis,

286
00:15:14,612 --> 00:15:16,865
this is an impressive
battle to watch.

287
00:15:16,948 --> 00:15:18,450
Now which one will be crowned

288
00:15:18,533 --> 00:15:20,827
king or queen of
the Saiyan mountain?

289
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,496
Such suspense!
I think I'll treat myself

290
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,874
and watch this show
all the way to the end.

291
00:15:25,957 --> 00:15:29,294
Goku's obviously overextending
himself in this fight.

292
00:15:29,377 --> 00:15:32,339
That Kaio-ken technique boosts
his power in the short term,

293
00:15:32,422 --> 00:15:34,257
but it's a huge drain
on his energy.

294
00:15:34,341 --> 00:15:37,594
Using it when he's run-down
will cause big problems later.

295
00:15:37,677 --> 00:15:40,138
Goku was confronted with
the fearsome power of Kefla

296
00:15:40,221 --> 00:15:42,974
at Super Saiyan, and not even
his Blue could push her back.

297
00:15:43,058 --> 00:15:45,352
While he's well-aware of
the dangers of Kaio-Ken,

298
00:15:45,435 --> 00:15:47,604
he must have determined it
was his only hope to win.

buddy! You have to!

Come on, Kefla. The real
fight starts right now!

00:15:55,445 --> 00:15:58,239
Yeah. I can see that.
Damn, you're awesome!

a worthier challenge.

[GOKU]
Hmph.

321
00:16:41,908 --> 00:16:44,703
Yes! He nailed it!
Nicely done, Goku!

322
00:16:44,786 --> 00:16:46,538
Could that have been
a finishing blow?

323
00:16:46,621 --> 00:16:48,415
Don't quit yet. You're strong!

324
00:16:48,498 --> 00:16:50,667
You should still have
enough to get back up!

325
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,335
You can do it!

326
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:55,088
I gave you those earrings and
you're still mucking it up?

327
00:16:55,171 --> 00:16:57,799
Don't lose, or I'll
make you sorry!

328
00:16:57,882 --> 00:17:00,927
You hear me?!
You've got no excuse!

329
00:17:01,011 --> 00:17:03,847
Don't waste those Potaras
or you'll pay big!

330
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:06,433
I'm like a payback expert,

331
00:17:06,516 --> 00:17:10,520
and I'll make you pay big like
no one's ever paid big before!

332
00:17:10,603 --> 00:17:14,107
Oh, shut the hell up!
I'm sick of hearing your voice!

333
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:17,986
[KEFLA grunts] That gut-punch
really stung, Goku.

334
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:21,573
Savor it. 'Cause it's the last
one you're gonna land!

335
00:17:21,656 --> 00:17:24,743
Heh, heh. Now that's
more like it.

336
00:17:24,826 --> 00:17:26,119
[KEFLA]
Hmph.

337
00:17:26,202 --> 00:17:27,620
She sure is tough.

338
00:17:27,704 --> 00:17:29,205
And that was no glancing blow;

339
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:31,249
she took the full
force of his punch.

340
00:17:31,332 --> 00:17:32,667
There's no doubt.

341
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:35,086
Even merged, she must have
reached her body's limit.

342
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,422
Yet somehow, she's
managed to break through

343
00:17:37,505 --> 00:17:38,381
and keep fighting him.

344
00:17:38,465 --> 00:17:40,008
Must be her Saiyan blood--

345
00:17:40,091 --> 00:17:43,053
like Goku, she transcends and
finds new stores of power.

346
00:17:43,136 --> 00:17:45,555
[growls] Even Saiyans hit walls.

347
00:17:45,638 --> 00:17:47,474
And Goku's about to reach his.

348
00:17:47,557 --> 00:17:49,559
He has to win with
his next strike.

349
00:17:49,642 --> 00:17:52,729
Do you hear me, Goku? End this!

350
00:17:56,524 --> 00:17:59,235
Ya ready? Here goes! Ha! Ha!

351
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:03,406
You really think you're gonna
get me with that same attack?

352
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:06,159
Ha!

353
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:10,538
What?

354
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:11,790
[KEFLA yelling]

357
00:18:21,424 --> 00:18:22,175
Gah!

358
00:18:22,258 --> 00:18:23,468
It can't be!

359
00:18:23,551 --> 00:18:25,512
No! Goku!

360
00:18:25,595 --> 00:18:26,846
[KEFLA chuckles]

361
00:18:32,143 --> 00:18:34,020
Terrific attack, Kefla!

362
00:18:34,104 --> 00:18:35,939
With Goku knocked out
of the Tournament,

363
00:18:36,022 --> 00:18:39,067
the Sixth Universe will have
a clear path to victory!

364
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:43,822
Just finish the job!
Throw him over the side!

365
00:18:43,905 --> 00:18:46,366
I woulda liked to keep
going for a little longer,

366
00:18:46,449 --> 00:18:47,909
but you're obviously spent.

367
00:18:47,992 --> 00:18:49,953
You know what <i>that</i> means.

368
00:18:50,036 --> 00:18:53,164
It's time to take
the plunge, Goku.

369
00:18:57,293 --> 00:18:58,128
[GOKU grunting]

370
00:18:58,211 --> 00:18:59,295
Huh?

371
00:18:59,379 --> 00:19:00,922
[GOKU grunting]

372
00:19:04,926 --> 00:19:09,389
[GOKU]
No. This isn't over yet, Kefla.

373
00:19:09,472 --> 00:19:10,682
He got back up!

374
00:19:10,765 --> 00:19:14,310
[CHAMPA laughing]
He's downright woozy!

375
00:19:14,394 --> 00:19:17,480
You've got this! Just lay
into him one more time!

376
00:19:17,564 --> 00:19:20,358
Hurry, Kefla! Finish him!

377
00:19:20,442 --> 00:19:23,361
[KEFLA] Heh, heh.
Still want to go at it, huh?

378
00:19:23,445 --> 00:19:26,573
Well that's okay with me!
Just remember you asked--

379
00:19:26,656 --> 00:19:29,284
when you're choking on my power!

380
00:19:39,794 --> 00:19:40,587

All right, what the
hell just happened?

383
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:48,720
[KEFLA] That was a fluke! Just
blind, stupid luck, you hear me?

384
00:19:48,803 --> 00:19:51,598
And I guarantee you won't be
so lucky this time around.

385
00:19:51,681 --> 00:19:55,435
When I drill these
right into your skull!

386
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,912
What? How did he do that?

387
00:20:25,674 --> 00:20:27,717
His... His eyes!

388
00:20:27,801 --> 00:20:28,551
[CHAMPA gasping]

389
00:20:28,635 --> 00:20:29,761
No way!

390
00:20:29,844 --> 00:20:32,347
Look at the form he's
taken... that glow!

391
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:35,016
[KRILLIN] It's incredible!
Just like when he fought Jiren!

392
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:39,020
[TIEN]
Yes, it's unmistakable.

393
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:42,107
And once again, he's
shattered his own limits.

394
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,401
[BEERUS growling]

395
00:20:44,484 --> 00:20:46,695
I never thought he'd
achieve this divine feat

396
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,071
again in the Tournament.

397
00:20:48,154 --> 00:20:49,823
That we would have the
pleasure of seeing it twice.

398
00:20:49,906 --> 00:20:52,409
Well this time I'll make
sure to soak it up.

399
00:20:52,492 --> 00:20:55,620
Heh. Autonomous Ultra Instinct!

400
00:20:55,704 --> 00:20:57,497
I am looking forward to this!

401
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:00,792
Yes! I will enjoy him very much!

[NARRATOR] The extreme battle
against the merged warrior

404
00:21:18,435 --> 00:21:21,938
Kefla has once again propelled
Goku to the vaunted level

405
00:21:22,022 --> 00:21:24,190
even Destroyers
struggle to master:

406
00:21:24,274 --> 00:21:26,276
Autonomous Ultra Instinct.

407
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:29,988
They are extraordinary
Saiyans who refuse all limits,

408
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:32,824
and continue to find
new levels of power.

409
00:21:32,907 --> 00:21:36,202
Will Goku's Ultra Instinct
spell the end for Kefla,

410
00:21:36,286 --> 00:21:38,872
or will she find some way
to match his heights

411
00:21:38,955 --> 00:21:41,583
and keep her Universe's
hopes alive?

412
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:44,961
Nineteen minutes remain in
the fateful Tournament of Power.

413
00:21:45,045 --> 00:21:47,839
Next time, on Dragon Ball Super!

[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

427
00:22:52,654 --> 00:22:55,115
Thanks to Kefla's amazing
power-ups forcing me

428
00:22:55,198 --> 00:22:57,450
into a corner, I've somehow
managed to reach

429
00:22:57,534 --> 00:23:00,036
Autonomous Ultra Instinct again!

430
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,538
But she's still not giving up,

431
00:23:01,621 --> 00:23:03,748
and launches another
massive assault.

432
00:23:03,832 --> 00:23:05,959
With these reflexes I can dodge,

433
00:23:06,042 --> 00:23:08,962
but can I figure out
how to attack?

434
00:23:09,045 --> 00:23:11,339
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

435
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:12,882
"Signs of a Turnabout!

00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,595
Make sure you
don't miss it, okay?
