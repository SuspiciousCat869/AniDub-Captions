[NARRATOR] Previously,
on Dragon Ball Super,

26
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:57,250
Goku reminded everyone
of an ultimate tournament

27
00:01:57,333 --> 00:02:02,291
between universes, which Grand
Zeno had proposed some time ago.

28
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:04,333
Let's make it
the best one ever!

you guys are the best.

I can guarantee,
it's gonna be super exciting.

35
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:19,625
[NARRATOR] And so, the epic
contest was put into motion,

36
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:22,416
and the Omni-King's
Grand Minister was sent

37
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,041
to announce the details.

38
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:28,708

On day 3,135,500,603

at precisely 1:57 o'clock,

00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:35,208
the Tournament of Power
shall commence in all its glory.

41
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:39,083
Ten warriors from each universe
shall engage in epic combat!

42
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,791
So now we have to look for ten?

It is a special place, indeed.

The Null Realm.

The Null Realm?

52
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,291
[BEERUS] It's a world
of infinite emptiness,

53

where not even
time or space exist.

54
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:19,041
[GRAND MINISTER] Since literally
nothing's in the Null Realm

55
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,458
there's nothing to break,
thus you'll be free

56
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:24,291
to fight as
vigorously as you like.

57
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,958
Also. As with
the tournament you held

between the Sixth
and the Seventh,

the ultimate champion
of our competition

00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,166
will be awarded
the Super Dragon Balls,

61
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,791
which will grant
whatever wish is desired.

62
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,083
They have already been gathered

in preparation
of this grand event.

he got three of them from me!

collecting them once again?!

E-Excuse me.
And what prize does

69
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:55,583

Uh, what? Like, go on stage?

No, no. They get to
go on as before.

You're jumping the gun.

Grand Zeno intended for this
announcement to come later,

76
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:17,541
but due to your friendship
with the Omni-King, Goku,

77
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,583
I guess I'll make an exception.

For the universes that
don't win shall be eliminated.

Uh, could you repeat that?

It's simple. All of
the defeated universes

83
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,708
will be promptly
wiped from existence.

see to it personally.

to ask of you in the meantime.

--[BEERUS swallows]
--What's the favor?

92
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,458
A show. He'd like
to have some fighters

93
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,500
from the Seventh,
yourself included,

94
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,166
going up against
champions from the Ninth.

95
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,916
Think of it as a warm-up act
before the main show begins.

[GOKU]
Uh?

You see, the Grand Zeno from
the alternate future timeline

00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,250

opportunity to witness

against Universe Six.

Oh yes, very much!

[GRAND MINISTER] What's needed
is a demonstration.

109
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,166
Our Omni-King wants to bring
his counterpart up to speed,

110
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,833
and build excitement
in them both

for the upcoming
tournament proper.

112

To that end,
we'd like you to take part

113
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:48,583
in these run-up matches, which
we are calling the Zeno Expo.

So, who am I
gonna get to take on?

Well, that remains to be seen,

but as I said, it will be
someone from the Ninth.

That's odd. Why'd they
choose Universe Nine?

I agree, that's an
intriguing question, sir.

But I would say that's the least
of our concerns at the moment.

You're hopeless! Do you
have any comprehension

of what this stunt you've pulled
is going to do to the cosmos?

He's right.
Imagine for a moment

if the whole Seventh Universe
is plucked from existence.

I could never forgive myself.

And now all the universes
face the same threat.

go ask Zenny <i>not</i> to pluck

obliterate it from existence?

Though your intentions are good
I must advise against that.

The Omni-Kings and
Grand Minister may seem amiable,

143

but they don't like dissent.

144
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,541
If you criticize their plan,
they might destroy

You are a temporary plaything,

hesitate to obliterate you,

158
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,166
Pay what price?!

159
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,250
Fine. I don't care who I fight.

160
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:55,000
All I know is I have to
win this tournament.

161
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,458
No matter what!

162
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,500
Indeed. As awful as this is

163
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,666
we have no choice
but to play along.

164
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,333
First, we need to build
the team for this Expo.

165
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,125
Then we can worry
about finding all ten

166
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,750
for the tournament after that.

167
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,125
Right. Well I'll take one spot!

168
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,625
Yes, we know! Moron!

169
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:18,125
Now find two more.
It's your mess to fix, so go!

170
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,791
[VEGETA ]
We've been over this already!

171
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,958
I am waiting for my child!

172
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,666
Okay, Vegeta, chill out.

173
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,041
You don't have to
yell my ear off.

174
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,541
--[GOTEN] Here I come!
--[TRUNKS] Bring it on!

177
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,541
[GOTEN]
Ooo, ow!

178
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:37,708
Yo!

179
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,583
--Hey, Dad, what's up!
--[TRUNKS] Gotcha!

180
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,833
[GOTEN groans]

181
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,750
No fair, that was a cheap shot!

182
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,458
So what! You were
wide open, dude!

183
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,333
[GOTEN]
All right, take this!

184
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:51,041
I don't know what this
"Zeno Expo" is, Kakarot.

185
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,791
But if you need help,
then why not ask your son?

186
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:57,291
Yeah, I could. But I have
no idea who we're gonna fight.

187
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,291
Goten may not be
up to the challenge yet.

188
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,125
--[GOTEN yells]
--[TRUNKS grunts]

189
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,625
[GOKU]
Wait. My <i>other</i> son!

190
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:04,916
Now I get it!

191
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,333
Thanks, Vegeta!
That's a great idea!

192
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,250
[VEGETA]
Hmph!

193
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,833
[GOHAN]
Hm?

194
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:16,583
A Zeno Expo and
a Tournament of Power?

195
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:19,458
Inter-universe match-ups
sound pretty intense, Dad.

196
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:22,458
Yeah, exactly, that's why
we need your help to win!

197
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,250
You want me? But why?

198
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:27,125
You'll be fine, son.
Sure, you haven't kept up

199
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,333
with your training,
but it'll come back!

200
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,666
You've got great instincts
and incredible power

201
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,000
locked up in there--
we've all seen it!

202
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,333
I don't know.

203
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,708
[GOKU]
Hm?

204
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,666
Look, the truth
is this tournament

205
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,708
could be kind of a problem.

206
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,166
Wait, what do you mean?

207
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,208
[whispers] I'll tell you,
but you have to promise

208
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:49,458
you won't tell Videl,
or anyone else, okay?

209
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:50,708
Okay.

210
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,250
Supposedly every universe
that loses this

211
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,916
will be completely
wiped out by Grand Zeno.

212
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,458
Uuh! Huh...?

213
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,833
Wiped out? Like, seriously?

214
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,500
Seriously.

215
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,708
How could you?

216
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,208
Uh?

217
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:16,625
Dad. How could you let
something like this happen?

218
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:20,208
If word spreads,
riots will break out everywhere.

219
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,291
And if he actually
goes through with it.

220
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,041
I know it sounds bad, okay?

221
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,500
Supreme Kai and Lord Beerus
already laid into me,

222
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,375
but maybe it's all just a bluff.

223
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,458
[GOHAN]
And if it's not, what then?

224
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:33,458
Can you stop it? Can you
do anything about it, Dad?

225
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,916
Well, I'm not sure yet;
we'll have to play this out

226
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,250
and deal with it if it happens.

227
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:40,416
But that's insane!
[gasps]

228
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,208
Wait. Does anyone else
know about this?

229
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:47,666
Not here on Earth.
Just you and me so far.

230
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,041
[GOHAN] Well, we need
to keep it that way.

231
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,083
You can't tell anybody else!

232
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,458
And I won't tell either--
we can't cause a panic!

233
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:56,958
[VIDEL]
What's up, you guys?

234
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,541
If you want to visit,
you should come inside!

235
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,500
Yo!

236
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:03,000
Nothing! Nothing to worry about!

237
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,916
[GOKU] Yeah, I was just
inviting Gohan to enter

238
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,916
a martial arts tournament
with me, that's all.

239
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,333
But apparently he's
too busy to help his old man

240
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,125
and join the fight.

241
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,833
Yeah, you know,
kinda gave up all that!

242
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,291
Aw, come on, it's just
a tournament, right?

243

[GOHAN]
Huh?

244
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,458
Why don't you help him?
I think you'd have fun!

I see Pan she's bigger

need Buu for this one. Cool?

know what will happen if
we lose the main tournament?

[whispering] Only Gohan does.
He said we shouldn't

285
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,250
tell anyone else since
it would cause a big panic

286

and make things worse.
Is that right?

at least I can say that.

[GOKU chuckles]

337

Loyal Supreme Kais and
Destroyers of the Twelve,

338
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,541
thank you for joining us today.

339
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:07,166
As I informed you earlier,
we gather here to prepare

340
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,750
for the upcoming
martial arts competition,

341
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:13,833
which Grand Zeno has named
the Tournament of Power.

342
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,208
For those who don't know,

343
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,375
our great Omni-King
has a new companion.

344
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:20,083
It's his own counterpart
from an alternate future.

345
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,916
Due to timeline discrepancies,

346
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,833
that Grand Zeno has never seen
a martial arts tournament.

347
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:29,041
So we will remedy that
with this: our Zeno Expo.

348

Great deities. Before we start,

370
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,166
we should acknowledge
a mortal from the Seventh

371
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,916
who's enthusiasm helped
set this all in motion.

372
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,166
Without him we wouldn't
have gathered here today.

373
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,166
Would you care
to speak, Saiyan?

374
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,625
Sure.

375
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:42,666
I'm Goku. And I heard
the other universes

376
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,041
had strong fighters
I didn't know about!

377
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,166
So I said to Zenny,
it would be great

378
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,791
to fight all those guys.

379
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:53,166
And he was nice enough
to set it all up!

Thank you, Goku.

it's gonna be amazing!

[GRAND MINISTER]
Thank you, Goku.

387
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,375
Now then, let's get
to the particulars.

388
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,291
In keeping with
our Omni-King's wishes,

389
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,916
this Zeno Expo will be
comprised of successive

390
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,750
one-on-one matches
between three martial artists

391
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:22,166
from the Seventh Universe
and three from the Ninth.

392
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,833
These contests will
have no time limits.

393
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,708
Each match will go on
until one opponent

394
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:30,541
declares defeat or is rendered
incapable of continuing.

395
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,708
Combatants are allowed
and expected to use

396
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:35,500
all powers they have
in pursuit of victory.

397
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,791
[RO]
A question, Grand Minister!

398
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:40,750
What will the winning universe
receive as their reward,

399
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,791
for being superior?

400
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:45,166
The only point
of this Expo is to show

401
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,958
the appeal of martial arts
to His Majesty's

402
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:50,375
esteemed counterpart
from the future.

403
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,708
It's not intended
to judge these universes,

404
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:55,416
so there is no reward.
Though that is not to suggest

405
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,708
these are matches
without consequence.

406
00:18:57,791 --> 00:19:00,041
If he feels that your fighters
don't live up to the task,

407
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:02,125
he may take drastic measures.

408
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,458
[RO]
Ngh!

409
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,791
Grand Minister, are you
implying if he gets bored

410
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,708
and doesn't think
they're impressive enough,

411
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,833
he might exterminate
the fighters,

412
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,750
or the whole universe?

413
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:15,833
All I can say with accuracy
is those possibilities do exist.

414
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:19,166
It all depends on the whims
of the Omni-Kings.

415
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,625
Now, let's get on with the Expo!

[BUU giggles]

00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,333
<i>An angel and a demon sit</i>

475
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:03,458
<i>One to my right,</i>
<i>one to my left</i>

476
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:09,541
<i>In between I'm tryin'</i>
<i>to figure out the right way</i>

477
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:12,458
<i>Is one way good?</i>
<i>Is one way bad?</i>

478
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:15,625
<i>Too much confusion in my head</i>

479
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:21,000
<i>I can't think with all</i>
<i>this noise, I'm goin' crazy</i>

480
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:25,041
<i>Is there any way to know</i>
<i>what's right or wrong?</i>

481
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:29,916
<i>Demons in an angel mask</i>

482
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,083
<i>Hopin' that I'll do</i>
<i>just what they ask</i>

483
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:36,166
<i>Telling me</i>
<i>they know what's right</i>

484
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,125
<i>Lead me to the light</i>

00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:42,083
<i>"For the sake of everyone</i>

486
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:45,083
<i>You have to destroy</i>
<i>the evil ones</i>

487
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:48,083
<i>That's the only path, you see"</i>

488
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:51,708
<i>So they said to me</i>

Hey! It's me, Goku!

490
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:03,958
And things aren't
looking good for Buu.

491
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:07,041
This Basil guy's kicks
have some incredible force,

492
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:09,083
and they may too much to handle.

493
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:11,666
[GOHAN]
Please, Buu, this isn't a game!

494
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,416
You've got to get serious!

495
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,083
Our whole universe
may be on the line!

496
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:18,666
[GOKU] Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

497
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,083
"The 9th Universe's
Kicking Basil vs.

498
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,541
the 7th Universe's Majin Buu!!"

499
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:25,666
Make sure you don't
miss it, okay?
