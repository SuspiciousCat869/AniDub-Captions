Top the Destroyer,

329
00:21:26,443 --> 00:21:29,112
leaving Jiren as
the only opponent left.

330
00:21:29,195 --> 00:21:31,823
But even though he is
outnumbered four to one,

331
00:21:31,906 --> 00:21:34,826
Jiren has begun to unleash
his hidden power,

332
00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:37,704
becoming an even
more incredible foe.

333
00:21:37,787 --> 00:21:40,415
Four minutes remain in
the Tournament of Power.

334
00:21:40,498 --> 00:21:43,460
Next time, on Dragon Ball Super.

335
00:21:48,381 --> 00:21:51,926
<i>Whirling all around</i>
<i>and then back again</i>

336
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:55,847
<i>The song that connects you</i>
<i>to the heavens</i>

337
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:59,392
<i>Strength that goes</i>
<i>beyond all measure</i>

338
00:21:59,476 --> 00:22:02,270
<i>Expanding to a beat</i>
<i>that won't end</i>

339
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:05,982
<i>The meteors fall like rain drops</i>

340
00:22:06,066 --> 00:22:09,736
<i>Astrological tears</i>
<i>from my eyelids</i>

341
00:22:09,819 --> 00:22:15,075
<i>A strong emotion</i>
<i>from deep within</i>

342
00:22:15,158 --> 00:22:17,369
<i>Has been awakened</i>

343
00:22:17,452 --> 00:22:20,997
<i>A spark of possibility</i>

344
00:22:21,081 --> 00:22:24,834
<i>Shines softly like a star</i>
<i>in the night sky</i>

345
00:22:24,918 --> 00:22:29,923
<i>A wish from long</i>
<i>ago now shoots by</i>

346
00:22:30,006 --> 00:22:32,217
<i>And I'm awakened</i>

347
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,970
<i>A never-ending melody,</i>
<i>so enchanting</i>

348
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:39,724
<i>You're always the one</i>
<i>who makes me tremble</i>

349
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:44,020
<i>The meteors keep falling down</i>

350
00:22:44,104 --> 00:22:47,315
<i>Surging right into my heart</i>

351
00:22:51,569 --> 00:22:53,071
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

352
00:22:53,154 --> 00:22:55,240
Now that Jiren's unleashing
his hidden power,

353
00:22:55,323 --> 00:22:56,783
he's even more off-the-charts,

354
00:22:56,866 --> 00:22:58,618
and I don't care how
many fighters we have,

355
00:22:58,702 --> 00:23:00,578
it's hard to see how
we can take him down!

356
00:23:00,662 --> 00:23:03,498
Jiren's breaking up our combo
attacks like they're nothing!

357
00:23:03,581 --> 00:23:05,583
And with Vegeta and me
in serious trouble,

358
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:08,545
it looks like it's up to
17 to get us through!

359
00:23:08,628 --> 00:23:10,964
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

360
00:23:11,047 --> 00:23:14,092
"The Approaching Wall!
A Hopeful Final Barrier!"

361
00:23:14,175 --> 00:23:16,136
Make sure you don't
miss it, okay?
