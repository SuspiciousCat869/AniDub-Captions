00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,250
[OOLONG]
You're making it worse!

158
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:03,916
Unlike you, I can't handle this
"win or we're doomed" thing!

159
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,083
Sometime today, piggy!
My time's a precious commodity!

160
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,875
[OOLONG] All right,
all right. I'll do it!

161
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,458
But if I lose, don't hold

162
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,250
the destruction
of Earth against me.

163
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,666
Come on down, piggy.

164
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,208
[grunts]

165
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,708
Ready, pig man?

166
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,500
Let's rock.

167
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,291
I think that conger eel
will go nicely

168
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,500
with this yellow tail.

169
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,416
[grunts]

170
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,333
Throw on three, ya got it?

171
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:26,500
[BEERUS, OOLONG]
One. Two. Throw!

172
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,666
[BEERUS growls]

173
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:00,500
Uh. It's a tie.

174
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,583
[OOLONG screams]
Whadda we do now?

175
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:06,916
[ALL sigh]

176
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,791
[panting]

177
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:16,083
[BEERUS] A pig tied
a god of destruction?

178
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:18,541
Be honest, did you
throw yours a second late?

179
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:21,458
[OOLONG] What? Heck no!
I'd never cheat with a god!

180
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,166
It just seems odd.

181
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,750
[OOLONG]
Hang on! If I threw late,

182
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,750
why would I bother tying you
when I could just win outright?

183
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:30,458
Hmm. Piggy has a point.

184
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,375
[SUSHI CHEF 7A] All right,
I think I got everything.

185
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:37,916
Thanks for your patience.

186
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,583
Enjoy the sushi sampler!

187
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:43,125
[WHIS] Thank you! You have
a rare talent, my friend.

188
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:46,458
Uh, thank <i>you</i> , sir!
I hope to serve you again soon.

189
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:49,458
Hmph. Well yes.
That'd be nice.

190
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,833
But I'm afraid
it's unlikely, chef.

191
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:56,041
Though I suppose anything can
happen in a game that simple.

192
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,916
There can't be a tie.
Let's try again.

193
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,500
[BEERUS, OOLONG]
And rock, paper, scissors.

194
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,791
One. Two. Throw!

195
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:14,958
[KRILLIN sighs]

196
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,583
[CHICHI]
Oh, I can't bear to look!

197
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,333
Well, maybe just a little peek.

198
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,625
My. You're quite stubborn.

199
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:23,250
[OOLONG]
Yeah. So are you.

200
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:26,208
Ugh. This is starting
to get annoying.

201
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,166
[PICCOLO]
These ties are no good.

202
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,125
The longer they stalemate,
the more likely

203
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:33,875
Beerus will give up
and destroy the earth anyway.

204
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:39,166
[BULMA gasps]
Uh hey, uh, Oolong.

205
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,458
If you save the earth for us,

206
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:43,416
I'll let you have
any prize you want, okay?

207
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,916
[OOLONG]
Huh?

208
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,708
[OOLONG yells]

209
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:56,750
[inhales, exhales]

210
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:59,541
Time to get real.

211
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:02,500
Wait, what's that mean?
You're scaring me!

212
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,708
[OOLONG]
Huh?

213
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,791
All right pig, I've decided.

214
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:24,541
Let's see what my hand says!

215
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:36,375
We're not gonna tie this time!

216
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:39,291
They're both really
confident going into this round.

217
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:42,208
[YAMCHA]
It all comes down to this.

218
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,333
[BEERUS, OOLONG]
And rock, paper, scissors.

219
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,791
One, two, throw!

220
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:51,291
[yells]

221
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:01,666
Heh.

222
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,916
[ALL shriek]

223
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
No? He lost!

224
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:08,666
[PUAR]
You stupid, dumb, idiot!

225
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,916
What kinda player throws the
same thing three times in a row!

226
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,250
Get off me, Puar!

227
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,833
Haven't you ever heard
"third time's the charm"?

228
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,291
No, expecting
a different result

229
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,916
is the definition of insanity!

230
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,666
Who are you calling "insane"?

231
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:22,083
You're the one clawing
at my face like a feral cat!

232
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,958
[PUAR] I had plans
for tonight! Plans!

233
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,041
[KRILLIN]
There's no point, Puar!

234
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,416
[VEGETA grunts]

235
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:45,375
My lord! I've got
our food for the road.

236
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,458
[BEERUS] Don't expect us
to split that, Whis.

237
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,666
I saw you feasting down there.

238
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,125
[laughs]

239
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,416
Guilty as charged.
I just couldn't resist.

240
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,833
Now, we'd better
head out before it spoils.

241
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,291
[BEERUS]
Right.

242
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,958
What d'ya think, Piccolo?

243
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,500
If you, me, and everybody else

244
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,375
hit him all at once
with everything we got,

245
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,166
would it be enough
to buy us some time?

246
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,208
No, it wouldn't
make a difference.

247
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,500
[gasps]

248
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,833
[VEGETA grunts]

249
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,583
It's the end of your story.

250
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:59,666
Goodbye forever, Planet Earth.

251
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:04,041
[GOKU]
Stop right there!

252
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,750
[ALL gasp]

253
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:27,708
Goku's here!

254
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,375
Kakarot!

255
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:32,791
Whoa!

256
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,333
--All right!
--Oh, honey!

257
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:39,666
[GOTEN]
Dad's here!

258
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,750
[GOHAN]
Yeah, good timing!

259
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:43,291
Hmph. Finally decided to show.

260
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:46,083
[CHICHI] Yeah, you're always
cutting it so close.

261
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,750
First off,
happy birthday, Bulma.

262
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,416
There are more
important things to do

263
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,916
than wish me happy birthday!

264
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,458
I know, it's not enough.

265
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,958
I promise I'll buy you a present
as soon as I get to a mall.

266
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:59,375
And by the way, how old are you
turning this year, anyway?

267
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,291
My birthday and my age
don't matter right now.

268
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,458
Don't you see that
giant blast up there!

269
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,291
[GOKU]
Oh yeah, that!

270
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,416
Well well, look who's returned.

271
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,916
With good news, I hope.

272
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,458
Did you actually figure out who
this "Super Saiyan God" is

273
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,333
that I'm supposed to fight?

274
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:16,583
Sorry, Beerus.
Still no idea on that count.

275
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:19,333
In the meantime, could you
please not blow up the earth?

276
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:22,291
I must! I beat the pig man
at rock-paper-scissors

277
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:23,791
fair and square!

278
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,750
Hold on. Did you seriously
decide the fate of this planet

279
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,958
by playing rock-paper-scissors
with Oolong?

280
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,541
So what? We already know
that you're not strong enough

281
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,541
to stop me
from doing what I want.

282
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,625
[GOKU]
Hm, you've got me there.

283
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,041
You're right, Lord Beerus.

284
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:39,416
You're stronger than me
in every way.

285
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,833
Wait. I have an idea.
Before you destroy the earth,

286
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,500
let's take a chance
and test something!

287
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,125
[BEERUS]
What do you suggest?

288
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,958
Well like I said,
I don't know who or what

289
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:50,000
a Super Saiyan God is,
but there might be a way

290
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,916
to bring one here, because I
know exactly who we should ask!

291
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,208
Just give me a little time
to put this into action, okay.

292
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,208
Please? Can you do that?

293
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:01,750
Uuh. Mmm.

294
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,666
[chuckles]

295
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,375
Super Saiyan please?

296
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:11,541
[BEERUS grunts]

297
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:14,208
All right. A teeny
little bit of time.

298
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:19,625
Thank you!
You won't be sorry!

299
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:22,791
How can you find someone
you're not sure even exists?

300
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:25,166
I'm asking our old friend
Shenron for help!

301
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,333
[WHIS] Lord Beerus,
you surprise me.

302
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:28,666
I thought you'd
given up any hope

303
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,833
of finding this
Super Saiyan God.

304
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,291
[BEERUS]
I woke up after a measly

305
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,083
thirty-nine-year nap for this.

306
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,875
If there's any chance
he's not bluffing,

307
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:37,250
I might as well take it.

308
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,791
[WHIS]
How level-headed of you.

309
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,958
That said, this reprieve
I've given them

310
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,416
shall be the last.

311
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,583
If he can't find the
Super Saiyan God for me,

312
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,541
I'll destroy
more than this planet.

313
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:49,041
The whole solar system will pay.

314
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,458
[GOKU] Sorry, Birthday Girl,
but I need the Dragon Balls.

315
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,833
Wha--?

316
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:55,416
Hey boys, if I had to guess,
I'd say you've already

317
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,875
searched and found
where's she's hiding

318
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:58,250
all the bingo prizes,
am I right?

319
00:20:58,333 --> 00:20:59,500
That's right, Dad!

320
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,375
[TRUNKS] Yeah! Mom's got
all seven Dragon Balls

321
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:04,833
in a vault onboard. They're
the grand prize this time.

322
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:07,750
Young man! They're
supposed to be a surprise!

323
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:08,875
[TRUNKS chuckles]

324
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,750
Goten went and
looked at them, too.

325
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,916
I'm sorry, Bulma.
We couldn't resist.

326
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,708
I can't trust you guys
with anything, can I?

327
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,291
[VEGETA]
Wait, Kakarot!

328
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,625
Exactly how long
have you been watching us?

329
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:20,541
[GOKU giggles]

330
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,083
[VEGETA]
Don't laugh this, off!

331
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,541
[GOKU] Let's not worry about
that now. We've got work to do.

332
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:26,708
I'm sorry, Bulma.

333
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:29,041
But I think Shenron's
our only chance here.

334
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,458
[BULMA] You know what that
cat-eared weirdo did to me?

335
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,458
If you need them, you can
use the Dragon Balls

336
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:34,708
however you want!

337
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:37,000
Hey now! Go easy
on the insults, Bulma.

338
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:39,541
That's Lord Beerus the Destroyer
God you're talking about,

339
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:42,375
and he's probably the strongest
guy in the entire universe.

340
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,458
That's a lot of
information to take in.

341
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:47,375
So you're saying
he's an actual god?

342
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:53,083
[BEERUS]
Hm.

[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

357
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:05,083
Shenron's gotta find this
Super Saiyan God guy fast

358
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:06,708
so we can save the earth!

359
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:09,125
But Shenron's saying he
just can't make him show up,

360
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:11,041
and the dragon
is shaking in fear!

361
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:12,666
I've never seen that before!

362
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,708
It's looks like if we
want this God to show,

363
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:17,000
we have to summon him ourselves!

364
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:19,250
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

365

"Thanks for Waiting,
Lord Beerus!

366

A Super Saiyan God
Is Born at Last!"

367

Make sure you don't miss it!
