<i>(Boogie Back!)</i>

475
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:39,541
<i>Give me happy ever after</i>

476
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:44,375
<i>Let the dream</i>

477
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:46,250
<i>Boogie Back!</i>

[GOKU]
Hey, it's me, Goku!

482
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,750
If history's taught me anything,

483
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:05,791
it's that nothing
can wake up Buu.

484
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:07,583
And without him,
we don't stand a chance

485
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:09,791
in the Tournament of Power.

486
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:13,666
Oh no, now Krillin and 18
are backin' out, too?

487
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,125
Well, that's no good!

488
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:18,500
At this rate, our universe
will be wiped out for sure!

489
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:20,791
Next time, on Dragon Ball Super:

490
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:24,416
"A State of Emergency!
Failure to Reach Ten Members!"

491
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,791
Make sure you
don't miss it, okay?
