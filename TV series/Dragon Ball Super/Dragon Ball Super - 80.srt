00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,708
Where is he?

165
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,250
[laughs]

166
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,458
I must say, quite
the clever gambit.

167
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:55,291
It will be difficult to detect
his presence from that distance.

168
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,375
[LAVENDER chuckles]

169

[laughing]

172
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,541
Uh! Whoa, this is bad!

173
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,416
Yeah, it could be bad.

174
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,958
[MR. SATAN]
Huh?

175
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:23,375
Although, the more Gohan
gets backed into a corner,

176
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:26,208
the better he learns to cope
with what he's up against.

177
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,916
[snickers]

178
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,041
That was incredible, Lavender!
Now finish him off!

179
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,458
Oh, I'm on it!

180
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:43,291
I'm going to enjoy this!

181
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,291
[GOHAN]
I'm not done yet.

182
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:51,125
My power goes beyond
what you've seen so far.

183
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:57,166
[yelling]

184
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:03,000
What the hell did he just do?

185
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:33,208
Ha! Big deal! Who cares
if he's glowing a little?

186
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:36,000
Whoa! What is that?

187
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,291
That is what they
call a Super Saiyan.

188
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,958
It's so pretty. He's shiny now.

189
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:43,208
Not to mention much stronger.

190
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:44,916
Super Saiyan, was it?

191
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,375
[TOP]
Hm. He appears to be a lifeform

192
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,416
capable of altering
his battle power.

193
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:55,791
[yells]

194
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,750
Even if you are lit up and
a teensy bit stronger,

195
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:02,166
you still don't know how
I'm going to attack you next.

196
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,500
Yeah? Go ahead and try me.

197
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,041
[growls]

198
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,916
How'd he do that?

199
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,500
[ZENO]
He blocked it!

200
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:22,916
Yeah, that was neat!

201
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,875
You got lucky, kid! That's all!

202
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,583
[screams]

203
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,333
[GOHAN yells]

204
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,291
I don't get it!
How can you see me?

205
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,916
I don't need to see.

206
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,583
My energy tells me where you
are and what you're gonna do.

207
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,500
Not bad, Gohan. Not bad at all.

208
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,875
By bouncing his own
energy off of his opponent,

209
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,208
Gohan is able to
detect his every move.

210
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:04,041
One might call this technique
a form of active radar.

211
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,291
Though it is a novel
and resourceful use

212
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,583
of his Super Saiyan abilities,

213
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:13,000
it may prove to be something of
a double-edged sword in the end.

214
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:16,333
In that case, he's gotta
wrap this up quick!

215
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,208
[yells]

216
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,541
It's all over for you now!

217
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:37,416
[gasps]

218
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,416
[groaning]

219
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:48,041
[laughs]

220
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,250
He was trying to push
his enemy to the limit,

221
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,958
but he ended up pushing
himself beyond it first.

222
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,458
Yes.

223
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,916
And in so doing, he hastened
the spread of the poison.

224
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,958
Is that the double-edged sword
you were referring to before?

225
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:03,125
[WHIS] Well, it is conceivable
that by turning Super Saiyan,

226
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,625
he fueled the poison,
allowing it to circulate

227
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:08,750
throughout his entire body
at a much more rapid pace.

228
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,666
You won't get away!

229
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,416
[yelling]

230
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,041
Oh, no! Using his power will
just spread the toxin faster!

00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,083
[BOTH]
Whoa!

232
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,625
Getting desperate, huh?

233
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:44,666
Ha! This fight ain't gonna
be that easy for you!

234
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:49,458
Oh, don't you worry.
I'm well aware of that!

into the poison!

What?!

00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:42,041
You were baiting me
into dropping my guard!

243
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:45,375
As long as I've got you, it
doesn't matter if I can't see!

Well, what's gonna happen now?

248
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,250
As neither contestant
remains standing,

249
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,833
the second match is
officially a draw.

250

[BOTH laugh]

251

It's a draw?

252
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,375
It would appear that
the poison really has

253
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,833
taken its toll on young Gohan.

254
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,416
[GOKU] Gohan, here's a
Senzu. Open up, buddy.

255
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:01,583
Dad, I-I'm sorry.

256
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:04,583
Don't be. Ya did
great out there.

257
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:09,458
I can take him. I kept
telling myself that.

258
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:12,166
And yet, still, I wasn't
good enough to win.

259
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,958
That fight was amazing.

260
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,708
I got so excited watching it.

261
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:19,750
Listen, you're stronger
than you think.

262
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:23,291
No, got a long way to go.

263
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:28,250
Ladies and gentlemen,
assembled deities.

264
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:31,791
I have a message for you
from the Omni-King.

265
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,583
Grand Zeno is deeply
moved that those

266
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,166
of the lowest-ranking
mortal levels

267
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,000
would treat us to battles
as extraordinary

268
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,375
as the ones we've
just witnessed,

269
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,000
and would like to
extend his gratitude

270
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,916
to all the fighters
for their efforts.

271
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,500
Wait, mortal?

272
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:50,625
What levels?

273
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,250
You see, Grand Zeno
has carefully

274
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:56,958
evaluated all twelve universes,
and assigned each one a ranking.

275
00:17:57,041 --> 00:18:01,000
So, um, how did the Seventh
Universe fare in his estimation?

276
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,125
Among all worlds
populated by mortals

277
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:06,791
within the Seventh Universe,
the average level is 3.18.

278
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:09,000
Which is rather poor.

279
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,166
That's second from
the bottom, in fact.

280
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,916
[yelps]

281
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,416
Pardon me, but if we're
the second from the bottom,

282
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,875
then which universe would
be ranked lower than us?

283
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,708
I'm sure you already know.

284
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:23,541
[RO gasps]

285
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,000
You can't mean--!

286
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,333
That's correct.

287
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:29,500
The Ninth Universe's average
level is the lowest.

288
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,916
A meager 1.86.

289
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,708
[gasps]

290
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:37,666
Now, as for this
Tournament of Power,

291
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,916
the Omni-King has long said that
there are far too many universes

292
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,166
in the cosmos.

293
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,666
Which is why the proposal

294
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,708
offered by Goku of
the Seventh Universe

295
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,208
presented the
perfect opportunity.

296
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,083
[GOKU]
Uh.

297
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:53,625
Those universes defeated in
the Tournament of Power,

298
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:56,708
are to be eliminated
by Grand Zeno himself.

299
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:57,875
Say what?!

300
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:04,125
[DEITIES chattering]

301
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:05,916
So if we lose
these Expo matches,

302
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,083
does that mean our universe
will be annihilated, too?

303
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:11,416
[GRAND MINISTER]
No, that won't be happening.

304
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,750
[sighs]

305
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,458
Uh, hold on. Did he
just say eliminated?

306
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:17,000
Sorry, I'm just havin'
a little bit a trouble

307
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,000
following all of this stuff!

308
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:22,750
Grand Minister, there is one
detail I wish to clarify.

309
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,000
By all means, please
tell me what it is.

310
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:28,375
When you say the defeated
universes will be eliminated,

311
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,666
does that apply to
all of the universes

312
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,791
that are defeated
in the Tournament?

313
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:33,791
[GRAND MINISTER]
Yes.

314
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,708
Although, I should point out

315
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,583
that the First and
Twelfth Universes,

316
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,166
as well as the Fifth
and the Eighth,

317
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,333
are exempt from participating
in this particular tournament.

318
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,791
Those four universes have
average mortal levels

319
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,166
of seven or higher,

320
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,333
so they will be spared that
particular consequence.

321
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:50,666
Interesting.

322
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,125
So what you're saying
is, essentially,

323
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,708
the true purpose of
this tournament

324
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,750
is to take a
lower-level universe,

325
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:59,791
one which was already on the
Omni-King's chopping block,

326
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,458
and if it should
prove victorious,

327
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,125
granting it a reprieve?

328
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,750
[GRAND MINISTER] Yes, that's
pretty much the gist of it.

329
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,291
I see.

330
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,375
I can't wait for the actual
Tournament of Power to begin!

331
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,791
Oh yeah, I'm excited
for it, too!

332
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,750
Yeah, sorry, but I'm
still not gettin' it.

333
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,708
What's this guy yammerin'
on about here?

334
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:16,833
[SUPREME KAI]
If we lose,

335
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,375
our entire universe
will be wiped out.

336
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,791
Huh? So wait, what
you're sayin' is...?

337
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:23,916
All of us, along with our
universe, will cease to exist.

338
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,041
[yelps]

339
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,541
What's wrong, Mr Satan?

340
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:31,166
This is all your fault!

341
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,541
You're the one who foolishly
believed that if a mortal world

342
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,541
didn't reach a higher
level all on their own,

343
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:36,916
it wouldn't mean anything,

344
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,875
so you refused to lift a single
finger to help them!

345
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,416
What about you?

346
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,583
What have you done besides spend
most of your time sleeping?

347
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:45,875
If that's all, we should move
on to the third match now.

348
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:48,541
[ELDER KAI] Uh, just a minute
there, Grand Minister.

349
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:51,625
In the event of a defeat for
our universe in the tournament,

350
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,458
what happens to us deities?

351
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,208
[GRAND MINISTER] Why,
you'll all be done away with

352
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,458
at the same time.

353
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:59,666
Except for the
Angels, naturally.

354
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,541
Whis? Now what the hell
makes you so special?

355
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,375
[WHIS chuckles]

356
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:07,750
Well, Lord Beerus, my position
is different from yours.

357
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,083
Vados! You're safe, too?

358
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:13,375
And that concludes our
information session.

359
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,875
Moving on, the
Expo's third match

360
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,500
will sadly be its final one.

361
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,750
All right! It's my turn now!

362
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,083
[GOHAN]
Hey, Dad.

363
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:27,916
Good luck out there, okay?

364
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,208
Thanks!

365
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,500
[NARRATOR]
What sort of powers

366
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:37,166
does the Ninth Universe's
fighter Bergamo possess?

367
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,833
And what does he have
in store for Goku?

368
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:44,375
With the threat of universal
destruction looming over them,

369
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:50,208
the final match of the Zeno
Expo is about to get underway.

370
00:21:57,375 --> 00:22:00,208
<i>An angel and a demon sit</i>

371
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:03,333
<i>One to my right,</i>
<i>one to my left</i>

372
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:09,416
<i>In between I'm tryin'</i>
<i>to figure out the right way</i>

373
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,333
<i>Is one way good?</i>
<i>Is one way bad?</i>

374
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:15,500
<i>Too much confusion in my head</i>

375
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:20,875
<i>I can't think with all</i>
<i>this noise, I'm goin' crazy</i>

376
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:24,916
<i>Is there any way to know</i>
<i>what's right or wrong?</i>

377
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:29,791
<i>Demons in an angel mask</i>

378
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:32,958
<i>Hopin' that I'll do</i>
<i>just what they ask</i>

379
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:36,041
<i>Telling me</i>
<i>they know what's right</i>

380
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:39,000
<i>Lead me to the light</i>

381
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:41,958
<i>"For the sake of everyone</i>

382
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:44,958
<i>You have to destroy</i>
<i>the evil ones</i>

383
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:47,958
<i>That's the only path, you see"</i>

384
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:51,583
<i>So they said to me</i>

385
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:02,041
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

386
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:04,333
We're entering the last
round of the Zeno Expo,

387
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:06,125
and finally it's my turn!

388
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:09,083
My opponent is the Ninth
Universe's strongest warrior,

389
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:10,958
Bergamo the Crusher.

390
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:13,375
Hey, man, let's enjoy
ourselves here,

391
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,041
pushing past our limits
and making this

392
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:17,041
a battle to remember!

393
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:19,291
Next time, on Dragon Ball Super:

394
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:21,583
"Bergamo the Crusher vs. Goku!

395
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:24,250
Whose Strength Reaches
the Wild Blue Yonder?"

396
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:26,416
Make sure you don't
miss it, okay?
