It's so touching
to see children grow,

He possesses
considerable strength.

Yet if you watch him
closely, you'll notice

his attacks are
deliberately non-lethal.

why would we funnel them

help each other out?

No, I have a strategy

<i>Shining Star</i>


479
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:27,208
<i>In the night be</i>
<i>my compass and guide</i>


480
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:30,458
<i>Take me to where I belong</i>


481
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:33,625
<i>The warmth we once shared</i>
<i>Will always be there</i>


482
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:36,250
<i>Its magic lives on in our hearts</i>


483
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:37,416
<i>Shining Star</i>


484
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,208
<i>Give me strength</i>
<i>from your light up above</i>


485
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:43,208
<i>Show me the way to be brave</i>


486
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:49,458
<i>My hands still hold onto hope</i>
<i>that together we'll manifest</i>


487
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:54,333
<i>All that we dreamed of</i>

[GOHAN]
Gohan here.

489
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:03,750
We were making quick work
of Frieza's other soldiers,

490
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:05,750
but Tagoma's
in a different class.

491
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:08,208
With my dad and Vegeta
in some strange realm,

492
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:09,583
we've got to hang in there,

493
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:11,875
but this guy might even
be stronger than me.

494
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:14,833
Hold on-- now he's acting
like a different person.

495
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:16,750
There's something crazy
going on here.

496
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:19,208
[GOKU] Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

497
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:23,958
"Change! An Unexpected Return!
His Name Is Ginyu!!"

498
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:26,416
Make sure you don't
miss it, okay?
