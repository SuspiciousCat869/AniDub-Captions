Something would be wrong
if he didn't fear Grand Zeno.

00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:54,041
The Omni-King is the most
supreme of all deities,

ruling over
our entire multiverse.

224
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:59,125
In the hierarchy of the gods,
there is no one above him.

225
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,625
Does that mean he's
the strongest fighter

226
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,041
out of anyone anywhere?

227
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,375
You know, you Saiyans
have a terrible habit

228
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:08,166
of judging a being's power by
his physical capabilities alone.

229
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,833
Grand Zeno
is not a fighter, Goku.

230
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:14,041
But without a doubt
he is the mightiest.

You simply couldn't
fathom his power.

What does that mean?

00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,958
Are you telling me
that you've already

234

forgotten about
my lord's warning?

235
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,625
Grand Zeno can annihilate
anything he wishes

regardless of scale

Or an entire universe.

240
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:37,041
If it ever struck his fancy,
he could eliminate everything.

00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:44,166
I mean, instantly destroy
an entire universe?

245
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,791
Oh, yes. The fact is
we used to have

246
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:49,250
18 universes
instead of only 12.

247

That's completely insane!

248
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,416
So he just wiped out
the other six?

249
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,375
It doesn't take much
to provoke him, either.

and next thing you know...

00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:04,583
why we were so nervous when
you were talking to him, Goku.

the tournament
