Martial artistry

and expect mere strength
to ensure victory.

One must constantly measure
one's reach against opponents,

how they move in battle,

Aw, yeah! Ya like that?

320
00:15:26,499 --> 00:15:29,127
When I first met you,
I never expected your power

321
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,379
would climb this high, Caulifla.

322
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:34,007
I'm starting to think
you can reach Three now.

323
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:36,051
Maybe even beyond.

324
00:15:36,134 --> 00:15:38,845
So, how 'bout you, Kale?
Are you game?

325
00:15:38,928 --> 00:15:40,430
Uh! Honestly?

326
00:15:40,513 --> 00:15:44,934
Yeah, let's go!
We can get to Three together!

327
00:15:45,018 --> 00:15:45,935
Right!

[BEERUS]
That brainless fool!

329
00:15:47,896 --> 00:15:50,523
Now he's inviting <i>her</i>
to fight against him too?

330
00:15:50,607 --> 00:15:52,567
All right! This is perfect!

331
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:56,529
They'll be an unstoppable force!
Together they'll win for sure!

332
00:15:56,613 --> 00:16:00,533
Do it Kale and Caulifla,
knock him into next week!

333
00:16:03,161 --> 00:16:06,081
All right, you can come
at me any way you want.

334
00:16:06,164 --> 00:16:08,208
[CAULIFLA] Heh. You don't need
to hold back your power

335
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:10,835
for my sake. Give him
everything you've got!

336
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:12,003
You bet!

337
00:16:12,087 --> 00:16:14,297
[KALE] Finally, we get
to fight together.

338
00:16:14,381 --> 00:16:17,342
Caulifla and me,
standing as a team.

[KALE]
Hmph.

360
00:17:12,022 --> 00:17:13,565
[CAULIFLA] I've always
liked fighting alone,

but I gotta say, this teamwork
thing ain't half bad, either.

Heh.

I fear Goku is overwhelmed.

364
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:23,033
Fending off two Saiyans
at once is too much,

365
00:17:23,116 --> 00:17:25,076
especially without
all of his power.

366
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,621
Maybe. But you should
know by now, sir,

367
00:17:28,705 --> 00:17:31,666
Goku's always made himself
stronger by pushing himself

368
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:36,421
right to the limit. That's
just the kinda guy he is.

There's no way!

What do you mean?
"Is he doing" what?

You know. That thing he
was doing against Jiren.

Which thing, Roshi?

I can assure you it is not.

[BEERUS]
Huh?

391
00:18:35,146 --> 00:18:37,357
Autonomous Ultra Instinct
is a martial mastery

392
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,735
that's hard for even Destroyers
to reliably achieve.

393
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:44,155
As adept as Goku is in battle,
it would be impossible for him

As the battle between three

it appears Kale's desire

to prove herself
worthy to Caulifla

445

has once again pushed her
to a level she cannot control.
