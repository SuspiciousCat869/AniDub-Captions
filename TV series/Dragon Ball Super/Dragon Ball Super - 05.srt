[NARRATOR] Previously,
on Dragon Ball Super,

3
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,500
a fearsome deity,
known as Lord Beerus,

4
00:01:57,583 --> 00:01:59,916
awoke after a nap
of thirty-nine years.

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,541
He had dreamt of a warrior who
could rival him in battle,

6
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:05,166
and his Oracle Fish
confirmed the rival's name:

7
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,791
a Super Saiyan God.

8
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:08,458
With the help
of his servant Whis,

9
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:11,333
Beerus has learned about Goku,
and hopes the powerful Saiyan

10
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:14,625
can help him find
the so-called Saiyan God.

11

Meanwhile, Bulma's birthday
party has kicked off on Earth,

Aaah.

Wow, so that's
Beerus the Destroyer, huh?

22
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,083
He definitely looks strong.

23

But it's weird,
I can't sense any energy.

24
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:01,291
Without my eyes, I wouldn't
even know he was here!

Ah man, this is so cool.
I'm really excited!

26
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:05,625
Keep your voice down, Goku!

27
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,458
You're not supposed
to let him find you!

Oh, Lord Beerus,
what a pleasant surprise.

00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,791
Welcome to my humble abode.

I appreciate you coming
all this way to see me.

Uh, you look well.

32
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:19,166
It's been quite a long time,
hasn't it, North Kai?

How many years

Oh, uh, let's see here.

Three hundred twenty-seven
Universal Standard years.

Oh! I was counting to the
exact month and day, Lord,

40

but if you're fine with
rounding, yeah, 327.

I'm sure.

43
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:45,208
King Kai looks so nervous;
he's shaking like a leaf.

44
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,000
It's like he's
terrified of the guy.

Is Beerus really
all that strong?

If ignorance is bliss,
then you've got it made.

47
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,083
You know, I'd forgotten

48
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,583
just how tiny
this planet is now.

49

[KING KAI] Well, I like to call
it cozy--and easy to clean--

but--but of course
you're right, lord.

51

Please excuse the
cramped accommodations.

52
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:05,333
But I definitely
want to make you comfy.

Can I offer you
something to eat or drink?

54
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:10,333
Perhaps.
Is it something good?

[KING KAI]
Oh, absolutely!

56

Nothin' but the most delicious
for us deities, right?

57

[GOKU] Something delicious?
Where's he's been hiding it?

If I'd known that then I
would've eaten it already.

59
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,250
Intriguing.
Though you'd better hope

60
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,250
you're not overselling it,
North Kai.

61
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:26,041
Or this time I'll make
your world even smaller.

62
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,958
Maybe the size of that shed.

00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,250
Eeeh! Bubbles,
what are you waiting for?

On the top shelf,
next to the brownies I made!

66
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,625
But on second thought,
I'll decline.

67
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,791
I did just stuff myself
on the way here.

Oh, okay, no problem.
Maybe just a snack then?

shaped like planets!

I don't want anything, Kai.

Don't make me say it again.

75
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:59,708
Or I will destroy
what's left of this world.

Ah! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Please forgive me!

I thought everyone
liked crackers!

You can save them
for another time.

[KING KAI]
Oh yeah, great idea!

If you didn't come for

81

the culinary tourism,
Lord Beerus,

82
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,083
then what is the reason
for your visit?

83
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,833
Well. There's a small matter
I'd like to discuss

you're harboring.

Oh, where are my manners?

introduced you to him.

in a mountain hut?

Stop being rude and come
say hello to Lord Beerus!

92
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,166
Now he wants me to come out?

93
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,666
Can you please just
pretend that you're polite?

I had a feeling
you were going to say that!

98
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,416
You're old enough to know
how to offer a proper greeting

99

I'm Go--I mean.
My name is Goku, sir!

And it is an honor
for you to meet me! Sir!

Okay, if you say so.

Now that that's
out of the way,

there's something I was
hoping to ask you about--

Let's see, uh... Super...

Super Saiyan God, my lord.
Shall I write it down?

110
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,458
Yes, yes, I knew that.

111
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,000
So what can you tell me
about the existence

112
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,291
of this Super Saiyan God?

113
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,875
Super Saiyan God,
let me think.

114
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:30,083
I mean I know all about
regular Super Saiyan, sure.

115
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,625
But that's a "no"
on the God stuff, buddy.

Ah! I know not of it, sir!

118
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,083
[KING KAI] I can't say I've
heard of it either, Lord Beerus.

119
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,541
It sounds like
a dead end you probably

120
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,125
shouldn't worry about anymore.

121

00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,041
Well that's too bad.

123
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,500
But my servant Whis,
here, tells me

124
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,875
you defeated that bastard
Frieza in battle.

125
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:52,541
Uh. Oh yeah, I kicked
his butt a long time ago!

126
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,833
I mean-- Yes, lord.

127
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:58,958
[BEERUS]
Mm. Mm? Mmm mm-mmm.

128
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,208
No. It doesn't seem possible

129
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,375
that you could defeat him
as you are now.

130
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:06,375
But I understand you're
capable of transformation.

131
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:09,375
Becoming a "Super Saiyan,"
as you call it?

132
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:10,916
Yes, that's right.

133
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,500
It's an interesting power-up,
though not that interesting.

134
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:14,791
For someone of your caliber,

135
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,500
it'd be more like
a trick you do at parties.

136
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:19,708
[BEERUS]
Then <i>not</i> a Super Saiyan God.

137
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,041
See, my lord,
it's as I suspected.

138
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,541
This wasn't a true premonition,
it was just a dream;

139
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,583
the random thoughts
of a sleeping mind.

140
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,000
That makes a lot more sense
than a mysterious warrior

141
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,583
no one's heard of
who's somehow capable

142
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:34,958
of matching your power.

143
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:38,083
[BEERUS]
Hmmm.

144
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,166
Possibly. Except I'm not
the only one who dreamed it.

145
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,458
The Oracle Fish saw it as well.

146
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,833
Let's ask Prince Vegeta
what he knows.

147
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:48,833
Planet Earth should be
relatively close to here, right?

148
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,166
[KING KAI]
Planet Earth?

149
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,000
Are you sure you're up
for more traveling?

150
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,791
It takes at least
three minutes to get there.

151
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,416
Just three minutes?
Why would I care about that?

152
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,083
It sounds like you don't
want me to go, Whis.

153
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:02,000
Is this going to be an issue?

154
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,375
Hm.

155
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:06,250
Not at all, my lord.
We'll go wherever you like.

156
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,833
Uh, about that.

157
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:10,291
You're not planning to destroy
the earth or anything are you?

158
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,833
Not so long as
nothing there annoys me.

159
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:15,833
[BEERUS]
Come on, Whis. Let's go.

160
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,416
As you wish, Lord Beerus.

161
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,875
Hey listen, you're
supposed to-- Sorry.

162
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,375
I mean, Lord Beerus sir,

163
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,916
I have heard that your lordship
is incredibly strong.

164
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,958
How 'bout showing me
a teensy bit of your strength

165
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:27,708
so I can know if that's true?

166
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,083
Goku!

167
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,458
How could he ask that?

168
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:33,208
So you want me
to demonstrate my power?

169
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:34,625
In what way?

170
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:37,166
Nothing big. We could go
toe to toe in a sparring match,

171
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,541
even if only for a minute!

172
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,916
That's enough out of you.
Let the adults talk.

173
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,708
I'm sorry, Lord Beerus,
I'm still civilizing him.

174
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,625
He's sort of like a puppy
you to try to housetrain

175
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,833
but he keeps soiling all
the carpets, and the walls,

176
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,833
and the furniture,
and the ceiling, and...

177
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,916
I've lived hundreds
of millions of years.

178
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,083
Yet never in my existence
have I been issued

179
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,416
a challenge such as yours, Goku.

180
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,958
You must be strong indeed to
have that degree of confidence.

181
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:03,333
Either that, or you're
just an arrogant fool.

182
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:05,208
Yes, that's it. He's a fool!

183
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,958
He's a big, dumb,
stupid fool. Just look at him!

184
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,166
[BEERUS]
Why not.

185
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,416
Go ahead and come at me
with all you've got.

186
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,583
[KING KAI]
What?

187
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,666
Oh sweet! Uh!

188
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,208
I mean, thank you
very much, Your Lordness.

189
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,416
Why don't you get
how stupid this is?

190
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,083
He's not a fighter
in a tournament!

191
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,458
Or even some alien
trying to conquer a galaxy.

192
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:27,000
Beerus is
a Destroyer deity, okay!

193
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,375
He's on a whole other level,

194
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,291
other than anyone
you've seen before!

195
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,791
He's got enough power
in one breath

196
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,708
to knock you to the other
end of the universe!

197
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:37,416
You're the dust in his nostril
when he blows his nose!

198
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:40,916
All the more
reason to fight him;

199
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,625
to see where I need to improve!
Aw man, this is gonna be great!

200
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,250
[KING KAI] I swear
you have brain damage!

201
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,208
I'm bored.
Are we doing this or not?

202
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,000
[GOKU] Yeah, yeah. We're
doing it, we're doing it!

203
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,791
Very well.
Whenever you're ready then.

204
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:54,041
Well I could try fighting
you in my normal state,

205
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:57,916
but that might be an insult to
your power, Your Destroyerness.

206
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,708
[grunts]

207
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,125
[BEERUS]
Huh.

208
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,625
This level is called
a Super Saiyan.

209
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,541
Interesting. So you relied
on this to combat Frieza.

210
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:12,666
And you do seem to have
powered up a little bit.

211
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,791
As I said, attack when you like.

212
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,833
Uh. I can't believe
this is happening.

213
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,583
Would you like to
share some of this lunch

214
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,375
while we wait?

215
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:22,916
Let's get one thing clear.

216
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,708
I don't want you holding
anything back in this battle

217
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,041
'cause I'm giving you
all I've got.

218
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,333
Yes, please do.

219
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,541
[yells]

220
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,208
[WHIS sighs]

221
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,125
[GOKU]
Come on!

222
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,416
He's evading Goku
like it's nothing!

223
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,625
[WHIS] Mm. It appears
there won't be enough time

224
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,250
for a proper lunch today.

225
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,708
[GOKU yells]

226
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,125
Damnit, I'm not even
laying a finger on this guy.

227
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:51,541
Yeah, I told you, dummy!

228
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,375
Now stop while you still can!

229
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,583
[yawns]

230
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,333
Goku!

231
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,541
[bellows]

232
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,208
[wails]

233
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,541
[panting]

234
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:14,375
You're a decent fighter
aren't you, Saiyan?

235
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,291
Now I see how
you could defeat Frieza

236
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:19,291
after reaching this level.
But even with this increase

237
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,416
you're only slightly
stronger than he was.

238
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,083
I bet you barely scraped by.

239
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,458
Ha! You don't
mince words, do you?

240
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,875
But I'm a lot tougher
than you think!

241
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,541
I was expecting
a good deal more from you.

242
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:35,041
What a disappointing trip.
You ready to go, Whis?

243
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,458
[WHIS]
Always, my lord.

244
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:39,583
No wait! This fight isn't
even close to finished!

245
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,291
[BEERUS]
Hmm?

246
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:46,708
[GOKU] Get a load of this!
It's called Super Saiyan Two!

247
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,541
Hey, can you please
stop now while we still exist?

248
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,750
Please!

249
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,291
Oh? You found another level?

250
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,458
Seems you're more clever
than I thought.

251
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:58,041
Maybe this has something to do
with the Super Saiyan God

252
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,041
and it's not
a wasted trip after all.

253
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,833
Super Saiyan Two,
how fascinating.

254
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,208
Hmm.

255
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,708
No, I still don't
think there's time.

256
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,458
When I'm this level
you won't get off so easily.

257
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:12,166
[yells]

258
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:16,125
[BEERUS] Oh. So that's
all he has to offer.

259
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,791
[KING KAI cries out nervously]

260
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:28,541
Aw, not this wall, too!

261
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:29,583
Time out!

262
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,000
--[BEERUS] Hm?
--[WHIS] Huh.

263
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,791
Look, Lord Beerus. You're
clearly great at dodging,

264
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,041
but could you fight back
a little, too?

265
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:38,458
I mean how can I appreciate
how strong you really are

266
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,375
if all you do
is get out of the way?

267
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,083
Shut up!

268
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,458
Very well.

269
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:44,833
[KING KAI gasps]

270
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,583
But only if you can
show me you have enough power

271
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,833
to make even my
slightest effort worthwhile.

272
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,500
--Oh yeah?
--Yeah.

273
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,583
All right,
if it's proof you want...

274
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,958
...then proof you'll get!

275
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:57,958
[GOKU]
Damn it, there's no point.

276
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,958
His guard's completely up!
Gotta change that!

277
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,458
[yells]

278
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:10,000
No one can blame me
for what happens now.

279
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,125
Aw, come on!

280
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,166
Even after powering up
to Super Saiyan Two

281
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,916
I can't land a single blow.

282
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,375
You're amazing, Lord Beerus.
On a whole other level.

283
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,125
[KING KAI]
I literally said that!

284
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:34,583
[bellows]

285
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:41,083
[panting]

286
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,583
Are you finished yet?

287
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:45,666
I won't fight back if this
is the best that you can do.

288
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,125
[GOKU]
Uh?

289
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,750
Of course,
you haven't fooled me.

290
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:53,083
I can sense there's still more
your body is capable of.

291
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,166
So stop holding it back.

292
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,041
Show me your all
if you want any hope

293
00:13:57,125 --> 00:14:00,333
of witnessing
a Destroyer's power.

294
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,208
Well when you put it like that
I guess I don't have

295
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:05,916
any other choice.
Just remember you asked for it!

296
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,416
Goku!

297
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:17,458

[bellows]

301
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:48,541
[GOKU] This is it, Beerus.
This is Super Saiyan Three!

302
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:08,000
[KING KAI]
Aah! Run for cover!

Bubbles, help.

305
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:16,333
Aah. Super Saiyan Three.

306
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,125
Seems you've been
working hard over the years.

307
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,750
Compared to
your previous forms,

308
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:24,291
the increase in power
is indeed considerable.

309
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:28,000
Perhaps you're not the total
imbecile I took you for.

310
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,541
This third level really does
seem to be different.

311
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,333
Guess I am eating, then.

312
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,666
All right, Beerus,

I know it's enough

Rather impressive, Saiyan.

The truth is that you finally
convinced me to attack you,

in that moment.

that this fight would be over.

still catching up.

you're keeping from me?

actually challenge my power?

is that it?

after I went Super Saiyan Three.

my earlier attacks on purpose,

for a challenge, so do not
engage him in any way.

blow up the earth?

like, repeatedly?

The only way I could
boost my strength quickly

429
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,875
would be to maybe fuse
with Vegeta again, right?

that would do the trick.

Is that a level I could reach
if I train hard enough?

even know existed?

00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:09,833
They don't realize
how dangerous he is!

470
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:11,333
Vegeta, we're counting
on you now!

471
00:23:11,416 --> 00:23:13,333
No pressure or anything,
but keeping the earth

472
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:15,583
from getting destroyed
is totally up to you.

473
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:17,666
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

474
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,375
"Don't Anger the Destroyer!

475
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:21,208
A Heart-Pounding
Birthday Party."

476
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:22,458
Come on, King Kai.

477
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:24,666
Are you sure I shouldn't
go down there, too?
