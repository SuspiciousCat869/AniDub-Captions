Oh, I hear you loud and clear.

Ah, very good. Now take this.

162
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,375
I'm sharing with you some
Energy of Destruction.

163
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,916
[SIDRA] Nobody who's been hit
with this energy can escape

164
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,250
its devastating toll,
no matter who they are.

165

They won't even pass
to Other World.

will be eliminated.

Despite being so
woefully outmatched,

00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:12,000
there was a reason why
your poor comrades' eyes

were not completely glazed
over with despair.

00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,916
It was because of the energy
you hold in your paw, yes?

[FRIEZA] Heh! That was
a halfway decent plan.

00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,833
For a simpleton
like you, that is.

And now it's my turn to

The true extent of my strength.

What? No, impossible!

That's Lord Sidra's Energy
of Destruction! You can't--

Whoa. Awesome.

205
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,458
[GOKU] Man, I'm surprised you
made it outta that thing.

206
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:50,750
Impressive.

207
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:53,916
[FRIEZA] Oh, that was merely
a warmup exercise.

208
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,333
For someone who's been
bound up in a cocoon,

209
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,291
your power level sure has risen.

210
00:10:58,375 --> 00:10:59,458
[FRIEZA]
Hm...

211
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:01,333
So what is that thing anyway?

212
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,958
Yes, that's a very
good question.

213
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,500
I'm sensing some major
power coming off of it.

214
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,500
Indeed, and for energy
to be as pure

215
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,333
as this particular
little bundle here,

216
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,791
I believe it's most likely
of divine origin.

217
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,208
But that would mean...

218
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,916
This anemic battalion's
pathetic attempt at an ambush

219
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,791
must've been orchestrated
from on high

220
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,500
by either the Supreme Kai

221
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,541
or Destroyer of one of
the other universes.

222
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,583
Then I guess their mission
was to assassinate

223
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,750
the both of us, huh, Frieza?

224
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:29,041
I've got no clue which
universe did this,

225
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:32,458
but whoever it was must
be awfully desperate.

[GOKU]
Listen up, guys!

227
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,041
We here in the Seventh
Universe don't run or hide,

228
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,791
and we don't back
down from a fight!

229
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,958
So go tell the gods back in your
universe that we'll settle this,

230
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,541
fair and square, in the
Tournament of Power!

I always have and always will.

For you to so incautiously turn
your back on me like that

will never learn.

Though, for the moment,
perhaps you ought to concentrate

258
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,250
on escaping from
that crushing energy

and as swiftly as your crude
little body will allow.

will be evidence
enough, don't you?

[ROH growls]

If they abused it,
that's not my fault!

us in won't work!

00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,416
It's nothing too difficult,
I assure you.

320
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,041
All I want is for
you to appoint me

321
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,875
as one of the warriors
for Universe Nine.

322
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:28,916
Wha...?!

323
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,375
[FRIEZA]
You see, I've ensnared Goku

324
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:33,291
in your Energy of Destruction.

325
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,791
And as much as it pains me
to give the simple simian

326
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,583
any bit of credit,
the Seventh Universe

327
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:40,750
will never win the Tournament of
Power without his assistance.

328
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:43,000
This universe will
be eradicated.

329
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,708
And I find that outcome
less than ideal.

330
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,333
[RO, SIDRA grunt]

331
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:50,291
Surely by now you appreciate
the magnitude of my strength

332
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,791
and the talents I have to offer.

333
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,916
If you'd be so kind as
to put me on your team

334
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,541
and fully restore my life,

335
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,291
I will vow to give you
everything I have

336
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:00,125
in pursuit of achieving victory
for you in the Tournament.

337
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,750
So, what do you say?

338
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,333
It's not an egregious
proposal, is it?

339
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:07,500
Yeah, but, be honest.
Are you sure about this?

340
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,375
And why wouldn't I be sure?

341
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:12,625
Because if you do this, your own
universe will be annihilated!

342
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:13,791
I'm aware.

343
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,750
I don't care how callous
and evil you are,

344
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,458
there still has to be something
there that you wish to preserve.

345
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,041
Loved ones, memories.

346
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,083
Every creature has to
care about something!

347
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:23,333
You confound me.

348
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,875
I have no desire at all
to preserve anything.

349
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,541
Ha! Other than myself,
of course.

350
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,250
[BOTH gasping]

351
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,583
Hang on, are we even allowed
to recruit someone

352
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:36,666
from another universe
to be one of our fighters?

353
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,583
Well, I don't see anything
in the rulebook

354
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:39,958
specifically prohibiting it.

355
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,750
All right, then let's
just do it already!

356
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:45,291
Wait, no! Our universe may
have a well-earned reputation

357
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:48,375
for depravity, but that lunatic
is too much, even for us!

358
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,750
He's a psychopath who thinks
nothing of his universe

359
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,750
being annihilated!
You heard him!

360
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:55,666
Sidra, he's even more of
a Destroyer than you!

361
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,000
Then we'll be the strongest
team there, right?!

362
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,916
[ROH] A double-crosser will
always double-cross again!

363
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,083
[SIDRA]
Duh, I know that!

364
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,791
But when he does,
I'll just destroy him!

365
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,416
That's kind of my
thing, you know!

366
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,833
[ROH] Oh, please. There's no
way it'll go that smoothly!

367
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,625
Oh, drat, out of time.

368
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:13,083
Well, so much for that idea.

369
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,500
[BOTH gasp]

370
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,583
[GOKU groaning]

371
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:20,333
Oh for goodness' sake...
How did this happen?

372
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,291
[inhales]

373
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,458
[panting]

374
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,625
Ah. Thanks, you saved me.

375
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,625
I was starting to
wonder what nonsense

376
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:37,125
you'd gotten yourself into,
so I came to check.

377
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,750
As for you, that was
Energy of Destruction.

378
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,833
You'd better have
a good explanation.

379
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:44,041
Who me? I was attacked
with it, as well.

380
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:47,083
Though I didn't struggle
with it nearly as clumsily.

381
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,750
Don't try to play me.

382
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:51,666
You were just in contact with
one of the other universes,

383
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,291
weren't you? If you're
plotting something...

384
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:55,875
Hold on, we need Frieza!

385
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,583
It was my fault for
letting my guard down!

386
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,000
It's hard to know, my lord.

387
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,666
Perhaps he called up their
assailants to acquire some

388
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,000
information that could
assist us in some way.

389
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,583
[FRIEZA]
Yes. Perhaps so.

390
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,166
What's wrong with you, Goku?

391
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,375
Doesn't this infuriate
you even a little?

392
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:11,958
Well of course it does!

393
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,166
It's just, I feel I'm
at least partly to blame

394
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,291
for forgetting Frieza's
such a terrible, sneaky,

395
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,041
rotten, no-good, evil bastard.

396
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,958
I'd say that's putting
it mildly at this point.

397
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,875
[FRIEZA]
This fiasco confirms it.

398
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,083
This upcoming tournament,

399
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,875
with the fate of
the universe at stake

400
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,000
is the perfect opportunity
for me to manipulate

401
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,291
even the all-powerful gods.

402
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:33,958
In the end, I'll be
the one who laughs last.

403
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:37,166
You don't get to have everything
go your way forever...

404
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,916
...Beerus.

405
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,166
I know!

406
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,500
Hey, listen, Whis.

407
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,000
What is it?

408
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,416
Can you give me and Frieza
just one minute for something?

409
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,291
Huh?!

410
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:50,000
[WHIS] When I give the signal,
the skirmish may begin.

411
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,666
However, as soon as either
of you lands the first blow

412
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,291
the match will immediately
come to an end--

413
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,125
with no hard feelings.

414
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,166
Are these terms
agreeable to you both?

415
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,208
Hurry up and get it
over with already!

416
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,916
All right, Frieza, if I win
this, you've gotta forget about

417
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,375
whatever beef there
is between us

418
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,333
and promise to stay
loyal to our universe

419
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,250
throughout the Tournament
of Power, okay?

420
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,833
That's cute, but when I win,

421
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,958
you will agree to leave me
alone to do as I please.

422
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,375
[FRIEZA]
The mental control I honed

423
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:15,958
whilst imprisoned
took great effort.

424
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:18,291
And you didn't ask how I did it.

425
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,500
It wasn't as simple as
casting out bad thoughts

426
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,125
and clearing the mind.

427
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,208
I focused on nothing
but an endless series

428
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:28,500
of combat simulations in which I
killed you over and over again.

429
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:33,041
[FRIEZA chuckles]
I can visualize it all!

430
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:36,541
Your every move!
My inevitable victory!

431
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,041
I see the whole fight play out

432
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,791
with perfect clarity
and precision!

433

[whistle blows]

435
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,458
Will we ever really be able to
trust him, even if Goku wins?

436
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:53,833
I would say that's highly
doubtful, my lord.

While you were sittin' around,

446
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,833
twiddling your thumbs in Hell,
I was busy sparring with

447
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,958
the toughest fighters
from other universes.

448
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,875
So you're not the only one
who's been getting stronger.

you try to kill someone

who's no real threat,
I'm gonna make you regret it!

[FRIEZA] I refuse to take orders
from a primate like you.

This isn't over between us.
Not by a long shot.

[GOKU]
Oh yeah. I know.

455
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,791
The two of them appear
to be evenly matched now.

456
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:59,875
Yes, I must say that Lord Frieza
is rather impressive, isn't he?

457
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,083
[NARRATOR]
With the treacherous Frieza

458
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:06,541
filling the missing position,
the Seventh Universe team

459
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:10,708
is now complete,
and not a moment too soon.

460
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:13,625
As the eight competing
universes finalize

461
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,916
their strategies
and preparations,

462
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,708
the Tournament of Power,
which will determine

463
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:24,250
each of their fates,
is set to begin at last.

464
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:27,333
Do Goku and the rest of
the Seventh Universe fighters

465
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:31,625
have what it takes to evade
the threat of annihilation?

00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:24,583
<i>(Boogie Back!)</i>

475
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:27,208
<i>My heartbeat</i>
<i>keeps growing faster</i>

476
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:30,958
<i>Every step that I take</i>

<i>(Boogie Back!)</i>

00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:34,625
<i>Give me happy ever after</i>

479
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:39,458
<i>Let the dream</i>

480
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:41,333

[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

485
00:22:56,791 --> 00:22:59,833
Finally, after all that buildup,
the tournament's about to start!

486
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:01,375
What incredible energy!

487
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:03,208
Is that Top's friend Jiren?

488
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:06,083
Huh, everybody here seems
to have brought their A-game,

489
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:08,583
so I'm gonna have to bust out
my full power to show 'em

490
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:10,708
what's up! Took a
while to get here,

491
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:13,791
but now it's the Seventh
Universe's time to shine!

492
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:15,916
Next time, on Dragon Ball Super:

493
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,375
"The Time Has Come!

494
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:20,125
To the Null Realm with the
Universes on the Line!"

495
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:22,041
Make sure you
don't miss it, okay?
