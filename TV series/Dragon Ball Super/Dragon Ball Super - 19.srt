be a significant weakness.

Indeed. When Earth's
guardian was replaced,

my powers were altered as well.

Today I have the ability
to grant you three.

But there are limits.

If the wish
requires great power,

such as bringing back
a planet's population,

wish for then?

--[TAGOMA] Commander, wait!
--[SORBET] Huh?

320
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,208
There's no time for that.
The Saiyans may know

321
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,958
we're here.
We have to move quickly!

322

--[pattering]
--[SORBET] Hm?

323
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,708
Look at him go.
This is Lord Frieza, after all.

324
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,166
And with his strength
and our tech,

325
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,291
I'm positive we can
put him back in one piece!

All right, let's move out.

[PILAF, MAI, SHOU]
Excuse us.

330
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,666
[SORBET]
What do you want?

331
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,333
[PILAF] I think
you missed a piece.

332
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,333
[GINYU FROG groans]

[SORBET] Hmm.
Good work, Earthlings.

336
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:28,500
We'll remember you when
we come back to this planet.

337
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,416
But next time
we'll have Lord Frieza

338
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,500
and our soldiers, too.

339
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,833
I'm still confused.

340
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:49,250
Who's Frieza, and why doesn't
he come pre-assembled?

341
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,583
How should I know?

342
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,208
Whoever he is,
it doesn't sound like

343
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,541
it's very good for the earth.

344
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:55,916
I know!

345
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,250
We'll build a spaceship
to escape to another planet

346
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,833
and build my empire there!

347
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,166
Sire, I don't think
high-tech spaceship building

348
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,541
is our specialty.

349
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:04,958
[PILAF] I know we can
figure out something

350
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,708
with that million zeni
you got us!

351
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,500
Way to think on your
feet there, Shou!

352
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:09,916
But sir!
He should have asked for

353
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,583
a hundred million zeni.
That would've been

354
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:12,833
a hundred times better!

355
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,375
And this coming
from the mastermind

356
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:15,666
who wished for some ice cream?

357
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,750
At least my wish
isn't gonna melt!

358
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,541
I couldn't help it.
You know how long it's been

359
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,458
since I've had some?
It's inhumane!

360
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,500
[PILAF]
Would you morons shut up?

361
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:26,000
I just realized
something terrible.

362
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:29,416
I'm the only one
who didn't get his own wish.

363
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,333
That's okay, sire.

364
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:34,541
With all this money you can
pay to eat anything you want,

365
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,875
and that's kinda like
making a wish, right?

366
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,500
Yeah, sir, and don't
forget you're gonna have

367
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:41,083
the world's
best ice cream, too!

368
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,541
You're right. That is good!

369
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,333
Okay, soldiers!
First we'll make ourselves

370
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,333
totally sick on ice cream
and then we'll rally

--[SHOU, MAI] Right!

--[MAI] Ooh, yeah!
--[SHOU] Good idea!

376
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,208
It's gone now. I wonder
what that was about.

377
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:59,166
I think we're in trouble.

the Saiyans could react.

381

[SORBET] See, you were
fussing over nothing.

382
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,416
I told you it was
a brilliant plan.

383
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,708
To be honest,
I still have some concerns.

384
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,208
About what?

385
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,125
I still question if
reviving Lord Frieza

386
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,625
is the best way to return our
force to its former glory.

387
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,125
What?! Augh!

388
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,625
You're seriously
still doubting that?

389
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,208
Just think about
what happened!

390
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,750
The moment that
word spread that Frieza

391
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,750
and his top lieutenants
had been wiped out,

392
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,083
the universe stopped
taking us seriously!

393
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,208
That's when the first
planets rebelled!

394
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,708
And that's when
the struggles for power

395
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:38,791
among our own
leadership started, too.

396
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:42,083
Maybe it's too hard for me
to imagine his true power.

397
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:45,083
I barely saw Frieza back then
and only from afar.

398
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:48,333
He always seemed so small
and insignificant.

399
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,916
Hmm. I only met him
a few times myself,

400
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,458
but trust me it was enough.

401
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,791
I've never encountered
a more terrifying presence.

402
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,291
Well, I hope you're right.

403
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,708
If he's not
as strong as you say,

404
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,166
we'll be bringing back
an old dictator

405
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,750
