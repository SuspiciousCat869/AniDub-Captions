I'd like to get on with it,
if you don't mind.

Honestly. I'd really hate
for destruction to serve

some kind of a purpose.
It makes it so much less pure.

But if it's the only way

But of course they are,

What's more important:
one backwater world

or a battle of gods?

It's not even a question.

You won't be able to
deflect or crush this one,

so you'd better start
taking this seriously.
