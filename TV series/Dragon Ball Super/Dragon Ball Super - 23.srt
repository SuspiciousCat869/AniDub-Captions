No, it's just like I thought.

162
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,333
I can't lock on to anyone's
energy from here.

163
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:36,666
It's too faint.

164
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,041
[grunts] This is no time
for your excuses!

165
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,458
You need to concentrate harder

166
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,916
or our families
are going to die!

167
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,375
Thirty-five more minutes?

168
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:49,333
I'm not sure we can last three
more minutes like this!

169
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,791
Evidently Goku is going
to arrive at the party

170
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,583
even later than I thought.

171
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,208
Then let's make the most of it!

172
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,541
I'll deal with his friends
while we wait!

173
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:00,833
[SORBET]
Ugh...

174
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,166
Yes, very well. I don't
mind waiting longer

175
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,083
now that I know for
certain he's coming.

176
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,833
And it gives us
plenty of time to prepare

177
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,875
a special welcoming for him.

178
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,708
We'll create a red carpet
for his arrival

179
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:13,166
with the blood of his friends.

180
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:25,375
Oh, I just remembered...
Gotta go!

181
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:28,125
Super important matter:
Galactic Patrol-ey stuff.

182
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:29,041
Good luck you guys.

183
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,833
Help, Jaco! What do we do?

184
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:33,041
Hey, easy on the neck!

185
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,291
[FRIEZA chuckles]

186
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,291
[GOHAN]
Not so fast.

187
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:40,041
I've been away from
training for too long.

188
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,333
I even lost my fighting <i>gi</i> .

189
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,041
I'm probably not
strong enough to stop you.

190
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,208
[GINYU]
Yeah, ya think?

191
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,875
Look at you, you've got
half a dozen holes

192
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,458
in your body already.
You can't do a thing!

193
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:53,125
[GOHAN] If I'd kept up
my training like my dad,

194
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,875
we wouldn't be in this
trouble, begging for time.

195
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,666
And Piccolo wouldn't be dead!

196
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,750
As if your weakness
wasn't pathetic enough,

197
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,708
you're going to
whine about it too?

198
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,583
None of this
is your fault, Gohan!

199
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,750
You stepped away from fighting
to be there for your family,

200
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,291
and there's nothing
shameful about that!

201
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,791
Take comfort,
my little primate.

202
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,791
I won't allow this family you
care so much about to suffer.

203
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,500
At least not for
very long, anyway.

204
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,958
I will rip the sinews of life
from their bones in an instant!

205
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,166
[GOHAN] It doesn't matter
what I think I can do.

206
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,958
Or even if it's possible.

207
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,083
I still have to
try to stop you.

208
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,250
With everything I've got!

209
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:38,875
[grunts, yells]

210
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:41,916
Oh. So, you do
have more in the tank.

211
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,500
Please don't do this, Gohan!

212
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,041
You're too hurt!
Just wait for Goku!

213
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:49,000
[bellows]

214
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,500
[BEERUS] That's a reckless
move for the half-Saiyan.

215
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,208
You think his body can bear it?

216
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:54,083
Hard to say.

217
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,666
It's now or never!

218
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,708
[bellows]

219
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,875
Your brother's
pushing himself too far!

220
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,291
Yeah, I know.

221
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:08,166
Stop, Gohan,
we'll find another way!

222
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,458
--[GOHAN bellows]

223
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:14,166
--[KRILLIN] Gohan!
--[GOHAN bellows]

224
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,583
How fascinating.

225
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:18,416
The young fool might literally
blow his own body apart.

226
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:27,375
[pants, bellows]

227
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:36,416
Hurry, give me your hand.

228
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,416
[grunts]
Just get it over with!

229
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,791
See you next time,
Lord Beerus!

230
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,833
We're outta here!

231
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,000
[FRIEZA chuckles]

232
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:57,750
[FRIEZA] Look at you.
Drained of every last drop.

233
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,125
And now that you're emptied,

234
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:01,875
it's time to
dispose of the vessel.

235
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:14,041
--[FRIEZA gasps]
--[GOHAN groans]

236
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:20,791
[snarls]

237
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:23,833
[chuckles] I won't let
a dismal sideshow

238
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,208
mar the joy
of the main event.

239
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:29,666
At last we meet again, Goku.

240
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,625
[laughs]

241
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,833
They made it!
This changes everything!

242
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:55,041
All right, Dad!

243
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,083
We've really got a shot
at winning this now!

244
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,083
Awesome!

245
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,291
And for the record!

246
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:02,750
I'm happy you're here Vegeta,

247
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:05,541
but I'm still angry
it took you so long!

248
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:06,833
Your husband
sure looks scary.

249
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,541
I can't imagine the pillow talk.

250
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:09,375
Hey!

251
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,333
[JACO rasps]
Aaah!

252
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:14,166
He's really here. I get it.

253
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,416
That's why Gohan
was powering-up.

254
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,041
[laughs]

255
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:20,250
[SORBET] You're sure
<i>that's</i> Goku, my lord?

256
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,875
I'm surprised he was
ever able to stop you.

257
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:27,333
[FRIEZA] Yes. That stupid face
is etched indelibly in my mind.

258
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:31,791
That's Goku, both my bane and
my muse for all I do now.

259
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,750
You did a great job, son.

260
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,041
Your power-up gave me
something to lock onto.

261
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,625
I'm here 'cause of you.

262
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,791
I'm sorry, Dad.
I should have done more

263
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:43,083
but getting you back here
was the most I could manage.

264
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:47,500
And Piccolo.
He died protecting me.

265
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,708
[GOKU] Don't worry,
it's going to be okay.

266
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:50,916
We can bring him back using

267
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
the Namekian
Dragon Balls, right?

268
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,791
[gasps]
Oh, yeah.

269
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,166
[GOKU]
Don't go far, Piccolo.

270
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,625
I'll have you back in
your body soon, I promise.

271
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,208
[SORBET]
Huh?

272
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,083
[FRIEZA] Seems those insects
from Yardrat taught Goku

273
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,458
that damned trick of theirs.

274
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:10,000
Why would he show up
just to run away?

275
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,416
[FRIEZA] Calm down.
He's already returned.

276
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,000
[SORBET snarls]

277
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:18,333
Saiyans have no business
wielding that kind of power!

278
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:21,083
I'll reassemble the troops;
we might still need them.

279
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,541
[FRIEZA]
Hm.

280
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,375
I wouldn't go that far,
but this could at least

281
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,625
make it a more
interesting fight.

282
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,458
Goten, Trunks, listen!

283
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,416
I took Piccolo's body
to the Lookout.

284
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,708
I want you boys to go there,
and talk to Dende

285
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:35,958
so he knows what to do.

--[TRUNKS] Okay!
--[GOTEN] 'Kay!

[FRIEZA FORCE yells]

288
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,583
But you're about to
kick Frieza's butt, right?

289
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:44,958
Can't we do it after that?

290
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,083
Yeah, we never get
to see the cool fights!

291
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,458
This isn't a debate!

292
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,625
What's about to happen isn't
gonna be kid friendly.

293
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:53,500
You got me? Now go!

--Fine.
--That's not fair!

295
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,083
Do what he says, Trunks,

296
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,416
and don't make me
tell you again.

297
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,583
Aw, man! Okay.

298
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,000
Guess we don't have a choice.

299
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,250
[BULMA, JACO sigh]

300
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,250
Right! I'd better
escort you there myself,

301
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07,958
to make sure
you're safe and stuff.

302
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,041
You're staying
right here, Jaco!

303
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:13,250
[JACO] I'm not sure who's
scarier, Frieza or Bulma?

304
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,250
Just make sure
Frieza's beaten, okay?

305
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,125
And beaten good!

306
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,541
[KRILLIN]
Here, another senzu.

307
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,750
Thanks, Krillin,
that helps a lot.

308
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:28,708
So, what about
the rest of you guys?

309
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,708
You need it
way more than we do.

310
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:31,916
But we should save what's left

311
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,958
in case things
get worse from here.

312
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,375
Sorry, Krillin.

313
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,500
[KRILLIN] Seriously, you got
to stop apologizing.

314
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,833
There's no point
in healing us now, anyway.

315

[GOHAN]
Huh?

316
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:45,083
It's crazy, right?
Your dad always does this.

317
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,958
Sometimes I think his
timing is on purpose.

318
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,791
But this is up to him
and Vegeta now.

319
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,083
Here at last, Goku.

320
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,833
I've been waiting
a long time for this.

321
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:04,041
Finally I can claim
the revenge I've dreamed of

322
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,791
for all these years.

323
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,375
I didn't think
I'd see Vegeta with you,

324
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:09,791
but monkeys do travel in troops.

325
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,333
Ha!

326
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:14,708
[GOKU] And I thought we were
done with you for good, Frieza.

327
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:17,500
Last I remember you were
in about a thousand pieces.

328
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,875
[VEGETA] His minions
used the Dragon Balls.

329
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,291
Am I right about that?

330
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,041
And how poetic it was!

331
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,833
Using Earth's
Dragon Balls to save me.

332
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:28,916
From the humiliation
that was Earth's Hell!

333
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,041
You can't imagine
my suffering there!

334
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,375
I spent most of
my days strung up

335
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,875
like a damned pupating moth,

336
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:36,375
trapped over a field of flowers
where angels and fairies

337
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,500
and enchanted
stuffed animals lived!

338
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,291
They played asinine songs
about smiling

339
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,000
and warm fuzzy hugs!

340
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,916
Instead of ruling
with an iron fist,

341
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,750
I was serenaded by teddy bears!

342
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,458
Don't try to put
that on me, Frieza.

343
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,666
You're the one who came
to Earth looking for a fight.

344
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:53,166
That's why Trunks took your
life; it was your choice!

345
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,000
Oh, but I had
to come here, Goku.

346
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:58,083
That's what you're far too
thickheaded to understand.

347
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,916
Your death is
my remedy and required

348
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,791
before I move on,
because I'll never be able

349
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:05,125
to sleep in this cosmos knowing
that I share it with you!

350
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,750
I feel the same way!

351
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,041
After what he did
to my proud Ginyu Force!

352
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,208
Ginyu Force? Whoa, no way!

353
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,666
Is that the guy who
switched bodies with me

354
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,250
when we were fighting
back on Namek?

355
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,750
You mean Captain Ginyu.

356
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,250
That's too bad;
I liked him better

357
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:18,625
when he was croaking.

358
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,458
[GINYU] You Saiyans
can treat it like a big joke

359
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,458
but for me it was
years of agony!

360
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:27,041
Out of all the bodies,
you trapped me in a frog!

361
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:29,875
Do you realize what that's
like for an elite warrior?

362
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:31,666
To drag his belly in the dirt?

363
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,041
[VEGETA] Well it's all
relative, don't you think?

364
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,125
What? Wait, how did you--?

365
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:38,333
[FRIEZA]
Ooh.

366
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:39,875
At least if you had
stayed on your lily pad

367
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,416
then you wouldn't have to die.

368
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,041
Hold on! Vegeta!

What? There's nothing left!

372
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,458
That was too far.

373
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:58,666
You killed him without even
giving him a chance!

374
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,000
Heh. Spare me
your morals, Kakarot.

375
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,625
I eliminated a threat!

376
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:05,791
[FRIEZA laughs]
Impressive display, Vegeta.

377
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:08,708
You've clearly gotten stronger
since our last encounter.

378
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,291
But you'll have to
wait your turn.

379
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:13,500
I'd prefer not to kill you until
after I've taken care of Goku.

380
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:16,083
Too bad. Because I'd
prefer to kill you now

381
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,958
so Kakarot doesn't
hog all the fun.

382
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,416
Aaah...

383
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,541
[GOKU]
You've changed, Frieza.

384
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,916
I can tell you're
a lot stronger, too.

385
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,041
I'm so glad you noticed.

386
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,041
I've been training
intensively every day

387
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:42,041
since my return to make sure
I wouldn't lose to you again.

388
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,583
Having to put
real effort into anything

389
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,833
was a first for me, Goku.

390
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,708
I'll make sure you pay
for that, as well.

391
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,250
But actually,
trying has made me

392
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,458
stronger than I predicted.
My old power was

393
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:55,708
a tiny speck compared to
what I possess now.

394
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,375
[chuckles]

395
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:58,875
Good for you,
but we haven't been exactly

sitting on our butts.

After all that
I've been through,

398
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,250
I'm surprised you can
even recognize me.

399
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,666
As fun as this playing
"No-I'm-Stronger-Than-You-Are,"

400
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:10,458
I think I should settle things
with a proper demonstration.

401
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:11,875
The first time we fought
I made mistakes

402
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,750
and you caught me off guard.

403

To ensure that
doesn't happen again

404
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,875
I'll take my final form
from the start.

No! The Frieza Force!

wipe out his entire army

his power's impressive!

473
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:09,291
Usually I like strong opponents,
but this guy makes me sick.

474
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:11,166
So, get out of the way, Vegeta.

475
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,000
It's time I show my new power

476
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:15,666
that's even better
than Super Saiyan God.

477
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,166
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

478
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,625
"Clash! Frieza vs. Goku.

479
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:22,750
This Is the Result
of My Training!"

480
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:25,000
I know you don't
want to miss this!
