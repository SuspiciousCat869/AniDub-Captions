Ha!

00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:11,461
Now it's chasing me?
Man, what a pain!

You two have fought well.

00:16:48,081 --> 00:16:50,667
You've got talent
I've only rarely seen.

332
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,336
But you both still need to
learn how to finish a fight.

333
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,463
If we have a chance
after this thing ends,

334
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:57,132
we should face off again.

Hey, take it easy!

Damn it. I'm a disgrace!

342
00:17:13,106 --> 00:17:16,818
Hey, Kale. We've been
saying together

343
00:17:16,901 --> 00:17:19,946
we're the toughest force in
the cosmos, haven't we?

00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,573
Yeah, that's right.

00:17:21,656 --> 00:17:23,783
[CAULIFLA] Time to
believe that, all the way.

346
00:17:23,867 --> 00:17:26,327
Get out those things we got
before this battle started.

No! It couldn't be!

Hmph.

Who are you?!

360
00:18:37,941 --> 00:18:39,859
This is Kale.

361
00:18:39,943 --> 00:18:42,237
Plus Caulifla!

362
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,239
We're Kefla!

363
00:18:44,322 --> 00:18:49,452
[CHAMPA laughs] My idea worked!
It really worked!

364
00:18:49,536 --> 00:18:52,163
Well, Fuwa. I am the one

365
00:18:52,247 --> 00:18:55,041
who let them borrow them in
the first place, Lord Champa.

366
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,794
Oh, never mind the details, Kai!

367
00:18:57,877 --> 00:18:59,337
Take it to him!

00:18:59,421 --> 00:19:01,006
Could it really be?

369
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,800
[CHAMPA]
Listen up.

370
00:19:03,883 --> 00:19:06,886
We're only giving you these
sacred items as a last resort,

371
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:10,515
is that clear? Don't put
them on unless you must!

372
00:19:10,598 --> 00:19:12,892
Little dangly things
aren't really my style.

373
00:19:12,976 --> 00:19:15,437
[CHAMPA] I literally just
said not to do that!

[CAULIFLA]
Jeez, what the hell!

Here, Cabba, you take mine.

[KALE]
Yeah, mine too...

00:19:20,275 --> 00:19:21,943
[CABBA]
What? I don't want them.

378
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:23,528
[CHAMPA]
Just trust me!

379
00:19:23,611 --> 00:19:26,072
They're more powerful
than they look!

380
00:19:26,573 --> 00:19:28,074
So that's what they do?

381
00:19:28,158 --> 00:19:30,660
The entity born through
the merging of two individuals

382
00:19:30,744 --> 00:19:34,080
who wear the Potara earrings
has a personality all her own.

383
00:19:34,164 --> 00:19:36,833
And her power is not simply
the sum of her separate parts,

384
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:39,294
but is multiplied dozens
of times over.

385
00:19:39,377 --> 00:19:42,339
That's right! See?
They are powerful!

386
00:19:42,422 --> 00:19:43,923
That's why I told you to wait!

387
00:19:44,007 --> 00:19:46,843
Because you always save your
biggest weapon for the end!

388
00:19:46,926 --> 00:19:48,887
Please, go and make
the most of this chance!

Win it for us,
Caulifla and Kale!
