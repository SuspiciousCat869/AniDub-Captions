him to jump back into battle,

Don't you worry,
I've got tons to spare!

161
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,170
Fighting her won't tap me out!

162
00:08:34,254 --> 00:08:37,090
There's no room for error--
don't be careless!

163
00:08:37,173 --> 00:08:40,176
Just hold on. I think
we should listen to him.

00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,511
Huh?!

165
00:08:41,594 --> 00:08:44,139
I'm gonna keep pushing
until you beg me to stop!

166
00:08:44,222 --> 00:08:46,850
Let me do this!
I <i>can</i> defeat her!

[CAULIFLA growls]

He has a point--
there are stronger foes!

169
00:08:51,229 --> 00:08:54,024
You should use your energy
to fight them instead!

170

All right fine, whatever.

00:09:00,697 --> 00:09:03,408
C'mon. We need to find
a way out of here.

00:09:03,491 --> 00:09:04,576
Yeah.

[CABBA] With Hit gone,
Caulifla and Kale

176
00:09:06,619 --> 00:09:09,706
are the best chances the Sixth
Universe has to survive.

177
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:13,293
I have to do everything I
can to help them succeed.

178

Pay attention, I'm a
Saiyan and no pushover.

So I will not let
you look down on me!

[CABBA]
Damn it. I failed.

206
00:10:48,805 --> 00:10:52,892
I couldn't even eliminate
one more enemy for them.

207
00:10:52,976 --> 00:10:55,061
But maybe I at least
bought some time

00:10:55,145 --> 00:10:59,274
for Caulifla and Kale
to recover their strength.

Ah!

Heh.

00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,580
Why would he rescue someone
who's not on our team?

220
00:11:55,663 --> 00:11:57,123
Those two have
forged something of

221
00:11:57,207 --> 00:11:58,792
a "teacher-pupil"
dynamic, sir.

222
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,752
Well that's a complex
thing to navigate

223
00:12:00,835 --> 00:12:02,796
when they're from two
competing universes.

224
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:05,965
Especially since only one
of our teams can survive.

Vegeta's a stand-up guy,
I've always said that!

Yet again, one of our fighters
has been aided in battle

by someone from your brother's
universe, Lord Champa.

Yeah, yeah, I'll be
sure to pay him back.

a freakin' break.

Thank you for saving me.

Yes, Master.

[VEGETA] I didn't pull you
back out of kindness.

00:12:38,623 --> 00:12:40,834
I just can't let a Saiyan
embarrass our race

240
00:12:40,917 --> 00:12:42,961
by losing so easily.

241
00:12:43,044 --> 00:12:44,713
[CABBA]
I understand. I'm sorry.

242
00:12:44,796 --> 00:12:46,256
You aren't planning
to get eliminated

243
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:48,091
and break your old
promise to me,

244
00:12:48,174 --> 00:12:49,718
are you, you punk?

245
00:12:49,801 --> 00:12:51,177
My... promise?

[VEGETA]
You really don't remember?

247
00:12:53,013 --> 00:12:55,890
You said you'd take
me to Planet Sadla.

248
00:12:55,974 --> 00:12:58,018
[CABBA] You know,
the King of Planet Sadla

249
00:12:58,101 --> 00:13:00,603
is a proud, strong man,
much like yourself.

250
00:13:00,687 --> 00:13:02,272
In fact, you remind me of him.

251
00:13:02,355 --> 00:13:03,481
[VEGETA]
That so?

252
00:13:03,565 --> 00:13:05,608
You'll have to introduce
us sometime.

253
00:13:08,737 --> 00:13:11,156
But only one universe
can survive.

254
00:13:11,239 --> 00:13:13,283
That means no matter
how hard I fight,

255
00:13:13,366 --> 00:13:15,452
there's no way to
keep that promise.

256
00:13:15,535 --> 00:13:17,412
I'm going to win this charade.

257
00:13:17,495 --> 00:13:19,831
And when I do, I'll use
the Super Dragon Balls

258
00:13:19,914 --> 00:13:21,624
to bring you and
your universe back.

259
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,419
What? You would do that?

260
00:13:24,502 --> 00:13:26,921
I'm not going to let a
Saiyan break his word.

261
00:13:27,005 --> 00:13:29,799
You're the best! And if by
some chance our universe

262
00:13:29,883 --> 00:13:31,134
ends up winning instead,

263
00:13:31,217 --> 00:13:32,886
I'll make sure we bring back
the Seventh, Master!

264
00:13:32,969 --> 00:13:36,097
Don't be ridiculous!
I'll win this, not you!

265
00:13:36,181 --> 00:13:39,893
Uh! Of course, yeah.
Yeah, sorry sir.

266
00:13:39,976 --> 00:13:42,395
Are those two friends
or not friends?

267
00:13:42,479 --> 00:13:43,938
It is confusing.

268
00:13:44,022 --> 00:13:46,149
It is confusing to me as well!

269
00:13:46,232 --> 00:13:47,859
It appears they have
the relationship

270
00:13:47,942 --> 00:13:49,569
of a teacher and student, sires.

271
00:13:49,652 --> 00:13:51,029
Teacher and student!

272
00:13:51,112 --> 00:13:52,364
How neat!

273
00:13:52,447 --> 00:13:53,531
[VEGETA]
Fight with all you have--

274
00:13:53,615 --> 00:13:55,492
bring honor to yourself
and our kind!

275
00:13:55,575 --> 00:13:57,660
Okay. I will.

A monkey teaching a monkey
with love and adoration.

277
00:14:08,463 --> 00:14:11,758
It really makes the stomach
turn, doesn't it?

278
00:14:12,926 --> 00:14:14,177
Master.

279
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,638
This time I'll remember my
Saiyan pride, I promise!

that pest your master?

After I'm done with you,

00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:26,690
I'll throw out that
miserable Vegeta, too!

Master!

285
00:14:29,442 --> 00:14:33,530
[MONNA] And then those Saiyan
women who ran away!

286
00:14:33,613 --> 00:14:36,282

let you touch them!

And I thought you Saiyans were
supposed to be great warriors!

You're frauds!

Don't you say that... about him!

295
00:14:59,681 --> 00:15:03,351
But it's true. All he could do
is blindside me and run away!

296
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,770
He's nothing but
a spineless chicken!

[CABBA]
How dare you!

298
00:15:08,148 --> 00:15:11,317
I don't know why I'm wasting so
much time with all you sissies!

299
00:15:11,401 --> 00:15:13,611
I'll finish you, that
sucker-punching twerp

300
00:15:13,695 --> 00:15:16,239
and those Saiyan girls,
then find some worthy foes!

Don't you dare call us unworthy!

Hey, there's something different
about Cabba now, isn't there?

304
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,126
Once again our young
Saiyan fighter is maturing

305
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:30,462
in the heat of battle, my lord.

306
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:47,270
Is changing your hair color
supposed to scare me?

Heh. I'm not mad,
I'm just disappointed.

320
00:16:39,572 --> 00:16:41,282
As long as you listen
to my coaching,

321
00:16:41,366 --> 00:16:43,284
you can take down anybody!

322
00:16:43,368 --> 00:16:45,328
But Lord Champa,
wasn't it your advice

323
00:16:45,412 --> 00:16:47,122
that he simply go run and hide?

324

[ZENO]
Boop! Heh!

326
00:16:51,751 --> 00:16:54,295
And with the elimination
of Contestant Monna,

327
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:57,841
the Fourth Universe has
only three fighters left.

328
00:16:59,467 --> 00:17:02,012
[VEGETA]
Hmph. That's more like it.

329
00:17:02,095 --> 00:17:04,055
Now to the more
important issue.

330
00:17:04,139 --> 00:17:06,641
How long does Jiren plan to sit?

331
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:09,310
Cocky bastard
gets under my skin.

332
00:17:09,394 --> 00:17:11,604
He assumes we're not
strong enough to matter.

333
00:17:11,688 --> 00:17:14,691
I'm going to show him
how wrong he is.

334
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:18,153
You'll have to get through me.

335
00:17:18,236 --> 00:17:20,488
I don't pluck second strings.

336
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:23,283
Yet you're second on your
own team, aren't you?

337
00:17:23,366 --> 00:17:25,035
Oh shut it, moustache!

338
00:17:25,118 --> 00:17:28,121
Why don't you come
find out for yourself!

It's you.

Salutations, monkey.

346
00:17:45,889 --> 00:17:48,892
You seem to be a most
stalwart adversary.

347
00:17:48,975 --> 00:17:52,937
I would love the honor of a
duel if you would so oblige.

348
00:17:53,021 --> 00:17:54,606
All right, you got it!

00:17:54,689 --> 00:17:57,609
Feel free to attack me
any way you see fit.

[coughs]

355
00:18:12,415 --> 00:18:13,875
I have to be honest.

356
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:17,128
While I do respect
powerful fighters,

357
00:18:17,212 --> 00:18:21,091
there's nothing that I despise
more than a monkey.

358
00:18:21,174 --> 00:18:23,635
After I've rid this ring
of your vile presence,

359
00:18:23,718 --> 00:18:26,346
I'm going to play with
your Saiyan sisters.

360
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:28,515
That should be a
special kind of fun.

[CABBA]
What?!

362
00:18:32,018 --> 00:18:34,354
I'm not gonna let you
terrorize them.

00:18:34,437 --> 00:18:36,314
There's no way!

are gonna win this!

Use what little brains
you have and surrender.

I'll never give up again.

371
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,474
I'll keep fighting...
until the end.

372

Your end is now.

[CABBA screams]

374
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:28,700
It would have been profligate of
me to waste any more strength

00:19:28,783 --> 00:19:33,121
on you. I have
bigger apes to fry.

[CABBA]
I'm so sorry.

He waited until Cabba was
exhausted and cornered him!

Damn it! That craven weasel!

[FRIEZA laughs] The Super Dragon
Balls will be mine alone.

00:19:49,804 --> 00:19:53,975
And then I'll wrap the gods
around my finger.

Well, I'm just

I saw that Cabba got
knocked out of the ring.

390
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:21,419
Doesn't make any difference--
I just have to win this thing.

Oh, I see.
It's that simple, huh?

First Hit, and now Cabba

have been eliminated from
the Sixth Universe's squad.

415
00:21:26,651 --> 00:21:29,070
But rather than seek
revenge against Frieza

for knocking out her teammate,

417

Caulifla is choosing to
challenge Goku instead.

418

What is driving
this fierce Saiyan?

419
00:21:36,202 --> 00:21:39,122
In this battle royale, the
motivations of each fighter

420
00:21:39,205 --> 00:21:41,791
create an ever-more
complicated web.

of Power ends.

are making bigger

and launching combo
attacks on me, too!

All right, girls,
let's see if you're ready

miss it, okay?
