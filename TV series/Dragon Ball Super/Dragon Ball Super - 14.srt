the massive, divine energy

[BEERUS]
Huh?

00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,625
But I suppose that's
too much to ask of you,

165

isn't it, my lord?

166
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:41,125
It is. A Destroyer must
keep his word, after all.

167
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:45,000
I agreed to spare this planet
if Goku could defeat me.

168
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:48,791
But if I won
I would show no mercy.

169
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,916
You stay out of it,
I'll handle him.

This is no time for an ego trip!

171

We all need to fight together
using whatever power we've got.

Beerus, please.

I'm asking you
one last time, Lord Beerus.

00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,625
Please don't destroy my planet.

There's gotta be another way.

Can't you make an exception?
I'm beggin' you.

No. I cannot.

[BEERUS snoring]

182
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:55,166
Hmm. It seems my lord
has fallen asleep.

183
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,958
[snoring]

184
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,583
[WHIS]
Not surprising, honestly.

185
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,833
He spends most of his time
sleeping and eating

186
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:05,583
and watching what you
would call "TV anime."

187
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,500
So to go from that
to a protracted battle

188
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,875
at maximum power
must take an exhausting toll.

[chuckles]

190
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,708
[WHIS] Just look at him.
He's out cold.

191
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:19,500
It appears that he won't
wake up for quite a long time.

192
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,208
And when he finally does
he will have forgotten

193
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,375
all about his threats
to destroy your world,

194
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,458
or at least that's
the most likely scenario.

195
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:26,875
You're only guessing?

196
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,875
[WHIS]
There can be no guarantees.

197
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,291
Oh great!

00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:31,916

[snoring]

200
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:37,375
Though it's far less likely
he'll forget about the pudding.

201
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,791
If you could have some ready
the next time we come,

202
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,666
that could help
your cause immensely.

203
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,333
Well in that case I'll have a
whole swimming pool full of it.

204
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:45,875
But then I don't
want to hear him complain

205
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,958
if it's not the
wonder-food he's imagining.

206
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,291
Oh if he dislikes it
I doubt you'll hear anything

207
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,416
as he'd almost certainly
destroy the earth for that.

208
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,500
All right, aren't you
supposed to be leaving?

Heh. Goku.

Uh, yeah?

Thank you very much
for playing with Lord Beerus.

212
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:02,875
It has helped more
than you can know.

213
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,625
Someday I'll repay you.

is a bit over the top.

But you know, you can
stop pretending now.

219
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:29,208
I wasn't pretending, Whis.
I did fall asleep!

220
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:30,916
My mistake.

221
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Earth is a curious
place, isn't it?

over Saiyans,

something the Kais call "noble."

It could be argued
that it's changed you

a little as well, my lord.

Care to repeat that?

No, just mumbling nonsense.

Telling Goku that you were
using one hundred percent

230
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:51,000
of your power
was a very clever tactic

to draw out his full strength.
Yes, very effective.

Even though it wasn't true.

It all worked out
exactly like I thought.

I don't want to take
too much credit,

237
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:07,583
but Goku's an amazing guy.

238
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:10,083
He's even gained respect
from a Destroyer.

239
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,041
You might not expect it
from a guy who'd rather

240
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:14,250
train alone than go
to a birthday party,

241

but he sure has a knack
for making friends.

Aw man. This has been
the worst birthday ever.

was just borrowed power.

I'm not sure what happened.

wasn't strong enough to win.

than I was, hands down.

[VEGETA] I did not--
I mean--How did you--?

to get back.

Yeah, you got me.
Sorry about that.

293
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,000
I wanted to watch
Lord Beerus in battle

00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,291
so I could figure out
a good strategy against him.

00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,208
But that was a waste of time,
since I never really

<i>my compass and guide</i>


317
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:30,458
<i>Take me to where I belong</i>


318
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:33,625
<i>The warmth we once shared</i>
<i>Will always be there</i>


319
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:36,250
<i>Its magic lives on in our hearts</i>


320
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:37,416
<i>Shining Star</i>


321
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,208
<i>Give me strength</i>
<i>from your light up above</i>


322
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:43,208
<i>Show me the way to be brave</i>


323
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:49,458
<i>My hands still hold onto hope</i>

[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

326
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:03,166
And after losing to Beerus

327
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,041
my training matters
more than ever!

328
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:08,166
But Chichi says I have to stay
home and do granddad stuff!

329
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,291
Whoa, what's going on
with Mr. Satan?

330
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:12,041
We've barely had
any time to rest

331
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:15,041
and there's already a new
alien species making threats?

332
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:17,500
I think there's a lot more
to this than meets the eye!

333
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:19,875
[GOKU] Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

334
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:22,458
"Valiant Mr. Satan,
Work a Miracle!

335
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:24,458
A Challenge from Outer Space!"

336
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:27,166
Trust me, this one's
too weird to miss!
