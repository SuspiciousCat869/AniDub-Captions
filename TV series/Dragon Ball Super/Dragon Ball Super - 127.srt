Now! 17!

325
00:18:53,331 --> 00:18:56,334
[A17]
Hey, Goku... Vegeta...

326
00:18:56,418 --> 00:18:57,168
[GOKU grunts]

327
00:18:57,252 --> 00:18:58,420
Uh?

328
00:18:59,921 --> 00:19:05,010
[A17] I'm giving up my dream
of that cruise. You owe me.

329
00:19:07,762 --> 00:19:11,141
There. I bought you some time.

330
00:19:11,224 --> 00:19:14,644
Sacrificing myself
to help other people.

331
00:19:14,728 --> 00:19:17,480
Look at me, being all "human."

332
00:19:22,777 --> 00:19:24,529
[screams]

333
00:19:24,612 --> 00:19:26,614
[yelling]

334
00:19:27,782 --> 00:19:28,533
[A17]
Hmph.

335
00:19:28,616 --> 00:19:31,995
[yelling]

336
00:19:38,668 --> 00:19:41,546
[KRILLIN gasping]

337
00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:47,761
[ALL gasping]

338
00:19:47,844 --> 00:19:49,179
I can't believe it.

339
00:19:49,262 --> 00:19:52,432
That attack could've blasted
Goku and Vegeta away.

340
00:19:52,515 --> 00:19:54,017
Yes, and then all three of them

341
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,269
would have been
out of the fight!

342
00:19:58,271 --> 00:20:00,440
You have escaped elimination.

343
00:20:00,523 --> 00:20:02,734
You should be grateful
to your ally.

344
00:20:02,817 --> 00:20:06,488
He has sacrificed himself for
your weak and miserable hides.

345
00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:08,990
[GOKU grunting]

346
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:11,242
[VEGETA grunts]

347
00:20:13,536 --> 00:20:15,914
17. You paid that price

348
00:20:15,997 --> 00:20:19,167
just so we'd have a few
more moments to recover.

349
00:20:22,379 --> 00:20:27,342
Bastard Android. Must've been
planning that from the start.

350
00:20:30,637 --> 00:20:33,848
[GOKU]
Thanks, 17. We owe you.

351
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:35,392
[GOKU groans]

352
00:20:35,475 --> 00:20:39,187
Why did you go and do that?
You just had to play the hero.

353
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,522
Impressive.

354
00:20:40,605 --> 00:20:43,066
He made those barriers
to shield Goku and Vegeta,

355
00:20:43,149 --> 00:20:45,110
but he knew that alone
wouldn't be enough.

356
00:20:45,193 --> 00:20:47,779
So he blew himself up
to counter Jiren's attack

357
00:20:47,862 --> 00:20:50,156
and disperse the
destructive energy.

358
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,533
[ALL grunt]

359
00:20:51,616 --> 00:20:53,284
But then that would mean that...

360
00:20:53,368 --> 00:20:54,619
Yes, that's right.

361
00:20:54,703 --> 00:20:56,746
Even though Jiren
initiated the attack,

362
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,873
17 made the choice
to self-detonate,

363
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:01,668
which means that he
actually eliminated himself.

364
00:21:01,751 --> 00:21:03,795
Therefore Contestant
Jiren of the Eleventh

365
00:21:03,878 --> 00:21:07,048
will not be incurring a penalty.

366
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:09,300
17...

367
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:13,013
You still want more?

368
00:21:13,096 --> 00:21:16,474
[panting]

369
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:19,269
Jiren, I hope you're ready.

370
00:21:19,352 --> 00:21:22,647
'Cause I'm going to knock
the hell out of you.

371
00:21:22,731 --> 00:21:26,609
[NARRATOR] Shielded by
17's explosive final effort,

372
00:21:26,693 --> 00:21:30,613
the Saiyans have managed
to hang on for another round.

373
00:21:30,697 --> 00:21:34,617
Now, Vegeta is summoning
all the power he can

374
00:21:34,701 --> 00:21:37,245
to face Jiren once more.

375
00:21:37,328 --> 00:21:42,417
But how can he hold up against
this seemingly unbeatable foe?

376
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,170
[VEGETA] Don't you dare
look down on me!

377
00:21:45,253 --> 00:21:47,839

Hey! It's me, Goku!

395
00:22:52,278 --> 00:22:54,280
Number 17 gave everything he had

to keep me and Vegeta
in the Tournament,

00:22:56,199 --> 00:22:57,951
which means it's up
to us to keep fighting

00:22:58,034 --> 00:23:00,370
and save our universe
from getting erased!

I don't care how

we've gotta use whatever

out how to win!
