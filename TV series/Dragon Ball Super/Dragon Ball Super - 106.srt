Harmira! C'mon!

Sorry, pal.

If we can keep him from
linking up with his partner,

is keep fighting.

enemies in Harmira and Prum!

But the Seventh's
remaining opponents promise

to be even stronger, with even
more uncanny abilities!

It's not enough
that Goku and his team

withstand the coming onslaught,
they must emerge victorious!
