even sure myself.

319
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:05,797
Of course you're not.

320
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,842
We'll talk later.
You'd best recover fast--

321
00:21:08,925 --> 00:21:10,468
--[instant transmission]
--Huh?!

322
00:21:10,552 --> 00:21:11,886
Kakarot?

323
00:21:12,762 --> 00:21:15,724
[NARRATOR] Goku reached
an astounding new level,

324
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:20,103
an achievement that alarmed even
the highest ranks of the gods.

325
00:21:20,186 --> 00:21:24,607
Only to see it
quickly fade away.

326
00:21:24,691 --> 00:21:27,193
With only 25 minutes remaining

327
00:21:27,277 --> 00:21:29,821
until the fateful end
of the Tournament,

328
00:21:29,904 --> 00:21:34,367
can Goku grasp that power again?

329
00:21:39,122 --> 00:21:41,875
My, my, doesn't this
feel familiar?

330
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,961
It's like Namek all over again.

331
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,884
<i>A 70 centimeter squared window</i>

332
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,855
<i>Today the sun broke</i>
<i>through the clouds</i>

333
00:22:03,938 --> 00:22:07,650
<i>The rain is fin'ly gone</i>

334
00:22:07,734 --> 00:22:10,362
<i>Gonna open up</i>
<i>the window for once</i>

335
00:22:10,445 --> 00:22:14,240
<i>No reason, just because</i>

336
00:22:14,324 --> 00:22:16,826
<i>This room has been</i>
<i>stained with the sighs</i>

337
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:19,329
<i>Of everyday regret</i>

338
00:22:19,412 --> 00:22:22,540
<i>Now it's time to clear the air</i>

339
00:22:22,624 --> 00:22:27,420
<i>Every moment was consumed</i>
<i>with my thoughts of you</i>

340
00:22:29,089 --> 00:22:34,219
<i>Knowing in my heart those dreams</i>
<i>won't be coming true</i>

341
00:22:35,136 --> 00:22:41,851
<i>I've always wanted nothing more</i>
<i>than to see your face</i>

342
00:22:41,935 --> 00:22:47,065
<i>I move on knowing that your</i>
<i>mem'ry can't be erased</i>

343
00:22:51,361 --> 00:22:52,570
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

344
00:22:52,654 --> 00:22:54,614
Jiren, the best of the
Eleventh Universe,

345
00:22:54,698 --> 00:22:56,408
and Hit, the best of the Sixth,

346
00:22:56,491 --> 00:22:58,993
are going toe-to-toe
in a battle of titans.

347
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:01,579
Hit's got a secret strategy
that uses Time-Skips

348
00:23:01,663 --> 00:23:03,748
in a whole new way,
but will his clever trap

349
00:23:03,832 --> 00:23:05,959
be enough against
Jiren's sheer power?

350
00:23:06,042 --> 00:23:08,962
Just watching this fight
is getting me pumped!

351
00:23:09,045 --> 00:23:11,297
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

352
00:23:11,381 --> 00:23:13,758
"An Extra-Dimensional
Ultimate Battle!

353
00:23:13,842 --> 00:23:15,176
Hit vs. Jiren!"

354
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,429
Be sure you don't miss it, okay?
