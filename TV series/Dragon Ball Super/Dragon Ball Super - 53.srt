00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,708
Ow, not cool, Lord Beerus.

160
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,750
I mean, I asked him
nicely didn't I?

161
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:19,166
--[GOWASU] Uh...
--[BEERUS] Whis.

162
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,916
Yes, sir. We're hoping that
you can help us solve a mystery.

163
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,166
Recently a troubling
individual appeared on Earth

164
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,666
in the Seventh...
wearing a Time Ring.

165
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,000
A Time Ring? What is that?

166
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,375
[GOWASU]
Hm.

167
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,541
[WHIS] As if that
weren't vexing enough,

168
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:36,458
this fellow was not
a Supreme Kai.

169
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,375
But that would not be possible!

170
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,833
And just wait till you
hear what he looked like.

171
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,083
He was a dead ringer
for that ridiculous fool

172
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,166
stretching up there.

173
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,166
One, two. One. Uuh?

174
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,750
Who is he?
Do you have any idea?

175
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,875
Strange.

176
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,500
Hey, why are you
starin' at me so hard?

177
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:55,958
You're making me self-conscious.

178
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,416
Is there something on my face?

179
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,833
[ZAMASU]
Eeeh.

180
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,791
Well, all that is rather
inexplicable, isn't it?

181
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,000
Indeed; it simply
doesn't add up.

182
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,708
Tell us. Are all
of your Time Rings

183
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,500
where they should be right now?

184
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,500
Of course.
I store them carefully

185
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,000
in a very safe location.

186
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,375
That's good to hear,
but would you mind

187
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,208
if we checked them out,
to be sure?

188
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,958
Yes, if you insist.
Well, Zamasu?

189
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,416
[ZAMASU]
Uuuuh...

190
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,208
Zamasu! Let's show Lord Beerus

191
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,916
and his associates
to the temple.

192
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,708
Yes, master.

193
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,958
[GOKU gasping]

194
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,083
[groans]

195
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,541
Will you behave yourself?

196
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,416
It seemed as though Zamasu
was unaware of the existence

197
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,875
of the Time Rings
before we mentioned them.

198
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,375
You're right.

199
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,208
I'm very sorry
to keep you waiting.

200
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,875
[GOKU]
Uuuh?

201
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,208
[GOWASU]
As you can see,

202
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,500
all rings are present
and accounted for.

203
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,500
Ah. Indeed.

204
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,375
I guess the search
continues, huh?

205
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,333
Yes. For a moment
you had me worried

206
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,041
I'd made some grave mistake.

207
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,875
But now that we see
all is in order,

208
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,333
I have to ask why you
came to the Tenth Universe

209
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:14,208
for answers to a problem
that occurred in the Seventh.

210
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,666
Oh, right now we're just going
from universe to universe,

211
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,458
paying a visit to them all.

212
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:19,958
[GOWASU]
Is that so?

213
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,000
[ZAMASU]
Get away from me.

214
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,833
[GOKU] Aw, don't be
such a stick in the mud!

215
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:28,125
Just fight me, okay!
Come on, I know you want to!

216
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:31,041
Mind your uncouth tongue
when speaking to me, mortal!

217
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,541
[GOKU] Oh, right, I gotta
do that formal thing.

218
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,000
[clearing throat]

219
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,291
[clears throat]

220
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,458
[GOKU] Uh, sir, it would be
your utmost pleasure

221
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:42,125
to please engage
in fisticuffs with me.

222
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,041
Your Kai-ness. Sir.

223
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,750
[GOWASU sighs]

224
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:48,416
Oh, just go ahead
and spar with him.

225
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,958
Master Gowasu, I...

226
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,875
This could provide an
excellent opportunity for you

227
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,208
to get to know
the mortals better.

228
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:58,750
[sighs]
As you wish.

229
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,875
All right! Yes! Hey, thanks!

230
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,875
You know, you're pretty
cool for an old-timer!

231
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,166
Don't thank me.

232
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,916
It is an important facet
of his training.

233
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,250
[GOWASU]
Let's see how well he's able

234
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:13,458
to keep his heart in check
against this mortal.

235
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:17,416
Now Zamasu, of course you will
have to pull your punches.

236
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,000
--[BEERUS] Uh.
--[GOKU] Uuh!

237
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:22,041
Hold on! Nobody's pulling
anything, okay?

238
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,041
You better face me
with everything you've got,

239
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,500
you understand me?

240
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:26,708
Excuse me?

241
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:27,958
You should listen to the Saiyan.

242
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,916
Don't hold back
even a little bit.

243
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,750
Are you mad?
Why would you say that?

244
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,125
Because if you
hold back, you'll die.

245
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,291
[ZAMASU]
Hm?

246
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,083
[grunts]

247
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,000
[chuckles]

248
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,458
[ZAMASU growls]

249
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,250
But why? Why would
the Tenth Universe's Kai

250
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,708
have the same energy as Black?

251
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:03,000
So, Trunks, how 'bout
Gohan's little girl?

252
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,583
She's a real cutie, huh?

253
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,500
[FUTURE TRUNKS]
Huh? Oh. Yeah.

254
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,666
She seems like
a pretty happy baby.

255
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,125
Actually, you know, I've got
a little one of my own now.

256
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,791
And she is quite a handful.

257
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,416
[FUTURE TRUNKS] Uh! Does that
mean that you're married

258
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,166
and settled down, too?

259
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,500
My big mouth.

260
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,333
That's great. So tell me,
what's your wife like?

261
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:22,333
Eeeh...

262
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:25,458
Wow. These stars
sure are starry!

263
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:26,708
Okay, now I get it!

264
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:29,208
She's someone I know, isn't she?

265
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,166
[KRILLIN chuckles nervously]

266

It's Android 18!

[KRILLIN]
Uuuh...

270
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,916
[KRILLIN]
Wait, Trunks, just calm down!

271
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,541
That's her! That's my wife!

272

We got married! 18's my wife!

Hug time!

276
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,875
[KRILLIN] Marron, shouldn't you
be in bed by now?

277
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,166
Yeah!

278
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,000
[KRILLIN] What are you guys
doing here anyway?

279
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:03,083
Well, you didn't come home,
so we came to check on you.

280
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:06,208
[KRILLIN] Sorry. There's been
a lot goin' on. Don't be mad.

281
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,250
Is he scared of her?

282
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,333
I've heard what you did.

283
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:14,875
You killed me off
in your timeline.

284
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,000
Isn't that right,
you arrogant little punk?

285
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,041
Well, it was you
or mankind, so yeah.

286
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:22,083
Then I demand retribution.
I'm gonna make you pay.

287
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,291
[gasps]

288
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:26,375
Hmm. I gotcha!
I was just kidding.

289
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:27,875
I'm so lost.

290
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,458
--[A18, MARRON laugh]
--[KRILLIN] Okay, okay.

Android 18? Really?

292
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,833
I'm gonna go see how my mom
and the others are doing.

293
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,750
Whoa, I wonder what's
gotten into him.

294
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,208
[chuckles]

295
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:45,083
The space-time gyros
are locked into place now.

earned ourselves a little break.

[BULMA'S DAD]
Uh! Good idea.

[ALL exhale]

299
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,833
Hey, Mom,
how's it going in here?

300
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:55,000
Not to worry! Everything's
moving along smoothly.

301
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,083
Oh, hello, Trunks.

Hm?

00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,083
[PILAF growls]

You're mine, Black!

306

Just look at that, Shou.

307
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,458
Based on what I can interpret
from Mai's gushy reactions,

308
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:21,916
she's clearly
got the hots for that

young blue-haired lad
from the future.

310
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:27,291
Okay, listen. Even normal
relationships between

311
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,333
men and women
are delicate things.

312
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,958
And this one adds time travel,
which complicates everything!

313
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,041
They are full-on star-crossed!

314

[SHOU snoring]

315

ever get together?

No, I'm far from all right.

I think I scraped
my leg pretty bad.

I'll go and find you
a first-aid kit.

That's not necessary. I just
need a small bandage.

Thanks. You're so
thoughtful, Mai.

She's not just a diehard

she's also got a softer,
more nurturing side, too.

we can't yet explain or prove.

sure about this?

like such a bad guy to me.

Yeah, that's just because
you're too trusting of people!

It's just that the energy
I felt was similar,

438
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:28,500
but it wasn't exactly
the same as Black's.

As I said, there are
still mysteries to solve.

And now that I think about it,

the tingling sensation in
my hand that I got from him

442

kinda reminds me of when I was
fighting you, Lord Beerus.

What? How dare you
compare him to me!

We're on completely
different levels!

Yeah, that guy
still has room to grow,

stronger than you someday.

Good point, Lord Beerus.

one more time,

and I won't even look back!

453
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,541
[ZAMASU] Master Gowasu.
I want to thank you

454

for encouraging me
to fight against the Saiyan.

[GOWASU]
Mmm.

456

My understanding of his kind
has grown much deeper

457
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,125
because of the encounter.

458
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:16,333
So I see. Has this helped to
assuage the feelings of disdain

459
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:19,500
toward mortals that have
been bubbling up inside you?

460
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:22,666
[ZAMASU] I'm deeply ashamed
of how callow I've been.

461
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,875
[GOWASU] Then, I assume you've
learned an important lesson?

[ZAMASU]
Yes.

463
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,916
[GOWASU] You should know,
coming to this realization

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,458
is an important step.

is what it means to grow.

Yes, master.

Yes, master.

[ZAMASU]
Oh, I've learned a lesson.

Mortals are even more
dangerous than I thought.

I will never forget you.

00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:00,000
<i>Get ready!</i>
<i>Instant Transmission!</i>

473
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,541
<i>Two fingers placed</i>
<i>right between the eyes</i>

474
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:04,958
<i>Get ready!</i>
<i>My hair will stand up!</i>

475
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:07,541
<i>'Cause I got</i>
<i>all the power of a Saiyan!</i>

476
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:08,875
<i>Ohhhh HEY!</i>

477
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:11,166
<i>YOKA YOKA DANCE! (HEY!)</i>
<i>YOKA YOKA DANCE! (HEY!)</i>

<i>DANCE! (KAMEHAMEHA!)</i>

479
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,291
<i>YOKA YOKA DANCE! (HEY!)</i>
<i>YOKA YOKA DANCE! (HEY!)</i>

480
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:18,833
<i>YOKA YOKA YOKA YOKA</i>
<i>YOKA YOKA YOKA YOKA</i>

481
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:21,333
<i>DANCE! It's what you need</i>

482
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:23,750
<i>Feel the magic of the beat</i>
<i>(Woo-hoo)</i>

483
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:26,291
<i>DANCE! It makes you smile</i>

484
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:28,666
<i>Nothing else can</i>
<i>quite compete (yoka yoka)</i>

485
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,958
<i>So when the world is lame</i>

486
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:31,416
<i>Don't play that game</i>

487
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,791
<i>You know that every problem</i>
<i>can be answered the same</i>

488
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:36,708
<i>Just let go and feel the rhythm</i>

[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

491
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:45,291
Well, Trunks, I hope you got
enough to eat while I was gone.

492
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:47,541
After all, we're about to
go back and defeat Black

493
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:49,125
and you're gonna
need your energy.

494
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:51,333
Ooh, you're sparring
against Vegeta?

495
00:22:51,416 --> 00:22:53,333
Careful, he's a lot
more awesome now

496
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:55,208
than he was last time
you saw him.

497
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,833
Just stop dwelling on whatever's
going through your head

498
00:22:57,916 --> 00:23:00,000
and hit him as hard as you can!

499
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:02,375
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

500
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:05,875
"He Who is of Saiyan Blood.
Trunks's Resolve."

501
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:08,000
Make sure you don't
miss it, okay?
