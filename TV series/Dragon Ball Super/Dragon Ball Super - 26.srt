[NARRATOR] Previously,
on Dragon Ball Super,

3
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:55,916
as his battle
with Goku ramped up,

4
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,500
the resurrected Frieza
unveiled the results

5
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:01,916
of his intensive training,
and transformed into something

6
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,333
far beyond his previous form.

7
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,083
I know the gold's
a bit gauche but I wanted

8
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:08,166
to ensure you
grasped my new position.

9
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,083
At the very top of the
universe's pecking order.

10
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:13,791
And now for the sake
of your feeble little mind,

11
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:15,458
we can keep the name
simple as well.

12
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:17,541
We'll call this Golden Frieza.

[NARRATOR] With Goku
powered up to his own,

14

self-made version
of Super Saiyan God,

15
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:27,375
the two titans appeared
at first to be evenly matched.

16
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,250
But as the fight raged on,

17
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,125
Golden Frieza's power
proved to be

18
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:33,250
even greater than Goku thought,

19
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:37,166
and gradually the
Evil Emperor wore Goku down.

20

If Frieza can't be overpowered,
is there another way?

If he and Vegeta

We discussed this subject
during their training.

Though the Saiyans
have teamed up in the past,

64

neither showed any interest
in doing it again.

It seems they would rather
lose than agree to that.

As far as I can tell,

is if I died from laughter.

161
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,125
You've had your shot.
It's my turn now.

162
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,291
Ah, come on, Vegeta.
That isn't fair!

163
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,833
You and I both know
it's just about to get fun!

164
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:05,833
Hm?

165
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:06,958
I'm not gonna
let you take over

166
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,375
right at the best part!

167
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,583
I'm done watching!
You're hogging him!

168
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:11,833
Just a little more time.

169
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,750
Just a teensy,
weensy bit, all right?

170
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:16,166
Do you honestly
expect me to believe you?

171
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,833
I'm serious, okay. I promise!

172
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:20,583
Just the tiniest
little teeny bit.

173
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,458
[grunts]

174
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,875
Stop this ridiculous chatter.

175
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:31,458
You won't make a mockery of me!

176
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:34,916
All right, Frieza.
You want serious?

177
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,625
Then that's what you'll get.

178
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,333
[GOKU]
I'll tell you right now,

179
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,291
you'd be a whole lot
better off leaving this planet

180
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:00,083
on a high note, while you're
still winning the battle.

181
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,333
After all you did just
get a new chance at life

182
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:03,958
and I'd hate to
see you to waste it.

183
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,291
[laughs]

184
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,666
Retreat with victory
so close at hand?

185
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,750
That's a strategy only
a Saiyan could devise.

186
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,791
What sort of fool
do you think I am?

187
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,458
[chuckles]
It's up to you.

188
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,500
But if you stick around
it's gonna get harder,

189
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:19,291
because I'm about to
turn the tables on you.

190
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:22,708
The flailing of cornered prey
always fascinates me.

191
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,291
Since you're
ignoring my warning,

192
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,208
I assume that means you haven't
realized the problem yet.

193
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:29,166
Your Golden Frieza form
is awesome,

194
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,166
but it has a big weakness, too.

195
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,500
[laughs]

196
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:35,000
Don't try to manipulate me
with mind games, Goku,

197
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,208
I'm the master of the art.

198
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,666
You can't chip away
at my confidence

199
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,666
with some vague
and ludicrous claim.

200
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,166
Then I guess we'll see.

201
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,625
Since powering up
I've been using you

202
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:46,083
as a wrecking ball
to reshape this landscape.

203
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,375
Yet you say I'm the one
with the weakness?

204
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,833
Don't you know
for a lie to work

205
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,916
there has to be
a kernel of truth?

206
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,583
It's not effecting you yet,
Frieza, but it's about to.

207
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:57,083
And all I have to do
is wait for it.

208
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,291
Is that so? Then all
I would have to do

209
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:02,750
is kill you now, since you've
so stupidly given me warning.

210
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,791
[chuckles]
That is your best chance,

211
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:08,166
but I'm not gonna make it easy.

212
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,125
Oh?

You're always more fun
when you're desperate, Goku.

216
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,458
You should have been using
that reserve from the start.

217
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:35,291
Well, now I'm gonna hit you
with everything I've got.

218
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:36,666
Glad to hear it.

219
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,708
Yes, let's make this
final act a strong one

220
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,750
with all the grandeur
it deserves.

221
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:43,791
I'm going to unleash everything
I have left as well.

222
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:47,750
You're going to see
what true power looks like.

your strength
really is incredible.

Isn't this what you wanted?

228
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,166
The chance to fight me
in my full glory?

229
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,208
Yeah. It's only right.

230
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:13,083
From here on out
we both play for keeps.

I can't believe they
were still holding back.

Their power's so high I can't
make sense of it anymore.

Yeah, I know what you mean.

different territory now.

As if I'd allow the slightest
chance of losing to you again.

Clearly a dirty move

you have to give him that.

Goku this could happen.

if he completely
drops his guard like that.

it's made you overconfident.

A fearless fool who
insists on second chances

360

and habitually
lowers his guard.
