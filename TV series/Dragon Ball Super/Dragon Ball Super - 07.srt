Thank you!

[WHIS]
My word! Oh-ho-ho-ho!

00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,958
So this is
what you call sushi?

00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:53,375
Yes, sir. Don't forget
to dip it in this first.

175
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,208
That's called soy sauce.

[WHIS] Now what's
this orange one here

with the spongy texture?

178
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,250
That one's our special
sea urchin battleship roll.

Oh, my!

180
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,333
And what about that one?

00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:07,250
It's practically sparkling
like a diamond.

That's our premium

Okay, be right there!

Hello, Lord Beerus.
You called?

I've been calling you
for quite some time.

Like I said before, I'm ready to
destroy this planet and go home.

Does that mean
you're over your little

And you're keeping it all
for yourself, I see.

No need for
hurt feelings, my lord.

207
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,375
I'm having a special sampler
platter made for you

that we can take on the road.

How unusually
thoughtful of you.

Of course that means
you'll have to be patient

a little bit longer.

Okay, okay. I suppose
I can hold off on

for a sampler platter.

back their real strength

holding back at all.

It's bad, Videl.
