00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,120
[VADOS]
Well, not in this realm.

162
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,850
Lord Champa is the Destroyer
of the Sixth Universe.

163
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,350
You're suggesting
that there's a si--?

164
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:29,520
Hey. Who's stronger,
you or Lord Beerus?

165
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,660
[CHAMPA]
Hmph! Hmmm.

166
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,690
Now, now, mortal,

167
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,900
there's no need for you
to ask such a thing.

168
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:38,200
Given their physiques,
it should be obvious.

169
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:40,300
Hey now! Not cool!

170
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,040
[yawns]

171
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,940
So, what is it
you want from me, Champa?

172
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,770
'Cause it better not be
something frivolous,

173
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,780
or I'll kick your ass!

174
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,780
Wouldn't you like to know?

175
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,210
The fact is I came here
to give you a taste

176
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,320
of something devilishly
world-shattering.

177
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:58,120
Something that you aren't
likely to get over easy.

178
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,790
[BEERUS]
Mmm.

179
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,860
[CHAMPA chuckles]

180
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,870
[BEERUS snarls]

181
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,840
[VEGETA] Beerus looks tense.
This really could be something.

182
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,880
All right, Vados, lay it on him.

183
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,040
Yes. As you wish.

184
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:32,650
[WHIS]
Huh.

185
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,290
[CHAMPA chuckles]

186
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,330
[VEGETA]
Huh?

187
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,170
Wait, aren't those
just plain old eggs?

188
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,300
[CHAMPA] There's nothing
plain or old about them.

189
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,410
These here are the eggs
of the newly-discovered

190
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,880
dondon bird, hardboiled.

191
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:14,910
So delicious I guarantee
they'll leave you speechless.

192
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,480
And on top of that,
they're nutritious, too.

193
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,390
You boys can each have one.

194
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,090
Don't be shy.
Here, have a taste.

195
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,070
[VEGETA]
Tastes like a regular egg.

196
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,200
Nothing special about it.

197
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,010
Delicious!

198
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,480
Now admit it.
Food from the Sixth Universe

199
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,080
makes whatever slop
you offer here

200
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:47,110
taste like hot, sweaty garbage.

201
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,850
Don't just stand there.
Show them.

202
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:56,360
Of course.
Right away, my lord.

203
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:03,500
[CHAMPA]
Hm. This stuff? What is it?

204
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,200
Wait, hold on.
Don't tell me you pour sand

205
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,740
from the hourglass over it?
[laughs]

206
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,770
That sounds nasty!

207
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,210
There. Bon appétit.

208
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,810
Yes! Now we're talking!

209
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,780
[slurps]

210
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,620
[VEGETA slurps]

211
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,450
[CHAMPA]
Huh.

212
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,660
[BOTH slurp]

213
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,290
Eehee!

214
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,360
Wow, unexpected.

215
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,230
[BOTH slurp]

216
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,670
Heh.

217
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:46,210
[gasps]

218
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,640
[laughs]

219
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,850
How's that?

220
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:55,120
[CHAMPA]
Not bad. I guess.

221
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,250
Well, you certainly
ate it all pretty fast

222
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,390
for just "not bad."

223
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,490
[CHAMPA] How can you
make something so good

224
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,160
just by adding hot water?

225
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,330
What kind of
witchcraft is this?

226
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,270
It's instant ramen.

227
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,830
I've never heard of that dish.

228
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,470
Where did you get this from?

229
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,840
A curious planet
called "Earth."

230
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,270
A weird name.

231
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,510
That's just the start.

232
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,770
Earth is positively
brimming with

233
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,440
all kinds of
scrumptious treats.

234
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,780
So many, in fact,
that I can't even count them.

235
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:25,480
[CHAMPA] Vados! Surely, we must
have one of these Earths

236
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,120
in the Sixth Universe, too!
So, find it!

237
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,420
Yes, sir. Right away.

238
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,290
What is this Sixth Universe?

239
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,330
Is anyone going
to explain this to me?

240
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,060
Oh, my. You mean you
really don't know, huh?

241
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,430
Well, to begin with, there are
a total of twelve universes.

242
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,600
The universe that we're all
standing in at the moment

243
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,570
is known as
the Seventh Universe.

244
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,110
The universe is everything.
How can there be more?!

245
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,510
It's all a matter
of dimensions, Vegeta.

246
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,210
Lord Champa and Vados
crossed over to our Seventh

247
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,580
from their home in the Sixth.

248
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,220
These two universes
are remarkably similar

249
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,320
and have an almost twin-like
relationship to one another.

250
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,220
You see, things generally
occur in pairs,

251
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,790
and so, for everything,
there exists

252
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,330
a corresponding counterpart.

253
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,560
For example, the First and
Twelfth Universes go together.

254
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,430
As do the Second
and Eleventh ones.

255
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:19,100
This is because any two
universes whose numbers

256
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:22,470
add up to 13 are considered
natural counterparts.

257
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,310
Whoa. I had no clue.

258
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,580
So, wait, if the Twelfth and
then the Thirteenth and the--

259
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,340
You know, could you just
explain it one more time?

260
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,750
Uh. I'll catch you up later!

261
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,550
[WHIS]
Hmm. No, sister.

262
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,650
It should be much
farther down than that.

263
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:39,220
Ah, there it is. That's the
spiral galaxy you'll find it in.

264
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,420
Look out there along the edge.

265
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,030
Yes, right there.

266
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,290
It's the third planet
in that solar system.

267
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,660
Hey, didja hear that, Vegeta?

268
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,400
He called that lady
his "sister."

269
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,470
There's an air
of toughness to her.

270
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,400
I bet she's mastered
the same techniques as Whis.

271
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,500
[GOKU laughs]
You know what this means?

272
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,140
It means, that like,
there have gotta be

273
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,640
hundreds of warriors out there
who are stronger than we are!

274
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,510
You say that
like it's a good thing.

275
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,110
[VADOS]
Here we are.

276
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,650
I'm sorry Whis-lady, but
that looks nothing like Earth.

277
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:09,520
Huh, well, that's odd.

278
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:12,660
Perhaps you should look further
back into the planet's history.

279
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:13,790
[VADOS]
Hmm.

280
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,120
[WHIS]
Hmm.

281
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,130
Ah, so that's
what happened there.

282
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,660
It would seem that
the Sixth Universe's Earth

283
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,330
was plunged into
a foolish conflict

284
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,430
which wiped out
its entire population.

285
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,670
[CHAMPA hollers, grunts]

286

[BEERUS laughs intensely]

287
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,510
Well that's downright
tragic, Champa!

288
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,410
I guess you just don't
have any earthlings left

289
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,180
in your lousy universe.

290
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:39,010
Meaning no one to make
those dishes for you!

291
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,680
[CHAMPA growls]

292
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,520
Well, if it makes
you feel any better,

293
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:45,290
our Earth has seen its fair
share of catastrophes, too.

294
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,660
I mean, even Vegeta here
threatened to

295
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,720
turn it into
space dust once or twice.

296
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,530
That was a long time ago!

297
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,260
Oww!

298
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,260
Whoa, what was that for,
Vegeta? It's totally true!

00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,340
Ooh!
[chuckles]

301
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:02,270
Say, Beerus!
Let's have a contest, huh?

302
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:05,370
A contest? What exactly
are you proposing?

303
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:07,810
I mean a fighting
competition, obviously!

304
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:10,350
And if I win, we trade
Earths with each other.

305
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,020
Really? You want to fight me?

306
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:19,120
[laughs]

307

[CHAMPA growls]

308
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,290
Let me finish what I was saying!

309
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,730
[laughing]
Oh, come on now!

310
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,700
You said "fighting,"
not "pie eating," right?

311
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:30,630
You watch your damn mouth,
you scrawny punk!

312
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,530
[BEERUS]
Huh?

313
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,710
[BOTH gasp]

314
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:50,590
We're twin brothers.
And both of us are Destroyers.

315
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,720
So then why is it
that we always seem to be

316
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,260
at each other's
throats like this?

317
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,530
Uh. What now?

318
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,340
Uh oh. I don't like
where this is going.

00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:10,670
Hey, hey! Wait for me, Vegeta!

320
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:19,280
[BOTH growl]

321
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,820
[CHAMPA grunts]

322
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,320
[BEERUS grunts]

323
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,400
So awesome!

324
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:37,030
Uh. Kakarot, look.

325
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,070
[BOTH gasp]

326
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,250
[BOTH]
That's enough!

327
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,150
[GOKU]
Uh. Uh...

328
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,120
[VEGETA]
No, no! Don't step on--

329
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,720
[GOKU, VEGETA yell]

330
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,910
Why'd you interrupt us?

331
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,820
Yes, that was just rude.

332
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,750
I'm sorry, but we
couldn't stand idly by

333
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,550
and allow one Destroyer
to engage another in combat.

334
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,060
The two of you
must know your combat

335
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,060
would inevitably lead to
the rather inconvenient

336
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:16,760
annihilation of both the Sixth
and Seventh Universes.

337
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,060
[VEGETA] They talk about it
like it's no big deal!

338
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,730
Seeing as you were
the one to suggest

339
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:23,100
we fight each other
in the first place, Champa,

340
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,400
this is all your fault!

341
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,100
No, this is your fault
for not letting me

342
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,270
finish what I wanted to say!

343
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,940
I wasn't proposing
we simply fight each other.

344
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,450
This'll be between
contestants we choose

345
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,280
from each of our universes.

346
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,620
[GOKU gasps gleefully]

347
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,750
[CHAMPA] Let's see. Hm. How
'bout we have teams of five?

348
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:42,820
So, to begin with, we'll each
send out one competitor.

349
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,990
And whoever wins that
first fight will move on.

350
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,960
They'll continue facing off
like that, one-on-one,

351
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,360
until the final team's
captain is defeated.

352
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,600
Amusing idea,
but why should I?

353
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:55,530
What would I gain from
such a silly contest?

354
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,970
And besides, even if you won,
how do you plan to swap Earths?

355
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:01,570
There's simply no way
something like that's possible.

356
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,310
--[CHAMPA] Oh, but it is.
--[BEERUS] Hm?

357
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,480
You see, recently
I've devoted a lot of time

358
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,080
and effort to
collecting wish orbs.

359
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,550
Lord Champa!

360
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,450
Shut up! Look,
these magical spheres

361
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,050
that I've gathered can grant
anything your heart desires.

362
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,490
And yes, "anything"
would encompass, obviously,

363
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,890
swapping our Earths.

364
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,360
Now, I currently have
six of them on hand,

365
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,790
so I only need
to find one more orb,

366
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:24,700
and then I will have
all of them in my possession.

367
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,530
But if your Seventh
Universe fighters win,

368
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:28,470
I'll give all six
of them to you.

369
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,630
Hear that?

370
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,040
Those things sound kinda like
Dragon Balls, don't they?

371
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,370
[VEGETA]
Uh huh.

372
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,640
Unfortunately for you,
we already have those

373
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,910
in our universe,
so we won't need yours.

374
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:41,010
Dragon Balls? Is that
what you're talking about?

375
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,920
Tell me, would those happen to
have been forged by Namekians?

376
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,380
Well now, were they?

377
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,590
Yup.

378
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,420
[CHAMPA] Ah, I knew it. The same
is true where I come from,

379
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,690
except those Dragon Balls
you speak of were, in fact,

380
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:54,330
long ago carved out of fragments
of much larger wish orbs

381
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,790
by the ancient Namekians.

382
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,800
There are limits to what
those Dragon Balls can do

383
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,800
and the wishes they can grant.

384
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,900
The real ones are
on a different scale.

385
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,340
They're so big, they should
be called "wish planets"!

386
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,640
And there's no request
that's too grand for them!

387
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,540
I believe in the parlance
of your universe,

388
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,380
they'd likely be given
a suitably spectacular

389
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,710
and catchy name like
"Super Dragon Balls"!

390
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,950
How do you like that?
Mine are better than yours are!

391
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,010
So, are you super-jealous?

392
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,320
I know you super-want
them now, don't you?

393
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,420
[BEERUS grunts] If they're
worthless without all seven,

394
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,490
then what good
would your six do me?

395
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,320
Add in the fact that
you're so quick to wager them

396
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,820
and it's clear to me
that you have neither hope

397
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,630
nor expectation of
ever finding the last one.

398
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,800
So, you'll understand if
I'm not interested in your--

399
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,800
[GOKU] I bet Bulma
could find it in no time!

400
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,470
--What was that?
--[CHAMPA] Huh?

401
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,040
It's true. Knowing Bulma,
she could whip up a device

402
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:41,640
capable of locating
Super Dragon Balls. Although...

403
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,710
[VEGETA] I can only hope
nothing terrible comes of this.

404
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,750
Can we? Can we compete?
Pretty please?

405
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,380
Really? You want
to be a part of all this?

406
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,850
Yeah, are you kidding me?

407
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:54,820
Fighting the strongest guys
from whole other universes?

408
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,120
Ah! This is what I live for!

409
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,760
[BEERUS]
And what about you?

410
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,390
[VEGETA exhales]

411
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:04,000
[VEGETA] Fighting the very best,
in a completely different realm?

412
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,570
Training is one thing,
but skills honed under

413
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,940
the pressure of actual combat
can truly approach perfection.

414
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,500
Yes. I'm in.

415
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,440
[BEERUS]
Hmmm...

416
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:19,810
All right then.
I could use a good battle!

417
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:22,980
[CHAMPA chuckles]

418
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,420
Splendid!
We have ourselves a deal!

419
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,990
[gasps, sighs]

420
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,590
[sighs]

421
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,960
Ah! Hell yeah!

422
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,310
Goodbye to our adventure

423
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,820
In twilight we must go our separate ways

424
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:57,350
And try to discover the path to our own destiny

425
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,600
I can't find the words

426
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,130
to tell you how much our parting hurts

427
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,630
I hope you know I'll always love you

428
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:07,580
And all that we shared will be remembered

429
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,890
How could I forget your face?

430
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,790
All my memories erased

431
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,870
I can still hear the melody of your voice

432
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,430
Petals fall in from above

433
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,070
Fade away, all that we love

434
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:28,580
In the twilight,

435
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:28,580
fade away,

436
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,580
fade away

437
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:34,990
Sayonara,

438
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,990
fade away,

439
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,990
fade away

440
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,670
Hey, it's me, Goku!

441
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:42,460
You know, I've fought
a lot of battles out in the world

442
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,010
but I think I like fighting
in tournaments even more!

443
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:47,130
And now that one's just around the bend

444
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:50,050
I can't wait to meet our new teammates and get to...

445
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:53,100
Hey, hold up!
There's somebody stronger than me?!

446
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,270
What's this guy's deal, Lord Beerus?

447
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:58,100
Next time on Dragon Ball Super:

448
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:05,500
Make sure you don't miss it, okay?
