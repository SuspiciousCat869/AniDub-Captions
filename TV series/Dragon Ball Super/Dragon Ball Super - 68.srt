Um, sorry Lord Beerus, I, uh,

to do now. But, take your time!

Keep the change.

From all this cash?!

00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,125
Wow. This meat does not
want to come out.

168
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,583
Try this, sir. The Earthlings
have invented a tool

169
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,500
for just such a problem,
which I call

"The Crustacean Thigh
and Leg Extraction Fork".

The Crustacean Thigh
and Leg Extraction Fork.

174
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:57,791
All right now. Speak your wish
and I shall grant it.

175
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:01,791
The last time you
summoned me, I granted one.

176
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,708
That means two wishes remain.

177
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:08,041
Now, speak your next wish.

Yes! He'll bring us back
any second now!

You haven't even
heard my wish yet!

We'd be fools
to let you wish again.

Don't think we've forgotten
your Shenron history.

So, Goku.Why did you
summon Shenron?

192
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,291
What do you need
to wish for now?

193
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:58,291
[GOKU] I'm gonna bring King Kai
and his pals back to life!

194
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,625
Do it! Do it!

195
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:00,875
[A18]
Wait, that's it?

196
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,583
Then that still leaves
one wish, doesn't it?

197
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:03,750
That's right.

198
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,666
Then I want that
last wish for myself!

199
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,208
[ROSHI]
No, I wanna take it!

200
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:10,041
We can't waste a wish on you!
You'll use it to surround

201
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,958
yourself with
a bunch of party girls!

202

You don't know that!

203
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,166
[A18]
My wish is for Krillin.

204
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,041
You understand wanting
to do something nice

205
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,833
for your spouse, right Goku?

206

[GOKU]
Uh, I guess.

207
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,041

so wrong about an old man

he's always wanted?

My dream of world domination

214
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,708
is one wish away
from coming true!

215
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,375
All the time we've spent
at Capsule Corp.

216
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,791
as virtual prisoners,
forced to be good citizens,

217
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,208
has led to this
one moment of redemption!

218
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,541
Considering we eat free
gourmet meals every day

and don't pay rent, I don't
think it's been all that bad.

Eh! Yes, Shu, that is
a fair point. But that's done!

221
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,291
I want you both
to remember this moment

222

as the rebirth of Emperor Pilaf.

Well, good. We've got a big one
we want Shenron to grant!

232
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,291
Why should your wish
go to the front of the line?

233
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,125
Because we're sick and
tired of having to watch

you grown-ups always
get your wishes granted!

It's bad for a child
to think he can get

00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,333
anything he wants in life
simply by wishing for it,

241

actual hard work.

Yo, Shenron!

Here's my wish: I want the three
people on King Kai's world to--

[A18]
Wait, wait, wait, wait, stop!

[KING KAI]
Mm?

320

[A18] If you're waiting this
long to bring back King Kai,

321
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,750
can't we wait a little longer?

322

327
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,708
[GOKU] No way! I made
a promise to King Kai!

[OOLONG] If it's not on paper,
it doesn't count.

00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,750
[ROSHI] Yeah, no judge
would enforce that.

330
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,458
[A18] I don't even know why
he'd want to be revived.

331
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,250
I'm sure the halo
looks great on him.

talk about my wish--

We got here first!

That's why I'm asking Shenron
