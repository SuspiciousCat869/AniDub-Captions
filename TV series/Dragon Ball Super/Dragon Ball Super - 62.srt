160
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,416
[WHIS] Did they mention
anything about the other gods

161
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,916
in that timeline?

162
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,250
Yeah. They mentioned it,
all right.

163
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,208
They said they killed
all the gods,

164
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:38,250
and they were
the only ones left.

165
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,833
Hmm.

166
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,750
[BULMA growls]

167
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,166
[BEERUS]
Mmm.

168
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,666
[VEGETA] And Black's not some
puppet copy of Kakarot,

169
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,125
like we thought.

170
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,916
Zamasu used the
Super Dragon Balls

171
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,833
to steal Kakarot's actual body,

172
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,875
then jumped to Trunk's
alternate timeline,

173
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,708
recruited that Zamasu,
and wished for him

174
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,541
to be indestructible.

175
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,750
[WHIS]
He commandeered Goku's body.

176
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,291
So that's why Black's energy
feels like Zamasu.

177
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,666
Well, that means all our
questions have been answered.

178
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,250
Come on, Whis, we're leaving.

179
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,041
You're just walking away?

180
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:11,375
[BEERUS] I already eliminated
Zamasu from this reality.

181
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,333
If he's running around
a different timeline,

182
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:14,875
that's none of my business.

183
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,333
You people can do
whatever you want from here.

184
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,000
Oh, come on!

185
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,750
[WHIS]
My lord has spoken.

186
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:23,000
Good luck in all your
battles, earthlings.

187
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:27,250
[BULMA gasps]
No more ramen for you!

188
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:29,791
Dad, wait--!

189
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:32,583
[VEGETA] Don't follow me, boy.
I need to think.

190
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:44,125
[GOTEN snoring]

191
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:47,125
[GOTEN]
Uh? Trunks?

192
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,000
[KRILLIN]
Uh, Goku's missing?

193
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,250
[CHICHI]
What else do you call it?

194
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,291
He hasn't come home!

195
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,750
[KRILLIN] Is he still off
dealing with Black?

196
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,708
Usually he comes home
when he's hungry,

197
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,541
so I started cooking
lunch while I waited.

198
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,041
But I just kept
waiting and cooking

199
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,916
and waiting and cooking
and now look how much I made!

200
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
[KRILLIN] Now, that's what
I call a power lunch.

201
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,250
I've called Bulma but I
can't get through to her!

202
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,916
If you know where he is
you better tell me right now!

203
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,666
I have no idea, okay?

204
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,083
You lying to me?

205
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,041
[KRILLIN] Come on, Chichi,
give me some credit.

206
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,750
Do you see the uniform?

207
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:19,333
I am a man of the law,
servant of the people!

208
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:22,250
I would never keep something
from a worried citizen!

209
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,875
[CHICHI grunts]

210
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,125
[KRILLIN chuckles]
And speaking of my sworn duty,

211
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,500
it's time to patrol!

212
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:29,916
Don't you dare!

213
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,666
I'll see ya later,
Chichi, good luck!

214
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,375
[CHICHI]
Krillin!

215
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,041
Come on, Mom,
let me take you home.

216
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,291
You don't have to worry--
Dad'll come home eventually.

217
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,541
He always does.

218
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,416
He should come home now!

219
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,250
--[GOHAN] Huh?
--[CHICHI] Uh!

220
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:48,625
Is that Trunks and Goten?
After bedtime?!

221
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,125
[VEGETA]
Just hang on, Trunks.

222
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:09,083
I'll find a way to
defeat them. I swear it!

223
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,583
[BULMA]
The answer is obviously no!

224
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:13,041
You kids are strong,
but you don't even

225
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:15,000
have a chance against them!

226
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:17,250
They're too powerful,
even for Goku!

227
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:18,250
[VEGETA]
Hm!

228
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:19,583
But we want to do our part!

229
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,708
We can't let them
wreck his future!

230
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,416
[BULMA]
I get how you feel, I do,

231
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,083
but you going there won't help!

232
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,875
Just let Goku handle this!

233
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,416
[TRUNKS] But Mom, big me's
fighting them all alone!

234
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,541
I can't sit around
doing nothing!

235
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,083
[BULMA] Even if I did
think you could help,

236
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,583
can you imagine
what Chichi would do

237
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:37,833
if she found out I let her
precious Goten go to the future?

238
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,083
So for the last time,
leave it to Goku--

239
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,708
he's our best chance!

240
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:44,041
You two can wait here
and see him off, okay?

241
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,333
[TRUNKS]
But Mom!

242
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,625
--[VEGETA] I--!
--[CHICHI] Bulma!

243
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,916
--[BULMA gasps]
--Hey, I'm up here!

244
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,125
Oh. Great, just what I need.

245
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:55,458
You two run and hide, and don't
come out till she's gone!

246
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:59,958
Oh, hey there, Chichi.
What are doing out so late?

247
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,708
Goku is missing. Do you
have any idea where he is?

248
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:05,041
[BULMA]
Goku? Uh, no, beats me.

249
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,708
We're sorry to just
drop in like this, Bulma.

250
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,541
My dad hasn't
been home in a while,

251
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,208
so we're getting
worried, you know.

252
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,291
Yeah, that is a mystery.

253
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,750
[CHICHI] Knowing him,
he's probably gone off

254
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,875
to fight some other
battle-crazed bonehead!

255
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,458
What, at this hour?

256
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:22,291
[chuckles]
Oh, I seriously doubt that!

257
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,750
[CHICHI] What about Trunks and
Goten? Are they out here?

258
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,000
[BOTH]
Eek!

259
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,333
[BULMA] What? Uh. No.
Ha. Why do you ask?

260
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:29,958
[CHICHI]
I saw them flying around.

261
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:33,416
Sneaking out at night, like a
couple of juvenile delinquents!

262
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,083
[SHOU]
Bulma!

263
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,583
Your dad said he successfully
increased the efficiency

264
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,166
of the time machine
fuel production

265
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,041
and it should be ready soon!

266
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,250
Hold on, a time machine?

267
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:47,458
Oh, it's just a code name
for our newest model.

268
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:53,291
[TRUNKS] Uuh! Dad?
Oh no. I mean, hey?

269
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,750
[CHICHI]
Goten! So you are here.

270
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:58,375
What do you think you're
doing out here this late?

271
00:13:58,458 --> 00:13:59,833
Care to explain?!

272
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,666
[BULMA chuckles]
Uh, boys will be boys.

273
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,625
[PICCOLO]
So they're still a threat?

274
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,250
[CHICHI]
What? Who's still a threat?

275
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,333
Bulma, what are you
hiding from me?

276
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,375
[BULMA]
Nothing! I'm hiding nothing!

277
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,250
--[GOKU] Bulma.
--[CHICHI, GOHAN] Huh?

278
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,083
[GOKU] You got anything
good to eat around here?

279
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,541
Now that the pain
is starting to fade

280
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,541
I'm noticing how hungry I am.

281
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:17,750
--[BULMA] Oh, boy.
--[CHICHI] There you are!

282
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:18,916
Oh hey, Chichi.

283
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,291
Goku, why am I
seeing bandages

284
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,208
and a gigantic hole
in your outfit?

285
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:23,958
It's just a little
flesh wound.

286
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,750
I got beat up by my own body!

287
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,291
What the heck does that mean?

288
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:28,500
[laughing]

289
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,791
[GOKU] Hey, Gohan,
are those lunch boxes?

290
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,375
Did you make those for me?

291
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,791
What? Well, yes, but Goku...

292
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,500
[GOKU] Thanks, Chichi!
You're too good to me!

293
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:43,791
Oh man, these are great!
Nobody cooks like you do!

294
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,541
This'll help me feel
a hundred percent in no time!

295
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:47,791
[CHICHI]
Yeah, yeah. Can we get back

296
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,583
to what you were saying, please?

297
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,375
What was I saying? I forget.

298
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,625
[CHICHI] You were telling
me how you got hurt!

299
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,875
[sighs]
Look, here's the truth.

300
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,583
There's something
really bad happening

301
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,625
in the future with older Trunks.

302
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:00,791
[BOTH]
Huh?

303
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,416
After all that mess
with the Androids,

304
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,000
his world's in trouble again?

305
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,750
This time there's a
phony Goku wreaking havoc.

306
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,083
Or to be more accurate,

307
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,125
the Supreme Kai
from the Tenth Universe

308
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,250
stole Goku's body
and now he's using it

309
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,541
to terrorize the entire planet!

310
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,708
That's right. And I swear
I'm gonna make him pay.

311
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:22,625
Not only did he take my body
without even asking,

312
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,291
he killed Goten and Chichi
with my own hands!

313
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:28,208
What?! You mean Goten is dead?

314
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,583
Oh, Goten you didn't tell me.

315
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:33,416
Did it hurt? Was there bleeding?
I don't see a halo.

316
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,666
Are you guys sure?
He looks fine to me!

317
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,833
Now now, calm down, Chichi.
It hasn't happened yet.

318
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,916
It's in the future,
or at least a version of it,

319
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,958
where Zamasu successfully
takes down his master.

320
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,041
That frees him up to
get the Super Dragon Balls

321
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,708
and then Goku's body.

322
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:50,208
I'm lost. Can we see a
flow chart or something?

323
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:53,166
[BULMA] Look, all you need to
know is this Zamasu guy is bad,

324
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,500
and he takes Goku's body--
you with me?

325
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:58,208
Then he crosses timelines
to the version of reality

326
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,916
Trunks is from,
and teams up with

327
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,708
the Zamasu who exists there.

328
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,000
Then they start
decimating Trunks' future!

329
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,166
Trunks takes his time
machine looking for help,

330
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,583
arriving in our timeline
a little while ago.

331
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:11,041
So the reason Goku's
been away from home, Chichi,

332
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,791
is that he and Vegeta
have been traveling

333
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,458
to Trunks' future
to stop these creeps!

334
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,291
[GOHAN] So is that
why Trunks came back here?

335
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,791
[GOHAN]
I had no idea.

336
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,791
Well? So, did you win yet?

337
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,791
Actually, we lost
pretty bad and had to

338
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,333
come back twice already.

339
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:31,250
[BOTH gasp]

340
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,541
Are you kidding me?!

341
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,125
You lost twice to the guy
who killed Goten?

342
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:37,708
Or kills or sometimes
kills or whatever?

343
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,666
As his father
you should be ashamed!

344
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,875
I was watching when
Goku first fought him,

345
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:45,208
and he didn't seem strong enough
to give you this much trouble.

346
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,750
[VEGETA] Trust me.
They're the real deal.

347
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,208
One battle with Kakarot
was enough to show Black

348
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,750
how to reach his own
god-level of Super Saiyan,

349
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:55,083
and he gets stronger each fight.

350
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,875
Then there's the other Zamasu.

351
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:00,125
They used the Super Dragon Balls
to make him indestructible.

352
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,416
And since they're two
versions of the same fighter,

353
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,375
their coordinated attacks
are devastating.

354
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:08,416
I hate to admit it, but we
can't defeat them head-on.

355
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,291
Okay, so then
what can we do?

356
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,875
Figuring that out is the
whole reason we came back!

357
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,000
Well, yelling at him
isn't going to help!

358
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,541
But we have to do
something fast,

359
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,291
or the big me is done for!

360
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,791
Wait, why isn't Trunks here?

361
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,458
He took a stand
against both of them

362
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,291
so that we could get away.

363
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,375
Come on, Dad, there's gotta
be something you haven't tried.

364
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,708
I've been thinking,
and there are other techniques.

365
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:29,958
The problem is
we're dealing with

366
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,708
two strong opponents at once.

367
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:35,250
Fighting to a draw may be the
best we can possibly hope for.

There's one way to win.

370

What, Piccolo? Let's hear it!

371

Containment.

372

Care to elaborate?

373
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,041
There's an ancient
technique called

374
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,125
the Evil Containment Wave
that Master Roshi tried

375
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,791
a long time ago to trap
the old King Piccolo.

376

--[KING PICCOLO screams]

[ALL] King Piccolo?!
Talk about a throwback!

380
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,666
If you can keep them still
long enough to catch them

381
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,125
in the wave and
your aim is right,

382
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,083
then the technique
could trap them both.

383
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,833
[GOKU] Oh right, that was
back when I was just a kid.

384
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:18,208
We wouldn't have to take them
out, we'd just seal them away.

385
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,375
[VEGETA] And you're positive
it would hold them?

386
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:23,083
Yes. If the seal
remains unbroken,

387
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,083
they'll be locked away forever.

388
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,833
Why didn't we
think of this before?

389
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,333
All we have to do
is bottle them up

390
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:29,833
and they'll be gone for good?

391
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,583
Then all those
survivors will be safe,

392
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,333
and they can rebuild the earth!

393

The machine should be
fueled up in about 12 hours.

Going back to the
Hyperbolic Time Chamber?

399
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,583
[VEGETA] Of course.
Maybe we'll seal them.

400
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:53,750
But not until I've given them
my own brand of punishment.

401

The Evil Containment Wave.

How do I do that again, exactly?

403
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,791
[KRILLIN] Master Roshi
can show you, right?
