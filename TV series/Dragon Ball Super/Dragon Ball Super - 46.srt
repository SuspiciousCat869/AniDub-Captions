But don't worry. I'll let him
see me kick your ass

161
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:49,041
before he goes.
Call it a parting gift.

--What do we do?

Here, pop this
into your mouth right now!

164
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,791
This key is instilled
with the same antidote

165
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,458
that sealed the Comméson.

166
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,833
It may be able to buy you
a little more time.

00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,166
[VEGETA] I swear,
I will see this battle

all the way to the end.

171
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,375
[JACO] There's no way
I'm ever gonna see anything

172
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,583
this hilarious again.

173
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,041
Okay...

--Ooh!
--[beeping]

Of all the times, how could
my battery die on me now?

176
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:41,708
Vegeta, I promise you I'll do
everything I possibly can

177
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:44,375
to defeat you
and save your life.

00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,458
[JACO hollers]
It's too dangerous here!

180
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:33,750
We gotta go!

181
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,833
--[TRUNKS] Goten!

[JACO]
Are we really any safer here?

183
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,500
Every minute
their fighting just gets

184
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,458
more and more intense!
And there's no telling

185
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:48,250
how long it's going to take
for them to finish this!

186
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,958
Is there anything else
we can do to save my dad?

187
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,916
[POTAGE]
Ah, I just remembered!

188
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,291
You could help him
by defeating the main body!

189
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,750
[TRUNKS]
The main body?

190
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:59,250
If you can smash the core
of the Comméson life force,

191
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,791
all the duplicates will be
significantly weakened!

192
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,750
[TRUNKS] What? Why didn't
you tell us that earlier?

193
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,000
'Cause I forgot!
It's been a hundred years

194
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:10,083
since I dealt with this--
cut me some slack!

195
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:13,916
The main body. You must be
talking about that big guy.

196
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,541
[POTAGE] Exactly.
The core is in his chest.

197
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,541
[TRUNKS]
Over there!

198
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,291
Potage, you gotta come with us!

199
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:23,458
Yes, of course.

200
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,166
--[TRUNKS] Come on, Goten!
--[GOTEN] Okay!

201
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,375
[JACO] Does seem much safer
over there. I'll go, too--aaah!

202
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:34,500
[TRUNKS] Dad, I swear
I'm gonna save you.

203
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,708
Aaah!

204
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,333
He's gone!

205
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,791
[GOTEN]
Huh, I wonder where he went.

206
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,583
[JACO] Well, you folks are in
luck because you happen to have

207
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:47,083
a super elite galactic
patrolman here with you.

208
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,958
Conducting investigations
is my specialty.

209
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:53,000
No need to worry.
I know the Superhuman Water

210
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,166
wants to obtain
the power up there.

211
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,958
No doubt it's lurking nearby,
waiting for an opportunity.

212
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,625
[JACO] Reasonable assumption.
I can work with that.

213
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,625
You really think it's nearby?

214
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,750
[hollers]

215
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,208
Look out!

216
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:13,875

217
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,583

Wait up, Jaco!

220
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,375
[JACO]
Screw you! I don't wanna die!

221
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:24,708
That thing absorbs your power
just by touching you!

222
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:25,916
Yeah, but so what?

223
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,750
We could easily defeat
a duplicate of you!

224
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,291
What'd you just say?!

225
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:31,875
Jaco!

226
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,875
Aah! Please spare me!

227
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,083
Uh. Huh?

00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,500
[GOTEN]
Ah! It's right behind us!

229
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:40,875
[POTAGE]
Let's get out of here!

230
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:43,375
[TRUNKS] Yeah, there's no way
we can defeat that!

231
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:44,833
[JACO]
Huh?!

232
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,500
Hey, what are you trying to say?

233
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:50,375
My power's not good enough
for you to drain? How rude!

Wow, that was a little
too close for comfort.

243
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:35,708
You almost finished me off
with that attack.

244
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:37,291
You know, this is kinda funny.

245
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,791
Right now, we're in
the middle of a fight

246
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,333
where there's
a halfway decent chance

247
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,666
you could beat me--
which would mean I'd be dead.

248
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,125
And yet, I don't think
I've ever been

249
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,083
more excited in all my life!

250
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,125
I feel the same way, Kakarot.

251
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,708
But unfortunately,
this fight will be our last.

252
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,458
It's bittersweet
to think how we'll never

253
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,541
be able to
battle like this again.

254
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:57,458
Yeah, it's too bad, fake Vegeta.
Though come to think of it,

255
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,791
least if I win I'll still
have the real Vegeta

256

Why? Why am <i>I</i> not the one
up there fighting?

261
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:22,416
It should be me who
defeats Kakarot! Not him!

262
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,416
I deserve this!

263
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,833
We have to smash that core
so Dad won't disappear,
