to their primitive drives.

219
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,875
So that artifact

Yes. But there are
distinct limitations.

[GOWASU] That is not
the purpose of the rings.

[ZAMASU]
Of course.

232
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,291
[GOWASU] Each was created by a
significant change in history,

What does that mean?
"An alternate reality"?

It is possible to effect
the flow of time in a way

237
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,708
that creates a parallel stream.

this has happened

If I put it on my right ear
while its pair is on your left,

we would merge
together, correct?

260
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:29,416
[GOWASU] Yes. It would combine
us together into a single,
