twiddling your thumbs in Hell,
I was busy sparring

40
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,583
with the toughest fighters
from other universes.

41

and the Seventh Universe
had its final member.

Meanwhile, in the Null Realm,

the arena for the Tournament
of Power was at last complete.

fancy as I'd been expecting.

57
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,083
The clash of mighty
warriors should be

the arena in which they fight.

which we can barely imagine.

the pounding it's about to take.

of greeting the Omni-Kings?

67
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,541
Their Majesties wish to
stay in the waiting room.

68
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:07,208
They will relax there
until everyone arrives.

69
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,833
I look forward to this
tournament very much!

[GRAND MINISTER]
Now, Arak. Let's return

73
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:17,291
to your question about the
ring's quality of workmanship.

74
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:18,791
[ARAK]
What?! No, I'm good.

75
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,041
I'm sure he didn't mean
to disparage your work.

76
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,833
Its made of kachi katchintite,

77
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,750
the hardest substance
in the Cosmos,

78
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:27,416
and even stronger than
regular katchintite.

79
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,166
An element that you may
already know from the Seventh.

80
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,000
That's why the ring
will just do fine.

81
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,750
Yes, that makes sense to me.

82
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,291
[GRAND MINISTER] If you're
still doubting, though,

83
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,333
you may test it.

[ALL gasp]

85
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,375
In fact, such an exhibition
may be just what

86
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,666
the Omni-Kings need, as I'm
sure they're quite bored

waiting for the
tournament to start.

Uh, let's not belabor this.

00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,791
[IWAN] I think a pre-tournament
fight is a great idea.

I beg your pardon?

91

it's an outstanding idea.

I'm not so sure about this!

00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,916
I'm always happy to show the
Omni-Kings how right they were

94
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,375
to exempt us from
the Tournament,

95
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,791
as our group is far superior
to those universes

forced to fight for
their survival.

97

Fifth Universe don't want--

at all! Indulge yourselves.

00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,708
Hey, Frieza! You can't pick
fights with your new teammates!

160
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,416
Let me make it perfectly clear:

161
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,250
I don't take orders
from a primate!

162
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:49,750
Goku, are you sure you want
this villain on our team?

163
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:52,541
Don't worry. I'll keep
him in line, Tien.

164
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:55,041
Besides, there's no one
else to take Buu's place.

165
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,458
We don't have any other choice!

166
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:59,333
Poor Yamcha. It's too bad
Goku never asked you

167
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,208
to be their team's
tenth warrior, huh?

168
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,208
Heh! It's probably for the best.

169
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,541
I would have just defeated
everyone too quickly.

170
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,000
[laughs]

171
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,208
[OOLONG sighs]

172
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,125
All right everyone.

173
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,208
Now that we're all
finally in one spot,

174
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,916
let's discuss our strategy
for winning the tournament.

175
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,916
[VEGETA]
There's nothing more to discuss!

176
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,291
[gasps]

177
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,416
We down the strongest
fighters as soon as we can.

178
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,750
That's our strategy.

179
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,250
It's not that simple.

180
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,791
[FRIEZA laughs]

181
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,375
[VEGETA grunts]

182
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,458
Leave it to my former minion to
cut to the heart of the matter.

183
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,750
We're both of the
same opinion on this.

184
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:31,875
[VEGETA growls]

185
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,875
Vegeta, don't you
realize the stakes?

186
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:36,250
If we lose, Trunks and Bulla
will be eliminated,

187
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,791
right alongside us and
the rest of the universe!

188
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,708
[VEGETA grunts]

189
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,416
We all have complicated
relationships with each other,

190
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,250
but if we're gonna win
we're gonna have to do it

191
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,875
with good old-fashioned
team work!

192
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,291
[GOKU]
Gohan's right.

193
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,166
We're going against 70 warriors

194
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,625
and they're all bound
to be super strong!

195
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:58,000
Fine. Since you're all acting
so desperate, I'll listen.

196
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,416
[SUPREME KAI sighs]
As you know,

197
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,458
the Tournament of Power's
a battle royale

198
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:05,166
between teams from eight
distinct universes.

199
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,000
It's important you
conserve your strength.

200
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,083
So form up in a
group, right away.

201
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,625
When enemies approach,
fight as a team.

202
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,083
Avoid all duels.

203
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,875
If one enemy wants to fight,
two of you should engage.

204
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,958
And if it's two enemies, then
three of you should counter.

205
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,291
Uh!

206
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:23,083
Uh, avoiding one-on-one
fights is kinda cowardly.

207
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,583
[gasps]

208
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,541
Yeah, you forget that we Saiyans
are a proud, warrior race.

209
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:30,125
We don't rely on numbers
to win our fights.

210
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,375
[BEERUS growls]

211
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,666
I don't care if it's an
honorable fight or not,

212
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,833
all that matters is that we win!

213
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,291
[PICCOLO grunts]

214
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:40,333
Your father and Vegeta can't
ignore their Saiyan blood.

215
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,583
In other words, they may
fight based on instinct

216
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:43,708
rather than logic.

217
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:46,625
Yeah, I'm assuming
that'll be the case.

218
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,583
But remember,
we're stonger together.

219
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,250
We'll set a good example.

220
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,958
[WHIS] All right,
Team Seventh Universe!

221
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:53,708
It's time to go to
the Null Realm!

222
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,000
To make a long story short,

223
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,750
you're not allowed
to fight alone!

224
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,333
You jerks got that?

225
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:02,125
[WHIS] Okay. I'd like everyone
to join hands and form a circle.

226
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,333
[VEGETA grunts]

227
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:04,416
[VEGETA] Wait, now we're
forming some kind

228
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,500
of friend circle with that punk?

229
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,875
All right! Let's get this
show on the road!

230
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,875
[VEGETA]
Whoa, hold on!

231
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,083
[stammers]

232
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,291
Are you planning on
joining us, Vegeta?

233
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,833
We can't leap away until
we all form a circle.

234
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,458
You're actually making
me hold Frieza's hand?!

235
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,541
[FRIEZA laughs]

236
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:27,041
You don't have to be scared,
Vegeta! I won't bite!

237
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28,166
Scared?!

238
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,166
Did you not just hear
a single word

239
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,875
we said about the importance
of teamwork?!

240
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,958
How's that?
Are you happy now?

241
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,541
[VEGETA grunts]

242
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:37,916
Yeah, yeah, fine.

243
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,375
Greetings, Grand Minister!

244
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:40,916
The warriors of the
Seventh Universe

245
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,208
have assembled and are
ready for transit!

246
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,500
[GRAND MINISTER]
Stand by, please.

247
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:56,041
Good luck, you guys!
We're counting on you!

248
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:09,833
The fate of the world--

249
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:12,541
No, the fate of our
entire universe

250
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,791
rests on those ten souls.

251
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:18,000
You can win this, I know it.

252
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,791
[laughs]

253
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,416
[GOHAN gasps]

254
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,916
[GOHAN]
Wow. So this is the Null Realm?

255
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,458
What's with the flying blocks?

256
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,708
Seems the arena's undergoing
some last-minute construction.

257
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,833
And up there is the crew.

258
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:03,583
[BEERUS]
Why are Destroyers building it?

259
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:09,750
Whoa! The teams from the other
universes are coming in!

260
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,750
[BEERUS]
Hm? Hey, wait.

261
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:16,666
How'd they manage to teleport
without holding hands?

262
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,791
Oh, the hand-holding was just
my way to build team solidarity.

263
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,250
Are you nuts?!

264
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,791
That touchy-feely nonsense
almost tore the team apart!

265
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:27,250
[A18]
Whoa. You guys need to see this!

266
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,125
[gasps]

267
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,041
[KRILLIN whimpers]

268
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,458
[GOKU]
I don't see anything.

269
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,583
[WHIS] Lady and gentlemen,
don't forget--

270
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:35,666
once the Tournament starts,

271
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,833
anyone who falls
from this ring, loses.

272
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:40,291
[GOHAN]
That's... a pretty big drop.

273
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:43,625
Okay, what's to stop us
from flying back up?

274
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,666
[WHIS] The fact that
you won't be able to.

275
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,916
[GOHAN]
Huh?

276
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,500
[GOKU] Is that so?
Let's see if you're right!

277
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:57,208
[GOKU groaning]

278
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,458
Yeah, I can't fly.

279
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,583
[WHIS] The Grand Zenos
have taken measures

280
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:03,041
to disable flying techniques
such as yours.

281
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,375
Since pushing your opponents
out of the ring is key

282
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:08,333
to the competition that...
only makes sense.

283
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:09,958
How come those guys're flying?

284
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,208
[GROUP]
Uh?

285
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:16,708
Their flight is an inherent
physical ability

286
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:19,458
and not an acquired power
using energy manipulation.

287
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,416
And in a similar
matter of fairness,

288
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,250
I should note that
the gravity here

289
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:24,916
is set to affect each
fighter's body

290
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,666
in the same way it does on
the world of their birth.

291
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,708
[GOKU]
Aw...

292
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,916
Well, then, we must
be going now.

293
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,250
Lord Beerus and I will be
in the spectator seating.

294
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,666
Wait, why do you get to fly?!

295
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,458
It's only the contestants
who are banned

296
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:37,833
from using that power, my lord.

297
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:40,000
The moment of truth is here.
Good luck to you all.

298
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,208
Yeah. Just leave it to us!

299
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:44,458
[FROST]
Well, what have we here?

300
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:45,791
Huh...?

00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:48,250
Hey, it's that Sixth
Universe Frieza!

Hmph.

00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:59,041
Now where is he.

306
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,458
Yo, Hit! How's it goin'?

00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,416
Great. It's him.

308
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,666
[CABBA] Vegeta! It's really
good to see you again!

309
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,291
How are you, Master?

310
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,791
Don't call me that!

311
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,291
Glad ya made it, Cabba! Feeling
good about the Tournament?

312
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,458
[CABBA]
You bet!

313
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,291
Well, introduce the
rest of your team!

314
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:19,791
Oh, right. This is Caulifla,

With some last minute training,

I'd describe our physical

00:22:59,666 --> 00:23:03,500
Everyone's powered up and
pounding away and it is awesome!

475
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:05,000
Hey, what do you want?

476
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,791
You think you can
take me out like that?

477
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:08,166
Well, think again!

478
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,291
There're so many
other guys I wanna fight,

479
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:12,000
I'm just gettin' started!

480
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:14,666
Watch out, everyone!
I'm comin' in hot!

481
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,750
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

482
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:19,791
"Survive! The Tournament
of Power Begins at Last!"

483
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:21,625
Make sure you don't
miss it, okay?
