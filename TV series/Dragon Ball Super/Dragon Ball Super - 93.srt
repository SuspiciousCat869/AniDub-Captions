[NARRATOR] Previously,
on Dragon Ball Super,

26
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:46,916
Goku and his allies
had finally assembled

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,083
their full ten-member roster
for the Tournament of Power.

28
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:53,333
But with mere hours before
the battle royal began,

29
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:57,208
Buu fell into a deep sleep,
leaving them one fighter short.

30
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:58,708
At the same time,

31
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:01,666
the group discovered Goku
had lied when recruiting them,

32
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:05,125
and the winning team would not
receive ten million zeni each.

33
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,500
[BULMA] Okay, fine.
I'll pay the ten million zeni

34
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:08,791
to anyone who wants it.

35
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:10,708
[NARRATOR] Thanks to
Bulma's generous offer,

36
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:12,375
one crisis was averted.

37
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,791
But that still left
Buu's spot to fill.

38
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:17,333
Without ten fighters they
would be disqualified,

39
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:19,250
and their Universe would
be destroyed.

thinks of himself,

00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:37,875
Looks more like a heaven
than a hell to me.

321
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,041
Are you sure this is where
you're keeping him?

322
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,708
[BLUE OGRE] Yes. You'll find
him on that tree over there.

323
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:43,958
Just be careful.

324
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,500
Awesome. Thanks.

325
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:46,916
I will.

326
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,500
Yo!

327
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:03,791
[FRIEZA]
Mm?

328
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,541
My, my. Look what
the Fates dragged in.

329
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,000
[GOKU]
Hmph.

330
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,583
What's with this place?

331
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:21,250
It's supposed to be punishment,
but it seems downright pleasant.

332
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:25,625
[FRIEZA] I'm afraid that for me
there could be no greater Hell.

333
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:26,875
Now out with it.

334
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,166
What brings you to my tree?

335
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,666
So, I got a proposition
for you, Frieza.

336
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,750
[FRIEZA]
Hm...?

[GOKU]
How'd you like a 24-hour pass?

338
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:43,916
[FRIEZA] Has the dull-witted
primate come up with a scheme?

339
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,916
[GOKU]
Hmph. You could say that.

I can feel the power pouring out
of you, and it's incredible!

00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:13,083
You're dead, Cabba!

349
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,166
Move!

350
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,375
Huh!

00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:24,250
What'd you do?!
Why is she outta control?

353
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,833
[CABBA]
I didn't do anything!

354
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:28,125
My guess is she saw you
and me working together,

355
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,375
and felt left behind--

356
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,333
like she's angry I was
going to replace her!

357
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:32,583
Wha--?!

358
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,583
All I know for sure is
we have to reel her in.

let me stop you right there!

You think my standards
are so low

378
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,625
I'd be attracted to
this little dweeb?

the universe to me!

between the two of us.

She's unbelievable.

387
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,541
I came for one strong ally,

388
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:00,083
but it seems I've
stumbled upon another.

389

[CAULIFLA laughs]

390
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:17,000
[FRIEZA]
A Tournament of Power.

391
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:20,208
You spin quite a fascinating
tale, monkey.

392
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,208
Rife with exhilaration.

393
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,333
So, you in?

394
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:27,583
[FRIEZA] Will you be oh-so-
disappointed if I decline?

395
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,333
[GOKU]
A little, yeah.

396
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,000
Well, then...

397
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,458
...in that case, I decline.

398
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,166
[GOKU]
Okay, fine. Suit yourself.

399
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,833
Ah...

400
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:41,250
I'm joking--don't go!

401
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,291
Once the 24 hours expire,

402
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,833
I'll return to this
foul prison, correct?

403
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:50,500
That's the best I can offer.

404
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,333
Take it or leave it.

405
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:55,708
All right. But on one condition:

406
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:58,791
If in the end we
prove victorious,

407
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:02,125
and our Universe remains intact,

408
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:06,541
you will use the Dragon Balls
to truly bring me back.

409
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:07,916
Come on, Frieza.

410
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,666
You seriously think
you're in a position

411
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,750
to bargain for
something like that?

412
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:17,541
[FRIEZA] Though my body has
been idle, my mind has not.

413
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:20,166
I've devised new
ways to improve.

414
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,125
[FRIEZA grunts]

415

[FRIEZA yells]

416
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:34,458
I spend every tortured
hour in this hellscape

417
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:37,416
dreaming of fighting you again.

418
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,750
[GOKU]
Hmph.

419
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,458
[FRIEZA] You want to know if
my new strength could push you,

420
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,916
as it did so long ago.

421
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,250
Don't you, monkey?

422
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,250
[GOKU] Leave it to the biggest
villain in the Universe

423
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,666
to exploit my biggest weakness.

424
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,250
You know me too well.

425
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:59,125
[FRIEZA laughs]
Do we have a deal?

426
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:02,958
[GOKU] The prize for
the most valuable fighter

427
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,541
in the Tournament is
the Super Dragon Balls.

428
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:09,000
Get them yourself, and you can
wish for whatever you want.

429
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,875
[FRIEZA] You seem to imply that
even if our Universe prevails,

430
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:14,041
the spoils may not be for me.

431
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,291
But I don't need a "Super"
wish to revive me.

432
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:20,083
The Earth Dragon Balls
will perfectly suffice.

433
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,125
[GOKU] You saying you're
on board or not?

434
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:25,916
[FRIEZA] Hm... I am if you'll
make me that promise.

435
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,541
Okay, Frieza. I promise.

436
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,333
If we win, I'll bring you back.

437
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:33,958
Of course, it might take me
some time to gather them all.

438
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,291
I understand.

439
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,041
And don't try to run away.

440
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:40,500
If we lose, our Universe
is done so there's no point.

441
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,875
[FRIEZA]
I have no death wish, Saiyan.

442
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:46,083
Actually, speaking of death...

443
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:49,125
What are the rules
of this tournament?

444
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,750
Can we fight to kill?

445
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,500
Sorry to disappoint, but no.

446
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,875
Pity, that does
complicate things.

447
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:58,541
Oh, well. You can't
have everything.

448
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,041
[GOKU]
See ya soon.

449
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:05,250
Aw. Are you leaving already?

450
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:09,000
[GOKU] Yeah. Fortuneteller
Baba will come for you later.

451
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,041
Yo, Baba! What's up?!

452
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,750
Don't act all casual
with me, Goku!

453
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,833
If you're gonna ask me
to bring back that tyrant

454
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,166
you can show some respect!

455
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,875
Whoa. How'd you know?

456
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:24,041
King Yemma already told me.

457
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,416
I don't like this.

458
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,541
But if our fate depends on it,
then I can't say no.

459
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:31,166
[GOKU] Great! I knew I
could count on you, Baba!

460
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,541
Thanks a lot!

461
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,333
[BABA]
So about my payment...

462
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:35,958
Huh?

463
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:38,041
Oh, yeah! Here ya go, Baba!

464
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,291
Take this!

465
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:40,750
[BABA]
What is it?

466
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,458
[GOKU]
There are these Grand Zeno guys,

467
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,458
and they're in charge of,
like, everything!

468
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:47,250
Press this button, and you can
meet 'em anytime you want!

469

[BABA grunts] Why would I
want that, nincompoop?

470
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,375
You think I want
'em to smite me?

471
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:55,750
[GOKU] Okay, I'll bring
you somethin' later.

472
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,875
See ya, Baba!

[GANOS]
My view of the Seventh, sir...

474
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,791
We need to be careful,
or they could surprise us.

475
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,041
Well, what do you think?

476
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,125
Do you have any
grand ideas, my Lord?

477
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:10,416
An evil emperor, plucked out
of Hell to join their team?

478
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,916

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,208
Relax, Kuru. I've thought
of an absolutely brilliant way

480
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:16,375
to stop the Seventh!

481
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:17,833
And what would that be?

482
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm so sorry, Lord Beerus.

483
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:24,041
If one of us must go,
it won't be me. Heh.

484
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,166
[NARRATOR]
Goku has successfully recruited

485
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,708
the evil emperor Frieza
to complete his team.

486
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,583
Meanwhile, Lord Quitela,

487
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,541
the Destroyer of
the Fourth Universe,

488
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,500
has learned of this move
thanks to his spy,

489
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:40,041
and seems to have devised a
plan to defeat the Seventh.

490
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:43,166
What exactly could
his strategy be?

491
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,250
One hour and 30 minutes remain

492
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:47,625
until the Tournament
of Power begins.

493
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:51,041
Next time on Dragon Ball Super!

494
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:54,333
<i>Boogie Back!</i>

495
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:05,458
<i>Wish we had better timing</i>

496
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:09,291
<i>To explore this attraction</i>

497
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:12,666
<i>Put on a smile, it's showtime</i>

498
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:16,333
<i>And I'm just playing a part</i>

499
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:20,375
<i>Let's get lost in the rhythm,</i>
<i>dancing dancing heart</i>

500
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:23,500
<i>Head over heels</i>
<i>I'm falling falling down</i>

501
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:24,583
<i>(Boogie Back!)</i>

502
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:27,208
<i>My heartbeat</i>
<i>keeps growing faster</i>

503
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:30,958
<i>Every step that I take</i>
<i>brings me back to you</i>

504
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:31,958
<i>(Boogie Back!)</i>

505
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:34,625
<i>Give me happy ever after</i>

506
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:39,458
<i>Let the dream</i>
<i>of our love come true</i>

507
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:41,333
<i>Boogie Back!</i>

508
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:43,166
<i>Boogie Back!</i>

509
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:48,791
<i>Boogie Back!</i>

510
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:50,750
<i>Boogie Back!</i>

511
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,708
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

512
00:22:56,791 --> 00:22:58,458
Frieza's the only
fighter I can think of

513
00:22:58,541 --> 00:22:59,958
who could take Buu's place,

514
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:01,833
but that comes
with plenty of risk--

515
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:04,000
there's no telling what
he'll try to pull.

516
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:06,083
We have to find an edge
for the tournament,

517
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:09,041
but let's just hope this
doesn't blow up in my face.

518
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:10,208
Hey, Frieza!

519
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:11,666
What do you mean
you're warming up?

520
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,500
You just can't kill people!

521
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:17,541
Next time, on Dragon Ball Super:
"The Evil Emperor Returns!

522
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:20,375
A Reception from
Mysterious Assassins?"

523
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:22,041
Make sure you don't
miss it, okay?
