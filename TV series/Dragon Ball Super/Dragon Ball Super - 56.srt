[GOKU BLACK laughing]

320
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,583
[GOKU BLACK] At last, I have not
only mastered Goku's powers,

321
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,333
I have made them my own.

322
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,375
[GOKU BLACK laughs]

323
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:39,541
[GOKU BLACK]
Go on, Goku! Rejoice!

324
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,625
Only through me will you finally
reach the pinnacle of beauty

325
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,458
you have sought
for so very long.

326
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,291
I don't know what
you're rambling on about,

327
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:49,125
but just get on with the fight.

328
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:51,791
Of course you don't.
Your mind is too small.

329
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,958
Your kind is incapable
of understanding

330
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:57,083
the grandeur of my success
and the glory of my cause.

331
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:58,875
It's like staring into the sun.

332
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,750
You cannot see.

333
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:04,791
The vast beauty of
my being overwhelms you.

334
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:08,958
For I am a breed apart.
And Divine.

335
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:12,041
[GOKU] He's startin'
to rub me the wrong way.

336
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,791
--[VEGETA] Black!
--[GOKU BLACK] Hm?

337
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,208
[VEGETA] What are you doing
talking to Kakarot?!

338
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,458
You're supposed
to be fighting me!

339
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,666
[GOKU BLACK] Aw, you don't
you understand, Saiyan.

340
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,625
Your time is already at an end.

341
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,125
[VEGETA]
Like hell it is!

342
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:25,541
[GOKU BLACK]
You were the opening act.

343
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,250
Now leave the stage.

344
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,666
[yells]

345
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,875
You don't know your place!

346
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,625
Get outta there!

347
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,458
[yells]

348
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,791
[VEGETA]
I'm not the opening act.

349
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:51,708
I'm the star of this damn show!

350
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:52,791

[BOTH gasp]

353
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:06,291
You... How'd you do that?

354
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:11,333
Calling you the opening
act is a weak metaphor.

355
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,875
It's much more like...

356
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:14,791
...you're just the appetizer.

357
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:17,083
That's right,
a light introduction

358
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,791
before I commence
with the main course.

359
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:23,333
Why... you vile bastard!

360
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,375
[FUTURE TRUNKS]
Father!

361
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,125
[GOKU BLACK laughing]

362
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:37,958
You've helped refine my palette
and made me that much stronger.

363
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,041
Now watch as I consume
the main dish

364
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,875
and rise to an even greater
level of power still!

365
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:45,333
I can hardly wait.

366
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:46,583
I'm going in.

367
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:47,916
Stay back!

368
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,583
Goku, wait!

369
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,583
[yells]

370
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:57,333
[FUTURE TRUNKS]
Super Saiyan Blue.

371
00:19:57,416 --> 00:20:00,583
He's going into the fight
already at full power.

372
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,583
[GOKU]
Trunks, go check on Vegeta.

373
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,333
[FUTURE TRUNKS]
Uh. Right!

374
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:09,041
I take it this is what
you meant when you said

375
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:12,875
that any pain I inflict
will only make you stronger?

376
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:15,083
[GOKU BLACK] I am already
at a level no mortal

377
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,250
can even dream of reaching.

378
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,041
I see it in your face.

379
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,916
You crave a taste of
this power, don't you?

380
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,958
Yeah. You may be right!

381
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:29,041

382
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,916

Father!

00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,375
Father.

384
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,625
They're equal.

385
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,166
[VEGETA]
No, they're not.

386

He's strong!

387
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:06,541
A Kamehame-Ha?

388
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,041

That's enough!

00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:10,875
[GOKU]
Hm?

391
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:15,291
[VOICE] I will not allow you
to act on your own any further.

392
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,708
Is that Zamasu?

393
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:28,333
No way. It can't be.

394
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,083
[gasps]

395
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,583
Looks like I was
wrong about them.

396
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:40,625
Black and Zamasu
aren't the same guy.

397
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,875
[FUTURE ZAMASU]
I thought we had an agreement.

398
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:45,875
Wasn't <i>I</i> supposed
to be the one...

399

of destroying him?

Hey! It's me, Goku!

And talk about a
time-twisting surprise!

421
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:48,666
Zamasu isn't Black,
but he's working with <i>him</i> ?

422
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,916
I better keep my head on
straight against this pair,

423
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,375
or I'm gonna be in trouble.

424
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:54,250
And Trunks has gotta help, too!

425
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:57,208
But it looks like our attacks
don't work on Zamasu at all,

426
00:22:57,291 --> 00:22:58,958
so what do we do now?

427
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:01,208
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

428
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:05,666
"A God with an Invincible Body.
The Advent of Zamasu."

429
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,000
Make sure you don't
miss it, okay?
