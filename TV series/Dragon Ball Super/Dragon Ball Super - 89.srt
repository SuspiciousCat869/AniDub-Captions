[NARRATOR] Previously,
on Dragon Ball Super,

26
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:56,000
Gohan approached Piccolo
about entering

27
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,625
the Tournament of Power,

28
00:01:57,708 --> 00:02:01,416
and wound up training
under his former teacher.

29
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,833
Overcoming the weaknesses that
Piccolo pointed out to him,

30
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:09,416
Gohan regained the power he
had demonstrated in the past.

31
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,625
Listen.

32
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:12,041
I believe that what
you tapped into today

33
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:14,708
was actually a fraction
of your latent power.

34
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:18,583
We pushed through one wall
and now I wanna find the next.

35
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:23,416
We still have a little time.
Let's put it to good use.

00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,125
You wanna be stronger than
you've ever been, right?

Yeah. Let's do it!

Working with Piccolo,

Gohan has set his sights
on getting even stronger.

Meanwhile, the other universes

There is one way I
can help you, though.

43
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:45,458
The fighter you should be
recruiting is Caulifla.

Let's see, since Piccolo
already told me

49
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,041
he would join the team,

50
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,333

Huh? Whaddaya mean he's gone?

53
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:19,125
Tien invited Roshi
to his new dojo.

54
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:22,041
Somethin' about becoming
an honorary grand master.

Wait, you mean to tell me
Tien has a dojo, now?

and they go and
become a bigshot.

00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,375
But before we do,

164
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,333
we'd better drive
out that darkness

[TIEN]
I see.

204
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:48,750
You came to invite both
Master Roshi and myself.

So you're gonna
enter, aren't you?

Uhh.

While fighting the best that the
other universes have to offer

00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,041
would make for
excellent training,

210
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,125
I'm afraid I can't just
pick up and abandon

my own students
and their training.

Oh, come on, can't you just
hire a substitute for a while?

213

If you win, you get
ten million zeni,

so you could totally afford it!

Money's not the issue, Goku.

You'll never touch anyone again!

[GOKU]
Hey, it's me, Goku!

482
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:05,000
I wanted to find some
stronger opponents to fight,

483
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:07,458
but who knew they'd turn
out to be so close?

484
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:10,583
[GOHAN] Finally, I've
achieved my ultimate form.

485
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:14,208
So come on, Dad, I want you
to fight me at full strength.

486
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:16,041
I'm ready to surpass you!

487
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:18,458
[GOKU] Okay, let's have
an all-out battle!

488
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:20,791
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

489
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:25,125
"Staring Down the Wall to be
Overcome! Goku vs. Gohan!"

490
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:27,125
Make sure you don't
miss it, okay?
