[NARRATOR] Previously,
on Dragon Ball Super,

18
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,541
the battle between
Goku and Black was cut short

19
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:56,083
when Black was yanked
back into the future,

20
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:57,833
but not before
the doppelganger

21
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:00,416
destroyed Trunks' time machine.

22
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,166
Then Bulma had a surprise:

23
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,208
she still had
the damaged time machine

24
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,208
Cell had hijacked
from his own dark timeline,

25
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:09,333
and Bulma could use
the notes and software

26
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:11,958
from the future
to get it working again.

27
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:14,750
Meanwhile, the older Trunks
realized that Mai,

28
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:18,416
his closest ally in the future,
had a present-day counterpart.

29

I'm glad you're here.

[NARRATOR] As older Trunks
quickly bonded with Mai,

you're quite the chef.

Aw thanks. If you enjoyed it,
we should do it again sometime.

Yeah, absolutely.

I'm really glad
I got to see you, Gohan.

I feel the same way.
It was such a treat.

Good night, you guys.

I just realized, we got
so carried away talking,

00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:57,041
I didn't even ask
why he came back in time.

Honestly, I forgot
to ask him that, too.

Thank you, Gohan.

You have no idea
how much that meant.

It's clearer to me now.

What I'm actually fighting for.

Just you watch.
I will defeat Black.

And win back a world
where everyone can live,

get you some more?

for the Tenth Universe.

But apparently Black's energy

reminded Whis and Beerus
of someone there.
