00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,333
Well my goodness, Lord Beerus.

165
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:09,625
I never expected you to
take such an extreme measure.

166
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,666
The surprises continue.

167
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,833
[panting]

168
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I've neutralized
the energy that had built up

169
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:30,041
between us, so we can
resume with a clean slate.

170
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,833
But how, where did it go?

171
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:34,625
Not your concern.
It's a complicated technique,

172
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:37,250
requiring a one hundred
percent power up.

173
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,916
[GOKU]
You powered up just now?

174
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,541
Yes.

175
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,375
They almost
destroyed the universe,

176
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,958
and Beerus wasn't even
using all his power?

177
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:47,708
You're saying after all that,
with me barely hanging on,

178
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,416
you were still
holding back your power?

179
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,041
Would've been sad otherwise,
don't you think?

180
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,708
I'm a Destroyer,
elite among gods.

181
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,375
I can't max out
against some Saiyan deity.

182
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,583
Using full power to
defeat you would have been

183
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:02,625
too humiliating to take. It
would have been better to die.

184
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,041
Ahhh!

185
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,291
So that's what this is about?
Protecting your image?

186
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:09,875
Yes. Or at least that's how
I felt until this moment.

187
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,208
But now...

188
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,291
Errr--I don't care about
the embarrassment anymore!

189
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,875
The other gods can think what
they want, say what they want,

190
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,500
laugh all they want;
I don't care!

191
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:22,000
All that matters to me now
is beating you, Saiyan!

192
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,500
I'll use everything I have,
every depth of power,

193
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,625
as long as I can crush you!

194
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:27,875
[GOKU]
Huh?

195
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,583
[panting]

00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,000
[chuckles]

197
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,291
All right, Beerus,
let's do this.

198
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:34,875
Why are you smiling like that?

199
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:38,250
Were you holding back too?
Is that possible?

200
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,958
No, I was using
every bit of power I had.

201
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,458
Some... new strategy then?

202
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:46,375
I'm out of those too.
I've tried every one.

203
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,333
[BEERUS]
Hmmm.

204
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:53,041
You're a strange one,
aren't you?

205
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,708
I guess so.
And I could say

206
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,791
the same thing
about you, Beerus.

207
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:17,041
[GOKU groans]

208
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,333
Come on, I thought
we were past the cheap shots.

209
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,041
t's not my fault
you have a bad habit

210
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,083
of dropping your guard.

211
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:28,375
You clearly weren't bluffing
about having more power.

212
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,000
Your punches
are totally different

213
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,958
than five minutes ago,
it's incredible!

214
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,583
If you haven't noticed,
your strength

215
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,208
is still increasing too!

216

[GOKU groans]

217
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:40,541
[yells]
Here you go!

218
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,708
One hundred percent!

219
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,791
Believe me, I'm not
holding back either!

220
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:10,416
Here's one you won't
be able to dodge.

221
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,833
Huh?!

222
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,166
[GOKU grunts]

223
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,458
Let me go!

224
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,791
Not today!

225
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:27,708

[groans]

227
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,666
Head-butting
is for street fights,

228
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,291
not a battle of gods!

229
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,916
Yeah well,
it worked, didn't it?

230
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,250
Didn't even hurt.

231
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,833
You liar.

232
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,666
They're both
fighting harder now,

233
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,750
channeling more
divine energy than ever.

234
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,458
But they aren't
making any shockwaves,

235
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,583
like all the force is going
straight into each other.

236
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:52,875
Why would that be?

237
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,666
The shockwaves were a show.

238
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,750
[KIBITO KAI]
Huh?

239
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,375
And now...
they're both just fighting

240
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,291
like they want it to end.

241
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,958
Hm? Seems your time's up.

242
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm going to pretend
I didn't hear that.

243
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,250
[yells]

244
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:11,416
[sighs]

245

Listen, there's nothing
to be ashamed of.

246
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:14,916
What?

247
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,875
Again and again,
you've managed to overcome

248
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,125
your own limitations
and reached heights

249
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,041
no Saiyan mortal should.

250
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,791
Though your divinity
was borrowed,

251
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:25,458
you challenged me like few have.

252
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:28,458
It's a magnificent achievement.

253
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:31,291
Would you please stop
talking to me like it's over?

254
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,791
Well that was crazy.
Right guys?

255
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,916
That looked scary,
everyone okay?

256
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,125
Yeah, I'm not sure
what happened but it was fun!

257
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,833
Hey! It's Dad,
I feel him again!

258
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:07,416
Me too. But hold on,
if we can sense his energy...

259
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,000
...then that
would mean he's...

260
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,291
Yes, your deduction is accurate.

261
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:14,375
As established, you couldn't
sense him in this battle

262
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,291
because his energy was divine.

263
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,083
You sense him now
because he has reached

264
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:20,625
the time limit of the power
that ceremony afforded him

265
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,666
and returned
to his normal range.

266
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:27,000
He is again a Super Saiyan,
no longer a god.

267
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,416
If that's true, then--

268
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,000
But my dad
can still win, can't he?

269
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,125
[WHIS]
I'm afraid not.

270
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,291
Cheer up. He doesn't
know your dad.

271
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,125
You know, you were wrong before!

272
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:46,958
You said our
solar system would blow up

273
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,416
and maybe
the universe too,

274
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,000
but then nothing happened!
And you're wrong now!

275
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,333
Well, that's fair enough.

276
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,291
I'm not all-knowing and
though it's most unlikely,

277
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:55,708
I do hope you're right.

278
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,875
My lord hasn't been this
active in nine hundred years,

279
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,000
and that makes him
even more unpredictable.

280
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:03,166
So I suppose there's a small
chance we can cling to.

281
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,666
But in any case,

to commemorate this planet

so I should be heading out now.

Stay here. We're telling you
it's not over yet.

remove your hand.

[PICCOLO grunts]

00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,958

What was that for?

00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,791
[PICCOLO] Was that
some sort of message?

Is he suggesting there's
nothing to worry about?

[BEERUS]
I cherish my strength.

But it comes with
its own breed of sadness.

Once again, I must
bid farewell to an opponent

Just look, you idiot!

The glowing red aura of your
Super Saiyan God power is gone.

didn't notice that?

Well, no. When did
it happen? That's strange.

I guess I did lose it but
I'm not feeling weaker at all.

What's going on, Lord Beerus?

316
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,875
How the hell should I know?

317
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:46,250
[GOKU] I don't know.
Don't gods know that stuff?

318
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,916
Ahem.

319
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,208
Even though the Super
Saiyan God power expired,

320
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,375
your body has learned
from the experience

321
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,291
of fighting in god form.

322
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,500
Merely feeling that level
of power was enough

00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,083
to push you to new heights.

324
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:02,083
In a sense, the god power
is part of you now.

325
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:04,833
The red glow of Saiyan
divinity may have left you,

326
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:08,666
but the strength now burns
within you like a flame.

327
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,250
Am I wrong?

328
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:14,166
Well, honestly I don't know.

329
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,833
And it doesn't matter, right?

330
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:18,458
All that matters is that
I can still win this thing.

331
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:22,875
Oooh! Why have I allowed
myself to dignify such a fool?

332
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:24,083
Am I missing something,

333
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,500
because I think
I'm getting a bit lost.

334
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,083
I should be careful.

335
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,958
Or your battle-obsessed
simplemindedness

336
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,333
could rub off on me.
[chuckles]

337
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:34,958
Although, seeing how I've
acted, maybe it already has.

338
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:37,333
I'm getting antsy here.
Can we get back to the fight?

339
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:41,125
Sure. Bring it on.

340
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:48,291
[bellows]

341
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:54,041
[yells]

342
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,000
[GOKU chuckles]

343
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:18,958
[laughs]

344
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:23,916
[BOTH laugh]

345
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:27,083
[screams]

346
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:29,250
[yells]

347
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,125
[NARRATOR] Our hero's time
as a diety is gone,

348
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,750
but his incredibly
enhanced power is not,

349
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:39,416
ushering in a new era
of Saiyan might.

350
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:43,375
It's no longer god versus god,
but god versus Goku.

351
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:45,958
To this point, they've been
showing off their powers,

352
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,875
but now they're both
ready to move in

353
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,416
for the knockout blow.

354
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,000
Only one question remains.
Who will win this fight?

355
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:57,041
The thrilling conclusion,
next time on Dragon Ball Super!

356
00:21:57,666 --> 00:22:00,958
<i>I look back</i>
<i>to when I was young</i>


357
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:04,083
<i>Reminisce on all that I've done</i>


358
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:06,458
<i>In my hands, I held</i>


359
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:11,208
<i>The dreams of my childhood,</i>
<i>that now've come to pass</i>


360
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:14,750
<i>So let's ride upon</i>
<i>the wind and journey to</i>


361
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,375
<i>A world we've never known</i>


362
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:23,000
<i>(It's a brand new story)</i>
<i>Now, a new chapter starts</i>


363
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,375
<i>Shining Star</i>


364
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:27,208
<i>In the night be</i>
<i>my compass and guide</i>


365
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:30,458
<i>Take me to where I belong</i>


366
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:33,625
<i>The warmth we once shared</i>
<i>Will always be there</i>


367
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:36,250
<i>Its magic lives on in our hearts</i>


368
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:37,416
<i>Shining Star</i>


369
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,208
<i>Give me strength</i>
<i>from your light up above</i>


370
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:43,208
<i>Show me the way to be brave</i>


371
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:49,458
<i>My hands still hold onto hope</i>
<i>that together we'll manifest</i>


372
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:54,333
<i>All that we dreamed of</i>


373
00:23:00,958 --> 00:23:02,375
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

374
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:04,125
And I've had a lot
of fun in this fight,

375
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:06,166
but I know when
it's time to get serious.

376
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,750
I don't care
how strong Beerus is,

377
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:09,208
I won't let him
blow up this planet

378
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:11,833
and everybody I love like
it's some meaningless rock!

379
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:16,166
The divine energy is gone, but
he still has to get through me!

380
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,375
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

381
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:22,000
"This Is All the Power I've Got!
A Settlement between Gods!"

382
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:23,833
You've been through
this whole battle with me.

383
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:25,833
Make sure you don't
miss the end!
