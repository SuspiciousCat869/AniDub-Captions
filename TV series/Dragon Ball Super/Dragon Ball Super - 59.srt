[NARRATOR] Previously,
on Dragon Ball Super,

18
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:53,541
Goku, Vegeta, and Trunks
journeyed to the future

19
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:56,875
to face Goku Black, but found
the mysterious lookalike

20
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:59,958
had reached an overwhelming
new level of power.

21
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:01,791
And the battle
turned even more dire

22
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:05,958
when Zamasu appeared with
a seemingly indestructible body.

23
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:09,166
In a narrow escape, the Saiyan
trio returned to the present,

24
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,875
where they spoke with Whis
and arrived at a new theory--

25
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:14,291
that present-day Zamasu
will take the Time Ring

26
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:17,166
from his master then
use the Super Dragon Balls

27
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,041
to create Goku Black.

28
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:22,125
You believe Gowasu, Supreme Kai
of the Tenth Universe,

29
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,791
is in imminent danger,
is that what you're suggesting?

Supreme Kai have
raced to Gowasu's home,

32
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:33,291
where they will

meddlers doing here?

36
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,166
Well, what a pleasant
surprise this is.

37
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,125
It's the Supreme Kai
of the Seventh Universe

38
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,541
along with its
Destroyer Lord Beerus,

39
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:20,375
his attendant Whis,
and, let's see...

40
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,500
You were, Goku, correct?

41
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:23,791
[GOKU]
Huh?

42
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:27,125
I didn't realize you were here.

43
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:30,916
Please forgive me
for not greeting you sooner.

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,166
Now tell me, to what do we owe
this delightful second visit?

45
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,416
Last time you were investigating
the sudden appearance

46
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,333
of someone in your universe
wearing a Time Ring--

47
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:40,625
which, incidentally, allowed me

48
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,208
to learn about
that curious artifact.

49
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:46,458
And you were checking with
all the other universes, too.

50
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:53,750
Have you learned anything more
about this fascinating mystery?

51
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,625
Their reason
is now more focused.

52
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:58,041
This time they've
come to see you.

53
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,041
[ZAMASU]
Huh? But what for?

54
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,541
It's embarrassing.
But this punch-happy fool here

55
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,666
won't stop begging me
to fight you again,

56
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,458
so I said I'd ask,
just to shut him up.

57
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,583
I tried to tell him
you were far too busy.

58
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,041
But once he gets an idea
in his head, there's no point.

59
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,083
Nuh-uh. What are
you talking about?

60
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,916
Ow! Hey, easy!

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,250
Why'd you punch me again?
What did I do now?

62
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,000
I thought I told you
not to say a word!

63
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,416
[GOKU]
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

64
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,416
But you still
didn't have to hit me!

65
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,833
Have you ever heard
of a friendly reminder?

66
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:29,541
I'm being "friendly"
by not destroying you!

67
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:32,708
[ZAMASU] Perhaps they're more
capable than I thought.

68
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,791
If that's what you want,
then I'd be happy to.

00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,000
[ALL]
Hm?

70
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,708
Last time I was too reluctant.

71
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,208
I simply forgot how hard it is

72
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,666
for mortals
to restrain themselves.

73
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,416
A good host does not disappoint
his guests. Let's begin.

00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,833
[BEERUS] No, no! You're clearly
in the middle of your tea time--

75
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:50,000
it was our impropriety
for coming uninvited to ask.

76
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:52,208
I'll be sure to give this one
a severe chewing out

77
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:53,500
when we get back home.

78
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,000
Oh, my lord, look at the time.

79
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,333
I didn't realize
it had gotten so late!

80
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:58,708
We're completely off schedule,

81
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:01,083
and you're overdue
for your rest.

82
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:02,208
[WHIS]
Hm.

[SUPREME KAI]
Mm.

89
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,916
your present, as well.

90
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm on quite the roll today.

91
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,333
And what is that?

92
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,500
Premium tea leaves and
several sticky rice cakes

93
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,291
with an assortment
of sweet fillings.

94
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:26,041
A most delightful snack from our
planet Earth in the Seventh.

95
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:29,125
Aaah. That does sound tasty.

96
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:33,041
Surprisingly springy,
aren't they?

97
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,333
They are indeed. I believe
it has something to do

98
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,541
with the glutinous nature
of the rice grains.

99
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,958
And just wait until
you taste what's inside!

100
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,833
One bite and
you'll be transported!

101
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,458
It's indescribable!

102
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,833
You'll never think of bean paste
the same way again!

103
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,583
And please, make sure
you have it with the tea;

104
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,666
the pairing is
absolute perfection!

105
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,333
There's no denying it;
we do have a soft spot

106
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,500
for cakes and tea around here.

107
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:58,500
Thank you for this generous
gift. You're welcome any time.

108
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:01,041
Until we meet again,
Supreme Kai.

109
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,625
Now, Saiyan.

110
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:06,583
[GOKU] Ooh! Are you guys sure
leaving is a good idea?

111
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,041
Just keep walking, Goku!

Hmmmph.

00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,250
A rare and
special treat, Zamasu.

115
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,666
Let's enjoy it together.

116
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,375
Yes, master. I'd love to.

117
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:21,666
[GOKU]
Aah! Hey! Whis, catch me!

--Well, then? What do you think?

120
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:30,208
It's as we suspected.

121
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,750
There's no doubt about it.

122
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,791
He plans to kill Gowasu
in cold blood.

123
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:36,750
[GOKU]
For real? How do you know?

124
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:40,458
Zamasu's aura completely reeked
of murderous intentions, Goku.

125
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:43,250
The only stench fouler
is when my lord breaks wind.

126
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,916
That's both rude and untrue!

127
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,083
I'll have you know
mine smell like roses!

128
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,250
You're saying you could
sense it in his energy?

129
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,250
But I didn't sense
anything from him at all.

130
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,375
Well, of course,
Lord Beerus is a Destroyer,

131
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:54,750
which makes him
highly attuned to

132
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,458
these destructive inclinations.

133
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,791
Naturally, the same
goes for his attendant.

134
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,833
[GOKU] What about Gowasu?
You think he knows?

135
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:03,083
I would say he probably
hasn't noticed it yet.

136
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,791
He's a Supreme Kai like I am

137
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,750
and I didn't sense
Zamasu's bloodlust.

138
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:07,833
[GOKU]
Then what are we doing?

139
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,458
We've gotta get back
and save him!

140
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:10,875
There's no need to panic, Goku.

141
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:12,916
If Zamasu is going to
kill a Supreme Kai,

142
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,208
then I'll end his life
without hesitation.

143
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,541
But I can't take action
against a high-level deity

144
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:18,791
without some proof.

145
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,291
[GOKU] But you said
he's gonna do it!

146
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,458
What good is proof
if Gowasu's already dead?

147
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,833
We understand your concern,
but we're talking about

148
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:27,333
the future Supreme Kai
of the Tenth Universe.

149
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,583
An outside Destroyer
cannot simply obliterate him

150
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,458
because he harbors
dark intentions.

151
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:34,208
Such an act would throw the
entire multiverse into chaos.

152
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:35,666
For the moment,
all we can do

153
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,916
is watch what happens next.

154
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:45,041
Here is your special
Earth tea, Master Gowasu.

I can't believe they slipped
through our fingers like that.

165
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:32,125
I was so close to having
Goku's head on a platter.

166

His fate doesn't matter,

167

if they even have half a brain.

169
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:44,125
In fact, it's best if Goku
survives as long as possible.

On the off chance we do
need to elevate your power,

171
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,541
then fighting him seems to be
the best way to do it.

172
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:50,958
You can hunt him
down at the end,

173
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,541
then kill him slowly
with painstaking precision,

And on the subject of

I'm beginning to wonder
if we should have used

all the power I need.

This new level will make me
the ultimate sword for justice.

185
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:20,375
And when your sword is mighty
enough, you don't need a shield.

Just wait. I'm going
to become even stronger.

Heh! I was right
to think the vast power

But we call it

It's ironic, don't you think?

Here we are

I won't let

It looks like the transfer
mechanism is shot again.

any lower, it'd drag.

Say what?

223
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:26,750
It's a well-known
fact of science that

224
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,708
whenever people are depressed
and you're nice to them,

225

they'll melt in
your hands like butter.

[MAI]
That doesn't sound like science.

The trick is to place
your hand on their shoulders

and speak oh-so gently.

It's not your fault, Trunks.

Zamasu's objective
is to kill you,

for himself--
