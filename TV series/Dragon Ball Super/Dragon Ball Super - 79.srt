320
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,708
You strong man. But guess what?

321
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:33,500
Majin Buu? He's strong, too.

322
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,875
Way stronger than you are!

323
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,166
It can't be!

324
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:44,583
[yelling]

325
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:47,333
Buu!

[BASIL hollering]

00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:59,250
[screaming]

328
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,166
[BUU]
Mm!

00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,000
[laughs]

330
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,750
[BOTH gasp]

331
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,333
[GOHAN]
Buu hit him with all that

332
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:21,708
and he's right back up.
And laughing about it!

333
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:25,125
I know. I'm kind of
surprised by it!

334
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:29,583
If I had to guess, this battle
won't be over anytime soon.

335
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:34,875
Not true. I think their fighter
is just about outta steam.

336
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:40,958
[BASIL groaning]

337
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,125
[BOTH]
Wow!

338
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,166
That was fun.

339
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,541
Yeah, that was really fun.

340
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:53,458
The Omni-Kings Grand Zeno
have expressed satisfaction

341
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,041
with the match at hand.

342
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:59,250
By their orders, the first fight
of the Expo is hereby concluded!

343
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,916
--[ALL gasp]
--[GOKU] Aw man.

344
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,208
[GRAND MINISTER] The winner
from the Seventh Universe,

345
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:05,958
Majin Buu!

346
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:10,291
Aww yeah! Buu did it!

347
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,666
All right!

348
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,958
--[BEERUS chuckles]
--I can't believe it! He won!

349
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:17,125
I'm glad, too,
but now I'm just exhausted.

350
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:19,250
That was a close one, all right.

351
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,875
What did you think, your grace?

352
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,916
Awesome!

353
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,791
Super awesome!

354
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:28,083
[BUU]
Mr. Satan! Buu says wake up!

355
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,833
Hey, Buu beat Basil!

356
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:33,250
Buu fix you now, okay?

357
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:39,875
[gasps]

358
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,500
[GOHAN chuckles]

359
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:44,208
Wh-What happened to me?
Are you okay?

360
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,625
More than okay,
Buu's the winner!

361
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,250
[MR. SATAN] Ooh! Ha-ha!
That's my boy, Buu!

362
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,333
[BUU chuckles]

363
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:52,125
I never doubted you
for a second!

364
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,041
You're the best fighter
who's not me!

365
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,791
Aw! Buu likes when you
say nice things to him.

366
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,208
[BOTH laughing]

367
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,375
[MR. SATAN] I'm so proud
of you! You're a good boy,

368
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,125
a real good boy, Buu!
Yes, you are!

369
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:05,333
Without any further ado,
may I ask the combatants for

370
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,958
the next match
to step into the ring?

371
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:16,375
You fool! What a
pathetic performance!

372
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,083
[BERGAMO] They're stronger
than we thought.

373
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,583
We won't
underestimate them again.

374
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:23,541
That's enough! Lavender,
you will not embarrass

375
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,750
the Ninth Universe
like your brother.

376
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,708
[LAVENDER laughing]

377
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:31,083
Long as there are no pesky rules
holding me back, I'll win!

378
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:34,125
Kill them! Any way you want.

379
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:37,166
[LAVENDER laughing]

380
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,625
Then our team has
nothing to worry about.

381
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,708
I'll kill him. Kill him dead.

382
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,958
Eat as much as
you want, buddy-boy!

383
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,375
You earned it!

384
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:48,958
[GOHAN]
Well, Dad.

385
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,291
Looks like it's
my turn in the ring.

386
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:57,166
Wait till you see my power.
I'm stronger than ever!

387
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,791
Be careful down there, Gohan.

388
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:02,166
We don't know their strengths.
You gotta play it smart.

389
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,208
Right!

390
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,958
Good luck, son!
Now get down there!

391
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,791
I'm on it!

392
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:15,500
[laughing]

393
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,250
That's Gohan. I understand
that he's the son

394
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,291
of your friend Goku, my lords.

395
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:24,791
Wow, Goku's son. Cool.

396
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:27,666
I can't wait to see
how strong he is!

397
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:34,041
[laughing]

398
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,708
[NARRATOR] The first match
of The Zeno Expo has ended

399
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,916
with Majin Buu victorious!

400
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,333
The second match will pit
Lavender versus Gohan!

401
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:45,166
What dastardly move
will we see next

402
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,666
out of the Ninth Universe?

403
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:51,708
Don't miss the next match
in the Zeno Expo!

404

<i>I can't think with all</i>
<i>this noise, I'm goin' crazy</i>

410
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:24,916
<i>Is there any way to know</i>
<i>what's right or wrong?</i>

<i>Demons in an angel mask</i>

<i>Hopin' that I'll do</i>
<i>just what they ask</i>

[GOKU]
Hey! It's me Goku!

420
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:04,541
Get yourself fired up, Gohan!

421
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:06,541
This Lavender guy
from the Ninth Universe

422
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:08,625
seems like a major league creep!

423
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:10,458
There's no telling
how dirty he'll fight,

424
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:12,250
so don't let your guard down!

425
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:14,500
[GOHAN] Don't worry, Dad!
Remember what I said

426
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:17,250
about being way stronger now?

427
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:19,666
[GOKU] Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

428
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:22,541
"Awaken Your Dormant
Fighting Spirit!
