And now for the sake
of your feeble little mind

160
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,000
we can keep the name
simple as well.

161
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,125
We'll call this Golden Frieza.

162
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,083
It really does
look pretty gold.

163
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,791
Of course, I hope you
realize my appearance

164
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,333
was just a final touch.

165
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:36,000
This iteration has far more to
it than a shimmering façade.

166
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,166
I figured.
Since you were so cocky.

167
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,375
I thought whatever you were
hiding was gonna be good,

168
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,666
but I wasn't expecting this.

169
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,291
Judging by the amount
of energy I'm feeling,

170
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:48,333
it would appear that I'm the
winner of this race for power.

171
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,166
Well it ought to be
one heck of a battle,

172
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,666
I'll give you that much.

173
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,000
You'll give me far more,
including your life.

174
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,791
That's just not
gonna happen, Frieza.

175
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,958
But like I said, we'll have
a pretty good fight.

176
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,041
There's really no
point arguing about it.

177
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,750
Our battle will make
the truth painfully clear.

178
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,458
Agreed.

179
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,791
[FRIEZA] Farewell, Goku.
I wish to say that now.

180
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,250
[GOKU]
Why?

181
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,791
[FRIEZA] In terms of
true battle in this form,

182
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,583
this will be my maiden voyage.

183
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:19,458
I'll be venturing out
into the uncharted frontier.

184
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:21,208
Despite my best efforts,
I might kill you

185
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,666
sooner than I intend.

186
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,875
So, for the sake of closure
in case that does happen,

187
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,166
I'm bidding you goodbye
from the start.

188
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,791
I've always had a problem
with your arrogance, Frieza.

189
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,708
But as powerful as
you seem to be right now

190
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,958
you might actually be right.

191
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,333
While I'm eager to
test my own new power,

192
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,583
I'll at least admit
I feel nervous, too.

193
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,541
[FRIEZA chuckles]

194
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:03,708
Now die!

195
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:05,583
[yells]

196
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,875
How's this?

197
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,916
[GOKU groans]

198
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,000
[yells]

199
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,166
[yells]

200
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,625
[BOTH yell]

201
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,500
[yells]

202
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:37,500
[bellows]

203
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,583
[FRIEZA growls]

204
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:00,208
[yells]

205
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:04,083
[WHIS] Hello! Bulma?
Can you hear me?

206
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,750
Hello? Whis is that you?

207
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,875
[WHIS] I'm flying through
space as we speak.

208
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,333
I simply must try
that strawberry sundae.

209
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:13,000
I'll arrive in four minutes
and thirteen seconds.

210
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,875
What? Where have you been?

211
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:17,333
[BEERUS] Goku didn't even
offer to take us with him.

212
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:19,541
I could have been
feasting half an hour ago.

213
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:22,000
He's going to pay for that.

214
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:25,875
[yawns]

215
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,625
Hello.

216
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,833
Whis! You can't just
stop like that!

217
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:34,125
I nearly bit my tongue,
you careless twit!

218
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,625
Apologies, Lord Beerus.

219
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,333
But I've encountered
someone unexpected

220
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:39,083
and I'm quite sure
you'll want to know whom.

221
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,833
Huh?

222
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:52,083
[BEERUS growls lowly]

223
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:53,708
[CHAMPA chuckles]

224
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,250
[BEERUS] I've heard
of people getting lost

225
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,125
but you're taking it
to new heights.

226
00:12:57,208 --> 00:13:00,083
Ha! Snoozy Beerus
is awake for once.

227
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,291
Guess there is
such a thing as miracles.

228
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:03,375
You wanna go?

229
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,166
[grunts]

230
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,625
You're in the
Seventh Universe, Champa.

231
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:12,083
Surely you know the Destroyer
of the Sixth Universe

232
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,000
has no business being here.

233
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:18,000
[CHAMPA grunts] Relax, we were
just taking a short cut.

234
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:21,083
Honestly. Why do you feel the
need to be such a stickler?

235
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,333
[BEERUS] Don't try to fool me
with ridiculous excuses,

236
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:24,833
I know you too well for that!

237
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:25,958
And you better not
have come here

238
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,583
to steal our delicious food!

239
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,500
Eh?
[laughs]

240
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:32,458
As if I would waste my time
on the disgusting concoctions

241
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,416
you call food in this universe!

242
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,291
The cuisines in the Sixth are
the finest in all the realities,

243
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:38,833
I would never eat here!

244
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,833
Then what's the real
reason you came?

245
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,958
I'm just on a stroll.
I like the view.

246
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,250
Look at your belly, Champa.

247
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,916
You're not
the strolling type.

248
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,208
Ooh?

249
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:51,333
[BOTH growl]

250
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,791
All right.
You wanna battle then?

251
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,791
[growls]

252
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,041
Well that's fine by me!

253
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:02,875
[CHAMPA]
Vados! Let him have it!

254
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:03,833
[VADOS]
Huh?

255
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:05,458
[BOTH]
Uuuh...

256
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,083
Are you sure it wouldn't
be better to fight him

257
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,500
yourself, my lord?

258
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,083
He's not worth my time.

259
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:11,750
[BEERUS grunts]

260
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,875
Heh. That should be my line.

261
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:16,416
Forgive me, Lord Beerus,
but we should be going.

262
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,125
Yes. You're right,
let's move on.

263
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,000
We have business
as well, Lord Champa.

264
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,125
All right, twig,
I'll let you live this time.

265
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,375
I'm the one who's
sparing you, butterball.

266
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:27,750
[BOTH growl]

267
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,541
Come on, Vados, let's go.

268
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,125
[VADOS]
Yes, my lord.

269
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,833
He's up to something.

270
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,208
[CHAMPA]
I forget, Vados.

271
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,083
How many have we
collected so far?

272
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:41,541
[VADOS]
We have five.

273
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,500
The last two will be harder.

274
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,458
We'll have to
be more careful now.

275
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:47,291
I don't want Beerus
and Whis finding out

276
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,166
till we already have them all.

277
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,875
[laughs]

278
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,833
[GOKU yells]

279
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:56,416
How do you like this?

280
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:01,791
Your power is pathetic!
Aaah!

281
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:05,250
[GOKU yells]
Well, it's stopping you!

282
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:08,583
You're a speed bump.
Nothing more!

283
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:16,250
Frieza! You just
keep on impressing me!

284
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,541
I never could have imagined
you'd get this strong.

285
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,333
You should have
realized my superiority

286
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,041
while you still
had time to flee!

287
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:24,000
You could've at least
saved yourself!

288
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,458
[yells]

289
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,291
Guys, take cover!

290
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,375
[JACO yells]

291
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,250
Hang in there, Dad.

292
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:51,875
If he can't win this,
we're toast.

293
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,750
He's up against
unbelievable power.

294
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,875
Keep on pushing, Goku.
Find a way.

295
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:59,083
Come on! Why aren't Vegeta
and Goku fighting together?

296
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,291
It doesn't make sense!

297
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,541
[gasps]

298
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:05,583
[WHIS] I apologize
for keeping you waiting.

299
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,625
[ALL gasp]

300
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:10,083
Hi, Lord Destroyer, sir.
Glad you're here.

301
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,958
I didn't know
Beerus was coming too!

302
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,250
Yes, well, when you're
offering a strawberry sundae,

303
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:15,666
what did you expect?

304
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,083
Where is this dessert?
We've come a long way for it.

305
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:19,500
So, if it's not
as good as it looks,

306
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,541
you'll be paying the price.

307
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,541
It's in Jaco's ship;
I'll get it now.

308
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:27,666
Just don't blow us up
if it's a little melted.

309
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,458
Oooh...!

310
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:34,041
Wow, it looks even more
delicious in person!

311
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,333
I know ice cream's
good and all

312
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:36,958
but how can they eat
when there's a mad tyrant

313
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,250
lighting up the sky?

314
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,625
It would seem
deities operate on

315
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:43,041
a completely different level
than the rest of us do.

316
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:45,708
Fantastic!

317
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,541
Cold, sweet, and rich
all at the same time;

318
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,291
it's even better than I hoped!

319
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,291
No doubt we've made the right
decision traveling here, Whis.

320
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,708
Oh, yes,
I couldn't agree more!

321
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,583
[yells]
My brain!

322
00:16:56,666 --> 00:17:00,125
I ate it too fast, but it tastes
so good I don't regret it!

323
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:01,583
Your dairy confection,
ice cream.

324
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,916
That's the base of
this sundae, is that correct?

325
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,083
Uh, yeah that's right.

326
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,958
[WHIS]
Ooh-ho!

327

[FRIEZA yells]

328
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,333
Interesting,
these red things look like

329
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:19,250
the brains of those
giant frogs on Planet Manu.

330
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:22,208
Yes. They are
quite similar, my lord.

331
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,125
[sniffs]

332
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,833
No, wait!
It's some sort of fruit!

333
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:28,166
That's even better.
What a strong burst of flavor!

334
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,333
Try it, Whis, it's great!

335
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,250
Yes, I know.
I'm having one now.

336
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,500
This dessert's
simplicity is deceptive.

337
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,083
It's very good, Bulma.

338
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:37,875
What? Oh, yeah,
glad you like it.

339
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:48,166
[BEERUS] Speaking of good,
look at Frieza.

340
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,458
He's clearly gotten
stronger, hasn't he?

341
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:53,208
Yes. It seems Goku's
having some trouble with him.

342
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,333
He's made the most
of those wish orbs.

343
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,791
Guess those years in Earth's
hell motivated him.

344
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,666
Indeed, my lord.
He must have finally

345
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,625
done some training
to achieve that form.

346
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,166

[FRIEZA chuckles]

349
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:34,916
I hate to admit this,

350
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,208
but I'm having some
real trouble here.

351
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,625
[laughs]

352
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:41,291
You say that like
it isn't obvious.

353
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:44,041
There's no way around it,
you really are impressive.

354
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,666
It took me years of blood and
sweat to reach this level,

355
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,750
but you've caught up to me
like it's nothing.

356
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,083
Don't be surprised, Goku.

357
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,833
I commend you for
putting up a good struggle,

358
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:54,708
but even a monkey with god-like
powers is still a monkey.

359
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,750
And still the inferior race.

[GOKU grunts]

361
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,333
[FRIEZA]
You will die as I did.

362
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,208
I am going to rip you apart
until you're in

363
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:06,208
far too many pieces to count.

364
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,416
As I told your son,
you won't die alone.

365
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,833
Next, I'll kill Vegeta.

366
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,625
Then all of your other
dear old friends.

367
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,500
I only hope you're
punished as I was,

368
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:17,375
and you're all hung up
from the same damn tree.

369
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:19,791
Aah!

370
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,416
What? Beerus is here?

371
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,083
You forgot to say "Lord."

372
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,541
That's not polite, Frieza.

373
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,166
I guess you must be
thinking even more

374
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,541
highly of yourself than usual.

375
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,833
Yes, Lord Beerus. Forgive me.

376
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,375
But why are you here?

377
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:33,833
I thought
that was obvious.

378
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:36,666
I came here to eat
this delicious sundae.

379
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,125
But Lord Beerus, I'm on this
planet to claim vengeance,

380
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:40,916
are you planning to intervene?

381
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,166
Why would I possibly
care about that?

382
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,166
You may do
as you please, Frieza.

383
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,708
Just do it farther away
from my ice cream.

384
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:51,916
I don't want to confuse your
battle dust for sprinkles.

385
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,083
You seriously didn't
come here to stop me?

386
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,375
Not unless you keep
making me repeat myself.

387
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,083
I take no sides in this battle.

388
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:00,125
I'm a Destroyer god
not an arbiter.

389
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,041
Wait! You mean you'd
really let him win?

390
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,583
It's not my fight now, is it?

391
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:04,791
What are you talking about?

392
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,500
If Frieza wins
he'll kill us all!

393
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,041
How could you let that happen?

394
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,833
Don't annoy me.

395
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,625
Relax, as long as
you keep supplying me

396
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,250
with delicacies
like this, I'll at least

397
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,208
make sure
your life is spared.

398
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:20,500
You just stay close to me.

399
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:21,875
How's this?

Yoohoo, Bulma.

402
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:29,166
So, is that actually
Lord Beerus the Destroyer?

403
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,666
As in he actually exists?

404
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,916
Yeah, that's right.
I tried telling you before!

405
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,875
You think you could
get a picture of us?

406
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,458
And make it look like
we're friends.

407
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:37,833
Again with the camera?

408
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:40,666
Come on, it's just one shot.
Don't be rude about it.

409
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,375
Earlier you said
it was for some report,

410
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:43,958
but that wasn't even true, huh?

411
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,708
You want a picture of Beerus
for the same reason

412
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,625
you want pictures of Goku
and Frieza fighting.

413
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,208
For your own stupid photo album!

414
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,083
That is both ridiculous
and offensive!

415
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,500
This is my super-elite
galactic duty!

416

Oh, okay. Well feel
free to ask him yourself.

417
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,833
I'm sure he'll understand
it's for your job.

418
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,291
Eh?

419

[BULMA] But don't blame me
if the guy disintegrates you

420
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,291
right out of your boots.

00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,500
Never mind. I don't
think the lighting's

424
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:08,833
very good right now.

425
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,375
All right, Goku.
