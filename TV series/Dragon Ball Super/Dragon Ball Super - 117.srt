<i>I've always wanted nothing more</i>

[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

485
00:22:52,696 --> 00:22:55,073
While the Sixth Universe
launches an all-out attack

486
00:22:55,156 --> 00:22:57,492
on Gohan and Piccolo,
the last fighters for

487
00:22:57,575 --> 00:23:01,371
the Second team gang up on me,
and trap me in a black hole!

488
00:23:01,454 --> 00:23:03,873
And those Namekians from
the Sixth use a special power

489
00:23:03,957 --> 00:23:05,250
to keep healing themselves,

490
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:07,127
which basically makes
them invincible.

491
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:08,837
We shouldn't have
underestimated these guys--

492
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,463
now we're in serious trouble!

493
00:23:10,547 --> 00:23:12,549
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

494
00:23:12,632 --> 00:23:15,593
"Accelerating Tragedy
Vanishing Universes."

495
00:23:15,677 --> 00:23:17,429
Make sure you don't
miss it, okay?
