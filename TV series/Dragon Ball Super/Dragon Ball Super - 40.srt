Don't go stepping out of line,

00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:30,291
Yeah, but Lord Beerus,
we can't just stand by.

324
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,833
[BEERUS] Look, you all did well
enough, in your own way.

325
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,916
And for that,
you have my praise.

326
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,333
But the competition's over now.

327
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:41,166
Which means your time in the
spotlight has come to an end.

That's right!

So, from here on out,

we gods are back in charge
and running the show again!

You got that?

332
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,208
We make the rules around here!

While you stupid puppets just
shut up and do as you're told!

That being said,

00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,333
if you wanted to challenge
a Destroyer to a duel

337
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:02,833
in order to change the rules,

338
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:05,791
then I feel certain we
could arrange something.

It doesn't matter.
I'll destroy everything!

the magnitude of terror
