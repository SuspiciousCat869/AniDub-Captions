Oh yes, where he can stop time.

You're in the right ballpark,

228
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,000
but he's doesn't
actually "stop" it.

229
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:34,333
To be exact,
he can skip ahead in time.

230
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,875
And why's that mean
he can't be touched?

It's complicated, sir.

232
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:41,625
But basically, Hit can store up
all the time he skips over.

233
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,666
Hold on. Store it how?

In a temporary
space-time parallel to ours.

235

You might think of it
as a pocket dimension.

move through without

matter here
interacting with him.

238
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,416
It's because Hit's
using this ability

239
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,916
that Goku can see him,
but can't touch him.

And you made his path to
victory that much smoother

257

by having him take out Goku now.

hire him to eliminate Goku.

you jump to
some other place, right?

That is correct.

265

But while you're
wherever it is you go,
