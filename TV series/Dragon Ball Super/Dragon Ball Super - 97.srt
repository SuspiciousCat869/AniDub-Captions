the rulebook assiduously,

I'll lay out the basic
guidelines for the battles.

66
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:36,208
The competition
will last 100 tacks.

67
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:39,583
The column in the center
will descend as time elapses,

68
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,416
and once it reaches the ground,

69
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,291
all fighting will
officially conclude.

70
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,916
Uh, what's a hundred tacks?

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,166
I think it's roughly equivalent
to 48 Earth-minutes.

72
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,166
Really?! Isn't that
kinda short though?

73
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,750
Special techniques are allowed,

74
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,416
but the use of weapons
is prohibited--

75
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,916
as are any lethal
attacks or maneuvers.

76
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,625
However, you may force your
opponents off the ring,

77
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,750
and must do so to win.

78
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,083
For even if someone is
rendered unable to fight,

79
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:07,583
they will not be eliminated
unless they're out of bounds.

to you here.

However, those of you who
possess wing-like appendages

wounded you may be,

the use of restorative

481
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:10,666
and they really wanna
take me out, bad!

482
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:13,500
Still, me and Vegeta have
a few tricks up our sleeves.

483
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:15,458
Oh, wait, I don't
have any sleeves!

484
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:17,583
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

485
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:20,750
"Ah, the Uncertainty!
A Universe Despairs!"

486
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,083
Make sure you don't
miss it, okay?
