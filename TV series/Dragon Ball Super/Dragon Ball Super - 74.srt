But there are still
tons of things I can't do.

157
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,250
[GOHAN] I wanna be a perfect
husband, dad, and son.

158
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,583
But that balance
is super tricky.

159
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,041
So I know what it's like
when something

160
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:14,083
you want bad doesn't come easy.

161
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:17,291
We'll just both
try harder, okay?

162
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,416
Are you all right?

163
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,750
Okay, get your script!
Let's run those lines!

164
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,916
[GOHAN chuckles]
Yeah! That's the spirit!

165
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:34,458
[COCOA] Now that's
what I call rehearsal!

166
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,583
That was some of
your best acting yet!

167
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,458
And think how good
you'll do working on set

168
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,125
with a real actor.

169

Stop with that. You were great.

170

Well, thanks.
I better get home now.

171
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,041
But why do you want me
to leave from the roof?

172
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,916
Because the lobby's
being painted.

173
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,916
What? Who paints at this hour?

174

And Cocoa. Thought you'd escape
my prying eyes on the roof?

185
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,125
Since when can
a pop idol outsmart

186

award-winning actor?

for me all night, did you?

shoot days can be brutal.

192
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,166
[GOHAN] Well, we had
to rehearse for tomorrow.

193

Wow, Gohan.
I never would've suspected

202
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:15,375
you were the real
Great Saiyaman.

Hey, I'm sorry, dear.
I know it's a lot to take in.

210
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:34,208
Showbusiness can corrupt men
with all that money and fame.

And hot, flexible girls
throwing themselves at you.

I can't believe you'd
go through all of this

00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:53,208
just because I turned
down your autograph!

219
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:54,875
And does it really
bother you so much

that Gohan gets
a moment to shine?

You're the most
famous guy around,

222

the most insecure!

that your husband's a cheat?

It's <i>not</i> proof,
because he's <i>not</i> a cheat.

I'm sure there's a very
good reason for that kiss.

There sure is, Videl!

Now would you please
get out of my house?
