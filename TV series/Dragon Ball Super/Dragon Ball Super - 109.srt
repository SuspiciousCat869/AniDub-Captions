And when you're at
the top level, like him,

201
00:11:33,016 --> 00:11:35,643
before you compete all-out,
you want to see the scope

of your opponent's power,
understand the way he reacts,

and establish what your
own strengths are, too.

Then you'll use your power

this as a chance

everything he has

and yet Jiren still
pummels him easily,

the remaining contestants

they have no chance,
and lose their will to compete.

your stupid crutch!

323
00:18:28,598 --> 00:18:30,684
Thanks, everyone!

324
00:18:30,767 --> 00:18:32,102
But it's still too small...

325
00:18:32,185 --> 00:18:35,897
I'm gonna need a lot more time
to gather enough energy.

326
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,856
[JIREN]
I'll wait.

327
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:37,941
Uh?

328
00:18:38,024 --> 00:18:39,984
Take however much
time you require.

329
00:18:40,068 --> 00:18:43,613
If this is your special move,
then I want it done right.

330
00:18:43,697 --> 00:18:45,615
Go ahead and do your worst!

331
00:18:45,699 --> 00:18:47,325
All right.

332
00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:49,786
I'm surprised. Thanks for
being so accommodating.

333
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:52,288
Jiren will take on Goku's
massive attack

334
00:18:52,372 --> 00:18:54,916
and then counter with a move
of even greater might.

335
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,794
[BELMOD] Heh, heh. It's a
simple, but effective approach.

336
00:18:57,877 --> 00:18:59,254
I can hardly wait.

337
00:18:59,337 --> 00:19:02,173
I must confess I feel
a bit uneasy, my lord.

338
00:19:02,257 --> 00:19:05,844
[BRIANNE laughs] Goku's left
himself wide open from behind!

339
00:19:05,927 --> 00:19:07,721
Time to send some surprise love!

340
00:19:07,804 --> 00:19:11,307
Pretty Cannon-- [screams]

341
00:19:12,517 --> 00:19:16,479
Ridiculous. Enough theatrics,
Kakarot. Let's go!

342
00:19:16,563 --> 00:19:19,024
Goku!

343
00:19:19,107 --> 00:19:21,067
You can take our energy, too!

344
00:19:21,151 --> 00:19:23,737
[ROSHI] Hell yeah, it's not like
we're doing anything with it!

345
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,615
What a sight. That's truly
a fascinating technique.

346
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:29,784
I can't believe two
lower-ranked universes

347
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:31,828
have produced
warriors this good.

348
00:19:31,911 --> 00:19:35,457
Yes. This promises to
be quite the climax.

349
00:19:38,918 --> 00:19:43,173
It's ready! Ha, ha! Yes!

350
00:19:50,221 --> 00:19:51,264
All right, Jiren.

351
00:19:51,348 --> 00:19:53,016
Once you're out,
I hope you don't regret

352
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:54,642
giving me time to finish this!

353
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:56,603
[yells]

354
00:19:59,022 --> 00:20:01,941
This is what it looks like when
the Seventh Universe unites!

355
00:20:02,025 --> 00:20:04,903
This is our Spirit Bomb!

356
00:20:09,407 --> 00:20:10,617
[JIREN grunts]

357
00:20:12,786 --> 00:20:13,953
[ALL gasp]

358
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:24,756
[GOKU]
Uh?

359
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:33,306
Seriously?

360
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,892
Impossible!
He's pushing it away!

361
00:20:35,975 --> 00:20:39,604
Dad's not done. He can
power up and push back.

362
00:20:45,235 --> 00:20:47,195
Come on!

363
00:20:47,278 --> 00:20:49,239
[yells]

364
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:52,158
[JIREN grunts]

365
00:20:56,621 --> 00:20:59,749
Kaio-ken Times 10!

366
00:21:02,043 --> 00:21:06,131
[GOKU grunting]

367
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:11,511
[GOKU growling]

368
00:21:15,056 --> 00:21:18,309
[GOKU yelling]

369
00:21:18,393 --> 00:21:21,813
Kaio-ken Times 20!

370
00:21:24,274 --> 00:21:26,317
[JIREN gasping]

371
00:21:26,401 --> 00:21:28,028
[yells]

372
00:21:28,111 --> 00:21:34,117
[yelling]

373
00:21:39,706 --> 00:21:43,501
[yelling continues]

374
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,884
<i>A 70 centimeter squared window</i>

375
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,855
<i>Today the sun broke</i>
<i>through the clouds</i>

376
00:22:03,938 --> 00:22:07,650
<i>The rain is fin'ly gone</i>

377
00:22:07,734 --> 00:22:10,362
<i>Gonna open up</i>
<i>the window for once</i>

378
00:22:10,445 --> 00:22:14,240
<i>No reason, just because</i>

379
00:22:14,324 --> 00:22:16,826
<i>This room has been</i>
<i>stained with the sighs</i>

380
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:19,329
<i>Of everyday regret</i>

381
00:22:19,412 --> 00:22:22,540
<i>Now it's time to clear the air</i>

382
00:22:22,624 --> 00:22:27,420
<i>Every moment was consumed</i>
<i>with my thoughts of you</i>

383
00:22:29,089 --> 00:22:34,219
<i>Knowing in my heart those dreams</i>
<i>won't be coming true</i>

384
00:22:35,136 --> 00:22:41,851
<i>I've always wanted nothing more</i>
<i>than to see your face</i>

385
00:22:41,935 --> 00:22:47,065
<i>I move on knowing that your</i>
<i>mem'ry can't be erased</i>

386
00:22:51,486 --> 00:22:52,737
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

387
00:22:52,821 --> 00:22:54,364
Not even multiplying my power

388
00:22:54,447 --> 00:22:57,283
with a Kaio-ken Times-20
is working against Jiren.

389
00:22:57,367 --> 00:23:00,870
Even worse, he's deflected the
Spirit Bomb right back at me!

390
00:23:00,954 --> 00:23:03,498
But just when it seems like
I've used everything I've got,

391
00:23:03,581 --> 00:23:05,625
I can feel a new
power bubbling up.

392
00:23:05,709 --> 00:23:08,670
A power beyond anything
I've experienced before!

393
00:23:08,753 --> 00:23:11,089
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

394
00:23:11,172 --> 00:23:12,215
"Goku Enkindled!

395
00:23:12,298 --> 00:23:14,759
The Awakened One's
New Ultra Instinct!"

396
00:23:14,843 --> 00:23:17,387
Make sure you don't
miss it, okay?
