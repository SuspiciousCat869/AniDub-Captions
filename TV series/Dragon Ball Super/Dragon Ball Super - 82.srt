00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,875
for the tournament's
official start

320
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:30,458
on day 3,135,500,603
of the Royal Calendar.

321
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:34,208
We'll kick things off
promptly at 157 o'clock.

322
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,875
[GOKU]
Uh, question!

323
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,375
Yes, what is it, Goku?

324
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:38,750
What does "hiatus" mean and

325
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,416
when is the arena gonna be done?

326
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,833
It shall take five ticks.

327
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:45,750
Uh, 'kay. How long
is a "tick," exactly?

328
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,708
If you convert that
to your Earth time

329
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,541
in the Seventh Universe,
it comes out to

330
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,375
approximately 40 hours.

331
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:56,041
Wait, 40 hours?!
It starts in just two days!

332
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,291
Correct!

333
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,583
[ANAT]
Oh, my.

334
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:01,916
[DIETIES chattering]

335
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,833
[JEREZ]
Hmm.

336
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,083
All right, dear friends,
we'll see you all again

337
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:10,541
when preparations
are done. Good luck!

338
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:17,291
So, we have to put together
a team of ten fighters?

339
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,000
You haven't heard anything
about Hit having

340
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,958
nine brothers, have you?

341
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,541
Nothing's that easy, my lord.

342
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,958
We don't have anywhere near
enough time to prepare!

343
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,416
Hey, Whis! How do you think

344
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,416
this tournament's
gonna play itself out?

345
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,708
Judging from
what I've seen so far,

346
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,708
I think it's safe to say
they'll all gang up

347
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:39,875
on Goku to eliminate <i>him</i> first.

348
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,875
[BEERUS sputtering]

349
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,416
Bye-bye! See ya soon, Zennies!

350
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,875
[BOTH]
Later!

351
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,208
Hurry up! Let's go!

352
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:48,791
[GOKU]
All right, all right! Chill.

353
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,333
Kai-kai!

354
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:56,541
[GOKU]
Whew!

355
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,833
--[MR. SATAN] Hey, Goku.
--[GOKU] Huh?

356
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:01,333
[MR. SATAN]
You can win this thing, right?

357
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,791
I can't know for sure.
But with Gohan and Buu

358
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,166
on the team, I sure do
like our chances!

359
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,791
Yeah. I forgot all about Buu!

360
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,166
You're gonna save
the universe, buddy?

361
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,958
I'll try to come up with
a battle strategy for our team.

362
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,541
Okay. I think
we'll be fine though.

363
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,166
I literally just told you

364
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,333
to start taking
this tournament seriously!

365
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:22,000
We just have to win! I get it!

366
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,916
Yes, obviously, Goku!

367
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,250
The question is what's the
actual plan for pulling it off!

368
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,958
[GOKU] How can we plan when we
don't know who we're fighting?

369
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,458
There's no use worrying about
what we can't control.

370
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,875
Shouldn't you at least
use this time to train?

371
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,416
Getting that riled up all
the time can't be good for ya.

372
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,625
[WHIS] All right you two,
that's enough bickering.

373
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:42,458
You should be using this time
to form the rest of your team.

374
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:45,375
You just have two days to
recruit seven more fighters.

375
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,666
I'd start asking around,
if I were you.

376
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,250
Ha! I can tell that
you're loving all this!

377
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,708
Even if we lose, you still
get to stick around!

378
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,083
[laughs]
Guilty as charged!

379
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:57,000
It is the advantage
of being a mere guide

380
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:59,000
dispatched from
the great beyond, my lord.

381
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,958
You go from
faithful angel attendant

382
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:04,500
to a "mere guide" based
solely on what's convenient.

383
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,000
Come to think of it, Whis.

384
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:09,041
The Grand Minister to Zeno
is your father, am I right?

385
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,375
Yes, my lord, that's true.

386
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:14,166
[BEERUS] Give Daddy whatever
he wants so he'll exclude us

387
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,625
from the Tournament of Power!

388
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:18,041
With all due respect,
I'll do no such thing!

389
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,500
You're a god, Lord Beerus,

390
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,541
you should act far more
dignified than this!

391
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,333
Whining and taking shots
at each other

392
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,625
isn't what'll win
that tournament, boys.

393
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,333
We know Goku's track record.

394
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,958
Let's trust him and the others
to get us through this.

395
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:33,500
That's right. Just leave it
to us and it'll all work out.

396
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:36,833
[BEERUS] Fine. Then we'll
reconvene at Bulma's place.

397
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,208
[GOKU] What? Why do you
want to go to Earth?

398
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:41,625
[BEERUS] We prefer
to talk strategy there.

399
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,333
So we can eat while we plan.

400
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,375
In fact, eating the best
Earth foods now

401
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,291
is more important
than ever before.

402
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,041
Because thanks to a certain fool
and his cursed mouth,

403
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,583
I probably won't have
the chance for much longer!

404
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,166
You got some nerve!

405
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,958
How can you complain
about destruction

406
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,125
when you've been doing it
willy-nilly for centuries?

407
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:03,333
[BEERUS]
I do not do it "willy-nilly"!

408
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:04,625
Now listen here!

409
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,208
We prob'ly have the
second-lowest mortal level

410
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:07,916
in the multiverse because
they've penalized us

411
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,666
for fighters like you who have
training weights for brains!

412
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,666
If they count brains,
Gohan's got a big one,

413
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,958
so it all evens out!

414
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,625
[WHIS]
Again! Quiet!

415
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,041
If we keep bickering
with each other

416
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:18,583
like unruly school children,

417
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:19,958
then what hope
do we have of defeating

418
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:22,125
any of the higher-ranked
universes' teams?

419
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,166
Yep, the angels's got you there.

420
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,708
[BOTH]
Uuh...

421
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,500
Good point.

422
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:31,375
I know we can put together
a team that can stand up

423
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:32,916
to the entire cosmos!

424
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,958
You bet!

425
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:37,125
[NARRATOR]
Just 39 hours remain until

426
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:40,291
the Tournament of Power
gets underway!

427
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:44,125
Can Goku and Gohan assemble
a team strong enough

428
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,458
to defeat the other universes,

429
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:50,458
and stop the Omni-Kings
from eliminating theirs?

430
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:54,208
Find out next time
on Dragon Ball Super.

431
00:21:57,375 --> 00:22:00,208
<i>An angel and a demon sit</i>

432
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:03,333
<i>One to my right,</i>
<i>one to my left</i>

433
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:09,416
<i>In between I'm tryin'</i>
<i>to figure out the right way</i>

434
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,333
<i>Is one way good?</i>
<i>Is one way bad?</i>

435
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:15,500
<i>Too much confusion in my head</i>

436
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:20,875
<i>I can't think with all</i>
<i>this noise, I'm goin' crazy</i>

437
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:24,916
<i>Is there any way to know</i>
<i>what's right or wrong?</i>

438
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:29,791
<i>Demons in an angel mask</i>

445
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:51,583
<i>So they said to me</i>

446
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:02,000
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

447
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:04,291
We don't have much time
to build this team.

448
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:06,291
But one guy we definitely
can't do without

449
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:09,375
is my old rival and
training partner, Vegeta!

450
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:13,625
He says he can't come?
She still hasn't had that baby?

451
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:16,458
Hey, Whis.
Help us out here, will ya?

452
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:18,791
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

453
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:21,500
"Field the
All-7th-Universe Team!

454
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:23,416
Who Are the Mighty Ten?"

455
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,666
Make sure you don't
miss it, okay?
