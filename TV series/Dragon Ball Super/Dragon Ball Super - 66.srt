Indeed.
This wound will not last.

I am invincible.
No damage can destroy me.

I may stumble for a moment,
but I will always remain.

I will defeat you
and all mortal kind,

186

You aren't a purely

And you can never get the number
of mortals down to zero now.

191

You see, now that you've merged,

192
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,375
you've taken in
something that's always

193
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:21,458
going to be a part of you,
for as long as you live.

194
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:24,583
Goku's mortal and
destructible body!

195
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:28,708
[ZAMASU] Huh?
[laughing]

196
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:33,333
You mortals are all alike,
led astray by your ignorance.

197
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:35,083
You think that's a revelation?

198
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:37,583
That Goku's body
will always be part of me?

199
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:40,625
Of course he will!
Such was my desire!

200
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,041
[VEGETTO]
Huh?

201
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:45,958
You are mortal, Saiyans.
Yet you've gained divine power.

202
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,041
You're stronger
than most deities now.

203
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,375
Thus those who
created this cosmos

204
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,958
have made something
they could not control.

205
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:56,208
And if one can't control a world
one can't be called a god of it,

206
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,000
making Saiyans the
ultimate symbol

207
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,666
of the failure of the Kais.

208
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,541
[ZAMASU] And so,
by incorporating Goku's flesh

209
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,916
into my being, I have
assumed both the sins

210
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,291
of mortal kind and
the failure of divinity,

211
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,708
so they may never be repeated!

212
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:16,916
That is the duty
of a true god.

213
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,375
Got an answer
for everything, huh?

214
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,125
Of course.
That is why I do this.

215
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:25,708
For the good of the cosmos.
For creation!

216
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,208
Are you seriously crying?

217
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,791
[ZAMASU]

218

this blighted world!

219

...made clean by Zamasu's hand!

222

Look at him.

228
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:05,166
His body is unstable,
it's losing its form.

229
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,791
Twisting into
something hideous.

230
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:11,416
It's the physical embodiment
of what he feels within.

231
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,791
How so?

232
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:15,791
He is obsessed,
fixated on the contradictions

233
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,708
of gods and mortals.

234
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,125
If mortals have
capacity for wisdom,

235
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,208
why do they so often fail?

236
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,375
If gods see their
actions as wicked,

237
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,583
why do they
tolerate and forgive?

238
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:30,375
How can gods and mortals seem
so different, yet so alike?

239
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,375
What is the point of it all?

240
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,750
Zamasu seeks beauty.

241
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:38,541
Yet look at his body,
distorted by hatred and rage.

242
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:42,500
I wonder, is that really
the result that he craved?

243
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:46,750
A broken, misshapen god
alone in a vacant cosmos.

244
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:49,500
How fulfilled will he be then?
