159
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,250
then train your brain!

160
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,500
I mean look at your dad.

161
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,166
He trains as much
as he breathes,

162
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,750
and does he earn
a single zeni? No!

163
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,458
I'm telling you,
Goten, your brother's...

164
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,000
This is gonna take a while.

165
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,833
You wanna sneak out
while we can?

166
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,208
[BOTH chuckle]

167
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,375
And he never would have
gotten there if I hadn't of

168
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:32,708
told him he had to study!

169
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,833
So I'll crack this whip
just like I did with him,

170
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:39,166
and when you get your diploma
you can thank me, okay?

171
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,166
Uh? Uh! Hey.

Man, these sweet bean
ones are the best!

177
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,166
Thank you very much, sir,
I'm glad you like them.

178
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,250
Wrap those two up.
We'll take 'em to go.

179

[GOTEN]
You sure that's enough, Dad?

180
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,291
[GOKU]
Mm?

181
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,541
If they're letting us
train there,

182
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,541
I think we should
take a whole box!

183
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,458
What? But Beerus and I
are best buds.

184
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:15,625
He's not gonna care.

185
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:18,250
Trust me, Dad.
It's just good manners.

186
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,875
Mr. Dessert Guy.

187
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:23,166
We'll take the full 20 pack
in a gift box, please.

188
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,416
Brilliant choice!

189
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,791
Wow! You really took
charge there, big guy!

190

[CAPSULE CORP WOMAN 4A]
Hello, Goku. Welcome back.

192
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:39,083
[GOKU] How's it goin'?
Is Vegeta around?

193
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,416
I'll page him now.

194
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,791
[GOKU]
Awesome, thanks.

195
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:44,583
Oh, Goku! Hey!
How's life treating ya?

196
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:47,000
[GOKU] Great! And about
to get even better!

197
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,875
Hi, Bulma!

198
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,500
You might be interested to
know that Chichi just called.

[GOTEN, GOKU gasp]

200
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,208
Goten, she realizes
there's no stopping your dad,

201
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,875
but she wants you
to stay with me.

202
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,416
Aaaw!

203
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,416
Wait a minute, Goku,
what is that?

204
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,458
Did you bring a shower gift?

205
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,791
How... totally unlike you!

206
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:07,125
Who's showering?

207
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:11,958
[yells]
Holy crap, Bulma!

208
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,833
Someone's been
hittin' the buffets!

[laughing]

210
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,041
[groans] I should've
known better than to expect

211
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,541
anything nice from you!

212
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:19,916
Whaaa...!

[GOKU]
Uh?

214
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,833
Speaking of expecting,
did you seriously

215
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:26,041
not know, Goku?
I'm going to pop any day now!

216
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,625
[GOTEN]
I'm happy for you, Trunks!

217
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:43,458
Do you know if it's a little
brother or little sister?

218
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,708
Nah, my mom says she wants
to keep it a surprise

219
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,166
until the baby's born.

220
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,500
So what are you hoping for?

221
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,250
[TRUNKS] I don't care,
long as they're not lame.

00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,833
[GOTEN laughs]

223
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,791
I hate this gender surprise--
she's already past her due date,

224
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,000
we deserve to know!

225
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,041
Sorry. Don't listen
to them, Bulma,

226
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,083
they're just impatient
'cause they're excited.

[BOTH]
Yes, we are!

[SHU] And whether a he-baby
or she-baby, we're ready!

229
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,208
I've been honing
my ninja swaddling skills!

230
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:09,958
[BULMA]
Heh. Thanks, guys.

231
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,916
You know what, Bulma.
You should have these.

232
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,208
You need them more than I do!

233
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,750
Aw, thanks, that's so nice.

234
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:18,458
Well, look at you acting
like a thoughtful grown-up.

235
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,583
[GOTEN]
No, Dad, you can't!

236
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:23,666
That's supposed to be a
present for Beerus and Whis.

237
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,500
If you don't bring a gift,
you're not gonna

238
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,583
be able to train there,
remember?

239
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,333
Oh yeah, that's right.

240
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,125
Wow, more training with Whis?

241
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,000
You really can't
get enough, huh?

[laughing]

243
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,416
Well, I won't
deprive you of that.

244
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,166
You keep the gift,
I'm just glad I got to see you.

245
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,666
Aw, thanks--sorry!

246
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,333
So you're really gonna go
train on Beerus' world?

247
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:44,666
If your mom let's me!

248
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,291
[TRUNKS] Aww, forget that!
If you want to train,

249
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:50,250
then train with me here!
If you're gone,

250
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,833
I'll have to train
with those weenies,

251
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:54,000
and they can't keep up!

252

[BOTH] We're not gonna be a
Super Saiyan's punching bag!

Scatter!

254
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,958
And there's no telling
when the baby's gonna come,

255
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,875
so I can't go skipping
across the universe.

256
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,000
Come on, please!

257
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,541
Yeah, okay. I can train here!

258
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,916
Yeah! We'll start right now!

259
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,000
Looks like Goten
wants to stay here.

260
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,375
That'll make his mom happy.

261
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,708
I'll call Chichi and
make sure to take the credit.

262
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:17,958
Works for me.

263
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,791
So I'm guessing the real
reason you came today

264
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:22,291
was to invite Vegeta to train
with you and Whis, right?

265
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:25,791
Uh! Yeah, I totally forgot!

00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:34,625

Yo, Vegeta! What's going on?

269
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:41,041
Aah! Don't sneak up
on me like that!

00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:43,375

271
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,166
[VEGETA]
So, what do you want?

272
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,833
I'm going back to Beerus'
world to train with Whis again,

273
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:50,083
and I figured you'd
want to come with me.

274
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,541
That's tempting, but this
time I'll have to pass.

275
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,375
But why, you're always
down to train!

276
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,083
Would you use your brain?

277
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:57,708
Did you not see my wife?

278
00:12:57,791 --> 00:13:00,500
She could give birth
any day now. I can't go!

279
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,125
But what does
that have to do with you?

280
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,750
The baby comes
out of her, right?

281
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,500
Why do I have to explain this?
If I leave the planet now,

282
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,291
then I'll never
hear the end of it!

283
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,875
You mean she'd be mad?
I didn't have to deal with that

284
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,208
when Goten was born,
'cause I was dead!

285
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:15,500
I have no idea
how you're still married.

286
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:18,500
But in any case, Kakarot,
I am staying here.

287
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:19,916
[GOKU]
Man, you're no fun.

288
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,583
[VEGETA]
Shut up!

289
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,583
Good afternoon, Saiyans.

290
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,083
Hey Whis, good to see ya!

291
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:29,458
Quite. I assumed
you'd invite Vegeta.

292
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:30,625
Well, let's be off.

293
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,458
Well, that's the thing,
I did invite him,

294
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,750
but Vegeta says he's
gonna stay home this time.

295
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,583
Oh my, that's
so out of character.

296
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,125
Is everything all right?

297
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,875
It's fine. I'm just about to
have a baby, if you must know.

298
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,958
My goodness!
You don't look pregnant!

299
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:45,458
Not me, you weirdo-- Bulma!

300
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,833
[WHIS]
Ooh!

301
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:51,375
It's hard to keep all
the gestation methods straight.

302
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:52,583
Congratulations.

303
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,125
So you see why I have to stay.

304
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,166
In fact I do not. If it's
a purely maternal pregnancy,

305
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,583
why do you have to be here?

306
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,833
[GOKU]
That's what I said!

307
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:05,166
[VEGETA grunts] I'm staying
by her side. Now drop it!

308
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,750
As you wish. If this is
part of your perinatal customs,

309
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,208
I won't impede.

310
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,750
We should get moving, Goku,
my lord and I are hungry.

311
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,875
All right. Just remember
you chose this, okay?

312
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:18,166
So don't get mad
when I come back stronger.

313
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,791
[VEGETA]
Hmph! We'll see.

314
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,791
[GOKU] All right,
well, we're leaving then.

315
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,375
Now I hate to be a stickler
about the arrangement, Goku,

316
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,666
but you did bring those
confections, didn't you?

317
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,458
Oh yeah, you don't have
to worry about that.

318
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:29,791
I got 'em right here!

319
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,625
And they're super yummy, too!

320
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:35,750
Oh, how delightful! I can
hardly contain myself, come on!

[VEGETA]
Tch!

323
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,333
Hey there, Lord Beerus,
how's it going?

324
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:47,750
[BEERUS]
Skip the pleasantries.

325
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,958
Did you bring
what you promised or not?

326
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:52,083
Sure did! I hope you're hungry!

327
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:57,333
[BEERUS]
Ooh! These do look gourmet.

328
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:58,750
Told ya!

329
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,458
[BEERUS]
Well, down the hatch.

330
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,291
Wowie!

331
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:10,625
I trust you won't mind
if I try one, too, sir.

332
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,375
You weren't exaggerating--
these are divine!

333
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,875
I know, right?
[chuckles]

334
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,625
Uh? Is that a bruise?

335
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:23,333
Uh? Yeah. Pretty embarrassing.

336
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,791
It's been a while since I fought
against anybody powerful,

337
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,458
so my skills have gotten
rusty I'm afraid to admit.

338
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,541
That's why I'm
training here for a while.

339
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,125
[BEERUS groans]

340

[GOKU grunting]

341
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,083
You'll never be
on a Destroyer's level

342
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,666
with setbacks like this.

343
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,750
I'm appalled that you went so
long without a vigorous fight.

344
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,750
[WHIS]
Ho!

345
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,875
[GOKU yells]

346
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,458
He's right,
I need to fight more.

347
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,625
Wait, I got an idea!

348
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,666
Have you guys heard anything
about that tournament

349
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,333
between the universes
Zenny was talking about?

350
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,666
You just called him Zenny?
Are you serious?

351
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,291
Yeah, Zenny! Catchy, right?

352
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,041
His name is Grand Zeno!

353
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,000
[GOKU]
Okay, whatever.

354
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,291
You don't have to nitpick.

355
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,750
Just forget about
that tournament.

356
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:13,583
[GOKU] Why? Didn't you just
say I need to fight more?

357
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:16,583
And a contest between
the universes sounds amazing!

358
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:18,291
Don't worry,
you don't have to plan it!

359
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,458
With this magic button,
I can pop over there

360
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,000
and ask Zenny on my own!

361
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,958
[BEERUS]
What an imbecile!

362
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,000
Take my advice, Goku,
and stay as far away

363
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,000
from the Omni-King as you can!

364
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:30,583
What's the big deal? It's just
a friendly tournament!

365
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:31,916
And it was all his idea!

366
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,583
Lord Beerus is quite right
to advise caution, Goku.

367
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,791
This could be far more
perilous than you understand.

368
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,666
Because the other universes
have fighters you think

369
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,541
I'd be afriad of, is that why?

370
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,083
--[BEERUS] No.
--[GOKU] Uh-uh!

371
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:46,250
The one you should be
afraid of is Grand Zeno himself.

372
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:48,000
What, how is <i>he</i> scary?

373
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,250
How can you ask that question?

374
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,875
The Omni-King
is a pure, noble being.

375
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,625
To you, that may seem childish.

376
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:57,708
But that purity has
a terrifying side as well.

377
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,291
[WHIS]
Don't forget he can nullify

378
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:00,916
a universe in an instant.

379
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,708
Or the whole cosmos
if he chooses.

380
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,458
Yeah, I saw that first hand.

381
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:07,000
He wiped out
Trunks' entire future.

382
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:08,250
[BEERUS]
Mmm.

383
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:11,333
Still, there was
a reason for that.

384
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:14,375
If I push this button,
then Zenny will come here.

385
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:17,791
And if I push this one,
I'll go to him.

386
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,958
Wanna guess which one
I'm gonna pick?

387
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,875
Don't you dare.
I warned you, Saiyan,

388
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,583
this is not some kind of game.

389
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,333
Perhaps I have become
too lax with you,

390
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,291
like a master who
doesn't train his pet

391
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:33,083
and then has to
put the poor thing down.

392
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:36,541
Your naivety may be an even
greater threat to this universe

393
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:39,291
than Grand Zeno himself.

[GOKU] Listen, I can't
really tell you guys apart,

405
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,000
but a while back,
one of you said

406
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,541
you wanted to have
a big tournament

407
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:23,416
between all
the universes. Remember?

408
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,041
So what's going on with that?

409
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,000
'Cause I'm kinda
getting tired of waiting.

410
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,000
Oh! I forgot all about that!

411
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,083
Okay, so you must be
the present-day Zenny

412

from our timeline.

413
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:35,041
And that would make you the
Zenny from the future, right?

414
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,958
--A big tournament?
--Uh-huh.

Why else wouldn't you
do something that cool?

417

What is a tournament?
Is it fun?

Yes, a tournament
is very, very fun.

of the tournament,

Easy! What was that for?

00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,875
That's for ignoring my warning,
and for making me look.

Hey, Whis,
would you mind taking me

453

to our World of the Kais?

And for what reason?

he'd tell the Supreme Kais

want to hear it when they do.

00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,250
I suppose you could say that.

471
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,833
Gentlemen, it's been too long
since our last visit.

472
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,708
[ALL]
Grand Minister to the Omni-King!

473
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:55,083
We're humbled by your presence!

474
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,291
[GRAND MINISTER]
Oh, Goku.

475
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:57,916
Thank you for your help earlier.

476
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,791
You've cured
the Omni-Kings' boredom.

477
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:01,708
And the tournament
details have been decided.

478
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:03,500
[GOKU]
Great, man! Let's hear it!

479
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,208
[ELDER KAI]
Bow down, you nincompoop!

480
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,583
And don't call him "man"!

481
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:09,541
Don't worry,
it's quite all right.

482
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,791
I shall now read
the joint royal decree

483
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:15,208
of their majesties
the Omni-Kings.

484
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:19,875
On day 3,135,500,603

485
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:23,083
of the Royal Calendar,
at precisely 1:57 o'clock,

486
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:26,541
the Tournament of Power shall
commence in all its glory.

487
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:30,458
Ten warriors from each universe
shall engage in epic combat!

488
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,166
So now we have to look for ten?

489
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,833
The Tournament of Power, huh?

490
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:38,208
Aw, yes! My heart's
really pumping now!

491
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,916
[NARRATOR] And so,
with that divine decree,

492
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,166
a new tournament is born.

493
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,583
An ultimate contest
that will be unlike anything

494
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,583
the cosmos has ever seen.

495
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:53,083
Some fighters sense the coming
storm, and some have no idea.

496
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:57,041
But for all of them,
the impact will be profound.

497
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,333
<i>An angel and a demon sit</i>

498
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:03,458
<i>One to my right,</i>
<i>one to my left</i>

499
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:09,541
<i>In between I'm tryin'</i>
<i>to figure out the right way</i>

500
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:12,458
<i>Is one way good?</i>
<i>Is one way bad?</i>

501
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:15,625
<i>Too much confusion in my head</i>

502
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:21,000
<i>I can't think with all</i>
<i>this noise, I'm goin' crazy</i>

503
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:25,083
<i>Is there any way to know</i>
<i>what's right or wrong?</i>

504
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:29,916
<i>Demons in an angel mask</i>

505
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,083
<i>Hopin' that I'll do</i>
<i>just what they ask</i>

506
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:36,166
<i>Telling me</i>
<i>they know what's right</i>

507
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,125
<i>Lead me to the light</i>

508
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:42,083
<i>"For the sake of everyone</i>

509
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:45,083
<i>You have to destroy</i>
<i>the evil ones</i>

510
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:48,083
<i>That's the only path, you see"</i>

511
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:51,750
<i>So they said to me</i>

512
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:01,791
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

513
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:04,375
And I can't tell you how pumped
I am for this tournament!

514
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:06,458
I mean, I'm bouncing
off the walls!

515
00:23:06,541 --> 00:23:08,166
But before we can
get to the main event,

516
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:11,416
the Grand Zeno from the
alternate future needs a demo--

517
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,458
he doesn't even know what
a martial arts contest is!

518
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:16,708
So we'll just have to show him!

519
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:19,125
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

520
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:21,708
"Even the Universes' Gods
are Appalled?!

521
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:24,250
The Lose-and-Perish
'Tournament of Power.'"

522
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:27,125
Make sure you don't
miss it, okay?
