168

That's Grand Zeno.

Hm? No, no, wasn't me.

I would not even
deign to guess.

187

should be cleaned up, right?

Yes, it should.

your apprentice more
carefully, Kai.

Yes.

some downtime.

00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,750
Clever. Was this
your idea, Whis?

266
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,291
Not at all.
This was Goku's brainchild.

267
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:07,041
Mm. I must admit, I'm envious
of your Universe Seven.

Well, you're more than welcome
to pay us a visit sometime,

my dear father.

270
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,916
Yes. Perhaps I shall.

[ZENOS laughing]

[GOKU chuckles]

273
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,333
[WHIS]
I've been thinking, Trunks,

274
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,375
and I do believe
it's possible to return you

275
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,541
to your timeline
before the obliteration,

276
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,291
and make,
shall we say... corrections.

277
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:30,625
Seriously?

278
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:33,875
Absolutely not, Whis,
you stay out of this!

279
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,541
You know as well as I do--

280
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:38,291
That would create
another Time Ring!

281
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,541
These Earthlings have
caused enough messes.

282
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:43,250
How would you
explain that to Zeno?

283
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,958
That is an interesting position
for you to take, my lord.

284
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,458
Considering that when
you chose to destroy Zamasu,

285
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:51,625
you produced an alternate
reality and Time Ring yourself.

286
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,541
[BEERUS]
Eh! Wait, I did what?

287
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,625
You mean you didn't know?

288
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:58,750
Zamasu's Time Ring travels
had made a rare "causal loop,"

289
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,166
and when you destroyed him
you broke that loop,

290
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,500
necessitating yet another
temporal divergence:

291
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,000
One where he was destroyed.

292
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,958
And one where he was not.

293
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,791
After all your scolding of the
Earthlings for splitting time,

294
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,250
you went and did it, too.

295
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:15,291
What? No I--!
Uh... okay, maybe I did.

296
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,833
Wait a minute! If you're
planning to take Trunks and Mai

297
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:20,375
back to their future
before Zeno destroys it,

298
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,375
doesn't that mean Zamasu
will still be there

299
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:23,625
waiting to attack?

300
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,291
Yeah, Mom's right!
And then the whole thing

301
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,958
will just repeat itself!

302
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:30,375
[WHIS]
You needn't worry about that.

303
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,875
I'll speak to the Lord Beerus
in your timeline.

304
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,750
Before he vanishes as a result
of your Supreme Kai's death

305
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,750
and explain the situation.
I will ask him to eliminate

306
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:41,500
your Zamasu and
I'm certain he will oblige.

307
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,208
I don't know, Whis.
It could work,

308
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,708
but we're not sure when
he made himself invincible.

309
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,416
What if that's already happened?

310
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,208
That's right,
and even if Lord Beerus

311
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:53,208
can vaporize his body like
Trunks did with that sword,

312
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,833
he'll turn into that ether
and they're still screwed!

313
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,333
[WHIS laughs]

314
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,708
I have something even better
than your Containment Wave

315
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:03,041
and that adorable
little jar with the seal.

316
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,416
[GOKU gasps]

317
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,416
And you're just telling
all of us now?

318
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,125
[BEERUS]
Don't be pathetic!

319
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,708
You Saiyans are
getting hooked on divine help.

320
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,500
Come on, please.

321
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:15,458
[WHIS] But there's
one problem I can't solve.

322
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,500
Naturally,
if I take Trunks and Mai

323
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:19,250
to an earlier point
in their timeline,

324
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,541
they will already be there.

325
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:24,458
Two versions of each of you,
forced to coexist.

326
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,708
Can you do that?

327
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,500
You mean...

328
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,458
[FUTURE MAI]
It's fine with me.

329
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,083
[ALL gasp]

330
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,375
You sure?

331
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:42,958
If that's the price
to enter a world where

332
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,333
everyone we fought with
is alive,

333
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:48,375
well then, if you ask me
that's a pretty good bargain.

334
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:49,833
[gasps]

335
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:54,666
[FUTURE TRUNKS]
You're right. Of course you are.

336
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:59,083
Aw. A quiet gaze as they
face their future together.

337
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,791
Dreamy!

338
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:03,125
[TRUNKS]
Hm?

339
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,125
[MAI]
Mmm.

340
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,791
Uuuh!

341
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,583
[BEERUS]
Time to go, Whis.

342
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,416
[WHIS]
As you wish, my lord.

343
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,333
--Hey, future boy.
--Yes?

344
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:17,500
[BEERUS] Since Whis likes you,
I'll absolve you, this time.

345
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,333
Now have a good life.

346
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:38,375
[GOWASU] It was my sin, too,
that forged this ring.

347
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:42,333
I failed you, Zamasu.
We both did.

348
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,708
Hey, are you leaving already?

349
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,250
Yeah. Take care.

350
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:53,291
Love the new coat, kid.
That color looks great on you.

351
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,208
Oh, thank you.

352
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,500
Be proud.
You've taken huge leaps

353
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,041
in a short time, Trunks.

354
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:02,500
It doesn't matter what enemy
comes at you down the line,

355
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,208
you'll always find a way.

356
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,583
Thanks, Goku,
I hope you're right.

357
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,916
[BULMA]
Here. Take these with you.

358
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,458
Lots of food and other goodies
to get you started.

359
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,083
Call it a housewarming gift.

360
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,875
Still taking care of me.

361
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,125
[BULMA]
Just hang in there,

362
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:18,875
and find what makes
you happy, okay?

363
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,291
[FUTURE TRUNKS]
Mom, come on.

364
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,625
[BULMA] You know what?
I like this future son thing.

365
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:25,250
Means way less time
until grandkids!

366
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,583
[FUTURE TRUNKS]
Mom!

367
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,625
Please, tell the future me
she's done great work!

368
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,208
[BOTH]
Right.

369
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,333
You showed up.

370
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,208
[yells]

371
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,666
[TRUNKS]
Bye, big me! Keep training!

372
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,291
And I'll get stronger too, okay!

373
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,208
[sobbing]

374
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,166
I think her heart
just broke in two, sire.

375
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,791
Hey, no need to cry.

376
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:14,458
You're just trading in the
old Trunks for a newer model!

377
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,916
Don't ruin this for me!

378
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:22,250
[FUTURE MAI chuckles]

379
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:27,083
[FUTURE TRUNKS]
Piccolo.

380
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,750
And Gohan, too.

[gasps]

383
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,083
I failed, Gohan.

384
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:51,708
I failed you.

385
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,375
I couldn't save them.

386
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,625
[GOHAN]
You've got this, Trunks!

387
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:05,500
Never doubt that,
you hear me?

388
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,250
Right!

389
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:20,208
You ready now, softy?

[FUTURE TRUNKS sniffs]
Let's go.

391
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,500
[FUTURE TRUNKS]
Thanks so much, everyone.

392

For everything.

and it always will be.

Hey! It's me, Goku!

00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:02,625
And I'm thinking
it's time I finally

413
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:04,208
get rid of King Kai's halo,

414
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:06,416
so I'm collecting Dragon Balls
like the old days,

415
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,458
and summoning
the Eternal Shenron!

to make instead!

fix up King Kai now,
