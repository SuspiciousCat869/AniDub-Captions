00:08:14,776 --> 00:08:16,152
Yeah, I got it.

160
00:08:16,236 --> 00:08:19,364
I'll knock him out before
he tries somethin'!

161
00:08:19,447 --> 00:08:22,659
Justice Kick!

162
00:08:22,742 --> 00:08:24,744
[groans]

163
00:08:24,828 --> 00:08:27,080
[DYSPO chuckles]

164
00:08:27,163 --> 00:08:28,289
Gotcha!

165
00:08:28,373 --> 00:08:29,916
[DYSPO groaning]

166
00:08:31,501 --> 00:08:32,419
What the--?

167
00:08:32,502 --> 00:08:36,840
[DYSPO gasping]

168
00:08:36,923 --> 00:08:40,593
[DYSPO]
You're a-a monster!

169
00:08:40,677 --> 00:08:41,845
Yes I am.

170
00:08:41,928 --> 00:08:46,099
[laughing] And that's
our Maji-kayo for ya!

171
00:08:46,182 --> 00:08:48,351
His freakish body
always prevails!

172
00:08:48,435 --> 00:08:49,227
[MOSCO beeping]

173
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,770
Dyspo tore him into pieces,

174
00:08:50,854 --> 00:08:52,856
and yet he regenerated
in no time!

175
00:08:52,939 --> 00:08:55,483
And now his body is 100% healed.

176
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:58,319
You're a fraud! You pretended
to be helpless!

177
00:08:58,403 --> 00:09:00,405
[MAJI-KAYO laughs]

178
00:09:00,488 --> 00:09:02,407
Those ears are huge, Dyspo--

179
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,200
like parachutes on your head.

180
00:09:04,284 --> 00:09:08,246
I bet if I snip them off you'll
be able to run even faster!

181
00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:12,292
I don't know what's more
twisted, your body or your mind!

182
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,919
Dyspo's clearly having
trouble with that one.

183
00:09:15,003 --> 00:09:17,505
[JIREN]
Step aside.

184
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:19,049
I'll handle it.

185
00:09:19,132 --> 00:09:21,092
[laughing]

186
00:09:21,176 --> 00:09:23,345
Uh?

187
00:09:23,428 --> 00:09:27,307
At last, the big boss steps in!

188
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:30,101
Let's go!

189
00:09:30,185 --> 00:09:31,770
[DYSPO]
Don't take your eyes off me!

190
00:09:31,853 --> 00:09:33,855
What in the...?

191
00:09:33,938 --> 00:09:36,191
I'm sorry, Jiren. I'm out!

192
00:09:37,776 --> 00:09:41,404
Good. You're the one
I came for anyway.

193
00:09:41,488 --> 00:09:44,741
Let's have some fun!
Show me what you've got!

194
00:09:44,824 --> 00:09:46,493
Excellent, Maji-kayo!

195
00:09:46,576 --> 00:09:50,038
Unveil the mystery
of Jiren's power!

196
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:56,211
[MAJI-KAYO grunting, yells]

197
00:09:56,294 --> 00:09:58,797
[MAJI-KAYO screams]

198
00:10:02,425 --> 00:10:05,970
Ahh! All that, from
a mere shockwave?!

199
00:10:09,683 --> 00:10:11,601
[gasping]

200
00:10:12,435 --> 00:10:13,937
As we said.

201
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:17,232
Numbers will not be an issue.

202
00:10:24,906 --> 00:10:28,660
[sighs] Aw, for real?

203
00:10:28,743 --> 00:10:30,453
That's what I was going to say!

204
00:10:30,537 --> 00:10:32,747
How am I supposed to
conduct my research

205
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,250
if you get tossed out
from a single attack?

206
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,835
[ZENO]
Boop! Heh.

207
00:10:36,918 --> 00:10:38,211
One more is gone!

208
00:10:38,294 --> 00:10:40,213
That means there are 35!

209
00:10:40,296 --> 00:10:43,633
Fuwa. What to do, what to do?

210
00:10:43,717 --> 00:10:46,344
Calm down! Man up, already!

211
00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:49,264
[FUWA] But that Jiren
fellow is so strong!

212
00:10:49,347 --> 00:10:51,266
How are we going to stop him?

213
00:10:51,349 --> 00:10:53,852
Whoever has the most fighters
in the ring when time

214
00:10:53,935 --> 00:10:56,855
runs out wins, so we should
focus on weakening the Seventh,

215
00:10:56,938 --> 00:10:59,232
not worry about one guy
on a losing team!

216
00:10:59,315 --> 00:11:01,067
--[VADOS] Lord Champa?
--Eh?

217
00:11:01,151 --> 00:11:05,363
Pay attention, sir.
Our man is making his move.

218
00:11:08,867 --> 00:11:13,038
[ROSHI sighs] That's what
stinks about being old.

219
00:11:13,121 --> 00:11:14,748
I just don't have the stamina.

220
00:11:14,831 --> 00:11:18,793
[FROST] Yes, you do look
dreadfully weary.

221
00:11:18,877 --> 00:11:20,712
[FROST chuckles]

222
00:11:27,677 --> 00:11:28,845
Are you looking for someone?

[ROSHI gasping]

224
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,059
[GOKU gasping]
Master Roshi!

225
00:11:34,142 --> 00:11:35,769
Hold on!

226
00:11:36,436 --> 00:11:38,605
[BRIANNE]
I'm back, foe from the Seventh!

227
00:11:38,688 --> 00:11:41,566
Time to settle the score!

228
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:42,776
Outta my way!

229
00:11:42,859 --> 00:11:45,945
[ROSHI groaning]

230
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:48,323
You're barely resisting
at all, old man.

231
00:11:48,406 --> 00:11:51,493
Where is the fun in that?

232
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:54,662
[ROSHI]
I know what you're doing.

233
00:11:54,746 --> 00:11:56,706
You start by
picking off the weak,

234
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:59,209
then you'll try to snake your
way up to the strongest

235
00:11:59,292 --> 00:12:02,003
on our team, with
some ambush or trick.

236
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:05,965
You're as sneaky and as
spineless as ever-- Ah!

237
00:12:06,049 --> 00:12:08,510
What is it about the feeble
elderly that makes them

238
00:12:08,593 --> 00:12:10,428
rattle on so incessantly?

239
00:12:10,512 --> 00:12:14,307
I'll toss you from the ring
just to stop the chatter!

240
00:12:16,101 --> 00:12:18,853
[ROSHI grunting]

[ROSHI yelps]

244
00:12:34,953 --> 00:12:38,498
This pesky rule about not
killing our foes. It's hard

245
00:12:38,581 --> 00:12:42,252
to hold back my strength against
such delicate flowers.

247

No! He missed it!

00:13:41,227 --> 00:13:43,355
Aw, damn it!

265
00:13:47,567 --> 00:13:49,027
So...

266
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,946
All this time the old geezer
had this trick up his sleeve.

267
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,740
How naughty.

268
00:14:01,289 --> 00:14:03,291

Hold on.

[FROST]
I admit you almost got me.

272
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:14,552
But who would've guessed
you still posed such a threat?

[FROST laughs] A technique for
sealing away problematic foes.

279
00:14:55,135 --> 00:14:57,804
That could prove rather useful.

280
00:15:00,181 --> 00:15:03,184
Have one of those
senzus on standby.

281

That old man has
reached his limit.

282

to feed him one before he dies.

Now then, it's time to make
your defeat official.

[FROST] Fair warning, this
ejection is going to sting.

Don't get the wrong idea.

00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:39,929
I came to crush that repulsive
bastard, not to save you.

Hm?

It's been far too long, Vegeta.

[VEGETA] Hmph! And too long
into this tournament for you

297
00:15:51,566 --> 00:15:52,984
to still be in the ring.

298
00:15:53,068 --> 00:15:55,570
[FROST] I'm not the same
as when we fought last.

299
00:15:55,653 --> 00:15:58,323
It would behoove you
to realize that.

00:15:58,406 --> 00:16:00,408
[VEGETA laughs]
Please.

301
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:03,745
Even if you've gotten stronger,
you're still no match for me.

302
00:16:03,828 --> 00:16:07,332
[FROST] Oh no, you've
misunderstood completely.

303
00:16:07,415 --> 00:16:09,751
I mean I've gotten weaker.

304
00:16:09,834 --> 00:16:11,169
[VEGETA]
Hm?

305
00:16:11,252 --> 00:16:12,962
[FROST]
As a result of my misdeeds

306
00:16:13,046 --> 00:16:16,341
in the Sixth Universe being
revealed, I've become a fugitive

307
00:16:16,424 --> 00:16:21,846
criminal, and all that running
has sapped my vigor. [laughs]

308
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,848
I mean, just look at me.

309
00:16:23,932 --> 00:16:25,975
After that opening
salvo of yours,

310
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:28,561
I can barely stand on my feet.

311
00:16:28,645 --> 00:16:30,313
One more of your mighty punches

312
00:16:30,397 --> 00:16:32,357
before I've recovered
could kill me.

313

[VEGETA]
Stop trying to buy time, coward.

314

[FROST]
Mm? [chuckles]

00:16:37,362 --> 00:16:41,282
Was it that obvious?
I guess there's no fooling you.

Never underestimate
the wits of a Saiyan.

[VEGETA grunts]

318
00:16:44,953 --> 00:16:46,454
I confess,

319
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:49,791
ever since our first tournament
when you shamed me in battle,

320
00:16:49,874 --> 00:16:53,169
I've been thinking about
something obsessively.

321
00:16:53,253 --> 00:16:55,755
What would be the best
way to defeat you?

Don't expect your name-calling

00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,162
to work just because
Botamo's not here.

The tin can and the coward.

Could there ever be a
more pathetic tag team?

339
00:17:32,709 --> 00:17:35,670
You certainly enjoy your
insults, don't you, Vegeta?

340
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:37,422
Meanwhile, I will enjoy

341
00:17:37,505 --> 00:17:39,591
beating you within
an inch of your life!

00:17:52,979 --> 00:17:55,774
As a Metalman, Magetta
is nearly impervious.

348
00:17:55,857 --> 00:17:58,610
Normal attacks will never
force him from the ring.

349
00:17:58,693 --> 00:18:01,780
That would take something
far more spectacular.

right here.

The old guy.
He just won't quit.

It's his best chance.

That's crazy, it would be
his third time to try it!

Master Roshi, no!
Please, it's too draining!

One more time could kill you!

00:18:19,547 --> 00:18:22,467
[ROSHI] I don't care about my
old shell of a life any more.

359
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,386
At least I'll make it count!
