Okay, enough moping!

I gotta be strong and
help him out of his funk!

I'll whip up his favorite meal
and make it so good

00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,166
he won't resist whether
he's hungry or not!

You got a lot of people

to be his assistant

[GOHAN] Um, yeah. I mean,
I'm finding out about that now.

197
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,416
Are you at my house?

198
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,750
With your mom and brother.

00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,416
It's actually kind of
a long story.

00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,000
What? Is there anything wrong?

201

Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Seriously?

202
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,750
I'm just glad no one was hurt.

203
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:59,041
Well if he said complete rest,
that's what you've gotta do.

204
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,583
You've hardly ever
gotten sick, Dad.

205

Are you sure
you're all right?

206
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:05,166
Yeah. Yeah, of course
you can stay.

207
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,791
As long you need to;
we've got plenty of room.

208

get things in order here,

I call good intel.

Do I good job, heh.

Wow, an assistant professor
at a real live college!

Aah! My Gohan's a

Don't think this gets you

out of the doghouse,
Goku! Not even close!

219
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,125
Do you know how much
it's gonna cost

220
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:35,833
to rebuild this place
after you became

221
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,541
a flying wrecking ball?!

222
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,791
It's a good thing we have
that hundred million zeni

223
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:43,083
from Mr. Satan or
we'd be totally ruined!

I thought you put
all that money toward

Wait a second. Does that mean
you've been fibbing?

228
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,125
[CHICHI] Well, I had to
say that so you'd work

229
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:54,666
instead of running off to train!
Not that it made any difference.

230
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,583
And I did say
we should save the rest,

231
00:10:56,666 --> 00:11:00,625
which we are,
for Goten's education.

[CHICHI]
Are you leaving?

235
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,083
[PICCOLO] Of course I am.
I said I'd look after Pan

236
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,916
because that job's
important to Gohan

237
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,833
and I didn't want him
to miss it.

238
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,500
But now you can watch her.

239
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:16,250
Agreed? No offense
but I have work to do.

00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:17,500
Yeah, that's cool!

241
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:19,958
I trust you can handle
the baby food, Chichi?

242
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,208
I've got two boys,
thank you very much!

00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,125
I'll be fine! I'll see
what they've got

244
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,500
and throw something together!

245
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,875
Pan likes hotcakes made with
tuna and tofu leftovers,

246
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:30,250
finely chopped carrots,
onions, spinach, and broccoli.

247
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:33,833
And definitely no celery because
she hates celery, got it?

248
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,000
Yes, sir!

249
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,500
She's a fast crawler
and likes to explore

250
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,125
so keep an eye on her
at all times.

251
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:39,416
She likes her fish book
and when you

252
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,416
make her bunny go hop-hop.

253
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,583
And, if she cries at night
just sing to her.

254
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:47,791
No way! Let me get this
straight. You actually sing?

255
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,291
[PICCOLO grunts]

256
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,958
Anyway, Pan gets shy,

257
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,541
especially when
her parents are out.

258
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:53,833
I'm the only person
who's been able to

259
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,416
hold her without her crying.

260
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,750
So, if you can't figure out
how to calm her down,

only water; no toothpaste.

I know she doesn't
have all of her teeth yet

for good oral hygiene!

better, I'd take you
