[GOKU BLACK groaning]

[BOTH gasp]

165
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,083
Whoa, what's happening to him?

166
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,958
That pull. The distortion
in space-time

167
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:55,875
must be dissipating.
It's going back to normal.

168
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,375
[GOKU BLACK grunting]

169
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,208
How could you?

170
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,458
[laughing]
Aaah!

171
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,750
[GOKU]
Hey!

172
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,541
[KRILLIN]
Okay. That's a new one.

173
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,625
I'm not sensing his energy.

174
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:16,000
It's almost as if
he completely vanished.

175
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:19,333
Our invader didn't disappear
by his own choice, did he?

176
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,375
Hard to know for sure, my lord.

177
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:24,041
But it's most likely that
machine created a considerable

178
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:26,041
warp in the space-time
as it passed through it.

179
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,000
And that Time Ring
reacted to the warp,

180
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,583
pulling Black to
this time somewhat like

181
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,583
a planet spiraling down
into a gravity well.

182
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:35,333
As the disturbance subsided
and space-time returned

183
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:37,875
to its former state,
the pull ceased, too.

184
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,250
So, like a marble
in a drawn slingshot,

185
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:43,000
when the pulling force let go,
Black was launched back

186
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,958
into the time
from which he came.

187
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:47,458
No more pull, so no more Black.

188
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,958
You might say he
ran out of time.

189
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,500
[gasps]

190
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,916
So I'm back to the future?

[chuckles, groaning]

194
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:27,666
So, Goku. That's what
the power of your exalted

195
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,875
Super Saiyan
transformation feels like.

196
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:35,125
It's quite a different thing
to experience how you fight

197
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:38,958
firsthand now that I can
apply it so directly to myself.

198
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,250
All those battles
with Trunks were instructive,

199
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:44,791
but this will help me hone
my strength so much further.

200
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:49,583
[breathes heavily]

201
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:56,500
No. Looks like I won't be
able to go back there again.

202
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:01,791
But, that's okay,

203
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,375
because I've destroyed
their time machine.

204
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:08,791
Which means Trunks can never
come back to this time, either.

205
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:17,833
[laughing]

206
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:23,166
At last! There is no one left
in this world who can resist me.

207
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,458
Uh--

208
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:43,416
So, what do you think
happened to him?

209
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,791
[FUTURE TRUNKS] I'm sure
he returned to my future.

210
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,375
[grunts]

211
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:52,916
But now I can't get back there.
And I was so close! I failed.

212
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,416
Father said he'd go.
And Goku, too!

213
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,541
Working together,
I know we could have won!

214
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:02,500
I was the only one who could
stand up to him in my time.

215
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,583
Now he has no one.

216
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:07,541
He's going to exterminate
all of mankind!

217
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:10,541
Just like he always
said he would.

218
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,000
Tell me.

219
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,666
Compared to all the
other times you went up

220
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,333
against Black in your future,

221
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,958
just how strong did he seem
during our fight?

222
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:32,750
He's shown me more power.

223
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,708
But I wouldn't say
it's much more.

224
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,250
So he was only holding back
a little against me?

225
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:38,750
Yeah. I think.

226
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:39,750
--Awesome!
--[VEGETA] Good,

227
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,375
then you can relax!

228
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:44,416
Kakarot's true battle power is
a great deal higher than that.

229
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,000
[FUTURE TRUNKS]
What?

230
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,666
And let me state for the record,
the same goes for mine as well.

231
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,250
[FUTURE TRUNKS] How? What have
you guys been through?

232
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,291
Hah. Quite a bit.

233
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,791
Black might be
weaker than you now,

234
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,791
but I felt his energy
growing rapidly

235
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,250
when he was fighting you.

236
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:03,416
Yeah. There's no telling
how deep it goes.

[PILAF, MAI, SHOU

Oh, wait, don't do that.
There's smoke.

[BULMA chuckles]
Right.

Can you fix that
time machine, Mom?

253

[BULMA] I'm afraid
there's too much damage.

254
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,833
I'll have to start from scratch.

255
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:48,250
But can't you build
a new one using those notes?

256
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,875
Well...

[BULMA]
Hmmm.

258
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:00,958
Augh! This might be
too much for the current me.

259
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:03,000
Aw, really?

Oh, yes, of course!

Uh, Mom? Hey!

I put it here somewhere.

264
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:23,916
Honestly! It's like
my whole lab's a junk drawer!

265
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:31,208
I can't believe it's gone.
That was my world's final hope.

266
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,458
[BEERUS] Yes, I'm sure
that's upsetting for you,

267
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:37,375
but at least that means mankind
can no longer tamper with time.

268
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:40,666
[WHIS] These events raise other
vexing questions, though.

269
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,291
Did any of you notice
the ring Black was wearing?

270
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,333
On his right hand?

271
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:46,833
Yeah, so?

272
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,541
Well, it happens
to have been a Time Ring,

273
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,333
which only Supreme Kai
are allowed to use.

274
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,083
Most puzzling, wouldn't you say?

275
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,166
--[GOKU] Whoa!
--What's a Time Ring?

276
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,166
Are you saying that means
Goku Black is a Supreme Kai?

277
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,500
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
Supreme Kai are divine beings,

278
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:03,375
and they certainly do not
look like Saiyans.

279
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,416
If Black's not a Supreme Kai,
then who is he?

280
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,875
You got me. Maybe Whis
knows something.

281
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:13,666
Time Rings are only designed
to take you into the future.

282
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,791
They only move back
when returning travelers

283
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,291
to the time
from which they came.

284
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,750
It is normally impossible
to travel any farther back

285
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,625
than your own relative present.

286
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,416
Again, traveling to the past
is strictly forbidden,

287
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,958
even for deities,
due to the grievous

288
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,666
complexities it creates.

289
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,250
[GOKU]
Hmm.

290
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,625
So you can't go to the past to
get a present for your relative?

291
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,625
I get confused just
talking about this stuff.

292
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:35,666
Something's happened
that shouldn't have, Goku.

293
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,666
That's all that
you need to worry about.

294
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,916
[FUTURE TRUNKS] If Black has
a Time Ring and isn't a Kai,

295
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,625
maybe I could use one, too!

296
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:45,833
May I borrow your ring, great
deity, to reach the future?

297
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,375
Are you trying to anger me
on purpose, mortal?

298
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:52,083
Keep it up and I'll do as my
title suggests, and destroy you.

299
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:53,291
[gasps]

300
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:54,916
Like my attendant told you,

301
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,375
I'm a Destroyer god
and only Supreme Kai

302
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:00,041
are allowed Time Rings,
so there's nothing to lend.

303
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:02,208
Oh. I'm sorry.

304
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:05,583
But I have to get back
to my time somehow.

305
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,541
Or it's all over.

306
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,125
What did we say?

307
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,291
Fiddling with time
is a serious transgression,

308
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:14,291
you've no doubt caused
enough complication already!

309
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,125
It's become painfully clear
you and Black

310
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,250
are nothing but trouble.

311
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:21,541
You think Black could
get back here again?

312
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:24,708
Good question.
If my theory's right, then no.

313
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:27,416
His traveling here was a freak
occurrence, not intentional.

314
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,791
Aw, man. But, if he can't
come back to this time

315
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,583
and we can't go there either,
how am I gonna fight him again?

316
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,333
Wait! Can't you do it, Whis?!

Excuse me?

Your power! You know!

319
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,125
That do-over thing
you did against Frieza

320
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,791
to roll back time!

321
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,333
Can't you just rewind everything

322
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,625
to before Black blew up
the time machine?

I'm only capable of
turning back by three minutes,

and it's been
much longer than that.

Sorry, you've missed the boat.

I forgot how it felt to succeed!

333
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,750
Yes, well, now that
we're living in this

334
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,833
gazillionaire's paradise
it's only right

335
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:14,208
that we make ourselves useful
and earn our keep!

336
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:15,625
You're right we should
earn our keep,

337
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,500
but I'd say we've earned
a little extra.

338
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:18,708
Don't you agree?

339
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,166
Of course, which is why
I'll be demanding

340
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,750
a generous cash donation,

We must see this through,

00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,583
even if we have
to sacrifice everything.

347
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:46,958
You're the last hope we've got,
son; it's all up to you.

348
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,750
I'm sorry mom, but I can't
keep that promise now.

349
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,250
You're the best chance
that we've got;

350

you have to survive!

I can't.

You don't give up.
You find a way.

353
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:20,791
Right.

354
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:23,875
So, Whis. Should we guess what
our troublemakers will do next?

355
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:26,083
Well, I just heard Vegeta
tell his future son

356
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,416
not to give up.

357
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,625
Mortals are always
so quick to say that.

358
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:32,625
But sometimes there are
forces beyond your control.

359
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:35,791
Knowing when to give up's
an important skill, too.

360
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,625
Speaking of
uncontrollable forces,

361
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,541
where are the
other fish sausages?

362
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:40,833
They're in my belly.

363
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,916
That's what I was
afraid of, my lord.

364
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,500
I guess that means
this fine specimen

365
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,875
I've been holding
is the last one.

366
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,291
I bet you'd love to eat this.

367
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:52,500
But as you said, we all
have to know when to give up.

Oh! So delicious!
