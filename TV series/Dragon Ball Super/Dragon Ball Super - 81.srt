00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:35,041
Why yes, we are. It's
rather nice being exempted.

164
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,458
We can just relax
and enjoy the show.

165

Like us, their mortal levels
are too high to be at risk.

166
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,500
That's one of the many
benefits of a universe

167
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,416
having excellent
divine guidance.

168
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,291
Yes, naturally it
reflects well on us.

169
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,541
I mean, how could a universe
have a higher mortal level

170
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,708
unless its gods were
a higher level too?

We didn't even know that
mortal levels were a thing.

No, Dad, stop attacking him!

He's obviously absorbing your

You don't stand a chance,

207
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:36,541
Bergamo the Crusher can
absorb and convert any attack

208
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,666
into raw energy to grow in size,

209

then hit back twice
as strong as before!

You know Dad.

The reason he asked
for this tournament

is to fight the strongest
guys in the cosmos.

That means getting
Bergamo as big as he can.

Goku intentionally made
Bergamo as strong as possible,

but in a way, I was just
fighting against myself.

and then fight me
with only that.

00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,125
[GOKU]
All right!

323
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:21,666
Then bring it on, guys!
I'll face all of you!

324
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,333
I love a good challenge!

325
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:26,416
Send all your strongest
warriors against me at once!

326
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,000
I'll clobber every single
one of 'em! Woo!

327
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:34,875
[DEITIES chattering]

328
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,458
[GOHAN]
Heh.

329
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:39,958
Did the Expo excite you for the
tournament proper, Grand Zenos?

330
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:42,750
Shall I tell our visitors that
we'll be proceeding as planned?

331
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,666
Oh, yes! That was
super in every way!

332
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,625
Super is the word
I was thinking, too!

333
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:52,250
[BOTH] We super-can't wait
for the Tournament of Power!

334
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:55,583
Assembled deities from
across the great Cosmos,

335
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:58,250
the three matches between the
Seventh and Ninth Universes

336
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,666
has brought much pleasure
to the Omni-Kings.

337
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,166
The Zeno Expo is an
unmitigated success!

338
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,916
Since that means we'll be moving
on to the Tournament of Power,

339
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,375
allow me to explain its rules.

340
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,208
[GRAND MINISTER] The Null Realm
will be home to this ring,

341
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,208
specially built for
the tournament.

342
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:19,625
If you knock an opponent out
of the ring, they lose.

343
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,375
Rather simple, is it not?

344
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,833
[GOKU] What if you knock out
your opponent in the ring?

345
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:27,416
[GRAND MINISTER] Then push them
out to complete the elimination.

346
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,333
Furthermore, now
that the Zeno Expo

347
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,000
has given us more
time to consider,

348
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,875
we have decided to add
a few other prohibitions.

349
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,291
Number One:

350
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:39,416
The use of any outside
weapons is strictly forbidden.

351
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:44,125
Number Two: You are not
allowed to kill any opponents!

352
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:47,583
Number Three: Any advanced
techniques that enable flight

353
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:50,250
will not work in the Null Realm.

354
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:53,291
Taking away flight
definitely changes things.

355
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:56,083
It means winning is going
to take a lot more strategy.

356
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:59,833
Finally, there'll be a
time limit of 100 tacks.

357
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:03,708
[WHIS] Translated to Earth time,
that comes out to 48 minutes.

358
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:06,416
That seems like a rather
long time for each match.

359
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,000
With so many strong fighters,

360
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,458
isn't there a risk the
tournament goes on for too long?

361
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,625
The tournament will
not be one-one-one.

362
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,791
Every fighter will compete
against every one else

363
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,875
at the exact same time.

364
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:20,916
In other words, the tournament
is just one match.

365
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,250
That's not a tournament,

366
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:25,541
that's an eight universe,
80-fighter battle royal!

367
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:29,583
All those guys fighting in
one place, at one time?

368
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,791
Don't worry, you'll
have plenty of space.

369
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,458
The ring we're constructing
is quite large.

370
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:37,333
Everyone will fight until
the clock hits zero,

371
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:39,500
whereupon the universe
with the most fighters left

372
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,625
will be declared winner.

373
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:44,000
Of course, in the event one
team defeats all others

374
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,333
before time runs out, that
universe will be victorious.

375
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:50,583
If we want our universe to live,
they have to fight as a team.

376
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,333
[WHIS chuckles]

377
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,958
Teamwork does not strike
me as Goku's strength.

378
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,208
[BEERUS]
This thing gets worse and worse.

379
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,083
What? I can do teamwork!

380
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,291
Plus, Gohan's all
about that kinda stuff.

381
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,583
As long as we've got
you, we'll be fine!

382
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:06,541
Right, son? Team-buildin'?

383
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:07,625
You know.

384
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,041
Gee, thanks, Dad.
No pressure, huh.

385
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,458
[GRAND MINISTER] The Omni-Kings
look forward to a valiant fight

386
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:15,125
from each competing universe.

387
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,000
[EA]
A battle royal?

388
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,666
The fate of our entire universe

389
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,625
rests on the outcome
of a glorified riot?

390
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:22,750
[BOTH]
Hm.

391
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,791
This situation is
far from ideal.

392
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,083
[TOP]
Hm.

393
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:30,166
Excuse me.

394
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,041
Goku!

395
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,208
[GOKU]
Uh?

396
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,041
[chuckles]

397
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:37,708
[FUTURE ZENO]
Wha--?

398
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,208
[ZENO]
What?

399
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,916
Fighter, state your name!

400
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,083
[TOP] Grand Minister, forgive me
for barging forward like this.

401
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,416
Greetings, Goku!

402
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,875
I'd like to have a word
with you, if I may.

403
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,958
I can't see anything.

404
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,375
Yes, you're in the way!

405
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,416
[TOP]
Know this, sir!

406
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,791
I'm the leader of the Eleventh's
most elite combat unit!

407
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:10,916
The gallant, and handsome,
Pride Troopers!

408
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,708
I am the warrior of
freedom. I am Top!

409
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,583
Fight me, Goku!

410
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:20,666
Right now. In single-combat!

411
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:24,041
And I warn you: If you
fight without honor,

412
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:27,916
then my righteous fists
will be your ruin.

413
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,500
You're on!

414
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,625
You don't look like any more of
a challenge than the last guy!

415
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:34,875
I've made many-a-solemn-vow
in my day

416
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:38,125
to fight evil-doers,
wherever they are!

417
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:41,458
So I'm the bad guy here,
huh? Well, this'll be fun!

418
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:45,000
[NARRATOR] And just like that,
Goku faces a new challenge!

419
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:48,875
A warrior from the Eleventh
Universe named Top!

420
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:52,541
How will Goku fare against a
man who thinks he's a villain?

421
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:56,125
Find out next time on
Dragon Ball Super.

422
00:21:57,375 --> 00:22:00,208
<i>An angel and a demon sit</i>

<i>Too much confusion in my head</i>

<i>I can't think with all</i>
<i>this noise, I'm goin' crazy</i>

428
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:24,916
<i>Is there any way to know</i>

00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:51,583
<i>So they said to me</i>

[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

438
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:04,208
My new opponent is Top,
a by-the-books warrior

439
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:07,041
from the Eleventh Universe,
loaded with power!

440
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:10,666
And get this, he says
I'm a bad guy! Me!

441
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,083
That's okay, though.

442
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:14,250
I've been waiting for an
opponent who pushes my buttons.

443
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:16,166
I can't wait for us
to throw down.

444
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,750
It's gonna be
next-level bonkers!

445
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:20,875
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

446
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:25,125
"Goku Must Pay! The Warrior
of Justice Top Barges In!"

447
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:27,125
Make sure you don't
miss it, okay?
