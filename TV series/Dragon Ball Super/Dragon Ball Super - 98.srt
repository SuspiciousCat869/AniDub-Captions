I don't understand.
What just happened?

365

They tried to seize an
opportune moment for victory.

366
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,250
But then, after freezing
Vegeta's hand,

367
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,625
they became selfish.

368

With two trying to claim
the triumph for themselves,

369

they went from coordinated
moves to opposing strikes.

370
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,375
Vegeta, of course, took
advantage of the brief mistake.

371
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,083
In turn, that created
a diversion

which Goku was quick to exploit.

Yeah, that's the Saiyan
instinct for ya.

374
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,041
If you give 'em the tiniest
opening to strike

they'll pounce
with a vengeance!

For goodness' sake, this is
all way too stressful for me!

spun should keep you

<i>from your left side</i>

479
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:21,250
<i>Was trying to get</i>
<i>a good look at your face</i>

480
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:25,791
<i>The tears in your eyes;</i>
<i>were you laughing or crying?</i>

481
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,333
<i>Your long hair in the way</i>

482
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:30,458
<i>Blocking the thoughts inside</i>

483
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:34,625
<i>When the time has</i>
<i>come to say goodbye</i>

484
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:37,875
<i>Your voice will</i>

485
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:42,375
<i>Though we may be apart,</i>

486

<i>Forever I will wait,</i>

487
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:51,833
<i>For us to meet again</i>

[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

489
00:22:57,916 --> 00:23:00,458
So, it looks like Universe
Four, led by Quitela,

490
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:02,583
is launching an all-out assault,

491
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:05,333
leaving 18 in a tight spot.

492
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:08,125
Hey, Krillin, now might be a
really good time for you guys

493
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:11,208
to try out that new combo
attack you've been working on!

494
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:15,166
C'mon, let's show 'em how
we do it in the Seventh!

495
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,541
Next time, on Dragon Ball Super:

496
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:20,333
"Show Them!
Krillin's Underlying Strength!"

497
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:22,041
Make sure you don't
miss it, okay?
