[NARRATOR] Previously,
on Dragon Ball Super,

26
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:49,958
Goku wanted Frieza as
the team's tenth warrior!

27
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:51,541
[GOKU]
Don't worry, guys.

28
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:55,833
I'll just ask Fortuneteller Baba
to bring him back for 24 hours.

29
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:59,083
[NARRATOR] And so, Goku
visited Hell to convince

30
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:02,500
his old arch-enemy to enter
the Tournament of Power.

31
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:06,041
[FRIEZA]
All right. But on one condition.

32
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:09,041
If in the end we
prove victorious,

33
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:13,083
and our Universe remains intact,

34
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:17,333
you will use the Dragon Balls
to truly bring me back.

35
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:20,958
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
in the Fourth Universe,

36
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,916
Quitela schemed about
Frieza's return.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,750
[QUITELA]
Relax, Kur. I thought of

38
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:28,666
an absolutely brilliant way
to stop the Seventh!

39
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,125
And what would that be?

is anything but assured!

I'm starvin'!

00:02:57,708 --> 00:03:00,833
Well, don't keep us in suspense.
How'd things go with Frieza?

48
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,958
Oh yeah! He's on board.

49
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,750
I'm surprised that
power-mad villain

50
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:07,750
actually agreed to your
24-hour-parole idea.

Uh. Yeah, me, too.

00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,041
Well I figure even Frieza
wants a change of pace.

00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:15,416
Better to get one day off than
be stuck there forever, right?

You're hiding something.
I just know it!

Goku. We always know
when you're lying.

Out with it.

57
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,000
Give us the truth, right now!

[GOKU chuckles nervously]

59
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,708
Okay. Don't be mad,
but I promised Frieza

60
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,958
that if our universe survives
the Tournament of Power

61
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:33,583
I'll gather up the Dragon Balls
and wish him back permanently.

62
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,375
What?!

00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,958
Yeah!

65
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,833
You know he's just gonna go
right back to his old evil ways!

66
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,708
How are you so stupid?!

67
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,750
You don't have to get so angry.

68
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,500
It's the best move
he could make.

69
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:47,750
[GOKU]
Um, thank you!

70
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,708
[WHIS] So what if Frieza
returns to your realm?

71
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:53,000
Compared to Grand Zeno
destroying our entire universe,

72
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,833
I'd say one more villain on the
loose is a small price to pay.

73
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:58,833
Yeah. I guess he's got a point.

00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,916
Look, if Frieza does
anything bad... he'll pay.

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,958
We'll take him down
like we always do.

Yes.

00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,958
I have no doubt about it.

82
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,375
I've sent spies into
each of the universes

83
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,875
and their reports are
always accurate.

84
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:26,416
Sidra, I'm afraid that as soon
as the tournament begins,

85
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,250
the Seventh Universe plans to
crush everyone from your Ninth.

86
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,791
[SIDRA growls]
That miserable Seventh!

87
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:35,041
They'll pay for their insolence!

88
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,250
[QUITELA]
I understand your rage, Sidra.

89
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:40,291
Which is why I'd like to help
you eliminate them first.

90
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:41,791
[SIDRA]
Eliminate them how?

91
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,666
Just what are you
getting at, Quitela?

92
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,250
[QUITELA] My spies inform me
that the Seventh Universe

93
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,958
has drafted the tenth
member of their team.

94
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:52,958
This Frieza is a former emperor
and a powerful warrior.

95
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:55,541
He's on his way to joining
them as we speak.

96
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:56,666
[SIDRA]
Frieza?

97
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,458
[QUITELA]
Yes, and apparently

98
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:01,791
the Seventh Universe considers
him to be quite the villain,

99
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,833
equally feared and loathed.

100
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,291
Which is why I
believe if he were

101
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:08,708
eliminated before
reaching his new team...

102
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,750
...finding out who
did the dirty deed

103
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:14,458
would be all but impossible,
thanks to his many enemies.

104
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,458
We only have about
an hour and a half

105
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,125
before the Tournament starts.

106
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,166
If the Seventh Universe
doesn't show up

107
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,250
with the required
amount of warriors,

108
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:25,416
the Grand Zenos will likely
disqualify and destroy them

109
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,666
before the Tournament
even begins!

110
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,833
[SIDRA]
But wait,

111
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,833
if the Omni-Kings find out
about this plot,

112
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:34,166
won't it be our universes that
ultimately pay the price?

113
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,833
[QUITELA] We'll be fine, as long
as we don't get our hands dirty.

114
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,083
Perhaps you know some "hitmen"

115
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:43,125
who can do the job without
it leading back to us.

116
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,500
[SIDRA]
Hm...

117
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,708
[QUITELA] Good! Then the
next time we see each other

118
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,041
will be at the Tournament.

119
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,833
A Tournament
without the Seventh.

120
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:54,666
[QUITELA] You see, Kuru,
isn't my plan brilliant?

121
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,166
[KUR]
I never doubted you.

122
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,041
And by eliminating their
team before we even start

123
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,375
our own chances of winning
the Tournament of Power

124
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,416
will take a sharp upward turn.

125
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,541
But do you actually trust
Sidra to take out Frieza?

126
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,583
Yes. He's desperate.

127
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,000
[laughing]

128
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:13,125
[TRUNKS]
Mm... Frieza?

129
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:16,500
Hey. What exactly do
all these pictures mean?

130
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,583
[BULMA]
Honey, you're still awake?

131
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:19,791
Bulma, wait.

132
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,291
You haven't spilled
the senzu beans about

133
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:24,333
the tournament to Trunks
and Goten, have you?

134
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:27,416
Are you telling me the boys are
totally in the dark on all this?

135
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,500
Yes.

136
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,791
Oh, jeez. Well,
they can't find out now.

137
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,708
It would only complicate things.

138
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,333
Get him away from that.

139
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:35,916
[TRUNKS]
Huh...

140
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,125
Hey, Trunks, so, this board is
a, uh, a list of family friends

141
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,791
who want to congratulate us
on your sister's birth.

142
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,833
As you can see, many are
already here, just hangin' out.

143
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,416
But hold on a second.

144
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,791
Isn't Frieza that super bad guy
who invaded a while back?

True. But, Frieza's had...

150
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,750
Well, he's turned over
a new leaf, Son.

the good guys now!

Yep.

Damn it all!

00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:19,791
[TRUNKS sighs]

158
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,666
Hey Trunks, I got
something for ya!

159
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,666
So there's this island
with monsters.

160
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,708
Do you wanna come see it?

161
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,541
Wait, are you serious?

162
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:29,583
[GOKU]
Yep! See this guy here named 17?

163
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,958
He works on the monster island
and protects them from poachers.

164
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,750
And what's a "poacher"?

165
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:37,000
[GOKU] Bad guys who
illegally hunt animals.

166
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,291
Or in this case, monsters.

167
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,500
Y'know, because guarding
them is such a big job,

168
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,625
17 hasn't been able
to come congratulate

169
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,500
your mom like he wants.

170
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:47,666
How about this?

171
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,625
You and Goten can
trade places with him.

172
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,541
While he's here
you can guard the island!

173
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,166
And play with all the monsters!

174
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,208
Wait! That's not a--

175
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,583
I'm ready!

176
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,541
Yeah! Let's go right now!

177
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:00,166
Great! Go and tell
Goten what's up.

178
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,833
Then next stop, Monster Island!

179
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,541
[TRUNKS]
Thanks, Goku! This rules!

180
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,291
And that takes care of that.

181
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,791
Hey, hold on.

182
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:10,375
Why do I get the feeling
you already promised 17

183
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,333
the boys would guard his island?

184
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:13,541
Sneaky bastard.

185
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:16,041
[laughs nervously] Ya got me.

186
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,458
Of course.

187
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,166
It's not dangerous, is it?

188
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,083
[GOKU] It'll be a piece
a cake for those two.

189
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,166
You have my word!

190
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,916
[VEGETA]
Tch! Whatever that's worth.

191
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,291
[GOKU laughs]

00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,666
[sighs]

193
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,125
--[GOKU] Hey, Krillin.
--[KRILLIN] Uh. What's that?

194
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,916
I hate to spring this
on you last minute,

195
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,583
but do you mind taking
Trunks and Goten

196
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:32,916
down to 17's island?

197
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,875
I could really use
the help here, man.

198
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,291
[KRILLIN]
Uh...?

199
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,708
[GOKU]
Baba's bringing back Frieza,

200
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:40,333
so I gotta be at her place
to deal with that.

201
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:44,541
Um... I don't think
17... likes me much.

202
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,041
[GOKU]
You have nothin' to worry about!

203
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,708
He's not a bad guy anymore!

204
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:51,458
Look, if it'll make ya feel
better you can take 18.

205
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,291
[KRILLIN grumbles]

206
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:54,791
[KRILLIN]
Well...

207
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,625
18 is a completely different
person than she used to be.

208
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:01,958
And if she can change,
I suppose her brother can, too.

209
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,125
[KRILLIN]
Fine. I'll take 'em.

210
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,291
[GOKU]
I owe ya!

211
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,750
Which reminds me--
I owe Baba a gift, too!

212
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,000
Bulma, ya got anything
nice I can give her?

213
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,833
[BULMA]
That greedy old bat.

214
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:14,750
Come on, I'll find something.

215
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,541
[GOKU]
Ah. Thank you!

216
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:27,583
[ROSHI grunting]

217
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:36,333
[yells]

218
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:40,666
[ROSHI]
Lightning... Flash...

219
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,458
...Surprise Attack!

220

[screaming]

222
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:01,291
[ROSHI] Considering the
tournament's ring-out rule,

223
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,291
immobilizing techniques
like this

224
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:06,625
or the Evil Containment Wave
should really come in handy.

225
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,583
[KORIN]
All right, that's enough!

226
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,000
[YAJIROBE groans]

227
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,000
[ROSHI]
Sorry, Yajirobe.

228
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,125
I might've put a little
too much "oomph" into that.

229
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,458
You geezer! That hurt!

230
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,625
Isn't it about time
for you to go?

231
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:20,875
Right.

232
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,750
So tell me, Roshi.

233
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:29,791
Why'd you want to do your last
bit of training in my tower?

234
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:35,291
[ROSHI] I suppose it's
just for old time's sake.

235
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,875
A way to reconnect with my
youth and all those days

236
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:41,250
I spent here learning
from you, Master Korin.

237
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,250
I was a sponge,
soaking up every bit

238
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,958
of martial arts
knowledge I could.

239
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:49,500
But then, you knew that's why
I came back, didn't you?

240
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,041
Oh, I did.

241
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,333
I just wanted to hear the words
come out of your own mouth.

242
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:56,083
Now go out there and fight
as hard as you possibly can.

243
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:59,666
And if you lose, you'll have to
come back and answer to me!

244
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,333
All right. I'll be off then.

245

[ROSHI]
Wait.

246
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,250
Come to think of it, I actually
don't know how to fly.

247
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,625
--[KORIN] Wha--?!
--[YAJIROBE] Huh?!

248
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:13,750
[ROSHI laughs]

249
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:21,916
[ROH] Hm... This Frieza
is something else.

250
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,291
From what we're seeing on
GodTube, he's as cold and cruel

251
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,750
as any villain from
across the multiverse.

252
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:31,375
He'll wipe out an entire planet
without batting an eye!

253
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,208
[SIDRA] Then what of
this grand proposal?

254
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,375
What do you think, Roh?

255
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,458
Would you like to
debate its merits?

256
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,416
Sidra, there's
no need to debate.

257
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,666
We will enact this
plan immediately!

258
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,166
And eliminate
the villain Frieza!

259
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,791
[SIDRA]
I'm glad we agree!

260
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:47,375
[ROH]
Indeed! Now enough back-patting.

261
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,083
Let's find some assassins and
get them over to the Seventh!

262
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:53,250
We'll win this tournament
before it even begins!

00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:06,666
[GOKU laughs]
Here's the gift I promised.

264

So... You like it?
It's from Bulma's.

Oh, it's a re-gift.

Well, maybe there's
a receipt in the box.

Stay here, I'll be right back.

00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:18,291
[GOKU]
Great! Make it fast, please!

269
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,541
[GOKU]
I wonder how things are going

270
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:25,208
for Krillin and
the boys on the island?

271
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,750
Long time no see.

00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,125
Of all the people,
I didn't expect you to come.

At least try to pretend that
you're happy to see me.

I did try.

275
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,041
[KRILLIN]
Okay...

00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,500
Ha, ha! What a nice reunion!
You look well!

Ha, ha! C'mon!

Let's go take a tour
around the island!

Yeah!

So, uh. Yeah.
You uh, look good.

Ah. Right.

Ha, ha, ha! This island's great.

You have to live here
when you work, right?

00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,541
You should come to our place
for dinner sometime!

That's cool, dude.

Yes.

like all animals but humans!

00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,375
This island is even
bigger than I thought!

313
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:12,250
You sure they can handle
this job while I'm gone?

314
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,958
Yeah. You're in good hands.

315
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:18,750
Don't forget 17, they're
the sons of Goku and Vegeta!

316
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:21,041
Hm. A fair point.

317
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,458
So it's not the island's health
I should worry about

318
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,791
while I'm gone,
but that of the poachers.

319
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:28,625
[KRILLIN] Yeah. I told the
boys if they encounter any

320
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:31,750
they're not allowed
to hit 'em too hard.

321
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,041

How thoughtful of you.

this place while we're gone.

[TRUNKS, GOTEN]
You bet!

326
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,791
I'll stay to watch
the island, too!

327
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,083
You what?

328
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,791
Don't you want to go
and stay with Aunt Bulma?

329
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:44,708
Nope!

330
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,500
She wants to be
a guard like us!

331
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:47,666
That's right!

332
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,958
She'll be fine.
If you give her the space,

333
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:52,125
you'll learn Marron's a lot
tougher than you think.

Yeah, but 18...

Honey, we should only be gone
for a couple of hours.

at work, Mom and Dad!

It's our big break!

00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,083
That meddling ranger
is going on vacation

344
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:23,041
and trusting the island
to three useless children!

345
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:26,291
But, Boss. We just saw
them literally flying!

346
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:30,083
I think it's safe to say
they're not normal kids.

[GOHAN]
Everyone.

I know some here haven't
always been allies.

349
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:45,875
But to win this Tournament,
we'll have to fight as a team!

350
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,166
So let's rally,
and do this thing!

351
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,291
[VEGETA] Would you give up
on this teamwork garbage.

352
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:53,208
I'd rather crush the other
universes by myself!

[BULMA]
Oh, please.

I hope you've spent these years
getting stronger, Android.

the same thing.

when it should be a crown.

as quickly as possible.

All I ask is that you join me
in disposing of this threat!

470
00:23:08,916 --> 00:23:11,250
It's been too long since
I've stretched my legs.

471
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:14,750
Allow me to savor this
return to glorious combat!

00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:16,875
[GOKU] Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super,

00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:20,291
"Most Heinous! Most Evil!
Frieza's Wild Rampage!"

474
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:22,125
Make sure you
don't miss it, okay?
