<i>Where would I run off to? Oh!</i>

325
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:28,250
<i>Hello Hello Hello</i>

326
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:32,958
<i>How am I lookin' now that</i>
<i>I've grown into an adult? Oh!</i>

327
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:37,166
<i>Hello Hello Hello</i>

328
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:41,333
<i>Do I look like I'm proud</i>
<i>of who I've finally become?</i>

329
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:45,625
<i>Oh, I know I've made mistakes</i>
<i>But I'm tryin' to get it right</i>

330
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:50,375
<i>And I'm willing just to wait</i>
<i>For the moment I can shine</i>

331
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:55,625
<i>This anthem</i>
<i>Is a story for all time!</i>

[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

333
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,666
And I keep thinking
I've got Beerus figured out,

334
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,208
but then he just shows me
an even crazier move!

335
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:08,916
What kind of technique is that?

336
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,541
He's got the
whole Earth shaking,

337
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:12,791
and apparently
he's still holding back!

338
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:14,458
But I don't care
how strong he is,

339
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:17,125
there's no way
I'm gonna lose!

340
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:19,416
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

341
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,291
"Goku,
Surpass Super Saiyan God!"

342
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:24,666
You'd have to be nuts
to miss that!
