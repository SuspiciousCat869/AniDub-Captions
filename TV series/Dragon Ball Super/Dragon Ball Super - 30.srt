1
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,740
Don't you wanna dream again?

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,920
Now it's calling for me go back to the start

3
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,910
Wishing on the starlight

4
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,770
In the sky, let's paint a door for tomorrow

5
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,550
Just step on the new stage don't be shy

6
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,510
Gonna take the challenge of God

7
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,680
Kyo-Let's☆Mo-Let's☆Dynamic!

8
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,240
Let's! Go! Go! Big panic

9
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:50,990
I don't care 'bout limits, no regret

10
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:56,540
Make me tougher even though I lose

11
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,440
Nothing gonna stop me no mo' try me

12
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,750
So-Zets☆Cho-Zets☆Dynamic!

13
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,400
Let's Go! Yes! Give a kick!

14
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:10,780
Keep on going power pumpin' up

15
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:14,740
something greater waiting not so far away

16
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,370
I'd rather spend
the time we have training.

17
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,380
But we've gotta choose our last
two team members, too.

18
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,550
It's tricky.
We don't know who we'll fight

19
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,380
or what the conditions will be.

20
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,320
How are we supposed
to know who to pick?

21
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,690
Yeah, you got me.

22
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,320
[KRILLIN] Does this airspace
have room for one more?

23
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,320
Oh, hey, Krillin!

24
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,470
[KRILLIN]
Thanks for the invite.

25
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,370
I'm not sure how
a space picnic works,

26
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,870
but I'm ready to find out!

27
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:03,140
What the hell are you
talking about? What picnic?

28
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,910
Whoa! Don't take it out
on me, man!

29
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,210
All I know is what
Chichi told 18!

30
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,710
[KRILLIN imitating Chichi]
Lord Beerus invited Goku to

31
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,450
a picnic in outer space, so I'm
thinking we should all go

32
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,580
since Goku never
takes me anywhere!

33
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,820
[KRILLIN imitating A18]
Oh. A space picnic sounds fun.

34
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,160
[KRILLIN imitating Marron]
Yay! Space picnic!

35
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,690
[KRILLIN imitating A18]
That's what she said

36
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,590
and it's not every day
we're offered a space trip.

37
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,400
Come on. You've earned
some vacation time, right?

38
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,400
I'm a good father and husband.

39
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,170
So, I came to find you
'cause I'm not sure

40
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,730
where we're going to launch.

41
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,900
[VEGETA] Disgraceful.
You made that whole thing up

42
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,670
as a cover story, didn't you?

43
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,570
Uh... kinda.

44
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,410
So, there's not
a space picnic?

45
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,880
Sorry, no. There's
a space something though.

46
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,850
Can you tell him? You'll
explain it better than I will.

47
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,450
[KRILLIN]
Huh?

48
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,220
[grunts]

49
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,520
--Thanks, buddy!
--Tch!

50
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,190
[NARRATOR] After defeating
the resurrected Frieza,

51
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:56,290
Goku and Vegeta resumed
their intensive training

52
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,200
on Lord Beerus' world.

53
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,970
But it wasn't long before
another powerful deity

54
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,700
arrived to shake things up.

55
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,200
The divine being
was Lord Champa,

56
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,970
the fearsome Destroyer
of the Sixth Universe

57
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,380
and the twin brother
of Lord Beerus himself.

58
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:13,610
Yeah, I couldn't believe it.

59
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,910
And the guy looks
just like Beerus, too!

60
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,720
Except he weighs
about twice as much

61
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,550
and has a thing
for funny drinks.

62
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,250
But don't let that fool you.
He's still a fighting machine

63
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,660
and definitely deserves
that Destroyer title.

64
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,590
When he started fighting Beerus,
the whole world was shaking!

65
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:31,060
[BOTH]
That's enough!

66
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,060
[GOKU] Whis said if they
hadn't stopped when they did,

67
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,670
the universe would've
been ripped apart!

68
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,900
You're kidding me!

69
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,500
--[KRILLIN]That's nuts!
--I know!

70
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,810
Kakarot, I thought
you wanted me to explain it!

71
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,810
Right. Sorry, got carried away!

72
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,640
Wait a minute. What was that
about the "Sixth Universe"?

73
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,280
That's what I was
trying to get to.

74
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,950
[NARRATOR] There are not one,
but twelve universes,

75
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,120
which exist
in intricate balance.

76
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,590
Each pair of universes whose
numbers add up to thirteen,

77
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,260
such as the First Universe
and the Twelfth,

78
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:03,130
or the Second and the Eleventh,
are counterparts to each other.

79
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,860
Parallel realities that share
a great deal in common.

80
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,700
That was the part that
confused me; I kinda got lost.

81
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:10,970
[VEGETA grunts]

82
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,970
I mean twelve universes
that add up to thirteen?

83
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,310
And twos of something--
I know twos were a thing.

84
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,510
You're not helping.

85
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,280
Right, sorry.
You tell him. My mistake.

86
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,380
[NARRATOR] The Seventh
Universe, home to Beerus,

87
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,550
Goku and his friends,
is a counterpart

88
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,550
to the Sixth,
where Champa reigns.

89
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,650
And like Champa and Beerus,
the Sixth and Seventh Universes

90
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,020
have a twin-like relationship:
they may have begun identical,

91
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,060
but have developed
differences over time.

92
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:36,390
And their sibling Destroyers
often squabble

93
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,530
over whose reality
produces the better food.

94
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,130
Delicious!

95
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,670
Now admit it.
Food from the Sixth Universe

96
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,340
makes whatever slop
you offer here

97
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,910
taste like hot, sweaty garbage.

98
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,570
[NARRATOR]
On this most recent visit,

99
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,680
Champa believed he had claimed
his culinary victory,

100
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,180
but Beerus had a secret weapon.

101
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,250
What kind of witchcraft is this?

102
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,180
It's instant ramen.

103
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,390
I've never heard of that dish.
Where did you get this from?

104
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,020
[BEERUS] A curious planet
called "Earth."

105
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,030
A weird name.

106
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,730
[NARRATOR]
Champa's attendant, Vados,

107
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,000
who is also Whis' older sister,

108
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,700
searched for planet Earth
in the Sixth Universe,

109
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,530
but the human race
in that reality

110
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,440
had already been destroyed
through foolish conflict.

111
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:23,340
And no more civilization
meant no more gourmet food.

112
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,240
[KRILLIN] Wow. That's a weird
way to frame a tragedy.

113
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,080
I know. Their version
of the earth

114
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,250
looks like a dried up,
empty rock.

115
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,620
[CHAMPA chuckles]

116
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,420
Say, Beerus!
Let's have a contest!

117
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,390
[NARRATOR] And just like that,
Champa threw down the gauntlet,

118
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,120
challenging Beerus
to a fighting competition.

119
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,930
If Champa wins,
the Sixth and Seventh Universes

120
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,900
will exchange
their planet Earths.

121
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:47,470
And if Beerus wins,
Champa will give his brother

122
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,270
another interesting prize:

123
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,940
six powerful wish orbs
he has collected.

124
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,570
[KRILLIN]
Wait, wish orbs?

125
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,810
[NARRATOR] Like Dragon Balls,
these orbs grant wishes

126
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,640
when all seven
are brought together.

127
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,380
But these are
the size of planets,

128
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,980
and possess power on
a completely different scale.

129
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,880
These so-called Super Dragon
Balls have no limits

130
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,880
to the type of wishes
they can grant.

131
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,590
Champa has collected six--

132
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,720
a fact which made
Beerus skeptical.

133
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,060
What was the use of
six Super Dragon Balls

134
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,560
without the seventh?

135
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,500
Can we? Can we compete?
Pretty please?

136
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,900
Really? You want to be
a part of all this?

137
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,570
Yeah, are you kidding me?

138
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,770
Fighting the strongest guys from
a whole other other universes?

139
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,770
This is what I live for!

140
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,610
[NARRATOR] The concerns of
Beerus and Vegeta were no match

141
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,440
for Goku's gung-ho passion for
this latest, greatest challenge.

142
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,810
[GOKU] Aw, come on,
they were excited, too!

143
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,820
[NARRATOR]
Yes, they were excited, too.

144
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,620
Thanks mostly
to Goku stirring them up.

145
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,790
And that's the story
I'm sticking to.

146
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,660
All right then.
I could use a good battle!

147
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:50,030
Ah! Hell yeah!

148
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,630
[NARRATOR] The Destroyers
agreed on a five-man-team

149
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:56,170
elimination format, meaning a
series of one-on-one battles.

150
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,140
The loser of each match
would be out,

151
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:00,440
and the winner would advance
to fight the next member

152
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:03,370
of the opposing team. The first
side to reach and defeat

153
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,010
the opposing team's captain
would win it all.

154
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,680
And as for
the rules of combat...

155
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,380
[GOKU] Ooh, I know the rules!
They're the same as

156
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,650
the World Martial Arts
Tournament! My idea.

157
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,380
[NARRATOR]
Hey, I'm the narrator.

158
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,850
[GOKU]
You lose if you surrender

159
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,320
or fall outside the ring!

160
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,490
You can't use weapons,
and you can't make yourself

161
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,190
stronger by cheating, either.

162
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,330
[NARRATOR]
Are you finished?

163
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,990
[GOKU]
Yeah. Sorry.

164
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,230
[NARRATOR] There was
one other catch to qualify.

165
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,530
And there should be
a written test

166
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:27,900
for anyone who wants to enter.

167
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:30,400
We don't need some mindless
monster on either side.

168
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,900
You need a brain big enough
to understand the rules.

169
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,670
[NARRATOR] If anyone's
still listening to me,

170
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,810
the contest would be
held in five days

171
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,340
on the "Planet With No Name:"

172
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,540
a world floating
in neutral space between

173
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,380
the Sixth and Seventh Universes.

174
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,150
[GOKU]
Are you okay, Mr. Narrator?

175
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,020
You seem annoyed
for some reason.

176
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,520
[NARRATOR] Unbelievable.
Anyway, back on Earth--

177
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,320
[GOKU] Great,
thanks for explaining, man!

178
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,590
We'll take it from here!

179
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,220
[NARRATOR]
Okay, I quit!

180
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,660
A tournament?

181
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,900
But wait, if you guys
need five on your team,

182
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,260
who's the other three?

183
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,830
According to Beerus,
the fifth slot's been filled.

184
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,270
Whoa, hold on.
Who's this Monaka guy?

185
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,540
If you must know,
Monaka just happens to be

186
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:09,070
the strongest opponent
I've ever gone up against.

187
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,510
So, this guy's even
stronger than you, Goku?

188
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,410
Yeah, I guess so. That's
what Beerus said, at least.

189
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,210
After doing all
that training with Whis

190
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,020
I was feeling pretty good
about where I was at.

191
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,420
But the universe
is a huge place.

192
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,020
Okay. That makes three,
what about the other two?

193
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,420
Well, naturally we want
to have Majin Buu on board.

194
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,690
I know he's supposed
to be the good part of Buu,

195
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,760
but are we sure
we can trust him?

196
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:36,070
[GOKU, VEGETA gasp]

197
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,600
Now, Buu extra mad!

198
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,040
[VEGETA] Besides, Beerus took
him out with one blow, remember?

199
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,110
I'm not saying
he could beat a Destroyer,

200
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,780
but he's still crazy strong.

201
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:47,810
[KRILLIN]
Can't argue that.

202
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,150
All right, fine.

203
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,750
Oh yeah,
I forgot to tell you.

204
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,950
The evil side of Buu;
he's been reincarnated.

205
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,790
Now he's a good human kid!
Can you believe that?

206
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,060
King Yemma told me--
isn't that awesome?

207
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,990
Huh! I find it hard
to believe that oversized ogre

208
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,760
just decided
to bring that punk back

209
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,730
without someone
begging him to do it.

210
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:08,930
--[chuckles]
--Well, at any rate,

211
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,340
if he's a baby
he can't help us now.

212
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,840
Well, yeah. I know that.
So how 'bout Piccolo?

213
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:17,440
Why not Gohan?
Certainly, you realize your son

214
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,010
has the most latent ability
of all the fighters we know.

215
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,980
Yeah, of course.
But we need someone

216
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,280
who can fight right now.

217
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,450
And Gohan's way too rusty
to help us.

218
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,750
[VEGETA]
Hmmm. Well, that's a shame.

219
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,850
[GOKU]
You got that right.

220
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,820
So? How 'bout it, Buu?
Can we count on ya?

221
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,990
[BUU]
Mmmm. No! Buu no like cat!

222
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,960
Don't do it for Beerus,
do it for us! Please?

223
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,500
[BUU grunts]

224
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,800
Not happening.

225
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,240
[GOKU]
Huh?

226
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,310
All right, Buu,
what if we let you have

227
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,540
one of the wishes?
Would you say yes then?

228
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:51,780
Wait, really?

229
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,680
Yeah! I mean,
the Dragon Balls on Earth

230
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,450
and New Namek
grant more than one wish.

231
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,180
And if these Super Dragon
Balls are supposed to be

232
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,850
way more powerful,
then I'm sure we'll have

233
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,780
plenty of wishes to go around.

234
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,820
Come on Buu, doesn't your own
"super wish" sound awesome?

235
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,160
They're supposed to grant you
anything without any limits--

236
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,330
just imagine
all the possibilities!

237
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,660
Easy, pal.

238
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,630
Are you sure you can
make that call on your own?

239
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,230
Beerus will wring your neck.

240
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,200
He'll come around, hopefully.

241
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:17,500
Well, Buu? What does Buu say?

242
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,700
You give Buu any wish Buu want?

243
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,210
[GOKU]
Mhmmm!

244
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,380
Okay then! Buu will join you!

245
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,880
[GOKU]
That's the spirit!

246
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,180
--[MR. SATAN gasps]
--[glass breaking]

247
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:33,850
Wait, Buu. We need to talk!

248
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:35,420
What's the matter, Mr. Satan?

249
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,520
You're not gonna wish for
anything bad, are ya?

250
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,060
You know, like,
turning the galaxy into

251
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,390
--chocolate or something?
--You no worry.

252
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,990
Buu no make a wish!

253
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,330
Buu gets everything
Buu wants from you!

254
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,130
Buu going to
fight hard and get wish

255
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,870
so that Buu can
give it to Mr. Satan!

256
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,370
Are you serious?
You'd really do that for me?

257
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:55,540
You're the best, Buu!
[sobbing]

258
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,840
What did I do to deserve
such an amazing friend?

259
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,310
See! It all
worked out just fine.

260
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,380
Okay.

261
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,950
Great.
Our next stop... is Piccolo!

262
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:18,480
Come on, come on. Almost there.

263
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:23,460
[purrs]

264
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:24,820
Yes, finally!

265
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,890
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

266
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,030
Oooh....

267
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,330
[sniffs]

268
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:33,970
I love that smell! Bottoms up!

269
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,900
[WHIS]
Not so fast, my lord.

270
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,440
You haven't
given your thanks yet,

271
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,240
and I thought
I'd taught you better.

272
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:42,040
I was getting to that.
Thanks for the meal. Ya happy?

273
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,010
--[WHIS] Hmph!
--Come to papa!

274
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,180
I still can't get over how
delicious these noodles are!

275
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,020
Every now and then I get
a craving for them

276
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:57,260
that's too strong to resist!
[slurps]

277
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:00,490
Every now and then? Is that so?

278
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,360
[BEERUS slurps]

279
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,070
I must say, my lord,
this change has been dramatic.

280
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,500
[BEERUS]
Hm?

281
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,170
Goku's enthusiasm never
would've swayed you in the past.

282
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,910
I'm surprised you agreed
to a tournament

283
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,010
from which you have
so very little to gain.

284
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,380
That's not true!

285
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,780
I gain entertainment--
you should try it sometime.

286
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:21,750
Well, don't forget,
there's the do-over, too.

287
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:25,050
You failed to protect Earth
because of your leniency.

288
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,690
The only way
to avoid this outcome

289
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,060
is to send Frieza
back to his garden.

290
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:33,690
As you admitted, it's unlike you
to allow a world to be saved.

291
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,430
[BEERUS] Well, you're the one
who suggested it.

292
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,560
It makes me wonder.
When you had that premonition,

293
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,340
did you see more of this coming
than I gave you credit for?

294
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,740
[BEERUS] The ultimate fighter,
waiting to be awoken.

295
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:54,580
His power will keep me
suitably entertained.

296
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,480
A Super Saiyan God.

297
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,750
[WHIS] I was skeptical we'd
find what you were seeking,

298
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,990
especially when
we first met Goku.

299
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,420
And it seemed
you were doubtful, too.

300
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,630
Right, sorry.

301
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,160
Hello and good morning,
Your Greats.

302
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:13,130
I'm Go--I mean,
my name is Goku, sir!

303
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:17,100
It is an honor
for you to meet me! Sir!

304
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,610
[BEERUS] If you're suggesting
I knew then what would happen,

305
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,310
it certainly wasn't conscious.

306
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,140
The Saiyan was amusing
but clearly not on my level.

307
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,780
His challenge annoyed me.

308
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:28,410
Nothing big. We could go
toe-to-toe in a sparring match,

309
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,080
even if only for a minute!

310
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,320
I've lived hundreds
of millions of years.

311
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,450
Yet never in my existence
have I been issued

312
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:37,190
a challenge such as yours, Goku.

313
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,460
[WHIS] Yes, at that point
Goku was all enthusiasm,

314
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,800
and offered nothing close
to a true competition.

315
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,930
[GOKU groans]

316
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,810
[WHIS] But then, with the aid
of the other Saiyans,

317
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,710
he transformed into
this Super Saiyan God

318
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,050
whose name you had
plucked from a dream.

319
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,110
And the upgrade was astonishing,

320
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:04,520
even if his power fell short,
compared to you.

321
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,120
[BEERUS grunts]

322
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:16,060
[GOKU]
Ha!

323
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,200
[BEERUS]
My mistake.

324
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,470
[GOKU groans]

325
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,830
[BEERUS] I seem to have
the wrong person.

326
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:26,640
You're clearly not the rival
I was looking for.

327
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,680
[WHIS] And yet he
and his power kept rising,

328
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:33,050
creeping closer
and closer to relevance.

329
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,210
[GOKU gasps]

330
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,380
Even though the Super
Saiyan God power expired,

331
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,650
your body has learned
from the experience

332
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,360
of fighting in god form.

333
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,420
The god power
is part of you now.

334
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:47,160
The red glow of Saiyan divinity
may have left you,

335
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,900
but the strength now burns
within you like a flame.

336
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,400
Am I wrong?

337
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,200
Well, honestly, I don't know.

338
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,900
And, it doesn't matter, right?

339
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,370
All that matters is that
I can still win this thing.

340
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:00,570
I should be careful,

341
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,440
or your battle-obsessed
simplemindedness

342
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:05,180
could rub off on me.
[chuckles]

343
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:09,180
Although, seeing how I've
acted, maybe it already has.

344
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,450
[WHIS] The Saiyan
is remarkably stubborn.

345
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,450
He refuses to quit
or shrink from a challenge.

346
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,460
And when he's fighting,
he romps around like a child.

347
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,690
The two of you
are peas in a pod.

348
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,230
You wanted fun
and now he's helped

349
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:24,430
lead you into a tournament.
Curious, don't you think?

350
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,300
Aaah!

351
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:27,770
I've asked you before, Whis,

352
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,770
don't lump me in
with that barbarian.

353
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,900
I have enough class
to show proper respect,

354
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,610
instead of letting
raw impulses control me.

355
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,040
[WHIS] Like when you're
destroying worlds on a whim?

356
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,810
[BEERUS] If you want to talk
motives and foresight, Whis,

357
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,750
I've got a question for you.

358
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,250
Go on.

359
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,750
[BEERUS] What were you really
thinking when you decided

360
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,490
to bring those Saiyans here
and train them?

361
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,920
[WHIS]
Uh.

362
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,920
You didn't just bring Vegeta
here because he asked you;

363
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,590
you wanted it that way.

364
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,630
Then once he was strong enough,
you returned to Earth

365
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,430
knowing Goku would be waiting.

366
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,260
I want to become
as powerful as Lord Beerus.

367
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,730
It's all I can think about!

368
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,830
I beg you;
I'll do whatever it takes!

369
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,170
Please be my teacher!

370
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,000
I don't see why not.

371
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:06,270
Wow, you mean it?

372
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,070
Of course.
I have been thinking this was

373
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,110
about the right time
to do it, anyway.

374
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,680
Hold on, what was that?

375
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,080
[BEERUS]
So, what's the end game?

376
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,080
You're not building
them up to have them fight me,

377
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,020
are you? Is that
what this is all about?

378
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,750
No, my lord. You'll just
have to keep on guessing.

379
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:23,520
Really? Well, no matter.

380
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:26,430
Even if I'm right
it would still be amusing.

381
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,530
Okay, I've had
enough ramen for now.

382
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,360
I think it's time
we fetch Monaka.

383
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,600
Hey, Dad, wait up!

384
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,100
[GOKU]
Oh, hi, Goten!

385
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,300
[VEGETA]
Now what?

386
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,110
[TRUNKS] Dad! Mom says
you're fighting guys

387
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,340
from another universe!
Is that true?

388
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,040
--That's right.
--Sweet!

389
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,610
--So, there's no space picnic?
--[chuckles]

390
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,350
You're gonna let us
compete too, right?

391
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,350
I don't care what world
they come from!

392
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,850
We'll kick their alien butts!

393
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,020
No way.

394
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,450
Why not?

395
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,520
The only way you'd be
strong enough is with Fusion,

396
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,460
and that qualifies as cheating.

397
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,160
If you really want to be useful,

398
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:01,160
it's time you learn
to fight on your own.

399
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,130
Uuh! Awe...

400
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,330
You're being
kinda harsh with him,

401
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:06,230
don't you think, Vegeta?
They're still kids!

402
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,970
Unlike you,
I tell my son the truth.

403
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,570
[grunts]

404
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,210
[KRILLIN] So much
for mellowing with age.

405
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,340
[TRUNKS]
Man.

406
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:43,400
[GOHAN, PICCOLO panting]

407
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,370
Piccolo!

408
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:51,840
It's Dad!

409
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,450
[PICCOLO] A tournament
with the Sixth Universe?

410
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,850
That's right. And we want you
to be our fifth fighter.

411
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,420
But, Dad. Are you sure
you don't want me?

412
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,850
[GOKU]
Uh!

413
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,590
I don't know what to say here.

414
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:05,960
It's okay, I get it.

415
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,560
But I'm training
with Piccolo again

416
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,400
so I can get back
into fighting shape.

417
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,730
Oh, I had no idea!

418
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,800
So, that's why
you're all bruised up.

419
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,870
[GOHAN]
Frieza really opened my eyes.

420
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,400
I have a family now
I need to protect.

421
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,970
I never want to feel like
I've failed 'em again.

422
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,710
I've got to get stronger
so the next time

423
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,910
there's a threat I'll be ready.
This'll help with that.

424
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,980
Please, Dad,
can I join your team?

425
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,610
Got my vote.

426
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,890
[chuckles]
All right, son.

427
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,920
You want the spot? It's yours.

428
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,260
Thanks, Dad.

429
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,590
Yeah, of course! Whis will
pick us up in four days,

430
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,090
so make sure you're ready.

431
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:44,630
[GOHAN]
Four days? Mmm. That's it?

432
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,200
[GOKU]
Uh...

433
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,100
What am I
supposed to do here?

434
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,040
What's the right thing
for my family?

435
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,240
I haven't even
checked with Videl.

436
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,840
I'd have to leave Pan.

437
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,580
And there's that academic
conference, too.

438
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,920
But I also need
to get stronger. I do.

439
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,150
But still, four days?

440
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:07,090
Sorry, it's just
not gonna work.

441
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,420
There's too much going on.

442
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,160
I've got this conference
and if I don't show

443
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,190
I could lose my job,
plus Pan's a lot of work.

444
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,860
I mean, you understand, right?

445
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,360
[GOKU chuckles]
Of course, son.

446
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,930
It's fine;
don't worry about it.

447
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,430
You just leave
the matches to us.

448
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,640
Your work's important, too.

449
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:25,670
I'm really sorry.
Next time, though.

450
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,780
Fine.

451
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,380
This'll be awesome!

452
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,980
Then it's settled.
We have our team.

453
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,220
It would be nice
if I could get

454
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,950
a little more
information, though.

455
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,190
Oh yeah, sure!

456
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,150
[BULMA]
Where the hell is he?

457
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,790
Super Elite my ass!

458
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:45,960
That patrol clown can't
keep a damn appointment!

459
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,560
[grunts]

460
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:51,160
So, no Jaco, huh?
Should we go train some more?

461
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,500
[laughs]

462
00:19:53,530 --> 00:20:00,010
[PICCOLO] So, this is it, huh?
Bulma's Super Dragon Radar?

463
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,810
Can you guess
what I'm thinking?

464
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,310
Prob'ly. You want to use

465
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,980
the Hypberbolic
Time Chamber, don't you?

466
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:10,520
Heh-heh! That's right. I heard
Dende's getting it all fixed up.

467
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:13,420
Indeed, he is.
He should be done tomorrow.

468
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:15,820
[GOKU] How 'bout it, Piccolo?
You want to go with me?

469
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,760
No thanks, I'm good.

470
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:20,730
I've learned the folly of trying
to keep up with a Saiyan.

471
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,730
I'll be better off
spending the time alone,

472
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,600
getting focused for battle.

473
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,600
How 'bout you, pal?
You're coming, right?

474
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,600
[VEGETA] Not if I have
to be stuck with you.

475
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,840
Aw, come on.
You don't really mean that!

476
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,440
We'll have three more days left.

477
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,910
So, if we use the Chamber
that's three years of training!

478
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,840
You don't want me to leave you
in the dust, do ya?

479
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,580
Three years? You'd really
stay in that long?

480
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,750
What's the point in that?
As far as I can tell,

481
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,720
we're nearly at the limit
of our strength.

482
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,750
Doesn't matter
how long we train,

483
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,690
we'll still only gain a little.

484
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,420
That's no reason to stop.
Even if it is only a little,

485
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,260
I'll still take
everything I can get!

486
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:55,930
Beerus said Monaka's stronger
but he didn't say how much,

487
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,200
and we can't bridge
the gap if we don't try.

488
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,770
But, hey I can't force ya.

489
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:04,470
I'll train alone if you want and
get stronger all by myself!

490
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,370
Hm?

491
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:08,540
Three more years.

492
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,280
Oh, what the hell.
I'll go with you.

493
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,540
[GOKU]
All right!

494
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,110
--[sighs]
--He can't bear to fall behind.

495
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,720
You know that, Goku.

496
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:20,150
This'll be great! We can spend
every second sparring together!

497
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,450
[VEGETA]
Tch!

498
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:24,320
[WHIS] All right, my lord.
We're almost there.

499
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:27,130
Old Monaka.
It's been a long time.

500
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,230
Are you sure
this recruitment is wise?

501
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,400
Because I have to admit
I have my doubts.

502
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:35,130
We'll be all right.
Let me do the talking.

503
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,310
Goodbye to our adventure

504
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,820
In twilight we must go our separate ways

505
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:57,350
And try to discover the path to our own destiny

506
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,600
I can't find the words

507
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,130
to tell you how much our parting hurts

508
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,630
I hope you know I'll always love you

509
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:07,580
And all that we shared will be remembered

510
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,890
How could I forget your face?

511
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,790
All my memories erased

512
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,870
I can still hear the melody of your voice

513
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,430
Petals fall in from above

514
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,070
Fade away, all that we love

515
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:28,580
In the twilight,

516
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:28,580
fade away,

517
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,580
fade away

518
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:34,990
Sayonara,

519
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,990
fade away,

520
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,990
fade away

521
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,040
Hey, it's me, Goku!

522
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:44,250
And that goof-off patrolman's back to help
Bulma on a special mission into outer space!

523
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:48,510
And you'll get a chance to see Bulma back when
she could barely lift her first power drill!

524
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:51,590
Word is, there's this amazing alien who knows everything

525
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:53,510
and Jaco and Bulma're gonna see him!

526
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:56,470
But they better be careful
on that alien world!

527
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,850
Next time on Dragon Ball Super:

528
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,530
Make sure you don't miss it, okay?
