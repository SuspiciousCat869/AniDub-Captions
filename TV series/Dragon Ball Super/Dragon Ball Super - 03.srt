[NARRATOR] Previously,
on Dragon Ball Super,

3
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:55,166
a dangerous being named Beerus

4
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,708
awoke after a
thirty-nine year of slumber,

5
00:01:57,791 --> 00:01:59,500
and struggled
to remember his dream

6
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:02,958
about a warrior known as
a Super Saiyan God.

7
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:06,208
Meanwhile, Earth welcomed
a new era of peace,

8
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:08,333
and with Bulma's birthday
around the corner,

9
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:10,541
plans for a huge party began.

10
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:13,125
But it wasn't all
fun and games for Goku,

11
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:14,875
who traveled
to King Kai's planet

12
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:17,250
to train under
its powerful gravity.

13
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,583
The incredibly strong
Saiyan hopes to reach

14
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:22,375
an even higher level. Now!

[NARRATOR]
"Where Does the Dream Pick Up?!

16
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:29,458
Find the Super Saiyan God!"

17
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:39,375
[BEERUS]
Hmm. I've forgotten again.

18
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:42,208
Was it... a Super Seer God,

19
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:44,750
or a Superior Sorrow-Man God?

20
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:47,125
Wait, Supreme Soy-yan God,

21
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,791
that feels closer
to right, I think.

22
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,375
Well it sounds
like a grandiose,

23
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,500
over-the-top name,
in any case.

24
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,666
You can just use your
power to find him for me,

25
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,041
can't you, Whis?

26
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,625
I have limits. I can't find
this needle of a warrior

27
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:00,208
in the haystack
of this universe

28
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,000
if you can't even
settle on his name.

29
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,458
You're no fun.

30
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:06,166
Mmm! All this racking
my brain is making me hungry

31
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,791
and now I want something sweet.

32
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:10,791
I told you, you can eat
as soon as we get home.

33
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:13,500
I do seem to remember
an exceptionally rare dessert

34
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:14,916
in the refrigerator.

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,750
[BEERUS]
Exceptionally rare?

36
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,000
Are you sure about that, Whis?

37
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:20,833
Because if you're wrong--

38
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:24,125
You can rest assured,
my lord. It is there.

39
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,833
[BEERUS] There's something else
I've been meaning to ask.

40
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,083
Oh?

41
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,041
[BEERUS] Is this really
the fastest you can go?

42
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:31,500
[WHIS]
Hmph.

43
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,458
I'll have you know
I'm the fastest being

44
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,416
in this whole universe,
Lord Beerus.

45
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,875
Really, is that right?

46
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,791
I suppose I should
be impressed, then.

47
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,250

Hmph!

[ELDER KAI gasps]

00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,750
What now, Ancestor?

50
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,958
It seems Beerus the Destroyer

51
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:59,583
has already claimed
another planet.

52
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,458
[KIBITO KAI] I've never
seen him this frightened.

53
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,083
Not even during
Majin Buu's rampage.

54
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:07,875
Is this latest awakening
of Beerus truly so ominous?

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,791
[ELDER KAI]
There are deities, like us,

56
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:14,416
who exist to create and
protect life in the universe.

57
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,458
But the opposite is also true.

58
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:19,583
Some deities exist
only to end life.

59
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:22,666
Beerus the Destroyer
is such a being.

60
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,250
Yes. I'm well aware of that.

61
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,541
But as detestable
as it is to us,

62
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,708
there is a reason
for his destructive ways.

63
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,416
[ELDER KAI] No!
[KIBITO KAI gasps]

64
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,791
There is no reason at all.

65
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,375
[ELDER KAI] The inevitability
of his existence

66
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,375
does not give meaning
to what he does.

67
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,958
Beerus acts only on
his own whims.

68
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,916
He is nothing but
bottled chaos,

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,375
and we must make sure that
no one shakes that bottle up.

70
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:47,958
The last thing
our universe needs

71
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,625
is for a battle-loving warrior
to challenge Lord Beerus

72
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,750
to a fight and whip him
into a destructive frenzy.

73
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,958
You say that as if you have
someone specific in mind.

74
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:59,000
[gasps]
You mean Goku!

75
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,583
Of course I do!

76
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,083
That punch-happy fool would try
to fight Beerus just for fun,

77
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,250
which is why we can't
let him know he exists!

78
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,791
Well that shouldn't
be too hard,

79
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,625
since Beerus' energy can only
be sensed by other deities.

80
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,250
And since Goku's
back on Earth,

81
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,791
he's practically
on the other side

82
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,375
of the universe from Beerus.

83
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:17,041
So there's almost zero chance of
them running into each other.

84
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,666
I certainly hope you're right.

When did that happen?

Well, North Kai, have you
been able to sense

Beerus' awakening
from your vantage point?

[KING KAI]
Yes, indeed.

97
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,833
Beerus really
rolled out of bed

a lot earlier than expected
this time, didn't he?

99
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,916
And you understand why
this has to remain a secret?

100
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,958
Absolutely, sir. Goku won't
hear one word about it--

off before it dries,

need deities! Or dragons!

Every time you Earth-dwellers
summon Shenron,

I stand up here
crossing my fingers!

I'm sorry! I just forgot!

that makes me feel better?

up here either way?

Does it really matter
if you're alive or dead?

Yes of course
it still matters,

You have no idea
how much the other Kais

overseer to keep myself alive!

158
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,500
The next time
you get to make a wish

159
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:57,083
you better bring us back, Goku.
Do you hear me?

160
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,166
Hey where'd you run off to?

161
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,000
Don't you know
it's rude to work out

162
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,250
when someone's trying
to yell at you?

163
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,625
Oh, it's pointless.

164
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,791
[KING KAI] But my real effort
wasn't pointless at all!

165
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,875
He's forgotten all about
the Beerus stuff.

166
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,916
Aah! Why am I still
holding this rag?

167
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,916
[WHIS]
Home at last, my lord.

168
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,750
[BEERUS]
Yes. It's about time.

169
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,250
[WHIS] Now that there's
food in your belly,

170
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:34,083
can you settle on the name
for that super-person

171
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,375
or whatever you wanna call it?

172
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,916
Oh I know,
I'll just ask the Seer!

173
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,041
You really want to
go to that Oracle Fish

174
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,208
about something like this?

175
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,541
That a problem?

176
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:47,791
[WHIS] It's your choice,
my lord. Do as you please.

177
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:51,625
Hello, Seer? Can you
hear me, are you there?

178
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,208
[grunts]

179
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,541
[BEERUS shrieks]

180
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:08,125
[SEER moans]

181
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,750
You summon me?

182
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,291
[grunts angrily]

183
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:14,291
[SEER]
Uuh.

184
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,375
Right before my last nap,

185
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,875
did you not prophesize
that in thirty-nine years

186
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,666
my archrival would appear?

187
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,000
[SEER] I did,
because he will! It's today!

188
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,375
There, you see, Whis?

189
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:30,375
Now be a good little oracle
and tell me his name.

190
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,833
I'm going to go track him down.

191
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,333
[SEER]
His name?

192
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:38,708
Huh... Hmmm...

193
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:40,666
Oops, I forgot!

194
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,291
My Seer forgot?

195
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,625
Hang in there, fishy,
this could get rough.

196
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,291
[BEERUS]
Remind me, Whis.

197
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:50,250
This Oracle Fish is fed
three times a day, correct?

198
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,916
That's right, my lord.

199
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,541
[BEERUS] From now on,
let's make that twice a day.

200
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:55,791
[SEER shrieks]
[WHIS] Great idea,

201
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,083
less work for me!

202
00:09:57,166 --> 00:10:00,083
No, please, not my food.
Anything but that!

203
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,500
Then start earning
your keep, Seer.

204
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:05,166
[SEER] Okay, okay!
Just, give me a second!

205
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,500
Let's see. Was it--?

206
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,916
[groans]

207
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,708
Oh! I got it!
A Super Saiyan God!

208
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:15,583
Excellent, so I was right.

209
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:18,000
And if he's called
a Super Saiyan God,

210
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:21,625
does that mean this warrior is
a full-fledged deity like me?

211
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,791
'Cause that really could
spell some trouble.

212
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,375
But I've checked, my lord.

213
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,250
There is currently
no being in existence

214
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,500
who goes by the name
Super Saiyan God.

215
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,083
I'm certain of it.

216
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:34,250
I imagine a Saiyan could tell
us about this God of theirs.

217
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,250
Whatever happened
to Planet Vegeta?

218
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:39,666
Wasn't that the Saiyans world?
Didn't Frieza blow it to bits?

219
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,500
Yes, he destroyed it
while you were sleeping,

220
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,375
which shouldn't come
as a surprise.

221
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,208
Considering you
told him to do so.

222
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:48,000
Well it's a good thing I did,
those guys were repulsive!

223
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:51,625
Especially that King Vegeta
fellow, such an arrogant brute.

224
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,166
So let me get
the facts straight,

225
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,000
it's always tricky after a nap.

226
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,166
Frieza successfully
destroyed the planet

227
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,208
and all of the Saiyans
with it, yes?

228
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:02,041
Not exactly. Most of
the Saiyans are no more,

229
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,958
but there was a handful
of survivors that were

230
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,000
off the planet when it exploded.

231
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:09,166
Incidentally, the king's son,
Prince Vegeta, was among them.

232
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,958
Well what a lucky guy.

233
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:14,583
What about my bath, Whis?
Is it ready?

234
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:17,625
[WHIS] You wish to
take a bath, at this hour?

235
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:20,000
Thirty-nine years is hardly
enough for a proper nap

236
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,041
and now I just feel groggy.

237
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,416
I need to clear out
the cobwebs.

238
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,916
And do you find
the water pleasing, my lord?

239
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,458
[BEERUS]
It's perfectly adequate.

240
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,083
[WHIS]
Glad to hear it.

241
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,958
Anyway. So what's
become of this

242
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,250
handful of Saiyan survivors?

243
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,083
[WHIS]
Hmmm.

244
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,166
For the most part,
they've resettled

245
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:50,083
in Sector 4-0-3-2 Green,
on Planet 8-7-7.

246
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,791
The indigenous life there
call it Planet Earth.

247
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,375
Planet Earth.

248
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:57,208
That sounds familiar. I'm sure
I've been there before.

249
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,208
A while back,
I wiped out some dinosaurs

250
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:02,333
with attitude problems, but I
graciously spared their world.

251
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:03,666
That was Earth, wasn't it?

252
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,875
However, it seems that
one of the Earth-Saiyans,

253
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,416
Goku--he's the one
who defeated Frieza--

254
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,791
is currently not there.

255
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,916
He defeated Frieza?

256
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Oh! The water's
not that deep, my lord.

257
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,500
[BEERUS]
Eh--uhhh.

258
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,625
So, you were
telling me about a Saiyan

259
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,541
who somehow bested Frieza?

260
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,916
Yes. As I've said
he's called Goku,

261
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,250
though "Kakarot"
is his given Saiyan name.

262
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,125
And at the moment
it appears that he's doing

263
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,708
some sort of training
on the North Kai's world.

264
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:35,791
Suspicious. Can you
show me what he looks like?

265
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,541
[BEERUS] So that's Goku.

266
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,958
During his battle
with Frieza, I take it.

267
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,750
[WHIS]
Yes, that's the one.

268
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:50,875
Hmm. Isn't Saiyan hair
supposed to be black?

269
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,416
Saiyans possess the ability
to transform themselves

270
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,708
dramatically, increasing their
strength by several fold.

271
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:59,666
The technique has been forgotten
for generations until now.

272
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,500
They call it
"Super Saiyan," I believe.

273
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,125
Not Super Saiyan God?

274
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,708
No, unfortunately not.

275
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:09,416
[BEERUS]
A Super Saiyan.

276
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,083
That may not be
what I'm looking for,

277
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,416
but it certainly comes close.

278
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,708
[BEERUS]
Whis, how long will it take us

279
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,541
to get to North Kai's planet?

280
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:23,166
Approximately 26 minutes
and 44 seconds, my lord.

281
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,166
They're really
that far away?

282
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,958
So about the length of your
average anime episode?

283
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,458
Aah... I hate long flights!

284
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:33,333
Ah, but what choice is there?
I'll suck it up and go.

285
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:35,041
Whis, can you
pack us a nice lunch

286
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,333
for the ride, at least?

287
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,125
As you wish, my lord.

00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,250
The grand prize
is super valuable

314
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,750
and took a lot
of effort to assemble,

315
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,166
so be extra careful.

316
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,833
Absolutely, ma'am.

317
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,166
[A18] Since we almost always
end up flying anyway,

318
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,958
why do we even bother
starting off in the car?

319
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,833
Look. We're not the
only ones who felt like

320
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:36,291
cheating our way
out of that traffic.

321
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:41,208
Yamcha! Puar! What's up?!
Only way to travel, right?

322
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,541
Hey, Krillin,
how's it going?

323
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,333
Long time no see, buddy!

324
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,583
[TIEN]
Great minds think alike.

325
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,958
[KRILLIN] Tien and Chiaotzu,
how've ya been?!

326
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,458
This is quite
the reunion, huh?

327
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:52,666
Hi!

328
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,875
[CHIAOTZU] Bla-la-da-la-da.
[MARRON laughs]

329
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,333
[A18]
Hm.

00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,958
[seagulls caw]

331
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,916
[GOHAN]
Hi, Bulma!

332
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,041
[GOTEN laughs]

333
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,291
Hey, Trunks!

334
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,500
[TRUNKS]
Hey!

335
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,541
Welcome aboard, guys.
Thanks for comin'!

336
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,083
This boat is insane, Goten.

337
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,791
There's like
a million rooms at least!

338
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,541
You gotta check it out! Come on!

339
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:17,958
Yeah, let's explore!

340
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,166
Happy birthday, Bulma.

341
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,458
We're so glad we can
celebrate with you.

342
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:23,208
That's right,
happy birthday, girl!

343
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,000
We hope it's a great year.

344
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,125
Thanks, guys.
I'm glad you made it.

345
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,333
Guess we're a little early.

346
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:29,875
Are we the first ones here?

347
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:33,166
I wish. The bikini inspectors
have been here for a while.

348
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,416
[ROSHI] Hurry up, Oolong!
Keep those coins a coming!

349
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,083
[ROSHI chuckles]

350
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,583
It's my turn, old man.
I thought I was the hog!

351
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,958
[ROSHI] Oh butt out!
I just found the sweet spot!

352
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:48,208
Yeah, that's it, ladies!
Shake what mama gave ya!

353
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:49,833
Damn this bloody nose.

354
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,000
Hurry up!

355
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:54,458
Have some patience, piggy!
I'm almost done!

356
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:57,750
He-heh! Jackpot!

357
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:00,708
Ah! It ran out!
Quick, Oolong, coin me!

358
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,250
Have you no decency?

359
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,291
There are very
impressionable kids here!

360
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:05,791
Would you grow up?

361
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:09,041
Relax, Chichi.
I'm just bird watching.

362
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,041
And cue the nosebleed.

363
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:15,458
[indistinctive chatter]

364
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,333
[YAMCHA]
So whatchya been up to?

365
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:18,833
Nice trick, Chiaotzu!

366
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,750
[MR. SATAN]
Yeah, I'm huge!

367
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,208
[gasps]

368
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,583
Hey what are you doing?
We're not serving the meal yet!

369
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,125
[BUU grunts]

370
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,625
You're supposed to be mingling
not eating the main course!

371
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,125
I'm the one
who planned this party.

372
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,000
Nobody eats till I say so!

373
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,708
Buu eat when want to!

374
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:39,041
[MR. SATAN] Okay, okay! I'm real
sorry about that, Bulma.

375
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,375
Let me talk to him, all right?

376
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,916
Take it easy, Buu,
nobody's mad at ya!

377
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,208
Now why don't you take
a fun little walk with me.

378
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,541
I saw some appetizers
that I know you'd like!

379
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,166
Okay Mr. Satan!

380
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,250
[MR. SATAN]
There's a whole tray,

381
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,916
and you can even
eat the toothpicks!

382
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,916
Buu like toothpicks!
They feel pokey! Ha-ha!

383
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,125
[GOHAN] It's a picture from
our wedding, Piccolo.

384
00:17:58,208 --> 00:17:59,541
We're giving one
to every guest,

385
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,833
and that's the best shot of you
the photographer got.

386
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:04,375
Thank you, Gohan.
That's very nice.

387
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,625
Aah!

388
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:08,541
Go--But my--! Augh!

389
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:09,875
Your eyes are shut.

390
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,375
But it's actually the only
picture you let us take.

391
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,750
[grunts]

392
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,958
[panting]

393
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:25,458
[VEGETA]
I will be number one!

394
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:28,250
Vegeta told you to tell me
he's too busy training?

395
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,041
And Goku's not coming either?

396
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,500
[GOHAN]
Sorry.

397
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,791
[GOKU yells]

398
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,958
Aaah! What, Goku?
What's wrong?

399
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,958
Don't tell me he's here!

400
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,583
It's Bulma's birthday!

401
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,541
She's having a gigantic
birthday party

402
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,166
and I totally forgot about it!

403
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,583
[KING KAI]
Waaaa!

404
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:52,500
She's gonna be so mad
if I don't show!

405
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:56,333
Oh man, this is bad. She's so
scary when she's angry.

406
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,208
I remember the last time
I missed her party...

407
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,125
[KING KAI] Why does he have to
startle me like that?

408
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,041
I thought he'd seen Lord Beerus.

409
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,166
Though I don't know why
I'm worrying so much.

410
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:07,791
There's no reason for the
Destroyer to come here, right?

411
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:08,916
He-heh.

412
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,333
You know, I've about
had it with those

413
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,416
training-obsessed Saiyans!

414
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,833
Forget 'em! Let's go!
Let the party cruise commence!

415
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:25,458
[fog horn blows]

416
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,375
[WHIS]
All right, Lord Beerus.

417
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:34,208
I've got our lunches
packed up and ready to go.

418
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,750
Very good.

419
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,666
So what's on the menu?

420
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,333
The main course
is grilled river fish from

421
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,416
the famous estuaries
of Planet Wartrin,

422
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,208
paired it with a side of
cluckbird <i>nanban</i>

423
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:46,750
from the Sixty-fifth Nebula.

424
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,916
[BEERUS]
I forget, do I like <i>nanban</i> ?

425
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,375
[WHIS]
You do, my lord.

426
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,666
[BEERUS] Well, if we find
a nice view along the way,

427
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,083
maybe we can stop and eat.

428
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:57,375
[WHIS] Excellent plan.
I'll be on the lookout.

429
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:58,625
Hmm.

430
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,250
Now, are you ready,
Lord Beerus?

431
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,708
Yes.

432
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,333
[ELDER KAI]
I was right to worry.

433
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,375
Beerus has only
been awake for half a day

434
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,125
and we've already
lost eight worlds

435
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,583
to his senseless destruction.

436
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,708
It's hard to believe that
he could move so quickly.

437
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,833
Are we sure he's
responsible for them all?

438
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:23,375
His astounding speed is what
makes Beerus so devastating.

439
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,625
This is hardly the first time
he's caught me off guard

440
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,000
with his quickness.

441
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,666
The truth is that
he's the one who trapped me

442
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,000
inside the Z Sword.

443
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,375
[KIBITO KAI gasps]

444
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:34,000
He surprised me. It happened
in the blink of an eye.

445
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,458
I didn't know about that, sir.

446
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,583
Clearly I've underestimated him.

447
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,625
[ELDER KAI] Mmm.
So tell me, young one,

448
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,125
can you sense
Beerus' energy now?

449
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:47,208
I can. He's moving
at tremendous speed.

450
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:50,041
[ELDER KAI grunts lowly]

451
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,625
[ELDER KAI]
What? No!

452
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:00,666
But why?

453
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,666
Of all the countless planets
in the universe.

454
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,083
Why would he be heading
for the North Kai's world?

455
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,666
I sense it, too, Ancestor.

456
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,333
But it makes no sense
for him to go there

457
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:12,000
unless he already
knows about Goku!

458
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:15,875
So our greatest fear
is indeed coming true.

459
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:19,708
Are a few quick decades
of calm so much to ask for?

460
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:23,375
What should we do? Is there
some way to intervene?

461
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:26,333
Can we keep Goku
and Beerus from meeting?

462
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:29,916
I'm afraid anything we try
at this point would be futile.

463
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,541
Beerus is a force of nature,
like a hurricane,

464
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,875
and we cannot change
his course. All we can do

465
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:38,708
is watch from here and
wait for the storm to pass.

466
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:40,083
[KIBITO KAI]
Oh no.

467
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,333
There's a lot more at stake
than planets this time.
