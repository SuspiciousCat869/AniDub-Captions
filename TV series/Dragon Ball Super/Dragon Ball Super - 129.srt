It's the same problem
he had with Kefla.

94
00:06:29,796 --> 00:06:32,090
Goku has been shaped
by a lifetime of fighting

observes his foes

In each moment he
attempts to strike,

00:09:46,576 --> 00:09:49,537
get off calling
yourself a "god."

161
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:51,539
You watch yourself, mortal.

162
00:09:51,623 --> 00:09:52,957
Oh, come on.

163
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,502
Are you suggesting that he
can master Ultra Instinct

164
00:09:55,585 --> 00:09:57,045
in the time he has left?

165
00:09:57,128 --> 00:09:59,756
Please! [laughs]

166
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,675
You're a fool!
That's impossible!

167
00:10:01,758 --> 00:10:04,260
And you'd bet your life on that?

168
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,055
[VEGETA]
Forty-eight minutes.

169
00:10:07,138 --> 00:10:10,308
That's all we were given for
this Tournament of Power.

170
00:10:10,392 --> 00:10:13,561
Yet in that brief time span,
we Saiyans warriors

171
00:10:13,645 --> 00:10:17,107
have shattered our limits,
time after time!

172
00:10:18,817 --> 00:10:21,361
[VEGETA] You've seen it with
your own eyes, Destroyer.

173
00:10:21,444 --> 00:10:23,029
[growls]

174
00:10:33,206 --> 00:10:35,542
[BELMOD]
Jiren! What are you waiting for?

175
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:39,421
End this! Knock Goku out
of this tournament now!

176
00:10:39,504 --> 00:10:42,716
[JIREN grunts]

177
00:10:45,385 --> 00:10:47,012
Come on, Kakarot!

178
00:10:47,095 --> 00:10:50,557
Find a way! I entrusted
everything to you!

179
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,268
My pride, my promise,
everything!

180
00:10:53,351 --> 00:10:55,895
I won't tolerate failure!

181
00:10:55,979 --> 00:10:58,773
Trespass into the
domain of the gods,

182
00:10:58,857 --> 00:11:01,276
and use that might
to conquer Jiren!

183
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:03,820
Do it, Kakarot!

184
00:11:04,821 --> 00:11:10,368
[yelling]

185

[inhales]

187
00:12:40,834 --> 00:12:43,586
[ROSHI] Guess Vegeta's idea
of a pep talk did the trick.

188
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,088
Goku's bounced back.

189
00:12:45,171 --> 00:12:47,716
But now he's just fighting
Jiren to a draw.

190
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:50,385
The scales aren't
tipping in his favor yet.

191
00:12:50,468 --> 00:12:52,721
And that massive battle cry...

192
00:12:52,804 --> 00:12:54,973
He did that last
time against Jiren,

193
00:12:55,056 --> 00:12:57,976
right before he ran out of gas.

194
00:12:58,059 --> 00:13:01,604
[KRILLIN] Are you in trouble,
buddy? Is this it?

195
00:13:32,677 --> 00:13:34,054
Do you see that, my lord?

196
00:13:34,137 --> 00:13:35,305
Huh?

197
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:40,060
It would appear that we have new
reason for hope, Lord Beerus.

198
00:13:40,143 --> 00:13:43,605
I can feel it. Not the
chaos of consciousness,

199
00:13:43,688 --> 00:13:45,690
but the elegant
purity of energy

200
00:13:45,774 --> 00:13:48,026
operating on impulse alone.

201
00:13:48,109 --> 00:13:50,779
Goku is focused
only on Jiren now--

202
00:13:50,862 --> 00:13:52,781
or rather, on the battle itself.

203
00:13:52,864 --> 00:13:56,034
He is throwing his whole body
and soul into the fleeting

204
00:13:56,117 --> 00:13:57,702
moment of each strike.

205
00:13:57,786 --> 00:14:00,622
Allowing the flames of
his power to rage freely,

206
00:14:00,705 --> 00:14:03,124
unrestrained by
the walls of thought.

207
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:06,586
Concerns for his universe,
or the gap in their powers,

208
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:09,130
his hesitation,
his impatience, his fear--

209
00:14:09,214 --> 00:14:12,717
he has given them all to
the fire and let them burn.

210
00:14:12,801 --> 00:14:14,719
So that now there
is only himself,

211
00:14:14,803 --> 00:14:17,305
his opponent, and the fight.

212
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:19,974
Soon, he will reach a realm
still faster, keener,

213
00:14:20,058 --> 00:14:21,267
and deeper than instinct,

214
00:14:21,351 --> 00:14:23,770
where even that awareness
will blur and fade.

215
00:14:23,853 --> 00:14:26,314
And beyond that...

216
00:14:28,358 --> 00:14:31,277
I don't understand where he's
getting all of this power.

217
00:14:31,361 --> 00:14:34,739
[TOP] Goku is generating a
heat I've never felt before.

218
00:14:34,823 --> 00:14:38,284
Uh! All I know is that we
can't let this continue.

219
00:14:38,368 --> 00:14:40,995
Jiren! Get him, now!

220
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:43,373
Hurry and end this!

221
00:14:43,456 --> 00:14:44,624
[JIREN grunting]

222
00:14:52,716 --> 00:14:54,634
[JIREN yells]

223
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:09,691
[SUPREME KAI] Jiren's attacks
are intensifying as well!

224
00:15:09,774 --> 00:15:11,735
[ELDER KAI]
That's a remarkable technique.

225
00:15:11,818 --> 00:15:14,404
Jiren's using extreme
rapid-fire punches

226
00:15:14,487 --> 00:15:17,407
to generate a barrage
of powerful shockwaves.

227
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,325
He's got Goku pinned down.

228
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:21,327
And look where Goku is standing.

229
00:15:21,411 --> 00:15:24,289
It's a ring fragment with
nothing else beneath it.

230
00:15:24,372 --> 00:15:25,874
He falls, he's done.

231
00:15:25,957 --> 00:15:28,418
Even with that shield he's
created there's no telling

232
00:15:28,501 --> 00:15:30,003
when that rock will crumble.

233
00:15:30,086 --> 00:15:32,756
And all the other rocks near him
are getting blown apart, too.

234
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:35,759
If he doesn't make a move soon
he'll have nowhere else to go.

235
00:15:35,842 --> 00:15:39,888
Quick, Goku! Get outta there
while you still can! Hurry up!

236
00:15:39,971 --> 00:15:41,389
He knows.

237
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:43,892
But he's got his hands full
just blocking those attacks.

238
00:15:43,975 --> 00:15:47,771
He has no time to move, much
less use Instant Transmission.

239
00:15:47,854 --> 00:15:51,733
[KRILLIN gasps]
Then... Then what's the answer?

240
00:15:51,816 --> 00:15:54,611
There's gotta be
something he could do!

241
00:15:54,694 --> 00:15:55,904
No more talk.

242
00:15:55,987 --> 00:15:57,280
[ALL gasp]

243
00:15:58,656 --> 00:16:01,534
Just shut your mouths and watch.

244
00:16:02,619 --> 00:16:04,371
Lord Beerus...

245
00:16:33,858 --> 00:16:35,527
[BELMOD chuckles]
Poor Beerus.

246
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:38,196
It sounds like he's
accepted the inevitable.

247
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:40,448
At long lost,
we've come to the end.

248
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:42,701
Either Goku will drain
the last of his power,

249
00:16:42,784 --> 00:16:44,828
or that rock will crumble
beneath his feet.

250
00:16:44,911 --> 00:16:48,081
Whichever way he loses, all we
have to do is wait, my lord.

251
00:16:48,164 --> 00:16:50,542
Yeah, you got that right.

252
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:55,463
We should savor this, as the
moment our victory was sealed.

253
00:16:56,673 --> 00:16:57,841
See those sparks?

Hm?

[TOP] They look like collisions
from opposing shockwaves.

256

[TOP] Goku isn't only
shielding himself now,

257
00:17:12,605 --> 00:17:14,941
he's launching a
counteroffensive.

He sliced through Jiren's

[FUTURE ZENO]
Sparkly and whooshy!

[ZENO] Do you think all of that
could be Goku's energy?

if his energy goes any higher
we could all be crushed!

00:21:48,381 --> 00:21:51,926
<i>Whirling all around</i>
<i>and then back again</i>

321
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:55,847
<i>The song that connects you</i>
<i>to the heavens</i>

322
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:59,392
<i>Strength that goes</i>
<i>beyond all measure</i>

323
00:21:59,476 --> 00:22:02,270
<i>Expanding to a beat</i>
<i>that won't end</i>

324
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:05,982
<i>The meteors fall like rain drops</i>

325
00:22:06,066 --> 00:22:09,736
<i>Astrological tears</i>
<i>from my eyelids</i>

326
00:22:09,819 --> 00:22:15,075
<i>A strong emotion</i>
<i>from deep within</i>

327
00:22:15,158 --> 00:22:17,369
<i>Has been awakened</i>

328
00:22:17,452 --> 00:22:20,997
<i>A spark of possibility</i>

329
00:22:21,081 --> 00:22:24,834
<i>Shines softly like a star</i>
<i>in the night sky</i>

330
00:22:24,918 --> 00:22:29,923
<i>A wish from long</i>
<i>ago now shoots by</i>

331
00:22:30,006 --> 00:22:32,217
<i>And I'm awakened</i>

332
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,970
<i>A never-ending melody,</i>
<i>so enchanting</i>

333
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:39,724
<i>You're always the one</i>
<i>who makes me tremble</i>

334
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:44,020
<i>The meteors keep falling down</i>

335
00:22:44,104 --> 00:22:47,315
<i>Surging right into my heart</i>

336
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:52,737
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

337
00:22:52,821 --> 00:22:55,115
Now that I've reached truly
Autonomous Ultra Instinct,

338
00:22:55,198 --> 00:22:57,033
I can't wait to let it rip!

339
00:22:57,117 --> 00:23:00,662
Still, even against my awesome
power, Jiren's not folding easy.

340
00:23:00,745 --> 00:23:02,956
He's raising his own
strength even higher!

341
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,708
But with the lives of
everyone I care about

342
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:06,543
on the line, I can't fail.

343
00:23:06,626 --> 00:23:09,379
So let's do this,
Jiren. You and me!

344
00:23:09,462 --> 00:23:11,506
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

345
00:23:11,589 --> 00:23:13,550
"The Greatest Showdown
of All Time!

346
00:23:13,633 --> 00:23:15,635
The Ultimate Survival Battle!"

347
00:23:15,719 --> 00:23:17,345
Make sure you don't
miss it, okay?
