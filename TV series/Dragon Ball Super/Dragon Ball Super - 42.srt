on Dragon Ball Super,

with Goku and friends having won
the Tournament of Destroyers,

of his bet with Champa,

26
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:20,083

of the Super Dragon Balls

27

But after all the fighting
and scheming,

29
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:28,708
the wish Beerus ultimately
made wasn't for himself,

30
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:31,875
but rather for
the benefit of Champa.

That was very kind of you, sir.

So, I can be done with
this asinine farce!

315
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,750
[BULMA] Hold on, boys! Don't
have your big fight around us!

316
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,416
This is supposed to be
a classy victory party!

317

Take your fight over there!
C'mon, move!

Hmm? Now, be a big boy
and go clean up your mess.

320
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:11,708
Okay, Mr. Monaka?

321
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:14,250
Remember, that if
he learns the truth,

322
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,916
he could lose
his motivation to train.

323
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,125
I doubt a disinterested Goku
will go over well

with the Omni-King.

Bulma! Can you please
show Lord Beerus some respect?

328
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:35,000
This seems like an
all right spot for our fight.

Oh yeah?

333
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,333
Looks like Lord Beerus
is having some trouble.

334
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:04,166
He's worrying more about
the costume than fighting well.

335
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,416
Aaugh! I can't believe
we forced a god into this

336
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,333
humiliating scam! So, Bulma!

337
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,750
What's our fallback plan
if Beerus gets sick of this

338
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,916
and decides he'll just
destroy the earth instead?

339
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,416
Uh, good point. Maybe we
did get too carried away.

340
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,083
At the time,
it seemed like it'd work.

Hey, let the record
show I was against this

With that mask on,
we can't know either way!

[WHIS] I agree with Krillin.
He is enjoying himself.

370
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:04,125
Having to fight in that costume
as if he's someone else

371
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,791
must be a novel experience.

372
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,875
Plus, the nature of the
Tournament of Destroyers

373
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,458
rendered him only a spectator,

374
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:12,666
so I'm sure he's itching to do
a little fighting himself.

375

Lame costume aside,
this whole fake fight

376

might be a real treat for him.
