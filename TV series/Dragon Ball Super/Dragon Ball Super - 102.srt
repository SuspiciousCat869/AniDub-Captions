of Universe Two's
glamorous champions!

While our mortal level
may not be the highest,

167
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:31,083
the power of our love is the
greatest in all the cosmos!

Woo hoo!

Oh boy, those young ladies just
got at least ten times prettier!

I don't know.

174
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,708
I kinda think they were cuter
before they transformed.

175
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:50,041
Well, beauty is in the eye
of the beholder, after all.

176
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:52,375
Preferences differ
from person to person.

And universe to universe.

Well done! That is justice!

179
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:01,083
Huh. I guess there's all
kinds of transformations.

180
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:04,375
Yeah, but will you show us
what you can actually do?

All right. Here we go!

Must not inhale.

The light of love.

194
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:49,583
Once intoxicated by its
sweet aroma, it's all over.

195
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,166
You'll be unable to resist,

How is our team?

Oh! They appear to be
holding up quite well.

203

One way or another,
they're all staying strong

204
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:12,291
in the face of this
assault. Even...

It's time for us to split up

[PICCOLO, TIEN]
Right!

[BEERUS growls]
You mean to tell me

219
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:57,583
Universe Two was hiding that up
their sleeves this whole time?

220
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,000
They may not look that tough,

221
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,625
but they've turned this whole
competition upside down.

222
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:06,708
Precisely. Beneath their lovely
exterior lies great strength.

223
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:10,000
And now, let it wash
over all of you!

That's your full power?

excruciating buildup,

I was expecting more from you

00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,041
than just a light spritzing
of love potion.

My aren't we impatient?

That was just
a little amuse-bouche.

00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:39,708
To whet your appetite
for the main course.

Well, well, well.

just for show after all.

with passionate

She's a confidant hunter
who knows what she wants,

and always catches her prey.

and using it to her advantage.

Clawing, biting, bounding
from peak to peak.

Seems she truly is
a creature of the wild.

Yes indeed she is.

303

And this ring's jagged wasteland
is the perfect setting

for her to show off
her savage moves.

There's no way to escape from
her relentless, untamed attacks.

Trying to evade her is
an exercise in futility.

The stamina of a beast
warrior never lets up.

At least not until her prey
exhausts all of its energy.

rather poorly.

not so bad, either.

[screams]

323
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,166
Bye now.

324
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,958
[SANKA COO screams]

325
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:11,041
Oh yeah! That girl
is outta here!

326
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:16,416
[BIKAL grunts]

327
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,833
[SANKA COO yells]

328
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,583
Nice save!

329
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:31,583
It's nothing. You were amazing!

330
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,625
[SANKA COO] I couldn't
have done it without you.

331
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,291
Thank you for the assist.

332
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,583
[BIKAL] There's no need
for you to thank me.

333
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:41,500
It's my duty. I would do
anything for you.

334
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,041
[SANKA COO]
Oh, Bikal!

335
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,958
[BIKAL]
Oh, Kakunsa!

336
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:49,041
Wow, what a truly
beautiful sight to behold!

337
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:50,750
That's the power of love!

338
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:53,000
When you're feeling it,
nothing can stop you!

339
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,250
This is hardly
the time or place.

340
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,000
I thought for certain she'd
be out of the ring for good.

341
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,541
Me, too.

342
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:02,875
Those winged warriors can be
a real pain in the patootie.

343
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,833
[KRILLIN]
C'mon, 17.

344
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,583
[footsteps]

345
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:17,958
Do you need something?

346
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,250
Just noticed you were
having some trouble.

347
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,916
Do you want a little help?

348
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,458
[A17]
Don't worry about me.

349
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,916
Fighting that little beast
made me start thinking about

350
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
the animals I left behind
on the island,

351
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:31,041
and so I let my guard down.

352
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:33,375
Now to fight like I mean it.

353
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:36,500
[BIKAL] All right, I'm off to go
see if the others need any help.

354
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:40,125
Okay. I think I can take
down this prey on my own.

355
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,708
[BIKAL]
Happy hunting, Kakunsa.

356
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,833
[gasps, screams]

[BIKAL screams]

360
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,541
Oh, Bikal!

361
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:59,916
It appears that she's in no
condition to continue fighting.

362
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,708
[GRAND MINISTER]
Bikal from the Second Universe

363
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:04,875
is out of bounds,
and therefore, eliminated.

364
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,208
[FUTURE ZENO]
Boop!

365
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:09,208
[growling] You bastard!

366
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,583
How dare you hurt my Bikal!

367
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,541
The flyers ruin it
for the rest of us,

368
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:19,708
so that's why I took care
of your friend first.

369
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:23,166
[SANKA COO] Why you lousy,
no-good, dirty, rotten,

370
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,541
arrogant, smug, insensitive...

371
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:29,750
Can I offer some maidenly
assistance? Where'd you--?

372
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,458
Stay away!

373
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,875
That wicked creature
is my quarry!

374
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:36,500
He's going to pay for
what he did to Bikal!

375
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:39,666
Oh Kakunsa. As you wish.

376
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,750
You've got love on your side!

377
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:50,166
[yells]

378
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,083
That move may have
worked on me earlier,

379
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:08,375
but now I've got
you pinned down!

380
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,583
Huh?

381
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:17,166
[SANKA COO]
What? But how?!

382
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,166
He's using the light
as a foothold?

383
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,666
That was the entire point
of his last attack. Yeah!

384
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,958
[CHAMPA]
Is he even allowed to do that?

385
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:25,833
[ZENOS laughing]

386
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:27,916
Looks like it to me.

387
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,250
[yells]

388
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,250
This fight has been instructive.

389
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,750
I do appreciate the lesson.

390
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:44,166
[SANKA COO grunts, screams]

391
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:50,500
[SOUS ROAS]
Uh?! Kakunsa!

392
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,791
Hey, not bad, 17.

393
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,458
But when we were
sparring on your island,

394
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,166
you didn't use anything
like that move,

395
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,083
which means you were
probably holding out on me,

396
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,750
isn't that right?

397
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,833
[GOKU laughs] I bet you've got
all kinds of secret powers

398
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:05,083
you're keeping hidden from us.

[GRAND MINISTER]
Kakunsa of the Second Universe

400
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,750
has been eliminated.

Boop!

402
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:12,041
Yeah! Nice work!

00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:15,208
Well, I'll be, he took two
of 'em out, back-to-back!

404
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,458
Yeah, that sounds
like 17, all right!

405
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,750
[SANKA COO growls]

406
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:23,166
[BRIANNE] It wasn't enough to
interrupt our transformation.

407
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:26,708
You had to knock out
Bikal and Kakunsa, too.

408
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:30,166
I swear, you will pay for that!

409
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:35,708
Maidenly anger!

00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,125
[NARRATOR]
One after another,

411

warriors are falling
by the wayside.

412
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:46,416
Now, only 39 minutes remain to
decide the fate of the Cosmos.
