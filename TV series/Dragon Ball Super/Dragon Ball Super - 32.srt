Don't you wanna dream again?

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,920
Now it's calling for me go back to the start

3
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,910
Wishing on the starlight

4
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,770
In the sky, let's paint a door for tomorrow

00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,550
Just step on the new stage don't be shy

Let's! Go! Go! Big panic

00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:50,990
I don't care 'bout limits, no regret

10
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:56,540
Make me tougher even though I lose

11
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,440
Nothing gonna stop me no mo' try me

[NARRATOR] Previously
on Dragon Ball Super,

17
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:32,010
Bulma and Jaco journeyed
into space to learn more

18
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,910
about the Seventh Universe's
Super Dragon Balls,

19
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,810
which Bulma hoped
would protect Earth

20
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,280
against the
unpredictable Beerus.

21
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,090
Salutations.
I am Master Zuno.

22
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,260
[NARRATOR] Bulma hoped
Master Zuno would help

23
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,960
with his encyclopedic
knowledge of the cosmos.

24
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,360
But, what he revealed stopped
their mission in its tracks.

25
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,860
Can you tell us everything
about the Super Dragon Balls?

26
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,770
That's my next question!

27
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,600
Very well, I shall give you
a comprehensive answer

28
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,440
on these cosmic artifacts.

29
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,640
Super Dragon Balls
are extremely rare

30
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,140
and only number seven.

31
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,340
They are divided between the
Sixth and Seventh Universes.

[panting]

00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,480
Well, you sure don't
make it easy on me.

37
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,090
Every time we fight, you find
flaws I didn't know I had.

38
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,590
[VEGETA]
Hmph!

39
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,230
[VEGETA] Same's true for me,
much as I hate admitting it.

40
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:58,330
But, I'm glad he came.
I can tell I've made progress.

41
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,000
I can't wait to fight,
and crush, that other team.

42
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,700
[GOKU]
So, this is Monaka guy.

43
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,540
What do you think he's like?

44
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,510
--What?
--That guy Beerus picked.

45
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,170
I'm just wondering
what makes him

46
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,580
the toughest opponent
Beerus has ever faced.

47
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,610
This obsession
of yours is pointless.

48
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,880
Focus on the team
you'll be fighting.

49
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,920
But I can't help it.
We know the Sixth Universe

50
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,550
has strong fighters,
but we don't know

51
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,090
how strong they really are.

52
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,550
[VEGETA] If Beerus
expected a cakewalk,

53
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,090
he would have just relied on us.

54
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,260
The fact he didn't
is all you need to know.

55
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,460
Oh, yeah, right!
You sure are a genius, Vegeta!

56
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,230
[VEGETA]
Compared to you I am.

57
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,330
So, there's gonna be
six awesome new fighters,

58
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,530
including Monaka,
for us to face.

59
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,740
Man, I am super duper pumped up.

60
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,240
[VEGETA]
You sound like a child.

61
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,970
Can't you act your age for once?

62
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,470
[GOKU]
I am acting my age!

63
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,140
You said Saiyans
keep our youth till we're

64
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,710
about eighty, right? Right?

65
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,210
I don't mean your body,
I mean your brain.

66

Uuuh...

to the tournament venue shortly.

Please form a single-file line,
and board the hexahedron.

Let's try to be civilized.

[GOTEN]
Where's the door?

77
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,940
Is this thing
really a spaceship?

78
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,280
I don't see any engine!

79
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,650
No, not a spaceship;
a hexahedron!

80
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,680
And you board it like so.

Just step through,
and the smart-wall

84

[ALL gasp]

The first leg
of our flight will be to

87
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:42,200
Lord Beerus' world. We'll meet
up with my lord and Monaka

88
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,630
and continue to the site.

89
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,970
Travel time will be
approximately three hours.

90
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:48,440
While our final destination
will have facilities,

91
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,610
this vessel,
as you see, does not.

before boarding, okay?

I don't see our Saiyans.

96
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,020
They realize
they have to be there

97
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,620
to fight, don't they?

98
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,890
I've given up trying to care.
I haven't heard a peep from 'em

to train in the Time Chamber.

of your galaxy finds room

in his busy schedule
for you, it'd be nice

pretend to care.

00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:42,510
The strongest mortal
Beerus knows!

159
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,190
[VEGETA] He doesn't look
that impressive to me.

160
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,290
Yeah, well, let's not
underestimate him just yet,

161
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,490
and Beerus should know, right?

162
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:54,960
[BEERUS]
You're late.

163
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,360
Apologies for that, my lord.

164
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,200
But, between the showers
and the defecation,

165
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,930
we just couldn't get moving.

166
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,300
So, you're Monaka aren't you;
the fifth member of our team?

167
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,170
Well, we've been hearing
a lot about you, man!

168
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,910
Good to meet you!
My name is Goku!

169
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,380
Okay.

170
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,810
You are speaking to the most
important weapon we have.

171
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,820
Considering your
utter lack of tact,

172
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,980
you should talk to him
as little as you can.

173
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,190
[GOKU] I was asking Whis what
he could tell me about you,

174
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,150
and he said your name
means "great pontas "

175
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,320
on your world. Is that right?

176
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,260
Yes, pronunciation aside.

177
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,560
It sounded interesting, but I
don't know what pontas are.

178
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,900
Does that mean
strength or something?

179
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,930
It means nipples.

180
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,200
[GOKU chuckles nervously]

181
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,100
I have large,
shapely nipples.

182
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:43,840
I have ever since I was born.

183
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,210
You don't say.
[chuckles nervously]

184
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,010
Good to know! I guess.

185
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,350
And, this is why
I don't want you to talk.

186
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,850
You got it.

187
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:55,350
Even up close he still doesn't
look that strong, does he?

188
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,550
Not at all.
I am very confused.

189
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:00,060
Hey. Whaddaya say you
practice with me real quick?

190
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,060
Nothing big,
just a short little spar--?

191
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:04,030
Goku! Did I not
already tell you

192
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,630
to save your energy
for your actual opponents?

193
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:10,630
Okay, okay,
Lord Beerus. I'm sorry!

194
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,440
[BEERUS]
Let's go.

195
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,450
[GOKU yells]

196
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:40,230
[MONAKA sniffles]

197
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,500
Just how much
brain damage do you have?

198
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,070
Well, I didn't mean to hit him!

199
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,570
I just wanted
to see his reflexes

200
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:49,110
and I figured he'd duck!
I'm so sorry, dude.

201
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,980
I didn't mean anything
by it, I swear!

202
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,580
Fine. Don't worry
about it. Dude.

203
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,580
[BOTH grunt]

204
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,490
[CHICHI]
Here you go!

205
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,990
I can't believe you
packed a grill, Chichi.

206
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,930
Well, Goku didn't give me
the space picnic he promised.

207
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,830
So, I'm making one myself!
Here, Vegeta!

208
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:19,200
This is the first decent meal
I've had in three years.

209
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:22,110
I apologize on what
you're about to witness.

210
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:33,820
No, thank you. I can't
eat that sort of organism.

211
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:37,550
[gasps] Watching what you eat
to stay healthy, huh?

212
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,790
That's impressive, man!
I couldn't live without meat!

213
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,830
[WHIS] Almost there.
Just a few more galaxies.

214
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,700
And... wa-la!

215
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,870
[gasps]

216
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:03,550
[ALL gasp]

217
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,450
So, they really exist, huh?

218
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:09,990
Man, they're huge!

219
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,610
They really are
the Super Dragon Balls!

220
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,870
[BULMA]
This is unbelievable, Whis!

221
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,540
When you said they were
as big as planets,

222
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,370
I thought you were exaggerating,
but they really are!

223
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,970
I mean you could actually
live on these things!

224
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,780
[KRILLIN]
Yeah, imagine the power!

225
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,110
No wonder you could
wish for anything.

226
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,350
I think that's more
than enough sightseeing.

227
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,650
Whis, let's go!

228
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,520
[WHIS]
Understood, my lord.

229
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:01,060
[TRUNKS, GOTEN]
Aw, yeah!

230
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,460
[PICCOLO] Seems like a lot
of trouble for a tournament

231
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,870
they'll only hold once.

232
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,400
Lord Champa
only had a few days--

233
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,370
did he build
all this stuff himself?

234
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:15,210
No, Saiyan, Destroyers
do not build anything.

235
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,380
And even if we did, my brother
would never be capable of this.

236
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,480
It would just
be paper and sticks.

237
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,580
[CHAMPA]
I heard that, Beerus.

238
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,880
Want to say that to my face?

239
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,690
[BULMA]
So, that's Champa?

240
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:35,530
Yes. The Destroyer
of the Sixth Universe.

241
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,830
Honestly, I'm shocked
you didn't back out.

242
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,400
Of course I came, Champa.

243
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:43,000
As if I'd miss the opportunity
to see your face when you lose.

244
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,910
And, take your precious rock
collection for myself.

245
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,540
Glad you're confident.

246
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,280
It'll make taking Earth
much more fun.

247
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,180
[BEERUS] By the way...
I know about your

248
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:55,550
dirty little secret, Champa.
You stole some of those orbs

249
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:58,280
from my universe, which
explains your trespassing.

250
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,850
What're you talking about?

251
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,290
We know there are
only seven of them

252
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,860
spread across our two universes,

253
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,620
so that means you must've
taken some of ours!

254
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,690
[shrieks]
Who told you that?

255
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,360
[BEERUS] I knew you were
up to something.

256
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,960
Wait! I did no such thing.

257
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,900
If you weren't my
twin brother I'd destroy you

258
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:14,030
for such a theft.
Not that it matters.

259
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,900
They'll all be mine soon anyway.

260
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,300
You should be using this time

261
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,440
preparing for
inevitable failure.

262
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,210
[VADOS]
Are you two done yet?

263
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,980
If so then I can escort
you all to the arena now.

264
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,750
As you can see, we have
ample seating for everyone.

265
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,450
Are those seats
made outta rock?

266
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,550
Ugh. Don't you have
cushions or something?

267
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,950
Trunks is right!
We came a long way for this,

268
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,820
so you could at least
make us comfortable!

269
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:37,260
No one forced you
to come, Earthling!

270
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:39,260
I think she has a point, Champa.

271
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,960
What kind of a host
allows their guests

272
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,730
to sit in such cut-rate seats?

273
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,630
Honestly, I'd be humiliated
if I were the one responsible.

274
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,070
You take that back!

275
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,300
--[BEERUS] Whis!
--Yes, my lord.

276
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:54,140
I always do enjoy redecorating.
Now, let's see.

00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,160
[ALL gasp]

278
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,520
[whispers]
You're making me look bad.

279
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,160
Why didn't you make
it fancy? I know you can

280
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,990
do better than
stone bleachers!

281
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:17,100
Sir, it would be
disrespectful for an artist

282
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,800
to create a work
of art her patron

283
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:21,500
would not appreciate
or understand.

284
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,200
That's my older sister for you.

285
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:26,040
Yes. She was just trying
to operate on your level.

286
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,370
You should thank your attendant

287
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,880
for being so
well-heeled, Champa.

288
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,280
[BULMA]
Good luck, boys! Do your best!

289
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,550
Okay!

00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:35,250
[SUPREME KAI]
Hello, Goku.

291
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,150
It's been far too long.

292
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,490
Hey. You guys have
your own bodies again,

293
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,860
but I thought once you fused
together you couldn't go back.

294
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,120
That's normally true,

295
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,030
and as much as we hate
relying on their power,

296
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,730
we asked the Namekians
to separate us

297
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,160
using their Dragon Balls.

298
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,300
We tried to make do,
but after a while

299
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,700
we just couldn't bear it.

300
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,530
Oh, so that's why
I couldn't find your energy.

301
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,470
I was still looking for
the two of you together.

302
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,710
What's up, Kibito?
It's good to see ya again!

303
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,170
Good to see you too, Goku.

304
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,580
When we heard about these
matches we couldn't resist!

305

[GOKU]
And how are you, old-timer?

306
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,380
Staying busy?

307
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,550
Oh, you bet. Mostly just
watching beetle wrestling

308
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,520
and keeping up with
my favorite magazines.

309

You know I nearly
had an aneurysm

310
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,750
watching your battle
with Beerus.

311

[GOKU chuckles]
Yeah.

469
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,960
The tournament I was excited for
is officially under way!

470
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,010
And leave it to that tricky Champa to
recruit a fighter whose moves I can't see coming!

471
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:49,880
And he doesn't seem fazed
by any of my attacks, either!

472
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,510
I could really be in a jam.

473
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:53,600
Oh well! You know how I like to fight!

474
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,470
When things aren't going my way,
it's time to level up!

475
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,730
Next time on Dragon Ball Super:

476
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:04,150
Make sure you don't miss it, okay?
