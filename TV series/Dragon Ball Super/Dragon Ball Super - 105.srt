prepared to defend.

00:08:52,063 --> 00:08:55,608
But, my mystical technique is
all about sewing uncertainty,

164
00:08:55,692 --> 00:08:59,821
with 76 talismans to strike
and 129 to confuse.

165
00:08:59,904 --> 00:09:03,033
Think you can tell
the difference, old man?

[ROSHI panting]

167
00:09:06,369 --> 00:09:08,788
[ROSHI]
It's another illusion.

168
00:09:19,382 --> 00:09:21,926
Now, where'd she disappear to?

169
00:09:25,597 --> 00:09:26,890
What the...?

[ROSHI groans]

[DERCORI]
I've got you now.

172
00:09:39,444 --> 00:09:41,821
Is that the real her
or just a decoy?

173
00:09:41,905 --> 00:09:42,906
Hm?

174
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,202
As you can see, I've
pinned down your shadow.

175
00:09:47,285 --> 00:09:50,455
Now you're stuck there,
unable to move from that spot.

My world is a very dark place

178
00:09:54,626 --> 00:09:56,836
that light barely reaches.

179
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,256
I don't do so well
in bright locales.

180
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:06,012
But on the other hand, get me in
the dark and I am unstoppable!

181
00:10:06,096 --> 00:10:08,640
Oh, great. On top
of the illusions,

182

now she's powering up?

183
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:13,687
You'll never lay
a finger on me now!

184
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:16,981
You're probably right.
But lucky for me,

185
00:10:17,065 --> 00:10:19,984
I'm the perfect guy to
deal with your nonsense.

190
00:10:29,869 --> 00:10:32,330
Problem is, they're
a little too earnest

191
00:10:32,414 --> 00:10:34,499
when it comes to doing battle.

192
00:10:34,582 --> 00:10:38,294
They tend to get tripped up
by opponents who fight dirty.

193
00:10:39,045 --> 00:10:41,881
[ROSHI] Fortunately,
they have me to handle

on all manner of trickery.

There. That's two down now.

Yeah, that's what I
like to see, old man!

203
00:11:24,049 --> 00:11:27,552
Why not seal the rest of the
competition while you're at it?

204

Hey, that's no fair!

205
00:11:29,846 --> 00:11:31,348
Just what is your deal?

206
00:11:31,431 --> 00:11:34,601
They explicitly said no bringing
outside equipment into the ring!

207
00:11:34,684 --> 00:11:35,935
If that gadget's allowed,

208
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:38,313
then why not restoratives
and poison needles, too?

209
00:11:38,396 --> 00:11:40,648
I didn't hear you raising
a stink when your fighter

started using
talismans as weapons!

211

That's just energy
shaped like talismans!

00:11:45,028 --> 00:11:46,696
So it's completely
on the up and up!

213
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,074
Well, my guy's attack
is energy-based, too!

214
00:11:49,157 --> 00:11:52,452
The jar's just an accessory!
So it's on the up and up!

00:11:52,535 --> 00:11:53,578
It's cheating!

It is fun, so I say
it is allowed.

it might've worked on me.

322
00:17:24,325 --> 00:17:25,243
What in the...?

323
00:17:25,326 --> 00:17:28,538
[ROSHI groans]

324
00:17:28,621 --> 00:17:29,956
[KRILLIN gasps]

325
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,876
Well, he lasted longer
than I thought he would.

326
00:17:32,959 --> 00:17:36,212
He's an inspiration to feeble
old codgers everywhere.

327
00:17:36,296 --> 00:17:38,131
[ROSHI groans]

328
00:17:42,218 --> 00:17:44,304
[panting]

329
00:17:46,306 --> 00:17:47,974
I can imagine you must have been

330
00:17:48,058 --> 00:17:50,977
a pretty decent fighter
in your time.

331
00:17:51,061 --> 00:17:55,690
But unfortunately for you,
that time has come and gone!

332
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:58,651
[ROSHI groaning]

333
00:17:58,735 --> 00:18:02,781
Still trying to get back up?
Stop embarrassing yourself!

334
00:18:02,864 --> 00:18:07,619
Just accept your limitations and
ease gracefully into retirement!

335
00:18:07,702 --> 00:18:12,123
My limitations--
can go straight to hell!

336
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,584
No! Don't do it, Master Roshi!

337
00:18:14,668 --> 00:18:17,003
Yeah, don't push too hard!

338
00:18:17,587 --> 00:18:20,006
[ROSHI]
Goku... Krillin...

339
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,841
You're the ones who
showed this ol' fossil

340
00:18:21,925 --> 00:18:23,718
he still had something
left to give.

341
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,637
That it was too soon
to let the limits

342
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,599
of age sentence him to sit
idly by on the sidelines.

343
00:18:29,683 --> 00:18:31,768
You boys, who were
never content to stop,

344
00:18:31,851 --> 00:18:34,896
who kept aiming for and climbing
greater and greater heights,

345
00:18:34,979 --> 00:18:37,399
want me to take it easy?

346
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:41,277
Oh no you don't!

347
00:18:41,361 --> 00:18:43,863
[ROSHI yelling]

348
00:18:43,947 --> 00:18:46,282
[GANOS]
Come on, just go down already!

349
00:18:46,366 --> 00:18:48,118
Now listen to me, boys!

350
00:18:48,201 --> 00:18:48,993
[BOTH gasp]

351
00:18:49,077 --> 00:18:50,829
Always remember these words:

352
00:18:50,912 --> 00:18:53,873
work hard, study well,
and eat and sleep plenty!

353
00:18:53,957 --> 00:18:56,209
That is the Turtle Hermit way!

354
00:18:56,292 --> 00:19:00,463
We must master the art of peace
in addition to the art of war!

355
00:19:00,547 --> 00:19:02,257
Shut up and fight!

356
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:06,094
[ROSHI] The Turtle Hermit School
will be with you... always!

357
00:19:06,177 --> 00:19:11,683
This will be my greatest,
most powerful Kamehame-Ha!

358
00:19:13,435 --> 00:19:14,477
[GANOS grunts]

359
00:19:25,196 --> 00:19:27,907
Oh, come on, Ganos!
Not you, too?!

360
00:19:27,991 --> 00:19:30,243
I knew you could do it,
you old coot!

361
00:19:30,326 --> 00:19:33,455
Hold on, that's no old coot--
that's Master Roshi!

362
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:34,539
[SUPREME KAI gasps]

363
00:19:34,622 --> 00:19:35,915
[KRILLIN gasping]

364
00:19:49,763 --> 00:19:51,389
Master Roshi, no!

365
00:19:51,473 --> 00:19:52,640
Wait, you can't do that!

366
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:54,184
You aren't allowed to
go back in the ring!

367
00:19:54,267 --> 00:19:56,353
Goku, please!

368
00:19:56,436 --> 00:19:57,771
Roshi!

369
00:19:57,854 --> 00:20:01,107
Hang on, we're in the middle
of something here!

370
00:20:01,191 --> 00:20:03,151
Outta my way!

371
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,321
Master!

372
00:20:08,198 --> 00:20:09,824
Master Roshi!

373
00:20:15,246 --> 00:20:19,501
C'mon, wake up!
You've got to get up, Roshi!

374
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:21,628
Please, Master Roshi, wake up.

375
00:20:21,711 --> 00:20:25,590
Wake up! Wake up!

376
00:20:25,674 --> 00:20:27,842
Come on, Goku!

377
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:31,638
You can do it.
Wake up for me, please!

378
00:20:50,865 --> 00:20:52,867
Master Roshi...?

379
00:20:53,743 --> 00:20:54,619
[coughs]

380
00:20:54,703 --> 00:20:55,787
[GOKU, KRILLIN gasp]

381
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,038
[ROSHI coughing]

382
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:59,833
[GOKU]
It worked! You're alive again!

383
00:21:01,751 --> 00:21:05,380
Hey, where'd all those
spunky little angels fly off to?

384
00:21:05,463 --> 00:21:07,424
Oh, Master Roshi!

385
00:21:07,507 --> 00:21:09,634
Oh, Master Roshi, you're okay!

386
00:21:09,718 --> 00:21:11,428
[GOKU]
Thank goodness...

387
00:21:12,595 --> 00:21:16,891
[ROSHI] That's enough now.
The fight ain't over yet.

388
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:19,644
Get up and lend me
your shoulder, boy.

389
00:21:19,728 --> 00:21:21,312
[GOKU sniffles]

390
00:21:21,396 --> 00:21:22,939
[laughs]

391
00:21:23,023 --> 00:21:26,526
[KRILLIN exhales]
Oh, what a relief.

392
00:21:26,609 --> 00:21:27,444
[BEERUS]
Hey, Curly.

393
00:21:27,527 --> 00:21:28,987
Yes, sir?

394
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:32,991
That old fossil. Just what did
you say his name was again?

395
00:21:33,074 --> 00:21:34,868
[GOKU]
Man, I really thought

396
00:21:34,951 --> 00:21:36,411
you'd crossed over
to Other World.

397
00:21:36,494 --> 00:21:39,122
[ROSHI laughs]
I did!

398
00:21:39,205 --> 00:21:41,708
There were cute, spunky
angels everywhere!

399
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,418
Far as the eye could see!

400
00:21:43,501 --> 00:21:45,754
[GOKU chuckles] You sure
you weren't just dreaming?

401
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:47,088
[ROSHI]
Well...

402
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:48,965
[ROSHI, GOKU laugh]

403
00:21:49,632 --> 00:21:53,511
[NARRATOR] And so, Master Roshi
overcame his own limitations,

404
00:21:53,595 --> 00:21:54,888
and pressed on.

405
00:21:54,971 --> 00:21:56,931
Thirty-four minutes remain until

406
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:59,809
the Tournament of Power
comes to an end.

407
00:21:59,893 --> 00:22:02,937
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super!

408
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:07,233

422
00:23:05,792 --> 00:23:07,168
[GOKU]
Hey! It's me, Goku!

423
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:08,795
So there's a
crackerjack marksman

424
00:23:08,878 --> 00:23:10,422
from Universe Two
who's after us,

425
00:23:10,505 --> 00:23:13,425
and his aim seems to find us
no matter where we hide!

426
00:23:13,508 --> 00:23:15,593
There's a flurry of attacks
and even I can't tell

427
00:23:15,677 --> 00:23:17,053
where they're coming from!

428
00:23:17,137 --> 00:23:18,263
If this keeps up,

429
00:23:18,346 --> 00:23:20,473
we're in serious danger
of being taken out!

430
00:23:20,557 --> 00:23:21,975
Vegeta! Tien!

431
00:23:22,058 --> 00:23:24,769
We've got a make-or-break
fight ahead of us here!

432
00:23:24,853 --> 00:23:27,105
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

433
00:23:27,188 --> 00:23:29,899
"Find them Out! Deathmatch
with a Furtive Attacker!"

434
00:23:29,983 --> 00:23:30,984
Whatever that means...

435
00:23:31,067 --> 00:23:32,652
Make sure you don't
miss it, okay?
