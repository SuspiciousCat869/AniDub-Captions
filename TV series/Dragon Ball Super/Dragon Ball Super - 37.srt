00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,740
Don't you wanna dream again?

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,920
Now it's calling for me go back to the start

3
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,910
Wishing on the starlight

4
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,770
In the sky, let's paint a door for tomorrow

5
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,550
Just step on the new stage don't be shy

6
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,510
Gonna take the challenge of God

Let's! Go! Go! Big panic

9
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:50,990
I don't care 'bout limits, no regret

10
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:56,540
Make me tougher even though I lose

00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,440
Nothing gonna stop me no mo' try me

[MAGETTA]
Clack-hiss!

17
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,250
[NARRATOR] Previously,
on Dragon Ball Super,

18
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:35,020
the battle between Vegeta
and the Metalman fighter

19
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,820
Magetta was getting intense.

20
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,690
The barrier
surrounding the ring

21
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,900
caused extreme heat
and a lack of oxygen.

22
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,960
Both of these
conditions combined

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,230
to inhibit Vegeta's
usually reliable strength,

24
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,700
putting him in danger of losing.

25
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,740
[VEGETA bellows]

26
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,710
[NARRATOR] But then,
using his powerful energy,

27
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,720
Vegeta shattered the barrier...

28
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,750
Because you're finished,
you pathetic pile of junk!

29
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,020
[MAGETTA]
Chicka-chicka-klunk?

30
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,060
[NARRATOR] ...and roared
back from the brink

31
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,590
with a match-winning attack.

32
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:23,640
[TD REF] Contestant Vegeta
wins the match!

33
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,040
[NARRATOR] After triumphing
over the daunting obstacles,

34
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,940
Vegeta faces off against
his next opponent,

35
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,010
the Sixth Universe's
own Saiyan. Now!

36
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,980
Now it's my turn to fight.

37
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,330
Wow, Vegeta. You really
did quite a number

38
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,670
on that ring, didn't ya?
There's no way they could

39
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,010
start the next match
with it looking like this.

40
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,770
I'm fine.

41
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,610
Come on, Dad, keep going
and take out the rest of 'em!

42
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,480
Yeah, that's what
I was planning to do.

43
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,750
Now, now, Trunks,
let's calm down.

44
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,750
And remember, you've still
got Goku as backup,

45
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,390
so there's no need
to overdo it. You got it?

46
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,660
Great advice. Will you
please go sit down?

47
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,390
[TRUNKS]
Aw, man.

48
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,030
[OOLONG] Mmm, now that is some
mighty good watermelon!

49
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,660
Knock it off!

50
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,570
[ALL]
Huh?

51
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,700
[GOKU, BULMA, TRUNKS]
Huh?

52
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,740
My brother's always
had a short temper.

53
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,340
He's really a colossal hothead.

54
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,670
What did you just call me?

55
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,840
You get fired up
over the smallest things!

56
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,610
Thanks to you, this arena's
become a sweltering hot house!

57
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,580
Do us a favor and heat the road!

58
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,450
Oh, spare me your
stone-cold wordplay!

59
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,580
You're too hot!

60
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,820
You're too cold!

61
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:49,020
--[BEERUS] Too hot!
--[CHAMPA] Too cold!

62
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:49,890
[BEERUS]
Then how 'bout we get moving

63
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,760
and really warm things up?

64
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,490
[CHAMPA] All right,
go ahead! Bring it on!

65
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,300
[ALL gasp]

66
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,440
[BOTH grunt]

67
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,640
[WHIS, VADOS]
Pardon us, sirs,

68
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,970
but the repairs
are now complete.

69
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,540
[BOTH]
Oh. Heh.

70
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,750
[WHIS] We've totally
refurnished the ring.

71
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,750
[BEERUS]
As speedy as ever, I see.

72
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,650
Wow, that is awesome!

73
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,950
[VADOS] The vigorous
competition can resume at once.

74
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:21,390
Also, we thought limiting
out-of-bounds losses

75
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,360
would make for a more
exciting tournament,

76
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,820
so we extended the ring.

77
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,260
[WHIS]
Now, your lordships,

78
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,460
there is one more
matter to address.

79
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,830
What shall we do about
the midair out-of-bounds rule?

80
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,530
[BEERUS]
I say we get rid of it!

81
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,970
You don't mind, do you?

82
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,640
[CHAMPA] No, I don't care.
Makes no difference to me.

83
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,370
[BEERUS] You two
weren't messing around.

84
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:40,970
Look at the size of this place.

85
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,840
[CHAMPA] Enough yammering.
Let's get started!

86
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,340
[WHIS, VADOS]
Of course, Lord Champa.

87
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,270
Now, our next challenger
for Contestant Vegeta,

88
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:16,480
Universe Six's...
Contestant Cabba!

89
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,880
The fresh-faced Saiyan
from the Sixth Universe

90
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,910
versus the tough-as-nails
Saiyan from the Seventh!

91
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:25,450
Which Saiyan will be left
standing when it's all over?

92
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,890
Whoa, hold on, that
little guy's a Saiyan, too?

93
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,390
Hey Puar, he kinda
reminds me of Goku

94
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,790
when we first met him, huh?

95
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,930
You're right.
I totally see it!

96
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,330
[YAMCHA] 'Cept this kid
doesn't have a tail.

97
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,700
Oh, yeah. Good point.

98
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,260
I guess someone could've
snipped his off

99
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,330
like we did to Goku, remember?

100
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,500
Like it was yesterday!

101
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,370
I get the sense that
whippersnapper's a nice,

102
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,540
upstanding young man.
Wouldn't you say?

103
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,440
Indeed. Their Saiyans
must have evolved

104
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,740
along a completely
different path than ours.

105
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,550
I should say so.

106
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,380
Our Saiyans are what you
might call heroes of justice.

107
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,720
They are true
mercenaries of goodness.

108
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,720
What?

109
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,490
See, the Saiyans
in our universe

110
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,320
are based on a planet
known as Sadla.

111
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,430
However, they're hired
to battle bad guys

112
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,290
and defend other worlds
from the forces of evil.

113
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:10,930
--[laughs]
--So, what!

114
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,430
Our Saiyans do a damn
fine job protecting Earth

115
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,900
and they do it for free!

116
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,970
[BOTH laugh]

117
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,900
Are you telling me
Saiyans actually

118
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,910
work for a living over there?

119
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,110
[CHICHI] That's not fair!
How come we got stuck with

120

the deadbeat Saiyans?
We got dupped!

121
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,620
So, it seems you're going
to be my next opponent.

122
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,150

Yes.

No holding back here.
You give it your all.

Right, I intend to.

Goku, do you think
that kid has the ability

127
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,210
to turn Super Saiyan
the way you and Vegeta can?

all right. That's for sure.

00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,710
Are you actually telling me you
can't even turn Super Saiyan?

160
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,540
Well?

161
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:47,610
I'm begging you.
Vegeta, sir. Teach me.

162
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:50,750
Teach me how to transform
like you do.

163
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,050
Please, I beseech you.

164
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,990
[CABBA] On behalf of my family
waiting for me back on Sadla.

165
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,630
I want to become
stronger so I can

166
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,160
bring true peace
to our universe.

167
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,670
--[grunts]
--I beg you.

168
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,830
[VEGETA] Kid, in case
you haven't noticed,

169
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,940
we're in the middle
of a fight here!

170
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,070
Show me how.
It would mean so much.

171
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:16,540
[VEGETA] Oh, would it?
You disappoint me.

172
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:21,010
Asking your opponent for a
lesson in the midst of battle?

173
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,180
What the heck's
he doing out there?

174
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,680
Huh...

175
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,890
--See that?
--Yeah.

176
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,660
[VEGETA] It's shameful.
You're a disgrace.

177
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:40,100
[VEGETA]
Yet you dare...

178
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,470
Aah!

179
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:46,140
...call yourself a Saiyan!

180
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,270
[yells]

181
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:02,620
[CABBA yells]

182
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,920
I'm not done with you yet!

183
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:09,790
I don't understand this.
What has gotten into him?

184
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,700
Oh no. This looks bad.

185
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:14,670
I hope Vegeta isn't going back
to the dark side now.

186
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,800
[chuckles]

187
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:22,210
Given your extremely
limited abilities

188
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,180
I'm surprised they even
let you compete!

189
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:26,950
Dad, why are you
being so mean?

190
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,650
--He wouldn't.
--He would.

191
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,480
I sure hope Vegeta
hasn't forgotten that

192
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,150
killing your opponent
means you forfeit the match.

193
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:37,490
Well, it's possible.

194
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,830
[yells]

195
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,760
I...

196
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,130
I give up.

197
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:56,210
Now listen.
If you quit on me...

198
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,810
...I will kill you!

199
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,820
But the rules...

200
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:11,820
[VEGETA grunts]
Enough. I'm ending this now.

201
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,830
And once the fight is over,
I'm going to blow your stupid

202
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,960
Planet Sadla to smithereens!

203
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,130
[VEGETA] Though first, I'm going
to hunt down and murder,

204
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:27,870
one by one, every last
member of your family!

205
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:31,510
For them, it won't be quick.

206
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,610
[gasps]

207
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:40,520
[CABBA] The people
of Sadla are innocent.

208
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:46,570
They have nothing...
to do with this.

209
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:02,390
If you do anything
to my home planet,

210
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,800
or anything to my family...

211
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:13,170
...I will make you pay!

212
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,340
[BOTH gasp]

213
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,210
--[BEERUS] Ooh.
--[CHAMPA chuckles]

214
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:24,010
You will suffer, Vegeta!
That much I can promise you!

215
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,020
You bastard!

216
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,030
[CABBA bellows]

217
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:52,910

[ALL gasp]

229
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,240
Oh, no!

230
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,010
[yells]

231
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,610
Move Vegeta, why are you
just standing there?

232
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:05,080
[CABBA yells]

233
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,060
[CHAMPA]
Hm!

234
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:13,220
[BEERUS]
Hmmm...

235
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,930
[GOKU]
Wow!

236
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,300
All right, that'll do.

237
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,870
[VEGETA]
Don't forget that sensation.

238
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,370
You mean...

239
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,350
The best trigger for the Super
Saiyan transformation is anger.

240
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,410
So, hold on to that
feeling you just had.

241
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:40,580
Uh. Right.

242
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:45,060
Good, now try it again.
Turn to a Super Saiyan.

243
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:46,820
[CABBA]
Uh...

244
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,990
What are you waiting for?
I said turn!

245
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,730
Don't make me say it again!

246
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:52,700
Yes. Okay!

247
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:59,540
[CABBA yells]

248
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,440
Well, look at that--
you're a quick learner.

249
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:08,750
So, the reason you said
all those terrible things to me

250
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,250
was just to teach me
how to transform like this?

251
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:12,820
Is that it?

252
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,860
So, that's what Dad was up to!

253
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,760
Good ol' Vegeta!

254
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,460
Other people may have
doubted him, but hey, not me.

255
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,590
[PUAR]
Uh-huh.

256
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,800
[BULMA, TRUNKS]
What? Hey, that's not true!

257
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,730
[laughs nervously]

258
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,470
Are you all right?

259
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,500
So, all that time,
Vegeta was just training him?

260
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,240
--It would appear so.
--What a waste!

261
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:34,370
What a waste!

262
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,880
[BOTH grunt]

263
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,500
You're blue?

264
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:07,510
First, we called it a
"god" power, but not anymore.

265
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,340
Whoa. That looks
really powerful.

266
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,250
We decided
it needs a new name.

267
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,450
And if you keep training,

268
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,420
you too can reach
this Super Saiyan Blue.

269
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:19,290
You're telling me...

270
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,560
...I could do that, too?

271
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:31,830
[VEGETA] Remember this pain.
And let it activate you.

272
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:38,170
Contestant Cabba!
Can you hear me, sir?

273
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:40,340
Oh yeah, this guy is out cold.

274
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,710
Cabba loses the match by K.O.!

275
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:48,650
Making Vegeta the winner!

276
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,780
Ah, way to go! Yeah!

277
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,190
[PICCOLO chuckles]

278
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,790
Very impressive. Vegeta just
won three times in a row.

279
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,260
[BEERUS laughs]
Yes, and just like that,

280
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:59,660
my team suddenly has
the upper hand here!

281
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,260
[CHAMPA growls]

282
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,500
Lord Champa, please be mindful
of your blood pressure.

283
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,970
Shut your mouth!

284
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:13,610
[CABBA coughs]

285
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:18,450
Oh, Vegeta.
Thank you. Sincerely.

286
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,680
[VEGETA] There was a moment
in the middle of combat

287
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,250
when you actually
said you gave up.

288
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:28,760
Surrender is an outcome
far worse than defeat.

289
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:31,590
I won't tolerate that kind of
weak behavior from a Saiyan!

290
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:34,290
Right. I'm so sorry.

291
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:35,930
Never forget
what you are, damn it!

292
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,860
Where is your Saiyan pride?

293
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,840
My Saiyan pride?
What does that mean?

294
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,770
It means strength.

295
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:47,470
Oh. Well, then, I'll try
to make myself stronger,

296
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,340
just like you!

297
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,280
Um, not to presume.

298
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,620
Set your sights higher!

299
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,450
You got it!

300
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:08,500
Not that I would ever
let you surpass me.

301
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:10,530
Of course!

302
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:14,400
[VEGETA]
Hm!

303
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,640
[CABBA] You know, the King
of Planet Sadla is a proud,

304
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:21,340
strong man, much like yourself.

305
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,340
In fact, you remind me of him.

306
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:27,210
[VEGETA] That so? You'll have
to introduce us sometime.

307
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,950
[CABBA]
Will do!

308
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,150
Can you believe it?
Vegeta giving lessons

309
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,260
to somebody out of
the goodness of his heart?

310
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:36,920
Well, he is
a prince, after all.

311
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,430
Imagine he must miss having
his fellow Saiyans around,

312
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:43,230
so that's why he embraced
the opportunity to train one.

313
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:45,430
In body and in mind.

314
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:48,200
Hey, wait, I'm a Saiyan,
he's got me around.

315
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,600
I'm not sure you have
the same appeal, Goku.

316
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,410
Well, I should hope I do!
I certainly like him just fine.

317
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,770
And that's probably
one of the things

318
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,710
that annoys him most about you.

319
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,280
Huh? Whadda ya mean,
"one of the things"?

320
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,880
[PICCOLO chuckles]

321
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:04,950
Our next challenge,
taking on the victorious

322
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:07,420
Contestant Vegeta,
is the final competitor

323
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,760
from the Sixth Universe.

324
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:13,430
The one and only,
Contestant Hit.

325
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,900
My, we only have
one fighter left.

326
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,500
That is a tad concerning.

327
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:25,770
Yes, but our last guy is Hit.
So, no need to worry.

328
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:28,740
After all, he's the best
our universe has to offer.

329
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,240
The legendary assassin Hit.

330
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,180
Though given his stature,
I'm surprised he even agreed

331
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,950
to participate
in this tournament.

332
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,250
Well, I think it might
have something to do

333
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:41,320
with the fact I promised him
a hexahedron if he should win.

334
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,760
Augh! You promised him
one of those?

335
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:44,930
I did.

336
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,460
[CHAMPA] But it's supposed
to be a chariot of the gods!

337
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,460
If he gets a hexahedron,
he'll be able to go

338
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,900
anywhere he pleases,
including other universes!

339
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,270
[VADOS] Yes, I am aware
of that, Lord Champa,

340
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,770
but you told me that I should
persuade Hit to compete

341
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:00,340
using any means necessary.
Did you not?

342
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,440
I may have said that, sure.

343
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,840
But come on, an assassin
who can move at high speeds

344
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,550
and never be caught?
Sounds like trouble.

345
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,580
Shall I rescind
the offer, sir?

346
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:13,250
No, no, no. It's too late
to do that now.

347
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:16,360
Anyway, if that's
what Hit is fighting for,

348
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:19,630
I'd say we're all
but guaranteed a victory.

349
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,300
Whoa–oa

350
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:49,660
Whoa–oa

351
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:49,660
Whoa–oa

352
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:52,790
It's hard to say - don't wanna stay

353
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,300
I twist and fight, can't find my way

354
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:59,000
I must believe, that fear and trouble

355
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:02,500
can even be fun if you think the right way

356
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,990
Whoa–oa

357
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,140
Whoa–oa

358
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,140
Whoa

359
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:12,500
I don't wanna draw the line, I gotta see it through some way

360
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:16,000
Fight for what I know is mine, the dream I had of me that day

361
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,130
Whoa–o-oa

362
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,230
Whoa–o-oa

363
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,300
Whoa–oa–oa

364
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:24,200
Don't care if they call me greedy,

365
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,800
If they ever make it make it through,

366
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:27,240
Don't care if they laugh at me,

367
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,100
cus' I will make the dream come true

368
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:32,090
Whoa–oa

369
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:36,000
Whoa–oa

370
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:36,000
Whoa–oa–oa

371
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,290
Hey, it's me, Goku!

372
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:42,960
Finally we get to see this mystery man fight!

373
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,340
I've been watching him, and I can just tell:
he's not your average fighter.

374
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,170
There's no fooling these eyes.

375
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:51,890
Whoa, I totally missed that move he just did,
and I'm not the only one!

376
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:56,060
Vegeta, Piccolo, everyone else—
none of us can figure out how he's fighting!

377
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,480
Next time on Dragon Ball Super:

378
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,320
Make sure you don't miss it, okay?
