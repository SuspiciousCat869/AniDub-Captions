155
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,625
In a battle royale as big
as this, we'll be surrounded

156
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:16,000
at all times by friend
and foe alike.

157
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,500
I'm looking at everyone's powers
and how they handle themselves

158
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,458
so I can make our team strategy.

159
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:23,666
It's okay, I understand.
A battle royal is tricky.

160
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,375
To be honest, I'm pretty
nervous about this setup, too.

161
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,666
[laughing]

162
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,833
Aah!

163
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:44,500
[KRILLIN yells]

164
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,583
[GOHAN] From what I've
always seen of Krillin,

165
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,000
I doubt he'll
help our team much.

166
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,375
But Dad must want him
for a reason,

167
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,583
so I need to find out
for myself.

168
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:57,458
I told Gohan how great Krillin
is now that he's training again.

169
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,291
You still haven't
told me everything.

170
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:00,458
[GOKU]
Uh?

171
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,375
I can see the serious look
in Gohan's eyes.

172
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,375
This is for more than
just bragging rights!

173
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,500
What? Nah, Gohan's
just eager to win

174
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,000
his hundred million zeni.

175
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,958
A few minutes ago,
you said ten million.

176
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,708
Where'd the extra
zero come from?

177
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:12,750
Uuh!

178
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,708
[A18 grunts]

179
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:17,458
Oh, look! The guys are just
about ready to start fighting.

180
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:18,708
Come on, Krillin!

181
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,083
Let's see your new
training in action! Ha-ha!

182
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,708
Are you sure you're
supposed to root against

183
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,875
your own son like that,
Uncle Goku?

184
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,000
Uh!

185
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,333
Oh, yeah. Go, Gohan. Woo!

186
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,833
[KRILLIN]
All right!

187
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:35,208
[KRILLIN]
Gohan! Ready when you are!

188
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,458
I'm eager to see
what you can pull off!

189
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:40,208
You know, I've been thinking
about this, Gohan.

190
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:43,250
This tournament won't be
an anything-goes killing spree.

191
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:46,166
There's gonna be a lot
of limits on what we can do.

192
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,291
Yeah, I'm well aware.

193
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,458
[KRILLIN] I'm not sure
you fully appreciate

194
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,791
what that means, Gohan.

195
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,458
[MARRON]
Good luck, Daddy!

196
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,583
Go get him, okay!

197
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,083
[KRILLIN]
You're easily distracted!

198
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,583
--[GOHAN] Huh?
--[KRILLIN grunts]

199
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,083
It's not much of
a test if you're gonna

200
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:21,208
pull your punches, Gohan!

201
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,375
[KRILLIN yells]

202
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,833
[BOTH gasp]

203
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:34,541
[KRILLIN]
Solar Flare!

204
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,666
[KRILLIN]
I'm not done yet!

205
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:43,500
[yelling]

206
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,833
Wow, that's bright!

207
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:47,208
[groaning]

208
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,541
Impressive.
Is this a new technique?

209
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:53,166
--Want these?
--Yeah. Thank you.

210
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:57,875
[GOHAN] Even with my eyes
closed it's blinding.

211
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:00,000
I can't even sense his energy.

212
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,541
Where'd he go? Aw, man.

213
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:04,625
[GOHAN groans]

214
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,291
[KRILLIN]
Down you go!

215
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:11,000
[KRILLIN laughing]
That's a ring out!

216
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:16,666
I call that one the
"Hundred Times Solar Flare."

217
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,958
So you've multiplied it.
It overwhelmed my senses.

218
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:24,083
That's an amazing technique.

219
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:27,250
Well done, Krillin. This has
certainly been educational.

220
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,625
I got some other new
techniques up my sleeve,

221
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,958
but I'd rather keep them
a surprise for now.

222
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,375
Yay! Daddy won the round!

223
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:37,041
Well, I guess spending all that
money on a fancy home gym

224
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,708
was worth it after all.

225
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:41,041
Okay, Marron, that's enough
fighting for one day.

226
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,875
It's time for us to go home.

227
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,250
--[MARRON giggles]
--I like what I see, Krillin.

228
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,416
[gasps]

229
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,666
Now it's my turn to push you.

230
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,500
[GOKU chuckles]

231
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,458
Well, Krillin, ya beat me
fair and square.

232
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,833
[KRILLIN] Sorry for
literally blindsiding you,

233
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:10,375
but I'm glad I passed your test.

234
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:13,333
You weren't expecting that
from me, were ya?

235
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:15,916
--[KRILLIN] Gohan.
--[GOHAN gasps]

236
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,375
Let's push each other
and get better together.

237
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:20,875
With a little creativity
and a lot of hard work,

238
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,083
we can make all our moves
a hundred times stronger,

239
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,458
and win the Tournament of Power.

240
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,708
With my fighting
experience and moves,

241
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:31,500
and your strength,
we'll be sitting pretty!

242
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:36,750
That's a good point.
I really do lack experience.

243
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,250
Thanks again, Krillin.

244
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,125
[KRILLIN]
Hey, don't mention it.

245
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,291
[KRILLIN]
All right, Goku!

246
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:46,125
Now that I've passed, I guess
that makes this official.

247
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:48,333
I can't wait to fight!

248
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,916
[GOKU]
You don't have to wait at all.

249
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Huh?

250
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,125
What say we take this
somewhere else

251
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,583
and have our own battle.

252
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,458
I want in on the fun,
too, ya know.

253
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:56,958
[chuckles]

254
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,583
You got it.
[chuckles]

255
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,291
[GOKU]
Mr. Satan said we can fight

256
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:10,916
as hard as we want up here.

257
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,458
[KRILLIN]
Sounds good.

258
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:21,875
[thunder rumbling]

259
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:28,333
[GOHAN] Dad, wait! Don't use up
all your energy now

260
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,666
when the tournament starts
in just a couple days.

261
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,208
I know, don't worry about it.

262
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:33,791
If I think you're
taking this too far,

263
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,333
I'm stopping the match.

264
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:36,416
[GOKU]
Got it.

265
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,083
[KRILLIN]
Do the same thing for me.

266
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,041
[A18]
Guys, hold on.

267
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:43,333
Krillin hasn't recovered yet
from his fight with Gohan.

268
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,541
Can't this wait at least
a couple hours?

269
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,208
--[KRILLIN] No, it can't.
--Huh?

270
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,583
You wanted me to
put my training to use.

271
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,166
[A18]
But this is too much.

272
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,750
Goku just saw you use
an ambush attack.

273
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:56,333
You're not getting away
with it a second time.

274
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:57,708
Do I really need to remind you

275
00:12:57,791 --> 00:13:00,166
who you're about
to go up against?

276
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:04,041
Oh, yeah, I know.

277
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,625
More than you ever could.

278
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,833
Mama, is Uncle Goku
gonna hurt Daddy?

279
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,125
Daddy's gonna do just fine.

280
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,541
C'mon, Gohan, can't you
talk him out of this?

281
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,708
He's not gonna listen to me.

282
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,958
I mean, you're a
fighter, too, 18.

283
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,000
You understand, right?

284
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,583
Of course, I understand!

285
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:26,000
I just don't enjoy having
to see my husband depressed

286
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,083
after learning
how outmatched he is!

287
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:31,500
[MARRON]
Mama. But you said he'd be okay.

288
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:35,291
Uh. Not only will Daddy
be okay, he's gonna win!

289
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:37,833
--Are you sure?!
--Oh, yeah!

290
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,625
Let's go, Krillin!
Don't let him win this!

291
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:44,416
[MARRON]
Good luck, Daddy!

292
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:46,541
[KRILLIN]
We're following the rules for

293
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,333
the Tournament of Power, right?

294
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:49,791
[GOKU]
Right.

295
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,500
[KRILLIN] This reminds me
of our fight way back

296
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:02,166
at the World Martial
Arts Tournament.

297

--[KRILLIN] Goku.
--[GOKU] Hm?

298
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:06,458
[KRILLIN] Promise me that
when we get in the ring

299
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:09,500
you'll fight me as an opponent,
and not as a friend.

300
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:13,333
Oh, yeah, when I fight you,
I'm going all out!

[GOKU, KRILLIN laughing]

302
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,041
I hope that rain's not an omen.

00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,333
Ha!

311
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,625
[GOKU]
You're trying to push me off.

312
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,208
[yells]

313
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,583
Now! Uh!

314
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,250
[GOKU]
Hmm.

315
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,916
Found ya!

316
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,333
Ha! I knew you
were gonna do that.

317
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,125
He's doing better
than I expected.

318
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:52,208
--I'll say.
--Daddy's winning! Yay!

319
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,958
[GOKU]
Okay, what else you got?

320
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,041
Wait a few seconds
and you'll see.

321
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,708
[GOKU]
Hm?

322
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,083
[GOKU]
Uh!

323
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,666
[KRILLIN]
Gah! That was so close!

324
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,250
[GOKU]
How'd you do that?

325
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:07,250
[KRILLIN] Remember when I was
launching those Destructo Discs?

326
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,166
Not all of them
were aiming for you.

327
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,958
Ah! So three of them
distracted me,

328
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,375
while one was cutting a hole.

329
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:13,750
Worked like a charm.

330
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,625
It might be called
the Tournament of Power,

331
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,333
but our wits are gonna be just
as important as our strength.

332
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:20,416
You're right.
Charge in without thinking

333
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,166
and the other fighters
will eliminate you easily.

334
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,750
[KRILLIN grunts]

335
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,291
[chuckles]

336
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:35,541
[yelling]

337
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,708
[grunts]

338
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:41,541
What's your plan, Krillin?
Another Solar Flare?

339
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,458
Whoa. That's Super Saiyan Blue.

340
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,375
I've watched Goku before
when he's gone Blue,

341
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:49,916
but never like this.
Never as his adversary.

342
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,166
He hasn't even made a move

343
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,416
and he's already
got me sweating.

344
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:57,625
There's such a huge gap
between them.

345
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:00,166
I hope Krillin's got something
left up his sleeve.

346
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,166
No, he doesn't.

347
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,250
[A18] One on one,
with that power difference,

348
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,125
there's nothing he can do.

349
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,083
But the tournament's
not like that.

350
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,041
You said it's a
battle royal, right?

351
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,791
[MARRON]
Daddy!

352
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:15,416
Don't give up, Daddy!

353
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,125
Hey, Goku!

354
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,166
I'm havin' a great time.

355
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,875
Same here, pal!

356
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:42,250
[GOKU, KRILLIN] Ka... me...
ha... me...

357
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,208
[GOKU, KRILLIN]
Ha!

358
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:05,166

00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,416
Krillin, are you okay?

363
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:29,083
[panting]

364
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,416
[exhales]

365
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,416
That was awesome.
I can't stop shaking.

366
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:42,833
Honey, why'd you do that?
Why stop the fight?

367
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:44,791
--[A18] I didn't stop it.
--Huh?

368
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,416
I gave you the backup
you needed!

369
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,083
What's your mom doing?

370
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,833
Teamwork! Go Mom!

371
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:54,666
[A18]
Hey, Goku!

372
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,041
We've talked about how
this tournament has rules,

373
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,708
and it's not
just about bulldozing

374
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,500
your opponents with raw power.

375
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:03,541
But there's another aspect
that's just as important.

376
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,791
As a battle royal,
it doesn't have to be about

377
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,083
what you can do all by yourself.

378
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,958
[KRILLIN]
What are you saying, 18?

379
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,708
If you get in trouble
on your own,

380
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,916
we'll fight together as a team.

381
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,500
We could pull off some mean
combos, don't you think?

382
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,541
Oh, yeah!

383
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,625
[BOTH]
Let's go, now!

384
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,000
[KRILLIN]
If you want it to be fair,

385
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:24,250
you can team with Gohan.

386
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:29,791
Nah, I think that's enough.

387
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,375
[BOTH]
Huh?

388
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:34,375
[KRILLIN] Goku!
Are you throwing the match?

389
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:37,500
[GOKU] No, I wouldn't say that.
I can tell I haven't figured out

390
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:40,291
how this tournament
is gonna go down yet.

391
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,208
What if I'd started the match

392
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,541
without even
considering teamwork?

393
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,791
That's kind of scary
to think about.

394
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:50,041
There's clearly a lot
I can learn from you guys.

395
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,666
I see that now.

396
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,791
And there's a lot I can learn
from you too, son.

397
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,416
Thanks, Dad.

398
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:01,291
You know, Krillin. The one
thing I know for sure

399
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,458
is that you're my best friend.

400
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:06,541
I'm counting on you, pal!
And 18, of course!

401
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:07,833
[A18]
Huh?

402
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,666
[chuckles]
You hear that, partner?

403
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,875
[KRILLIN, A18 laugh]

404
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,041
[GOKU chuckles]

405
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,791
Uncle Goku, Uncle Goku!

406
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,833
Because you stopped the fight,
I think that makes

407
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:22,916
Mommy and Daddy
the winners today! [giggles]

408
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,416
Aah! Mmm! Awe...

409
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,541
I think you've got
a point there, Marron.

410
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:31,541
Uncle Goku is a loser, hooray!

411
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:34,708
[GOKU] What? You little stinker!
They didn't defeat me!

412
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,708
[GOHAN]
It's okay, Dad, just go with it.

413
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,291
[GOKU] Look, there's
a big difference between

414
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,500
getting knocked out
and walking away, son!

415
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:41,666
[GOHAN]
All right, all right.

416
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,541
[MARRON]
Mommy and Daddy are the best!

417
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,916
[BOTH laughing]

418
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,541
Oh no, I almost forgot!

419
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,208
Hey, Number 18?

420
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,625
Do you know where
I can find Number 17?

421
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,375
You're kidding me, aren't you?

422
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,250
I mean he's super strong, right?

423
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,541
I never met the guy,
but if he's anything like you,

424
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,208
he'd be great
to have on the team.

425
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,500
[A18] To be honest,
I'm not sure where he is.

426
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:05,791
When we last talked,
he said he was

427
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:08,000
working at an animal sanctuary.

428
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,500
But he didn't give me
an address and I didn't ask,

429
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,250
so he really could be anywhere.

430
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,125
Well, that makes this
tricky then.

431
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,083
Though, I gotta say,
I'm surprised to find out

432
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,791
that 17 loves animals so much.

433
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,041
I was just as surprised
as you are.

434
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:22,541
[KRILLIN]
I have an idea!

435
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,541
Dende keeps an eye
on the whole planet.

436
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:27,208
I bet he knows where
to find Android 17.

437
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,333
Oh, yeah, I forgot about Dende.

438
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:32,916
If there's anyone who can help
find 17, it's gotta be him!

439
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,500
C'mon, gang! We gotta fly!

440

time to find Android 17,

444
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,458
let alone convince him
to join their team?

keeps getting crazier!

467
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:08,500
But getting 17 is a must!

468
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:10,125
The other universes'
guys will have

469
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:11,958
power levels through the roof!

470
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:13,916
We need the best of the best
to have any hope

471
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,250
of defeating someone like Top
and his friend, Jiren!

472
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:19,666
I'm getting more
excited by the hour!

473
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,666
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Super:

474
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:25,125
"The Universes Go Into Action--
Each With Their Own Motives."

475
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:27,041
Make sure you don't
miss it, okay?
