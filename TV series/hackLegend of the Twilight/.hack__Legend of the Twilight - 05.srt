1
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:48,750
[KATSUYUKI] So that's
the answer then.

2
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:49,916
[HAYATO] What is?

3
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,083
[KATSUYUKI] That player
that was able

4
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:52,958
to bring down our monster.

5
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:55,208
[DAISUKE] Really?
How did he do that?

6
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:57,041
[KATSUYUKI]
It was Data Drained.

7
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:58,916
[MICHI] It was Data Drained?

8
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,333
[HAYATO] It's the
ability to rewrite

9
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:02,250
the monster's data
and weaken it.

10
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:04,708
[MICHI] That is
some kind of power.

11
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,958
[KATSUYUKI]
There's only one person

12
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:08,958
in The World that has
that kind of ability...

13
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:12,791
[Katsuyuki
...and that's Kite...

14
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,750
[HAYATO] You mean one of
the legendary dot hackers?

15
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:16,500
[DAISUKE] That name
brings back memories.

16
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:18,875
[KATSUYUKI]
What're we gonna do?

17
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,958
[DAISUKE] We'll just delete our
little problem and it's bye-bye.

18
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,041
[HAYATO] But how?

19
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:23,291
[MICHI] How about this area?

20
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,541
[KATSUYUKI] Cool.

21
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,333
It'll be a cinch if we
can lure him out there.

22
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:27,708
Piece of cake!

23
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,333
[FEMALE giggling]
Catch!

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,500
[SHUGO] Woah! Isn't
the ocean fantastic!

25
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:41,333
[SHUGO] Hey! What
are you doing, man!

26
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:42,458
Ow!

27
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:43,500
[Macho PC] Sorry!

28
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:44,875
Oh, haven't we
met before...?

29
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,416
We must
be connected by

30
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,666
the red thread of fate and
destined to play together...

31
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,958
[Macho PC] Would you like
to form a party with me?

32
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,000
[SHUGO chuckles uncomfortably]

33
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:57,750
[Macho PC] Then, maybe we
could just live together?

34
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,416
[Macho PC laughing]
Just kidding!

35
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,833
[SHUGO] Just give me
back my summer...

36
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:02,791
[RENA] Hey, Shugo!

37
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,666
Sorry to keep you waiting!

38
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,333
[RENA] I bought this suit
in town at the item store.

39
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,250
How do I look?

40
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,041
[SHUGO] Uh... Great!

41
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,416
[MIREILLE] This is a rare
item from my secret cache.

42
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,791
It's a "School Swimsuit."
Whaddya think?

43
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:23,958
[MIREILLE] And Shugo,
Ohka is coming soon too!

44
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,333
[OHKA speaking in a sexy voice]
How do I look, Shugo?

45
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:30,916
[SHUGO sighs]

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,708
[OHKA] Sorry to
keep you waiting!

47
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,250
[SHUGO] Ohka!

48
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,083
Wolf form, huh?

49
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,750
[RENA] What's wrong
with you, Shugo?

50
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:38,750
[SHUGO] Oh, nevermind.

51
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:39,750
[OHKA] He was probably having

52
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,416
some scandalous fantasy.

53
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,666
[SHUGO] Oh, be quiet.

54
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,958
What are you
doing here, anyway?

55
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:44,916
[OHKA] Tracking you down.

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,666
[RENA and SHUGO]
Tracking us?

57
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,250
[RENA] Uh, Sanjuro...

58
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,583
[SHUGO] Sanjuro!

59
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,208
[SANJURO]
Rena... Shugo...

60
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:00,250
There's something
we need to talk about.

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,458
[SHUGO] Huh...?

62
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:21,416
[RENA] Um, is
everything okay?

63
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,833
[SANJURO] This game,
The World... is it fun?

64
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:25,833
[SHUGO] Yeah.

65
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:28,083
[RENA] Yeah, absolutely.

66
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,416
[SANJURO] I see...

67
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,375
But there is one thing
that's been bothering me.

68
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:34,916
Kids your age have so
many other things to do.

69
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,375
[RENA] Huh?

70
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:37,666
[SHUGO] Um...

71
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,083
Whattya trying to say?

72
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,625
[SANJURO] Too much water
drowns the miller, as they say.

73
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:44,958
If you do something in excess,
it is not good for you.

74
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:49,416
[SANJURO] You mean to make
those two quit The World?!

75
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:53,166
Was it not you who spoke that
the Twilight is approaching!

76
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,500
Kite's power...

77
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:57,541
No Shugo's power will
be needed in the conflict.

78
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:00,333
[BALMUNG] You're right.
This is only... a game.

79
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,000
[BALMUNG] The reason
users play this game

80
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,583
is so they can get
together and have fun.

81
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,458
As long as they don't
wish to be involved,

82
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:09,375
I cannot force them
to do our bidding for us.

83
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,166
[SANJURO] And now...?

84
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,916
[BALMUNG] Several players
have recently become involved

85
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,083
in some serious incidents...

86
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,750
that have become unhappy.

87
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,875
[BALMUNG] For some, this is
no longer just entertainment.

88
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,375
And we must not forget,

89
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:23,291
that many of our users are
merely children playing a game.

90
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:24,541
[RENA] I don't understand why

91
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,416
you're saying we have
to quit The World?!

92
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,833
[SANJURO] Not so long ago

93
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,750
a friend of mine became
addicted to this game

94
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:33,083
and sadly he's been shunning
the real world ever since

95
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,083
and now I'm concerned
for you two.

96
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,750
[RENA] We're fine though.

97
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,583
We know the difference
between fantasy and reality.

98
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:41,708
[SHUGO] Yeah!

99
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,250
[SANJURO]
Admirable words my friends,

100
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:44,833
but it may not be a bad idea

101
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,250
to stop playing The World
for at least a little while.

102
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,416
When you return,

103
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,250
I am sure more wondrous
discoveries will await you.

104
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,000
[SHUGO] But in order for me

105
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,458
to make those
wonderful discoveries,

106
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:55,875
I want to become stronger.

107
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,916
You gotta understand,
don't you, Master!

108
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,250
[SANJURO] Huh?

109
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,208
[SHUGO] Master!

110
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,416
[SHUGO] Master?

111
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,208
Teacher, maybe?

112
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:05,083
[SANJURO] Master...

113
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,250
Teacher...

114
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,583
Has a lovely ring to it...

115
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,500
[RENA] Well, whatever
you guys decide on,

116
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,708
there are still
plenty of events to clear

117
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,291
if we're gonna take it
easy for a while.

118
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,750
[SANJURO] Events?

119
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,916
[SHUGO] Yeah, right after
I started playing the game,

120
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,583
this beautiful girl in white

121
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,083
appeared to me
in a strange area...

122
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:27,916
And she gave me
this bracelet.

123
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,458
[AURA] The only one
who can save the world...

124
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:33,250
...that one is you.

125
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,541
[SHUGO] And then she said...

126
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:38,500
I could save
the whole, entire world.

127
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,041
[SANJURO] Aura!

128
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,333
[RENA] After all,
it looks like

129
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,416
we're the dot hacker
characters now.

130
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,583
And it looks like there
are some special events

131
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:46,916
that are connected to us.

132
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,416
[SHUGO]
Yeah, really cools things

133
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,708
that normal players don't
get a chance to experience...

134
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:53,083
like really neat monsters
that never seem to die.

135
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:56,125
[RENA] Yeah, right!

136
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,916
[BALMUNG] As long as they
don't wish to be involved,

137
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,833
I cannot force them to
do our bidding for us.

138
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,250
[SANJURO] If anything
out of the ordinary

139
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,791
happens while you're playing

140
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,375
I'd like you to
contact me immediately.

141
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,958
It doesn't matter how
trivial it may seem.

142
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:14,000
[SANJURO] That also goes for
entering unfamiliar areas.

143
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:17,125
f you sense danger,
don't access for a while.

144
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,166
There's no need to force
yourself to clear an event.

145
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,750
[RENA] But...

146
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:23,041
[Sanjuro The World is designed
to be enjoyed by all players.

147
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:26,291
It's not a place where you
should be risking your life.

148
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,000
[RENA] So when
all is said and

149
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,875
done, what was
he trying to say?

150
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:33,500
[SHUGO] Something like just
play for a few hours a day...

151
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:34,541
I guess.

152
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:37,041
[RENA] Old Sanjuro!

153
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,583
He's so preachy--
I bet that guy

154
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,166
is some kind of school
teacher in real life.

155
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,583
[MICHI crying]

156
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,083
[KATSUYUKI] Can I borrow
this for a while?

157
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,333
[MICHI] Give it back,

158
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,750
that ball is the first
item I've earned here.

159
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,875
[HAYATO] Finders keepers!

160
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,583
[DAISUKE] Well, it's ours now!

161
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:56,666
[RENA] Hey! Knock it off!

162
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,791
[RENA] Cut it out, you guys!

163
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,125
She's just a little girl!

164
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,583
Pick on someone else!

165
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:01,708
[SHUGO] Give 'er back the ball!

166
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,166
[MIREILLE] Hey, hey, hey!

167
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,291
[OHKA] Alright! A fight a fight!

168
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,458
[DAISUKE] Aw! More friends!

169
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:09,458
[KATSUYUKI] You want
the ball so bad?!

170
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,916
[DAISUKE] See ya 'round,
Old Hag!

171
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,750
[RENA] What a rude jerk;

172
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,750
I'm only 14 years old!

173
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,958
[MICHI] Did you get my ball?

174
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:20,375
[SHUGO] Yeah.

175
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,083
[RENA] Are you all right?

176
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,500
[MIREILLE]
Guys can be such wolves;

177
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:24,541
you always gotta be careful.

178
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,166
[OHKA] Women are
wolves actually.

179
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,208
[MICHI] I'm going home.

180
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,041
[SHUGO] Here you go.

181
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,791
[MICHI] Thanks a lot.

182
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:36,916
[SHUGO] Uh yeah...!

183
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,500
No need to thank...

184
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,250
[HAYATO] How did it go?

185
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,541
[MICHI] Piece of cake!

186
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,958
[DAISUKE] We did it,
we got his member address!

187
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,250
[KATSUYUKI] All righty!

188
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:52,458
Let's begin Operation
Delete the Dot Hackers!

189
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:57,583
[SHUGO] I'm back!

190
00:08:57,666 --> 00:09:00,208
Hey, Dad? I'm home.

191
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:05,125
[SHUGO] Message?

192
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,583
[SHUGO] What is this?

193
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,625
[SHUGO] Save... Me...

194
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:30,500
[SHUGO] This is
impossible to read...

195
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:35,750
[MIREILLE] Beware the
Cursed Woodland Murderhouse.

196
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,291
[SHUGO] Is that
really what it said?

197
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:40,000
[MIREILLE] My corrupted text
auto decoder from my item stash

198
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:43,375
managed to successfully
translate the area name.

199
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,333
[RENA] Are you sure?

200
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,291
[MIREILLE] The text corruption

201
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:47,541
from the original
source was pretty bad,

202
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:50,791
so I wasn't able
to decode everything...

203
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,500
[SHUGO] But we definitely know

204
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,750
what area that girl is
in so we can find her...

205
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:57,416
[HOTARU] C'mon let's hurry
so we can go save her!

206
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:03,083
[OHKA] yeah,
I'm dyin' for another fight.

207
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,375
[SANJURO] A mail from Aura...

208
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,208
No explanation...

209
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:15,166
Cursed Woodland Murderhouse!

210
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,083
[SHUGO] This is cool...

211
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,583
[OHKA] It's like something's
just waiting to happen here.

212
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:44,000
[MIREILLE] I smell a rare item
just waiting to be discovered!

213
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,750
[HOTARU] Rena,
what's the matter?

214
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,916
[RENA] N-Nothing

215
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,333
[SANJURO] Do not let your guard
down even for a moment, Shugo

216
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,791
[SHUGO] I'm ready
for action, Sanjuro!

217
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:54,708
All right?

218
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,083
Then, let's go!

219
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,583
[BALMUNG] This is a brilliance
that cleanses the heart...

220
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,500
[REKI] Lord Balmung!

221
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:28,416
[BALMUNG] Reki...

222
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,833
I've completed the repairs here.

223
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:31,416
I have to go to...

224
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,833
[REKI] Ah, not yet,
Lord Balmung.

225
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,500
There are over 200
obstacle claims

226
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,541
that have come in
just this morning.

227
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,208
All the staff have given up
their day off to deal with it

228
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:42,791
and the claims just keep
pouring in from every direction!

229
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,916
[BALMUNG] The strange
weather in this area?

230
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,333
Can it be a coincidence...

231
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,250
Reki!

232
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,416
[REKI] Yes?

233
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,666
[BALMUNG] I'm leaving
it up to you.

234
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,291
There's something I must
attend to right away...

235
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:02,291
[Knight A] You are in violation
of altering the system data!

236
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,083
In the name of the
Cerulean Knights you

237
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,666
will be taken into custody!

238
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,750
[REKI] You have no right

239
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,208
to just warp into here and take
over!

240
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:09,625
Who do you think this man is?

241
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,083
[Knight B] Don't know.

242
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,416
[REKI] You seriously don't know?

243
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,541
[Knight B] I don't.

244
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:14,666
[REKI] This must be
some kind of joke!

245
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,125
[Knight B] I don't
know and don't care!

246
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:20,583
[KAMUI] Lower your swords.

247
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:23,791
This man here is
a system administrator.

248
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,916
[BALMUNG] Kamui...

249
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,625
[KAMUI] Lord Balmung...

250
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,000
[BALMUNG] What brings you here?

251
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,000
[KAMUI] The Cerulean Knights
have but a singular purpose,

252
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:52,041
to preserve the order and
peace throughout The World.

253
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:55,083
For that purpose we will go
to whatever area we choose.

254
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,041
[REKI] We are protecting
the order and peace

255
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,583
on this server, not you.

256
00:12:58,666 --> 00:12:59,916
[KAMUI] Oh really...?

257
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,125
There's been an increase

258
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:03,583
in unstable activity
here recently, correct?

259
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:08,708
[KAMUI] Because Lord Balmung
of the Azure Sky

260
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,666
is too lenient with the users...

261
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:15,958
I cannot be assured this will
not grow into a larger problem.

262
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,250
[KAMUI] Knights!

263
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,375
Place an activity
monitor in this area.

264
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,291
Move out!

265
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,583
[REKI] So those were the
infamous Cerulean Knights, huh?

266
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,083
I've heard
they've been deleting

267
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,041
non-standard characters
without mercy.

268
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,875
[BALMUNG] Yes, yes.

269
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,208
Public control forces under

270
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,041
the direct command
of the CC Corporation.

271
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,250
The company's dogs...

272
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:51,458
[SHUGO] The girl is lost

273
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,250
somewhere inside
this old mansion...

274
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,083
[MIREILLE]
Rare Item. Rare Item...

275
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,791
[OHKA] Where are
all the monsters?

276
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,750
[board creaks]

277
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:03,625
[HOTARU] Are you
hungry or something? 

278
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,458
[HOTARU] Just now
I heard your stomach growl.

279
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,625
[SHUGO] Oh!

280
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,250
[HOTARU] It appears to...
be a dining room...

281
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,541
[OHKA] Just a bug...

282
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,541
[RENA] That freaked me out.

283
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:35,166
[MIREILLE] I'm guess that you're
easily spooked, huh Rena?

284
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,041
[SHUGO] Come to think of it,

285
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,916
she used to disappear

286
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,708
whenever there was
a scary show on television.

287
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,500
Pretty funny.
Remember that, Reina?

288
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,166
[MIREILLE] I knew it.

289
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,250
[SHUGO] Don't worry, Rena!

290
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:46,250
I'm here for you!

291
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:49,416
[OHKA]
Now I'm freaked out.

292
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,750
[RENA] I'm fine.

293
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,041
I'm perfectly fine in
a place like this...

294
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,750
No matter how real it seems,
it's just a game.

295
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,791
[SHUGO] You'll be fine
in this old pace.

296
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,291
I'm here with you.

297
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,833
[RENA] Yeah, right!

298
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:02,375
I'm gonna go in there and you
just watch me not be scared.

299
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:03,500
[SHUGO] Rena!

300
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:04,250
[RENA] Knock it off!

301
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,416
Give me some space!

302
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,333
[KOMIYAN] I find it
deliciously perfect

303
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,000
that Rena is so
easily scared...

304
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,583
I'm so fortunate that I
noticed them coming here

305
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:17,208
and it was so worth it to sneak
in here ahead of time.

306
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:21,250
[KOMIYAN] Ohhh!
Such a nice situation!

307
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:24,791
[RENA] Whoa!

308
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:25,416
I'm scared!

309
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,916
[KOMIYAN] My Rena!

310
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,083
[RENA] Komiyama,
you're so wonderful!

311
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,791
[KOMIYAN] Tres Bi-ennnnnn!

312
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:42,833
[RENA] Hey...
Which way do I go?!

313
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,750
Nothing that way.

314
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,250
Where is everyone?

315
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:48,750
I told them just to back off,

316
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:51,708
then I thought
they'd come after me...

317
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,708
[RENA] I'm on my own now...

318
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,083
Well, I'll be fine.

319
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:58,291
I'll just remember that
this is an artificial world.

320
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,208
[SHUGO] Rena!

321
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,625
[KOMIYAN] Rena!

322
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,083
Incoming!

323
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,458
Eh?

324
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,500
[RENA]
D-D-Don't come any closer!

325
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,541
[MIREILLE] That voice came
from down this hallway I think.

326
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,041
[HOTARU] Rena if
you're down there say so!

327
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:45,041
[SANJURO] Do not
let your guard down.

328
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:47,208
[SANJURO]
It's dangerous for her

329
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:48,375
to be alone
in an unknown area.

330
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,208
Find her!

331
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:51,708
[SHUGO] Got it!

332
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:07,333
[OHKA] This time
it's a real... Monster.

333
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,333
[HOTARU] You did it!

334
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,166
[MIREILLE] Well, it looks
like they got the monsters,

335
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,708
but I don't see any
treasure chest for us.

336
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,333
[RENA]
Shugo!

337
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,041
Hey, Everyone!

338
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:47,458
Where did you go?

339
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:50,708
I can't tell which way is out...

340
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:56,833
[RENA] Why did
I try to act so cool.

341
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:13,625
[RENA] Oh?

342
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:20,750
[RENA] Oh?

343
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:25,458
[RENA] I wonder... Oh...

344
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:32,125
[RENA] Someone...

345
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,125
Open the door...!

346
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,125
[AURA] The plan
was to lure out Kite...

347
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:52,583
But the one caught in
the trap is just as good...

348
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:55,083
[AURA] Black Rose, indeed...

349
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:04,625
[MIREILLE] Aw!

350
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:05,583
We've killed them so many times
already!

351
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,500
[MIREILLE] Vak Don!

352
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:12,458
[OHKA] These guys definitely
aren't normal monsters!

353
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,375
[SANJURO] Shugo!

354
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,000
Leave this to us and go
find Rena immediately.

355
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,666
We're leaving as soon
as you find her!

356
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,791
[SHUGO] R-Right!

357
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:26,750
[RENA screams]

358
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,125
[SHUGO] Rena!

359
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:47,625
How could I...
die with just one hit?

360
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,333
[RENA] Help me, Shugo...

361
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:01,916
[SHUGO] Rena, don't worry.

362
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,208
I can heal you.

363
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,250
[RENA] You can't...

364
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,958
There's no time.

365
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,291
[RENA] It's one of those
monsters that just won't die...

366
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:16,541
[RENA] I'm... done...

367
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:19,958
[SHUGO] Rena... Rena!

368
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,791
[SHUGO] Data Drain!

369
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,500
[SHUGO] Rena!

370
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,041
[OHKA] Rena!

371
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:43,791
[MIREILLE]
I'll heal you, Rena!

372
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,875
[MIREILLE] Repth!

373
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,416
No...?!

374
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,750
[MIREILLE] Repth!

375
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:57,250
That spell has to work!

376
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,791
[SHUGO] Rena!

377
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,250
[RENA] Oh, Shugo...

378
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,541
[SHUGO] Rena!

379
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:06,291
[RENA] Oh, Shugo...

380
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:09,000
[SHUGO] Rena!

381
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,791
[RENA] Shugo!

382
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:15,916
[SHUGO] Rena!

383
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,416
[SHUGO] Rena!

384
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:03,791
[RENA] I have event information!

385
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:06,041
An outdoor hot
springs bath is open

386
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,250
in the area
Enraged Dragon Queen!

387
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:11,208
Hey, guys, don't worry
about looking for me.

388
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:12,416
Just enjoy your bath.

389
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,958
Hey, while you're at
it, pass me the soap.
