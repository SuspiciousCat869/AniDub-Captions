Morti?

00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,083
[SANJURO]
I don't know!

8
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:16,625
[BALMUNG] Be careful!
She's going to attack.

9
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:21,458
[MORTI] This is...
my domain now.

What is this?!

13
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,625
This is her area...
It seems she can

14
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:04,250
manipulate The World
any way she wants to!

15
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,625
Does she think she's
some sort of goddess?!

16
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:12,125
So all the mysterious incidents
in The World lately...

17
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,333
They've all been your doing?

18
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:29,708
[BALMUNG] This is all
her doing... unforgivable.

19
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:32,875
Give me back... Rena!

20

Ah, tres bien! Bohemian!

00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,541
What just happened there?

24
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:48,458
She can teleport in at will...
even other players.

[MORTI chuckles]

26
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,958
What the...
What's going on?

27
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,333
The Capitol of Illusion,
Nebel Mond...

28
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:05,250
it's been... taken away
from CC Corporation control?

29
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,666
I've never seen
anything like that.

30
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,416
Huh. That didn't take long.

31
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,083
[KAMUI] Just who
do you think I am?

32
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:18,083
You're the leader of
the Cerulean Knights.

33
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:22,416
Or at least their
former leader, right, Kamui?

34
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,166
I couldn't leave
with so many loose ends.

35
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:34,083
Here, here, don't you
need items for you quest?

36
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,291
Here, here...

37
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,958
The non-player characters...
They're moving!

38
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:43,875
Did I hear him say
rare i... Item...?

00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,125
Well, this certainly is...
a lively reception.

[SANJURO]
Not yet, Shugo.

49
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,583
But why not?

50
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:13,666
Think... If we use
Data Drain on her now...

51
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,833
We'll lose them.

Ah...!

His thoughts seem
to be confused...

55
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,750
Leave Balmung
alone for now...

56
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:30,583
Let him do what he does
best a while longer.

57
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:34,083
Is it all right... for me to be
here in this room with you?

58
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,208
Well, they did
leave me in charge.

59
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:40,750
Let's just say... you stopped
by to talk about the old times.

60
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:43,791
And I won't feel guilty
if you get fired, too.

61
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,166
[REKI] So tell me
what happened.

62
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,958
What did you find inside
the computers of those kids?

63
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,916
Lots of things.

64
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,791
[REKI]
Lots of things, you say?

65
00:05:54,333 --> 00:06:00,583
It seems... they have quite
an interest in "death." Hm...

66
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,125
[REKI]
Death?

67
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:06,666

00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:25,458

They've come
back to life!

00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:40,500
That's right...
They've defeated death...

74
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,000
[SHUGO]
Wha...?!

75
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,875
Here within The World...

76
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:47,750
it is difficult to
die a "full death"...

77
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:52,833
for non-player characters...
and player characters...

78
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:55,666
What's a "full death"?!
Madness...

79
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,916
Ah... What is she
talking about?

80
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:04,500
You can only take
a joke so far.

81
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,458
I suppose. A death that
occurs within The World

82
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:11,750
is not that serious. It's more
like fun for most of us...

83
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:12,750
[REKI]
Huh?

84
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,083
[KAMUI] The worst
that can happen

85
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:17,625
is you'll lose some items
or experience points...

86
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,833
But to those kids
it's something else.

87
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:20,833
[REKI gasps]

88
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,750
[MORTI] I wish to know...

89
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:35,458
the nature of what
true "death" is...

90
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:37,166
Understanding...

91
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,791
that is all...

92
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,041
[Michi] I wish to know...

93
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,791
Understanding...

94
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:58,958
That's is all...

95
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:03,333
[KAMUI] And so, that wandering
A.I. used the children,

96
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:08,750
to help her quest to make
"full death" a reality.

97
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:13,208
[KAMUI] It's using The World
to understand death.

98
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:16,750
[REKI] But by exploring death
within The World...?

99
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,333
That makes sense...

100
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:19,791
I think.

101
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,458
[KAMUI] It's a modified monster!

102
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,416
[REKI] But, this one is frozen.

103
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,333
[REKI] I finally
managed to capture one

104
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:36,541
without any damage to its code.

105
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,750
It has a very interesting
mechanism inside.

106
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,708
[KAMUI] Mechanism?

107
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,500
[REKI] When you're
killed by this guy,

108
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:45,083
that is, when your
hit points reach zero,

109
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,000
a special gate opens.

110
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,791
It teleports you to an area
within a special server,

111
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,541
closed off from system.

112
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:55,000
[KAMUI] The private
server that we found?!

113
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:58,958
[REKI] At that moment,
the player is placed under

114
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,875
the control of a powerful
mental suggestion.

115
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,333
[Magi] I'm dead.

116
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,750
I'm dead.

117
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,166
I'm dead...

118
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,875
I'm dead.

119
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,583
[REKI] A suggestion that
they are actually dead...

120
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:17,791
in this world...

121
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:18,958
and outside.

122
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:24,250
[REKI] I wondered why
they made such a program...

123
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,375
But if understanding the nature
of "full death" is their goal,

124
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:30,041
then I guess I can
begin to understand it.

125
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,958
[KAMUI] However, in order
to complete their plan

126
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,041
there would be
one more detail...

127
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,666
one more obstacle
standing in their way.

128
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:42,500
[REKI] You mean
CC Corporation.

129
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:46,416
[BALMUNG] The notion of "full
death" stands in contradiction.

130
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,958
It's against the basic idea
of The World as a game.

131
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:52,083
It would drag The World down
the path of destruction.

132
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:55,083
[MORTI] Death to all
player characters.

133
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,125
And a "true death"...

134
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:59,125
will come to this world...

135
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:02,166
[BALMUNG] But if The World
was threatened with destruction

136
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,083
its omnipresent
spirit would protect us.

137
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,791
[SHUGO] The World
has a spirit...?

138
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,625
A guardian?

139
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,500
[SANJURO] That's Aura.

140
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:16,500
[SHUGO] You mean the girl
who gave me this bracelet!

141
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:21,458
[BALMUNG] Soon after Morti
put her plans into motion,

142
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:24,375
Aura began to make
her counter moves.

143
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:28,083
[BALMUNG] Namely, the revival
of the legendary characters...

144
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,500
...the dot hackers!

145
00:10:54,375 --> 00:11:01,250
[SANJURO] She gave you
the power of Kite's Bracelet.

146
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,833
[BALMUNG] She knew
the power of that bracelet...

147
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,458
and that in the right hands it
could be used to save The World.

148
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,708
[MIREILLE] So that's why
she tried to kill Shugo,

149
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:17,791
and why she kept sending

150
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,250
all those modified
monsters after us!

151
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:24,500
[HOTARU] Then that means Rena
was taken away in Shugo's place?

152
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,166
[SANJURO] No...

153
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:30,833
Rena's disappearance may
not have been an accident.

154
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:33,125
[BALMUNG] That's right.

155
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:36,125
[KAMUI] I searched through
all of the children's computers.

156
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:39,416
I was able to extract data

157
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,708
that identified Shugo
as the primary target.

158
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,166
However...

159
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:46,916
[REKI] Something
didn't make sense?

160
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,500
[KAMUI] The more I analyzed
the information,

161
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:52,708
the more I began to realize that
Rena was the intended target.

162
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:55,125
[KAMUI] Think about it.

163
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,666
If this thing killed Shugo,

164
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,833
it would have teleported him
back to that secret area right?

165
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:03,250
[REKI] And if the mental
suggestion wasn't compete,

166
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,916
and Shugo happened to awaken...

167
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,416
[KAMUI] There would
have been nothing capable

168
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,708
of opposing the bracelet's
energy from inside that server.

169
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,375
[REKI] He would easily see
through the plan from there,

170
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:17,041
and he and the bracelet
would bring it down...

171
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:23,083
[KAMUI] However, the suggestion
on Rena was removed...

172
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,541
[MORTI] I wish...

173
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:28,000
I wish to know what
the nature of true "death" is...

174
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,583
That is what I desire...

175
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,250
[SANJURO] The risk of
targeting Shugo was too high,

176
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:36,750
so she changed
the target to Rena.

177
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,083
[SHUGO] B-But why Rena?!

178
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,500
[MIREILLE] It's because
she doesn't have

179
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,208
the powerful bracelet
that you have, Shugo.

180
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:49,250
[BALMUNG] And to destroy
Aura's very existence.

181
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,375
[SHUGO] Aura...?

182
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:52,625
[MORTI] That is...

183
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,333
...all I desire...

184
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,083
[Rena] That child...?

185
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,583
[BALMUNG] Aura...

186
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:29,750
Is the omnipresent spirit of
The World is also its protector.

187
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:35,458
Her presence is everywhere,
but at the same time nowhere.

188
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:39,791
I it possible to destroy
that which does not exist?

189
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:46,583
[BALMUNG] Now, someone
seems to have found a way.

190
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:49,041
[REKI] So part
of its plan was...

191
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,041
Rena?

192
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,541
[SANJURO] What will
her next move be?

193
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,541
[BALMUNG] I don't know...

194
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:18,875
But I can tell you
with certainty

195
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,041
that she does not
care for us very much.

196
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,916
[MORTI] Aura is...

197
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,666
...Aura is unnecessary...

198
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:34,750
[MORTI] So she will
be completely erased...

199
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,500
[KAMUI] First, we must create
a highly contagious virus

200
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,500
to put an end
to this threat.

201
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:42,958
Something strong enough to
infect all the corrupted data...

202
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,625
In essence
a digital Black Plague.

203
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:48,250
[REKI] A complete deletion...
that's going to be tough.

204
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:52,625
Especially within
The World servers.

205
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,416
They have so many
backup systems.

206
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,833
[KAMUI] But it's something we
have to develop and quickly.

207
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,916
And then the new virus...

208
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,375
has to be
delivered to Rena...

209
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:09,083
[Rena] Oh...

210
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:13,250
[Rena] Shugo...

211
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,166
Shugo!

212
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,208
[SHUGO] Rena!

213
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,166
[Growling Monster]

214
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:25,875
[MORTI] I'll realize
the "World of the Dead."

215
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:33,375
[Rena] N-No!!

216
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:48,250
[SHUGO] Rena!

217
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:52,083
[KAMUI] It's tracing Rena's
Member Address list

218
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,833
infecting everyone that
she's been in contact with...

219
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,458
[SANJURO] Our hit
points are draining

220
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:01,500
- we can't take
this much longer!

221
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:04,750
[BALMUNG] A virus... of course.

222
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,083
She's trying to delete
every character

223
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,458
that's been connected to Rena!

224
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:10,583
[OHKA] E-Everyone?!

225
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,000
[BALMUNG] Us and...

226
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,125
...Aura.

227
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,250
[SHUGO] Rena!

228
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,583
[Rena] No!!

229
00:16:56,666 --> 00:17:00,000
[SHUGO] R-Rena...

230
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,250
[MIREILLE] It's no good...

231
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,250
I can't logout.

232
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,958
[OHKA] At this rate...

233
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:14,083
[Rena] No!

234
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:18,500
[SHUGO] Aura!

235
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,750
Au...

236
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,250
Ra...

237
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:28,250
[Aura] Now...
now while you can...

238
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:29,791
Hurry...

239
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,791
if you can defeat
the monster...

240
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,833
the virus will--

241
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:34,875
[BALMUNG] Understood!

242
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,916
Phal Repth!

243
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:46,375
[SHUGO] Our hit points!

244
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:49,000
[Michi] It's not here...

245
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,916
There's nothing here...

246
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,125
[BALMUNG] Hyper Vak!

247
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,708
[Growling Monster]

248
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,291
[MIREILLE] Ohka...

249
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:04,750
[MIREILLE]
There's something on you.

250
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,000
[OHKA] What?

251
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,250
Mireille, it's on you, too!

252
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:08,291
[MIREILLE] Eh?

253
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,333
[SHUGO] W-What
is this stuff?!

254
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,333
[BALMUNG] It's the effect
of the virus!

255
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,583
[SANJURO] Oh-h!

256
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,625
It must be destroyed!

257
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:22,958
[SHUGO] If I'm being
given a second chance...

258
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,500
[SHUGO]...I will not
let her down this time!

259
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:26,208
[Rena] Oh Shugo!

260
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,750
[Growling Monster]

261
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:28,375
[SHUGO]

262
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:29,458
[Rena] No Shugo!

263
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,458
[SHUGO] Rena...

264
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,416
Hang on!

265
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:38,250
[SHUGO] R-Rena!

266
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,250
[Growling Monster]

267
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:43,791
[Rena] Shugo!

268
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,375
[REKI] It's no good.

269
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,500
There's no way to make a virus
that can be delivered in time!

270
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,875
[KAMUI] Then we only
have one choice left...

271
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,750
.destroy the source.

272
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,708
[REKI] Do you think
that can be done?

273
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,583
[KAMUI] Well, if we can't...

274
00:18:55,666 --> 00:19:00,375
Then the spirit that we know
as Aura will cease to exist.

275
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:01,958
[REKI] And then...

276
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:06,208
the terror of "True Death"
will overtake The World

277
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:09,958
[REKI] And after that...

278
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,875
I wonder what
will happen to us?

279
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,500
[KAMUI] I have no idea...

280
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,041
Either we'll be
sent to the hospital

281
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:18,458
in a coma like the others, or...

282
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:22,041
or we'll be the first to truly
die because of this incident.

283
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:27,291
[KAMUI] There's nothing
more I can do by staying here.

284
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,791
[REKI] So...

285
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:32,458
you'll go to be by the side
of the one you truly love?

286
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,583
[REKI] Oh, that's okay!

287
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:38,250
I'm a big fan of Lord Balmung
and all he's done for us.

288
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,291
he can be a little
hard-headed...

289
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:43,333
but The World's a better place
with him out adventuring in it.

290
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:48,375
[KAMUI] So that's the
reason behind your actions?

291
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:49,750
I should've known.

292
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,458
[REKI] I envy him.

293
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,375
[OHKA] Shugo!

294
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:12,375
[SHUGO] What!

295
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,583
[MIREILLE] Where's my staff...?

296
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:17,250
I can't use my spells!

297
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:21,125
[SANJURO] So in the end
we're left empty-handed...

298
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,583
[SHUGO] Empty-handed?

299
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,916
I still have this!

300
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,041
[SANJURO] The virus
didn't affect the bracelet!

301
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,083
[BALMUNG]
A special item indeed!

302
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,250
[SHUGO] Stand back!

303
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,208
Data--

304
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:35,708
[Aura] No!

305
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:36,791
[SHUGO] Eh?

306
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,208
[Aura] You'll hit Rena...

307
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:41,625
then she'll be
data drained too...

308
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,750
[Aura] If that happens...

309
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,083
I will not be
able to stop

310
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:49,250
the progress of the virus
before it's too late.

311
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,708
[SHUGO]
I can't save her...

312
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,916
The bracelet
was our last chance!

313
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,750
[SHUGO] Uh?

314
00:20:58,833 --> 00:20:59,791
Wh- Whoa!

315
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:01,250
[MIREILLE] Shugo!

316
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,375
[Rena] Big brother!

317
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:04,916
[Growling Monster]

318
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,750
[KAMUI] Dark Traitor!

319
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:10,291
[Growling Monster]

320
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:11,875
[BALMUNG] Kamui!

321
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,625
[KAMUI] Weapons may be no use...

322
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:17,208
but we can certainly
use items against it.

323
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:27,666
[KAMUI] This is a knight's
battle of revenge!

324
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,791
[SHUGO] I'm coming
back for you...

325
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:30,833
Rena!

326
00:21:48,458 --> 00:22:01,666
[SHUGO] Who're you?

327
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,416
[Rena] I have the
final information for you!

328
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,583
Oh, this is terrible!

329
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:06,916
Terrible!

330
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,375
I can't believe The World
might go away forever!

331
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,833
Of course, I don't want it to!

332
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:14,958
Because I want to be
with you always, Shugo!
