[alarm]

2
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:01,708
Aww, man. They can't be
performing maintenance

3
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:04,208
for twenty-four hours
straight on this server.

4
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,541
Ahh... This time the
Spring of Myst is empty!

5
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:09,166
Who's behind this prank?

6
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:12,583
[surprised yelp]

7
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:29,125
What kind of
monster was that?

8
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,166
Upside down palm trees,

9
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,750
empty Springs of Myst,
unheard of monsters...

10
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:41,500
This is crazy!
How is this happening?

11
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:53,166
[TOM screams]

12
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,166
Gotta log out

13
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,916
and contact the
system administrator.

14
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,166
Eh...? What's happening?!

15
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:32,416
[SHUGO] I, Shugo Kunisaki,
upon entering junior high,

16
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,333
thought I had outgrown games.

17
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:39,916
[ANNOUNCER] Congratulations!

18
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,416
[SHUGO] I knew that a net game

19
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,958
called "The World"
was really popular,

20
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,958
but I never had
a desire to play it

21
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,208
[ANNOUNCER] You've won
the grand prize in the

22
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:49,166
The World Limited-
Edition Character Contest

23
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:55,833
[SHUGO] Until today, that is.

24
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:57,333
[RENA] What? You're kidding me.

25
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,125
You won the contest, too?

26
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:00,625
Whaddya mean "won"?

27
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:03,250
You mean you just went
behind my back and entered me?

28
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,375
Rena, how could you do this?

29
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,458
[RENA] But the odds
are astronomical

30
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,750
for the two of us
to have won together!

31
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,083
Aren't you glad I did?

32
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,208
Aw, man, we're definitely twins!

33
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:14,625
[SHUGO] But Rena...

34
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,333
Even if I did win this...

35
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,208
I don't have the
software for The World.

36
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,208
[RENA] No Problem!

37
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:20,958
Before Mom and
I left your place,

38
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,833
I installed it on your computer.

39
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,333
[SHUGO] Eh? You did what?

40
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:27,375
[RENA] And, since we
both won the same contest,

41
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:30,250
we can explore
The World together!

42
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,291
[SHUGO] She's got an
answer for everything.

43
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,208
[SHUGO] Well, here goes nothin'.

44
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,833
Oooooh! Oooh, hah!

45
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,875
Wow, this is a net game?

46
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:13,583
They sure are
getting more realistic.

47
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,125
[PC#1] Hey, I don't
see you for a while

48
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,875
and you've suddenly leveled?

49
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,083
[PC#2] It's 'cause
I've been sticking

50
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,416
with a strong party.

51
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,541
I've gained a lot of
experience with this spear.

52
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,041
[PC#3] Yeah!

53
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,291
That area's treasure
boxes are mostly trapped!

54
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:33,458
[MACHO PC] Hey, wanna
form a party with me?

55
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:36,625
[SHUGO] Uuuuungh!!

56
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,166
[GLAMOROUS HEAVY BLADE]
You have some nerve

57
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,000
plowing into me like that.

58
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,958
So what do you have
to say for yourself?

59
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,625
[GLAMOROUS HEAVY BLADE]
You wanna try it again?

60
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:59,333
[GLAMOROUS HEAVY BLADE]
Yeah, right...

61
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:03,708
[SHUGO] I... uh, just might
get to like The World.

62
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,833
[RENA] Shugo, you're late!

63
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:14,166
You're my brother Shugo, right?

64
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:19,666
Whoa! C-Could you be... Rena?
My little twin sister... Rena?

65
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,125
Is it you?

66
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:24,875
Bingo! It's sure been
a while, big brother.

67
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,708
And, it's our first time
meeting in character...

68
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,625
I'm Rena the Heavy Blade!

69
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,250
Nice to meet you.

70
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,458
Thanks...

71
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:39,041
Those two...
Aren't they the ones?

72
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,083
Y'mean...

73
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,791
...the limited-edition
characters?

74
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:42,875
You're kidding...

75
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,333
They're the winners?

76
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,125
[PC#6] Don't they
look a little small

77
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:47,541
to be the legendary heroes.

78
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,041
[PC#5] Yeah, they sure do.

79
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,125
[PC#1] You just don't see
those characters around anymore.

80
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,166
[SHUGO] Don't look now,
but I think we've been noticed.

81
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,541
[RENA] Well, of course!

82
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,458
We're the winners of the
Character Campaign Contest.

83
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,583
So cool! I never
thought that the

84
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:03,000
.hacker characters
would be the prize...

85
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,375
...we're so lucky!

86
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,833
Who are the ".hackers"?

87
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,416
In the game,

88
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,166
they were the party that solved
the Last Mystery of The World

89
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,541
and because of that
they became legends.

90
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,125
There were
two original members:

91
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,000
a young male Twin Blade, Kite

92
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:21,250
and a young girl
Heavy Blade, BlackRose.

93
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,250
And when they
solved the mystery,

94
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,666
other players weren't allowed

95
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,958
to use their
character forms anymore.

96
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:29,458
Now we get to look like
the legendary heroes...

97
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,333
It's so cool!

98
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:33,750
We look like
legendary heroes...?

99
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,583
[RENA] What's wrong?

100
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,875
[SHUGO] Y-Your outfit...
It's kinda...

101
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,625
Can't you do something about it?

102
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:47,750
[RENA] Eh?!

103
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,125
It's just...

104
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:52,083
Couldn't you wear something
a little more legendary?

105
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:54,458
[RENA] I don't know...

106
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,250
Personally, I think
this look is kinda cute

107
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,083
[SHUGO] Even if
it's just a game...

108
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,125
It's making me a
little uncomfortable.

109
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,833
[RENA] Oh, well you
just need to get over it!

110
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:07,666
I've found you!

111
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,541
[HOTARU] Um, excuse me...

112
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:21,666
[HOTARU] W-Would you...
do business with me...?

113
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,375
[SANJURO] Fairly sudden to ask
to do business with someone...

114
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,208
M-My mistake.

115
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:30,666
I mean... I can...
come back... if you want.

116
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:37,666
[HOTARU] Um... or...
I-I could just...

117
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,500
Just relax, lttlie one.

118
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,125
I'll do business with you...

119
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,083
[SHUGO] It's so strange

120
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:47,041
talking with Rena three
months after she's left.

121
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,750
Have you...
been eating okay?

122
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,000
Huh? Eh? Yeah!

123
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:58,000
Y'know, I've actually
become a pretty good cook.

124
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,875
[SHUGO] What about you?

125
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,708
Is mom keeping busy with work?

126
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:06,041
I guess.

127
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,916
[SHUGO] Yeah, well...

128
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,625
Hey, since we're
logged into The World,

129
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,500
let's do something.

130
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,833
But what's wrong
with chatting?

131
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,666
That can be fun, too.

132
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,791
[SHUGO] Come on! Let's go!

133
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,708
Alright, I'm coming!

134
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:25,583
Let's get down to the basics of
role-playing: fighting monsters!

135
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:26,625
[SHUGO] Alright!

136
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,333
[RENA] Okay ready?!

137
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:37,166
Bursting...
Passed Over... Aqua Field!

138
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,666
[MIREILLE] Bursting
Passed Over Aqua Field!

139
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,166
[RENA] Here we are!

140
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,875
Where are the monsters?

141
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:00,666
They appear through
these magic portals.

142
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,333
Magic portals?

143
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:03,500
[RENA] This way. C'mon!

144
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,125
[SHUGO] Hey, Rena! Wait up!

145
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,958
[RENA] C'mon slow poke!

146
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,166
This is a
beginner level...

147
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,916
It's an area designed
for newbie characters.

148
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,750
But those two are...

149
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,583
[RENA] Okay, here it comes

150
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,708
You'll be just fine,

151
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,250
you don't need
to be that nervous!

152
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:37,250
The monsters are usually
just small fries in this area.

153
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:41,000
[SHUGO] That's... A monster?

154
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,208
[RENA] That's a Mad Grass.

155
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,041
It's a level one monster.

156
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,458
Level One?

157
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:46,583
Yeah.

158
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,791
Stand back, Rena...

159
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,083
I'll protect
my fair little sister!

160
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,583
Go, Shugo!

161
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,041
Be careful!

162
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,000
Calamity Cut!

163
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,916
[RENA] The legendary
hero is crying.

164
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,208
Here, take this.

165
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,041
[SHUGO] Huh?

166
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:14,875
[RENA] It's a health drink.

167
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,750
It restores your hit points.

168
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:22,333
[SHUGO]
Phew... That really helps!

169
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:25,500
Shugo, you have no idea
how to attack, do you?

170
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:26,875
Eh?!

171
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,750
You could've just used a
simple blade attack against

172
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:31,250
a Mad Grass and
defeated it easily.

173
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,500
You know what I think?

174
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,083
You didn't read the manual...

175
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,791
After all I went through.

176
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,291
[RENA] Hey, Shugo!

177
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:39,791
You say you've
graduated from games,

178
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,833
but in reality, you never
read the instruction manual

179
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,291
and then just play
however you want.

180
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,250
Then you complain
when you get defeated

181
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:50,333
and stop playing.
That's not graduating.

182
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:51,916
Isn't that more like quitting?

183
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,125
I wouldn't go that far...

184
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,750
[RENA] Look, that's fine
with those other games.

185
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,625
But this game is The World...

186
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:02,666
And don't forget I can
actually see you in here...

187
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,958
Ok, I'll read the manual.

188
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,291
The next monster's mine

189
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,583
and that one doesn't
stand a chance!

190
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,125
[SHUGO] This time, for sure!

191
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,458
[RENA] The legendary hero.

192
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,541
He's back in the game.

193
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,666
Uh, is this one of
those "small fry" monsters?

194
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,666
No it's, an
Armored Super Shogun!

195
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:43,333
That's a level 48 super
strong monster here.

196
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,375
[BOTH] Waugh!

197
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,041
[MIREILLE] Whoa...

198
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,708
What in The World is
an Armored Super Shogun

199
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,583
doing in a newbie area?!

200
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:27,416
[SHUGO] Rena!
I'm dying just from that?

201
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,375
Shugo! You need to heal.

202
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:30,875
There's no time!

203
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,375
But you'll...

204
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,875
[SHUGO] Get outta here!
Run!

205
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,791
[SHUGO] I was finished
off... like that?

206
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:46,791
Man, just when I wanted
to prove myself to Rena...

207
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,750
What kind of game is this?

208
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,375
[SHUGO] What is this?

209
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,416
Is this part of The World too?

210
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,583
[SHUGO] Am I dead?

211
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:04,958
I wonder what happens
when you die in this game?

212
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:08,541
Well, it's just a game, right?

213
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:13,125
All I have to do is get this
Head Mounted Display off, right?

214
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,083
[SHUGO] Wh-What?

215
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,500
I can't move!

216
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,166
Somebody help me!

217
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:33,166
Dad! Mom! Rena!!!

218
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,208
[RENA] Hey Shugo!

219
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:44,500
Where are you, Shugo?

220
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:20,041
[RENA] Shugo... Where are you?

221
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,666
As long as
there's someone...

222
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,541
As long as there's someone
still alive in the party...

223
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,250
...a character
who dies is supposed

224
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:30,541
to remain nearby as a ghost!
So where is he then?

225
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,250
Something's wrong!

226
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,041
[RENA] How could such
a powerful monster

227
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,458
appear in this area?!

228
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:42,041
There's nothing about this
in the instruction manual!

229
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:49,083
[RENA]
Ahhhhh!!

230
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,250
[AURA] You mustn't die...

231
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:05,541
[SHUGO] Rena...?
No... Who is this?

232
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,750
Aaah! Well thank you.

233
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:29,125
So you've healed
all my damage?

234
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,166
[AURA] Data Drain...

235
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,875
Huh?

236
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,625
You can
defeat it using...

237
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,416
...Data Drain.

238
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,625
I can defeat it...?
That monster?

239
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,375
The only one who
can save The World...

240
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,041
...that one is you.

241
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:57,291
You are the heir
to the .hackers legend

242
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,791
Uh-hey... Wait!

243
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,291
[AURA] Please help.

244
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:21,166
I'm alive... Right?

245
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:29,500
That was my first kiss...
Hmm? This bracelet...

246
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,250
Noooo!

247
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,000
Rena!

248
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:36,916
Renaaaaa!

249
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:48,208
[gasps]
Balmung of the Azure Sky?!

250
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,041
What?

251
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,208
Owww...

252
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:09,416
Rena! RENAAAA!

253
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:11,500
Shugo!

254
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,833
Just keep back!

255
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,958
You're no match for this one!

256
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,875
[SHUGO] My little
sister is in trouble!

257
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,708
You think I'm gonna do nothing?!

258
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:19,875
[RENA] Shugo!

259
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:22,625
Rena!

260
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,083
Shugo!

261
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,208
Hang on!!

262
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:34,500
[SHUGO] I've gotta help
Rena! Data Drain!

263
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:51,125
The Armored Super Shogun
is now a Limp Knife!

264
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,416
Rena, you okay?! Huh?

265
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:00,708
Are you all right?

266
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:03,375
A... Ah... I am now...

267
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,375
Hey! Who are you?!

268
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,541
A-And you have no right...

269
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:09,375
...to hold my sister like that.

270
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:20,541
Who was that cool guy? Rawr...

271
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,833
A Limp Knife
is all that's left.

272
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,333
Vak Don!!!

273
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,250
The Rare Hunter
of Love and Courage

274
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:40,666
at your service.
Mireille's here!

275
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,000
Rare Hunter?

276
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,875
She plays a
Wavemaster character

277
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:46,583
that lives to
collect rare items.

278
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,416
Pleased to meet you.
You're the winners of the

279
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,916
limited-edition
characters, correct?

280
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,500
Uh... yes

281
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:56,666
[MIREILLE] I thought so!

282
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,666
I was sure that was it,
so I followed you!

283
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:01,750
[SHUGO] Huh...?

284
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:02,750
[MIREILLE] Thanks to you,

285
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,291
I got to see some
amazing things--

286
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:07,291
an Armored Super Shogun
appearing in a newbie area...

287
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:10,416
The appearance of Balmung
of the Azure Sky...

288
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,083
Did you say Balmung?

289
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,708
That guy who saved
us was Balmung?

290
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:18,500
Yup! He's a
legend in The World.

291
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:22,208
Ohhh... I forgot to thank him...

292
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,083
[MIREILLE] I guess you really
get some special events

293
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:27,458
when you're playing with
limited-edition characters!

294
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:30,708
[SHUGO thinking] Event...
Is that what that was?

295
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,458
But the biggest surprise

296
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,875
I've seen so far is
this amazing bracelet!

297
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,625
It's the first time
I've ever seen an item

298
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,958
that's able to rewrite
a monster's data.

299
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,083
Aaaah... nice texture...

300
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:46,291
It's so nice... It's so nice...

301
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,500
[RENA] C'mon Shugo!
I have to make dinner!

302
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,750
[RENA] Let's go home...

303
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,208
[SHUGO] Uh... Ok...

304
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,875
Bye then. See ya!

305
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,041
Thanks

306
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,041
Ah! Hold on a second!

307
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,708
[REKI] You called, Lord Balmung?

308
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,000
[BALMUNG] Reki, just now,

309
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:19,833
an Armored Super Shogun
appeared in this area...

310
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:20,833
That can't be!

311
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:23,250
This is an area for beginners.

312
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,375
[BALMUNG]
It was slightly different

313
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:27,625
from the typical
Armored Super Shogun.

314
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:29,166
Eh?

315
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,416
[BALMUNG] Perhaps...

316
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,166
...it has something to
do with that incident.

317
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,250
I understand.
I'll go investigate

318
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:40,000
[BALMUNG] But...

319
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,458
What worries me
more is those two.

320
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:47,375
Kite and BlackRose...

321
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,875
Why have those
two characters returned?

322
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,208
[RENA] Hey there!

323
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,916
I've got information
