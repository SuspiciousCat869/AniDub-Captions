[SHUGO screaming]

2
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:11,916
Don't run away.

3
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:15,083
Yaaah! Here I go!

4
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:30,083
[SANJURO] Now it's your turn.

5
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:34,166
[SHUGO] Aaaaaah!

6
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,250
You can do it...

7
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:46,833
The pain...

8
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,458
[RENA] Heeey!

9
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:00,333
Hey Shugo.

10
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:01,541
Rena!

11
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,041
Lately, all you've
been doing is playing

12
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,041
with Sanjuro and not with me.

13
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,541
We've been training,
not playing...

14
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:12,625
All great warriors must first
learn to train properly.

15
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:16,208
Yeah, but he's not a warrior!

16
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:19,291
I want to become stronger!

17
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:21,250
So I can protect you!

18
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,791
It's all right if you train,

19
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:34,125
but we need to spend some
time together, too, y'know.

20
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,041
Mm. Yeah.

21
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:46,708
[SHUGO] Night of
the Weaver Festival...?

22
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:49,625
[RENA] That's right.
Tonight, over in a special area,

23
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:52,458
the Night of the Weaver
Festival event is being held!

24
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,250
Well... what's that?

25
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,125
Well, let's be sure
to check it out...

26
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,500
...plus it's "Tanabata Night"...

27
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,583
The holiday when
the lovers Orihime

28
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,750
and Kengyu are reunited.

29
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:08,166
This event is bound to be a
wonderfully romantic adventure!

30
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,125
Romantic?

31
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,791
And what's so wrong
with being romantic?

32
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:16,333
[KOMIYAN]
Shishishishishi.

33
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:19,250
To not understand the
romance of Tanabata Night...

34
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,375
Oh-ho, what a fool!

35
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:26,791
Bonjour, Mademoiselle.

36
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,208
Shishishishi.

37
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,958
Ah, why don't you
leave that boorish guy

38
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:36,625
and go with me to
this romantic event?

39
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:39,333
Shishishishi!

40
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:41,541
Whoa! Oof!

41
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:43,916
And who... are you?

42
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,541
I am Komiyan the Third...

43
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:50,583
I am known as the
King of Aloofness!

44
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:54,500
Shishishishi!

45
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,791
Uh-huh. You're Komiyama, right?

46
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:57,833
[KOMIYAN gasps loudly]

47
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,708
Ouchouchouchouch!

48
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,541
Yup, he's Komiyama.

49
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,958
Do not speak of
the real world here!

50
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,875
And who are you anyway?

51
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:08,083
Hey, it's Shugo Kunisaki

52
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,750
[SANJURO]
An acquaintance of yours?

53
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,916
He used to be in
my class last year.

54
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,166
It was that ridiculous
laugh that gave him away.

55
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,166
Hey, is it really Komiyama?!

56
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,791
Remember me, Rena?!

57
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:22,500
Uh... Th-The same
Rena that transferred out?

58
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:25,000
Yeah... that's me!

59
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:29,041
[KOMIYAN sucks air in]
Ohhh.. Ooo... Mmmm!

60
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:32,666
Even inside a game
Rena is tres bi-eeeehn!!

61
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,875
Ouch.

62
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:38,125
[SHUGO] Don't be hitting
on game characters.

63
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,708
Come on, Rena, let's find
Mireille and the others.

64
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,166
Uh?

65
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,291
Then I'll sign up for the
Tanabata Event tonight.

66
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:47,541
Really?!

67
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,375
I'm sorry.

68
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:09,916
Were you in the middle of
maintenance, Lord Balmung?

69
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,791
Tonight's event will be
getting underway very soon.

70
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:16,625
Reki, I'm leaving
tonight's event up to you.

71
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,625
What, Lord Balmung?

72
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:21,083
It's not a bad thing to
occasionally return to being

73
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:24,291
just a normal player and
sign up for the event, is it?

74
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,750
You just want
to play, don't you?

75
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,291
[BALMUNG] Hm.

76
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:31,166
Uh, did something...
happen today?

77
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,541
[BALMUNG] The other day,
it seems an operator

78
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,625
in the middle of maintenance
slipped into a coma...

79
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:38,333
[REKI] What?! But
how could that happen?

80
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,625
The Twilight.

81
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,416
But that's not possible

82
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,333
since everyone knows
the system was improved

83
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:50,708
so an event like that
could never happen again!

84
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:51,750
[BALMUNG] But even this system

85
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,833
is still not
completely error free...

86
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:57,541
When we receive information
regarding disturbances,

87
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,666
we operators need to be
acting on them immediately.

88
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,458
[REKI] Lord Blamung...?

89
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,500
[BALMUNG] A perfect
version of The World

90
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,833
might well be unattainable.

91
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,416
Sorry I'm late!

92
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,916
Whoa! A yukata!

93
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,041
It's Mireille's prized secret...

94
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,333
It's a very rare item!

95
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,458
Sorry we're late.

96
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,875
Ooh! Everyone's in a yukata!

97
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:32,375
Hey, Mireille, what's so rare
about your yukata anyway?

98
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,958
Ugh! I got it
from a major battle!

99
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,250
It's different
from everyone else's!

100
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,208
Oh really?

101
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:40,125
[RENA] Shugo...

102
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,291
Huh?

103
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:48,875
[chuckles] Does it... suit me?

104
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,625
Oh. Uh-huh.

105
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,875
I'm so relieved!

106
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:57,041
And what do you think
about mine, Shugo?

107
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,916
Does it suit me?

108
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,541
Uh... yeah.

109
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:03,666
Kay!

110
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,458
Little space here,
a little space.

111
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:10,500
Now we're ready for Distant
Azure River, so let's GO!

112
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:24,125
[HOTARU] So, uh, what
are we doing exactly?

113
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:26,833
The Festival...
of the Weaver Maiden!

114
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:28,250
Huh?

115
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,916
You write down your wish
and dangle it from the trees.

116
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,083
If you do so,

117
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:34,000
it's said that your
wish will come true.

118
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:36,541
Oh, how neat!

119
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:40,541
Hmm... Hm? Hmmmm....

120
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,750
[OHKA] Yes.

121
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,208
Shugo! This is mine.

122
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:15,375
[KOMIYAN]
Shishishishi.

123
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:18,041
I've been waiting, Rena.

124
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,416
Hey, what are you
doing here, Komiyama?!

125
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,333
Uh... Is that you, Kunisaki?!

126
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:24,583
Course it is!

127
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,833
You think I'd leave my
little sister Rena alone

128
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,333
with someone like you around?!

129
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:30,416
[MIREILLE] An Acquaintance?

130
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,583
[RENA] Mm-hmm.
He's an old classmate.

131
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:35,250
Oh dear, you're
with friends, are you?

132
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,083
Their presence
here serves only

133
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:40,500
to enhance the beauty
of the fabulous Rena.

134
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,708
I'll delete him!

135
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,875
[REKI] All participants,
please gather around

136
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:04,041
the special event stage.

137
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:08,458
[REKI] Everyone, welcome
to the Azure Distant River!

138
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,083
This is the
Tanabata Night Event.

139
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,208
In honor of the
legendary Orihime,

140
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,875
this is a Battle Royale!

141
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:21,291
Or you could call it,
the Tanabata de Ton-O-Boat-A's!

142
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:24,500
Wow, that title's
all washed up...

143
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,041
Yeah, that joke is sinking fast.

144
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,541
[SHUGO] Yeah, I think
it's all wet, too...

145
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:32,625
I just don't understand
this kid's style...

146
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,625
[REKI] To start off,
one player will be chosen

147
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,875
to serve as "Orihime"
the legendary damsel.

148
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,083
After overcoming
a number of trials,

149
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:43,250
the one that reaches Orihime
first, will be the winner.

150
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,750
The prize for winner?

151
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,541
The wish that they
wrote down in secret

152
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:49,416
and hung from the
trees will come true!

153
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,375
So whattya think, folks?!

154
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,000
Seriously?!

155
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:52,916
Cool...

156
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,750
[KOMIYAN] Shishishi!
Oh, yes!

157
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:58,708
Rena's socks are mine!

158
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,416
If it is a wish that
cannot be fulfilled

159
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,333
within the boundaries
of The World,

160
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:07,541
a one-year access subscription
will be awarded to the winner.

161
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:11,458
[REKI] Okay! Is everyone ready?!

162
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:15,333
And our Orihime
is this lucky player!

163
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,291
Oh!

164
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,916
Rena!

165
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,291
What?!

166
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,583
And now, Orihime,
please introduce yourself!

167
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,041
Eh...? I'm, uh...

168
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:38,166
Rena, fourteen years old!

169
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,333
Pleased to meet you everyone!

170
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:43,083
[REKI]
Isn't that great folks?

171
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,833
[BALMUNG thinking]
The selection of Orihime should

172
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,625
have been completely random...

173
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:49,458
Yet, that's the girl
who was selected...

174
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,250
Can this be a coincidence...?

175
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,125
Oh, Rena!

176
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:56,500
Stand back!
The stage is moving!

177
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:10,583
This is the story of
Orihime and Kengyu.

178
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:11,708
They are fated to meet

179
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,958
for only one brief
moment each year...

180
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:17,458
...on the seventh night
of the seventh month...

181
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,958
[KOMIYAN] Oh, Rena,
I'm on my way!

182
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,041
There is no way

183
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,375
I'm letting that
guy win this event!

184
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,583
Rare item... Rare item...

185
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:27,750
Itching to go.

186
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,541
You're just watching?

187
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:32,416
A master works that way.

188
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,916
Fair enough.

189
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
If trained, Shugo has the
potential to improve even more.

190
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,416
[REKI] Now, cross
the River of Heaven

191
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,083
to reach the side of
your beloved Orihime!

192
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,958
[REKI] Let's go!

193
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,166
Rena!

194
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,250
You'll find the lake
gets deeper in the middle.

195
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,958
Please be careful.

196
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,416
You could have said so!

197
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,833
[KOMIYAN]
Oh, so clumsy, Kunisaki.

198
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:18,041
[SHUGO]
Hey, that's not fair!

199
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:21,541
[KOMIYAN] There's no rule
against riding a Grunty!

200
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:25,708
Shishishishi! Go,
my beloved mount, Oscar!

201
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:30,916
I'm not letting
that guy get to Rena!

202
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:34,500
I'm really sorry Shugo,
this race is mine!

203
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,708
[OHKA] Outta the way!

204
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,125
Eh?!

205
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,583
And now... Ice Storm!

206
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,875
Ice!

207
00:13:58,958 --> 00:13:59,958
Yahoo!

208
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:05,041
Rare item... my ice skates! Wee!

209
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,708
What a relief this is!

210
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:08,708
[OHKA] Ugh! Mireille!

211
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,833
[MIREILLE] This is a cinch.

212
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,208
Not so fast!

213
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,458
[ice cracking]

214
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:16,791
Arrrgh! Ahahaha!!

215
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:17,875
Oh!

216
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:23,291
Sorry, nothing
personal, Mireille!

217
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:24,875
Let's go, Oscar!

218
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,125
Wait up!

219
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:27,916
[HOTARU] Someone help me!

220
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,666
Huh?

221
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,125
[SHUGO] Hotaru! What's wrong?!

222
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,250
I never learned how to swim.

223
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,833
Oh no!

224
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:40,000
I thought I'd make it...
If I could just stay on the ice.

225
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,500
Come on, Hotaru.
Let's head back.

226
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,041
[REKI] Oh my,
for some reason one

227
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,583
of the players
has turned around.

228
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,625
Shugo...

229
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,958
[REKI] In front
are Mireille and Ohka!

230
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:56,875
But coming up steadily behind
them is Komiyan the Third!

231
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,666
Don't get in my way, Ohka!

232
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,750
Don't you get in my way!

233
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:01,583
Back off!

234
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:02,958
[KOMIYAN]
Shishishishi.

235
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,125
I'm going to
profit from their fight,

236
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:08,791
and then the beautiful
Rena's socks will be mine!

237
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:12,000
[REKI] And now Komiyan
the Third takes the lead!

238
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:15,041
The others are behind
him by a sizable margin.

239
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,208
Will the winner indeed
be Komiyan the Third?!

240
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,041
What?!

241
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,041
Anyone but him!

242
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:23,000
I've got to stop
that fool right now!

243
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,541
Re-NAAAA!

244
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,500
I'm coming for you!

245
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:31,166
My darling Re-NAAAAA!

246
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:35,166
[REKI] Of course it's not
that simple to reach the goal!

247
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,291
It's time for the
monster to appear!

248
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:43,708
Wha...?!

249
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:46,083
It's a special monster
just for the event!

250
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:47,250
If we defeat it,

251
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:48,833
we're sure to get
a rare item for sure!

252
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:51,541
It's a high-level
special event monster!

253
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,750
At last a worthy foe!

254
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,958
[BOTH] Attack!

255
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,291
[MIREILLE] Vak Don!!!

256
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,083
[OHKA] What?!
It's not even scratched!

257
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,916
No way!

258
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:20,875
Eh?

259
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,583
Ah?!

260
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,083
What's this?

261
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,250
Is it the same as before?

262
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,458
Shugo!

263
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,875
Whoa! Glad to see you!

264
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:38,208
Never let your
guard down, Shugo.

265
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,625
Is that...?

266
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,291
It's Lord Balmung!

267
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,458
Ion Strike!

268
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,333
So...

269
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,375
[BALMUNG] No!

270
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,250
Rena!

271
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:22,250
[SANJURO thinking] Shugo...
Only you can defeat it...

272
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,791
Oh...

273
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:29,166
Shishishi.
Now's my opportunity...

274
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,958
[RENA] Save me, Shugo!

275
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,916
Renaaaaaaa!

276
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:50,750
[SHUGO] Data... Drain!

277
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:57,083
Aieeee!

278
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,625
We did it!

279
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,333
That was outstanding, Shugo!

280
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:15,000
Hey, these are
rare items and I got 'em!

281
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,291
[BALMUNG] Reki, good work!

282
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,791
[SHUGO] Rena!

283
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,833
Rena! You all right?

284
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:29,250
Rena!

285
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,625
Thank you Lord Balmung,

286
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:37,291
for bravely saving me
from danger one more time.

287
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,375
How will I ever repay you?

288
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,125
Rena?

289
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:45,708
And now for the winner!
Congratulations Lord Balmung!

290
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,875
What's that?

291
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,583
Reki, what's the
meaning of this?

292
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,708
Didn't you say to me that
I was not to stop this event

293
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:53,625
no matter what the
circumstances, Lord Balmung?

294
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:55,750
So the race was still going on?

295
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,041
Now before we award
the prize for the event,

296
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:01,541
Lord Balmung, the winner, will
receive a kiss from our Orihime.

297
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:02,458
Eh?

298
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,708
Reki!

299
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:04,875
What was that?!

300
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,708
I simply followed
Lord Balmung's rules

301
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:10,041
and they are very clear about
the winner receiving a kiss.

302
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,583
[SHUGO] Whoa!

303
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:14,416
So how 'bout that kiss?

304
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,166
Oho, it looks like there

305
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,750
was a photo finish
in today's event.

306
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,583
We're about to see a shot
taken at the finish line.

307
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,583
[REKI] Oh! By a
mere point one seconds,

308
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,291
Shugo reached the goal first!

309
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,416
Shugo is the winner!

310
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,041
I am?

311
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,250
You're entitled to
the special prize

312
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,916
of a kiss from
Orihime to the winner.

313
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,250
What?

314
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,083
Uhm...

315
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,500
[REKI] Come on now, quickly.

316
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,416
[SHUGO] But, she's my sister...

317
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,750
[REKI] It doesn't
matter, come on,

318
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,458
we're all waiting...

319
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,500
So, uh, what should we do?

320
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:04,833
I guess we just
have to do this.

321
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:18,583
[cheering, whistling]

322
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,041
[gulps]

323
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:33,750
Huh?

324
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:41,166
[MIREILLE] Nonononono!

325
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:46,041
There was no forecast for
rain tonight on this server...

326
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,166
This isn't right.

327
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,666
Reki, stop the
event right now!

328
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,500
[REKI] But... But, sir, I...

329
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,791
Before anything else
unexpected begins happening,

330
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,416
you need to evacuate all
the participants immediately!

331
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,833
[REKI] The event
for the Festival

332
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,625
of the Weaver Maiden
is now over!

333
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:01,750
We will contact the winners
via the message board

334
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:02,958
in the very near future.

335
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:04,541
Thank you all!

336
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,458
It's really
raining--let's go home!

337
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,375
Uh, good idea!

338
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,250
Hey, Shugo?

339
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,875
So tell me what it is that
you wished for big brother.

340
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:23,875
[SHUGO] It's a secret.

341
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:27,708
[RENA] Big brothers can
be so weird sometimes.

342
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,625
[RENA] I've got
event information!

343
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:07,583
If you go to the area
Cursed Woodland Murderhouse

344
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,083
something will happen...

345
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:11,083
What do you mean by "something"?

346
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:14,458
What? Save me, Shugo!!
