1
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:53,125
[SHUGO]
Rena! Rena!

2
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:53,958
Rena!

3
00:01:57,958 --> 00:01:59,375
[SHUGO] She's just gone.

4
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:02,625
How could someone just disappear
like that without a trace?

5
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:03,916
[RENA] Oh, Shugo

6
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,333
[SHUGO] Rena!

7
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,583
[RENA] Shugo!

8
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:16,458
[SHUGO] Rena!

9
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:19,541
[SHUGO] It couldn't be her...

10
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:38,750
[OHKA] It's no good.

11
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,583
I couldn't find
a single trace of Rena

12
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:42,208
on that side
of the mansion.

13
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:43,750
Have you had any luck?

14
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:47,750
[HOTARU] No... no sign of Rena's
ghost on this side either.

15
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:57,458
[OHKA] It's a little early
to look like you've given up.

16
00:02:57,541 --> 00:03:00,083
[HOTARU] Shugo, try to
look on the bright side.

17
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,458
[SHUGO] What bright side?

18
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,750
She won't pick up the phone
back in the real world.

19
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,791
We can't find her
ghost anywhere in here.

20
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,750
Man, can someone tell me
what's going on in this place.

21
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:11,625
[OHKA] I agree, there's
nothing normal about it.

22
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:14,083
[HOTARU] Sanjuro sure
had a serious expression

23
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:17,291
when he went off to
search in that direction.

24
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,250
Maybe he found her?

25
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:20,875
[MIREILLE] Hey! Hey!

26
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,916
I think I have
an idea what's happening!

27
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,416
[SHUGO] Is that you,
Mireille?!

28
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,875
[OHKA] Do you always go around
searching under the floor?

29
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,875
[HOTARU]
What did you find out?

30
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,375
[SHUGO] Yeah!
What's going on?

31
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:33,083
[MIREILLE]
It's a special event!

32
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:35,583
[SHUGO] Eh! A special event?

33
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:36,666
[MIREILLE] That's right.

34
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,583
There's no other
possible explanation.

35
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:43,500
[SHUGO] Is that
part of the game?

36
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,416
[MIREILLE] Speaking from
my experience in The World,

37
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,583
I've come to the conclusion

38
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,583
that there's
no other thing it can be.

39
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,000
Just look at all the weird stuff

40
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,166
that's been happening
around Shugo since he got here.

41
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,708
[SHUGO] Well, I guess now
that you put it that way...

42
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,541
[OHKA] That's got to be it.

43
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,791
We have looked
all over for her

44
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,416
[HOTARU]
So I guess that means

45
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,333
she's gone to another area.

46
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,708
[MIREILLE]
So the race is on.

47
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,291
Let's get out of
this spooky place

48
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:08,458
and start looking for Rena.

49
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,000
Then we'll be the first
to clear the event

50
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,291
And then we'll get
some fabulous rare item!

51
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:16,125
[SHUGO] At least you could
act just a little worried

52
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:17,250
[MIREILLE]
It's a special event!

53
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,333
A special event!

54
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,250
[MIREILLE] Now, let's
put our plan in motion

55
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:31,166
to win the race
to save the missing Rena!

56
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,958
[MIREILLE] To start, I'll
go to the information shop

57
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,458
to check for any breaking
news on her whereabouts.

58
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,000
Everyone else
should spread out

59
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,250
and search for
her here in the city.

60
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:39,708
[SHUGO] Search for her here?

61
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,500
[MIREILLE] Let's go!

62
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,166
[OHKA] Alright, everyone.

63
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,375
Let's get going!

64
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,416
[HOTARU]
Where exactly are we going?

65
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,333
[OHKA] Into the crowd.

66
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,833
[SHUGO] Oh? R-Right!

67
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:53,833
[SHUGO] Since Rena is styled

68
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,125
after the legendary hero
character Black Rose,

69
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,250
someone must have seen her!

70
00:04:58,333 --> 00:04:59,583
They had to of.

71
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,083
If she's here,
I'm gonna find her!

72
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,416
All right, I'm coming, Rena!

73
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,958
A Player Character
styled after Black Rose.

74
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,791
There's someone like that?

75
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,875
[PC #4] Sorry I don't know.

76
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,333
[PC #7 Male Blade]
I can't say.

77
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,583
[KOMIYAN] Tres Bien!

78
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:18,791
There's Kunisaki!

79
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,333
So my beloved
Rena must be close at hand!

80
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,791
[KOMIYAN]
Oh Rena!

81
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:43,541
[SHUGO]
We've looked everywhere!

82
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,583
[FEMALE BLADE] Black Rose?

83
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,208
I think she was
in the park earlier.

84
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,583
[SHUGO] Let's go!

85
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:53,958
Thank you for your help.

86
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,250
[FEMALE BLADE] I'd heard people
talk about a Player Character

87
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,583
that looked just like
Black Rose here in The World

88
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:02,916
but I thought
it was just a rumor.

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,958
[SHUGO] Wha...?

90
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,541
Rena could be
anywhere in this place?

91
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:14,791
So This was the last
place she was seen?

92
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,208
[HOTARU] Y'know, a
thought just occurred to me

93
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:19,750
[SHUGO] What kind of thought?

94
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,416
[HOTARU] I thought that...

95
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,708
[OHKA] You thought what?

96
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:28,416
[HOTARU] ...we could
use little Grunty.

97
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,708
[SHUGO] Your Grunty?

98
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,250
[HOTARU] I was thinking of
giving the Grunty

99
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,250
Rena's scent to search for.

100
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,750
[OHKA] I wasn't aware that a
Grunty could do that.

101
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,083
[HOTARU] Oh, he can!

102
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,500
Because, he's grown
so much lately.

103
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:42,125
[SHUGO] I get it, since
Grunties are animals,

104
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:45,000
they must have a better
sense of smell than we do.

105
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,583
[SHUGO] Alright,
go forth, Grunty!

106
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:50,333
Now is the time you prove
your usefulness to us!

107
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:53,375
We're ready for your
nose to lead us to Rena!

108
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,875
[SHUGO] Wake up!

109
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:35,750
[SHUGO] How useless!

110
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:38,333
We need a real tracker.

111
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,916
[SHUGO] Hey! I've got it.

112
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,041
We could use man's best friend

113
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,500
to help us sniff
out Rena's trail!

114
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:49,625
[OHKA] A werewolf is not a dog!

115
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,541
[BALMUNG] Why are you late?

116
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,583
As I recall, you were
the one who contacted me.

117
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:05,916
[SANJURO] I'm sorry.

118
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,083
There was something
I was looking into.

119
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,791
[BALMUNG] Looking into?

120
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:10,875
That's quite unlike you.

121
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,958
[SANJURO] I had
no choice this time.

122
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,708
[BALMUNG] So, why did you call?

123
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,583
[SANJURO] Black Rose--

124
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:21,916
Rena has disappeared.

125
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,291
[SANJURO] What concerns me

126
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,958
is when she was killed by Death,

127
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,791
she disappeared without
becoming a ghost.

128
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:30,875
[REKI] There's no way!

129
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,583
That can't happen

130
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:41,791
[BALMUNG] Sanjuro...

131
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:44,666
[BALMUNG] There is one thing
that I am certain of...

132
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,458
[SHUGO] She's not here anywhere?

133
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:49,416
[HOTARU] No one just vanishes.

134
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,416
[SHUGO] Right!

135
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,375
This calls for an
all-area search!

136
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,833
[HOTARU] Rena, where are you?

137
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,708
[SHUGO] Rena!

138
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,416
[SHUGO] Rena?

139
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:20,750
[SHUGO] Rena...

140
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:24,291
But if I remember...

141
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,333
Rena used to get
lost all the time.

142
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,166
[SHUGO] Rena!

143
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,791
Rena!

144
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:53,125
[RENA] Shugo!

145
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,916
[RENA] Shugo!

146
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,333
[RENA] Hey Shugo?

147
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:01,875
[SHUGO] Eh? Yeah?

148
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:02,916
[RENA] Nothing.

149
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,291
Just say something funny.

150
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,625
Oh, okay

151
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:08,500
Um...

152
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:09,541
A cute puppy fell in the river.

153
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:10,416
Whoops!

154
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,625
Splash!

155
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,333
[RENA] Now, that's my
silly brother!

156
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:21,625
[RENA] Big brother!

157
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:23,500
Big Brother?

158
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:25,583
Big Brother?

159
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,708
Big Brother.

160
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:29,333
Big Brother.

161
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:33,625
Just say something funny okay?

162
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,416
[SHUGO] Rena!

163
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,000
[OHKA] Poor Shugo.

164
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,916
[HOTARU] He's really pouring his
heart out to find his sister.

165
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,250
[DAISUKE] Found him!

166
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,125
[Michi] There's no mistake,
it's Kite, alright.

167
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,958
He's searching here
of all places?

168
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,791
[KATUYUKI] Because of a slight
miscalculation last time,

169
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,833
we killed Black Rose
instead of Kite.

170
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,375
[Michi] This is good

171
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,416
Kite's lost his best friend
so his heart is wide open.

172
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,041
That'll make it easy for us.

173
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,125
[HAYATO] Just leave it up to
me

174
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,750
and it'll go
smoothly this time.

175
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,541
[DAISUKE] So, do you have a
plan to get him for sure?

176
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,083
[HAYATO] Oh yeah.

177
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:13,375
He'll be completely exposed and
deletable this time around.

178
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:16,416
It'll happen so fast he won't
even have time to Data Drain.

179
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:29,750
[MIREILLE] I see

180
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,916
So , there was no sign
of her trail anywhere.

181
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,750
Nothing.

182
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:35,458
What about you, Mireille?

183
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:36,791
[MIREILLE] Empty handed.

184
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,791
I couldn't find any particular
event information,

185
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,333
and no one I chatted
with had seen Rena.

186
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:42,666
[OHKA] Ah!

187
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,375
So I guess this isn't some
kind of event after all.

188
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,458
[SHUGO] Then...
where's Rena?

189
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,291
[MIREILLE] Ah, did
anyone think

190
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,833
that maybe she
just logged out?

191
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,916
[OHKA] Or she might
have just gotten scared

192
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,791
or hopelessly lost.

193
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,916
[HOTARU] And that would be okay.

194
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,125
Even if you die in the game,

195
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,458
it's not like you die
in the real world.

196
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,083
[OHKA] How is it you can talk
about expiring

197
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,333
with a big smile
on your face?

198
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:03,583
[HOTARU] Expiring...

199
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:06,208
it's not that hot in
here, is it?

200
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:07,416
[OHKA] Huh?

201
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,541
[MIREILLE] Anyway,
this is so strange.

202
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:10,375
I thought for sure this was all
some kind of event.

203
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:11,250
[SHUGO] Now I'm worried.

204
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:15,083
What could've happened to her?

205
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:15,791
[SHUGO] Eh?

206
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:16,625
[MIREILLE] What's up?

207
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:17,583
[HOTARU] What's wrong Shugo?

208
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:18,166
Did you hear something?

209
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,208
[SHUGO] New mail

210
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:20,958
[MIREILLE] It's got
to be from Rena!

211
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,291
Check it out quick!

212
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,791
[SHUGO] It says the
sender is unknown.

213
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,083
[HOTARU] Unknown?

214
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,500
[OHKA] So, does it say
anything worthwhile?

215
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:29,916
[SHUGO] It's a pretty
short message.

216
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,333
All it says is "Enraged
Dragon Queen."

217
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:34,333
[MIREILLE] That's got to
be an area name!

218
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:35,583
I'm sure of it

219
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,750
[MIREILLE] So it was a
special event after all!

220
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,583
[SHUGO] Huh? You think so?

221
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:44,416
[OHKA] A friend suddenly goes
missing

222
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,833
then a mail with no known sender
comes in

223
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:48,291
and all it contains is a
mysterious area name be careful.

224
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:52,583
[HOTARU] In other words

225
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:53,958
[MIREILLE] It's got to be
something really special

226
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,500
that ordinary players can't
see...

227
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,125
the ultimate special event and
it's all for us to discover!

228
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,375
Sounds like fun!

229
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:00,916
[SHUGO] If I go there do you
think Rena will

230
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,416
[MIREILLE] be waiting for you
within a dramatic Event!

231
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,333
[SHUGO] I get it!

232
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,250
After all, I did
win the costume

233
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:11,958
of Kite the Legendary
Hero right?

234
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,083
So it only makes sense
that a dramatic meeting,

235
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,333
worthy of such a hero,
is waiting with Rena

236
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:17,833
as the ultimate reward!

237
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:18,916
Let's go get her!

238
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,333
[HOTARU] Okay, let's go!

239
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,041
It's off to "Raging Drag Queen!"

240
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:37,041
[SHUGO] Agrh!

241
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,833
It looks like none of us packed
very well for the cold weather

242
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,083
[MIREILLE] Ahh!

243
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,500
Ohka!

244
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:44,666
You're the only one with a fur
coat, how unfair!

245
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,208
[OHKA] Stop it! Stop it!

246
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:50,416
[MIREILLE] How unfair!

247
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,875
[SHUGO] Whoa it's cold!

248
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,750
[HOTARU] I just feel sorry for
Rena

249
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,458
To be stuck all alone in
such a cold place like this

250
00:13:57,541 --> 00:14:00,416
[SHUGO] Rena...

251
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,083
[SHUGO] It-It'll be all right

252
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,916
She can be pretty good
at taking care of herself

253
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,458
when she needs to.

254
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,125
[SHUGO] Huh?

255
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,083
[SHUGO] Huh? This is odd

256
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,708
[MIREILLE] What, what?

257
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,291
[SHUGO] It's all steamy so I
can't really tell.

258
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,708
[OHKA] If it's some kind of a
monster, just leave it to me.

259
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,416
[MIREILLE] Hurry up, let's go!

260
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,666
[SHUGO] A hot spring?

261
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,875
What the heck is
this doing here?

262
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,583
[HOTARU] This is a Hot spring?

263
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,250
[MIREILLE] Lucky us!

264
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,958
Hey hey, what are
we waiting for?

265
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,125
When you're cold,

266
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,166
there's nothing like
a steaming hot bath!

267
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,500
[SHUGO] You guys, don't forget!

268
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,416
We're looking for Rena in
this area, don't forget.

269
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,958
This isn't the time to go
jumping into a hot tub!

270
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,125
[MIREILLE] Why not?

271
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:58,750
We're probably the
only ones in The World

272
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,916
lucky enough to
enjoy a Hot Spring!

273
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,083
How can we pass up a rare
opportunity like this one!

274
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,000
[SHUGO] Easy, just keep walking.

275
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,583
[MIREILLE] I wonder if
there's a possibility

276
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:09,916
that Shugo is embarrassed?

277
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,458
[SHUGO] N-No way!

278
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,208
It's just not the time
for any of us

279
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:14,916
to be getting into hot water.

280
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,541
[OHKA] No worries...

281
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:19,375
...we wouldn't let you
get in over your head.

282
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,375
[MIREILLE] Aaaah!

283
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,916
Now that's what I call
a hot hot spring!

284
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,833
I feel like my heart and soul
have been cleansed.

285
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:39,916
[HOTARU] Cleanse your heart?

286
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,666
How would you do
something like that?

287
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,416
Do you use shampoo?

288
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,875
Hotaru, what planet
are you from anyway?

289
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,333
[MIREILLE] Shugo!

290
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,583
What are you doing
way over there?!

291
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:55,541
It's not like we're actually
in some kind of co-ed hot tub!

292
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:56,583
Come on!

293
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:59,416
Oh, yeah, I guess you're right.

294
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,583
A hero should never be afraid
to take it easy once in a while!

295
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:03,958
[MIREILLE]
C'mon and join us!

296
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,916
Don't make us send Ohka
over there to fetch you.

297
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,916
[OHKA] You wouldn't want that...

298
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,250
[SHUGO] Whoa!
O-Ohka! Is that you?

299
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,916
What the heck are you doing?!

300
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,291
Hey, Shugo, what're you
doing with that Grunty?

301
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,375
Hey Grunty what are
you doing over there?

302
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:25,458
That Grunty sure seems
to like Shugo a lot.

303
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,166
[OHKA] They make a cute pair.

304
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,583
[SHUGO] Rena!

305
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:03,333
[RENA] Hi Shugo.

306
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:06,208
[SHUGO] W-Where were
you all this time?

307
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:09,791
[RENA] Sorry I worried you.
I'm okay!

308
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,083
[SHUGO] We looked for
you all over the place.

309
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,083
[RENA] I believed in you.

310
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,541
I knew...

311
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:19,166
...that you would
come for me, Shugo.

312
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,875
[SHUGO] Uh?

313
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:27,000
[RENA] I knew you would
come to find me for sure.

314
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,500
[SHUGO] Ah!

315
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:29,583
W-Wait Rena!

316
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:32,833
I got the point--
I got the point!

317
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:33,708
[OHKA] This is a nice
place for a reunion

318
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,250
[MIREILLE] You would never think

319
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,583
they were brother and sister
with a serious hug like that.

320
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,333
[HOTARU] What a beautiful sight.

321
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,708
[OHKA] Well, looks like our
search is finally over.

322
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:46,208
[RENA] I'm so glad
I waited for you

323
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,708
[RENA] I've been
waiting all this time

324
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:52,541
for you to come to
find me, Shugo.

325
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,250
[SHUGO] You're not Rena.
Who are you?

326
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:59,541
[RENA] What are
you talking about?

327
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:00,875
I'm Rena.

328
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:02,583
[SHUGO] No you're not.

329
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,250
[RENA] But, Shugo...

330
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:12,458
[SHUGO] I mean Rena would
never say things like that.

331
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:15,541
No way Rena would just sit
around all day and do nothing!

332
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,000
[RENA] Stop it, Shugo.

333
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,083
Stop it, Shugo!

334
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,250
[SHUGO] I would
know if you were Rena

335
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,625
'cause Rena is--

336
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,250
[RENA] Why?

337
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,541
Why won't you believe me?

338
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,875
[RENA] Why?

339
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:30,583
Why Shugo?

340
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:36,250
Get ready, Shugo!

341
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,666
[MIREILLE] The hot
springs are gone!

342
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,875
[OHKA] But how could
they... an illusion?

343
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,083
[HOT SPRINGS GEEZER]
Give your sister a little hug!

344
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,791
[MIREILLE] GiRai Don!

345
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,041
[SHUGO] Next time you're
thinking about saving me,

346
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,916
try not to kill me okay?

347
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,916
[MIREILLE] Don't be
so fussy about it

348
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,125
or there might not
be a next time.

349
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:58,208
Now get dressed or
you'll catch a cold.

350
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,583
[OHKA] It's one of those
modified monsters!

351
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,208
[OHKA] What's going on?

352
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,125
[MIREILLE] Ah!
That can't be good!

353
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,708
[HOT SPRINGS GEEZER]
Don't run away!

354
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:33,541
Stop and fight!

355
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:34,416
[SHUGO] That's it!

356
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,666
You can't insult my sister

357
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,125
by having her turn into a
monster like you!

358
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,208
[HOT SPRINGS GEEZER]
Farewell Big Brother!

359
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:44,791
[SHUGO] I'll be the
one saying farewell!

360
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,083
No one messes
with my sister!

361
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,291
Data Drain!

362
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,333
[Long Lived] Oh, it
looks like I'm just

363
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:00,916
a bit overdone.

364
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,958
Oh, what a world...
what a world!

365
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:19,375
[OHKA] So this wasn't
an event after all.

366
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:20,750
I wonder who that mail
could have been from?

367
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:21,791
[MIREILLE] I wonder...

368
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,583
M-Maybe this is
some kind of event,

369
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:26,333
only it's just the first part.

370
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,000
[SHUGO] Ah! Oh, it's you.

371
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:32,333
[BALMUNG] I understand
that Rena has disappeared.

372
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,333
[SHUGO] What do
you know about it?

373
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,625
Did you guys set
this special event up?

374
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,750
[BALMUNG] You can be assured
that we didn't take Rena,

375
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:41,250
but there are a few things
that you need to know.

376
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,125
Shugo, all of this
seems to be related

377
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:46,541
to the contest
you and you sister won,

378
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:49,416
and the Kite and Black Rose
characters you now resemble.

379
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,916
[REKI] That contest
was not official

380
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,541
and it was not run
by the CC Corporation.

381
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:54,875
It's something
that was contrived

382
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,541
outside of official channels.

383
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,125
[SHUGO] What does
that mean exactly?

384
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,625
And how do you know
so much about it?

385
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:02,958
[REKI]
Because Balmung and I

386
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:04,875
are System Administrators
for the CC Corporation.

387
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,333
[SHUGO]
System Administrators?

388
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:08,041
[MIREILLE]
Lord Balmung, too?

389
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,916
[BALMUNG] Shugo, this
is not a special event.

390
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:22,041
It's a very serious incident!

391
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,541
[SHUGO] Hello? Mom?!

392
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,375
[SHUGO gasps]
What happened to her?!

393
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,958
[SHUGO] Rena!

394
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,916
[RENA] I have information
for inquiring minds!

395
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,375
Everyone's after Shugo,

396
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:08,750
and The Heavy Blade named
Rena has fallen into a coma.

397
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:09,416
Huh?

398
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,583
I did?

399
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:12,083
I'm in trouble!

400
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:13,416
Hurry up, Shugo!
