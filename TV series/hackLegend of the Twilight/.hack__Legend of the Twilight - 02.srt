1
00:01:57,958 --> 00:01:59,833
[BALMUNG] Move that tree a
little more to the right.

2
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:01,708
It's difficult to see
the tree behind it.

3
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:02,958
[WORKER] Yes, sir.

4
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:07,250
Well done.

5
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:09,750
That's very good.
Please continue.

6
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:11,166
[WORKER] Thank you, sir.

7
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,500
Reki?

8
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:17,208
[REKI] Yes, sir.

9
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:18,625
I was looking into
your encounter

10
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:21,250
with the Super Shogun
the other day, Lord Balmung...

11
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:25,208
[REKI] There was no record of it
in the system management log.

12
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:28,416
An Armored Super Shogun
has never appeared in that area.

13
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:34,250
[BALMUNG] Is that so?

14
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:45,833
[BALMUNG] So then,
what was it I fought?

15
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,625
Uh, Lord Balmung?

16
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,625
[BALMUNG] Please continue
with the investigation.

17
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,958
The personnel in
system management

18
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,666
are professionals
at managing data.

19
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,875
[REKI] Yes, sir.

20
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:03,083
Hmph. This event is
shaping up very nicely.

21
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,541
It'll be amongst
the best I've had

22
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:06,541
a hand in creating
in a long time.

23
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:09,291
Yeah, you say that
every time, sir...

24
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,333
Huh? Lord Balmung.

25
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,208
[SHUGO] Huh? You're back?

26
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:26,000
[FATHER] Yeah. I was on the
road and just stopped by.

27
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,083
I have to go back
to the office now.

28
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,125
I don't know if
I'll be home tonight.

29
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,666
Just do what you
want for dinner.

30
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,125
Oh...

31
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:36,750
[FATHER] Okay then.

32
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:45,166
'kay! Let's get going.

33
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,833
[SHUGO] Where is she...?

34
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,458
Hi Shugo!

35
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:03,333
Sorry to keep you wait--

36
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:04,416
You're late!

37
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,500
Ah! I-I said I'm sorry.

38
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:10,041
I wasn't THAT late... Hmm? Huh?

39
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:14,958
Aren't you that hunter...

40
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:18,666
The Rare Hunter of Love and
Courage, Mireille, remember?!

41
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,875
Hey, hey, where
are you going today?

42
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,708
Can I come with you?
Can I? Can I? Please?

43
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,208
We haven't decided where...

44
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,333
Then I shall be
your trusted guide.

45
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:28,500
[RENA] C'mon Shugo!

46
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:32,333
We are so outta here!
Speed Charm!

47
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:34,000
HEEEY!

48
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,041
[RENA] Buh-bye.

49
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:39,500
It's not very nice to
use <i>that</i> charm here!

50
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:50,833
As it turns out I've been
burned pretty badly before.

51
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,125
Oh, my goodness.

52
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:55,041
You've been burned?
I'm so sorry to hear that.

53
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:58,250
No, uh, that's not really
what I meant to say...

54
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:01,541
Hm... How can I say
it more clearly...?

55
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,416
Please, just say
whatever you'd like.

56
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,125
Looks like we've lost her.

57
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:07,958
Y'know I wouldn't
actually mind going

58
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,041
on an adventure
with that Rare Hunter.

59
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:13,458
I want to explore The World
with you, Shugo, not with her.

60
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,166
That's why we're here.

61
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,166
[SHUGO] Ah... Rena...

62
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,250
Hey... What's that?

63
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,750
[RENA] It's an event notice.

64
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,958
Whenever there is an event,
that's how it's advertised.

65
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:26,791
[SHUGO] Wow! I had no idea.

66
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:29,000
This one's for a
flower-viewing event

67
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,291
You can read that?

68
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,791
Well of course!

69
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:35,875
"Heroes, gather at the area,
Voluptuous Cherry Maze!

70
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:39,250
I look forward to the
blooming of glorious blossoms."

71
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,291
So, that actually
means something?

72
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:44,250
In other words, we need to go
to the area that it mentions,

73
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,916
then we need to figure out
how to make the flowers bloom.

74
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,666
If you can successfully
clear the event,

75
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,458
then you get some rare item
to add to your inventory.

76
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:53,375
Hey! Sounds like fun!

77
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:54,583
Wanna go?

78
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,333
Can anyone enter an event?

79
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:57,875
Oh, of course!

80
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:01,750
We'll use the gate to go to
Voluptuous Cherry Maze... Ah...

81
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:02,583
Is something wrong?

82
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:03,958
[RENA] It says here:

83
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,291
"Various skills are
required to clear this event."

84
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:09,166
Shugo, It might be difficult
for us to clear this event

85
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,041
without a Wavemaster
in our party.

86
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,583
A Wavemaster?

87
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,333
Guess what?
I'm a Wavemaster.

88
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:22,125
Maybe we can join forces and
clear out this event together?

89
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,958
Lucky us!!

90
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:39,041
Uh... This area is
Voluptuous Cherry Maze?

91
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,041
[MIREILLE] I don't get it.

92
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,958
They're not blooming at all!

93
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:45,250
[RENA] This is an event
to make them bloom!

94
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,791
Cherry blossoms... Oh...

95
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,583
Might as well
get started. Repth!

96
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:01,916
Nothing happened.

97
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,541
Did I miss something?

98
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:04,500
Uh...

99
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,708
Try this one... Pha Repth!

100
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:15,125
It doesn't look like recovery
spells are the answer here.

101
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,708
I got it, you
have to give water

102
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,708
to flowers to make
them bloom, right?

103
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,333
Water, yeah!

104
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:22,833
Yeah!

105
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,208
Rue Rom!

106
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,708
I guess that
wasn't it either...

107
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,083
[RENA] Hang on a second!

108
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:44,375
Try something that doesn't
get us all soaking wet.

109
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:45,625
Ah! Maybe what we need

110
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:48,041
is some kind of item
to help us out here.

111
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,875
I'll just go look for one!

112
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,750
Hey! Come baaaack!

113
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,125
Oh, man.

114
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:57,000
Now my costume's gotten
all soaked and ruined.

115
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,875
Breathtaking
like the dew drops

116
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:01,000
on a spring morning, isn't she?

117
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,708
Takes your breath
away, for sure.

118
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:11,166
Uh, what's that?

119
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,500
Uh, I didn't say anything.

120
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:27,416
There's nothing like
it to quench the thirst.

121
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,583
What is still lacking...
the flowers... yes.

122
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,250
[REKI] Lord Balmung...

123
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,541
Hey, what are you doing
hanging out here at this hour,

124
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:38,500
when today's event
has already started...

125
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:41,333
[REKI] Oh, ah...
you wrote code for sake?

126
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,541
You can't feel it's
effects here, you know?

127
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:44,750
Don't say that.

128
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:45,791
This is "refined."

129
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:46,875
Yeah, yeah.

130
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,750
And obviously it's
impossible for me

131
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,666
to have a sense of "refinement."

132
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,666
[BALMUNG]
So, about that monster...

133
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,666
[REKI] It's still
undergoing investigation.

134
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,291
Given who it is
we're dealing with...

135
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:59,166
This one's going
to take me some time.

136
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,500
[REKI] It seems that no one
has solved the event yet...

137
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,625
[BALMUNG] The landscape
remains dismal...

138
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:08,250
The beautiful sake sheds tears.

139
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,333
[REKI] Perhaps the
event was too difficult?

140
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,958
It's all common sense.

141
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,708
The heroes have returned...

142
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,958
Cherry blossoms...

143
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:32,250
When we were young,
we used to go see them a lot.

144
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:43,208
[children laughing]

145
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,833
[MOTHER] Shugo! Rena! Let's eat!

146
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,708
[FATHER] Or we'll eat it first.

147
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,041
[MOTHER]
Come on you two!

148
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,833
[YOUNG RENA] We won't let you!

149
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:58,916
Those were
some good times...

150
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
[SHUGO] Sometimes I wonder...

151
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:07,875
I wonder if fallen cherry
blossoms can be brought back?

152
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,333
[RENA] Shugo,
we need to figure out

153
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:14,250
a way to make those flowers
bloom, don't you think.

154
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,375
Huh? Yeah.

155
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,375
[dog barks]

156
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:26,666
[SHUGO] Hey, Rena!
It's a dog--a big doggie!

157
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:32,250
Give me your paw! Down. Again.

158
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,083
[SHUGO] It really likes me!

159
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:39,750
[RENA] You really like animals

160
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,375
don't you, big brother?

161
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:44,708
It's too bad Mom was allergic
and we never got one.

162
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,541
I wonder where
it came from?

163
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:47,833
Do you think I can get one?

164
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,250
Uh, I don't remember reading

165
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:52,875
about there being any dog
raising here in The World.

166
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,583
I want one!

167
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:56,291
[BALMUNG] You want one?

168
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:57,833
Yeah, you bet!

169
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,083
[SHUGO]  Hey, I know you.

170
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:03,041
You're that guy
who saved us before.

171
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,833
That's Lord Balmung!

172
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:08,125
Whaddya mean...
"Lord" Balmung.

173
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:14,500
So, Kite...
and BlackRose...

174
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,041
That's right!

175
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,083
I've read about this before!

176
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:24,083
"Beneath the blooming cherry
trees are buried corpses!"

177
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,958
I haven't spotted any
conspicuous items nearby so,

178
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:30,750
if I unearth a corpse or two,
the cherries just have to bloom.

179
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,916
A character contest?

180
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,500
Yeah! It was a great victory.

181
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,250
My name is Rena.

182
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:40,750
The one here in the Kite costume
is my twin brother, Shugo!

183
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,125
Hello.

184
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:45,250
Rena... Shugo...

185
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,083
[BALMUNG]
That bracelet...

186
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,125
[SHUGO] Oh, this...

187
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,875
I got it... from
a girl all in white.

188
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:57,708
I guess there must
have been some kind of

189
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:00,458
special event attached
to this character.

190
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:03,375
She told me, "Only you
can save this world,"

191
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,041
then she gave this to me.

192
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,500
Please help...

193
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,375
[BALMUNG thinking]
Aura...?

194
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:17,375
[MIREILLE] Ah! I found it!

195
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,458
I knew I was right
about this one!

196
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:23,083
If I make the flowers bloom,
the rare item will be mine!

197
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,416
Ah... you gotta
be kiddin' me!

198
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,125
A Fighting Bones?

199
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,208
[SHUGO] Uhm... How come
you've been so quiet

200
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,666
for such a long time?

201
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:49,000
You can tell us,
if something is bothering you.

202
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:52,000
Or is it really that you want
this bracelet for yourself?

203
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,458
Hey, Shugo!

204
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:54,958
Don't insult Lord Balmung
after what he's done for us.

205
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,333
Hey, it was only a little joke!

206
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,666
[BALMUNG] If only it were...

207
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,416
Huh?

208
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,333
Lord Balmung,
I know it's a little late

209
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,875
but could you tell me something?

210
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,500
[BALMUNG] Mm?

211
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:13,416
Uh, back at the
dangerous spot the other day...

212
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,416
...when you came in
and saved me...

213
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,750
[MIREILLE]
Heeeelp!!

214
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:34,916
[MIREILLE] No way!!!

215
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,166
Mireille?

216
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,250
What's going on?

217
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,458
What's going on?

218
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,875
And why is there a
Fighting Bones here anyway?

219
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,125
Is it supposed to
be part of the event?

220
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,625
Impossible.

221
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,750
I never intended for there
to be monsters in this event!

222
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,000
Lord Balmung!

223
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,416
Reki? Was it you?!

224
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,666
It wasn't me, sir!

225
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,083
I don't have that
kind of time to waste!

226
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,250
[SHUGO] Is that monster strong?

227
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,791
[RENA] Insanely strong!
If they put one in here,

228
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:16,416
there'd be no way
for a newbie to enter.

229
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,083
Vak Revolver!

230
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:40,625
[BALMUNG] That can't be...

231
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:41,375
No way!

232
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:42,416
It's reviving!

233
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,416
[BALMUNG] Reki!
It's dangerous here!

234
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,625
Evacuate all player
characters from this area!

235
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:47,750
Yes, sir.

236
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:48,833
All of you should
get out of this area

237
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,541
as quickly as you can!

238
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:56,958
What's happening to this game?

239
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,458
Rena!

240
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:05,791
Oh, Shugo!

241
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:08,541
Rena!

242
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,291
Shugo! Help!

243
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:15,375
Rena! Data... Drain!

244
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,208
Wh-Why can't I move my sword?

245
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:39,708
Could the Data Drain
be affecting

246
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:42,041
everyone in the immediate area?

247
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,916
[MIREILLE] This is for
scaring me half to death!

248
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,708
Vak Don! Vak Don! Vak Don!

249
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,083
Oh! Why won't my spells work?

250
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,875
Rena... Hey, are you all right?

251
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:55,958
Oh, my Shugo!

252
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,500
Eh?

253
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,166
I... really...

254
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,125
...LOVE YOU, Shugo!

255
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,958
Rena... What are
you doing? Stop it!

256
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:13,333
Oh, you are soooo brave.

257
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:15,625
Rena... you know...

258
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,666
we're brother and sister.
You're freaking me out.

259
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,833
[OHKA] Shugo!

260
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,083
[OHKA] Shugo!
Leave the rest to me!

261
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,833
Uh, who said that?

262
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:40,583
Oh...

263
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,750
Well, that was my
first transformation,

264
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:45,041
I guess I just blew
my cover completely, huh?

265
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:48,250
[MIREILLE] Ohka!
Ohka's fighting with us!

266
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,583
[SHUGO] She's a friend of yours?

267
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,625
[MIREILLE]
Yup! Divine Fist Ohka!

268
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:54,583
One of the most famous
melee fighters in The World!

269
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:57,458
She's INCREDIBLY strong!

270
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,916
[OHKA] Shugo, you know
you're wrong about one thing.

271
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,250
Eh?

272
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,083
Man, how brittle...

273
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,208
you must have
a calcium deficiency.

274
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,833
[OHKA] And I'm not
a dog I'm a wolf.

275
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:23,166
Actually I'm a
werewolf, to be specific.

276
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,125
You're a werewolf?

277
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,291
And I'm not
through with you yet!

278
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,958
Divine Fist Ohka...

279
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:44,083
There can be no doubt
she deserves her reputation.

280
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,583
So strong...

281
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:59,166
[MIREILLE] She truly
is Divine Fist Ohka!

282
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:06,166
The effects of the Data Drain
have finally worn off...

283
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,208
Uh, Shugo,
what am I doing here with you?

284
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,875
Rena? You're all right now?

285
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,166
[RENA] Put me down, Shugo!

286
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,291
Ok, I'll put you down but
you're the one that said, uh...

287
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:19,416
Oh, wow!

288
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,708
Strange things are
certainly happening

289
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,833
around Shugo and Rena again.

290
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:25,333
Oh, those limited-
edition characters!

291
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,041
Hey, Mireille!
Don't look now but...

292
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,541
It can't be!

293
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:38,291
Your spells you cast earlier
are finally taking effect.

294
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:51,208
Aww! The cherry trees!

295
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,625
That's it!

296
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,291
The Old Man Who
Made the Flowers Bloom!

297
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,875
The Old Man Who did what?

298
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,083
[SHUGO]
The old folk tale!

299
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,708
Upon the withered trees...

300
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,666
Let's make the flowers bloom!

301
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:17,208
Yes, that's correct!

302
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:18,416
[MIREILLE]
All right then!

303
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,375
Juk Rom!

304
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,291
Ahhh...

305
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,791
[REKI] I don't understand.

306
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,125
Why did the Fighting
Bones appear...?

307
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,875
Was it a data corruption?

308
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:06,166
Right now, too many
things are worrying me.

309
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,125
[BALMUNG]
But now...

310
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,958
Just for this moment...

311
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,375
Let us enjoy the
wondrous cherry blossoms.

312
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:16,750
[REKI] Uh... Yes, sir.

313
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:19,708
[MIREILLE] Ah! We found it!
We got the rare item!

314
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:22,833
Shugo was the one

315
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:24,416
that cleared today's
event, remember.

316
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,791
The item is his...

317
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:29,125
Ah! Rare item!!! I want it!!
I want it!! I want it!!

318
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,291
[MIREILLE] What is it?!
What is it?! What is it?!

319
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:32,083
Oooh...?

320
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,541
[OHKA] Chill out Mireille.

321
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,541
[SHUGO] Uh... What is this?

322
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:40,000
It looks kinda
like a dog collar...

323
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,416
That doesn't
make much sense.

324
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,125
Oh! It's about the Old Man
Who Made Flowers Bloom.

325
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,666
Hey, didn't he have a
dog in that story?

326
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,875
So this has to be its collar!

327
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:55,000
[SHUGO] Are you kidding me?!
What am I going to do with this?

328
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:58,666
You can't raise dogs
in The World, can you?

329
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,166
You could always...

330
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,500
...put it on me,
if you felt like it.

331
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:06,000
I wouldn't mind it... fly boy.

332
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:08,583
Uh, yeah... I don't...

333
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,291
That sounds like a good idea.

334
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:11,541
[RENA] Uh, Shugo!

335
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,708
I just remembered
I have to go make dinner!

336
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,083
Let's go, NOW!

337
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,958
That girl is certainly
serious about making dinner.

338
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,333
I'll treasure this
necklace always.

339
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:23,208
If you ever need me
just send me a message.

340
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:03,916
[RENA] I've got
information on items!

341
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,916
If you go to the area
Blazing Purgatory Valley

342
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,250
you can supposedly get a
hold of a Phoenix Feather.

343
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:13,125
Hey, Shugo, this is
your chance to be a hero!

344
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:14,291
...Or not.

345
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,041
Hey, who is that?!
