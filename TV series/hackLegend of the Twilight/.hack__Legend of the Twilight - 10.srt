1
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:52,083
[DOCTOR]
So tell me again,

2
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:53,916
How many people does this make?

3
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,916
[DOCTOR B] Well, I don't
have the latest count, Doctor.

4
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,458
The talk is that the entire
CC Corporation staff fell

5
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:00,916
mysteriously ill.

6
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,416
[DOCTOR] And all of this
is because of that game?

7
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,791
[DOCTOR B]
Well, the research team

8
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,750
hasn't found anything
conclusive yet, I'm afraid.

9
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:09,208
[DOCTOR]
All these comatose people,

10
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:11,291
and they were all
playing that game?

11
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:13,416
That has to have
raised some suspicions.

12
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,375
[DOCTOR B]
Yeah, you do have a point.

13
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:16,833
[DOCTOR]
Games...

14
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:19,000
The effect of virtual
reality on the subconscious

15
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:21,083
has been the subject of
quite a bit of analysis

16
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:23,750
in various research
circles, but...

17
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:26,458
...these cases are particularly
difficult to connect.

18
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:27,500
[DOCTOR B]
You're right.

19
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:31,583
[EXECUTIVE] That is the final
decision of the committee.

20
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:34,333
Reki, I will leave
the rest to you.

21
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:35,375
[REKI]
Yes, sir.

22
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:36,750
[EXECUTIVE]
As you no doubt know,

23
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:39,791
Kamui followed Balmung
and is no longer assigned.

24
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,666
And with Magi in a coma,

25
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,000
You are the only qualified
employee remaining.

26
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:46,708
Yes. Thank you, sir.
I understand.

27
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,750
[EXECUTIVE] It is the earnest
desire of this company

28
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,666
that an end be
put to this affair.

29
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,916
We are reporting to the
media that the true cause

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,583
of the incident was
no more than a prank

31
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:58,541
started by three
juvenile miscreants.

32
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,208
So there won't be a
public announcement

33
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,875
about that wandering A.I.?

34
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:04,375
[EXECUTIVE] We are
leaving that up to you.

35
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:07,083
Reki, you are the
only qualified person

36
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:10,208
to speak to the
technical specifics.

37
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,875
Understood. It's just...

38
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,875
...that the incident
was so much more

39
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:15,583
than just an incident.

40
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:16,666
[EXECUTIVE]
Of course.

41
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,875
I will approve the usage

42
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:20,416
of System Management
Clause three eighteen.

43
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,458
Regarding investigation of the
incident within the system,

44
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:28,750
your authority over the matter
is now entirely unrestricted.

45
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:29,750
Hey, hey!

46
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,250
Did you read the paper?

47
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:34,041
Yeah, not a word of it
came out in the press today.

48
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,583
Not the truth about the incident

49
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,750
or even a hint about
what had happened.

50
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:40,916
I hear it's even worse
inside the CC Corporation.

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,208
Even if something did happen,

52
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,916
they're saying
it's not their fault.

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,458
Well, thanks to those guys,

54
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:48,708
we can all still be in The World
and figure it out together.

55
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:51,416
It's certainly a warm
tropic on the boards.

56
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,041
Uh, I think you mean
it's a hot topic.

57
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,541
Jeez, no one knows the truth
about what really happened,

58
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:58,708
so they're saying
anything they want

59
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,541
out there on the boards.

60
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,750
I heard that someone wrote
that the Cerulean Knights

61
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,875
were all blasted
by some cursed item.

62
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,041
Or that they figured out

63
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:07,916
how to cast spells
in the real world.

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,166
Or that they all came
down with food poisoning.

65
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,833
Or that they were
somehow all hypnotized.

66
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,333
[OHKA] You guys have way too
much free time, don't you?

67
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:16,458
[MIREILLE]
What do you mean?

68
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:17,500
[SHUGO]
Rena...

69
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,833
[REKI]
Well-qualified, he calls me.

70
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,208
Why should I have to deal

71
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,625
with a mountain of paperwork
and press conferences

72
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:29,291
and behind-the-scenes
construction projects

73
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:32,541
and golf business trips and
all the telephone complaints?

74
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:40,416
And here I am, caught
between two worlds.

75
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,458
[slapping noise]

76
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,625
[SANJURO] The World is
much more comfortable

77
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,791
than what reality
has to offer, huh?

78
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,458
It doesn't feel
that way right now.

79
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,041
[SANJURO] What are you
plotting now, Reki?

80
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:55,750
[REKI] Huh?

81
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:56,916
You betrayed Balmung,

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,833
then you made Kamui
lose her position.

83
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:01,333
And most recently, you
leaked information to us.

84
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:02,833
Those aren't the
things one would expect

85
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,833
from a loyal person.

86
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,708
Hey, wait, it's like
you're trying to paint me

87
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,416
as some kind of bad guy
in all that's happened.

88
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,208
So then what's your point?

89
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,541
You're not doing all of this

90
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,875
just so you can take
Balmung's position, are you?

91
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,208
It didn't take me
long to realize

92
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,875
that the job of
System Administrator

93
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:22,250
is a tough one, even for
someone like Balmung.

94
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,041
[SANJURO]
So it is true!

95
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,458
No, Sanjuro.

96
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:28,916
I'd thank you for overestimating
me, but I'm no big shot,

97
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
let alone qualified enough
to be an administrator.

98
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:35,958
So for now, that is one job
I have no desire to pursue.

99
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:39,833
[REKI]
Well, then.

100
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,375
Strange young man.

101
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,791
Okay! Let's go!

102
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,458
Let's go where?

103
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:51,500
Well, isn't it obvious?
We're going to find Rena!

104
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,375
[MIREILLE] Shugo, it
hasn't been that long

105
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,666
since our last attempt.

106
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,416
But we're so close!

107
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,833
That wandering A.I.
can destroy an entire area

108
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,416
right underneath our feet.

109
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,708
We have to be careful not to end
up like those Cerulean Knights.

110
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:07,000
So what do you
think we should do?

111
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:09,333
[SANJURO] First of all,
we must be level-headed.

112
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,666
From now on, we
can't just rush forward

113
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,583
without first using our heads.

114
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,125
[SHUGO] But we're
running out of time!

115
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,750
I understand.

116
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,875
But a wandering A.I.
is our enemy now.

117
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,083
Um...

118
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,000
I've been wondering
about this for a while.

119
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,000
What is a wandering A.I.?

120
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,166
It's unused
non-player character data

121
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,958
that learned its
own consciousness.

122
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,958
[OHKA] I can't believe
a non-player character

123
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:33,750
could have that much power.

124
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,833
You may not believe it,
but it's happened.

125
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,791
Then are you saying
we give up on Rena?

126
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,958
[SANJURO] No!
That's not it at all!

127
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,916
It's just...
We saw her.

128
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,625
[RENA]
Shugo, wait!

129
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:48,625
[SHUGO]
Rena?

130
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,375
[RENA]
Shugo!

131
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:51,291
[SHUGO]
Rena!

132
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:54,583
[RENA]
Shugo!

133
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:55,625
But then...

134
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,958
I couldn't...

135
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,291
I couldn't do
anything to help her.

136
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:05,416
But hey!

137
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,250
We do have the bracelet, right?

138
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,000
With this thing,
we can do anything!

139
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,291
Not we.

140
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,708
You are the only one
who controls the bracelet.

141
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,625
There are no second
chances anymore.

142
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:19,458
Don't forget that there
are lives at stake here.

143
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:25,916
Let's think all
of this through

144
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,208
and meet again tomorrow
to decide our path.

145
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,041
Don't forget to get some rest.

146
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,166
So many of them.

147
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,625
[RENA]
My friends.

148
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:28,166
They must have come
searching for me.

149
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:34,333
I won't give up until I see
every one of them again.

150
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,500
Shugo.

151
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,916
[SHUGO]
Rena!

152
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,500
You're healthy
and happy now.

153
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,583
And we have Shugo
to thank for all of that.

154
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,333
Isn't that right, Grunty?

155
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:13,583
Ha!

156
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,125
You're my brother
Shugo, right?

157
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,541
Whoa!

158
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,458
Could you be...

159
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:54,916
...Rena?

160
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,583
My little twin sister?
Rena? Is it you?

161
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,333
Bingo!

162
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,458
It's sure been
awhile, big brother.

163
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:06,291
And it's our first time
meeting in character.

164
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,416
I'm Rena the Heavy Blade!

165
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,791
Nice to meet you.

166
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:10,833
[SHUGO]
Rena.

167
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,375
I swear,

168
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,125
even if I have to do it alone...

169
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,166
Huh?

170
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,458
[SANJURO]
Took you long enough.

171
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,791
Sanjuro. You're here.

172
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,500
For a student to get
up later than his master--

173
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:27,541
no excuse.

174
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,125
[SANJURO]
What are you doing?

175
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,416
You can't train
just by standing there.

176
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,541
All right!

177
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:47,166
[OHKA] Just the two of you,
off to some secret training?

178
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,875
If you want to level up,

179
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,083
you can't just go out

180
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,000
and fight your everyday
monsters, you know.

181
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,791
[GRUNTY squeaking]

182
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,208
He says...

183
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,625
...he wants to see
Rena again, too.

184
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,750
[MIREILLE] How rude, making a
lady wait here all by herself.

185
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:11,791
Mireille?

186
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,166
I want to see what
kind of ultra-rare items 

187
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,625
we can find in
those strange servers,

188
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,875
otherwise I'll never finish.

189
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:22,583
Mireille...

190
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:26,958
[MIREILLE] Besides, if The
World becomes unusable to us,

191
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:30,250
then all the rare items I've
collected will go to waste.

192
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,958
Once we start this adventure,

193
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:36,625
you know we can't turn back.

194
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:37,958
Of course!

195
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,041
I have no hang-ups.

196
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,750
You know me. I'm
in 'til the end.

197
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,708
And I bought a lot of
medicine to heal us.

198
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,791
Thanks everyone. So much.

199
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:56,083
All right! Let's go!

200
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:57,125
[ALL]
Yeah!

to... knowledge...

203
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,166
[BALMUNG]
Here.

204
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,958
Two-to-three pawn,

205
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,833
and then five-to-six the bishop.

206
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,083
I can't win.

207
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,083
[REKI]
But who did you lose to?

208
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,125
Huh?

209
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,208
Hey again.

210
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,833
How come you logged
into The World,

211
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:49,166
then came all the way out
here just to play shogi?

212
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,833
Especially alone.

213
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,708
Haven't you interfered enough?

214
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,583
I'm just a regular player now,
so why don't you leave?

215
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:58,416
You're acting like a regular
player, that's for sure.

216
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:02,291
[BALMUNG] Why did you
come all the way out here?

217
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,750
Maybe to make fun of you.

218
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,083
[REKI]
That would be a lie, though.

219
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:10,875
Can I...

220
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,208
...talk to you about the past?

221
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:15,250
I was wondering
about the differences

222
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,875
between then and now?

223
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,291
What do you mean?

224
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,625
Must've been amazing fighting
side-by-side with Kite.

225
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,541
Or maybe it really is better
as an ex-administrator,

226
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,958
sulking all alone
out here in the woods.

227
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,250
Back then, you were
just a regular player

228
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,750
at the time of the first
Twilight, weren't you?

229
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:39,458
Yes, that's correct.

230
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,750
Reki, I understand.
Thank you!

231
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,833
[REKI] Balmung,
take this with you.

232
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:48,500
A master key card?

233
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,208
Reki!

234
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,750
[BALMUNG yelling]

235
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,083
Lord Balmung,

236
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,833
teleporting would be
much faster than running.

237
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,000
The Capitol of Illusion.

238
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,416
Nebel Mond.

239
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,791
Good plan.

240
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,583
Now that we're at the
private sector's Root Town,

241
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:21,000
we won't have to waste
time hacking every gate

242
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,000
we want to use.

243
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,500
That area with the
wandering A.I.

244
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,625
is connected to Nebel Mond.

245
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:26,708
We don't have much time,

246
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,083
but if we keep
searching this server...

247
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,500
...we'll find Rena.

248
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,166
A town with no people?

249
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,208
It's too quiet.

250
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,250
This place
doesn't feel right.

251
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:48,416
[HOTARU] As long as there
are no monsters, it's fine.

252
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,000
From this point on,

253
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:53,208
it would be best to assume that
common sense no longer applies.

254
00:14:58,625 --> 00:14:59,458
--Whoa!
--Whoa!

255
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:00,541
[SANJURO]
That's impossible!

256
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,375
A monster hunting
in the Root Town?

257
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,833
[RENA] I've walked
all over this place,

258
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:15,750
but the only landmark seems
to be the dungeon's entrance.

259
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:19,416
I guess this area must
still be under construction.

260
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,875
The data isn't complete,
so it isn't stable.

261
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:24,791
That's why I managed
to see Shugo fighting

262
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:27,041
in that other area.

263
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:29,500
We were so close.

264
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:30,833
Shugo.

265
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:14,416
[RENA]
I give up.

266
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,916
No matter which way I go,

267
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,541
I end up back
in this same place.

268
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,208

Who are you?

271
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,625
How did you find this place?

272
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,291
What is this?

273
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:44,416
[A.I.]
Death.

274
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:46,416
Death?

275
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,666
In order for me to
transcend death,

276
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,708
it is important that
I first understand it.

277
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,083
[RENA]
I don't get it.

278

I've been...

279
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,916
...thinking about
death for a while.

280

How could it...

some kind of protection

magic left in me.

How can our physical
attacks be no good?

299

Somehow we have
to put a stop

00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,125
Yes. Understood.

325
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,583
[A.I.]
I must go.

326
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:54,750
You--You have to go where?

327
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:57,125
I must transcend death.

328
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:00,583
Wait a minute!

329
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,208
Please wait!

330
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:11,666
Thanks, Balmung.

331
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,666
Y'know, if you were
planning on showing up,

332
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,666
you could have dropped
in a little bit sooner.

333
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,125
Well, I couldn't let
you guys have all the fun.

334
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:22,791
I don't think
now is the time

335
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,750
for us to begin celebrating.

336
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,416
Something's coming.

337
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,083
It's her again!

338
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,750
The Wandering A.I..

339
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:37,666
I am known by
the name of Morti.

340
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:03,458
[RENA]
This is no event.

341
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:06,250
What is this hand of evil
that creeps towards us?

342
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:07,708
What is Morti?

343
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:09,291
What time is it?

344
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:11,208
But I'm sure Shugo can do it!

345
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:12,333
C'mon, Big Brother!

346
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:14,291
I believe in you!
