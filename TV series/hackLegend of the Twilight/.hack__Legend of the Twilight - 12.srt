1
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:49,083
[MORTI] Death to all
Player Characters.

2
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:52,958
And a "true death" will
come to this world...

3
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:59,291
[BALMUNG] Fireball Storm!

4
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:03,916
[MONSTER growling]
[SANJURO] Thunderbolt!

5
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,750
[OHKA] Absolute Zero!

6
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:13,791
[MIREILLE]
Raining Rocks!

7
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,250
[MIREILLE]
N-No way!

8
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:22,333
Our items aren't
having any effect!

9
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:27,083
[MIREILLE] Aw! That virus is
ruining my rare costume!

10
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:28,583
[OHKA] At this rate,
before we destroy it,

11
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,666
we'll all be ruined!

12
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:35,958
[RENA] Uh, Shugo...

13
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:37,333
[SHUGO] There's no way...!

14
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:38,708
[KOMIYAN] K-Kunisaki!

15
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,041
[SHUGO] How did...
Why're you still here?

16
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:42,083
[KOMIYAN] Still here?

17
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,708
Where is this place?

18
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:46,416
Where's the Chaos Gate
outta here?!

19
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,875
[SHUGO] Sorry, I don't have
time to chat with you now!

20
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,250
[KOMIYAN] Hey!

21
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:52,958
What happened to your outfit?

22
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:56,500
Did you get some weird curse
cast on you or somethin'?

23
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:02,291
[SHUGO] Wha?

24
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:16,166
[SHUGO] Komiyama, how come
your costume isn't infected?

25
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,583
[KOMIYAN] What does that mean?

26
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,750
[SHUGO] You know Rena's
member address, right?

27
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,083
[KOMIYAN] Of course!

28
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,750
I send her daily emails
about my great adventures!

29
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,166
[SHUGO] Then...

30
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,541
Why aren't you infected
with the virus like all of us?

31
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,875
[KOMIYAN] A Virus?

32
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:34,125
[KAMUI] Maybe you'll
like some Night Fear!

33
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,208
[MONSTER growling]

34
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:38,208
[HOTARU] Or try this,
The Hanged Man!

35
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:42,500
[KAMUI] It worked!

36
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:43,583
[BALMUNG] Together,
while we have a chance!

37
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,416
[SANJURO] Quickly!

38
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,000
[MIREILLE] It's no use!

39
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,416
[OHKA] Mireille!

40
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,083
[MIREILLE] There's no way
we can defeat that horror.

41
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,708
We're all going to
die here for sure!

42
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:55,333
[BALMUNG] Never give up!

43
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:56,500
[MIREILLE] Everyone's
going to die...

44
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,916
[BALMUNG] Form up,
and we'll attack as a team!

45
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,166
[KAMUI] The creature
has to have a weakness!

46
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,625
[MICHI] Something that seeks
to transcend death itself

47
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:09,083
would not have any weaknesses...

48
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,375
[SHUGO] Don't give up!

49
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:15,375
[SHUGO] Rena... and
Aura...they're still fighting!

50
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,791
[RENA] Sh-Shugo...

51
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:19,375
[SHUGO] We can't
just give up the fight

52
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:20,958
here when we're so close!

53
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,166
[MIREILLE] But our
most powerful attacks

54
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,250
aren't even denting that thing!

55
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:27,250
And we're all running
out of items to use.

56
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,208
[SHUGO] There is one other way.

57
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,541
[HOTARU] But we've
tried everything...

58
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,083
What's left?

59
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,916
[SHUGO] Data Drain!

60
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,333
[AURA] No! You... mustn't...

61
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:39,625
[MICHI] How foolish can you be?

62
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,500
[OHKA] If you Data Drain
and Rena is hit,

63
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,208
think about the virus!

64
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,666
It could accelerate
and destroy us all!

65
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,041
She's part of that
monster, don't forget.

66
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,958
[SHUGO] Nobody said that I was
going to use it on the monster.

67
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,541
[KOMIYAN] Hey!

68
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,750
You don't have
to be so rough!

69
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,291
[HOTARU] Hey, look it's...

70
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:57,416
[RENA] K-Komiyama...

71
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,916
[KAMUI] What use is he?

72
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,791
[KOMIYAN] Huh? Rena!

73
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:02,916
What are you doing in there?!

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,083
[KOMIYAN]
What's wrong with her?!

75
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,541
[SHUGO] I learned
that Komiyama

76
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,125
exchanged member
addresses with Rena.

77
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,458
But as you can see,
unlike us,

78
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:13,750
he's not affected
by the virus at all.

79
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,250
[SHUGO] And then
I started to think...

80
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:18,541
why he of all people
would be all right!

81
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:20,500
And then it came to me!

82
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,375
[SHUGO] It was the Data Drain!

83
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,416
I remember you
were Data Drained

84
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,750
when you got in
the way of my attack.

85
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,125
[SHUGO] Something
about the Data Drain

86
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,583
made you immune to the virus,

87
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,916
that's why I think
it's the answer now.

88
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,208
[AURA]
That possibility exists...

89
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:35,458
[SANJURO] Shugo, you
can't be thinking about

90
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,416
Data Draining all of us?

91
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,583
[SHUGO] If I stop in time,

92
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,416
I might be able to
weaken the virus enough

93
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,666
to keep it from
causing any more damage.

94
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,875
Maybe then we'll have a chance

95
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:45,750
to defeat that thing
once and for all.

96
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:46,750
[MIREILLE] It's too dangerous!

97
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,041
[HOTARU] For all of us as well.

98
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:51,958
[SHUGO] I'm not going
to Data Drain everyone.

99
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:54,125
The one that's going
to be Data Drained...

100
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:57,833
Will be me.

101
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:01,375
[RENA] B-Big brother!

102
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,666
[SHUGO] Rena...

103
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:19,916
[SHUGO] I don't want to
experience memories

104
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,208
like that ever again.

105
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,708
I know this is the best
way to save Rena.

106
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:27,041
If I'm not the hero
that can save her now...

107
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:30,083
Then I don't deserve
to exist in The World.

108
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,750
[KAMUI]
So, death would be better?

109
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,208
[SANJURO] Lunacy!

110
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,416
[MICHI] Is that really
such a foolish thing?

111
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,791
To know death and face it?

112
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,958
[MORTI] To know...

113
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,541
That is all I desire...

114
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:49,750
[BALMUNG] Shugo...
You're mistaken!

115
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:52,083
[SHUGO] Wha...?

116
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:55,458
[BALMUNG] It's no longer a
matter involving the two of you.

117
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:58,250
It's a matter that involves
the entirety of The World

118
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,750
[SHUGO] B-But...

119
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:00,750
[HOTARU]
Shugo, you're forgetting

120
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,791
the most important thing...

121
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:05,416
[SHUGO] The most
important thing?

122
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,625
[OHKA] That you're
not the only one

123
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,875
in our little group
who wants to save Rena.

124
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:09,750
[HOTARU] That's right!

125
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,375
[MIREILLE] Yeah, that's right...

126
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,916
Otherwise we wouldn't
have come this far together!

127
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,166
There'll be no more
giving up, for me!

128
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,750
[BALMUNG] We're with you,

129
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,958
so if you're going to use
Data Drain, use it on all of us!

130
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,875
That way we'll be sure to
increase the chances of success!

131
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,875
[SANJURO] Exactly right!

132
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,875
[SHUGO] Everyone...?

133
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:36,791
[HOTARU] Shugo, look out!

134
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,041
[KAMUI] Someone has
to get its attention.

135
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,083
[BALMUNG] Kamui!

136
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,875
[KAMUI] Hurry up
with the Data Drain!

137
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:49,958
[SANJURO] Shugo!

138
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,125
[SHUGO] If this fail--
No hard feelings, huh?!

139
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:56,166
[RENA] Oh... Shugo...

140
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:00,208
[SHUGO]
Data Drain.

141
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:24,083
[REKI] Balmung,
please don't screw this up.

142
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,500
Oscar move!!!

143
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,250
[MIREILLE] It worked!

144
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:35,750
Look at that!

145
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,250
My staff is back!

146
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,666
Uh?

147
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:43,083
[HOTARU] Wow Grunty!

148
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:46,125
Shugo was right...
and you got so big!

149
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:47,791
[SHUGO] Alright!

150
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,750
Let the fighting begin!

151
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,083
[SHUGO] But can we beat it...?

152
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,416
Just the three of
us are standing...?

153
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:01,375
[BALMUNG] I know
there's no such thing

154
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,583
as a monster that cannot
be defeated in combat

155
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:07,958
That's an absolute
rule in The World

156
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,833
[BALMUNG] Whatever the monster,

157
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,750
there's always
a way to kill it...

158
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,416
So find it's weakness...

159
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,416
[BALMUNG] Don't give up
until the end!

160
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:23,250
[KAMUI] Well, looks like
it's up to the newbies!

161
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,833
[BALMUNG] They're
our only chance...

162
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,875
[SHUGO] Thunder Dance!

163
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,166
[MIREILLE] Vak Don!

164
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,250
[HOTARU] Pha Repth!

165
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,791
[MIREILLE] Thank you! Hotaru!

166
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:43,958
[MICHI] The fools...

167
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,958
Why are they bullying Morti?

168
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,958
She and I, we just wanted

169
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,458
to learn about
the nature of "death"...

170
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,125
That's all...

171
00:09:58,625 --> 00:09:59,958
[SHUGO] Our attacks
are having absolutely

172
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,083
no effect of that thing...

173
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,333
With this... could I?

174
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,125
Oh!

175
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:20,666
[AURA] You must use the power
of the bracelet to finish this.

176
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,000
[SHUGO] Eh?!

177
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:25,083
[AURA] Data Drain may
be the only way...

178
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,833
[SHUGO] The only way.

179
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,875
[AURA] Shu-Shugo...

180
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,208
[SHUGO] Aura...!

181
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,916
Oh!

182
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,041
[RENA] Oh!

183
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,166
[AURA] Data Drain
may be the only way...

184
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,625
When the virus has
completely infected Rena,

185
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,416
there will be a brief moment

186
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,583
before the infection
spreads to the entire area.

187
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,916
[AURA] If you do
that,you may be able to drain

188
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,083
just the virus and not Rena.

189
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,625
Know that the
timelag is less than

190
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:11,416
one one-thousandth of a second.

191
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,875
Follow your heart.

192
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,333
[RENA] It'll be all right.

193
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:17,375
You can do it...

194
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:18,625
Shugo.

195
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:24,166
[SHUGO] I'll get you back...

196
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,291
I swear!

197
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,875
[SHUGO] Data...

198
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:39,041
Dra-a-a-a-ain!

199
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:44,791
[RENA] Shugo!
[SHUGO] Rena!

200
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,958
[SHUGO] Rena...

201
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:19,250
[SHUGO] Get away from her!

202
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:23,750
[MORTI] Death to all you
Player Characters...

203
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,833
and Death to this world...

204
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,416
[Shugo
Hyper Thunder Dance!

205
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,833
[MICHI] No!!!

206
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,208
[RENA] Shugo!
[SHUGO] Rena!!

207
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:02,125
[HOTARU]
Hang on, Mireille!

208
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,791
[SANJURO] What's that...?

209
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,458
[BALMUNG] Chaos Gates...?

210
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:09,916
[SHUGO] Wh-What's that?

211
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,958
[MICHI] It's running now...

212
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,083
The final trap...

213
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,333
[SHUGO] What do
you mean by that?

214
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:55,500
[REKI] Five minutes until
the system goes down...

215
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,166
Why?

216
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,750
[MICHI] The trap
creates a limitless

217
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,583
amount of corrupted data.

218
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:02,916
It will continue to bury

219
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,666
The World until it
collapses on itself...

220
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:09,416
in order to destroy
any and all evidence...

221
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,333
[SHUGO] But why?

222
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:13,583
[KOMIYAN] This is so weird!

223
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:14,625
You're all weird!

224
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,208
Somehow this must be your fault!

225
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,208
C'mon Rena!

226
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,916
We have to log out, quickly!

227
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,125
[MICHI] All the gates in
The World are being used

228
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:25,875
to transmit the infinite
stream of destructive data...

229
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:28,250
Logout is impossible.

230
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:29,625
[OHKA] That girl is...

231
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:32,083
[KAMUI] That girl's
the fourth child...

232
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,458
[KAMUI] She's one
of the children

233
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:34,958
that started all of this.

234
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,458
[MIREILLE] But, the rumor
was that all the trouble

235
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,208
was caused by a
group of three boys...

236
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,208
[KAMUI] Yes, but
I looked into it.

237
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:42,750
It would have been quite
a feat for three of them...

238
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,791
but four people would've
worked much better...

239
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:48,625
[SHUGO] So did
the wandering A.I.

240
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,458
use this group of kids and
control what they were doing?

241
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,083
[MICHI] That wasn't it.

242
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:55,208
[MICHI] I met her and
she became my friend...

243
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,375
I know that sounds
like an odd thing to say.

244
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:58,958
I made friends with something

245
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:02,000
that was born from lingering
shreds of undeleted data.

246
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,875
If only she would have been able

247
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:07,208
to answer all the
questions I had for her.

248
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:08,916
I guess some things
we aren't meant to know.

249
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,416
[RENA] What are
you talking about...?

250
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,916
[MICHI] She and I had
been thinking about

251
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,958
the true nature of
"death" in our worlds.

252
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,083
[MICHI] I'd searched everywhere
I could in the real world,

253
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,916
but I could not find
a definitive answer...

254
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,125
So that's why...

255
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,333
[MICHI] Together, we
experimented in The World

256
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:32,875
trying to find
answers to questions

257
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,666
in a place where
death was common.

258
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,750
[MICHI] However, no
matter where we looked

259
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:39,041
we didn't make any
significant progress...

260
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,041
even when we went as

261
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,791
far as introducing an
extremely aggressive virus...

262
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,666
[MICHI] If there was
one thing we learned...

263
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,708
It was that "death"
in the real world

264
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:55,583
was just like
"deletion" here.

265
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,583
[RENA]
That's not right!

266
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,250
[SHUGO] If that's
really what you think...

267
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,541
[RENA]
Then why did you and Morti

268
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:07,208
try to make a world that
was like... an afterlife?

269
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,250
[RENA] Maybe it's because
you wanted to be certain

270
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,083
that there's a place
where our loved ones

271
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,291
would be waiting for us.

272
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,916
[SHUGO] I think everyone
would like to know that...

273
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,333
We all want to know
that there's somewhere

274
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,958
nice to go to after we die...

275
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,041
[RENA] Years ago
someone once said...

276
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,666
death is like parting.

277
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:27,500
[RENA] But now,
people who have been

278
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,708
separated by time or distance,

279
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:30,916
have a chance to
meet in The World.

280
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,791
I'd like to think
there's a place

281
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,333
where we can meet those

282
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,791
who have passed away
and be together again!

283
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,416
[SHUGO] Yeah!

284
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,000
[MICHI] A while ago...

285
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,083
I may have wanted
to believe that.

286
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:46,750
Although I don't really
understand how that could be.

287
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,583
She who knows
not death,

288
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:51,833
she who sacrificed
herself for me...

289
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:54,125
and is no longer
in this world...

290
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:55,791
She might have seen

291
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,916
that place... But,
it's already too

292
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,208
late... The World and everything
within it, will collapse soon.

293
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,041
[SHUGO] Collapse?

294
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,666
What about us?

295
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,083
[MICHI] I don't know...

296
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:14,458
Will we really die or will be in
an eternal slumber...?

297
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:15,958
Come to think of it,

298
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:19,416
years ago someone once likened
death to an eternal sleep.

299
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,208
[RENA] You're okay with that?

300
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,916
If we all die here?

301
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,333
[BALMUNG] It's too
soon to give up hope!

302
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:34,916
[BALMUNG] There's
still one unsolved

303
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,208
mystery about everything
that's happened here...

304
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,250
[HOTARU] What kind of mystery?

305
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,375
[BALMUNG] Why didn't Aura
just bring back Shugo...

306
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,500
Kite... by himself?

307
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:44,750
Why did she also
bring back Rena...

308
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:45,875
Black Rose...?

309
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:46,916
[SANJURO] It can't be?!

310
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,250
[BALMUNG] Shugo and Rena...

311
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,625
There must be a larger meaning

312
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,708
for gathering and protecting
both of them...

313
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:52,875
Maybe if they're together,

314
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,958
some kind of power
will be released...

315
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,458
[MICHI]
The Bracelet...

316
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,000
[SHUGO] Eh?

317
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,000
[MICHI] If there is such
a power to be released...

318
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,458
the key to it would
be the bracelet.

319
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:10,750
If there was one thing that
Morti feared the most...

320
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,666
it was that.

321
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,958
[SHUGO] This bracelet...?

322
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,750
[RENA]
Shugo...

323
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:40,958
[SHUGO] Rena...

324
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:00,958
[SHUGO] Now...

325
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,958
I think I understand...

326
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,375
[RENA] I do too.

327
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,083
[SHUGO and RENA] Whoa!

328
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:28,625
[SHUGO] Let's go Rena...

329
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:31,083
[RENA] Yeah, Shugo!

330
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,041
[SHUGO] Our world...

331
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,666
[RENA] ...is The World!

332
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,666
[SHUGO] We'll protect it!

333
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,208
[BALMUNG] Rena and Shugo...

334
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,250
we're counting on you!

335
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:03,041
[MIREILLE] Shugo! Rena!

336
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,125
[MIREILLE] Ta-dah!

337
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:49,000
I've finally gotten ahold of it!

338
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:50,416
[MIREILLE] Lookit,
lookit, loookit!

339
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:53,041
Three sets of rare silk items!

340
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,708
[OHKA] Yeah, but who'd be
caught dead wearing those?

341
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,041
[HOTARU] Hey! it's Kamui!

342
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:58,958
[MIREILLE] Ah... Greetings!

343
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,416
[Magi] Okay...
everyone's here right?

344
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,583
[KAMUI] Are we going somewhere?

345
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:06,000
[SANJURO] There appears to be
some sort of special event...

346
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,708
[BALMUNG] Sorry to
keep you all waiting...

347
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:10,333
[BALMUNG] Today's event is
going to be something to see.

348
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:11,833
[HOTARU] In this gonna be...

349
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:14,666
another one of Balmung's
special events?

350
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,083
[MIREILLE] Ew...

351
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:19,125
[REKI] Well , it'll be okay.
I made sure to check it first.

352
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:27,250
But the 2 most important
people are not here yet...

353
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:28,083
[HOTARU] It's all right.

354
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:29,583
They'll be here soon.

355
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:32,250
[MIREILLE] After all, the only
place where they can meet

356
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:35,791
is in The World since they live
so far away from each other.

357
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:38,791
[SANJURO] Here in The World that
the two of them protected.

358
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:42,666
[HOTARU] Ha!

359
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,541
[SHUGO] Sorry we're late!

360
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:45,583
[RENA] Yeah!

361
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:46,666
Sorry to make you wait!

362
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,750
[MIREILLE] They're here!

363
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:50,083
[RENA] You look great, everyone!

364
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:51,166
[HOTARU] Yes!

365
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,583
[KOMIYAN] Tres Bien!

366
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:54,375
[OHKA] I'm itching to fight!

367
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:56,458
[SANJURO] It's been a while,
shall we go train, Shugo?

368
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,416
[SHUGO] Yeah! Let's go Sanjuro!

369
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,708
[RENA] It's all right to train,

370
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:01,875
but don't forget about your
sister, remember?!

371
00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:03,208
[SHUGO] Of course not!

372
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:05,083
We won't ever be separated
again.

373
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:07,500
The World is a place where we
can always be together,

374
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:10,458
no matter what separates us in
the real world...

375
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:12,833
[MICHI] And if your heart truly
desires it...

376
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:16,625
It's a place where you can
always meet again!

377
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:19,750
[SHUGO and RENA] The legendary
heroes are back!
