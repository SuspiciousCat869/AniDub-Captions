00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:54,958
[KNIGHT A]
I've found him! Over here!

2
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:56,583
--[KNIGHT B] This way!
--[KNIGHT A] He's over here!

3
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:02,333
Gan Drive!

4
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:09,583
[kissing noise]

5
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:10,791
[KNIGHTS]
Freeze!

6
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:11,666
[KNIGHT A] All right!
Stay where you are!

7
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Rai Tornado!

8
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:28,500
This is interesting,

9
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:32,041
but this type of blade
cannot use Gan Drive.

10
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:34,166
C'mon, everyone
modifies items.

11
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,375
Gotta have a little edge, right?

12
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:39,208
Well then, if
everyone's doing it,

13
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:42,291
I'll just get everyone
to confess to me.

14
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:45,291
Only fools take pride
in cheating the system.

15
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,416
[KAMUI] These characters
violated the rules

16
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,708
by disregarding the User Consent
Agreement for The World--

17
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:54,041
rules which all of us
have agreed to.

18
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,708
In accordance
with these by-laws,

19
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,750
these player characters
will be deleted

20
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:01,250
and their player IDs will
be banned from the system!

21
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:02,541
Violated the rules?

22
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:05,000
They just got caught
for an item modification.

23
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:06,583
And that girl at the end,

24
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:09,833
she just modified the color of
her clothing to stand out a bit.

25
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,375
Aw, seriously?

26
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,666
Aw, c'mon! Who bothers to read
the User Consent Agreement!

27
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,500
That's just plain stupid!

28
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:19,000
To think there's such
impudence in The World.

29
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,916
We, the order of
Cerulean Knights,

30
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,708
believe that the
majority of users

31
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:29,916
honor the User Consent
Agreement and read it thoroughly

32
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,916
so as to understand
its purpose when they play.

33
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,583
Showtime!

34
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:40,625
[laughs]

35
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,250
[KAMUI]
If you're lucky,

36
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,791
you might just escape deletion.

37
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:50,291
Release!

38
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:04,791
"Evil will always be
destroyed," as they say.

39
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,250
Your attention!

40
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,791
It is my sincere hope
that this unfortunate event

41
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,375
will not have to happen again.

42
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,750
I hope you all understand!

43
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:14,916
That is all!

44
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:26,250
This is bad. Those
Cerulean Knights are serious.

45
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,000
They're not playing around!

46
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,750
No mercy.

47
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:30,875
Hm...

48
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:32,791
Seems like even with
a minor violation,

49
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:35,916
there isn't even a slim
chance of being let off.

50
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
[SANJURO] Which means it'll
only be a matter of time.

51
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,458
[MIREILLE]
Until what?

52
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:43,333
[SANJURO] Until they come
for Shugo and his bracelet.

53
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:48,583
Because it violates the
CC Corporation guidelines.

54
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:51,500
You mean it's not
just a rare item?

55
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,541
[SANJURO]
Hmm...

56
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,166
Fortunately, the
Cerulean Knights

57
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,416
didn't see Shugo using
the bracelet's powers

58
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,708
against that monster.

59
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,208
But if he's
discovered with it,

60
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,916
he'll be summarily
deleted like we saw today.

61
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,250
and our rescue of
Rena will be...

62
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,125
[SHUGO]
Master...

63
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,500
Oh, Shugo!

64
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,416
Do you think he heard us?

65
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,541
Then I'll keep this
conversation short.

66
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,000
Just lay low and
don't do anything

67
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,833
that will attract attention.

68
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,125
You think we
can find Rena

69
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,625
just by sitting
around here?

70
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:28,958
Shugo...

71
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:30,583
Do you really think those
knights will find Rena

72
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,541
if we just leave it up to them?

73
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,958
Don't, Shugo! Come back!

74
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:41,916
If you guys won't help me,

75
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,250
then I guess I'll have
to find Rena by myself!

76
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,750
--[HOTARU] Shugo!
--[MIREILLE] Shugo!

77
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,291
[MIREILLE]
Look down! Look down!

78
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,500
[SHUGO screams]

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Shugo!

80
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,583
Are you all right?

81
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:56,291
[SHUGO screams]

82
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,583
Rena! Rena! Rena!

83
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,083
Rena! Rena!

84
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,666
Shugo!

85
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,291
I thought I told him
not to attract attention.

86
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,291
[EXECUTIVE] And this
is concerning the...

87
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,208
...missing players, correct?

88
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:09,291
[BALMUNG]
Yes, sir.

89
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:10,791
[EXECUTIVE] That
responsibility was given

90
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:13,375
to the Cerulean
Knights, was it not?

91
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:14,583
[BALMUNG]
With all due respect,

92
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,583
their methods are
far too violent.

93
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:19,916
If this continues, the users
will begin to abandon The World!

94
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,416
[EXECUTIVE] Do you know
of another way?

95
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,125
[BALMUNG]
From its creation,

96
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:27,625
The World was designed as a
place for users to have fun!

97
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:28,833
But no longer...

98
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,166
[EXECUTIVE] You have a
distasteful tendency

99
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,625
to shield the users
from reality.

100
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,458
You have demonstrated
that a fine player

101
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:38,333
does not necessarily
make a fine administrator.

102
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:43,041
There are times when an
administrator must be harsh.

103
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,833
Perhaps you should learn
from Kamui's example.

104
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:47,125
That is all.

105
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:56,375
[REKI] Lord Balmung,
like those executives said,

106
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,916
maybe this incident is better
left to the Cerulean Knights,

107
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,875
after all.

108
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,750
Did Kamui tell you
to say that?

109
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,416
How can I trust you?

110
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,083
[REKI]
Of course you can.

111
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:08,666
I'm completely loyal
to you, Lord Balmung.

112
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,000
You're Kamui's love
now, aren't you?

113
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,125
[REKI] That's all a
big misunderstanding!

114
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,125
[REKI] Lord Balmung,
where are you going?

115
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,125
[BALMUNG] To find the
missing players on my own!

116
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,166
[REKI]
Uh, w-wait!

117
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,666
I'll find her.

118
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,708
No matter what stands in my way!

119
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,666
Darn it.

120
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,375
Just another normal one.

121
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,250
Tiger Claws!

122
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,125
Not this one, either!

123
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,791
Shugo's really
getting strong, isn't he?

124
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,250
The power of love,

125
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,208
and their sibling bond!

126
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,125
His heart is driving him
to help find his sister.

127
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,750
Brotherly love is
giving him the strength.

128
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,250
With that last one,
I think he just leveled up.

129
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,750
[SANJURO] How wonderful
to see the wisdom passed on

130
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,708
from master to student!

131
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,750
[SAVE SHOPKEEPER]
Here, here!

132
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:31,166
Before you go adventuring,
make sure to save your progress!

133
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,583
Or else you'll
wish you had!

134

Darn it!

135
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,625
Looks like he's back.

136
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:46,458
Yeah, he's been randomly
going out on his own.

137
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:47,666
He's just trying
to lure out

138
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,083
one of our modified monsters.

139
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,583
Just like last time.

140
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,416
[DAISUKE] Well,
since he's inviting us,

141
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,625
shall we accept?

142
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:55,791
[MICHI]
But don't forget,

143
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,291
those stupid knights
are milling around.

144
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,333
[HAYATO] Yeah.
It's a bad idea right now.

145
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,583
If CC Corporation catches
wind of what we're doing,

146
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,750
we're history.

147

saved here, you'd better!

That's her, all right.

Was there some kind
of defect in the software?

No way!

I wrote it just the
way I was told to.

I'll go check it out.

163
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,333
[HAYATO]
It's gotta be a mistake.

164
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,875
And after all of that,
I'm back where I started.

165
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,583
You appear to be correct.

166
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:43,583
It seems like this place

167
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,916
is basically constructed
like a normal area.

168
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,291
It's sort of like
a regular dungeon,

169
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:52,041
but without the monsters
and the lighting.

170
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,250
Have you figured out
where this place is yet?

171
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,291
Uh-uh.

172
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:59,250
The fact that I am but
a shadowed existence

173
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,250
would mean that we are
cut off from The World--

174
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,208
or at least its main servers.

175
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:07,416
But I can still
communicate with you.

176
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,083
It's like we're
connected to The World,

177
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,416
but somehow still far away.

178
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,625
If we could only find some
kind of clue in this place.

179
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:41,166
[KAMUI] So what has the
illegal player character

180
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,375
been saying under interrogation?

181
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:47,500
Well, he keeps babbling about
being an innocent victim.

182
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:50,958
He keeps saying it's not his
fault, it's not his fault.

183
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:56,166
[KOMIYAN] It's not my fault,
it's not my fault!

184
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,375
It's not like I'm this
because I want to be!

185
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,458
I'm a victim, I tell you!

186
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:05,250
I was just trying to log out and
return back to my normal self,

187
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,875
but I can't!

188
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,458
[screams]

189
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,041
[KOMIYAN]
No matter what I try,

190
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:17,375
this is as close to
normal as I can get!

191
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,750
When I was turned
into a fish last time,

192
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:22,083
things went back
to normal quickly.

193
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:25,000
My ravishing beauty
has been lost forever.

194
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,458
[KOMIYAN whimpers]

195
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,625
[KAMUI]
What do you find so funny?

196
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,708
I think he's crying, Kamui.

197
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:33,875
This is all
Kunisaki's fault

198
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:36,083
because he used some
sort of technique

199
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,000
called a Data Drain on--

200
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:42,291
Did you say...
Data Drain?

201
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:46,250
Tell me more about this
Kunisaki and his weapon.

202
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:47,375
[KOMIYAN]
Okay, okay!

203
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,083
Anything you want!

204
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:54,250
[KOMIYAN] Kunisaki's real
name is Shugo Kunisaki.

205
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:56,375
He's just called Shugo here.

206
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,083
He looks like this!

207
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,083
[KAMUI]
Where've I seen that face?

208
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:06,458
[MAGI] He was with Lord Balmung
and that modified monster.

209
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:10,125
This has become
very interesting.

210
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,625
[HAYATO]
Could this really be Aura?

211
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:25,833
Thank goodness!

212
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,458
You're not a shadow, huh?

213
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,041
You're real!

214
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,500
Uh, yeah...

215
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,625
So you have to tell me.

216
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,083
How did you find this place?

217
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,833
And what area is this?

218
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:37,583
And what Root Town
are we connected to?

219
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,750
Uh, I don't--

220
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,916
I don't really know.

221
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,625
I just snuck onto my
brother's PC, and then

222
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,875
all of the sudden,
I wound up here.

223
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,416
Great! Where is he, then?

224
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,625
Is your brother nearby?

225
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:51,750
Well, I...

226
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:54,625
Hey, wait a second!

227
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:56,583
Aura is there!

228
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:59,125
She must've been the
one who woke up Rena.

229
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,875
Did you say Aura?

230
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:02,125
[MICHI]
Did you forget?

231
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,333
She's the one that
gave Shugo the bracelet.

232
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,000
[DAISUKE]
Oh, that's right.

233
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,416
[HAYATO]
So what should we do?

234
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,375
Hang on a sec.

235
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:09,958
I'll make contact with her.

236
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:16,250
[KATSUYUKI]
There's trouble.

237
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:19,250
Something unexpected
has happened.

238
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,958
[FEMALE VOICE]
Understood.

239
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:22,916
Hey!

240
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,666
C'mon, wake up!

241
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,708
If I can access this
child's logs and data files,

242
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,125
I may be able to find
some clues for you.

243
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,291
[RENA]
That's great!

244
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:32,750
Hayato!

245
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:33,958
Log out right now!

246
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,625
She's trying to read our data!

247
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:36,750
Right.

248
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,916
[RENA] Agh!
Come back!

249
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,458
Can't you see I'm stuck here?

250
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:45,916
Did you learn anything?

251
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,416
JP.

252
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,791
Huh?

253
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,875
JP Server.

254
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,083
It means that we're inside
The World's Japanese server.

255
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,708
Japan?

256
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,416
[yawns]

257
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,750
Man, it's time for a break.

258
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,916
Here, here, you should save

259
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,500
before you go out adventuring,
or you'll be sorry later.

260
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:16,083
[KNIGHT A] You're Shugo
Kunisaki, are you not?

261
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,083
All right!

262
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,833
So did you find Rena?

263
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,416
[KNIGHT A] In the name
of the Cerulean Knights,

264
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,083
you, Shugo Kunisaki, are
being taken into custody

265
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:27,083
under suspicion of illegal
tampering with data.

266
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,833
That's the stupidest
thing I've ever heard!

267
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:34,583
I thought you were searching
for who kidnapped my sister!

268
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,666
[KNIGHT A] And you
are the prime suspect!

269
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,458
What?

270
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:38,291
[KNIGHT A]
Take him in!

271
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:43,166
[MALE VOICE] I return to
The World after all this time,

272
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,125
and I find the streets ruled by
a pack of gangsters

273
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,458
calling themselves knights.

274
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:51,375
How wretched are these times.

275
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,416
We are the Cerulean Knights,

276
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,500
and we act in the name of
Justice within The World!

277
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:58,750
Do you mock us?

278
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,333
[MALE VOICE]
Justice, you say?

279
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:01,916
There is much for us to discuss

280
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,250
if you intend to speak
to me about justice.

00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,000
Are you hurt?

284
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,125
Aren't you...

285
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:20,916
Just a man

286
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,666
who was once called a knight!

287
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,666
Now just leave this to me,

288
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,708
and run!

289
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:33,083
[KNIGHT] You who know
nothing of justice,

290
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:36,291
blindly waving
your swords about.

291
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,500
False knights, indeed!

292
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,916
[SILVER KNIGHT]
Now you will feel the power

293
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,875
of true justice!

294
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,833
Data Drain!

295
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,291
Not bad, kid!

296
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,375
I think it's time for us
to get out of here.

297
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,666
[yelling]

298
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,833
So the scarecrows
have friends.

299
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,583
This is gonna be fun.

300
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,333
[KATSUYUKI]
Reinforce the protection

301
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,375
around that area there.

302
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:15,500
Then that will make
Aura disappear.

303
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:16,541
[MICHI]
Got it.

304
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,458
[DAISUKE]
But how do I do that?

305
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,250
I've never done that before!

306
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:21,500
This time,

307
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:22,583
we're going to create a
strengthening program

308
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,916
to give us a boost in points.

309
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,625
We'll begin as soon
as that's done.

310

[PC #1]
Hey, isn't that...

312
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,041
[PC #3]
It can't be.

313
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,833
[PC #4] Yeah, from
what I hear, years ago,

314
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:37,958
he was known throughout The
World as a legendary warrior.

315
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,916
Silver Knight!

316
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,250
That's strange.

317
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:47,166
From back here, he doesn't
look that skinny to me.

318
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,916
Silver Knight. He
didn't say sliver knight.

319
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,875
Oh, sorry about that.

320
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,416
Did you know him?

321
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,625
Any long-time player

322
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:59,541
would know the great
Silver Knight. A legend.

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,500
There used to be a group
known as the Crimson Knights.

324
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:05,375
He was their captain.
Loyal to the end.

325
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,083
Your attention.

326
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,583
The one before you
has defied us.

327
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:13,916
He also assisted in the
escape of an illegal.

328
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,041
For this, he will
now be deleted,

329
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,583
and his ID will be banned.

330
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:22,250
To think that you
are their leader now.

331
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,125
The end is near...

332
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,875
Those who stand above others

333
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:31,708
must have noble ideals along
with the most noble intentions!

334
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:34,208
Anyone that cannot manage
the will of the masses

335
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:37,541
is not fit to serve
as leader of knights!

336
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,750
You say you're
punishing someone

337
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,666
for standing up to you?

338
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,708
That kind of justice is a lie!

339
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:48,750
We are an official section
of the CC Corporation.

340
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,666
If that's a problem for you,

341
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,333
well then, don't play!

342
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:55,375
You mean you'll
kill us all?

343
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:58,083
It's an insult
to call that justice!

344
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:01,375
You are silencing the
players through mass murder!

345
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:04,916
Remember this!

346
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,375
Those who call
themselves knights

347
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,208
must not hide behind the
shield of false justice!

348
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:14,458
If you forget that, you are
nothing but an empty shell!

349
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:30,333
Fire!

350
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,458
Lady Subaru!

351
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,958
[beeping noise]

352
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:14,833
Urgent...

353
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:15,875
...emergency?

354
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:18,333
[BALMUNG]
What's the problem?

355
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,041
I'm quite busy today.

356
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,333
[EXECUTIVE]
Perhaps busy searching

357
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,333
for the missing players?

358
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,375
Does that surprise you?

359
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,541
We have had a report
from your underling.

360
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:30,750
Reki.

361
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,291
[EXECUTIVE] I do believe
that I had assigned

362
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:37,166
the missing persons case to the
Cerulean Knights, did I not?

363
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,125
But then--

364
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,375
[EXECUTIVE]
It would seem that

365
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:43,750
administrating does not
suit you, Lord Balmung.

366
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,250
As of this moment,

367
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,916
you will be removed from the
system administration staff.

368
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,875
Your powers as an
administrator will be revoked

369
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:53,083
and transferred to
another department.

370
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,958
You may return to The World
as one of its players

371
00:19:56,041 --> 00:20:00,416
and simply enjoy it as
a hobby from this day onward.

372
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,875
That is all.

373
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,333
[KAMUI]
Is it true about Balmung?

374
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:09,583
Yes.

375
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,583
He remains with the CC
Corporation, but...

376
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:13,916
[KAMUI] I would've
liked to have used

377
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,750
the discovery of his
involvement with Shugo

378
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:18,416
as a reason to
delete him myself.

379
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,541
Oh, well.

380
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,958
He can't do any harm
as a simple user.

381
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,833
[KAMUI] And you're
no innocent, either.

382
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:29,750
Selling out your own
superior to the company.

383
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,666
Hey, I'm not being paid
by Lord Balmung

384
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,583
for all the work
I do around this place.

385
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,041
Besides,

386
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:39,500
I'm... I'm your
boyfriend now, aren't I?

387
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:42,416
[KNIGHT A]
To the back.

388
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,250
Search around the back!

389
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,500
[KNIGHT B]
Hey, what's going on?

390
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,583
[KNIGHT C] Not much.
We didn't find anyone.

391
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:48,833
[KNIGHT B] Yeah, well,
the search is going on

392
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,125
through every area.

393
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,083
It's just a matter of time
before he's caught.

394
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,875
[KNIGHT C]
Yeah. We'll get him.

395
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,666
[AURA]
From the data I collected,

396
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,583
I have determined
a place in The World

397
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,416
where access is possible.

398
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,583
That is, if we use this.

399
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:05,916
To get back?

400
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,833
[AURA] This mail
must reach Shugo.

401
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,541
Okay!

402
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:13,375
[AURA] If the mail
does get through safely,

403
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,250
then your brother
should be able to trace it

404
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:16,958
to reach this area.

405
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:19,666
Got it!

406
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,250
What's wrong, Aura?

407
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,333
The protection in this area.

408
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:25,291
It's strengthening.

409
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,833
Hurry. Send the mail.

410
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:28,875
Okay!

411
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,416
All right, Shugo!
Receive this!

412
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:54,875
[beeping noise]

413
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,333
Rena!

414
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,291
[RENA]
Oh, big brother,

415
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:03,833
If you don't find me soon,

416
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:06,250
I'm gonna to be pretty angry.

417
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:09,083
But enough of that.
I have event information!

418
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:11,708
In the area Dying Destroyer's
Grave,

419
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:14,541
the Cerulean Knights are
up to their old tricks.
