00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:53,500
I'm here.

00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:55,416
And I'm all right.

00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,458
I have no idea
where "here" is, but...

5
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:02,916
I'm--I'm alive, so...

6
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:06,375
Help me... please.

[SHUGO]
Rena!

8
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,458
[BALMUNG]
Just a regular player.

9
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:26,041
That might be...

10
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:27,416
...interesting.

11
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:35,541
[KNIGHT A] You will
be taken into custody

12
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:38,333
for the illegal
modification of your costume.

13
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,916
[PC #2]
No!

14
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:46,250
Exposing the illegal players
is progressing smoothly.

15
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:51,166
However, still no luck with
Shugo or the modified monsters.

16
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,000
Find them, no matter what.

17
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:56,250
That illegal player character
that looks so much like Kite--

18
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:59,166
I will not allow such a
dangerous character to exist.

19
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,166
[MAGI]
Yes, ma'am.

20
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,750
[KAMUI]
Where are you?

21
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,458
I will not allow
a player character

22
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:06,208
to illegally posess
the power of Data Drain.

23
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,000
[SHUGO]
Man, they're everywhere!

24
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,291
This place is full of
those Cerulean Knights.

25
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:17,833
[MIREILLE] Yeah,
there's no easy way

26
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:20,916
for us to get close to the
Chaos Gate to get outta here.

27
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,833
[SHUGO]
Darn it!

28
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:22,958
[MIREILLE]
Now listen, Shugo.

29
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,000
Even when walking,
don't get careless.

30
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,416
Do everything you can

31
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,125
to keep from standing out
when you're moving around.

32
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,125
What? You've gotta
be kiddin' me!

33
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,291
What are you
talking about?

34
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,083
This is really rare stuff!

35
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,250
You should be grateful

36
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,083
that I even considered
lending it to you!

37
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:40,583
Uh, couldn't you find
something a bit less squishy?

38
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,083
Just a bit?

39
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,708
Stop being so picky.

40
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,291
Anything's better
than looking like Kite

41
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:48,083
when you're walking
down the street, right?

42
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,416
[SHUGO]
I guess, but...

43
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,791
[MIREILLE giggling]

44
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:53,000
Hey! What do you kids think
you're doing over there?

[laughing nervously]

[SHUGO]
Nothing, officer.

47
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:02,166
We're just a frog and
a rabbit, passing on through.

48
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,750
That's right, we're
not at all suspicious here.

49
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:05,916
Boing!

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,083
Move along!

51
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:08,625
We're looking for
an outlaw in this area.

52
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,833
Hey... y'know,

53
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:15,750
you look a lot like that
character we're looking for.

54
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,708
[KNIGHT A]
Yeah, he certainly does.

55
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,416
Hey, you two!

56
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,250
Come over here for a moment!

57
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,333
Hey!

00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,166
It's an illegal
flying peach pudding!

59
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,208
[KNIGHTS]
Wha...?

00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,125
[MIREILLE]
Boing, boing, boing, boing...

00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,291

00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:33,416
[KNIGHT A]
Get back here!

63
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,500
[KNIGHT B]
Hey! Over there!

--Don't let them get away!
--Come on!

65
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,875
--They went down there!
--What? Huh?

66
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,250
--Where'd they go?
--Went down this alleyway!

67
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,125
They disappeared.

00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,041
I don't know.

69
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,375
Find them!

70
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:47,416
They couldn't have gotten
far in those costumes!

71
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,375
Divide into two groups
and we'll box them in!

72
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:50,416

Yes sir!

00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,666
Welcome back!

Froggy!

75
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,458
I can't believe
there's so much space

76
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,791
under that grungy
little doghouse up there.

77
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,875
Tell us, did you find
anything out there?

78
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,750
Oh, don't even
start with that.

79
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:10,125
It's almost impossible
to walk in the city these days,

80
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,416
especially with a Shugo frog.

81
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:22,500
[whimpering]

82
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:25,291
So no one has any leads?

83
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,458
I just wonder where Rena
could have sent the mail from.

84
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:29,791
Even if we did
try searching,

85
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,791
the streets are
crawling with knights.

86
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,958
There's no way.

Well, maybe there is.

--Lord Balmung's little flunky?
--Lord Balmung's little flunky?

He's Kamui's
boyfriend these days.

Can't you call me
something else?!

There has to--

95
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:09,041
There just has to be an
exit up here somewhere.

96
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:12,958
[RENA]
Shugo...

97
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,208
...where are you?

98
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,541
[KATSUYUKI] Looks like those
knights are still at it.

99
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:28,916
[MICHI] Yeah.
If they keep this up,

100
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,083
there won't be any players left!

101
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,000
Aw, how annoying.

102
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,416
With security this tight,

103
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,750
there's no way we can play
with Shugo and the others.

104
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,541
[KATSUYUKI] Well,
there's nothing we can do.

105
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,750
We just have to lay low for now.

106
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,666
Firing off the biggest fireworks

107
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,666
requires the most careful
preparations, right?

108
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,416
Hey, is Hayato going to come?

109
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,875
Didn't you hear?

110
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,291
Hear what?

111
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:56,500
He just ordered a new PC
and it came in the other day.

112
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,458
He's been trying it out
and adventuring on his own.

113
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,500
[chuckling]

114
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:09,125
Um, guys? This place
gives me the creeps.

115
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:10,583
I've heard that the monsters

116
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,833
that show up here
are pretty intense.

117
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,375
If we can defeat just one,

118
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,416
we can get our levels up fast!

119
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,666
[PC #4]
All right, let's do it!

120
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,083
Like moths to the flame,
they are drawn to the danger.

121
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:24,458
It's bad luck for this
sorry little group.

122
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:25,625
They'll learn that
they showed up

123
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,750
at the right place
at the wrong time!

[MONSTER roaring]

capture the monster.

The rest of you search
every inch of the area!

129

Do not let even an ant escape!

00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,291
Sir, got it!

One person doing a quick
teleport from this vicinity.

00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,333
Good. Continue to trace them!

00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,500
They won't get away!

Did you find them?!

136
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,041
[MAGI]
It's not Shugo,

137
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:08,083
but it's the ones who
modified those monsters.

138
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,083
We hooked him!

139
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,416
Now we're letting him run

140
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,208
and waiting for him
to contact his associates

141
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,625
back in the real world!

142
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,541
[KAMUI] So they've
finally shown themselves.

143
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,875
[RENA]
What is this place?

144
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,375
A server?

145
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:33,833
Yeah, I was able to use

146
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:36,083
my system administrator
security clearance

147
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,041
to look into it on my own.

148
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,625
That's where Rena
sent the mail from.

149
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,958
So do you know exactly
where Rena is now?

150
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,416
But how can we trust him?

151
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,083
We know he's been working
with that Kamui lady.

152
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,833
[REKI] Hey, trust me
or not, it's your choice,

153
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,750
but do you have
any other options?

154
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,541
Now what?

155
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:57,083
Well, I'm afraid I don't
know all the details,

156
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,916
but it's a closed server
that's not online yet.

157
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,625
They're using an area
still under construction.

158
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,208
It's offline?

159
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:05,875
So that's why we
couldn't find her

160
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,458
no matter where we looked.

In other words,

163
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,208
it's like a store in the
morning before it opens.

164
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:15,583
The public isn't allowed
to enter; only employees.

165
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:18,416
So the one who did this
is from the CC Corporation?

166
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,833
No way!

167
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,083
Based on the series of incidents
and the data I've seen,

168
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:25,041
there's no doubt it's a
crime done from the outside.

So then...

170
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,250
My best guess is that it's a

00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,791
seriously skilled hacker
who is good enough on a PC

172
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:32,875
to access a server
before it's even open.

173
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:35,083
There's no way for a
normal everyday user

174
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,958
to get through a secured
barrier like that one.

175
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,416
Wait a minute!

176
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,750
But if this is a closed server,

177
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,958
then how are we
supposed to get there?

178

But there is a way,
isn't there?

I've never seen a

Okay, you guys!

330
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,000
Delete everything that
could be left as evidence

331
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,166
so no one can track the logs.

Run!

We have to get out
