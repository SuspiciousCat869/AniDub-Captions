1
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,125
[DOCTOR]
Blood Pressure decreasing.

2
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:50,750
Pulse decreasing.

3
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:53,833
There appears to be no
response to external stimulus.

4
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:56,416
[SHUGO'S FATHER]
You mean she's brain dead?

5
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,750
[DOCTOR] No, the brain
is still functioning.

6
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:11,750
She's still logged in?

7
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:15,375
[SHUGO'S MOTHER] Will
she return to normal?

8
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,166
[DOCTOR] This is very
unusual. I'm sorry,

9
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,333
but we're doing everything
that we can. It just...

10
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,000
[SHUGO] Why can't she log out?

11
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,083
[SHUGO] RENA!

12
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,291
[RENA]
I'm dead.

13
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:57,750
I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead.

14
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:01,416
[AURA] Please open your eyes.

15
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,375
[AURA] No.

16
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:05,583
You are not yet dead.

17
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,583
[RENA]
I'm dead.

18
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,250
Please open
your eyes, Rena.

19
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:15,833
[MIREILLE] What?!

20
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:18,208
Rena's been hospitalized?

21
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,083
How long has she been comatose?

22
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,208
And the doctors
don't have a clue why?

23
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,958
And when you say
she can't log out,

24
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,125
what do you mean
by that, exactly?

25
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,208
I wish I knew,

26
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,750
but then,
if she's still logged in,

27
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,583
she has to be
somewhere in The World.

28
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,000
She has to.

29
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,583
Rena's condition
in the real world

30
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,875
must be related to her
disappearance from here.

31
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:49,250
We have to keep looking around,

32
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,458
and maybe we can
find some kind of clue.

33
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,750
It's just that none of
this makes any sense.

34
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:54,916
And there's also that thing

35
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,458
back at the hot springs
to think about.

36
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:58,791
There's no way
that could have been

37
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,416
just a coincidence.

38
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,875
No doubt.

39
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:05,541
Something is behind all of this.

40
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:06,583
[SHUGO] And what if...

41
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,791
...we do manage to find her?

42
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,833
Do you think Rena will
regain consciousness

43
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:12,916
in real life?

44
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,916
We've got to keep trying.

45
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Whoa!

46
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,000
[BALMUNG] Shugo?

47
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,250
What are you doing here?

48
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,875
Could you move your foot
before you keep talking?

49
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,750
Sanjuro. You're here.

50
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,708
So this is the area that
Rena disappeared from?

51
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,458
[BALMUNG] I checked
the access logs.

52
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,833
Since the time Rena
was killed in this area,

53
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:43,458
she hasn't logged out once.

54
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:44,916
That's a fact.

55
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So you've already
started to investigate?

56
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:50,000
Impressive,
Mr. CC Corporation man.

57
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:52,375
But Rena. What
could've happened to her?

58
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,375
[crash]

59
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:54,625
Huh?

60
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,583
Who's there?

61
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:05,208
[REKI] Lord Balmung!

62
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:09,416
[SHUGO] Rena!

63
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,125
[screaming]

64
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,416
And now my second kiss
was wasted in a video game.

65
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,291
And with a guy this time.

66
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:23,666
[BALMUNG] Reki, why were you--

67
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,250
[REKI] What do you mean,
Lord Balmung?

68
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,416
You're the one that ordered me

69
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,458
to investigate this area,
if I remember.

70
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:31,291
So what did you find here?

71
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:34,458
Just some crazy kid
who likes to kiss people?

72
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:36,250
I wasn't talking about Shugo.

73
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,833
What about his sister?

74
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:39,666
Oh, yeah!

75
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,000
Uh...

76
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,041
There are definite traces
of a gate to this area

77
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:46,666
being forced opened
by someone outside.

78
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,041
Rena was...

79
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:51,250
...teleported to some
other area outside of here?

80
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,375
Teleported? To where?

81
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:54,666
[REKI] Any kind of
evidence of that

82
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,666
was cleanly deleted from
the system, I'm afraid.

83
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,583
[SANJURO] So we don't
know where she is?

84
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,750
Some administrators you are.

85
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,333
Administrate and investigate!

86
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:08,416
That's what I do every day
on behalf of the players

87
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,208
to maintain order in The World.

88
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,166
So he says...

89
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,916
But you have been
spending a lot of time

90
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,416
searching for our
friend Rena, haven't you?

91
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,791
It's not just for Rena
that I'm searching.

92
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:21,583
What do you mean... by that?

93
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:24,250
There are other users
who've been affected like this.

94
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:27,041
They've fallen into a
coma while logged in,

95
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,666
and are hospitalized
just like Rena.

96
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,250
In each case where something
like this has happened,

97
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:35,708
the users fell into a coma
while playing inside The World,

98
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,041
and all of those players
remained logged in.

99
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,750
This is in no way
some kind of system bug.

100
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,833
Someone evil is intent on
destroying this world,

101
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:46,916
and we will hunt them down,
make no mistake about that!

102
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,583
An evil intent. Huh.

103
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:52,208
[BALMUNG] I will <i>not</i> allow it!

104
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,791
Now, where's that Kite?

105
00:06:58,875 --> 00:06:59,916
You mean Shugo.

106
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,416
[DAISUKE]
Whoever, doesn't matter.

107
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,250
Shugo. Kite. Who cares?

108
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:05,583
[KATSUYUKI] Looks like
he's loitering around

109
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,750
the Cursed Woodland
Murderhouse again.

110
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,333
[HAYATO]
His IQ's in the basement.

111
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,375
Come on. Why don't
we quit toying around

112
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,458
and start our plan
to get rid of him,

113
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:15,458
just like we did to BlackRose?

114
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:16,750
[MICHI] You mean Rena.

115
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,916
Oh, whatever her name is!

116
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,958
Balmung of the
Azure Sky is with them.

117
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,791
We can't do anything right now.

118
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,583
He'll be able to track us down.

119
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:27,708
You're right.

120
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:30,583
Hey! They just
came back to us!

121
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,791
The Twilight.

122
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:41,166
Oh. We can see
that, obviously.

123
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,916
[SANJURO] That's not it.

124
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,958
Huh?

125
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:45,041
The same thing happened

126
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,416
to a group of
players four years ago.

127
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,500
When it happened,

128
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,416
they called it the
Twilight Incident.

129
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,625
[BALMUNG]
Many users were injured,

130
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:56,166
and The World was on
the verge of destruction.

131
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:07,250
[BALMUNG] The ones
that resolved the incident

132
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,875
were not CC Corporation
administrators.

133
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:12,125
They were a party of players.

134
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,833
How come I've never heard
of that incident before?

135
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,708
It's not in any of
The World log files.

136
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:20,208
[SANJURO] CC Corporation
erased all the logs.

137
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,583
There are no
official records left

138
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,291
from that time in the game.

139
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:28,666
However, it was something
that actually happened.

140
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,541
The key players in bringing
about its successful resolution

141
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,125
were Kite and BlackRose.

142
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,541
Oh?

143
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:39,208
And from that point on,
they were known as the .hackers.

144
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,375
Did you say the .hackers?

145
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,041
I think I've heard of them.

146
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,708
Yeah, that party
was supposed to be

147
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,083
the one that solved the
last mystery of The World!

148
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,333
Well, maybe that's
what The World

149
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:50,416
thinks about it these days.

150
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,208
But that's all just
a rumor, I assure you.

151
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:56,166
So how...
do you know so much?

152
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,666
Because Balmung and
I were two original members

153
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,458
of the .hackers.

154
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:08,833
[KATSUYUKI] Well?

155
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:09,875
[HAYATO] It's no good.

156
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:10,833
I've lost them

157
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:11,791
[MICHI] Same here.

158
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,166
[DAISUKE] Aw, man!

159
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,958
Where did they go?

160
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,833
A hideout, maybe?

161
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,000
What is that?

162
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,000
It's a rare
item you can earn.

163
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,083
It'd be difficult to
sneak into one of those,

164
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,083
if that's what they're using.

165
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,458
Now what?

166
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:29,041
they'll have to pass through
a Chaos Gate eventually.

167
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:33,166
There's no need for us to go
out of our way to find them.

168
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,916
They'll have to come out
of there some time.

169
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,916
The enemy. They have been aware

170
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,416
of Shugo's existence
here from the very start.

171
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,000
Uh, me?

172
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:45,625
The enemy probably also knows of
the events from four years ago

173
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:46,916
and the main thing keeping them

174
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
from their objective
would be Kite's bracelet.

175
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,208
Huh? Oh...

176
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:59,583
From here on out, the
enemy will be pursuing you.

177
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,583
Understand, Shugo?

178
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,208
Huh?

179
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,083
[BALMUNG] So don't
act like a fool.

180
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:08,000
Huh?

181
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,166
You don't have
to be a jerk about it!

182
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:36,958
Rena.

183
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,208
I've never heard
that story before, Rena.

184
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,916
The story's true.

185
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,166
The rabbit in the moon is there

186
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,541
to give courage
to all travelers.

187
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,250
When the
traveler is in trouble,

188
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,333
it comes to save them!

189
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,291
Rena.

190
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,333
Okay.

191
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,750
Rena's a
traveler in trouble.

192
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,083
So I'll be the
rabbit who saves her!

193
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,583
[AURA] Please, open your eyes.

194
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,750
Please, open your eyes.

195
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,083
[RENA] I...

196
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,458
[AURA] Rena.

197
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,291
[RENA] Could you be...

198
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,333
...th-the rabbit?

199
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,208
My name is Aura.

200
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,583
Aura?

201
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,416
[RENA] Aura.

202
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,166
My broth--I mean,
Shugo said he'd met you.

203
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,750
[AURA] That's right.

204
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,291
[RENA] Oh, man.

205
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,250
Looks like I'm alive!

206
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:05,666
[AURA] Yes.

207
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,666
[RENA] But I was sure that
monster got me back there.

208
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,958
But wait,

209
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,833
that was inside the
game world, though, right?

210
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:18,000
I just need to log out and
sort things out in my head.

211
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:27,750
[RENA] Huh? Why can't I log out?

212
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:31,875
Is there...
some kind of bug?

213
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,208
The trance.

214
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:34,416
[RENA] Huh?

215
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,541
[AURA] When you were
defeated by the monster,

216
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:39,291
an evil suggestion
was placed in your mind.

217
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:40,916
You were in a trance,

218
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,833
under the suggestion
that you were dead.

219
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,416
[RENA] A trance?

220
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,083
[AURA] And because
of that influence,

221
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,041
in the real world,

222
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:50,083
[RENA] I died?

223
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,625
No, not yet.

224
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,125
[RENA] What do you mean?

225
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:56,125
Your life still hangs by a
thread back in the real world.

226
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,750
But if it's allowed
to remain in that state

227
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,416
for too much longer...

228
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,875
[RENA] I'm going to...

229
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,583
No. You are
not alone in this.

230
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:06,000
There are many others like
you trapped in this area,

231
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,958
who have had the
suggestion placed upon them

232
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:10,791
that they are dead,
and here they remain with me.

233
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,250
[RENA] So many of them.

234
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,625
But isn't there
something you can do

235
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,458
to help these trapped souls?

236
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:23,250
Like when you gave
Shugo that amazing bracelet.

237
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,958
Please!

238
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,166
[gasps]

239
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,208
My existence here
is but a shadowed one,

240
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,166
as you can now see.

241
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,333
It was all I could do

242
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:34,750
to awaken you from
the suggestion's hold.

243
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,750
So what can I do
to get outta here?

244
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,875
[AURA] There is only one hope.

245
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,875
The rabbit!

246
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,416
Leave it to me!

247
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,750
Have no fear, the
Legendary Hero is on the quest!

248
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:51,958
Rena!

249
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,958
[SHUGO]
Rena, wait for me!!

250
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,250
[KOMIYAN] Rena's here?

251
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,750
Tres bien!

252
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:07,250
[SHUGO] Gusting
Southern Nation Snows!

253
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,875
Gusting Southern Nation Snows!

254
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:14,916
[HAYATO] Party members?

255
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,333
[MICHI] Shugo's alone.

256
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:17,458
Hey, hey, hey.

257
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,541
You've got to let
me do it this time.

258
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,833
I made the coolest
monster to take him out.

259
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,083
[HAYATO] But why is he alone?

260
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,208
Who cares?

261
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:27,208
They'd all get
smashed along with him.

262
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,583
How high a level
did you make it?

263
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:32,000
Why ask something you
already know the answer to?

264
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,291
[KATSUYUKI] Okay, all right,
I'm leaving it to you.

265
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,000
[DAISUKE] Ya-ha!

266
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,208
[KATSUYUKI] All right, everyone.

267
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,541
Let's get ready.

268
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,125
Let's do it!

269
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,333
[OHKA] Can someone tell me
why Shugo's alone in this area?

270
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:02,750
[MIREILLE] Probably not looking
for a rare item, I guess.

271
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,833
[HOTARU] No doubt
he's looking for Rena.

272
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,791
[SHUGO yelling]

273
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,125
[SHUGO] Hello? Nice monster?

274
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,541
Ah! Whoa!

275
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:20,875
What is that?

276
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:23,958
A Killer Snake or a Moonlighter?

277
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,791
I've never
seen one of those!

278
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,791
[OHKA] It's a merge
of multiple creatures--

279
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,375
some sort of modified monster!

280
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,166
And now, to finish this!

281
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,958
[SHUGO] No!

282
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:34,833
Wait!

283
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,458
You can't kill it yet, Sanjuro!

284
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:40,125
The enemy is using this
monster to try to kill me.

285
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:41,375
Then, like Rena,

286
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,416
I'll be teleported through
an invisible gate

287
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,583
where no one can find me.

288
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,041
That's it!

289
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,166
Shugo.

290
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,583
There has to be a gate

291
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,750
connected to the area
where they're holding Rena.

292
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,791
If we can find it,
we can save her!

293
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:54,750
I get it!

294
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,333
So that's what they're doing!

295
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:57,333
[SHUGO]
There must be a something

296
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,250
in the monster's
programming code.

297
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,750
When the
monster is killed,

298
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,916
there must be something in
the code that opens the gate.

299
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,250
If we can just analyze it,

300
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,041
I can find out where Rena is!

301
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:09,583
[SANJURO] Shugo.

302
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:13,250
It seems there's no fear
of overkill with this one.

303
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,250
Shugo!

304
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:15,958
Data Drain it now!

305
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,541
Weaken it enough so
we can capture it alive.

306
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,750
I got it!

307
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,250
Data Drain!

308
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,375
[KOMIYAN]
Rena!

309
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,166
Komiyama?!

310
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:42,250
Data Drain!

311
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:47,083
[MIREILLE] Shugo, you don't
have enough skill points left!

312
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:50,083
Sanjuro and I can hold this
one off while you get clear!

313
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,000
[OHKA] I'll help!

314
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,833
I could use a good fight.

315
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,083
[SANJURO] Mireille, Hotaru!

316
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:57,666
Help Shugo recover
his skill points!

317
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,541
[MIREILLE] Okay!

318
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,291
[OHKA yelling]

319
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:06,083
[MIREILLE] Rig-gee-em,
rig-gee-em!

320
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:07,375
[MIREILLE] Wait!

321
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,333
Shugo! You haven't
recovered your skill points!

322
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:12,000
Hurry. They're all in trouble.

323
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,416
Hurry!

324
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,708
Hey, that feels much better.

325
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:16,958
Hurry.

326
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:27,458
Recovery complete!

327
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:29,916
All right! You're all set!

328
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,875
Yeah!

329
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,958
Data...Huh?

330
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,791
Who.. Who are they?

331
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:46,875
[BALMUNG] The Cerulean...

332
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,416
[SANJURO] ...Knights!

333
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,125
Formation Delta!

334
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,500
[BALMUNG] Stop!
You mustn't kill it!

335
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:09,958
[KAMUI] Delete!

336
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:15,666
Stop it!

337
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,625
If you delete it,
then Rena will...

338
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,708
Don't let your
heart blind you.

339
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,583
Operation complete.

340
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,833
Prepare to withdraw.

341
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,250
[BALMUNG] Kamui

342
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:35,500
Hey! They cheated!

343
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,583
[HAYATO] That's not cool!

344
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,125
Not bad.

345
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,916
Looks like CC Corporation's
finally getting serious, too.

346
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,500
Very interesting.

347
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,166
[SHUGO] Rena.

348
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,916
Kamui.

349
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,041
Lord Balmung.

350
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,916
Kamui.

351
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,041
Lord Balmung.

352
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,791
Kamui!

353
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:09,083
Are you trying to tell
me that you still love me?

354
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,541
So those two,

355
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,416
something going on between them?

356
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,625
Dunno.

357
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,958
Why did you and your
knights interfere?

358
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:18,958
You had no
justification to be here!

359
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:22,083
You just destroyed our plan
to capture the modified monster

360
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,666
and find the missing players.

361
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:27,416
The plan to find your new love,
don't you mean, Balmung?

362
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,958
Oh, no!

363
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:32,416
There's no way that Balmung
could ever be Rena's boyfriend!

364
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,916
Well I have a new love, too,

365
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,875
so you don't have
to worry about it.

366
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,583
A new love?

367
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,333
Reki. You!

368
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,041
Love is blind, they say.

369
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,708
And one more thing,

370
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,166
this incident has
been transferred

371
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,916
to the control of
the Cerulean Knights

372
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,875
who are under my command.

373
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,458
It's a CC Corporation
upper division decision,

374
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:55,958
I'm afraid.

375
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:59,000
You should be getting your
email notification soon enough.

376
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,666
[BALMUNG] An incident like this

377
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,000
the corporation is going to
be transferring this to you?

378
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:05,625
If that's a problem,
send an email.

379
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:08,875
[KNIGHT A] Lady Kamui,
data maintenance is complete.

380
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:09,916
Good.

381
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,666
Prepare to move out!

382
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,166
You know I'll still
love you, Balmung,

383
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,791
as long as you
stay out of my way.

384
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,750
So what the heck
was that all about?

385
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,000
They suddenly show up

386
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,083
and ruin my
super-duper rescue plan

387
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,458
and then just
disappear like that?

388
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:31,333
They're the Cerulean Knights,

389
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:34,500
the CC Corporation's
counter net terrorism force.

390
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:35,958
[SANJURO] In other words,

391
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,583
their job is to
police the system

392
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:40,083
and to unmask
any terrorist threats.

393
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:43,250
Part of their job is to
not care about anyone else.

394
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:46,208
Then what about Rena?

395
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,916
[BALMUNG] It's not
their responsibility

396
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,250
to search for missing players.

397
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,750
So Lord Balmung!

398
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,750
These guys are your
friends, isn't that right?

399
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,666
You could pull
some strings, huh?

400
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,041
It's already...

401
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,083
Already...?

402
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:01,125
...too late.

403
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,708
Why's that?

404
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,166
Because of one thing.

405
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,708
One thing? What's that?

406
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:13,500
Because the sword cannot
win against the heart!

407
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,125
Huh?

408
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:20,958
[SHUGO] Stop joking around!

409
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:44,958
[SHUGO]
Rena.

410
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:03,916
[RENA] I have
secret information!

411
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,250
Hey, Shugo, did you know

412
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,166
that there used to
be a legendary group

413
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,916
called the Crimson Knights?

414
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,333
That means that the guy
with the glowing eyes is...

415
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:14,125
Whoa...
