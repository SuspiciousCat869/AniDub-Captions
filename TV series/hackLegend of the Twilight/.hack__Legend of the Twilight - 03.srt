1
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:02,500
[FEMALE FIGHTER] Excuse me.

2
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:05,375
I have a little favor
I'd like to ask.

3
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,375
A favor... like what?

4
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:10,541
[FEMALE FIGHTER] Starting
tomorrow, well actually...

5
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:12,083
...actually it's later today,

6
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,625
I'll be going out of town
on a trip for three days.

7
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:16,500
So, during that time,
I'm afraid...

8
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:19,125
I'm afraid my
Grunty here will...

9
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:22,583
W-Well, he's going to be
alone, so I was wondering...

10
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,708
Ah!

11
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:28,208
Can you... watch him?

12
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:31,208
Uh... I-I really don't know...

13
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:32,916
It's only for three days.

14
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,958
Just three little
days to keep him safe.

15
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:38,333
Please, can you help me out?

16
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,458
Hungry, hungry!

17
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,500
Food, food food!

18
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:50,708
[MIREILLE] Ta da!

19
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:51,750
[SHUGO]
Uh...

20
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:55,250
Presenting Mireille's
secret room!

21
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,875
In other words,
a rare item storeroom.

22
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,250
Wow...

23
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:02,000
So you managed to get a
hidden room for your stuff?

24
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,041
This room is actually
a rare item itself!

25
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,416
But now...

26
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,625
...the one rare item I want
more than anything is...

27
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:12,416
[SHUGO]
Oooo...

28
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,708
What a nice
texture this has to it!

29
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:17,875
Let's get outta here.
C'mon Shugo.

30
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:20,375
Aaaahn, wait! Hang on!

31
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:24,041
I promise I'll never
say I want it ever again!

32
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,791
Well, it does sound
like an interesting place.

33
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:31,833
I suppose we can stay here for
a little bit longer, uh, okay?!

34
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,166
[RENA] Well?

35
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,625
So, whadya think?

36
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,750
It's just what
I thought I would find.

37
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:46,791
This bracelet is a
really high-level item.

38
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,333
How can you tell?

39
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:49,625
[MIREILLE] Look here.

40
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,291
The higher the level of an item,

41
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:54,875
the more resilient the materials
and the better the quality.

42
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,458
In terms of bracelets,

43
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,375
I'd say Shugo's is
the highest level item

44
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:00,125
you'll be able to
get in The World.

45
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,375
Whoa. This thing is?

46
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,791
[RENA and OHKA] Mireille!

47
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:09,166
 I-It's not like I actually SAID
that I wanted it for my own.

48
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,333
Your eyes say it all.

49
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:13,583
[SHUGO] But if this is
such an incredible bracelet,

50
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,000
then why...?

51
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,666
Wh-Why can't I move my sword?

52
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,000
Could the Data
Drain be effecting

53
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,125
everyone in the immediate area?

54
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,166
This is for scaring
me half to death!

55
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,791
Vak Don! Vak Don! Vak Don!

56
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:39,333
Why don't my spells work?

57
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:43,083
Oh, you are soooo brave!

58
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:46,666
I wonder what the
bracelet did back there?

59
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,583
t was obviously your fault.

60
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,083
Mm-hmm.

61
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,750
What?

62
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,083
If a player wants to use

63
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,541
such a high-level item as
it was meant to be used,

64
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:56,875
the player must also be

65
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:59,333
of a sufficiently
high level, as well.

66
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:02,250
Um, so you're saying
I can't control this thing?

67
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:04,958
Exactly!

68
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:08,375
Let's go get you trained!

69
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,208
[SHUGO] Right now?

70
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,041
[RENA] This is a
mid-class level area.

71
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,000
[SHUGO] But I...
I'm still a newbie.

72
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,125
[MIREILLE] Don't worry, Shugo.

73
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,166
I'm with you.

74
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,291
[SHUGO] Great.

75
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,541
Let's... GO!

76
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,000
All right! Let's have some fun!

77
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:24,791
[RENA] Yeah! You're on!

78
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,708
Hey!

79
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:29,458
Hey, Wait... for me.

80
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,666
Ah, a Squilla Demon!

81
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,875
Easy Win! Easy Win!

82
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,625
Vak Don!

83
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,791
You're in the way!

84
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,916
Big brother!

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,250
Shugo, you just stay back!

86
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,666
But I thought I was the one

87
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,166
who needed to fight to
level up in the first place.

88
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,500
It's all right!

89
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:14,166
All right? Huh...?

90
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:25,250
I've leveled up?
Is that right?

91
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,583
See? You don't have to
defeat an enemy directly,

92
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,291
you just have to
be a part of the fight

93
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,583
and then <i>your</i> level
will go up, too.

94
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:32,791
So, you can just sort of

95
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,958
swing your sword around
at the enemy's back.

96
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:37,458
Isn't this an easy
way to train, Shugo?

97
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,500
Huh...?

98
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,958
[BALMUNG]
Is that... for certain...?

99
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:45,958
[REKI] Yes.

100
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,500
I've checked many things,

101
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:50,416
but I only have some
vague conclusions.

102
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,666
Someone did open the
character campaign page,

103
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:56,166
but it's not clear who
that might have been.

104
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,208
[BALMUNG] What about
the system administrators?

105
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,375
I was sure to
check with them, too.

106
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:01,625
They informed me that they had

107
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:05,166
no specific answers for
me regarding the matter.

108
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,541
[BALMUNG] Then report
it as a Level One claim.

109
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:10,125
That should get a
reaction from someone.

110
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,125
Yes sir, understood.

111
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:19,500
[BALMUNG thinking]
Those two... It can't be...

112
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:20,666
[REKI] Lord Balmung...

113
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,125
Is this a puzzle
for today's event?

114
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,125
[BALMUNG]
Bamboo grass means pandas.

115
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:29,666
And in Japanese, "Pan - Da"
means: "It's - bread."

116
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,250
[OHKA]
Come here!

117
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:55,041
[MIREILLE] You're amazing,
Divine Fist Ohka!

118
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,416
Vak Don!

119
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,041
You still have a lot to learn.

120
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,666
Never let your guard down.

121
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,458
And never move
in a straight line,

122
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,541
just move side to side.

123
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,083
Right! Got it!

124
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:18,458
[MIREILLE]
 I'll get you all! Vak Don!

125
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:31,666
[SHUGO] Oh, wow! I can actually
feel myself getting stronger!

126
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,416
Ha! There's no doubt about it!
I'm leveling up like crazy.

127
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,916
[RENA] Ohka, you're the coolest!

128
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,541
[SHUGO] Rena! I'm amazing!

129
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:39,583
[RENA] I still have
a long way to go.

130
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,875
 At least I'm happy about it.

131
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:47,000
[RENA] Hey, Shugo, you've
leveled up quite a bit.

132
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,750
[SHUGO] You... really think so?

133
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:51,375
[OHKA] You've still
got a long ways to go.

134
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:54,166
Compared to Ohka,
a loong waaay!

135
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,458
Hmph.  I think
it's safe to say...

136
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:58,000
...you do, too, Rena.

137
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:02,041
Actually, Rena's level is much
higher than yours is, Shugo.

138
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,291
Huh? How can that be?

139
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,375
We started at
the exact same time.

140
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:07,916
Well, I've been doing a lot

141
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,666
of extra training in secret
when you weren't around, Shugo.

142
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,958
That's not fair.

143
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,125
Pretty sneaky, too

144
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,416
[RENA chuckles] Sorry.

145
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,125
[SHUGO] Hey! A treasure chest!

146
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,000
No, Shugo! Hang on!

147
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,708
[SHUGO cries out]

148
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:30,708
You should never rush to
open a trapped treasure chest.

149
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,125
You okay?

150
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,458
Well, that was
a level down trap.

151
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:40,875
Huh?

152
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:44,208
Well, Shugo, I'm afraid
you're back down to level one.

153
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,625
Level one?

154
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:49,166
Well, it's time to pick
yourself back up and try again.

155
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,333
Ugggh! I can't stand this!

156
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,375
Shugo, no!

157
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,583
Oh, man...

158
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:07,541
Why'd that girl ever choose me?

159
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,291
And why did she
give this thing to me?

160
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,750
[GRUNTY sneezes]

161
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:27,458
Huh? Hey... Is your pet sick?

162
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:28,833
Yes, he's sick!

163
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:31,458
And I don't know what to do!

164
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,666
[SHUGO] So you were asked
by a complete stranger...

165
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,875
[HOTARU] My name is
Hotaru, by the way,

166
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:39,625
and I've never
raised a Grunty before.

167
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,416
[SHUGO] Don't you have
any friends you can call?

168
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,583
[HOTARU] I do have one.

169
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,083
He's very dependable,

170
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:47,375
b-but I haven't
seen him at all today.

171
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:50,416
So it looks like
we're at a loss, huh?

172
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,500
[GRUNTY RANCHER]
Hmm. Oh! This is terrible.

173
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:06,125
This one definitely
has the Grunty Flu.

174
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:09,458
Didn't you have it vaccinated
for this type of thing?

175
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:13,458
It's a terrible sickness
for the little guy.

176
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:14,666
If you don't do anything for it,

177
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,875
it's going to die
within a few hours.

178
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,125
[gasps]

179
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,875
Well, there has to be a
way that we can save it!

180
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,916
The only medication for
this is the "Phoenix Feather."

181
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,583
And the only place one
can be found is far away,

182
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,875
deep within the dungeons of
the Blazing Purgatory Valley.

183
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:30,875
[SHUGO] Eh?

184
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,583
Do you know what
that area is like?

185
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:35,041
It's a pretty high level area.

186
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:39,000
It'll be an extremely
difficult quest for a newbie.

187
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,833
Should we... go?

188
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,458
It'll be fine.

189
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,958
I have strong friends
that can help us out!

190
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,750
[MOTHER]
Rena, you're at it again,

191
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,416
you've been playing
since lunchtime!

192
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,791
[RENA] But Mom, today's Sunday!
I can do anything I want!

193
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,458
[MOTHER] You play all week too!

194
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:01,666
Your school called and said

195
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,333
that you've been
cutting class a lot lately.

196
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:11,791
I'm not having any luck getting
in touch with anyone today.

197
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:12,791
How about you?

198
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:15,125
Nuh-uh. No one.

199
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:20,083
[GRUNTY whines]

200
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,958
Then we'll do it alone.
It's up to us!

201
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,833
[SHUGO] Blazing...

202
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:51,208
[SHUGO and HOTARU]
...Purgatory Valley.

203
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,500
 Is this the place?

204
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:10,750
All right, Fairy's Orb!

205
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,375
[HOTARU] What do
those marks tell us?

206
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:20,833
Ah, that's where monsters
are likely to come out.

207
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,666
[SHUGO] At our level,
if we fight the monsters here,

208
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,458
there's not much chance
we're gonna survive.

209
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:30,333
Now we have... this! Now this
thing is a Speed Charm.

210
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:32,000
It really speeds you up.

211
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:36,083
And, if we run into a monster,
we'll just use it to get away.

212
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,208
Mmm. I understand.

213
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:47,041
[SHUGO]
Pheeew! C'mon! This way!

214
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,625
Hey! It's a puppy!

215
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:11,916
So high...

216
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:24,500
[SHUGO] Hotaru...

217
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,375
Huh?

218
00:14:58,375 --> 00:14:59,666
[HOTARU] Shugo!

219
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,916
[HOTARU skrieks]

220
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,625
Hotaru!

221
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,125
[SHUGO] This is not good!

222
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,791
It's a dead end!

223
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,208
We've gotta get outta here!

224
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:33,000
[HOTARU] We can't!

225
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,041
[SHUGO] Eh?

226
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,500
If we just turn
around now, that...

227
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:38,250
that little Grunty is
surely going to die.

228
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,000
Ohhh...

229
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,041
We can't let it die.

230
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,375
That little guy's
counting on us.

231
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:46,541
Yeah, you're right.

232
00:15:57,041 --> 00:16:00,250
Shugo! Shugo,
are you all right?

233
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:01,750
I think so.

234
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,291
[SHUGO thinking]
If we use this...

235
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:12,875
But that's no good!

236
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,166
If it fails what will we do?

237
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,125
I'm still only level 1!

238
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,250
[HOTARU]
Stop!

239
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,541
A Grunty is going
to die without our help.

240
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,750
Please let us pass for its sake!

241
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,416
Hotaru! Get outta there!

242
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,041
Please listen to me!

00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,208
[gasps]

244
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,458
[SHUGO] Data Drain!

245
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,333
Aw! Yes!

246
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,625
Shugo, look!

247
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,208
What are you
doing playing around

248
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,833
with small fries
like these, Kite?

249
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,125
Eh?

250
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,833
Oh, Sanjuro!

251
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:25,208
Hey, I got your
email and raced here.

252
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:26,541
But if Kite is here with you,

253
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:29,708
there should be no worries
in a place like this.

254
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:32,750
I'm not... My name's not Kite.

255
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:33,791
S'cuse me?

00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:41,875
[SANJURO] I see...

259
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,125
So, you were the winner
of a character contest.

260
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:47,583
CC Corporation certainly
was most generous with you.

261
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,541
Ah!

262
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,875
The Phoenix Feather! This is it!

263
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,875
We did it!

264
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:01,375
He's just so playful...

265
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,375
[SANJURO] He seems to
really like you, Hotaru.

266
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,458
[HOTARU] You think so?

267
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,708
That makes me so happy...

268
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,541
[SHUGO] Yeah, you guys
look really good together.

269
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:09,375
[FEMALE FIGHTER]
What's going on?

270
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:10,708
He sounds so happy...

271
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:14,166
How cool, he's okay!
He's alive!

272
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,416
He looked like he'd
caught something

273
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,458
before I left and
I thought he was a goner.

274
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
So you knew? Then left?

275
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,250
Ah!

276
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:26,708
I can't thank you enough
for taking care of him!

Come here little guy!

want to go back with you.

take a turn for the worse.

282
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,583
Do you think someone
like that is qualified

283
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,083
to call themselves an owner?

284
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,708
[SHUGO] That's right!

285
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,583
The responsibilities
and obligations

286
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:51,083
of my own life are more
than enough work for me.

287
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,791
You can't expect to act
like that in a game, too.

288
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,458
It's just a Grunty, you guys.

289
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,250
JUST a Grunty, huh?

290
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:58,583
Do you have any idea what we had

291
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,500
to do to save this
little guy's life?!

Hey, who are these characters?

Who us?

301
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,791
Well, we're the ones
who were called

302
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:19,416
in just now on behalf
of "just a Grunty"!

303
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,791
Disappointing...

304
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:24,250
...that someone like
<i>you</i> could be an owner.

305
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:27,833
You're not even worthy
of being called a gamer.

306
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,375
[OHKA] You're coming with us.

307
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,208
[FEMALE FIGHTER] Hey, wait a
sec! What are you going to do?

308
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:32,458
[OHKA] We need to teach
you a little something

309
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:33,666
about how to treat others.

310
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,083
[FEMALE FIGHTER]
Can't we all just get along?

311
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,875
We should all be enjoying
this together... Friends?

312
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:40,291
You're gonna have to
give us just a minute.

313
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,833
[OHKA]
Hey, what do you think of that?

314
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:46,458
[FEMALE FIGHTER]
Hey, what are you doing to me?

315
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:47,833
[SANJURO] Uh...

316
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,333
[OHKA sighs] I feel
much better now...

317
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,583
[MIREILLE] Ah!

318
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,333
I always feel refreshed
when I do a good deed...

319
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:55,375
[RENA] Yep.

320
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,666
So, what just
happened back there?

321
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,583
I think it's better if we
don't know the details.

322
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,041
Where is...

323
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,708
Does anybody know
where Sanjuro went to?

324
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:07,875
Huh?

325
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,333
[SANJURO] It seems
that you've found

326
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,583
employment at the
CC Corporation...

327
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:19,500
I guess I should
congratulate you... Balmung.

328
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,583
It's not something
I'm happy about.

329
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:25,708
In any event, I have
a favor to ask of you.

330
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:27,250
[SANJURO]
Hmm?

331
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:32,125
Shugo, that new character
that looks exactly like Kite,

332
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,833
I want you to
start training him.

333
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:37,125
[SANJURO] Hmm... What for?

334
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:41,250
I'm afraid I'm not able to
elaborate right now. Except...

335
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:45,166
Twilight is drawing
ever more near...

336
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,250
...and that boy holds the key.

337
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:49,000
[SANJURO gasps]

338
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:01,083
Understood!

339
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:03,416
[RENA] I have event information!

340
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,791
In the area Distant Azure River

341
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:08,083
is the Festival of
the Weaver Maiden.

342
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:11,875
Hmmm. What should I wish for...
Uh, I'm the Weaver Maiden?

343
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:14,791
And I have to kiss
my brother?! Blech!
