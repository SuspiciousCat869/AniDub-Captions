00:00:11,375 --> 00:00:13,291
[NARRATOR 01A]
The 501st Joint Fighter Wing:

2
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:15,583
also known by the name
"Strike Witches."

3
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:17,666
They're a team of elite
aces who gained fame

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,666
in the battle
against the Neuroi.

5
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,333
These rare records
depict a side

6
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:24,500
of the Strike Witches that's
never been seen before now.

7
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:58,875
[YOSHIKA]
The 501st joint fighter wing

8
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:02,000
is humanity's main defense
against the Neuroi.

9
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:05,916
I'm Yoshika Miyafuyji, and I
joined up several days ago.

10
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,291
Part of my job is doing
the washing and cooking

11
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:11,583
every morning and night.
Being a soldier isn't easy!

12
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:13,541
I'd assumed most of
my duties at the front

13
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,833
would involve keeping people
safe from the Neuroi,

14
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:18,083
so this isn't quite
what I imagined.

15
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,666
But, it's not all that different
from being at home though!

16
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,291
Good morning, Miyafuji.

17
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,541
Oh, Barkhorn, hi!
Good morning to you!

18
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,333
Sorry you're stuck with that.

19
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:28,416
No, it's fine.

20
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,375
I do most of the
cooking at home, too.

21
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:32,583
Still, it's just 'cause
no one else wakes up in time.

22
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:33,500
Seems unfair.

23
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:35,000
Shows what I know.

24
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,125
I was under the impression
that all soldiers

25
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:39,833
were early risers
like Sakamoto.

26
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:42,041
Matter of fact, I've been
using her morning practice

27
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,833
as a sort of
natural alarm clock.

28
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:46,750
[BARKHORN] Funny. I thought
I was the only one who did that.

29
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,750
Before I came, did you
have to make breakfast

30
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:51,708
all by yourself?

31
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:54,375
No, we always took turns.

32
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,541
One of the perils of
military life is that,

33
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:59,666
even if the food is unbearable,
you're not allowed to complain.

34
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,625
Each morning I'd ask
the same question:

35
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:04,458
which would kill me first,
the food or the Neuroi?

36
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:07,833
The worst cook of the lot would
have to be Minna, no contest.

37
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:10,083
Wait, you mean Commander Minna?

38
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,625
[BARKHORN] If she heard
about a new health craze,

39
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:14,541
she'd incorporate it,
with no regard to flavor.

40
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,083
And during emergency missions,

41
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,166
she fed us gruel that
she'd partially dissolved

42
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,250
with diluted hydrochloric acid,
so we could eat it faster.

43
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:22,625
[YOSHIKA]
Uh...

44
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:25,791
[cackles] After all,
they do say cooking is caring,

45
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,125
motivated by love, right?

46
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,625
Uh, not sure that
counts, though.

47
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:30,833
I wish I could have tried it,

48
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,583
just so I could see
what it was like.

49
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,458
Trust me, you're
better off this way.

50
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,625
Oh, good morning, Yoshika!

51
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:37,791
You need any help?

52
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,000
Yeah, wanna make the salad?

53
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,458
That's one way to do it.

54
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,958
All done just let me know
if you need anything else!

55
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,125
Wait, what? No seasoning?

56
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,333
[BARKHORN] And she's one of
the better cooks around here.

57
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:52,458
--[clock chimes]
--Oh, that time already?

58
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,500
You mean, time to
wake everyone up?

59
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,500
[YOSHIKA] Would you mind if
I tagged along with you?

60
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:59,416
[BARKHORN] Huh? Are you saying
you've never done it before?

61
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,083
Yeah, and it's the
prefect chance for me

62
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,458
to see the other girls' rooms.

63
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,750
Sure, we'll be waking
up Lucchini first.

64
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:07,250
So, we'll need to bring
ropes and striker units.

65
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:10,125
But, like, we're just
gonna wake her up, right?

66
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,750
[BARKHORN] She's notorious
for never sleeping

67
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,166
in the same place twice,
which is a real pain.

68
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,875
She even sleeps
outside sometimes,

69
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:17,583
so I have to search for her.

70
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,541
Well, good morning, everyone!

71
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,958
[BARKHORN]
Perfect timing, Minna.

72
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,416
I'm pretty sure Lucchini
is already on her way

73
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,000
over here with Shirley.

74
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,250
And Sanya and Eila were
on night patrol duty,

75
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,375
so there's no need
to wake them up, either.

76
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,333
[BARKHORN]
Okay. So, if it's just Hartmann,

77
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:34,708
we only need this whacking
stick, nothing else.

78
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:38,083
But, like, we're just
gonna wake her up, right?

79
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,958
[MINNA]
Is Eila in Sanya's room?

80
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,500
You ready, Miyafuji?

81
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:43,666
Uh-huh!

82
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,750
Oh, sorry, but would you mind

83
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,500
keeping an eye
on the pot for me?

84
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:48,583
Be happy to!

85
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:51,291
I can do it! Everyone's
been low energy.

86
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:54,375
I wanna whip up something
to give 'em a boost!

87
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:55,916
Hartmann's a hero, right?

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,750
I heard she's famous in her
hometown, but is that true?

89
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,458
Yeah, I guess you
could say that.

90
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,000
[YOSHIKA]
I can't wait to see her room!

91
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,791
I bet she's got all her
shiny medals on display!

92
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,458
To be honest, I can't help
but be a little jealous!

93
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,666
Good morning, Hartmann.

94
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,958
[HARTMANN]
Morning, Trudy.

95
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,291
Oh, no!

96
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,250
I stepped on something--
sounded like it broke it!

97
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,791
Clean your room, pig!

98
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,541
And don't go back to sleep!

99
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,041
Is this how she is all the time?

100
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:27,458
'Fraid so. It's your
turn, Miyafuji.

101
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:28,541
So, um,

102
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,208
do we have to go
to Perrine's room,

103
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,041
or is she already up?

104
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:35,708
[PERRINE]
Major! I brought you a towel!

105
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,875
[SAKAMOTO]
Thanks, you're a real gem.

106
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,458
[BARKHORN]
That one gets up even earlier

107
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,958
than our natural alarm clock.

108
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:42,958
Good morning!

109
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,875
Hello, Shirley, Lucchini.

110
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,750
Lovely to see you
both this morning.

111
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,875
Ya know, since
Yoshika got here,

112
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:50,416
I look forward to meal time!

113
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,000
Aw, that's so nice!

114
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,958
Food should always be something
we look forward to.

115
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,166
You hungry?

116
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,041
[SHIRLEY]
Uh, nope.

117
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,875
I just asked her to
keep an eye on the pot

118
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:00,833
so it wouldn't burn!

119
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,166
Unsupervised?

120
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,500
Of course not, Lynne was here!

121
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,416
She came down with
a terrible stomach ache

122
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,458
and said she needed
to take the day off.

123
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,125
[SHIRLEY, HARTMANN]
The coward!

124
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:11,833
Well! It's chow time!

125
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:13,708
I whipped up something special!

126
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,291
[SHIRLEY]
That's it, we're done for!

127
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,125
I'll take one for
the team and try it.

128
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,625
Barkhorn, we need you,
please be careful!

129
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:21,833
Trudy, no!

130
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:24,125
Stop! Don't do this!

131
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:25,250
I must.

132
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:29,166
Barkhorn, no! Are you okay?

133
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,166
Uh, strategic retreat.

134
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,666
Yeah! I can't do it.
I just can't do it!

135
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,250
[MINNA]
Don't be so dramatic, girls.

It's full of nutrients!

137
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,541
Well, it smells more like
it's full of nutria, so.

138
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,041
[MINNA]
It's good for constipation!

139
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,666
Who needs to poop?

140
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,750
[YOSHIKA]
How can she smile

141
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,333
after trying to
poison us to death?

142
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,541
Now, we've got a long
day ahead of us,

143
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,375
so let's buckle down
and have breakfast.

[MINNA]
Minna's Special Healthy Soup!

150
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,416
Miyafuji, do you have a second?

00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,041
Yes! Of course!

152
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,416
I wanted to talk to you
about the training today.

153
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,750
Oh, you mean the marathon,

154
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,541
followed by sword practice,
weight-lifting,

155
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,291
and endurance runs?

156
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:19,000
Indeed. That was the
initial plan, but then...

157
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,208
I kept getting requests
to go easy on you

158
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,291
so that you'd still have
enough energy left over

159
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,208
to cook for everybody.

160
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,125
So, I decided it'd be
better to have you

161
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,500
shadow someone, instead.

162
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,000
Do you have any
preference as to who?

163
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:30,958
[SHIRLEY, HARTMANN]
Us!

164
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,000
[YOSHIKA]
Let's see.

165
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,958
I could maybe follow
Barkhorn around?

166
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:38,083
[BOTH]
Us! Us! Us! Us! Us!

167
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,458
Or, on second thought,
I could shadow these two.

168
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,041
They seem excited.

169
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,125
Uh. Maybe.

170
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,875
I don't know, ladies,
that might be a bad idea.

171
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,875
Aw, come on, you worry too much.

172
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,250
Yeah, you just leave it to us,

173
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,416
and you'll see what
a great idea it is!

174
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,708
You're talking to a super ace

175
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,875
from the land of
rules and regulations!

176
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,375
And a super ace from
the land of the free!

177
00:07:58,458 --> 00:07:59,916
[BOTH] What in the world
could there possibly be

178
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,083
to worry about with
this stellar team, huh?

179
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,416
Use your head, all right?

180
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,750
Forget everything but
the good parts, or else!

181
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:09,000
Uh. Lynne, would you
like to tag along?

182
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,500
Now that's an idea!

183
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:11,666
Go with them, Lynne.

184
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,416
If you're lucky,
you might learn something.

185
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,916
Major Sakamoto?

186
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,750
Yes, Lynne, what is it?

187
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,458
I would very much prefer
to spend the day

188
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,583
practicing my inherent
magic instead!

189
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,583
Like the whole day!

190
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,500
Oh. I see.

191
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:28,000
I like that you have goals,
so I wouldn't want to interfere.

192
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:29,166
Thank you.

193
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,500
[SHIRLEY, HARTMANN, YOSHIKA]
The coward.

194
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,916
Are you ready to get nice
and bronzed, Yoshika?

195
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,291
Ah, that's right, you're on
standby duty today. Good.

196
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,541
We'll be waiting
for you outside.

197
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,208
Did I bring sunscreen?

198
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:41,458
I hope so.

199
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,666
You'll be watching for
Neuroi with no shade.

200
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,166
Wait a second, I have
just the thing for you.

201
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,291
[HARTMANN] What? How do
expect to tan in that?

202
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,375
[SHIRLEY] Why are you
all covered up, Yoshika?

203
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:57,791
[YOSHIKA] Huh? How can I be the
one wearing the wrong thing?

204
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,041
It may not seem
like we're working,

205
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,791
but that's just how standby is!

206
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,541
She's right, there's
not much to do out here

207
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,416
but lay out and keep watch.

208
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,583
Exactly. So, we use
this time wisely

209
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,166
to keep our
superweapons on point!

210
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,166
Your superweapons?

211
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,875
Yeah! Our sexy bods
are superweapons,

212
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,416
so we gotta keep
'em lookin' hot!

213
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,500
Oh? Why don't you say
that again, nice and loud,

214
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,958
and see what happens
to your sexy bod!

215
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,791
Oh, I hope that you
didn't just imply

216
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,250
that we're slackers!

217
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,333
Do you even know what's on
the other side of this sea?

218
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:37,541
Huh? Neuroi-occupied,
mainland Europe!

219
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:40,041
Curse you, stupid Neuroi!
That's my homeland!

220
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,458
These comfy chairs allow us
to stay on watch for hours

221
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,416
without fatigue, don't you
dare rob us of that!

222
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,583
That makes sense.

223
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,666
I apologize for being
so quick to judge!

224
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,333
Apology accepted.

225
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:52,166
Just as long as you understand.

226
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,666
But, you're facing
Northern Europe.

227
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,666
Now stand up, both of you!

228
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,125
I'd watch out, Trudy.

229
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,750
You prob'ly shouldn't
lay a finger on us.

230
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,666
[BOTH] At this point
we're so sunburned that just

231
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,458
the thought of moving
hurts real bad!

232
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:06,958
[SHIRLEY, HARTMANN whine]

233
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,750
[YOSHIKA] Sakamoto,
I looked for the good parts

234
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,958
but didn't find any.

235
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,916
Well, forget about
those two morons.

236
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,750
Now that I'm here, it's time
to get some real training.

237
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,250
Yes, ma'am!

238
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,541
Learn from their pain.

239
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:19,833
Put this on to
protect your skin!

240
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,458
Uh...

241
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,833
[YOSHIKA] After Yoshika Miyafuji
was struck down with heatstroke.

242
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:29,208
Everyone went back to
taking turns in the kitchen,

243
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,916
just like they used to.

244
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,333
[HARTMANN]
Superweapon!

245
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:06,833
[MICHIKO]
Hi, there, everyone!

246
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:09,291
My name is Michiko Yamakawa
of the Fuso Empire,

247
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,500
and I'm Yoshika
Miyafuji's best friend!

248
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,083
Nice to meet you!

249
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,583
One day, Major Mio
Sakamoto approached

250
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:19,791
Yoshika and invited her to join
the 501st Joint Fighter Wing!

251
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:22,416
She accepted the
offer, of course!

252
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,666
In this segment,

253
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,666
I'll be introducing you
to the various members

254
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,000
of the illustrious 501st.

255
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,458
Okay, time for our first lesson!

256
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:35,875
Allow me to present the girls
of the 501st Joint Fighter Wing!

257
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,625
This unit is a dream team,

258
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:40,708
made up of the top aces
from all around the world!

259
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:43,250
First is the cool, stoic
ace pilot of Sueohmus.

260
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,791
Legend has it she's
never been hit!

261
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,541
Next, there's the
ace from Romanya.

262
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,250
She's normally not very serious,

263
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,750
but, in battle,
she's aggressive!

264
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,875
Then, there's the super ace from
the United States of Liberion!

265
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,625
Calm and collected
even when fighting Neuroi!

266
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:00,250
Lastly, the expert
fighter of Karlsland,

267
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,833
who holds the world
record for Neuroi kills!

268
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,833
Among other records
we won't mention.

269
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,000
All right!

270
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,000
That's just a few
of the legendary pilots

271
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,833
that make up this dream team!

272
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,000
Aren't they just wonderful?

273
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,583
I'm so proud of Yoshika.

274
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,208
I can't believe
we're best friends!

275
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,875
She gets to train
with these star aces!

276
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,291
[MICHIKO] Me, again!
Michiko Yamakawa from Fuso!

277
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,875
The military's known
for keeping things

278
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,500
well-maintained and
running smoothly!

279
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:31,041
I'm sure the base is
sparkling clean inside!

280
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:34,708
Next time: "501st,
clean your dirty rooms?"

281
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:37,291
You've never seen witches
like these before!
