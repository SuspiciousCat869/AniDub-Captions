1
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:46,166
It's been forever since
we've done day training.

2
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,666
Yeah, it's almost
weird to see you two

3
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,041
wearing your Striker Units.

4
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:50,208
[SHIRLEY]
What?

5
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:51,833
[YOSHIKA]
Hey, guys, I'm ready to train!

6
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:53,083
Miyafuji, you're late--

7
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:55,791
Uh, sorry.

8
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:58,208
[yelps] These two have
finally corrupted you

9
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:00,000
with their influence!

10
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:01,041
[SHIRLEY, HARTMANN]
How dare you!

11
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:02,875
We had nothing to do with this.

12
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:05,250
So, why can't you use
your Striker Unit?

13
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,375
I wish I could say,
but I don't know!

14
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:09,125
What I do know is that,
every time I've put on

15
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:11,666
my unit lately, it's
felt a little tight.

16
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,166
[BOTH]
I see.

17
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,541
[YOSHIKA]
And I have to work really hard

18
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:16,916
just to get off the ground!

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,333
[HARTMANN, SHIRLEY]
Could it be?

20
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:19,583
Could it be what?

21
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:21,500
Tell me what you think,
so I can fix it!

22
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:23,166
[SHIRLEY, HARTMANN]
You've gained weight?

23
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,541
I'll tell you more if you
promise not to get mad.

24
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:26,750
Okay.

25
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:29,458
Well, uh. You're way
more imposing lately.

26
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:30,666
[YOSHIKA]
Huh?

27
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,958
So, are ya thirsty?
You want a milkshake?

28
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:34,666
I know how much you love 'em!

29
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,583
Stop it! I'm not getting fat!

30
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:39,500
I eat exactly what
everyone else does!

31
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:40,791
[SHIRLEY]
You always say it's wasteful

32
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,291
not to clean your plate,
and you finish

33
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:44,416
everybody's leftovers!
You can't help it--

34
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,708
after all, you're the
mom of the 501st!

35
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,125
Oh, I get it.

36
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,291
It's partially our fault,
since we can never finish

37
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:53,250
all the food that you
give us. We're sorry.

38
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:54,750
Oh, no.

39
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:55,875
Hold the phone.

40
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,250
As her honorary big sister,

41
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,041
sometimes I help her
finish the leftovers.

42
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,875
Will that make me
gain weight, too?

43
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,250
Good job, Aunt Barkhorn,

44
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,125
you figured something out
by yourself for once!

45
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,250
Any issues besides
the flying thing?

46
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,875
No, I actually feel
better than ever.

47
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:10,000
Well, that's
something, at least.

48
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:11,500
Now heal Shirley and
she'll take a look

49
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:13,625
at your Striker Unit.

50
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:16,625
Sure, I'll help ya.
So, where's your unit?

51
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:18,541
Well, you see, uh.

52
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:21,083
Sakamoto said the best way
to fix my Striker Unit

53
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,708
was to just punch it repeatedly.

54
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:24,958
So, I did that, and
now it's even worse.

55
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:26,375
[SHIRLEY groans]

56
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:27,541
It could also be mental,

57
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,500
like a psychological
block or something.

58
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:32,916
Yeah, maybe she's suffering
from Spring Fever.

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,750
Master of all things
Spring Fever.

60
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,000
Bestow us with your wisdom!

61
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,250
Too lazy!

62
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,625
A true master.

63
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,250
Ridiculous.

64
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,541
Oh, yeah?

65
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:43,125
Spring Fever is a
well-documented phenomenon,

66
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:44,375
but you don't believe?

67
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:47,666
Don't make assumptions
about me. I suffer, too!

68
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,250
I've even allotted extra time
this month for slacking off!

69
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,500
Wow. A true master.

70
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,041
In any case.

71
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,250
We'll figure out a solution
to your Striker Unit problem,

72
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,791
don't worry.

73
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:00,541
For now, let's focus on how
to get you to the battlefield.

74
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,791
Piggyback! Hop on, Miyafuji!

75
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,958
That's a negative!
Carry me in your arms!

76
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,333
[SHIRLEY] Lately she treats me
like I'm just a pair of boobs,

77
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:09,916
but I have a heart under here!

78
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,291
[YOSHIKA]
Let's go!

79
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,333
I wanna fly 60 miles per hour,
the speed of dreams!

80
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:14,750
[HARTMANN]
Jerks.

81
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:15,791
[BARKHORN] At this point,
there's nothing we can say

82
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,458
to get through to her.

83
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:20,083
The 501st has an
image to uphold!

84
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:23,166
You have to consider how
others might perceive this.

85
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,791
[HARTMANN]
Hold on, I have an idea.

86
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,750
Shirley, help me out here?

87
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,166
Ta-dah!

88
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,791
[YOSHIKA]
She's hiding under the coat?

89
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,583
[BARKHORN] Well, I guess that's
kind of an improvement.

90
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,250
Oh, wow! Now look!

91
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,666
[BARKHORN yelps]

92
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,708
[HARTMANN]
Hey, Lucchini! Hello!

93
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:38,583
[screams]

94
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:41,375
You better stop screwing around!

95
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,250
Come on, you guys.
How hard can it be?

96
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,875
Just carry her around
like this, jeez.

97
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,750
I'm sorry.

98
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,708
Right, I'll focus
on firing my gun.

99
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,875
You try to keep a shield up
around us while we fly.

100
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,041
Okay!

101
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,458
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Hot!

102
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,000
The cartridges are burning me!

103
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,291
Get them off me, quick!

104
00:04:58,375 --> 00:04:59,750
Sorry.

105
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,083
[YOSHIKA]
No... I'll be okay.

106
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,166
I think Sanya's the
only witch whose weapon

107
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,458
doesn't use cartridges.

108
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,375
I dunno, without
my inherent magic,

109
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:11,375
she felt heavy, even for me.
But I didn't say that.

110
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,000
[HARTMANN]
I think Sanya can handle it.

111
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:16,458
She's one of the strongest
witches in the whole 501st.

112
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:20,083
Okay, then. Let's go see
if she's up for it.

113
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:23,166
Ah, well, there's one
added complication.

114
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,375
Rawr, rawr!

115
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,666
[BARKHORN]
Come on, Eila, relax!

116
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,416
This is all your fault!
I hold you responsible!

117
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,041
What did you guys do?

118
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,708
To be honest,
I think we both might

119
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,416
be innocent, for once.

120
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,458
I foresaw a future where
you guys were bugging

121
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,125
the crap out of Sanya,
so I warned her,

122
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,500
and now she refuses
to leave her room!

123
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,000
So, like I said,
it's all your fault!

124
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,833
[GROUP]
Uh...

125
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:45,250
[SHIRLEY]
We can't apologize to her

126
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:46,875
if she won't let anyone see her.

127
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:49,250
Well you can't see her,
and that's final!

128
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,625
What do we do?

129
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:53,666
Guess we'll have to
break out the big guns...

130
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,541
...and use the spare key!

131
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,791
Uh, why do you even have that?

132
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,708
Sanya gave it to me
so I could come hang out

133
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,416
with her any time I want to.

134
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,916
Shut up, you're
stalking her, you liar!

135
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,750
Sorry to bug you
on your day off!

136
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:09,750
No. I said you could come
hang out any time you want.

137
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,666
[EILA]
Why? Why would you say that?

138
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,375
'Cause she's my friend?

139
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:16,916
[YOSHIKA] Dang. That had to
feel like a punch to the gut.

140
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,750
I figured you wouldn't
need your own key

141
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,541
to my room, since
you and I spend

142
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,666
all of our time
together, anyway.

143
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,750
Oh, well, that makes sense!

144
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,916
[YOSHIKA] I dunno, sounds
like a lame excuse to me.

145
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,458
So, we're hoping
you guys could do

146
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:32,666
a combination attack thingy
until Miyafuji can lose weight.

147
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,291
Oh. Miyafuji, I've
been looking for you.

148
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,833
We figured out the real reason
you haven't been able to fly.

149
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:38,958
Huh?

150
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,333
As you've matured
and gotten stronger,

151
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,500
your magic improved so much
that your Striker Unit

152
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,416
just couldn't keep up anymore.

153
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,208
Wait. Then it's not
because I'm too plump?

154
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,333
Why would that prevent
you from flying?

155
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,833
It's because of all the combat
experience you've gained.

156
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,208
It is?

157
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:54,625
Yeah, look around.

158
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,041
You've been using
your healing magic

159
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,958
--every day since you got here.
--[YOSHIKA gasps]

160
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,958
Hey! Wow! That's great!

161
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,833
Ha! I guess you have
us to thank, huh?

162
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:05,083
I knew all along it wasn't
because you got fat.

163
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:08,583
[sighs] All that fuss today
ended up being for nothing.

164
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:09,875
I wouldn't say for nothing.

165
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,791
We did learn that we
need a contingency plan

166
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,458
for when the Striker
Units break down.

167
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:16,750
Yeah, and I suppose I learned
a lot about myself, too!

168
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:17,833
[HARTMANN]
You did?

169
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,666
Oh, yes. Valuable stuff.

170
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,958
I discovered that you think

171
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,250
I've been getting
a lot more imposing.

172
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:26,083
And I learned I shouldn't
be eating all your leftovers.

173
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,708
From now on, you'll
be cleaning your plates!

174
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,333
[YOSHIKA] Lucchini's
inherent magic is called.

175
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:37,125
"Sunlight Strike!" She
turns her magical energy

176
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,583
into heat energy,
which really comes in handy

177
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,666
on cold winter days!

178
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,375
Good morning, everyone!

179
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,041
It sure is a chilly one, huh?

180
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,916
Yeah. It's rare to
get a cold snap

181
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,625
so late in the season.

182
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,416
Gah! She overheated!

183
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,916
Miyafuji! You better
come heal her, quick!

184
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,666
[YOSHIKA]
Put her outside.

185
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,291
Hey, do you think we
could use the fireplace?

186
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:58,916
You should be more
like the Major.

187
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,625
She's been outside
training in the cold

188
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,500
since the sun came up today.

189
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,916
Now, that's what I
call a real soldier.

190
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,500
Take a page from her book.

191
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,250
Hey. Trudy, check it out.

192
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,541
What is it?

193
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:12,208
[SAKAMOTO laughing]

194
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,083
Miyafuji, explain.

195
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:15,916
There's this winter
tradition in Fuso

196
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,833
where you rub yourself
down with a towel.

197
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:20,333
It's for health
reasons, supposedly.

198
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,541
Major! Trudy wants
a word with you!

199
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:25,041
No, I do not!
I get it, it's cold!

200
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,708
You can use the fireplace!

201
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,708
[YOSHIKA]
She got spooked.

202
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,833
What are you doing
with that poker?

203
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,625
Trying to see if the
chimney is clear enough

204
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:35,166
to ventilate smoke.

205
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,833
It needs to be cleaned
before we can start a fire.

206
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,250
Next step, firewood.

207
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,750
We'll go chop some.

208
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,083
You two stay in here and get
going cleaning the chimney.

209
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,958
Don't worry, you
can count on us!

210
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,583
We'll get it clean!

211
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,833
I wonder what
happened to the axe.

212
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,458
Sakamoto's right outside.

213
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,958
I'm sure she would
lend us her katana.

214
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,458
Thank you, Miyafuji.

215
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,750
Sure! I'll be right back.

216
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,625
Ah, great, there
she is. Hey, Sakamo--!

217
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,333
There could be men
on this base, too.

218
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:04,875
What in the world
were you thinking?

219
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,041
Yeah, she's right!

220
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,500
It may be cold,
but that doesn't mean

221
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,250
people aren't gonna be around!

222
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,500
I mean, everybody
in Fuso does it

223
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:12,750
as a way to stay healthy.

224
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,083
Everyone?

225
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,625
[YOSHIKA] Uh. I think I'd
better keep out of this.

226
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:20,250
Miyafuji! I know you're there.
Don't hide. Show yourself.

227
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,125
[yelps]

228
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,250
You better tell me what
you're doing out here,

229
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:25,708
and it better be
something wholesome.

230
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,250
[PERRINE] You saw that
the major was naked

231
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,250
and you seized the opportunity
to ogle her bits!

232
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,250
No it's, um...

233
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,625
She understands.

234
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,916
This may seem odd to you
Puritans, but it's normal.

235
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,291
Maybe it is.

236
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,416
Sorry for judging you.

237
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,208
Now show them how
it's done, Miyafuji.

238
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:43,333
[YOSHIKA] Sorry! Can't
right now! Gotta go!

239
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,208
[SAKAMOTO]
Huh?

240
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,750
You lied, it isn't normal!

241
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,750
How could you?

242
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:48,916
Welcome back.

243
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,041
Jeez, it's a veritable
warzone out there.

244
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,000
We'd better stay indoors
just to be safe.

245
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,625
Okay.

246
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,500
[YOSHIKA] I feel sorry for
the girls on night patrol.

247
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,250
They're gonna be
freezing tonight!

248
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:01,125
Well, we'd better make sure
we can get a fire going, then.

249
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,208
Hang on. The wood's
already chopped,

250
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:04,875
so I'm guessing you
found the axe.

251
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,000
Did not.

252
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:08,166
[YOSHIKA]
Barkhorn's a beast--

253
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,166
it's a miracle
Hartmann's still alive.

254
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,166
You're good with that thing.
You been practicing?

255
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,333
No, but I used to have
to do a similar chore

256
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,208
back at home.

257
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:18,791
Lighting a fire for the bath?

258
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,333
No, killing chickens.

259
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:21,166
Huh?

260
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,541
Huh?

261
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,916
Okay, that's probably
enough for right now.

262
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,583
This will make things
a lot more pleasant.

263
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:29,125
[SHIRLEY]
C'mon! Clean! Hurry up!

264
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,833
They'll be back soon!
Inherent magic: "Acceleration!"

265
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,333
[HARTMANN] Wax on! Wax off!
Wax on! Wax off!

266
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,541
No! I promise,
it's not how it looks!

267
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,416
Yeah! Some snow
got into the room!

268
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,916
It's fresh powder! So beautiful?

269
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,208
We thought it'd be faster to use

270
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:44,916
our Striker Units to
clean the chimney,

271
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,666
but all it did was blow soot
all over the room, our bad.

272
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,916
It was an honest mistake.

273
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,333
Barkhorn, no!

274
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,541
Using magic for
violence is wrong!

275
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,250
Better use this poker instead.

276
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,625
Good call!

277
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,583
[BOTH] Her creepy smile
is like a suspense mystery!

278
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,958
You're the culprit!

279
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,791
[MICHIKO]
Hello, everyone!

280
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:39,458
It's time for Michiko Yamakawa's
Strike Witches classroom!

281
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,000
Today, we'll be
learning all about

282
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:44,583
Sanya Vladimirovn Litvyak.

283
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:48,166
Sanya originally
comes from Orussia!

284
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,708
And before joining the military,

285
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,083
she was busy studying
music in Vienna.

286
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,416
That's in Ostmark!

287
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,750
She's very graceful,
and shier than most

288
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,125
of the other witches.

289
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,708
She has an ethereal,
delicate beauty, like a flower.

290
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,458
So, the others
call her "Lilija,"

291
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,583
which means "the white lily."

292
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,625
But, just like the
other Strike Witches,

293
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,666
she's strong and
fierce in battle.

294
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,375
She carries a huge
Fliegerhammer rocket launcher,

295
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,541
and never fails to fight
courageously against the Neuroi.

296
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,583
No lesson about Sanya
would be complete

297
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,875
without a discussion of
her incredible abilities

298
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,750
as a night witch.

299
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,958
While on night patrol,
she can use her magic

300
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,833
to guard the entire base
and surrounding area.

301
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:29,291
Just like her world-famous
radio broadcast,

302
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,500
her patrolling skills
are one of the main things

303
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,000
people think of when
they hear the term,

304
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:35,500
"Strike Witches!"

305
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:36,916
My best friend gets to work

306
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,416
with an incredible witch!
Yoshika's amazing!

307
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,083
[MICHIKO]
Me again, Michiko Yamakawa!

308
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:51,208
Yoshika tells me that summertime
in Europe gets really hot!

309
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:54,458
I wonder how the members
of the 501st cool off!

310
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:57,750
Next time: "501st,
Are You Feeling the Heat?"

311
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:00,250
You've never seen witches
like these before!
