1
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:44,500
Wow, Mio. Your hair's
gotten really long.

2
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:46,041
Yeah, you're right.

3
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:48,166
Maybe I'd better give
it a trim today.

4
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,791
Oh, do you cut it yourself?

5
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:52,666
Yeah. I'll just do it now.

6
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,791
Hey! Stop it!

7
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:56,708
Jeez! What do you
think you're doing?

8
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:58,708
Cutting my bangs, obviously.

9
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:00,750
You're becoming a
young woman, Mio.

10
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:02,958
It's time to start treating
your hair with respect.

11
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:04,500
Oh, gotcha.

12
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:07,083
You're saying that I need to
treat a haircut like Seppuku?

13
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:08,125
Never mind.

14
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:10,583
Why don't you let me
cut it for you?

15
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:13,541
[laughs] You look like
my mommy right now,

16
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,666
you know that?

17
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,708
Watch your mouth.

18
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:18,750
I could have you
court-martialed.

19
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:20,083
Right. Here goes nothing!

20
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:22,041
Oh! Commander, I have a--

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,291
What? Seppuku?

22
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,666
No! You've got it wrong!

23
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,833
Ah, I see.

24
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,666
You were just giving
her a haircut.

25
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,291
Yeah, just a haircut.
What's the message?

26
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:36,333
The higher ups want you to
come and see them, please.

27
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,833
What? Right now?

28
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:38,833
Yeah.

29
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:39,583
Like, now?

30
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,833
Like, right away.

31
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:43,208
But, I'm busy.

32
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:44,375
Uh...

33
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,583
So, Mio. What kind of
style do you want?

34
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,916
Commander!

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,833
You can't get out of this,
you have to go.

36
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:51,500
I'm sure they just
wanna tell me that

37
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:55,208
they're opposed to my plan,
so why can't it wait till later?

38
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,541
Everyone who isn't busy,

39
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:58,708
please gather in
the office at once.

40
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,083
Can't. Too busy.

41
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,708
Yeah, I'm super busy, too.

42
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,958
I couldn't even stop
if I wanted to.

43
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:05,750
What a bunch of crap.

44
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:08,625
[MINNA] Correction:
everyone except Lucchini,

45
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,666
Hartmann and Shirley,
who have proven their

46
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,458
utter uselessness once again,
to no one's surprise.

47
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:14,333
[ALL gasp]

48
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:15,666
Hey, you guys.

49
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,166
Good news. You three don't
have to go to the offi--

50
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,666
They disappeared!

51
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,625
Oh. You're cutting
the major's hair?

52
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:22,875
That's serious business!

53
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,416
I told you guys you
didn't have to be here!

54
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,250
Miyafuji. Can you handle this?
Please help me out.

55
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,125
[YOSHIKA]
Uh, okay.

56
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,375
I just need it to not
hang down in my eyes.

57
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:34,958
Please lemme do it!

58
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:35,875
Anyone else?

59
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,000
I wanna do it!

60
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,208
[SHIRLEY]
Major.

61
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,708
I can't sit back and
watch you rob this girl

62
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,625
of her dreams,
it hurts too much!

63
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,750
[HARTMANN] Don't you think
she deserves a better future?

64
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,541
One that doesn't involve
potentially dying

65
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:49,500
a fiery death in combat?

66
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:52,208
Okay, fine. I'll let you do it.

67
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:53,291
[YOSHIKA]
I guess they've forgotten

68
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:56,125
all about Sakamoto's future.

69
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,125
Do you have any
persistent itchiness?

70
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,166
No, it cleared up.

71
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,750
Such a welcome sight.

72
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,166
[HARTMANN] It's nice to
have this kind of peace

73
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,250
once in a while.

74
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:05,625
We have different
ideas of "peace."

75
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:06,958
[LUCCHINI sneezes]

76
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,125
What happened?

77
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,875
Please, not another
word, major!

78
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,166
Don't say anything mean!

79
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,041
She's already crying as it is!

80
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:15,958
[BOTH]
Don't worry!

81
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,291
You still look amazing!

82
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:18,791
Then look at me!

83
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,250
Will you three just
leave me alone

84
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:21,916
and let Commander Minna do it?

85
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,291
Don't do anything hasty!

86
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:26,000
It's gonna be fine! Seriously!

87
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,916
[YOSHIKA]
Guess I'll have to make it fine.

88
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,541
[GROUP]
You're a life saver, Miyafuji!

89
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,875
I promise you, that will
never happen again.

90
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,041
So, don't worry.

91
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,708
How could I not worry?

92
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,208
Hang in there, Lucchini.

93
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,333
I can't repeat that performance!

94
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:41,041
Trust me, I got it.

95
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,500
How can she sleep through this?

96
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,500
Oh, I always nap
through a haircut.

97
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:47,708
[LUCCHINI sneezes]

98
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,333
I can't believe I
trusted you guys.

99
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:55,958
Aw, come on, Miyafuji.

100
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,291
You better get
to work fixing it!

101
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,000
Don't let us down, okay?

102
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,791
[BOTH laugh]

103
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,541
[MINNA forced laughter]

104
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,125
[MINNA] Miyafuji. You should
have put a stop to this.

105
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,291
[YOSHIKA]
I know, sorry.

106
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,166
Miyafuji isn't to blame.

107
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,041
The officer who gave the
order should be punished.

108
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,916
That's how the military works.

109
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,041
Be quiet, Hartmann.

110
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,458
If something terrible happens,

111
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:21,541
I want you to deliver my
eulogy, and make it good.

112
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,125
I assumed the major
would be happy

113
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:24,750
with any kind of hairdo!

114
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:26,625
So, you made an
ass of all of us.

115
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:27,875
Commander Minna.

116
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,375
Do you remember how long
her hair was originally?

117
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:31,708
I'm not sure exactly,

118
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,625
but I think Perrine could
help you with that.

119
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,416
Oh, that's right!
Perrine would remember!

120
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,458
[MINNA] Oh, wow.
She passed out, I guess.

121
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,583
[YOSHIKA] Why did she
do it right here, though?

122
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:43,083
[PERRINE yelps] I had a
terrible dream that the major

123
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,250
was killed in action!

124
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,375
[YOSHIKA]
So, then you saw what happened?

125
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,458
I understand what's
going on, leave it to me!

126
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:50,000
Perrine will make it right!

127
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,208
[MINNA] Oh, good,
I'm so glad to hear it!

128
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:55,375
No! I messed up!
One millimeter too short!

129
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,500
Miyafuji! Recovery magic!

130
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,875
[PERRINE] Ah! I cut this part
a little too short, help!

131
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,041
[MINNA]
Miyafuji!

132
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:02,375
[PERRINE]
And this part! And here, too!

133
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:05,958
[MINNA] Miyafuji, hurry!
Please! It's an emergency!

134
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:08,625
[BOTH scream]

135
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:11,208

Blunt bangs are the best bangs.

[MINNA humming]

137
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:16,000
[YOSHIKA] Hey, what are all
these fancy decorations for?

138
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,833
[BARKHORN]
Oh, they're for Christmas Day.

139
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:20,000
[YOSHIKA]
Oh, that's right!

140
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,625
'Cause Lucchini's
birthday was yesterday.

141
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:23,958
[YOSHIKA, BARKHORN]
Huh?!

142
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,166
All right, girls. I think
it's past time we had

143
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,041
a little welcome
party for Miyafuji!

144
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,708
What is it, Trudy?

145
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,125
We're a bit late.

146
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:35,083
Seriously, we're already,
like, super close buddies!

147
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:38,208
Yeah, a little too
close, if you ask me.

148
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:39,833
Things were so busy
when she got here

149
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,583
that we never got the
chance to welcome her.

150
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:42,958
Good call, Commander!

151
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:46,875
The ideal leader always
appreciates her troops.

152
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,458
[SHIRLEY, HARTMANN] Could you
please not look at us like that?

153
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:50,750
But wouldn't it
be better to have

154
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:53,000
her welcome party when
everyone can be there?

155
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:56,458
Okay. Then, why don't we say
the 501st is celebrating

156
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,250
Mother's Day, and we're
thanking Miyafuji

157
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,250
for all the "mom duties"
she takes on?

158
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,750
[HARTMANN]
Miyafuji? Our mom?

159
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,625
[SHIRLEY] So the Commander's
our mom's mom?

160
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,375
Our grandma?

161
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:08,375
Why would you say that,
knowing you'd get a smack?

162
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:11,208
All right. Wait outside
till we're ready, Miyafuji.

163
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:12,208
[YOSHIKA whimpers]

164
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,125
We're gonna cook
for you this time!

165
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:17,541
You just stay here, relax,
and enjoy yourself!

166
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:20,500
[HARTMANN] Does that mean
the commander's gonna cook?

167
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,833
Why are you guys
using hand signals

168
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:27,500
when the medic's not
even in the room?

169
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,625
So, how should we
divide up the work?

170
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:31,666
Someone can do snacks
and party favors,

171
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,041
and someone else could
cook the main dishes?

172
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,791
What's this?

173
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,125
Guys! Come quick!

174
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,041
I think I found the get-up
the commander uses

175
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,500
to transform into a Neuroi!

176
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,125
[yelps] Put that up, now!

177
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,666
Don't cause any more problems!

178
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,166
It's looking more and more like

179
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,500
getting the party cancelled
was a pipe dream after all.

180
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,083
Hey, Hartmann?

181
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,625
You've eaten a lot of Miyafuji's
cooking, haven't you?

182
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:55,500
The stinky stuff? You
remember how it tastes?

183
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,416
No, not even a little.

184
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,208
When I eat it,
I always pass out.

185
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:01,000
So, I don't remember anything.

186
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:04,375
If you can't remember, then
what are you so afraid of?

187
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:07,416
It must be buried in
my subconscious mind!

188
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,791
That settles it!

189
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,750
I hail from the fair
country where we even

190
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,333
sweeten watermelon
with whip cream.

191
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,208
So! I'll be in
charge of dessert!

192
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:17,458
Awesome, then I'll go track
down some firecrackers, 'kay?

193
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,250
You know what's at stake, right?

194
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,208
This is Miyafuji's party.

195
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,083
We better go all out
for this one.

196
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,583
Heck yeah.

197
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,833
Dessert will literally
be dynamite!

198
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:29,958
I'll make a gunpowder cake
in the pressure cooker!

199
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:30,958
Right. Let's do this.

200
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,916
Or let's not!

201
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,708
Dynamite for dessert--
are they that stupid?

202
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,958
Come on, what are
you waiting for?

203
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,458
Go after them, Trudy,
before they kill us all!

204
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:41,708
[BARKHORN]
It's a joke!

205
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,333
I don't care.

206
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,458
They're dangerous
without supervision!

207
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:46,791
Let me handle the
cooking while you

208
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,458
go beat the rules
into their heads!

209
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,083
The rules?

210
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,833
I'll take care of
things on this end;

211
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,250
you had better move out.

212
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,833
[YOSHIKA] This makes me happy,
but a little sad, too.

213
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:00,750
'Cause getting things ready for
a party is my favorite part.

214
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,083
[HARTMANN, SHIRLEY chattering]

215
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,000
I can hear all the commotion.

216
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,458
[BARKHORN] I told you, never
bring dynamite into the house!

217
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:08,833
What's your problem?

218
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,708
What kind of moron puts
candles on a dynamite cake?!

219
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:14,833
I hope the Neuroi come soon.

220
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:18,708
We're finally ready.
You better enjoy it.

221
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:23,250
[YOSHIKA gasps] You guys! This
is just the nicest thing ever!

222
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:25,416
[YOSHIKA] They must've gone
through a lot of ideas

223
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,583
before they settled on this one.

224
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:30,583
Before we get started,
here's a card for you from Eila.

225
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:31,666
[SHIRLEY]
She knew this would happen,

226
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,208
so she requested night patrol!

227
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,458
[HARTMANN]
Clever girl.

228
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:35,958
[EILA]
Dear Miyafuji,

229
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:38,333
Even though it's been a while
since you joined, welcome!

230
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:39,833
I don't need any of
the food or drinks

231
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:41,083
that'll be served at the party.

232
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,500
So, don't bring me
any! Heart, Eila.

233
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,125
Whoops, forgot a gift!
Whelp, better go get one!

234
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,750
We're going into town!

235
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,750
You can't leave!

236
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,250
Right! Now, a toast to Miyafuji!

237
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,041
[ALL]
Here, here!

238
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,000
[SHIRLEY, HARTMANN]
Glance.

239
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,583
Not drinking?

240
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:59,791
I know Eila's note is bugging
you, but gimme a break.

241
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,666
[SHIRLEY]
Get out while you still can!

242
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,166
Wow. Guess that girl
can't hold her liquor.

243
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,541
[SAKAMOTO]
This is booze?

244
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,291
She got drunk and passed out?

245
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:10,375
Is this why Takei told us
not to give you alcohol?

246
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,833
[BARKHORN] Wait, alcohol?
Like disinfectant alcohol?

247
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,750
[MINNA] If you can't handle it,
let me know next time.

248
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:15,583
I'll water it down.

249
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,416
Miyafuji, save yourself!

250
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,041
[BARKHORN]
I'm so ashamed.

251
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,666
I'd like the two of
us to forget about

252
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,333
the past and start over again.

253
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:26,208
Yeah! That's a
wonderful idea!

254
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,166
I'll start over from
when I made the decision

255
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,083
to join the military in Fuso!

256
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,708
Are you telling me
you're gonna quit?

257
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,625
[MINNA]
Ethanol, yay!

258
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,583
[MICHIKO]
Hi, everybody!

259
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:10,541
It's time for Michiko Yamakawa's
Strike Witches Classroom!

260
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,125
Today, I'd like
to introduce you

261
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:15,041
to one of the finest witches
ever to come out of Fuso.

262
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,583
Mio Sakamoto!

263
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,750
She fought her first
battle eight years ago

264
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,666
in the Fuso Sea Incident.

265
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,208
And she's been fighting
for humanity ever since!

266
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:27,375
She's one of the most veteran
witches in the entire world.

267
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:30,333
She's easygoing, friendly,
bold, and honorable,

268
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,458
and she cares deeply
about her troops.

269
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,375
She's the ideal witch
on all fronts!

270
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:37,500
Also, the other witches
call her, "The Samurai,"

271
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,416
and when she takes her
Fuso sword in hand

272
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,583
and charges at the
Neuroi, watch out!

273
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:44,916
She'll rip the enemy to shreds
in the blink of an eye!

274
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,291
Speaking of eyes,
her inherent ability

275
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,958
is "Magic Eye." Her right
eye is normally covered

276
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,750
by a patch, but
when she uses it,

277
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,916
she can identify
a Neuroi's core!

278
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,833
That's pretty amazing,
dontcha think so?

279
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:59,083
She's also a great
judge of character.

280
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,208
She recognized Perrine
and Yoshika's talents

281
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,958
immediately and didn't
hesitate for a moment

282
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:07,208
to invite them to
join the 501st.

283
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,791
She's a really
wonderful person.

284
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,333
Right, Yoshika?

285
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,708
[MICHIKO]
Michiko Yamakawa again!

286
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,791
I've heard that fighting
a long war can play games

287
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,625
with your mind, but I'm
sure that doesn't happen

288
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,750
with the 501st!

289
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:25,750
Next time!

290
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:28,208
"501st, Are You
Feeling Stressed?"

291
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,791
You've never seen witches
like these before!
