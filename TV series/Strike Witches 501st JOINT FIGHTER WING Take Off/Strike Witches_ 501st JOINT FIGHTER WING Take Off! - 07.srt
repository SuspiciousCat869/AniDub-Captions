1
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,666
Time for night patrol.
I'd better wake up.

2
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,875
It's okay, doze a little longer.

3
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:50,916
[HARTMANN, SHIRLEY]
Ready, go!

4
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,916
What's with those looks?

5
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,125
[BOTH]
Congrats, friends!

6
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:56,583
[EILA] What the--?
Come on, guys, stop it!

7
00:01:57,958 --> 00:02:01,625
[EILA] Are they showering us...
like it's our wedding?

8
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:03,500
Hey, knock it off!

9
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:07,208
Soybeans? What is the
meaning of all this?

10
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:10,458
[YOSHIKA]
February 3rd. Setsubun time.

11
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:11,875
Is that all it was?

12
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:13,875
Some weird, old
tradition from Fuso?

13
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:15,458
Yeah, we were
throwing beans at them

14
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:17,208
to drive away the <i>oni</i> .

15
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:20,041
<i>Oni</i> are kind of like what you
Westerners call, "devils."

16
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,750
When the <i>oni</i> get hit
with the soybeans,

17
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:24,500
it sends them running away,
screaming in pain.

18
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:27,750
So, it seems those two have got
the right idea, unfortunately.

19
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:30,500
That tradition sounds
messier than it's worth.

20
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:34,083
The soybeans...

21
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:35,666
They breached the wall.

22
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,333
You're supposed to throw
these at <i>oni</i> devils, right?

23
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:40,375
I think I'm starting
to like this tradition.

24
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,375
Here you go, throw them
right at this little demon.

25
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:44,708
Her boobs make great targets.

26
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,416
[BARKHORN] I'm not perfect,
either. No one is, I guess.

27
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,958
Sorry, I went a little
overboard with

28
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:52,000
my disciplinary actions and
created extra work for you.

29
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,500
Oh, it's okay.

30
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,333
I understand that the
way you punish them

31
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,000
is only tough love,
meant to help them

32
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,625
become better people
in the future.

33
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:01,250
[gasps] You get me!

34
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:02,458
[yelps]

35
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:04,625
It's hard to believe
that taskmaster actually

36
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:09,208
has a softer side. That's the
power of Miyafuji's love.

37
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:10,500
What's with you?

38
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,791
You're wrong.
That's something else.

39
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,250
It's not love.

40
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:16,541
It's called Stockholm Syndrome.

41
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,833
People who've been
kidnaped or held hostage--

42
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:20,666
they sometimes come
to trust or fall in love

43
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,416
with their captors to cope
with stress and trauma.

44
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,416
Miyafuji was snatched
away from her home

45
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,000
in Fuso, carted to the front
lines, and hasn't been allowed

46
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,291
to leave since the day
she came on base.

47
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:33,166
That's heavy. I can't believe
I didn't see it before.

48
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,000
Yeah, you're welcome.

49
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,083
[SHIRLEY]
Now that you mention it,

50
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,625
it does seem pathological.

51
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,291
[HARTMANN]
Indeed. It is.

52
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:43,125
[BARKHORN] So, um, this is
a totally normal thing

53
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,333
to do in Fuso? Interesting.

54
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:47,750
[YOSHIKA] Yeah, I know
it seems kind of odd.

55
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,250
I need more soybeans.

56
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,541
Just be careful not
to throw 'em all, okay?

57
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:54,750
Later we'll eat one bean
for every year of our lives.

58
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm not sure we're gonna
have enough, though.

59
00:03:57,083 --> 00:04:00,541
I need to ask Commander Minna
how old everybody here is.

60
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:03,041
Miyafuji's crazy to
hatch such a risky plan.

61
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,458
Even I don't have the
guts to ask Minna's age.

62
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,458
No, I said I'd ask
for <i>everyone's</i> age,

63
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,125
not just Minna's!

64
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:12,833
[MINNA] Attention. Myafuji,
please report to the cafeteria.

65
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,666
[ALL yelp]

66
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,541
[YOSHIKA]
Huh? A package?

67
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:19,416
Yes. And a letter
came with it, too.

68
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,916
All right then,
I'll be going now.

69
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,125
[gasps] It's a
letter from home!

70
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,166
Ah! What a nice surprise.

71
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,875
Hey! Can we open this?

72
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,666
[YOSHIKA]
Sure.

73
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,041
What's wrong?

74
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:32,833
I'm just so happy.

75
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,166
I guess I've been more
homesick than I knew.

76
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,208
Makes sense. But you
better not forget:

77
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,833
you've got a home
and family here, too,

78
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:42,083
with your sisters in the 501st.

79
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,458
You're right, and that
means the world to me!

80
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:45,958
[BARKHORN]
Little sister!

81
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,458
Doctor, what is this?

82
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:50,916
That's Lima Syndrome.
The Inverse of Stockholm.

83
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,958
It's when the tables are
turned, and the kidnapper

84
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:55,583
begins to fall in love with
their victim, you see.

85
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:58,666
Wow, Doc, that's
very educational.

86
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,083
[HARTMANN]
What'd the letter say?

87
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,458
I'm amazed you're
still able to talk.

88
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,958
Let's see. "Dear Yoshika.

Been reading in the
news that the fighting

00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,958
Ouchy. My heart hurts.

92
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,958
So, there is a heart
under those things?

93
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,500
I sent some mochi
because I'm sure

94

you didn't get any
for New Year's.

Feel free to share them
with your friends.

96
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,875
So, this is that
mochi you've told us

97
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:19,750
so much about?

98
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,208
Looks different than I thought.

99
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,375
Wait, the postmark
says mid-December?!

100
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,541
Mochi is green and fuzzy?

101
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,625
[SHIRLEY]
Ugh! No, that's mold! Nasty!

102
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,291
[BARKHORN]
I mean, after two months at sea,

103
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,333
I'm not surprised, but still.

104
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:32,833
It's a shame, since
they took the time

105
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,250
to make them for you.

106
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,458
Huh. We could just scrape
the mold off and eat them.

107
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:39,708
The mold's only on the outside.
Bet the inside's good.

108
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,083
I'm amazed you can tell.

109
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm a mold connoisseur.

110
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,625
[BARKHORN] Did she just take
pride in her knowledge of mold?

111
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:48,250
[SHIRLEY]
I dunno. I blocked it out.

112
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:49,708
How mysterious!

113
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,916
That means they're ready now!

114
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,291
[HARTMANN] It's like gum. How
do I know when to spit it out?

115
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:55,666
When the flavor's gone?

116
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,833
[YOSHIKA muffled]
You're supposed to swallow it.

117
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,333
May I have some more, please?

118
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:02,583
Of course, help yourself.
I'll keep 'em coming.

What's the matter, Hartmann?

120
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,541
You don't like mochi, or what?

Guess this is my life now.

Trying out new things
can be hard, you know?

124
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,041
I heard that mochi
kills a handful

of people every year--
is that true?

Shut your face!

Yeah. Sorry, every year
a few people get mochi

stuck in their throats,
and some choke to death.

Quick question.

130
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,625
If someone accidentally
ate the moldy mochi,

131
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,500
could it maybe make them sick?

[YOSHIKA shrieks]

133
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,791
[BARKHORN] Well, that explains
why she's been so quiet!

134
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,791

I'm getting really bored now.

135
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,625

and pestle, we could grind up

the yams and make
delicious yam mochi!

137

What is that?

138
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,791
You just mix it together?

Great, then I'll get started.
I've seen it done before.

her rice mochi balls,

00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,250
Yeah. I'm gonna put
something about everyone

158
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,541
in my return letter.
Would that be okay?

159
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:24,291
Sure. But remember that
your superior officers

160
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:25,791
will have to censor it.

161
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:28,625
Right, for safety reasons!
I'm not sure if you know this,

162
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,708
but you have a lot
of fans back home!

163
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,375
Since I have permission,
I'm gonna give them

164
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,708
the real scoop about
every one of you!

165
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,125
[GROUP]
Uh...

166
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,666
[yelps] What's this?
Devil worship?

167
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,875
I think it's a sardine head.

168
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,166
Hey, guys. What are you doing?

169
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,458
[BOTH yelp]

170
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,166
[BOTH]
Well, it's a funny story.

171
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,541
So, Miyafuji's writing about us
in a letter home to her folks?

172
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,541
We outrank her,
so we're censoring it.

173
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,333
Yeah, just doing our duty.

174
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:59,666
Great, let me help!

175
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,291
Eila, no.

176
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:02,166
Well, then?

177
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,666
Nothing here about us.

178
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,750
Must be in the other one.

179
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,250
"Dear Michiko,

180
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,625
Here's the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

181
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,375
Hartmann is a nutcase
and gets yelled at

182
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,708
literally every day.

183
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,875
Shirley is very motherly
and is basically

184
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:17,416
the resident mom of the 501st."

185
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,791
Redact this part here, too.

186
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,541
Let's just erase
all the names.

187
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,375
We have to, it's our job.

188
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:27,416
[YOSHIKA] History is made
under the cover of night.

189
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,750
[YOSHIKA'S MOM gasps]
A letter came from Yoshika!

190
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:33,375
She's very busy, but she
seems to be doing well!

191
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,250
[YOSHIKA] Please give the
second letter to Michiko

192
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,375
after you read it!

193
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:37,958
That's this one.

194
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,041
[YOSHIKA] Several days
later, I got a letter

195
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,208
asking if I was safe.

196
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:45,250
Depends on what
you mean by "safe!"

197
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:48,000
Here you go. Present. For you.

198
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,750
Little old me?

199
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,166
Yeah, it's for your birthday!

200
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,541
Oh! Is that today?

201

--[SHIRLEY] Hug!
--[SANYA yelps]

Hey! What do you
think you're doing?

203
00:08:56,666 --> 00:09:00,291
[SHIRLEY] Ha-ha! Now we'll be
together till death do us part.

204
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,750
[gasps] I don't kiss
on the first date!

205
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,416
[EILA screams]

206
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,541
Get ahold of yourself!

207
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,250
Don't tell me what
to do, Miyafuji!

208
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:10,333
No, not you! I was
talking to Hartmann!

209
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,541
Hartmann, get ahold of yourself!

210
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,666
You guys. Don't freak out.

211
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,291
Couldn't you have told her no?

212
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:19,208
I'm sorry. Here, for you!

213
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,958
This is your birthday
month, too, after all!

214
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:26,416
A very happy birthday, sweet
Eila! Thanks for all you do.

215
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,166
[YOSHIKA, HARTMANN, SHIRLEY]
That was easy.

216
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,666
Is there anything
special you'd like me

217
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,208
to make for you today?

218
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:35,166
How about a yummy birthday cake?

219
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,833
Uh, not really feeling sweets.

220
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,333
Know what I do want?

221
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,000
Some of that nice,
salty Fuso cooking.

222
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,833
We should take a
big group picture!

223
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:48,333
It's so peaceful
around here now,

224
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,000
and we should commemorate it.

225
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:52,750
Oh, that's a great idea!

226
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:53,958
If you don't mind,

227
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,750
we'd like to borrow
your camera for a bit.

228
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:58,416
Okay. But, hold on
just a second.

229
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,541
I put some brand new
film in it for you!

230
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,416
Wow, I appreciate it!

231
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,458
[SHIRLEY] She used all the
shots left on the roll?!

232
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,583
[HARTMANN]
What is on that film?

233
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,791
Ready? Say cheese!

234
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,625
[gasps] We're out
of film already?

235
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:18,000
So how do we even develop it?

236
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,166
I'm pretty sure Lynne
set up her own darkroom.

237
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,708
Maybe she can do it for us.

238
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:24,000
[EILA, SHIRLEY, HARTMANN]
She has her own darkroom?

239
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,583
I developed your film for you!

240
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,375
[SHIRLEY, HARTMANN]
Ooh!

241
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:27,875
Well, let's take a look.

242
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,125
Photography is so much fun, huh?

243
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,875
It is! Want me to
take your picture?

244
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:34,250
Oh, would you?

245
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,375
Guys. We'd better
talk to Miyafuji

246
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:37,458
before she agrees.

247
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:38,750
[YOSHIKA]
Huh?

248
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,666
[YOSHIKA] Lynne protested,
claiming innocence,

249
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,041
saying these photographs were

250
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,208
a "window into the
subjects' souls."

251
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:47,583
Then she changed her story and
said someone else took them.

252
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,583
[EILA, HARTMANN,
YOSHIKA, SHIRLEY sigh]

253
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,458
[MICHIKO]
Hello, everyone!

254
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:26,333
It's time for Michiko Yamakawa's
Strike Witches Classroom!

255
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,666
Today I'll be teaching
you all about Lynne,

256
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:32,250
AKA Lynette Bishop!

257
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,625
Lynne hails from the
Britannia Federation.

258
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,500
Her family is wealthy
and famous for

259
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,416
running a department
store in London!

260
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,833
Both her mom and older
sister are witches, too!

261
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:44,666
So Lynne was basically destined
to become a witch, herself!

262
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,875
Her path has been
anything but typical,

263
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,750
because she joined the 501st
right after she graduated

264
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,166
from training school.

265
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,541
In the beginning of her career,
she didn't do very much,

266
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,041
compared to the others.

267
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,833
But after becoming
friends with Yoshika,

268
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:59,791
the two of them started winning
all kinds of battles!

269
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,625
And now they've
become indispensable

270
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:04,041
members of their unit!

271
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:07,166
Lynne's inherent ability
is shot stabilization,

272
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,875
which makes her an
incredibly talented sniper!

273
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,750
When she takes aim at a Neuroi,

274
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,708
she has a 100 percent
chance of hitting it!

275
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:17,208
She's normally a calm,
peaceful girl,

276
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,916
but she has a fierce heart
and is willing to sacrifice

277
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,208
everything for the people
she cares about.

278
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,166
It's so cool that
Yoshika gets to work

279
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,666
with such an awesome witch!

280
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,333
Yoshika's amazing!

281
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,875
[MICHIKO]
Me again, Michiko Yamakawa!

282
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,250
As you might have guessed,

283
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,625
the military has to complete
missions at all hours.

284
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:42,250
I wonder if Yoshika's been
staying up all night!

285
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:45,541
Next time: "501st,
Ready For Night Work?"

286
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:48,041
You've never seen witches
like these before!
