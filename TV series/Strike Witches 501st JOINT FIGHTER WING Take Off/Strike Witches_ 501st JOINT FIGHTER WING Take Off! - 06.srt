1
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,666
[YOSHIKA]
Combat stress?

2
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,541
When you're at war
for a long time,

3
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:47,625
it can cause mental
and emotional problems.

4
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,083
The symptoms include:

5
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:52,541
denying reality, impulsive
aggression, intense fatigue,

6
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:55,583
and a general sense
of self-loathing.

7
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,416
Which means, we all
have to take good care

8
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,833
of our mental and
emotional states, ya know?

9
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:02,083
Yeah, those two are
obviously very concerned

10
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:03,208
about the subject.

11
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:04,750
Oh, you mean Hartmann
and Barkhorn?

12
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,958
That's something else,
called domestic violence.

13
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,000
That's what Lynne said,

14
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:10,708
and I'd never
heard of it before.

15
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:12,416
Combat stress.

16
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,833
And she's right.

17
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:16,291
We have to take excellent care
of our bodies and minds.

18
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,458
I agree. I guess we
need to make sure

19
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:20,666
everyone spends more
time training, don't we?

20
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,791
Wha...?

21
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,208
We'll run marathons!

22
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,250
That, and 1,000 practice
swings with our swords

23
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:28,000
every morning will work wonders
for our mental states!

24
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:29,625
Minna! Listen to this!

25
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:31,958
Miyafuji has some great
ideas about training!

26
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:33,208
[YOSHIKA]
I'll never understand the way

27
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,500
the major's mind works.

28
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:37,041
How'd she get that
from what I said?

29
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,916
Mental care!
That's a great idea!

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,791
I asked Eila to help
with things like that,

31
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:44,291
but she never did,
so I just let it go.

32
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,291
Mental care? Don't need it.

33
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,666
Speak for yourself, Mio!

34
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,541
Some of the other girls might!

35
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:52,041
[YOSHIKA] Has anything been
stressing you out lately, Lynne?

36
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:53,416
[LYNNE]
No, ma'am!

37
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,916
Hey there, ladies!

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,291
I hope you haven't forgotten
about yours, truly.

39
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:58,791
No, Hartmann!

40
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:01,041
As a future doctor, like
yourself, I spend a lot

41
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,000
of my time thinking of
ways to reduce stress

42
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,541
for my comrades, to make
their lives easier!

43
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,041
I'm highly suspicious.

44
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,208
This sounds like fun,

45
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,416
and I want in on
the ground floor!

46
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,416
[YOSHIKA] Um, can we not
resort to violence?

47
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,791
I'm fine now, but when Chris
was in a coma, I was a mess.

48
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,875
Look, ladies, in love
and war, you can leave

49
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:21,666
all your puberty-related
problems to me!

50
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,250
[gasps] What did I do to
deserve this hateful glare?

51
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,791
[HARTMANN]
Could it be?

52
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,625
Did I, a queen among women,
make some kind of mistake? No.

53
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,750
She must have been driven
mad by my girlish figure

54
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,666
and can no longer cope
with the tension.

55
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,333
Allow me to present
the other major

56
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:36,791
source of all my stress.

57
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,416
Ah...

58
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,083
And, like I said before.

59
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,916
Chris stresses me
out all the time.

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,416
Oh! Siscon!

61
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,583
[yelps]

62
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,083
[BARKHORN]
That's not it at all!

63
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:49,333
But, if I say that,
then Miyafuji might think

64
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,541
that Chris is a hideous loser.

65
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:52,791
That's right.

66
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:53,875
Chris is one of the cutest girls

67
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,541
ever to walk the
face of the earth.

68
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:59,583
She is cute, but I don't know
if I would take it that far.

69
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,458
So, Shirley, is there
anything that's

70
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,583
been stressing you out?

71
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,083
I've been worried
that my flying speed

72
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,833
has hit a plateau.

73
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,625
My sister is a
brilliant engineer,

74
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,333
so leave it to me.
I can help you figure out

75
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,208
what's causing the lag!

76
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,541
These two are to blame!

77
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:15,083
They're screwing with your
aerodynamics for sure!

78
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,333
They're messing with
my back and my dreams?

79
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:20,583
You see, some boobs are
more powerful than others.

80
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,333
If you were to set up
your Striker Unit

81
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,541
like an airplane, with the
propellers spinning to push air

82
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,083
away from the
direction of flight,

83
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,708
would that help speed you up?

84
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:30,166
Great idea! I'll
try it right now!

85
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,875
[SHIRLEY]
Here I go!

86
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,458
[HARTMANN]
I saw that coming.

87
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,041
[EILA]
I've heard the rumors.

88
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,125
I know what you two are doing.

89
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,833
[HARTMANN, YOSHIKA]
Eila?

90
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:43,125
Is something really
stressing Eila out?

91
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,750
Better stay on your
guard, Miyafuji.

92
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:48,625
So, what kind of terrible
darkness lurks in your heart?

93
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:51,458
Is that seriously what
you two think of me?

94
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,375
I, Eila Ilmatar Juut--

95
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:54,375
[YOSHIKA, HARTMANN]
Full name?

96
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:55,750
I object to this.

97
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,791
You should have consulted me
before you even started!

98
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:59,125
[YOSHIKA, HARTMANN]
But, like, why?

99
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:01,041
I've used my future sight
to solve all kinds

100
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,000
of people's problems with
a great deal of success,

101
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,000
so what were you thinking?

102
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,625
Wait, you have?

103
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:06,916
That's fantastic, Eila,

104
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,375
we would love to have your help!

105
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,250
Why yes, of course you would!

106
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,083
[HARTMANN]
I feel so betrayed!

107
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,166
So who are you planning
to talk to next?

108
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,333
[HARTMANN]
She's even wagging her tail!

109
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,125
[YOSHIKA] Well, Perrine
is right over there.

110
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:19,083
Bad idea.

111
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,958
She'll bite your head off.

112
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:23,041
Okay, how 'bout
Lucchini, then?

113
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,750
Nah, she doesn't need our help.

114
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:26,625
We could ask her,
just in case.

115
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:28,458
Were you two really
planning to walk away

116
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,875
without asking my opinion?

117
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,750
Look me in the eye!

118
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:36,375
[HARTMANN] We couldn't find
Lucchini anywhere!

119
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,875
Why don't we ask Commander
Minna to look for her?

120
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,416
She's busy.

121
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,166
I think we opened up a
can of worms over there.

122
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,500
[HARTMANN]
Yeah, let's skip her.

123
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:48,000
Well, then, what about Sanya?

124
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,750
We haven't checked
in with her yet.

125
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:53,375
Has anything been stressing
you out lately, Sanya?

126
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,458
And please, be
completely honest!

127
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,958
[SANYA] Eila carries me in the
morning when I'm sleepy.

128
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:00,666
I was assigned night patrol
tonight, but it's gonna rain,

129
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,500
so Eila offered
to take my place.

130
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:04,708
No, I'm all right!

131
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:07,291
Thanks to Eila, I don't
have any issues!

132
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:08,791
Oh, Sanya!

133
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,208
I'll make your bed,
do your laundry,

134
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:11,708
and even take care of
you when you're sick!

135
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:14,166
If you need anything,
anything at all, let me know!

136
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,541
That's kind of creepy, Eila.

137
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,375
Hey, why are we
even doing this?

138
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,166
I guess I should have
asked you that before.

139
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,083
Lynne told me that
combat stress can become

140
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,541
a problem when
soldiers are at war

141
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:24,791
for long periods of time.

142
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:27,333
Aw, well, it's good
to know you care!

143
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,500
Not sure we're helping, though.

144
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,750
Maybe not, but my
intentions were good.

145
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,708
Stress relief stresses me out!

146
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:37,125
[SHIRLEY, EILA, SAKAMOTO, MINNA]
Life is stressful.

147
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,833
[yelling]

148
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,000
Lucchini!

149
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,625
She always has so much energy.

150
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:43,750
Good timing!

151
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,958
Did Lucchini pass this way?

152
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,833
[SHIRLEY, HARTMANN]
Ah-ha!

153
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:49,958
Wait, what? A cavity?

154
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,083
But why is she running away?

155
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,791
I told her how that's
typically treated,

156
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,625
and she bolted like a
frightened house cat.

157
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,208
[SHIRLEY]
Ah...

158
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,833
Where do you guys
think she went?

159
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,041
We'll never be
able to catch her,

160
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,708
she runs like the dang wind!

161
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,375
Oh, don't worry,
I know an easy way

162
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,083
to make her face the music.

163
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:08,208
Oh, that's right, you're
kinda like Lucchini's mom!

164
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,791
[gasps] I love it!

165
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,666
Of course. Let's go.

166
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,416
What kinda bait do you think
they'll use to trap her?

167
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,916
My money's on dessert or pasta.

168
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,791
[gasps] They're already back!

169
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,375
That was faster than I thought.

170
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,166
[YOSHIKA, SAKAMOTO gasp]

171
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,291
We're gonna use Sanya's
magic to find her!

172
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:28,208
Brilliant, right?

173
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,208
Uh, I guess, if you say so.

174
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,875
She's on night
patrol, so go easy.

175
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,083
What did you use the
stick and rope for?

176
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,208
You don't need
to worry about it.

177
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,833
We kidnapped Sanya from
right outta the tiger's den!

178
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,958
Our blitz tactics are unmatched.

179
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,708
Oh, god, what have
you done to Eila?

180
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:48,958
What? Where's Eila?
Tell me, Hartmann.

181
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,250
I can't now.

182
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,208
We really need to find
Lucchini, so I'm afraid

183
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,958
I don't have time to explain.

184
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,291
Oh, okay. I'll help
you look for her.

185
00:07:56,375 --> 00:08:00,458
[YOSHIKA] She's not worried
at all? Orussians are strange.

186
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,458
She seems to be
in Shirley's room.

187
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:05,500
Why in my room? Let's get her!

188
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,666
Hey, Lucchini, you in there?

189
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,166
[LUCCHINI]
Shirley? Are you alone?

190
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,416
Yeah. Wanna let me in?

191
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,666
--[YOSHIKA] Uh...
--[HARTMANN gasps]

192
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,416
I heard what was going on.

193
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,291
Just leave it to me, okay?

194
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:18,791
Promise?

195
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,666
I promise. Would these
eyes lie to you?

196
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,291
Shirley!

197
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,666
All right, Doctor! Do it!

198
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,166
[sighs] Helping others
is so rewarding.

199
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,208
You think this is how
Miyafuji feels all the time?

200
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:34,541
You know, we're really lucky
she's here to help us out.

201
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,291
Huh? Yeah? Why?

202
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,541
The home remedy for
a cavity is to pull out

203
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,791
the freakin' tooth,
and that's no easy feat.

204
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,291
Ugh. Scary!

205
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,791
Yep, like I said,
we're lucky. Oh, no!

206
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:47,166
Ah! What the heck?

207
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,291
[HARTMANN]
What happened?

208
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,000
[YOSHIKA]
I don't understand!

209
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,375
[HARTMANN] Did your
healing spell strengthen

210
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:52,958
the bacteria in the cavity?

211
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,000
Is that even possible?

212
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,708
I wish that I could just heal
the tooth and call it a day.

213
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:01,625
I guess we're gonna have to
ask around for more help.

214
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,333
[YOSHIKA gasps]

215
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:06,208
You should take her
to the hospital.

216
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:09,208
I think the hospital's
your answer.

217
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,291
I know of a great way
to get rid of a cavity

218
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,791
without having to resort
to drilling the tooth.

219
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:14,958
[YOSHIKA]
Really?

220
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,500
Uh, that seems a bit extreme.

221
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,541
Not only does it heal
fast, but that's what

222
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,500
a hospital would use, too.

223
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:24,000
If you say so.

224
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,125
I do!

225
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:27,250
Hold it right there!

226
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,250
Welcome back. How did it go?

227
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,958
Well, I gathered a bunch
of stuff that's supposed

228
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,791
to help with toothaches.

229
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:35,000
She consulted all
the wrong people.

230
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:38,291
What kind of backwoods
treatments did they recommend?

231
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,125
Try this. Crushed dried plums.

232
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,291
Which are good for
treating pain.

233
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,041
[LUCCHINI]
Ew, gross, it's too sour!

234
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,916
Okay, then let's
try grated garlic.

235
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,666
[LUCCHINI]
Ew, gross, it's too stinky!

236
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,000
Resin-flavored candy?

237
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,416
[LUCCHINI] Ew, gross,
stinky and sour and nasty!

238
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,250
[YOSHIKA]
Glance.

239
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,416
Don't lose your conscience!

240
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,041
Hello, everyone!

241
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:56,791
[YOSHIKA]
Oh. Hi, Lynne.

242
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,333
I did some research
and found a way

243
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,500
to get rid of
cavities instantly!

244
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,041
[YOSHIKA]
What is it?

245
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,375
First, you tie some string
around a door handle.

246
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:07,375
Then, you tie the other end
around the decaying tooth.

247
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,875
Lastly, you slam the door
really hard and, apparently,

248
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,458
the tooth will pop right out.

249
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:12,958
What?

250
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,375
If you go to the hospital,
they'll take it out, as well.

251
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:16,916
But if we do it here,
where there's someone

252
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,625
who can do healing magic,
it'll hurt less

253
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:21,208
and heal faster, so,
I think it's our best bet.

254
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,833
Yeah, that's a
really good point.

255
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,583
Miyafuji!

256
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,708
[YOSHIKA] Here I come,
Lucchini. Open wide!

257
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,208
Go! Run for your life!

258
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,541
[screams]

259
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,416
Are you okay?

260
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,875
Ah! The tooth!

261
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,875
Ow! My face hurts!

262
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,250
[HARTMANN] Hey, look! It was
the tooth with the cavity!

263
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,458
[YOSHIKA]
Hang on.

264
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,416
There's a new tooth
where the old one was!

265
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,166
[HARTMANN]
It wasn't a cavity, then?

266
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,708
[SHIRLEY]
A baby tooth?

267
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,916
Hooray! New tooth!

268
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,166
That was no cavity.

269
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,041
There was just a new
tooth coming in.

270
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,833
My girl. Growing up so fast!

271
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:59,000
Good, now, let's do everything
we can to make sure

272
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,708
nobody here gets any
cavities, okay, Yoshika?

273
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,666
Yeah. You got it. No cavities.

274
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,666
What are these here for?

275
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,583
[SANYA] It's sure is relaxing
in this tiny basket.

276
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,375
[MICHIKO]
Hello, everyone!

277
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:48,000
Time for Michiko Yamakawa's
Strike Witches Classroom!

278
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:52,666
The subject of today's lesson
is Francesca Lucchini!

279
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,333
She's an ace witch from
the Romanga Air Force,

280
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:59,958
and the youngest witch
in the 501st.

281
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,125
Her abilities were identified
when she was just

282
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:05,291
ten years old, and that's
when she joined the military!

283
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,583
She's what you might
call a prodigy!

284
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:08,833
Because she's super cute,

285
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,250
she's sort of become
the group's mascot.

286
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,875
And all the other
witches think of her

287
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,750
as their goofy little sister.

288
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,375
But, when the battle begins,
she shows no fear,

289
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,708
and she'll never back
down from any Neuroi!

290
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,208
She's so courageous!

291
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,458
Her inherent abilities
allow her to manipulate

292
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:27,666
light and heat, and she can use
multiple layers of shields.

293
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,708
Her attacks have a power
you would never believe

294
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,875
could come from someone
so young and tiny,

295
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,791
and that power has led her
to countless victories!

296
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,791
They say she's far more
courteous and caring

297
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,666
than her age would suggest,
and she has a reputation

298
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,708
for being quiet and studious!

299
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:43,250
I can't believe
Yoshika gets to work

300
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,833
with such amazing people!

301
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,875
She's amazing!

302
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,458
[MICHIKO]
Me, again, Michiko Yamakawa!

303
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,958
February is Setsubun
season in Fuso.

304
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,541
I wonder if Yoshika
and her friends

305
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,708
are gonna be throwing beans!

306
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:04,333
Next time: "501st, get
ready for Setsubun?"

307
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,958
You've never seen witches
like these before!
