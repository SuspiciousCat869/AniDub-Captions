and rice and tons of beans?

15
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:17,958
Because you do nothing
but eat and sleep all day long.

What the heck is this,

The key isn't eating less.

It's just exercising more.
Does that make sense?

30

the movement that Shirley's do,
but they're mine!

53

Big juicy melons are all fine
and good, but the best fruits

00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,458
are the ones grown
with tender love and care.

So, be tender.

Did you hear me?! Tender!

57
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,125
Sit-ups are very

I think we need to work on
our stamina a little more.

00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,625
Doesn't it feel good to
get your blood pumping

70
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,166

Miyafuji. I'ma let you
in on a little secret, 'kay?

73
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:26,500
At about 37 miles per hour,
the wind pressure creates

74
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,125
a sensation that's
nearly identical

75
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,833
to the feel of boobies.

76
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:32,166
And! When we're flying around
in our Striker Units,

77
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,791
we get to feel that pressure
all over our bodies!

78
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,166
You see what I'm
getting at here, right?

79
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,708
No, I'm far too
innocent to see

80
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,416
what you're getting at.

81
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,875
But, for some weird reason,
I really like it!

82
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:45,125
I'll go get my Striker Unit now!

83
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:46,541
What'd you tell her?

84
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:49,041
I promised her there'd be boobs.

85
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,250
There are so many
different types though,

86
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,000
the Neuroi are quite advanced.

87
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,708
Yeah, there are bugs
and battleships,

88
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:57,625
and some Neuroi that
can even multiply!

89
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:00,333
They evolve in ways we
humans could never imagine.

I've seen red Neuroi
a few times, too,

91
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,500
not just the black kind.

92
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,708
And some Neuroi
even know how to sing!

93
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:08,041
I could even picture a
person-shaped Neuroi.

think you can, stupid Neuroi!

00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,625
I think I'll pass.

159
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:28,083
But if you need to be healed,
you know where to find me.

160
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:29,500
Don't worry.

161
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,375
Today's sort of like a
pranksters' free-for-all.

162
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:32,791
You can play all the
tricks you want without

163
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,125
fear of being punished.

164
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,500
Sounds great...

165
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,250
First up, is Eila!

166
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,458
This is Halloween!

167
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,541
A festival for
upstanding young ladies!

168
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:44,125
--Ahh...
--Right. Watch and learn.

169
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,625
[knocking

170
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:49,625
What do you want?
I'm trying to take a nap.

171
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:51,458
Give us all of
your candy, witch!

172
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:52,708
If you don't, we'll
play tricks on you

173
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,208
that'll scar you for life!

174
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,208
What the heck has
gotten into you two?!

175
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,541
This is so wrong.

176
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:58,708
What is your problem?!

177
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,208
Can't you see I'm
trying to sleep here?!

178
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,750
You can't sleep!
I'll scream like a banshee!

179
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,708
We won't let you rest
till you appease us!

180
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,458
[screaming]

181
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,708
[SHIRLEY]
We're sorry... It's Halloween...

182
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,916
If you give us candy,
we'll leave you alone...

183
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Ugh. Wait right here.

184
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,708
--[SHIRLEY] Miyafuji...
--[LUCCHINI] Yoshika...

185
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:17,083
All right.
Now hold out your hands.

186
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,666
[SHRLEY, LUCCHINI whimper]

187
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,583
[SHIRLEY] Waugh! The pumpkin's
growing on my head.

188
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,041
I can't breathe!

189
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,833
Oh, no! I'm sorry!

190
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:26,333
Shut up! Here you go.

191
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:29,125
Now will you go away?

192
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,541
-[LUCCHINI, SHIRLEY]
Stingy.

193
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:33,291
Come on, guys! You've
gotta learn some self-control!

194
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,208
What jerks.
Don't they know I'm trying

195
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:38,500
to get some sleep before
my night patrol shift?

196
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:39,875
Halloween, huh?

197
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:43,166
The only day that
tricks go unpunished.

198
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,916
So, uh, trick or treat, I guess.

199
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,291
Oh, you don't have
any candy, you say?

200
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,833
Well, you know what that means.

201
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,708
Watch and learn.

202
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:56,166
Those who pretend to be perfect
are often the most devious.

203
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,541
But, still.

204
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,333
On this day, we can't
turn her over to the police.

205
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,666
That's the ironclad
Law of Halloween!

206
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,958
Oh, sorry, proceed, if you wish.

207
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,000
[EILA]
Here, I got you a special gift.

208
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,791
Oh, wow, how sweet!

209
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,041
This is Halloween...?

210
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,750
Is it just, like,
a holiday for criminals?

211
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,250
No, no, we never
trick-or-treat

212
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,791
where we're not welcome.

213
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:18,333
Oh, you mean we're
gonna skip over Perrine?

214
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,458
Hey, Major Sakamoto
says she wants you

215
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:23,000
to teach her all
about Halloween!

216
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,916
Both tricks and treats
are welcome today!

217
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,958
I'm honored to teach
you the customs, Major!

218
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,916
Huh? Major?

219
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,708
By "her," I meant Miyafuji.

220
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,791
Hey, That was a dirty trick!

221
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:35,375
Those treats were for
the major and you stole them!

222
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:36,416
You're a bunch of monsters!

223
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,250
Them's the brakes,
it's Halloween.

224
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:41,000
The rules say that
we show no mercy, cupcake.

225
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,291
Good evening.

226
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:45,125
No, Lynne! Get out! Run away!

227
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,541
[SHIRLEY]
After you, milady.

228
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:47,750
[LUCCHINI chuckles]

229
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,333
I thought you tricked everybody!

230
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,291
What, it's not like
we have a death wish!

231
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:54,291
Nobody wants to
get killed over a prank!

232
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,583
Our next target
is the queen of rules!

233
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,500
Get ready, everyone. Here goes!

234
00:09:58,583 --> 00:09:59,958
Ready.

235
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,125
[chuckling]

236
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,625
Hand over the sweet
stuff, Sweet Stuff.

237
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,333
Come in. I'll make you some tea.

238
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:10,416
It makes sense to be prepared,
in light of the risks.

239
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,916
[SHIRLEY] I'm disappointed
in your willingness

240
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,291
to surrender, Barkhorn.

241
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,083
[LUCCHINI]
Way to ruin all the fun!

242
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:19,125
[BARKHORN]
Fun, eh? All right, then.

243
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,125
Trick or Treat, girls.

244
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:24,041
Now gimme some treats, Shirley.
You, too, Lucchini.

245
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,041
[gasping]

246
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,708
Hold on a second, you're 18!

247
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,500
You're totally too old
to be trick-or-treating.

248
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:29,916
Halloween is for kids!

249
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You should be
ashamed of yourself!

250
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,041
Welp, you heard 'em, Commander.

251
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,125
[screaming]

252
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,625
[ding]

253
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:39,791
You know, I don't think I saw
Hartmann at all yesterday.

254
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,416
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

255
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,291
She refused to give me candy.
So I had no choice.

256
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:47,916
[gasps]
No! Hartmann, why?

257
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,333
She's not talking!
Barkhorn, go get help!

258
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,458
What's this?
Wait, where'd she go?

259
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:56,083
[SAKAMOTO] Gotta get
them before they get you.

260
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:28,958
[MICHIKO]
Hi, there, everybody!

261
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:32,541
It's time for Michiko Yamakawa's
Strike Witches classroom!

262
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:38,083
Today's lesson is all about
Eila Ilmatar Juutilainen!

263
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,375
She's from Suomus,

264
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,375
which is all the way
in Northern Europe.

265
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:44,333
She's one of their greatest
aces, but not just there!

266
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,416
Eila's one of the very best
in the whole wide world!

267
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,833
And she was the recipient
of their highest honor,

268
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,958
the Mannerheim Cross!

269
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,375
You can't talk
about Eila without

270
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:57,208
mentioning her inherent ability:
the gift of "Foresight!"

271
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,208
This ability allows
her to see slightly into

272
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:02,041
the future, which means she
sees Neuroi attacks before

273
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,250
they even happen and
can dodge them better

274
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,125
than most witches can!

275
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:07,416
Because of that,

276
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,958
Eila's almost never
taken any hits in battle!

277
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:12,833
She makes it through the most
dangerous missions alive,

278
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:16,166
and has even been called,
"The Miracle Witch!"

279
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,875
Since she doesn't
need to use a shield,

280
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,208
she's able to conserve
her magical power,

281
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,625
and fight for very
long periods of time.

282
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:27,208
She's awesome! A true
ultra-super witch, for sure!

283
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:29,750
Her hobby is doing
tarot card readings!

284
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,916
Because of her ability
to see into the future,

285
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,541
she's a natural at it.

286
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:37,250
And her readings are
always incredibly accurate!

287
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,083
Yoshika's so amazing.

288
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:42,125
She gets to work with one of
the world's superstar witches!

289
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,958
To be perfectly honest,
I'm a little bit jealous!

290
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:54,375
[MICHIKO]
It's me again, Michiko Yamakawa!

291
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,541
Even on the battlefield,

292
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,750
the witches are all
still teenage girls!

293
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,333
Which means they like
to express themselves

294
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:00,750
through their appearance!

295
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:01,958
Next time:

296
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,000
"Five-hundred and first.
Time for a Haircut?"

297
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,375
You've never seen witches
like these before!
