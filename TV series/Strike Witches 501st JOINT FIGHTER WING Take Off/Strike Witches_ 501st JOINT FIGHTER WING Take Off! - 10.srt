1
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:44,500
Here we are, another payday.

2
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:45,750
Yeah, and I can't help feeling

3
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:48,875
anxious every time. What
are we supposed to do?

4
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:51,166
[MINNA] I bet they're feeling
guilty about accepting their pay

5
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,625
because the Neuroi
never showed up.

6
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:56,416
I've told you a thousand
times. It's totally okay!

7
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,541
Commander!

8
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:58,875
You're putting yourself
at risk here,

9
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:01,416
so I guarantee it's
the right thing to do!

10
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,666
That's the truth. Thanks
for saying it, Minna.

11
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,000
[MINNA]
I'm the perfect boss.

12
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:08,750
I know exactly what my
subordinates are thinking.

13
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,750
[BARKHORN]
Okay, are you ready, Miyafuji?

14
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:13,166
[YOSHIKA]
Yeah! I was born ready!

15
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,333
[yelps] What's this about?
Explain yourselves!

16
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:21,958
Stop it! I'm begging you!

17
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,500
Miyafuji! Don't
touch me like that!

18
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:27,208
Please, you'll
tarnish my innocence!

19
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,333
[YOSHIKA] We did what you
said, Commander Minna!

20
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:30,958
[MINNA] That's good--
wait, what the hell?

21
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:33,375
We took your advice.
Shut your trap, Shirley!

22
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:34,833
[MINNA gasps]

23
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:37,583
[HARTMANN] Hartmann never
abandons a comrade in need!

24
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:41,541
And today, my main comrade
happens to be Miyafuji.

25
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:42,875
Oh, I get it.

26
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:44,500
The age-old fight
over who gets to go

27
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,791
on the shopping trip
with whom, huh?

28
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,375
But, still, don't you think
you took it a little too far?

29
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:52,000
Well, her driving puts us
all in peril, you know?

30
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:54,791
And her antics get more
dangerous every time.

31
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,666
Commander! Please help me!

32
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,041
Let this be a lesson for
the future. Understood?

33
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:01,875
Ma'am, yes ma'am!

34
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:04,666
I wasn't calling you old--
I was trying to show respect.

35
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,625
You two, cut the nonsense
and decide amongst

36
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:08,708
yourselves who gets
to go shopping, now!

37
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,958
[YOSHIKA]
Yes, sir?

38
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,250
Yeah, sounds good.

39
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,375
I'm more than happy to be

40
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,708
the shopping trip
chauffeur today.

41
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:18,625
[YOSHIKA] Hartmann's driving is
every bit as dangerous, though!

42
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,041
[LUCCHINI]
What're you getting?

43
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,916
[YOSHIKA] Why isn't anyone
objecting? Wait, maybe...

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,916
[LUCCHINI]
Darkroom?

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,416
You guys are terrible!

46
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,916
What's wrong, Miyafuji?

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,750
It's easy for you to say
Hartmann should drive

48
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,375
when you're not the ones
who have to risk your lives

49
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:31,958
riding with her!

50
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:34,208
What'd you say, punk?

51
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,375
[YOSHIKA] I had no idea
Hartmann was even capable

52
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:37,916
of driving like a normal person.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,250
I'm just scared she's
gonna fall asleep.

54
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:44,291
Looks like Eila's list didn't
make it on the truck.

55
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,208
I should go after them,
but, to be honest,

56
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,666
I have no experience behind
the wheel of a truck.

57
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,000
You need practice;
now's the perfect time.

58
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,333
[BARKHORN]
Hm...

59
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:54,375
If you learn to drive,
then you'll be able to see

60
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:55,833
Chris whenever you want.

61
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:58,416
You're gonna teach me how
to drive right now, Liberia.

62
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,000
Not before you say what
you know you should.

63
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:04,375
You're right, I'm very sorry
for how I've treated you today.

64
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,208
Uh-- Wow.

65
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,208
Great, now agree to only
call me, "Teacher,"

66
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,916
and swear to do whatever I say.

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,416
Of course, Teacher. I await
further instructions.

68
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,541
Wait. Why is she so creepy.
I'm having major regrets.

69
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:19,416
I told her driving would
allow her to see her sister.

70
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,666
Oh.

71
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,083
Here, Perrine, for you.

72
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,791
I got you a nice, little
present. 'Cause you like tea!

73
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,166
Really? For me?

74
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,708
Yeah, of course, why not?

75
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:31,458
I don't see anything
on the list for Eila.

76
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,541
Didn't she submit her requests?

77
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:36,125
[LUCCHINI] This is probably
what she would ask for, right?

78
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,333
[PERRINE] She's getting
greedier with every paycheck.

79
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:39,375
Awful.

80
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,416
[SHIRLEY] Hey, you could stand
to drive a lot faster, you know.

81
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,791
Be quiet. That would
be too dangerous.

82
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:48,541
I purposely got us a jeep
that can take a lot of damage.

83
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:49,791
But, still, every movement

84
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,750
needs to be carefully
thought-out.

85
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,125
[SHIRLEY] And to think,
I was gonna suggest

86
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,791
we go visit your
sister on this trip.

87
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,333
But there won't be time now.

88
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:57,958
[YOSHIKA, SHIRLEY scream]

89
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,458
Nice. You can drive
fast after all.

90
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,208
Don't think. Just go
with your gut!

91
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,333
That's the ticket!

92
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,833
Roger, Teacher! You're the best!

93
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,458
Hey! There's a curve up ahead!

94
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,083
Yank the wheel! Now!

95
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:12,458
Huh! Yes, Teacher. What
am I supposed to do next?

96
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,958
Miyafuji, get your
healing magic ready!

97
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:16,166
Dear family.

98
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,208
By the time you read
this, I will be dead.

99
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,208
[BARKHORN]
Feel don't think, right?

100
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,083
Oh, cool. It's easy.

101
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:27,083
Miyafuji, can I borrow
that pen and some paper?

102
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,833
Man, we made quite a haul!

103
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,250
Why yes, we sure did.

104
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,083
And I got some hakarl for Eila.

105
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,416
That's so nice of you.

106
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,458
[PERRINE] Great! I guess
it's about time for lunch!

107
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:40,083
How are we supposed to get home
without a steering wheel?

108
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,708
I dunno, but it's not my fault.

109
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,708
And it's fine. We've
got a spare tire.

110
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,333
So, ya see? Problem solved.

111
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:48,833
How does that fix
the steering wheel?

112
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,791
[BARKHORN] It doesn't!
But we can put the tire here,

113
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,916
and we won't have to worry
about dangerous curves!

114
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,375
All right, then! It's
time to go see Chris!

115
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,916
[SHIRLEY] Miyafuji, does your
healing magic work on crazy?

116
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,833
[YOSHIKA] I'll try, but this
might be above my paygrade!

117
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,166
I'm sorry.

118
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,666
[SHIRLEY]
Well, we'd better talk about how

119
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,666
we're gonna get
back to the base.

120
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,750
[BARKHORN] Walking's probably
out of the question.

121
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,041
Our best bet is hitchhiking.

122
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,750
[SHIRLEY] Barkhorn,
you can redeem yourself.

123
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:13,833
Hey! Stop!

124
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,666
[SHIRLEY]
No, you need to stop!

125
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,875
The key is to look
seductive, not murderous!

126
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:21,875
Jeez! You have got to follow
the rules, Barkhorn!

127
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,958
Oh. Hi!

128
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,208
Give me my gun.

129
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:30,125
Not yet! Get into it!
Ya know, feminine wiles!

130
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:34,000
Hi! Stop, please! Yoo-hoo!

131
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,541
[BARKHORN]
Uh...

132
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,833
[laughing]

133
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,208
We made it!

134
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,208
You did. Glad you're back safe.

135
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:46,250
This is quite a haul.
I'll help you guys unload it.

136
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:49,083
Major! You're too
kind! Thank you!

137
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,625
Almost forgot.

138
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:53,208
There is something I think you
should keep an eye out for.

139
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:54,958
What's up?

140
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,708
There was a pervert
at the pass.

141
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,083
I was so scared!

142
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,833
Yeah, it was terrifying!

143
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:02,250
I'll raise the alert level.

144
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,500
We're back now!

145
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,000
Welcome home!

146
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,125
What's for dinner?

147
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,375
Be patient--it's almost ready.

148
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:09,500
[GROUP]
Huh?

149
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,125
Where's everyone else?

150
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:13,666
They all mysteriously
disappeared.

151
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,666
[GROUP pants]

152
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,291
Good morning, guys!

153
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:26,291
Wow, I'm experiencing
major déjà vu.

154
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,125
No, Miyafuji.

155
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,333
What you're witnessing now

156
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,791
is actually what we
refer to as, "Karma."

157
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,916
[YOSHIKA]
It's really hot today.

158
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,291
Hey, Hartmann, send
some wind over here.

159
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,166
You're not gonna stop this?

160
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,333
It's quite all right, Miyafuji.

161
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:43,041
Usually, my power
only destroys things.

162
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,916
As someone who wanted
to become a doctor,

163
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,375
I've always been
secretly jealous

164
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:49,416
of your inherent magical
ability to heal other people!

165
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,500
This is bliss!

166
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:51,875
But, Hartmann,
you really shouldn't

167
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:54,041
be pushing yourself
as hard as this!

168
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:57,083
Thanks for caring.
I'll keep that in mind!

169
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,291
[SHIRLEY]
It's so hot!

170
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:02,208
[LUCCHINI]
I'm burning up!

171
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,541
Now I'm the jealous one!

172
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,125
Miyafuji.

173
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,500
This heat!

174
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,125
Can't take it!

175
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,625
Please put on some
clothes. Indecent!

176
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:19,000
How else are we supposed
to stay cool in this hell?

177
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,625
Are you ready, Hartmann?
Break time's over!

178
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,833
Stay away, you Jezebel!

179
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:26,958
Come on, take one for the team!

180
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,208
Miyafuji can heal you
if you short-circuit!

181
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,083
I bet I could bring back
the dead right now!

182
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,083
She sold her soul to the devil!

183
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,208
[HARTMANN]
So exhausted.

184
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:38,833
[sighs] Well, if you insist
on dressing like that,

185
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:41,291
you might as well swim
a few hundred laps!

186
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,375
[SHIRLEY]
Well done! Nice work!

187
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,125
I can't believe this heat.

188
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:48,875
Oh, hi, good morning.
Here, Commander.

189
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,625
Thanks so much.

190
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:53,416
[YOSHIKA] And this is
for you, Major Sakamoto.

191
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,041
Well, that's an innocent face
if I've ever seen one.

192
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:59,125
Now, then, just use the power
of your mind to cool it off.

193
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,916
[SAKAMOTO]
Miyafuji, I think you and I

194
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,958
need to have a little talk.

195
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,166
Hey, Major.

196
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,083
Do you know any good
tricks for staying cool?

197
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,000
Ooh, yeah, my favorite
way to cool down

198
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:10,000
is telling 100 scary stories!

199
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,750
Does that really work, though?

200
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,625
Right, I forgot.

201
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:16,750
Minna, you're not a big fan
of that kind of stuff, are you?

202
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:17,958
[MINNA]
Uh...

203
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,333
I haven't forgotten
the time a while back

204
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:20,750
when we did that
test of courage,

205
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,250
and you clung to me like a vine.

206
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:25,208
Hey, you weren't
supposed to tell anyone!

207
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,458
[YOSHIKA] She just wanted
an excuse to grab her.

208
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,041
[MINNA] And, Hartmann,
starting this evening,

209
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,250
you're gonna be on night
patrol with Sanya, remember?

210
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,750
So, maybe you'd
better spend the day

211
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,000
in her room resting up
for your first shift.

212
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:37,000
Whoops, I totally forgot.

213
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,500
Oh? You'll be on night patrol?

214
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,333
Do you know how Sanya
seals off her room

215
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,541
to keep prying eyes
out during the day?

216
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,625
Well, they asked me
to use my Sturm ability

217
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:48,250
to help prevent her from
getting heat stroke in there.

218
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,250
Okay, but what about Eila?

219
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,583
Eila loves to hug Sanya
tight, so she's great

220
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:55,500
in the winter, but not
in summer, Sanya says.

221
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:56,583
[YOSHIKA]
Huh.

222
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,791
[HARTMANN]
Don't say I said that.

223
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:01,250
[YOSHIKA] That night, I was
asked to help tell the hundred,

224
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,166
cooling ghost stories.

225
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,416
Great, we're all set!
Lighting candles now!

226
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,166
All right! They're lit!

227
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,416
Finished!

228
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,250
[YOSHIKA]
Good job, you guys!

229
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,125
Why didn't we realize
that lighting a bunch

230
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:17,458
of tiny fires would heat up
the room exponentially?

231
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,333
Ten stories and ten candles.

232
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:22,250
Guys, the room did just get
a little colder, I swear.

233
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,000
[SHIRLEY] Okay, that's it,
I totally believe

234
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,583
in these ghost stories now.

235
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,708
Really? Did you see a ghost?

236
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,208
No way, ghosts aren't real.

237
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,250
I just realized that, by the
end of it, when you remove

238
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,250
all hundred tiny heat
sources, you can't help

239
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:36,000
but feel a lot cooler
by comparison.

240
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:39,500
[YOSHIKA] Neither of us could
argue with that sound logic.

241
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:42,125
[EILASANYA] Do you see
the ghost in the doorway?

242
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,375
[MICHIKO]
Hello, everyone!

243
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:18,250
It's time for Michiko Yamakawa's
Strike Witches Classroom!

244
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:22,208
Today's lesson is all about
a very special witch.

245
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:25,625
Gertrude Barkhorn!

246
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,250
She's one of the
most experienced

247
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:30,041
and accomplished witches
from Karlsland!

248
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,958
Well, to be honest,
she's one of the best

249
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:34,583
in the entire world!

250
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:37,250
Her tactics showcase her
fierce fighting skills

251
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:40,000
and experience in battle,
and her style is intricate

252
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,000
and bold at the same time!

253
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,833
She's been one of
the main contributors

254
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:47,291
to the dozens of amazing
feats the 501st are known for

255
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,250
around the world!

256
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:52,541
She and Erica Hartmann,
another member of the 501st,

257
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:56,500
are old friends and a very
famous pair of witches, to boot!

258
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,458
They're quite a formidable pair.

259
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,500
Not even the strongest
Neuroi in the world

260
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,875
could stand a chance
against them!

261
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,208
Barkhorn's inherent magic
allows her to enhance

262
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:08,750
her physical abilities, her
muscular strength in particular.

263
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:11,333
This lets her wield
really big, heavy weapons

264
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:14,541
that someone her size might
not be able to use otherwise!

265
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:17,625
Sometimes she even uses
machine guns as hammers.

266
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:21,250
It's wonderful to see her
smash those Neuroi to pieces!

267
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:24,083
She's the ideal commander who
takes her responsibilities

268
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:26,125
as a leader very seriously.

269
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,333
She always fights to
protect the other witches

270
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,000
and never gives up!

271
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,916
I can't believe my best
friend gets to work

272
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,583
with such an awesome witch!
Yoshika's amazing!

273
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,500
[MICHIKO]
Me, again, Michiko Yamakawa!

274
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,416
Soldiers always need to be
prepared for emergencies.

275
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,083
I'm sure the girls of the 501st
are training really hard!

276
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:55,583
Next time: "501st,
Time to Save Lives?"

277
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:58,291
You've never seen witches
like these before!
