00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:43,708
[HARTMANN] Hello, everyone!
It's me, Hartmann!

2
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:46,833
During the day, I'm sure I look
like the laziest person ever.

3
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:50,000
But I'm just tired from studying
in secret to be a doctor!

4
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:51,291
Lately, I've been practicing on

5
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:53,333
this mannequin that
I bought with my paycheck.

6
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:55,958
He's helping me learn
how to give exams!

7
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:58,125
That's why I haven't been
getting enough sleep or cleaning

8
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:02,000
as much as I probably should,
but it's also just who I am!

9
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:04,625
Hey, it's noon! Get up, now!

10
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:05,875
[HARTMANN groans]

11
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:06,875
[yells]

12
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:07,958
[BARKHORN groans]

13
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:10,458
Jeez! Can't you knock?
Get outta here!

14
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:11,791
Uh. Sure.

15
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:16,333
[BARKHORN] Should I call
the Military Police?

16
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:19,291
No, maybe I'm wrong.
Who knows what I saw?

17
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:21,458
Maybe it wasn't
at all what I thought.

18
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,000
You know...

19
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:26,291
I haven't seen Eila all day,
and she's not on night patrol.

20
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:29,541
Really? Then I suppose
Sanya will have to do it alone.

21
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:31,250
[BARKHORN] Could Hartmann
have murdered Eila?

22
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:32,708
I have to call the cops!

23
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:35,666
No, Eila wouldn't want a family
member to get arrested.

24
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,083
Um, Barkhorn?

25
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,750
[BARKHORN] Well. I guess I'll
just have to break the rules.

26
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:43,916
Hartmann.

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,250
Show me where you hid the body,
and I'll just take care of it.

28
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,416
Aww, so you did see it, then?

29
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,000
I tried to be discreet.

30
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,833
Oh, dummy lost an arm.

31
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:54,208
[BARKHORN] Hide that!
What if somebody sees it?!

32
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,625
What? You saw. So?

33
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,583
I'm the only one
who knows right now.

34
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,708
If we hurry and get rid
of it, this stops here.

35
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:04,125
Huh? I need it! How else
am I supposed to study?

36
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,625
You murdered Eila
just so you could study?!

37
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:08,125
[HARTMANN]
Huh?

38
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,750
[BARKHORN] Sorry, I didn't
realize it was only a mannequin.

39
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,833
It's fine. I'm used to it.

40
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,500
Miyafuji might
not always be here,

41
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,000
so I want to learn to heal.

42
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,500
Good point.
It's important to have a way

43
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,708
to treat people
without using magic.

44
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,875
Should I start
studying medicine, as well?

45
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:24,875
Maybe I should teach
a class on emergency healing!

46
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,416
Can I take part in it?

47
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,833
Yeah, of course!

48
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:31,166
Should I bring that mannequin
to be my visual aide?

49
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,333
Okay, good. Hold 'em steady.

50
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:34,875
Right!

51
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,416
Oh, the bag seems
to be a little too small.

52
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,833
It should fit
if we just stuff it in.

53
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:41,666
[BOTH]
Heave ho!

54
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,458
What's the matter, Trudy?

55
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:44,875
It's probably a shocking scene

56
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:48,791
for a strict rule-follower
like her to stumble upon.

57
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,375
Eila. There you are.

58
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,125
We wondered where you went.

59
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,666
Well, I'm here!
Let's save lives!

60
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,541
If just for Sanya's sake!

61
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,166
How did you find out?

62
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,875
By looking into
the future, naturally--

63
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,416
Duh, how else?

64
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,458
If you knew this was coming,
then why didn't you tell me?!

65
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:06,083
[EILA chuckles]
You'll never land one on me.

66
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,291
Don't mess with medicine!

67
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:12,041
I am Coach Hartmann.
Miyafuji's my helper.

68
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,041
All right, time to get
this class started.

69
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,333
[EILA, PERRINE, BARKHORN]
Miyafuji's the helper?

70
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:17,916
The first step is to
bring the injured soldier

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,166
to the rear lines.

72
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,250
In Fuso, this is called
"changing course."

73
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,791
Fuso won't even
call it a retreat

74
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,375
when that's literally
what it is.

75
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,750
It's not a retreat! Is it?

76
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,333
Okay, kids. Now let's practice

77
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,708
getting the soldier on a
stretcher and calling a doctor!

78
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:31,791
Negative!

79
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,791
You don't understand.

80
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:36,125
What we really need more than
anything right now is to learn

81
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,375
how to come to the major's
aid when she's in trouble.

82
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,750
Yeah, we want
to be able to come to

83
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:42,166
the heroine's rescue
when she's in danger!

84
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,791
Sic 'em, Trudy!

85
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,125
All right. First,
you check to see

86
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:46,250
if they're conscious.

87
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,958
Then, you make sure
they're breathing.

88
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,583
If they're not, you have
to clear their airway

89
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:53,583
and perform CPR.
Eila, why don't you go first?

90
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,000
Now, go ahead and
blow gently into the mouth.

91
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,916
[EILA] She wants me to waste
my first kiss on a dummy?

92
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
No way!

93
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,250
You better do it.

94
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,750
If you're not gonna
take this seriously,

95
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,500
then let me.

96
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:07,000
[PERRINE] I have to waste
my first kiss on this thing?

97
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,000
No way!

98
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,083
Why did you even come here?

99
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,958
People's lives are at stake,
stop screwing around!

100
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,375
It's hard to take
this seriously with

101
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,541
that thing's goofy
face staring at you.

102
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,958
Yes, you make
an excellent point, Eila.

103
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,666
[BARKHORN]
You rang, boss?

104
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,208
We'd retain the
knowledge a whole lot better

105
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:25,083
if the mannequin had a more
likeable face, you know?

106
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,208
That does make sense.

107
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,958
No, it doesn't!

108
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,458
[BARKHORN]
Okay, let's mold some faces!

109
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,250
[PERRINE]
Yes! In the name of medicine!

110
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:34,000
[EILA] Right! Get ready
to save some lives, ladies!

111
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,958
They seem to be
taking this seriously now,

112
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,208
but it's all an illusion.

113
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,375
I brought some modeling clay

114
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,500
and candles we can
use to make the faces.

115
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,916
Do you think this
will be enough?

116
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,250
Chris looks
a bit more like this.

117
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,250
I'm off by a whole millimeter!

118
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,458
Miyafuji, the candle, stat!

119
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,583
Okay, fine.

120
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,666
Hey Miyafuji, I'm sorry.

121
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,958
[YOSHIKA]
You need candles, too?

122
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,708
Huh-- Ahh!!

123
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,041
I'm sorry, Chris.

124
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,458
Forgive your sister for
being such a clumsy jerk. 

125
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:03,708
I mean, maybe she'd
be flattered by your sacrifice?

126
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,166
Shouldn't we be teaching them

127
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,708
not to discriminate when
trying to save people's lives?

128
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:08,916
If it'll make them care,

129
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,541
I'm willing to let it slide.

130
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:13,041
What other things are we
going to teach them?

131
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:15,583
I'm planning a lesson
on cardiac massage.

132
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,500
Oh, yes, very important.

133
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,125
Should we get Shirley
and Lynne to come help

134
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:21,458
by acting as patients, then?

135
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:22,708
Nope, that's it.

136
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:24,291
Go stand over there
with the other pervs.

137
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,666
Wait, why?!

138
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,583
I'm just trying to keep
everybody safe and healthy!

139
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,125
It's a masterpiece!

140
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,208
Wow, that's great!

141
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,875
Oh, no. Looks like
you're having a hard time.

142
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:37,416
[EILA whimpers, screams]

143
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,208
Eila! Where are
you taking that clay?

144
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,666
[YOSHIKA]
What happened to you?

145
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:49,250
[EILA chuckles]
Oh, I had a fantastic idea.

146
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,916
I poured hot wax into this
mold and let it harden.

147
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,375
Behold! A Sanya mask!

148
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,041
Good god, what have you done?

149
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,791
I just smashed
the clay onto Sanya's face

150
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,125
to create the mold.

151
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,125
A living death mask?

152
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,875
It may be frowned upon,
but I'd do anything for Sanya!

153
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,958
Maybe I love her more
than you love yours.

154
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,333
[PERRINE whimpers]

155
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:09,708
Wanna bet I'm the one
who gets punished for this?

156
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:12,166
Well, you're supposed
to be in charge.

157
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,958
Whatever, let's just
get back to it.

158
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,583
All right, guess I'll start.

159
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:18,416
[YOSHIKA] So, you decided to
use the original face after all?

160
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,916
Yes, of course I did.

161
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,500
It's wrong to discriminate based
on the way someone looks!

162
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,166
Are you kidding me?

163
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,250
Miyafuji, wouldja get
the torso for me?

164
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,250
Sure, here you go!

165
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,625
How could you?!

166
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:33,375
Who's next?
All right Eila, are you ready?

167
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:36,916
Hundred percent! See?

168
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,041
[HARTMANN] Why is it wearing
Sanya's actual clothes?

169
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,208
I put them on it!

170
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,875
That is impressive!

171
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:44,958
I don't like the fact that its
proportions are inaccurate.

172
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,583
Looking back, I should
have taken more clay

173
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,250
and gotten a mold
of her whole body.

174
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,541
Sanya! Please, wake up now!

175
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,416
What is happening?

176
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,250
[SANYA (EILA)]
Eila, you came to save me.

177
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:59,166
I promise I will!
I'll save you with CPR!

178
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,250
Mmm...

179
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,833
What the heck? Eila...

180
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:07,041
I'm teaching a class
on emergency medicine,

181
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,583
but I should have
set way stricter rules

182
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:12,041
for the practice dummies.
I'm really sorry, Sanya.

183
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,333
I can write an apology
letter if you'd like.

184
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,708
Ahh, what happened
to your clothes, Sanya?

185
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,333
You know there are male soldiers
on this base, too, right?

186
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,875
So. Why'd you
decide to take this course?

187
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,208
I thought it'd come
in handy someday

188
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,333
when we search for your parents.

189
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,375
[sighs]
I can't stay mad at you.

190
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:28,916
Oh, sweet, Sanya!

191
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,333
Ugh, are you done
with your little act yet?

192
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,750
It's my turn to
practice now, thanks.

193
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,291
I shall also be rehearsing

194
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,333
a little improvised scene that
might someday come to pass.

195
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,416
Remember, no small parts,
only small actors,

196
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,208
so please take this seriously.

197
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:45,333
I need you to dig deep, commit,
and play your intentions, okay?

198
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,166
Well, since you
seem so gung-ho about

199
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,750
your "scene," I guess I'll help.

200
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:51,750
Good, remember to stay
in character, no matter what!

201
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:52,916
Okay, in the first beat, 

202
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,708
we witness the major
getting attacked.

203
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,375
What are you guys
doing over here?

204
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,833
Oh, Lynne, what perfect timing.

205
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,000
Now, shoot this.

206
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,291
[screams]

207
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,875
Ugh, here we go.

208
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,583
[PERRINE sobs]
Major?

209
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,916
[SAKAMOTO]
Hmm? Someone call me?

210
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,708
[PERRINE]
The major! This is terrible!

211
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,416
It must have been
a Neuroi attack!

212
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,750
Wait, what happened?

213
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,375
I'll begin CPR!

214
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,833
Hate to tell ya,
but it's too late.

215
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:20,333
Yeah, there's a big hole
where her heart was.

216
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:24,208
--[PERRINE sobs] Miyafuji, help!
--No. Please, no...

217
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:25,583
Is that me...?

218
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,583
Eila, how did
this future happen?

219
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,208
Hey... You guys...

220
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,250
Tragic. If only I'd been
able to foresee this.

221
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:34,333
[PERRINE sobs]

222
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:37,083
[SAKAMOTO]
I see. It all makes sense.

223
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,083
I've died and become a ghost.

224
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,125
Farewell. Nice knowing you.

225
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,541
[MINNA gulps]
What's gotten into you, Mio?

226
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:49,041
So, what do we do
with these things now?

227
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,041
Set 'em on fire?

228
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,708
No, we can't burn them!

229
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,875
I'll just take them
back to my room.

230
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,041
[screams]

231
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,000
Should we destroy
the major's dummy, too?

232
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,583
[PERRINE]
No, please don't!

233
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,041
Um, listen...

234
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,625
The Major won't have a good
impression of you anymore.

235
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,833
And people would freak out
seeing them in the trash,

236
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,458
so we should just bury them.

237
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,125
Yes, you make a good point.

238
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:11,708
Mio, don't be ridiculous.

239
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,958
You are not a ghost,
you're still alive.

240
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:17,875
No. I saw the others
mourning over my dead body.

241
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,375
There you guys are.

242
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,750
What are you doing out here
in the woods with a shovel?

243
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,166
[MINNA screams]
Mio!

244
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,750
[EILA, BARKHORN]
We're busted.

245
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,875
Uh, Minna! What happened was--

246
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:31,625
[BOTH] Hartmann
put us up to the whole thing.

247
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,541
--[MINNA sobs]
--But...

248
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:37,625
[YOSHIKA] I may be ugly,
but I deserve to live!

249
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,166
[MICHIKO]
Hello, everyone!

250
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,791
It's time for Michiko Yamakawa's
Strike Witches Classroom!

251
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,708
Today's lesson is all
about a very special witch:

252
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,041
Perrine Clostermann.

253
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,750
[MICHIKO] She's an awesome
ace witch who hails from

254
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,416
the Republic of Gallia!

255
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,708
And get this: she's a member
of the Clostermann family,

256
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:29,083
the Lords of the
Chartreux Province!

257
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:32,791
In other words, Perrine
is a real-life aristocrat!

258
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,333
Not only does
she comport herself like

259
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:37,833
an elegant, distinguished, noble
lady, but she has powerful

260
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,583
combat abilities that set
her apart from the rest.

261
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,750
She was recognized for
them even in her time living

262
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,000
in the Free Gallia Republic!

263
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,166
She was famous,
and her nickname was

264
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:50,375
"Blue Premier," or
"Blue Number One!"

265
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:53,541
So, when the 501st was
initially being formed,

266
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:56,583
Major Sakamoto went to her
directly and personally invited

267
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:59,083
her to join the team!

268
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:01,833
Her inherent magic
is called, "Tonnerre,"

269
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:05,250
or "Thunder." It allows her
to emit all her magic energy

270
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:08,250
at once, creating
a powerful electric blast!

271
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,208
It's incredible to see!

272
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,166
But it takes time to
recharge before she can

273
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,916
use it again, so she
has to be very selective

274
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,708
and only bring it out
when it's necessary!

275
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,208
Like a true noblewoman,

276
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:23,000
she has a strong sense of
noblesse oblige at all times.

277
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,791
I can't believe my best
friend gets to work with

278
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:28,083
such an awesome witch!
Yoshika's amazing!

279
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,625
[MICHIKO] It's me, again,
Michiko Yamakawa.

280
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,750
The Allies have decided
to launch a full-scale attack

281
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,166
on a Neuroi nest!

282
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,375
What fate is in store
for Yoshika and the 501st?

283
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:47,541
Next time: "501st.
You're Splitting Up?"

284
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:50,208
You've never seen
witches like these before!
