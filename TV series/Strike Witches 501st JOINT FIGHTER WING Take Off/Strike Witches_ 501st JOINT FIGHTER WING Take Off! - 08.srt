00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:43,833
[YOSHIKA] Today, Barkhorn is
teaching us a combat lesson.

2
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:44,958
Here's something
to keep in mind

3
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:46,791
when fighting Neuroi.

4
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:48,833
They use Beam Weapons,
so even a split second

5
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:50,958
of lapsed concentration
could be fatal.

6
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:53,000
That's why you have to keep
your eyes open at all times

7
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:54,083
and not look away.

8
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:55,083
All the time?

9
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:56,750
But, that sounds impossible.

10
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:58,958
It was, at first,
no one could do it.

11
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:00,166
Right, Hartmann?

12
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,333
--[YOSHIKA] Huh?
--[HARTMANN] Hmm.

13
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:02,833
[BARKHORN]
But, with the proper training,

14
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:04,875
you'll be able to keep those
eyeballs peeled in no time.

15
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,125
[HARTMANN snores]

16
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,625
All right, wanna give it a go?

17
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:10,125
[gasps]
It involves a gun...?

18
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:12,333
Could you show us first, maybe?

19
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:15,666
Can you demonstrate? Hartmann?

20
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,166
What's wrong?
Get up here, right now.

21
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:21,083
Oh, fine, then.

22
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:22,708
I'll just show you
while she's asleep.

23
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:24,541
[YOSHIKA]
Hartmann, please wake up!

24
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:25,916
[HARTMANN shrieks]
No, please!

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,041
[MINNA]
This is an emergency alert.

26
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,875
All witches report
to command at once.

27
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:31,416
I repeat, all witches
to my office at once.

28
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,708
What could this be about?

29
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:35,083
I guess we'll learn
more when we get there.

30
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:38,333
Hey, Mio. I want you
to keep me up all night.

31
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:40,625
Sure. My pleasure.

32
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:42,875
I really wish I hadn't
seen or heard that...

33
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:44,166
Have a good night...

34
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,375
Come back!

35
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,000
We've received intel of
a Neuroi attack this evening.

36
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:51,416
So, I will be assigning
extra night duty.

37
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,708
You're going to be
on watch till dawn,

38
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,666
so you won't be able to sleep.

39
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,333
Ah! You're on night duty
tonight, too, Yoshika?

40
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,125
Yeah, looks like it.

41
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,500
Wait, isn't everyone?

42
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:01,916
Well, let me see.

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,875
No, I think you and the regular
night crew can swing it.

46
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,666
Hey, Sanya. Do you
have any pointers on how

47
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,166
to be the best night
watch witch I can be?

48
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,000
Sure. I would love to teach you
how to use your body.

[EILA screams]

50
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,041
[HARTMANN]
No sign of the Neuroi yet.

51
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,583
Ooh, I have an idea:
wanna go for a walk?

52
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:24,708
No, bad idea.

53
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,083
You shouldn't wander
around at night,

54
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:27,500
not even within base walls.

55
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,541
Yeah, you're a fragile
little girl, y'know?

56
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,750
--She's outside.
--She doesn't count.

57
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,708
What is she even
doing out there?

58
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:37,708
[YOSHIKA] I caught the gleam
of a Fuso blade in the dark.

59
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:38,958
[sighs]

60
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,291
So tired..

61
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:41,416
You guys ready?

62
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,916
[YOSHIKA]
Are the Neuroi here?

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,500
No, but I heated
up the big bathtub.

64
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:46,666
Thought we could take a dip.

65
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,666
Heck yeah!

66
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,958
So that was it.

67
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,125
You were out chopping
up logs for the fire.

68
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:53,500
[YOSHIKA]
Sorry I'm late to the party!

69
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,875
Yeah, jeez. You took your time.

70
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,791
Well, it was sorta tough!

00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,083
[HARTMANN, BARKHORN]
Miyafuji!

72
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,791
Ah. Way too hot!

73
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:06,750
[laughs] In Fuso,
this is the normal temperature.

74
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,375
Yeah. It feels great.

75
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:11,750
I like it to be so hot
that it's almost unbearable.

76
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,166
Well, you heard her.

77
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,125
Bathing in water
that's too hot is dangerous

78
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:17,416
and can lead to
heart attack or stroke!

79
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,583
Miyafuji, you like it hot?

80
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:22,125
That does answer my question,
just not literally.

81
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,708
[HARTMANN]
As a very sexy girl,

82
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:28,583
I have some special tips for
a good bath beauty routine.

83
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,458
First of all,
I recommend using Sturm

84
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,416
to move air all around
the body and create

85
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,625
your own personal jacuzzi!
It relaxes and beautifies!

86
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,875
[sighs]
This feels so good!

87
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,750
[BARKHORN] Ugh, can't
you pass gas elsewhere?

88
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,416
[SANYA] Doesn't the sauna
feel amazing, Eila?

89
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,291
Yeah! Glad we begged for one.

90
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:48,666
Although, to be
perfectly honest,

91
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,458
I would have preferred
a savusauna.

92
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:51,708
No one agreed.

93
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,916
Wait, this says it's 176?

94
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,916
That's too cold.

95
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,875
Wanna go outside?

96
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:59,041
Outside? No, It's too hot!

97
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,958

Yeah!

Um, yes? What is it?

You two can go to bed now.

106
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,291
Then why the heck did
you bring us here to begin with?

[YOSHIKA giggles]

108
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,791
Do you have any gum?
It helps me stay awake.

109
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:25,250
No gum, but I have this.

110
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,166
We used to eat
this back in Fuso.

[SAKAMOTO]
I take it you don't like them?

No, I hate them,
and you better not forget it!

114

[BARKHORN chuckles]
Ah. Wow. Ah, you freaked out.

115
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,416
Yoshika. May I use the kitchen?

116
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,083
Are you gonna cook something?

117
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:44,916
Yeah, everyone
is getting a little hungry.

118
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,375
But wait...
Doesn't eating make you sleepy?

119
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,125
We could make it
taste disgusting.

120
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:50,583
That sounds kinda fun.

121
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:53,750
Hold on! This requires
some serious thought!

122
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,958
We're going into battle,
so we need nutrition.

123

No, we don't!

For once, I think Mio's right.

not ruin Sanya's cooking!

We'll make them pay for this.

[LUCCHINI]
Hmm-hmm!

They were up all night
guarding against the Neuroi.

157
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,833
So, the only reason they
were awake when I showed up

158
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:11,208
is they were waiting for
the Neuroi I defeated?

I guess it's up to you
to represent us, Lucchini.

her what she needs.

161
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:16,833
Roger!

162
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,791
[MARSEILLE] Ah! But they wanted
photos of me shaking hands

163
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:19,958
with another ace!

164
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:22,458
Sorry, the aces
need their sleep.

165
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,958
Minna! I know
this is the front lines!

166
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,666
But if one late night
knocks your people out,

167
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,375
that's sure sign of abuse!

168
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:29,625
[MINNA]
That's not why!

169
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:31,916
They slack off all day,
so they've gotten soft!

170
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,708
But I can't say that!

171
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,708
[YOSHIKA]
They woke us up again...

172
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,333
I'm Marseille,
one of the Storm Witches

173
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:40,000
from Africa. Hello, girls.

174
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,625
I'm here as part of a military
propaganda campaign called

175
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:45,833
the "Meeting of Aces."
And I'm honored to be here.

176
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:46,958
[GIRLS snoring]

177
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,166
Sorry. I woke you up.

178
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,750
Anyone want an autograph?

179
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:53,458
No apologies, please,
it's not your fault!

180
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,708
Looks like she's
still a pain the butt.

181
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,333
Hold on, do you know her?

182
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:58,583
Rumor has it she was Hartmann's

183
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:01,041
only real rival
back in Karlsland.

184
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:05,041
She turned every little thing
into a competition between us.

185
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,791
Eating contests.
Bathing tournaments.

186
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:11,333
Training was the worst of all!
Like I said, a pain in the butt.

187
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:14,291
For real. She sounds
like a total stalker.

188
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,708
[BARKHORN]
Wow, you're one to talk.

189
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,375
Oh, I just remembered.

190
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:21,125
My little sister really wanted
me to get your autograph.

191
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:25,625
Yeah? Of course.
I love signing autographs.

192
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,208
I thought... she hated them.

193
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,916
I bet she was just
using reverse psychology.

194
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,541
[gasps] I won't sign anything
for a block-headed sister lover.

195
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,125
Hanna, shut your mouth!

196
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:38,791
Trudy's no block-head, and she's
definitely not obsessed with--!

197
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,750
Yeah, you're right, never mind.

198
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,083
[BARKHORN]
How dare you?!

199
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,291
Why don't we all just
sit down for a nice lunch?

200
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:47,083
We could have an
eating competition, Hartmann!

201
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,416
Fine, but be forewarned,
you're cruising for a losin'.

202
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,791
Ooh!

203
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:53,000
You'll say yes to
your arch nemesis but not me?

204
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,000
[MARSEILLE]
We're off!

205
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,000
[HARTMANN]
Thank you for this food

206
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,875
we are about to receive, amen.

207
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,666
Young lady, such bad manners!

208
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,500
Well, I guess we have a winner.

209
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,208
It appears
my plan has backfired.

210
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:04,375
Pardon me, kitten.

211
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,541
May I have a glass
of milk instead of tea?

212
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,333
Will that pair well
with your lunch?

213
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:09,791
Yes, of course.

214
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,291
It's the best way to
maintain good eyesight.

215
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,500
And, thanks to milk, I've
officially got the loveliest

216
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,750
proportions in the entire world.

217
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,625
[GROUP]
You did not just say that!

218
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,625
Uh, Yoshika...?

219
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,333
Why would she need
to compete when she's blessed

220
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,875
with unique, valuable skills
like the butt reload?

221
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,666
Whoa, what is that?

222
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,291
[HARTMANN] She carries
her ammo at her hip,

223
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,291
then bounces it with her
butt up to her hand

224
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,250
so she can reload her weapon.

225
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,833
[YOSHIKA]
That's a neat trick!

226
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,291
Oh, right. Yeah, it is true.

227
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,500
Say what you will about me,

228
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,416
but I'm the world's
greatest Butt Master.

229
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,916
Ha! More like Butt Apprentice.

230
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,958
'Scuse me?

231
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,666
Check out this butt load!

232
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,833
Commander Minna
uses her butt to--

233
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:49,208
So. Who are
you gonna pair up with?

234
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:52,750
Oh, right, I almost forgot.
Well, after all,

235
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:56,000
I rearranged my schedule to come
and see my old friend, Hartmann.

236
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,958
I've never pitied Hartmann more.

237
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,916
Yes. Hartmann
is the strongest witch

238
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,708
living on this base,
I have no doubt.

239
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,000
[YOSHIKA groans]

240
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,166
Oh, you're right!

241
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,666
Ha, ha, sure, looks
like I'm your girl!

242
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,833
[MARSEILLE]
I'm picking up on a weird vibe.

243
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,416
Excellent work, you two!

244
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,166
Hartmann's pretty impressive
when she decides

245
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,791
to stop slacking off!

246
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:19,250
Yeah, well,
that's my rival for ya!

247
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,125
Brave in battle,
beautiful on the ground.

248
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:24,083
She's part apex predator,
and part lily in bloom.

249
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,125
Having a stalker must be hell.

250
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:29,125
Eila. We need to have a talk.

251
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,666
All right.
Better start the long trip home.

252
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,208
Are you leaving already?

253
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,458
Why not have a nice,
hot bath first?

254
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,208
Uh, Yoshika...

255
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,500
Ah, wait. This is for you.

256
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:42,750
Wow, an autograph? Thanks a lot!

257
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,791
You should
stay longer next time.

258
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,708
No contests, though, okay?

259
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:50,125
Deal. Thanks for
being a sport, old friend.

260
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:51,791
Welp, see you around!

261
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:55,833
[GIRLS] I can't believe
they woke us up for this.

262
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,250
[HARTMANN]
See, guys, I can be serious!

263
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,916
[MICHIKO] Hello, everyone!
It's that time again!

264
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,708
Michiko Yamakawa's Strike
Witches Classroom!

265
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,833
Today, I'll be
teaching you about Minna!

266
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,500
Her full name is
Minna Dietlinde Wilcke!

267
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:42,583
[MICHIKO]
She's the fearless leader of

268
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,916
the 501st joint fighter wing!

269
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,875
All the other girls
report to her!

270
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,416
And she also
happens to be one of

271
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,125
the Karlsland Empire's
ace witches!

272
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:53,166
In her time
fighting for the 501st,

273
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,375
she's accomplished a lot!

274
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,125
Because of the
beautiful and elegant way

275
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,166
she fights, she's sometimes
referred to as

276
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,000
the "Flying Fürstin,"
which means "Princess."

277
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:05,291
And, she navigates delicate
military politics with grace.

278
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:08,041
After all, as the witch
who created the 501st,

279
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,041
leadership comes
naturally to her!

280
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,041
She sure knows
how to give orders!

281
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,458
Her inherent ability is called,

282
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:16,125
"Three Dimensional
Space Understanding."

283
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,375
This allows her to find the
positions of all enemies

284
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:22,000
and allies instantaneously,
even in the middle of a battle!

285
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,333
I guess you
could say that Minna is

286
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,916
the ideal commander!

287
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,791
However. Minna
has also dreamed

288
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,666
of being a famous singer,
and she's widely regarded

289
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,791
as the most talented vocalist
of all the witches!

290
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,458
I can't believe
Yoshika gets to work with

291
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:38,833
such a well-rounded witch
who's a fighter and a singer?!

292
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,791
Way to go, Yoshika!

293
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:52,083
[MICHIKO]
Me, again, Michiko Yamakawa.

294
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,958
I've gotten word that Yoshika's
having a hard time lately.

295
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:58,083
I wonder what's going on.
I'm a little worried!

296
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:01,791
Next time: "501st.
You Can't Fly Anymore?"

297
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,208
You've never seen witches
like these before!
