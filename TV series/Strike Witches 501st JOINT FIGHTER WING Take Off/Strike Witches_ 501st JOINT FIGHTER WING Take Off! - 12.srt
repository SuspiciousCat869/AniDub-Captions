1
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,375
I'll master Shin Reppuzan,
a fighting style

2
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:45,583
even stronger than
regular Reppuzan.

3
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:48,291
Reppuzan!

4
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:51,833
[SHIRLEY screams]

5
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:54,458
[LUCCHINI screams]
Shirley!

6
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:02,125
[BARKHORN] You were developing
the Shin Reppuzan,

7
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:04,583
and there was, in your own
words, "an accident"?

8
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,750
[SAKAMOTO]
Yes.

9
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:08,166
If I could just master
it, then no Neuroi

10
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,250
would ever match me. So...

11
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,333
I'm worried about Shirley:
she went kinda bald

12
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:15,000
when the shockwave hit her
and now her head's shiny.

13
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:17,208
I think healing magic can
fix it, but I'm concerned

14
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:18,791
that it can't, and she'll
have to live her life

15
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:20,208
as a bald woman.

16
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:22,041
It's happened to me
before, too, Shirley,

17
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:25,708
so don't fret. Okay,
that's a lie, but still.

18
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:26,958
Miyafuji.

19
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:28,958
Please, do something--
heal her hair! Quick!

20
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:30,708
I'm on it!

21
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:32,791
[SHIRLEY]
Oh, thank you, Miyafuji!

22
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:35,041
[YOSHIKA]
Yeah, you're welcome.

23
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,791
Sorry, I know you're tired,

24
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:39,208
but there's somebody else
we need you to heal.

25
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:42,208
Wha--? Don't tell me more
people were badly injured!

26
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:45,250
Well, no, not exactly: Trudy
pulled an abdominal muscle

27
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,833
laughing too hard.

28
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,458
Miyafuji, if you wouldn't mind,

29
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:50,208
I'd like your help
with something, too.

30
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:51,833
Dare I ask?

31
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:54,583
I need freshly spilled blood
to complete the ritual.

32
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:55,958
[YOSHIKA]
Mm?

33
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:01,583
Sorry, I didn't quite
catch that, come again?

34
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:03,583
I said, I need
freshly spilled blood!

35
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,791
I would blame this on
the language barrier,

36
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:09,041
but the major and I speak
the same native tongue.

37
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,000
[SAKAMOTO] I need to make
a katana that can handle

38
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,333
the Shin Reppuzan,
and I've heard that one

39
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:16,041
can use fresh blood to
strengthen a katana blade.

40
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:17,416
[YOSHIKA]
Heard where?

41
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,875
I don't have any
blood lying around.

42
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,458
Maybe I wasn't
being clear enough.

43
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,291
I'm planning to
use my own blood.

44
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:24,875
I'll just need you to heal me.

45
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:28,166
[YOSHIKA] Why didn't you say it
like that from the beginning?

46
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:31,875
The time has come at last.

47
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:34,666
[MINNA] The Allies are launching
an attack on a Neuroi nest.

48
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,000
They're not using witches.

49
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,041
Instead, they'll turn
the battleship <i>Yamato</i>

50
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:41,000
into an artificial Neuroi, and
then launch a full-scale attack

51
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,166
with the rest of the fleet.

52
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,708
This battle will decide
humanity's fate.

53
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,750
I've got big news, witches!

54
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,000
What the hell is going on here?

55
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,875
You've got the wrong idea!

56
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:56,125
[SAKAMOTO sighs] All right.
Let's get back to work.

57
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,875
--Here goes!
--[YOSHIKA] Stop! Jeez!

58
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:00,916
What's wrong? I wanna
get this done.

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,666
Do you have to
cut your stomach?

60
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,333
Can't you pierce your skin
somewhere that isn't as risky?

61
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,583
Don't worry. It's just the tip!

62
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:09,041
I won't stick it in all the way.

63
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,041
No offense, Major, but
you're way too clumsy

64
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,666
to pull that off, okay?

65
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,625
You're just gonna get too
excited and lose control

66
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:15,791
and stick it all the way in!

67
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,208
Why don't you
trust me, Miyafuji?

68
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,750
Don't do this.

69
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:22,250
[SAKAMOTO sighs]
What's your problem, guys?

70
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,541
You mean you really
don't trust me

71
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,208
to pull off a stunt like this?

72
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,666
Also, why are your
faces all red?

73
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,250
They're naughty girls
with dirty minds

74
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:32,625
and they heard you and Miyafuji
talking about "sticking it in."

75
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,791
You might have to
spell it out for me.

76
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,500
[LYNNE chuckles]
Forget it, Major,

77
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,666
just promise me
you'll never change.

78
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,250
I still don't get it,
but I assure you

79
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,333
I'll always be myself.

80
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:43,750
Medics, go find
some fresh blood

81
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,250
so we can get this over with!

82
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,958
And that's an order, you hear?

83
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,333
[BOTH]
Huh?!

84
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,541
[HARTMANN]
What do we do?

85
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,958
I'll let you know
when I have an idea.

86
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,708
Ah! Wow, Medics,
I am truly impressed!

87
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,916
Now, time to make the blade!

88
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,833
If you're about to do
that Reppuzan crap again,

89
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:07,000
please aim it away from all
the people and buildings!

90
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,583
[MINNA] We've already
got to rebuild the base,

91
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,708
so why don't you take this
to some remote location

92
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,250
where you won't blow things up?

93
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:15,208
[SAKAMOTO gasps] What's the
whole Allied fleet doing here?

94
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,958
[MINNA] Huh, that's an
excellent question.

95
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,958
Well, you might as well
ask them to drop you off

96
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,666
at one of those little
desert islands.

97
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,458
She gets a vacation? No fair!

98
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,333
We all deserve
to go to the beach!

99
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,958
This is the furthest thing
from a vacation, but sure.

100
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:30,458
Oh, fine. You can all
go get some R and R.

101
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:31,583
Minna!

102
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:32,916
Really?

103
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,375
[MINNA] It's not like
we can train or do chores

104
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,083
with the base like this, anyway.

105
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,291
[YOSHIKA]
Mm-hm.

106
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,458
You don't think getting a lift

107
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,416
from a battleship
is against the rules?

108
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,791
I requested it as a special
mission and was approved,

109
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,208
no questions asked.

110
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,333
You still haven't said
why they're even here.

111
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,833
I vaguely remember
getting a call about it.

112
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,541
But all the details seem
to have slipped my mind,

113
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:54,125
so I guess it couldn't
have been important.

114
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,666
It just dawned on me.

115
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,375
There's no way this is gonna
be a restful getaway, is there?

116
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,208
It all feels like a setup
to make sure no one

117
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:03,000
interferes with
repairs on the base.

118
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:05,625
But, it's an officially
approved vacation--

119
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,583
we might as well
take advantage of it.

120
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,750
[SOLDIER 12A] They call the
final battle a vacation?

121
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:12,625
[SOLDIER 12B] No, look at Major
Sakamoto's funeral kimono!

122
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,458
[SOLDIER 12A] She's prepared
to sacrifice herself in battle!

123
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,041
Such courage!

124
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,291
[SOLDIER 12B] The witches are
prepared to give their lives!

125
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,791
Sakamoto, it's a bit
early for this.

126
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:23,500
Don't spoil her excitement.

127
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,208
[SAKAMOTO]
That island will do nicely!

128
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:28,166
All right, 501st,
follow my lead!

129
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,375
Please keep a safe
distance from the island.

130
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,916
The last thing you want is
to get caught in this blast.

131
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
[SOLDIERS]
Yes! We'll stay away!

132
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:38,750
Everyone, salute the 501st
and pray for their victory!

133
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:41,625
[BARKHORN] What did you
tell those guys, Minna?

134
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:44,041
[SOLDIER 12A] That's it!
I've spotted the Neuroi nest!

135
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,541
[SOLDIER 12B]
Let the battle begin!

136
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:48,791
This fight determines
the fate of humanity!

137
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:49,958
Vacation time!

138
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,458
The sweet smell of freedom!

139
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,583
Can you at least
carry your own bags?

140
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:57,125
Good, I see the perfect spot
for making my katana.

141
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,666
[YOSHIKA]
Good luck with all that.

142
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,541
Now, time to enjoy
a tropical holiday!

143
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:04,625
Heck yeah, time to do all
the awesome vacation things!

144
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:07,458
[LUCCHINI] Hm. Isn't this
what we always do?

145
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:08,625
[HARTMANN]
Hey, Miyafuji.

146
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,125
Do you think the
commander just wanted

147
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:11,583
to get us out of her hair?

148
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,916
Do you really wanna know?

149
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,041
We need to figure out
what to do for lunch.

150
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,750
Way ahead of you--I brought
enough fish for everyone!

151
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,583
Okay, but why did you drain
their blood in advance?

152
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,458
Hang on. That's it?

153
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:24,833
You're not gonna skin them?

154
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,375
Your people eat grapes
with the skin on

155
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,000
all the time, don't they?

156
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,791
Finally done! Ha!

157
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:32,041
I call this one the Reppuu-maru!

158
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:33,833
[SHIRLEY]
Its energy is incredible.

159
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:37,083
[SAKAMOTO] At last, I've all but
mastered the Shin Reppuzan!

160
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,583
[HARTMANN, YOSHIKA] I can't
believe the fish blood worked.

161
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:42,458
[SAKAMOTO] Time to get
masterin'! Reppuzan!

162
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:45,750
[BARKHORN] She's so excited.
Like a kid with a new toy.

163
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,500
[SAKAMOTO]
Reppuzan!

164
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:50,083
Sakamoto. I think
you mastered it!

165
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,750
It's not me! The
katana's taken over!

166
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:55,208
[gasps] Was it the seafood?

167
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:56,791
Will the same thing
happen with the knife

168
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,208
I used to cook the fish?

169
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,791
It didn't happen with the
chickens the other day.

170
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,166
[SOLDIER 12A] Oh, no! A bunch
of stuff happened offscreen,

171
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,583
and now the <i>Yamato</i> 's been
absorbed by the Neuroi!

172
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:09,125
[SOLDIER 12B] Could this be the
end of the human race itself?

173
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:10,375
[SOLDIERS]
What's this?

174
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,791
Will Major Sakamoto's
Reppuzan save the day?

175
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:15,416
[SOLDIER 12A]
Ha, ha! The Neuroi nest!

176
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,958
[SOLDIER 12B] Thank goodness!
Europe is free at last!

177
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,458
She's under the
katana's control--

178
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,708
be careful where you grab her!

179
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:24,208
Miyafuji, please
don't grab me there!

180
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,708
What do we do with it?

181
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:29,250
All we can do is keep firing
till my magic runs out.

182
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,666
[BARKHORN] I'm terrified of
what's happening beyond

183
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,708
the horizon, so I'm gonna
suggest we just ignore it.

184
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,750
Miyafuji, you have
to use your magic

185
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:36,958
to block the major!

186
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,833
Do it to protect your friends!

187
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,416
Huh?!

188
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,666
[SAKAMOTO] I'm sorry,
Miyafuji--here goes!

189
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,208
[yells] I won't let
my dinner win!

190
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,791
[BARKHORN, HARTMANN, LUCCHINI,
SAKAMOTO, SHIRLEY] Her dinner?

191
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,666
Miyafuji, you didn't
really have to block

192
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,333
all the katana's attacks
until its magic ran out.

193
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,833
It was a fight I had to see
through to the bitter end,

194
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,583
for the good of the human race.

195
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,958
Does this mean I
can't fight anymore?

196
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,416
I can no longer protect anyone?

197
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,833
[HARTMANN] She's collapsing
under the weight of her guilt!

198
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,541
No, my magical energy
may be depleted,

199
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:14,125
but I can still fight
the Neuroi in other ways!

200
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:15,250
[SOLDIER 12A]
Amazing!

201
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,500
[SOLDIER 12B]
Why can't I stop crying?

202
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,458
[MINNA]
Hey! Big news, witches!

203
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,416
The Neuroi nest
has been destroyed!

204
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,375
Europe is free at last!

205
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,083
[SAKAMOTO]
Wait, why does it say I did it?

206
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,708
I don't remember that!

207
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,041
What?

208
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,250
The Shin Reppuzan struck
right to the nest's core?

209
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,500
The one that I fired
from on the island?

210
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,791
Yeah, seems like that's
what it says here.

211
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,625
You're so amazing, Major!

212
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,875
Now, I have some
not-so-great news.

213
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:43,500
The 501st will have to
be split up temporarily.

214
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,125
[ALL]
Huh?!

215
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,875
It's only for a short time.

216
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,916
The Neuroi are gone now,
and to top it off,

217
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,166
we don't even have a place
to live at the moment.

218
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,750
I hadn't thought about that.

219
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,625
But this is just so sudden!

220
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,875
The military can't
realistically concentrate

221
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,625
all its ace witches here.
It's a non-functional base.

222
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:02,791
But we never actually did
anything when it functioned!

223
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,041
Do you guys have any idea where

224
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,000
you're gonna go when
you leave the base?

225
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,708
We're still soldiers,
so we'll probably

226
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,875
just get sent back
to our old units.

227
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,541
What about you, Miyafuji?

228
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:15,458
I'm going back home to Fuso
so I can study medicine.

229
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,708
If anything happens,
you call me!

230
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:20,458
I'll save you, even if it
means abandoning my post!

231
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,291
Oh, sweet Barkhorn!

232
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:25,083
And to think she used to be
such a stickler for the rules.

233
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,083
Yes, it's so very moving!

234
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:30,083
I dunno, to me, she just
sounds like a stalker.

235
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,333
Where will you go?

236
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,500
I'm gonna go to Suomus
with Sanya to help her

237
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,333
look for her missing parents.

238
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm gonna work
to rebuild Gallia,

239
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,333
now that it's finally
free from the Neuroi!

240
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:42,208
I'm gonna tag along and
assist the reconstruction!

241
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,041
The Neuroi are persistent,
so we're gonna

242
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,833
work to stay prepared for
their inevitable return.

243
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:50,208
I'm close to everyone else,
so not much is gonna change.

244
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:51,708
[BARKHORN] There's gonna
be one less person around

245
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,875
to help keep these
lunatics in check?

246
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,125
[SHIRLEY] This crazed maniac
will be unleashed upon us

247
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,750
and we'll have no healer
to counteract the damage?

248
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,291
It may only be temporary,

249
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,083
but after everything we've
been through together,

250
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:03,250
we'd better make
sure that we leave

251
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,875
this base on good terms.

252
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,583
Yes, well said.

253
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:09,958
Ya better start cleaning, then.

254
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,000
Hold on!

255
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,458
What if we preserve
this room as is

256
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:15,041
and turn it into a 501st Museum!

257
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,416
In 100 years, people
will know how we lived!

258
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,041
[HARTMANN screams]

259
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,416
Miyafuji. I hope you won't
feel too out of place

260
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,666
when you get to Fuso.

261
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,750
Cooking and cleaning are
my chores at home, too,

262
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,625
so it won't be that
big of a change.

263
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:29,750
Oh, wait. My parents run
a clinic in my hometown,

264
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,458
and we have tons
of patients every day,

265
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:32,666
so I'll be studying medicine,

266
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,083
treating patients...
I might even feel useful

267
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,625
around there for once!

268
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,041
[BARKHORN] But, you're
gonna came back, though,

269
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,166
right, Miyafuji?

270
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,416
[SHIRLEY]
Please, Miyafuji! Come back!

271
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,666
[HARTMANN]
Yeah!

272
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,833
[YOSHIKA] And so, the
501st Joint Fighter Wing

273
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,416
was dissolved.

274
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:22,291
[MICHIKO]
Hello, everyone!

275
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,625
It's that time again:
for Michiko Yamakawa's

276
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,250
Strike Witches Classroom!

277
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,333
Since this is our last
class, I'd like to take

278
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:31,541
this opportunity to teach you
about a very special witch!

279
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,041
Guess who it is!

280
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,333
None other than my best friend,

281
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:38,166
the one and only
Yoshika Miyafuji!

282
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,708
Her father is Doctor
Miyafuji, and he was

283
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:43,500
one of the people who
developed the Striker Unit!

284
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,291
As his daughter,
Yoshika has always

285
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:48,333
had incredible
magical potential.

286
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:52,416
Sakamoto recognized her talent
and recruited her to the 501st.

287
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,166
I was so excited for
Yoshika when I heard!

288
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,833
She quickly put her
talents to work

289
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:59,250
and became a crucial
member of the squadron!

290
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:02,500
And solidified her place
on the team in no time!

291
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:05,458
Her inherent magic comes
in the form of "healing."

292
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,958
It gives her the ability
to heal any wound,

293
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:10,000
no matter how bad it might be!

294
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,916
Yoshika has helped me
countless times

295
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,500
when I've been hurt.

296
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,500
She's the type of person
who will do anything

297
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,000
in order to help others.

298
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,791
As you might recall from
earlier, Yoshika sacrificed

299
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,416
all of her magic
to defeat an army

300
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,750
of attacking Neuroi
and destroy their nest!

301
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,625
She's a veritable hero!

302
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,833
I'm so proud of all she's done!

303
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:32,750
It's an honor to call her
my best friend! She's amazing!
