1
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:45,291
[HARTMANN] Ah, spring, and a
beautiful day off to enjoy it.

2
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:48,541
A day spent doing
as little as possible.

3
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:51,041
Lovely. To have this
time to myself,

4
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:53,000
where no one bothers me at all.

5
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:56,916
It's just the thing an ultra ace
like me needs to recharge.

6
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,375
There are lots of ways
you could make use

7
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:00,625
of this time, like getting
the garbage out of our room.

8
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:03,250
I'm sure the angels can handle
all that stuff for me.

9
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:04,666
I have to share a room with you,

10
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,500
and the trash is starting
to creep over to my side.

11
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:11,250
[HARTMANN chuckles] Then I guess
the angels are already helping.

12
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,500
Don't hold me back, Miyafuji!

13
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:15,875
We're gonna head up there
right now and get started.

14
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:18,875
To our room? How very
forward of you!

15
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,875
Shouldn't we at least go out
for a nice dinner first?

16
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:22,250
Enough with the pervy jokes--

17
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,500
we're cleaning up
our nasty room! Now!

18
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:26,125
Ah, spring. And a
beautiful day off.

19
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:27,458
[BARKHORN]
Come on!

20
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,625
You understand what it's
like, right, Miyafuji?

21
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:31,875
Yeah, you've gotta
clean your room!

22
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:33,958
Make me!

23
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:36,125
I can help you guys
if you need me to.

24
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:37,416
That'd be great.

25
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,750
We'll need the heavy-duty
tools for this job.

26
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,125
Good morning.

27
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:42,166
What's this?

28
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,625
Are you about to
mine for some gold?

29
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:46,250
[HARTMANN muffled grunting]

30
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,833
[SANYA]
Now, don't do anything rash!

31
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:49,958
Relax, we're just gonna
clean their room.

32
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,541
So you tied her up?

33
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:53,041
I'm actually impressed.

34
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,916
You're gonna spend
this gorgeous day off

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,833
cleaning up your
disgusting room?

36
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,416
It must be really bad.

37
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,166
Yeah, there's a whole
ecosystem thriving in there.

38
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,166
Ecosystem? I think that
sounds kind of cool.

39
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,208
Yes, it's very impressive.

40
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,500
You call this pile of
crap an ecosystem?

41
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,291
I was under the impression
we all understood

42
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:15,416
that statement to be
hyperbolic, but I guess not.

43
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,833
Now you see how shameful
her living habits are!

44
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,666
Yeah, and someone who
wants to be a doctor

45
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,125
has got take better
care of themselves.

46
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,708
[HARTMANN sniffles] You don't
have to be so cruel about it!

47
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,750
I'm a human being, too!

48
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,208
[MIYAFUJI]
H-Hartmann, come back!

49
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,833
I predicted that
she would run away.

50
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,500
So, I ambushed her.

51
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:35,416
No fair! You can see
the future, cheater!

52
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,083
[MIYAFUJI] Ugh. There's
basically nowhere to step.

53
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,791
[BARKHORN]
Where did all this come from?

54
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:40,875
[HARTMANN]
I'm trying to think of this

55
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,958
as a battlefield exercise.

56
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,458
I love my sweet trash,
but I have to remain stoic.

57
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:48,083
Yeah, sure you're
attached to this trash.

58
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,625
I went into the air force
thinking I wouldn't

59
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,583
have to clear minefields,
but here we are.

60
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,958
--Uh... What minefields?
--[crunch]

61
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,000
Uh...

62
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:56,916
[SANYA]
I stepped on an old potato.

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,291
Ugh! That's so gross!

64
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,250
It's stacked all the
way to the ceiling.

65
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,250
Where does she even sleep?

66
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:06,916
Oh, it's simple! First,
I put on my Striker Unit.

67
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,375
Then, I dive through
this little gap!

68
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,250
I keep the place cool
using my magic,

69
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:12,416
and the giant wall of trash...

70
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,875
Don't be shy, just
throw everything away.

71
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:17,125
[EILA, SANYA, MIYAFUJI]
Oh, okay.

72
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,125
[EILA]
Future prediction.

73
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,416
This one is definitely
safe to toss.

74
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,416
This one's safe
to get rid of, too.

75
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,625
And, more trash!

76
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,250
[HARTMANN] It's mean
to ignore me, you know.

77
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,708
[EILA screams]

78
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,666
[HARTMANN screams]

79
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,541
Are you okay under
there, Hartmann?

80
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,166
I'm sorry!

81
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,083
Miyafuji, use a high-potency,

82
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:36,416
wide-range healing
spell on Hartmann,

83
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,875
and be quick about it!

84
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:41,416
[MIYAFUJI] Okay! I'll use
all of my power to save her!

85
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,416
[BARKHORN yelps]
The stalks! They're growing!

86
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,541
Oh, no! What are we
supposed to do now?

87
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:48,666
Hold on.

88
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,291
I remember seeing
the Major practicing

89
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,833
some fierce magic for
slicing things in two.

90
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,041
I'll go get her right now.

91
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,541
No, Barkhorn, you
need to calm down!

92
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,291
If it's all tangled together,

93
00:04:58,375 --> 00:04:59,791
can't we just lift
it as one piece?

94
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,666
Brilliant.

95
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,916
Okay, do it now, Hartmann!

96
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,875
Hartmann! Hey, Hartmann!

97
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:10,708
[HARTMANN] Just let me sleep
for 45 more minutes.

98
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,541
[EILA, MIYAFUJI, SANYA]
She's asleep.

99
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,958
I see. I've been wondering
where all my pots

100
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,750
were disappearing to--
this solves that mystery.

101
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,875
I'm really sorry, Yoshika.

102
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:22,208
Ah-- For what, Sanya?

103
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,541
I usually make myself
a meal before I go

104
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,666
on night patrol,
and a lot of the time,

105
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,375
Hartmann eats them with me.

106
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:31,000
So, these pots must
be left over from that.

107
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,625
That makes sense.

108
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,500
Sanya's homemade cooking?

109
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,125
How could you stoop so low?

110
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,750
I'm sorry, I just forgot
to wash up after.

111
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,625
So you're dirty and lazy?

112
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:44,458
[gasps] Ouch. I'm sorry!

113
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,583
[ALL]
All done.

114
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:47,833
I'm so tired.

115
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,000
Crazy that we ended up

116
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,333
throwing pretty much
everything away.

117
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,583
I hope you've learned
your lesson, young lady.

118
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:56,250
Yeah, yeah, I won't let
it get that dirty again.

119
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,208
[SANYA, MIYAFUJI, EILA]
You'd better not,

120
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,833
or you'll be in for it.

121
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,500
So, tell me, Hartmann.

122
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:03,166
Does it feel weird in here
now that it's all clean?

123
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,041
Would it help things if we
covered the floor in grease?

124
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,000
[HARTMANN]
I can't help but think

125
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:09,500
that was a thinly-veiled insult.

126
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:13,500
[LYNNE gasps] What a gorgeous
room! Hey, listen, Hartmann.

127
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,375
I've a message from
Commander Minna.

128
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,500
The press will be here tomorrow,

129
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,250
and she wants you
to speak with them.

130
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,125
[HARTMANN]
Right. Roger that.

131
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,791
She also said to make
sure that you wear

132
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:25,291
your Knight's Cross with
Oak Leaves medal, okay?

133
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:30,916
[ALL]
Eh? Medal? Huh?

134
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,125
[MIYAFUJI] I found it!
Thank goodness. I'm so--

135
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:38,333
[MIYAFUJI] It's right back
to the way it was before.

136
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:39,541
[HARTMANN]
Now you understand why

137
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:42,291
I think cleaning
is a waste of time.

138
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:45,458
And, so, life springs anew!

139
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:46,750
Good morning.

140
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:50,125
Oh, hi, Commander Minna,
good morning to you.

141
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,125
Yes! Good morning!

142
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:55,000
Commander Minna, why are you
wearing that beautiful dress?

143
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,958
Everyone! Battle Stations!

144
00:06:57,041 --> 00:07:00,000
A new type of humanoid
Neuroi has entered the base!

145
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,958
I'm sorry, what did you say?

146
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,875
You weren't addressing
me, were you?

147
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,208
It looks exactly like
Commander Minna!

148
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:09,541
[MINNA] I can't believe
you said it again!

149
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:13,666
I heard a new type
of Neuroi showed up!

150
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,416
Better not get involved.

151
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,791
Commander, stop,
you're overreacting!

152
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,666
What is going on?

153
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,458
Oh, I see what's happening here.

154
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:22,750
Apologize, you two.

155
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,541
[SHIRLEY, HARTMANN]
Yes, we're sorry.

156
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:27,291
Hold on, why are you
wearing that fancy outfit?

157
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:28,958
Because there's a
party later today

158
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,458
for the field officers.

159
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:31,666
[BOTH]
Oh, I get it, so they're

160
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,416
going to a costume party.

161
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,750
Medic!

162
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,791
Wow, she's really been
letting loose on you guys,

163
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,875
since she knows
you'll get healed.

164
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,208
[MIYAFUJI]
You look lovely, Major Sakamoto!

165
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:43,208
Pretty.

166
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,833
Like a real-life princess!

167
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,458
Oh, you three.

168
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:47,875
Of course, the
Commander's outfit makes

169
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,333
a much bolder statement.

170
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:50,708
Oh, yes, I agree.

171
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,041
Like those two dummies said.

172
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,833
Your dress is bold,
yet stunning.

173
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:56,333
Mio, you are too kind!

174
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,291
I said that I would
be attending the party

175
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:59,833
in normal clothes.

176
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,166
Are you kidding me?

177
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,958
This is when you
should dress up!

178
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,333
There's still time to change.

179
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:05,833
I understand!

180
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:09,000
But, if Major Sakamoto wears
that outfit to the party,

181
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,375
won't it make her
really popular?

182
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,208
Yeah, you're right about that.

183
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,250
I'd better make sure no baddies
get anywhere near her.

184
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,541
--The atmosphere!
--[HARTMANN] The birds!

185
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,000
[SAKAMOTO]
See you all later today.

186
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,375
And hold down the fort
for us while we're gone.

187
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:22,500
You got it, boss.

188
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:23,875
Don't you worry 'bout a thing.

189
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,125
Yeah, leave it to us!

190
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,375
You can trust us three
to keep the base safe.

191
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:28,666
[sighs]

192
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,375
Barkhorn. I'm sorry.

193
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:33,500
She already looks like
she's gonna pass out!

194
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:34,750
Have fun.

195
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,541
[MIYAFUJI]
See you later!

196
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,041
[SHIRLEY]
Congratulations!

197
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,583
[HARTMANN]
Wishing you a happy life!

198
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,583
Acting up before we're
even off the lot?

199
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,791
Her eyes are full of rage.

200
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,500
[PERRINE]
Major.

201
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,166
[HARTMANN]
What's wrong with Perrine?

202
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,416
You feeling lonely?

203
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,916
Well, too bad!

204
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,208
Major Sakamoto is Commander
Minna's date today, sorry!

205
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,708
Yeah, you got dumped!

206
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,750
[PERRINE sobs]

207
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,083
I'm sorry!

208
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,750
We were just playing around,
Perrine, don't cry!

209
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,875
I'll steal one of her
spare eye patches for you!

210
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,125
And I can get you a pair
of her spare panties!

211
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:07,375
I refuse to let you two
steal the major's things.

212
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:08,750
So, this is freedom.

213
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,000
Ah. It feels just
like back home.

214
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,375
Freedom!

215
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,333
So, what do we do about them?

216
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,791
Don't worry, I've
got just the thing

217
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,083
to deal with those three.

218
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,958
Oh? What is it?

219
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,208
We do nothing!

220
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,583
[yelps]

221
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,166
Officially, I'm on duty today,

222
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,375
but I think maybe
I'll bake a cake!

223
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,791
[MIYAFUJI] I've decided that
preserving Barkhorn's sanity

224
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:30,083
is my utmost priority.

225
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:33,083
I'm technically on duty,
but I'm gonna take a nap!

226
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:36,375
I can tune my Striker Unit
and not worry about anyone!

227
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:39,541
Maybe I'll take a nap up here
for a nice change of pace!

228
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:40,958
[HARTMANN, LUCCHINI, SHIRLEY]
But that's just what we'd do

229
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:44,000
on a normal day. How can
we make the most of this?

230
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,125
I know!

231
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,666
Why don't we snoop
in everyone's rooms?

232
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,250
The forbidden kingdoms?

233
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,833
That's sounds exciting!

234
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:52,250
[SHIRLEY] The first stop on
the Forbidden Kingdom Journey

235
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,125
is Commander Minna's Room.

236
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,625
You guys! This
closet has a lock!

237
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:57,833
Secretive!

238
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,791
Do you think that
we can pick it?

239
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:00,916
That does it!

240
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,666
So, what dark secrets
does it hold?

241
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,416
[ALL]
Mm...

242
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,375
What will we find in
Major Sakamoto's room?

243
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:11,791
It isn't even locked!

244
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,541
The Major really
is a free spirit!

245
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:16,833
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

246
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,333
[ALL]
Uh...

247
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,083
Freedom is a prison, isn't it?

248
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,833
Yes, what is freedom?

249
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:26,041
With great freedom comes
great responsibility.

250
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,083
[MINNA]
Hey, girls, we're back!

251
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,958
Everybody survive our absence?

252
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,291
[GROUP]
Major! Commander!

253
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:32,333
We were all wrong!

254
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:33,791
We need your
constant supervision!

255
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,916
Yeah, starting tomorrow,
our days of screwing around

256
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,541
are a thing of
the past, we swear!

257
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,458
Please limit our freedom!

258
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,250
[MINNA]
Whoa. What did you do to them?

259
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:44,041
[BOTH] Nothing. We left
them to their own devices.

260
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,875
[MINNA, SAKAMOTO]
You're lying!

261
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:48,291
[HARTMANN, SHIRLEY, LUCCHINI]
Freedom!

262
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,208
[MICHIKO]
Hello, again, everyone!

263
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:24,791
It's time for Michiko Yamakawa's
Strike Witches Classroom!

264
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,041
For today's lesson,
I'm going to teach you

265
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:30,000
all about Erica Hartmann.

266
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,166
She belongs to the
Karlsland Empire's air force

267
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:37,875
and is part of their legendary
Jagdgeschwader 50-second unit.

268
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,291
She's Karlsland's
greatest combat expert,

269
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:43,791
and has more Neuroi kills than
anyone else in the world!

270
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:49,208
I'd say, out of all the witches,
she's the super ultra, top ace!

271
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,916
With her genius intuition
and her level-headed,

272
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,250
keen powers of
observation, she can see

273
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:58,208
the whole battle zone, and
swiftly destroy any enemies.

274
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:01,000
Also, her inherent magic
gives her the ability

275
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,583
to manipulate the
atmosphere around her!

276
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:06,500
When she uses Sturm,
her special technique,

277
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:10,000
there's no Neuroi
that can escape her!

278
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,750
In combat, she's
brave and unstoppable.

279
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:16,000
But in her daily life, she's
a little bit of an introvert.

280
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,958
As for her reputation,
everyone adores her,

281
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:21,791
and many people say
she's like an angel!

282
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,041
Yoshika's so amazing!

283
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:27,750
I can't believe she gets to work
with such an incredible person!

284
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,666
[MICHIKO]
Me, again, Michiko Yamakawa!

285
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,250
Meals are an important
part of military life.

286
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:40,250
I'm sure Yoshika and her friends
get to eat lots of yummy food!

287
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:43,791
Next time: "501st,
Head Out To Shop?"

288
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,500
You've never seen witches
like these before!
