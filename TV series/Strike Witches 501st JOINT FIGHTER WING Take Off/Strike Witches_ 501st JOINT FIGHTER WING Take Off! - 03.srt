1
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:43,166
[YOSHIKA]
It's finally pay day!

2
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:46,166
Well, Miyafuji, you've done
a fantastic job this month!

3
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,166
Thanks, that's nice
of you to say!

4
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,416
Is this right? It feels
like way too much!

5
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,833
Oh, don't worry about it.

6
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:54,166
There's a little bonus
in there 'cause

7
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,291
you stopped that Neuroi advance.

8
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:58,458
[YOSHIKA] Wait, the Neuroi
haven't tried to advance

9
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:00,208
once in the last month.

10
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:01,833
Just take it and be proud!

11
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:03,916
It's a reward for
all your hard work.

12
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,166
But, I haven't done much,

13
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,916
besides help out
with the chores.

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,875
Keeping this place in good shape
is an important part of the job.

15
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:11,791
Everyone here appreciates you.

16
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:13,916
[YOSHIKA]
Wow, thank you for saying that.

17
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,250
I mean it. There are people here

18
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,125
who never do a darn
thing to help out.

19
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:19,416
Man work's hard.
I need a vacation.

20
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,041
I just about died from overwork.

21
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,083
In any case,
it's shopping day.

22
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:25,916
Come into town with us
if you need something.

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,416
Let me see.

24
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,375
I have been needing some
stuff for the kitchen,

25
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:31,166
like utensils and ingredients.

26
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,500
But nothing I could
ever need would

27
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,291
be worth the terror of
being trapped in a car

28
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:36,333
with Shirley driving
like a maniac.

29
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,083
I understand, but you
might not have a choice.

30
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,666
No one wants to ride with her.

31
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,208
They're all fighting about it.

32
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:45,416
Time for the "Ride with Shirley"
rock-paper-scissors game!

33
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,750
[YOSHIKA whimpers]

34
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,916
Miyafuji, Barkhorn, you're
coming with me, right?

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,083
Yeah, but only if you
promise not to kill us.

36
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:53,208
Mind if I come
with you guys, too?

37
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,875
--[EILA, HARTMANN yelp]
--[YOSHIKA] Aw, thanks, Lynne!

38
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,583
If we crash, at least
we'll be together!

39
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:59,083
Aw, it's really
nothing, Yoshika.

40
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,333
--[YOSHIKA whimpering]
--Hey, look alive over there!

41
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,083
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,833
[SHIRLEY] Right! I'm gonna
set a new record today!

43
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:07,833
A record?

44
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,708
Wow, they're gone already?

45
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:12,083
Yeah, they just pulled away.

46
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,458
Do you know who all
ended up going with them?

47
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:17,333
Miyafuji, Lynne, and
Trudy, as far as I know.

48
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,625
I see. Well, that's not good.

49
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:22,083
Forgot to ask them to
get something for you?

50
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,625
No, I was just hoping there'd
be more people to cook for.

51
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,041
[HARTMANN, EILA groan]

52
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,583
I'm happy to make us all lunch,
since our chef went out.

53
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,000
[BOTH] No, thanks.
You don't need to bother

54
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,333
yourself with that.

55
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:34,041
Oh, it's no bother--
you know how I love to cook!

56
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,291
It's been so long since
we had rations for lunch!

57
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:39,291
You're right! Let's do that,
it'd be just like old times!

58
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,791
Well, if that's what you
guys really wanna do.

59
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,583
I'll make dinner later on!

60
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:46,291
[HARTMANN, EILA]
Come back, Miyafuji!

61
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,416
[BARKHORN] Did you guys
sustain any injuries?

62
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,375
[YOSHIKA] No, but I regret
every choice I've made

63
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:51,750
that led me to this point.

64
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,708
[SHIRLEY]
What a sorry bunch of wimps.

65
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,166
I shaved 30 minutes
off the trip

66
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,791
so you'd have more time to shop!

67
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,916
[YOSHIKA] Yeah, and your
cliff jumps and river fording

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,916
shaved a few years off my life.

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,666
[BARKHORN]
Lunchtime already?

70
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,291
[LYNNE] I heard a really nice
café just opened up near here.

71
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,125
Maybe we should try
their lunch menu.

72
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:11,250
Wow, you're a
regular local guide!

73
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,125
[SHIRLEY]
So peaceful.

74
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:14,375
[BARKHORN]
What do you think the others

75
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,791
back at the base
are up to right now?

76
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:20,041
[SHIRLEY] Probably goofing off
and having fun, as usual.

77
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,791
[EILA] We got through
lunch, but I don't see

78
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,416
any way of surviving dinner.

79
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,250
[HARTMANN]
We have to do something, fast.

80
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,125
Problem is that there's
no one around here

81
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,458
who knows how to cook.

82
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:31,000
What can we do with these
cards we've been dealt?

83
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,458
Only one choice.

84
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,208
I'll just have to gaze into
the future and figure out

85
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:35,500
some way to get through this!

86
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,458
My queen!

87
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,375
It must be hard to do
all the cooking yourself,

88
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:40,625
but I can help!

89
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,916
I know exactly what
you're thinking.

90
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,666
You're concerned because
my flavor palate

91
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,791
is a little more
sophisticated than yours.

92
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:49,416
Uh, not quite how
I'd put it, but sure.

93
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,875
Rest assured, Miyafuji's
Fuso-style cuisine

94
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,833
has broadened my
culinary horizons!

95
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,416
[HARTMANN, EILA]
Ooh!

96
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,458
Yeah! I've realized,
the stinkier, the better!

97
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,666
[HARTMANN]
No. She's only getting worse.

98
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,500
Oh, don't you worry.

99
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:04,541
Commander, may I
offer a suggestion?

100
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,291
I'm open to that.

101
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,541
Like you said, the stinkier
the better, right?

102
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:09,375
Yeah!

103
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:13,041
[screams] Please! Stop this!

104
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,583
You see, from the smelly cheese
and fermented bean soup,

105
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,958
to the putrid fish
Miyafuji introduced us to,

106
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:20,291
one thing certainly is true.

107
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,208
For us, "the stinkier
the better."

108
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,333
That might even be our
cardinal rule of cooking!

109
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,875
I like what I'm hearing!

110
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,833
--[HARTMANN] Please save me!
--Miyafuji taught us so well!

111
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:30,083
I know exactly how to
satisfy our cravings!

112
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:33,083
Canned Baltic herring is
the stinkiest of all foods!

113
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,291
Good god.

114
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,166
Imagine hot, rotting
garbage in the middle

115
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,208
of a feral cat colony.

116
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,958
But canned herring isn't
all that different

117
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,375
from our rations, is it?

118
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:44,333
I've got just the thing to
spice it up a little more.

119
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:45,583
Ammonia!

120
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,083
Neuroi! Take me now!

121
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,375
When you open the can, the
liquid tends to squirt out,

122
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,083
and it's caustic, so be careful.

123
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,333
You didn't even consider
opening it outside?

124
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,416
[EILA]
Uh-oh. The can is so swollen

125
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,041
I can't get the
can opener to work.

126
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,666
That's a sign you should stop!

127
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,291
[MINNA]
Oh, no! The cap on this bottle

128
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:02,833
won't budge, either.

129
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:05,208
I'm telling you, it's a sign
from the heavens to give it up!

130
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:06,291
I know!

131
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:07,916
Let's get Major Sakamoto
to slice through

132
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,208
these stubborn containers.

133
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,458
Good idea!

134
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,333
She can open both of them
in one fell swoop!

135
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,583
Can you guys hear me?

136
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:18,083
Were they seriously considering
opening that stuff indoors?

137
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,458
[HARTMANN] I begged them to
at least open it outside!

138
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:21,625
Calm down now.

139
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,708
I'll talk some sense
into them. So...

140
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,708
You're gonna absolutely
love it, Mio!

141
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,208
Everybody from Fuso goes on
and on about this stuff,

142
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:30,833
so I'm really eager
to give it a try!

143
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:34,083
Uh. Okay. I'll
open it, if I must.

144
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,583
Tell them no!

145
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:39,166
There are some things
that even I can't say.

146
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,333
[MINNA]
Right, Mio, now go for it!

147
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:42,541
[SAKAMOTO]
Uh, sure.

148
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,291
[HARTMANN]
Best of luck, Major!

149
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,708
Hartmann, is that
really necessary?

150
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:47,666
[HARTMANN]
You can do it!

151
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,208
Here goes nothing!

152
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:50,958
Major!

153
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,083
Stay back!

154
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,083
How dare you try to stop me?

155
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,250
Let me go! There's still
time to save her!

156
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,500
[HARTMANN]
It's called, "Decoy Fishing,"

157
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,833
and it's nothing but a trap!

158
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,041
[EILA]
That aroma.

159
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,333
Doesn't it make you
feel so utterly alive?

160
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,958
[MINNA] Yes, and this
will enhance that!

161
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:07,541
Did we get everything
that was on the list?

162
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,708
[PERRINE] And now, a message
from our sponsors.

163
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:12,625
Attention, all members
of the 501st.

164
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,708
Major Sakamoto has collapsed!

165
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,958
Please return to the
base immediately!

166
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,375
We don't know how long
we'll be able to hold them off!

167
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:20,833
Thank you!

168
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,833
This was a friendly message
from Perrine Clostermann.

169
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,833
[ALL yelp]

170
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:27,500
Why is Perrine taking
out radio ads?

171
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:30,500
I don't know, but we better
head back to the base, now!

172
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,750
Hurry, jump in!

173
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:34,875
I'll get us there in no
time! Quickly, let's go!

174
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:37,375
Why don't we go back
in our Striker Units?

175
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,500
Come on, just trust me.

176
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,041
Everyone, wait.

177
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,583
With the four of us away,
who do you imagine

178
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,166
is trying to cook
for all the girls

179
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,708
back at the base?

180
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,750
I guess we could wait
and head back after dinner.

181
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,500
Yeah, can't fight
on an empty stomach.

182
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,791
I'll take my sweet
time driving us home.

183
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,125
No, Eila, I refuse!

184
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,250
Come on!

185
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:01,958
[HARTMANN]
Are Sanya and Eila fighting?

186
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,666
Now I guess I've
seen everything.

187
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,750
And Miyafuji is
trying to mediate.

188
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,083
[YOSHIKA] Eila, you have got
to calm down right now!

189
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,250
[HARTMANN gasps]

190
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,541
[HARTMANN]
Wait, what is going on here?

191
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,958
How could this have happened?

192
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,791
I'm filled with dread.

193
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:19,833
It feels like my whole world
is crashing down around me.

194
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:20,833
Gulp.

195
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,541
You won't stop them?

196
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,708
All right, guys,
that's enough, it's time.

197
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,166
[SANYA]
That's our cue, Yoshika.

198
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,833
Okay, just give me one minute.

199
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,708
Here, Eila. I made you
some food to eat later.

200
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,083
It'll make you feel better.

201
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,083
Oh, that's what
the knife was for.

202
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,708
So? What were those
two fighting about?

203
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:40,083
Well, you see...

204
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,791
[HARTMANN, SAKAMOTO]
Eila?

205
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,625
[HARTMANN]
Eila's got a bad cold, huh?

206
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,500
[SAKAMOTO] Yeah, she's sick,
but she's still insisting

207
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:48,125
on going out on patrol
duty with Sanya.

208
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,500
I see.

209
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,291
So, how do we help her feel
well enough to do that?

210
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,666
Oh, that's right, you
wanted to be a doctor.

211
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,708
First, we've gotta
bring her fever down.

212
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,791
Major, help me get
her clothes off.

213
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,666
Because they're
drenched with sweat?

214
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,166
We have to strip her naked
and then toss her outside.

215
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,708
Wait! Stop it!

216
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,916
[EILA]
A wet towel.

217
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,708
It feels so cool and refreshing.

218
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:14,500
Who's that? Oh. Sanya?

219
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,375
[ELIA screams]

220
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,041
Feeling better, right?

221
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,208
Like you had the most
wonderful, healing dream?

222
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:23,083
[EILA] I thought I had
passed on to the other side!

223
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,958
Hey, Major? Is Sanya
still mad at me?

224
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:26,958
She is.

225
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,125
Do you wanna know the secret

226
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,208
to getting back
in her good graces?

227
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,791
Yeah! Yeah!

228
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,958
You know you're in
the wrong, don't you?

229
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,583
That's good. It means
you've already cleared

230
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,750
the most difficult hurdle
in the whole process.

231
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,000
Oh?

232
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,875
Next is Ghandi-esque
nonviolence.

233
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,833
You just have to let Sanya
punch you right in the face,

234
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,083
then run to Miyafuji
and ask her to heal you.

235
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,666
[BARKHORN]
Huh?!

236
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,583
[EILA] That's a little too
enlightened of a strategy

237
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,000
for my taste.

238
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:52,541
Well, watching you two,
I gained some insight.

239
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,083
I think you should be
a little more open

240
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,500
with one another about
how you feel, you know?

241
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,750
I'm naturally
expressive. Listen--

242
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,375
No, I will not.

243
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,583
There's no need to overthink it.

244
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:05,125
You two fought because
you care too much.

245
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,833
One time, Minna
pointed a gun at me

246
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,375
and told me it was
for my own good,

247
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,458
now look at us:
I didn't hold a grudge

248
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:12,000
or take it personally.

249
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,458
[EILA]
Too enlightened for me!

250
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,000
[HARTMANN]
She's asleep.

251
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,166
[SAKAMOTO] Good. A little rest
and she'll be right as rain.

252
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,416
Should we leave these,
in case she gets lonely?

253
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,416
Judging by what she's
muttering, I think yes.

254
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,458
Whelp, nighty-night!

255
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,166
We're back. How is everything?

256
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,916
Is Eila feeling any better yet?

257
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,291
Yeah, she's doing just fine.

258
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,250
She's asleep, but go see her.

259
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,083
Eila! Are you oka--?

260
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,083
[EILA sighs]

261
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,625
You better tell me
where Hartmann is, now!

262
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:47,416
Uh, she was just here,
filing a form

263
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,666
requesting permission
to go off base.

264
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:24,791
[MICHIKO]
Hi, everybody!

265
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,875
Michiko Yamakawa's
Strike Witches Classroom

266
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,291
is now in session!

267
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,541
Today, we're learning
all about Shirley,

268
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:35,000
whom you may also know
as Charlotte E. Yeager.

269
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:37,666
She's from the
United States of Liberion.

270
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,083
One time, she attempted to break

271
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:42,250
the world speed record
on her motorcycle!

272
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:43,666
She succeeded!

273
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,291
And shortly after that,
decided to join the military.

274
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,250
There, she aspired
to be the first person

275
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:51,666
ever to break the speed
of sound in a Striker Unit!

276
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,791
She ascended the ranks
super fast and became

277
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:56,500
a top ace assigned to the 501st!

278
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,000
She's a genius witch,

279
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,791
head and shoulders
above the rest!

280
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:02,833
Her inherent magic ability
is "Speed Boost."

281
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,291
That means that even
the fastest Neuroi around

282
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:08,541
doesn't stand a chance
against her lightning speed!

283
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:12,208
That ability suits her
perfectly, don't you think?

284
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,416
She's sometimes known
as "Glamourous Shirley"

285
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,458
because of her
curvaceous figure.

286
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:20,208
And military propaganda posters
often feature her as a pin-up!

287
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,416
She's got heart and is
someone other people

288
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,791
can look up to!

289
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,666
She always keeps an
eye on the big picture

290
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,250
and can see any
situation objectively.

291
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,833
Yoshika's so amazing!

292
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:33,750
I can't believe she gets to work
with such an incredible person!

293
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,458
[MICHIKO]
Me, again! Michiko Yamakawa!

294
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,375
You've heard about the
fall festival in October

295
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:42,833
called Halloween, right?

296
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,916
I wonder if Yoshika's
having lots of fun!

297
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,625
Next Time: "501st,
It's Time for Halloween?"

298
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:52,166
You've never seen witches
like these before!
