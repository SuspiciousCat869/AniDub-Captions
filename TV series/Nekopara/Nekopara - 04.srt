[GROUP gasps, whimpers]

318
00:17:24,442 --> 00:17:26,983
Meanie! Why did you
have to show us that?

319
00:17:27,067 --> 00:17:28,525
Oh, come on.

320
00:17:28,608 --> 00:17:31,775
It's past time you grew up and
got used to this sort of thing.

321
00:17:31,858 --> 00:17:33,150
[gasps]

322
00:17:33,233 --> 00:17:34,608
Chocola.

323
00:17:34,692 --> 00:17:37,108
Your cat vision seems to be
lacking just a little bit.

324
00:17:37,192 --> 00:17:38,150
[CACAO]
Hm?

325
00:17:38,233 --> 00:17:40,442
So this last one
is pretty difficult.

326
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,358
[GROUP]
Uh?

327
00:17:43,442 --> 00:17:45,400
Hey, don't you think
that was too fast?

328
00:17:45,483 --> 00:17:47,692
For real. I couldn't see.

329
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,483
Oh, yeah? Well, I saw
it perfectly fine.

330
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:53,275
It's "I really, really,
really love Shigure."

331
00:17:53,358 --> 00:17:54,233
[SHIGURE]
That's wrong.

332
00:17:54,317 --> 00:17:56,150
[gasps] Seriously?

333
00:17:56,233 --> 00:18:00,192
Try to pay close attention.
I'll play it one more time.

334
00:18:00,275 --> 00:18:02,733
Although I'm sad
you don't know it.

335
00:18:02,817 --> 00:18:07,275
[grunting]

336
00:18:07,358 --> 00:18:09,525
Cacao? Something wrong?

337
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:14,608
[CHOCOLA] Hold on, did
you figure out the answer?

338
00:18:14,692 --> 00:18:16,608
[CACAO]
Mm.

339
00:18:16,692 --> 00:18:18,483
It actually said,

340
00:18:18,567 --> 00:18:21,983
"I really, really,
really, really" love her.

341
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,817
Yes, that's correct!

342
00:18:25,775 --> 00:18:27,983
[GROUP gasps]

343
00:18:28,067 --> 00:18:29,525
I can't believe
she could read that.

344
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,983
Impressive.

345
00:18:31,067 --> 00:18:32,650
That's wonderful, Cacao!

346
00:18:32,733 --> 00:18:34,442
--[SHIGURE] One more time!
--[GROUP] Huh?

347
00:18:34,525 --> 00:18:37,650
Can you please tell me the
answer just one more time?

348
00:18:42,192 --> 00:18:43,692
All finished.

349
00:18:43,775 --> 00:18:46,150
That wraps up the measurements--
well, at least for this month.

350
00:18:46,233 --> 00:18:48,400
Yay, I'm so glad we're done!

351
00:18:48,483 --> 00:18:50,025
So what do you
guys wanna do now?

352
00:18:50,108 --> 00:18:52,567
[MAPLE] I know, there's a new
shop that opened up near here.

353
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:53,775
Wanna go check it out?

354
00:18:53,858 --> 00:18:56,150
[CINNAMON] A walk sounds
like a lovely idea.

355
00:18:56,233 --> 00:18:58,442
Chocola, you guys are
still free for a bit, right?

356
00:18:58,525 --> 00:19:01,525
Actually, we are, but
Chocola was thinking

357
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:03,650
she wants to take
Cacao somewhere special.

358
00:19:03,733 --> 00:19:04,775
What do you think?

359
00:19:04,858 --> 00:19:06,567
You have a place
in mind already?

360
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:07,650
Yep!

361
00:19:14,608 --> 00:19:16,317
[CACAO gasps]

362
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,733
It's super pretty, isn't it?

363
00:19:19,775 --> 00:19:22,400
[CHOCOLA]
I wanted to show you the ocean.

364
00:19:22,483 --> 00:19:25,192
We live so close to it, but
the first time we ever came here

365
00:19:25,275 --> 00:19:27,025
was when master showed it to us.

366
00:19:27,108 --> 00:19:31,608
Such a nice memory.
I'll never forget it.

367
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:35,483
[KASHOU] So this is the ocean!
What do you guys think?

368
00:19:35,567 --> 00:19:38,900
Wow! It's a giant pond!

369
00:19:42,858 --> 00:19:45,067
It really is wonderful.

370
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,608
It is.

371
00:19:47,942 --> 00:19:51,150
C'mon! Check out the water!

372
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:52,942
[gasps]

373
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,192
It's still too cold
to swim in, though.

374
00:19:55,275 --> 00:19:57,900
Don't worry.
The sea won't hurt you.

375
00:19:57,983 --> 00:19:59,775
But it is salty.

376
00:19:59,858 --> 00:20:02,442
Bonito, fatty tuna,
and all kinds of fishies

377
00:20:02,525 --> 00:20:04,150
live together here in the water.

378
00:20:04,233 --> 00:20:08,150
Come on, now. Fatty tuna
isn't a real type of fish.

379
00:20:08,233 --> 00:20:08,983
[CHOCOLA gasps]

380
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:09,817
[COCONUT gasps]

381
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,067
Seriously?

382
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:14,108
You thought fatty tuna
was a real fish, too?

383
00:20:14,192 --> 00:20:16,983
Whatever, Azuki, of course
I know that's not the case!

384
00:20:17,067 --> 00:20:20,317
Just so you're aware,
it is a part of a tuna.

385
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,358
Yeah, that's what
I was trying to say!

386
00:20:22,442 --> 00:20:24,525
It's shaped like a V, right?

387
00:20:24,608 --> 00:20:25,525
[AZUKI sighs]

388
00:20:25,608 --> 00:20:27,608
Okay, are you ready, Cacao?

389
00:20:27,692 --> 00:20:29,817
Let's go play!

390
00:20:32,942 --> 00:20:34,275
[COCONUT yelps]

391
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,900
--[CACAO] Ahh...
--[VANILLA, CHOCOLA gasp]

392
00:20:42,358 --> 00:20:45,983
[AZUKI giggles]
Take that!

393
00:20:46,067 --> 00:20:48,233
[CINNAMON]
Oh, no!

394
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,108
[CHOCOLA sighs]
Today was so much fun!

395
00:20:54,192 --> 00:20:56,358
For sure, I've worked
up a real appetite.

396
00:20:56,442 --> 00:20:59,150
Yeah, same here, I'm so hungry!

397
00:20:59,233 --> 00:21:01,650
I could eat like ten
bowls of rice right now.

398
00:21:01,733 --> 00:21:03,817
That wouldn't be
very healthy, though.

399
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,067
We should come back
when it's swimming season.

400
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:08,733
Yeah! I love swimming so much!

401
00:21:08,817 --> 00:21:11,025
So did you have a
fun time at the beach?

402
00:21:11,108 --> 00:21:12,483
[CACAO]
Mm!

403
00:21:12,567 --> 00:21:14,900
Next time we come Chocola
will teach you how to swim,

404
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:16,275
that sound good?

405
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,442
Uh?

406
00:21:17,525 --> 00:21:19,817
It's not so scary
once you get used to it.

407
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,192
Oh, and we could
pack a picnic lunch.

408
00:21:22,275 --> 00:21:24,900
I'm on board, but let's
pack a ton of food.

409
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:26,317
[AZUKI]
Seconded!

410
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,483
Like fried chicken, rolled
eggs, all kinds of things!

411
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:30,608
[CINNAMON] I could even
make some inari sushi.

412
00:21:30,692 --> 00:21:32,733
[MAPLE] Anything with
salmon sounds great.

413
00:21:32,817 --> 00:21:34,608
[COCONUT]
I want sausages and hamburgers!

414
00:21:34,692 --> 00:21:36,525
Also, can we have
grilled cheese and meat?

415
00:21:36,608 --> 00:21:38,733
[AZUKI] Man, you eat
entirely too much meat.

416
00:21:38,817 --> 00:21:41,858
[CHOCOLA] Bring strawberry cake
for Chocola, with lots of cream!

417
00:21:41,942 --> 00:21:44,608
[VANILLA] Chocola, that
doesn't qualify as a lunch.

418
00:21:44,692 --> 00:21:47,108
[CHOCOLA]
What? Are you sure?
