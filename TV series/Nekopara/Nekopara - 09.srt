It's not what you think!

00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,442
I wasn't secretly following you

because I was worried
about you or whatever!

You got another job?

Yeah, but, I promise it
wasn't anything too indecent.

00:11:58,442 --> 00:12:02,525
In fact, this business is
completely 100% legitimate.

Like she would only let
the customer get handsy

214
00:12:04,775 --> 00:12:06,942
if they asked for
special permission.

215
00:12:07,025 --> 00:12:08,442
And if it was their first time,

216
00:12:08,525 --> 00:12:11,525
then she would be extra gentle
and show them what to do.

Even though Maple
just started this job,

218

she's already earning
a fantastic rep

That's enough!

Huh? Do I really?

00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,442
What I don't get

225
00:12:24,525 --> 00:12:27,192
is why you feel like you need
to work at a music store at all.

Oh, May.

232
00:12:40,817 --> 00:12:42,983
So I did a little bit of
quick research online,

233
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:45,108
and I read that learning
an instrument is a good way

234
00:12:45,192 --> 00:12:47,817
to get started when you want
to learn to sing better.

That's why.

236
00:12:49,317 --> 00:12:51,650
I got another job, so
I could buy myself a guitar.

237
00:12:51,733 --> 00:12:53,608
Why a guitar, specifically?

238
00:12:53,692 --> 00:12:55,900
Well, I thought it would
be good to learn an instrument

239
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:58,900
that I could play while singing,
which is why I chose a guitar.

240
00:12:58,983 --> 00:13:01,275
Then I'd be able
to perform solo.

No, that defeats the purpose.

Go, Maple!

You've got this in the bag,
so break a leg up there!

00:16:53,483 --> 00:16:55,900
Do your best, okay?

[CINNAMON]
It's almost May's turn to sing.

Why isn't she back here
with everybody else?

C'mon.

00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,400
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

342
00:17:33,483 --> 00:17:34,858
We need to go
back inside quickly

343
00:17:34,942 --> 00:17:36,233
or you'll miss
your turn to sing.

So hurry up. We can't be late.

What's wrong?

I can't.

[CINNAMON]
What?

348
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,358
I quit.

[MAPLE] The other contestants
are either super popular

352
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,608
or are on the
verge of being pros.

353
00:17:51,692 --> 00:17:55,150
And all of the judges are
editors at music magazines.

354
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:58,192
Or they're some
famous producers.

355
00:17:58,275 --> 00:18:01,900
If I go out there, I'll just
make a huge fool of myself.

Um, hey, hold on.
Where are you going?

00:18:04,275 --> 00:18:08,150
Back home. No way I'm going
on stage just to look bad.

[CINNAMON]
To snap you out of this.

361

I just want you to
see how cool you are!

362
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:32,567
But now... you're gonna run away
because you might look bad?

363
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,775
You did so much work
to make this day happen,

What if I mess everything up?

[MAPLE] Everybody worked
so hard to help me prepare.

And they all took off of work.

They cheered me on.

bombing the competition

and let everyone I love
down in the process?

Don't worry.

00:19:19,817 --> 00:19:21,150
Everything will be okay.

00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:25,900
'Cause of you.

385
00:19:25,983 --> 00:19:27,192
Because of the way you acted

when I first came
to live with everyone.

387
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:32,275
I didn't really fit in,

388
00:19:32,358 --> 00:19:34,817
so I was hiding in
the corner of the room.

389
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,817
And you came and scolded me.

390
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,483
Look, I don't really
know what's going on,

391
00:19:39,567 --> 00:19:42,442
but hiding won't
change anything.

392
00:19:42,525 --> 00:19:44,233
[CINNAMON]
That's what you told me,

393
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:46,692
and then you
offered me your hand.

Promise me we'll
always be friends.

I want to be able to stay by
your side forever!

So no matter what kind of
things happen in the future,

whether those things
are good or bad,

I can be right there to
help you if you need it!

See? That's why.

404

If you're afraid, I'm more
than happy to offer you my hand.
