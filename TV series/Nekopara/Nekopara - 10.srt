We needed to figure out how well

162
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,900
you two could follow
instructions, or whatever.

163
00:07:46,983 --> 00:07:48,775
How about a nice cup of tea?

164
00:07:48,858 --> 00:07:51,108
[BOTH grumble]

165
00:07:51,192 --> 00:07:53,608
We'll study for real,
too, obviously.

166
00:07:53,692 --> 00:07:56,358
Lookit. I even brought
you our secret weapon.

167
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,900
A little help from this
and you'll be unstoppable.

168
00:07:58,983 --> 00:08:00,942
[BOTH]
What's that?

169
00:08:01,025 --> 00:08:02,483
I'm confused.

170
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:03,900
They're doomed.

171
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,817
My friends, this is the
Big Book of Bell Exam Secrets!

172
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,400
It's just a textbook.

173
00:08:08,483 --> 00:08:10,525
You can use it as
a study guide to prepare.

174
00:08:10,608 --> 00:08:11,900
Huh?

175
00:08:11,983 --> 00:08:14,442
We used it last time.
It's the exact same one.

176
00:08:14,525 --> 00:08:17,525
What? Yeah, of course
Chocola remembers.

177
00:08:17,608 --> 00:08:20,608
Right, then! Let's dust off
the ol' thinking cap!

178

[AZUKI]
Secret number one:

179
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,025
Remember to check the door
any time you leave the house!

180
00:08:26,108 --> 00:08:27,358
Perfectly understanding
the rules

181
00:08:27,442 --> 00:08:29,650
of human society is
your number-one goal.

182
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:31,067
Safety is important.

183
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,942
So remember to lock
up when you leave.

184
00:08:33,025 --> 00:08:34,525
[VANILLA, CHOCOLA]
Got it.

185
00:08:36,067 --> 00:08:36,900
Now check.

186
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,358
[CHOCOLA, VANILLA]
Locked up!

187
00:08:39,483 --> 00:08:41,608
[CHOCOLA, VANILLA]
Uhh...

188

[AZUKI]
Secret number six!

189
00:08:43,275 --> 00:08:46,358
Be mindful of traffic laws.

190
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:50,067
Look right and
look to your left.

191
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,108
Well done.

192
00:08:55,317 --> 00:08:56,067
[CHOCOLA]
Miss Azuki!

193
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,567
Yes, Miss Chocola.

194
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,775
[CHOCOLA] Why do we raise
our hands to cross the street?

195
00:08:59,858 --> 00:09:01,150
Excellent question.

196
00:09:01,233 --> 00:09:03,275
It's an extra precaution
to make us more visible

197
00:09:03,358 --> 00:09:04,733
to drivers at the crosswalk.

198
00:09:04,817 --> 00:09:06,317
[CHOCOLA]
I see!

199
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,608
It's probably still fine, but
it's an outdated practice now.

200
00:09:09,692 --> 00:09:12,150
The National Public Safety
Commission doesn't care.

201

Learn to ride
the train properly.

00:09:23,192 --> 00:09:24,733
Ten out of ten.

205
00:09:24,817 --> 00:09:26,483
That's not what you do, Cacao!

206
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,650
Here, let Chocola
show you how it's done.

207
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:31,025
Make sure you have your pass
ready so you can keep moving,

208
00:09:31,108 --> 00:09:34,775
touch it to the
machine, and-- [yelps]

209
00:09:34,858 --> 00:09:36,025
But if you do it wrong,

210
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:38,817
it can lead to shame,
injury, or even death.

[COCONUT]
Welcome home!

00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:47,150
Now, are you two ready
for some practical training?

[COCONUT]
Secret number fifteen!

220
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,608
Don't just park it in
random cardboard boxes.

Huh? [yelps]

[COCONUT]
Secret number twenty-one.

223

Never let 'em see you sweat!

224
00:10:22,692 --> 00:10:25,608
Stay calm, even in
unexpected situations.

225
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:26,858
Rude.

226
00:10:26,942 --> 00:10:30,233
You can't expect to keep
your bell like that. Uh.

227

[COCONUT screams]

228
00:10:31,817 --> 00:10:33,733
You can't expect to
keep your bell like that.

229
00:10:33,817 --> 00:10:34,858
I'm not the one who's supposed

230
00:10:34,942 --> 00:10:37,025
to be studying
for the stupid exam!

231
00:10:37,108 --> 00:10:38,067
Ahem.

232
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,650
Anyway, lesson learned,
let's move on.

233
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:42,150
Secret number twenty-eight!

234
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:45,442
You gotta control
those instincts, ladies.

[CHOCOLA meows]

236
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:50,192
Do you wanna repeat back
what I literally just told you?

00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,733
[CHOCOLA gasps]

238
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,942
I'm proud to say I'm not so
easily tempted by such things.

[COCONUT] Don't chew your
nails, either. That's gross.

241
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:00,608
And remember,

242
00:11:00,692 --> 00:11:03,150
punching holes in the paper
doors is a huge no-no.

Doesn't it look fun?

247
00:11:11,692 --> 00:11:13,858
But even if another cat
does it right in front of you,

248
00:11:13,942 --> 00:11:16,983
you have to hold back.

[COCONUT chuckling]

It is super fun,
though! [chuckles]

Master Shigure, uh,
this isn't what it looks like.

252
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,067
I mean, it is, but it's
for training, so it's fine!

00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,817
I think I'll take it from here!

This one's important.

00:11:42,817 --> 00:11:43,942
Don't accept anything

00:11:44,025 --> 00:11:46,400
that's given to you
by a random stranger.

259
00:11:46,483 --> 00:11:48,525
All right. Time for
a little role-play.

260
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:50,775
I'll play the stranger
and you turn me down.

[CINNAMON]
You ladies want a tasty snack?

264
00:12:03,233 --> 00:12:05,525
Cinnamon, playing a
"stranger" is one thing.

Ready?

00:12:26,442 --> 00:12:27,817
Let's talk flowers!

275
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,858
Girl flowers have a pistil,
boy flowers have a stamen.

276
00:12:30,942 --> 00:12:31,942
And the sem--

277
00:12:32,025 --> 00:12:34,858
I mean, uh, the pollen
from the stamen,

278
00:12:34,942 --> 00:12:36,358
then inseminates--

I mean, uh!

280
00:12:37,942 --> 00:12:40,733
You know, it pollinates
the pistil.

281
00:12:40,817 --> 00:12:43,442
And then the flowers
make a baby. [giggles]

That's quite enough.

Chocola is allowed one snack!
