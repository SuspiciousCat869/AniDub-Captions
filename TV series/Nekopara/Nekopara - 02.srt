having a new cat in the
house is pretty exhilarating!

321
00:16:54,358 --> 00:16:56,525
What, you too, Cinnamon?

322
00:16:56,608 --> 00:16:57,983
[CINNAMON]
Of course!

323
00:16:58,067 --> 00:17:00,733
I feel the same way as I did
when I first met you, May!

324
00:17:00,817 --> 00:17:02,150
She's irresistible!

325
00:17:02,233 --> 00:17:03,692
Whoa! Hang on.

326
00:17:03,775 --> 00:17:05,858
This is starting to sound a
little weird, so reel it back.

327
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,608
[SHIGURE]
Calm down, everyone.

328
00:17:07,692 --> 00:17:10,067
I understand that
you're all excited,

329
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,650
but please try not
to bother her too much.

330
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:15,775
This is a new environment, and
she might be a little nervous.

331
00:17:15,858 --> 00:17:17,442
So let's just leave her alone

332
00:17:17,525 --> 00:17:19,442
until she gets
comfortable, okay?

333
00:17:22,525 --> 00:17:24,817
[AZUKI] Uhh... Hey,
here's a crazy idea--

334
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,775
have you ever considered
taking your own advice?

335
00:17:26,858 --> 00:17:29,525
[SHIGURE gasps]
Oh. Uh, the photos?

336
00:17:29,608 --> 00:17:31,900
No! This is just a
record of her growth!

337
00:17:31,983 --> 00:17:34,733
And, uh, if I take these
and put 'em online then,

338
00:17:34,817 --> 00:17:37,525
maybe it'll be easier for her
master to find her here, y'know?

339
00:17:37,608 --> 00:17:38,483
Yeah, no.

340
00:17:38,567 --> 00:17:39,650
What are the odds those will

341
00:17:39,733 --> 00:17:41,775
go straight into her
personal collection?

342
00:17:41,858 --> 00:17:43,483
Oh, def.

343
00:17:43,567 --> 00:17:44,775
All right, everyone.

344
00:17:44,858 --> 00:17:47,192
It's getting late,
so time for a bath!

345
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:48,858
Maple, you always
take the longest,

346
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,983
so try to wrap up
quickly tonight, please.

347
00:17:51,067 --> 00:17:52,233
Fine.

348
00:17:52,317 --> 00:17:53,983
And hurry to bed
when you're done.

349
00:17:54,067 --> 00:17:55,775
You have to get enough sleep!

350
00:17:55,858 --> 00:17:57,358
Staying up too late
can make you sick

351
00:17:57,442 --> 00:17:59,358
and do terrible
things to your fur.

352
00:17:59,442 --> 00:18:00,775
Hey, Master Shigure?

353
00:18:00,858 --> 00:18:02,317
[SHIGURE]
Yeah?

354
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,400
Where do you want the new girl
to sleep for the time being?

355
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:07,150
[SHIGURE]
Uh... Let's see.

356
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:08,900
I guess until she
gets used to the house,

357
00:18:08,983 --> 00:18:10,442
I'll have her sleep in my room.

358
00:18:10,525 --> 00:18:13,775
What? She gets to sleep
with Master Shigure?

359
00:18:13,858 --> 00:18:15,692
[AZUKI]
What's your problem, Nuts?

360
00:18:15,775 --> 00:18:17,567
Feeling a little jealous?

361
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,650
That's cute.

362
00:18:18,733 --> 00:18:20,150
You may have grown
up to be gigantic,

363
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:22,650
but you're still a little kitten
on the inside, aren't you?

364
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:24,608
Well, you sure have a
pretty big mouth on you

365
00:18:24,692 --> 00:18:26,858
for someone who's still
kitten-sized all over, y'know!

366
00:18:26,942 --> 00:18:27,942
Excuse me?

367
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:28,900
[COCONUT]
You heard me, shortcake!

368
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,400
[AZUKI]
I am not that small!

369
00:18:30,483 --> 00:18:32,983
[SHIGURE]
Hey, hey! Settle down, you two.

370
00:18:33,067 --> 00:18:34,817
Let's get the bath ready,
so you can go to bed.

371
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,525
[GROUP]
Okay.

372
00:18:36,608 --> 00:18:39,858
Great! How 'bout you come
bathe with me, little one?

373
00:18:39,942 --> 00:18:41,525
[KITTEN]
Mm...

374
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,400
[SHIGURE]
You had a big day, didn't you?

375
00:18:50,483 --> 00:18:53,150
I bet it'll feel refreshing
to be squeaky clean!

376
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:54,067
Huh?

377
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,067
[SHIGURE]
I wonder how long

378
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,983
she's been wearing
those clothes.

379
00:18:57,067 --> 00:19:00,692
They look pretty dirty
and kinda beaten up.

380
00:19:00,775 --> 00:19:01,692
Oh, I got it!

381
00:19:01,775 --> 00:19:02,942
I think I have some old clothes

382
00:19:03,025 --> 00:19:05,442
that the other cats wore
when they were small.

383
00:19:05,525 --> 00:19:08,442
I'll find some for
you to wear tomorrow.

384
00:19:08,525 --> 00:19:09,817
Here we go.

385
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,317
Let's start with the shampoo!

386
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,858
[KITTEN hissing]

387
00:19:13,942 --> 00:19:15,233
Oh, uh.

388
00:19:15,317 --> 00:19:17,525
Guess you're not a big fan
of the shower, are you?

389
00:19:17,608 --> 00:19:19,942
Don't worry,
I promise it won't hurt!

390
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:23,983
Just relax and stay calm.
I promise you'll get used to it!

391
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,692
Oh, wow. Your hair has gotten
pretty matted under that hat.

392
00:19:29,775 --> 00:19:32,692
No worries, let's lather
it up and make it shine!

393
00:19:32,775 --> 00:19:33,983
And of course,

394
00:19:34,067 --> 00:19:36,900
can't forget to clean your tail!

395
00:19:36,983 --> 00:19:40,233
'Kay! Just one more
rinse and then we're done.

396
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:48,150
[SHIGURE humming]

397
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,775
Those are my pajamas from
when I was about your size.

398
00:19:54,858 --> 00:19:57,358
They're not quite small
enough for you though.

399
00:19:57,442 --> 00:20:00,317
But still, you're so cute!

400
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,400
Ahh! That post-shampoo smell

401
00:20:02,483 --> 00:20:06,108
and your fluffy, minty hair are
too adorable. I can't handle it!

402
00:20:06,192 --> 00:20:08,108
Oh! [giggles]

403
00:20:08,192 --> 00:20:10,817
Oh! Sorry, I got
a little carried away!

404
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,692
You must be worn
out by now, huh?

405
00:20:12,775 --> 00:20:15,650
Give me one second and
I'll get us all tucked in.

406
00:20:15,733 --> 00:20:19,858
[sniffing]

407
00:20:19,942 --> 00:20:22,483
[SHIGURE]
There we go! Perfect.

408
00:20:22,567 --> 00:20:24,858
Ready? Come lie down!

409
00:20:29,608 --> 00:20:31,025
Uh...

410
00:20:38,067 --> 00:20:40,650
Looks like the mat's
more comfortable for you.

411
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:45,442
But... just to make sure
you don't catch a cold,

412
00:20:45,525 --> 00:20:47,317
let's get you a blanket.

413
00:20:49,025 --> 00:20:50,692
[SHIGURE]
Oh.

414
00:20:50,775 --> 00:20:52,525
Poor thing must have
been really exhausted

415
00:20:52,608 --> 00:20:54,692
if she's already
out like a light.

416
00:20:57,733 --> 00:21:00,567
Sweet dreams.
See you in the morning.

417
00:21:03,775 --> 00:21:06,067
[CHOCOLA] Do you think
she's fallen asleep already?

418
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,275
[VANILLA]
You worried about her?

419
00:21:07,358 --> 00:21:10,692
Well, Chocola hopes
that she's behaving well

420
00:21:10,775 --> 00:21:12,067
at the other house.

421
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:15,317
I'm sure she's getting
along just fine with everybody.

422
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,692
Yeah.

423
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:22,858
So what are you
thinking about, Vanilla?

424
00:21:22,942 --> 00:21:26,358
That I'll always
be here with you.

425
00:21:26,442 --> 00:21:28,900
You promise?

426
00:21:28,983 --> 00:21:32,650
Hey, that's just
a little too much.

427
00:21:32,733 --> 00:21:34,900
[CHOCOLA] I guess we
should get to sleep now.

428
00:21:34,983 --> 00:21:36,192
[VANILLA]
Yes.

429
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:39,025
Sleep well, Vanilla.

430
00:21:39,108 --> 00:21:41,900
Have sweet dreams, Chocola.
