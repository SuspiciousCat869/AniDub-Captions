00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,733
Thank you, please come again!

163
00:09:01,817 --> 00:09:04,317
Don't you think Azuki
is just ameowzing?

164
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,108
She's the eldest cat
of the Minaduki family,

165
00:09:07,192 --> 00:09:10,358
so of course she's
very competent.

166
00:09:10,442 --> 00:09:12,983
[AZUKI] Sheesh. When
it comes to this shop,

167
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:14,900
there's just no
rest for the weary.

168
00:09:14,983 --> 00:09:17,317
Azuki? I finished
refilling the to-go boxes

169
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,608
like you asked me to.

170
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:20,608
Ah. Thanks a bunch.

171
00:09:20,692 --> 00:09:22,358
Things seem to've
slowed down a little.

172
00:09:22,442 --> 00:09:24,400
Do you need help with
anything back here?

173
00:09:24,483 --> 00:09:28,150
Not really, I think I've got a
pretty good handle on all of it.

174
00:09:29,483 --> 00:09:31,983
And besides, you're still
just a growing kitten.

175
00:09:32,067 --> 00:09:34,358
It's important not
to stretch yourself thin.

176
00:09:34,442 --> 00:09:38,192
Heh... Except I'm not
the one stretching, am I?

177
00:09:38,275 --> 00:09:40,067
Need some help
with that, squirt?

178
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,942
[AZUKI gasps]
No! That's okay!

179
00:09:43,025 --> 00:09:44,358
[COCONUT]
Oh, come on.

180
00:09:44,442 --> 00:09:47,108
Life's too short not to
ask for a little help, right?

181
00:09:47,192 --> 00:09:50,483
Excuse you? Jerk!

182
00:09:50,567 --> 00:09:54,608
Heh. Aw, you having a small
problem reaching me, Azuki?

183
00:09:54,692 --> 00:09:58,067
[AZUKI growls, yells]

184
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,692
[VANILLA, CHOCOLA gasp]

185
00:09:59,775 --> 00:10:01,067
[COCONUT]
Punch harder!

186
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:04,608
For those two, this is
just business as usual.

187
00:10:04,692 --> 00:10:06,608
Don't worry.

188
00:10:06,692 --> 00:10:10,400
On today's feature, we're
checking out a popular aquarium!

189
00:10:10,483 --> 00:10:13,317
Follow me inside
as we take a closer look.

190
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,233
Wow! Isn't it beautiful?

191
00:10:16,317 --> 00:10:17,983
[rumbling]

192
00:10:18,067 --> 00:10:20,150
Oh, my, sounds like
you're hungry.

193
00:10:20,233 --> 00:10:21,608
Nice timing!

194
00:10:21,692 --> 00:10:23,858
It's three o'clock,
so let's have tea.

195
00:10:26,983 --> 00:10:31,483
Wow. You're pretty serious
about this stuff, aren't you?

196
00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:34,150
Her first time having
tea should be perfect,

197
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:37,192
otherwise she won't
learn how to appreciate it.

198
00:10:37,275 --> 00:10:38,733
Oh, that makes sense.

199
00:10:38,817 --> 00:10:40,233
Well, in that case,
let's dig in--

200
00:10:40,317 --> 00:10:42,567
Wait, hold on a minute!

201
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:45,483
Darjeeling is one of the
three great teas of the world.

202
00:10:45,567 --> 00:10:47,817
It's best for drinking straight.

203
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,692
Assam is good with milk.

204
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:51,858
And last but not least,
this one is Earl Grey.

205
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:55,483
Uhh, I'm sorry, but
what are you doing?

206
00:10:55,567 --> 00:10:58,025
I said the first time
needs to be perfect,

207
00:10:58,108 --> 00:11:01,483
so I'm enrolling her into
my elite tea training program!

208
00:11:01,567 --> 00:11:04,025
Okay. In order to
make delicious tea,

209
00:11:04,108 --> 00:11:06,650
it is important to mind
the water temperature.

210
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:09,650
The first thing you do is boil
fresh water at 100 degrees,

211
00:11:09,733 --> 00:11:11,775
then pre-pour some
hot water into the cups

212
00:11:11,858 --> 00:11:13,192
and pots to warm them up.

213
00:11:13,275 --> 00:11:15,400
Then you put in the tea leaves,
add the boiled water,

214
00:11:15,483 --> 00:11:17,858
and let it steep for a moment.

215
00:11:17,942 --> 00:11:20,483
Take care not to let the
temperature drop too much.

216
00:11:20,567 --> 00:11:23,608
There! And that is your
first lesson in tea!

217
00:11:25,358 --> 00:11:26,858
She's gone?

218
00:11:43,025 --> 00:11:46,442
[CINNAMON] Aha. This is
where you disappeared to.

219
00:11:46,525 --> 00:11:51,275
What? You prefer that over
my tea party? Seriously?

220
00:11:51,358 --> 00:11:52,983
Now, now, different cats

221
00:11:53,067 --> 00:11:55,692
just prefer different
things, that's all.

222
00:11:59,442 --> 00:12:02,150
Ohh, she likes it!
Isn't that wonderful?

223
00:12:02,233 --> 00:12:04,858
Whatever makes
her happy, I guess.

224
00:12:09,025 --> 00:12:10,983
[CHOCOLA]
You like it?

225
00:12:11,067 --> 00:12:12,442
[KITTEN]
Mm-hm.

226
00:12:12,525 --> 00:12:16,192
[CHOCOLA] Perfect!
Eat as much as you like.

227
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:21,692
Are you already full?

228
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:23,775
I'm not surprised you
love that snack so much.

229
00:12:23,858 --> 00:12:25,900
They're super high quality.

230
00:12:28,483 --> 00:12:29,900
[BOTH]
Hmm?

231
00:12:31,275 --> 00:12:33,650
[MAPLE] "A long time
ago in a land far away,

232
00:12:33,733 --> 00:12:36,067
an old man and
woman lived together.

233
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:38,067
The woman left home one day."

234
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,150
[CINNAMON]
Hi, Mama Bear, I'm home.

235
00:12:40,233 --> 00:12:42,233
Welcome home, Papa Bear.

236
00:12:42,317 --> 00:12:45,733
What would you like to do first,
have dinner or take a bath?

237
00:12:45,817 --> 00:12:47,483
Or something else?

238
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:49,983
Like bathe me?

239
00:12:50,067 --> 00:12:51,358
Here, give it a try.

240
00:12:51,442 --> 00:12:53,317
Yeah, come on, it's easy!

241
00:13:01,025 --> 00:13:03,233
Like this, see?
Pretty cool, huh?

242
00:13:03,317 --> 00:13:05,317
Not to mention fun!

243
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,233
[BOTH gasp, groan]

244
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:15,817
Should I even bother asking
what you two are doing?

245
00:13:17,525 --> 00:13:19,733
Well, the kitten seemed
like she was lonely.

246
00:13:19,817 --> 00:13:22,192
We thought she might
want to play, so...

247
00:13:22,275 --> 00:13:26,108
Yeah, but... nothing seems
to pique her interest.

248
00:13:27,275 --> 00:13:30,608
[SHIGURE] I think we
should just leave her be.

249
00:13:30,692 --> 00:13:32,983
It's possible that the thing
she needs most right now

250
00:13:33,067 --> 00:13:35,483
is a little bit
of time to herself.

251
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:46,775
[SHIGURE]
These are some toys that

252
00:13:46,858 --> 00:13:49,567
the Minaduki cats have
enjoyed over the years.

253
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:52,400
Feel free to play with
whatever ones you like.

254
00:14:00,192 --> 00:14:02,150
Oh! That's an old favorite.

255
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:04,025
In fact, Chocola played
with it all the time

256
00:14:04,108 --> 00:14:05,692
when she was smaller.

257
00:14:29,358 --> 00:14:31,983
[CHOCOLA]
Thank you! Come visit us again!

258
00:14:32,067 --> 00:14:34,275

We appreciate your business.

Good work out there today.

If it's okay with you,
we're gonna take off soon.

00:14:40,358 --> 00:14:43,442
[gasps] Hey, Azuki? Um...

263
00:14:43,525 --> 00:14:45,567
Yeah? You need something?

264
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:51,108
Well, uh, it's nothing much.

Never mind,
but thank you. [laughs]

266

[AZUKI]
Hmm...

00:14:57,733 --> 00:15:00,567
Yeah. Chocola's positive
that everything is hunky-dory!

00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,150

Huh? Where's Sugarcane?

272
00:15:11,942 --> 00:15:15,150
Sheesh. Now, Azuki,
what did I tell you about giving

273
00:15:15,233 --> 00:15:17,775
the kitten a name
without her permission?

274
00:15:17,858 --> 00:15:19,942
Speaking of, could you
two please go get her?

275
00:15:20,025 --> 00:15:21,192
Dinner's almost ready.

276
00:15:21,275 --> 00:15:22,817
[MAPLE, CINNAMON]
Sure.

277
00:15:26,275 --> 00:15:27,775
[MAPLE]
She's gone?

278
00:15:35,317 --> 00:15:36,567
How odd.

279
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,442
[COCONUT]
I can't find her anywhere.

280
00:15:38,525 --> 00:15:40,108
Maybe she's not
in the house at all.

281
00:15:40,192 --> 00:15:41,900
Perhaps she's outside.

282

Let's all go look together.

Hey! Sugarcane!

Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

285
00:15:51,275 --> 00:15:53,817
It's dinner time, kitty!

286
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,525
Come on, where are you?

287
00:15:56,608 --> 00:16:00,567
I guess I have no choice.
These are desperate times.

288
00:16:02,067 --> 00:16:04,442
[COCONUT]
She can't resist catnip!

The shop is still open, you
can't run off whenever you like.

I have to leave. It's the
kitten--she's gone missing!

[KASHOU, VANILLA gasp]

307
00:16:51,942 --> 00:16:54,983
They searched everywhere,
but she wasn't inside the house.

308
00:16:55,067 --> 00:16:57,817
Her shoes are gone,
so she must have gone outside.

309
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,067
Which means we should...

310
00:17:01,108 --> 00:17:03,400
Right. Understood.

311
00:17:03,483 --> 00:17:05,567
I can stay and
handle things here.

312
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,233
There's no time to waste,
you should go and look for her.

Wait, you're sure
it's okay? But you said...

It's no problem, don't worry.
We'll be just fine here.

Trust me, I can handle
things until you get back.

00:17:22,483 --> 00:17:24,317
Thank you so much, Vanilla!

319
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,400
And you, too, Master,
Chocola will hurry!

320
00:17:33,317 --> 00:17:35,400
Where are you?

321
00:17:39,567 --> 00:17:43,525
Answer me! Tell Chocola
where you are!

[AZUKI]
Sugarcane!

00:17:46,442 --> 00:17:48,317
[COCONUT]
Where'd you run off to?

324
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,567
You check over there
and I'll head this way.

325
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,567
We'll find her. Now move!

326
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:54,942
I'm on it!

327
00:17:58,483 --> 00:18:00,817
Hey! Hold up!

328
00:18:02,192 --> 00:18:03,567
Huh?

329
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:06,692
Oopsies, wrong kitten!

330
00:18:06,775 --> 00:18:09,317
Please forgive Chocola!

331
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,150
[CINNAMON] Excuse me, but
have you seen a small kitten?

332
00:18:13,233 --> 00:18:14,733
No.

333
00:18:14,817 --> 00:18:17,275
[MAPLE] She's wearing
a hat, 'bout this tall.

334
00:18:17,358 --> 00:18:19,108
[MAN 03A]
No, sorry.

335
00:18:22,608 --> 00:18:25,275
[CHOCOLA] What if she's
lonely all by herself?

336
00:18:26,733 --> 00:18:30,692
[CHOCOLA] What if she's scared
and doesn't know what to do?

337
00:18:30,775 --> 00:18:32,192
What if she's crying right now?

[WOMAN 03B gasps]

340
00:18:39,275 --> 00:18:42,233
No! Chocola has to find her!

341
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,817
[CHOCOLA]
Not here.

342
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:15,525
Chocola thought that the kitten
might come back to this place.

343
00:19:16,567 --> 00:19:18,942
Where did you run off to?

344
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:19,858
[KITTEN]
Here.

[gasps] It's you!

00:19:32,567 --> 00:19:37,525
[CHOCOLA laughs, crying]

348
00:19:39,608 --> 00:19:43,358
But why? Why did you disappear
on everyone like that?

349
00:19:43,442 --> 00:19:47,567
You scared them and Chocola.
You scared everyone!

350
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:52,317
[CHOCOLA cries]

351
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:55,400
With you.

[CHOCOLA]
Huh?

353
00:19:58,275 --> 00:20:01,067
I wanna stay with you.

[chattering]

355

[door opens, bell chimes]

356
00:20:19,525 --> 00:20:20,775
Oh, wow, you found her!

357
00:20:20,858 --> 00:20:23,733
You scoundrel!
You had us all worried sick.

358
00:20:23,817 --> 00:20:27,233
Well, all that matters is
that you're back safe and sound.

359
00:20:27,317 --> 00:20:29,442
It's such a relief.

360
00:20:31,608 --> 00:20:33,317
It's late. We've
had a long night,

361
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,900
so it's time for
us to head home.

Mm. Hold on, I have a request.

Yes? Go on.

[CHOCOLA]
About the kitten...

365
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,858
If you must, you can cut
Chocola's food in half.

366
00:20:46,942 --> 00:20:49,358
And Chocola will
dress and bathe her.

367
00:20:49,442 --> 00:20:51,025
And she'll potty train her!

368
00:20:51,108 --> 00:20:54,567
If the kitten gets in trouble,
you may scold Chocola!

369
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:57,817
So, please, please...

370
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,567
Please let the kitten
stay with us!

Chocola is begging you!

Master.

373
00:21:08,858 --> 00:21:11,858
If this is what Chocola wants,
then I will back her up.

00:21:11,942 --> 00:21:13,025
I'll beg, as well.

So, please.

You know what's funny?

377

I don't ever remember
telling you guys

that she couldn't stay here.

Wait, does that mean...?

380
00:21:24,108 --> 00:21:27,400
Yes, but only if you
take good care of her.

381
00:21:27,483 --> 00:21:30,567
There's only two of you
here, so what's one more?

Oh, thank you!
This is great news!

Now we can live
together forever!
