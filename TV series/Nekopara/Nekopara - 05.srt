[CHOCOLA, VANILLA]
Thank you very much!

2
00:00:11,775 --> 00:00:13,983
We hope that you'll
visit us again soon.

00:00:14,067 --> 00:00:17,067
[door opens, closes]

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,025
Ahh! Did you see how
hard Chocola worked today?

5
00:00:20,108 --> 00:00:23,150
Business wasn't very heavy,
but it wasn't slow either.

6
00:00:23,233 --> 00:00:26,150
We both worked moderately hard.

7
00:00:26,233 --> 00:00:28,150
[CHOCOLA] Boy, dinner
can't come fast enough.

8
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:30,150
Chocola's starving!

10
00:00:33,983 --> 00:00:37,067
[VANILLA] What's up with
the sudden stop? Huh?

11
00:00:39,192 --> 00:00:40,692
[VANILLA]
Cacao?

12
00:00:42,233 --> 00:00:44,983
Aw, were you waiting
to welcome us back?

13
00:00:45,067 --> 00:00:46,358
[CACAO]
Mm.

14
00:00:46,442 --> 00:00:47,692
[BOTH gasp]

15
00:00:51,692 --> 00:00:54,900
Thanks, Cacao,
that's very sweet.

16
00:00:54,983 --> 00:00:59,067
Chocola, don't be so greedy,
I want to give her love, too.

17
00:01:05,108 --> 00:01:07,483
[CHOCOLA giggles]
This sort of reminds Chocola--

18
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,733
we used to wait like this for
the master to get back home,

19
00:01:09,817 --> 00:01:11,567
when we were little kittens.

20
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,650
Then maybe we should wait to
welcome him home again today.

21
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:17,150
I bet he'll even
pat us on the head.

22
00:01:17,233 --> 00:01:19,608
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Great idea!

23
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,483
[sighs] Boy, am I exhausted.

24
00:01:26,275 --> 00:01:27,650
Uh?

25
00:01:27,733 --> 00:01:29,275
[CHOCOLA, VANILLA]
Welcome home, Master!

26
00:01:29,358 --> 00:01:31,192
--[CHOCOLA] Great work today!
--[VANILLA] Great work!

27
00:01:31,275 --> 00:01:34,192
Yeah. Good to be
back. Thank you.

28
00:01:34,275 --> 00:01:35,358
[KASHOU sighs]

29
00:01:39,525 --> 00:01:42,192
Uh, Master?
Not even one head pat?

30
00:01:42,275 --> 00:01:44,858
That was a rather
cold reception.

31
00:01:46,942 --> 00:01:48,025
Uh.

32
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,900
[CHOCOLA gasps]
It looks so yummy!

33
00:03:22,983 --> 00:03:24,275
--I'll have some now.
--Chocola will have some now.

34
00:03:24,358 --> 00:03:25,775
[BOTH]
Thanks.

35
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,192
Wow, Master, everything you made

36
00:03:35,275 --> 00:03:37,692
for dinner tonight
is really delicious!

37
00:03:38,692 --> 00:03:39,983
Good to hear.

38
00:03:41,525 --> 00:03:42,858
[CHOCOLA]
Know what else?

39
00:03:42,942 --> 00:03:46,567
Chocola noticed that you
made the rice extra fluffy!

40
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:47,608
[KASHOU]
Uh-huh.

41
00:03:47,692 --> 00:03:49,400
Today was really busy.

42
00:03:49,483 --> 00:03:53,358
But Chocola worked super hard
and served all the customers!

43
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,067
Cool.

44
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,525
[CHOCOLA grunts]

45
00:03:57,608 --> 00:04:00,900
Chocola, Master is trying
to eat so please be quiet.

46
00:04:00,983 --> 00:04:03,317
Fine.

47
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,817
[KASHOU]
I think I'm full.

48
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,108
Oh, but you barely ate.

49
00:04:14,567 --> 00:04:15,983
Dinner was so weird.

50
00:04:16,067 --> 00:04:17,358
Master barely touched his food

51
00:04:17,442 --> 00:04:19,358
and worse he barely
spoke to Chocola!

52
00:04:19,442 --> 00:04:21,067
He might just have
a lot on his mind,

53
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,442
like maybe there's problem
with the shop, you know?

54
00:04:23,525 --> 00:04:25,650
No way, do you
really think that's it?

55
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:26,858
Listen up.

56
00:04:26,942 --> 00:04:28,483
If there is anything
you want to confess,

57
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:30,692
then now would be the
most appropriate time.

58
00:04:30,775 --> 00:04:32,483
Besides, if you turn
yourself in now,

59
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:35,025
then I'm sure your
punishment will be lighter.

60
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,525
Are you serious, nya?

61
00:04:38,942 --> 00:04:41,567
Well, there's a
slight possibility

62
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,858
that the other day
when nobody was looking,

63
00:04:43,942 --> 00:04:46,233
Chocola took the
teeniest little taste

64
00:04:46,317 --> 00:04:48,233
of the whipped cream.

65
00:04:48,317 --> 00:04:52,025
And maybe while Chocola
was carrying lots of plates...

66
00:04:52,108 --> 00:04:55,733
...she might have tripped
and broke one or two.

67
00:04:55,817 --> 00:04:58,567
You think Master
knows about Chocola?

68
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,275
[VANILLA] Sounds like you've
been a very naughty kitty.

69
00:05:01,358 --> 00:05:02,483
--[CHOCOLA yelling]

70
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:03,733
--It's time for noogies.
--[CHOCOLA yelling]

71
00:05:03,817 --> 00:05:05,858
Beware the noogie.

72
00:05:05,942 --> 00:05:07,275
The noogie monster attacks.

73
00:05:07,358 --> 00:05:08,858
[CHOCOLA] Chocola promises
she'll never do it again,

74
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:11,483
so stop torturing her, Vanilla!

75
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:13,067
Well, all things considered,

76
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,358
even if we ignore
your evil deeds...

77
00:05:15,442 --> 00:05:16,942
You punished me!

78
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:20,358
...when I really think about it,
Master seemed worried.

79
00:05:20,442 --> 00:05:22,567
Huh? What do you
think it was about?

80
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,692
Maybe he ate a bad
fish or something.

81
00:05:24,775 --> 00:05:27,525
I highly doubt that's the issue.

82
00:05:27,608 --> 00:05:30,608
You see, when I went
into the kitchen earlier...

83
00:05:31,858 --> 00:05:33,192
[gasps]

84
00:05:33,275 --> 00:05:36,858
[KASHOU] It's just not
working out! What should I do?

85
00:05:38,775 --> 00:05:40,400
So what do you think it means?

86
00:05:40,483 --> 00:05:41,650
It's just a hunch,

87
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:44,442
but I suspect he may be
struggling financially.

88
00:05:44,525 --> 00:05:47,150
The shop did have fewer
customers than usual.

89
00:05:47,233 --> 00:05:49,442
What will we do if he
continues to struggle?

90
00:05:49,525 --> 00:05:52,275
We'll have to save money
by rationing our food.

91
00:05:52,358 --> 00:05:56,025
[CHOCOLA gasps]
Ration our food?

92
00:05:56,108 --> 00:05:58,775
So we'll only get a
single dried fish a day?

93
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,775
[rumbling]

94
00:06:00,858 --> 00:06:04,275
But Chocola will
starve! She'll die!

95
00:06:04,358 --> 00:06:05,858
[VANILLA]
It'll be fine.

96
00:06:05,942 --> 00:06:08,483
There's nothing for you
to worry about, okay?

97
00:06:08,567 --> 00:06:10,567
If we just solve
Master's problem for him,

98
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,692
he won't have to be
sad anymore, right?

99
00:06:12,775 --> 00:06:14,733
[CHOCOLA]
Mm-mm. Great idea!

100
00:06:14,817 --> 00:06:17,733
We have to do whatever
we can to help our master!

101
00:06:21,192 --> 00:06:23,192
[VANILLA] If we want to
bring in more business,

102
00:06:23,275 --> 00:06:25,608
then we need to let
people know we exist first.

103
00:06:25,692 --> 00:06:28,067
Okay, then we'll hand
out a ton of shop cards!

104
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,067
Yeah!

105
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,275
[CACAO]
Hm?

106
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:32,317
Oh, I forgot.

107
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,025
You've probably
never seen anything

108
00:06:34,108 --> 00:06:37,233
like shop cards before,
have you, Cacao?

109
00:06:37,317 --> 00:06:41,608
Check it out, it has the name of
our patisserie on it and a map.

110
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:43,775
If we hand these out
to the people passing by,

111
00:06:43,858 --> 00:06:45,025
then they'll know
where our shop is

112
00:06:45,108 --> 00:06:47,067
when they want
to come buy a cake.

113
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,858
Then we won't have
to ration our food.

There's no doubt about it.

We might have to
take drastic measures.

[CINNAMON gasps]
Uh, what do you mean by drastic?

Are you talking about...

...stripping down in front of a
crowd for money or something?

00:19:32,275 --> 00:19:34,150
Oh. You see...

323
00:19:34,233 --> 00:19:36,233
Well, it's actually
a great story.

324
00:19:36,317 --> 00:19:37,733
We wanted to bring
in more business

325
00:19:37,817 --> 00:19:40,775
for the café, so, you know...

326
00:19:40,858 --> 00:19:43,775
[KASHOU] So that's what's
been going on today.

327
00:19:43,858 --> 00:19:45,567
I'm not worried
about business at all.

328
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,650
In fact, our sales have
been perfectly fine.

329
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:48,525
[CHOCOLA, VANILLA gasp]

330
00:19:48,608 --> 00:19:51,067
See for yourself.

331
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,858
I couldn't come up with a new
cake for the summer season.

332
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:56,942
That's what's been
on my mind lately.

333
00:19:57,025 --> 00:19:59,067
So we won't have
to ration our food?

334
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:02,067
I see. We jumped to conclusions.

335
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,733
[KASHOU] We're a patisserie,
not a maid café.

336
00:20:04,817 --> 00:20:06,567
Please don't do
those things again.

337
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,483
[CHOCOLA, VANILLA]
Okay.

338
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:12,733
But... I appreciate you working
hard to bring in more business.

339
00:20:12,817 --> 00:20:13,900
And because of you guys,

340
00:20:13,983 --> 00:20:16,858
I was able to think
of a new cake idea.

341
00:20:16,942 --> 00:20:20,400
Thank you, Chocola...
and Vanilla.

342
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,317
You're welcome, master!

343
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,108
You're welcome.

344
00:20:25,192 --> 00:20:26,358
Cacao, huh?

345
00:20:26,442 --> 00:20:28,275
That's right, have you
seen her around today?

346
00:20:28,358 --> 00:20:30,150
I don't know.
We've been pretty busy

347
00:20:30,233 --> 00:20:32,317
so it's hard to say
if I've seen her or not.

348
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,358
Hey, Nuts. Do you
think it's possible that

349
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:36,567
we actually saw her out
on the streets, then?

350
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,108
Don't be silly.

351
00:20:38,192 --> 00:20:40,650
[VANILLA] Hold on,
you think you saw her earlier?

352
00:20:40,733 --> 00:20:41,817
Where was she?

353
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,775
She was by the
apartment complex.

354
00:20:43,858 --> 00:20:46,608
This is terrible.
What if Cacao got lost again?

355
00:20:46,692 --> 00:20:48,108
We have to find her.

356
00:20:48,192 --> 00:20:48,942
[KASHOU]
Wait a moment.

357
00:20:49,025 --> 00:20:50,608
[BOTH gasp]

358
00:20:50,692 --> 00:20:52,025
What is it, Master?

359
00:20:52,108 --> 00:20:54,525
Shouldn't Cacao be waiting
for us back at home?

360
00:20:54,608 --> 00:20:58,150
Yeah. Well, she's
supposed to be.

361
00:20:58,233 --> 00:20:59,858
Are you here, Cacao?

362
00:20:59,942 --> 00:21:00,775
Hello?

363
00:21:00,858 --> 00:21:02,275
[VANILLA]
No luck.

364
00:21:02,358 --> 00:21:03,650
Check the living room.

365
00:21:03,733 --> 00:21:05,067
Good idea.

366
00:21:06,692 --> 00:21:08,608
--[KASHOU] Uh...
--[CHOCOLA, VANILLA grunt]

367
00:21:08,692 --> 00:21:09,733
Master!

368
00:21:09,817 --> 00:21:12,858
Hey, can you warn
us before stopping?

369
00:21:12,942 --> 00:21:13,817
Cacao!

370
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,067
So she was in here.

371
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,275
[KASHOU] I suppose you
were waiting to greet us, huh?

372
00:21:18,358 --> 00:21:19,817
That's so sweet.

373
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:24,192
Thank goodness,
Chocola was worried!

374
00:21:24,275 --> 00:21:26,400
You freak out about everything.

375
00:21:26,483 --> 00:21:28,400
[CHOCOLA]
Chocola was not freaking out!

376
00:21:28,483 --> 00:21:32,108
Besides, Vanilla,
you were worried, too!

377
00:21:32,192 --> 00:21:34,900
She got home. Thank goodness.

378
00:21:37,192 --> 00:21:40,233
You're so cute.
Want Chocola to entertain you?

379
00:21:40,317 --> 00:21:43,150
We all know she'll likely
end up entertaining you.

380
00:21:43,233 --> 00:21:44,900
