Here are your pajamas

And don't forget... your
toothbrush and toothpaste.

I also have a hot water
bottle and a body warmer

just in case it gets cold.

42
00:03:32,858 --> 00:03:35,567
You should pack an alarm clock
so you don't oversleep.

00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,650
And your bath set is good to go.

She's only spending one night
and she'll be back in no time.

She doesn't need

she was ready for anything!

Fon-cat Choco-meows.

160
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:55,858
We'll have those three
Fondant au Chocolats

161
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,942
right out for you, miss.

162
00:07:58,025 --> 00:08:00,358
Vanilla! That's too many!

163
00:08:00,442 --> 00:08:03,817
Yes. Sorry, I must
be distracted.

164
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,317
[CHOCOLA] Please excuse
us! We'll repack them!

165
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,275
Do you think
those two are okay?

166
00:08:08,358 --> 00:08:10,483
I think they're just
concerned about Cacao.

167
00:08:10,567 --> 00:08:12,358
Yeah. That's really sweet.

168
00:08:12,442 --> 00:08:14,733
They're basically
still kittens, too.

169
00:08:14,817 --> 00:08:16,817
[CHIYO laughs]

170
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,733
Come on, Cacao,
you can make that jump!

171
00:08:19,817 --> 00:08:20,650
Wah!

172
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,942
--[CACAO gasps]
--[CHIYO laughs]

173
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:25,942
What's it gonna be, Cacao?

174
00:08:26,025 --> 00:08:27,942
A shark or something?

175
00:08:28,025 --> 00:08:28,983
It's a fish.

176
00:08:29,067 --> 00:08:31,775
[CHIYO]
I see. So cute.

177
00:08:35,025 --> 00:08:36,692
[CHOCOLA]
Do you need help with anything?

178
00:08:36,775 --> 00:08:38,692
Yes, please. Would you
mind getting the bowls?

179
00:08:38,775 --> 00:08:40,650
[CHOCOLA]
Okay.

180
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:43,025
Let's set the table.

181
00:08:48,442 --> 00:08:50,692
[KASHOU]
Hm? Something wrong?

182
00:08:50,775 --> 00:08:51,900
[CHOCOLA]
Uh, nope!

183
00:08:51,983 --> 00:08:54,150
It's nothing, Master,
everything is fine!

184
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:57,150
[VANILLA grunts, gasps]

185
00:08:57,233 --> 00:08:59,317
I forgot that Cacao isn't here.

186
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,358
I hope you two are
ready for dinner!

187
00:09:01,442 --> 00:09:04,108
I made soy
sauce-boiled dried fish!

188
00:09:04,192 --> 00:09:08,400
[whimpers] Chocola knows how
much Cacao loves dried fish.

189
00:09:08,483 --> 00:09:11,442
How can you expect us to eat her
favorite food without her?

190
00:09:11,525 --> 00:09:12,983
She's not wrong.

191
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:15,275
If it's not too much trouble,
I'd like to save this meal.

192
00:09:15,358 --> 00:09:17,400
Then we can eat it
when Cacao comes home.

193
00:09:17,483 --> 00:09:20,983
[KASHOU]
Uh... Sure. Okay.

194
00:09:23,192 --> 00:09:27,108
[CHIYO] Mm! Mom's meatloaf
is always super good!

195
00:09:29,692 --> 00:09:31,150
Great job, Cacao!

196
00:09:31,233 --> 00:09:33,608
You really did a number
on your vegetables!

197
00:09:33,692 --> 00:09:35,525
I'm so glad!

198
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:36,775
[CHIYO]
Mm.

199
00:09:38,233 --> 00:09:41,858
[CHIYO grunts] Well I'm gonna
eat all my veggies, too!

200
00:09:41,942 --> 00:09:44,233
[CHIYO'S MOTHER giggles]

201
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,358
[CHIYO]
Check this out.

202
00:09:46,442 --> 00:09:48,275
Now we can take a bath together!

203
00:09:48,358 --> 00:09:49,233
[CACAO grunts]

204
00:09:49,317 --> 00:09:50,900
[CHIYO]
What do ya say?

205
00:09:50,983 --> 00:09:52,400
[CACAO grunts]

206
00:09:52,483 --> 00:09:53,817
Hey, are you okay?

207
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,233
Are you afraid of
being in the water?

208
00:09:57,317 --> 00:09:59,025
Yeah, I guess so.

209
00:09:59,108 --> 00:10:01,025
Wait! I know!

210
00:10:02,942 --> 00:10:06,233
Look! I found all these
toys! So it'll be fun.

211
00:10:06,317 --> 00:10:07,317
'Kay?

212
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,817
[CACAO]
Mm...

213
00:10:10,275 --> 00:10:12,942
Fine, then. Pew!

214
00:10:13,025 --> 00:10:15,150
[CACAO grunts]

215
00:10:20,275 --> 00:10:23,275
See, that wasn't so bad and
you were really brave, Cacao!

216
00:10:23,358 --> 00:10:26,317
Now, give this a shot
and see what you think!

217
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,025
[BOTH giggling]

218
00:10:30,108 --> 00:10:31,358
[CHIYO]
Hey!

219
00:10:31,442 --> 00:10:33,358
[CHIYO, CACAO giggling]

220
00:10:33,442 --> 00:10:36,942
[VANILLA]
How's that? Got enough shampoo?

221
00:10:37,025 --> 00:10:38,067
[CHOCOLA sighs]

222
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,442
Don't sigh.

223
00:10:39,525 --> 00:10:42,275
They say being negative
is supposed to be bad luck!

224
00:10:42,358 --> 00:10:44,108
Huh? Oh, right.

225
00:10:44,192 --> 00:10:46,525
[CHOCOLA sighs]

226
00:10:46,608 --> 00:10:48,233
[VANILLA]
Hm... [gasps]

227
00:10:48,317 --> 00:10:50,650
[CHOCOLA gasps]
Hey, stop that!

228
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,525
Hey! That really
tickles, Vanilla!

229
00:10:53,608 --> 00:10:56,233
But... Chocola can do that, too!

230
00:10:56,317 --> 00:11:00,733
[BOTH giggling]

231
00:11:00,817 --> 00:11:02,608
[BOTH sigh]

232
00:11:02,692 --> 00:11:05,817
A warm soak is nice
after a long day like this.

233
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,775
Huh? Chocola?

234
00:11:08,858 --> 00:11:12,775
The bath seems a lot
bigger than normal tonight.

235
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:18,233
No, it's still the same.

236
00:11:18,317 --> 00:11:20,358
Doesn't feel like it.

237
00:11:24,442 --> 00:11:25,900
There! All done.

238
00:11:26,983 --> 00:11:28,108
[CACAO gasps]

239
00:11:29,608 --> 00:11:32,442
Oh! That's my mom. I drew it.

240
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,150
You drew her?

241
00:11:34,233 --> 00:11:35,942
I wanted to make
something really special

242
00:11:36,025 --> 00:11:37,983
for her last Mother's Day.

243
00:11:38,067 --> 00:11:40,192
Mom always works
really hard for me,

244
00:11:40,275 --> 00:11:42,567
so I drew it to say thank you.

245
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,983
She loved it so much
that she framed it

246
00:11:45,067 --> 00:11:47,358
and then put it up on the wall!

247
00:11:50,817 --> 00:11:52,525
Hey, Vanilla?

248
00:11:52,608 --> 00:11:54,942
What's up? Are you okay?

249
00:11:55,025 --> 00:11:56,275
The bath was bad enough,

250
00:11:56,358 --> 00:12:00,483
but Chocola is sad that
the bed feels bigger, too.

251
00:12:03,442 --> 00:12:05,692
Yeah. It does, huh?

252
00:12:05,775 --> 00:12:08,942
We're so used to
Cacao being here now.

253
00:12:09,025 --> 00:12:11,442
So when you sounded
okay with it before,

254
00:12:11,525 --> 00:12:13,358
you were just fakin' it?

255
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:14,858
Well, I figured
if I could pretend

256
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,108
like everything was normal,

257
00:12:16,192 --> 00:12:19,483
maybe it would help
you not to be so upset.

258
00:12:19,567 --> 00:12:21,317
Thanks so much, Vanilla.

259
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,608
Huh? Don't mention it.

260
00:12:24,692 --> 00:12:28,608
[sighs] Chocola didn't
realize until now.

261
00:12:28,692 --> 00:12:30,025
Cacao coming to live with us

262
00:12:30,108 --> 00:12:32,900
and being around all the time
got normal really fast.

263
00:12:32,983 --> 00:12:34,567
Yes.

264
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,400
Chocola wants us
to share the bed again

265
00:12:36,483 --> 00:12:38,358
when Cacao comes home, okay?

266
00:12:38,442 --> 00:12:39,858
Of course.

267
00:12:39,942 --> 00:12:41,275
But for tonight,

268
00:12:41,358 --> 00:12:43,692
I have my sweet
Chocola all to myself.

269
00:12:43,775 --> 00:12:45,192
[CHOCOLA gasps]

270
00:12:45,275 --> 00:12:47,775
[CHOCOLA] Vanilla! You're
squeezing a little too tight.

271
00:12:47,858 --> 00:12:51,233
[VANILLA]
Sorry. Can't let go, good-night.

272
00:13:08,567 --> 00:13:10,275
[KASHOU]
Thank you for bringing her home.

273
00:13:10,358 --> 00:13:12,150
And thanks again for having her.

274
00:13:12,233 --> 00:13:14,442
It was our pleasure,
she was a delight.

275
00:13:14,525 --> 00:13:15,858
Please come over again!

276
00:13:15,942 --> 00:13:17,108
That was so fun!

277
00:13:17,192 --> 00:13:18,608
[CACAO]
Mm!

278
00:13:18,692 --> 00:13:21,817
[CHOCOLA, VANILLA]
Cacao! We're glad you're home!

00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,067
We're coming in.

What is this?

[VANILLA] What is that
box still doing here?

288

Do you think Cacao
is hiding inside it?

Hello?

290
00:13:47,983 --> 00:13:49,442
But why?!

291
00:13:49,525 --> 00:13:50,983
No way.

292
00:13:51,067 --> 00:13:53,317
Thank you, please come
back to see us soon!

293
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,983
A-ha! Guess she's about to start
her rebellious phase, then.

294
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:58,067
[VANILLA, CHOCOLA]
What is that?

295
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,442
You'll find out soon.

296
00:13:59,525 --> 00:14:02,692
Like, take Nuts for example.

[AZUKI]
Hey, I'm back.

298
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:07,900
Hi, big sis! Welcome home!

299
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,025
She was totally
respectful and sweet

300
00:14:11,108 --> 00:14:12,942
in her kitten days,
if you can imagine it.

301
00:14:13,025 --> 00:14:14,733
It's kinda hard to believe.

302
00:14:14,817 --> 00:14:17,275
I've never seen her do
anything like that.

303
00:14:17,358 --> 00:14:20,567
Yeah, now she's grown
past her rebellious phase.

304
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:23,983
And all that cuteness
is gone forever.

305
00:14:24,067 --> 00:14:25,275
[COCONUT]
Hmph.

306
00:14:25,358 --> 00:14:27,358
But sometimes that's
just a part of growing up

307
00:14:27,442 --> 00:14:28,983
and you gotta let it happen.

308
00:14:29,067 --> 00:14:31,525
Cacao's not gonna
love you any less.

309
00:14:31,608 --> 00:14:33,692
Just try to give her space.

310
00:14:33,775 --> 00:14:35,067
Does it have to be?

311
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,358
Can't we take care of her?

312
00:14:42,275 --> 00:14:44,567
[knocking]

313
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,233
Is it okay if we come in now?

314
00:14:46,317 --> 00:14:49,067
Even though we shouldn't have
to ask 'cause it's our room.

315
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,692
[rustling]

316
00:14:50,775 --> 00:14:53,233
[CHOCOLA] It sounds like she's
still doin' something in there.

317
00:14:53,317 --> 00:14:55,150
Then our mission, should
we choose to accept it,

318
00:14:55,233 --> 00:14:58,817
is to successfully engage
