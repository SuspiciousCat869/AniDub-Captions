A shop? What kind?

These fried noodles
are delicious!

Yeah and this
ramen's pretty tasty.

[SHIGURE] For a small
clubhouse, this is impressive.

Their menu has lots of variety.

327
00:17:25,108 --> 00:17:28,692
The location's not
the best, but...

328
00:17:28,775 --> 00:17:31,483
...I think their problem
is advertising.

329
00:17:31,567 --> 00:17:34,733
People would swarm this place
if they knew it was here.

I've got an idea.

To show our thanks,

we'll make this the most
popular place on the beach!

at the edge of the beach

wound up working.

we were only popular

It was! Those girls seemed
like really nice people,
