it to his destination?

The strawberry farm he's
visiting is pretty far away,

arrived there yet.

00:09:20,025 --> 00:09:22,650
This is no time to be sleeping!

161
00:09:22,733 --> 00:09:25,858
[MAPLE panting]

162
00:09:25,942 --> 00:09:27,025
[sighs]

163
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,733
[CINNAMON grunts]
Something wrong?

164
00:09:29,817 --> 00:09:31,525
Yes, this whole night is crazy!

165
00:09:31,608 --> 00:09:34,067
Didn't you see the ghastly
woman in the well, too?

166
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,733
[CINNAMON] My goodness,
that sounds terrifying.

167
00:09:36,817 --> 00:09:38,858
No joke, it scared
the life out of me.

168
00:09:38,942 --> 00:09:40,692
[gasps]

169
00:09:40,775 --> 00:09:44,233
[MAPLE screams]

170
00:09:46,192 --> 00:09:47,317
Whoa.

171
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,358
Awesome, that story
was super fun and scary!

172
00:09:50,442 --> 00:09:53,650
Yeah, it was a real blast.
A real thriller of tale.

173
00:09:53,733 --> 00:09:55,400
It was great! Right?

174
00:09:55,483 --> 00:09:57,317
[VANILLA]
Do you really think so?

175
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,775
[ALL gasp]

176
00:09:58,858 --> 00:10:01,108
[ALL whimper]

177
00:10:04,942 --> 00:10:06,692
I'm happy you all enjoyed it.

178
00:10:06,775 --> 00:10:08,942
[COCONUT]
What the--? How'd you do that?

179
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,025
[VANILLA]
It was a make-up trick.

180
00:10:11,108 --> 00:10:12,775
Come on, are you serious?

181
00:10:12,858 --> 00:10:15,025
Since when could make-up
remove your face?

182
00:10:15,108 --> 00:10:17,483
Well... time for the next story.

183
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:19,025
[MAPLE]
Let's do something else.

184
00:10:19,108 --> 00:10:22,275
Maple, I have to tell
at least 100 stories.

185
00:10:22,358 --> 00:10:24,733
Otherwise I won't be
able to summon the ghosts.

186
00:10:24,817 --> 00:10:27,608
Why would you even want to?!

187
00:10:27,692 --> 00:10:28,983
[COCONUT]
Hey, the power's back!

188
00:10:29,067 --> 00:10:32,817
[sighs] Could we maybe try
telling a happier story?

189
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,775
[CHOCOLA]
Then just leave it to Chocola!

190
00:10:35,858 --> 00:10:38,525
Get ready, because
this is a good one!

191
00:10:49,025 --> 00:10:51,942
[CHOCOLA] Once upon
a time, in a land far away,

192
00:10:52,025 --> 00:10:54,942
two close sisters
decided to go on a picnic.

193
00:10:55,025 --> 00:10:57,275
[VANILLA] Chocola and I
are the close sisters.

194
00:10:57,358 --> 00:10:58,567
I approve.

195
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:02,067
[CHOCOLA] But, the two
of them soon got lost.

196
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:05,317
They couldn't figure out
how to get back home.

197
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,442
--[CHOCOLA] Wow!
--[VANILLA] Ohh.

198
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:13,442
[CHOCOLA] Luckily, they
stumbled upon a huge house

199
00:11:13,525 --> 00:11:15,650
made entirely of sweets!

200
00:11:15,733 --> 00:11:17,733
[CHOCOLA]
This fence is delicious!

201
00:11:17,817 --> 00:11:19,442
[VANILLA]
I'm stuffed.

202
00:11:19,525 --> 00:11:20,608
[CHOCOLA]
From that day on,

203
00:11:20,692 --> 00:11:22,733
the two sisters lived
happily ever after

204
00:11:22,817 --> 00:11:25,567
in the conveniently
abandoned dessert house.

205
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:28,317
That's the end of the story!

206
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,275
What?

207
00:11:29,358 --> 00:11:31,317
Is that really the whole thing?

208
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,567
Yep! That's all of it!

209
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,150
Didn't you think it was fun?

210
00:11:35,233 --> 00:11:38,608
Oh, uh, well, it was fun, but
it didn't have much of a point.

211
00:11:38,692 --> 00:11:40,900
Nope.

212
00:11:40,983 --> 00:11:43,358
Actually, the story
isn't over quite yet.

213
00:11:43,442 --> 00:11:45,233
I would like to add to it.

214
00:11:45,317 --> 00:11:47,692
Think of this
next part as a sequel.

215
00:11:47,775 --> 00:11:49,442
Several days
passed as the sisters

216
00:11:49,525 --> 00:11:51,567
enjoyed their
new house of sweets.

217
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,775
They had formed a daily routine.

218
00:11:55,233 --> 00:11:59,233
[VANILLA humming]

219
00:11:59,317 --> 00:12:01,025
Chocola's home.

220
00:12:01,108 --> 00:12:02,358
[VANILLA]
Welcome back!

221
00:12:02,442 --> 00:12:05,192
Oh, man. The boss
was so annoying today.

222
00:12:05,275 --> 00:12:07,025
Chocola's pretty tired.

223
00:12:07,108 --> 00:12:08,858
Sounds like you worked hard.

224
00:12:08,942 --> 00:12:11,192
Any idea what you'd
like to do first?

225
00:12:11,275 --> 00:12:12,942
You could eat dinner...

226
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:14,817
...or take a bath...

227
00:12:16,025 --> 00:12:18,692
...or bathe me.

228
00:12:18,775 --> 00:12:19,650
[AZUKI]
Stop!

229
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:21,067
I'm ending this story.

230
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,608
[VANILLA] It was just
getting good, though.

231
00:12:22,692 --> 00:12:24,192
Let's keep it PG.

232
00:12:24,275 --> 00:12:26,525
But... I wanna
know how it ended.

233
00:12:26,608 --> 00:12:28,483
Fine, have it your way.

234
00:12:28,567 --> 00:12:31,400
I can always tell
a different fairytale.

235
00:12:31,483 --> 00:12:33,942
Once upon a time
in a faraway land,

236
00:12:34,025 --> 00:12:37,067
there lived a cat who made an
honest living chopping bamboo.

237
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:40,233
[COCONUT] Like I always say, if
it's glowing it's gotta be good!

238
00:12:40,317 --> 00:12:43,525
I bet there's probably
gold in there or something.

239
00:12:43,608 --> 00:12:46,108
[VANILLA] From the magical
bamboo, she appeared--

240
00:12:46,192 --> 00:12:47,900
a ghastly woman.

241
00:12:47,983 --> 00:12:49,108
[COCONUT]
Like from the well?!

242
00:12:49,192 --> 00:12:50,692
[AZUKI]
Reusing gags, are we?

243
00:12:50,775 --> 00:12:53,650
[VANILLA]
Okay, I'll tell another one.

244
00:12:53,733 --> 00:12:55,275
You'll like this.

245
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:58,567
The young cat waved goodbye
to the sea turtle after a long,

246
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,692
but wonderful journey
to the dragon palace.

247
00:13:00,775 --> 00:13:02,192
[stomach rumbles]

248
00:13:02,275 --> 00:13:03,900
[VANILLA] But when she
opened the treasure casket

249
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:05,733
she had received as a gift,

250
00:13:05,817 --> 00:13:08,108
out popped the ghastliest woman.

251
00:13:08,192 --> 00:13:09,317
[AZUKI]
Again?

252
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,275
[CINNAMON]
It's kind of predictable.

253
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:12,525
[VANILLA]
Huh?

254
00:13:12,608 --> 00:13:14,900
I'm over your weird
stories, Vanilla.

255
00:13:14,983 --> 00:13:16,817
Sit back, relax,
and let an old pro

256
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,817
show you how it's really done.

257
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,525
[VANILLA grunts]

258
00:13:20,608 --> 00:13:21,817
[MAPLE]
Like any other day,

259
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,567
the lumberjack was hard
at work, chopping wood.

260
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:25,983
[gasps]

261
00:13:27,483 --> 00:13:30,025
[MAPLE] Unfortunately,
her axe fell into a fountain.

262
00:13:30,108 --> 00:13:33,775
[VANILLA] And from the water
emerged... a ghastly woman!

263
00:13:33,858 --> 00:13:35,025
[MAPLE]
No!

264
00:13:35,108 --> 00:13:36,817
There aren't any stupid
ghosts in this story!

265
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,608
What? So it's not
even scary? Weird.

266
00:13:39,692 --> 00:13:41,983
It's not supposed to be, okay?

267
00:13:42,067 --> 00:13:46,025
Ehem. Now then,
where was I again?

268
00:13:46,108 --> 00:13:50,192
Oh, yes, so from the
fountain emerged... a goddess.

269
00:13:50,275 --> 00:13:52,025
Tell me, o honest woodcutter,

270
00:13:52,108 --> 00:13:54,108
which of these belongs to you?

271
00:13:54,192 --> 00:13:56,525
Is it the gold
or the silver one?

272
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:58,900
It's both.

273
00:13:58,983 --> 00:14:02,858
Yes, so I see. It's
neither of them, then-- Huh?

274
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,275
I dropped both of them.

275
00:14:04,358 --> 00:14:05,567
[CINNAMON]
Say what?

276
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,358
[VANILLA]
They're both mine.

277
00:14:07,442 --> 00:14:10,067
Oh, um... They are?

278
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,108
Are you certain?

279
00:14:12,192 --> 00:14:13,525
Look, if you're lying to me,

280
00:14:13,608 --> 00:14:15,067
then you're gonna
be in big trouble--

281
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:18,108
Stop beating around
the bush and hand them over.

282
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:20,567
If you don't,
I'll drain your fountain--

283
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,400
the whole thing.

284
00:14:24,192 --> 00:14:26,358
I'll compensate you.

285
00:14:26,442 --> 00:14:27,775
Give them up,

286
00:14:27,858 --> 00:14:30,150
and I'll let you read my
super-secret fantasy diary,

287
00:14:30,233 --> 00:14:31,775
detailing the
intimate activities

288
00:14:31,858 --> 00:14:33,483
between myself and Chocola.

289
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:35,108
[CINNAMON]
Intimate you say?

290
00:14:35,192 --> 00:14:36,192
Done.

291
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,733
[panting]

292
00:14:38,817 --> 00:14:41,275
Holy wow, pistil to pistil!

293
00:14:41,358 --> 00:14:44,317
You've just opened up
a whole new world for me!

294
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,442
Reading this,
I just can't help myself.

295
00:14:47,525 --> 00:14:51,483
Reading these intimate
details is making me so wet!

296
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:55,358
[sighs] Thanks so much for
this enlightening experience.

297
00:14:55,442 --> 00:14:58,650
You may take both
the gold and silver axes.

298
00:14:58,733 --> 00:15:00,067
Yes, score.

299
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,067
[MAPLE] And thus, the lumberjack
was able to get both--

300
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,567
Stop the story!

301
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:06,150
You guys know I'm not actually
a huge pervert, don't you?

302
00:15:06,233 --> 00:15:06,983
[GROUP]
Huh?

303
00:15:07,067 --> 00:15:08,733
Plus that's really mean.

304
00:15:08,817 --> 00:15:11,442
You've gone too far with
your creative liberties!

305
00:15:11,525 --> 00:15:13,817
We're sorry, you make
a pretty fair point.

306
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,567
Yeah, we didn't mean it.

307
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,067
It should be dreamier!

308
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,525
Less lewd and more
like a real fairytale!

309
00:15:19,608 --> 00:15:23,025
In that case... I've got one.

310
00:15:23,108 --> 00:15:24,317
Once upon a time,

311
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,692
three cats found a lamp
on the side of the road.

312
00:15:27,775 --> 00:15:28,983
[AZUKI]
What's this thing?

313
00:15:29,067 --> 00:15:30,733
Maybe someone dropped it?

314
00:15:30,817 --> 00:15:32,900
Looks kinda old and dirty.

315
00:15:32,983 --> 00:15:34,692
For real.

316
00:15:34,775 --> 00:15:36,150
[ALL gasp]

317
00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:37,900
[COCONUT] There was a puff
of a smoke and out came a...

318
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,775
...ghastly woman.

319
00:15:39,858 --> 00:15:43,692
[COCONUT clears throat]
Out came a magical genie!

320
00:15:45,608 --> 00:15:49,233
How may I serve you, my Masters?

321
00:15:49,317 --> 00:15:51,192
[MAPLE]
Now that's a creative liberty.

322
00:15:51,275 --> 00:15:53,733
[CHOCOLA] Master is
awesome no matter what he is!

323
00:15:53,817 --> 00:15:54,983
What the heck?

324
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:56,567
[KASHOU] I will grant
each of you one wish.

325
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:57,733
Whatever you desire.

326
00:15:57,817 --> 00:15:59,067
--[CHOCOLA] Amazing!
--[AZUKI] Seriously?

327
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:01,067
Then Chocola wants
to eat a huge fish--

328
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,567
the biggest fish ever!

329
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:05,108
As you wish, Master.

330
00:16:05,192 --> 00:16:06,608
[CHOCOLA gasps]

331
00:16:06,692 --> 00:16:07,858
[CHOCOLA]
Wow!

332
00:16:07,942 --> 00:16:10,108
You think it's a tuna or a--

333
00:16:10,192 --> 00:16:12,317
A shark! [yells]

334
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,150
Why is there a
shark in the river?

335
00:16:14,233 --> 00:16:16,358
I'm more interested
to know how it can fly.

336
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,983
Now, what's your desire,
Young Master?

337
00:16:19,067 --> 00:16:21,400
--[CINNAMON] Um, about that...
--[KASHOU] Hm?

338
00:16:21,483 --> 00:16:23,400
The thing is...

339
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,775
...what I want...

340
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:27,025
[KASHOU] You can wish
for anything you please.

341
00:16:27,108 --> 00:16:31,150
[CINNAMON gulps]
I wish for-- [bleep]

342
00:16:31,233 --> 00:16:33,400
What the heck is wrong
with you?! How can you say...

343
00:16:33,483 --> 00:16:35,358
[MAPLE]
Try and have a little decency.

344
00:16:35,442 --> 00:16:36,858
[CINNAMON]
But that wasn't even me!

345
00:16:36,942 --> 00:16:38,442
It was just part of the story!

346
00:16:38,525 --> 00:16:41,525
I'm sure.
What a terrible excuse.

347
00:16:41,608 --> 00:16:43,358
Right, next story.

348
00:16:43,442 --> 00:16:45,525
How 'bout a palette cleanser?

349
00:16:46,733 --> 00:16:47,858
[COCONUT]
When the cat woke up,

350
00:16:47,942 --> 00:16:51,025
she was in a land
filled with tiny people.

351
00:16:51,108 --> 00:16:53,108
This is kind of bizarre.

352
00:16:53,192 --> 00:16:55,025
Princess, the
giant has awakened!

353
00:16:55,108 --> 00:16:56,442
What now?

354
00:16:56,525 --> 00:16:59,150
I wonder if she has come
here to invade our country.

355
00:16:59,233 --> 00:17:01,150
Do you want us
to hang her, Princess?

356
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:02,817
Or burn her at the stake?

357
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,817
Or better yet, we could peel
off her toenails one by one!

358
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,483
[AZUKI grunting]

359
00:17:07,567 --> 00:17:12,150
[AZUKI] Aw, yeah!
I'm finally the biggest, baby!

360
00:17:12,233 --> 00:17:14,442
[COCONUT]
The giant's rampage knew no end.

361
00:17:14,525 --> 00:17:16,150
The earth shattered
beneath her feet,

362
00:17:16,233 --> 00:17:18,817
and the demonic fire she
breathed melted their walls.

363
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,233
[AZUKI]
Hey. What kind of story is that?

364
00:17:21,317 --> 00:17:22,775
I just wanted to
give you your wish

365
00:17:22,858 --> 00:17:25,358
since the genie never
got to in the last story.

366
00:17:25,442 --> 00:17:27,858
And what on earth makes
you think that's my wish?

367
00:17:27,942 --> 00:17:29,442
I thought you'd
want to get bigger?

368
00:17:29,525 --> 00:17:32,150
Uh, hard pass. I'm not
a monster, y'know.

369
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:34,150
Wow, that was
a pretty good story.

370
00:17:34,233 --> 00:17:35,400
[AZUKI]
In what universe?

371
00:17:35,483 --> 00:17:37,733
Here, this one is a favorite.

372
00:17:40,275 --> 00:17:42,150
[CINNAMON]
Matches for sale.

373
00:17:42,233 --> 00:17:44,817
Uh, would you like to
buy some matches, sir?

374
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,150
[MAPLE] The cat tried
her best to sell the matches,

375
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,317
but nobody would buy from her.

376
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,900
Would you like some matches?

377
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,317
I guess I won't be
eating tonight either.

378
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,025
[CINNAMON] I know. I'll use
these matches to stay warm.

379
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,608
[CINNAMON]
How nice. That looks so cozy.

380
00:18:22,025 --> 00:18:23,608
[CINNAMON]
I wish I could join them.

381
00:18:23,692 --> 00:18:25,400
It looks so intimate.

382
00:18:25,483 --> 00:18:26,817
No.

383
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,067
I was so close to
being part of that dream.

384
00:18:34,442 --> 00:18:37,858
[CINNAMON] I bet that cat
cuddle party is so warm.

385
00:18:37,942 --> 00:18:39,358
This daydream...

386
00:18:39,442 --> 00:18:41,192
...I can't help it.

387
00:18:41,275 --> 00:18:44,483
It makes me wet.

388
00:18:45,317 --> 00:18:46,900
[MAPLE] And though
she met a terrible fate,

389
00:18:46,983 --> 00:18:50,608
the poor cat's expression
was at least one of happiness.

390
00:18:50,692 --> 00:18:52,358
[CINNAMON]
Come on, May.

391
00:18:52,442 --> 00:18:55,067
Do you have like a grudge
against me or something?

392
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,900
[MAPLE] No, I just thought it
was the perfect role for you.

393
00:18:57,983 --> 00:18:59,317
Well, I don't
appreciate everyone

394
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,067
treating me like a big pervert.

395
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:05,275
Right! Leave it to me,
I've got a great story.

396
00:19:05,358 --> 00:19:07,400
Once, there was a princess

397
00:19:07,483 --> 00:19:11,817
who bit into a poison apple
and fell into a deep sleep.

398
00:19:14,025 --> 00:19:16,775
Is the princess gonna
nap all day or what?

399
00:19:16,858 --> 00:19:19,608
She's gonna miss tea time
if she doesn't wake up soon.

400
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,150
How terrible.

401
00:19:21,233 --> 00:19:24,067
We simply must find a way to
wake her up as fast as possible!

402
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:26,233
Chocola has an awesome idea!

403
00:19:26,317 --> 00:19:28,858
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle!

404
00:19:28,942 --> 00:19:30,400
There's no response.

405
00:19:30,483 --> 00:19:32,858
It's almost like
she's dead or something.

406
00:19:32,942 --> 00:19:34,317
I'm gonna go get a shovel.

407
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,483
We can't bury her!

408
00:19:35,567 --> 00:19:36,650
Cremation?

409
00:19:36,733 --> 00:19:38,942
[COCONUT]
Neither! She's not even dead!

410
00:19:39,025 --> 00:19:40,983
[AZUKI]
Hmm... Still nothing, huh?

411
00:19:41,067 --> 00:19:42,650
Stop writing on her!

412
00:19:46,025 --> 00:19:47,733
That was kind of you.

413
00:19:47,817 --> 00:19:48,900
[COCONUT]
Though the scribble on her head

414
00:19:48,983 --> 00:19:51,567
makes it look sorta dumb.

415
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:54,150
Listen, everyone,
I think I know what to do.

416
00:19:54,233 --> 00:19:56,983
This is probably a curse,
so all she needs is a kiss

417
00:19:57,067 --> 00:19:59,483
from someone she loves
in order to break the spell!

418
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:00,317
--[GROUP gasps]
--[AZUKI, COCONUT] Kiss?

419
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,900
Yes, AKA a smoochie smooch.

00:20:02,983 --> 00:20:06,317
Uhh... Wait, as in you
want one of us to kiss her?

421
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,692
This is all so sudden.

422
00:20:07,775 --> 00:20:11,317
C'mon, it's for the princess.
We have to do this!

423
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,525
Yes. I agree as well.

424
00:20:13,608 --> 00:20:15,067
[COCONUT gasps]

425
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,400
Fine, whatever. She can have
my first kiss. It's no biggie.

[gasps]

427

[CINNAMON]
Do your best!

428
00:20:19,942 --> 00:20:22,567
Uh... then in that case,

429
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,108
Okay. Mine, too.

430
00:20:24,192 --> 00:20:25,650
[VANILLA, AZUKI]
Cool, give it a shot.

431
00:20:25,733 --> 00:20:26,983
Uh?

432
00:20:41,067 --> 00:20:45,317
[CINNAMON panting]

433
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:50,733
[AZUKI] She leaned in close
to give the princess a kiss,

434
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:52,358
and then she--

435
00:20:52,442 --> 00:20:53,442
[COCONUT, MAPLE]
What?

436
00:20:53,525 --> 00:20:54,692
[AZUKI]
Another blackout?

437
00:20:54,775 --> 00:20:56,650
[COCONUT]
That scared me.

438
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:58,942
[CHOCOLA] Chocola totally
forgot about the storm!

439
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:01,150
But I wanna hear
how the story ends.

[clacking]

441
00:21:02,692 --> 00:21:04,483
Do you hear that weird noise?

442
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:06,567
Yeah, I wonder what it could be?

443
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,817
Kinda sounds like it's
getting closer, doesn't it?

444
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,942
Stop that! You're just
trying to scare us!

--[door opens]
--[yelps]

446

Was that...

00:21:13,317 --> 00:21:15,275
...the front door?

448
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:18,067
Oh! I bet this is
just Vanilla again!

449
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,817
You're right. It's probably
another one of her pranks.

450
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,233
Vanilla does love
teasing people.

451
00:21:23,317 --> 00:21:24,858
It isn't me this time.

[MAPLE]
Mm? How did you get there?

453

Oh, thank you so much, Cacao.

454
00:21:29,067 --> 00:21:30,817
Now Chocola can see!

455
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,317
There's nothing
for us to be afraid of.

[ALL scream]
