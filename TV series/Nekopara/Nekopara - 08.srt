00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:46,067
Okay, I'm seriously
worried about Shigure now.

163
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,775
But not worried enough
to stop pigging out, I see.

164
00:09:48,858 --> 00:09:50,358
It's so odd.

165
00:09:50,442 --> 00:09:52,483
You'd think that after all this,
we would've at least figured out

166
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:54,067
what's causing her
to act this way.

167
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,608
Hey, here's an idea.

168
00:09:55,692 --> 00:09:57,900
Maybe it's 'cause
she misses Kashou.

169
00:09:57,983 --> 00:09:59,442
That's a possibility.

170
00:09:59,525 --> 00:10:02,733
She does love her
brother a bit too much.

171
00:10:02,817 --> 00:10:04,692
[ALL]
Hmm...

172
00:10:04,775 --> 00:10:06,858
[SHIGURE] Wow, I could
look at Kashou's photograph

173
00:10:06,942 --> 00:10:08,608
all day long!

174

I'm so happy you're
finally home, big brother!

Ready for dinner?

177
00:10:18,858 --> 00:10:20,275
Or perhaps your bath?

178
00:10:20,358 --> 00:10:22,317
Ooh, wait, I know.

179
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,983
Would you like me?

180
00:10:27,692 --> 00:10:29,608
Knock, knock, Kashou!

181
00:10:29,692 --> 00:10:33,692
I'm here to help you wash all
of your hard-to-reach places!

182
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,483
[SHIGURE yelps]

183
00:10:37,567 --> 00:10:39,442
[SHIGURE]
Aw, you're so mean!

184
00:10:39,525 --> 00:10:40,650
You know that my love for you

185
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:43,733
is as vast and deep
as the Marianas Trench!

186
00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:49,442
As twisted as that is,
we probably guessed it right.

187
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:52,567
When his shop opened
he did stop coming around,

188
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,817
so I'm sure Shigure
really misses him.

189
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,733
Case closed! That's it!

190
00:10:56,817 --> 00:10:57,983
She's been acting weird

191
00:10:58,067 --> 00:11:00,150
because she wants to see
her beloved big brother.

192
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:01,400
That makes sense.

193
00:11:01,483 --> 00:11:03,400
Definitely a possibility.

194
00:11:03,483 --> 00:11:05,108
[ALL]
Mm-hm.

195
00:11:05,192 --> 00:11:08,192
But what can we do about it
that'll help her feel better?

196
00:11:08,275 --> 00:11:09,733
Easy!

197
00:11:09,817 --> 00:11:12,317
We'll set up a time for the
two of them to see each other!

198
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,525
[COCONUT, AZUKI]
Mm.

199
00:11:13,608 --> 00:11:15,358
Let's do this!

200
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:17,358
[ALL]
Yeah!

201
00:11:31,317 --> 00:11:35,400
Um... Why exactly am I dressed
in the patisserie's uniform?

202
00:11:35,483 --> 00:11:37,608
Well, it's because
of the cats back home.

203
00:11:37,692 --> 00:11:39,775
They said you could
use a little pick me up.

204
00:11:39,858 --> 00:11:42,650
Hence the outfit. 'Cause nothing
makes someone feel better

205
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:44,150
than looking super cute.

206
00:11:44,233 --> 00:11:45,692
Absolutely!

207
00:11:45,775 --> 00:11:47,775
You just need to do something
to take your mind off things

208
00:11:47,858 --> 00:11:50,817
and working here will help you
forget whatever's bothering mew!

[SHIGURE]
Yeah, but...

210
00:11:52,442 --> 00:11:54,692
...I don't think wearing these
clothes will make a difference.

[VANILLA]
Don't worry.

212
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,608
All you have to do
is put on these cat ears,

213
00:11:58,692 --> 00:12:00,692
then you'll look
like a real cat.

214

Hi and welcome to our café!

okay for the two of you ladies?

[BOTH gasp]

Bet she's nailing it, right?

More like she's failing it.

230
00:12:44,025 --> 00:12:46,817
You should probably
see for yourselves.

231
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,983
I just knew this would happen.

232
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:51,608
I mean, what was I thinking
trying to serve customers?

233
00:12:51,692 --> 00:12:54,025
It's too much for
an introvert like me.

[ALL sigh]

235

Looks like we've only
managed to make things worse.

[CHOCOLA]
Chocola is at a loss.

237
00:13:02,442 --> 00:13:04,858
What can we do to make
Shigure feel better?

238
00:13:04,942 --> 00:13:07,317
I suppose we have
no other choice.

239
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,983
I will go out and buy her
some tasty vanilla ice cream!

240
00:13:10,067 --> 00:13:11,233
[AZUKI]
Hold up.

241
00:13:11,317 --> 00:13:12,900
We should buy her red bean.
It's way better.

242
00:13:12,983 --> 00:13:15,608
Oh, please, everyone knows
that coconut bars are the best.

243

What? No way! Red bean ice cream
has the most firmness!

244
00:13:19,483 --> 00:13:20,942
This is no time
for your bickering.

245
00:13:21,025 --> 00:13:23,150
This is supposed
to be about Shigure!

something about Shigure?

Yes!

263
00:14:10,108 --> 00:14:11,775
I took the liberty of
making some chamomile tea,

264
00:14:11,858 --> 00:14:13,900
since it has a
nice, calming effect.

265
00:14:13,983 --> 00:14:16,025
[KASHOU] I brought
a matcha green tea roll cake.

266
00:14:16,108 --> 00:14:18,525
It's one of Shigure's favorites.

00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,900
We'll try to give the
two of you some space,

so you can spend
some time together.

Now, go out there
and console her

in the wettest
way possible, okay?

271
00:14:26,275 --> 00:14:28,358
I'll probably pass
on the last part.

272

Anyway, why exactly
does this matter so much?

You're never around anymore.

This is a good chance
to spoil Shigure a bit.

Uh, yeah.

Well, you have a fair point.

278

We do talk a lot less,
especially since I moved out

and opened up the patisserie.

280
00:14:45,567 --> 00:14:48,150

feeling so bad lately?

00:16:46,442 --> 00:16:49,317
[MAPLE] Great, we've all
turned into complete stalkers.

321
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,775
This isn't the way
back to our house.

322
00:16:51,858 --> 00:16:53,358
For real.

323
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,692
Where is she going?

324
00:17:13,442 --> 00:17:15,900
Why is she just
wondering around?

325
00:17:31,108 --> 00:17:32,733
[AZUKI]
This is so weird!

326
00:17:32,817 --> 00:17:34,650
Why would she come out here
to the middle of nowhere

327
00:17:34,733 --> 00:17:36,358
instead of going back home?

328
00:17:36,442 --> 00:17:37,733
[COCONUT]
What's her deal?

329
00:17:37,817 --> 00:17:39,983
I thought talking to Kashou
helped her feel better.

330
00:17:40,067 --> 00:17:43,067
If that were true, then
why would she come out here?

331
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,025
This is kinda creepy.

332
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:57,692
[CINNAMON gasps]

333
00:17:59,317 --> 00:18:00,817
Could it be?

334
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,525
I think I saw this on
television the other night!

335
00:18:03,608 --> 00:18:05,025
A woman lost her love,

336
00:18:05,108 --> 00:18:08,483
and in a moment of despair
threw herself off of a cliff!

337
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:09,942
[MAPLE, COCONUT, AZUKI gasp]

338
00:18:10,025 --> 00:18:11,483
It all makes sense now.

339
00:18:11,567 --> 00:18:14,400
She must feel guilty about her
forbidden love for her brother.

340
00:18:14,483 --> 00:18:17,900
Shigure knows it can never be a
reality so she's going to jump!

341
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:20,483
Yeah, I don't know. You sure?

342
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:22,025
[MAPLE]
Sounds far-fetched?

343
00:18:22,108 --> 00:18:24,942
[AZUKI]
There's no way, right, guys?

344
00:18:26,358 --> 00:18:28,525
[CINNAMON]
Shigure, don't! No!

345
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,442
--[COCONUT] It's not worth it!
--[MAPLE] Stop! Don't do it!

346
00:18:30,525 --> 00:18:32,400
Aw, man, this sucks.

347
00:18:32,483 --> 00:18:34,233
Hey!

348
00:18:35,608 --> 00:18:39,442
[GROUP shouting]

349
00:18:39,525 --> 00:18:40,483
Huh?

350
00:18:40,567 --> 00:18:42,442
Please, Shigure,
we're begging you!

351
00:18:42,525 --> 00:18:44,192
Don't you dare leave us alone!

352
00:18:44,275 --> 00:18:46,483
It's gonna be okay!

353
00:18:46,567 --> 00:18:47,900
What are you doing here?

354
00:18:47,983 --> 00:18:48,942
You idiot!

355
00:18:49,025 --> 00:18:50,400
You've been acting
so weird lately

356
00:18:50,483 --> 00:18:52,275
that we're all
worried sick about you!

357
00:18:52,358 --> 00:18:54,025
Yes, that's right!

358
00:18:54,108 --> 00:18:55,233
Usually,

359
00:18:55,317 --> 00:18:57,108
your days are filled
with following us around

360
00:18:57,192 --> 00:19:00,400
and taking our pictures
like a cat-obsessed paparazzi.

361
00:19:00,483 --> 00:19:02,317
[MAPLE] You've always
treasured those photos.

362
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,983
Remember how posting
them on your blog

363
00:19:04,067 --> 00:19:05,442
brought you so much joy?

364
00:19:05,525 --> 00:19:06,650
[COCONUT]
And when I was still a kitten,

365
00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:08,275
you were there to
take care of me.

366
00:19:08,358 --> 00:19:10,567
No matter what, I knew
I could count on you!

367
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,817
[AZUKI] You're so kind,
Shigure, and caring.

368
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,275
You take care of us
through thick and thin,

369
00:19:16,358 --> 00:19:18,900
rain or shine, all the time!

370
00:19:18,983 --> 00:19:20,733
And that's why...

371
00:19:20,817 --> 00:19:22,942
[GROUP]
...we love you!

372
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,650

[cackling]

374
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,608
She's laughing?

375
00:19:42,692 --> 00:19:43,442
But why?

376
00:19:43,525 --> 00:19:45,942
[SHIGURE continues cackling]

377
00:19:46,025 --> 00:19:48,275
Uh, she's acting kind of crazy.

378
00:19:48,358 --> 00:19:50,817
This is really
weirding me out, you guys.

379
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,608
It's finally
happening, my loves!

380
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,567
I've been waiting for so long!

381
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:58,983
So long! [laughs]

382
00:19:59,067 --> 00:19:59,817
[SHIGURE yells]

383
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,192
[AZUKI yells]

00:20:03,192 --> 00:20:04,858
[yelling]

00:20:04,942 --> 00:20:06,275
Azuki! [gasps]

[CINNAMON gasps, yelps]

387
00:20:07,942 --> 00:20:08,692
[MAPLE]
No!

388
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:12,775
[ALL screaming]

389
00:20:20,067 --> 00:20:22,275
[SHIGURE] Okay, I think
I've finally figured out

390
00:20:22,358 --> 00:20:23,817
why I've been feeling so down.

391
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,400
[GROUP]
Huh?

392
00:20:25,483 --> 00:20:28,692
[SHIGURE] I only just realized
it once you were all hugging me.

393
00:20:28,775 --> 00:20:31,983
I think the summer
heat might be to blame.

394
00:20:32,067 --> 00:20:33,525
During the winter,
when it's colder,

395
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:37,108
you would all come and
snuggle with me every night.

396
00:20:37,192 --> 00:20:39,567
But because it's
been so hot lately,

397
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:40,900
you've stopped being cuddly

398
00:20:40,983 --> 00:20:44,567
and instead have opted
for cooler places to sleep.

399
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:47,567
That's why... I was
feeling so depressed.

400
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:51,358
I was sick and suffering
from a lack of cats.

401
00:20:51,442 --> 00:20:54,233
It's a disorder known
as acute cat deprivation!

402
00:20:54,317 --> 00:20:57,025
[GROUP]
Wait, that's seriously why?

403
00:20:57,108 --> 00:20:58,900
[SHIGURE] Usually,
I go to that cliff side because

404
00:20:58,983 --> 00:21:02,025
I want to be alone and
try to sort out my problems.

405
00:21:02,108 --> 00:21:04,067
Honestly, I never would
have expected you guys

406
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:06,692
to be so worried that
you'd end up following me.

407
00:21:06,775 --> 00:21:09,358
Thank you so much
for your concern.

408
00:21:11,108 --> 00:21:13,233
Come on, Shigure,
don't be like that.

409
00:21:13,317 --> 00:21:15,817
Of course we were worried.

410
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,733
But in the future,
just tell us these things.

411
00:21:18,817 --> 00:21:21,233
Yeah, for real!
No need to hold back.

412
00:21:21,317 --> 00:21:23,692
And, just for tonight,
we can cuddle.

413
00:21:23,775 --> 00:21:25,942
I'm in. Let's
all be wet together!

is just what I needed.
