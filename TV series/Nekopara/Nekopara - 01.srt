Tell me, do you know about cats?

They've got cute ears
that wiggle and twitch.

to their emotions.

I was rather surprised when

unexpectedly as they did.

it's probably not very smart

61
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,358
to open a package when
I wasn't expecting it.

to stay with you,

come up with a plan!

And I most certainly did not
hide inside the moving boxes

live with you out of the blue

be totally crazy!

Hello! Why are you hiding?

[gasps] What? She vanished.

How very strange.
Why'd she run away like that?

leave this here
