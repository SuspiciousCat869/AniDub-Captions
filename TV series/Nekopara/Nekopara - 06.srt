The difference in
power is obvious.

It's like Cinnamon's

more like plums.

would win based on size alone.

00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,067
"Palmate" is a word meaning

a hand, fingers spread.

Come on, you've got this.

Vanilla's attacking
with everything she's got

236

and she's tricked Coconut into
ignoring the fight completely.

That's typical
Vanilla--scheming.

Azuki's so cool! She just
unleashed a super fast combo!

256

The way she's moving her hips...

[SHIGURE] I swear I've seen
that move somewhere before.

invented by the Manassa Mauler.

A deadly combo--

By weaving her
body side to side,

00:14:25,858 --> 00:14:27,942
she can put all her
weight behind her attacks,

and more powerful!

thanks to her size,

is now in the lead!

318
00:16:39,025 --> 00:16:40,483
[MAPLE] She shouldn't
get too comfortable.

319
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:42,275
This is only the beginning.

320
00:16:42,358 --> 00:16:43,650
That so?

321
00:16:43,733 --> 00:16:45,608
You think Azuki
can still catch up?

322
00:16:45,692 --> 00:16:47,567
[MAPLE] The next area
might be a challenge.

323

[AZUKI yelps]

325
00:16:50,233 --> 00:16:52,858
[MAPLE] It's known as
the "Catfeather Bridge."

326
00:16:52,942 --> 00:16:54,733
It takes excellent
self-control for a cat

327
00:16:54,817 --> 00:16:57,775
to resist following the
fluffy toys with their eyes.

328
00:16:57,858 --> 00:17:00,150
Some cats may even
be drawn in to pounce,

329
00:17:00,233 --> 00:17:02,983
but if they do, they'll
plummet to their doom.

330
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:06,067
[VANILLA]
I see. How terrifying!

[gasps]

333
00:17:14,358 --> 00:17:16,817
Azuki's the first to break free!

334
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,858
They've averted their eyes
to avoid sweet temptation!

335
00:17:19,942 --> 00:17:21,858
And we've reached
the final obstacle!

336
00:17:21,942 --> 00:17:24,692
The goal is at the top
of the rock wall pillar!

337
00:17:24,775 --> 00:17:27,233
Wow, Azuki's ameowzingly fast!

338
00:17:32,192 --> 00:17:34,900
[COCONUT] I'll never be able
to catch up to her like this.

339
00:17:38,108 --> 00:17:40,233
[COCONUT] But I bet I can
if I ditch this rock wall

340
00:17:40,317 --> 00:17:42,483
and use the cat towers!

341
00:17:42,567 --> 00:17:44,650
Here I come!

342
00:17:44,733 --> 00:17:45,650
Wha--?

343
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,442
And that's how it's done, Azuki!

344
00:17:50,525 --> 00:17:51,983
[laughs]

345
00:17:52,067 --> 00:17:54,108
Who needs speed when you've got
winning brains like these?

346
00:17:54,192 --> 00:17:55,358
Time to finish up!

Thanks for catching me.

You kinda saved my life.

Huh, I was just cleaning up
your mess like always.

You seriously never change.

You know, Nuts,

359
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,400
if you didn't push yourself
so hard when you play,

360
00:18:46,483 --> 00:18:47,442
you wouldn't get hurt.

[COCONUT giggles]
I can't help it,

362

I just love playing
with you, big sis!

363
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:55,275
What a pain in the butt.
I got better things to do.

364
00:18:55,358 --> 00:18:57,775
I bet you'll get it
done faster if I help!

Ah. Oh, no, what should I do?

[AZUKI]
Don't touch it!

Are you okay?

369
00:19:09,192 --> 00:19:11,692
Did you get cut or anything?

370
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,775
I didn't mean to break it.

371
00:19:13,858 --> 00:19:15,442
Sorry.

372
00:19:16,608 --> 00:19:20,108
I'm not upset. I'm just
glad you're all right.

373
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:23,067
I thought you got hurt
and it really scared me, so.

374
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:25,108
I swear, I'm gonna use
up one of my nine lives

Hold on.

You yelled at me because

379
00:19:31,275 --> 00:19:33,525
you were afraid I was
gonna hurt myself?

380

Maybe. Why's it matter?

You're both okay, right?
No one's hurt?

It's cool, we're both okay.

385
00:19:49,608 --> 00:19:51,567
Azuki was a real
hero back there.

386
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,400
Yeah, it would have
been lame to win against

387

because they ate it.

You finished at the same time.

So how do we decide
which one of you won?

391

How 'bout we just leave
it at a tie for today?

392

Sounds good.

393

I'm gettin' tired, anyway. Let's
head home so we can pig out.

What? Now they're cool?

395

Maybe all that exercise finally
worked it out of their system.

But you know it
makes you happy!

to be embarrassed about.

[KASHOU] Did Coconut and Azuki
already take off for the day?

417
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:03,942
Yeah, we told them we
could take it from here.

418

It's a slow day anyway.

419
00:21:05,483 --> 00:21:06,567
They both said they were going

420
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,900
to go shopping together
on their way home!

Oh. Well, how about that.

are close after all.

Yes, check it out!

Look no further, Azuki,

because I've got your
new bowl right here!

rice than you would think.
