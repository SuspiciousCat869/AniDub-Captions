1
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:23,083
[NARRATOR]
They kill as well.

2
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:25,541
If it'll make them
some money, that is.

3
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:28,791
Pirates? Outlaws?
Space Forces flunkies?

4
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:31,166
No, they're none of those.

5
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,791
But they'll take
jobs from anyone.

6
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:36,500
Right. If it'll make
them some money.

7
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:38,000
At any rate,

8
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:41,125
they're like hyenas who are
valued by all the powers.

9
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,708
They're dangerous if
you get too close to them.

10
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:45,000
And they're good.

11
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:46,333
If they weren't,

12
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:49,375
somebody would've shot
them in the back long ago.

13
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:53,250
They are more powerful than
other people's hatred of them.

14
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:56,375
Everyone in the
underworld knows the name,

15
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:58,666
"The MacDougall Brothers."

16
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,000
But no one knows what
the MacDougall Brothers

17
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:02,833
are really like.

18
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:08,416
They're careful, bold, cunning,
and will do anything for money.

19
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,458
They're dependable,
tough, ruthless.

20
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:14,833
Everyone who knows anything
more than just rumors

21
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:16,833
has been killed.

22
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:18,041
Yeah.

23
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:21,750
All at the hands of the
MacDougall Brothers.

24
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,333
[MELFINA] Distance to border
of Lione Lagrange Point,

25
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,416
30,000 kilometers.

26
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,125
Jim, do ya see any
sign of the <i>El Dorado</i> ?

27
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,625
Nope, still nothing.

28
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:14,500
But the magnetic storm seems
to be affecting the sensors

29
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:15,583
just a little.

30
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:16,708
[GILLIAM]
According to the findings

31
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:18,750
on the latest
meteorological data,

32
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:22,041
it appears as though solar
flares are still active.

33
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:25,041
This magnetic storm will
probably last a while.

34
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,583
Good. That means they're
in the same situation.

35
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,833
And now it's payback
time, <i>El Dorado</i> .

36
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,125
[GENE]
What did you say?

37
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,625
What do you mean the <i>El Dorado</i>
has dropped out? Huh?

38
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:41,041
[STAFF C]
You're askin' the wrong guy.

39
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,000
[GENE]
Where did he go?

40
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:42,833
Tell me!

41
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:44,750
Well, sir... that's just it.

42
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,500
We have a comm cube
with your name on it.

43
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,625
It was sent directly
from the <i>El Dorado</i> .

44
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,791
What? Sent to me?

45
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:57,125
[MELFINA] Distance to
LaGrange Point, ten thousand.

46
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:59,458
[GILLIAM]
Still no sign of the enemy.

47
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:02,291
Gene, wouldn't he be inside
the asteroid field by now?

48
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,250
More than likely, but I
don't wanna go in there yet

49
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:05,916
until I'm absolutely certain.

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,958
I'm slowin' us down.

51
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:10,291
[HARRY] I'm fed up with that
so-called luck of yours.

52
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,833
You're wasting my time.

53
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:15,250
Come over to the Lione LaGrange
Point. I wanna finish this.

54
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,375
Make it within 50 hours.

55
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,625
If you get there before me,

56
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:21,041
I'll tell you whatever
you wanna know.

57
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,666
Whaddya think?

58
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,875
I guess that he's
challenging us to a duel.

59
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,291
Interesting.

60
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:37,875
[GILLIAM] Oh, my. Collected
interplanetary material.

61
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:42,083
Sudden ether current
interference. Magnetic storms.

62
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,458
Horrible conditions.

63
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:46,750
It doesn't look like radar,
CFS, or subspace radar

64
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,708
are gonna be of any use
to us in this region.

65
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:53,125
So we'll just have to rely
on our eyes, that's all.

66
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:56,000
Then leave it to me
'cause I got the eyes!

67
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,541
Yeah.

68
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:00,583
I hear that the Ctarl-Ctarl
have got the best eyes around.

69
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,583
Just give me one good reason
why we have to bring you along.

70
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,333
You're the ones who
ruined my chances

71
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:06,708
of moving up in the world.

72
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:07,541
Hmph!

73
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,125
You're gonna make of for it!

74
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,791
I have to find the
Galactic Leyline

75
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,791
and you're gonna
help me do it now!

76
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,875
Okay, but there is something
I've been wanting to ask you.

77
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,666
Just what in the hell
is the Galactic Leyline?

78
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,833
[AISHA]
What?! You don't even know that?

79
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,458
Hilda didn't exactly
divulge information.

80
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:25,875
Well, listen closely.

81
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,875
At the Galactic Leyline,
there's an incredible treasure.

82
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:31,666
Treasure? Like what?
Some kindaf precious metal?

83
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,958
That or a storehouse
of Dragonite.

84
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,833
In other words, the Empire's
intelligence bureau

85
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,916
estimates that it's value
is capable of buying

86
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,625
an entire solar system!

87
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,625
Wow! Totally cool!

88
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:45,166
However "cool" it is,
it's just a thing.

89
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,458
From just the little
bit I have heard,

90
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:50,791
I wouldn't go so far as to call
it some incredible treasure.

91
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,500
What would you call it?

92
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:53,916
A gate.

93
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,958
I don't know. I hear that
it's some kind of gateway.

94
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,208
Then that's it!

95
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,625
That gateway is probably
made outta Dragonite.

96
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,208
That will make sense to me!

97
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:04,250
Anyhow, there's absolutely no
way we can't take you with us.

98
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,375
This is our own duel, okay?

99
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,375
Uh, uh, uh...

100
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,333
If these MacDougall
Brothers know something

101
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:11,708
about the Galactic Leyline,

102
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,750
then I'm definitely
coming along with you guys.

103
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,833
Do you understand
what I've said to you?!

104
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:20,083
[AISHA]
Hmm...

105
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,375
I don't see any sign of them.

106
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:22,958
[JIM]
Maybe it's a trap.

107
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,125
[GENE] Of course it's
a trap. Whaddya think?

108
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:26,916
They wanna destroy this ship.

109
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,958
That is, the ship
called the <i>XGP</i> .

110
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,666
[JIM, AISHA]
Huh?

111
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,125
One moment. A moment
please, gentlemen.

112
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,083
Huh? You mean us?

113
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:45,875
Yes, that's right.
I'm addressing you.

114
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,583
How did you come into
possession of that ship?

115
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,666
Mh-hm. That ship.

116
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,416
So, who are you?

117
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,208
[chuckles]

118
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:57,833
I'm Gwen Khan. Yes, I'm Gwen.

119
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:01,000
I am a race official.
Of this race.

120
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:04,041
Mh-hm. That's what
I am, an official.

121
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,000
And what exactly what
makes you so interested

122
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,958
in our ship, Mr. Official?

123
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,083
I'm interested.
Yes, interested.

124
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,625
Yes, I am.

125
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:15,000
It's a high-performance ship
made by an unknown manufacturer.

126
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:18,333
Yes, it's a high-performance
ship, it truly is.

127
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,833
Is that so?

128
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:20,708
[JIM]
Mhm.

129
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:23,291
Come now, tell, do tell.

130
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,583
How did you come by
that ship, I must know.

131
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:29,458
That is the mystery.
Yes, that is the mystery.

132
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:36,750
[GENE]
Hm...

133
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:37,541
We found it.

134
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,000
Found it?

135
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,708
Hm... You found it?

136
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:43,541
Is that possible? No!

137
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,958
How odd. You found it?

138
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,708
Yep! It was abandoned
and without an owner.

139
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:51,166
So I guess that means
it's our ship now.

140
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,250
Is that a problem?

141
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,500
A problem?

142
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:54,958
A problem.

143
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,666
Let's see,
I suppose there isn't.

144
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,000
No. No problem at all.

145
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:00,541
[GENE]
Good!

146
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:01,791
All right then.

147
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,541
You'll have to excuse us
'cause we're in a hurry.

148
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,416
[KHAN]
Gentlemen!

149
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,208
Are you guys going to re--?

150
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,458
[GENE]
What?

151
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:14,666
[click]

152
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,708
[chuckles]

153
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:17,375
it's nothing.

154
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:20,041
Absolutely nothing.

155
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,333
Nothing. Nothing.

156
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,166
I'm just so bored.

157
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,666
What was the deal with
that old man, Khan?

158
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,875
I don't know.

159
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,208
By the way, Gene,
are we just gonna

160
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:37,250
keep on circling this
asteroid field forever?

161
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,958
Ehh, we can't find
our dance partner

162
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,458
so what choice do we have?

163
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,958
Hey, maybe I'll just
slow down a little bit.

164
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,500
[MELFINA] All engines
systems show green.

165
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:46,666
Green is good.

166
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,750
Now what about Newton
reactors 1 and 3?

167
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,375
[MELFINA]
Functioning normally.

168
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:51,916
[GILLIAM]
Well, yes, of course.

169
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,875
Although it may have
been a rush job,

170
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,833
the repairs have been completed.

171
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:59,375
Gee, your superiority,
once again, saves the day.

172
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:02,000
[GILLIAM]
Your praise flatters me, Gene.

173
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:02,833
One moment.

174
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,000
Now what?

175
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,083
[GILLIAM]
Detecting missiles closing in

176
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,416
from nine o'clock high.

177
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,541
[GENE]
Missiles? With no warning?

178
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:17,000
Enemy ship spotted ahead!

179
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:24,958
This'll be a one-on-one duel.
That isn't a problem, is it?

180
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:27,083
Now, now, this
isn't exactly fair.

181
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,958
It's pretty obvious that
you intend to destroy us,

182
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,833
but there's just a few
things we'd like to ask

183
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,333
before you're destroyed.

184
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,625
Don't you know you
don't stand a chance?

185
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,000
Well, that's quite the plan.

186
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,250
We're in your backyard,
so we have the disadvantage.

187
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,416
In that case, I'll give
you a guarantee.

188
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,666
Listen, I don't come over to
the Heifong area very often.

189
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,916
[GENE]
Oh really?

190
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,083
So where's your usual
stomping grounds, then?

191
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,708
Ah, just around.

192
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,833
[growls] Jerk!

193
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,500
Now what are we gonna do?!

194
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,791
Accept the challenge,
whaddya think?

195
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,916
Gilliam! Launch the camera!

196
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,416
It'll be our scout!

197
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,791
[GILLIAM]
Be aware.

198
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,291
The conditions are even worse
inside the asteroid field.

199
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:20,250
Sending it too far would
appear to be useless.

200
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,708
Then you might say

201
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:24,000
that his traps wouldn't
stand chance in there either,

202
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,166
would they?

203
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,125
There's no sign of
the enemy ship at all!

204
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:30,125
Hey, Aisha, I want ya to
watch our back, ya got it?

205
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,916
Just leave it to me!

206
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:39,791
Dammit to hell!

207
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,916
Why did he pick a place
like this for a duel?

208
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,541
What kinda trick is
he tryin' to pull?

209
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:44,666
[MELFINA]
Missiles detected.

210
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,541
They're directly below us.

211
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,500
You're gonna pay!

212
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,375
Looks like he's got himself
some accurate missiles.

213
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,041
This guy's not foolin' around.

214
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,166
Now I get it.

215
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,791
So that's why he has
us stuck out here.

216
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,416
If we can make this a
close-quarters fight,

217
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,000
he's all ours!

218
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,375
[JIM]
There he is!

219
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,750
Ya sucker!

220
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,333
You won't get away!

221
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:14,708
Huh?

222
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:15,958
Where'd he go?

223
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:22,541
They're on our back!

224
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:23,958
What did you say?!

225
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,041
[growls] That asshole!

226
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,500
Tell me something, Gilliam,

227
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,750
is his ship more maneuverable
than the <i>Outlaw Star</i> is?

228
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,708
[GILLIAM] This ship utilizes
the most advanced

229
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,500
navigation system in the galaxy.

230
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,541
It's impossible that
my maneuverability

231
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:45,083
is inferior to a ship
of the same class.

232
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,041
Ya don't say...

233
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,583
Well this guy has no idea.

234
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,708
[MELFINA] Missiles closing in.
Ten o'clock high.

235
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,541
Just come at us from
head-on, damn it!

236
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,291
Yeah, the MacDougall
Brothers definitely have

237
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,458
some interesting tactics.

238
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,625
They sure like to sneak around.

239
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:05,875
[AISHA]
Wha--?

240
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,166
Starboard aft! Some more
missiles approaching!

241
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,500
[GILLIAM]
At four o'clock high.

242
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:12,708
No! Whaddya mean?!
He snuck up behind us already?!

243
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,958
There's no way we can shake
the ones on the right!

244
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:18,250
Then I'll swat 'em down!

245
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:45,583
I'm gonna have to go
all out against this guy.

246
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:16,000
[GILLIAM] Incoming missiles,
nine o'clock high.

247
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,208
[MELFINA] Missles coming in
from three o'clock high.

248
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:21,666
Count, five.

249
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,666
[ALL yelping]

250
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,500
Gene! If this keeps
up, we're history!

251
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,750
Don't worry. He'll be
out of missiles soon!

252
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,250
That's when the fight'll start!

253
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,208
Stop sitting around,
you birdbrains!

254
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,333
Blast your way in there
and smash him to a pulp!

255
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,250
You can't let him do
this to you anymore!

256
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,500
Shut up, Aisha!

257
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:48,666
If I could, I would!

258
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,625
[growls]

259
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,541
Don't tell me to shut up, you--!

260
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,333
[GENE]
I said to shut up, so shut up!

261
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,000
[AISHA]
You shut up!

262
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,333
[MELFINA]
Gilliam,

263
00:13:57,416 --> 00:14:00,333
isn't it getting a little
too hot on the bridge?

264
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,291
[GILLIAM]
I'm sorry about that, Melfina.

265
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,333
I'll lower it two
degrees at once.

266
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,333
Ten o'clock high! More of 'em!

267
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,291
Agh! Got it!

268
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:11,708
[GENE]
Where's the <i>El Dorado</i> ?!

269
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,166
[GILLIAM]
I seem to have lost it.

270
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,333
Damn you, Gilliam,
what're you doin'?!

271
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:18,750
Why don't we launch the cameras
and position them all around us?

272
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:21,000
[GILLIAM] Our effective signal
range in these conditions

273
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,875
is about 100 kilometers.

274
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,791
It's unlikely that we will
receive any useful visuals.

275
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,041
Listen to me!

276
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,000
Plow through those guys!
Crush them into pieces!

277
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,708
And stop fooling around!

278
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,541
I told you to shut up, Aisha!

279
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,000
Right, like I'm gonna shut up!

280
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,125
Look, if you don't shut up,
I'm throwin' ya outside!

281
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,000
Why you--!

282
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,750
[growls]

283
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:39,750
Meow?

284
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,000
Throw her out... Wait...

285
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:42,833
Yeah, that's it.

286
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,291
Just like in the old days

287
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,250
when they had a lookout that
would give them a signal.

288
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,708
Like some kinda strong
light or something.

289
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,708
Aisha, I need you
to do me a favor

290
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:53,458
that can be done by
a strong Ctar-Ctarl.

291
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:56,166
Huh? What made you change?

292
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,000
I need ta throw you
off the ship, okay?

293
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,458
Meow?

294
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,666
Well, the odds aren't that
great really, but I think...

295
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,166
Well let's just say
it's a better plan

296
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,333
than keepin' this goin'.

297
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,708
Meow...?

298
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,708
By about now, they should
be sweatin' bullets.

299
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,416
You're probably right.

300
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,541
Huh?

301
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,166
Hey, Harry, are we
gonna fish 'em off?

302
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,833
Nah, I'm gonna play
with 'em a little more.

303
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,291
How many missiles are left?

304
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,416
We have 24% remaining.

305
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,583
[HARRY chuckles]

306
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,875
See. We have plenty left.

307
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,750
Let's sneak behind them.

308
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,250
[laughs]

309
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,833
Make sure that they don't
find out there's another ship.

310
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,416
Oh no.

311
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,916
There they are! There they are!

312
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,083
I found 'em!

313
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,833
Oh no, I think we've
been spotted!

314
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,166
Impossible!

315
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,541
Ship comin' in.
It's the <i>Outlaw Star</i> !

316
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,958
Yeah, now you guys are mine!

317
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,666
You think I'm goin'
down that easily?

318
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,291
I didn't know they had
the Grappler Arms!

319
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,958
You thought the <i>El Dorado</i>
was just an ordinary cruiser,

320
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,333
didn't ya?

321
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,916
[laughs] Gotcha!

322
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,833
Die! Die! Die! Die!
Die! You die!

323
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,291
Damn you!

324
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,083
Take over, Jim.

325
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,250
But why?

326
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,500
'Cause I'm going over
there and join 'em.

327
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:09,000
This is the <i>El Dorado</i> !
We've been caught by the enemy!

328
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,375
--This is the--
--[HARRY] Stop that.

329
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,791
If it's come to that,
don't worry. I'll settle it.

330
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,708
All by myself.

331
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,625
[TERRY]
Hey!

332
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,041
[TERRY groaning]

333
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:27,666
Oh, that hurt!
Ooh... You shot--

334
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,458
So, MacDougall--

335
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:30,875
Wait, you're not MacDougall.

336
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:31,916
Huh?

337
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,708
Now tell me,
where is MacDougall?!

338
00:17:57,541 --> 00:18:00,666
So tell me, what
do you wanna know?

339
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,083
[GILLIAM]
Oh no. Warning, warning.

340
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,750
Uh? What is it, Gilliam?

341
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,541
[GILLIAM] Someone is
trying to hack into me.

342
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,666
And the source not available.

343
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,875
Engaging emergency protection.

344
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,625
Now I must say good night.

345
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:20,750
[JIM]
Gilliam.

346
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,208
[screams]

347
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,166
What is it?!

348
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,916
Stop it! Stay away!

349
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,083
So, you're MacDougall,
aren't you?

350
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,875
HHARRY]
Harry MacDougall.

351
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,666
Well that's the first time I've
given my name to an enemy.

352
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,083
I'm only gonna
ask you this once.

353
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,375
Why did the Kei Pirates
want the <i>XGP</i> ?

354
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:39,750
It was their ship in the
first place, isn't that right?

355
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,708
[GENE] Why did you wanna
have the <i>XGP</i> destroyed?

356
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,375
[HARRY] I don't ask my
employers for reasons.

357
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,166
[GENE]
Oh yeah? Who's your employer?

358
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,833
Well now-- Heh.

359
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:52,958
[HARRY]
I see.

360
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:55,375
So this is the
ship's main computer.

361
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:56,583
Hey!

362
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,791
[HARRY]
Oh, I've never met him before.

363
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:02,166
He just came to us with
a job offer, that's all.

364
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,208
[GENE]
Tell me about the <i>XGP</i> .

365
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,500
What's the whole
story behind it?

366
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,500
I really don't know
anything about it.

367
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:11,125
Hm... Well, the pirate
did say something

368
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:14,000
about being involved with
the Galactic Leyline.

369
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:16,583
What did he say about it?

370
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:17,958
[HARRY laughs]

371
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:20,958
[HARRY] I'm gonna trash
this thing in one minute.

372
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,000
Huh?

373
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,541
A woman?

374
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,750
[gasps]

375
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,083
No don't! Stay away!

376
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:35,666
[laughing]

377
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,000
I don't believe this!

378
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,833
Huh? What are you doing?!
You sick bastard!

379
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:43,166
[laughing]

380
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:49,458
Shit!

381
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:53,875
[screaming]

382
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,875
Ah! My arm.

383
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:59,708
I can't believe it!
You shot my arm!

384
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:05,000
Oh... Are you okay?

385
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,333
Yes, Jim.

386
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,958
[GILLIAM] The access seems
to have been cut off.

387
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,750
[GENE]
What does the <i>XGP</i> have to do

388
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:13,333
with the Galactic Leyline, huh?

389
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:16,083
I don't know... I don't know!

390
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,750
All right then, tell me this.

391
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:20,208
Why'd you destroy my
father's ship six years ago?

392
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:21,625
I don't know.

393
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:24,333
Six years ago, I was
only 12 years old.

394
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,250
Hey! You're a MacDougall.

395
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:29,250
And I keep on hearing about
the MacDougall Brothers.

396
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,416
Since you were just too
young to remember,

397
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,083
I don't mind asking your
brother, ya understand?

398
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,125
[HARRY]
Wait! Wait a minute!

399
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:39,500
Come to think of it...
where is your brother?

400
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:40,875
[JIM]
Gene! We've got a problem!

401
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:42,958
There's another one!
Another <i>El Dorado</i> !

402
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,583
How can that be?!

403
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,583
[JIM]
Get back here now!

404
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,791
Whaddya know... The brother.

405
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:58,083
Harry, what's the matter?
What happened?

406
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,000
Come on, answer me, Harry!

407
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:04,458
I'll blow' em to smithereens!
I'll blow 'em to smithereens!

408
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,416
I'll blow 'em to smithereens!

409
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,166
[GILLIAM] Well, that
finally solves the mystery.

410
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,666
They didn't fly
circles around us

411
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,458
because they were
more maneuverable;

412
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,166
there was another ship.

413
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,166
This is no time for analysis!

414
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,333
Gene, I'm pullin'
out the assault bolt!

415
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:30,083
Turns out that other guy
is the real MacDougall.

416
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:31,666
What do you mean, "real"?

417
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,916
It's his older brother.

418
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,666
You're not getting away!

419
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:44,625
Ah, damn it!

420
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:57,833
[GILLIAM]
We're in danger.

421
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,541
Please take evasive measures.

422
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,375
Ah, shit!

423
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:10,083
You're hurting me, Ron! Stop!

424
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:12,666
Ow! My arm! My arm, my arm!

425
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,125
[RON]
Calm down, Harry. Calm down!

426
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,375
If you're a MacDougall man,

427
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:19,083
you don't get upset over
a stupid little scratch.

428
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:20,791
Right... I'm...

429
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,416
I'm so sorry, brother.

430
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,666
Hey... It's all right, Harry.

431
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,125
We're gonna do
a whole lot worse

432
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:27,750
to the man who's
done this to you.

433
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:29,958
[HARRY] You're right, and
I promise I won't back down

434
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:31,375
like that again.

435
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:35,666
[HARRY]
The woman...

436
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,583
That woman.

437
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:41,708
[JIM] It's hopeless. I'm not
picking them up anywhere.

438
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:43,500
[GILLIAM]
Enemy ship lost.

439
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:45,625
Okay, now what?

440
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:47,166
Like we have much choice.

441
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,625
We just go back to
Heifong and try again.

442
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:51,416
Sorry about that, Melfina.

443
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,666
It looks like I just
lost us another lead.

444
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,750
Huh?

445
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:59,041
Don't worry. It's okay.

446
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:01,125
[AISHA]
Hey!

447
00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:04,583
Isn't about time you
guys picked me up?!

448
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,250
Boy, I never thought
I'd see the day

449
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:08,458
when I'd have to
apologize to Aisha.

450
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:10,833
We could always
leave her out there.

451
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:13,083
Nah, then she'd come back
and haunt me forever.

452
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:17,375
Okay, everybody, I'm tired of
this! You can come and get me!

453
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:20,083
[MELFINA]
Harry MacDougall...

454
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:22,041
What was he--?

455
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:24,541
I'm over here! Do you see me?!

456
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:26,458
I'm over here!

457
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:02,041
[GENE] It looks like we finally
get to take a break,

458
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,250
but then you gotta
work to live, right?

459
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:06,000
What's goin' on there?

460
00:25:06,083 --> 00:25:08,291
Animal search and pest control?

461
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:09,166
Okay.

462
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,958
I'll leave the rest to you, Jim!

463
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:12,916
I'll continue to protect
the peace of the galaxy

464
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,958
if I have to, all for the
sake of one single girl.

465
00:25:17,041 --> 00:25:18,833
Okay, I'm off on my date!

466
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:21,041
Next time on <i>Outlaw Star</i> :

467
00:25:21,125 --> 00:25:23,375
"Advance Guard
from Another World"!

468
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:24,833
You better get ready!
