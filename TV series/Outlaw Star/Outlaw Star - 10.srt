00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:22,458
[NARRATOR] The history of racing
in space goes back many years.

2
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:25,625
Before the development of
the Munchhausen Drive,

3
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:27,541
races were held
in the Sol System

4
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:29,958
using primitive spacecraft.

5
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:32,500
With the construction
of FTL craft,

6
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:34,958
the scale of the races expanded.

7
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:38,708
Even today, competitions that
descended down from them,

8
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:41,500
continue to take place
throughout the galaxy.

9
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:45,166
Spaceship development factories
and their subsidiary companies

10
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:49,333
risk losing prestige by sinking
funds into corporate ships,

11
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:52,541
while unknown Privateers
enter their own ships,

12
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:54,625
trusting in their abilities.

13
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:56,375
Whether they're
corporate or private,

14
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:59,750
pilots in the race are all
shooting for the same goal:

15
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:02,875
The fame and glory
bestowed on the winner.

16
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:06,458
It spurs them on in
these dangerous races.

17
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:08,291
These races have
become well known

18
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:10,416
for the difficulty
of their courses.

19
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,958
Not to mention the
speed involved.

20
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:16,916
Year after year, many ships
continue to participate.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,500
But the ultimate glory
is given to the one

22
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:22,625
who overcomes all
of these obstacles.

23
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,083
[CONTROL MAN A]
Attention.

24
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,791
This is the Spaceport
Control Tower in Heifong.

25
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,708
<i>Outlaw Star</i> , I have
you on my beacon.

26
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,958
Yes! We finally
made it to Heifong.

27
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,583
Since Heifong's
such a big place,

28
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:15,708
aren't the port fees gonna
cost us an awful lotta money?

29
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:18,000
Yeah, whatever. It'll work out.

30
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,916
Wow! This place
is pretty cool.

31
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,291
Come on. Don't get so excited.
It's embarrassing.

32
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,208
[JIM]
I can't help it!

33
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,583
[GENE] Man, oh man,
Heifong's a big city, all right.

34
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,125
[JIM]
Yeah!

35
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:50,666
[SUZUKA] So, Gene, where do you
plan on going to from here?

36
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,583
To the offices for the
Space Race here in Heifong.

37
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,166
Space Race office?

38
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,375
That's right, we're gonna
enter the <i>Outlaw Star</i>

39
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:58,875
in the Space Race.

40
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:04,791
[CLAIRE]
All right.

41
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:07,875
Now, the Heifong Space Race
is open to everyone.

42
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:10,916
The entry fee may be paid by
a business or an individual,

43
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,375
either way is fine.

44
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,583
And the ship's class
doesn't matter, either.

45
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:17,666
If you'd still like to enter,
I recommend that you do now.

46
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,666
There's one more thing
I'd like to know.

47
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,166
If it' would be possible,

48
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,750
I'd like to get some
more information

49
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,541
about the other ships
that'll be competing.

50
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,125
I'm sorry. According
to the rules,

51
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,166
you're not allowed to
investigate other ships.

52
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,500
But I'm only interested
in one other ship.

53
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:32,583
Well, I'm just not allowed
to tell you that, sir.

54
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,000
Are you sure you can't?

55
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,375
Yes, sir.

56
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:36,958
--[GENE] Hmph.
--[JIM] Aww.

57
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,958
Okay. Well, in that case,

58
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:41,458
there is one other thing
I'd like to know.

59
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:42,583
What would that be?

60
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,500
I'd really like
your phone number.

61
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:45,875
If I'm not mistaken,

62
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,541
I think you already have
this office's phone number.

63
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:49,416
Oh, I see.

64
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,916
Since you put it that way,

65
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,708
I guess I'll just call the
office when the race is over.

66
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,833
In the meantime, would
you mind doing a favor?

67
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,583
Tell us what we have to do now.

68
00:04:57,666 --> 00:05:00,083
Just fill in the necessary
items on these forms.

69
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,541
Our staff will conduct a
simple onboard check-in

70
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:05,166
before the race begins.

71
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,333
And anything else?

72
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:07,541
Yes, sir.

73
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,333
You must deposit into
an assigned account

74
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:12,833
150 thousand wong
as your entry fee.

75
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,500
I'm sorry, how
much did you say?

76
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,416
One hundred fifty thousand.

77
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,458
That of course also
includes the insurance.

78
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,291
Open to everyone, yeah right!

79
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:22,875
Come on, lady!

80
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,500
Even if you win the race, you
don't take home a single wong.

81
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,750
What private pilot has
that kinda money?

82
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,208
That's the stupidest
thing I ever heard of!

83
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,041
When participants
cannot afford it,

84
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,250
they simply find
themselves a sponsor.

85
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,708
Find a sponsor?

86
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:35,791
That's right.

87
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,291
The Heifong Space Race
is regarded as

88
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,625
a highly effective
advertising approach

89
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,208
by which many
businesses have found

90
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,958
they increase their sales.

91
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:43,958
However...

92
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:45,291
Yeah, what now?

93
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,500
Just so you know, it might
be difficult for someone

94
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:50,333
entering the first time to
be able to find a sponsor.

95
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,000
I know! Thanks for nothin'.

96
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,458
You just watch us, lady!

97
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:56,833
We're gonna enter this damn
race and we're gonna win!

98
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:59,583
I'm not really sure
how though. Heh.

99
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,708
[JIM]
Just forget about it.

100
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,750
I don't think we'll come
up with 150 thousand

101
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,666
no matter what we do.

102
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,333
There are two reasons we have
gotta fly in the space race.

103
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:21,000
First, we have to promote our
names, because if we don't,

104
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,250
the big jobs are never
gonna come our way.

105
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,458
You mean use it to
kinna advertise us?

106
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:28,166
Still, what good is the race
if we don't make any money?

107
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,000
The second reason
is MacDougall.

108
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,625
I heard his ship is here now.

109
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,041
What? Are you kidding?

110
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,541
The MacDougall Brothers
are gonna enter the race?

111
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,833
I'm not sure. I don't have
any definite proof,

112
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:40,166
but I thought saw one that
looked like his on the news

113
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,416
when they showed all the
ships entering the port.

114
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,500
[JIM] Are you sure
it was really them?

115
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:46,208
I don't think I could
forget that ship,

116
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:49,500
and I'm gonna enter this race to
make sure they don't forget me.

117
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:53,083
Okay, so now I know why we are,
but how are we gonna do it?

118
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,708
Hey, what do you think?

119
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,208
I believe in the expression

120
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:01,250
"Neither a borrower
nor a lender be."

121
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,791
[SUZUKA] I left three wong
which was my part of the bill.

122
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,708
Wait a minute.
Where ya going?

123
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:11,500
I haven't the slightest
interest in space racing,

124
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,375
and there's nothing else here at
the moment that needs my help.

125
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,791
But don't worry.

126
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:18,000
Once the race is over,
I'll be in touch with you again.

127
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,125
Hey, don't bother.

128
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,166
You sure about that?

129
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,708
I don't care. She can do
whatever she wants.

130
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,791
So now what're
we suppose to do?

131
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,791
I guess we're gonna have
to go to see our friend.

132
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,000
What? Uh-oh.

133
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:37,375
[FRED]
My, my. Gene and Jim.

134
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,708
It must be fate that has
brought us together again.

135
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:43,666
Actually, I'm surprised to find
you here at your place.

136
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,041
I, uh, thought other people

137
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,250
always ran your
divine headquarters.

138
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,625
[FRED]
If there is a god of business,

139
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:51,166
he's certainly watching over me.

140
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:57,041
We came here strictly
for business, Fred.

141
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:59,500
Come on, I already explained
this to you on the phone.

142
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:03,083
Okay, all right, calm down.
I'll be glad to sponsor you.

143
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,250
--Ah!
--Really?

144
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,166
[FRED] It's good
advertising, even for us.

145
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,500
We'll handle all your expenses
if you finish "in the money."

146
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,416
What's this "in the money"?

147
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,458
Is that when you finish
in the top three?

148
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:14,458
That's right.

149
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,083
But if you finish
fourth or lower,

150
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,958
you'll owe me even more money.

151
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,875
Ya see? What did
I tell ya, Gene?

152
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,625
Stop. It's all right, Jim.

153
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,166
Okay. That's fine.

154
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,750
With expenses, it'll come
to about 400 thousand wong,

155
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,500
so please have it ready for us.

156
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:30,750
Don't worry, I've been
ready for a long time.

157
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,958
What's that supposed to be?

158
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,125
[chuckles]

159
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:42,416
[FRED] When you're in
the winner's circle,

160
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,916
you'll wear this.

161
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,416
This way everyone will get a
the chance to see you in it.

162
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,208
It'll be worth the 400 thousand

163
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,958
and bring such joy to
my heart that I did it.

164
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,875
You are not gonna go
through with this, are ya?

165
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,958
Yeah, like we have
any other choice.

166
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,958
Fred, Melfina's not gonna have
to wear that thing, is she?

167
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,958
Gene, you shouldn't
bring Melfina here.

168
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:03,583
It wouldn't be good. This place
is much too conspicuous.

169
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:04,958
[MELFINA]
Uh?

170
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,166
What's goin' on here?
What do you know about this?

171
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,083
Oh, not too much really.

172
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,583
Only that the Kei
Pirates have been

173
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,125
looking all over
the place for you,

174
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,958
and are making a special
effort to find Melfina.

175
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,833
Oh. Are you gonna betray us
and try to sell us out?

176
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,083
Of course not.

177
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,916
Continuing to do
business with you

178
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,375
proves to be much
more profitable.

179
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,250
We're not gonna
let ya down, Fred.

180
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,791
Good, now let's see
what you're made of.

181
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,041
[GENE]
We'll ses ya later.

182
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,000
I hope you have a good
time watchin' the race.

183
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:33,166
When does the race
actually get started?

184
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,041
Not long. Thirty hours from now.

185
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,208
We need to get goin'.
We gotta lot to do.

186
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,666
Take it easy, Fred.

187
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,958
You better not screw this
up. I'm counting on you.

188
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,958
Well, well. What a shock.

189
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,666
I never thought I'd see the day
that you'd be cheerin' me on.

190
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,208
What I meant is, returning
the master's love for you.

191
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,083
Oh yeah, right.

192
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:59,291
[CONTOL MAN A] <i>Outlaw Star</i> ,
control tower here.

193
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,708
Negative return now confirmed.

194
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,708
This is the <i>Outlaw Star</i> here.

195
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,666
Yes, negative return confirmed.

196
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,583
[GILLIAM] Planetary launches
should always run

197
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,208
as smooth as this.

198
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,583
Big cities have
the best capabilities.

199
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,291
Yeah, but it costs
so much to park,

200
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,166
and we were only there
for half a day.

201
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,833
You can't do anything without
money here in Heifong, Jim.

202
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,500
But if you're willing
to spend a little,

203
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:22,708
you could find just about
anything that you can think of.

204
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:26,000
[MELFINA] Now displaying route
to designated start position.

205
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,333
I gotcha.

206
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,500
[GILLIAM] Proceed immediately
to start position.

207
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,375
Hey, Gilliam, do you
have any detailed maps

208
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:32,833
of the Heifong area?

209
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,333
[GILLIAM]
Yes, I do.

210
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,958
My library is on par with that
of a Space Force Cruiser.

211
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,291
Good. Go ahead
and get 'em ready.

212
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,375
'Cause we're gonna be
needing 'em for the race.

213
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,416
[GILLIAM]
Really? What race would that be?

214
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,916
And by the away, Gene, you
still haven't explained to me

215
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,791
why Suzuka didn't come
along on this trip with you.

216
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:50,750
Don't worry. I'll explain
the whole plan to ya later.

217
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,541
I don't see MacDougall's
ship anywhere.

218
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,416
You can tell all that from here?

219
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,291
[GENE] Believe me.
If he was here, I'd know it.

220
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:08,000
[JIM]
I think it's kinda creepy here.

221
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,000
Hey, listen.

222
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:13,333
Why don't we go check
out that pre-race party

223
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,541
that's goin' on now?

224
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,083
[JIM]
I'm there!

225
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,958
We left Mel in the ship, you
know. Are you sure she's okay?

226
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,750
I'm just worried about
what Fred said.

227
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,625
And since she preferred
to stay behind,

228
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,125
I figured that was best.

229
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,083
Maybe we should bring her back
some cake from the party.

230
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,291
I bet that she'd
really like some.

231
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,250
Gilliam, I'd like to make
a request to access

232
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:37,375
Heifong's largest data bank,
if you will please.

233
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:40,375
[GILLIAM] The most likely one
would be at Dailone University.

234
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:43,041
Just give me an extra
moment, Melfina.

235
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,333
And what specific subject

236
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,125
are you interested
in finding out about?

237
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,750
The subject is myself.

238
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:48,750
[GILLIAM]
Yourself?

239
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,666
What exactly do
you mean by that?

240
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,375
I'd like some information to
find out about who I really am.

241
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,416
Why was I created at all?

242
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,125
I want to know why.

243
00:11:58,208 --> 00:11:59,500
[GILLIAM]
Melfina, dear.

244
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,708
In my world, thinking
about one's self

245
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,458
is not permitted at all,

246
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:07,000
but I can truly sympathize with
how you're feeling right now.

247
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:10,833
And I will do all
I can to help you.

248
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,208
Thank you, Gilliam.

249
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,500
[ANNOUNCER] The Heifong
Space Race has now reached

250
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:18,333
its 13th year and has become
a truly auspicious event

251
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,250
with our largest field ever.

252
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:23,333
This year, it consists
of 13 corporate ships

253
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,125
and 29 private ships

254
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:27,041
that have entered
the competition.

255
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:30,291
[GENE] I wonder if
he's here somewhere.

256
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,750
[ANNOUNCER] The fact that there
are 40 ships participating

257
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,375
in this gruelling race,
merely for the honor of winning,

258
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:38,416
is a true testimony
to its popularity.

259
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,291
Looking around for him
won't do any good.

260
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:41,791
You don't know
what he looks like.

261
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,250
So? I can still look.

262
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,875
Come on, Gene. We paid big
bucks to be in this race,

263
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:47,875
so let's at least get
our money's worth.

264
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,458
Check it out! Don't you
wanna try a little? Hm?

265
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:52,750
Yeah, all right.

266
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,916
Ah... Hm?

267
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,166
Hello.

268
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,041
[AISHA] Would you like
something to drink, sir?

269
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,250
[MAN]
Thank you very much.

270
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:01,500
Hey there, sweetheart.

271
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,666
Can I get something to
drink from you, darlin'?

272
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,833
[AISHA]
Well of course!

273
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,166
[GENE] I'm thirsty for
anything you've--

274
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,125
Uh?

275
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:09,416
[gasps]

276
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:16,125
Umm... Hi!

277
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:17,791
[screams]

278
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,750
I finally found you,
Gene Starwind!

279
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:35,333
Umm... Hi!

280
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,750
I've found you! I've found you!

281
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:39,541
I've found you!
I finally found you!

282
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,250
Okay. What're you doing, Aisha?

283
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:44,458
This is divine guidance
from the God of Ctarl.

284
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:45,833
Thank you, God of all Ctarl.

285
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:48,500
I can hardly believe it.

286
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:51,000
Even though I had
absolutely no money,

287
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,041
I was determined
to track you down,

288
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,875
and so I hitchhiked all
the way here across space.

289
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,791
You hitchhiked all the way
across space to get here?

290
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,458
Yes! And it was hard!

291
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,291
I went to where the
ships were stationed

292
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:05,750
and when I got there, they made
me do all this heavy labor.

293
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:09,000
I drifted and drifted and
wound up here on Heifong.

294
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,375
And was so grateful to
get this waitress job

295
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,125
to earn enough just to eat.

296
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:15,208
And just as I was
pitying myself,

297
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,625
who would show up but you.

298
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,500
[AISHA laughing]

299
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,000
Well, well,

300
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,291
who knew we'd be running into
each other again so soon.

301
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,583
Man, I can't believe
what bad luck we have.

302
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,166
This is ridiculous.

303
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,916
Hey, you two,
stop your babbling!

304
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,750
I'm the one in control here!

305
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,458
[MANAGER]
Aisha! Behave yourself!

306
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,833
Uh... These two creeps--

307
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,916
I mean, gentleman,
were bothering me

308
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
and I had to take
care of myself.

309
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:44,166
That's enough! I'll talk
with you later. Hmph!

310
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,291
[AISHA]
Stop! Let go of me! Let go!

311
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,166
If you cause any more
trouble here, Aisha,

312
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,666
you're not gonna get paid!

313
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,083
[AISHA whines]

314
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,541
I'm very sorry about
that, gentleman.

315
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:59,208
Hey, that's okay.
Really, it's no big deal.

316
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:00,958
[GILLIAM] I'm afraid there
were not enough leads for me

317
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:04,000
to get any information
for you, Melfina.

318
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:06,291
That's all right.

319
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,000
Thank you for trying.

320
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,791
[GILLIAM] We could try
checking out the pirates

321
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,208
through the Space Forces.

322
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:14,333
But I think that's also
going to be very difficult.

323
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,875
It's okay. You don't
have to worry, Gilliam.

324
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,250
I didn't think I'd find out
everything there is to know

325
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,875
about me right away.

326
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,458
[GILLIAM]
Very well.

327
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:25,083
I am sure that we will find a
good lead eventually, Melfina.

328
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,416
Me too.

329
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,875
Gene promised me that
one day I would find out.

330
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,625
[GILLIAM]
Oh, did he?

331
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,000
Well, speaking of the devil,

332
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,458
I believe he's coming
through the door right now.

333
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,291
We're back! Hey,
Melfina, guess what?

334
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,000
We brought you a surprise.

335
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,166
Just for me?

336
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,541
[JIM]
Mh-hm.

337
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,500
Now listen, Melfina, we need
to re-supply the ship,

338
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,250
run a maintenance check,
and get some rest

339
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,000
'cause we start in 12 hours.

340
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,166
Okay!

341
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,583
[GILLIAM]
We start for where?

342
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,166
[ANNOUNCER]
Ladies and Gentleman,

343
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,666
the start of the 13th Heifong
Space Race is about to begin.

344
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,958
Participating ships
have come from all over

345
00:15:57,041 --> 00:16:01,125
and are now assembling
at the starting point.

346
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,083
Which team will win
the wreath of victory

347
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,333
in the Heifong Space Race?

348
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:07,083
[GENE]
We leave here from Heifong IV,

349
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:10,625
and head for the third
planet, Heifong III.

350
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:13,000
They say that it's
a binary planet.

351
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:16,291
Man, they sure picked a nasty
place to put that checkpoint.

352
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,500
Oh, it gets much
worse after that.

353
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:19,875
Next is the fifth planet

354
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,875
and then an orbit around
that gaseous nebula.

355
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,166
And then we pass through
the Asteroid belt.

356
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,666
It says that you can use the
checkpoint at either the first

357
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,208
or the second planet.

358
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:30,708
The course using the second
planet takes longer,

359
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:33,416
but the course for the first
planet is a little risky.

360
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,500
I like it already. Then we turn
around and come back to Heifong.

361
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:39,541
The trip totals
1.6 billion kilometers.

362
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,416
[GILLIAM] We're in this race,
so we may as well win it, Gene.

363
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,750
All right! Well it's good
to see you psyched.

364
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:47,250
[GILLIAM] That's because no ship
is even going to come close

365
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,375
to beating out the <i>Outlaw Star</i> .

366
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:50,833
You know it. Now let's show 'em

367
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:53,750
what the <i>Outlaw Star</i>
is really made of.

368
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,166
[GENE] I'm gonna hunt
you down, McDougall.

369
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,333
[JIM]
Gene!

370
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,583
This'll be all for nothing

371
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,375
if we don't finish
in the top three.

372
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:01,791
Don't worry about that.

373
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,541
All right, whatever you say.

374
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:06,625
But if we finish in the top
three, that's 400 thousand wong,

375
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:10,083
minus the entry fee, then we get
200 thousand wong left for us.

376
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,666
[chuckles]

377
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,500
[ANNOUNCER] The ships
will start one at a time

378
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,208
at two-minute intervals.

379
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,708
The first ship is approaching
the starting gate.

380
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,500
The <i>Blue Continental</i> ,
a private vessel

381
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:24,166
that competed in the last six
races, piloted by Earnest Blue.

382
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,500
[MELFINA]
All systems are normal.

383
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:28,250
The output of all
engines is stable.

384
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:31,750
We're number 26 in the line-up
so relax; it'll take a while.

385
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,625
Ship number seven in today's
competition is unique.

386
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:37,333
<i>The Niburu-Boribo</i> will be
driven in the race today

387
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,416
by Mr. Nubata Kunono.

388
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,750
He's here on business
from Ctarl-Ctarl.

389
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,916
Hey, he said that's
a Ctarl-Ctarl ship.

390
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,583
Oh yeah? Hmm...

391
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:48,166
Officer Aisha, how would you
like us to run this Space Race

392
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,041
like we normally do, or
perhaps some other way?

393
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:54,250
Until I give an order, do what
you want, but always remember

394
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:57,041
to think of my orders the
same as the empire's orders.

395
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,375
Right.

396
00:17:58,458 --> 00:17:59,958
[sighs]

397

What the hell is an Imperial
Official doing here on Heifong?

398
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,166
Chill out, will you?
We don't have any choice.

399
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,333
We can't disobey the Empire.

Just you watch, my fair friends.

401
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,833
[NUBATA] Well, I'm going
now, Officer Aisha.

Well, it looks like he made it
after and all just in time.

405
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:22,250
The <i>El Dorado</i> arrived late,
but now the ship has managed

406
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,458
to find it's place in
the starting line-up.

407

[GENE]
Huh? Oh!

which placed fifth last year,

00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:29,666
is a favorite this year.

410
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,458
Her captain is Harry William.

411
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,041
Harry William?

412
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,375
Does that mean
it's not MacDougall?

413
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,333
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.

414
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,125
I got caught in an
ether current storm

on my way over to the race.

The <i>El Dorado</i> is scheduled
to start in seven minutes.

417
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,583
Can you get yourself
ready to go by then?

Sure.

All right. Good luck,

Gene, now take it easy.
Don't do anything crazy.

432
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,416
You don't know whose
ship that is for sure.

00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,250
The <i>Bonaparte</i> is the lead,

465
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:24,333
and they're passing the
checkpoint one after another.

466
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,791
What do we think is
keeping our friend, Gene?

467
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:29,916
Patience. Remember, they started
in the middle of the pack.

468
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,666
[MELFINA] I'll match orbital
velocities with Heifong III.

469
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,375
Man, that's so incredible!

470
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,750
And the checkpoint
indicators say--

471
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,708
Oh, man! It's right
in the middle!

472
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:45,833
[GILLIAM]
Other ships are increasing

473
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:48,291
above their plane of revolution.

474
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:51,000
It appears to be much more
difficult than we thought.

475
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:54,000
[MELFINA] I can project
two routes to take.

476
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,250
We can pass through vertically

477
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,500
in relation to the
plane of revolution.

478
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:00,833
[JIM] Right! That's what
the other ships are doin'.

479
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:01,958
[MELFINA]
The other way is to

480
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:03,958
time the revolution
of the planets

481
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:07,541
and then you would fly straight
through the checkpoint, like so.

482
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,125
Okay. Which is faster?

483
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:12,166
[GILLIAM] Going through
vertically is probably safer.

484
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,583
Then we wouldn't have
to cut all the way

485
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,500
across the planets' orbit.

486
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,375
So which way's gonna faster?

487
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:18,750
[MELFINA]
Going straight through.

488
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:21,250
Okay, it's final. Then we're
going straight through.

489
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:23,291
[GILLIAM] Wait, there
are too many factors,

490
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,666
including the influence
of the planets' gravity,

491
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,666
their magnetism, and
their orbital velocity.

492
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,208
Look, it's just
like jumping rope,

493
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:31,916
except we're skiping planets.

494
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,166
We're gonna make it.
Let's get going!

495
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,625
Let's do it!

496
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:36,833
[GILLIAM]
Just a moment.

497
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:39,000
When the planets of
Heifong III get close,

498
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:41,166
a tidal effect will take place,

499
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:44,375
then causing sporatic
waves to be dispersed.

500
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:46,666
What kinda waves?
You mean like the ocean?

501
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,875
[GILLIAM] If you classified it,
it would be a metal.

502
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:50,916
What? I don't see anything.

503
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,416
[MELFINA] We've now entered the
area between the two planets.

504
00:22:57,416 --> 00:22:59,208
We're gonna go
straight through it.

505
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:00,416
Come on!

506
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:04,750
What the hell? what's that?

507
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:05,833
[GILLIAM]
There's trouble.

508
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:07,666
A massive object appears
to be closing in

509
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,708
from the first planet.

510
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:09,916
Hold on tight.

511
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,791
Wait a second, what are
you saying, Gilliam?

512
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:14,291
[GILLIAM]
It's probably a wave.

513
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:18,125
Uh, how do I get out?

514
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:19,416
[GILLIAM]
There's no way out.

515
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,708
No way?

516
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:22,083
[JIM]
Gene, the checkpoint!

517
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:24,666
I think it's gonna
be swallowed up!

518
00:25:03,791 --> 00:25:05,708
[GENE] I've finally
caught you, MacDougall!

519
00:25:05,791 --> 00:25:09,000
That guy thinks he's so cool
because he's good-looking,

520
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:11,958
but under those good looks,
he's not to be trusted.

521
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:14,666
That's the problem with kids
these days, I'm telling ya.

522
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:17,625
And then, to make matters worse,
that hysterical cat girl

523
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:19,750
comes over here in
the middle of the race.

524
00:25:19,833 --> 00:25:22,000
Is this exciting, or what?

525
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:25,041
The <i>Outlaw Star</i> is
racing ahead to win!

526
00:25:25,125 --> 00:25:29,416
Next time on <i>Outlaw Star</i> :
"Adrift in Subspace"!

527
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,125
You better get ready!
