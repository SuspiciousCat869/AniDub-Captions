00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,708
[NARRATOR] On the homeworlds
of most civilized races,

2
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:28,541
there exist ancient ruins
that defy explanation.

3
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:31,041
This includes Tarrans,
of course,

4
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:35,291
and also the Orogoriya
Ruins on Ctarl-Ctarl.

5
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:38,250
The Zabundre Temple on Corbono.

6
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:41,375
Piyoyronote on Silgry.

7
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,916
No one knows who
built these ruins,

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,291
or even how they possibly
could have been constructed.

9
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:52,208
And in space there exists ruins
that are related to a race,

10
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:55,750
yet a race of unknown origin.

11
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:58,250
Some researchers have
concluded that these ruins

12
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:01,833
might be the products of a
super-ancient, extinct race

13
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:04,458
and they presume that
the ancient ruins of Earth

14
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:08,166
and other planets may have
been built by them, as well.

15
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,958
But there is no
shred of evidence.

16
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:13,291
Remaining enshrouded in mystery,

17
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:16,958
the ruins still exist,
to this day.

18
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:02,875
[GENE]
Is that it?

19
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:04,708
[AISHA]
That's the Galactic Leyline?

20
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:07,125
[JIM] Look, how many times
do I have to tell you

21
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:08,500
that it's not the Leyline?!

22
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:11,375
Wait a minute! That's what
you just said it was!

23
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:14,666
In another language, but to us
it's a planet with ancient ruins

24
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,875
called "Dragon," or
"Way of the Dragon."

25
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,208
Right. And that's the Leyline!

26
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,125
If it was, then the survey team

27
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,208
would've left a much
more thorough report!

28
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:24,833
Come on, just give it a rest.

29
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,791
It's something we need to
see for ourselves, all right?

30
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,833
So, how about a landing spot?

31
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,041
[computer beeps]

32
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,583
How about the same place
as the survey team?

33
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,083
The area down there
is level enough,

34
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:36,583
so it shouldn't give
us any trouble at all.

35
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:39,041
Okay, prepare for landing.

36
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,916
[GENEG]
Man, nothing here at all.

37
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,083
It's no wonder that they
haven't gotten any immigrants.

38
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,041
So, tell us, where it is, Jim?

39
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,500
Boy, you're really pathetic.

40
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,458
Can't you do
anything without me?

41
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:01,625
Well, you said you were the
one that found it, right?

42
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,750
Right, but it was tough
enough to hack into the

43
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,416
Space Archaeology
Society's database.

44
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,375
I mean, it was suppressed like
it was top secret or something.

45
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,250
You could show a
little gratitude, maybe?

46
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,416
Got it!

47
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,458
It's about 2 kilometers
southeast of here.

48
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,250
Two kilometers?

49
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,916
Hey! Why'd you take us
all the way down here

50
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,875
when we're so far away?

51
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:26,333
[JIM grunts] Are you good
enough to land that thing,

52
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:27,833
no matter what the situation?

53
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,291
[GENE]
Hm?

54
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:37,041
[GENE] Okay, whaddya say
we treat ourselves

55
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,708
to a little hike, huh?

56
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:53,166
[JIM grunting]

57
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:59,500
[GENE] All right.
Let's take a break here.

58
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:00,916
[sighs]

59
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,333
So, Gene, just what
do you suppose

60
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:08,708
the Galactic Leyline is, anyway?

61
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:11,875
Huh? Why are you
asking me that now, Jim?

62
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,666
I don't know, I was just
thinking that Hilda

63
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,583
may have told you
something, that's all.

64
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:16,916
[GENE]
She didn't say much.

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
She just mentioned that
the Kei pirates wanted it.

66
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:21,708
So, of course, Hilda's plan,
was simply to make sure

67
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,166
that she got to it first.

68
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,875
Which mean it's a treasure!

69
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,291
Yeah, right, it'd be
nice if it was.

70
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:30,125
Then I'd be able to pay back
all the money I owe Fred!

71
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:33,083
It's gotta be worth a
lot more than that!

72
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,250
[SUZUKA]
Aisha, how did the Ctarl-Ctarl

73
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,875
learn of the Leyline?

74
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,875
Nya! Well, we... That is, uh...

75
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,458
It's a state secret!

76
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,708
And I suppose you have no idea
what the secret might be, huh?

77
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,208
Aw, you only came because
you were ordered to?

78
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,041
Must be rough.

79
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,375
[AISHA growls]
Shut up!

80
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,708
[JIM]
Looks like were on the money.

81
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,875
I'm gettin' a little worried
about how much longer

82
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:57,041
we're gonna be able to keep
this friendship up with her.

83
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,458
What're talking about?

84
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,500
I'm saying we can't
forget that she's still

85
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,541
a Ctarl-Ctarl officer.

86
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,333
Don't you think it would be
best to confront her about it?

87
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,791
Well, to tell you the truth,
the same goes for you.

88
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:13,000
[SUZUKA] Are you saying that I
have some sort of short comings?

89
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,583
No, not at this moment, exactly.

90
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,666
And not ever to be
perfectly honest.

91
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,333
Yes, ma'am.

92
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,041
[GENE]
Hey, what's the matter, Mel?

93
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:22,916
[MELFINA]
It's nothing.

94
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,291
[GENE]
Come on.

95
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,250
When we find the
Galactic Leyline,

96
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:30,250
do you think I'll learn
anything about myself?

97
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,125
Good question.

98
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,833
To be honest, I'm not sure.

99
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:36,541
[JIM] What are you sayin' Gene?
Of course she will!

100
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:37,791
Isn't that right, Mel?

101
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,833
[gasps]

102
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,166
[chuckles]

103
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,833
We don't know for
sure until we get there.

104
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,333
I guess you're right.

105
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,000
Look, Gene!

106
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,250
[AISHA]
Hey! Over here!

107
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,875
I found it! Hurry!
Come take a look!

108
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,166
[gasps]

109
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,500
There they are,
the ruins of the Leyline!

110
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:10,458
[RON] They sure picked another
strange planet to come to.

111
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:11,708
Let's head down, Ron.

112
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:14,583
I'll make her mine this
time without fail.

113
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,666
Sure, that's the very reason why

114
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,958
we tracked them
down all this way.

115
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,666
We'll finish this.

116
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:42,833
Awesome.

117
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:47,958
[JIM]
See that thing in the middle?

118
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:51,041
They call it the Dragon Sphinx.

119
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:54,291
The line that leads up to it
is the "Way of the Dragon."

120
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:57,416
So the Way of the Dragon
is the Leyline.

121
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:00,625
After a lot of investigating,
the survey team had concluded

122
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:03,750
that it was probably made
about 10,000 years ago.

123
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,458
[GENE grunts]

124
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:09,791
[GENE] Why did the survey team
close down their investigation?

125
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:12,541
Apparently, the direct reason
was their funding had dried up

126
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,541
just before they could
get any final results,

127
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,583
terminating the exploration.

128
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,250
They also mention
that the Kei Pirates

129
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,958
were directly involved.

130
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,041
What exactly does that mean?

131
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,208
The pirates interfered
by completely cutting off

132
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,458
the supply lines of
the survey team.

133
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,833
So, of course, it gave
them absolutely no choice.

134
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,416
They had to pull out.

135
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,583
A place called the Leyline and
the Kei Pirates are involved?

136
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:36,458
Rather suspicious
bedfellows indeed.

137
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:39,208
[AISHA grunts]

138
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,166
So? What else did you find out?

139
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,500
Nothing at all.

140
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:46,125
It wasn't in the database,
I can tell ya that much.

141
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:49,041
Looks like the survey team was
able to check out the entry

142
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,291
chamber to that pyramid,

143
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,583
but there isn't one
single report about it.

144
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,208
Hey! What's does all of
this have to do with

145
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,750
the Galactic Leyline, anyway?

146
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,166
[GENE] That's why we came here;
to find that out!

147
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,375
So let's go checkout the
survey team's barracks

148
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:05,166
and see if there's anything
there we might be able to use.

149
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,041
Come on.

150
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,083
[GENE grunts]

151
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,041
I'm all ready, Ron.

152
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:22,500
Good, we'll wait 'til sunset,
then close in for our attack.

153
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:24,291
The woman comes first.

154
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:27,416
We can kill everyone else,
isn't that right?

155
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,666
Of course.

156
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,500
[growling]

157
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:45,375
[GENE] So...? What's so
special about this spot?

158
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,458

00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,750
Show your face!

Sorry, no one's home.

322
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:47,291
Next time, try calling first.

331
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,375
It can't be!

332
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,666
It's an earthquake!

334
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:37,583

Just climb on!

[MELFINA gasps]
Huh?

338
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,041
What the--?

339
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,791
Damn it! Hold it together!

I'm gonna miss this time.

00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,583
Come in, Harry! Respond!

[AISHA grunts]

347
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,833
Why'd a quake have
to start up now?

348
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,291
[GENE]
Jim! Go back to the ship. Now!

349
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:12,666
[JIM]
Okay.

350
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,708
[GILLIAM] Hurry, everyone.
You have to move faster.

351
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,291
It's a crustal disturbance.

352
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:21,208
If this keeps up,
the ship will topple over!

353
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,916
Listen, Melfina,
If you don't want to,

354
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,125
you don't have to go with us.

355
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,666
I would never force
you to do anything.

356
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,958
Once we're in space, you can
do whatever you want.

357
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:38,250
[JIM] Gene! Come on!
What're you doing?!

358
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,125
Take me with you, please!

359
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:50,291
I want to go with you.
Please, Gene.

360
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,500
Sure. I'll take you along.

361
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,625
I'll take you with me,
anytime, come on.

362
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:56,875
Thanks.

363
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,541
[AISHA]
The surface is still shaking.

364
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,541
The ruins are
nothing but rubble!

365
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,708
Well, Mel, it looks like
we'll have to find ourselves

366
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:21,416
a new lead.

367
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,208
[MELFINA]
Right.

Harry! Hold on!
You'll be all right!

371
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:34,875
Aw, Harry... what have
they done to you?

372
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,833
[GENE]
First up, re-supply, then rest.

373
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,791
Then we'll decide
what to do next.

374
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,708
[GILLIAM]
I have received a transmission.

375
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,875
It is Professor Gwen Khan.

376
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:56,416
Professor Khan? Oh, yeah?
Is it in real time?

377
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,041
[GILLIAM] The transmission
is direct from the station.

378
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,708
Oh, my! Hello! I've been
waiting for you, gentlemen!

379
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:04,666
Hm... Yes, I had a feeling
that you might stop here.

380
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,125
All right, Khan,
what are you doing here?

381
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:10,750
I could ask you the same thing.
I went to great lengths.

382
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:14,875
Finally I caught up with you.
It wasn't easy, let me tell you!

383
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,166
Why does he follow us

384
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,166
and how does he keep
finding out where we are?

385
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,416
Good question.

386
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,291
Did you plant the
transmitter on us or what?

387
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:24,041
Oh, my! How did you know that?

388
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,416
[GENE]
What do you mean?

389
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,000
I planted a bug--uh, well--
it's not exactly a bug,

390
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,541
but it's something
like a bug, right?

391
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:32,791
It was back in the planning
stages for the XGP.

392
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,250
Hm... Since the planning stages.

393
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:38,833
But I devised it so that no one
would know about it but me!

394
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:41,958
Wait a minute, what do you mean,
back in the "planning stages"?!

395
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:44,500
[KHAN] Forget about that.
I have found someone who knows

396
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,375
the coordinates of
the Galactic Leyline.

397
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,333
I actually found someone!

398
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,333
Go ask the man, yourself.

399
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:54,333
The thing is, he's currently
incarcerated at Gehenna Prison.

400
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:57,083
Apparently, he's been
sentenced to 300 years,

401
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,541
and he's not allowed visitors.

402
00:21:58,625 --> 00:21:59,750
But, you need to go there

403
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:01,833
and ask him what the
coordinates are, Gene.

404
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:03,416
Yes, yes, you do.

405
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,375
What the hell are
you babbling about?

406
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,708
There's no way in the hell
I'm going into any prison!

407
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:10,625
But, Gene, he actually knows
what the coordinates are!

408
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:12,375
There's gotta be
somebody else besides him

409
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:13,958
who knows the damn coordinates!

410
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,708
Yes, but understand, Gene, those
"somebodies" are high-ranking

411
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:20,166
Kei Pirates and I really don't
want to get involved with them.

412
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,416
I simply can't get
involved with them.

413
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,833
Then I'll get involved.

414
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:26,041
I prefer not to listen to
that fishy story of yours,

415
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:28,750
otherwise I might find
myself drowning somewhere.

416
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:30,458
Gilliam prepare to Launch.

417
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:32,583
[GILLIAM] All ready?!
But we just got here!

418
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:34,083
Wait a moment! Are you crazy?!

419
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:35,833
I've already made up my mind!

420
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:38,458
All this time, we've stayed
away from the Kei territory,

421
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:39,916
doing nothing but avoiding it!

422
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,791
Now, I'm gonna go there
and make 'em tell us

423
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:43,541
the secret of the
Galactic Leyline!

424
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,625
[KHAN] No, you mustn't,
you fool! Listen to me!

425
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:46,375
[GENE]
Forget it!

426
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:47,750
Melfina, listen!

427
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:48,833
[MELFINA gasps]

428
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:51,000
[KHAN]
Leyline Project command input!

429
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:53,708
"It was you who broke
my Meissen plate"!

430
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:56,583
Melfina?

431
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:59,708
I was the one who created her
control system and commands,

432
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:00,750
from the beginning.

433
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:03,250
I have now suspended
her personality.

434
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:05,125
What the hell do you
think you're doing?!

435
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:07,416
Turn her back to normal, now!

436
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,666
Oh, I will. Don't worry.

437
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,541
Once you go to the prison,
meet with the man

438
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:14,083
and find out the Galactic
Leyline's coordinates.

439
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:16,041
You bastard!

440
00:24:55,791 --> 00:24:58,291
[GENE] All I have on my criminal
record are some worthless fines

441
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:00,750
that I paid off in jail,
but these guys that here

442
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:03,208
in this gravity
prison are no joke!

443
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:06,333
They're strong, fast, have a
nasty look in their eyes,

444
00:25:06,416 --> 00:25:08,375
and the damn warden's a sadist!

445
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:10,166
As I infiltrate the
prison in search of

446
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,375
the Leyline's coordinates,

447
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:13,750
my chastity is being
put in danger!

448
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:17,958
Huh? Wait a minute!
Nobody said anything about that!

449
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:19,875
Next time, on <i>Outlaw Star</i> :

450
00:25:19,958 --> 00:25:23,416
"Gravity Jail Break."
You better get ready!
