[NARRATOR]
The Toward Star World

2
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:27,916
where Gene resides
is a measureless one.

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,083
Far away from
the central areas,

4
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:34,000
four known pirate groups
vie for supremacy.

5
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:37,500
One of the four is after
the <i>Outlaw Star</i> and Melfina,

6
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:39,208
to destroy them.

7
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:42,458
This particular group are
pirates of the Hoppo System.

8
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:45,000
They are called the
Hundred and Eight Suns.

9
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:48,416
The most brutal member
of the Chinese Guild.

10
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:52,375
[NARRATOR]
Centered around Tendo,

11
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:54,208
the Hundred and Eight
Suns are made up

12
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:57,125
of small groups of 10 or 20.

13
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:00,083
[NARRATOR]
The leaders of these groups

14
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:02,208
control independent
organizations

15
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:06,291
and they also pursue
their own interests.

16
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:08,458
Presently, the boss
of the pirates

17
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:11,791
who is now pursuing
Gene is called Hazanko.

18
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:14,541
He has power within the
Hundred and Eight stars,

19
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:17,083
but because of the
extent of that power,

20
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:19,166
his organization and
the power of the methods

21
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,416
he employs to achieve his goals,

22
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:26,333
it is said that the other
leaders consider him superior.

23
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:30,125
It is also said that the squads
that carry out his orders

24
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:33,333
use a super power
called Senjutsu

25
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:37,416
and always slay those
who stand against him.

26
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,666
[GENE]
Are you ready Gilliam?

27
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,083
[GILLIAM]
Ready.

28
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,708

Let's do it.

29
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,333
Activating all sensor systems.

30
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:26,125
CFS... activated.

00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,541
Radar... activated.

32
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,458
[GILLIAM]
All sensors are functioning.

[GILLIAM] Navigation system
active. All systems green.

Gravity cycle unit
activated. Go.

38
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,458

The Newton reactor comes first.

[GILLIAM]
Newton reactor now activating.

Sub-reactor 1 operational...

And number two.

43
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:58,916
Number three abnormal.

44
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,750
What?!

45
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,208

Output falling.

70... 50...

47
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,416
What do I do Gilliam?

48
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,166
[GILLIAM] Run a power balance
with the remaining reactors.

49
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,500
[GENE]
Oh, yeah.

50
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,708

Reactors 2 and 4 output.

51

120... 130... 140... 160.. 180.

52
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,041
They are about to
explode right now.

53

Huh? What?!

00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:22,208

T minus 10 to critical.

10... 9... 8...

56
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,833
Oh, no! Gilliam.

[GILLIAM]
...6... 5... 4... 3... 2...

58
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,625
[GILLIAM]
Another failed liftoff I see.

59
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,666
You're the one who
made me screw up!

60
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,708
Every stinkin' time
you make trouble.

are what simulations are for.

If you are unable
to manually respond

64
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,250
to a small problem like this,

65
00:04:56,333 --> 00:05:00,208
a liftoff is probably out of
the question for the time being.

66
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,333
Bite me!

67
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:14,416
[GILLIAM] Well the ship hasn't
been completely outfitted yet,

68
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,166
so I suppose there's no rush.

69
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,458
[GENE]
Oh, well...

70
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,875
Looks like I'd better
get back to work.

Oh! Welcome Back!

74
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,000
So, anything new?

00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,583
No. Not really. Ah! Oh!

76
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:57,583
What about Jim?

77
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:58,625
[MELFINA]
At the police station.

78

Police station?!

79
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:02,833
Yes. Apparently they
impounded Jim's car.

Hm...

I definitely don't like this.

[JIM] They said she'd racked
up too many parking tickets.

I tried hard to come
up with an excuse.

[GENE]
You should've just told them

that we were attacked
by pirates.

[JIM]
No way!

They never would
have believed me.

100

You don't even know
how much the fines

and the towing costs
added up to be.

I can't believe you

Yeah, it's good to
see you too, Clyde.

107

I heard that some
pirates were after you,

108
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,041
so I just assumed that, um--

what have you been up to?

Mm! You're bad. Hm.

Oh! And who are you?

Clyde, has anyone been
asking questions about us?

I mean, questions they
shouldn't be asking?

126
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:55,458
Well, after that fight, it's
been pretty busy in here.

127
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,625
But nobody's asked any
important questions.

128

[GENE]
Hmm.

129
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,166
I sure do not like this.

[music plays]

133
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:10,083
It seems like such a long time,

134
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:14,250
but it hasn't even been two
whole weeks since we left here.

135
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,333
So, now what are we gonna do?

136
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:17,750
Well, the rest of the
rest of the containers

we ordered from Fred
should be coming tomorrow.

00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,583
We have to get the <i>Outlaw Star</i>
into perfect working order.

[JIM] Well, yeah that'd
be nice, but...

140
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:26,833
But what?

141
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:28,958
To be blunt, idiot,
we are broke!

Whaddya mean? The account?!

143

Well, yeah, there's
not much left.

144

took up a lotta dough.

No way! Hm.

146
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,833
[JIM]
One, we earn money the hard way.

147
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:42,666
But, then I wouldn't have time
to work on the <i>Outlaw Star</i> .

148
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,625

credit here, you know.

162
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,250
--[JIM] Oh, man...
--[GENE] Oh, great.

163
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,625
[JIM] Well, it's gotta
be number one then.

164
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,750
Yeah, what about
the <i>Outlaw Star</i> ?

165
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,500
I'll leave that to you.

166
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:21,666
I'll earn us enough to live
on for the time being.

167
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,750
I don't know.

168
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,625
[MELFINA]
Um...

169
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:28,291
If there's anything I can
do to help, please tell me.

170
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,833
Are you good at cooking eggs?

171
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,125
Oh?

172
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm not really sure.

173
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,833
I never cooked them before,
so I don't know.

174
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,208
Well, then you can learn now.

175
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,708
You're on kitchen
duty Melfina. Heh.

176
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,916
Um... Kay.

177
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,833
[GENE] Man, there's nothing
as relaxing as this town.

178
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:49,666
Yeah, yeah. Hm...

179
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,083
[GENE]
But.

180
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:54,125
You know, we're gonna have
to leave here pretty soon.

181
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,375
Yeah, I know.

182
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,208
But how far?

183
00:09:57,291 --> 00:10:01,375
Where're we going
and just how far away.

184
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,875
It's nice to look up
at the sky and all, but,

185
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,750
let's watch where
we're stepping.

186
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,875
Hey, you know it'll be tough.

187
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,291
Yeah I know that all right.

188
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,250
[GENE grunting]

189
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,958
[GENE]
What's wrong? You can't sleep?

190
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,500
[MELFINA]
No.

191
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:45,333
Hey, I bet you wish bio-androids
didn't have to be so human,

192
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,125
is that what you're
thinkin' about, huh?

193
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,333
Yeah, that's right.

194
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:55,291
[GENE] Jeez, I don't understand
anything around here.

195
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,041
Let me stay like this
until I fall asleep.

196
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:04,000
When I'm like this,
I feel like I can dream.

197
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,541
I feel like I am dreaming.

198
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:07,875
[GENE]
Oh.

199
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:26,416
Hey, what do you think
you're doin' scumbag?

200
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,916
Oh, I, uh, I...
just thought I'd see

201
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,291
how human Melfina really is.

202
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:34,458
Just how human is she, hmm?

203
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:36,750
Mel's more human than you.

204
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,750
[GENE groans]

205
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:39,708
Hey, Jim!

206
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:40,541
Uh?

207
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:43,291
[JIM]
She's like my mom.

208
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,708
[sighs]

209
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,875
[GILLIAM] The engine covers
are not regulation parts.

210
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,791
So please replace them all.

211
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,750
Yeah, well, how about
helpin' out, huh?

212
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,375
[GILLIAM]
If we were in zero-G,

213
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,416
I would be able to
perform heavy labor,

214
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,000
but as you can see I am
powerless in this gravity.

215
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,041
Then work on the interior!

216
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,833
[GILLIAM]
I am of course.

217
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,833
[GILLIAM]
Please perform a check later.

218
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,750
[GENE]
All right, all right.

219
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,625
[DOCK SUPERVISOR]
Mister Starwind!

220
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:25,666
Yeah, what?

221
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,791
[DOCK SUPERVISOR]
We need to talk.

222
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,625
Could you come to
the business office?

223
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:29,750
[sighs]

224
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,875
I knew this was coming.

225
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:34,041
Give me a minute, okay?

226
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,291
Once it comes to a boil,
reduce heat,

227
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,666
simmer till cooked through. Huh.

228
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:49,666
[JIM]
This thing's a goner.

229
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,666
I'm gonna have to
put in a new engine

230
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,500
or buy new parts for
just about everything!

231
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,708
[FARMER] If I had that kind of
money, I'd take it to a dealer.

232
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:58,375
Yes, my friend!

233
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:01,250
This is exactly when Starwind
and Hawking Enterprises

234
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,833
can really do it's thing.

235
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:06,333
Actually, we have an engine that
we happened to come across.

236
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,916
Of course, we'd charge
far less than a dealer.

237
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,250
[FARMER] Great! I knew it!
I knew I could count on you.

238
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,208
[JIM]
You bet, pal!

239
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,250
[DOCK SUPERVISOR]
I thought that I asked you

240
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,958
to pay all of the dock
fees in advance.

241
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,791
And if you're going to
be here for a while,

242
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,291
I must insist that
you pay for that too.

243
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,166
[GENE] We've paid you for
the next three days, right?

244
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,916
Well, you haven't applied
for launch clearance, I see.

245
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,625
We will pay you for
any overage, okay?

246
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,791
Just how much longer
will you be here?

247
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,708
I'm... not sure.

248
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,875
[GILLIAM] Warning!
That is not the captain...

249
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:57,666
[GILLIAM]
Gene.

250
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,833
Gilliam, what's goin' on?

251
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,416
[GILLIAM]
It's an intruder!

252

[door clicks]

253

Hey, welcome back! Huh?

254
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,625
[GENE]
Gilliam, where's the intruder?

255
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:32,416
[GILLIAM]
He's escaping by elevator two.

256
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,291
[GILLIAM]
Gene! Above you!

257
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,833

[MELFINA]
Oh!

261
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:26,083
[SUZUKA] I come to visit Gene
Starwind and what do I find.

262
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,958
Some of the most
interesting people

263
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,583
are trying to kill him as well.

264
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,916
Tell me, are you a Kei Pirate?

265
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,541
Don't interfere.

266
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,916
[SUZUKA]
Exactly what I was thinking.

267
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,166
Gene Starwind... is my prey.

268
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,125
[gasps]

269
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,916
Stay back now.

270
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,583
Uh, right!

271
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:52,375
I'll say it again.
Don't interfere with me.

272
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:55,666
Well in that case, this is
going to be a fine opportunity

273
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,041
to put Gene in my debt.

274
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,166
I finally got to
blow off some steam.

275
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,833
You left some lookouts
here now, didn't you?

276
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:20,333
Huh?! Am I right, Mr. Pirate?

277
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:23,208

where is Hilda now?

278
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,083
[GENE]
Hmm?

279
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,958
You don't seem to understand
what you got yourself into now,

280
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:28,791
do you buddy?

281
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:31,791

Hmm? Is that so?

283
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,333
Answer me.

00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,000
Where is Hilda now?

I ain't talkin'.

[SUZUKA] Hm. So, you
are a Senjutsu Master.

287
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:20,291
You have interesting
techniques yourself.

288
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,666
Well, I'm just
getting warmed up.

289
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:27,250
No one has seen more than three
of my secret techniques.

290
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:30,458
You still have time;
it isn't sunset yet.

291
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:33,583
How many will you
see before dying?

Do you think it would
it be all right

00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,416
if I waited for
Gene in his shop?

I'd like to ask you.

Will you be a good
boy and answer?

My very favorite color's red.

320
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,083
[YASE]
Where is Hilda now, huh?

321
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,375
Why did you and your friends

322
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,750
come back to Sentinel
by yourselves?

323
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:28,916
What happened to my
people? Answer me!

324
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,333
What'll I get?

325
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:34,750
I'll go ahead and grant
you a quick death.

326
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,708
You'll have to make me a
better offer than that.

327
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:40,208
Maybe I will, depending
on your answer.

328
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,416
[CREW A] What could have
exploded out here in the fields?

329
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,583
[CREW B]
I don't know!

330
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:44,916
That's why they told
us to check it out!

331
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,750
[gunshot]

332
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,083
[CREW A]
That was a gunshot.

333
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,333
[CREW B]
Over there!

334
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:53,166
[growls] We'll take back
the XGP! Count on it.

335
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,166
[CREW A]
Call for backup!

336
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,666
[CREW B]
Right!

337
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:06,291
[whistles]

338
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:08,791
Huh?

339
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,166
Any witnesses?

340
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,458
Nah, no one.

341
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,541
Apparently they're scared
of getting involved.

342
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:21,208
When it comes to pirates, I
guess I'd do the same thing.

343
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,333
[JIM whimpers]

344
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:32,125
Mel! What the hell
happened? Huh!

345
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,375
Welcome back, Jim.

346
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,333
What the hell are
you doin' here?

347
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:38,750
You want Gene, don'tcha?!

348
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:40,750
Yes, where is he?

349
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,916
Oh, yeah, like I would tell ya.

350
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,125
It's in your best interest
to find him soon as possible.

351
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,791
Because it seems
the Kei Pirates

352
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,666
are coming after you two.

353
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,416
Uh! P-Pirates?!

354
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,166
It's all right, don't
worry. Suzuka saved me.

355
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:57,291
[JIM]
She did?! B-But wh-why?

356
00:21:57,375 --> 00:22:00,916
Because you people are
rather interesting to me. Hm.

357
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:09,250
[JIM]
Gilliam! Open up!

358
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:11,333
[GILLIAM] It's bad Jim.
There's been trouble.

359
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:12,958
We've been attacked by pirates.

360
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,208
Here, too? Where's Gene?

361
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:17,333
[GILLIAM]
He's inside working right now.

362
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:19,208
[JIM]
All right then, just let us in.

363
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:20,875
[GILLIAM]
Of course. Um...

364
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:23,083
Now what?

365
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:24,125
[GILLIAM]
What should we do about

366
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:25,875
that young lady you brought?

367
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:29,125
She isn't registered as a
crew member, you know.

368
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:35,875
Just let her in for
the time being.

369
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,000
[JIM]
Hey Gene!

370
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:47,250
Yeah, yeah, that's right,
the pirates were here.

371
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:48,583
What are we gonna do?

372
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:51,041
Well, we're gonna load up
all the equipment we can

373
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:53,250
and launch as soon as possible.

374
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:54,500
[SUZUKA]
Excuse me...

375
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:58,583
Would you please explain
what's going on here?

376
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:01,166
If you're really going to
fight the Kei Pirates,

377
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,375
I wouldn't mind helping
it out at all.

378
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:04,708
[JIM]
Hmm?

379
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:07,375
[GENE] At this point, all
we can do is fight them.

380
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:08,708
I don't know.

381
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:11,750
I just don't know
the real reason why.

382
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:14,375
I really have no idea.

383
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:16,000
Hey, Gene?

384
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:16,958
[GENE groaning]

385
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:20,041
Uh! Gene! What's the matter?

386
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:21,541
What's wrong?

387
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:23,000
Uh!

388
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:30,875
What? What the hell is this?

389
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:34,083
Uh. Yeah, I tried
to patched it up.

390
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:36,625
Guess I didn't do a good job.

391
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:39,208
[JIM whimpers]

392
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:41,250
[JIM]
Gene!

393
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:21,416
[GENE]
Ow!

394
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,583
Damn it! I'm the
star of the show.

395
00:25:23,666 --> 00:25:25,291
This isn't supposed to happen...

396
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:30,000
It is just a little too
exciting, don't you think?

397
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:34,875
I'm about to go into space for
the first time with no support!

398
00:25:34,958 --> 00:25:38,250
If I mess up, is the
show gonna be over?

399
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:44,916
[GENE]
Next time, on <i>Outlaw Star</i> :

400
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,750
"Forced Departure"!

401
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:48,625
You better get ready!
