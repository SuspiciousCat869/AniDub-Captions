00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:22,250
[NARRATOR] As vast as
the universe may be,

2
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:25,083
there is only a handful of
planets which enjoy acclaim

3
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:27,333
and notoriety as
tourist attractions.

4
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:30,916
Among these getaways is the
hot springs planet, Tenrei.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,125
Despite its Earth-like setting,
it's a favorite vacation spot

6
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:38,041
for a wide variety of
intergalactic races.

7
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:41,166
Lending to Tenrei's appeal
as a holiday destination

8
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,333
is its fascinating origin;
a history colored by legend.

9
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:47,208
It began over a century ago

10
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:50,041
with three pioneers who
ventured to this world.

11
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:52,125
Believing the planet
to be uninhabited,

12
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:54,791
they came here on a quest
for a mysterious power

13
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:57,875
called "mana." But instead,
their search lead them

14
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:01,125
to discover one natural
hot spring after another.

15
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:02,541
Seemingly overnight,

16
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:04,916
the beautiful sorceress of
the explorers transformed

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,250
the pristine landscape
of rejuvenating waters

18
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,250
into a travelers' paradise!

19
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:11,625
More than 100 years
after its development,

20
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:14,416
some say that the early
founders still live.

21
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,500
Only a tourist Mecca could
account for a story like this.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,458
[JIM]
Oh, whoa!

23
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,583
[JIM] Are there really supposed
to be wizards on this planet?

24
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:24,500
[GENE] I heard there were,
so here we are.

25
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:27,250
[JIM] But why's everybody
dressed like that?

Welcome!

All the delights of Hagone
Hot Springs World await you!

Huh?

00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,333
[BARKER]
Ha, ha, ha! Come along!

31
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,750
You'll need to take care of
some immigration matters first.

32
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:41,583
Right this way!

Hey! What's the big idea?!

37
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:51,000

How rude! Ahh! Uh.

38
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,458
Huh?! Ahh!

39
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:04,500
[BARKER] All right, everyone
ready for some fun in the sun?

40
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,416
"Immigration matters," huh?

41
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,083
[AISHA] All we did was
change our clothes!

42
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,250
[BARKER]
Okay!

43
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,541
Please enjoy your
visit here, everyone!

44
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,166
[FEMALE PA]
Attention.

45
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,083
An uphill train will be
arriving shortly on track two.

46
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,416
To ensure your safety,
please stand behind

the white line while
on the platform.

[JIM]
Hey, Gene?

49
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,250
[GENE]
Yeah, what is it?

50
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,375
[JIM]
No one knows anything about

51
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:32,916
any wizards on this planet.

52
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,875
Never heard of 'em.

53
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:34,875
[MAN B]
Sorry.

54
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:35,833
[WOMAN A]
I'm not aware of any.

55
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:38,083
[ALL]
No wizards around here.

56
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,916
They've gotta be here!

57
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Every time I went
looking for Caster shells,

58
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,583
people told me rumors about
these wizards who make them.

59
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:49,916
They're supposed to be on
Tenrei right here at Hagone!

60
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,833
[JIM] Maybe they were
messing with you.

61
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,083
[GENE]
Huh?!

62
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,083
[AISHA] Well, I can't
remember ever hearing

63
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,083
rumors like that
from Ctarl-Ctarl.

64
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,250
[GENE]
Uh?!

65
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,666
[SUZUKA] It's my
understanding that Casters

66
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,875
and their shells are the
products of a lost technology.

67
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,208
No one can create
them any longer.

68
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,583
[GENE]
Uh?!

69
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:05,666
Yeah, but what about...

70
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,833
...that old woman we met!

71
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,500
You must go to the
temple atop Mount Nantai

72
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:12,958
to find what you seek.

73
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,791
Ah-choo!

74
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,375
[GENE] I just know we'll
learn something

75
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,375
when we get to that temple
the old woman mentioned.

76
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,833
[JIM]
I dunno about that old hag.

77
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,750
There's somethin' fishy...

78
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,416
[JIM, GENE]
Ooh, wow!

79
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,875
[SILGRIAN giggles]

80
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,833
[JIM, GENE groan]

81
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:32,541
We're just wasting time now
that we have the coordinates

82
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,958
of the Galactic Leyline!
We should go!

83
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,416
Let me remind you that we're
here looking for Caster shells

84
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,875
because we have no idea what
to expect at the Leyline,

85
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,333
all right?

86
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,291
[AISHA] Well since we're here,
we may as well enjoy it.

87
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:46,666
[SUZUKA]
Yes, and by coincidence,

88
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,541
it happens to be on
the way to the Leyline.

89
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:51,041
[JIM] Fine, see if I care when
the pirates get there first.

90
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:52,375
[GENE]
Stop worrying.

91
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,958

screwin' around somewhere!

Yeah?

94
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,458
What exactly is a hot spring?

[GENE]
Uh?!

96
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,291
[JIM] Haven't you ever been to
a hot spring before, Melfina?

97
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:10,666
[MELFINA]
No, Jim.

00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,000
[GENE] Well, uh... a hot
spring is a place where--

[FEMALE PA]
Attention all passengers.

100
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,083
As part of our customer service,

101
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,166
we will now fill the train
with hot natural spring water.

By the way, wh-where's Gene?

127
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:36,916

We haven't seen him.

Huh?!

00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,958
You can bet it's gotta be
awfully serious then,

[ARK MANAF laughing]

140

[ARK MANAF]
I was just thinking

141
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,208
we don't get many
visitors here

142
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,750
in the inner temple.

143
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:24,708
And then you show up with
one of those old abominations

144
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,291
and red hair to boot.

145
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,708
[GENE]
Are you one of the wizards?

146
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,625
[ARK MANAF]
Wizard? I see.

147
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,125
Yes, perhaps that title
may be appropriate.

148
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,833
The old days when we once
called ourselves "priests"

149
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,250
are at an end.

150
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,416
Then can you really make
Caster shells for this thing?

151
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,583
I suppose.

152
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,416
I came here to ask you
for Caster shells.

153
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,666
Well, seeing as how you've
journeyed all this way...

154
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,708
[GENE]
Huh?

155
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:52,458
How about purchasing a souvenir?

156
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:55,916
Here's a Mount Nantai good
luck token, a lovely keepsake.

157
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,166
[GENE groans]

158
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,166
Or how about an official
Mount Nantai T-shirt

159
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,500
which will also bring
you good luck.

160
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,500
I don't care about that crap!

161
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,458
I just wanna know if
you're really a wizard

162
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,708
and if you can make
Caster shells or not?!

163
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:10,208
Hey, how dare you,
who do you think you are?!

164
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,166
I haven't even
announced my name yet!

165
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,291
I'll have you know
that I am Ark Manaf,

166
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,166
the twelfth head priest!

167
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,708
Ha!

168
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,416
Ah. Twelfth head priest, huh?

169
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,958
Yes, but that's all
in the past now.

170
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,458
So for the time being...

171
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,083
...buy something.

172
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,166
[GENE groans]

173
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:32,458
[TOBIGERA humming]

174
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,708
[ARK MANAF]
Originally, the name "Caster"

175
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,000
didn't refer to a gun,

176
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,750
but rather a wizard
who cast spells.

177
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:41,750
Long ago, this weapon
was called a Spell Gun.

178
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:44,666
Like Tao spells, the shells
seemed to have the same effect.

179
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,375
But do they possess magic?

180
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,833
[ARK MANAF]
Something caused the mana,

181
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:51,125
the mystical power of this
planet, to vanish over time.

182
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:54,250
We developed a technique of
placing spells into cartridges.

183
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,458
It was our attempt to
extend what little power

184
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,208
of the mana was left.

185
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,791
That was how Caster
shells came into being.

186
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:04,208
There are 20 types, each one
having a different effect.

187
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,041
[GENE] I've found 17
kinds of shells,

188
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,750
but I've never seen a
Number 4, 9, or 13.

189
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:09,916
[ARK MANAF]
Because they're rare.

190
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,125
A Number 9 is almost
impossible to find.

191
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,000
[GENE]
Oh yeah, why's that?

192
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,083
[HADUL]
Oh, dear me!

193
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,125
Ah, Lord Ark.
Is lunch ready yet?

194
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:21,041
[ARK MANAF] Only Lord Hadul
here can make a Number 9.

195
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,791
[HADUL]
Eh? Speak up, would you.

196
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,333
I can't hear very well.

197
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,541
[GENE]
In other words,

198
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,958
time has taken its toll
on the manufacturer.

199
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:31,000
Okay, so what about a
Number 4 and a Number 13?

200
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,458
[ARK MANAF]
I can make 13s. No problem.

201
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:34,625
But the Number 4...

202
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,208
[GENE]
What about 4s?

203
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,625
[ARK MANAF] Ah, only the
woman on Mount Nyotai.

204
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:41,416
[GENE] Oh, does that mean
I have to go there, too?

205
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,458
[ARK MANAF] I don't know.
I wouldn't if I were you.

206
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:44,583
Well, why not?

207
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,083
That damn woman!

208
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,833
That evil creature!

209
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:51,250
Ages ago, the three of us set
out to this planet in search of

210
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,458
the legendary power of mana.

211
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:54,958
It was a long, hard journey.

212
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,791
[GENE]
Mmm. Ya don't say?

213
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,458
Boy, that's interesting.

214
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,250
[ARK MANAF]
But instead of finding mana,

215
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,833
she discovered
countless hot springs.

216
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,500
She then ultimately transformed

217
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,791
this world into a
teeming tourist trap!

218
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:07,916
What's wrong with that?

219
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,416
[ARK MANAF]
Ahh! Plenty!

220
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,666
She banned men

221
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,000
from the summit of Mount
Nyotai, including me!

222
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:15,541
She lords over everyone,
like a queen over there!

223
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,541
She treats me like
I don't exist!

224
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:20,583
I haven't gotten the slightest
idea why you're so mad about.

225
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,750
[ARK MANAF]
Hm?

226
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,125
All right.

227
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,625
You want Caster shells,
then that means you're gonna

228
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,750
climb Nyotai for a
Number 4, right?

229
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,041
Uh... Yeah, right.

230
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,166
[ARK MANAF]
Take this,

231
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,666
and record whatever
it is Urt's up to!

232
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,125
And if you get any
chance at all,

233
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,416
shoot some dirty footage of her.

234
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,541
[HADUL]
Huh?! What did you say?!

235
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:38,708
Dirty footage of Urt?!

236
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:39,833
As in naked?!

237
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,458
[URT laughs]

238
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:42,458
[URT]
Mm...

239
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:43,625
[HADUL]
Hey! Move!

240
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,208
I wanna lay these
old eyes on that, too!

241
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:46,375
If you can show it to me,

242
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,375
I'll give you a Number
9 shell in return!

243
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,166
[groaning]

244
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:53,375
What is the deal with
this dirty old letch?

245
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,833
Ah, it's just one of his fits.

246
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,708
Oh, sure, climb the mountain,

247
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,875
bring the camera,
take some naked pictures.

248
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,833
I'll make you a Number 13
shell by the time you get back!

249
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,916
Just get me that footage!

250
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,625
[GENE]
Oh, brother...

[TOBIGERA screams]

254
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,666
[GENE]
What was that all about?

255
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,750
They say that Mount Nyotai
is an unspoiled hot spring

256
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,291
in its natural setting, so I'm
looking forward to this.

257
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:37,083
I sure hope the water in this
one is hot for a change.

258
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,583
Woopee.

259
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,375
I'm thrilled that you guys
can just kick back and relax.

260
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:43,250
Even though I don't have
time for such luxury.

261
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,666
Huh?

262
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,916
So that's Mount Nyotai.

263
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:16,166
Now this is what makes
hot springs so appealing.

264
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,375
Oh, so... this is what
people find appealing

265
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:19,708
about hot springs, huh?

266
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,416
[SUZUKA]
Most definitely.

267
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,125
[AISHA]
Meow, meow, meow...

268

Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow!

269
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,333
Ahh! This isn't hot!
This isn't hot at all!

270
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:31,083
Aren't there any springs around
here are hotter than this?!

271
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:34,958
I want a hot spring,
a hot spring, a hot spring!

272
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,041
Jim, hello?!

273
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:39,708
Can you hear me over there?

274
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:43,041
How's the water
temperature on your side?

275
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,791
Man, I'm really scared!

How come Gene isn't here
at a time like this?

277
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,291
I must be nuts.

278
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:55,208
I'm gonna freeze
to death up here.

Ooh!

00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,958
I didn't come here
for the view, lady!

290
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:47,375
[GENE] I am not gonna fall
for that trap this time.

It's Gene!

[SUZUKA]
What's the meaning of this?!

297
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,458
You're in the women's bath!

298
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,875

I'm not here for the view!

[GENE mumbles, chuckles]

Get out of here you fool!

[GENE]
Okay, this time,

303
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:21,250
I am definitely not
falling for that trap!

304

00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,458
Now this is more like it.

00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,083
[AISHA]
Huh?

310
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:53,250
[GENE]
Hot! [groaning]

311
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,291
[AISHA laughs]
I see...

312
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,208
...you came all the way
here to just to sneak a peek

313
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,375
at Aisha in her
birthday suit, huh?

314
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,666
No way, you're wrong!
I didn't come here for the--

315
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,500
[GENE]
Hot! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow...

316
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,333

to get him worked up,

317
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,750
talk about no control.

318
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:16,458
[GENE]
All right, now I really mean it.

319
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:19,791
This time I swear...

320
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,500
I'm not gonna fall...

321
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,333
...for their damn tricks!

322
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,583
Ah!

323
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,750
[GENE groaning]

324
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:34,916
[GENE] There's no stinkin'
temple up here at the summit.

325
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,458
[GENE groans]

326
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,833
[women singing]

327
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,291
[GENE]
Hm?

328
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,208
[GENE]
What the...?

329
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,125
Hm?

330
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:51,291
It sounds like women
singing down there.

331
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:59,416
[singing continues]

332
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:20,875
[singing continues]

333
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:23,416
Oh, yeah! I'm in heaven!

334
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,833
I gotta get in there!
How do I get in there?!

335
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,916
[GENE]
All right, I'm goin' in!

336
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,583
I'm still here. Huh...?!

337
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:41,625
[GENE yelps]

338
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:43,875
[WOMEN scream]

339
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,541
[URT]
Are you awake?

340
00:17:58,625 --> 00:17:59,833
[GENE]
Mm?

341
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
[GENE]
Hm?

342
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,208
Considering your gun
and the red hair,

343
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:11,166
I'll forgive the damage to the
roof and your rude intrusion.

344
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,333
[GENE] Then you must be the
wizard of Mount Nyotai.

345
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:14,125
[URT]
Correct.

346
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,833
And I am known as Urt.

347
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:19,958
Well, man with red hair,
please come with me now.

348
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,375
Come with you?

349
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:25,583
Why... What do you,
uh, got in mind?

350
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,583
[URT grunts]

351
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,750
[URT grunting]

352
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:32,833
[URT]
Honestly.

353
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:35,125
Ark and Hadul can
be such a bother.

354
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:36,500
[GENE] They said if
I don't bring back

355
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:37,875
some naked footage of you,

356
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:40,416
they won't give me any
Number 9 or 13 shells.

357
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,583
[URT]
And you?

358
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,541
Would you like to see
provocative images

359
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:44,625
of me as well?

360
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:45,916
[GENE]
Huh?!

361
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,666
[URT grunts]

362
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,750
[GENE grunting]

363
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:49,666
[URT]
Uh?!

364
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,000
[GENE]
Got it! [laughs] Yeah!

365
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:55,541
[URT]
Hm... And that's game point.

366
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:01,666
[URT] Since you won, here
they are, as I promised.

367
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,458
These are Number
4 cartridges.

368
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:06,250
[URT]
Hm?

369
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,500
Why don't we play again

370
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:10,958
and make the stakes that
risqué footage of you?

371
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:11,708
Huh?!

372
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:12,916
[URT]
And if you lose,

373
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,791
I get to shoot some
naughty footage of you.

374
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,166
It's only fair.

375
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,708
[GENE stutters]

376
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:18,791
I'm teasing you.

377
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,708
Yeah well, funny!

378
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,291
[URT]
Wait here for a moment.

379
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:23,541
[GENE]
Hm?

380
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:26,541
It won't take me long to
shoot some good poses.

381
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,750
[URT]
Hey, no peeking.

382
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,166
Sorry.

383
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,541
[ARK MANAF]
What?! Is it true?!

384
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,166
You actually managed
to bring back

385
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,416
some juicy pictures of Urt?!

386
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,250
[GENE] Sure did. Shot
by the lady herself.

387
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,791
All done. Here's the naked
footage they want.

388
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,416
[GENE]
It's all in here.

389
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,083
[BOTH laughing]

390
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:00,916
[BOTH]
Huh?!

391
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,791
First, the shells.

392
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:06,250
[ARK MANAF]
Here!

393
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,000
[HADUL]
Here!

394
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:07,708
[GENE]
That's it?!

395
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,375
Only one of each of 'em?

396
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,041
[ARK MANAF] A word of warning,
my red-headed friend.

397
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,291
[GENE]
Huh?

398
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:14,916
Those are very special
shells you're holding.

399
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,250
They're infused with a
magic that's much stronger

400
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:18,750
than any of the rest.

401
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:21,000
However, in order to activate
the shells in these times

402
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:24,333
of weak mana, a certain
catalyst is needed.

403
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,625
Like what? What
kind of catalyst?

404
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,083
You'd like to know?

405
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,666
I'm still waiting.

406
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,916
[ARK MANAF] It's the life force
of the one who fires the Caster.

407
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,958
[GENE]
Huh?

408
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,041
[HADUL]
Fire once, you'll be woozy.

409
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,625
Fire twice, you'll be half-dead.

410
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,791
So no multiple
discharges, huh?

411
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,708
[HADUL]
Yes, just like you know...

412
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:42,583
[GENE groans] I have more
stamina than the average man!

413
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,666
On to serious matters.

414
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,875
[HADUL]
Gimme that camera!

415
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,000
[GENE]
Hey!

416
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,250
[ARK MANAF laughs]
It's show time!

417
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,083
Woo-hoo!

418
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,208
[HADUL]
Oh, I can't wait!

419
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:54,166
Lord Ark, let's look
at it right away!

420
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,333

Hurry up! Hurry up!

Come on!

423
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,166
Hey, mind if I
hang out and watch?

424
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,416
[ARK MANAF]
Hm.

425
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,083
All right, you dog! Ha, ha, ha!

426
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,833
So, you wanna see
a little footage?

427
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,791
Of... Urt... nude?

428
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:20,916
[URT laughs]

00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,750

longer... Almost there...

433
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,500
Oh, you're such naughty...

[GENE]
Man, this is great!

00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:47,916

Show us more!

[ALL cheer]

439
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:51,083
[GENE]
Hm?

440
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:52,583
Hey, what do you suppose
those numbers are for?

441
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:55,208
[HADUL] Who cares when there's
better things to look at?!

442
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:56,666
[ARK MANAF]
Oh, yeah!

443
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,583
[GENE]
Yeah, forget it.

444
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:07,000
[URT laughing]
Are you still watching me?

445
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:09,166
You guys really are
the biggest idiots

446
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,708
I think I've ever seen.

447
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:11,500
[ALL]
Huh?!

448
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:15,916

[ALL grunting]

450
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:32,416
Bitch! What an attitude!

451
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,708
I should've known she wouldn't
do cheesecake like that

452
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:36,375
without an ulterior motive!

453
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:37,541
[HADUL]
Ah, yes.

454
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:40,625
But it was worth it.
I saw Urt naked.

455
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:42,541
Now I can die content.

456
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:44,458
[ALL groan]

457
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:51,250
[JIM] Mister, I'll take five
bean-jam buns, please!

458
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:54,416
Hey, Gene, what the heck
took you so long, huh?

459
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,625
[GENE]
Just take it easy, Jim.

460
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,541
I managed to get the
Caster shells, didn't I?

461
00:22:58,625 --> 00:22:59,708
[MALE PA]
A downhill train

462
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:02,375
will be departing
shortly on track two.

463
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:05,833
For your safety, please wait
behind the white line.

[TOBIGERA groans]

466
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:16,625
[GENE, JIM]
Wow! What was that?

467
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:18,833
[GILLIAM]
Well, it's about time.

468
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:20,958
You don't mind if I
launch now, do you?

469
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:24,291
[GENE] Right! Set a course
for the Galactic Leyline!

470
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:36,166
[ARK MANAF]
A red-haired man...

471
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,916
armed with a Caster gun.

472
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:44,833
[URT]
Is this a portent?

473
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:48,250
Will the universe be met
with another disaster?

474
00:25:23,291 --> 00:25:24,875
[GENE] Now that we're dialed
in to the whereabouts

475
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:27,458
of the Galactic Leyline,
we gotta go there, right?

476
00:25:27,541 --> 00:25:29,583
But it seems we're not the
only ones with that idea!

The pirates...

478
00:25:30,458 --> 00:25:31,666
And the MacDougalls...

479
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,666
Looks like we'll have
a three-way struggle!

480
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:36,291
To tell ya the truth,
this looks bad!

481
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:38,083
Whenever I pilot
the <i>Outlaw Star</i> ,

482
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:41,708
I've gotta lead <i>Outlaw</i>
<i>Star</i> 's fat in god's hand.

483
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:43,875
What a hand job!

484
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:45,958
Next time, on <i>Outlaw Star</i> ,

485
00:25:46,041 --> 00:25:48,000
"Cutting the Galactic Leyline"!

486
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:51,125
A warning, better prepare
yourselves for this one!
