00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:18,625
[NARRATOR]
Even in today's world,

2
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:20,458
where there are weapons
of mass destruction

3
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:22,083
that can wipe out
an entire planet,

4
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:24,125
fighters who believe
in only brute strength

5
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:25,708
and selfless acts of courage,

6
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:27,666
have not gone completely
out of style.

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,583
In every age, survival of
the fittest has been the rule,

8
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:33,083
no matter how advanced
a civilization might be.

9
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,375
And so, the Universal
Strongman Tournament

10
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:37,708
was the first competition
created to determine

11
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:40,625
who was the indisputable
strongest man and woman.

12
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:43,625
The events cover every
physical challenge imaginable.

13
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:45,750
Despite strict rules
to protect the lives

14
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:47,458
of these courageous combatants,

15
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:50,166
the fights are grueling
and savage to the extreme.

16
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,375
No one has ever in the
history of the tournament

17
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:54,375
won ten championships in a row.

18
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:57,125
However, the appearance of one
tough competitor has changed

19
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:59,208
the course of history for
the tournament forever.

20
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:01,708
Speed. Stamina.
Technique. Tactics.

21
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:03,708
And now, this
invincible competitor,

22
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:05,250
excelling in all of these areas,

23
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,833
has won an unprecedented
four tournaments in a row.

24
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:11,833
She is called the Ultimate: The
Strongest Woman in the Universe.

25
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:50,958
[FRED]
So what did you have in mind?

26
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:53,875
If you wanna borrow more money,
what do I get out of it?

27
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:56,250
I don't have the time to deal
with chump-change jobs anymore

28
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:57,625
if that's what
you're talking about.

29
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,208
Look, Fred, this is serious.

30
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:01,916
You're the only one
I can turn to right now.

31
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:05,416
[FRED]
Hmm...

32
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,666
Hey, now don't be so formal.
We're closer friends than that.

33
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,291
Have I ever turned you down
for any kind of a favor?

34
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:12,500
Then you will?

35
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:13,875
Of course I will.

36
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:16,125
But only under one condition.

37
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,375
I'm not gonna sleep with ya!

38
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:22,583
Ha! Please, but I only want
you to do a job for me!

39
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:23,666
What kinda job?

40
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,875
It'll take place
in just three days.

41
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,333
The annual Galactic
Strongman Tournament,

42
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,666
the biggest event of its kind,

43
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,625
will be held at
the Heifong Coliseum.

44
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,750
It's a no-holds-barred
fight between people

45
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:36,458
who think they're the
strongest person in the galaxy.

46
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:38,375
The winner goes home
with the galaxy title

47
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:41,500
in addition to a purse
of 100 thousand wong.

48
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,625
[GENE] And you're asking me
to enter my name and win it?

49
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:45,958
Are you crazy?
Your fighting poster boy?

50
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,666
No, that's not what I'm asking.

51
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,000
The problem I have

52
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:50,583
has to do with the
tournament's female division.

53
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,750
[GENE]
Women fight in this thing, too?

54
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,500
Hey, she's pretty
hot lookin', Fred.

55
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,208
[FRED]
Reiko Ando,

56
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,541
who's held the title of the
Strongest Woman in the Universe

57
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,458
for four years running now.

58
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:09,750
You gotta be kiddin' me, man.
A cute-looking babe like that?

59
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:10,791
Huh?

60
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,166
[grunts]

61
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:16,708
Ah!

62
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,708
I don't care what
you have to do.

63
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,208
Get the job done.

64
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,750
Keep her from winning
a fifth time!

65
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,916
[GENE] Guess I just
don't understand it.

66
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,041
What does it make if
this muscle chick wins

67
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,500
the Strongest Woman in
the Universe title again?

68
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,291
It means that I'll
have to marry her.

69
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:41,125
[GENE]
Hm?

70
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,750
What did you just say, Fred?

71
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,083
[FRED]
Married.

72
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,583
What do you mean?
What're you tryin' to tell me?

73
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,583
I'm telling you that I'm
gonna have to get married

74
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:50,291
to that hormonally-challenged
Amazon girl, okay?!

75
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:51,750
You gotta marry her?

76
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:52,916
Ugh.

77
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,666
[laughing]

78
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,458
Will ya cut it out, man?
It's no laughing matter.

79
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,958
So why are you making such
a big issue out of all this?

80
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,291
Why not just get married?

81
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,833
Have you completely
lost your mind?

82
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:08,875
Because I don't want to.

83
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,833
My inquisitive nature
won't be satisfied

84
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,291
until I explore other
amorous pursuits.

85
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,583
Okay. So what does getting
married have to do with

86
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:18,458
who wins the Strongest Woman
in the Universe tournament?

87
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:21,000
Luo family tradition says
that the women we select

88
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,666
to be our brides have to be
the strongest in the Universe.

89
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,208
What? What're you
talking about?

90
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,666
Properly speaking, it means
a bride who possesses

91
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,791
mental strength and
a high moral ethic.

92
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,458
But I guess that I
dictated terms to her

93
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,541
that were of a more
general nature.

94
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,000
[GENE]
Hmm...

95
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:36,750
So ya told her that she
had to win the tournament,

96
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:37,916
is that what you're saying?

97
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,291
I told her five times!
Five times!

98
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:43,000
Uh! I figured that she'd
never be able to do it.

99
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,250
But she won.

100
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,708
She has won every year
for the past four years!

101
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:49,250
Which means that this year
will make it five years running

102
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,583
with you as the prize waiting
for her at the finish line.

103
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,708
I'm gonna smack you if
you don't stop teasing me!

104
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,916
I'm asking you to help me!

105
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,458
Okay, take it easy! But you'll
lend me all of the money

106
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,958
with none of your shenanigans
if I win the tournament, right?

107
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,541
I'll pay the money
in full, as you know.

108
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,083
How's this much sound?

109
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,791
[BOTH chuckle]

110
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,583
Hey, there's no need to be so
formal with me, Freddy boy.

111
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,791
Have I ever once turned
you down for a favor?

112
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,000
Gene.

113
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,208
Okay, my friend, we
have ourselves a deal!

114
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,375
I'm counting on you, Gene!

115
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,791
Do you think you can
handle it, Aisha?

116
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,333
All you have to do
is get in the ring

117
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:31,583
and defeat that muscle chick.

118
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:33,083
I'm really depending on you.

119
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,500
Ah, just leave it to me.
It'll be a piece of cake.

120
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:38,875
I don't care who she is. I can
beat anybody in the galaxy.

121
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:40,583
The Universe is
a very big place.

122
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,083
I wouldn't be so sure
it'll be all that easy.

123
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,958
For someone as brave
as you are, Suz,

124
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,541
you sure sound like a worrywart.

125
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:49,958
For the last time, stop
calling me by that name.

126
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,625
Have no fear. Just leave
everything to Aisha!

127
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,208
I've already got a million ideas

128
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,916
how I'm gonna spend
the prize money.

129
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,750
Can't you get this thing
go any faster, Gene?

130
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:00,083
This girl is ready to rumble!

131
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,375
Why not?! What do
you mean I can't enter?

132
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:07,250
According to tournament rules,
it states the Ctarl-Ctarl

133
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,208
are not permitted to
enter the competition.

134
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:10,458
[AISHA]
Why not?

135
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,000
Who made up this stupid rule

136
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,750
that Ctarl-Ctarl aren't allowed
in?! That's discrimination!

137
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,000
F-F-F-Five years ago,

138
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,916
a Ctarl-Ctarl who
qualified as a contestant

139
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
in the final tournament
became overly excited

140
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,750
and turned into
some sort of animal.

141
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:25,333
And then she... pounced on her
opponent, pinning her down,

142
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:26,875
and bit off her right ear.

143
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,166
[yelps]

144
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,166
No! You're kidding me!

145
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,666
That's not the worst of it.

146
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,708
She was disqualified, but
that made her even more wild.

147
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:37,041
There were 984 fatalities.

148
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:40,583
5,379 were seriously wounded.

149
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:43,708
There were so many people
with wounds, we lost count!

150
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:48,583
It was a monumental disaster
that was totally unprecedented!

151
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:52,375
And so, ever since that day,
all Ctarl-Ctarl have been banned

152
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,416
from entering the
tournament, understand?

153
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,708
You can't be serious!

154
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,333
What're we gonna do, Gene?

155
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:01,916
We haven't got much choice.

156
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,166
If Aisha can't enter,
we haven't got a--

157
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,166
Suzuka.

158
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,000
[SUZUKA grunts]

159
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,291
Are you serious?

160
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:10,166
You want me to do
a job for Fred Luo?

161
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,000
Right.

162
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:13,416
Yeah. I just thought...

163
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,041
I didn't think
she'd go for it.

164
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:19,041
So I guess we're
all out of options.

165
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:19,916
I know.

166
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,125
[GENE]
Hm?

167
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,791
Why don't you enter
the tournament yourself?

168
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,833
What are you thinking?
I don't have any qualifications.

169
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,625
There's no way I'll
get away with that.

170
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,500
Well, now that's not
entirely true--

171
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,791
Whose side are you on?
Remember I'm a man?

172
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,416
Well now, wait a minute.

173
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,875
That might actually be
an excellent solution.

174
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:43,666
[GENE]
Huh?

175
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,291
Come on, not you too!

176
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:46,750
You have number of options.

177
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:49,041
You just have to
keep an open mind.

178
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,000
[GENE]
Hm?

179
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,500
[ANNOUNCER]
Ladies and Gentlemen!

180
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:57,416
Welcome to the 13th annual
Universal Strongman Tournament!

181
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,250
Please welcome Executive
Committee Chairman, Ikki Kazin,

182
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:04,291
who'll deliver the
opening address!

183
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,166
[IKKI] This message
goes out to all of you

184
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,125
who have entered the Universal
Strongman Tournament.

185
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,916
I want to thank you all
from the bottom of my heart!

186
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And to those 32 women
who have trained so hard

187
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,291
and who have assembled here...

188
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,000
I can't believe it!

189
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,791
Gene Starwind got dressed up
in that embarrassing get-up

190
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,000
just for me!

191
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,125
[grumbles]

192
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:26,291
[MELFINA] Maybe this color
would look better on you.

193
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,541
[SUZUKA] I think this
would compliment his eyes.

194
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:31,125
[JIM] We bribed that official,
so don't worry about it.

195
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,708
No one will find ya out.

196
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:35,750
Now get in there and make
us all some money, Jenny!

197
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,833
[GENE] They were loving
every minute of it.

198
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,375
[IKKI]
Who is the most powerful...

199
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,708
[AISHA] How long does he plan
on rambling on like this?

200
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,708
[GENE] You got that right!
Finish already!

201
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:44,416
[GENE]
Huh?

202
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,250
[AISHA yawning]

203
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,791
I can hardly keep
awake. Hurry up.

204
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,875
[GENE]
How did she get in here?

205
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:56,250
[IKKI] ...we will witness the
greatest the world has to offer!

206
00:09:56,333 --> 00:10:00,916
[AISHA]
One. Two. Three. Four.

207
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,250
[GENE] How the hell did you
sneak in here, you animal?

208
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,291
I told you not to call me th--!

209
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:06,500
Huh?

210
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:07,708
Gene?

211
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:10,375
[AISHA laughing]

212
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:11,958
Ya lose your pom-poms,
little girl?

213
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,166
Well bite me, Aisha!

214
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,291
You are in no position
to laugh at anyone!

215
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,875
Uh? I don't know what
you're talking about.

216
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,916
I'm afraid that you're
terribly mistaken.

217
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,250
I'm the mysterious
masked fighter, Firecat.

218
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:25,000
Any resemblance to Aisha
Clanclan is pure coincidence.

219
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,458
I don't even know her. Ugh!

220
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,666
We can see through
the disguise, Aisha.

221
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,416
I can't believe you fooled them
with that costume, Aisha.

222
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,000
Will you stop calling me Aisha?!

223

--[clang]
--Huh?

225

I tell ya, I'm the
real Firecat! Ah!

226
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,583
[AISHA laughing]

227
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:41,958
[GENE]
No. You didn't!

228
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,625
I did! Like it or not,
I'm gonna fight as Firecat.

229
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,083
I'll surprise all of you and
win this thing! You'll see.

230
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,458
Hey, wow!

231
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:49,958
You actually thought things
through for a change!

232
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,708
You're not taking her
side, are you, Jim?

233
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,458
What's the matter? You sound
like you're disappointed

234
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:54,708
or something, little girl!

235
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,000
This is good news
for you, Gene.

236
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,458
Aisha can fight her instead.

237

Melfina! Not you, too!

238
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,458
That a girl! I'm gonna
dominate this tournament

239
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,208
and restore the respect
of the Ctarl-Ca--!

00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,166
Hey! Pipe down
in there, will ya?

242
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,125
[sighs] Suit yourself, Aisha.

243
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:12,833
Please think this
through, Lady Iraga!

244
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,375
If Lord Hazanko
catches wind of this,

245
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:15,750
there's no telling
what he'll do.

246
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,500
He'll stop at nothing to
make sure that his orders--

247
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:18,625
Will you shut up?

248
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:19,791
You think I'm going
to let them choose

249
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,166
who the Strongest Woman
in the Universe is

250
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,041
without me having something
to say about it?

251
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,083
But that's not
we're supposed to!

252
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,916
[IRAGA]
I know that, Tubby.

253
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,166
I'll get them both soon enough.

254
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,375
Victory will be mine, and as
for that idiot, Gene Starwind,

255
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,041
we'll be seeing the last of him.

256
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,833
[ANNOUNCER] The first
match of the first round

257
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:38,375
in tonight's event

representing the Outlaw

And in the red corner,

00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,666
representing the Ando
comprehensive fighting style,

the Strongest Woman
in the Universe

for four years running,
Reiko Ando!

[CROWD cheering]

265
00:11:58,625 --> 00:11:59,958
[REIKO]
I'll win this tournament.

266
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,416
Nothing in the world can
possibly stop me now.

267
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,208
And I'll go home victorious
after winning the tournament

268
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,541
for a fifth straight time
as Fred's bride!

269
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:09,791
[shivers]

270
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:12,375
I felt like someone just
walked over my grave.

271
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:13,583
Huh?

272
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,375
I'm begging you now, Gene!

273
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,666
Please. You've just
gotta win this one!

274
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,333
[GENE] Hmm. This lady's
built like a rock.

275
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:28,958
Gene, get in there
and go for it!

276
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,041
Hey! Have you forgotten already?
Don't call him "Gene."

277
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,291
For today you call him "Jenny."

278
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,083
[AISHA]
Oh, that's right!

279
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,583
Ah!

280
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,875
Hey, just what in the world do
you think you're doing, huh?

281
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,416
Although it looks rock-hard,

282
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,666
it's whole lot softer
than you think, Reiko!

283
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,208
[growls]

284
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,250
Knock it off, Jenny. This isn't
the time for that right now.

285
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:51,458
[GENE]
It's all part of the plan.

286
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,708
[REIKO]
Stand still, damn you!

287
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,000
Can't you get serious?

288
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,708
[GENE]
No! I don't think I can!

289
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:58,250
He calls this a plan?

290
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,291
He's probably just
trying to confuse her

291
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:01,458
by throwing her game off,

292
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,750
so he can wear her
down at his own pace.

293
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,625
Their differences in
overall strength is immense.

294
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:09,458
[giggles] Yoohoo!
Over here! Over he--!

Ge-- I mean, Jenny!
Stop playing around like that!

296
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,666
[REIKO] Ha. What happened to
that terrific plan of yours?

297
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,791
It's working!

298
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,666
By the way, your
breasts feel great!

coming around.

Where am I?

The infirmary.

00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,500
What about the match?

304
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,125
You got your butt kicked, Gene.

305
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,041
How could you humiliate
me in such a way?

306
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,208
What do you propose
I do now? Propose?!

307
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:51,916
Now look. Just calm
down, all right?

308
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,041
[FRED] How can I be calm
at a time like this?!

up our sleeves, guys.

Unfortunately, that's
all she's good for.

00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:14,666
[AISHA] Triple-reverse
Andromedan Comet Kick!

She did it!

319
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,125
She made it past
the second round!

[ANNOUNCER] And the
winner of the first match

324
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:29,625
of the semifinals is Firecat!

[AISHA laughing]

326
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,250
What a piece of cake that was!

327
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,500
Oh please, Firecat.
Don't let me down now!

328

You're the only one
that I can count on!

You just leave it to me!

Yeah, just don't get caught with
your tail between your legs.

Well! If it isn't the
delicate Miss Jenny.

The one who got her butt kicked

in the first round of
her very first match.

[GENE grumbles]

[GENE]
Oh yeah?

The muscle chick ended up
winning the match, right?

00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:54,916
Not exactly.

339
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,958
Reiko lost the match, actually.

Say what?

341
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,333
[MELFINA]
She lost early on.

342
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:01,958
Nineteen seconds into the match.

343
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,541
It was a quick win for Iraga.

344
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:06,166
She's a member of the
Hokke Shadow Boxing Team.

345
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,958
That is impossible!

[FRED laughing]

349
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:14,875
This is great, Gene!

350
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:16,833
I don't have to get
married to Reiko!

351
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,750
Yeah. I'm really
glad for ya, Fred.

352
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,166
This is fantastic!

353
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,833
How 'bout we go out
and celebrate!

354
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,625
Now the only thing I need
is to collect my pay.

355
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:25,375
Your pay?

356
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:26,458
[GENE]
Uh-huh..

357
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:27,625
I thought that the
one was to be paid

358
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,375
when the work was
successfully completed,

359
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,166
if I'm not mistaken, Gene.

360
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,125
What exactly was it
that you do to earn it?

361
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:36,375
Well, I'll be looking forward
to our next encounter.

362
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:37,291
Until then...

363
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,541
Take care of yourself, Gene!

364
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,416
Fred, wait a minute.

365
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,166
Well, there's really
nothing to discuss, Reiko.

366
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,083
[REIKO]
No, Fred. Don't say that.

367
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,666
I'll start over again,
and train harder than ever.

368
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,916
I'll start trying to win
five in a row next year!

369
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,416
If you have a shred
of compassion,

370
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,083
won't you find it in your heart
to give me another chance?

371
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,125
Oh, well, of course I'll
give you another chance.

372
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,000
But I think you should
consider taking your time

373
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,416
before you start training again.

That's so nice of you, Fred!

You'll never regret this.

to be called your wife.

In the red corner,

[IRAGA] Gene Starwind?
What's he doing here?

Have to stay calm.

00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,833
The match has to come first.

393
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,416

I hereby dedicate this match

394
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,291
to the people of
the Ctarl-Ctarl.

What's the deal? Neither one
of 'em are makin' a move.

I understand that two
experienced fighters

00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:07,708
can judge their
opponent's strength

399
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:09,958
simply by facing each other.

Hey, Aisha,
pull yourself together.

408
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:46,333
I thought Ctarl-Ctarl were
supposed to be invincible.

409

Normally, this is where
I'd let you off the hook

finish someone off.

worried there for a second.

475
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,333
Oh no!

476
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,125
[gasps] What is that?

477
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:24,166
Yeah! Aisha!
She's won the tournament!

478
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,333
That's great!

479
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,666
She did it! She did it!
She's so awesome!

480
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:31,041
The Ctarl-Ctarl really
are invulnerable.

481
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,041
Maybe I should stop
teasing her for a while.

482
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,875
She really proved herself
to be a champion this time.

483
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:41,625
[roars]

484
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:54,250
I can't believe another
Ctarl-Ctarl snuck in the stadium

485
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:55,416
without even being caught.

486
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,291
You're wrong!

487
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:57,458
The Ctarl-Ctarl don't run around

488
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,041
with a low-class
wolves like that!

489
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:00,541
That's an insult!

490
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,458
I've heard the Kei Pirates
have an assassin in their ranks

491
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,500
who turns into a werewolf
when she's provoked.

492
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:06,750
I bet that was her.

493
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,166
[GENE]
A pirate, huh?

494
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,625
[JIM] More to the point,
what're we gonna do now, Gene?

495
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:13,500
We didn't get paid, and we've
used up all the bounty we got.

496
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,625
[GENE]
I don't know. My head hurts.

497
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:17,000
Hello. Starwind and Hawking.

498
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:18,166
[FRED]
Gene.

499
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,375
[GENE] Oh, it's you.
Whaddaya want, Fred?

500
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:20,916
[FRED]
Oh, nothing much.

501
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,333
So it sounds like you had a
little trouble after I left.

502
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:24,708
Listen, Fred,

503
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:25,958
I'm not in the mood to talk
to you right now, okay?

504
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:27,500
[FRED]
Wait a minute.

505
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:30,166
I was just thinking about the
other promise I made to you.

506
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,958
What other promise
are you talkin' about?

507
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:33,250
I promised I'd lend the money

508
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:35,166
if you'd agree to take
on the job, remember?

509
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,750
Well, I'm keeping my word.

510
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:38,000
[GENE]
Really?

511
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:39,416
I've already filled out
the transfer paperwork

512
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,833
you're going to need.

513
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:43,291
You should be able to cash
it tomorrow. Is that okay?

514
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:45,958
That's it for now. Bon voyage!

515
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:46,958
Thanks, Fred.

516
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:48,208
So what's up?

517
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:50,625
--[GENE] Jim.
--Yeah?

518
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:52,833
We're goin' on a trip.

519
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,750
[MELFINA]
All systems are green.

520
00:22:57,833 --> 00:23:00,291
Launch clearance
has been granted.

521
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:03,250
Yes! We're finally going
to the Galactic Leyline!

522
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:04,916
Okay, let's do it!

523
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,708
<i>Outlaw Star</i> , lifting off!

524
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:08,500
We're on our way!

525
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:52,083
[GENE]
We've been captured by

526
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:54,416
a renegade frontier
security agency.

527
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,375
Now they're subjecting Jim and I
to the ultimate humiliation

528
00:24:57,458 --> 00:25:00,750
by putting us on the night watch
for our archenemy, the pirates.

529
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,375
It's really hard to take
orders from someone

530
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:04,166
who's always barking
at you, ya know?

531
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:06,916
You gotta relax, Gene. Relax!

532
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,333
Oops, sorry! I guess I
nodded off for a second.

533
00:25:09,416 --> 00:25:12,916
Anyway, next time join us on
<i>Outlaw Star</i> as we explore

534
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,708
"Law and Lawlessness."

535
00:25:14,791 --> 00:25:16,166
You better get ready!
