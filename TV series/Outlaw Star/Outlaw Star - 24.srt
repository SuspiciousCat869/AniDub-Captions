5
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:47,958
The <i>Outlaw Star</i> , the
<i>Geomancer</i> , the <i>Shangri La</i> .

6
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:50,458
Very well then,
the cast is assembled!

7
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:53,083
I'll show you what
the Galactic Leyline is.

8
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:56,208
Well, even when you find out,
you won't be surprised.

9
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:58,333
You think you know what
it's all about, do you?

10
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:00,083
Well, maybe what
you think it is,

11
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:02,041
is only what you want it to be,

12
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:04,333
or simply something
that you want to know!

13
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:07,291
When the mystery is solved,
it's ceases to be a mystery,

14
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:09,125
and the curiosity fades with it.

15
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:10,583
Even though people know this,

16
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:13,208
they search out mysteries
because they like to say,

17
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:15,333
"Oh! So that's what it was!"

18
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:18,125
Yes. Let me start to help
you change these mysteries

19
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:21,416
you want to solve into
well known facts.

20
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:03,083
[FRED]
Gene, Jim! How are you?

21
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,625
Business is just fine over here.

22
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:08,458
I have both of you to thank
in more ways than one.

23
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,500
But I'd rather do
that in person.

24
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,291
That's why I keep
agreeing to your

25
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,750
repeated requests for
financial assistance.

26
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:17,625
But remember, as much as
I value your hard work,

27
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:21,416
the funds I send to you are
just an investment on my part.

28
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,541
Well, I'll be waiting
for some good news.

29
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,375
[JIM]
Hm. See? What did I tell ya?

30
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,291
Well then, I sure hope
we find treasure at

31
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:32,833
the Galactic Leyline.

32
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:36,291
Otherwise, we'll have
to skip town.

33
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,625
So how many shells
did you manage to get?

34
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,125
I have two Number 4's

35
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:43,000
and one each of Number 9
through Number 13.

36
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:46,416
But these babies here
are really important.

37
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,333
They can do some
serious damage.

38
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:51,791
Number 4, Number 9,
and Number 13, too!

39
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,958
They said not to fire
these three type shells

40
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,375
one right after another.

41
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,708
They warned me
if I do fire it,

42
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,541
it'll drain my life away.

43
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,000
Ha, ha! I doubt that!

44
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:04,333
Yeah, well I wouldn't be so
certain about that, Jim.

45
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,333
They said that
they're too powerful,

46
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:09,958
and will completely drain the
life out of whoever fires them.

47
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,958
Whoa, no way!

48
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,333
Gene.

49
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,416
Hey, come on. Don't look
at me like that.

50
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,458
[MELFINA]
But, Gene...

51
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,416
We're not gonna
get into a situation

52
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,625
where I have to fire
these shells back to back.

53
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,541
[door opens]

54
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:28,250
I'm told that the re-supply
work has been completed.

55
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,250
[AISHA]
Hello everyone! Sorry I'm late!

56
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,833
Don't worry, I took care
of all of my errands.

57
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,458
[GENE]
Okay, then.

58
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,291
Time to get this
show on the road.

59
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:39,375
The Galactic Leyline's
waiting for us.

60
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:50,583
Tell me Harry, how do you feel?

61
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,083
[HARRY]
I'm feeling fine.

62
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,250
I can pretty much make the
ship do whatever I want.

63
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,541
And that's not all
of it, I assure you.

64
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,875
Mm... Not at all.

65
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:02,875
If I'm not mistaken Harry,
you should be able to navigate

66
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,500
your way to the
Galactic Leyline,

67
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:07,250
without a hitch, just like
your friend Melfina.

68
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,750
Don't worry.

69
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,875
[HARRY] I like it when you
compare me to her, Professor.

70
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,291
Remember now Khan,

71
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,416
let's keep focused on
our true mission here,

72
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,541
I didn't go through the
trouble of tracking you down

73
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:17,875
just to save Harry.

74
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,000
Yes, I know that.

75
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,750
I never would have
helped out you two

76
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:25,083
if I hadn't been humiliated
and abandoned by those people.

77
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,791
They'll pay for the
disrespectful way

78
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,541
I've been treated,
I can assure you.

79
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:31,250
Well then, it seems as if
we have a common interest.

80
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,958
Yes, that's quite right!

81
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,541
It appears my tracer
aboard the <i>Outlaw Star</i>

82
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,416
is operating perfectly so far.

83
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,791
If we follow them, we'll arrive
at the Galactic Leyline!

84
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:43,333
[FRED]
Wait for me, Melfina.

85
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:59,500
[OLD MAN, OLD WOMAN chanting]

86
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,791
[HAZANKO]
Continue.

87
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:33,541
[OLD MAN, OLD WOMAN chanting]

88
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,333
[OVERSEER]
Hazanko!

89
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:36,916
What is the meaning of this?

90
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You're not following the orders
of the Tendo King as commanded.

91
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,500
[HAZANKO]
I most certainly am.

92
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,375
As ordered, I have
through my own means,

93
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:44,958
found a way into the Leyline.

94
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:47,833
And I've done so without
breaking any laws.

95
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,083
So then, why haven't you
reported your progress

96
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,333
to the Tendo King?

97
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:54,625
Why are you not opening
the Leyline on your own?

98
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,041
[HAZANKO]
What's the matter,

99
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:59,458
doesn't the Tendo King
sycophant have any ambitions?

100
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,291
It's just as I thought, Hazanko!

101
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,666
What you really have in
mind is to betray the king

102
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,250
and take the Leyline for
yourself! That's it, isn't it?

103
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,250
[HAZANKO]
Not just the Tendo King.

104
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,416
The power of the Galactic
Leyline surpasses

105
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,875
that of the Tenpa Emperor.

106
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:15,625
No, it's magnificent power
is even greater than that!

107
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,041
[OVERSEER]
Die!

108
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:27,833
Damn you, Hazan... ko...!

109
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,916
[HAZANKO]
Let's finish this.

110
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,708
[HAZANKO] When the
Overseer doesn't return,

111
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:43,083
the Tendo King will
grow suspicious.

112
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,458
Before then, I'll have
in my possession

113
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,625
everything the
Leyline has to offer!

114
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:48,833
[beeping]

115
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,000
A ship has appeared
out of sub-ether space.

116
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:54,375
It's heading straight
for the Galactic Leyline.

117
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,083
[HAMU]
Oh, no, it can't be!

118
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,166
[HAZANKO]
The XGP!

119
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,041
[GILLIAM]
That area of space is odd.

120
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,916
Electromagnetic waves,
gravity waves, ether waves.

121
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,500
Nothing I send out comes back.

122
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:09,041
Are you saying it doesn't
come up on your sensors?

123
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,375
[GILLIAM]
That's right.

124
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,458
A malfunction when the
Leyline's under our noses?

125
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:14,291
[GILLIAM] My sensors are
functioning normally.

126
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:17,041
I'm picking up other ships
along that area's periphery.

127
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,541
You're picking up ships?!

128
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:19,791
Why didn't you say so?

129
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,375
[GILLIAM]
I'll magnify the image for you.

130
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,750
Those are Kei Pirates!

131
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,375
They're all over the place!

132
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:28,625
[GENE]
An ambush!

133
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,458
[SUZUKA] There seems to
be many worker ships.

134
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,458
That looks like...
the <i>Geomancer</i> !

135
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:33,916
Wait, you know that ship?

136
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,375
It's the ship of a man named
Hazanko who is said to be

137
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:39,041
a powerful Tao master,
even among the Kei leaders.

138
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:39,833
Hazanko?

139
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,416
He's a dangerous man.

140
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,208
And with him, the Anten
Pirates, his subordinates.

141
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,500
Are you talking about that
bunch that attacked us?

142
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:48,833
[beeping]

143
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,375
[GILLIAM] Pirate ships are
launching cub fighters!

144
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,208
Count: many!

145
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,750
All right. Prepare for combat!

146
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:09,208
[HAZANKO]
I want you to capture the XGP.

147
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,833
And then, take Melfina!

148
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,041
Take that!

149
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:26,666
They're trying to keep us away
from the Galactic Leyline!

150
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,000
[MELFINA] A ship is coming
out of sub-ether space.

151
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,041
Seven hundred kilometers
to starboard.

152
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:31,875
Reinforcements?!

153
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,708
[GILLIAM]
Now enlarging.

154
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,500
Look at that...
We got a trouble.

155
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,500
Wait a minute,
Gene, isn't that...?

156
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,500
It's the entire

The Nipopopolas-class cruiser,
the <i>Orta Honehone</i> !

159
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,958
[XO] The Ctarl-Ctarl
Empire will lay claim

160
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:52,291
to the Galactic Leyline!

161
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:55,375
Smash anyone who dares
to get in our way!

Aisha? What the hell
have you done?

164
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,125
Every time we went
to a spaceport,

165
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,458
I always contacted
the empire, that's all.

166
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,625
What?

167
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,208
You gave them the
Leyline's coordinates?

168
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,750
If I don't let them know where
I'm going and what I'm doing,

my family and friends
get worried sick about me.

[HAMU] The Ctarl-Ctarl warship
seems to be heading straight

171
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,583
for the Galactic Leyline.

172
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:23,416
[HAZANKO] Let them do
whatever pleases them.

173
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,583
We wouldn't have had to
go through all this trouble

174
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,791
if it were possible to force
your way into the Leyline.

[CTARL CREW]
Go! Go!

176
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:33,250
Nothing can stop the
invincible Ctarl-Ctarl!

177
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,541
Nothing can stop
the Ctarl-Ctarl.

Go! Go! Ctarl-Ctarl!

We're not afraid of anything!

We're the invincible
Ctarl-Ctarl!

181
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:44,833
They did it!

182
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,375
This means that
the entire treasure

183
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,500
belongs to the
Ctarl-Ctarl Empire!

Ah, damn it!

185
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,375
Haven't you ever heard of
the expression "fair play"?

186
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:56,166
No use getting upset over it.

that's in a race to
get to the Leyline?

190
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:09,000
[HAMU] The XGP is a
formidable opponent.

[OLD MAN]
Huh?

192

00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:14,041
They are coming this way.

[CTARL CREW screaming]

Why's it coming back this way?!

Look at their shots.
They're firing at random.

199
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,458
Turn to 3 o'clock.
And do it now!

200
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:31,958
[GILLIAM]
That's crazy!

201
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,458
The <i>Orta Honehone</i> would
be directly in our path!

202
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:36,791
That is our only shot at
making it to the Leyline!

203
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,416
[MELFINA] We'll never be
able to dodge them all!

All right, we're goin' in!

We really did it, Gene!

208
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,875
It's a straight shot in
to the Leyline from here.

209
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,708
[GILLIAM] It's not registering
on my sensors.

I'm afraid there
doesn't appear to be

It seems the XGP
has successfully

215
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,875
penetrated the Leyline.

216
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:20,250
I'm detecting a new ship.

00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,375
What are you doing here?

223
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:36,416
I'm letting the XGP lead
me to the Galactic Leyline.

224

And you'd better guess again if
you think you're gonna stop me!

[HAZANKO]
What do you think you're up to?

Loathsome jackals like you

No, we're the big game hunters.

We're gonna take down
the XGP for openers,

[AISHA]
Hmm.

280
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:34,958
I guess it looks like
the <i>Orto Honehone</i>

281
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,791
wasn't up to the challenge.

282
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:40,000
So that must be the reason why
the <i>Geomancer</i> held its position.

283
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,625
What were they doing,
just standing by like that?

Who knows, Jim.

But I'll betcha they're cooking
up some dirty little scheme,

Oh, my!

up my tracer, either!

It's okay, professor,

she's a bio-android.

No, no.

299
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,583
She's a considerably different
from the standard issue

become familiar with.

Different in ways that
you can't imagine.

302
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,125
[HARRY]
Yeah, so how's she different?

303

Mm-hm...

304
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,083
I'll need to start
at the beginning.

305
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,000
You see, the Kei
Pirates came to me

306
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,625
and asked me to decode
genetic engineering data

307
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,833
uncovered by them
at some ancient ruins

308
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,458
called "Grave of Dragon."

309
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:40,708
I already know how you designed
the XGP after decoding the data,

310
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,416
professor, just stick
to Melfina.

311
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,708
But that's just it.

312
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:47,375
You see, I wasn't able
to completely decode it.

313
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:48,958
Some of the data I mentioned

314
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,375
was something even I couldn't
precisely understand.

315
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,583
For lack of a better term,

316
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,500
I have been calling
it a "black box."

317
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:57,416
The XGP, as well as Melfina,
were constructed by

318
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,208
incorporating this "black
box," which I had no idea

319
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,416
how to activate, as
well as knowledge from

320
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,708
30,000 years ago,

321
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:06,125
left behind by a
mysterious source.

322
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,583
Yes.

323
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:10,750
So you're saying that hidden
inside the XGP and Melfina

324
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:13,208
lies a mystery you could
never solve, professor?

325
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,375
Yes, yes, yes, that's right!

326
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:18,125
Oh, how can there still be
so many unsolved mysteries

327
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,500
of the universe that my
brilliant mind can't decipher?

328
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:23,000
It's utterly
impossible to fathom!

329
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,708
At any rate, there's your
answer in a nutshell.

330
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:28,458
She's too great a mystery
for you to contemplate.

331
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,791
[HARRY]
I can sense them!

332
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:35,500
[HARRY]
At last I've found you, Melfina!

333
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:39,541
Turn the ship around! Damn it!
It's the MacDougall brothers!

334
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,250
What are they doin' here?!

335
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,250
Melfina?

336
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,708
[MELFINA]
The spiral's collapsing.

337
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,958
What just happened there?!

338
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:54,083
[MELFINA]
I think it's a whirlpool?!

339
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,750
I'm detecting another ship!

340
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,458
It's the <i>Geomancer</i> .

341
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,166
[HAZANKO]
Capture the XGP at once!

342
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,958
Then destroy the
MacDougall brothers!

343
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:11,000
[HARRY]
Don't mess with me!

344
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:17,583
Don't try to fight them
head-on! Go after the XGP!

345
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:22,250
All right, bastard!

346
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,000
Dammit!

347
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:28,958
--Gene!
--Gene!

348
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,125
You moron!

349
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,541
[HARRY] You think I'm gonna let
you have Melfina that easily?

350
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:40,125
Let's lose 'em.
Maximum overdrive.

351
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:42,500
After them!

352
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,125
[HARRY]
I know!

353
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,458
[HAZANKO] Don't let them
escape! After them!

354
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:51,250
[OLD MAN] With all due respect,
we musn't, Lord Hazanko.

355
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,375
If we deviate from our course,

356
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,916
we'll never stand a chance
of reaching the Leyline.

357
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,041
[GENE]
Mel!

358
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,500
Where's that spiral?

359
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,375
[MELFINA]
We're in the center.

360
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:09,791
[GILLIAM]
Kinetic waves.

361
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,333
There's something ahead.

362
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,875
Wha...? What's that?

363
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:14,791
Wha? That's it, isn't it?!

364
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:17,583
That's what the Kei Pirates
have been trying to mastermind.

365
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:20,375
It's where mountains of riches
are waiting for all of us!

366
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:21,375
So that's it.

367
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,791
The heart of the
Galactic Leyline!

368
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,250
Whadddaya think
we'll find there?

369
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,916
Treasures or monsters?

370
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,291
Let's find out. [grunts]

371
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,708
[MELFINA]
The ship is being pulled in.

372
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,666
It's like we're being guided.

373
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,916
Guided?

374
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Don't you think that's
a little understated?

375
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,166
Oh, no! We're gonna crash!

376
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:55,333
[GILLIAM] Acceleration has
dropped to approximately 70%.

377
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:57,500
I'm detecting an atmosphere
outside the ship.

378
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,166
So, Gene, what are
we gonna do now?!

379
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,666
Show some backbone, will ya?

380
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,875
The Leyline is sending
us an invitation.

381
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,416
I say we accept the offer.

382
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,125
Looks like the end of the line.

383
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,041
[GILLIAM]
Oh my goodness.

384
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,125
Huh?

385
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,375
[GILLIAM]
Take a look at this, Gene.

386
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:23,333
It seems to be some sort
of artificial structure.

387
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,958
[GENE] So the rest of
the way is by foot, huh?

388
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,666
[GILLIAM] The atmosphere
is quite breathable.

389
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:31,166
The gravity is
approximately 0.974 G.

390
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,833
Man, these guys think
of everything, don't they?

391
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,916
Mind the ship while
I'm gone, Gilliam.

392
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,666
[GILLIAM] All right,
I'll see you later, then.

393
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,333
Please be careful.

394
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,500
[HAZANKO]
Tobigera, you and the crew

395
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:44,958
will protect the <i>Geomancer</i> .

396
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,375
[TOBIGERA]
Yes, sir!

397
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:48,541
[HAZANKO]The rest of you
will come with me!

398
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,291
[ALL]
Yes, lord!

399
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,208
Well, what do you think, Harry?

400
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:53,541
How does your body feel?

401
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:56,208
[HARRY sighs]
It feels great!

402
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,750
I'm lighter on my feet
than I was in my real body.

403
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,333
[KHAN] Yes, it's certainly
powerful, all right,

404
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:04,333
but remember that body is
your life support system.

405
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:06,916
[HARRY]
Yes, I understand.

406
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,875
[JIM] Man, this place really
gives me the creeps!

407
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:11,708
[GENE]
Oh...

408
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:13,291
Looks like a dead end!

409
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,208
Okay, Gene, what
should we do now?

410
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,583
Like we have a choice.
We gotta go back.

411
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:20,625
Hey, what's with the
bright lights?! Man!

412
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,041
It's gone!

413
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,583
What the...?!

414
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,458
[JIM]
What is this?

415
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:29,208
[AISHA]
The cave's disappeared!

416
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,916
It's like we've been
transported to another place.

417
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,958
[JIM]
What's going on, Gene?

418
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:36,625
[GENE]
How in the world should I know?

419
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:39,500
It seems to me that we're
inside the cylinder now.

420
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,916
Don't you know what's
going on, Melfina?

421
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,208
[MELFINA]
Huh?

422
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,833
No, I don't know, either.

423
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,208
I'm confused, too.

424
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:47,375
[AISHA]
You are?

425
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,375
[MELFINA]
I don't even know how I did it!

426
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,291
I don't understand
why I was able

427
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:54,000
to guide the <i>Outlaw Star</i> here.

428
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:58,833
This was the first time
I could do it. [cries]

429
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:03,250
Well, we traveled all this way
so we could find that out.

430
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:05,000
[HAZANKO]
Shall I tell you all, then?

431
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,125
[ALL]
Huh?

432
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:07,208
Who are you?

433
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:08,791
[HAZANKO]
Heh. It's because Melfina

434
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:10,291
has had the secret
of the Leyline

435
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:12,166
within her all this time.

436
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,541
That's Hazanko and they're...

437
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,750
Yeah I know, those Anten guys.

438
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:19,041
[HAZANKO]
You will return Melfina to me.

439
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:21,041
She belongs to us now!

440
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:23,208
Melfina isn't a
poker chip, Jack.

441
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:24,125
Forget it!

442
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:26,166
[KHAN]
Oh my, my, my, my, my!

443
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:29,083
How amazing!
Was that teleportation?

444
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:30,500
[GENE]
MacDougall!

445
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:33,833
Yeah, and why is
Gwen Khan with those guys?

446
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,625
[VOICE]
Why dost thou return?

447
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:43,791
Hey, what was that?!

448
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:47,000
[VOICE]
Why dost thou return?

449
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:48,958
I don't understand.

450
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:51,500
What does she mean
I've returned?

451
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:52,958
Melfina!

452
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:57,166
[VOICE]
What is thy desire?

453
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,708
What do you want?!

454
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:00,750
[VOICE]
What is thy desire?

455
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:02,875
[HAMU]
That voice.... who is it?

456
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:06,916
[VOICE] Find thy desire
here on this land.

457
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,541
[KHAN]
Oh...

458
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:10,666
Yeah, I got your desire!

459
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:15,166
[screams]

460
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:18,875
[VOICE]
Why dost thou return?

461
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:21,458
Whom dost thou guide?

462
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:04,500
[GENE] Melfina, I never
knew anything about you.

463
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:09,708
And now that you're gone,
I realize that I need you.

464
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:11,916
Here at the Galactic Leyline,

465
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,500
I'll find something
and I'll lose something.

466
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:18,291
Wait for me.

467
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:21,291
[GENE]
