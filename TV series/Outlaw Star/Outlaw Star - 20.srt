00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:19,875
[NARRATOR]
Subject: Jim Hawking.

2
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:21,125
"Jim" to his friends.

3
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:22,666
Age: Eleven.

4
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,791
Height: 140 centimeters.

5
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:26,833
Weight: 32 kilograms.

6
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:28,083
Blood type: A.

7
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:31,375
A boy genius, he is the
son of a renowned hacker

8
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:33,666
known as the
Computer Wizard.

9
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,250
The cautious type, Jim is
Gene Starwind's polar opposite.

10
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:40,333
Jim always carries a computer
with him and diligently keeps

11
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:44,000
a close eye on profitable
information and enemy movement.

12
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,291
He is a quick thinker,

13
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:48,208
yet he is also very
outgoing in his actions.

14
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:50,125
Jim displays many
precocious traits

15
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:52,083
which are anything
but child-like.

16
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:54,625
Although occasionally
victimized and tormented by

17
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:58,583
Gene's inability to plan ahead,
Jim has not abandoned him.

18
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:00,916
And judging by the way
he manages Gene,

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Jim clearly looks up to him.

20
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:04,708
[GENE]
Well, that's understandable!

21
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:07,375
[JIM] Anyway, I'm totally the
kind of guy needed around here

22
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:09,000
to keep Gene's
bachelor lifestyle

23
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:10,958
from crashing down
around his ears.

24
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,958
[GENE]
Hey, stop making things up!

25
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:14,583
Well, that's my cue to leave.

26
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:17,625
[GILLIAM] I would also like to
ask that you not disturb my job.

27
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:19,250
[GENE, JIM]
Right!

28
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:55,791
[GILLIAM]
We are navigating under

29
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,583
uncommonly safe conditions.

30
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,916
There is no unusual
activity to report

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,666
outside or inside the ship.

32
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,875
Estimated time of arrival at
Transmit Station Symka 5,

33
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:10,291
Thirty minutes.

34
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,583
An uneventful trip might
be a bit of welcome relief

35
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:15,000
to you guys, but it sure
doesn't leave much excitement

36
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,833
for alive-wire
like me, you know.

37
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:19,458
It could just be a simple
matter of one coincidence

38
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:22,708
after another, but this is
a weird crew we collected.

39
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,041
Hey! I heard that, Jim.

40
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,416
A child barely out of
diapers like you shouldn't be

41
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,000
insulting a woman who's
mature and worldly!

42
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,625
[JIM grunts]
You heard me?

43
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,125
You better believe it.

44
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,791
The best ears in
the whole universe

45
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,333
are those of the Ctarl-Ctarl.

46
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,208
You won't forget that, right?

47
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:39,166
No way!

48
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,958
Now that's the good boy, Jim!

49
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,833
Yeah, I think I'm just
beginning to understand

50
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:45,041
what it really means to
upset you Ctarl-Ctarls.

51
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,250
I wouldn't wanna do that!

52
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,583
[AISHA]
Mm-hm!

53
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,500
That's a sure sign of you
becoming a young man!

54
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:50,708
Right, whatever you say.

55
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,708
[MELFINA] Jim and Aisha
get along so well.

56
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:55,958
It's as though
they're really family.

57
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,708
[GENE]
Hm? Family?

58
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,500
[SUZUKA]
Mmm. This tea is delicious.

59
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:01,750
[computer beeping]

60
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,375
[GILLIAM] I've detected
a ship in the proximity,

61
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:04,875
and it's rapidly approaching us.

62
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,666
I've made several
attempts to hail it,

63
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,041
but it is not responding
to our signals.

64
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,625
An enemy ship!

65
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,083
[GENE] Why didn't you
spot it earlier?!

66
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,125
[GILLIAM] I can only
surmise that the craft is

67
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:21,125
utilizing some method to
evade my sensor system.

68
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:23,833
Or in other words, you're simply
without a clue, right?

69
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,041
--[GILLIAM] Unfortunately.
--[GENE groans]

70
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:27,833
Uh-oh, Gene, that ship's
almost on our butt!

71
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:30,125
Go to Grappler combat mode!

72
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:37,250
[computers beeping]

73
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,083
[GILLIAM] I'm receiving a
signal from the other ship.

74
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,625
[GENE]
Put it through.

75
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,416
[MALE SPACE PIRATE] You're Gene
Starwind of the Outlaw Star?

76
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,625
Nothing personal,
but I'm here to kill you.

77
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,083
It's an enemy ship.

78
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,291
Could that be one of our old
pirate buddies out there?

79
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,750
Probably.

80
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,750
The ship's now within firing
range now, Mister Popular.

81
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,583
Well, let's blow some hot
kisses to my devoted fan.

82
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,208
[JIM]
Launching missiles!

83
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,000
[JIM]
It's a decoy!

84
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,791
Well you bastard,
if it's a grappler fight

85
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:13,875
you're itchin' for, then you
sure came to right guy!

86
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,291
This punk's not so damn tough.

87
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:29,958
What the...?!

88
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,125
[FEMALE SPACE PIRATE]
Mata, this guy's a wimp!

89
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,083
[MATA]
C'mon, let's finish him off!

90
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,875
--What the heck's going on?!
--[alarms blaring]

91
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,166
[GILLIAM]
Warning.

92
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,583
Pressure levels are rising
throughout the ship.

93
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,000
If they continue to escalate,

94
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,208
remaining in combat
mode is not advised.

95
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,875
Yeah! I know that!

96
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:52,208
But these guys are just too
quick and hard to out-maneuver.

97
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,000
The fighting capabilities
of the <i>Outlaw Star</i>

98
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,791
aren't cut out for this.

99
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:59,333
There is one chance. If I
could only find an opening...

100
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,875
Jim, on my signal, I want ya
to give 'em everything we got!

101
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,291
One last resort, coming up!

102
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,041
Last resort?

103
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,875
[sighs]

104
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,083
That was too close!

105
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,833
So your last resort
was to run away?

106
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,250
What cowards!

107
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:34,625
Hey, you're alive, aren't you?

108
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,750
Gee, I'd appreciate a
little more gratitude here.

109
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,208
If you consider
that we survived,

110
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:39,625
then we really haven't lost.

111
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,291
Oh, you two...

112
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,916
[MELFINA] Well, you certainly
make a good team.

113
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,250
Well, Melfina, thanks.
But it's no big deal, ya know.

114
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,333
[laughs]

115
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:53,250
Somehow it doesn't seem to
me like being called a team

116
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,583
with Gene is so great.

117
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:57,000
Is that right, James?
What's that supposed mean?

118
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,375
Huh? What do you mean?

119
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,333
[GENE] Seems you and I
need to have a little chat

120
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,083
--about a few things.
--[JIM] Oh no, we don't.

121
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,208
[GENE]
Yes, we do.

122
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:04,416
[GILLIAM]
Ladies and gentlemen,

123
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,666
we will be arriving at
Symka 5 momentarily.

124
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:25,125
[JIM] Well, should we go see
about repairs and weaponry?

125
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:26,125
[GENE]
Yeah.

126
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,583
[MELFINA]
Hey, where's Suzuka?

127
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:29,875
[AISHA] Suzu mentioned that
she was gonna take a nap.

128
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:32,500
Yeah, she has a lot of
difficulty working as a team.

129
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:35,625
Right, maybe, but she's
not the only one!

130
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,041
Well, I don't know
about you guys,

131
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,125
but I'm gonna go
to find some fun!

132
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:42,375
Another one who can't
just work as a team.

133
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:45,125
Yeah, like you're
one to talk, Gene.

134
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,583
Yeah, whatever.

135
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:47,458
You're kidding!

136
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:48,666
You want me to fix everything

137
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,916
and get you weapons on
a budget like this?

138
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,708
We were hoping that we could
work out a deal of some kind.

139
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,375
If you could do some of
the labor yourselves,

140
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,416
I can give you a discount.

141
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,333
What'll we do?

142
00:07:58,416 --> 00:07:59,916
[GENE]
Like we have a choice.

143
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,125
Go ahead and start
on the repairs for now.

144
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,041
Mister, don't cut
any corners, either.

145
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,875
We can tell you're good
just by looking at

146
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,375
the equipment you've got.

147
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:08,708
Okay, then.

148
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,958
Fill the paperwork out,
and I'll jump right on it.

149
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,041
All right, thanks!

150
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,541
[GENE] That other ship might
be here on this station, too.

151
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,166
[JIM]
Then shouldn't we look for it?

152
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,583
[GENE] Nah. If they come
at us, I'll take 'em down.

153
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,791
[JIM] Ah! Pretty sure
of yourself, aren't you?

154
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,791
Or maybe you're just lazy?

155
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,416
--[GENE] Say what?!
--[JIM laughs]

156
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,666
You know what I'm saying.

157
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,000
We've got to remember
to keep our guard up.

158
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,833
Right, Gene?

159
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,625
Yeah.

160
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,375
Oh, and one more thing.

161
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,250
I'm gonna go out and party!

162
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,875
Ha. Ha! A couple a'
drinks'll help me unwind!

163
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,333
I'm not kidding, Gene!
I'm really worried about ya!

164
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:44,458
Come on, lighten up, partner!
I need to have a little fun!

165
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:47,458
Suit yourself! Melfina, would
you please tag-a-long with this

166
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,291
idiot here and keep
him out of trouble?

167
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:50,000
Sure!

168
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,666
Wh-What? Wait a minute!

169
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,833
I was talking about
going out alone!

170
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,250
Bang!

171
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,458
What did I do to desrve this?

172
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,166
Ya wany anythin'else?

173
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,416
Oh, this dessert is
plenty for me, thank you.

174
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,875
Yup. That's great.
Glad to hear it, Melfina.

175
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,291

[typing]

177
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,666
[JIM] How come I'm always
the one who gets stuck

178
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,833
doing everything around here?

179
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:20,833
[GILLIAM]
It's rough, isn't it, Jim?

180
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,375
Hey, thanks a lot, Gilliam.

181
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,375
Ya know, you're the only
one who ever notices

182
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,333
how much I bust my butt?

183
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,833
[GILLIAM] I have the combat
data on the enemy vessel.

184
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:32,708
Without a strategy, we're not
gonna beat that other ship.

185
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:35,583
Gene never plans ahead,
he makes it up as he goes.

186
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:38,333
But this time,
it's all up to me.

187
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:40,750
[GILLIAM] Shall I brew a
pot of coffee for you?

188
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,708
Sure. Sounds great!

[GILLIAM]
Jim, it's already morning.

192
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,000
Perhaps you should take a break.

193
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,583
Man, I'm exhausted,
but I can't go to bed yet.

194
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,416
Guess breath of fresh
air might do me good.

Hm? Wha...?

198
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:28,125
Huh. Wow! You don't see
many cats on space stations.

[Jim grunts]

Aw. That's a good kitty cat.

205

[JIM chuckles]

206
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,583
[JIM]
Aw. There you go!

207
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:48,333
Boy, you guys
really like it, huh?

208
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:49,875
Huh?

209
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,833
Hey! Wait a minute, guys!

210
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,833
Don't you wanna play some more?

211
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,833
[JIM]
Huh? Hmm...

212
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:00,208
Here kitty, kitty, kitty.

213
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,458
[JIM]
Oh...

[Jim]
Hmm...

00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:35,666
[GIRL]
Hm? Hmm...

217
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,625
Hi.

218
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,250
Are those your kitty cats?

219
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:46,250
They are.

220
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:47,708
Why do you want to know?

221
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,333
Uh...?! Um...

222
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,416
No reason, just wondering.

223
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,250
Just wondering?

224
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:58,625
M-Maybe I was just
trying to talk to you?

225
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,333
Is that all right?

226
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,500
[GIRL] Why? Do you
like me or something?

227
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:07,083
[JIM] N-No, I didn't
mean it like that!

228
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,291
Well, maybe I do.

229
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,333
[GIRL]
Hm?

230
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,708
So do you live
here on the station?

231
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:14,041
Oh, no. Just passing
through on a trip.

232
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,000
--[JIM] Hm. So you're traveling
--[cat meowing]

233
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,375
with your cats?

234
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,791
Yeah, this is Mata and Kemi.

235
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,083
So, what's your name?

236
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,041
Oh, sorry.

237
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,333
My name's Hanmyo.

238
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:24,833
My name's Jim Hawking.

239
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,208
I'm on a trip, too.

240
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,958
I just stopped off here at
the station for a while.

241
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,916
[HANMYO]
Hm?

242
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,791
Oh, wow! Then it's fate!

243
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:33,958
Huh?!

244
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,875
Don't you see? We were
supposed to meet!

245
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,416
What are the chances that both
our ships would stop here?

246
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,791
It was fate, Jim!

247
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:40,708
Fate...?

248
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:41,708
I guess so.

249
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,625
[meowing]

250
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:46,333
[HANMYO] Well, I have to go
back and feed the kitties, now.

251
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,583
[JIM]
Mm. Uh... Well...

252
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:52,125
Can you come back
again this afternoon?

253
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,291
Okay!

254
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,000
Great! I'll meet you
here at one o'clock!

255
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,291
[HANMYO]
Well then! See you later!

256
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,541
Bye!

257
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,166
[JIM sighs]

258
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:15,291
[MELFINA]
Jim, more coffee?

259
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:16,833
Yeah, thanks.

260
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,000
So where's Gene?

261
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,541
Still sleeping.

262
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,708
He drank an awful lot
of liquor yesterday.

263
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,291
But, Melfina. What went wrong?

264
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,125
You were supposed to
keep an eye on him.

265
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,208
Yes. I tried to stop him.

266
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:30,416
But when I did, he started
drinking even more.

267
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,166
[JIM grunts]
Sounds like Gene.

268
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,541
[GENE]
What does?

269
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:36,416
[JIM scoffs]
Good morning, sunshine.

270

[groans]

271
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,000
There's an inspirational image.

272
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:41,750
Okay, hurry up and eat now,
we've got a busy day.

273
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,083
Yeah, yeah.

Hey, how's it coming, mister?

276
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,083
Doing just fine,

277
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,291
considering I'm not making
any profit on this job.

278
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:56,833
But it's a great ship.

279
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:59,083
I've never seen this model out
here on the frontier before.

280
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,416
Nice one, huh?

281
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,541
[SHOP OWNER]
Yeah, she's a real beauty.

282
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,375
[JIM]
Good work! Keep it up!

283
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,166
[SHOP OWNER]
Leave it to me!

284
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,458
[JIM] Hey there,
how's it coming along?

285
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,750
Look, I know that we're cutting
back on costs. However,

286
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,708
you could offer a little bit of
help with the workload here.

287
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,750
This isn't a run-of-the-mill
fix it job.

288
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,291
What the hell's the big idea?

289
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,500
You're making me change out
the arms' wiring on this thing!

290
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:21,541
That's a lot of work!

291
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,000
Look, Gene Starwind!

292
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,833
Don't you hear that voice
deep inside you telling you

293
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,291
to work harder in order
to pay for the bar tab

294
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,083
you racked up yesterday?!

295
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,208
[chuckles]
Yes, I was so wrong.

296
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,666
What was I thinking?

297
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,375
Please, Master James, what more

298
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,583
can this unworthy
servant do for ya?

299
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,000
Well, if you were
on a first date,

300
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:40,250
what kind of present
would ya bring?

301
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,291
What's wrong?

302
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:48,250
Has my little Jimmy
discovered girls?

303
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,708
[laughs]

304
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:50,916
All right!

305
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,541
This is your first step
toward being a man,

306
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,375
so feel free to ask the
pro anything you want.

307
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:56,708
Aw, forget it!

308
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,833
I'm an idiot to ask advice
from a lech like you!

309
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:01,791
Not all guys have only one
thing on the mind, sleazeball!

310
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,000
Hey, watch it, you little runt!

311
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,541
Now you're really
ticking me off.

312
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,625
You're dirty, slimy, and scumy!

Guess who?!

00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:23,958
Um...

319
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,708
Here.

320
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,458
You brought me flowers?

321
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:29,458
[giggles]

322
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,166
Wow!

323
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:33,958
[JIM]
Uh...!

324
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:38,541
That is so nice.

325
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:41,333
[nervous chuckles]

326
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:44,000
[MELFINA]
The X-axis checks out normal.

327
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,625
[GENE] There's less
damage than I thought.

328
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:47,166
[MELFINA]
Good news, isn't it?

329
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,708
Yeah. The <i>Outlaw</i>
<i>Star</i> 's one of a kind.

330
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:52,166
It really is a fine ship.

331
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,416
[GENE]
Huh?

332
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,458
Huh? What is it, what's wrong?

333
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,666
Uh, what do you mean?
There's nothing wrong.

334
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,458
Gene?

335
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,208
I said it's nothing!

336
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,166
Am I...

337
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,458
...in the way?

338
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,916
No, of course you're not.

339
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,250
God, it's not that at all!

340
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,666
We need you here, Melfina.

341
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,500
[MELFINA]
All right.

342
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:16,666
[computer beeps]

343
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,916
[GILLIAM]
Please pardon the interruption,

344
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,500
but a video mail transmission

345
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,916
has just been received
from Fred Luo.

346
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,375
[GENE]
Play it.

347
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,708
Gene, my old friend, how are
you and your merry troupe

348
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:27,583
doing out there at your
end of the universe?

349
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:30,458
These messages are expensive,
so I'll keep it short.

350
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,416
I have news about an
interesting place that's

351
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,291
related to the Galactic Leyline.

352
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,958
I mailed the details to
Jim in an encoded file.

353
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,041
Well, good luck.

354
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,583
Take care of yourselves, now.

355
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:40,625
[GILLIAM]
End of message.

356
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,500
We'll have to check
out the place.

357
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:45,333
Things are sure beginning
to liven up around here.

358
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,375
[AISHA] I can already
smell the treasure!

359
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:48,833
Let's get going!

360
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,250
Don't you ever knock?

361
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,666
[meows]

362
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,000
[HANMYO]
That was fun, huh?

363
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,791
[JIM]
Yeah.

364
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,083
Hey, do ya think we could
meet again tomorrow?

365
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,541
Oh, yes!

366
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,583
We can meet right here at
the same time we met today!

367
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,500
Okay, then I'll be here.

368
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:04,666
Me, too.

369
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,875
[giggles]

370
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:07,583
[HANMYO]
Jim?

371
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:08,500
[JIM]
Yeah?

372
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:09,375
[HANMYO]
Thanks for the flowers.

373
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,083
I've never gotten any before.

374
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,791
[JIM]
You're welcome. See ya!

375
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,500
[HANMYO]
Bye-bye!

376
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,875
[KEMI] Hanmyo, you haven't
forgotten about our mission,

377
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,208
have you?

378
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,291
[MATA] Yes, that's right.
You haven't, have you?

379
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:40,750
Will you stop worrying?

380
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,791
All I have to do is
disable their ship

381
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,708
and get rid of Gene Starwind.

382
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:45,916
[MATA]
Okay, okay.

383
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,625
The <i>Outlaw Star</i>
hasn't launched yet.

384
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:50,416
[KEMI] Hanmyo, I wish you hadn't
made another date like that.

385
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,708
You should've discussed
it with me first.

386
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,708
[MATA]
And me as well.

387
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,750
Well I'm sorry,
but this is fate.

388
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,916
Don't worry about it.
I will finish the job.

389
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,166
[MELFINA]
All systems green.

390
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,166
All right, people. Let's launch.

391
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,500
What's wrong, Jim? You seem
kinda down in the dumps.

392
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:12,291
Oh, right, I forgot.
How'd your big date turn out?

393
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,916
It went just great, as if
it's any of your bee's wax,

394
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,583
so back off! Now let's
get outta here!

395
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:22,291
[JIM] I'm sorry, Hanmyo.
I can't make it.

396
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:32,333
[GILLIAM]
Alert!

397
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:35,208
A solitary vessel is closing
in on our ship from astern.

398
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:40,875
[AISHA]
What's he up to?

399
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,333
Oh, he's taking his time.

400
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:44,750
Just like a feline
toying with a mouse.

401
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,666
Looks like he's trying
to screw around with us.

402
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,458
Well then, we're just
gonna have to show him

403
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,541
what a mouse can do
when it gets cornered.

404
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,750
Jim, what course of action
would you recommend?

405
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:56,083
"There's more than one way to
skin a cat," as the saying goes.

406
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,500
What a vile saying!

407
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,625
Don't take it personally, Aisha.

408
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,916
Going to Grappler combat mode!

409
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,333
[KEMI]
Roger.

410
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,708
[MATA]
Ready when you are.

411
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:13,750
[KEMI]
Same here.

412
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:14,875
[HANMYO]
Let's finish him off quick.

413
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:16,500
I have an appointment to keep.

414
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:17,250
[MATA]
Focus.

415
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,250
[KEMI]
Relax.

416
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,375
I am relaxed, don't worry.

417
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:23,375
I can sense the power.
It's coming now.

418
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,000
[GENE]
Is this really gonna work?

419
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,333
[JIM]
I dunno.

420
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,291
But if we do it the same
as last time, we'll lose.

421
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,625
[GENE]
Yeah. Probably.

422
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:30,791
[JIM]
Gilliam!

423
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,583
Cut all external monitors
except this one.

424
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:34,333
And stand by to activate.

425
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,250
Gene, you concentrate
on piloting.

426
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,083
I'll back you up
without your instructions.

427
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:39,750
The Arms' response
has been increased

428
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,041
to 150 percent.

429
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,041
Aisha, Suzuka they're all yours.

430
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,875
Hey, this is easy!
It's like a game!

431
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:49,208
Yeah, well keep in mind there's
no reset button on this game.

432
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,666
[GILLIAM] This system can
only remain operational

433
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,375
for one minute. Keep alert
and be careful, everyone.

434
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:56,791
And good luck to you.

435
00:19:56,875 --> 00:20:00,166
[MELFINA] Let's all pull
together the way a team should.

436
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,708
If anybody can do it, we can.

437
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,916
Gosh, I feel like crying.

438
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,458
[GENE]
Let's do it!

439
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:13,833
[KEMI]
He's pinned!

440
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:17,833
Bastard!

441
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,791
[JIM]
He's making another pass!

442
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:27,000
[growls]

443
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,791
[shouts]

444
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,041
[AISHA]
Now!

445
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,916
[KEMI screams]

446
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,083
[MATA]
They killed Kemi!

447
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,666
They're gonna get it!

448
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,416
[MATA grunts]

449
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,166
I think I'm beginning to
get the hang of it now.

450
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,083
[HANMYO]
Let go of Mata!

451
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,666
[JIM]
Launching all missiles!

452
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,416
[MATA grunts]

453
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,291
[MATA screams]

454
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,208
[HANYMO]
Mata!

455
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:19,750
Oh, no!

456
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,125
[ALL shout]

457
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,750
Did we get him?

458
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:34,916
A dead ship.

459
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,458
The <i>Torarato</i> won't respond.

460
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:39,708
Kemi... Mata...

461
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:45,416
Yeah!

462
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,291
[GILLIAM] Although the
adversary is defeated,

463
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,916
we sustained extensive
damage as well.

464
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,916
Then we have no choice.

465
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,750
We'll have to return to
Symka 5 for more repair.

466
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:55,833
Now what about cash?

467
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:56,833
[JIM]
Don't sweat it!

468
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,500
We'll figure out something.

469
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,083
[GENE]
What're you so happy about?

470
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:01,458
Me!

471
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,416
Uh... No reason.

472
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,750
[chuckles]

473
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:33,750
[inaudible]

474
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:50,416
[AISHA] We're off to the
Leyline and the treasure!

475
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,333
It must be nice to
be a Ctarl-Ctarl

476
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,458
without any problems.

477
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:54,916
That isn't true.

478
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,458
A delicate flower such as
I has her share of concerns.

479
00:22:57,541 --> 00:22:58,500
Like what?

480
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:00,416
Well...

481
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,416
Uh...

482
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,791
I get hungry.

483
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:05,416
[sighs]

484
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,958
[JIM] You call that
a concern? Gimme a break!

485
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:10,916
[AISHA] Well then, okay,
what would you call a problem?

486
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,666
[JIM] The big stuff, like,
"What do people exist for"?

487
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,541
"What's in my heart"?
"Who am I"? That's what!

488
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:17,708
[AISHA]
You need a life.

489
00:23:17,791 --> 00:23:20,166
[JIM]
You just don't get it!

490
00:24:57,458 --> 00:24:59,375
[GENE] In our next episode,
the secret of the Galactic

491
00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:02,000
Leyline is gonna be revealed
among the ancient ruins

492
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,916
of a mysterious planet!

493
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,916
Now I'm not trying to
be cocky or anything,

494
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,083
but story development has
to follow a certain order,

495
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:09,333
ya know.

496
00:25:09,416 --> 00:25:11,375
I can't just blurt the
whole plot out to ya.

497
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:12,333
What?

498
00:25:12,416 --> 00:25:14,000
You wanna find out now?

499
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:15,166
All right.

500
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:18,208
Believe it or not,
the Leyline is really...

501
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:19,541
Well, to tell ya the truth,

502
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:21,541
I don't know what
the secret is, either.

503
00:25:21,625 --> 00:25:24,625
Next time on Outlaw Star:
"Grave of the Dragon"!

504
00:25:24,708 --> 00:25:26,416
You'd better get ready!
