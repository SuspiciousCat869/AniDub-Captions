A thief once opined:

"I may steal, but that
does not make me inhuman."

Those Outlaws who are adrift

00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,916
and roaming the universe say:

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,541
"You may not have the
urge to break the law,

6

but you are still
bound to ignore it."

7

The blind and self-serving

00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:41,333
vanity of the thief.

9
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:44,625
The archaic and old-fashioned
code of the pirate.

10
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:46,708
The vainglorious
and narcissistic

11

pride of the Outlaw.

12
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:53,250
These may merely be white lies
to delude themselves and others

that they may, to some extent,
be considered upright people.

14
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:01,416
Whether fact or fiction,
the Outlaws live by

15
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,083
and follow a code
that they take pride in.

16
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:08,458
On the other hand, ruffians
who live outside the law,

17
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:13,250
and follow no code at all, cause
some of the greatest calamities.

Jim, can I use the torch gun?

314
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,000
No, it's hooked up
to the power system.

315
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,958
The buzz saw has internal
batteries, though.

316
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,166
You can use that.

317
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:32,500
[chanting]

318
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,708
[GENE]
Bingo! That's it!

319
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:44,458
[JIM] Forget it!
This is the real thing!

320
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:45,708
Here goes...

321
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,291
[gasps]

322
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:55,250
[beeping]

323
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,500
Wise guy... why'd you
have to do that?

324
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:58,958
[MELFINA]
That small, tube-like object

325
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,541
appears to be a detonator.

326
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,166
I can't determine
whether the explosives

327
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,916
are directly inside or not.

328
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,583
You see those two
wires over there?

329
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:09,250
One of them carries the
signal to the detonator.

330
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:12,041
Then, what do you suppose
the other one's for?

331
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,458
Hey, don't worry about it;

332
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:16,083
I grew up watching tons of
movies with bombs in 'em.

333
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:17,833
The instant the
dummy wire is cut,

334
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:20,625
it sets off a relay that
sends a signal to the real one.

335
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,791
And then... boom!

336
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,250
So what are you thinkin' of?

337
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,791
Whelp, there's only one
thing for me to do, Jim.

338
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:40,125
Gene, are you sure you wanna
go ahead with this thing?

339
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,541
Calm down.

340
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,250
All I gotta do is just
cut one of them, right?

341
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:47,333
If you cut the dummy wire,
it'll blow us to pieces!

342
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:50,291
So that means that we only
stand a fifty-fifty chance.

343
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,708
Hey, trust me!

344
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,291
You'd never guess it, but
gambling is my specialty!

345
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:55,833
Help me!

346
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,375
[GENE]

347
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:04,875
...or the blue?

348
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,458
With this much explosives,

349
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:10,416

gonna be dead anyway.

like this, you're laughing.

353

Come on, Jim, you're
bigger than that.

354
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,333
Yeah, but when
I'm really scared,

355
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:24,666
these things seem funny, and
I can't seem to explain it...

356
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,458
I just know that I
can't stop laughing.

Huh?

360
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,333
It'll be okay.

361
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,625
I know everything will work out.

362
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,958
Thanks, Mel...

363

So, whaddya say we
test our luck now?

What is it?!

367
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:52,958
Didn't you send out
a jamming signal?

368
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:55,041
It's a directional
laser transmission!

369
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,791
And it's coming
from the station.

370
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:57,875
The station?!

371
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,291
Whaddya mean?
Someone's still there?

372

What do you think you're doing?!

373
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,083
Aisha?!

374
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,250
It's been hard to reach you; we
couldn't get you on the radio!

375
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,500
What in the hell are you
doing on the station?!

376
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,125
[AISHA] I tracked the
scent of the terrorist,

377
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,000
and it seems to
have led me here!

378
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:11,916
[GENE]
His scent?

379
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,708
[SUZUKA]
That's not true.

380
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:16,166
We tried to track down
information on the ship's owner,

381
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,958
but it was a dummy, so we
found ourselves in a corner.

382
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:22,250
[AISHA] So we asked Fred Luo,
and he gave us the information!

383
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:23,416
[GENE]
Fred, huh?

384
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,625
Huh. I bet that really cost you.

385
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:27,333
Not at all.

386
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,958
Actually, he was most
cooperative when I told him

387
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,458
it was to help you.

388
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:35,000
[AISHA] He even lent us a
shuttle for free to get up here!

389
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,625
So, what information
did you get?

390
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:41,208
Well, you see, according to Luo,
the Ad Ship's registration

391
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:44,625
is actually a fake that was sold
by pirates on the black market!

392
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:45,833
[GENE]
Pirates?!

393
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,208
So then, after that,
we had Luo check and see

394
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:50,458
who the pirates had
previously sold it to.

395
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:53,625
Will ya just get to the point?
Who the hell did he sell it to?

396
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:57,791
The buyer was the lead-man of
a notorious gang of robbers.

397
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,458
[VICEROY]
I can't sacrifice the lives

398
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,500
of everyone on Heifong III.

399
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:04,166
The Viceregal of Heifong
agrees to your demands.

400
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,708
We recognize Heifong's
independence!

401
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,375
Perhaps you misunderstood me.

402
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,333
What we're looking
for here and demand

403
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,791
is recognition by
the Tempa Empire.

404
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,833
Any decision made
by the Viceregal

405
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:16,666
is totally useless to us.

406
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,958
[VICEROY] What?!
Don't tell me at this point

407
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,916
that you never had
any intention of--

408
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,750
What, this guy's not
even a terrorist?

409
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,416
He's just a simple thief?

410
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,875
I'm not sure I understand.

411
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:35,166
Why would robbers demand
Heifong's independence?

412
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,375
I can't believe it!

413
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:38,583
This whole bomb scare is a sham!

414
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,500
Ugh! It was all just a decoy,

415
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,875
so they could empty
out the space station!

416
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,750
But why, Gene? I don't get it.

think now, Mr. Crackerjack.

420
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,958
I bet this is a dummy, too.

421
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,541
It'll explode no matter
which cord I cut!

422
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:08,958
Uh, If that's not it,
where's the real detonator?

423
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,041
I'm gonna take a look inside
that hatch that blew up first.

424
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:15,333
If my hunch is right, the
detonator's inside there!

425

Oh, I get it.

426
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:17,791
You would never
check a place again

427
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,375
that you've already looked at.

That's it, all right.

Jim. Can I still
use the buzz saw?

432
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,333
Well, if you're just
gonna cut a small hole,

gonna get this sucker!

real detonator in there,

436

what will you if you
find two cords again?

full of himself.

He'd most likely think

it was beneath him
to use the same trap.

00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:39,333
Well! We finally get
to meet, Crackerjack!

471
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:41,291
You?! That's impossible!

472
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:43,291
Oh, yeah, it's possible.

473
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:44,875
After we disarmed your bomb,

474
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:47,583
we ditched it and came straight
here to pay you a visit.

475
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,916
You son of a-- Ah!

476
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:53,208
[CRACKERJACK groaning]

477
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:56,166
That was a fun five
hours, Crackerjack.

478
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,833
[CRACKERJACK growls] Bastard!

479
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:00,166
[grunts]

480
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,833
[yells]

481
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:03,958
[groans]

482
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:08,416
[CRACKERJACK groans]

483
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,375
The countdown... is over.

484
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:54,166
[GENE] Those Kei guys have
finally gotten serious,

485
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,083
and now they're
trying to wipe us out.

486
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:57,291
There's seven of 'em!

487
00:24:57,375 --> 00:24:59,083
Who do I look like, Snow White?

488
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:00,583
This isn't gonna be easy.

489
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:03,083
They have all kinds of
tricks up their sleeves.

490
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:06,250
Anyway, looks like this story
is finally getting interesting!

491
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:08,791
But the taking care of it
is what makes it difficult.

492
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:11,708
Will somebody please get me
some more money for this gig?!

493
00:25:11,791 --> 00:25:15,625
Next time, on <i>Outlaw Star</i> :
"The Seven Emerge"!

494
00:25:15,708 --> 00:25:16,916
You better get ready!
