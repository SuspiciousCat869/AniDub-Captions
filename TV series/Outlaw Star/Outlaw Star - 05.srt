1
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,750
[NARRATOR] This young girl
grew up in the sun.

2
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:22,375
With joy, laughter,
and friendships.

3
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:24,000
She felt nothing
but the pleasure

4
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:26,416
of being in her
place in the sun.

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,708
This girl was born into
a proud, noble family,

6
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:32,666
surrounded by love, and
graduated with honors

7
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,458
from the highest academic
institution in the land.

8
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:40,291
Now, not graduating with honors
was only a faint shadow,

9
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:43,666
but in her land, where
respect was given to rank,

10
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,708
it held great meaning.

11
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:47,666
The post given to
those who graduated

12
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,791
with honor was space.

13
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:52,666
She was then cast out
of her place in the sun.

14
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,291
She had no other choice.

15
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:56,250
The choice was not hers.

16
00:00:56,333 --> 00:01:01,208
She was Officer Aisha Clanclan
of the Ctarl-Ctarl Empire.

17
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:04,208
Now the pleasure of her
lost place in the sun,

18
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:06,250
will never return.

19
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:07,583
[AISHA screeches]

20
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:11,208
[AISHA] It can't end like
this, I won't let it!

21
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:46,125
[beeping]

22
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,666
Hey, Swanzo, are you there?

23
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,833
Mikey, haven't I told you
before not to call me here?!

24
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,583
[MIKEY]
Sorry, it's an emergency.

25
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,791
Remember those people who were
with Hilda a while back?

26
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,541
Uhh, you talkin' about the kids?

27
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:57,958
They're asking for
docking clearance.

28
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:00,833
They want us to do somethin'
about the control room.

29
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,041
What do you mean?!

30
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,083
Horus shouldn't have
any trouble getting in.

31
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:05,416
And where is Hilda?

32
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,833
The ship isn't Horus, Swanzo.

33
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:11,708
And it doesn't look like Hilda's
with them from what I can tell.

34
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,125
Hilda's not with them?

35
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:23,791
[SWANZO]
I can't believe it.

36
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,208
Hilda's dead?

37
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,583
[GENE] Yep, believe it or not,
that's what happened.

38
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,166
This ship is all that was left.

39
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,958
[SWANZO]
I see.

40
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:36,000
So, what are you
gonna do now, sonny?

41
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,083
I don't know.

42
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,291
I don't understand
what's going on.

43
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:44,500
Hilda, the pirates, the Galactic
Leyline, MacDougall...

44
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:47,166
I'd like to start by figuring
some of this stuff out.

45
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,750
[SWANZO]
Mm. Be careful.

46
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,333
Could you do me a favor?

47
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:51,291
[SWANZO]
What?

48
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:52,708
Well, the <i>Outlaw Star</i> here

49
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,333
doesn't have a
registration number,

50
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:56,791
so we can't get into
any legitimate ports.

51
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,708
The ship isn't outfitted yet.

52
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:01,041
Hell, it hasn't
even been painted.

53
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,625
I see your point.

54
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,291
So, you got any money?

55
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:06,375
[GENE] Sorry, but I don't
have anything on me.

56
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,625
Around here, we don't
work for free!

57
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,500
How 'bout I pay ya
when I make it big?

58
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,666
Make it big?!

59
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,916
Hmph. Hey, this guy's
a piece of work!

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,833
[laughs]

61
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:15,833
[SWANZO]
Deal!

62
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:16,666
Huh?!

63
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,333
Swanzo, are you serious?!

64
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,125
[SWANZO]
I owe Hilda.

65
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:20,916
[MIKEY grunts]

66
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,375
Excuse me...

67
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:23,416
Now what?!

68
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,250
We're short on a lot
of other things.

69
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,666
She can fly but that's about it.

70
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,458
Like we also need
weapons and ammunition.

71
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,500
[SWANZO] The registration
number and paint job

72
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,541
will repay what I owe Hilda.

73
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:35,458
Wha...?!

74
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,000
[SWANZO]
Anyway, it's useless,

75
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:40,208
you can't get weapons
for a Grappler Ship here.

76
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:44,625
After that, you gotta make
it "big" understand, son?

77
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,500
All right, I understand.

78
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:47,125
One more thing...

79
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,666
Now what is it?!

80
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,708
I'd like you to give
me some information.

81
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,250
About this ship,

82
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,916
Hilda, MacDougall
and the pirates.

83
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,708
[SWANZO]
Five years ago, Hilda saved me

84
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:01,666
when I was under attack
by Ban Pirates.

85
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,750
That's when we first met.

86
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:06,875
All I know about her before
then are simply rumors.

87
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:09,250
Like the Galactic
Leyline she was after.

88
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,750
So, you two had a
cool relationship.

89
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,041
Cool?!

90
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,750
As far as I'm concerned,
it was pretty hot.

91
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,541
For "Hot Ice" Hilda, too.

92
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:20,083
"Hot Ice" Hilda?

93
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:21,625
[SWANZO]
Hilda's nickname.

94
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,750
Well, she didn't talk
about herself much.

95
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,375
No matter how hot it got.

96
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,416
She had a way of
keeping things secret.

97
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,208
[SWANZO] It was the Kei
Pirates who were after Hilda.

98
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,625
That's all I know.

99
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,250
And, MacDougall?

100
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,458
[SWANZO] He's a pro at
covering his tracks.

101
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,291
I don't know anything about him.

102
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,458
Huh. Suits me just fine.

103
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:42,083
Then I'll have to hunt down
his tracks by his scent.

104
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:45,208
[SWANZO] There is one other
thing you should know.

105
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:48,166
A Ctarl-Ctarl woman
was poking around here,

106
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,458
she was trying to find out where
Horus and Hilda might be.

107
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:54,541
She must be from that
ship! A Ctarl-Ctarl!

108
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:57,041
[SWANZO] That battleship of
theirs has already left.

109
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,416
Well, we'd better get to work.

110
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,416
Why don't you find something
to do in town for a day.

111
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,541
We appreciate it.

112
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,333
[SWANZO]
Ahh. Don't mention it.

113
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,625
And by the way, what's
your favorite color?

114
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,166
[GENE]
Hm?

115
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,041
[SWANZO] You have to decide
what color the hull's gonna be.

116
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,625
This color here, I guess.

117
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:13,833
[SWANZO]
Got it.

118
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,500
Gilliam, for one day
try to behave yourself.

119
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,208
[GILLIAM]
Very well.

120
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:28,333
[water running]

121
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,500
Hey, don't feel bad, cheer up!

122
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:31,583
[GENE]
Just drop it, Jim.

123
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:32,458
Uh?

124
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,458
Come on, Gene, I only tryn'--

125
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:37,166
[GENE] Look, she doesn't know
anything about herself.

126
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,958
Why should she feel sad?

127
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:39,791
Yeah, but...

128
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:40,500
[MELFINA]
It's all right.

129
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:41,916
Huh?!

130
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,583
I do feel the sense of sadness
about what has happened.

131
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:47,166
After all, Hilda is
the person who saved me,

132
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,208
I owe my life to her.

133
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:50,625
Did you say you're sad?

134
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:53,125
Ahh... Right, sad.

135
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,625
Ah, your just mad, Gene!

136
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:57,833
She says she feels that way,
so that's the way she feels!

137
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,958
I'm not mad!

138
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,333
Guess I could be.

139
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:17,250
So, you really don't
remember anything at all

140
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,375
before Hilda came along
and rescued you?

141
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:19,833
No.

142
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,500
Aw, damn.

143
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,541
Well, if you remember
anything, anything at all,

144
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:24,625
you be sure to tell us.

145
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:25,583
All right.

146
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,166
Uh. By the way, Gene,

147
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,125
do you think you've gotten over
that space phobia of yours yet?

148
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:31,875
I don't know.

149
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:35,125
It's still kinna
hard to breathe.

150
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,458
What am I gonna do?!

151
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,208
Man, it's a wonder
you were even able

152
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,166
to pilot the <i>Outlaw Star</i>
long enough to get us here.

153
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,583
It's different with that ship.

154
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,250
I don't know, I
guess it's 'cause...

155
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,291
I don't feel like I'm
all cooped up in there.

156
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:49,291
[MELFINA] That's the
Physical Navigation System.

157
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,333
[GENE sighs]
So you only remember stuff

158
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:54,333
about the ship, huh?

159
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,500
Yeah... It seems so.

160
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,583
I wish I could remember.

161
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:04,125
Anyway, let's go get somethin'
to eat! I'm starving! Huh?!

162
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:05,291
Whaddya say, you guys?!

163
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,083
[GENE]
Yeah, you're right. Let's go.

164
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,083
So, Melfina, what
do you wanna eat?

165
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,291
[MELFINA]
Oh, anything's fine.

166
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:11,333
[FEMALE STRANGER]
Hey, you people!

167
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,208
Hold it right there.

168
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:17,625
I've waited and waited,
and I'm not waiting anymore.

169
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:20,000
Oh, yeah. Who are you?

170
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,083
I wanna know where Hilda is.

171
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,791
Hey, what do you
know about Hilda?

172
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:26,541
I'm asking the questions
here. Stop wasting my time.

173
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,750
Now, you will answer me.
Where's Hilda?

174
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,541
Oh, really.
What'da we have here?

175
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:33,000
Another pushy little
lady making her entrance.

176
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:34,166
What's your name, huh?

177
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,666
My name is...

178
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,500
Aisha Clanclan!

179
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,541
She's a Ctarl-Ctarl, Gene!

180
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,458
Well, now I'm interested.

181
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:42,625
[AISHA]
I already happen to know

182
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,000
that you and Hilda
work together.

183
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:47,875
So, stop fooling around
and tell me where she is!

184
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:50,125
Look, sorry about
that little run-in.

185
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,958
We happen to be in
a bit of a hurry.

186
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:54,083
Your ship wasn't
damaged, was it?

187
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,250
There was plenty
of damage to me!

188
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,875
Now answer me!

189
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,916
Where is Hilda?!

190
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,916
Hilda's dead.

191
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,708
What did you say?!

192
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:05,000
Welp, that should
answer your question.

193
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,375
Okay, see ya!

194
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,875
Hold it right there!

195
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,375
Tell me the coordinates
of the Galactic Leyline!

196
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,833
Since you've worked with Hilda,
you should know that!

197
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:17,208
The Galactic Leyline?

198
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:20,166
Hmm... So that's
what you're after.

199
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,958
Tell me the coordinates!

200
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,750
'Kay, the coordinates are...

201
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:24,958
Now listen carefully.

202
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,416
Mm... Mm-hm.

203
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,500
[inhales] Exactly what the
hell I'd like to know!

204
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:31,583
Damn you!

205
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:32,875
That's nof funny!

206
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:34,666
We're tellin' you
the truth! We don't know!

207
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,250
So you're gonna play
dumb to the bitter end.

208
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:40,250
Then I'll have to pull the
answer out of you by force.

209
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,916
Hey, cut it out! I don't
wanna have to fight a girl!

210
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,083
That's not my style.

211
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,666
It's not open for discussion!

212
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,583
Well then, in that case...

213
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:48,625
Uh! Run!

214
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:51,958
[AISHA]
Uh... You cowards!

215
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,666
[AISHA yells]

216
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,041
Aw, Gene! No!

217
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:56,083
Damn it! Huh?

218
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:56,875
[AISHA yells]

219
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:57,958
[GENE]
Look out!

220
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,083
[yelps]

221
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,708
Aw, no! This is
really bad, Gene!

222
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,541
That's a Ctarl-Ctarl
you're fighting!

223
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,583
[AISHA screams]

224
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,375
[AISHA grunts]

225
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,250
[AISHA screeches]

226
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,041
[GENE grunts]

227
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,916
Huh? Oh, no...

228
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:28,875
Not bad.

229
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,083
[GENE]
Ctarl-Ctarl, whaddya know.

230
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:34,083
You guys just act like
average assassins.

231
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:37,875
Well you just had to go ahead
and pick a fight with me. Huh?!

232
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,041
Hey, I was just kidding!

233
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:47,375
[AISHA] I will teach you the
true terror of the Ctarl-Ctarl.

234
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,833
You will soon regret!

235
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,041
[AISHA laughs]

236
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,458
Now what the hell's
she doing, Jim?

237
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,166
Oh, no, I remember!

238
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,250
The Ctarl-Ctarl.
Those guys are metamorphs!

239
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,416
Metamorphs?

240
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,541
They change into an animal
that's viscious!

241
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,375
Did you call me an animal?

242
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:17,916
Just watch this power
inherited from my ancestors!

243
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,791
Ahh!

244
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,541
This is bad, Gene!

245
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,875
This form here, that can
crush an entire human,

246
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,166
is usually kept in
check for a reason!

247
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,333
Its power is severely amplified

248
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:30,666
by the phases of
the planet's moon!

249
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,875
[GENE, JIM]
Hm?

250
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,250
Uh, Blue Heaven
doesn't have a moon.

251
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:35,500
Huh?

252
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,291
Oh...?

253
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,250
Come to think of it,
it doesn't.

254
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,291
Idiot. Now run!

255
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,125
Hey!

256
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,083
Come back here!

257
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,958
Oh! Oh...

258
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,458
Hold it!

259
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,958
Hey, Gene!

260
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,625
[AISHA]
Come back here!

261
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:52,541
[GENE]
Jim!

262
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:53,750
Go buy some shells!

263
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,250
Buy what shells?!

264
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:56,208
[GENE]
Caster shells!

265
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,083
[AISHA]
Hold it!

266
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,541
Come back here!

267
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,208
Oh, great.

268
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,041
Doubt there shells around here.

269
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,625
Now what?

270
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:30,375
That was close, looks like
we finally lost her.

271
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:34,500
Uh... [gasping]

272
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:39,375
[MELFINA]
Oh, no, are you all right, Gene?

273
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:43,083
There's a bench over there
where you can sit down.

274
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:56,208
[GENE]
Maybe I'll never get over this.

275
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:05,833
Hey, what's the matter with you?

276
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,416
Haven't you seen flowers before?

277
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,791
[MELFINA]
They're artificial.

278
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,583
These flowers were made.

279
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,500
Just like me.

280
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,666
[MELFINA]
Why was I made?

281
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,000
Who made me?

282
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:23,541
And what did they make me for?

283
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:26,208
I--

284
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,958
Who am I and why am I here?

285
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:43,375
I've never seen an
android like you before.

286
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:44,916
Even when I'm this close to you,

287
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,875
I can't tell that
you're not human.

288
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,291
You eat. You feel sad.

289
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:53,625
You're even able to worry
about your own existence.

290
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,958
I bet Hilda could have
given me the answer,

291
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,708
but now she's no longer here.

292
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:02,833
[yelps]

293
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,541
Ow! That hurts!

294
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:08,291
Please stop doing that to me!

295
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,583
You're surprised!

296
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:10,750
You feel pain!

297
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:14,250
You even complain. [laughs]

298
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:18,375
Bet you could search the galaxy
and never find one like you.

299
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,333
Don't worry.

300
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,708
I'll find you an answer someday.

301
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,750
You're my responsibility now.

302
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,750
I promised Hilda I'd to take
care of you and I'm going to.

303
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,125
Take care of me?

304
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,708
Yeah, and our having another
mystery or two to solve

305
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,416
won't really
change anything.

306
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,875
Don't worry, Melfina.

307
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,541
I'll find your past.

308
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:36,583
Ah!

309
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:37,958
[GENE]
But to be perfectly honest,

310
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,750
we don't have a single
clue to go on.

311
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,083
Of course, asking the pirates
would be the easiest thing,

312
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,500
but there's now way,
I'd rather eat shit.

313
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,750
[MELFINA]
Yeah, I feel the same way.

314
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,791
You'd rather eat shit? Heh.

315
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:52,583
No! I mean-- I guess so.

316
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:55,875
[GENE]
Melfina.

317
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:59,125
It'll be a long road, but I'd
like for you to come with us.

318
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:03,375
[MELFINA]
If I won't be too much trouble.

319
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,250
You won't be any trouble!

320
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,833
Anyway, without you,
it would be a royal pain

321
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:10,166
in the you-know-what
to fly the <i>Outlaw Star</i> .

322
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,916
[gasps] Right!

323
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,583
All right, that settles it!

324
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:15,875
Jim, you there?

325
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,375
You read me, Jim?
Where are you?

326
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,416
Some place that most likely...

327
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,875
...doesn't have shells.

328
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,583
[GENE] It looks like
we gave her the slip.

329
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,041
Let's meet at the corner.

330
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:25,666
Okay.

331
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,750
[GENE screams]

332
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:29,166
Uh?! What is it?
What's goin' on, Gene?

333
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,166
Be a good boy and
give yourself up.

334
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,041
Damn, you're persistent!

335
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:33,916
[AISHA]
Shut up!

336
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,291
[AISHA yells]

337
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,375
Stand back, Mel! [grunts]

338
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:40,291
[AISHA yells]

339
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,250
[AISHA, GENE grunting]

340
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:44,000
[AISHA groans]

341
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,916
[AISHA]
Hmph.

342
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,833
[GENE gasps]

343
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:59,666
[AISHA chuckles]

344
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,041
Huh?

345
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,583
Uh...

346
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,333
Uh. Ah!

347
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,166
What's the hell's that
skin of yours made of?

348
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,458
That was just half
of my strength.

349
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:11,791
I think I'll show what our
full beast power is like! Huh!

350
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:15,958
[AISHA grunting]

351
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:19,750
[AISHA yelling]

352
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,833
[AISHA groaning]

353
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:24,916
[GENE]
Oh?

354
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,875
I mus'ta... burnt
too many calories.

355
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,833
So, just because
of what happened

356
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:46,708
they deliberately stranded
you here at Blue Heaven?

357
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:50,833
[AISHA] I have a title as...
Resident Officer. Ha, ha.

358
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:53,166
But don't you get
some kind of salary?

359
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,333
[AISHA] I just don't get
any money from the empire.

360
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,750
Ah... Ah!

361
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,875
Yeah. If I'd used my own
money to track you down,

362
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,958
I would've been
broke in no time!

363
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,458
If we're not careful, guys,

364
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:07,833
she's gonna eat the food
right off our plates.

365
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,291
Hey, these are delicious!
You wanna try'em?

366
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:14,208
Oh, thank you very much.

367
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,458
Man, you can really chow down.

368
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,791
That was suppose to
feed four people.

369
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:25,791
May I...

370
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:26,500
[JIM]
Yeah?

371
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:27,750
[GENE]
What now?

372
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:30,458
Yum! I'm ready for seconds!

373
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,250
Ah, suit yourself.

374
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,541
Gimme another!
Gimme another!

375
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:38,458
In any case, we
don't know anything!

376
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:41,666
We don't have any information
that would be of use to you.

377
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,375
[AISHA screams]

378
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,041
You know, these are good!

379
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:53,875
They sure are!
I think I'll have some, too!

380
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,291
[AISHA sighs]

381
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:58,208
I'm so stuffed! I couldn't
possibly eat another bite!

382
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:59,791
Okay, look.

383
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,708
I offered to buy you dinner
because I felt a little guilty.

384
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,500
Now, I'd say this
makes us even--

385
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,875
[AISHA grunting]

386
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,583
Ha, ha!

387
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,416
What the hell are you doing?

388
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,375
[AISHA laughs]

389
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:18,791
What a sucker!
You Terrans are such saps!

390
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,833
A measly contribution like this

391
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:23,000
would never appease
a Ctarl-Ctarl!

392
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,166
[JIM sighs]

393
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,875
"Appease"?! Now wait
just a minutes here!

394
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,375
Understand this,
a proud Ctarl-Ctarl

395
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,541
pays no heed to an
enemy's compassion!

396
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,666
Well, I don't think
I do understand,

397
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,083
so there must be something
wrong with your standard.

398
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,416
[AISHA]
Silence!

399
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,958
Don't tell me that you
don't know anything!

400
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,916
In the name of
Ctarl-Ctarl Empire,

401
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,833
I place you under arrest!

402
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,666
If you have a
problem with that...

403
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,000
You're gonna turn
back into an animal?

404
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,500
Who are you calling an animal?!

405
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,000
[clears throat]

406
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,375
Transformed, my strength
would be enough

407
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:55,875
to rip both of you to shreds!

408
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:57,625
Now I have more
than enough energy

409
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,208
to use all of my beast strength!

410
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,458
And who do you have
to thank for that?

411
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:04,416
You don't expect any
gratitude, do ya?

412
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,416
Do you honestly think that
would work on a Ctarl-Ctarl?

413
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,875
Man, these Ctarl-Ctarl really
are somethin' else, you know.

414
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,500
Might as well use this, Gene.

415
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:14,416
Hey, you found one?!

416
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,000
[JIM]
Yeah, a Number 12.

417
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,500
The guy overcharged me like you
wouldn't believe, but go ahead.

418
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:19,791
I'll okay it.

419
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,750
I knew you could do it, partner!

420
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,625
Perhaps you don't understand,

421
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:29,291
because a gun will never work
on an immortal Ctarl-Ctarl.

422
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,000
Is that so?

423
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,708
[AISHA screaming]

424
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:41,541
[GENE]
You are an immortal Ctarl-Ctarl.

425
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:46,458
Waiter, you can just put
everything on her tab.

426
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:49,833
She says that she's the
Ctarl-Ctarl Resident Officer.

427
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,541
And don't let her
weasel out of it!

428
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:54,250
[meows]

429
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:01,666
[JIM]
Whoa! Totally awesome!

430
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,583
[GENE]
Nice!

431
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,166
[SWANZO] I've also gotten the
ship's registration number.

432
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,458
I gave it to the
ship's computer.

433
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,541
What is it with that
geezer computer?

434
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:15,125
That damn thing never
seems to shut up!

435
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:16,541
I know what your sayin', man,

436
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,041
but we can't do
anything about it.

437
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,291
He's totally integrated
with the ship.

438
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,708
[GILLIAM] Pardon me, but,
if I'm not mistaken,

439
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,791
wasn't that an indirect insult?

440
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,666
Hey! Stay out of it!

441
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,000
[GILLIAM] I'm worried about
my future prospects, Gene.

442
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,500
[GENE]
Up yours!

443
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,708
I really appreciate
the help, Swanzo, Mikey.

444
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,625
[SWANZO] Sure. So, what
are you going to do now?

445
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:36,958
Well, for the time being,

446
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,083
I guess we'll plan to head
on back to Sentinel III.

447
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,583
After that, it's
all up in the air.

448
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,416
[SWANZO]
Ah...

449
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,041
[SWANZO] The territory
of the Kei Pirates,

450
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,750
the ones who were after Hilda,

451
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:51,250
was originally around here,
the Tenpa Empire.

452
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:55,083
The area we're in, is inside
the Ban Pirates' territory.

453
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:59,208
Those Kei guys probably won't
do anything too drastic, but,

454
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:03,041
you should be careful if
you go out past Heifong.

455
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:04,541
[GENE]
Got it.

456
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,416
So, what're you plannin' on
doin' back on Sentinel III?

457
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,041
I'll use some connections I
have to get parts and weapons

458
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,458
that we're a little
bit short on.

459
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:11,791
Gene! No way!

460
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,625
Are you really
gonna contact him?!

461
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,500
Like we have a choice, Jim.

462
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:18,250
A broker on Sentinel III?
Are you talking about...

463
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,500
...Fred Luo?

464
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,166
Hm! You've heard of Luo?!

465
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:25,291
[SWANZO] Yeah, I've had some
cool deals with his father.

466
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,000
Yeah, well, if I had the chance

467
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:29,458
I'd pass on any hot
deals with Fred!

468
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:31,333
Come on, you can't, Gene!

469
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,416
Hey, he's not one
of the bad guys.

470
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,583
Don't worry.
Nothin's gonna go wrong.

471
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:37,958
Hey, thanks for the help.

472
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:40,125
We just might need it again
someday, and if we do,

473
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,750
you know we'll be sure
to come callin'.

474
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,416
Yeah, well, be sure
to make it big,

475
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,791
cause I'm not working
for free any more.

476
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:48,666
[SWANZO gibberish]

477
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,250
Is that Corbonese?

478
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,083
[SWANZO]
Oops! I-I mean. Uh...

481
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:05,458

requesting clearence
to leave port, now!

483
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:09,208
[GILLIAM]
We have just receive clearence,

We will follow beacons

486
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:15,458
to depart Blue Heaven space.

487
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:19,250
Aw, Fred Luo,
I cannot believe it.

488
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:21,875
Is he really as awful
as you say he is?

489
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:24,541
Nah. You don't have anything
to worry about, Melfina.

490
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:25,875
'Cause you're a girl.

491
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:28,208
Oh, does he have a
problem with men?

492
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:30,791
It's all right. It'll be okay!

493
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:32,791
Don't worry about it,
all right, Jim?!

494
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:34,625
Aw...

495
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:37,541
No way! No way! No way!

496
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:43,375
Let's get goin' <i>Outlaw Star</i> ,
it's time to launch!

497
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,166
Damn it!

498
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,916
How could I be forced
to such menial labor?!

499
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,500
I'm one of the proud
Ctarl-Ctarl.

500
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:00,291
Terran, you'll pay for this!

501
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:02,625
Mark my words!

502
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:04,250
[MANAGER]
Hey!

503
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:05,791
Stop goofin' around!

504
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:07,541
Get back to work,
you freeloader!

505
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:09,458
I-- Y-Yes, sir!

506
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:15,666
I'll remember this!

507
00:24:49,583 --> 00:24:51,958
[GENE] A beautiful
assassin named Suzuka

508
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:54,875
comes after my old
friend, Fred Luo!

509
00:24:54,958 --> 00:24:58,458
This assassin is very
cunning and ruthless.

510
00:24:58,541 --> 00:25:00,125
So, I set aside my policy

511
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:02,083
of getting along
with pretty ladies,

512
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:04,333
and decide to risk myself
in order to protect

513
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:07,583
my precious source of
money--uh, ah, friend!

514
00:25:07,666 --> 00:25:09,000
But, hey, come on,

515
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:13,375
a beautiful woman is a terrible
thing to waste, right?!

516
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:15,125
Next time, on <i>Outlaw Star</i> :

517
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:16,541
"The Beautiful Assassin"!

518
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:17,750
You better get ready!
