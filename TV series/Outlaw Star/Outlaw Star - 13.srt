00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,250
[NARRATOR]
When humanity was spreading

2
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:22,666
their colonies out into
space, as to be expected,

3
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,541
there were many encounters
with alien races.

4
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:28,541
These encounters sometimes
gave rise to war.

5
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:31,125
And other times,
discussion ended in

6
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:34,083
the establishment
of friendly relations.

7
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:36,166
There are currently
six alien races

8
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,416
that mankind has encountered.

9
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,041
Comparatively speaking,

10
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:43,125
the Nayans and Corbonites
are friendly towards humans.

11
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:44,833
The Silgrians, however,

12
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:48,166
have been considered by
most, to be too friendly.

13
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,833
Humanity's relationship with
the Lorgans is somewhat bad,

14
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:56,000
and there are obstacles in
even associating with the Sith.

15
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,583
After countless battles
with the Ctarl,

16
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:01,000
trade treaties were
finally concluded.

17
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:04,041
As humanity's sphere
of influence expands,

18
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:07,000
further encounters
probably await them.

19
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:10,583
There is a lesson to be learned
from the example of the past.

20
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:13,291
Meetings are merely
the beginning.

21
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,833
Everything begins
with understanding.

22
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:19,208
One lesson learned from
love can be applied to you.

23
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:22,125
Encounters are always abrupt.

24
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:19,958
[phone ringing]

25
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,833
Hello, this is Starwind
and Hawking Enterprises,

26
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:24,916
can we help you?

27
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,083
Yes, sir.

28
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes, we handle
interplanetary transport,

29
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,875
but our ship's payload's
fairly small.

30
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,166
What's the cargo?

31
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,750
Ah! That would be a
problem. I'm sorry.

32
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,500
[GENE]
Yeah. Please call again, sir.

33
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,041
What did he say?

34
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,041
He asked if we could haul some
huge construction equipment

35
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,500
in the Outlaw Star, but come on,

36
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:44,916
there's no way we
could handle that.

37
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,333
[JIM]
Hmm...

38
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,375
[sighs]

39
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:51,875
There's gotta be something out
there, some job for us to do.

40
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:54,041
I posted some really
good ads on the net,

41
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,291
but the responses aren't
even worth mentioning.

42
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:57,791
Yeah, forget it.

43
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,583
The only thing that those jobs
are worth is chump change.

44
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:02,208
Gene, we've gotta get a job,
no matter how rotten it is.

45
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,458
Our wallet's in bad shape.

46
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,708
I don't know if we
can be so picky.

47
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:09,333
[GILLIAM] Spaceport parking fees
are ridiculously expensive.

48
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,375
I know, the parking is
practically on the street,

49
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,375
and it still costs way too much.

50
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:14,958
[GILLIAM]
It can't be helped.

51
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:18,333
In the big city like this, we
were lucky to even find a spot.

52
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:19,375
[JIM]
Ah...

53
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,083
Thanks a lot, Melfina.

54
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,458
Don't mention it.

55
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:25,208
You still haven't been
able to find any work, Jim?

56
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,791
If Gene wasn't so picky,
we might have some.

57
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,458
Come on, if we don't turn
a profit, what's the point?

58
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:31,750
[bell rings]

59
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,208
Hey, maybe it's a customer.

60
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:34,083
How can we help--

61
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,875
How's business doin', everyone?

62
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:37,500
Oh, it's only you.

63
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:38,375
Okay, I guess.

64
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,875
Yeah, we've got nothing!

65
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:40,416
[JIM]
Hmph!

66
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,583
[AISHA laughs]

67
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,875
I knew that. But
there's no problem.

68
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,833
You don't have to
worry about a thing.

69
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,625
That's why you find
me standing here.

70
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,375
I came to offer you two a job.

71
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,208
Oh, yeah? Well, what is it?

72
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,291
Well, they tell me that
in the downtown area

73
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,833
by the Heifong Spaceport,

74
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:58,166
there's a ferocious animal that
happens to be in the sewers.

75
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,000
Rumor has it it's a
runaway pet or something.

76
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,833
Anyway, the job is
to exterminate it

77
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,083
as soon as possible.

78

[AISHA growls]

81
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,458
What is wrong with you?!
Did you hear anything I said?

82
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:16,416
I heard you, you expect
us to go into the sewer?

83
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,666
This job smells fishy, Aisha.

84
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,583
Whaddya mean? It was
posted by the Heifong

85
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,125
Municipal Waterworks
Department, so it's legit!

86
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:24,708
Yeah, but how much does it pay?

87
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,333
Five hundred wong!

What's the big idea?!

94
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,208
Fine, if that's the
way you guys want it,

95
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,875
I'll just go do the job myself!

96
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,333
And you'll be sorry!

[grunts]

98
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,750
When people can't accept a
little kindness gracefully,

99
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:47,375
it's gonna be all
over for humanity!

100
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,833
Can you believe it? Gimme a
break! What was she thinking?

101
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,250
It's sounds like a 500-wong job.

102

Hey, Gilliam, what about you?
Have you heard of any good work?

--Who's that?

Hey look, Gene, it
could be a job offer.

106
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,666
Hi there, Jim! How's
business been going?

107
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,458
Oh, hi, Fred! How ya doin'?
Uh, yeah! Hi, how are ya?

108
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,041
Uh...

109
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,666
If it's about the money we owe
you, we can't pay you back yet.

110
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,125
[FRED]
I figured as much,

111
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:14,500
so I thought I'd tell you
about a job that's come up.

112
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,583
Actually, a business
associate of mine

113
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,583
has gotten into
some odd trouble.

114
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,375
[JIM]
Uh... What kind?

115
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:23,500
Well, he brought some cargo
over from the Silgry system.

116
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,375
But when he arrived
here on Heifong,

117
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,375
the cargo had
suddenly disappeared.

118
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:30,041
And he asked me to get
you two to look into it.

119
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,375
Eh, why doesn't he just
let the cops handle it?

120
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,125
[FRED] That's totally
out of the question!

121
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,000
It's just shy
of smuggling.

122
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:36,916
Like weapons?

123
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,875
It's a new species of insect.

127

How much is the
job paying, Fred?

128
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,625
[FRED]
Seven hundred up front,

129
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:49,083
plus two thousand if the
cargo is returned safely.

130

I see and where do I go?

Great! He's a Silgrian.

He'll be on dock eight at
the spaceport right by you.

00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,500
I'll call ahead and
tell him you're coming.

you're working for Fred.

afford to be picky!

come along soon; don't worry.

me to come along with you?

[VENDOR] He's gotta be
breaking some kinda law!

159
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,500
How else could he be
making such a killing

160
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:54,875
when it tastes like that?!

161
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:57,375
Thanks to him, my business
is in the toilet!

162
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,416
There's something about that
ice cream that isn't normal!

163
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,458
I know it! And I want you--

164
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,833
[GILLIAM] You didn't even
ask him what he would pay.

165
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,041
I am not an investigator.

166
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,041
Huh?

167
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,208
Hm...

168
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:11,125
[GENE]
Hello.

169
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,458
Remember me?

170
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:13,833
Yeah, it's Gene.

171
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,375
[GILLIAM] Gene, did you
think of a good job?

172
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,416
[groans] What was that for?!

173
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,000
Yeah, that's right, I promised
you I would, didn't I?

174
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,208
So listen, I was wondering

175
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:23,875
if we could go out for
dinner or something.

176
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:26,541
[GILLIAM] And to think
I call that man, Captain.

177
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:32,041
[SILGRIAN] Hmm... I really
don't know what to make of this.

178
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,250
It happened five days ago.

179
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,250
I had a break after I landed,

180
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:39,208
and I figured I'd get down to
business, when I noticed that

181
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:42,083
the container was empty,
just like you see here.

182
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,583
If something isn't done,
I'm'a take a bath on this one!

183
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:47,375
Come on, now honestly,
what cargo did you have?

184
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,333
All right, Fred
recommended you two,

185
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:52,458
so I'll let you in on it,
confidentially speaking...

186
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:55,375
It was an extremely
rare insect and plant.

187
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:58,291
Well, did you ever think the
insect could've run away?

188
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,958
By opening the container
and the hatch on my ship?

189
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,625
[scoffs]
No, that's simply impossible.

190
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:06,541
Even if that were the situation,
what about the plant?

191
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,541
Maybe the bug got
hungry and ate it.

192
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:11,333
[SILGRIAN] Also impossible,
it's carnivorous!

193
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:12,666
They were stolen.

194
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,541
My crew and I have
looked everywhere,

195
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:18,541
but as you can see there's
no sign of 'em, none!

196
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,041
Is it true that the police
can't be of any help?

197
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,375
[SILGRIAN]
We can't go to the police

198
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,625
because we didn't apply
for any import entry

199
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:27,375
for either the insect
or the plant.

200
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:29,208
Now, you don't need to
worry about a thing.

201
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,083
They don't carry
any harmful viruses

202
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,458
or diseases you can catch.

203
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:35,625
We've checked all that out,
right here on our own.

204
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,250
You do understand.

205
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:40,083
It's such a bother to have to
go through all that red tape.

206
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:42,083
[JIM]
Uh... I guess so.

207
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,625
Come to think of it, now that
I look back on the situation,

208
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,583
I can't imagine why
for the life of me,

209
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,375
I ever took such a giant risk.

210
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:51,958
[JIM] So, what kinda bug
and plant are they, anyway?

211
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,166
[SILGRIAN]
I'll give you the catalogue

212
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,333
I put together for the sale.

213
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:58,208
The plant looks and feels like
one of those "cactusy" things

214
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,458
that grows in the world
where y'all are from.

215
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,750
Guess he means a
regular ol' cactus.

216
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,458
[SEWER MAN] My workers said
they saw it right in here,

217
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,708
that's what they said.

218
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:12,958
The reports that I heard

219
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,375
claimed that it was some
big meat-eating animal.

220
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,125
But that's a little
hard to believe.

221
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:20,000
You don't have to worry anymore,
Aisha's here to handle it.

222
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,750
Yeah, there's no doubt about it,
we were definitely fortunate

223
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,250
enough to get a Ctarl-Ctarl
to handle this matter.

224
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,166
Well, I'm gonna leave you now,
so you can do your work.

225
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,208
[AISHA]
You can count on me!

226
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,500
All right, monster!
Aisha's coming!

227
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:39,583
You better stay put
and be a good boy now!

228
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:45,666
[laughing continues]

229
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,375
[JIM]
We're back!

230
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,333
Hey, Gene? It's you!

231
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,166
Welcome back. Hello there, Jim.

232
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,583
You the only one here?
Where's Gene?

233
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:59,458
I have no idea. He was
already gone when I arrived.

234
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:03,333
Huh, I wonder. Maybe there
was a big job that came in.

235
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,166
So, why are you here, Suzuka?

236
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,666
No particular reason.

237
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,625
I just simply decided
I would come by

238
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,416
to see how business
is coming along.

239
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,041
Eh, we're getting by, I guess.

240
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,166
Well, Melfina, I was
just thinking' I should

241
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,375
do a little diggin' in
the pet market over there.

242
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,750
That's a good idea, Jim.

243
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,958
Should I check the
spaceport's security section

244
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,708
and see if anything unusual
happened five days ago?

245
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,000
Yeah! That'd be great.

246
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,583
[chair rattles]

247
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:28,375
[SUZUKA] You seem to be rather
busy, so I'll be leaving now.

248
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,083
Oh, okay. See you later.

249
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,541
[SUZUKA] Please give Gene
my regards, won't you?

250
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,791
Huh? Hey! Hi!

251
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,208
Hi!

252
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,291
I'm sorry, have you
been waiting long?

253
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,333
No, no problem. I just got here.

254
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,625
So, how you doin'?
You have any free time now?

255
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:50,000
Well, now that the race is
over, that's all I have.

256
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,541
I still think that was amazing,

257
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:54,583
a Privateer making fourth
place in his first race.

258
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,791
If we hadn't run into trouble,
we would've been first.

259
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,250
But let's not talk
about that now,

260
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,208
why don't we go get
some tea or something?

261
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:01,458
[CLAIRE]
Sure.

262
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:02,625
To tell you the truth,

263
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,250
I still don't know
Heifong City very well.

264
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,666
So how about you? Do you know
of any good places around here?

265
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,458
Yes, let's keep walking and
I'll show you all around.

266
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:10,666
Sounds great.

267
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,750
[CLAIRE]
So, what are you up to now?

268
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,625
[GENE] Well, we started
our business again,

269
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,666
Starwind and Hawking
Enterprises.

270
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,291
We sell solutions to
any kind of problem.

271
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:21,583
How's business going?

272
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:22,625
[GENE]
Okay.

273
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,000
That's right,
how could I forget,

274
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,250
you finished fourth in
the Heifong Space race.

275
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:27,708
Of course, you're doing well.

276
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,208
Yeah, right.

277
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,708
[CLAIRE] Are you sure you can
take time away to meet me?

278
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:36,541
My seeing you is much more
important than work-- Huh?

279
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:40,500
I just got this great idea!
Let's get some ice cream!

280
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:41,666
I-Ice cream?

281
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,583
Come on, right over there!

282
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,083
I feel like having some all
of a sudden, isn't that funny?

283
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,791
It never used to
be this popular.

284
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,500
Maybe they changed the recipe.

285
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:54,750
It's sounds great!

286
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,333
For some reason, I feel
like having some, too.

287
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,041
Oh, good! I'll go
buy us some, then.

288
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,250
Hey, let me get that--

289
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,333
[CLAIRE]
Fourth Place Winner!

290
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:01,833
It's my treat!

291
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:05,083
Uh-- Hm...

292
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,458
What the...?

293
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:09,708
[VENDOR] Well, there's
something funny about

294
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,750
the ice cream vender next door!

295
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,833
[CLAIRE]
Sorry it took so long!

296
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:17,208
Oh! Hey, thanks a lot.

297
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,083
[GENE]
Hm...

298
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,916
Hey, this ice cream
seems pretty average.

299
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,916
Yeah, I agree.

300
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,833
[BOTH]
Hm... Huh?

301
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:50,500
[JIM]
Here?

302
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,000
[MELFINA]
That's right.

303
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,583
Five days ago, the fence around
here was completely bent.

304
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,458
But, now it looks like
they've already fixed it.

305
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,041
And the security systems?

306
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,166
They are equipped with both

307
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,375
infrared detectors
and metal detectors,

308
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,750
but it appears as though
nothing has set them off.

309
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:08,125
Yeah, I guess they could be
set off by a measly old insect.

310
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,916
[MELFINA]
So, maybe it did run away.

311
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,541
[JIM]

00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,458
Stop it! Stop, I tell you!

471
00:20:56,541 --> 00:21:00,083
How dare you! How dare you!
You lower animal! Stop!

472
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:04,458
Stop it! I-I shouldn't have
to beg! I insist you stop!

473
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,708
Please stop! Stop it!

474
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:10,458
Now, I beg of you!
Please! Stop! Stop!

475
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:11,708
Please...!

476
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:14,541
It's all mashed up.

477
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,500
It sure is! Now, you're
not gonna make me eat

478
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,750
anymore of that crappy
ice cream, are you?

479
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:21,208
Why would you eat
crappy ice cream?

480
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:22,291
[sirens]

481
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:23,958
Oh no, now what?!

482
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:27,166
I'm gonna go and
kill that monster!

483
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,250
I won't let the cops
have all the glory!

484
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:33,541
Oh great, what a mess. That
Silgrian is gonna take a fall,

485
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,416
and now, we're not gonna
see any money out of it.

486
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,083
Yeah, that's what I would guess.

487
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,958
Well, anyway, I'm amazed
that you could stand up

488
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:41,375
to that thing's control
like you did, Melfina.

489
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:44,625
Don't you remember, Gene,
I'm not like normal people.

490
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:47,041
--Huh?
--I know you're not.

491
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,625
And that's exactly
what saved Jim.

492
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:52,333
Yeah, he's right about that.
Thanks a lot, Melfina.

493
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:53,625
Sure.

494
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,125
[JIM]
Looks like that Silgrian was

495
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:02,625
under the Great One's control
when he brought it here.

496
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:03,875
They say it was a capsule

497
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:06,250
that the Space Forces
found in deep space.

498
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,875
And they have no knowledge
of there being any others.

499
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,125
[GILLIAM]
I see.

500
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:12,250
After all we did, all
we have to show for it

501
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:14,666
is a 700 wong deposit?!

502
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,625
What about you?

503
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:16,958
[GENE]
Hm? Who? Me?

504
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:19,166
Yeah, you were there on
the job, too, weren't you?

505
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,791
Uh, yeah, but you
know what happened,

506
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:23,125
all that ruckus blew the
whole thing out the window.

507
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,458
Oh, if only... Aw, man...

508
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:28,333
If it weren't for that lousy
ice cream and that stupid plant,

509
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:29,916
I would've scored for sure.

510
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,291
--Scored, Gene?
--[GENE stammers]

511
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:32,875
Yeah, I mean, it's
just an expression,

512
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:34,708
with that big job, you
know what I'm saying.

513
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:37,000
[GILLIAM]
Oh, really? You don't say.

514
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:38,666
Would you just shut
that can of yours

515
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,291
and mind your own
business for once?

516
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:41,291
[SUZUKA]
Good day.

517
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:43,041
[BOTH]
How can we help you-- Ugh.

518
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:44,541
[GENE]
Oh, it's you...

519
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:46,958
I was just wondering
how business is doing.

520
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:47,708
Not bad!

521
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:49,458
It's not doing at all.

522
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:50,958
--Hmph!
--[GENE groans]

523
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:52,458
I thought that
might be the case.

524
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:55,250
That's why I decided to come
by and tell you about a job.

525
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:56,791
What job?

526
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,125
There's a theme park in the
suburbs outside Heifong City,

527
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:00,666
and they're looking
for people to perform

528
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,500
in a quick-draw Wild West show.

529
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:03,875
[BOTH]
Huh?

530
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:06,708
[SUZUKA yelps]

531
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:08,541
What's the meaning
of this?! How rude!

532
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:11,250
I'm telling you, if people can't
accept kindness gracefully,

533
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:13,750
it's all over for humanity!

534
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:14,958
I sure hope a good job

535
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:16,750
--comes in soon.

[JIM]
Hello?

537
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:20,666
I see, sir!

538
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,916
Gene, they need a tugboat!

539
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,958
We'll take it!

540
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:25,208
We don't have a choice.

541
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:27,291
I just hope something
else'll turn up soon.

542
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:05,083
[GENE] We're looking at a little
bomb-defusing action this time!

543
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:08,791
And I'm afraid to say, my life's
final countdown has begun!

544
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:10,916
What am I gonna do, damnit?!

545
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,208
I'm no good at
these delicate jobs.

546
00:25:13,291 --> 00:25:16,458
And I'm so stressed out that
I can't even take a leak!

547
00:25:16,541 --> 00:25:18,083
You understand, right?

548
00:25:18,166 --> 00:25:21,083
If I'm not careful... boom!

549
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:23,541
Next time, on <i>Outlaw Star</i> :

550
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:25,250
"Final Countdown"!

551
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:26,666
You better get ready!
