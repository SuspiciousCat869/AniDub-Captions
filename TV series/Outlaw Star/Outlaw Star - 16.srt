1
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,250
[NARRATOR]
It was the brain

2
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:23,125
of ether physicist
Dr. Sam Kaseinpow,

3
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:25,875
the Chosong Science
Company's Technology Group

4
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:28,875
that was led by
Professor Hata Ikkei.

5
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:31,208
The donation of enormous
amounts of capital

6
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:35,416
made by every country,
and above all, Dragonite,

7
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,375
that made the Munchhausen
Drive a reality.

8
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:41,166
In year 1 of the
Toward Stars calendar,

9
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,208
an unknown crystalline
material, Dragonite,

10
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:45,750
was discovered in a meteorite

11
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:49,125
that crashed in the Arashan
Desert in northern China.

12
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:50,583
It was found to be a catalyst

13
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:52,750
that released tremendous
amounts of energy

14
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:55,166
from the inexhaustible ether.

15
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:59,291
In search of Dragonite,
humanity stampeded into space.

16
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:02,750
It could be considered the
gold rush of the Space Age.

17
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:05,458
But Dragonite was an
extremely rare substance

18
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:07,708
in the vastness of space.

19
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:10,958
An alchemical method of
synthesizing it artificially

20
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:13,000
is being researched
at this time,

21
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:15,375
but has yet to be perfected.

22
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:19,750
As a non-renewable resource,
Dragonite is highly valued,

23
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:21,875
and is considered
to be the rarest,

24
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:25,708
most valuable substance
in the universe.

25
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:34,458
Uh-huh! That sure smells good!

26
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:35,791
Uh?

27
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:41,791
Hey, part-timer! What're you
doing just standin' around?!

28
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,125
Take it to that table!

29
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:44,500
Yes, sir!

30
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:46,750
Sorry for the wait.

31
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,125
Huh?

32
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,458
[screams]

33
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:52,875
Y-Y-Y-You guys! W-W-Why?!

34
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,958
--[JIM] Uhh...
--[GENE] Huh?

35
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,500
Uh. Hi, Aisha.

36
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,166
What are the hell
you doing here?!

37
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,583
How can you order this
kind of fancy food?!

38
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,458
And where did you get
that kinda money?

39
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,625
A customer's payin' for it.

40
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,625
We're just s'pposed
to wait here for him.

41
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:09,125
This guy happens to be
a real generous client.

42
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,875
He said we could have
anything we wanted

43
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,750
while we're just waitin'
around for him.

44
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:13,875
--[JIM] Mmm...
--[GENE] This is great!

45
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,083
Yeah, it's really rich,

46
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,750
but it doesn't have
that yucky aftertaste

47
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:19,583
you usually get with
this kind of food, huh?

48
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:20,666
Uh. Oh, yes. He's right.

49
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,125
[growling]

50
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,500
Huh?

51
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:27,208
If you want, you can have
some of my lobster.

52
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:28,416
Ahh...

53
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,583
Don't mind if I do!

54
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,208
--Thanks! Ugh!
--[OWNER] Hey, part-timer!

55
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:34,166
[OWNER] Stop screwin' around!
Get your butt back here!

56
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,500
[AISHA]
Ugh! Yes, sir.

57
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,416
[GENE]
Hm?

58
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,166
Looks like our client
finally showed up.

59
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,333
[JIM, MELFINA]
Huh?

60
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,875
[JIM]
So, what can we do for ya?

61
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,958
On the phone you said you
were looking for something,

62
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:02,166
so what might that be, hm?

63
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,833
I'm lookin' for a treasure.

64
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:04,708
Huh? Wha--?

65
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:07,291
Did he say what I think he said?

66
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:11,250
Actually, we don't have to look
far. I already know where it is.

67
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:14,166
The ship with the treasure
went down on a certain planet.

68
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,791
All I need for you to do
is bring it back up for me.

69
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,416
A salvage operation?

70
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,750
I'm sorry, but with
our equipment,

71
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,916
I'm afraid that'd be a
little difficult for us.

72
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,708
With a Grappler Ship,
it won't be a problem.

73
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:30,041
I've already had a chance to see
you're ship at the spaceport.

74
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,791
She's a perfect vessel.

75
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:34,291
Yeah, well, Gilliam would
sure be happy to hear that.

76
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,666
But what do you need
a Grappler Ship for?

77
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,041
The environment on that
planet is sort of special.

78
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,666
A Grappler Ship would
be best suited for it.

79
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,708
What do you mean by "special"?

80
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,458
I can't tell ya
anymore right now.

81
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:48,916
And what about the treasure?

82
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,666
[OLD MAN] Something worth
at least five million wong.

83
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,125
Five? Five million?

84
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:54,291
In what? Jewels?

85
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:57,500
Hey! I said that I can't
tell you anymore.

86
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:00,500
It depends now on the
answer you give me.

87
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,000
[JIM]
Hmm...

88
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,791
Uh... We'll be just one minute.

89
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,166
What should we do?

90
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,125
There's something
fishy about all of this.

91
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,625
You can tell that there's
something going on

92
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,625
just by looking
at that old geezer.

93
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,041
That's for sure.

94
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:15,500
A treasure hunt with that
old man running the show?

95
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,791
I normally wouldn't be
interested in this sort of thing

96
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,041
but...

97
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:21,208
Even if it's only half
of that, it's still 2.5.

98
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,750
We'd make a killing!

99
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,833
[GENE] But backing
that old man? I don't know.

100
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,458
[JIM] No kidding.
That's the tough part,

101
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:27,791
but the money's good.

102
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:30,791
[GENE] I'm not sure.
It still seems kinda fishy.

103
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,791
Yeah, but come on, Gene,
we're totally broke.

104
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,875
We don't have much of
a choice in the matter.

105
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,958
Necessity's the mother
of an invention.

106
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,125
So what do you say?
Should we go for all or nothin'?

107
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:43,750
I just hope we get
rich quick. You gotta deal.

108
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:44,708
[JIM clears throat]

109
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,375
Sorry that look so long.

110
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:47,791
After careful deliberation,

111
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,000
we've decided to
accept your job offer.

112
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,500
Starwind and Hawking
at your service, sir.

113
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:53,291
Uh, uh...

114
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,416
Just call me Old Man.

115
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,708
--[JIM] What?
--[GENE] Uhh...

116
00:06:56,791 --> 00:07:00,208
Being called "Sir" sounds
like empty flattery.

117
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:03,041
Call me "Gramps" or "Old Man,"
whichever you like.

118
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:05,250
[JIM]
Umm...

119
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:08,583
I'm not the least bit surprised
that you don't trust me.

120
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:11,833
I have to admit this
story is pretty fishy.

121
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,875
Uh, well... that is...

122
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,875
[OLD MAN laughing]

123
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:18,458
It's all right. Somebody
with a one-track mind

124
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:19,708
who would take
the job right away

125
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,541
would never be
able to handle it!

126
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,458
But I also wouldn't
team up with somebody

127
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:26,333
who doesn't have the guts
to go chasin' after a dream.

128
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,333
And you people pass.

129
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:29,416
[groans]

130
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,916
I'm honored then.

131
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,541
[chukles] I like that
look in your eye.

132
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,291
Huh?

133
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:36,958
[OLD MAN]
Those are the eyes of an Outlaw

134
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:40,333
who'd go anywhere
to chase his dreams.

135
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:41,541
Heh!

136
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:42,541

Huh?

138
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:44,833
[THUG A]
Die, Old Man!

139
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,916
[THUG B]
This is for our brother!

140
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:55,375
All right, come
outta there, Old Man!

141
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,000
Kinda looks as though the
only thing they're after

142
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,458
is that old man.

143
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,458
Here.

144
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:03,958
Hey, it doesn't matter to me.

145
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,791
Anyone who shoots in
my direction is an enemy.

146
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,291
Ahh, it's ridiculous.

147
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,791
No one wastes food
right in front of me

148
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,458
and gets away with it!

149
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:30,875
[screaming]

150
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:37,541
--[AISHA screaming]
--[THUGS groaning]

151
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,083
When Aisha gets like that,
she's totally outta control.

152
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:43,166
Well shootin' your gun off
didn't help, you know. Gah!

153
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,458
I wonder who those
people were anyway.

154
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,916
[OLD MAN] Some of the people
who are tryin' to kill me.

155
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,375
[JIM]
Huh?

156
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:50,458
When did you get here?!

157
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,166
I didn't have a
chance to tell you,

158
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,958
but there're people who're after
information about the treasure

159
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,083
that have been trailing
me for some time now.

160
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,416
[GENE, JIM, MELFINA, groan]

161
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,541
Well, then, I suppose
that makes my story real.

162
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:02,583
[JIM]
Hm?

163
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,541
[chuckling]

164
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,958
[growling]

165
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,541
What are you tryin' to do,
put me out of business?!

166
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:18,333
[AISHA]
Hm? Ah!

167
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:28,708
[OWNER crying]

168
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:41,250
You, the boy, and the little
lady, are you the whole crew?

169
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,583
Just the three of you?

170
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,958
Well sometimes we team up
with two of the others

171
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,375
when we need the
help, but yeah,

172
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,958
basically we are the crew.

173
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,208
But I can handle most
of the problems myself.

174
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,416
[OLD MAN sighs]

175
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,000
That's really too bad.

176
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:56,666
Physical strength's important
on the last leg of the trip.

177
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,083
[AISHA]
Okay, Gene Starwind.

178
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,166
You're gonna pay for the
damage to the restaurant,

179
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,916
do you understand?!

180
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,208
[GENE]
Uh...

181
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,791
Aisha, you're just in time!

182
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,000
If it's strength you want,

183
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,125
this animal here has got
the strength of ten!

184
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:13,083
[ASHIA]
Nya?

185
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,833
Who are you calling an animal?!

186
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,750
Establishing all
navigation data.

187
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,958
[MELFINA] Output of all
engines is stable.

188
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,333
We can launch.

189
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,666
Okay, so where are
we headed, Old Man?

190
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,416
Heifong VII, the Water Planet!

191
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,083
All right, let's go!

192
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:50,333
I've come back! I've come
back again! Finally!

193
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,333
Gramps, whaddya
mean when you say

194
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:53,666
you've come back again?

195
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,500
I didn't wanna say anything,

196
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:59,041
but I've had my fill of comin'
back here many times before

197
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,916
over the past 30 years.

198
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,750
What? Did you say 30 years?

199
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:04,791
What's this?

200
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,291
Our entry course to
the Water Planet

201
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,500
to supply you with the data.

202
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,500
All right! Yes, sir!

203
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,916
Way cool!

204
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,541
They don't call it the Water
Planet for nothing, do they?

205
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:25,208
It's more like we're in
water instead of gas.

206
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,625
[GILLIAM] The pressure of the
planet is compressing the gas

207
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:28,958
into a liquid.

208
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:31,375
It is like being in an
ocean of hydrogen.

209
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:34,375
Cut your engines now.
Go to silent running.

210
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:35,583
Why do you wanna do that?

211
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,250
[OLD MAN]
Do as I say.

212
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:41,416
Mel, go ahead. Set engine
systems to waiting mode.

213
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,916
[MELFINA]
Understood.

214
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,875
Now setting Ether Drive System
and Sub-ether Drive System

215
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,541
to waiting mode.

216
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:50,166
Now pitch us down
three more degrees.

217
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,500
Roger that!

218
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,833
Hey, look at the fish!

219
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:05,750
Wow! I can't believe there's
fish in a place like this.

220
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,791
They look tasty!

221
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:10,833
[screams]

222
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:19,083
Wh-What's that?
That thing is huge!

223
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,416
A demon.

224
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,875
A demon?

225
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:25,416
The same demon that dwells
in the Water Planet.

226
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,250
What do ya mean by demon?

227
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:37,208
And what else have you decided
not to tell us, Old Man?

228
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:40,208
No more secrets now.
Just tell us everything.

229
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,708
Okay, I'll tell you everything.

230
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:56,583
For starters, how 'bout the
explosives in this prosthetic?

231
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:59,083
Explosives?

232
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,291
[OLD MAN chuckles]

233
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,041
I'm used to being betrayed.

234
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:05,083
This arm is loaded with enough
to blow this ship sky-high

235
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,333
if need be.

236
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,416
Heh. Do you really think
that I'm stupid enough

237
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,208
to fall for a bluff like that?

238
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:13,083
Do you wanna find out?
See if I'm bluffing?

239
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,291
[JIM]
Uh... No.

240
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,458
All right, then.

241
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,333
About 30 years ago,
a ship run by pirates

242
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,541
had been brutally
attacked by an Outlaw family

243
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,375
where it crashed here
on the Water Planet

244
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:28,666
and was left behind.

245
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,583
Along with her cargo
of 15 tons of Dragonite.

246
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,750
Fifteen tons of Dragonite?

247
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,166
[GILLIAM] That equals the state
budget of the frontier world

248
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,958
for a total of five years.

249
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,250
Then the Outlaws came after it.

250
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,250
They chased right
after that pirate ship

251
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,583
as she sank into the gas ocean.

252
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:47,458
And when the pirate ship reached
the sea of metallic hydrogen,

253
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,958
invading the
unknown territory...

254
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,500
...that's when those
monsters appeared.

255
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,083
The monsters had floated up
from the bottom of the sea

256
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:57,500
and attacked the Outlaw ships.

257
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,583
Their claws ripped
through the armor plating

258
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:02,416
and their fangs crushed
through their hulls!

259
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,250
The monsters that slaughtered
12 of the family's ships

260
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:08,083
in an instant were a pack
of primitive life forms

261
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:11,000
that have made the
Water Planet their home.

262
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,708
Whoa! Wait a minute, Gramps!

263
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,125
That monster we saw
was part of a pack?

264
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,000
The area the pirate
ship went down in

265
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,375
was somewhere near their colony.

266
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,083
They have a strong
territorial instinct.

267
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:25,041
Anything that invades their
territory is attacked.

268
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,583
Without any mercy,

269
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,541
Outlaws, Pirates, Space Forces,
anyone seeking the treasure

270
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:32,000
has been shredded by
their relentless claws

271
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,208
and sent straight
to the bottom.

272
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,458
The Water Planet came
to be known as the place

273
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,500
where the evil demon lives.

274
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,416
Fear kept people
from coming back.

275
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,291
They no longer searched
for the treasure.

276
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:44,916
[GENE]
But that's not true for you.

277
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,916
After meeting the
demon 30 years ago,

278
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,083
you're the only one now

279
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:50,000
who's still chasing
after the treasure.

280
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,541
I find that kind of interesting.

281
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,625
Huh? What're ya talking about?

282
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,375
I'm taking a guess
that it was your family

283
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,166
that attacked the pirate ship.

284
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,416
Am I right?

285
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,625
Yeah?

286
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,750
I've lost many things
in my lifetime.

287
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,291
My eye, my leg,
of course, and my hand.

288
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,250
My family is irreplaceable.

289
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,416
They took them away from me!

290
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,625
For 30 years I've kept hunting!

291
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,375
The monster! The treasure!

292
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:18,208
And I won't stop
until I get them!

293
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,291
For revenge?

294
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,916
No! It's the only way
an Outlaw lives!

295
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,666
I have a dream to chase after.

296
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,291
I have an enemy to kill.

297
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,875
So I will keep
fighting as long I can.

298
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:31,083
I'll keep fighting as
long as I'm an Outlaw.

299
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,375
[beeping]

300
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,541
[MELFINA]
I see something ahead.

301
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,083
That's the vessel!

302
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,041
So your tellin' me
15 tons of Dragonite

303
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,416
are waiting inside
of that thing?

304
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,750
Uhh... Let's get
outta here, Gene!

305
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,500
This place is crawling
with monsters

306
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:49,083
that can crush a spaceship and
chew us up like tiny morsels.

307
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,291
[GENE]
You have a plan, right?

308
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,375
[OLD MAN]
Of course!

309
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,166
Tell me you're not gonna do it!

310
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,875
Do you really think
I'm gonna turn around

311
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,458
and run with 15 tons
of Dragonite out there?

312
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,291
We're gonna get the treasure
that's been sitting here

313
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,166
for 30 years and
take it with us.

314
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,708
Aw, come on, Gene!

315
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:03,958
[GENE]
Pull yourself together, Jim!

316
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,458
This is our big chance
to make a quick fortune.

317
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,791
I cannot believe this.
Okay, fine.

318
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,083
Okay, Old Man.

319
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,333
What do we do first?

320
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,208
Ready some decoys right away.

321
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,083
[sighs] Roger!

322
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,666
Decoy loading complete!

323
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,500
Fire 'em straight at
the pirate ship now!

324
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,333
[AISHA]
Nya?

325
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:27,083
They sound just like those
fish we saw earlier.

326
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:29,208
You mean to tell me
that you can hear that?

327
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,166
Of course I can!

328
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:35,125
Evade!

329
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,250
Got it!

330
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,791
Go ahea! Cut the wires!
Set engines to maximum!

331
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,208
Aye-aye, sir!

332
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,250
All right, it worked!

333
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,416
Hey, this is a lot
easier than I thought!

334
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,833
Don't get cocky.

335
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,041
We only have ten minutes

336
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,375
before they come back
to their territory.

337
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,750
That should give us just
enough time to board the ship

338
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,833
so we can load up the treasure.

339
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,833
[OLD MAN]
It's in cargo hold three.

340
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,541
Right, I gotcha!

341
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,916
Careful, Old Man.

342
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,375
I wouldn't want ya to have
a heart attack or anything.

343
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,416
You could be rest assured
I'm not gonna die

344
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,041
till I get my hands
on that treasure!

345
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:41,625
[OLD MAN]
Damn! It won't open!

346
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:42,833
[GENE]
Stand back!

347
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:55,041
Okay, then! It's time
for Aisha to get to work!

348
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,625
And that's the way
we take care of that!

349
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,333
[AISHA]
Hey! What's the big--? Uh!

350
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,958
Hey, you guys, I-- Ah!

351
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,500
[AISHA]
Nya! This is all Dragonite!

352
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:28,041
It's been so long.
The day has finally arrived.

353
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,875
[crying]

354
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,208
Sorry, Old Man, but we
don't have time for this.

355
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,666
You can be overcome with emotion

356
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,416
after we've loaded
up the treasure.

357
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,166
Oh yeah, right.

358
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,083
[MELFINA]
Will they make it?

359
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,500
All we can do now is hope

360
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,750
that what the Old Man
told us is true.

361
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,666
Gene, you only have
three minutes left!

362
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,500
I gotcha, Jim.
This is the last of it.

363
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,083
What the hell just happened?!

364
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,708
[JIM] It's the monsters! They're
back! They're everywhere!

365
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:55,791
What?!

366
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,833
This isn't what you told us!

367
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:06,750
I'm sorry, it looks like
I miscalculated.

368
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,208
You miscalculated?!

369
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:09,791
[JIM]
What should we do, Gene?

370
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,375
Hang on, Jim, till we get back!

371
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:15,208
[GILLIAM]
Ugh! My hull is being damaged!

372
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,666
What're you doing, Jim?

373
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,458
Fight back with the Grappler
Arms before it's too late!

374
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:20,791
Calm down, okay?

375
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,375
We can't use the Grappler Arms

376
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:25,125
until we've rescued Gene
and all of the others.

377
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,833
All right, Jim! We've got
the treasure all loaded!

378
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,291
You can pull us in now!

379
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,708
Okay!

380
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,333
Disengage waiting mode!
Get us outta here, full thrust!

381
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,250
[MELFINA]
Roger!

382
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:49,333
Output of all
engines is stable.

383
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:50,750
What the hell was that?!

384
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:53,541
[GILLIAM] Apparently the left
arm is weighted down.

385
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:54,875
What's that?!

386
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,750
You think you can take us?

387
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:09,291
Damn! That thing is powerful!

388
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:17,958
Yeah, and he's huge!

389
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,458
[OLD MAN]
It's the master!

390
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:20,625
Yeah, that's the one.

391
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,750
The demon among demons
that took my life

392
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,958
and shattered it
to hell and back!

393
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:27,291
The demon king
of the Water Planet.

394
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,625
Demon King of the Water Planet?

395
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,625
[GENE] Mel! Fire up the
engines immediately!

396
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:32,708
[gasps]

397
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,250
Take it to full power
and break free.

398
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:43,708
It's not working! It's using
the pirate ship as leverage.

399
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,958
It's clamped down too tight!

400
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,541
The arms are not gonna hold!

401
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,500
Shit! If this keeps up,
we're dead. Gah, come on!

402
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:01,625
[gasps]

403
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,083
[MELFINA]
The cargo hatch is opening.

404
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,250
[GENE]
Say what?!

405
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,625
Old Man, what the hell do
you think you're doing now?

406
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:14,833
[OLD MAN] Heh. Settle things
with that villainous bastard.

407
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:17,041
[GENE]
Settle things?! Don't be stupid!

408
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:18,625
What do you think you
can possibly accomplish

409
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,041
in that mini-sub?

410
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,583
Thanks to you people, I was
able to fulfill my dream

411
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,000
in more ways than one.

412
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,750
I spent all my years as an
Outlaw chasin' after this.

413
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,333
A beautiful dream that
has now come to life!

414
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:30,625
[GENE]
Old Man...

415
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,416
[OLD MAN]
All that's left now is him.

416
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,666
He's right in front of me,

417
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,916
and the Outlaw honor
says I have to kill it!

418
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
[GENE]
Old Man! Don't!

419
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:45,041
There's still time!
Don't do it! Just let go!

420
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,416
Stop!

421
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,208
Don't do it!

422
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:48,416
[gasps]

423
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,958
[OLD MAN] You must search for
your own dream, young Outlaw!

424
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:57,291
And then fight for it!
Fight to make it all yours!

425
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:59,583
Come on! Please, don't do it!

426
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:15,833
Old Man!

427
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,250
[AISHA]
We did it! We did it!

428
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:23,791
We have a mountain of treasure!

429
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:26,083
--[beep]
--[JIM groans]

430
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:27,416
Well? Well?

431
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,833
So how much did we make
and what's my cut?

432
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:30,916
[JIM]
Zero!

433
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,250
[AISHA]
Huh?!

434
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:34,375
What do you mean zero?
With all that Dragonite?!

435
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:35,375
You gotta be crazy!

436
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:36,833
You tryin' to pull
one over on me?!

437
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:39,791
It may look like a lot,
but it's low density.

438
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:43,416
On the black market, it only
comes to 1.8 million wong.

439
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,958
Take a look for yourself.

440
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:47,500
Here's the fuel bill, the cost
of fixing the Grappler Arms,

441
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:49,833
the cost of replacing
the armor plating.

442
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:52,208
And all this is the
maintenance of the ship.

443
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:54,833
Parking fees and rent for
the office keep piling up.

444
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:56,958
There's utilities,
phone, advertising,

445
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:59,916
plus the incidentals,
and we're left with this!

446
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:05,083
[wailing]

447
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:06,875
Is it true?

448
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:14,333
Why is this happening to me?!

449
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:07,000
[GENE] The secret of the Outlaw
is finally revealed!

450
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:10,375
And MacDougall tries to get
Melfina into his slimy clutches!

451
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:11,625
Yeah!

452
00:25:11,708 --> 00:25:12,750
This feels like we're
moving in on the climax

453
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:14,833
of a great space drama,
doesn't it?

454
00:25:14,916 --> 00:25:16,125
Not exactly.

455
00:25:16,208 --> 00:25:17,500
But what's real exciting

456
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:20,041
is next week, I'm gonna
have to pilot a giant robot!

457
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:22,125
Huh? I'm not?

458
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:24,666
Well let's hope the
robot isn't piloting me!

459
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,625
Next time on <i>Outlaw Star</i> :

460
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:28,458
"Between Life and Machine"!

461
00:25:28,541 --> 00:25:29,958
You better get ready!
