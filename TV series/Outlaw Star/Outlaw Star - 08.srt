1
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:19,708
[NARRATOR]
Gene Starwind.

2
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:21,375
What are you looking for?

3
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:23,958
Where will your heart's
desire take you?

4
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:26,208
What will satisfy you?

5
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:27,833
Gene Starwind.

6
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:30,958
Are you going to live
or will you die here?

7
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:32,666
The decision is yours.

8
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,375
You're completely in charge
of your own destiny.

9
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:38,500
That's the only certain
thing in life.

10
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:43,250
So, believe in yourself and
create your own destiny!

11
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:45,375
Don't fear failure.

12
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:47,208
You have nothing to lose.

13
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:49,708
The young only acquire things.

14
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:53,291
You've come into possession of
the <i>Outlaw Star</i> and Melfina.

15
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:57,291
The only question now is,
how will you use them?

16
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,291
Go to the Galactic Leyline!

17
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:01,041
No one can stop you.

18
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:03,500
Adventure is waiting for you!

19
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:05,750
You should understand
this by now.

20
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,708
Time is running out.

21
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:11,833
Open your eyes, shout out,
and continue forward!

22
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:15,416
This is only the
beginning of history.

23
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:56,416
[beeping]

24
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,708
[JIM]
Gene!

25
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:04,000
[SUZUKA]
The needles went right through.

26
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,583
And, he's infected.

27
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:08,250
It seems that the injections he
was given were full of poison.

28
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,458
Poison?

29
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,541
Yes, we must find the
antidote right away.

30
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,791
What are we gonna do right now?

31
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,750
[SUZUKA] The enemy might
be using this situation

32
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,458
to force us to negotiate.

33
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:18,625
[beeping]

34
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,333
[GILLIAM]
Please pardon the interruption.

35
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,750
A transmission is coming
through from outside.

36
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,208
Put it through!

37
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:25,541
Hello there!

38
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,541
I'm checking in on how
Captain Starwind is doing.

39
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,000
If his blood isn't cleansed,

40
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,750
he is not going to
last until nightfall.

41
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,750
If, and only if,
you leave this ship

42
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:42,041
will I then give
you the antidote.

43
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,625
Well, do you have one?

44
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,750
Forget it Jim.

45
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:51,500
Jim...

46
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:52,708
Easy, Gene.

47
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,250
Do you really think that
they're gonna let us

48
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,791
walk away from this?

49
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,666
[groaning]

50
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,833
[YASA laughs]

51
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:03,958
Well he still seems in high
spirits, what will you do now?

52
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,541
Stop Gilliam!
Stop transmission!

53
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:13,583
[YASE chuckles]
How amusing.

54
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:18,208
Ahh... It's me. Things are going
to get a little noisy soon.

55
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:22,333
Just look the other way, and
you'll be greatly rewarded.

56
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:23,375
[grunts]

57
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:26,708
[YASE]
Let's go!

58
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:29,416
Come on, Gene! Help us!

59
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,583
[SUZUKA]
I agree with Gene

60
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,458
as far as the
pirates are concerd.

61
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:35,458
But if something isn't
done soon, I...

62
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:38,750
I'm not sure if they actually
do have an antidote for Gene.

63
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,000
Our only option is to
find out and steal it.

64
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,750
Okay, then I'm goin' with you.

65
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,375
[MELFINA]
Wait a second!

66
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:49,291
I think... I think that
I might be able to do it.

67
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,458
Might be able to do what?

68
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,750
[JIM]
We're counting on you, Melfina.

69
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,458
[MELFINA]
Right.

70
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:04,583
[GILLIAM] Warning!
The enemy is closing in.

71
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:12,250
[YASE laughing]

72
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:16,166
Gilliam, bring up all
systems, let's go!

73
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,708
[GILLIAM]
Without Melfina's help,

74
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,583
we have a limited number
of systems to access.

75
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:24,416
Got it, put this creep on
the monitor so I can see'em.

76
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,333
Give me a close up.

77
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:29,416
Hello, we're here to sell you
the antidote my little friend.

78
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,666
Well, we're not handing
the ship over to you.

79
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,458
So just back away, buddy!

80
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,333
Well, well, my dear friend.

81
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:39,000
Are we going to give up on
Captain Gene's life then?

82
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,916
I'll bet at this moment
he's in a lot of pain.

83
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,791
Ah! Ha, ha!

84
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:46,250
I'm so sorry Gene.

85
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:57,875
Hey Dad, I learned all
the controls already.

86
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,875
[BOTH grunting]

87
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:18,208
Dad, wait!

88
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:19,916
Sorry Gene, but I
want you to live!

89
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,416
No Dad, don't do it!

90
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,291
[GENE'S DAD grunts]

91
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,208
Good luck, my son.

92
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:34,916
[GENE]
Dad! No!

93
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:43,458
[GENE]
I'm... I'm... alone.

94
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:46,583
[MELFINA]
Gene... Gene...

95
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:47,166
Gene...

96
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,541
[gasps]

97
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,041
[MELFINA]
Gene.

98
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:57,166
[MELFINA]
You're not alone, I'm here now.

99
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,750
[GENE]
Melfina!

100
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:04,708
[MELFINA]
Gene, I'm here to heal you.

101
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,041
Open your heart.

102
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,875
[groaning]

103
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,125
[MELFINA]
Gene.

104
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,250
Gene.

105
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:34,583
Gene. Gene.

106
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,916
Gene.

107
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,041
It's all right. I understand.

108
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,833
Everything's fine now.

109
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:46,375
It looks like I can
be of help to you.

110
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:51,208
No more worries.
I can save you, Gene.

111
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,583
[GENE]
Mmm.

112
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,916
[GILLIAM] Attention! Strange
weapons are approaching.

113
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,625
What are those?

114
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,000
Just hold them here for now.

115
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,958
Well, I guess I won't mind if
you damage it just a little.

116
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,500
They're the pirates'
mechanical soldiers.

117
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:24,958
Damn it.

118
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,083
They're way too close for
missiles and beams won't work.

119
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:34,916
[GILLIAM] Jim, I have a
call from Mr. Luo in Hugo.

120
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,083
[JIM]
Now?! Put him through.

121
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,333
Hi there, Jim.

122
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,458
Well, aren't you just
looking as cute as ever.

123
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,875
What do you want, Fred?
We're sort of busy right now.

124
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:43,875
Where's Gene?

125
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,250
[JIM]
He's not available, Fred.

126
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,083
All right now, this
is very important,

127
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,750
listen closely to
what I have to say,

128
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,791
several Kei Pirate ships
are heading this way

129
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,291
to Sentinel III,
and I believe

130
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:55,125
they're going to reach West
Virginia Spaceport soon.

131
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:58,166
What?! But we're in
Ban territory, Fred.

132
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,750
That's my point.

133
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,958
The fact of word spread all the
way out here to the frontier,

134
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,125
shows that these pirates mean
to start a big commotion.

135
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,958
Why would they wanna do that?

136
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:11,458
Well... Oh, well, acting as
an intermediary is my job.

137
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:14,083
Saying no to them
is bad for buisness!

138
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:15,916
And I didn't want to ruin
our relationship...

139
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,750
So I called you--

140
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,166
[JIM]
Enough!

141
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:23,750
All right, all right!
Thanks for nothin'! [screams]

00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:37,000
[JIM]
Oh! What should I do?!

144
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,750
[SUZUKA, JIM gasp]

145
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,083
[GENE]
Hmph. Sorry for the wait.

146
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,166
All right!

147
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,750
Jim, give me the pilot's seat.

148
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,083
You shouldn't, your wounds
haven't sealed up.

149
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,958
You removed all the poison.

150
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,958
The rest are up to endurance.

151
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:59,708
Melfina. Thank you. You're
the one who saved my life.

152
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,458
Yeah, I...

153
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,083
[explosion]

154
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,250
[GILLIAM]
The enemies' weapons

155
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,875
are attempting to
force open the hatch.

156
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:14,666
And now, I'm going
to take back the XGP.

157
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,458
[GILLIAM]
Attention everyone,

158
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:22,250
this ship is presently in
danger due to enemy attack.

159
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,041
I know, I know, I know.

160
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,208
As soon as Melfina's ready,

161
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,416
we're blastin' out of here.

162
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,500
[MELFINA]
All systems green.

163
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,333
I'm ready to go.

164
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,000
Asshole!

165
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,833
Well, those are interesting
grappler arms.

166
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:14,208
They can't even reach the
target, how completely useless.

167
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,625
[SUZUKA]
You coward.

168
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,291
I hope you can hear me, Gene.

169
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,833
Because this one is
going to be all mine.

170
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:31,625
Interesting. What does she
think she can do to me?

171
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,708
What?!

172
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,375
[GENE]
What a show-off!

173
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,625
[grunting]

174
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,041
[SUZUKA]
It's over.

175
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:06,333
Oh, spare me, please!
I'll do anything!

176
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,958
You are a coward, aren't you?

177
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:25,083
Hey, not bad, Suzuka.

178
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,583
When it's a Kei Pirate,
it's really nothing.

179
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,083
Well, that's good to know.

180
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,375
Anyhow, it's just about
time to blast off.

181
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,541
I guess i should ask

182
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,208
the Ctarl-Ctarl for
help at this point--

183
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,666
you better climb
aboard, Suzuka.

184
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,250
[DOCK SUPERVISOR] This is
the control tower! Dock 26.

185
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,625
<i>Outlaw Star</i> . What's
going on over there?

186
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,166
[GENE]
Nothing too serious.

187
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,958
We're getting ready to blast off
now, so we'd like to receive

188
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:47,166
the current weather reports
and flight conditions.

189
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:50,166
That's negative! I will not
give you launch clearance.

190
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,125
We've verified that there
has been a disturbance

191
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,791
on the launch pad!

192
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,958
The <i>Outlaw Star</i> will be checked
out by Port authorities.

193
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,333
Hold your present position.

194
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:58,458
[GENE]
Like hell!

195
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,875
Release all systems
from standby mode!

196
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,375
Begin transfer to
navigation mode now!

197
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:04,583
[GILLIAM]
What are you planning to do?

198
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,541
Blast outta here without
any kind of guidance

199
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,583
from the control tower.

200
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,583
The container's
ready and loaded.

201
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:37,541
[MELFINA]
CFS activated.

202
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:42,666
Newton reactor coming online.
Systems show normal.

203
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,833
All verniers show normal.

204
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,875
[GILLIAM]
My crew is a bunch of lunatics.

205
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,583
This is rather reckless, Gene!

206
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,041
I've got their weather reports

207
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,041
and I'm sending it to over
to your screen right now.

208
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:55,958
[MELFINA] Ether drive
system... operational.

Engine system operation...
now verified.

211
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:02,791
[GILLIAM]
We're receiving a broadcast

212
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,208
from the control tower.

213
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,875
[DOCK SUPERVISOR] Gene Starwind
come out of that ship

214
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,291
immediately! The police will
place you under arrest.

215
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,166
Do you realize the
kind of trouble

216
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,041
you're getting yourself into?

217
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:16,875
What are we gonna
do now, Gene? Hm?

218
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,208
Well, Jim,

219
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:22,000
I guess we're never coming
back to Sentinel again.

220
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,333
Let's blow 'em off
and get outta here.

221
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,125
Is that all right
with you Suzuka?

222
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,166
I'll be joining you.

223
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,583
[GENE] If you don't move,
you're gonna get burned!

224
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:42,083
[GENE]
Let's go Jim!

225
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,625
[JIM]
You got it!

226
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:44,625
[GENE]
Ready Melfina?

227
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,416
[MELFINA]
Ready.

228
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,791
Gravity cycle unit operational.
System shows green.

229
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,291
[DOCK SUPERVISOR]
Gene Starwind!

230
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:58,333
Stop! Don't do it!

231
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,000
[GENE]
Bite me!

232
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:04,625
[GILLIAM] I see you're really
going through with this.

233
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,916
The ship is airtight
and ready for take-off.

234
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,583
[JIM] Everything's all set
here and we're ready to go!

235
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:12,416

00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,250
Commencing countdown.

240
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,750
T-minus-30 to launch.

241
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,375
[MELFINA]
T-minus-20.

242
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,458
[GENE]
So here it is.

243
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:41,125
My journey's finally beginning.

244
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:47,500
[GENE]
Goodbye Hilda.

245
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:51,125
[MELFINA]
T-minus-10... 8... 7...

246
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:57,291
6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1...

247
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:57,958
...0...

248
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,000
Let's go!

249
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,416
Ship-roll is now complete.

250
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,458
[BOY]
Aw, Dad. You know what?

251
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,916
When I grow up, I'm gonna
be a spaceship pilot.

252
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,750
[FATHER] Really? Well if you
work hard, maybe you will be.

253
00:16:56,833 --> 00:17:02,291
[BOY] Wow! I can't wait!
Yeah, I'm gonna do it!

254
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,333
[MELFINA]
We've exited the atmosphere.

255
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,625
Please put us in orbit now.

256
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:20,958
[GILLIAM] We have successfully
completed planetary launch.

257
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,125
Yeah, we did it!

258
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:26,875
[exhales]

259
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,750
Well, of course we
did it! I'm awesome

260
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:33,666
at absolutely everything I
set out to do with my life!

261
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,791
[laughs]

262
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:39,166
Yeah right, whatever.

263
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,958
[MELFINA giggles]

264
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,416
What interesting
people you all are.

265
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,833
[GILLIAM]
Congratulations, Gene!

266
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:47,750
So sorry to interrupt your
festivities, however...

267
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,208
Okay, now what?

268
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:50,416
[GILLIAM]
I'm afraid pirate ships

269
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,208
are closing in on our position.

270
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,125
Pirates, where?

271
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,500
[MELFINA]
Distance, 20,000.

272
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,375
They seemed to have spotted us.

273
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,875
Gakkie! Onok! Let's plan
to attack in two minutes.

274
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,833
Can you see any sign of 'em?

275
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:19,125
Well the guys on the ground
really screwed up, huh?

276
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:24,666
Aw, who cares? That's fine
with me. Let's have some fun.

277
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,375
[MELFINA] They aren't
responding to our signals.

278
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:28,666
[GILLIAM]
It's a jammer.

279
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,541
It looks like those are
Grappler pirate ships.

280
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,333
Now what do we do?

281
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:34,916
Time for grappler combat.

282
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,375
Now, Gilliam, tell me, just
how do I arm these things?

283
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:38,791
[GILLIAM]
Once you release the safeties,

284
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,666
they should be able
to arm themselves.

285
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,125
Are you sure about this?
You've never done it before.

286
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,666
Hey, don't worry.

287
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,041
When it comes to manipulators,
I'm as good as it gets, Jim.

288
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,291
So anyway, look. I'm really
gonna need your help here

289
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:50,875
so we can pull this one off.

290
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,458
Huh, partner?

291
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:01,125
[MELFINA] Now switching over
to Grappler combat mode.

292
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,666
[MELFINA] Combat will
begin in 30 seconds.

293
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,458
Ah... Scatter all the
camera pods, now, Jim!

294
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,000
You got it!

295
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,250
[JIM]
Here goes!

296
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:18,250
[GILLIAM] The enemy ships
are Grappler Ships

297
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,791
and they're spreading
out cameras as well.

298
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,875
[GILLIAM] The enemy has
fired multiple missiles!

299
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,625
[JIM]
Lauching anti-missiles, now!

300
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,458
Let's do it!

301
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,708
You're tough. You're also dead!

302
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,375
[ONOK]
Ahh!

303
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,750
Damn, I'm hit hard!

304
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,041
[YAKUTA]
You okay, Onok?

305
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,791
[ONOK]
Yeah, I'll get him!

306
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:59,208
You think you're as good
as me with a gun?!

307
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:00,500
Uh! It's not firing!

308
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:01,750
They gun's empty!

309
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,916
We gotta swap it with a
spare, but I can do it.

310
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,291
Okay, you do that, but for now
we're gonna go hand-to-hand.

311
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,041
[ONOK]
Let's do it, Gakkie!

312
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:19,041
Yeah, drinks on me
when we get back!

313
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,416
[ONOK yells]

314
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,291
[ONOK]
Damn you!

315
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:40,750
[ONOK, GAKKIE scream]

316
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:46,333
Way to go!

317
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:47,833
[GENE]
But there's still one more left!

318
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,958
[GILLIAM]
Abnormality in engine two.

319
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,250
[MELFINA] Output has
dropped 30 degrees.

320
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:55,791
All right, I'm gonna
finish this guy off fast!

321
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,958
You just killed Onok and Gakkie.

322
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,125
Now, you're dead meat!

323
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:20,416
[yells]

324
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,916
Ahh!

325
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:49,041
I gotta admit. He's pretty good.

326
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,083
[JIM]
You did it, Gene!

327
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,875
[GILLIAM]
Combat mode ended.

328
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:04,000
Oh, man. That was
a good workout.

329
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,625
I think it's about time now
for me to hit the baths.

330
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,208
[sighs]

331
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:11,416
[MELFINA]
Gene... Well done.

332
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,458
Hey, thanks a lot, Melfina!

333
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,708
[MELFINA] It was nothing.
You did everything.

334
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:21,375
[GILLIAM] I'd just like to say,
that was a job well done.

335
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:23,458
You've managed to
keep the ship intact,

336
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:27,500
and we have now exited the
gravity zone of Sentinel III.

337
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:31,625
Shall I prepare to go
to sub-ether drive?

338
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:34,208
Yeah, okay, let's go
to Heifong now.

339
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:35,333
Why there?

340
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:37,416
Heifong is the Ban
Pirates' territory,

341
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,958
so imagine that
those Kei Pirates

342
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:40,916
won't come looking
for us there, right?

343
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,125
[slurping]

344
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:44,791
That's not for certain,
only time will tell.

345
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:46,500
Heifong's got a lot goin' on,

346
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:48,875
so maybe we'll be able
to find a good job there.

347
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:50,416
A job?

348
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,333
Yeah, how else can we pay for
this thing's maintenance,

349
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,916
ammo, and repairs?

350
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,250
I don't know.

351
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,583
Boy did we inherit a major
pain in the ass or what?

352
00:22:57,666 --> 00:22:59,000
[GILLIAM]
I beg your pardon,

353
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:01,791
I am not "a major pain in
the ass". I am Gilliam II.

354
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:05,750
And the name of the ship
is the <i>Outlaw Star</i> .

355
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:09,000
[MELFINA] Do you mind if I
set the course for Heifong?

356
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:11,291
No, go ahead.

357
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:13,875
It's about 20 light years.

358
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:18,208
[GENE]
Goodbye, Sentinel III.

359
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,458
[GENE] Surviving the
biggest crisis of your life

360
00:24:56,541 --> 00:24:58,458
is all well and good,
but just remember

361
00:24:58,541 --> 00:25:01,041
that you'll have nothing
to do after it's over.

362
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:04,541
Is this that big let down thing
I've heard so much about?

363
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:06,083
Well, all I know is,

364
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:09,000
at a time like this, raising
some hell and doing your job,

365
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:10,375
is the best medicine.

366
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:12,041
Isn't it right, Jim?

367
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:13,958
What are you so mad about?

368
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:16,291
Next time, on <i>Outlaw Star</i> :

369
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:18,750
"A Journey of Adventure"! Huh?

370
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:21,166
So you better get ready!
