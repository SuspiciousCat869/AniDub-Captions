[VOICE]
Why dost thou return?

16
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:28,500
Why dost thou return?

17
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,541
Why dost thou return?

00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,750
[VOICE]
There is but one path.

19
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:47,083
There is but one path.

20
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,250
Jim, do you read me? Jim?

21
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,291
[JIM]
Gene! Are you okay down there?

22
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:55,541
Yeah.

23
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,041
[JIM] What the heck's
going on around here?

24
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,833
What does it mean
"There is but one path"?

25
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:02,166
I don't know, but it looks
like we'll have to play along

26
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,250
if we're gonna free Melfina.

27
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:12,333
[HAZANKO] I'm getting tired
of playing these silly games.

28
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,875
Are you here, Jukai?

29
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,958
[JUKAI]
Of course, Lord Hazanko.

30
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,500
It seems that all the others
were sent elsewhere.

31
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,250
Who knows when they'll be back.

32
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,625
[HAZANKO]
No matter.

33
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,875
As long as I reach the gate
before anyone else does

34
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,583
and the key is
in my possession,

35
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,583
the other's whereabouts
are irrelevant.

36
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,708
[JUKAI]
Very well, my lord.

37
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:39,041
Paggawasanfa. Paggawasanfa.
Paggawasanfa.

38
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:42,208
Hey, Ron, do you
read me? Come in.

39
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:43,583
[RON]
Yeah, I read you.

40
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,208
Looks like our only
option right now

41
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,250
is to follow the path you're on.

42
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,333
Understood. I'll go ahead.

43
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,458
[RON]
Be careful.

44
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,250
Melfina, I'm on my way.

45
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:03,833
[GENE]
Suzuka!

46
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,166
It seems as if all the paths
merge as they go along.

47
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,958
Let's see where they lead.

48
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,541
My, this is fascinating.
Mm. Quite fascinating.

49
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,833
Perhaps it was a mistake to
give the MacDougall Brothers

50
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,416
the coordinates for this place.

51
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,958
Or maybe it a good
idea in the long run.

52
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:23,416
Regardless, as long
as I get what I want.

53
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,916
It's waiting for me
at the end of this path.

54
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,583
Simply wonderful.

55
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,000
Well, must hurry. Must hurry.

56
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,041
[AISHA] Is there really gonna be
treasure at the end of this

57
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,125
or were they just kidding?

58
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,916
[JIM]
How should I know?

59
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:39,583
[GENE] Suzuka, why did you
come with us on this mission?

60
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,541
[SUZUKA] Why is it that
men always want to know

61
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,125
the "why" of everything?

62
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:46,833
It's not as if knowing why will
let you do anything about it.

63
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:50,125
Before you ask me, you should
sort out your own feelings.

64
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:51,875
Don't you agree, Gene?

65
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,041
Huh?

66
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,291
[GENE] Where there're mountains,
there're valleys, huh?

67
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,166
[SUZUKA]
Why don't you go first.

68
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,208
You really know how to give a
man a lot of respect, Suzuka.

69
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:09,875
I was just thinking
the ledge over there

70
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,041
may be a little unstable,
that's all.

71
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,916
So like all of a sudden
I'm the lab rat here, huh?

72
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,083
Here goes!

73
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,125
The experiment was a success!

74
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:27,333
What next? There's never a dull
moment with you is there?

75
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,541
[GENE]
Remind me to thank you later!

76
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:32,708
Oh, there's no need
to thank me. Hm?

77
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,333
[HITORIGA]
It's been a long time. Suzuka.

78
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:39,833
You're looking
quite well, Hitoriga.

79
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:42,208
I'm surprised running
into you like this.

80
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,333
What's going on, Suzuka?

81
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,208
You've been wanting
to know for long time

82
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,041
why I came along with you, Gene.

83
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,000
Well, this is why.

84
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,291
As I've told you before,

85
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:54,208
I find your people's
culture most interesting.

86
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,958
But it was mainly because I have
a long-standing score to settle

87
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,958
with the Kei Pirates,
especially with Hitoriga.

88
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,000
So I joined you on this mission.

89
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,750
You seem to be bound so
closely together with them,

90
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:07,750
so I decided to use you.

91
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,375
You must go now, Gene.

92
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,500
This is a battle for
me to fight alone.

93
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,083
Do you understand?
Go on without me!

94
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,458
Melfina's out there
waiting for you!

95
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,416
[HITORIGA]
Will wonders never cease?

96
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,125
I'm surprised that you would
even consider a partner.

97
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:29,250
So, Suzuka, are you
in love with him?

98
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:32,166
I'll give you the answer
to that when the time comes.

99
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,541
I'll tell you when I kill you.

100
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:37,541
As a gift to see you
off to the afterlife.

101
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,958
[HITORIGA] Just because I
killed off your entire family

102
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,000
is no reason to hate me so.

103
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,375
We both work
as killers, you and I.

104
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,083
We understand each other.

105
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,083
[SUZUKA]
Who are you kidding?

106
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,333
You're just a pawn
for the pirates.

107
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:51,583
And I'm a fool for no one!

108
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:54,166
[HITORIGA] We seem to have a
difference of opinion, my dear.

109
00:07:54,250 --> 00:08:00,875
Paguwasanfa. Paguwasanfa.
Paguwasanfa.

110
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:11,416
[HITORIGA] This fight should
prove to be amusing, Suzuka.

111
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,666
Let us find out.

112
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,166
[chuckles]

113
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,708
At the very least, my dear,
we'll discover whom this

114
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,791
beautiful face
really belongs to.

115
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,583
Well, at least we
agree on that much.

116
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,500
[GENE]
This is the Galactic Leyline?

117
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,416
What the hell am I doing here?

118
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,541
[GENE]
I feel so helpless.

119
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,208
What should I do?

120
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,166
[HAMUSHI]
We meet at last.

121
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:49,375
You're Gene Starwind, hm?

122
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,416
My, how handsome.

123
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,541
I could show you a good
time if you'd be interested.

124
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:58,250
[GENE] I've never turned down
an offer from a woman before.

125
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,250
But there's always a first time.

126
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,666
Nothing personal,

127
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,875
but pirates and I never
seem to hit it off very well.

128
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:06,416
And besides, I'm not exactly
in the mood right now!

129
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,833
Pagguwasanba. Pagguwasanba.
Pagguwasanba.

130
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,583
Fei ga!

131
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:20,708
Is that a Caster?

132
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,958
That isn't going to
work against me, Gene.

133
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,916
Huh? Well, getta load of you!

134
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,625
A tough little cookie and a
righteous babe all in one.

135
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:32,166
Damn, this sucks.
That was just an 11.

136
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,833
How about a 10?!

137
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,125
[JUKAI]
Stop!

138
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,666
Anyone who dares interfere
with Lord Hazanko

139
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,583
will pay the consequences!

140
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,666
[AISHA]
Well now, what do we have here?

141
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,166
If it isn't a
certified pirate flunky.

142
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,583
Jim, just leave this to me.
You go on ahead. I'll catch up.

143
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:50,250
Why? I wanna stay here
and fight him with you.

144
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:53,208
Yeah, well thanks for the
concern, but I can handle him.

145
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:53,916
[JIM]
Aisha!

146
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,833
Will you get going?

147
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:03,500
Okay, now I can fight this idiot
without worrying about Jim.

148
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:04,916
[JUKAI]
Very wise, Aisha.

149
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,166
You sensed my power

150
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,750
and let the child escape
before I humiliated you.

151
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,708
How kind of you.

152
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:11,875
[laughing]

153
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,416
Stop tryin' to second guess me.

154
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,958
You're gonna pay for that.

155
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,041
I am your worst nightmare.

156
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,083
How in the world
did I wind up here?

157
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,583
I thought I was supposed
to be on a treasure hunt.

158
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,125
Well, never mind!

159
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,458
Always attack the
problem that life places

160
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,041
right in front of your face!

161
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,750
[JUKAI]
Precisely!

162
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,833
That won't work on me, no matter
how many times you try it.

163
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,416
How many shells do
you have left now?

164
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,958
Well if you really wanna know,

165
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,333
I have four shells left.

166
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,750
Four shells away from death.

167
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:54,750
When your shells run out,
you die, Gene Starwind.

168
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:55,916
[chuckles]

169
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Thanks for the warning,
but you're wrong.

170
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,541
Drain your life, huh?
Well here goes.

171
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,291
Eat this!

172
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:06,916
Well, what do we have here?

173
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,625
[chuckling]

174
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:13,458
[screaming]

175
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,708
[screaming]

176
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,250
Those damn things
drain your life.

177
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,291
Yeah, they got that right.

178
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,375
[HARRY]
What's going on?

179
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,166
[gasps]

180
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,750
Melfina!

181
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,916
Hold on.

182
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,500
You don't have to worry
anymore. I'll save you.

183
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,958
I came here for you, Melfina.

184
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,708
Oh, no. I'm so sorry, Harry,

185
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:02,250
but I can't be what
you want me to be.

186
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,791
But that's not true.

187
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,166
You don't have to do anything.

188
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,791
Just to having you near
is enough for me.

189
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,083
Don't you understand?

190
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,125
I love you.

191
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,875
[gasps]

192
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,083
[HAZANKO]
So there you are!

193
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:22,125
[HAZANKO] At last we meet,
my prize Melfina.

194
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,333
Come, open the gate.

195
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,916
You better watch what
you're sayin', mister!

196
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,500
I'm the only man in Melfina's
life so you better back off!

197
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,458
[HAZANKO]
Don't be absurd!

198
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,708
[chuckles]

199
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,875
[HARRY screams]

200
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:51,500
[HAZANKO]
You'll pay for that, you worm.

201
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,583
Ah! Harry!

202
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,708
That's the first time...

203
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:07,416
...that you ever talked
to me like that, Melfina.

204
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,250
Harry!

205
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,166
[MELFINA]
What have you done?

206
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,666
[HAZANKO]
You needn't concern yourself.

207
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:30,250
Just fulfill the task that
has been given to you.

208
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,625
The task? What do you mean?

209
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:33,875
[HAZANKO]
Enough of this.

210
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,291
Remember what I
tell you, Melfina.

211
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:40,375
You are the key sent to open the
gate that lies here before you.

212
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:44,541
As the maiden of the Leyline,
you will pass along my prayers.

213
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:49,041
Heh. I admit it was our own
fault that the <i>XGP</i> was stolen

214
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,833
from us to begin with.

215
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,958
Because of that
embarrassing deception,

216
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,958
I had to drop everything I was
working on to come here.

217
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,541
What are you saying?
What do you mean?

218
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:01,166
Save your breath. Your
questions are meaningless.

219
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,625
After all, you are just
a puppet in this game.

220
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:08,791
Come now. Be a good little girl
and open the gate for me.

221
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:14,625
No! Let me go. Please let me go!

222
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,250
[HAZANKO]
Leyline Project command!

223
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:21,500
It was you who broke
my Meissen plate!

224
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:30,000
[HAZANKO]
The path has been opened!

225
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,125
You're an extraordinary
woman, Suzuka.

226
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:47,166
I really do love you, in spite
of what you might think.

227
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,000
That's why I took this face.

228
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:51,791
And you went to all
this trouble to see me.

229
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,708
With a mountain of treasure
right in front of you,

230
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,833
you turned it down and chose me.

231
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,250
My individuality's
what's important to me.

232
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:02,541
Everything in my world is
an extension of that standard.

233
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:05,083
But you wouldn't understand
that, now would you?

234
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,291
No, I don't understand.

235
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:11,083
But then you don't understand
my feelings, either, now do you?

236
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:13,083
Zanpa Randou!

237
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,625
[chuckling]

238
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,500
Now isn't that too bad.
I wanted to take you alive.

239
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:23,041
But I guess I don't
know my own strength.

240
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:27,291
[SUZUKA]
It was I who let you hit me.

241
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,916
I wanted to experience
the pain that you inflicted

242
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,708
on all of those you killed.

243
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:34,000
You've had your chance,
and now it's my turn!

244
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:34,916
[HIORIGA]
Oh, really?

245
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,625
Zanpa Randou!

246
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:46,583
Well, Suzuka, I've never
seen that technique.

247
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,500
[SUZUKA]
It's called Crimson.

248
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,708
You never used it
back then, did you?

249
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:52,875
[SUZUKA]
No, I didn't.

250
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:56,916
I invented it afterwards,
just for you.

251
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,375
I see.

252
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:10,500
[yelling]

253
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,250
[chuckles]

254
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:30,125
[JUKAI]
She was all talk! Ha!

255
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,083
Impossible! Uh!

256
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,791
[AISHA]
Boy, that really wiped me out.

257
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:43,375
A little rest right here
and I'll be as good as new.

258
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:48,083
Gene, save some Dragonite
for me. I'm gonna need it.

259
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:52,166
[KHAN]
My, my, isn't that fascinating?

260
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,333
Oh my, my!

261
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:55,708
What's this?

262
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,750
Oh my goodness!
Looks like Hazanko's work.

263
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:02,833
Unfortunately, he got
here before I did.

264
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:05,625
Harry... Harry!

265
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:09,583
You were the only
brother I ever had.

266
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:12,625
Hazanko did this to you Harry,
didn't he? That bastard.

267
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:15,250
I'll kill him with
my own two hands1

268
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,583
[KHAN]
Is it in here?

269
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:19,291
It's in here, isn't it?
It is, isn't it?

270
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,500
[RON]
Wait, professor.

271
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,458
You stay here with
Harry, I'll go in.

272
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,458
[KHAN]
Huh? What for?

273
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,125
Why should I stay behind?

274
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:27,958
Especially when no one
worked harder than I did

275
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:30,083
to get us here in
the first place.

276
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:33,375
[RON] And if my little brother
is dead as a result, professor,

277
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:37,000
you should bear some of the
responsibility, don't you think?

278
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,375
What? Now that's
utterly preposterous.

279
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,750
It's not even logical.

280
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,958
Yeah, well for a man who
just lost his only brother,

281
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,083
it's logical enough, professor.

282
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,208
[GENE]
Aw, great.

283
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:47,500
I finally make it
to the finish line,

284
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:50,708
and that babe doesn't
even wait for me.

285
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,791
MacDougall, where's Melfina?

286
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,625
Well if it isn't Gene Starwind.

287
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,041
Now that I stop
to think about it,

288
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:59,333
it was you and Hilda who
started this ridiculous party!

289
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:08,500
You keep tryin' the same
thing over and over again.

290
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:09,708
Well I'm tired of playin',

291
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,125
and now you're gonna
suffer like Harry did!

292
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,666
Yeah, well you're a little late.

293
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,291
For your information, that shell
I just fired was a number 9.

294
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:19,666
A number 9? Do they
actually exist?

295
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,791
But it doesn't look like it did
any kind of damage at all.

296
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:23,833
[gasps]

297
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,833
[screaming]

298
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,750
[screams]

299
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,958
Leyline Project activated.

300
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:00,208
[GENE]
She was crying, wasn't she?

301
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,041
[HILDA] But that isn't the
reason why you saved her,

302
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,041
is it, Gene?

303
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,125
[GENE]
Hilda!

304
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,083
An Outlaw must
always be a lone wolf

305
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,333
without anything
holding him down.

306
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,791
You can never count
on anyone but yourself,

307
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,041
but then sometimes you
just wanna feel the warmth

308
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,791
of another body, you know?

309
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,291
Gene, what do ya say?

310
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:19,041
Are you gonna go up into space
with your old man, or not?

311
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:24,625
No one's gonna give you a map.

312
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:27,458
You've gotta walk your
own path, Gene Starwind.

313
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,750
Gene, I've lived my life
following my dreams,

314
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,500
and I don't have any regrets.

315
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:35,458
And now it's time for
you to move on, son.

316
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,458
I'm countin' on you.

317
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,083
Good luck, Gene Starwind.

318
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,291
Good luck, Gene Starwind.

319
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,041
Now what?

320
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:45,583
I don't understand what
I'm supposed to do

321
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,416
stranded here all alone.

322
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,291
Help me. What am
I supposed to do?

323
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,458
Gene!

324
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:57,875
Gene!

325
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,083
[JIM]
Gene.

326
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:05,583
Aw, thank goodness.
Are you gonna be okay, Gene?

327
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,333
Yeah. What happened?

328
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,791
I don't know. I found you
lying here unconscious.

329
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,375
It looks like Harry MacDougall

330
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,333
was killed somewhere
along the way.

331
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,833
Really? Well I wasn't
the one who killed him.

332
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,541
Where did Mel go?

333
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,375
[GENE]
Up ahead probably.

334
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:20,625
I've gotta go after her.

335
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,208
[JIM]
'Kay, Let's go.

336
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:25,291
Jim, I want you to head
on back to the <i>Outlaw Star</i> .

337
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,833
But, Gene, I want-- Can't I--?

338
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:30,041
Can't I do anything to help you?

339
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,208
[GENE] I only have two
Caster shells left.

340
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,875
And if I run outta these,

341
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,916
I'll need you and the
<i>Outlaw Star</i> to rescue me.

342
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,791
We've made it through
all the hard times before

343
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,333
with our great teamwork, Jim.

344
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,583
I've always been out on the
front lines as the point man,

345
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:44,291
and you're...

346
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,000
...the backup.

347
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,958
I'll bring Melfina back.
You can count on it.

348
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,791
Now you go and find
Suzuka and Aisha

349
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,166
and stand by in
the ship, all right?

350
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,833
You've got it!

351
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,041
If we make it through this,

352
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,458
I'll bring us back a
mountain of treasure.

353
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:10,541
[VOICE]
What is thy desire?

354
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,958
What is thy desire?

355
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,166
What the...?

356
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,958
I guess that wasn't
the finish line.

357
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:29,833
[KHAN] Well, my, my, my.
Welcome, Gene. Welcome.

358
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:30,875
Gwen Khan!

359
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,458
[KHAN]
That's right. That's right.

360
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,916
I am Gwen Khan,
the eminent Gwen.

361
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,458
But listen, I'm in a fix
right now. I can't move ahead.

362
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,000
You see, I'm in quite
a predicament.

363
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,708
It seems the doors are
locked from the inside.

364
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,000
It's very frustrating
because the gate is open,

365
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:46,500
and it shouldn't be difficult.

366
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:48,375
I really must go on.

367
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,000
What a jam. What a jam.

368
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:51,958
Dammit! Do something!

369
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:54,250
You're the one who
started this stupid game!

370
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:57,750
Stop it! Stop it, please!
I just want to know, that's all.

371
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,666
I just want to know.

372
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:03,916
[BOTH]
Huh?

373
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,041
[GENE]
Harry!

374
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,458
Shit...

375
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:11,083
I always feel like hell
when I wa-wake up dead sleep.

376
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:13,333
Is M-Melfina around
here somewhere?

377
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:14,750
I came to s-see her.

378
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,875
No, don't. He's already dead.

379
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:19,000
You'd just be
wasting ammunition.

380
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:21,833
The auxiliary units in his body
are keeping him barely alive,

381
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:23,041
that's all.

382
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:25,791
He's like a phantom.
Nothing will affect him.

383
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,000
I know.

384
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:29,250
Do you think you can
open this door, Harry?

385
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:31,416
Give it a try.
If you pry it open,

386
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,625
I think you'll find
Melfina on the other side.

387
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:40,458
[VOICE] The path is to be
opened by the maiden.

388
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:44,458
This path is to be
opened by the maiden.

389
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:48,083
[HARRY]
Melfina!

390
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:51,125
Poor angel. There's a
protection program around her.

391
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:54,208
I'll just have to
delete the whole thing.

392
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:55,833
Melfina.

393
00:22:56,916 --> 00:22:58,333
Harry!

394
00:22:58,416 --> 00:23:00,875
[HARRY] I'm so glad
I made it in time.

395
00:23:00,958 --> 00:23:02,583
I'm sorry, Melfina.

396
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:04,333
I had such plans
for us together,

397
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:06,708
but all that I can do
now is wake you up.

398
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:09,375
I'm sorry that I
couldn't do more.

399
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:10,625
But there's something else

400
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:12,333
that I've been wanting
to tell you all along.

401
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:13,750
Harry...

402
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:17,333
Goodbye.

403
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,000
Harry!

404
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,500
My work's finished.

405
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:26,541
Go to her, Gene, and listen to
the beautiful song she sings.

406
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:28,041
A song?

407
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:32,250
Yes, that's right. Ask her
to sing it again. Just for me.

408
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:44,291
Incredible! The doors
have opened.

409
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:48,125
Don't worry.
I'll ask her, Harry.

410
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:49,541
Count on it!

411
00:25:25,416 --> 00:25:26,833
[GENE]
I've traveled the universe.

412
00:25:26,916 --> 00:25:28,458
I met a lot of
interesting people

413
00:25:28,541 --> 00:25:31,333
and experienced a lotta things
that you can only imagine.

414
00:25:31,416 --> 00:25:34,500
Maybe this isn't the time
to brag... but what the hell!

415
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:35,875
Now before you can talk big,

416
00:25:35,958 --> 00:25:38,166
you gotta put your money
where your mouth is.

417
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:41,458
Whaddaya say? Time for
one last big push!

418
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:43,208
I'll show you how
I live my life!

419
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,666
Hm?

420
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,583
Yeah, I guess that sounds
like I'm talking big again.

421
00:25:46,666 --> 00:25:48,833
Next time for <i>Outlaw Star</i> :

422
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:50,500
"Return to Space"

423
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:52,041
You better get ready!
