00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:22,166
[NARRATOR] On the so
called "Frontier of Space,"

2
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,708
areas more than 50 light
years away from Earth.

3
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:28,041
The degree of punishment
has become severe

4
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:31,708
in proportion to the flagrant
disregard for the law there.

5
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:34,916
A criminal arrested after
just one serious crime,

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
will immediately receive the
death penalty after a swift,

7
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:39,833
simple trial.

8
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:42,458
The infamous prison built
on the high-gravity world

9
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:46,291
of Hecatoncheir, Is also a
product of this harsh system

10
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:48,583
of frontier justice.

11
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:50,125
Since the day it opened,

12
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:54,041
it has come to be known as a
hellish place where time moves

13
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:59,541
at a snail's pace and no has
ever managed to come out alive.

14
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:03,791
Naturally, there is no instance
of a successful escape attempt.

15
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:05,875
So far, that is.

16
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,875
[TRANSPORT PILOT]
Hecatoncheir Orbital Station,

17
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:45,208
this is prisoner transport 109.

18
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,250
I have one prisoner
currently on board.

19
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,750
Request docking clearance.

20
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:51,000
[DECK OFFICER]
Roger, you are cleared.

21
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:55,583
[PRISON AI]
Prisoner Curse Hawkwind.

22
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:58,750
Sentenced to life imprisonment
for Class One murder, robbery,

23
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:01,583
rape and 17 other
felonious crimes.

24
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:03,458
[WARDEN] This one should
prove to be amusing.

25
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,666
Send him down at once.

26
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,000
[WARDEN] Is this your
only personal effect?

27
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:10,750
[GENE] Yeah, that's my
good luck charm.

28
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,500
Take good care of it, will ya?

29
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,458
[WARDEN]
What's taking you so long?

30
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:44,166
Take your food tray
and sit down now!

31
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,791
I hear you ran like a
wild man on the outside,

32
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:49,291
but if you can't learn to
move in gravity this low,

33
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:53,458
you'll never survive
very long in here, Curse.

34
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:56,000
You're so pathetic!
Three G's is nothing!

35
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:58,208
Up in the punishment
facility at the North Pole,

36
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:00,458
Ten G's is what you can expect.

37
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,666
At this rate you'll probably
die of massive heart failure

38
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,500
or a brain aneurism before
your sentence is up!

39
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,041
[chuckles]

40
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,291
[WARDEN] Hey, what are
you wobbling around for?

41
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,625
Start walking, damn you!

42
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:15,541
[grunts]

43
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:16,916
[WARDEN] Stand up,
and pull yourself together,

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,333
you good-for-nothing!

45
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,125
Easy, come on now, Jake.

46
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:23,125
You don't wanna be making
any trouble for the warden.

47
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:26,750
[WARDEN] Saiyo! This is
none of your business.

48
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,791
[SAIYO grunts]

49
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,583
[WARDEN] Don't try to dodge me.
Hold still, damn it!

50
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:37,000
[SAIYO chuckles] Sorry about
that man, I-I guess I slipped.

51
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,583
[WARDEN] Silence! I've had
enough of your yapping!

52
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,625
[GENE grunts]

53
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,333
[WARDEN] And what do
you think you're doing?

54
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,208
Why don't you put down
the puppet for a minute

55
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,291
and come out to meet me
face to face like a man?

56
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,083
How about it buddy?

57
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:54,250
[WARDEN] You bastard!
You'll pay for this!

58
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:59,416
[GENE mockingly laughs]

59
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,333
[GENE grunts]

60
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:02,625
Hey! Wait a munite!

61
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:05,541
[grunts]

62
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,625
You two think you're smart, huh?

63
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,666
Well, you just earned 24 hours
in the punishment facility.

64
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,333
Curse, you just
arrived here at Gehenna,

65
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:15,000
so it's time that you
learned what real fear means.

66
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,583
Let this serve as
a final warning

67
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:17,750
to all you other prisoners.

68
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,666
You are under
constant surveillance.

69
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,541
There's no use trying to
escape from this prison

70
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,375
and there's no
defying me either!

71
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,000
[WARDEN laughs]

72
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,458
You've got a serious
death wish, buddy.

73
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,375
Deliberately trying to
start something like that.

74
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,000
And what do you call
what you were doing?

75
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,500
[WARDEN] I don't want
to hear another word

76
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,916
out of either one of you!
Now get on board!

77
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,416
[BOTH grunt]

78
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,875
[grunts] That guy really likes
to play rough, doesn't he?

79
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:44,708
[SAIYO]
Ah, he's always like that.

80
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,083
[GENE grunts]

81
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,833
Maybe I shouldn't of
push the limit so much.

82
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,000
[GENE]
You mean Planet Hecatoncheir?

83
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,166
[KHAN]
Yes, that's right!

84
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,083
It's a strange world
that's very massive

85
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,375
for an Earth-type planet.

86
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,833
It has an incredibly
high rotational speed,

87
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:07,041
and a gravity of 1G
along its equator.

88
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,750
It's shaped like an intricate
string of beads on an abacus.

89
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,208
Hey, Gilliam!

90
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:13,458
[GILLIAM] Yes. Just a moment,
I'll pull up the data.

91
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,125
What's an abacus, anyway?

92
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,500
The point is, it's not the
shape that's the problem,

93
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:19,708
it's the gravity.

94
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,583
The force pushing down
on the planet varies

95
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,291
depending upon where you are.

96
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,916
It's a crushing
10.4G's at the poles,

97
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,083
even though it's still 3G's
where the prison is situated.

98
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,583
[JIM] Then I guess
you'd weigh three times

99
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:31,500
what you normally would.

100
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:32,750
That's right, Jim.

101
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,625
What a smart boy to figure
that out so quick.

102
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,916
At any rate, there isn't a
single area in the prison

103
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,583
where the gravity is stabilized.

104
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,458
As a matter of fact,
for security reasons,

105
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,625
you can't find a
gravity stabilized area

106
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,291
anywhere on the entire planet.

107
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,083
Due to its high
rotational speed,

108
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:49,041
the whole planet acts as a
huge dynamo, generating a

109
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,416
powerful magnetic
field around the globe.

110
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,291
The result is that radios
and radar don't transmit

111
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,916
or receive as well
on the surface.

112
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,541
And in human time,
one day is 74 minutes.

113
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,666
Just thinking about
it makes me sick.

114
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,458
I didn't realize
that Gehenna Prison

115
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:03,791
is on planet Hecatoncheir.

116
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,375
No wonder why no one has
ever gotten out alive.

117
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:07,875
Gene, you've got to be careful.

118
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:09,958
Your usual recklessness
won't serve you well

119
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,583
if you want to take
on this mission.

120
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,666
She's right. Use your
head this time.

121
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,916
If you jump in without
thinking, it's all over!

122
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,708
Yeah, like you're one to talk!

123
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,791
Gene, come on...

124
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,375
You say that no one's
ever gotten out alive, huh?

125
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,541
All right then what
are we waiting for?

126
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,208
[GENE]
Where are Suzuka and Aisha?

127
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,166
[JIM] Just like you said,
Aisha's with Mel,

128
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,958
and Suzuka's sticking
to Gwen Khan like glue.

129
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:35,083
All right, Jim, now don't
let your guard down.

130
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,833
[JIM]
Mm-hm.

131
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,625
Khan, did you get a
chance to look into what

132
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,125
I was asking you for?

133
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:42,291
Yes, as a matter of fact I've
got it right here with me.

134
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:43,500
A monopole.

135
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,416
I don't know what you're
going to use it for,

136
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,708
but bear in mind that
it's even more expensive

137
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,291
and more rare than Dragonite,

138
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:52,041
so make sure you return it to me
when you're finished using it.

139
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,416
Yeah, sure, I got it.
I understand what you're saying.

140
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,875
So anyway, were you able
to rig it like we discussed?

141
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:59,958
Of course. I camouflaged
it well, if I do say so myself.

142
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:03,000
It's an incredible piece of work
that would cost a small fortune

143
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,708
if it was made by someone else.

144
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:07,291
If you do say so yourself.

145
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,208
[GENE]
See you later, Jim.

146
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,041
I'm counting on you.

147
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,833
Yes, Sir!

148
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:19,125
[BOTH grunting]

[GENE grunts]

150
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:35,666
No small talk. Just get
right to the rough stuff.

151
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:41,041

This goddamn bed's in
here just to torture us.

I can't get up. Gimme a hand.

Hmph.

[SAIYO] Don't worry,
the warden isn't listening.

157
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,416
His radio only operates inside
the main prison compound.

158
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,958
They don't have the budget to
lay wires all the way up here

159
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,541
just to allow him
to run the robots

and cameras to
keep an eye on us.

161

this thing in the first place

if he can't even see us?

163
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,000
As a lesson to all
the other prisoners.

164
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,541
It's overkill, though.

There's no chance you can run
away in this 10G hell hole.

[GENE] I wanted to ask
you the coordinates...

178
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,625
...of the Galactic Leyline.

He destroyed an entire prison

inside his body before

00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:47,083
because you've got
too much spirit.

311
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,541
[GENE]
Does that go for you, too?

312
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:50,958
What was that, pal?

313
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:52,541
What about you, Wong,
are you throwing in the towel

314
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,333
and giving up
on everything, too?

315
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:55,625
That's what I mean.

316
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,125
That's the attitude
that's pissing people off!

317
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,875
As if I'd ever just
give up all hope

318
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,916
and wait to die in a
concrete bunker like this!

319
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,250
Okay then, what would you
do if I told you that I had

320
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:15,041
a surefire escape plan to
get us out of this place?

321
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,416
Huh?

gonna teach a lesson

to that smart ass new guy!

Where is it? Where's the fight?

If you've got that much energy,
I'll make sure you burn it off

Take it easy!

Getting mad is bad
for your blood pressure.

[WARDEN]
Not another word!

348
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,500
[GENE]
I'm asking you once again.

349
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,250
Can't you yell at
anybody face to face

350
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,208
instead through a camera lens?

351

Ow damn, that hurts!

354
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,750
You just had to open
your mouth, didn't ya'?

355
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:32,625
Geez, I still can't believe
I trusted an idiot like you.

356
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,916
I guess I must be losing
my edge or something.

357
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,500
So anyway, did you get what
you were looking for in there?

358
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,708
Yeah, how about you?

359
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,625
You mean this?

Are you absolutely sure that
doin' this is such a great idea?

366
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,708
Everything's gonna be alright.

367
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:08,791
Even if we try and jump the
train tracks at the next stop,

368
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:13,291
the gravity's so strong that we
oughta stop right away at least.

369
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,958
I think so.

370
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:15,958
I hope it works.

00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:18,083

Hey, wait a minute!

Get to work and do something!

373
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,166
[PRISON AI] I am sorry, but it
is totally out of my control.

374
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,750
To stop the train,

375
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,250
it is necessary to shut down the
entire transportation system.

376
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,541
Do I have permission
to initiate a shutdown?

I can't do that! Are you crazy?

Capture them at once
and bring them here!

Everything's gone smoothly
according to your plan so far,

but what do we do now, huh?

387
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,125
That's where this baby comes in.

388
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:13,416
Oh, the good luck charm.

389
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,208
What do you plan on
doing with that thing?

390
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,416
You gonna start
praying or somethin'?

391
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,500
[GENE] You see, it's not
an ordinary compass.

392
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:20,833
There are two monopoles,

393
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,833
magnetic particles
with just one pole

394
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:25,541
except it's designed to
resemble a regular compass.

395
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,541
You got some kinda
trick up your sleeve?

396
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:28,708
Yeah somethin' like that. Huh?

Give up, there's no escape.

399
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:32,791
If you surrender peacefully,

00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,791
I'll make sure that you
granted a quick death.

[WARDEN chuckles]

402
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,666
Yeah, why don't you
bite me, you slowpoke!

403
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,083
This is really too bad, Wong.

404
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,166
Just when we were having
such a wonderful time here.

405
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,166
What, hey?!

406
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,500
Okay now, listen up.

407
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,875
If I'm not mistaken this
is the north pole, right?

408
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:49,083
Now the south attracts,
and the north repels.

409
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,166
But a magnetic monopole
plays by its own rules

410
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,833
because it only has one pole.

411
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:55,083
So the south monopole will
be pulled into the ground

412
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:56,708
while the--Oops!

413
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,875
And conversely, the north
monopole will be sent

414
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:01,166
flying upward along
the magnetic field line.

with such a crazy idea,

00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,958
who in their right mind would
ever believe that it would work?

419
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,000
How high are you
planning to go up, anyway?

420
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,375
That depends on when
our ride shows up.

421
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,958
But in the meantime, I'd suggest
that you start praying that my

to fly as low as possible.

with you again! I mean it!

Okay, it's pretty much
empty over the pole.

a catch and go at full speed!

want to see his face again.

00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:08,958
[GENE, JIM]
Uh...?

468
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:10,250
Well, you're satisfied, right?

469
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,041
Now hurry up and ask
about the Leyline.

470
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,375
[grunts]

471
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,041
Sorry, but someone had
to put you in your place.

472
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,166
That's right. The guy's a moron.

473
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,500
You can use this guy's
spaceship, if you hurry up.

474
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:20,625
He's out cold now.

475
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:21,916
In return, do me a favor

476
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,541
and ditch him someplace
along the way?

477
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:25,250
Would that be after I kill him?

478
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:26,583
[GENE]
No, look.

479
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:30,000
I told you before.
I'm an Outlaw, not a criminal.

480
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:32,291
I'll leave him alone.

481
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:33,916
Analyze this when
you get a chance.

482
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,708
There's a data file in it.

483
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:36,916
The password's "Miranda".

484
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,250
It also happens to
be my daughter's name.

485
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:41,666
That's a nice name.

486
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,875
Course it is, I'm the
one who gave it to her.

487
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:46,708
Anyway, the data file contains
The Leyline's coordinates.

488
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:49,416
After that you can go get
yourself killed for all I care.

489
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,583
Never want to see
an Outlaw again.

490
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:55,041
[chuckles]

491
00:22:55,125 --> 00:23:00,083
[BOTH laugh]

492
00:24:47,958 --> 00:24:49,833
[GENE] With the Galactic
Leyline waiting right under

493
00:24:49,916 --> 00:24:52,541
our noses, We visit a planet
in search of Caster shells

494
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:53,875
to complete our armory.

495
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:55,916
While there, we come
across a couple of wise men

496
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,875
and a very mysterious woman.

497
00:24:57,958 --> 00:24:59,458
Wait...

498
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:02,083
I see before me a paradise of
sexy ladies panting with desire!

499
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:03,375
Oh. it's so good to be alive!

500
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:04,250
Thank you, God!

501
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:05,541
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

502
00:25:05,625 --> 00:25:06,875
Be sure to be there.

503
00:25:06,958 --> 00:25:08,958
Next time on Outlaw Star:

504
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:12,208
"Hot Springs Planet Tenrei"!
You better get ready!

505
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:14,375
Fever! Fever! Fever!
