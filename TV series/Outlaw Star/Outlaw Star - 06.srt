1
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:19,000
[NARRATOR]
To kill.

2
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:21,250
That is this woman's profession.

3
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:22,583
To kill.

4
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:25,875
That is the only means
by which she can survive.

5
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:28,500
Her name is Suzuka.

6
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:30,750
There are none
who know her past.

7
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:33,500
There are none who
ask about her past.

8
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:36,291
Through killing,
she finds herself.

9
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:38,791
She weeps as she
watches the wind,

10
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:42,333
and senses the currents of
the universe in her skin.

11
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:45,625
This is the kind of
woman that Suzuka is.

12
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:47,708
She is not a special woman.

13
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:49,875
All woman are special.

14
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:52,833
All woman possess many faces.

15
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:57,000
Yet, no man has ever seen
the faces of Suzuka.

16
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:58,916
All that men can see

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,250
is the gleaming sword
she holds in her hands.

18
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:05,625
Even if these men, who
see her gleaming blade,

19
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:08,000
were to receive
just a brief smile,

20
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:12,708
they would never see it nor know
of it while they were alive.

21
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:15,708
This woman's name is Suzuka.

22
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:17,041
To kill.

23
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:20,000
This is her profession.

24
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:54,083
[CONTROL MAN]
Don't be stupid!

25
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:55,833
Start your landing approach!

26
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:58,625
[GENE] I don't have the fuel!
I'm comin' in!

27
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:02,541
[CONTROL MAN]
Decelerate!

28
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,458
You gotta cut down your speed!

29
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,250
Follow the guide beacon!

30
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,208
That's what I'm doing!

31
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,541
[CONTROL MAN]
There's no wind today!

32
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,750
What kind of landing
is he trying to pull?!

33
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:15,041
[GENE] Hey, I haven't piloted
a spaceship in six years!

34
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,666
And my dad never taught
me how to make planetfall,

35
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,875
so this is the first time
I've ever landed one!

36
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,083
Oh, great.

37
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,208
Any other suprises
you got for us?

38
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:24,500
[MELFINA]
I'll handle alignment

39
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,125
with the landing
beacon from here.

40
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,125
[GILLIAM] Why don't you take
care of the whole procedure

41
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,083
from this moment on, Melfina?

42
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,125
[MELFINA] I can't take care
of the whole procedure.

43
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,291
Hey! It's my ship!
And I'll do it!

44
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:37,000
I hate to say it but, we're
still comin' in too fast!

45
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,333
Ahh... Come on!

46
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,708
Hey, how 'bout that?

47
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,333
[GILLIAM]
That is a problem.

48
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:49,500
[GENE]
Mm? Ugh?!

49
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:50,916
[JIM]
Gene!

50
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:52,791
[GENE]
Shit!

51
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,125
[MELFINA]
One hundred to surface.

52
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,000
Deploy landing struts.

53
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,291
I'm on it!

54
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,000
[GILLIAM]
Easy, Gene. Be gentle now.

55
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,583
Ah, sue me!

56
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:10,500
[JIM]
I'm hatin' this! Ah!

57
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,875
Dammit! [grunting]

58
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,041
[MELFINA]
Please cut the engines.

59
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,958
I'll get us under control.

60
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,083
[GILLIAM] Landing strut
three status is yellow.

61
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,500
It's going to break,
at this rate.

62
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:22,916
Lay off! This ship isn't that
flimsy, and you know it!

63
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,583
[GENE, JIM sigh]

64
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:35,375
[CONTROL MAN]
<i>Outlaw Star</i> ...

65
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:39,500
Welcome to Sentinel III,
West Virginia Spaceport.

66
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:43,125
Yeah, I pulled it off, no prob.

67
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,666
[JIM]
What are you talking about?!

68
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,625
You almost got us killed!

69
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,833
[GILLIAM] With this captain's
piloting technique,

70
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,208
I worry about my
future prospects...

71
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,208
Ha!

72
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:53,458
[CONTROL MAN]
So, what'll it be?

73
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,041
Will you be taking off
once you're re-supplied

74
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,041
or do you plan to park
here for while?

75
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,791
[GENE]
Take us to the cheapest dock.

76
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,625
We may be registered
out of Blue Heaven,

77
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,416
but our crew is from here.

78
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:18,208
So, what do you wanna do, Gene?
Go back to the shop?

79
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:21,333
No, I want to go to Fred Luo's
place over in Hugo right away,

80
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:24,208
but before that I'd like to
know what happened to our car?

81
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,083
Ah!

82
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,875
It's been sitting in that silo!

83
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,541
Yeah, I wonder if
it's been stolen?

84
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,833
No way, it can't be!

85
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,875
Ahh, let's just rent a
car for now so we can

86
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,041
get over to Hugo.

87
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,458
We can make it in three
hours if we hurry.

88
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:43,250
Aw. I sure hope my Ehefrau's
okay, after all this time.

89
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:44,666
Okay.

90
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,625
Once we've taken care of
business, we'll go look for it.

91
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:49,958
[JIM] All right, but I don't
know how to act around that guy.

92
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,916
Come on, Jim. You think
I know any better?

93
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,666
[FRED]
Oh, Gene!

94
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,583
It's been so long!

95
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,333
[GENE]
You're looking well, Fred.

96
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,458
[FRED] You never call me!
You never write me!

97
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:11,583
I never hear from you. Aw!

98
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,166
I'm so very happy
you came to see me!

99
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,166
[GENE]
Y-Yeah, I-I'm happy, too.

100
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,250
Is this Gene's friend Fred Luo?

101
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:22,625
Yeah, that'd be him. Gene did
some job for him awhile ago.

102
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:25,041
Oh, is that you James?!

103
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,916
It looks like you're
growing up quickly!

104
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,291
Yeah, well, I guess.

105
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,000
[sighs]

106
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,791
Yeah, yeah, okay. It's nice
to see you, too, Fred.

107
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,166
[FRED]
I can't wait to see you

108
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,500
in another two or three years.

109
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,000
Yeah, well in two
or three years,

110
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,208
I think I'll be some
place far, far away.

111
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:41,833
[FRED] Well then,
I'd just come after you,

112
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:44,583
to the edge of the
universe if I had to.

113
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,416
And who might this
young lady be?

114
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,583
Uh...

115
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:50,625
Uh. How do you do?
My name is Melfina.

116
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,541
Yes, pleased to meet you.

117
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,916
Fred, I have some business
to discuss with you.

118
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,791
Man, It's a good thing
you're here on Sentinel

119
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:57,666
and I found you.

120
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,666
Yeah, my father secured

121
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,666
our company's headquarters
on Heifong.

122
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,916
Now that I'm in charge,

123
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,458
I want to concentrate my
efforts on the frontier.

124
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,750
If I don't expand
the Luo family's market

125
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:10,000
beyond what my dad has,
I'll be a laughing-stock.

126
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,583
And what's goin' on with Earth?

127
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,583
[FRED]
Well, the Federation merchants

128
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,458
are pretty powerful there.

129
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:18,083
So, what's this business
you mentioned, huh?

130
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,208
It's my spaceship.

131
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:20,333
I'm gonna need a--

132
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:21,375
--[FRED exhales]
--[GENE screams]

133
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:24,041
[FRED]
It was just a joke! A joke!

134
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:27,000
[panting]

135
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,708
[GENE] Come on, man, I thought
I told you that I hate

136
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:31,916
those jokes of yours, Fred!

137
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,666
Okay, okay! No more
jokes, all right?

138
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,666
Yeah, right.

139
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,208
I'll be series from now on.

140
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,916
[GENE] It's even worse
when you're series.

141
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,541
Com'on, I'm not kidding.

142
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,666
So, you were saying something
about a spaceship?

143
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,958
That's right, I finally
got my hands on one.

144
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,541
[FRED]
Well, that's great!

145
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,166
You know, Gene, you should have
gone into space a long time ago!

146
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,583
[GENE]
I know.

147
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,041
But, the ship doesn't have
any equipment or weapons.

148
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,541
I want you to sell me some.

149
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:57,625
[FRED] Gene, we may be friends,
but business is business.

150
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:01,000
Do you have any idea how much
weapons and equipment costs?

151
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,500
Yeah, I know, I know,

152
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:05,083
but I'm not too sure what
the situation is on this one.

153
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,041
I have a Grappler Ship.

154
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:10,791
Ohh... You know we have
a rule in the Luo family

155
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,041
to never to ask
the customer "why."

156
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,791
That means we sell the
customer what they want,

157
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,375
no questions asked.

158
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:20,916
But for the first time in my
life, I want to break the rules.

159
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,125
I don't know, Fred.

160
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,708
I don't know if you
should break that rule.

161
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:27,125
Oh, dear, it's even more
expensive with a Grappler Ship.

162
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,833
And we can't go through
our legitimate routes.

163
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,916
But, I think I will be able to
help you with the equipment,

164
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,750
except when are
you gonna pay me?

165
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,000
When I make it big!

166
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,583
Gene, we have another
rule in the Luo family:

167
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,208
Trust can't be
bought with money,

168
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,041
but it can't take
it's place either.

169
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:45,208
Trusting you and knowing
I'll be paid by you

170
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,083
are two different
things all together.

171
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,166
Now, that rule you
can break, all right?

172
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,125
Come on, Gene, you know
you can't do business

173
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,958
without some assurance
you'll be paid.

174
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,458
Look, I'll write
out what I want,

175
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,000
so could you at least
give me an estimate?

176
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,375
[FRED]
I suppose.

177
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,166
But after you've seen
the price on the estimate

178
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,833
you may have a change of heart.

179
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,583
Use the desk in
the display area.

180
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,291
It's time for my
next appointment.

181
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,000
All right, then.

182
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:10,708
Hey, you!

183
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,208
[GENE]
Hm?

184
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,375
Do you know why we don't turn
you away and lock you out

185
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,666
even though you're rude
to the young master?

186
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,208
Uh. Cause you'll get yourself
hurt if you take me on?

187
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:22,916
No. Because the young master
happens to love you.

188
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,625
[GENE]
What was that?

189
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,708
[JIM]
I don't wanna know.

190
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:31,416
Damn, he's more tight-fisted
than I thought it was.

191
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,916
[JIM]
That's how people operate, Gene.

192
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,833
Hey, aren't you gonna
put together that list

193
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:39,625
for an estimate?

194
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,416
Oh, yeah, right.

195
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,958
[FRED]
Welcome, young lady.

196
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:48,000
I see you were
referred by Mr. Oh.

197
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:51,125
You need large quantities
of military rifles, then?

198
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,291
[WOMAN]
No, I don't want any rifles.

199
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,333
Excuse me? What do
you want, then?

200
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:58,666
And the referral from
Mr. Oh is a lie, as well.

201
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:15,208
What I want, Mr. Luo,
is your life.

202
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,333
[FRED]
Huh?!

203
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,708
I'll let you to live...

204
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:23,375
...for just another five
minutes. You may feel free

205
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,500
to take the time to write
out a farewell letter

206
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,958
to say your goodbyes.

207
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,041
However, should you
not accept your death

208
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,333
under these terms,
you will die at once.

209
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:32,958
Why is that you're after me?

210
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:35,125
If you continue to
expand your market,

211
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,625
someone else's is
bound to shrink.

212
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,916
Some people find
that unacceptable.

213
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,958
Is it Ralph? Or is it Otto?

214
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,000
Who could it be?

215
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,541
You have four minutes.

216
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:47,666
The sun will soon drift
below the horizon.

217
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,916
After all, that is a
fitting time to die.

218
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,166
I... can't believe it!

219
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,833
You're "Twilight" Suzuka?!

220
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,541
Introductions are a bit late,
don't you think you should

221
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:58,291
put better use to what
little time you have left.

222
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,583
[gasping]

223
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:01,875
[SUZUKA]
Is something the matter?

224
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:04,250
You have only three minutes.

225
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,750
Hey, Fred!

226
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,125
[GENE grunting]

227
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:20,916
A light shield, huh?

228
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,291
Gene! I'm over here!
Save me! Save me!

229
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,375
Help me, Gene!

230
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:30,500
[GENE]
Stay down!

231
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:33,583
[FRED]
Ah! [whimpers]

232
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:55,000
Agh!

233
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:57,333
[GENE]
I have a light shield, too.

234
00:11:58,333 --> 00:11:59,416
[SUZUKA]
Heh.

235
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,500
[GENE grunting]

236
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:09,208
[SUZUKA]
I won't tolerate interference.

237
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:13,541
Okay, whaddya say we play fair?

238
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:14,791
Charming...

239
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:17,500
Do you actually think
that your using a sword

240
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,166
would be challenging?

241
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:27,041
[GENE yelling]

242
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:32,583
[ringing]

243
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,333
[gasps]

244
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:35,875
What's that?

245
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,625
It's too late,
I failed to kill him!

246
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,416
[SUZUKA yells]

247
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,375
[GENE groaning]

248
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,375
I'm okay, Gene!

249
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:53,416
[SUZUKA]
Fred Luo!

250
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,333
I'll wait for your life!

251
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,583
Just until the next sunset.

252
00:12:57,666 --> 00:13:00,083
Damn! She knows how
to make a fast exit!

253
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,833
[FRED]
Aw! Gene! You saved my life!

254
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,583
You have to keep on protecting
me until this is all over!

255
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:08,458
So, you want me to do
something about her, huh?

256
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:11,333
I'll take the job, but only if
you do something about this.

257
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,875
[FRED]
Huh?

258
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,375
If this is all you need,
it's a bargain!

259
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:16,708
Huh What?

260
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,291
[FRED]
You don't understand...

261
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:21,208
No one has ever been targeted
by "Twilight" Suzuka and lived.

262
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,416
She's an ultra-class-A assassin.

263
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,541
Oh, yeah...

264
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,500
What may I ask are you doing?

265
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:29,916
I'm adding in some more missiles
that I was holding back on.

266
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,333
[FRED]
Huh?

267
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,583
First, I must deal
with that bodyguard.

268
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:07,333
[BODYGUARD A] It doesn't seem
to be a sensor malfunction.

269
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,500
But the sensor didn't
pick up anything at all,

270
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:10,583
I don't understand.

271
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,250
[GENE]
It was a Bokuto.

272
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,958
It's a sword made of wood.

273
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,041
It would never be picked
up by the sensors.

274
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,333
A wooden sword?

275
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,500
Are you saying she did this
with a wooden sword?

276
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,916
[GENE]
That's exactly what I'm saying.

277
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,833
Hey Fred, you got any
Caster shells around here?

278
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,708
There's little demand for them.

279
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:40,875
Plus they're antiques and that's
just not our style around here.

280
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,208
[GENE]
So, what're you gonna do?

281
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:43,708
What am I gonna do?

282
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,958
Yeah, are you gonna just wait
for her to show up again,

283
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:47,500
or are you gonna get
the hell out of here?

284
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:50,375
Well, she did tell you you
had till the next sunset.

285
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:53,166
[GENE] People like that
always stick to their style.

286
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,625
And you can bet they'll go after
anyone who interferes with it.

287
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:59,791
And since, you interfered,
I guess she's goin' after ya.

288
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,458
Uh... Oh, shit!

289
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,708
Wait a minute here,
let me think things over.

290
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:06,125
There's got to be
a way out of this.

291
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,500
I've got it!

292
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,958
Why not track down her employer
and kill him first?!

293
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:12,500
Assuming we can find him
before the next sunset,

294
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,375
which is 23 hours from now.

295
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:16,000
Well, guys, let's get goin'!

296
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,583
Huh? But where are we going?

297
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,541
I'm tired. I want to find
a hotel and get some rest.

298
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:21,708
But you can't, Gene!

299
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:23,583
You've gotta stay with me,
you can't leave!

300
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:26,000
If you need a place to stay,
you can use my room!

301
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,375
Stay with me wherever I am,
in my bed or in the bath!

302
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:29,833
Thanks a lot Fred,
but I'll pass!

303
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:32,000
Don't worry, she'll
stay true to her word.

304
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:32,833
See ya!

305
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,208
[FRED]
But! But, Gene...

306
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,333
[GENE] I'll give you a call,
once we find a hotel!

307
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,083
[door clicks]

308
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,416
[whimpers]

309
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,166
[JIM] Hey, are you really
gonna be his bodyguard?

310
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,625
[GENE]
Like I have a choice.

311
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,666
Look Jim, you know
that the <i>Outlaw Star</i>

312
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,958
needs a whole mess of supplies.

313
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,833
If he says I can't pay
him when I make it big--

314
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:52,333
[SUZUKA]
That is no longer a possibility.

315
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:56,000
[SUZUKA]
I am "Twilight" Suzuka.

316
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:59,500
Shall we not waste anymore
time and begin our duel?

317
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,375
I'm Gene Starwind.

318
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:02,833
I'm sorry to disappointed you,

319
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,916
but dueling isn't
an Outlaw custom.

320
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,041
[SUZUKA] Once the opponents
have named themselves,

321
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,083
the fight has begun!

322
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:15,625
What?! You've gotta
be kidding me!

323
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:16,541
Melfina!

324
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,125
Go back to Fred's place!

325
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,500
[JIM]
What about me?!

326
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,041
[GENE]
Back me up!

327
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,500
[JIM]
No way!

328
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,125
[GENE]
Great.

329
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,875
[GENE]
Damn! My gun is useless.

330
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:02,791
[GENE]
That was great!

331
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,416
Was that one of those tricks
that only masters can do?

332
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,625
That was merely
a feat of strength.

333
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,458
Secret techniques
aren't necessary

334
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:09,833
against those who runs away.

335
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:12,625
Heh, heh! You hurt
my feelings.

336
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:16,583
[SUZUKA] Why don't you stop
running and learn to face me?

337
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:17,875
Gene! Get in!

338
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,583
[GENE]
See ya later!

339
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,125
You can't get away!

340
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:26,208
[JIM]
Gene! She's following us!

341
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:29,958
Damn, that lady's persistent.

342
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,666
Looks like I'm gonna
have to take her on.

343
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,208
Jim, listen, while
we're on the road,

344
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,375
I'll need you to do
something for me.

345
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:52,333
[SUZUKA] Have you finally
decided to face me in a duel?

346
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,166
You know, I gotta do
something about you,

347
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,916
otherwise I'm not gonna
get what I want from Fred.

348
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
[SUZUKA]
Worldly desires are foolish.

349
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,208
They have cost you your life.

350
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,833
Perhaps, and there are some
desires that are big enough

351
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,083
to risk your life for!

352
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,541
This is one of them!

353
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:10,416
I have to put my life
on the line for this!

354
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,916
What are you up to now?

355
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,166
[GENE]
Get down here!

356
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,916
What's the matter?
Are you scared?

357
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,625
You fool!

358
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,458
[SUZUKA yells]

359
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,333
A shield?

360
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:33,625
If you focus 'em at a single
point, then you can do this!

361
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,375
You need to know
the trick to it.

362
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,250
That won't work!

363
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,166
[SUZUKA chuckles]

364
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:52,958
Dammit!

365
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,208
Come back here!

366
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:10,583
[SUZUKA gasping]

367
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,041
[GENE]
I got it!

368
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,333
Give that to me!

369
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:21,458
Which one?!

370
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:22,750
[SUZUKA]
Both of them!

371
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,291
[GENE]
Hmm?

372
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:25,541
[sniffing]

373
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,875
Stop that! What do you
think you're doing?!

374
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,583
This smells real nice.

375
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,250
That's a beautiful
woman for ya.

376
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,041
Will you stop fooling around!

377
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,875
[GENE] If you want your
sash and sword back,

378
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:37,625
I suggest you let Fred Luo live.

379
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,916
I plan on carrying
out my contract.

380
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,875
Then, I won't give them
back. The sash will go

381
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,791
in my collection, and
I'll just break the sword.

382
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,958
[SUZUKA] You can't!
I won't let you do that!

383
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,333
[GENE] Like you can
do anything about it!

384
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:52,500
Damn you!

385
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,208
Yeah, I don't wanna
hear it anymore!

386
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,833
We're makin' a deal right
now, a deal on my terms,

387
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:58,291
a draw and nothing more.

388
00:19:58,375 --> 00:19:59,958
Anything but a draw!

389
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,125
If I'd used a secret
technique first,

390
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,291
this wouldn't 've happened!

391
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,208
Can't ya handle it?
Then fine. You lost.

392
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,625
You underestimated me.

393
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,208
I lost?

394
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,958
I can't.

395
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:15,208
If it were just a fight
between you and me,

396
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,625
there wouldn't be a problem.

397
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,916
But I don't stand a chance
fighting over Fred's life.

398
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,541
I can't stay with Fred
and protect him

399
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:23,625
for the rest of my life.
I'm going back into space.

400
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:27,083
You mean to tell me you're not
his bodyguard after all of this?

401
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,791
[GENE] No, I told you
right from the start.

402
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:29,791
I'm an Outlaw.

403
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:30,666
Outlaw?

404
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,208
That's right.

405
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,333
I will carry out my contract.

406
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,291
I'll keep trying
as long as I live.

407
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,208
I still have my pride.

408
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:40,875
Then you will die!

409
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,333
[GENE]
"Twilight" Suzuka just died.

410
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,083
[SUZUKA gasps]

411
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,041
Forget about your contract.

412
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,583
[SUZUKA]
Flawed reasoning like that

413
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,333
will not convince me to give up!

414
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,125
[GENE]
Well, works for me.

415
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:57,083
Here, you can have these back
as payment for Fred's life.

416
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,666
Wait! You must understand

417
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,916
I cannot consent
to deal like that!

418
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,958
[GENE]
Why?

419
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:04,458
Because you're bound
by a contract?

420
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:07,041
[SUZUKA]
No, by my pride.

421
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,333
[GENE]
Well then.

422
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,958
I guess I'm the one who's
damaged your pride.

423
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,250
So, how 'bout we try
and make another deal?

424
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:15,208
If you're going to kill Fred,
then you have to kill me first.

425
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,250
Yes, that goes without saying.

426
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,250
[GENE]
Great! We have a deal, then!

427
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,666
On your pride now, don't
forget what you said.

428
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,875
What?!

429
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:24,125
But, I uh...

430
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:27,125
[GENE] I'll be careful
during sunsets, okay?

431
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,208
But...

432
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:29,208
Oh, right...

433
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,583
Okay! That settles it that then!

434
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,208
Gene, are you sure that's
a good idea, saying that?

435
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:38,000
There is not much else I can
say, Jim, protecting myself

436
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,750
is gonna be a lot of easier
than me protecting Fred.

437
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:43,666
Okay, fine, whatever you say.

438
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,791
[SUZUKA]
That man... Why...?

439
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:54,791
[FRED]
So, I should deliver them

440
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:57,333
to dock 26 at Locus'
spaceport, then?

441
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,375
[GENE]
Yeah. Thanks.

442
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:01,208
I knew that I could
count on you, Gene,

443
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:03,083
you have truly saved my life!

444
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:06,500
"Twilight" Suzuka won't be
coming after me anymore, right?

445
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:09,083
Yeah, but I'm not so sure
about the guy who hired her.

446
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:10,333
Well, I can handle that.

447
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:12,333
Given enough time,
I'll be able to find him.

448
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:14,708
Well, I hope to get more help
from you in the future.

449
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,000
Let's just say you owe me

450
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:18,125
for getting Suzuka
to want to kill me.

451
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:21,416
[FRED] What I owe you comes
to 750 thousand wong.

452
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,875
What are you talking about?

453
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:24,916
[FRED] That's what left
when you subtract

454
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,625
the cost of the
items you ordered

455
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:29,250
from how much it would
cost you to hire Suzuka!

456
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:31,000
Damn it, Fred!

457
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,166
Hey, you guys, I thought
you said he loved me?!

458
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,875
The young master gave
you a 30% discount.

459
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:36,958
[BODYGUARD B]
Hm-hm!

460
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:38,791
[FRED]
That's right, Gene, a discount!

461
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:40,041
[GENE]
Huh?! Ah!

462
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,833
Aw! I look forward to
a long relationship!

463
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:45,416
It costs a lot to
maintain a spaceship!

464
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,958
Even more so with a
Grappler Ship, you know!

465
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:50,125
[sighs] Yeah, Fred, I know.

466
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:52,083
These damn merchants.

467
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:58,833
That's it. The
negotiations are over.

468
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:00,416
Oh, I see.

469
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,166
Gene, do you think you persuaded
that assassin woman to give up?

470
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,708
I wouldn't call it
"persuaded," exactly.

471
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:07,833
Hey! I couldn't just
kill her! So sue me!

472
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:09,291
Yeah, yeah...

473
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:11,125
[MELFINA]
Oh?

474
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:19,958
[SUZUKA]
Gene Starwind,

475
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:22,625
this isn't over.

476
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:01,041
[GENE]
I got a ship and I got a woman.

477
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,666
Now I can live out the rest
of my days in peace,

478
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,125
but I don't think
that's gonna happen.

479
00:25:05,208 --> 00:25:07,500
Those damn pirates
are attacking again!

480
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:09,416
And these new guys
are real tough!

481
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,666
They're makin' it
hard for all of us!

482
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:14,125
Go, Suzuka!

483
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:16,041
Stand up to 'em, Jim!

484
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:18,791
Given the situation, I guess
I better get outta there, too.

485
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:21,000
They can't do it without me.

486
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:23,750
Next time, on <i>Outlaw Star</i> :

487
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:25,333
"Creeping Evil"!

488
00:25:25,416 --> 00:25:26,833
You better get ready!
