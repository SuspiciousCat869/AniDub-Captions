1
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:21,625
[NARRATOR] What's beyond
that sea, I wonder?

2
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:25,125
The children leave their
homes in search of this quest.

3
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:28,458
As they search, they are
always asking questions.

4
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:31,708
What's out there?
What's waiting for me?

5
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:35,333
Leaving their innocence behind,
they set out on this journey

6
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:38,833
and experience many
life-changing adventures.

7
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:41,458
Countless difficulties
lie in wait.

8
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:45,458
Moments of Despair.
The lure of the razor's edge.

9
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:50,000
There's always hope, joy,
meeting new friends.

10
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,916
They face challenges,
but in the process,

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,125
they come to find themselves.

12
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:57,833
This is a journey.

13
00:00:57,916 --> 00:00:59,833
When they have
conquered a new land,

14
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:03,875
yet another sea is
reflected in their eyes.

15
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:06,208
What's beyond that sea?

16
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:10,458
When boys become young men,
they begin thier own quest.

17
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:14,125
Life is an endless journey.

18
00:02:57,583 --> 00:03:00,583
[GILLIAM] I can't believe this.
This is really too much.

19
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,958
Because of Gene's
constant recklessness,

20
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,666
I've been forced to take
this dangerous route.

21
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,875
[GILLIAM]
What are you doing now, Gene?

22
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,625
It's pretty cool,
don't you think?

23
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:44,458
[GILLIAM] Very amusing. Now
would you please get some rest.

24
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:46,333
[GENE]
All right.

25
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:49,458
[chuckles] I think that
I was sleepwalking.

26
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,583
Sorry, I'll go
to bed now. Night.

27
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,166
[GILLIAM]
Very well, Gene. Good night.

28
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:56,875
Uh, Gilliam?

29
00:03:56,958 --> 00:04:01,000
[GILLIAM] Yes. Is something
the matter, Gene?

30
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,000
Nah, nothin' really.

31
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,166
[groans]

32
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,416
[screams]

33
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,083
[MELFINA]
Jim?

34
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,416
[JIM]
Huh?

35
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,125
Yeah? What is it?

36
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,000
We don't seem to have any salt.

37
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,333
Salt?

38
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:36,875
I thought I saw some salt
around here somewhere.

39
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:39,041
Found it! Here ya go!

40
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,458
Oh, thanks a lot.

41
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:44,791
I've been cooking all day
and in a just while,

42
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,166
I'll have dinner ready.

43
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,541
Okay!

44
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,000
Phew.

45
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,125
Gilliam?

46
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,250
[GILLIAM]
What is it, Jim?

47
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:59,833
Where's Gene?
Isn't he out of bed yet?

48
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,666
[GILLIAM] No. I've been
trying to get him out of bed,

49
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,791
but I haven't had any luck yet.

50
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:04,875
[sighs]

51
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,833
All right, I'm sick a this.

52
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,416
[GILLIAM]
Gene, t's time to wake up. Gene!

53
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,000
Gene! Gene! Gene! Gene!

54
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,416
[GILLIAM]
Gene, wake up!

55
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,166
Gene! Gene! Gene! Gene!

56
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,416
[JIM growls]

57
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,541
Wake up!

58
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:23,916
Get up now!

59
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,250
Hello, sleeping beauty!

60
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:28,541
How long do you plan on
staying in bed today, huh?

61
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:30,875
Gimme a kiss.

62
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:34,208
I promise I'll get up,
Rosie. Just kiss me.

63
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,958
Just snap out of it!

64
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,500
[GENE]
All right, all right!

65
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,416
Get outta bed!

66
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,166
Look at you.
It's always the same.

67
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,333
If no one gets on your case,

68
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,791
you just slack off
and stay in bed all day!

69
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,250
[GENE]
So what's the problem?

70
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,208
We don't need to worry about
being attacked right now.

71
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,083
And nothing else
needs to be done.

72
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,750
I'm burned out with all that's
been happening here lately.

73
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,666
So what? So is everybody else!

74
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,375
Come on, there's a ton of
stuff that we need to do.

75
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:03,458
What?

76
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,958
First of all, there's the
maintenance on this cargo hold.

77
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:10,708
If we don't do something soon,
we'll have a problem cooking.

78
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:14,500
Huh? What the hell
happened here, you guys?

79
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,625
We didn't have any time
to secure everything down

80
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,000
when we launched, remember?

81
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,333
And then during
the Grappler fight,

82
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:20,750
everything got totally shook up,

83
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:21,916
so it's a mess.

84
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,458
[GENE]
Oh, man.

85
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:26,041
We also need to sit down and
talk about future developments.

86
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,708
So we can't lie around
in bed all day, Gene!

87
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,375
The future development of what?

88
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:33,500
Starwind and Hawking
Enterprises, of course.

89
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:34,583
Oh yeah?

90
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,166
And what's that?

91
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,708
Oh! Well, good morning, you two.

92
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,500
Good mornin'.

93
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,708
[JIM] So listen,
Heifong's a big place.

94
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,125
Now if we go there,

95
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,416
our trouble with the Kei
Pirates would probably be over.

96
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,375
But I still don't think Heifong
is so full of opportunity

97
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,041
that we're gonna
find a bunch of big jobs

98
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,833
just because we're
looking for 'em.

99
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,666
[GENE]
Mmm. That smells so good.

100
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,208
[JIM]
Would you listen?

101
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,541
Easy there, Jim. You're not
kiddin'; you really are worried.

102
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:08,458
Well of course I am!
Don't you ever get it, Gene?

103
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:09,583
Don't I get what?

104
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,000
Don't give me that!

105
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,583
Look, we've never been to
Heifong, not to mention,

106
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,041
we don't have one
measly connection there.

107
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,500
If we don't start
getting information

108
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,458
and coming up with
some sort of plan,

109
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:22,583
repaying our debts will be the
least of our worries right now!

110
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,041
It'll be all right.

111
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,625
Come on.

112
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:28,000
Besides, what good does it do to
worry about that stuff anyway?

113
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,500
So, have you already decided

114
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:32,208
that we're going on this trip
to Heifong, Gene? Huh?!

115
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,750
And what about the
spaceport fees?

116
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,041
You've always been like this!

117
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,333
If we don't put
our heads together,

118
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:40,208
we'll never repay
that 750 thousand!

119
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:43,208
I hate it that you always leave
everything for the last minute!

120
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:46,041
I mean it Gene, you don't even
know if you're comin' or goin'!

121
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,333
Ah, I don't wanna
hear this. It's so boring.

122
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,250
All we gotta do is pull
off some kinda job.

123
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:51,958
And that's all there is to it.

124
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,541
Then we'll pay back what we owe

125
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,708
and live like kings for
the rest of our lives!

126
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,833
Ah, gimme a break, Gene!

127
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:06,291
Hey, both of you.
Oh, please stop fighting.

128
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,875
[SUZUKA]
What a child.

129
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,166
You'd better watch your pot.

130
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,291
You shouldn't be letting
it boil over like that.

131
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,333
Or all the flavor
will boil away.

132
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,916
Oh. Thanks.

133
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,125
If you wouldn't mind,

134
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,333
I thought I would join
you all for dinner tonight.

135
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,458
Of course!

136
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,458
[JIM]
I don't like this already.

137
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,750
[GENE laughing]

138
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:36,833
[GENE]
Hey did you hear that?

139
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,208
She called you a child.

140
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,750
So keep quiet, little baby,

141
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:42,791
and you eat all your food,
will ya now, huh?

142
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:45,416
[SUZUKA] Actually, I meant
both of you were immature.

143
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,541
Huh?

144
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:53,625
What? Are you talkin' to me?
Are you calling me a child?

145
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,833
Well, what do you think?
Didn't it sound that way to you?

146
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:56,916
Listen, you bitch!

147
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,041
[MELFINA]
Gene.

148
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:58,875
[GENE]
Huh?

149
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,291
Know what?

150
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:03,041
I think that you've been
acting very funny, too, lately.

151
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,291
What, so now you're saying

152
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,166
that everything that's
happening is my fault?

153
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,500
[MELFINA]
No. That's not it.

154
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,791
Yeah, gimme a break.
I've had enough of this.

155
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,750
[MELFINA]
Gene, what about your food?

156
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,250
[GENE]
I don't want it.

157
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:21,708
What're we gonna do
with that lady?

158
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:23,250
She's a real pain in the neck.

159
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:25,333
Lettin' her come with
us is a big mistake.

160
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:27,125
What do you mean?
There's nothing we can do.

161
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,541
Those Kei Pirates are after us,

162
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,208
so for now that's the
way it's gonna be.

163
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,791
We have no choice. We have
to keep her around here.

164
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:35,416
You might be right, but don't
you think if you turn your back,

165
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,750
she's gonna try
and kill you again?

166
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:38,666
Who knows?

167
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,250
Even if she does try something,

168
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,541
she's not stupid enough to try
anything on board the ship.

169
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,083
Look, don't even worry about it.

170
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,791
There you go again, Gene.

171
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,333
Just listen for a minute.

172
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:50,833
There's something that my old
man told me a long time ago.

173
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:53,291
He always said, "People who
think big, make it big.

174
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,083
People who choose
to only think small

175
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,333
will only earn chump change
the rest of their lives.

176
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:58,833
It's the way things are.

177
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:01,500
And that is what
business is all about."

178
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,625
Yeah, so what exactly
is your point?

179
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,291
Well, I don't know.
I guess nothing'.

180
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,291
Well, pardon me for
thinking so small.

181
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,375
You can have your way
about doin' things big

182
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:10,916
and not thinking
things through,

183
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,708
but I think I'll be smart about
it and do it my way instead,

184
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:14,541
ya moron.

185
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:15,708
Hey, what did you just say?!

186
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:17,125
Just forget it.

187
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:19,416
[BOTH]
Hmph.

188
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,458
Gilliam, where
exactly are we now?

189
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:24,750
[GILLIAM] We enter Kozat
Space in 20 light years.

190
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,291
According to Sentinel time,

191
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:30,083
it will take approximately three
more days to reach Heifong.

192
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,708
Three more days, huh...

193
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,166
Hey, Jim!

194
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,958
Would you clean up and do
your own laundry, you pig?!

195
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:38,041
I'm really gettin'
tired of this.

196
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,833
[GILLIAM] We are very lucky
that we haven't been attacked

197
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,333
by pirates so far...

198
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,541
Really? Well, to tell you
the truth, I wish they would

199
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,333
because I could use a little
excitement right about now.

200
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:50,250
[GILLIAM]
Please don't say such things.

201
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,333
What would happen
if they did come?

202
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:55,083
I'd cut loose and
blow 'em all away.

203
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:58,333
Oh!

204
00:10:58,416 --> 00:10:59,750
[GENE]
Oh, hi!

205
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,666
[chuckles, clears throat]

206
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,291
I guess I shouldn't
sit down for a meal

207
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,416
while I'm holding my underwear.

208
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,125
[GILLIAM]
Gene, what are you doing?

209
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,875
Stop that! That's my rail!

210
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,041
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry,
but what else can I do?

211
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,791
I've got nowhere
else to hang 'em.

212
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,583
[GILLIAM]
Why not hang them in the cargo?

213
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:19,875
What's the matter with that?

214
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,583
Well, Jim's hogging
the cargo all to himself.

215
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,458
He won't even let me
use any of it.

216
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,916
[GILLIAM]  Then I must ask you
to do it in your own quarters.

217
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,916
Hanging them on a maintenance
rail is out of the question.

218
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,375
Do I have to sleep with
underwear in my face?

219
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:32,833
[GILLIAM]
Well, they are yours.

220
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,708
This is the kinna stuff
that makes me wanna

221
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,541
get the hell outta here.

222
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:37,750
--[clattering]
--Huh?

223
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:43,875
[JIM]
Hmph!

224
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:46,916
I guess he's still
got a problem.

225
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,125
Well he'd better
learn to get over it.

226
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,750
[groans]

227
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:51,791
[GENE]
Hm?

228
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,333
Gilliam, if I
remember correctly,

229
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,833
you said we were about to enter
Kozat Space, is that right?

230
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,791
[GILLIAM]
Yes, that's absolutely right.

231
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,666
Do you know if there's a
station that's near here

232
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,208
called the Toward Stars Inn?

233
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,208
[GILLIAM]
Yes, Gene, there is.

234
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:04,500
[GENE]
Hmm...

235
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,708
Yeah...

236
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:08,791
Jim!

237
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:13,958
[GENE] What's the matter with
you? Are you still mad at me?

238
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,541
I'm busy. What do you want?

239
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:16,791
Well I--

240
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:24,375
[GENE laughing]

241
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:25,666
[GILLIAM]
I knew it.

242
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,750
I knew that you would
laugh when you saw me.

243
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,500
What's up with this
new color, Gilliam?

244
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,125
Was it your idea to do this?

245
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,333
[JIM]
Gimme that!

246
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,416
No, it was my idea!

247
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,833
[GILLIAM] I keep asking him to
change the color back to blue,

248
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,500
but he won't cooperate.

249
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,458
So why is everybody
making such a big deal?

250
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:42,583
I think it's kinda cute.

251
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,375
[laughing]

252
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:45,750
[GILLIAM]
I suppose.

253
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,625
There's so many of the
other color floatin' around

254
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,750
that it's good to have one
that's different, huh?

255
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,875
[grumbles]

256
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:55,375
Oh, and Melfina's upstairs, so
why don't you go show it to her?

257
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:59,250
If you don't mind, I still
have a lotta work to do.

258
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:02,583
So if you're finished making
fun of me, you can leave now.

259
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,083
[GENE] Well, I thought
I'd stop at a station

260
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,208
to take care
of some business.

261
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:07,750
Did you say a station?

262
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:10,041
I sure I did, and whether
or not you come along

263
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,958
is entirely up to you so...

264
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,583
...just thought I stopped by
a minute to let you know that.

265
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,041
What? You're going?

266
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:18,875
Are you kidding, Gene?
We don't have any money!

267
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,916
Just what do you have
up your sleeve now.

268
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,958
Hey, don't don't get all
worked up about it. Hmph.

269
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:18,583
Okay, smart aleck,
now what're we gonna do?

270
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:21,041
I suppose when we leave,
we're gonna blast our way out.

271
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:22,416
No, we're not doin' it that way.

272
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,833
I don't wanna get on the bad
side of those Ban guys.

273
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,291
It's never stopped you before.

274
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:27,833
Well, we've got
a little problem.

275
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:30,083
You see there's no money in
our pockets right now, right?

276
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,000
Don't tell me.
You're gonna get a job?

277
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,500
Yeah, somethin' like that.

278
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,208
Because if we're going to
Heifong, we'll definitely need

279
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,416
to fatten our wallets
before we get there.

280
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,875
[JIM groans]

281
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,291
I have to leave all of you now

282
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,083
because there's some business
I need to take care of,

283
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,416
but I'll see you at 20 hours.

284
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,625
[ALL]
Huh?

285
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:06,791
First, we gotta eat!

286
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,625
If we're not strong enough,
we'll never be able to work.

287
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:09,750
I'm not kiddin', Gene!

288
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,541
All we have on us
is pocket change.

289
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,166
You are not getting seconds.

290
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,000
Don't worry about it. Just stop
whining and start eating.

291
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,750
Unless you want me
to eat all yours too.

292
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,750
Hey! Don't!

293
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,125
Hey, you're just too slow.

294
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:22,958
Oh yeah?

295
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,125
Watch!

296
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,250
More, Jim?

297
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,125
[JIM]
Uh...

298
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,083
Try these, they're delicious.

299
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:44,083
Aw, man. Thank you, Melfina.

300
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:45,583
[chuckles]

301
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,708
Jim, I'm worried about you.
You're not yourself lately.

302
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,541
Come on now.
Eat some more, okay?

303
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:50,250
Uh.

304
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,583
I would, but I'm, uh...

305
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,166
Man, kids are lucky!

306
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,208
All the ladies kiss up to them
just because they're little.

307
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,291
[growls]

308
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:03,666
[BOTH growling]

309
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,916
Come on.

310
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,416
[GENE]
Huh?

311
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,208
Come on Gene, what do you have
up your sleeve this time?

312
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,750
Let's just get it over with.

313
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:23,958
All right, all right.

314
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,875
If you have to know,
I guess I'll tell you.

315
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:29,000
I heard about this wild story
from our dear friend, Fred.

316
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,208
There's supposed to be a
legend about a wanted man

317
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,750
who lives outside the city.

318
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,500
He's worth ten thousand wong.

319
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,375
Ten thousand won--

320
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,458
I've never seen any
stuff on this guy.

321
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,583
That's 'cause there isn't
any data on this guy,

322
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,375
but everyone around
here knows about him.

323
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:46,916
Come on, are you
sure it's a good idea

324
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,375
to take on a guy like that?

325
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,458
Jim, "If you're gonna do
something, do it big."

326
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:53,375
You know, that's Starwind and
Hawking Enterprises' motto.

327
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,458
That might be your motto,
but it's not mine.

328
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,458
It's the stupidist thing
I've ever heard of.

329
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,666
Okay, that's fine.
Then have it your own way.

330
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,875
Look, suit yourself.

331
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,208
When I get that
ten thousand wong,

332

I'm takin' myself to a
nice restaurant again.

333

You'll be left with just pocket
change and you'll have to eat

at some space take-out
or eat nothing at all.

Are you coming or are you
gonna stay behind?

Mr. Starwind, I don't discuss
my private life with anybody.

For your information, smart guy,

Oh really? I think you're wrong.

You'll have to get behind him

his weak spot,
