00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:24,208
[NARRATOR] The difference
between humans and robots

2
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:25,750
is obvious to anyone.

3
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:26,958
There are clear differences

4
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:29,208
between living and
non-living entities.

5
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:32,208
But what about the differences
between humans and cyborgs?

6
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:33,833
This is not a problem either.

7
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:36,625
A cyborg is someone who
has superhuman abilities

8
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:39,291
due to mechanical systems
that have been incorporated

9
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:40,666
into his body.

10
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,458
But how do we begin to
classify these bio-androids?

11
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:46,083
Actually, this gives rise
to ethical problems

12
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:48,125
that become
progressively complicated.

13
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:50,625
If one were to classify
a bio-android,

14
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:53,125
it would be have to be
thought of as a life form.

15
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:56,375
Because a cyborg is considered
a person, a bio-android,

16
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:58,666
in which machinery is
combined with flesh,

17
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,125
must also be
classified as a person.

18
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:04,166
However, most humans
scoff at such ideas

19
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,125
and insist that these
hybrids life forms

20
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:08,250
can never be regarded as humans.

21
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:11,208
This is because humans
were created by God,

22
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:14,208
but androids were created
solely by humans.

23
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:17,708
Their justification is that we
humans have souls that live on,

24
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:20,500
but androids live only
in the physical plane,

25
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:23,416
without any possibility
of life in the hereafter.

26
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,041
However, the existence
of a creator God,

27
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:29,208
and even the soul for that
matter, has yet to be discovered

28
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:31,375
and proven beyond
a shadow of a doubt

29
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:35,125
by any established organization
within the scientific community.

30
00:01:35,208 --> 00:01:38,708
And so, the classification
of bio-android life forms

31
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:41,041
remains unclear.

32
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:27,083
[PRIEST] Did you like any one
of our paintings in particular?

33
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,833
Oh, I'm so sorry.

34
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:32,375
I guess I kind of took you
by surprise a little there.

35
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:35,750
No. Really, it's my fault
entirely. I'm so sorry.

36
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,583
I shouldn't have come
in without asking.

37
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:40,000
[PRIEST] Oh, I don't mind
at all, my little one.

38
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,500
I consider it a distinct honor
to have another race

39
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,833
visit our Silgrian shrine,
I assure you.

40
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,666
Make yourself right at home.

41
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,541
Oh, now remember, there's
nothing for you to worry about.

42
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:52,666
It's not our place to try
and convert others.

43
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,250
Oh...

44
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,875
Is something troubling
you, young lady?

45
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:00,125
It's just... I don't
understand who I am

46
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,291
or why I was born in this world.

47
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,833
Well! That's a rather
complicated question, isn't it?

48
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:08,416
If you want to talk to someone
about the meaning of existence,

49
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,958
you've come to the right place.

50
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,750
Oh! That's okay!

51
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:12,833
Thanks for the offer,

52
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,583
but I've actually found
someone already

53
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:17,083
who promised that he'd
find the answer for me.

54
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,000
It's just that lately,

55
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,708
I wonder if he's
forgotten his promise

56
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:23,416
or if he's forgotten about me.

57
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,208
If that's what troubling you,
then I'll answer it with a quote

58
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,833
from Silgrian dogma
that fits the occasion.

59
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:31,250
It simply says that, "When
two people have lost faith

60
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,208
in each other,
then all is lost."

61
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:34,916
Do you understand?

62
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:37,416
Yes.

63
00:04:58,708 --> 00:04:59,750
[door opens]

64
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,041
What took so long, Ron?

65
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,083
I guess I kept you
waiting a long time.

66
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,833
I got fed up with all
this waiting around,

67
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,000
and I was deciding
whether I should

68
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,625
just leave without you or not.

69
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,291
Hm. I finally finished
lining up the job.

70
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,833
We can take it now
that we've got you

71
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,541
and your new arm conditioned.

72
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:18,500
You mean...?

73
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,041
[RON]
Yeah.

74
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:21,791
We're gonna pay them a visit
and teach them once and for all

75
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:25,458
what happens to people who mess
with the MacDougall Brothers.

76
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,125
Hey, I'm back!

77
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:29,625
[JIM]
Hey there, Mel!

78
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:30,791
[GENE]
Hey, how much longer?

79
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,125
Will you hold your
horses, Gene?

80
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,458
I found this stupid
piece of crap

81
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,291
at the city garbage dump, okay?

82
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,916
Hey, what're you guys doing?

83
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,791
We just got delivered some
video mail from Clyde today.

84
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:41,000
Who's Clyde?

85
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,041
You know, he's the owner
of our favorite bar,

86
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:46,166
that neighborhood dive we took
you to back on Sentinel III.

87
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,000
We sent him our address here
and we just got a response.

88
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,916
It's all ready, Gene!
I'm gonna play it.

89
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,541
Are you sure that this
thing's recording?

90
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:56,875
Yeah, it's recording.

91
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,083
Gene! Jim! How are
you guys doing?

92
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,666
What a surprise!

93
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,416
We've been so worried since that
ruckus at Virginia Spaceport.

94
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,583
But I never actually
gave up hope.

95
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,500
Anyway, we're both
glad you're okay.

96
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:10,125
[IRIS] So I hear you've set
up shop in Heifong, huh?

97
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,958
Knowing you two, I bet you're
making money hand over fist!

98
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,125
[CLYDE] If you're in Heifong,
you're in a really big city.

99
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,333
There's no comparison between
the scale of business here

100
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:18,750
and a place like that.

101
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:21,000
When you two guys make it big,
stop by and say hello.

102
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,041
We'll be waiting.

103
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,541
Well, you take care now.

104
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,541
We'll send you another
message soon.

105
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:29,000
Hey, this is just like
old times, isn't it?

106
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,958
Yeah, but it's only been
a little over three months

107
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,541
since we left.

108
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,541
[GENE] Man, what I wouldn't give
for one of Clyde's spicy omelets

109
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,166
right about now, you know?

110
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,041
I was just thinkin' about Iris's
homemade custard pudding.

111
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:39,958
[GENE]
Yeah.

112
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,250
Oh well.

113
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,208
[beeping]

114
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,708
Hi!

115
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,416
You've reached the famous
Starwind and Hawking Repair Shop

116
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,875
where we guarantee
to fix anything

117
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:48,958
that can break down
in your life,

118
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,875
from tractors to relationships.

119
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,833
Is it true that
you'll also take jobs

120
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:55,625
that are considered by most
to be a little dangerous?

121
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:58,625
Heh. Well sure, as long as
it's not against the law.

122
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:02,166
It's not exactly illegal,
but it's possibly fatal.

123
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,500
Huh?

124
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,625
Well then, it'll depend
on the pay.

125
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:10,125
Like for starters, sir, could
you give us your full name?

126
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:11,625
My name is irrelevant.

127
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:14,000
I wanna meet so I can
talk to you in person.

128
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:17,041
In that case, feel free to come
on down to our office anytime.

129
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,750
No. I've chosen a
neutral location.

130
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:22,375
There's a restaurant called
Hellenism at Darien Point;

131
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,083
we'll meet there.

132
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,833
I think that you're just a
little confused, my friend!

133
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,833
Come on, you think we'd
be so incredibly stupid

134
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,416
that we'd go down
there on your terms

135
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,083
without discussing either
the job or the pay?

136
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,541
You'll come.

137
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,833
Believe me, it won't seem like
a waste of time at all.

138
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,541
I'd like to take a moment
to discuss with you

139
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,916
the Galactic Leyline.

140
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,541
Huh?

141
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:41,166
[JIM]
Huh?

142
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,166
[MELFINA]
Huh?

143
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,583
Where did you find
out about that?

144
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,625
How could you possibly
get this number?

145
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:46,958
Who are you?

146
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,000
I have a table for two
reserved for five o'clock.

147
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,458
Only one of you will
come into the restaurant.

148
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,750
I'd advise you be
completely unarmed.

149
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:54,875
I'll be waiting.

150
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,333
Hey, hold on there!

151
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:58,666
[GENE]
Ugh!

152
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,708
Were you able to trace it?

153
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,041
Mm, let's see.

154
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:03,166
It was from a public phone
somewhere on J Street.

155
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,708
But I can't tell
who made the call.

156
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:05,708
Sorry.

157
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,750
Well, that's no surprise.

158
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:10,375
Restaurant Hellenism.

159
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:13,791
By car, it'll take you somewhere
around 40 minutes to get there.

160
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,291
Whoa!

161
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:19,000
Gene, it says here that typical
dinners start at 820 wong!

162
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,791
[GENE] This has trap
written all over it.

163
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,041
Think it's the pirates?

164
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,375
Well sure, it's possible,

165
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,708
but that's not exactly
what my gut's tellin' me.

166
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:26,833
Who then?

167
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:28,375
It doesn't really matter.

168
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,041
He mentioned the
Galactic Leyline,

169
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,791
so that means I have to go.

170
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,375
Get the car ready.

171
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:34,875
'Kay, you got it!

172
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,791
Gene, can I go?

173
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,250
[GENE]
Keep an eye on things here.

174
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,500
But, Gene.

175
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:42,708
I want to know too about
the Galactic Leyline!

176
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,041
If the job's on the up and up,

177
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,291
we'll tell you all about it
when we get back.

178
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:49,333
But if it turns into a blood
bath, you'd be better off here.

179
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:50,375
I know, but...

180
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,250
Don't worry, Melfina.

181
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:55,000
We'll come back in one piece,
I promise ya that.

182
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:01,416
[JIM]
Man! This place looks expensive!

183
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,708
Okay, Gene.

184
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,375
If you need me, I'll be on
standing by in the parking lot.

185
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:09,458
[GENE]
Right.

186
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,208
[MAITRE 'D] Your table, sir.
Enjoy your meal.

187
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,541
I knew that you'd
change your mind.

188
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,458
Please, have a seat.

189
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,916
[MAITRE 'D]
Take your time, gentlemen.

190
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,708
Well?

191
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,583
I wanna propose
a deal to you.

192
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:39,875
A deal?

193
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,666
I thought I came here
to discuss a job

194
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,666
that had to do with
the Galactic Leyline.

195
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,208
I wanna know if you would
agree to sell me your ship

196
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:49,083
and the girl that acts
as its control computer.

197
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,916
Sorry, pal. Neither
one of them's for sale.

198
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Huh? Wait a minute.
How do you know about Melfina?

199
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:58,000
I heard about it from
my little brother.

200
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,500
Your little brother? Huh?

201
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:03,625
Are you telling me that you're
the older MacDougall brother?

202
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:04,791
That's right.

203
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,708
I knew you'd catch on quick.

204
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:07,708
You bastard!

205
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,666
The Galactic Leyline.

206
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,958
Now that I've got
your attention,

207
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,291
do you have any idea what it is?

208
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,666
don't know, but I would
imagine your killing Hilda

209
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,833
had something to do with it.

210
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,083
It was nothing personal.

211
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,000
I was just carrying
out a contract.

212
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,416
I just happened to be doing some
checking around afterwards,

213
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,958
and discovered a few stray facts

214
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,500
I think you might find
especially interesting.

215
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:30,625
[GENE] Really? What do
you mean by "facts"?

216
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,500
Start talking!

217
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:35,250
To make the journey to a place
called the Galactic Leyline,

218
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,541
the Kei Pirates needed
a specially equipped ship

219
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,208
and navigation system.

220
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:42,375
The only ship that can make
such a trip is yours: The <i>XGP.</i>

221
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,458
And the only navigation
system precise enough

222
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,250
is the bio-android girl.

223
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,833
[GENE] I know for a fact
Hilda kept that ship a secret!

224
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,750
[RON] That ship wasn't
designed and constructed

225
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,250
by the pirates alone.

226
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,833
It was completed in secrecy
with considerable assistance

227
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,541
from a Space Forces group.

228
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,458
Incidentally, the ship
and the android

229
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,083
were both stolen by Hilda.

230
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:03,625
So you helped out the pirates
and killed Hilda, is that it?

231
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:06,166
No, not at all. The only way
I helped out the pirates

232
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,541
was by finding Hilda.

233
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,958
The actual request
to destroy the <i>XGP</i>

234
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,000
came from the Space Forces,
who were afraid

235
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,375
that their dealings with
the pirates would come out.

236
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:17,625
At the time, they didn't explain
what kind of ship the <i>XGP</i> was

237
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,416
or its capabilities.

238
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,250
But that doesn't change the
fact that you're the one

239
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,208
who killed Hilda.

240
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,125
I'll get to that point.

241
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,708
But before I do,

242
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:29,666
I want the <i>XGP</i> and the
bio-android girl, Melfina.

243
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,708
I'll never give them to a
blood-sucking parasite like you.

244
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:33,875
Have it your way.

245
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,625
But just remember
that if you keep them,

246
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:39,208
they won't be used for
their original purpose.

247
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,750
Then there's just one other
thing that I need to ask you.

248
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,125
Yeah, what is it?

249
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:45,458
Are you the guys who
destroyed a cargo ship

250
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,625
near Sentinel III six years ago?

251
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,000
I gotta know.

252
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,708
Six years ago? Near Sentinel?

253
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,625
I don't remember
anything like that.

254
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,458
Yes, you do, you lying bastard!

255
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:58,583
I saw your ship with
my own two eyes!

256
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:01,375
In that case, I suppose it's
possible I've forgotten.

257
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,875
I've been rather busy
lately in my line of work.

258
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,958
I can't recall every
little job I've done.

259
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,958
[GENE]
You call that a little job?

260
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,625
Let me help you remember.

261
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,083
How 'bout starting
from the beginning

262
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,291
and telling me everything
that you know.

263
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,833
I thought I told you this
afternoon to come unarmed.

264
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:18,416
I didn't have any guarantee
you would be unarmed, did I?

265
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,625
No, I guess you didn't.

266
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:24,083
I think you've
insulted my friends.

267
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:25,666
I hate to disappoint you,

268
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,541
but you're not the only one who
brought along some friends.

269
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:34,833
Come back here!

270
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,541
[RON] These are the latest
Space Forces weapons.

271
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,958
I'm told they're
extremely powerful.

272
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:46,416
You're gonna have to pay me more
than a lousy 20 wong an hour

273
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,958
to take those things on!

274
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,666
I was only interested
in getting involved

275
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,375
because you said the Kei Pirates
were at the bottom of this one.

276
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,083
It so happens that
guy has the key

277
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,125
to the Kei Pirates and
the Galactic Leyline.

278
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,166
The Galactic Leyline?!

279
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:04,625
[banging]

280
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,416
Who is it?

281
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,541
[gasps]

282
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:17,750
Hiya.

283
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:20,083
[gasps] It's you!

284
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,041
[HARRY]
Open up.

285
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,416
[gasps]

286
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,625
Don't be afraid, I just came
to pick you up, Melfina.

287
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,166
Pick me up?

288
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,208
Great, this toy just
isn't gonna cut it!

289
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,250
[JIM]
Hey, Gene!

290
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,000
What the heck's goin'
on around here?

291
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,708
[GENE] Weren't you
listening in on the radio?

292
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:58,041
All I got was noise!
I couldn't hear anything!

293
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,125
I guess they jammed
the system somehow.

294
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,333
This is exactly what he's
been planning all along!

295
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:03,708
Watch my back, Jim, will ya?

296
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:05,041
[JIM]
You got it!

297
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,875
You're all mine!

298
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,125
What the hell?!

299
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,250
I also have the Space Forces'
top-of-the-line light shield

300
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,666
for protection.

301
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,333
Damn it!

302
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,291
Hey, I got him!

303
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,083
You moron! Do you know
how expensive it is

304
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:53,208
to get a hold of those
things, Gene?!

305
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,958
[GENE]
This is not the time!

306
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,083
Unfortunately, your light
shield doesn't cut it

307
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,916
against this thing.

308
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,916
I had no idea
you use a Caster.

309
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,916
[HARRY]
Come on! Open up, Melfina!

310
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,500
Come with me, please.

311
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:13,833
It's for your own good!
Do you hear me?

312
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:23,666
[screaming]

313
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:34,666
[HARRY] Why didn't you
open the damn door?

314
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,041
I came here because of you.

315
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,875
Couldn't you at least
show a little gratitude?

316
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,291
I've seen all of your moves.

317
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,000
I suggest you
save your strength.

318
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:49,625
[yelling]

319
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:50,625
Stay outta this.

320
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,750
I don't have any
business with you!

321
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,541
[SUZUKA] Now tell us
about the Kei Pirates...

322
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,541
[AISHA] And the mystery
of the Galactic Leyline...

323
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,208
Why don't you just tell us
everything you know?

324
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,708
[chuckles] Sorry,
I don't think so.

325
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:09,875
What the hell?

326
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,500
Ya know, Casters have
earned the reputation

327
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:14,791
of being exceptionally effective
against the Tao masters

328
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,000
because they're based on

329
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,458
a totally different
technological system.

330
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,333
This could get ugly...

331
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:24,583
Two weapons that are using
the same technological system

332
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:27,208
can defend against each other.

333
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:28,666
That's a Caster!

334
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,916
Right! And therefore,
we cancel each other out.

335
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,000
[GENE]
This is not good.

336
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,791
I'm gonna run outta
shells before he does.

337
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,291
What's the matter?

338
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,750
You can't run off! I'm not
finished playing with you yet.

339
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,250
Ah, you wanna play?!

340
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:54,291
Huh?

341
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,250
[GENE]
Getting outta here now!

342
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,708
Where are you going?

343
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:04,458
Come on! They're after the
<i>Outlaw Star</i> and Melfina!

344
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,166
-- [GENE] What?
--[AISHA, SUZUKA] Huh?

345
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,375
My little brother Harry's
quite taken with Melfina.

346
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:11,583
[GENE]
Hurry up, Jim!

347
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,291
[JIM]
You got it!

348
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:16,541
It's 30 minute to the spaceport
no matter how fast they go.

349
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,958
They'll never make it in time.

350
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,875
Hey, wait a minute!

351
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,041
[AISHA]
Hey!

352
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,666
Come back here and
tell me what you know

353
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,291
about the Galactic Leyline!

354
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:31,375
Tell me what's the matter,
Little Red Riding Hood.

355
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm not gonna eat you.

356
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,708
No, don't! Stay away!

357
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,625
Why are you running away?!

358
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,083
I didn't mean to
do that, Melfina.

359
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:48,208
I'm sorry. I promise
I'm not going to hurt you.

360
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,041
After all, when it really
comes down to it,

361
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,208
we're one and the same.

362
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:52,958
What do you mean the same?

363
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,541
Yeah, you and I, Melfina.

364
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,833
Both of us,
we're really Constructs.

365
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:59,333
Constructs? You're one too?

366
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:00,458
Yes, that's right.

367
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:01,791
I was born in a test tube,

368
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:04,375
a human organism made from
synthetic protoplasm.

369
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,125
I was based on
someone else's genes,

370
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,041
but I don't have any parents.

371
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,666
I'm a Construct.

372
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,583
It was just the same
with you, right?

373
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,625
Tell me everything you remember.

374
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:14,791
I don't know.

375
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,500
I can't remember
anything like that at all.

376
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:18,833
You've got to remember!

377
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,541
Listen to me, we're
exactly the same.

378
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:23,833
We're Constructs with greater
abilities than any mere humans.

379
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:26,625
Nothing good can ever come from
staying with normal people.

380
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:30,125
Come on. Come with me.
We'll look out for each other.

381
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,083
Come on.

382
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:37,250
Hey, you can trust me.

383
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,375
No!

384
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:39,541
[growls]

385
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,791
Why can't I make
you understand?!

386
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,833
I feel so sorry for you.

387
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:54,750
All these horrible things
have happened to you.

388
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,666
But you can relax now.

389
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,666
I'll protect you,
don't you worry about it.

390
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,541
[screams]

391
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:02,708
[gasps]

392
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,208
Gilliam, help!
Open up the hatch!

393
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,500
[GILLIAM] What in the
world is the matter?

394
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,000
[yelling]

395
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,083
[GILLIAM yelps]

396
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,875
Open up! Dammit! Open up!

397
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:16,083
[GILLIAM]
I'm terribly sorry,

398
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,375
but you do not have
the captain's permission

399
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:18,416
to come aboard.

400
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,666
I don't need
anybody's permission.

401
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,458
[chuckling]

402
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:28,750
[MELFINA whimpering]

403
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,166
[GILLIAM] Melfina, could you
possibly give me a hand here?

404
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,083
The intruder that has been
pursuing you is trying

405
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:36,166
to penetrate my protection
from outside somehow.

406
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,750
If something isn't done soon,

407
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,375
he'll be able to
open up the hatch.

408
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,208
Yes, of course.

409
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,541
--[beeping]
--Ah.

410
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:52,666
[alarm blaring]

411
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,625
[HARRY]
There you are!

412
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,166
I've been looking forward
to meeting you like this.

413
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,500
Now do you believe me, Melfina?

414
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:03,958
Stop it! Stay away from me!

415
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,500
[HARRY]
Why are you running away?

416
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:09,000
Why don't you come away with me?

417
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,875
There's no reason to
turn me down, right?

418
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,708
I'm the only one who
can see you like this.

419
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,458
You know it's true, Melfina.

420
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,458
[MELFINA]
Stay away! Stay away!

421
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,625
Hiding in there won't
do you any good.

422
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:25,250
[MELFINA whimpering]

423
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:28,458
The truth is, you understand
everything I've said, don't you?

424
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,916
Stay away. Stay away.

425
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,750
There's no place for us around
normal humans anymore.

426
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:38,041
Haven't you ever felt
left out, unwanted?

427
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,291
Come along with me, Melfina.

428
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:44,416
You and I belong together,
joined as one forever.

429
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,875
No!

430
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:56,500
Why?! Why don't you
do what I say?!

431
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:59,583
What is it? What's your
problem?! What's wrong?

432
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:02,541
Ah! Stop moving
around by yourself!

433
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:03,208
[beeping]

434
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:04,583
[RON]
Harry!

435
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,666
They're on their way.
They'll be coming back soon.

436
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:10,208
Were you able to get the <i>XGP</i> and
the android like we discussed?

437
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,500
[HARRY] Why doesn't anyone
do what I tell him to do?!

438
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:15,041
That bitch! My arm's
freaking out!

439
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,791
You mean you blew it?!
Get outta there now, Harry!

440
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,458
[HARRY]
Ah, you son of a bitch!

441
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:20,291
[RON]
Hm?

442
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:26,458
[panting]

443
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,291
Ya hear me? Don't you forget!

444
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,250
It's Harry MacDougall
you're dealing with!

445
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:33,000
I'll catch up to you.
You can count on it!

446
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,416
[GENE]
Melfina! Are you okay?

447
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,916
[GILLIAM]
Don't worry, Gene.

448
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,125
An intruder tried to break
into the main control room

449
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:53,500
of the <i>Outlaw Star</i> , but
through the valiant efforts

450
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:56,375
of Melfina and myself,
we drove them off.

451
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:59,875
Are you sure that
you're okay, Melfina?

452
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:01,375
Yeah, sure.

453
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:03,083
I'm really feeling fine, Jim.

454
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:06,333
Thank goodness. We were
really worried there.

455
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:11,833
[GENE] The MacDougall Brothers
are on their way after us.

456
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:13,333
Believe me,
they'll stop at nothing

457
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,958
until they get the
<i>Outlaw Star</i> and Melfina.

458
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:18,083
I don't think that I can take
too much more of this.

459
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:19,833
Well, if you can't take
too much more of this,

460
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:21,250
what do you plan we do?

461
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:23,041
[GENE]
Good question.

462
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:24,250
[JIM]
What's this?

463
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:26,250
It's a message for Mel.

464
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:30,416
Hi, Melfina. So tell me
how you've been.

465
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,458
Have you been well?
Do you remember me?

466
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:35,083
It's your friend, Gwen Khan.

467
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:37,416
Hey! It's that old geezer!

468
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,458
By the way, what're you
still doing on Heifong?

469
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:43,208
Aren't you going to go look
for the Galactic Leyline?

470
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:45,708
And he's talkin' about
the Galactic Leylie too.

471
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:48,208
You have the <i>XGP</i> , but
you still haven't left yet?

472
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:50,791
Could it be that you don't
have any information?

473
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:53,583
I see, that must
be it. Right, right.

474
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:56,208
I've been checking into
things on my end too,

475
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,083
but I haven't uncovered
many clues yet.

476
00:22:58,166 --> 00:23:00,583
Yes, yes. I see, I see.

477
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:02,458
Well, I'll contact you again.

478
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:05,458
I'll be in touch if I
find anything further.

479
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,291
That guy still doesn't
make any sense to me.

480
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:10,416
I know, me either.

481
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,291
But I just figured
something else out.

482
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:13,625
What's that?

483
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:15,833
That we really have
no other choice.

484
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:20,166
We have to go to the Galactic
Leyline at once and end this.

485
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:36,458
[MELFINA] I can't help but
wonder who he really was anyway.

486
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:43,708
And... And who am I?

487
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:20,583
[GENE] With all of my knowledge
and experience with women,

488
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:23,291
handing out advice about
them is a specialty of mine.

489
00:25:23,375 --> 00:25:25,625
Fred, in your case,
your lack of success

490
00:25:25,708 --> 00:25:27,833
is simply because your body
isn't developed enough

491
00:25:27,916 --> 00:25:29,625
to interest any of these ladies.

492
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:32,125
Just take a close look
at their powerful bodies

493
00:25:32,208 --> 00:25:34,625
as they face each other in
the ring; they're incredible!

494
00:25:34,708 --> 00:25:36,541
There's a battle
going on between the sexes

495
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:38,291
and you've got
front row seats!

496
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:40,708
See it all next time
on <i>Outlaw Star</i> .

497
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:42,708
Gene Starwind faces off with

498
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,583
"The Strongest Woman
in the Universe"!

499
00:25:44,666 --> 00:25:46,041
You better get ready!
