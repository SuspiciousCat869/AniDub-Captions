00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,791
Hey, don't get all
serious on me.

166
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,000

Hey Gene, it's almost noon!

00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,833
Get outta bed and give
me a hand down here!

[GENE groans]

172
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,166
We've got that
tractor repair job

173
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,791
waiting for us this afternoon;
we gotta get done for Henry.

[GENE yawns]

175
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,083
A job for 150 wongs?

176
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:28,375
I can't get myself outta bed
for something that small...

177
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,833
When did you finally
get back last night?

178
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,458
[GENE]
Five, this morning.

179
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:36,541
You probably haven't heard
yet, so I'd better tell ya.

180
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:39,125
That ship that came down,
the one last night.

181
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:40,833
It was a pirate ship.

182
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,125
Pirate?

183
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,791
I don't know what
organization they were with.

184
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,666
[grunts] C'mon!

00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,833
[groans]

186
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,625
What about quarantine?

187
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:55,083
[JIM] The Space Forces
don't come out here.

188
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,583
So, you just need
to grease some palms.

189
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,750
But I don't get it, what is
it that they could possibly

190
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,875
be interested in
here on Sentinel?

191
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,083
I don't know, Gene, you're
asking the wrong guy.

--[phone rings]

Hello, you've reached Hawking

195
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,500
from Starwind and
Hawking Repairs.

196

We fix everything from
tractors to relationships.

197
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,166
So how can we help you today?

198
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,083
[RACHEL]
I have a job for you.

199
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,375
Okey, dokey.

200
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,333
Could you give me
the particulars?

201
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:28,666
Let's see, if it's not any
trouble, I'd like to order

202
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,625
a few specials parts and
I'd also like a bodyguard.

203
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,375
I see...

204
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:34,708
Very well then.

205
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,041
And your name, lady?

206
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,375
My name's Rachel.

207
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,041
And thank you.

208
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,291
[GENE]
Well?

209
00:13:56,375 --> 00:14:00,083
Gosh, Gene... That lady asked
for some real serious hardware.

210
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,375
Hey, Jim, she's a customer.

211
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,000
And a real babe.

212
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,208
Women'll be the
death of you someday.

213
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,166
Right, I can't forget
to include that

214
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,625
in my plan for an ideal life.

215
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:15,625
Hey, she gave you money to
order the parts, didn't she?

216
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,958
[JIM] Mm-hm, it's been
deposited in our account.

217
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,583
But it's stuff
like bio-elements,

218
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:22,166
organic system parts,
and some nanotech.

219
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,125
You know, this stuff
is hard to get, Gene.

220
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,625
And it's real expensive.

221
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:29,500
Makes me wanna know
what she needs 'em for.

222
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:30,916
You check her ID?

223
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,166
All green.

224
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,541
Appears to be safe.

225
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,500
[GENE]
Hm...

226
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,750
Well, okay.

227
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,000
I guess, I'll just have
to go meet our Miss Safe

228
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,541
and see how safe she really is.

229
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:44,375
Why do you think Miss Safe
would need a bodyguard?

230
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:47,125
Here. I've input
all the data for ya.

231
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,375
Take it!

232
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:49,833
[GENE] I'll see you at
the usual place, then.

233
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,333
[JIM]
Hm, 'kay.

234
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,333
That's right, buddy, I'd be
happy to pour you another

235
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,250
when you finish the first one.

236
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,125
I hate how we always
get these animals

237
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,916
after Gene gets into a fight.

238
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,833
Now, don't be like that.

239
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:06,958
We're pulling in
money because of it.

240
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,250
Oh, I hate him. Look at him.

that girl over there.

For me.

246
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,250
I didn't know that this
place could be so dangerous

247
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,541
for the inexperienced,
like myself.

248

This is your first
time to Locus?

You sightseein'?

Heh, well there's
nothin' to see.

It's my job.

252
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,208
It's for my father.

253
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,208
So, how long would you say
you need a bodyguard for?

254
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:35,916
I'd need you to start right now,

255
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,541
until I leave the area
and my job is done.

256
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:42,958
It'll be 800 a day,
plus any expenses.

257
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,625
Very well, then.

258
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:47,166
Okay, we have ourselves a deal.

259
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,541
With you around, Gene,

260
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:54,000
I think my job will be
much more pleasant.

261

[GENE]
What's taking Jim so long?

262

I'm sorry. He should
be here by now.

[RACHEL]
That's all right.

264
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,083
Where are we headed, anyway?

265
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:06,458
To an agri-plant that's located
30 kilometers to the northeast.

266
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,875
What?! That's out in the
middle of the wheat fields!

267
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,750
Uh-huh. I have to do
some major repairs

that's out there.

feeling about this...

check it over before you left?!

295

You don't restore
a classic like this

and then drive it
all over the place!

Maybe I was just being paranoid.

298

This job seems simpler
than I thought it was.

299
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,833
Maybe those guys
who attacked you

300
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:00,083
just thought you
were somebody else.

301

Those guys had "Pirate Guild"
written all over 'em.

302

There's no way that
pirates would be after

You know what, Gene?

305

If you take the next off-ramp,

306
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,625
it's a straight shot
the rest of the way.

00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,625
Rachel is purely
a fictitious name.

326
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:32,750
The part about me needing a
bodyguard, however, is real.

327
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:35,416
Okay, so your real
name is Hilda.

328
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,166
Why are those pirates after you?

329
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,625
I'm their enemy.

330
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,625
We're after the same treasure.

331
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:41,875
Treasure?!

332
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,458
This is bad news, Gene!
Let's get outta here!

333
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:47,958
You don't actually think that
they'll let us go now, do you?!

334
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:49,458
Here they come.

335
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,125
[JIM]
What the hell was that?!

336
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,291
[GENE]
They're using Tao magic.

337
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:54,916
Hilda, take the wheel!

338
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:58,708
Jim! Short-barrel blaster!

339
00:19:58,791 --> 00:19:59,791
[JIM]
Got it!

340
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,291
--[JIM laughs]
--How ya like that?

341
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:09,250
[NOPPO chants]

342
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,458
[BOTH gasp]

343
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,291
--[NOPPO chants]
--[GENE] Dodge it!

344
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:17,791
Bastard!

345
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,958
[yells]

346
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,500
Let's rock!

347
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:26,833
[NOPPO chants]

348
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,541
--[GENE gasps]
--No way...

349
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:31,000
[laughs]

350
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,500
[chanting]

351
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:33,958
Jim! Give me a Number 3!

352
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,125
[JIM] We've only got one
of those bullets left!

353
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,750
Just give it to me!

354
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:40,958
A Caster?

355
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,125
Eat this...

356
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:46,250
...bastard!

357
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,833
[screams]

358
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,541
[gasps]

359
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,208
They've been killed.

360
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:01,583
It seems that we have
underestimated our opponents.

361
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,833
[GENE] So this is where
you hid the treasure.

362
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,708
Mission completed!

363
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:08,875
[HILDA]
Thank you.

364
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,833
I appreciate what you've done.

365
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:11,875
[groans]

366
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,083
[GENE groaning]

367
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:18,333
Oh god, Gene!

368
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:19,791
Hold it!

369
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:22,291
I still have some
work for you to do.

370
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:31,625
[HILDA]
Okay.

371
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,375
Pull out that trunk.

372
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,291
[HILDA]
Load it into the car.

373
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,958
[GENE] Tell me, Hilda,
what's in the trunk?

374
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,958
--How did you...?
--[JIM] Gene!

375
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,166
Sorry there, buddy.

376
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,958
But it looks like we
gonna hafta write off

377
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:46,041
your personal assistant.

378
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,916
Shall we see what's in there?

379
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,208
[JIM grunts]

380
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:51,166
--[beeping]
--[JIM] It's an electronic lock!

381
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,791
I need the code number!

382
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:53,958
What is it, Hilda?

383
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:57,083
It's not your best
interest to open that.

384
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,583
What's the code?

385
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,791
VSDO2C.

386
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:06,000
[JIM]
Okay, that did it!

387
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,458
Gene! Look at that!

388
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:12,458
Huh?

389
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:15,750
Wh-What the hell? What is it?

390
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:57,333
[GENE]
Aw, man!

391
00:23:57,416 --> 00:23:59,666
First, a naked
girl comes out of a trunk,

392
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,833
and then those pirates
come after us again!

393
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:03,916
What the hell is going on here?

394
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,875
Well, I aim to find out.

395
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:08,083
'Cause there's no
turning back now.

396
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:10,541
I'm going back into
space once again.

397
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:15,041
In the next episode, "World
of Desires," on <i>Outlaw Star</i> .

398
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:18,750
[GENE] So, everyone,
you'd better get ready!
