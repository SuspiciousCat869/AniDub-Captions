1
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:20,333
[NARRATOR] With the development
of the Munchhausen Drive,

2
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:23,458
which made faster-than-light
space travel possible,

3
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:27,416
humanity entered into a
new era of great odysseys.

4
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,083
They set out into the universe,
into this infinite sea.

5
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:34,416
Explorers, soldiers,
colonists...

6
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,708
...all sorts of travelers
with all sorts of names,

7
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:39,833
crossed the sea of
stars and spread out

8
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:42,583
across all sorts of worlds.

9
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,791
But when law and
order were created,

10
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:47,291
those who disturbed it,
appeared.

11
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:49,375
And when wealth and
interest were made,

12
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:52,500
those who would plunder
them, appeared.

13
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:55,375
Just as in the last
great age of sailing,

14
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:58,166
pirates were
reborn in space.

15
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,750
But in this new
age of odysseys,

16
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:05,333
a new breed of sailors appeared
who worked outside the law, yet,

17
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:10,625
sided with neither space
pirate nor Space Forces.

18
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:12,083
Outlaws.

19
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:14,833
This was the name given to
those who traveled space

20
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:18,250
with only his freedom
as his guide.

21
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:58,291
Well, well, well, here he is.

22
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,750
You have gotta be kiddin' me.

23
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:06,875
Hold it!

24
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:08,750
Hey! Don't worry.

25
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,458
[GENE]
They're just paint bullets.

26
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,916
But, not normal ones, heh.

27
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:22,291
[OUTLAW A groaning]

28
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,458
[laughs]

29
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,000
That won't take it off!

30
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,291
Ya can't see a damn
thing, can ya?!

31
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,583
[OUTLAW A]
You asked for it, kid!

32
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:34,250
Better say your prayers!

33
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:35,500
Damn kid.

34
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,583
All right!

35
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,458
I'll getcha, now!

36
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:42,208
[laughs]

37
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,375
[OUTLAW A]
You're history, that's it!

38
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,250
You're all mine!

39
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,958
[screaming]

40
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:49,541
[groans]

41
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,208
Huh?

42
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:59,708
So, you've got a lot of tricks
up your sleeve, I see.

43
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:01,875
Hey, I don't think these
guys were after you

44
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:04,375
just because of what
you did back at the bar.

45
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:05,708
Well, looks like...

46
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,583
...just about everybody's
after you.

47
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:11,291
[thud, groaning]

48
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:14,583
Okay, so tell me, what the
hell do you want with me?

49
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:15,583
[groaning]

50
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,166
I don't know, I tell ya...!

51
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,791
Com'on, I don't know anything!

52
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:22,708
But you know my
reputation, right?

53
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,375
[OUTLAW B]
Uh... Someone asked us to do it!

54
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,125
They told us we
could capture you

55
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,791
or we could just keep you here!

56
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:31,041
Gonna tell me who?

57
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,500
Somebody even worse than me?

58
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:34,541
[gasps]

59
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:40,916
[sighs] It's Ron MacDougall.

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,166
MacDougall?

61
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,166
Why him?

62
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,916
I don't know, we just did it.

63
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,458
Cause he offered to
pay us a lot of money.

64
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,125
[HILDA]
I see...

65
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,875
[OUTLAW B groaning]

66
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,458
[HILDA]
Wake up Melfina and Jim.

67
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:53,916
We're going to the dock.

68
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,625
So, who's this MacDougall guy?

69
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,041
[HILDA]
I'll explain later.

70
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,791
[GENE]
Hmm... I've heard that before.

71
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:08,333
[MIKEY]
Okay!

72
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:10,291
That's the last of 'em.

73
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:13,041
[SWANZO] Looks like you guys
made it here in one piece.

74
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,833
[HILDA]
Sorry about the trouble.

75
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,375
[SWANZO chuckles]
Don't mention it.

76
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,208
We go back a long way.

77
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,500
I wouldn't mind knowing what
they were up to, though.

78
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:24,041
Looks like MacDougall
put them up to it.

79
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:27,000
Oh! So, he's goin' all-out, huh?

80
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,541
What have you got
yourself mixed up in?

81
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,625
Well, it's nothing major.

82
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,291
It's the Galactic Leyline.

83
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,000
[SWANZO]
The Galactic Leyline?!

84
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:38,083
I'll never understand
how you Terans think.

85
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:39,750
You really believe
in that stuff?

86
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:42,750
Actually, no, Swanzo,
I don't believe anything

87
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,833
until I see it with my own eyes.

88
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,333
How's Horus, doing?

89
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:48,208
[SWANZO]
I've finished with the supplies.

90
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:49,583
How are the engines, Mikey?

91
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,125
[MIKEY]
All green.

92
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,833
Except, you've got less than 50
parsecs left until your next

93
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:56,333
recommended overhaul on
your Sub-ether Drive.

94
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,375
The manufacturer's too paranoid.

95
00:05:58,458 --> 00:05:59,875
We're launching right away.

96
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,333
[GENE]
Hey hold it!

97
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:03,166
You mean we're just gonna
launch now, just like that?

98
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,916
[SWANZO]
That's probably a good idea.

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,500
There's a big ruckus
over at Dock 12.

100
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:10,333
Maybe their buddies are
sending out some ships.

101
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:11,541
[GENE growls]

102
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:12,875
What, are you out of your mind?

103
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,083
Starting a fight right
outside Blue Heaven?

104
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,000
[SWANZO]
They're breaking the rules

105
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,500
if they don't go hand-to-hand.

106
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,208
And Horus is too big for them.

107
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:20,666
It's like [gibberish]

108
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,666
[GENE]
Hm?! Whadchu just say?

109
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,041
[SWANZO]
Uh. Sorry, translator glitch.

110
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,625
I mean, "Sharks ganging
up on a whale."

111
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:27,666
Ha! Whatever.

112
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,416
I've never even seen
a whale before.

113
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,958
[HILDA]
Swanzo,

114
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,208
thank you for everything, I'll
be back soon and understand,

115
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,000
I will need your help again.

116
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,708
I'll have a new ship with me...

117
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:39,000
[SWANZO]
No problem, Hilda.

118
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,625
[HILDA]
Okay, let's get going!

119
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:07,375
[HORUS] Five class-C Grappler
Ships have launched

120
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,875
from Blue Heaven
and are closing in.

121
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,000
Gene!

122
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,125
Hey, Gene!

123
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:13,416
Huh? What is it?

124
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,625
[HILDA] You ever fought
in a space ship before?

125
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,833
No. Even if I did,
I don't want to now.

126
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:20,208
I thought you had some
experience as a pilot.

127
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:21,291
[GENE]
I do!

128
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:22,916
But I might puke
all over the console.

129
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,791
[HORUS]
Warning.

130
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,208
That may cause a short-circuit.

131
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,666
If you don't have a problem
with it, I'll help.

132
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,375
[HILDA]
Can you operate a laser cannon?

133
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,208
Sure, I know how to use one.

134
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:32,666
[HILDA]
It's to your right.

135
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,750
If they close in, open fire!

136
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,125
[JIM]
Okay!

137
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:38,791
[GENE]
Uh?

138
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,333
[grunts]

139
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:42,458
[HILDA]
Melfina!

140
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:43,708
[gasps] Huh?

141
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,541
Sit in the auxiliary
control chair.

142
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:46,625
You're able to do it.

143
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:49,125
All right. I'll try.

144
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,041
[HORUS]
Warning.

145
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,083
Please avoid any reckless
evasive maneuvers

146
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:57,333
until we are out of Blue
Heaven's approach lanes.

147
00:07:57,416 --> 00:08:00,083
All right, continue
accelerating.

148
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,625
They won't get away!
Let's split ourselves up!

149
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:06,791
[RADIO OUTLAW]
Right!

150
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,125
Those bastards messed with us,

151
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,166
and now it's time
for some payback!

152
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,208
[HORUS] Grappler Ships to aft
have split into two groups.

153
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,291
Jim, eyes up, they're
coming in from the rear!

154
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,625
[JIM]
Gotcha!

155
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,125
There they are!

156
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,958
Ain't gonna work, little lady!

157
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,583
[HORUS] Enemy craft have
anti-laser defenses.

158
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,458
Uh! Hilda, what're we gonna do?

159
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,833
[HILDA] Keep firing. It'll keep
them on their toes, at least.

160
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,125
Okay!

161
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:54,583
[laughs] Runnin' out of time!

162
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,458
[HORUS]
Further evasion is dangerous.

163
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,250
Now leaving guide path.

164
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,750
Grappler Ship closing
in from above!

165
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:07,750
Okay, lady!
Got ya this time!

166
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:17,125
Horus, we need a rapid climb!

167
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,875
[retches]

168
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:24,958
Aw, shit!

169
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,958
How much longer till we're
clear of the asteroid zone?

170
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,208
[HORUS]
482 seconds.

171
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,625
[groaning]

172
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:47,708
I see something that's
closing in on us ahead!

173
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:48,833
It's a large ship!

174
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,541
[HORUS]
Ship is cruiser-class.

175
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:53,375
Type, unknown. It is
on a collision course.

176
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:54,625
Send out a warning.

177
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:57,166
[HORUS] They claim they
have the right of way.

178
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,083
[AISHA]
This is the <i>Orta Honehone</i> ,

179
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:11,083
registered to the
Ctarl-Ctarl Empire.

180
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,625
I am speaking to you as

181
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,416
Ambassador Plenipotentiary
Aisha Clanclan,

182
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,458
with total authority
in all space held

183
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,208
by the Ctarl-Ctarl Empire!

184
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,916
We are docking at Blue
Heaven! Clear the way!

185
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,541
[CTARL CREW shouting]

186
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:29,875
[CTARL CREW]
Clear the way! Clear the way!

187
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:32,625
[CTARL A] Make way for
the Ctarl-Ctarl Empire!

188
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:36,125
[CTARL B] If you don't clear the
way, we're gonna whip your ass!

189
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:38,125
[OUTLAW C]
The Ctarl-Ctarl Empire?!

190
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:39,833
[OUTLAW B]
What should we do?

191
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,500
Like we really have a choice?

192
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:44,375
These guys are even
worse than pirates!

193
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:49,208
Listen, I'm an Outlaw.
I hate to say it,

194
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,416
but I don't have a treaty
with you, understand?

195
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,750
This departing ship is
taking the right of way.

196
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:56,750
Huh?! You're picking a fight
with the Ctarl-Ctarl?!

197
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:59,750
Hey, Jim, tell me, what're
the Ctarl-Ctarl like, again?

198
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,416
[JIM] They're like a cross
between a human and a tiger.

199
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,875
They're real nasty.

200
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,500
[CTARL C] Approaching ship
isn't changing course!

201
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,333
Wait! Wait a minute!
That's crazy!

202
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,541
[CTARL A]
Stop screwin' around!

203
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:13,666
[CTARL D]
Morons!

204
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,541
[CTARL E]
We're gonna eat you!

205
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:16,541
Don't you worry.

206
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:17,833
If you drop your shields,

207
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:19,750
there'll be enough
room for us to pass.

208
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:20,916
What?! Uh!

209
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,333
You defy the Ctarl-Ctarl
Empire?! [growls]

210
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,583
[CTARL A] If we don't do
something, we'll collide!

211
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,583
What?! Dodge them, idiots!

212
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:30,458
Dropping shields! Altering
course three degrees to port!

213
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:33,583
Firing starboard thrusters
for 10 seconds!

214
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:49,916
[whimpering]

215
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:11,458
[screaming]

216
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,041
Oh, boy.

217
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,416
Kay, go after 'em!

218
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,041
[AISHA]
Hey! Hold it right there!

219
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,625
All of you, stop your
ships, do you hear me?!

220
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:33,208
You're under arrest in the
name of Ctarl-Ctarl Empire!

221
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:34,583
[OUTLAW B]
Oh, no! What should we do?

222
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:35,625
[OUTLAW C]
What else can we do?!

223
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,625
We can't get away
from this ship!

224
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,458
[AISHA]
Hey! You, too, Outlaw!

225
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,750
Hold it!

226
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:45,666
[HORUS] T-minus-60 until
asteroid zone is cleared.

227
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,666
Warning...

228
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,625
Warning.

229
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:53,833
Further acceleration within
asteroid zone is dangerous.

230
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,083
[AISHA growling]

231
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,458
Damn it! 'Everyone's trying
to make fools of us!

232
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:00,750
That does it! Fire!

233
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,041
I said fire!

234
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:05,166
[CTARL CREW]
Fire! Fire! Fire!

235
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,333
[COUNSELOR]
But Lady Aisha,

236
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,083
firing within the
asteroid cluster is--

237
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,291
[AISHA growling]
Quiet!

238
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,791
This is in honor of
the Ctarl-Ctarl!

239
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,125
Y-Yes, ma'am.

240
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:20,250
[CTARL CREW]
Fire! Fire! Fire!

241
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:33,333
[growling]

242
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:34,250
[CTARL PILOT]
Lady Aisha blew it.

243
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,375
She should've listened to 'im.

244
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:42,625
So, Hilda, where are we
headed off to this time?

245
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:44,083
Just a little star system.

246
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,833
Meeting up with
some friends there.

247
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,875
[AISHA]
What?!

248
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:13,041
You mean, the Outlaw, Hilda!
That was her ship?!

249
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,416
Wow, Hilda's famous,
even in the empire.

250
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,500
She sure is.

251
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,250
Tell me where's she's headed!

252
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,125
Even if I knew I
wouldn't tell ya!

253
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,041
[BOTH growling]

254
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:25,125
These Outlaws will face
execution later!

255
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,625
Go after her at once!

256
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:27,833
But, we can't!

257
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:31,333
What are you saying?
Are you defying me?!

258
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,333
They are official
orders from home.

259
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,875
We are to remain here
until further instructed.

260
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:39,291
What? You mean to tell me you've
been in contact with home?

261
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,750
Of course, we were
ordered to contact them

262
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,375
once we had arrived
at Blue Heaven.

263
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:47,416
[AISHA screams]

264
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,041
Oh, God, are we there yet?

265
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,291
[HILDA]
No.

266
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,083
We have to go to sub-ether
three more times.

267
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,333
Argh!

268
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,000
[HORUS] Time required
to next sub-ether drive:

269
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,333
2 hours 10 minutes.

270
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:03,916
Get some rest, everyone.

271
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,083
Before I rest,
I have a question.

272
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,416
What the heck's
the Galactic Leyline?

273
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,916
That's simple,

274
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,250
it's a place that the Kei
Pirates are desperate to find.

275
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:13,708
[GENE]
Why?

276
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,500
Apparently, they say there's
some kind of huge treasure

277
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,041
that's suppose to
be hidden there.

278
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,416
One other thing.

279
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,083
Who's this MacDougall character?

280
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,041
Horus.

281
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,625
[HORUS]
The MacDougall Brothers.

282
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,916
They call themselves Outlaws,
but their position is unclear.

283
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,208
They will take any job from
anyone for the right price.

284
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:31,458
Other than that, no personal
information is available.

285
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,833
Why the hell are they pokin'
around your business?

286
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,958
Why don'tcha just ask 'em.

287
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,208
Hey, I gotta an idea,

288
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,041
this ship oughta have
some sleeping quarters.

289
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,583
Why don't you and I just
talk it over in bed.

290
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:42,541
Heh!

291
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,333
Would I get anything out of it?

292
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:45,416
Huh?!

293
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,500
[HILDA]
A cherry isn't worth my time.

294
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,083
I ain't a cherry!

295
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,333
[groaning]

296
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,500
Land this thing, I'll
show you whose a che--

297
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:56,833
Man, grown-ups and their
sleazy conversations...

298
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,875
Oh, you can't perform?

299
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,750
[BOTH]
Huh?!

300
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,791
Oh, sorry you can't perform.

301
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:05,041
That's too bad.

302
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,250
[BOTH]
Hm...?

303
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:12,416
[laughing]

304
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,708
The moon of that planet...

305
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,916
That's where we'll
meet my friends.

306
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:26,458
This is Horus.

307
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:29,666
Marx, O'Malley, come in, please.

308
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:31,666
[HILDA]
Anything on radar?

309
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,041
No. I'm not picking
up any spaceships.

310
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:37,000
Did you get here at the right
time, maybe we're just early?

311
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,333
They should've come
a long time ago.

312
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,750
[GENE]
You think you got stood up?

313
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,125
I doubt that.

314
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:45,375
I'm picking up something
on radar, but it's...

315
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,958
[HORUS] I'm picking it up
on the cameras, as well.

316
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,500
Enlarging.

317
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,750
I'm taking us in.

318
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,333
Oh, no.

Debris ahead verified

as the Leprechaun
and the Purgatory.

322
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:13,333
I see a ship that's lifting
off from the moon's surface!

323
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:14,500
What?!

324
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,541
[MELFINA]
It's closing in at high speed.

325
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:19,625
[HORUS] Warning.
It's that pirate vessel.

326

[RON]
Just like I told you.

327
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,458
Hilda came, all right.

328
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,916
[RON] If you wanna
know about an Outlaw,

329
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,916
ask another Outlaw.

[YOUNG GIRL]
Thank you, Mr. MacDougall.

332
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,500
Don't mention it.

333
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,708
I knew that the Guild would
pay for the information,

334
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,416
so it was an easy job.

335
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,166
Tell me, is there
any other way

336
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,000
I could be of any help to you?

337
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,625
My brother will launch our
ship, if you need us to.

338
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:59,666
This is our job now.
That won't be necessary.

339
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,750
You had to go and kill more
of my friends, didn't you?

340
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,458
So, what're we gonna do, now?

341
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,958
Accelerate and fly
down their throats.

342
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,458
Gene, take the gunner's chair.

343
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:11,666
You mean me?

344
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,875
I can fire that, but
I won't hit anything.

345
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,916
Just how long are you
gonna keep whining?!

346
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,166
If I can't hit anything,
I can't hit anything!

347
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,291
You gonna just keep
running away?!

Just keep running away?!

349
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,666
I'm not running.

350
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,333
Don't start bitching if
I puke on everything.

351

Wanna be a "Spacer," hold it in!

352
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:54,333
Aw, damn. What a slave-driver

353
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:57,458
Jim, I'll take over.

354
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,208
[JIM]
Hey, don't overdo it, Gene.

355
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:03,291
Ah, I'm a natural born Spacer,
don't you worry about it, Jim.

You won't get away, Hilda.

Okay, wise-asses,
it's your turn to die!

You going to let them escape?

00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,666
You needn't concern yourself.

[OLD MAN]
We've branded you, Hilda.

00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,750
You will never be able
to escape us, now.

371
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:06,250
We will take back everything
that you stole from us.

372
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:09,166
You will regret
what you have done.

373
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,333
Head straight for

Hey, where is this
Farfa-whatever place?

377
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,583
It's a star system about
40 light years from here

378
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:23,708
with a lot of natural resources.
It's a desert island in space.

379
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,291
So, why are we goin' there?

380
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,875
That ship I told you about
before is hidden there.

381
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,958
Huh? You actually gave me
a straight answer for once.

382
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,875
Because I found out I can
use you as a crew member.

Hm?

Why did you bring me along?

391
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:49,083
Would you have preferred to
stay back there with them?

392
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,041
Not really.

393

[CTARL GOVERNOR] This is a
disgrace, Aisha Clanclan.

Our reports clearly state
that Hilda's ship, Horus,

404
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:46,916
was right under your nose and
you dared to let him get away?

But, Governor at that time, uh,
I did not have that information!
