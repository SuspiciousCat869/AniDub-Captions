1
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:23,375
[NARRATOR] Ether spray laps
against the sides of ships.

2
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:27,875
Stars flare up turbulent
space, whipping out storms.

3
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:31,000
The swift currents of
the abyss overpower them.

4
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:34,416
Cast-off planetary debris
pierces their hulls.

5
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,000
Left with a history
of scars and mutation.

6
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:41,625
But no matter how many thousands
of ships are turned to scrap,

7
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:45,500
or tens of thousands of
lives vanish into the void,

8
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:48,916
ships do not stop
venturing into this sea.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,333
There is no end to
sailors who will sail her.

10
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:54,625
Drawn by mysterious passion.

11
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:57,000
Craving with an
endless appetite.

12
00:00:57,083 --> 00:01:02,708
Unknown regions await them,
even now, in this endless sea.

13
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:41,000
How do I get out?

14
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:42,583
[GILLIAM]
There is no way.

15
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,125
No way!

16
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:47,541
Gene, the checkpoint.

17
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,916
I think it's gonna
be swallowed up!

18
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,750
All we can do is break
through at full speed.

19
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,791
[GILLIAM]
That's not very smart.

20
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,583
But, Gilliam, I thought you were
the fastest ship in the galaxy!

21
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:00,166
[MELFINA]
MNM Engine output, 108%.

22
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,333
All engines show normal.

23
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,458
Let's go!

24
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,958
[yelling]

25
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:14,333
[GENE]
We did it!

26
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:15,750
[MELFINA]
Ah-ha!

27
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:22,875
[GILLIAM]
Hate to disillusion you,

28
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,500
but we're not out of the
planet's orbit just yet.

29
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:28,375
And please return the engine
output to normal levels.

30
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,125
Man, you just gotta complain
about everything, don't ya?

31
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,791
--[beeping]
--Huh?

32
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,125
You have just cleared
checkpoint one, <i>Outlaw Star</i> .

33
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:36,458
Hey, I gotta tell ya.

34
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:38,625
That was one heck of a
stunt ya pulled out there.

35
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,250
I know, where do we stand now?

36
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,541
Well let's see. You just
blew past 12 ships.

37
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,000
There are 13 ships
ahead of you,

38
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,958
but your time puts you
in sixth, as of now.

39
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,250
We're only in sixth
after all we went through?

40
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,625
[STAFF MEMEBER] You know
you're not the only ones

41
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,708
who took that route just now,
but I'll tell ya,

42
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:54,666
you are the only ones who
slipped past that wave.

43
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,208
Yeah, well, I thought
I'd try to make the race

44
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,541
a little more exciting.

45
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:00,791
I getcha. Well now,
you have a good race, okay?

46
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,166
Next up is the fifth
planet, Heifong V.

47
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,625
Distance, about 500
million kilometers.

48
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,458
All right then,
let's go to sub-ether

49
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,375
and jump this stretch,
whaddya say?

50
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,875
[ANNOUNCER]
The rookie ship, <i>Outlaw Star</i> ,

51
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,291
has suddenly jumped up in rank

52
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:13,625
when it cleared
the first checkpoint,

53
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,750
and is now currently
in sixth place!

54
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,083
What do you think'll
happen later, Mr. Ishigaki?

55
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,250
[ISHIGAKI]
Good question.

56
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,250
With the <i>Outlaw Star</i>
in sixth place,

57
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,166
it's certainly the dark horse.

58
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,666
[GENE] Making a single
orbit around this thing

59
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,500
is an easy checkpoint.
It's obvious.

60
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,166
What do ya think, Jim?

61
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:29,916
Huh?

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,750
[snoring]

63
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,833
[GENE]
Hey, Jim!

64
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:37,541
[MELFINA] Hang in there, Jim.
We're almost to the aid station.

65
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,333
Yeah, you're right.

66
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,250
You know, we're suppose
to pull the ship over

67
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,833
so we can run maintenance
for at least an hour.

68
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,375
[GILLIAM]
All systems show normal.

69
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:48,833
Showing all green.

70
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,875
Well in that case, let's run
maintenance on ourselves.

71
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,583
Come on, you guys.
Let's go get somethin' to eat.

72
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:21,291
[GENE] It's that ship.
I've finally caught up with him.

73
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,000
[GENE]
Pardon me, guys.

74
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,208
Are you the crew
of the <i>El Dorado</i> ?

75
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:36,625
Yeah, that's right.
And who's asking?

76
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:39,500
First of all, which one
of you's MacDougall?

77
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,375
There's nobody by
that name here.

78
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,458
Yeah right, like I'm
suppose to believe ya.

79
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:46,541
The MacDougall Brother's are the
one's who own the <i>El Dorado</i> .

80
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,041
[HARRY]
Who are you talking about?

81
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,875
I haven't the foggiest
idea what you mean.

82
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,625
[GENE]
Look! Don't be stupid!

83
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:55,041
It doesn't look like the guy
that Hilda talked to is here,

84
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,083
but I remember
that ship all right.

85
00:05:57,166 --> 00:06:01,208
You don't fool me. I wouldn't
forget that for anything.

86
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:06,083
That is definitely the same ship
that attacked us at Farfallas.

87
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,125
Just what are you tryin'
to pull here, mister?

88
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,833
Let go of Harry, now!

89
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:12,125
Hey, Terry, Leo, it's okay!

90
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:15,250
Look here. I have no idea
what you're talking about.

91
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,125
I've never been to
"Farfallas" or whatever.

92
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:22,208
All right then, why were the Kei
Pirates looking for the <i>XGP</i> ?

93
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:25,791
And why did your people
try to destroy the <i>XGP</i> ?

94
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,541
If you keep tryin'
to pick a fight,

95
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,041
I'll just have to call
the race staff--

96
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,375
Fine. Go ahead.

97
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,208
But if you're smart, you'd
cut out all the bullshit

98
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,583
and just level with me.

99
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:36,666
Somebody! This guy's
interfering with the race!

100
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,333
Is there a problem here?

101
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:39,875
[GENE chuckles]

102
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:42,250
Nah, he was just telling me
about the house special, right?

103
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,291
Well, sounds great,
but I better be going.

104
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,041
The special will have
to wait till next time.

105
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,416
Thanks anyway, buddy.

106
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,833
See you later.

107
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,208
Hey, Harry, who was that guy?

108
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,250
[HARRY]
Shut your mouth.

109
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,875
Ehh.

110
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,458
[HARRY] That son of a...
I can't believe it.

111
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:02,583
He survived Farfallas?!

112
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:05,166
[SECURITY] Everything okay
here, sir. You need some help?

113
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,458
No, everything's
okay. Thank you.

114
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:09,666
[JIM]
Watching you deal with that guy

115
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,708
scared the hell out of me, Gene.

116
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:15,125
Gah! Talk about just
blowin' a buncha hot air!

117
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:18,458
Yeah, well, that's only if
the guy wasn't MacDougall.

118
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:21,916
But if it really was him, then
he can't ignore us anymore.

119
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,833
You'll see, he'll make contact.

120
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:27,208
[GILLIAM] Excuse me, but
that ship is starting out now.

121
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,958
How soon can we leave?

122
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,333
[GILLIAM]
In 11 minutes.

123
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:35,458
Once we catch up, I'll
show 'em a thing or two.

124
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:36,750
Attention, all ships.

125
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,041
We've been told that an
ether stream is forming

126
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,833
that stretches from Heifong V

127
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,708
to checkpoint 4-A
at Heifong I.

128
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:47,125
The use of checkpoint 4-B at
Heifong II is recommended.

129
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,583
You heard what he said.

130
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:51,625
Now let's see how the
<i>El Dorado</i> handles it.

131
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,583
[HARRY] Leo, give me the
official data on the ship

132
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,291
that left after us.

133
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:59,500
[LEO]
Okay.

134
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:06,458
[HARRY]
Is that the <i>XGP</i> ?

135
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,375
[ANNOUNCER] The ship in
last place has now cleared

136
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:09,875
the second checkpoint.

137
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:12,416
Two ships have currently dropped
out due to engine trouble.

138
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,125
Let's hope...

139
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,833
Where do you think Gene might
be with the <i>Outlaw Star</i> ?

140
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:18,291
I have no idea, but
this pathetic broadcast

141
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,250
is barely covering
the pirate ships.

142
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,500
[ANNOUNCER] The third checkpoint
is the Lione La Grange Point,

143
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:25,791
which is 140 million
kilometers from Heifong V.

144

[NUBATA]
Lady Aisha.

145
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,833
We'll be reaching the third
checkpoint in just a moment.

146
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,208
What is that out there?

147
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,958
They say that a long time
ago a satellite in orbit

148
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:37,000
around Heifong V had
been destroyed by something

149
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,625
and all the debris from the
destruction was collected there.

150
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,541
Reduce speed immediately.

151
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:44,333
Like I really need
to be told that.

152
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:51,916
She's all yours, Harry!

153
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,583
Well we would
never gain any time

154
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,791
without me at the helm, Leo.

155
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,916
[humming]

156
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,750
Is something you'd like to
share with us, Lady Aisha?

157
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,041
I'm looking for a place
to set up an ambush.

158
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:08,250
[BOTH]
Huh? Set up an ambush?

159
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,708
Prepare for battle!

160
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,541
[BOTH]
Huh? Prepare for battle?

161
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,166
Battle systems, get ready.

162
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,666
We will now launch a sneak
attack on the <i>Outlaw Star</i> !

163
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,625
Attack with a single
machine gun?

164
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,666
A single machine gun?

165
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,833
Hmph! What about your Guriguri
missiles or Gagagan Cannon, huh?

166
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,125
We are not equipped
with anything like that.

167
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,125
[AISHA] And you call this
an imperial ship!

168
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,666
What're you saying?

169
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,958
The Niburu-Boribori Ship is
just for trading with Heifong!

170
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,625
[groaning]

171
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:38,666
I don't know what kind of
orders you've been given

172
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,375
from the Empire, Lady Aisha,

173
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,291
but this ship can't
make an attack.

174
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,333
I can't believe this.

175
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:48,875
All right then, it's time for
a clever scheme from Aisha!

176
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,375
[JIM]
There it is!

177
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:51,708
[GILLIAM]
Ether density is climbing

178
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,458
and is surging irregularly.

179
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:56,791
[MELFINA] Sub-space radar
error has increased to 24%

180
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,875
and effective radius
for standard radar

181
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,166
is also down 30%.

182
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,541
[GILLIAM] We'll have to
forgo the instruments

183
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:03,875
and rely on our eyes.

184
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:07,750
Now you're about to see
how good I can really be.

185
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,708
Come on, Gene, slow down!

186
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,083
Yeah, sure. I will.

187
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:15,125
[MELFINA] Current speed is
12 kilometers per second.

188
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,458
[GILLIAM] It's clear for
the next 180 kilometers.

189
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:20,500
But I do see some big
asteroids after that.

190
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,333
What's the shortest route
to the checkpoint?

191
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:25,125
[MELFINA] Please change
course to one o'clock low.

192
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,666
Roger that.

193
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,000
[JIM]
That's it!

194
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,458
[GENE]
Let's do it!

195
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,416
We have cleared the checkpoint!

196
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,666
Yeah! Way ta go!

197
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,250
All we have to do now is
get the hell outta here.

198
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,166
--Huh?
--[beeping]

199
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,000
[MUBATA]
Mayday! Mayday!

200
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,833
This is the <i>Niburu-Boribori</i> !
I've collided with an asteroid!

201
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,166
I've abandoned ship due
to risk of explosion!

202
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,666
Request assistance!
Request assistance!

203
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,750
[GILLIAM] It's an emergency
rescue transmission.

204
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,500
I've pinpointed his location.

205
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,541
I'll pull it up on the screen.

206
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,458
Gene, whaddya
think we should do?

207
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,291
I know the Course Marshal
will come by soon

208
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,416
and they'll be sure
to take care of him.

209
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,458
Aw, let's help the poor guy out.

210
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:14,208
[JIM] Gene, whaddya pullin'?
That's not like you.

211
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:17,166
Believe me. It's no fun to
be stranded out in space.

212
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,333
It's a feeling I try
hard not to remember.

213
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,416
[JIM]
Do you see him, Gene?

214
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,833
Yeah.

215
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,333
Ugh. Shit.

216
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:34,750
[JIM]
Hey, what's wrong?

217
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,208
[GENE]
I'm just a little dizzy.

218
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,833
[MELFINA]
Will you be okay?

219
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:41,750
Yeah. Think I can handle it.

220
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:47,000
[GENE] Okay now.
You're gonna be fine.

221
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,750
[GILLIAM]
Pressurization complete.

222
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,666
Were you the only crew member,

223
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,875
or were there others
still out there?

224
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:03,416
You won't get away from me
this time, you sucker!

225
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,833
Uh! What the hell are
you doing here?!

226
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:08,458
[laughs]

227
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,375
You mean to tell me,
after all this time,

228
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,458
the ones who have the key
to the Galactic Leyline

229
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,041
are those MacDougall guys?

230
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,291
They sure have more information
on Hilda than I do,

231
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,833
that much I can tell ya.

232
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,791
Do you really expect
me to believe

233
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:34,833
that you know absolutely nothing
about the Galactic Leyline?

234
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:37,750
If we did, we would've gone
there along time ago.

235
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,666
Look, when we find somethin'
out, we'll be sure to tell ya.

236
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,916
Now, get off the ship
and go bug someone else.

237
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,416
No way, I can't!

238
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,916
There's no way I can go back
to the Empire like this!

239
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,833
I can't go back! They treat
me like I'm useless!

240
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,958
You're the only lead I have.
Do you understand me?

241
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,541
Until I get my hands on what I
want, I am not going anywhere!

242
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:57,125
Gene, whaddya gonna do with her?

243
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:58,875
Being popular with
the girls ain't easy.

244
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,458
[JIM]
That's not what I meant.

245
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,666
I've never seen a ship
like this before.

246
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,625
It's way behind any
Ctarl-Ctarl Ship.

247
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,208
It won't move
unless you're naked.

248
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:08,875
Ah! That's very kinky,
wouldn't you say?

249
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,250
[GILLIAM] How dare you talk
about the galaxy's fastest,

250
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,958
most advanced ship like that.

251
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:15,458
Huh? What the
hell is that thing?

252
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:16,791
[GILLIAM]
I am not a "thing."

253
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,916
I'd appreciate it if you
would call me Gilliam.

254
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,208
What the--? It's a computer?

255
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,416
Wow.

256
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,208
Enough of this, let's
get back to racing.

257
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:28,125
My plan to catch up with the <i>El</i>
<i>Dorado</i> sure went up in smoke.

258
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,791
It's becoming useless.

259
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,375
Oh great, the cat-girl shows up

260
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:32,875
and everything gets
totally whacked.

261
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,458
If we don't finish
in third or better,

262
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,375
we're gonna be in
debt even deeper.

263
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,583
[MELFINA] Now preparing
for sub-ether drive.

264
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:41,000
Please handle
course corrections.

265
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,333
All right. Roger.

266
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:44,708
[MELFINA] Estimated time
to sub-ether penetration,

267
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:45,750
24 minutes.

268
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:46,458
Meow?

269
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:47,750
[GENE]
I can't see!

270
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,333
[ANNOUNCER] Three ships
have recently dropped out

271
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,000
after having cleared
the third checkpoint.

272
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,916
That leaves 35 ships heading
for the fourth checkpoint.

273
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,333
We'll have--

274
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,291
All of this traveling
has worn me out.

275
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,375
I'm gonna take a little
cat nap right here.

276
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,333
Wake me up when
we get there, okay?

277
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:07,625
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

278
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,666
[JIM groans]

279
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,375
[MELFINA] Now switching
over to sub-ether drive.

280
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:17,791
Munchausen reactor output,
regular and climbing.

281
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,541
Ether outbreak
threshold breached.

282
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:24,041
Course laid in. Relative
coordinates verified.

283
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,541
[MELFINA] Now forming
sub-ether bubble.

284
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:31,000
[beeping]

285
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,791
[groans] Quiet down, will ya?

286
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,000
[GILLIAM] Objects are
closing in from rearward.

287
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,833
There's an 87% probability
they are missiles.

288
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,583
I don't get it! I didn't
think anybody was after us.

289
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,208
We'll just intercept
them. That's all!

290
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,291
[MELFINA]
We can't.

291
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,000
We're transforming
to sub-ether mode.

292
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,916
Just great. How long
till we go to sub-ether?

293
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,166
[MELFINA]
Eighteen seconds.

294
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,916
[GILLIAM] Missiles will
impact in 16 seconds.

295
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,583
[GENE]
I'll shake them off!

296
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,666
Eh? What's goin' on now?

297
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,833
[MELFINA] Preparations for jump
to lightspeed is now complete.

298
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:05,083
Sub-ether penetration in eight.

299
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:08,125
Seven. Six. Five. Four.

300
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,375
Three. Two. One.

301
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:11,041
Zero.

302
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,500
We're gonna make it!

303
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:15,125
[JIM]
Ah!

304
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,208
[TERRY] Damn, Harry!
That was really awesome!

305
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:33,000
[TERRY chuckles]

306
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,291
They went to the sub-ether

307
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,416
while they were bein' hit
with gravity waves.

308
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,666
Too bad. They'll
probably disintegrate.

309
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,333
Okay, we can prepare
to go to sub-ether now.

310
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:44,416
Hey, Harry, what was the big
deal with that ship anyway?

311
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,458
As far as my brother
and I are concerned,

312
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,791
it was just an eyesore.

313
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,375
[chuckles]

314
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,000
[JIM screaming]

315
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,250
[GILLIAM]
There is no way to determine

316
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,791
which direction we're going.

317
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,000
Sub-ether drive,
emergency abort!

318
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,750
[MELFINA] The Munchhausen
reactor is out of control!

319
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:05,666
Wh-What the hell's goin' on?!

320
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,625
[GILLIAM]
Stress on the ship is climbing.

321
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,708
Now exceeding any safety factor.

322
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:12,708
That's it! I'm cutting
all engine systems!

323
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,416
[GENE, JIM, AISHA scream]

324
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:18,666
[AISHA]
Meow?

325
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,625
Hey, come on. Wake up, will ya?

326
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:27,541
[groans]

327
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,958
Is everyone okay? Melfina?

328
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,958
[MELFINA]
Yes. I'm fine.

329
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,333
[GILLIAM] We are currently
operating on auxiliary power,

330
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:37,041
so there's no information
regarding what's outside.

331
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,125
Please restart the ship.

332
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,333
Unbelievable,
life goes on and on.

333
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,375
It's too much.

334
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,166
[GILLIAM]
Testing, testing.

335
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,833
[AISHA]
Where the heck are we anyway?

336
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,000
[GILLIAM]
It would be accurate to say

337
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,916
we have safely returned
to normal space.

338
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,166
Fortunately, we don't
seem to be too far away

339
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,541
from the Heifong system.

340
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,750
I will try to calculate
our position.

341
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,875
This ship is a lot
tougher than I thought.

342
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,500
[GILLIAM] I believe I
already mentioned it.

343
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:11,500
I am the fastest, most
advanced ship in the galaxy.

344
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:12,458
[GENE]
Know where we are?

345
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,541
[GILLIAM]
Yes, Gene

346
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:17,333
We're slightly outside
the orbit of Heifong V.

347
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:21,500
About 360 million kilometers
above it's orbital plane.

348
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,541
How long has it been
since we jumped?

349
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,500
[GILLIAM] Ship's clock says
it's been 2 minutes, 24 seconds

350
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,000
since sub-ether entry.

351
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,500
Bring us up to date, Gilliam,
what's the status report?

352
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,208
[GILLIAM] Life support,
all communications,

353
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,583
and all sensors show normal.

354
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,000
[MELFINA]
Irregularities confirmed

355
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,583
in the ether drive system.

356
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,458
Newton reactors 1
and 3 are inoperable.

357
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:41,708
[JIM yelps]

358
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:44,083
All right then, activate
Newton reactors 2 and 4.

359
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,750
And lay in a stable
course for checkpoint four.

360
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:49,458
[GILLIAM] I perceive that you
want to continue the race?

361
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:50,666
You think I'd give up

362
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,500
when we can still move
under our own power?

363
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,625
The sub-ether drive
still works, right?

364
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,500
[MELFINA] Yes, but two
reactors are at 50% output.

365
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,291
That's not enough
for sub-ether entry.

366
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,708
We are working under a
lower level of propulsion.

367
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:04,750
How many hours to checkpoint
four just using the ether drive.

368
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,041
[GILLIAM] The distance is
600 million kilometers.

369
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:12,166
At 50% propulsion... it would
take about 96 hours.

370
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,875
The race would already be over.

371
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,375
[AISHA groans]

372
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:19,875
What's the deal?
You've given up?

373
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:22,000
Somebody just blasted you
with a couple of missiles,

374
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,666
and you're gonna
sit there and cry,

375
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,291
"The ship's busted! We're stuck!
What are we gonna do?

376
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,583
We don't stand a chance!
We're all doomed!

377
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,000
Oh no!

378
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:32,833
We're really doomed. We failed.
We'll never make it."

379
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:35,750
To a Ctarl-Ctarl, this attitude
of yours is all wrong!

380
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,625
A Ctarl-Ctarl never
excepts defeat.

381
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:41,458
To a Ctarl-Ctarl, it's all about
justice, courage, and tenacity!

382
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:45,000
Doesn't she know by now
we're not Ctarl-Ctarl?

383
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:48,166
It takes guts to go swimming
in the ether-sea, and it's...

384
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,958
Wait, ether?

385
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,208
Gilliam!

386
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,291
Can you tell where that
ether stream is forming?

387
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,541
[GILLIAM]
Oh my, let us take a look.

388
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:56,791
Ah, here it is.

389
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,958
The stream runs from
Heifong V to Heifong I.

390
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:01,208
I've located it.

391
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,875
[GENE]
Aisha, sit down!

392
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:05,500
[AISHA] Don't tell me
what to do! Ah!

393
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,291
Now what are ya plannin' to do?

394
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:10,125
I don't care if we win or lose,
but I've got an idea.

395
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,583
I think it can work.
It's at least worth trying.

396
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,625
You don't mean what
I think you mean.

397
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:17,041
Jim, you know any normal
ship would be history

398
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,291
if it went straight
into an ether stream.

399
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,125
That is, any normal ship.

400
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,750
[GILLIAM I'd say this
is no ordinary ship.

401
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,333
That's it exactly.

402
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,916
I noticed something surprising
when I saw the operating manual.

403
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,541
This ship can make it out of an
ether stream with no problem,

404
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:33,000
which means we're
gonna take this baby...

405
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,541
I don't wanna hear it!

406
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:37,250
...and ride that ether
stream all the way!

407
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:40,000
Ha! Let's go!

408
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,916
[MELFINA] We have made contact
and have now switched

409
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,375
to Grappler combat mode.

410
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,333
Have faith in me, guys.
Enjoy the ride.

411
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:51,625
You're in good hands.

412
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,708
I can handle this! I can do it!

413
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:54,833
How do ya know?

414
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:55,666
I don't.

415
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,000
[JIM]
I knew it.

416
00:19:57,083 --> 00:20:00,291
That's okay. There's a first
time for everything!

417
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,791
Combat is the best practice!

418
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:14,208
Yeah! Let's get
that missiles guy!

419
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:20,625
[SAFF MEMBER]
You have just passed

420
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,916
checkpoint four, <i>El Dorado</i> .

421
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,416
[HARRY]
What's our standing?

422
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,083
According to our checkpoint
data, as the standing reads,

423
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,583
you are currently
in fourth place.

424
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,291
So now it all depends
upon which ships

425
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,708
are headed for Heifong I,
isn't that right?

426
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,916
However, we have
recently been notified

427
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,500
that there is an ether
stream that is in

428
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,500
the surrounding
areas of Heifong I.

429
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,958
So finishing above
fourth is a sure thing.

430
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,708
[chuckles]

431
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,833
[HARRY] But why is my heart
pounding like this?

432
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:51,250
[STAFF A] What?!
Where did they come from?!

433
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,875
[STAFF B] It looks like they're
riding the ether stream!

434
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:55,125
[STAFF A]
By accident?

435
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:56,541
[STAFF B] No, it looks
like it was deliberate.

436
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,208
What, are they stupid?!

437
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,333
Open a channel to them,
I want communication now!

438
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:06,416
[GENE] This ship is 26,
the <i>Outlaw Star</i> .

439
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,791
What's our current standing?

440
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,125
How should I know?

441
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:10,833
But in "dumb-ass stunts,"
you're in first place!

442
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:13,541
Great! Glad to hear it!
<i>Outlaw Star</i> , signing off!

443
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:14,791
Gilliam, get ready.

444
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:17,500
We're using Heifong I
for a gravity slingshot!

445
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:20,750
Ugh. I thought we were
gonna be goners.

446
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,083
But if we can keep this up,

447
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,541
we might actually
make the top three!

448
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,750
[ANNOUNCER] The first to arrive
is the Trihorse Corporation's

449
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,166
<i>Sunbeam 545</i> !

450
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,833
They have a lock on first place!

451
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,625
And next is the Penelope
Corporation's <i>Bonaparte</i> !

452
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,375
The time difference
with the trailing ships

453
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:36,500
might be a problem!

454
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,208
Tell us where Gene is!

455
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,500
[ANNOUNCER] The <i>Bonaparte</i> has
secured second place now!

456
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:43,416
We're still waiting to see
who's behind in third place.

457
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,625
Oh, the tension is building.

458
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:48,083
And the third place ship
has come into view!

459
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,791
It's the <i>Outlaw Star</i> !

460
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,708
And it's a... goal!

461
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:54,583
The <i>Outlaw Star</i> , a Privateer,
is the third ship to finish!

462
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:56,125
But watch out, the <i>Hisetsu</i> ,

463
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:59,208
which began just two minutes
later, is also about to finish!

464
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:00,666
Hey, get away!

465
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,125
If it comes in more than two
minutes after us, we win!

466
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,958
The Siven Industries <i>Hisetsu</i>
has now cleared the goal!

467
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:07,541
And its time?

468
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,916
It's beaten out the <i>Outlaw</i>
<i>Star</i> for third place!

469
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,208
[ALL groan]

470
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:13,750
Damn it! And they were so close.

471
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:19,416
[CROWD chattering]

472
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,875
[STAFF C]
You need to hurry!

473
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:22,375
Why? We finished fourth.

474
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:24,708
What's the awards presentation
got to do with us?

475
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:26,333
[STAFF C] Well, you
finished fourth overall,

476
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:28,958
but you were first in
the Privateer category.

477
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:31,208
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
a damn thing to Fred Luo.

478
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:32,625
What does he care?

479
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:34,458
Hey, whaddya think you're doin'?

480
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:38,083
We're with the Privateer <i>Outlaw</i>
<i>Star</i> , first place winners!

481
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:39,250
Yeah!

482
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:44,375
[AISHA laughing]

483
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:45,958
Well, it's pretty
good advertising

484
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:47,833
in spite of their
coming in fourth.

485
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:49,583
But, Fred, what about
the sponsorship fee?

486
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:51,208
Oh, I guess I'll give them half.

487
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:52,333
Two hundred thousand.

488
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,291
Okay, so the costume's
a little flashy,

489
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:55,916
but it's like I'm
gonna live in it.

490
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,583
[GENE]
What did you say?!

491
00:22:57,666 --> 00:23:00,416
Come here! What do you mean the
<i>El Dorado</i> has dropped out?!

492
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,541
Well, yes. That's it, sir.

493
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:04,416
We have a comm cube
with your name on it.

494
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,416
And it was sent directly
from the <i>El Dorado</i> .

495
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,666
Huh? Sent to me? Oh...

496
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:46,041
[GENE] That MacDougall guy sent
me a letter to challenge me.

497
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:47,041
Ha!

498
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:49,166
Man, this guy's old fashioned.

499
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,958
He swore up and down that
it would be a fair fight,

500
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:54,666
but then he keeps coming
at me from outta nowhere!

501
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:57,416
What kinna rules does
this guy play by, anyway?

502
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,125
Looks like I'm gonna have to
beat some manners into him!

503
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:02,500
Show him that he's
wasting my time.

504
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:05,250
So would you mind
keeping it down, Aisha?!

505
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:07,208
Next time on <i>Outlaw Star</i> :

506
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:09,375
"Mortal Combat
with the <i>El Dorado</i> "!

507
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:10,875
You better get ready!
