[NARRATOR]
A boy has the right to dream.

2
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:22,791
There are endless possibilities
stretched out before him.

3
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:28,041
What awaits him down the path
he will then have to choose.

4
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:30,833
The boy doesn't always know.

5
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:34,458
At some point, the boy
then becomes an adult,

6
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:37,583
and learns what he
was able to become.

7
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:41,666
Joy and sadness, forever,
will accompany this.

8
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,750
He is confronted with a choice.

9
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:49,875
When this happens, does he bid
his past farewell in his heart?

10
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:51,875
Once a boy becomes an adult,

11
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:55,208
he can longer go
back to being a boy.

Only one thing can be said:

14
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:04,291

Why not?

Looks like he didn't want to
get mixed up with pirates.

Aw, he's nothin'
but a big chicken.

303

[SWANZO] I have one
other piece of bad news.

The McDougall Brothers
have been askin' about you.

305
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,750
Damn bunch of fools!

306
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:23,833

Hey, hey, hey, hey!

307
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,458
"McCoy" this, "MacDougall" that.

308
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,833
When are you people gonna
start talkin' some sense?!

309
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:31,583
[SWANZO] Ha! Don't butt into
an adult conversation, kid.

310
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:32,875
Did you call me kid?

311
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,291
Listen here, buddy!

312
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:37,083
[SWANZO] Whoa, now, if you
let yourself get worked up

313
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:40,833
over everything, kid,
you won't last long.

314
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,666
[SWANZO] Usin' those
things is banned here.

315
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,000
You might want to
remember that, kid.

316
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:48,375
Relax, buddy, it's
not even loaded.

317
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:49,833
I was just bluffin'.

318
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:53,291
So firing a gun is banned in
a free town, what is that?

319
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:57,291
[SWANZO] Well. If a stray
cracked a seal somewhere

320
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,666
and the air escaped,

321
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,125
everybody who lives here
would go straight to heaven.

322
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,375
Morons who can't
follow the rules

323
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,166
don't have a right
to go on living.

324
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,875
Yeah. Or maybe only morons who
follow the rules live here.

325
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,958
So that's what
an Outlaw is, huh?

326
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:13,083
They're pirates?

327
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,666
[SWANZO]
Sounds like this other youngster

328
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:18,625
doesn't understand, either.
There are three powers in space:

329
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:21,291
The Space Forces, Pirates,
and the Outlaws.

330
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,333
The difference is
what motivates them.

331
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:26,583
What motivates an Outlaw varies
from person to person.

332
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:31,000
Good or bad don't figure into
solidarity and sense of duty.

333
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,083
And that's what
makes them Outlaws.

334
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,791
[MIKEY]
Take a look at this Swanzo!

335
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,833
This ain't gonna be
a one-person job!

[SWANZO] Damn it... All right,
I'll be right there!

Sure. Take care of him.

339

[SWANZO] Bye, kids.
Behave yourselves, now.

340

[GENE]
No way, I don't think so.

341
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,333
I don't know the first thing
about clothes shopping,

342
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:51,708
how did I get suckered into it?

343
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:53,250
She's with you, isn't she?

344
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,541
[HILDA] I have someplace to
go and Melfina needs clothes.

345
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:56,750
I'd rather she be with you.

346
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,250
I know she'd be in
good hands that way.

347
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,583
Remember, Melfina
is important to us.

348
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,208
Okay, I see.

349
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,916
How about this, then.
Melfina goes with Jim,

350
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,208
because that way the job
is sure to get done.

351
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,541
And then I can go
along with you?

352

It's a deal.

353
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,083
And what a deal.

354
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,125

Let's meet at the hotel, then.

Okay, Hilda, so what now?

372
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,958
[HILDA]
This is an Outlaw hangout.

373
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,958
I figured if there's anybody
halfway decent here,

374
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,541
I'd hire him.

375
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:19,708
So, it's not a job you
can handle alone.

376
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,458
I think it's time you
tell me what the job is.

Enough with the secrets.

[HILDA]
All right.

379
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,375
I'm going to pick up
a certain ship.

380
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:34,958
A certain ship?

381
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:38,166
It's a very special ship, a
ship that has enough power

382
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:42,583
to dive into the Ether Sargasso,
it's called a Grappler Ship.

00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:45,250
A Grappler... Space Ship?

384
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:48,500
If you're planning to come
along, you might think it over.

Make sure it's what you want.

Cause, it sounds like you're
bit of a space hater.
