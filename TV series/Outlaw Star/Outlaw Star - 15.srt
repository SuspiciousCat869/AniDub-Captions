1
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:22,500
[NARRATOR] Under the direct
command of Hazanko,

2
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:26,666
leader of the 108 Stars,
are the Anten Seven,

3
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,833
a feared group of assassins.

4
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:36,541
Tobigera, a master of disguise
and the tools of killing.

5
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:42,041
Hanmyo, a prodigy of space
combat, with the use of cats.

6
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:47,541
Iraga, a werewolf with
miraculous life force.

7
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:52,375
Jukai; his abilities
are shrouded in mystery.

8
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:56,125
Hitoriga, a man advanced
in the martial arts,

9
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:59,166
much like the leader
of the Anten Seven.

10
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,750
Hamushi,

11
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:05,250
a beauty who captivates men
purely by her sex appeal.

12
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:09,750
Shimi, a warrior whose skill
is such that there is no one

13
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:14,083
in the Pirate Guild who
has never heard of him.

14
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:16,000
If someone were
unfortunate enough

15
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:18,500
to make an enemy
of the Anten Seven

16
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:20,583
and forced to fight
against them,

17
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:24,000
I would say only this:

18
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:26,625
Farewell, friend.

19
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,208
[HITORIGA]
Lord Hazanko,

20
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:15,291
the Anten Seven are
now assembled.

21
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:16,875
[HAZANKO]
Hmm...

22
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,208
If you are the only ones who are
capable of taking this guy out,

23
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:20,666
he must be very good.

24
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,333
[JUKAI] Hazanko, would you
prefer that I deal with him?

25
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:28,041
I wouldn't mind at
all doing it myself.

26
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:32,375
Hitoriga, I've noticed the Anten
Seven seems to be short one.

27
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:36,500
[HITORIGA] Yes, Lord Hazanko
has anticipated this.

28
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,791
[HAZANKO] I have sent out
Shimi as the first assassin.

29
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,708
Well done, Lord Hazanko.

30
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,500
Without a doubt, knowing Shimi,

31
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,416
he will certainly carry
out your orders.

32
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,833
[JUKAI]
Wait!

33
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:49,541
This man may have
stolen the <i>XGP</i> ,

34
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:52,541
but he is still a mere
helpless Outlaw.

35
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:55,708
Why are we needed to kill
the likes of this man?

36
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:59,208
[HAZANKO]
Hmm... Gene Starwind is strong.

37
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:02,875
But his power should be
nothing to compare to yours.

38
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:07,375
However, I do sense a powerful
chi line flowing towards him.

39
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:10,250
As of now, it is
but a small sign.

40
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,375
Yet, if we leave it unchecked,

41
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:15,500
I believe he will come
to cast a dark shadow

42
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:18,083
upon the path we walk.

43
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:21,583
And so, I entrust you
with this very task.

44
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,666
In the name of the Anten,

45
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,333
you must seal
Gene Starwind's fate.

46
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,208
[JIM]
Gene, it's not lookin' good.

47
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:35,375
We're still way in the red.

48
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:37,541
We gotta earn
some big bucks.

49
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,125
Wake up, will ya?!
Are you listening?

50
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,416
[GENE]
Yeah.

51
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,458
[JIM]
Gene!

52
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:44,000
Aw, relax.

53
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:47,625
I already know. I don't need
you to keep on harpin' about it.

54
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,541
[AVATAR]
I love you! I want you!

55
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:50,750
[GIRL]
Liar!

56
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:51,833
[laughs]

57
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:52,750
It's so obvious.

58
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,041
You're taking it
all out on Jim

59
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,791
'cause you haven't
gotten a job offer.

60
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,000
That damn game of yours
is drivin' me crazy.

61
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,541
Will ya turn it off?!

62
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,500
[AISHA] Taking it out on me
won't do you any good either.

63
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,250
Why don't you just
talk to yourself?

64
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,083
Aw, shut up!

65
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,791
[laughing]

66
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,125
--[beep]
--Uh?

67
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,666
Ah! The game's over!
You made me lose! You idiot!

68
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,125
It's all your fault, Gene!

69
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:15,833
[GENE]
Aw, shut up.

70
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,083
I made some coffee.

71
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,708
[JIM]
Uh, Thanks!

72
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,208
[AISHA]
Aisha's really, really thirsty.

73
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:21,666
I'll have some, too!

74
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,041
What're we gonna do now?

75
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:25,250
You've always gotta have
some kinda plan in life.

76
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:29,125
If we could just solve the
mystery of the Galactic Leyline,

77
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:32,083
then we could all
have the treasure!

78
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:35,625
Yeah, I wonder what that
treasure is anyway.

79
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:39,416
[MELFINA]
Here you are.

80
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,208
[SHIMI]
Gene Starwind!

81
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,583
If you're in there, come out!

82
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,041
Huh?

83
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:50,708
[JIM]
Hm?

84
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:51,791
Wonder who that is.

85
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,875
Maybe somebody with a job offer.

86
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,250
Ah, great...

87
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,083
What do they want now?

88
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,958
[SHIMI]
Gene Starwind?

89
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:04,375
Yeah, that's right.

90
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:07,000
[SHIMI] Nothing personal,
but I'm here to kill you.

91
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,583
Oh, yeah? You a pirate?

92
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,541
[SHIMI]
And if I am?

93
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,583
I just like to know who
I'm doing business with.

94
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,083
What's your name?

95
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,375
[SHIMI]
I'm called Shimi.

96
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,958
I want to play a
little game with you.

97
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,583
Oh, a little game?

98
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:23,041
[SHIMI]
I challenge you to a duel.

99
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:26,541
I'll wait for you on Monkoku
Hill tomorrow at noon.

100
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,416
Bring any weapon you can carry.

101
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,333
If you refuse, I'll have
to kill your little friends.

102
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,333
[GENE]
Oh really? I don't think so.

103
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:34,625
[MELFINA gasps]

104
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,833
You waltz up here,
order me to come outside,

105
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,166
and then you challenge me?

106
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,875
Now I'm really pissed off.

107
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:43,083
Why don't we just
finish it right here?

108
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:54,041
You know, you're not
bad for a little guy.

109
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:57,500
[SHIMI] I always try to fight
fair no matter who I deal with.

110
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,500
That's interesting. You don't
look like the honest type to me.

111
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:03,750
[SHIMI] You've killed far too
many of us. Now I must end it.

112
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:06,583
I'll make a name for
myself by killing you.

113
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,333
That suits me just fine.

114
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:10,041
At least you'll be
known for somethin'.

115
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,083
[SHIMI]
You better believe it.

116
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,791
[SHIMI]
You just got lucky today.

117
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:19,125
But don't expect to
be lucky tomorrow.

118
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,875
I'm not like those
other careless punks.

119
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:24,833
Oh, is that right?
So who exactly are ya then?

120
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:28,375
[SHIMI]
I'd rather keep that to myself.

121
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:32,500
But if you beat me tomorrow,
then I'll tell you.

122
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:35,958
If I'm still alive.

123
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,208
So, Gene, are you gonna go?

124
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,708
[GENE]
Oh yeah.

Yeah, sure. What's to know?

out for a drink.

Mh-hm.

But to be perfectly honest,

compared to a Ctarl,
he's not nearly as tough.

a drink all by yourself?

00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:09,208
[WOMAN]
Yeah, right.

160
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:12,125
That's a thought. I wonder if
there'll ever be a next time.

161
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:17,291
[MAN chuckling]

162
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,416
Hey, what the hell's
so funny, mister?

163
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,291
Forget it. I apologize.

164
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,916
Couldn't help but overhear
what you were saying there.

165
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,791
And lookin' at you
sittin' like that,

166
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:28,333
it sure does remind me of
myself when I was younger.

167
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:29,583
Aw, jeez...

168
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,375
Old people are always
sayin' things like that.

169
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:34,416
[MAN] Ah, hey, come on.
Just listen for a minute.

170
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,333
Whaddya say you and I have a
friendly little drink together

171
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:40,500
and we'll call ourselves
representatives of humanity?

172
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,000
Why not?

173
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,416
No matter what I do, seems
like every human on this planet

174
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,000
wants to drink with me tonight.

175
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:48,250
Maybe you should listen to what
your elders have to say, uh...

176
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,250
Um...

177
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,250
My name's Gene Starwind.

178
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:53,250
[MAN]
I know when you're young,

179
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:54,625
ya gotta be a smart-ass

180
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,583
even though you can't
necessarily do anything

181
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:59,166
to back it up.

182
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,666
[GENE] You sure got a harsh way
of lookin' at things, don't ya.

183
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,500
[MAN]
The name's Leilong.

184
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,250
Nice to meet ya.

185
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,041
[GILLIAM]
All systems of the <i>Outlaw Star</i>

186
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,791
are functioning normally.

187
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:13,958
Well I guess he really
didn't plan anything at all.

188
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,833
I'll tell ya, I don't
know about this.

189
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,583
Does that mean it's gonna
be a fair fight or what?

190
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,000
[GILLIAM]
Well, Jim,

191
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:23,875
perhaps they are afraid of
my foolproof guard system.

192
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,500
Must be nice. Machines
don't have any worries.

193
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:27,916
[GILLIAM]
Excuse me, Jim,

194
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,291
what did you mean by that?

195
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,333
Let me see. For you
to understand,

196
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,458
I'd have to do a major
up-grade on ya.

197
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,166
[GILLIAM]
So in other words,

198
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,166
you need money.

199
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,333
We need money to
service the ship.

200
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:41,291
Let's face it. We're
attacked by pirates.

201
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:44,291
Why does this keep
happening to us?!

202
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,958
[AISHA]
Melfina! What're you doing?

203
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,458
Get over here! I need your help!

204
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:49,083
[sighs]

205
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:49,916
[AISHA]
Mel!

206
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
[gaps] Coming!

207
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,083
This is a Ctarl-Catrl specialty.

208
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:58,708
Gejidabo stew!

209
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,791
Huh? Where's Gene?

210
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,500
Eat some of this and you'll
have the strength of five men!

211
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:05,083
[JIM]
Uh, wait a minute!

212
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:08,958
Is this safe for human beings to
actually eat and still survive?

213
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,583
Of course, you
pathetic human being!

214
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,916
Gejidabo stew has its
origins dating back

215
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,500
to year 1 of the Ctarl-Ctarl
calendar where--

216
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:18,791
[GENE] What I've been
trying to tell you

217
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,958
is that one of us is
gonna die tomorrow!

218
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,833
I suppose that you're right.

219
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:26,291
So listen, have you ever
been in a duel before?

220
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,875
Yeah, sure. I've had a few.

221
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,291
[chuckles] So you see,

222
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,333
ya lived through every
one of 'em, didn't ya?

223
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,291
I'm not making any excuses,

224
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,458
but let's just say at
the time I had no choice.

225
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:40,458
It was something I had to do.

226
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:45,291
In my own way, I show respect
for those who have died.

227
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,833
Respect. Respect.

228
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,083
[chuckles]

229
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,750
When you die, that's the
end of all it, right?

230
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:55,958
That's right. And living
means something to me.

231
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,750
That's why I'm still
alive to talk about it.

232
00:11:58,833 --> 00:11:59,458
[GENE]
Hmm.

233
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:00,916
Well, I know one thing.

234
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,541
I sure as hell don't feel
like losing; not right now.

235
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:06,416
Of course, that's what
they've all said.

236
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,291
Oh well. I'd better
call it a day.

237
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:12,833
You goin' already?

238
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:16,541
[LEILONG] I have to watch how
much I drink of this stuff.

239
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,583
Take care of yourself.

240
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:37,166
[footsteps]

241
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,125
[MELFINA]
Are you okay, Gene?

242
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,125
What the hell is
your problem, huh?

243
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:19,458
Is that "nice girl" routine
just somebody's program, too?

244
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,291
What were you made for?
Why are you here?

245
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,208
I don't know! I don't know!

246
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,666
Don't you remember you said that
we would find that out, Gene?

247
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:33,125
[MELFINA crying]

248
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,916
Aw, shit.

249
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,666
[GENE]
What the hell am I living for?

250
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:03,541
[SHIMI] To live... is to push
all of you others aside.

251
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,500
[GENE]
That may be.

252
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:10,083
[gunshot]

253
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,625
[SHIMI]
Sorry, Gene Starwind.

254
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:24,708
I still want to
live. That's all.

255
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:34,416
[inaudbile]

256
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,583
Tht may be the last egg
I ever get a chance to eat.

257
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,625
Cut it out. There's nothing
funny about tha-- Ow!

258
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,958
Yeah, it'd be better for all
of us if you didn't lose.

259
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,208
But if you happen to lose,

260
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,541
don't worry, I'll look
after everything for ya!

261
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,500
Will you get to work and
make us some money?

262
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:08,500
Hah. Anyway, give
it your best shot!

263
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:11,250
Man, that lady's got no tact.

264
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,000
Good morning.

265
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:13,291
[JIM]
Morning!

266
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,500
[JIM]
Gene, let's beat this guy.

267
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,583
Even it means fighting dirty.

268
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,000
[GENE]
You got it.

269
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,000
Fun's just gettin' started.

270
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,500
Didn't think you'd
get here early.

271
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:39,458
[SHIMI] It's not polite to keep
your guest waiting, now is it?

272
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,916
[GENE] I'll leave as soon as
possible, if you don't mind.

273
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,875
[SHIMI]
From this life.

274
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:46,875
[GENE]
Let's do it.

275
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,208
[SHIMI]
Fine.

276
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,500
[SHIMI]
Wait.

277
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:19,541
I-If you don't mind, I really
don't wanna leave behind

278
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,791
a pathetic looking corpse.

279
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,500
[LEILONG]
Just as I expected.

280
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:35,083
Looks like I'm the only one
who can take you on now.

281
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:37,083
That you, Leilong?

282
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,291
You do have a real
name, don't ya?

283
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,916
Leilong is my real name.

284
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,250
My trade name is Shimi.

285
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,833
[GENE] So this guy was
your flunky, is that it?

286
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,000
[LEILONG grunts]

287
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:49,208
[LEILONG]
He was more like a pupil really.

288
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:52,333
He didn't have any
talent, so he died.

289
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:53,833
That's all it amounts to.

290
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,250
Oh yeah?!

291
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,958
What does this amount to?

292
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,375
Jim!

293
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,083
[JIM]
That guy's shield is powerful!

294
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,916
Use a Caster!

295
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,083
Shit. Use my trump card already?

296
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,083
[JIM]
Are you hurt?

297
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,166
[GENE]
The bullet just grazed me,

298
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,916
but the impact cracked a rib.

299
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,916
It's slowin' me down a little.

300
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:24,750
Okay, sucker!

301
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:32,250
Got 'im!

302
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:33,583
Is he dead?

303
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:42,041
A Caster, huh? You have
some very interesting toys.

304
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:44,583
Eat this!

305
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,625
I didn't think it could
take a direct hit,

306
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:55,583
not from a Caster without
getting little damaged.

307
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,333
[GENE]
What is this guy?!

308
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,333
[GENE]
Game over.

309
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:08,458
I suppose I could
just let you walk away.

310
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,541
You just don't get it, kid.

311
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,125
When you've convinced yourself
that you have the upper hand,

312
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,708
ya leave yourself open.

313
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:18,125
Never let your guard down
until the fight's over.

314
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:30,333
[LEILONG] This is the end
of the line, Gene Starwind.

315
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,291
Good-bye, Gene.

316
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,041
[JIM]
Wait!

317
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,500
Gene and I are a team!

318
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:41,416
You fightin' him without a
handicap isn't fair at all!

319
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,958
[MELFINA]
And I think so, too!

320
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,333
Melfina, not you!

321
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,833
Gene's important to me!
I will not let you hurt him.

322
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,666
You understand?
You will not kill him.

323
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,958
If you're going
to take his life,

324
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,208
you're gonna have
to kill me first.

325
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:57,125
[LEILONG] Melfina, I couldn't
possibly kill you.

326
00:18:57,208 --> 00:19:00,541
Anyone else who stands in my
way, I will have to kill them.

327
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,250
[AISHA]
Hold it! Hold it right there!

328
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,541
I have to tell you
that if you kill him,

329
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:09,333
you'll be dealing with
Ctarl-Ctarl trouble.

330
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:11,166
[SUZUKA]
I'll act as his second, as well.

331
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,291
Gene's life is currently
in my keeping.

332
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,333
I would appreciate it if
you were not to take it.

333
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:18,208
Otherwise we can not be to sure
of the consequences, can we?

334
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:22,541
Well well. I see you
are good friends.

335
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:25,291
But you can't win;
you must realize that.

336
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,208
[AISHA]
I don't wanna hear that!

337
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:36,250
Aisha! Bastard!

338
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,125
[GENE]
Jim!

339
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:38,833
Run, you idiot!!

340
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,458
[JIM screams]

341
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,875
No!

342
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,500
[SUZUKA]
You'll pay for that.

343
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:48,791
Huh?

344
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,833
Suzuka.

345
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:07,666
I told you what would
happen, didn't I?

346
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,833
If I have to, I'll kill
anyone who tries to interfere.

347
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:13,250
You son of a--

348
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,500
Gene!

349
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:22,083
Well, it looks as
though you can't move.

350
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:25,833
That tends to makes the
challenge rather boring.

351
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:29,916
So then. What do ya
say to a one-shot fight?

352
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,625
[GENE] Sounds like
you're enjoying yourself.

353
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,916
[LEILONG]
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't.

354
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,166
But a job's a job.

355
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,250
Looks like we're ready.

356
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:56,958
Let us begin.

357
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,500
[MELFINA]
Gene!

358
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:05,708
Gene!

359
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,166
Gene!

360
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,458
Oh, Gene.

361
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,375
Where did he go?

362
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,791
[LEILONG chuckling]

363
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,458
[LEILONG]
So I'm finished, too.

364
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:25,708
I'm dying because
of a faulty gun.

365
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:28,333
Talk about bad luck.

366
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,541
You must try to survive them.

367
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:33,541
Must not let the
Anten Seven prevail.

368
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,833
What do you mean
the Anten Seven?

369
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:39,291
Now, there are six
of them after you...

370
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,250
[GENE]
A dud gun.

371
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,833
So my talent is just good luck.

372
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,208
And now everybody's dead.

373
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,541
That's too high
of a price to pay.

374
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,375
[JIM] You got that right,
Gene Starwind.

375
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:53,375
[BOTH gasp]

376
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,250
--Hey, Jim!
--[MELFINA] Jim!

377
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:58,166
Maybe this luck of yours
ain't so bad after all.

378
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,500
I agree.

379
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,625
It seems as though I need
to go back to training.

380
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,583
After eating that
Ctarl-Ctarl stew,

381
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:05,750
my whole system's been
thrown out of whack.

382
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,375
If I'm not mistaken, Suzu,

383
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:09,208
isn't that called
"shifting the blame"?

384
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:12,291
I would greatly appreciate it
if you didn't call me "Suzu."

385
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:13,208
[AISHA growls]

386
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:14,875
Gene! You better
not forget this!

387
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,416
That's another one you owe me!

388
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,958
Hurry up and solve the mystery
of the Galactic Leyline

389
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:21,083
and hand over the treasure
to me when you do!

390
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:23,625
Why do you suppose she keeps
saying things like that?

391
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:26,666
Maybe because the
lady's got no tact.

392
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:33,958
[JIM] He didn't kill us,
so maybe he was a good guy.

393
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:38,333
[GENE]
Good-bye, Leilong.

394
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:44,750
[HAZANKO]
Damn you, Shimi.

395
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:46,708
You were worthless.

396
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:50,208
[HITORIGA]
Please... leave it to us.

397
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:52,166
[HAZANKO]
Gene Starwind...

398
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:56,166
Now you have stirred
my curiosity.

399
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:59,041
I, Hazanko, want to meet you.

400
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:08,333
[LEILONG] Damn it. They sure
buried me deep enough.

401
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:16,708
Seeing all those people

402
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:20,041
made me start to get some
weird thoughts in my head.

403
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:24,583
[LEILONG] Maybe I'll have
to just treat myself

404
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:28,166
to becoming a
wandering Outlaw, too.

405
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:31,083
Good-bye, Gene.

406
00:25:05,291 --> 00:25:07,000
[GENE] A dangerous job
will always come along

407
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:09,041
no matter what line
of work you're in.

408
00:25:09,125 --> 00:25:10,875
Recovering a treasure
is one thing,

409
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:13,291
but you want me to
fight a space monster?

410
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:17,000
Here it comes! Here's the catch!
There's always a catch.

411
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:20,041
Huh? Fifty tons of Dragonite?

412
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:21,916
Five million wong?!

413
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,750
You got it! I'll do it!

414
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:25,083
Please, let me do it!

415
00:25:25,166 --> 00:25:27,208
Danger is no problem!

416
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:29,500
Next time on <i>Outlaw Star</i> :

417
00:25:29,583 --> 00:25:31,333
"Demons of the Water Planet"!

418
00:25:31,416 --> 00:25:32,916
You better get ready!
