1
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:01,333
[VOICE]
We shall test thy worthiness.

2
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:03,041
Present the maiden.

3
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:05,208
[HAZANKO]
She is here.

4
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:18,458
[VOICE]
It is the maiden.

5
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,041
[VOICE]
The Leyline is considering.

6
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:27,791
The Leyline will now
converse with the supplicant.

7
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,375
[VOICE, MELFINA] Thou who hast
come with the maiden,

8
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:39,458
tell me, what is thy desire?

9
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:40,833
[HAZANKO]
Power!

10
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:45,083
Immense power so absolute
that even the Tendo King

11
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,916
would have to bow before me

12
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,916
and allow me to
crush the emperor!

13
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,291
[VOICE, MELFINA]
That is thy desire?

14
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,666
[GENE]
Hey there. Hold on a minute!

15
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,625
At last.

16
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:05,166
I came for my
second place prize.

17
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,166
[HAZANKO]
Damn it! Gene Starwind!

18
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,750
Eat this!

19
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:23,250
[screaming]

20
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:28,083
Well. I'm the third
one after all.

21
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,750
How efficient of you.

22
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,833
Now I don't have to kill anyone.

23
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:36,750
[KHAN] So tell me, is the
Leyline the Akashic Record?

24
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,083
[VOICE, MELFINA]
It has that power,

25
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:41,000
however, its power
goes beyond that.

26
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:44,166
Oh. So it's the chi lines.

27
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,791
Causality can be
manipulated here.

28
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,291
Hence the name Leyline.

29
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,083
By manipulating the chi lines,

30
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,333
you manipulate the
factor we call "fate"

31
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:54,750
as if it were a physical law.

32
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:57,000
Can I finally learn
what I want to know?

33
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:59,125
Everything I want to know?

34
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,583
[VOICE, MELFINA]
I will answer all.

35
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:04,541
I will bestow all.

36
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:08,875
Gwen Khan!

37
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,166
This is my last shell.
Do you wanna taste it?

38
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,333
J-Just a moment!
Now just wait a minute!

39
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:18,916
If I'm not alive, you see--

40
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,333
If I die, everything that I've
learned will be lost forever.

41
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,041
Don't you understand?!

42
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,791
So this is the treasure
room, huh, professor?

43
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,708
[GENE]
Melfina, are you okay?

44
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,250
Melfina!

45
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:32,583
Gene.

46
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:36,291
How do I turn Melfina
back to the way she was?

47
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:37,708
Gene, wake up!

48
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,583
We've finally
reached the Leyline!

49
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:42,250
Aren't you happy?
Or at least curious?

50
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,166
Come, come! What is
it that you want?

51
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:48,458
Is it political power?
Or is it money? Information?

52
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:51,291
Nothing you can imagine
is unreasonable.

53
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,666
You can claim it. Anything!

54
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,083
Anything you want.

55
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:57,875
Everything you
want is right here.

56
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,625
Right now!

57
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:02,583
[VOICE, MELFINA] Thou who
hast come with the maiden,

58
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:05,416
what is thy desire?

59
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,041
Ahh...

60
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,458
What the...? What's that?

61
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,416
[HAZANKO]
I am Hazanko.

62
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,333
A Caster attack will
not work against me.

63
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:26,000
It is useless.

64
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,333
And I am Gene Starwind.

65
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:31,375
An Outlaw not in the habit
of listening to warnings.

66
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,208
I'm here to take back Melfina.

67
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,375
[laughs]

68
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:36,708
[HAZANKO]
You and your friends don't know

69
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,416
the first thing about her.

70
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,208
Using the secrets that
we have uncovered,

71
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:44,791
Melfina is a mere puppet
that we have created.

72
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,208
[MELFINA]
Huh?

73
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,583
Yes, yes, that's right.
That's quite right.

74
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:49,458
She's a puppet.

75
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:50,958
Shut up, Khan!

76
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:54,166
[HAZANKO]The Leyline Project
was founded a long time ago

77
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,458
through the secret wisdom
of the grave of the Dragon.

78
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,458
It produced a puppet
that would be the key

79
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,250
to entering the Leyline.

80
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,666
This puppet was to function

81
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,875
as a highly sophisticated
navigation system,

82
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,958
which would eventually unlock
the doors of the Leyline.

83
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,625
That puppet is none
other than, Melfina.

84
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,625
So I'm just a mere puppet?

85
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:13,708
[GENE]
That's enough!

86
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,500
You knew all along, Gene?

87
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:19,083
Melfina! The answer you
needed wasn't in your past.

88
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,916
The answer you were
looking for is...

89
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,625
[HAZANKO]
I'll give you that answer.

90
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:26,416
Melfina, you're nothing more
than a tool that we needed.

91
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,125
So you brought me
here because you knew

92
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,416
you could use me too, Gene?

93
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,208
No, I didn't!

94
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,416
[HAZANKO]
Oh, really?

95
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,625
This whole time
I've been your tool?

96
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:35,208
[HAZANKO]
That's it precisely.

97
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:35,916
He's lying!

98
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,458
[HAZANKO]
Absurd!

99
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,625
[yelling]

100
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,458
Gene!

101
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:58,250
[screaming]

102
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:03,666
[VOICE]
Danger. Danger.

103
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,666
They are dead. They are dead.

104
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,250
Return them. Return them.

105
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,250
[TOBIGERA] It's already
been almost 24 hours

106
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,416
since Lord Hazanko set out.

107
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,791
I can't believe that no one
has contacted the ship.

108
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,583
Gilliam, has there been
any word from Gene yet?

109
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:30,375
[GILLIAM] I'm sorry, but I've
received no word at all.

110
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:33,291
Jim, let's just try to
remain calm and wait for him.

111
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,500
That's right, Suzuka.
Just try and stay calm.

112
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,833
Stay calm. Stay calm.

113
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,041
[screams]

114
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,250
How can I stay calm
at a time like this?!

115
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,458
[HARRY]
Hey, Ron. Are you awake?

116
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,083
[RON]
Harry, is that you?

117
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,708
[HARRY]
Not in the flesh.

118
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:54,375
I've now been the <i>Shangri-La</i> 's
mainframe computer.

119
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,958
I made a backup just in
case something happened.

120
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:59,083
Almost as good as
my original, huh?

121
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:00,333
[RON]
Amazing.

122
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,666
I was able to track down
the sensors in your body

123
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,750
and bring you back
here to recuperate.

124
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,000
You're badly hurt, Ron,

125
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:08,541
so I'm afraid you'll be
in there for a while.

126
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,666
But whatever happened
to my original?

127
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,041
Do you know?

128
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:15,000
[RON] Something too
horrible to mention.

129
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:18,583
Harry, let's pull out for now.

130
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:21,125
But this isn't over yet, is it?

131
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:24,208
[HARRY] No, it isn't.
Not by a long shot.

132
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,333
We'll show 'em what happens

133
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,750
when you cross the
MacDougall Brothers.

134
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,375
[RON]
The MacDougall Brothers, huh?

135
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,958
[GENE]
Gene Starwind.

136
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,791
[MELFINA]
Melfina.

137
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:58,875
[HAZANKO]
Hazanko.

138
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,500
[KHAN]
Gwen Khan.

139
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,208
[JIM]
Gene.

140
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:17,000
Gene! Gene!

141
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,458
Gene.

142
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,083
Melfina.

143
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,500
Gene, I'm now
connected to the will

144
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,583
and desires of the
Galactic Leyline.

145
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:53,166
Hazanko's Tao magic and
your Caster's power

146
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,416
have somehow reacted and
cancelled each other out

147
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,708
and we've all
ceased functioning.

148
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,291
Are we're dead then?

149
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:03,208
[MELFINA] The answer to
that is both yes and no.

150
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,666
The will of the Leyline
is keeping us alive

151
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,458
in a different location.

152
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:08,875
In my current state,

153
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,708
I can explain to you what
the Galactic Leyline is.

154
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:16,041
It's like a galactic library
left by a now-extinct race

155
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,083
that possessed a highly
advanced understanding

156
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,166
of science and technology.

157
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,666
However, to humanity,

158
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,458
we may think of it as
being like a machine God.

159
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,125
After you've finished
healing yourself

160
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,708
and return to reality,

161
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:31,208
the Leyline will probably
grant your every desire.

162
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,291
Are you saying that
this isn't reality?

163
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:34,958
This is data.

164
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:43,416
Is this cyberspace?

165
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,000
Hello, Gene.

166
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,750
Thanks to you, I've learned
what I wanted to know.

167
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,208
Now I have the answers
to my questions.

168
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:54,958
Well, goodbye then.
I am data, and data's me.

169
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:57,916
Goodbye. Goodbye.

170
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,125
He makes absolutely no sense.

171
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,000
This is the data repository.

172
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,875
Professor Khan's
objective must have been

173
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,958
to gain as much
knowledge as possible.

174
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,708
Gene, is there
something you desire?

175
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:09,916
Say it.

176
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,333
By using the Leyline,
I can grant anything

177
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:15,083
that your heart desires
and make it real.

178
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,083
Gene.

179
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,083
There isn't anything that
the Leyline can give me.

180
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,916
All I really want is for
you to return with me.

181
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,375
Gene.

182
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,500
Oh no, I made you cry again.

183
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:34,083
Melfina, what is it
that you wish for?

184
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,291
I want to stay who I am.

185
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:40,291
I want to be with
you forever, Gene.

186
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,541
Well that's what I want, too.

187
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:52,458
Then come away with me, Melfina.

188
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:53,750
Right now.

189
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,041
Yes.

190
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:55,541
Huh?

191
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:56,750
What is it?

192
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:59,083
Hazanko is preparing
to leave here right now.

193
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,750
He has all the power
that he wished for!

194
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:05,291
If we don't stop him, the entire
universe will be in danger.

195
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:06,708
What should we do?

196
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,083
We'll join forces. I'll combine
my powers with yours,

197
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,666
and then we'll fight
him to the death!

198
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,666
[HAZANKO]
I finally have it!

199
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,208
Power! Power!

200
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,375
What's happening now?

201
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,208
What the heck?! Hey!

202
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,916
[GILLIAM]
Oh, my! What in the world?!

203
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:54,916
[MELFINA]
Systems all green.

204
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,333
[ALL gasp]

205
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,208
[MELFINA] Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to surprise you.

206
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,250
Gene, I'm over here.

207
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,083
What happened, Gene?

208
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,583
Don't worry,

209
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,666
I'll fill you in on the all
the magic soon enough, Jim.

210
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,250
<i>Outlaw Star</i> ,
get ready to launch!

211
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,958
[JIM]
It's a miracle, isn't it?

212
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,916
[GENE'
Yeah, must be. I met God.

213
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,458
[MELFINA]
Gene, we're currently linked

214
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,500
directly to the
Galactic Leyline.

215
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:21,583
Now's the time to free your mind
and fight with all you've got.

216
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,625
You should be much
stronger than usual.

217
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:26,208
That's a roger. Let's do it!

218
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:48,291
You'll pay. I'll make you pay!

219
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,833
Gene Starwind!

220
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:56,708
Bastard!

221
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,000
[yells]

222
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,750
Damn you!

223
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,166
[chuckles]

224
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:02,166
[screaming]

225
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,625
[laughs]

226
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,416
I don't know why I'm
wasting time like this

227
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,458
when I can absorb you
directly into myself.

228
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,375
[MELFINA] Gene. Remember,
we're not alone anymore.

229
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:15,000
Together! Work together!
Wake up, Gene!

230
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:17,416
[JIM, SUZUKA, AISHA]
Gene!

231
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,291
Okay.

232
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:20,666
What the...?

233
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,208
[GENE yells]

234
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,958
Die!

235
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,166
[GENE yells]

236
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,583
[screams]

237
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,958
[FEMALE VOICE]
Melfina. Melfina. Melfina.

238
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm glad we could meet, Melfina.

239
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,583
Who are you?

240
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:01,125
The Galactic Leyline is going
to be moved to a new location.

241
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:04,000
I'm going with it, so I came
to say goodbye to you.

242
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:06,208
You're me, aren't you?

243
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:09,208
Right. I'm the "you" that's
the maiden of the Leyline.

244
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:10,958
You don't need
me anymore, right?

245
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:13,625
After all, you know how to
take care of yourself now.

246
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,750
And you know how you can
give your heart wings.

247
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,375
Isn't that right, Melfina?

248
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:20,666
Yes. Yes, thank you.

249
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,708
Goodbye.

250
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,375
Farewell.

251
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:56,000
[SWANZO] "Pioneer" McCoy.
"Grim" Lotus. "Hot Ice" Hilda.

252
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,541
When an Outlaw
gets a reputation,

253
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,708
they really get a
nickname that fits them.

254
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:03,500
Hm, I wonder what would be
a good one for that kid.

255
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,458
How about, "I'll Pay You
When I Make it Big" Gene?

256
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,083
[SWANZO] No, that's a
little over the top.

257
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,875
Now that you mention it, I hear
he's back on Sentinel III

258
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,458
getting into all
kinds of trouble!

259
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,041
Hey, Clyde, guess what?

260
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,583
I heard that Gene's
come back to Sentinel III.

261
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,583
How come he hasn't come in yet?

262
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,916
I'm not sure. Good question.

263
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:30,250
[COP] All right, get out,
Gene Starwind.

264
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,916
[JIM]
I'm not surprised.

265
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,291
[GENE]
Damn.

266
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:34,583
I can't believe they haven't
forgotten about that.

267
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:35,791
[JIM] Just be thankful
you're gettin' off

268
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,416
with a 200 thousand wong fine.

269
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,666
You really trashed the
spaceport's equipment.

270
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,500
That's because we were attacked
by those pirates, remember?

271
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:45,750
Anyway, I hear the air
traffic controller was in on it.

272
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:49,166
That's why you're getting
off with just a fine.

273
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,583
The law's the law.

274
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,833
Yeah, and a crime is a crime.

275
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:56,208
Hmm. Hey, where did you
get the 200 thousand from?

276
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,083
Same place as always.

277
00:18:58,166 --> 00:18:59,958
He lent us what we
needed to resupply,

278
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:02,041
but he wants to hear how
we're planning to repay him.

279
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,291
So what's the plan?

280
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,708
A crime is a crime.

281
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,250
If he can't wait
until we hit it big,

282
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,250
then we'll just have
to skip town on him.

283
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,291
Hit it big, huh?

284
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,250
[FRED]
I can't believe Twilight Suzuka

285
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,458
has been traveling with Gene

286
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:17,333
all this time
without me knowing.

287
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:18,666
[SUZUKA]
Don't worry about it.

288
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,708
My employer can't seem to
get together enough cash

289
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,250
to pay my fee,

290
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,583
so there's no longer any reason
for me to try to kill you.

291
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:27,291
Actually, I had a little
something to do with that.

292
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,041
So, stayin' on with him? Well?

293
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,666
Gene says that he's
going to be heading out

294
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,000
for the Oracion system,
but I've already been there,

295
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:37,333
so I think I'll decline and
weigh out my other options.

296
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:39,458
I'm gonna try to make
ends meet here somehow

297
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,583
until the empire gives me
the free ride home

298
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,166
they promised me.

299
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:47,125
[JIM]
Hey, Fred! Are the parts loaded?

300
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:49,125
They were loaded
a long time ago.

301
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:52,833
This brings my loan to you
to about 1.6 million wong.

302
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:55,333
Send the payment
claims to that loser.

303
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:57,625
[FRED]
Speaking of which, where's Gene?

304
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,208
[JIM]
Oh.

305
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,416
He's out seeing someone.

306
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,750
[GENE]
Who's the bouquet for?

307
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,708
For everyone who died
because of the Leyline.

308
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:21,250
It's the least I could do.

309
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,708
That's nice.

310
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:32,791
[gasps]

311
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:35,041
Hey, don't forget what
happened to you back there.

312
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:37,333
You are you, you know?

313
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:41,000
Don't worry,
I haven't forgotten.

314
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:44,500
I know I'm still me.
That's all I need to know.

315
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:58,041
[BOTH laughing]

316
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:02,583
Hey.

317
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,208
Whaddaya say we
get outta of here?

318
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:05,791

Sure.

321
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:04,458
<i>Outlaw Star</i> now
ready for liftoff!

322
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:57,708
Damn it, how the hell
could we break down

323
00:23:57,791 --> 00:23:59,791
in the middle of
nowhere like this?

324
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:02,500
Because we keep cutting corners
on our maintenance bills.

325
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:04,708
[GILLIAM] It seems that the
parts replacement and repairs

326
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:06,500
have been completed.

327
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:08,083
[WORKER]
The repairs are all done.

328
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:09,458
Just sign here please.

329
00:24:09,541 --> 00:24:11,375
Yeah. Fine.

330
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:14,458
[WORKER]
Okay, that's everything.

331
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:15,625
Bon voyage for now.

332
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:18,000
Yeah, right. Thanks a lot.

333
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:20,583
[WORKER] It'll be nice and
quiet on the way back.

334
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:27,083
Well, whaddaya say we get goin'?

335
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,000
Huh?!

336
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:29,250
Suzuka!

337
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:30,791
Aisha!

338
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:33,500
What're you two doin' here?

339
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:35,416
I've already been to
some of these places,

340
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,375
but it may prove more
interesting with you people.

341
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:40,791
We hitched a ride with
the repair shop guy.

342
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:42,291
And when I thought about it,

343
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:44,916
you guys still owe me for
all of those times I saved ya.

344
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,958
Until you guys pay
me back in full,

345
00:24:47,041 --> 00:24:49,375
I don't think it's going too
far to say that your ship

346
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:52,041
and all of its
equipment belongs to me!

347
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:54,166
All right, fine. Ya got me.

348
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,000
[JIM chuckles]

349
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:59,750
[GILLIAM] If everybody is ready,
I'll prepare to get us underway.

350
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:01,791
[MELFINA]
Systems all green.

351
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,166
<i>Outlaw Star</i> now
ready to launch!

352
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:06,000
[JIM, SUZUKA, AISHA]
Roger!

353
00:25:11,291 --> 00:25:15,625
[NARRATOR] Gene Starwind. Native
of planet Earth, Outlaw, Age 20,

354
00:25:15,708 --> 00:25:19,291
His partner is Jim Hawking,
age 11. Computer Engineer.

355
00:25:19,375 --> 00:25:20,958
Additionally,
it has been confirmed

356
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:22,791
that his navigator is Melfina.

357
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:25,583
Rumor has it that he is
accompanied by an assassin

358
00:25:25,666 --> 00:25:29,625
who goes by the name of Suzuka,
and a Ctarl-Ctarl named Aisha,

359
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:31,541
but until we have
more information,

360
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:33,666
this remains unconfirmed.

361
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,875
His ship is called
the <i>Outlaw Star</i> .

362
00:25:35,958 --> 00:25:38,791
For a new Outlaw, yet to
earn a name for himself,

363
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:41,166
his reputation
precedes him.

364
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,875
However, the nickname
he earns for himself.

365
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:47,875
will depend upon the effects
of his future actions.
