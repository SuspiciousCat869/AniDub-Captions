1
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:20,041
[NARRATOR] Grappler arms
were originally manipulators

2
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:22,000
that were attached to EVA craft.

3
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,375
At first, it was
the Chinese pirates

4
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:27,708
that put the arms' abilities
to new and devious uses.

5
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:30,333
After the Chinese transports
carried Dragonite

6
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:31,750
from planet to planet,

7
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:34,250
the pirates began to
attack their own craft

8
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,250
with surprising intensity.

9
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:37,875
To the pirates of the era,

10
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:40,500
arms symbolized the
strength of their ships,

11
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,666
and before long
they incorporated

12
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,541
the arms into their
attack methods.

13
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:46,666
The Federation Space
Forces became

14
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,458
extremely irate with
this situation,

15
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:52,250
and began developing
Grappler arms of their own,

16
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:54,291
bragging that they
planned to formally equip

17
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:57,333
Space Forces fighters with
them in the near future.

18
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,916
They would be a force
to be reckoned with.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,791
Because of the complicated
manner in which space fighters

20
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:05,708
used these Grappler arms,
space combat was

21
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:09,833
clearly impossible without
the aid of powerful computers.

22
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:11,833
The combination of Grappler arms

23
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:15,166
and potent computers savagely
pushed human physical

24
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,583
and mental capacity
to their limits,

25
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:21,250
and those who survived battle
were spoken of with respect.

26
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:24,625
They were known as "Grapplers."

27
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,041
[HORUS] We have entered the
same orbit as the asteroid.

28
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:12,708
All right, I'm gonna take us in.

29
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,583
Okay, guys, we're goin' over.

30
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:58,500
[JIM]
Whoa...

31
00:03:58,583 --> 00:03:58,916
[GENE gasps]

32
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,291
Awesome!

33
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,250
So, this is it.

34
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:08,791
[MELFINA]
Uh...

35
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:14,916
That's it... the XGP15A-II.

36
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,875
A special ship, built
with the Pirate's brains

37
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,708
and the Space
Forces' technology.

38
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,458
[HILDA]
Come on, let's go!

39
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:27,041
Uh, hey! Wait a minute!

40
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,250
Don't just leave us here!

41
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,291
Aw, poor little boy.

42
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,833
I'll hold your hand
if you want me to.

43
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,583
Lay off, will ya!

44
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:41,125
The XGP... 15A-II.

45
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:42,583
Melfina, come!

46
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,250
I'm coming!

47
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,916
Check it out!

48
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
These controls
are pretty unusual.

49
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:04,500
[HILDA] Like I told you,
this ship is pretty special.

50
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,458
What's that, Hilda?

51
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,000
[HILDA]
It's an alarm clock.

52
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,708
You mean to tell me, the pirates
and the Space Forces

53
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,500
worked together to
build this thing?

54
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,041
The pirates couldn't
have developed

55
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,875
this ship on their own.

56
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:21,291
They used money and connections
to get Space Forces to sign on.

57
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,208
But, what in the world
are you doing with a ship

58
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:24,750
that's hidden in
a place like this?

59
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,125
[HILDA] It's here because
I swiped it from them.

60
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,541
Wow, I'm impressed!

61
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,625
You managed to get on the
bad side of the pirates

62
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:31,875
and the Space Forces!

63
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,750
[HILDA]
I owed 'em one.

64
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,583
[JIM]
Wow!

65
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,416
[clears throat]

66
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,708
[GENE]
Hm? Hey, What was that sound?

67
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,750
[GILLIAM] Good morning
and good day to you,

68
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,750
Ladies and, of
course, gentlemen.

69
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,166
[GENE]
Who are you?

70
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,916
[GILLIAM] I am myself, but
it is inappropriate for me

71
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,291
to subjectively define who I am.

72
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:13,041
I lack the means to test the
veracity of any such definition.

73
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:15,708
And the restraints therefore,
have been placed within me

74
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:18,333
restricting such a thought.

75
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,375
What the hell kind
of answer is that?

76
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:23,541
[GILLIAM] The only answer I
have in regards to myself is

77
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,750
that the name that I have been
granted is "Gilliam II,"

78
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,250
and that I have
been authorized

79
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,375
with the maintenance
of this vessel.

80
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,833
Hey! He's the ship's
computer, Gene.

81
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,875
Yeah? Well, why
didn't he say so?

82
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:37,958
[GILLIAM] Incidentally, just
who might you gentlemen be?

83
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,833
They happen to be
the ship's crew.

84
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:43,125
[GILLIAM]
One moment, please.

85
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,708
[GILLIAM] Oh, dear.
There seems to be a problem.

86
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:49,291
It appears there is
nothing regarding this

87
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,666
that has been recorded
in my memory.

88
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,916
Of course not.

89
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,625
You've just recently
been activated.

90
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,083
Just start from now.

91
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,166
[GILLIAM]
One moment, please.

92
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,625
[GILLIAM]
It appears part of my

93
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:05,041
personal service regulations
file has been deleted.

94
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,916
Shall I attempt to recover it?

95
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,666
No, that's not necessary,
we are the crew.

96
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,416
Obey the orders of the crew.

97
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,625
[GILLIAM]
Understood.

98
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:13,833
As it stands,

99
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:16,500
I have no authority to
run a search on you.

100
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,166
This is really tickin' me off!

101
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,625
Just launch the stupid
ship, Gilliam!

102
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,291
Do it right now!

103
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:25,083
[GILLIAM]
Of course, sir.

104
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,083
Oh, my.

105
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,791
And who might this be?

106
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,416
Interesting.

107
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,791
Personnel recording complete.

108
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:36,083
However, currently, I am
unable to launch this vessel.

109
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,458
Say what?

110
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,125
Are you tryin' to
tell me you weren't

111
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,958
the ship's navigation computer?

112
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:44,416
[GILLIAM] I support all
systems of the XGP15A-II,

113
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,250
except matters
pertaining to piloting,

114
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,166
they are outside my control.

115
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,000
Jim, what's with this guy?

116
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,041
Maybe everything's
done manually.

117
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:55,333
[GILLIAM]
No, that's unlikely.

118
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,333
Melfina will handle it.

119
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,125
--[JIM] Huh?
--[GENE] Huh? Melfina?

120
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,583
Did you say...?

121
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,250
You mean me?

122
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:05,041
That's right, Melfina.
She will assist you, Gilliam.

123
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,000
[GILLIAM]
Is that so?

124
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,458
Then it is understood.

125
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:08,958
What's understood?

126
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,166
[GILLIAM]
That you are this ship's crew.

127
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,625
Aww! This is driving me insane!

128
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:16,541
Gilliam, report the ship status.

129
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:17,875
[GILLIAM]
Navigation is possible,

130
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:20,208
but all equipment
is not on board.

131
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,000
[HILDA]
Just so long as you can fly.

132
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,041
[GILLIAM] Crew furnishings
have not been loaded

133
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:27,500
and food stores are limited
to 10 emergency packs.

134
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:31,083
Furthermore, the
XGP15A-II has not yet

135
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,750
been appointed a designation.

136
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,208
No name, huh?

137
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:37,041
How 'bout "Genius James"!

138
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:37,583
[groans]

139
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:38,250
Give it a rest.

140
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,375
The ship's name is--

141
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,500
[beeping]

142
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:41,541
[HORUS]
This is Horus.

143
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,208
Hilda, it's that pirate ship.

144
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,500
Distance, 6,000.

145
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,333
It can't be!

146
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,750
Impossible!

147
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,458
[HORUS] Magnetic aberrations
and enemy ship's

148
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,458
Tao field delayed detection.

149
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,375
It's closing in fast.

150
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:05,166
All right, Gene, I want you and
the others to launch this ship.

151
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,208
But what about you?

152
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,791
Horus and I will intercept them.

153
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,000
Wouldn't it be better for
all of us to go together?

154
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,125
I don't want the
ship to be stolen.

155
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,291
Melfina knows how to pilot it.

156
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,458
Do it!

157
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,291
Come on, I've felt
like puking for hours!

158
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,375
Quit your whining!

159
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,375
[MELFINA]
Uh...?

160
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,541
[GENE groans] Looks like
I've got no choice...

161
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:24,958
Gilliam, prepare to launch!

162
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,125
[GILLIAM]
Very well, Gene.

163
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,833
Please sit in the pilot's seat.

164
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:29,458
Okay!

165
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,125
Uh, what about me?

166
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,375
[GILLIAM]
Over there, Melfina.

167
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,916
I suppose I should sit here?

168
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,625
[GILLIAM]
That's fine, James.

169
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:43,083
Call me Jim.

170
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,541
Okay, Gilliam, what now?

171
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,375
[GILLIAM] Holding for
Melfina to get ready.

172
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,000
I'll display the control manual,

173
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,125
so please read it
while you're waiting.

174
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,666
What's he mean?

175
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,708
What the heck kind
of system is that?

176
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:05,041
Your guess is as good as mine!

177
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,125
[HORUS]
I am unable to determine

178
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,291
how the enemy ship
tracked us here.

179
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,791
Some Tao spell.

180
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,083
How are the engines?

181
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,916
[HORUS]
Ether drive Engine is active.

182
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,875
Shall I release the anchor?

183
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,291
They're only after
the XGP and Melfina.

184
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,541
They won't do anything drastic.

185
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:24,291
Ammunition?

186
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,333
[HORUS]
34% remaining.

187
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,916
We'll attack from right here.

188
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,416
[MELFINA]
Connecting.

189
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,583
Connecting.

190
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:42,333
Connecting. Connecting.

191
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,541
Connecting...

192
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:47,041
Connecting.

193
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,333
[MELFINA]
Connection established.

194
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,375
I'll activate the engines.

195
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,583
[GENE] Hey! What the hell
is goin' on here?

196
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:04,000
Awesome! She's linked
up with the ship.

197
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:07,083
Well I think she nuts to get
naked at a time like this.

198
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,500
Uh, oh!

199
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:09,875
[MELFINA]
The engines are sealed!

200
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,541
We need access to them
now or they won't work!

201
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,208
Uh... Where do I, uh...

202
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,750
[GILLIAM]
The engine room, please.

203
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,333
The engine room?

204
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,541
[GILLIAM]
I'll show you the way.

205
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,708
[JIM]
Okay, I'll be right back!

206
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,208
[GENE]
Sure.

207
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,833
Man, this ship is
a royal pain...

208
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:28,250
[GILLIAM] It only appears
that way, at first.

209
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,458
You might think of it

210
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:32,041
as if it were still in
its plastic wrapper.

211
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,333
[GENE]
Has it been flight-tested?

212
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,958
[GILLIAM] The engine
itself has been tested,

213
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:38,250
but there is no record
of it having been tested

214
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,750
after installation.

215
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,166
Ohh, are you kidding me?

216
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,625
[MELFINA]
Bringing up all sensors.

217
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,541
[GILLIAM]
A ship outside is hailing us.

218
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,291
Shall I open a channel, Gene?

219
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,541
Patch her through, right away!

220
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,541
Gene, how much longer?

221
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,458
[GENE]
Don't ask me!

222
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:10,125
Just picked up a case
of termites, hurry!

223
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,875
[JIM]
Damn, these guys are anal!

224
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:20,125
[GILLIAM] I'm told it's a
Space Forces tradition.

225
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:32,166
[OLD MAN]
Oh. So that's it.

226
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,041
Let's go!

227
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:49,375
[GILLIAM]
Warning.

228
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,375
Intruders have entered the dock.

229
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:52,916
Say what?!

230
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:59,541
Lock all guns on Horus.

231
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:02,916
Once the XGP is secured,
fire at will.

232
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,958
Leave anchors and
accelerate slowly.

233
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:10,291
We'll rotate the asteroid
and use it as a shield!

234
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,875
[YOUNG GIRL]
Damn you, Hilda!

235
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,000
Trying to protect yourself
with the asteroid!

236
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,958
Separate Grappler Ship!

237
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,583
Take us to the sun side
of the asteroid!

238
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,208
Don't fire at random!

239
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:36,250
Split up and attack
him from all sides!

240
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:42,625
Ah!

241
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,958
Gilliam! How do I get
that gate open?!

242
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,291
[GILLIAM] I can have it
opened by remote, Gene.

243
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,875
Open it!

244
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,666
Gilliam, how's it coming?

245
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,625
[GILLIAM] Start-up
preparations are complete.

246
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,125
[GENE]
All right!

247
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,416
[MELFINA] Please start the
engines with the ignition key.

248
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,000
That's easy.

249
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,208
[GILLIAM]
Engines on-line.

250
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,666
Generators operational.

251
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,708
Switching power over from
sub-circuits to main.

252
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,500
[JIM screams]

253
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,000
We're lifting up!

254
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,750
[MELFINA]
All systems green.

255
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:27,166
Ether Drive Engine standing by.

256
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,416
All right. We'll launch
once that gate's open!

257
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,541
[GILLIAM]
Roger that.

258
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,750
Okay, then. Heh, heh.

259
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,041
Huh?!

260
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,208
What the hell?

261
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,625
What's the gate doing
pointed at the bad guys?

262
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:41,708
[OLD MAN]
Cut your engines.

263
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,291
[GENE, JIM]
Huh?!

264
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:46,166
[OLD MAN] If at all possible, we
want that ship left undamaged.

265
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,208
Hilda! We're in trouble here!

266
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,500
[HILDA]
I'm a little busy right now!

267
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,750
Release all anchors!

268
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:00,000
[groaning] Ah! Dammit!

269
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:03,000
We have you now, Hilda.

270
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Gilliam!

271
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,250
Where are the weapons?!

272
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,125
[GILLIAM] The Grappler
arms are operational,

273
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,625
but they have no weapons.

274
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:14,500
We're goin' out!

275
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,333
Uh! But we'll crash into 'em!

276
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,041
It's all right, I'll
come up with somethin'!

277
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,875
[GILLIAM] Please focus
on the task at hand.

278
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,833
That's an order!

279
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,750
[OLD MAN] They're going to
use their Grappler arms!

280
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:29,416
It will damage the ship,
but we have no choice.

281
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,583
Fire all anchors!

282
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:35,208
Ahh! Hurry, Gene, hurry!

283
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:39,041
Uh-oh! Shiit!

284
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,500
[OLD MAN]
What the hell?

285
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,125
What is that?

286
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,750
[MELFINA] I'm picking up
an object on sensors.

287
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:49,208
[GILLIAM] It's a thermonuclear
missile or shell.

288
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:50,708
Something of that nature.

289
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,791
What in the hell happened?

290
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:55,000
[PIRATE PILOT]
We're under attack, sir!

291
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,916
That's... That's
MacDougall's ship!

292
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,333
No! What is MacDougall doing?!

293
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,500
[GENE, JIM grunting]

294
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:10,083
But why are you doing
this, MacDougall?!

295
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:17,250
[HILDA]
What are you up to, MacDougall?

296
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:20,666
Hey, Hilda, it's been
a very long time.

297
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,208
You'll destroy the XGP!

298
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,916
[RON]
That's the general idea.

299
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,458
Die! Die! Die!

300
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:28,750
Die!

301
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,708
You have double crossed us!

302
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:38,083
As of now, our contract
with you has ended.

303
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,166
We're carrying out
a new contract now,

304
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,041
and that's all there is to it.

305
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:45,750
And that contract is
to wipe out the XGP.

306
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:49,958
[gasping]

307
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,666
[OLD MAN] At this rate,
we won't be able to escape

308
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,583
the star's gravity well!

309
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:56,166
Come back! Please! Hurry up!

310
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,791
Can you see what's
going on outside?

311
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:04,291
[GILLIAM] I'm not sure if the
dock's cameras are still active.

312
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,166
Hey, wait.
I know that ship.

313
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,125
I can't believe it. MacDougall.

314
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,375
All right, launch
the halcyon missile.

315
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:31,791
Yeah! Halcyon missile! [laughs]

316
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:37,750
This is my way of saying,
good-bye, "Hot Ice" Hilda.

317
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:42,625
That name of yours has caused us
plenty of unnecessary trouble.

318
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,916
Man, you know brother,
that's totally the waste.

319
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,500
It's okay, we don't
need the XGP.

320
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:01,208
Remember, we're the ones with
the fastest ship in the galaxy.

321
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:02,791
I meant Hilda.

322
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:05,250
Didn't you tell me that
she was really hot?

323
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,083
[RON]
Heh!

324
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,541
Sorry, she's not your type.

325
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:12,041
All right, let's go back
and report to our client.

326
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,166
[PIRATE PILOT] A gravity
catapult course around Farfallas

327
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,916
would put us too
close to a flare!

328
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,250
The ship will burn up!

329
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,583
Yes, I know that.

330
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:28,875
All engines max!

331
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,333
Hilda and MacDougall,
you will pay for this,

332
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,250
you damned Outlaws!

333
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,166
[HORUS] We are unable to escape
from Farfallas' gravity well.

334
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,250
Gene! Do you hear me? Come in!

335
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,875
Gene!

336
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:52,083
Gene, Melfina! Respond!

337
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,083
[yells]

338
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,333
[OLD MAN]
Huh? Hm...

339
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,166
[GILLIAM]
The ship is now in the clear.

340
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,583
[MELFINA]
Stabilizing attitude.

341
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:16,125
Once we're stabilized,
bring engines to full!

342
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,375
[GILLIAM]
If you do it all at once,

343
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:18,958
the engines may not
become stable.

344
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:22,291
What's more important here, the
engines or the whole damn ship?!

345
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:23,666
[GILLIAM]
Well, then. Feel free.

346
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,958
Let's rock!

347
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,000
What kind of ship is that...?

348
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:37,208
That ship has four
Unsen engines.

349
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:40,083
Very well, prepare for
close-quarters combat!

350
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,416
We'll board them
our Grappler arms!

351
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,166
Prep the lander for launch!

352
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,000
I'm going over!

353
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,041
[MELFINA]
Engine output, 81%.

354
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,916
We've exceeded Farfallas'
escape velocity.

355
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,125
Where's Horus?

356
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,041
Gene! The pirate ship! Look!

357
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,916
[JIM screams]

358
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,583
Don't mess with me, bastards!

359
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,250
[OLD MAN groans, screams]

360
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,583
Hilda! Come in!

361
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,375
Grab me!

362
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,250
[HILDA screams]

363
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,083
Hilda! No!

364
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,125
[GENE]
Hilda! Are you okay?!

365
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,375
Dammit!

366
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:35,625
I can't make it! You'll
have to come save me!

367
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:36,583
[GENE]
Come save you?

368
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,416
[HILDA]
Hurry up!

369
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,250
Well, can we do it, Melfina?

370
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:41,375
[MELFINA]
If we decelerate,

371
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,208
we'll drop below
escape velocity.

372
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,666
[GILLIAM]
And we can't accelerate now

373
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,500
because of that pirate ship.

374
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,500
If you don't do something,
we'll fall into the star.

375
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,916
C'mon, Gene, yank off
that wire, will ya?!

376
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,208
[HILDA]
Wait!

377
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:55,041
Listen, don't cut
that anchor yet.

378
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,750
Sorry, but I have to
leave you, Horus.

379
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:59,541
[HORUS]
I understand. Goodbye, Hilda.

380
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,375
Move on it, Hilda!

381
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:15,583
[MELFINA]
Increasing output.

382
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:19,458
85... 86... 87...

383
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:21,875
[YOUNG GIRL]
Hilda!

384
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,375
Huh?

385
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:28,958
[YOUNG GIRL chanting]

386
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,708
[chanting]

387
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,958
Help, Gene...

388
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,666
[YOUNG GIRL screams]

389
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,791
[HILDA screams]

390
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,333
Hilda, I'm coming,
hang in there!

391
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:48,458
[GILLIAM]
You mustn't.

392
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:51,083
We'll just fall into
Farfallas as well.

393
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:53,166
What about the ship's anchor?

394
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,166
[GILLIAM]
The distance is too great.

395
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,416
[GENE growls]
Damn it!

396
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,291
So there's nothing
they can really do...

397
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:04,500
Huh?

398
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:06,666
[YOUNG GIRL]
I won't let your people survive!

399
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:12,375
[chanting]

400
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,666
[gasps]

401
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,500
[YOUNG GIRL]
What're you doing?!

402
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,750
Do not interfere!

403
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,541
Do you still read me, Gene?

404
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,083
Just remember.

405
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:27,000
Outlaws never go down easy,
no matter what happens to them.

406
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:28,208
[teeth clenching]

407
00:22:58,041 --> 00:23:02,166
[GILLIAM] We have just exited
Farfallas' gravity well.

408
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:07,958
[JIM]
Gene...

409
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:10,916
[GILLIAM]
Gene, please lay in a course.

410
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:17,000
Before we do that, there's
something I've decided on.

411
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:19,500
[GILLIAM]
Yes, what is it, Gene?

412
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:22,375
I've decided to name the ship.

413
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:24,791
I'm calling it...

414
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:27,166
...the <i>Outlaw Star</i> !

415
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:07,666
[GENE] Ctarl-Ctarl comes
right at us out of nowhere!

416
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,583
Wait just a minute,
aren't you--

417
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:12,083
The poor little thing,
away from home

418
00:25:12,166 --> 00:25:14,291
and abandoned by her people.

419
00:25:14,375 --> 00:25:17,458
This girl Aisha's story is
such a sad and difficult one

420
00:25:17,541 --> 00:25:20,416
that I just find myself
moved to tears!

421
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,583
Yeah, right!

422
00:25:21,666 --> 00:25:24,041
You're barkin' up
the wrong tree, lady!

423
00:25:24,125 --> 00:25:26,916
Next time, on <i>Outlaw Star</i> :

424
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,958
"The Beast-Girl,
Ready To Pounce"!

425
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:32,166
You better get ready!
