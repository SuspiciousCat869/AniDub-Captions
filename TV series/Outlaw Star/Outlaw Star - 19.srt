00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:22,500
[NARRATOR] In contrast to
the National Space Forces,

2
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:25,458
there exists the Private
Security Forces.

3
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:29,416
Over centuries, humanity's
territory expanded rapidly,

4
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,083
and as various
interstellar states

5
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:34,416
and countries were formed,
the Space Forces were founded

6
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,541
to provide equal
protection for all.

7
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:41,375
However, in the vastness
of space, not all colonies

8
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:45,000
had access to its full
protection and resources.

9
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:47,708
This gave rise to the
Private Security Forces,

10
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:50,458
run by private enterprises.

11
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:54,083
The Security Forces are
comprised of security companies,

12
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:57,083
and top transportation
businessmen.

13
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:59,166
They protect
developing planets

14
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,500
and interplanetary trading
companies from pirate

15
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:05,708
and various kinds
of random trouble.

16
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:10,083
However, the enormous
contractual and upkeep expenses

17
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:13,458
are a source of trouble
for low income territories

18
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:16,125
on the open frontier.

on continuous control.

475
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,166
[GENE]
Okay.

476
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,791
[MELFINA]
Cut number four and number two!

477
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,791
Those things
aren't cheap, damn it!

478
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,375
Number three locked!

479
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:37,541
Yes! We got 'em!

480
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,791
[MELFINA] Taking control
of enemy computer.

481
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:42,750
How's this?

482
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,666
[MELFINA gasps]
Multiple missiles incoming.

483
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,875
From both sides at once.
Can you dodge 'em?

484
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,125
[MELFINA]
I can't dodge them all!

485
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,166
Twenty percent of
them will impact!

486
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,291
Come up with something!

487
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:53,875
[JIM]
You gotta gimme a sec!

488
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,500
[GENE]
It's all yours!

489
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,375
[screams]

490
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,875
What in the world's going on?

491
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,416
[chuckles]

492
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,583
I just sabotaged their mainframe
computer by remote control!

493
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,041
[AISHA]
You're a genius, Jim!

494
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,208
Way to go, buddy!

495
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,000
I couldn't have done
it without Melfina.

496
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,166
[MELFINA]
Two enemy ships coming in!

497
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,750
Only two anchors left,
isn't that right?

498
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,916
[MELFINA]
Launching numbers Five and Six.

499
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,666
We're going in!

500
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,875
Yeah! Eat this!

501
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,458
Your power's about
the same, huh?

502
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,875
[MELFINA gasps] The other
ship's coming in now!

503
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,291
[GENE, JIM grunt]

504
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:42,666
I think we're in trouble, Gene!

505
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,083
[GILLIAM]
Be careful, Gene!

506
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,958
I'm being accessed by the
enemy ships main computer.

507
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,416
[grunts]

508
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,041
Hey, what the...?

509
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,958
Looks like we made
it just in time!

510
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,250
It's that lizard!

511
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,625
Gene, it's okay.

512
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,708
Let us be the ones to handle
the carrier, all right?

513
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,083
Hey, boy. You said something

514
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,583
about there being three
powers that exist in space.

515
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,541
All right, then, step aside
and I'll show you

516
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:11,208
what the might of the
military's power looks like.

517
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,916
All ships,
commence your barrage!

518
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:30,000
Now that's impressive!

519
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,166
What 's the matter, boy?

520
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,916
Need me to finish
the job for you, too?

521
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,791
Ha! Watch me!

522
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:41,375
Now you die!

523
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,250
[VALERIA] We've returned the
ammunition we confiscated,

524
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:01,500
so all that's left
now is your job fee.

525
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,250
You'll take Dragonite, I hope?

526
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:05,500
That'll do just fine!
Thanks a lot!

527
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:06,875
[VALERIA]
One more thing...

528
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,500
Whaddaya mean "one more thing?"

529
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:10,916
Have you heard anything about
the military's involvement

530
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,208
in the core system developing
a Grappler Ship called "XGP"?

531
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,916
Just wondering.

532
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,250
[GENE]
Hm.

533
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:21,666
[DUUZ] Hm. Why don't you
just drop it, Valeria.

534
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,291
We didn't uncover any
counterfeit registry data.

535
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,000
Part of our information
was scrambled

536
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:28,250
because of those
pirates we ran into.

537
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:29,375
That's why I'm asking you

538
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:31,375
to just leave it at
that, understand?

539
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:34,041
[VALERIA]
Hmm. Okay, I see.

540
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:38,458
Well, it seems that this is
the pride issue, isn't it?

541
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:41,250
All right. You're forgiven.
You've saved face.

542
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:44,000
Okay, we're outta here!

543
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:45,541
You're free to go now.

544
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:47,791
Hunting treasure is not a crime.

545
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:50,791
I hope your dreams are always
as big as your heart, Gene.

546
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:51,750
Thanks, Valeria.

547
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:53,125
Remember, I owe you one.

548
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:55,958
You've been given your
filthy Dragonite, now leave!

549
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,958
But if I ever catch you
committing a crime,

550
00:22:58,041 --> 00:23:00,416
I'll take you down before
you know what hit you!

551
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,458
Well, I'll keep that in mind.

552
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:09,625
[VALERIA] Bon voyage Gene,
and crew of the Outlaw Star!

553
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:13,583
Stay strong! And true
to your dreams!

554
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:16,250
Let's go, Outlaw Star!

555
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:57,291
[JIM]
Hey, it's Jim Hawking here!

556
00:24:57,375 --> 00:24:59,041
I've always had to
be the reliable one,

557
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:01,083
because Gene can be a
little flaky sometimes.

558
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:04,208
But something tells me that love
is finally headed my way, too!

559
00:25:04,291 --> 00:25:05,875
What are people
living for anyway?

560
00:25:05,958 --> 00:25:08,625
To get all lovey-dovey
with someone, what else?!

561
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:11,583
Then they pledge eternal love
to each other while it lasts,

562
00:25:11,666 --> 00:25:13,083
and then they have
a major falling out

563
00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:14,791
and the wife goes
home to her folks!

564
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:16,541
Wait a minute,
that doesn't sound right.

565
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:19,875
Next time find out for
yourself on <i>Outlaw Star</i> :

566
00:25:19,958 --> 00:25:21,833
"Cats and Girl and Spaceships"!

567
00:25:21,916 --> 00:25:23,875
You better get ready!
