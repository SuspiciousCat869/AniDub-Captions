1
00:00:03,733 --> 00:00:05,533
Stella:
Ikki and I...

2
00:00:05,633 --> 00:00:07,500
have become lovers.

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:15,400
But it's been... two weeks,
and he hasn't done anything!

4
00:00:20,366 --> 00:00:21,433
(sighs)

5
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:23,466
You idiot...

6
00:00:25,466 --> 00:00:26,900
Mangetsu:
Five for five!

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,333
Victorious yet again:
Ikki Kurogane!

8
00:00:30,433 --> 00:00:33,600
The freshman falls!
Dominated by "The Worst One."

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,466
A moniker that just won't do
anymore folks!

10
00:00:36,566 --> 00:00:38,400
"Another One,"
the King of the Ring!

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,500
He is just... extraordinary!

12
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:16,300
Ikki:
What?

13
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,633
You wanna learn
swordsmanship from me?

14
00:02:18,733 --> 00:02:19,333
Oh yes!

15
00:02:19,433 --> 00:02:21,433
You are the strongest
swordsman in the class!

16
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:23,366
Since we have someone
like you around...

17
00:02:23,466 --> 00:02:26,400
Kagami:
We'd be crazy not
to take advantage of it!

18
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,100
Uhh... Ahhhh...

19
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,166
Mmm... Hmph!

20
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:32,066
Oh! Well I guess...

21
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:36,666
Ikki:
Okay... If I can be
useful to you, then I
don't mind teaching you.

22
00:02:36,766 --> 00:02:38,266
Oh, awesome!

23
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,800
"An exclusive!
The Invincible Another One..."

24
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,000
"Practicing in Paradise
with Hagun's Ikki Kurogane!"

25
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,200
Kagami:
That'll be
my next front page!

26
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,133
I see,
so that's why...

27
00:02:48,233 --> 00:02:49,800
Don't even
worry about it!

28
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,066
Okay so we can start
tomorrow‐ right?

29
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,266
Thank you very much!
Thank you very much!

30
00:02:54,366 --> 00:02:54,833
Mmm...

31
00:02:54,933 --> 00:02:57,533
Male Student 1:
Why do all the girls
think he's so awesome?

32
00:02:57,633 --> 00:02:58,666
Look at him‐ man...

33
00:02:58,766 --> 00:03:03,066
Don't get too proud of
yourself... F‐knight reject.

34
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:06,833
Hi everyone. Let's go ahead
and get started...

35
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:08,000
Today's final...

36
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,266
Bleeeeegh...

37
00:03:09,366 --> 00:03:10,000
No!

38
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,566
Whoa! Miss Yuri!

39
00:03:14,966 --> 00:03:16,766
You're too generous‐
you know.

40
00:03:16,866 --> 00:03:17,233
Hm?

41
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:20,166
Every one of those girls
is a talented blazer‐ too.

42
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,300
If you're going to teach them,
you're only creating

43
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,066
future competition
for yourself.

44
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,600
Yeah! I'd love
nothing more.

45
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,766
Really?

46
00:03:28,866 --> 00:03:30,333
If that's to
be the case...

47
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:32,600
then I say it's
worth training them.

48
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,400
Besides... bad things
can happen to them as well.

49
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,966
Ikki:
When they find themselves
in some kind of trouble...

50
00:03:40,066 --> 00:03:43,600
if there's a chance
that my advice may be able
to help them...

51
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,600
Then I'll do
whatever I can.

52
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,733
Like I said, you're
way too generous.

53
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:51,966
You might be right.

54
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:53,833
(gasps)
Hmph!

55
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:54,566
Stella?

56
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,366
I‐It's nothing.

57
00:03:57,233 --> 00:03:59,900
Really? Okay, then.

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,733
Uh, actually... it's been
2 weeks since we started
dating each other, right?

59
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:09,133
I thought maybe...
it's about time to...

60
00:04:09,233 --> 00:04:11,166
do something...
you know...

61
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:13,133
like lovers do?

62
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:15,266
You know‐ because
you and I are...

63
00:04:15,366 --> 00:04:18,700
(snoring)

64
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,566
Mmmm!

65
00:04:21,866 --> 00:04:25,266
Ikki:
You're doing great.
Hang on for 30 more seconds!

66
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:26,400
Y‐Yes!

67
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,500
Ikki sir? What exactly is this
training supposed to improve?

68
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,300
Balance... use of
your inner muscles...

69
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,933
...and the importance
of your core strength.

70
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:38,266
When you're
in a fight...

71
00:04:38,366 --> 00:04:40,833
you'll most often be putting
your weight on one leg‐

72
00:04:40,933 --> 00:04:42,166
not both.

73
00:04:42,266 --> 00:04:43,666
Ikki:
The Chinese Masters...

74
00:04:43,766 --> 00:04:46,466
used to call this the "error
of double pressure."

75
00:04:46,566 --> 00:04:49,166
If you stand with equal pressure
on both sides‐ you're stuck.

76
00:04:49,266 --> 00:04:50,866
Oh I see now!

77
00:04:50,966 --> 00:04:52,533
I mean‐ I don't
know what it means,

78
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:54,733
but I'm writing it
down word for word!

79
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,300
Well, that's, uh...

80
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,000
You look like you're having
an awful lot of fun‐

81
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,433
surrounded by
girls...

82
00:05:01,533 --> 00:05:03,633
You worthless
failed knight.

83
00:05:03,733 --> 00:05:05,366
This is
bullshit man!

84
00:05:05,466 --> 00:05:07,566
You're not
fooling any of us!

85
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,100
Who are you?

86
00:05:11,066 --> 00:05:14,200
Students:
(chattering at commotion)

87
00:05:15,966 --> 00:05:16,800
Heh, heh.

88
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,833
What do you guys
think you're doing?!

89
00:05:18,933 --> 00:05:20,033
Isn't it obvious?

90
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:22,800
We're gonna put this loser...
back in his place!

91
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,733
(battle cry)

92
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,466
Ikki no!

93
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,966
Damn you!

94
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:36,600
(struggling)
(gun jamming)

95
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,033
Shit! What the fuck?!

96
00:05:40,266 --> 00:05:41,100
Ah!

97
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:44,500
(whimpers)

98
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,833
Uhh... ah...

99
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:51,033
Deploying your device
in an undesignated area...

100
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:53,100
is against school rules.

101
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,233
We're sorry, Sir!

102
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,033
Huh?

103
00:05:56,133 --> 00:05:57,466
What lame bad guys!

104
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:00,133
You should say:
"We'll get you next time!"

105
00:06:00,233 --> 00:06:02,333
and then laugh maniacally
as you run away!

106
00:06:02,433 --> 00:06:04,466
Don't you guys
watch any movies?!

107
00:06:04,566 --> 00:06:07,433
Well... would that
actually be a good thing?

108
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,766
We're sorry! We were just
so envious of you sir!

109
00:06:10,866 --> 00:06:12,600
You're so
strong man!

110
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,166
And all the
girls like you!

111
00:06:14,266 --> 00:06:16,100
I wanna be
strong like you!

112
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,933
I want girls
to like me!

113
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:20,766
Will you please teach
us too‐ Mr. Kurogane?

114
00:06:20,866 --> 00:06:21,966
Please!

115
00:06:22,066 --> 00:06:22,600
(annoyed sign)

116
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,500
You guys are really
crappy bullies...

117
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,800
Of course I will!

118
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,700
Stand up and balance on one foot
like everyone else...

119
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,533
Huh?

120
00:06:30,633 --> 00:06:32,100
Master! As you command!

121
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,666
Really? Master...?

122
00:06:33,766 --> 00:06:37,533
Extraordinary!
Even the worst bullies
are immediately reformed.

123
00:06:37,633 --> 00:06:40,233
This is the revolutionary
Kurogane Method!

124
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,433
I'll bet I could make big money
if I sold this online.

125
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:45,266
Heh.

126
00:06:45,366 --> 00:06:47,233
Female Student:
E‐excuse me...?

127
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,333
We know you're busy‐
Master Kurogane,

128
00:06:49,433 --> 00:06:51,400
but could you
teach us too?

129
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,400
Mmm‐hmm!

130
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,766
Please join us!

131
00:07:01,433 --> 00:07:04,266
Stella:
Your "class" is getting
really big, Ikki.

132
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:06,433
Ikki:
Yeah, I guess it is...

133
00:07:06,533 --> 00:07:10,533
But unlike me‐ they all have
seriously formidable abilities.

134
00:07:10,633 --> 00:07:12,533
If I can help improve
their swordsmanship,

135
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:16,166
even just a little,
they'll all be very powerful.

136
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:19,666
Hey, Ikki?
Aren't you thirsty?

137
00:07:19,766 --> 00:07:21,133
Actually,
yeah I am.

138
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:23,600
Are you?
Okay then...

139
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,133
Shizuku:
Big Brother!

140
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:27,100
Ikki:
Shizuku!

141
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,533
Aren't you such
a lucky guy?

142
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:31,800
Your very loving and
devoted little sister

143
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,533
brought you
something to drink!

144
00:07:34,866 --> 00:07:36,433
Here you go,
Big Brother!

145
00:07:36,533 --> 00:07:38,666
Thank you.
That was nice.

146
00:07:39,266 --> 00:07:39,766
Huh?

147
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,233
So how is it?

148
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,966
Do you think it
tastes like me?

149
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:47,100
Huh?!
Huh?!

150
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,533
I'm only kidding...

151
00:07:48,633 --> 00:07:51,566
It's not like I put my mouth
on that drink or anything.

152
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,033
No‐ I definitely didn't...

153
00:07:53,133 --> 00:07:55,866
That is a weirdly
specific joke...

154
00:07:55,966 --> 00:07:57,433
But more
importantly...

155
00:07:57,533 --> 00:08:00,700
Stella is standing there with
her mouth hanging half‐open....

156
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,166
Why do you have two bottles
behind your back Princess?

157
00:08:04,266 --> 00:08:07,200
Huh? It's only because
I'm extremely thirsty!

158
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,166
I'm going to drink both
of them myself!

159
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,400
Uh... Stella...?

160
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,066
(pants)
Oh, that is good!

161
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,133
This is really
good water!

162
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:21,633
Uh... ah...

163
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:23,000
You know,
Big Brother...

164
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,333
if it's alright
with you‐

165
00:08:24,433 --> 00:08:26,400
I'd like to train
with you as well!

166
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,400
But... there's already a short
sword master in our family...

167
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,600
Yes but they drove
you away from home.

168
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,766
There is nothing I would
ever want to learn from them!

169
00:08:36,066 --> 00:08:37,000
Alright.

170
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,066
If you think
I can be of help...

171
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,700
Shizuku:
Thank you very much,
Big Brother!

172
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,500
Alright then!

173
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,733
If you're teaching Shizuku‐
then you can teach me too!

174
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,533
Huh? Teach you what?

175
00:08:47,633 --> 00:08:50,533
Is that what's up?
You don't want to?

176
00:08:50,633 --> 00:08:54,433
No, it's not that I don't
want to... I mean I just...

177
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:55,166
Whatever!

178
00:08:55,266 --> 00:08:56,466
That is just fine!

179
00:08:56,566 --> 00:08:58,733
I don't need you to
teach me anything anyway!

180
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,200
In fact‐ I don't even want you
to teach me anything‐

181
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,733
I just said it to
see what you'd say‐

182
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,000
so you can just forget I
brought it up‐ you hear me?

183
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,166
Nevermind‐ oh great
master Jackass!

184
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,166
Ikki‐ you blockhead...

185
00:09:12,266 --> 00:09:14,033
you insensitive prick...

186
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:14,433
you pig‐faced
gorilla... you...

187
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:16,466
Alice:
Well hey there‐
firebrand!

188
00:09:16,566 --> 00:09:19,233
You haven't...
seen Shizuku now have you...?

189
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:22,033
Oh yeah‐
she's with... huh?

190
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:24,166
What's... what is that?

191
00:09:24,266 --> 00:09:26,833
I borrowed it
from Kagamin!

192
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,466
"Private School
Prince Academy,"

193
00:09:28,566 --> 00:09:32,633
A.K.A. "Pri‐Pri"!
It's an otome game...

194
00:09:32,733 --> 00:09:34,033
Otome game?

195
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,533
Kazumasa:
I can only see you now.

196
00:09:42,533 --> 00:09:45,133
Stella:
This...might be good...

197
00:09:45,233 --> 00:09:48,066
Kazumasa:
Please. Don't leave me alone.

198
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:52,400
Stella:
This is how it should be! I want
him to see nothing but me...

199
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,333
Kazumasa:
If I can have you,
then I don't need anything else.

200
00:09:55,433 --> 00:09:58,333
Stella:
Like an unnecessary,
obsessive, delusional, sister?

201
00:09:58,433 --> 00:10:00,133
You won't see
her either‐ will you?

202
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:03,033
Kazumasa:
So... What do we do now?

203
00:10:06,033 --> 00:10:10,533
Stella:
At least in a game, I can do
what I really want to...

204
00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:12,466
Okay...

205
00:10:12,566 --> 00:10:15,800
Kazumasa:
I... want to be with you, too.

206
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,700
I wish Ikki and I could
do more things like this...

207
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,400
...like holding hands...

208
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,666
And kissing...

209
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:28,500
And... and... and...

210
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,333
Ikki!

211
00:10:29,433 --> 00:10:31,100
Stella? About
tomorrow, I...

212
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,533
(embarrassed whailing)

213
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,500
What's the matter?

214
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,200
N‐N‐N‐Nothing! What were you
saying about tomorrow?

215
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,333
Yeah um... For tomorrow's
swordsmanship lesson,

216
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:44,400
I'm gonna take Shizuku and
the other girls to the pool.

217
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,166
So I was wondering
if you wanted to come.

218
00:10:47,266 --> 00:10:48,133
And why would I?!

219
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:53,866
I mean... it's not like you
really wanna teach me anything
anyway‐ isn't that right?!

220
00:10:53,966 --> 00:10:57,666
About that. I wanted to
explain...

221
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,800
(giggles)

222
00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:12,684
I thought she wasn't
going to come...

223
00:11:12,784 --> 00:11:14,284
She may be
here in body,

224
00:11:14,384 --> 00:11:16,984
but her brain is still
playing "Pri Pri."

225
00:11:19,684 --> 00:11:22,318
Stella, I don't think
I CAN teach you‐

226
00:11:22,418 --> 00:11:24,718
you're already far
too advanced...

227
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:27,451
Ikki:
Also, our styles
are totally different.

228
00:11:27,551 --> 00:11:29,184
What do you
mean by that?

229
00:11:29,284 --> 00:11:31,451
My style is all
about trickiness...

230
00:11:31,551 --> 00:11:33,551
but yours is all
about strength.

231
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,384
My influence could
only hold you back.

232
00:11:36,484 --> 00:11:38,751
So even if I could
help you at all...

233
00:11:38,851 --> 00:11:42,284
you would only find my
technique limiting and boring.

234
00:11:42,384 --> 00:11:45,351
Stella. I want...

235
00:11:45,451 --> 00:11:48,884
for you to always
go beyond my imagination.

236
00:11:50,151 --> 00:11:51,184
Ikki...

237
00:11:51,284 --> 00:11:52,784
(giggles)

238
00:11:52,884 --> 00:11:55,784
Ikki is mine‐
and I'm his...

239
00:11:55,884 --> 00:11:58,818
That means...
we are lovers...

240
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:01,351
Soon‐ maybe
we'll...

241
00:12:01,451 --> 00:12:04,218
Students:
(cheering)

242
00:12:04,318 --> 00:12:06,851
(giggles)

243
00:12:06,951 --> 00:12:09,151
(giggles)

244
00:12:09,251 --> 00:12:11,751
(laughs)

245
00:12:11,851 --> 00:12:13,618
(giggles)

246
00:12:13,718 --> 00:12:16,751
Wow, so this
is a Japanese pool.

247
00:12:16,851 --> 00:12:19,818
I guess a princess from the
provinces doesn't know very much

248
00:12:19,918 --> 00:12:20,918
about the
world, huh?

249
00:12:21,018 --> 00:12:22,618
Have you never
seen a pool?

250
00:12:22,718 --> 00:12:23,018
Oh yeah.

251
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:26,451
But in my castle, we called
a pool this size a bath.

252
00:12:26,551 --> 00:12:26,818
Mmm...
Mmm...

253
00:12:26,918 --> 00:12:29,484
Mmm...
Easy there girls‐
you have an audience.
Mmm...

254
00:12:29,584 --> 00:12:31,018
Girls:
(giggling)

255
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:32,651
Lessons are
SO paying off!

256
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:34,518
I can't believe
how awesome this is.

257
00:12:34,618 --> 00:12:36,251
I'm just so
emotional right now...

258
00:12:36,351 --> 00:12:37,451
Mm‐hmm! Mm‐hmm!
Mm‐hmm! Mm‐hmm!

259
00:12:37,551 --> 00:12:38,851
THANKS...
you guys...

260
00:12:38,951 --> 00:12:41,451
but it's only been
a couple of days...

261
00:12:41,551 --> 00:12:43,618
Ikki:
(uncomfortable laughter)

262
00:12:46,951 --> 00:12:47,951
Okay now everybody...

263
00:12:48,051 --> 00:12:51,118
I want you to just relax
and let yourselves drift.

264
00:12:51,218 --> 00:12:53,618
Ikki:
We're working to
improve your lung capacity,

265
00:12:53,718 --> 00:12:55,718
but there's another
very important purpose.

266
00:12:55,818 --> 00:12:58,518
"Another purpose"
you say?

267
00:12:58,618 --> 00:13:00,118
It'll become clear
when you do it...

268
00:13:00,218 --> 00:13:04,784
But immersion can be a
catalyst to bring you closer
to your truest self.

269
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:07,651
While you're in the water,
focus all your consciousness

270
00:13:07,751 --> 00:13:09,418
on the quiet inside of you,

271
00:13:09,518 --> 00:13:12,451
then you'll be able
to hear your own sound.

272
00:13:12,551 --> 00:13:14,884
I know he came here to
continue giving his lessons...

273
00:13:14,984 --> 00:13:17,918
but I wish he would spend
a little time with me too.

274
00:13:18,018 --> 00:13:20,718
I tried really hard
to pick the perfect bikini.

275
00:13:20,818 --> 00:13:21,584
Ooh!

276
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:23,818
Oh I'm so sorry!

277
00:13:23,918 --> 00:13:25,084
It's okay.

278
00:13:25,184 --> 00:13:26,451
Huh?

279
00:13:30,418 --> 00:13:33,318
Ikki:
Everybody relax,
and listen to your body...

280
00:13:33,418 --> 00:13:37,951
Focus all my consciousness on
the quiet inside of me... huh...

281
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:41,551
Stella:
Kind of hard to do that when
your brain is so noisy...

282
00:13:44,451 --> 00:13:47,484
Bring me closer
to my truest self...

283
00:13:47,584 --> 00:13:50,151
Help me hear
my own sound...

284
00:13:50,251 --> 00:13:51,184
Yes.

285
00:13:51,284 --> 00:13:53,484
Ikki's Itto
Shura power...

286
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:56,918
must be a sharpened version
of this sense...

287
00:13:57,018 --> 00:13:59,918
If I can get there,
I can get close to Ikki.

288
00:14:00,018 --> 00:14:03,384
Maybe I can discover something
I haven't seen before.

289
00:14:03,484 --> 00:14:04,418
So...

290
00:14:04,518 --> 00:14:06,251
In my own
consciousness...

291
00:14:06,351 --> 00:14:07,351
Deep inside...

292
00:14:07,451 --> 00:14:10,184
Reaching deeper
and deeper down...

293
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:12,918
Kagami:
So I'm curious‐ how far have you
and Kurogane gone so far?

294
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,551
Kagami:
So I'm curious‐ how far have you
and Kurogane gone so far?
Mmm!

295
00:14:15,851 --> 00:14:17,284
(coughing)

296
00:14:17,384 --> 00:14:22,451
I'm sorry. I didn't imagine that
question would surprise
you so much.

297
00:14:22,551 --> 00:14:24,651
What do you mean
"how far have we gone?!"

298
00:14:24,751 --> 00:14:26,584
Well you guys
are dating right?

299
00:14:26,684 --> 00:14:28,084
Don't be
ridiculous!

300
00:14:28,184 --> 00:14:31,118
The princess of a nation
dating a commoner like him?

301
00:14:31,218 --> 00:14:32,151
That's insane!

302
00:14:32,251 --> 00:14:33,184
Really...?

303
00:14:33,284 --> 00:14:37,118
Okay then, you wouldn't mind
if I asked him out would you?

304
00:14:37,218 --> 00:14:37,684
Huh?

305
00:14:37,784 --> 00:14:40,351
He's so strong and
handsome...

306
00:14:40,451 --> 00:14:42,318
and he's just
bursting with great stories!...

307
00:14:42,418 --> 00:14:44,984
Alright!... If he's available‐
I'm gonna‐

308
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:45,818
NO WAY!

309
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:47,318
Don't you even
think about it‐

310
00:14:47,418 --> 00:14:50,151
he is my boyfriend!
He belongs with me!

311
00:14:50,251 --> 00:14:52,051
(chuckles)

312
00:14:52,151 --> 00:14:53,118
Whoops...

313
00:14:53,218 --> 00:14:55,718
Can I quote you on
that Miss Stella?

314
00:14:55,818 --> 00:14:56,784
Oh...

315
00:14:56,884 --> 00:14:59,351
I'm just kidding‐
I won't tell anyone.

316
00:14:59,451 --> 00:15:00,718
Oh, you won't?

317
00:15:00,818 --> 00:15:03,351
I am a journalist
of integrity after all.

318
00:15:03,451 --> 00:15:06,218
And I want my friends'
romance to blossom and grow!

319
00:15:06,318 --> 00:15:08,518
Thank you, Kagami...

320
00:15:08,618 --> 00:15:10,451
So? How far
have you gone?

321
00:15:10,551 --> 00:15:12,851
Oh!What about
"integrity?"

322
00:15:12,951 --> 00:15:16,351
But I'm so curious‐ I mean you
guys are roommates and all...

323
00:15:16,451 --> 00:15:20,184
I'm talking about your...
sleeping arrangements...?

324
00:15:20,284 --> 00:15:21,018
Do you do the
"master/servant" thing?

325
00:15:21,118 --> 00:15:22,318
Do you do the
"master/servant" thing?
OH MY GOD‐
absolutely not!!

326
00:15:22,418 --> 00:15:23,384
OH MY GOD‐
absolutely not!!

327
00:15:23,484 --> 00:15:26,051
Seriously?‐
So he's not all like:

328
00:15:26,151 --> 00:15:27,851
"Nighttime
Itto Shura!"

329
00:15:27,951 --> 00:15:30,784
'cause that's totally how
I've been picturing it...

330
00:15:31,418 --> 00:15:32,418
So you've
only kissed?

331
00:15:32,518 --> 00:15:36,884
We... haven't even
had a... proper kiss.

332
00:15:36,984 --> 00:15:38,884
You hav‐
are you kidding?

333
00:15:38,984 --> 00:15:40,384
Mm‐mmm...

334
00:15:40,484 --> 00:15:43,284
Okay! Now take
a deep breath!

335
00:15:43,384 --> 00:15:45,618
My big brother is
SO dedicated...

336
00:15:45,718 --> 00:15:48,418
he really should just
be teaching me alone...

337
00:15:48,518 --> 00:15:50,684
He does have
a lot to share...

338
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:51,718
Alice you...

339
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:53,651
You don't think
it's wrong do you?

340
00:15:53,751 --> 00:15:55,651
That I like
my big brother?

341
00:15:56,584 --> 00:15:58,218
Oh my precious...

342
00:15:58,318 --> 00:15:59,718
the heart wants
what it wants

343
00:15:59,818 --> 00:16:01,851
and I have learned
not to question that.

344
00:16:01,951 --> 00:16:04,684
Alice:
Real love is
never wrong, darling.

345
00:16:05,084 --> 00:16:06,518
Mmm...

346
00:16:06,618 --> 00:16:09,784
I see... this sounds
like the real thing...

347
00:16:09,884 --> 00:16:10,384
Mm‐hmm.

348
00:16:10,484 --> 00:16:13,484
His generosity,
his dedication...

349
00:16:13,584 --> 00:16:16,518
all those things
are so.. dear to me...

350
00:16:16,618 --> 00:16:19,118
But you've been
together for two weeks.

351
00:16:19,218 --> 00:16:20,984
And nothing has
happened like at all?!

352
00:16:21,084 --> 00:16:24,718
Mmm... I don't mean to ask
for too much of him,

353
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:28,151
but I do wish that we could
behave a little bit more like...

354
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:29,418
...like lovers.

355
00:16:29,518 --> 00:16:32,018
Have you
told him that?

356
00:16:32,118 --> 00:16:33,451
No, I can't
tell him that‐

357
00:16:33,551 --> 00:16:35,284
A girl is not supposed
to say things like that‐

358
00:16:35,384 --> 00:16:37,018
It's disgraceful!

359
00:16:37,118 --> 00:16:38,251
You know...

360
00:16:38,351 --> 00:16:40,451
I haven't met a guy yet
who doesn't appreciate

361
00:16:40,551 --> 00:16:42,551
a girl taking a
little initiative.

362
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:45,351
Especially if that girl's
as cute as you are, Shizuku.

363
00:16:45,451 --> 00:16:46,151
Yeah but...

364
00:16:46,251 --> 00:16:48,984
whether or not my brother
could ever accept me...

365
00:16:49,084 --> 00:16:50,951
is a different matter.

366
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:51,884
Well there's that...

367
00:16:51,984 --> 00:16:54,651
It might require a rather
difficult shift in perspective‐

368
00:16:54,751 --> 00:16:57,718
but it's easier if you've
ever read any Greek drama...

369
00:16:57,818 --> 00:16:58,818
So maybe...

370
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:01,218
I should just let
him be happy with...

371
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:02,751
someone else...

372
00:17:02,851 --> 00:17:05,118
Oh sweetie‐
don't make that face.

373
00:17:05,218 --> 00:17:06,951
You still
have a chance.

374
00:17:07,051 --> 00:17:07,684
Listen...

375
00:17:07,784 --> 00:17:10,618
that little princess isn't the
kind who opens up easily...

376
00:17:10,718 --> 00:17:15,084
Guys like him don't easily open
up! YOU have to open up to HIM!

377
00:17:15,184 --> 00:17:15,818
Okay...

378
00:17:15,918 --> 00:17:17,551
But what if he thinks
I'm too forward,

379
00:17:17,651 --> 00:17:19,651
and he doesn't
like me anymore?

380
00:17:19,751 --> 00:17:22,251
He won't "not like" you for
something like that!

381
00:17:22,351 --> 00:17:24,151
Listen‐ guys these
days are like sheep.

382
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:27,184
They'll mindlessly nibble
the available grass and move on!

383
00:17:27,284 --> 00:17:29,551
Kagami:
What if he runs away because
you weren't quick enough?!

384
00:17:29,651 --> 00:17:31,251
I... couldn't
go on...

385
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:32,851
Okay!
But seriously...

386
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:35,318
I guarantee he wants to
take it to the next level!

387
00:17:35,418 --> 00:17:38,318
Kagami:
He was totally lusting after you
when he saw that swimsuit!

388
00:17:38,418 --> 00:17:39,484
Oh my God‐ he was?!

389
00:17:39,584 --> 00:17:41,018
You wait
right here‐

390
00:17:41,118 --> 00:17:42,284
I'm gonna go
get him!

391
00:17:42,384 --> 00:17:44,418
Just tell him you
wanna do it, Okay?

392
00:17:44,518 --> 00:17:47,618
Uhh! Huh? Ahh!

393
00:17:50,684 --> 00:17:53,251
Ikki:
Kagami told me to
come see you.

394
00:17:53,351 --> 00:17:54,984
Did you need
to talk?

395
00:17:55,084 --> 00:17:57,418
Oh... I
uh... wanted...

396
00:17:57,518 --> 00:17:59,951
HEY! What do you
think about my bikini?

397
00:18:00,051 --> 00:18:03,184
Oh... well it... it looks
really good on you...

398
00:18:03,284 --> 00:18:05,918
Wait... he doesn't look
"lustful" to me!

399
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:09,784
What if he runs away because
you weren't quick enough?!

400
00:18:09,884 --> 00:18:12,251
To tell the truth...
I had something important

401
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,051
I wanted to
talk to you about.

402
00:18:14,151 --> 00:18:15,851
Oh! What's that?

403
00:18:15,951 --> 00:18:18,884
About us...
I mean...

404
00:18:18,984 --> 00:18:21,751
I'm wondering if we
should keep on like this.

405
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,418
Ah...

406
00:18:25,251 --> 00:18:26,351
Huh?

407
00:18:26,451 --> 00:18:28,418
I've been thinking
about it...

408
00:18:28,518 --> 00:18:29,584
It's been two weeks,

409
00:18:29,684 --> 00:18:33,718
and we haven't been acting
like we're together... have we?

410
00:18:33,818 --> 00:18:36,984
So‐ I mean, well,
you know...

411
00:18:37,084 --> 00:18:39,451
Oh... I see.

412
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,584
I'm already
too late...

413
00:18:41,684 --> 00:18:43,318
I've already
lost him...

414
00:18:43,418 --> 00:18:45,618
Because I wasn't
quick enough.

415
00:18:45,718 --> 00:18:46,518
Oh no...

416
00:18:46,618 --> 00:18:50,451
...So I thought maybe we should
talk about whether or not we're
doing the right thing here...

417
00:18:50,551 --> 00:18:53,884
I‐I agree! I was thinking
exactly the same thing!

418
00:18:53,984 --> 00:18:56,884
There is no way this
was ever going to work!

419
00:18:56,984 --> 00:18:57,784
S‐Stella?

420
00:18:57,884 --> 00:19:00,118
Of course, instead of a girl
who doesn't even hold your hand,

421
00:19:00,218 --> 00:19:02,618
you'd prefer someone like
Shizuku, who's all over you,

422
00:19:02,718 --> 00:19:05,051
or Kagami, who's always
rubbing her chest on you!

423
00:19:05,151 --> 00:19:07,118
Wait a minute...
rubbing her... What?

424
00:19:07,218 --> 00:19:09,018
Where the hell is all
this coming from?!

425
00:19:09,118 --> 00:19:09,818
It doesn't
matter!

426
00:19:09,918 --> 00:19:12,018
We're talking about
breaking up, aren't we?!

427
00:19:12,118 --> 00:19:13,951
Wha‐?!
Just calm down...

428
00:19:14,051 --> 00:19:15,484
Don't touch me!

429
00:19:22,718 --> 00:19:24,384
Did I do
something wrong?

430
00:19:24,484 --> 00:19:26,951
Tell me what it was
and I'll apologize, Stella.

431
00:19:27,051 --> 00:19:28,851
Are you mad
at me? Come on.

432
00:19:28,951 --> 00:19:31,251
It's because I know
that you hate me.

433
00:19:31,351 --> 00:19:32,618
How could
I hate you?!

434
00:19:32,718 --> 00:19:34,484
I never said
anything like that!

435
00:19:34,584 --> 00:19:36,251
You don't have to
"say"‐ I know!

436
00:19:36,351 --> 00:19:40,384
No you do not "know" that,
and you can't because
it simply isn't true!

437
00:19:40,484 --> 00:19:42,451
Where did you even
get that idea?

438
00:19:42,551 --> 00:19:44,851
It's pretty clear...
YOU'RE the one who hates me!

439
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:48,784
No I do not‐ don't be stupid‐
I really like you, Ikki!

440
00:19:48,884 --> 00:19:50,151
Well I like you more!

441
00:19:50,251 --> 00:19:52,051
Oh that's
such a lie!

442
00:19:52,151 --> 00:19:53,684
I SO like
you more!

443
00:19:53,784 --> 00:19:56,118
I know because you wouldn't
even look at my bikini

444
00:19:56,218 --> 00:19:57,618
and I know you
don't care about me

445
00:19:57,718 --> 00:19:59,951
because I wasn't
quick enough!

446
00:20:00,051 --> 00:20:01,318
Stop‐ I'm gonna
get mad!

447
00:20:01,418 --> 00:20:03,284
You're already
MAD, dumbass!

448
00:20:03,384 --> 00:20:05,518
It's because you
are driving me crazy!

449
00:20:05,618 --> 00:20:07,418
This amazing girl
I really like

450
00:20:07,518 --> 00:20:09,518
comes out in a bikini and
she's all cute and hot

451
00:20:09,618 --> 00:20:11,584
and HOW THE HELL DO I NOT
GET EXCITED BY THAT?!

452
00:20:11,684 --> 00:20:13,751
You didn't look interested in my
bikini at all!

453
00:20:13,851 --> 00:20:16,851
Because I didn't want
to objectify you
and make you hate me!

454
00:20:16,951 --> 00:20:19,451
Besides... you say..
you really like me...

455
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:22,418
but you haven't done anything
to show me that in any way!

456
00:20:22,518 --> 00:20:24,284
I can't just say "I wanna
make love with you!"

457
00:20:24,384 --> 00:20:28,151
I don't want you to think I'm
a... slut... and not like me!

458
00:20:28,251 --> 00:20:29,218
Me, either!

459
00:20:29,318 --> 00:20:30,618
WELL OKAY THEN!

460
00:20:30,718 --> 00:20:33,318
SO WHY THE HELL ARE WE STILL
YELLING AT EACH OTHER?!

461
00:20:33,418 --> 00:20:35,318
I DON'T KNOW ANYMORE!

462
00:20:35,418 --> 00:20:38,384
(panting)

463
00:20:43,984 --> 00:20:45,784
I have an idea.

464
00:20:45,884 --> 00:20:46,651
What?

465
00:20:46,751 --> 00:20:50,318
We could tell each other...
at the same time...

466
00:20:50,418 --> 00:20:51,884
what we want.

467
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:53,451
Mmm.

468
00:20:55,418 --> 00:20:57,451
I want to... kiss.
I want to... kiss.

469
00:21:10,184 --> 00:21:11,418
Tell me, Ikki...

470
00:21:11,518 --> 00:21:16,451
Would you hate a naughty
girl who would ask her
boyfriend... for a kiss?

471
00:21:16,551 --> 00:21:19,751
There is no guy who doesn't
appreciate a naughty girl.

472
00:21:19,851 --> 00:21:20,284
How 'bout you?

473
00:21:20,384 --> 00:21:23,584
Would you hate a guy
who stares like you're
the hottest thing ever?

474
00:21:23,684 --> 00:21:28,551
Yeah, definitely...
But you're allowed, Ikki.

475
00:21:42,451 --> 00:21:45,751
(phones ringing)

476
00:21:51,418 --> 00:21:53,584
From the student council...?

477
00:21:54,918 --> 00:21:58,484
Renren:
(exerting force)
(giggles)

478
00:21:58,584 --> 00:22:00,984
My next opponent
is Kurogane!

479
00:22:01,084 --> 00:22:03,584
And it's time for me
to show our little princess...

480
00:22:03,684 --> 00:22:06,784
the real power of
the student council!
