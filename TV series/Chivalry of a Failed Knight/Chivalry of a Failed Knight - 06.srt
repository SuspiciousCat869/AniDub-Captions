1
00:00:02,364 --> 00:00:03,882
Mikazuki:
There it is! It's "Mach Grid!"

2
00:00:03,982 --> 00:00:08,848
By accumulating her
own speed, she accelerates
exponentially until she stops!

3
00:00:08,948 --> 00:00:11,182
That's the Noble Art
of Renren Tomaru,

4
00:00:11,282 --> 00:00:13,448
also known as
"The Runner's High,"

5
00:00:13,548 --> 00:00:17,215
and she's already broken
the sound barrier folks!

6
00:00:17,315 --> 00:00:19,548
Aren't you surprised,
Kurogane?

7
00:00:19,648 --> 00:00:23,415
Yeah. You've earned your place
on the student council, Tomaru.

8
00:00:23,515 --> 00:00:26,282
You're too fast
for my eyes to follow.

9
00:00:26,382 --> 00:00:30,282
Hangetsu:
Look out folks!
Saijo is swinging his Zanbato!

10
00:00:30,382 --> 00:00:33,982
My ability is "the accumulation
of slashing momentum"!

11
00:00:34,082 --> 00:00:36,282
The more I swing it‐
the heavier it gets!

12
00:00:36,382 --> 00:00:38,548
You've already lost
your chance, Vermillion!

13
00:00:38,648 --> 00:00:42,748
This is... the Noble Art of
"the Destroyer‐" Ikazuchi Saijo!

14
00:00:42,848 --> 00:00:45,982
Hangetsu:
Is this the end
for Stella Vermillion?!

15
00:00:46,682 --> 00:00:48,248
Crescendo Ax!

16
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:50,915
Black Bird!

17
00:00:52,382 --> 00:00:53,215
Oh!

18
00:00:53,782 --> 00:00:54,748
Huh?!

19
00:00:54,848 --> 00:00:57,082
Don't forget‐
"Mr. Secretary"...

20
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,215
My Knight ranking
is an "A".

21
00:00:59,315 --> 00:01:03,515
I can bring down any special
ability, any power, any trick...

22
00:01:03,615 --> 00:01:05,382
and I can do it head‐on.

23
00:01:06,882 --> 00:01:08,748
You... you've beaten me...

24
00:01:08,848 --> 00:01:13,448
Mikazuki:
Another win! for Ikki Kurogane,
A. K. A. "Another One"!

25
00:01:13,548 --> 00:01:16,482
Victory over a
student council executive!

26
00:01:16,582 --> 00:01:18,215
He remains undefeated!

27
00:01:18,315 --> 00:01:21,082
This year's freshmen...
continue to astound!

28
00:01:21,182 --> 00:01:23,748
Mikazuki Tsukuyomi signing off!

29
00:01:23,848 --> 00:01:26,082
And This is
Hangetsu Tsukuyomi...

30
00:01:26,182 --> 00:01:27,982
We'll see ya next match!

31
00:01:28,082 --> 00:01:34,182
(cheers and applause)

32
00:03:07,548 --> 00:03:08,715
Mmm...

33
00:03:08,815 --> 00:03:10,215
Shizuku:
Congratulations,
Big Brother!

34
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:14,348
Heh. I think I hurt my
wrist on that one...

35
00:03:15,082 --> 00:03:16,282
Are you alright brother?

36
00:03:16,382 --> 00:03:19,082
Would you like me to sleep
by your side and nurse you?

37
00:03:19,182 --> 00:03:19,315
Huh?

38
00:03:19,415 --> 00:03:24,382
He can't heal
if he's suffocating!

39
00:03:24,482 --> 00:03:25,748
Ikki, you've gotta
break free from her! ,/
But, Big Brother...

40
00:03:25,848 --> 00:03:27,515
You wouldn't neglect
your little sister

41
00:03:27,615 --> 00:03:30,182
who loves her brother with
her whole heart‐ would you?

42
00:03:30,282 --> 00:03:32,915
Oh... No...
of course not...

43
00:03:33,015 --> 00:03:34,248
Ya hear that‐
Princess?

44
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:35,682
You have nothing
to do with us,

45
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,082
so stop butting
in our conversation!

46
00:03:37,182 --> 00:03:38,915
I have something
to do with him!

47
00:03:39,015 --> 00:03:41,182
Really? And what's that‐
I wonder?

48
00:03:41,282 --> 00:03:43,782
IT'S...
nothing...

49
00:03:43,882 --> 00:03:45,615
Oh...

50
00:03:46,815 --> 00:03:48,048
Alice:
Ikki, Honey?

51
00:03:48,148 --> 00:03:50,982
Just curious‐ how long are
we going to let this go on?

52
00:03:51,082 --> 00:03:53,948
Oh... I guess you
spotted her too, huh?

53
00:03:54,048 --> 00:03:56,248
But Big Brother...
what are you talking about?

54
00:03:56,348 --> 00:04:00,282
Ikki:
Well... uh... I think
I'm being followed by someone.

55
00:04:00,382 --> 00:04:00,915
What?!

56
00:04:01,015 --> 00:04:02,648
A stalker?!
Oh my God!

57
00:04:02,748 --> 00:04:05,082
Wait... so a
"stalker" is what?

58
00:04:05,182 --> 00:04:08,215
Like someone who sends you
a shaving kit in the mail?

59
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:10,448
No Stella.
It's a razor blade.

60
00:04:10,548 --> 00:04:12,315
Who would send you
an entire shaving kit?

61
00:04:12,415 --> 00:04:14,015
Oh shut up
I don't know!

62
00:04:14,115 --> 00:04:16,215
A shaving kit includes
a razor blade!

63
00:04:16,315 --> 00:04:18,648
She has been shadowing
you for a week...

64
00:04:18,748 --> 00:04:22,682
Alice:
And not well‐ I thought it was
some sort of performance piece.

65
00:04:22,782 --> 00:04:24,615
Perhaps we should
make contact?

66
00:04:24,715 --> 00:04:25,515
You're right.

67
00:04:25,615 --> 00:04:28,815
I guess it's time we...
find out who she is...

68
00:04:28,915 --> 00:04:30,848
Alice:
Okay I see you
back there.

69
00:04:30,948 --> 00:04:31,848
Is there something
you need?

70
00:04:31,948 --> 00:04:33,848
Uh... ahhh!

71
00:04:33,948 --> 00:04:35,648
Uh...

72
00:04:35,748 --> 00:04:37,782
Shizuku:
Who is this...?

73
00:04:37,882 --> 00:04:39,948
Stella:
Well, I've seen
her somewhere...

74
00:04:40,048 --> 00:04:43,348
Uh, hold on a minute,
this is just a misunderstanding!

75
00:04:44,315 --> 00:04:45,982
I... I uh...

76
00:04:46,082 --> 00:04:47,582
Ikki:
Oh wait you're...

77
00:04:47,682 --> 00:04:50,115
Uh... Umm... Wahh!

78
00:04:51,715 --> 00:04:52,982
Oh...

79
00:04:55,915 --> 00:04:57,382
Ayase:
Uh... Thank you
for pulling me out...

80
00:04:57,482 --> 00:05:03,248
I um... Let me see.. I uh..
I'm a junior.. and uh...

81
00:05:03,915 --> 00:05:05,448
Is something wrong?

82
00:05:05,548 --> 00:05:07,048
No, I just...

83
00:05:07,148 --> 00:05:10,282
I'm embarrassed to look
into a boy's eyes...

84
00:05:10,382 --> 00:05:11,982
I'm sorry...

85
00:05:12,082 --> 00:05:14,782
Well isn't she
just precious?

86
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:18,448
My name's...
Ayase Ayatsuji...

87
00:05:18,548 --> 00:05:20,548
in Class... 3‐1.

88
00:05:20,648 --> 00:05:22,248
Ayatsuji...

89
00:05:23,315 --> 00:05:24,982
Ikki:
Are you by
any chance...

90
00:05:25,082 --> 00:05:27,882
related to
Kaito Ayatsuji?

91
00:05:27,982 --> 00:05:31,815
Oh... well yes I am,
Kaito Ayatsuji is my father.

92
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:32,582
No wonder!

93
00:05:32,682 --> 00:05:35,482
Ikki:
When I saw that callous from
practicing the bamboo sword

94
00:05:35,582 --> 00:05:36,182
I thought you must be!

95
00:05:36,282 --> 00:05:38,982
Hey, Alice.
Who's Kaito Ayatsuji?
Wow, this is amazing. Kaito's
sword technique is flawless!

96
00:05:39,082 --> 00:05:40,815
I'm... afraid
I haven't met him...
Wow, this is amazing. Kaito's
sword technique is flawless!

97
00:05:40,915 --> 00:05:42,015
I'm... afraid
I haven't met him...

98
00:05:42,115 --> 00:05:43,848
He was a gifted
swordsman...

99
00:05:43,948 --> 00:05:45,815
called "The
Last Samurai..."

100
00:05:45,915 --> 00:05:47,515
The Tenryu Gozen Match,

101
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:48,648
The Tozai Toitsu Match,

102
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,748
The Musashi Cup,
The Judan Match...

103
00:05:50,848 --> 00:05:52,548
He won all the well‐known
tournaments,

104
00:05:52,648 --> 00:05:56,048
and enjoyed his glory in
the world of the Japanese sword.

105
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:57,982
He's a true master.

106
00:05:58,082 --> 00:05:59,882
But he's not
widely known...

107
00:05:59,982 --> 00:06:02,548
because he happens
to not be a blazer.

108
00:06:02,648 --> 00:06:05,182
Ikki:
When I was little,
I used to study swordplay

109
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:07,782
by watching the
videos of his matches.

110
00:06:07,882 --> 00:06:08,582
Seriously?!

111
00:06:08,682 --> 00:06:11,915
Of course! I can't believe
I'm meeting his daughter...

112
00:06:12,015 --> 00:06:13,248
It's so cool!

113
00:06:13,348 --> 00:06:15,615
I haven't heard his name
very much lately though.

114
00:06:15,715 --> 00:06:15,948
How is he?

115
00:06:16,048 --> 00:06:17,982
Uh...

116
00:06:18,082 --> 00:06:21,048
There was an accident
during a match...

117
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:23,048
and he's in the
hospital right now.

118
00:06:23,148 --> 00:06:25,215
Ikki:
O‐Oh, I'm sorry.

119
00:06:25,315 --> 00:06:27,648
I'm so sorry‐
I had no idea...

120
00:06:27,748 --> 00:06:29,582
No‐ no‐ please‐
it's okay!

121
00:06:29,682 --> 00:06:32,448
I'm happy to know that a
swordsman like you...

122
00:06:32,548 --> 00:06:35,248
is also a big fan
of my father...

123
00:06:35,348 --> 00:06:38,182
means a lot.
So thank you!

124
00:06:38,282 --> 00:06:41,182
But more importantly, I think
it's time you tell us all

125
00:06:41,282 --> 00:06:43,215
why you've been
stalking my brother.

126
00:06:43,315 --> 00:06:45,915
I'm pretty sure I recognize
that hungry look you have

127
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,248
in your eyes when you're
staring at him.

128
00:06:47,348 --> 00:06:48,215
So what would be the
best way to punish you?
That hungry WHAT?!

129
00:06:48,315 --> 00:06:50,515
So what would be the
best way to punish you?
N‐No! It's not like
that I promise!

130
00:06:50,615 --> 00:06:52,082
Iron maiden,
barbed whip...

131
00:06:52,182 --> 00:06:55,882
Shizuku:
nail ripping, burning with fire,
waterboarding, ant hill,
bondage...

132
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:59,148
walk of shame, wooden horse
torture, public stockade...
I've been... practicing
Ayatsuji Itto‐ryu...

133
00:06:59,248 --> 00:07:01,515
tying you up and letting
vultures eat your eyeballs...
and I've just
suddenly hit a wall...

134
00:07:01,615 --> 00:07:03,648
But I...I just
couldn't figure out...

135
00:07:03,748 --> 00:07:07,315
how to approach a man
I didn't even know...
I'm sorry...

136
00:07:07,415 --> 00:07:11,182
All this time, you've been
trying to figure out how
to talk to me?

137
00:07:11,282 --> 00:07:14,415
Yeah...
I'm so embarrassed...

138
00:07:14,515 --> 00:07:15,282
Mystery solved.

139
00:07:15,382 --> 00:07:18,015
(sighs)
I'm really sorry!

140
00:07:19,415 --> 00:07:22,282
Miss Ayase...
I would be honored

141
00:07:22,382 --> 00:07:24,182
if you would join me
for training.

142
00:07:24,282 --> 00:07:25,248
(gasps)

143
00:07:25,348 --> 00:07:26,482
(gasps)

144
00:07:26,582 --> 00:07:31,182
Students:
(battle cry)
(wooden swords clash)

145
00:07:33,915 --> 00:07:36,215
Ikki:
No wonder she has
a solid foundation.

146
00:07:36,315 --> 00:07:39,482
She never forgets the forms,
but isn't fixated on them.

147
00:07:39,582 --> 00:07:40,648
Very high level.

148
00:07:40,748 --> 00:07:42,048
However...

149
00:07:42,148 --> 00:07:44,282
Ayatsuji. Stop a moment.

150
00:07:45,682 --> 00:07:46,715
Mmm?

151
00:07:46,815 --> 00:07:48,882
what do you need,
Mister Kurogane?

152
00:07:48,982 --> 00:07:50,082
I was thinking...

153
00:07:50,182 --> 00:07:52,548
the reason you
feel like you're stuck...

154
00:07:52,648 --> 00:07:55,482
is because you worry that you're
not reaching Kaito's level?

155
00:07:55,582 --> 00:07:57,548
Yes, exactly!

156
00:07:58,548 --> 00:07:59,982
No matter what I do...

157
00:08:00,082 --> 00:08:03,115
I can't move
as fast as my father...

158
00:08:03,215 --> 00:08:06,715
Even though I have all
of his moves down perfectly!

159
00:08:06,815 --> 00:08:07,782
Ikki:
That's the problem.

160
00:08:07,882 --> 00:08:08,948
(gasps)

161
00:08:09,048 --> 00:08:10,848
Imitating Kaito
like that...

162
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:12,448
is the only thing
getting in your way.

163
00:08:12,548 --> 00:08:15,348
Are you saying my
father is wrong?!

164
00:08:15,448 --> 00:08:16,448
Not at all.

165
00:08:16,548 --> 00:08:18,582
Ikki:
You and Kaito are
different genders...

166
00:08:18,682 --> 00:08:23,082
Which means that your
anatomy and your muscle
development are also different.

167
00:08:23,182 --> 00:08:25,615
Your father's technique
is so perfect,

168
00:08:25,715 --> 00:08:29,448
the differences
are apparent...

169
00:08:29,548 --> 00:08:32,215
Right...
I do understand... ,/
No wonder you're
so amazing, Kurogane!

170
00:08:32,315 --> 00:08:34,215
I think I might
have an idea...

171
00:08:34,315 --> 00:08:38,148
about how I can help you...
If you want to correct it...

172
00:08:38,248 --> 00:08:39,382
Mm‐hmm!

173
00:08:39,482 --> 00:08:40,148
However...

174
00:08:40,248 --> 00:08:40,982
Huh?

175
00:08:41,082 --> 00:08:46,048
Ikki:
If you feel strongly about using
exactly the same sword technique
as your father,

176
00:08:46,148 --> 00:08:48,548
then you shouldn't
force yourself to change that.

177
00:08:48,648 --> 00:08:53,148
Because once you correct this...
there'll be no going back.

178
00:08:57,715 --> 00:08:59,182
I want to learn...

179
00:08:59,282 --> 00:09:03,448
I want you to help me become
a better swordsman please.

180
00:09:03,548 --> 00:09:06,015
Alright.
You can trust me.

181
00:09:06,548 --> 00:09:07,548
Raise your sword.

182
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:09,248
O‐Okay...

183
00:09:10,482 --> 00:09:10,848
Huh?!

184
00:09:10,948 --> 00:09:11,482
(gasps)

185
00:09:11,582 --> 00:09:14,382
Wh‐Wh‐What are you doing‐
Ikki‐ OH MY GOD!

186
00:09:14,482 --> 00:09:16,148
In order to
correct her form...

187
00:09:16,248 --> 00:09:17,715
we have to
fix her stance...

188
00:09:17,815 --> 00:09:20,515
Ikki:
Ayatsuji... I know
you're embarrassed...

189
00:09:20,615 --> 00:09:21,948
just hang
on a sec...

190
00:09:22,048 --> 00:09:23,148
Wha... okay then...

191
00:09:23,248 --> 00:09:25,848
I'm gonna move you
a few millimeters.

192
00:09:25,948 --> 00:09:26,915
There we go.

193
00:09:27,015 --> 00:09:28,648
Now do you feel
the difference?

194
00:09:28,748 --> 00:09:30,948
Focus on that
and lock it in.

195
00:09:31,048 --> 00:09:33,182
Oh yeah I
feel... that...

196
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:35,815
Females have a huge
advantage over males...

197
00:09:35,915 --> 00:09:37,615
when it comes to
flexibility.

198
00:09:37,715 --> 00:09:40,482
Especially here...

199
00:09:40,582 --> 00:09:43,348
The female pelvis is
shallower for pregnancy,

200
00:09:43,448 --> 00:09:46,515
which changes your
center of gravity.

201
00:09:46,615 --> 00:09:49,848
And... it gives you a much wider
range of motion than a male,

202
00:09:49,948 --> 00:09:51,848
and better
lateral movement.

203
00:09:51,948 --> 00:09:54,248
It's an advantage
only females have.

204
00:09:54,348 --> 00:09:57,448
If you move your entire
body using the hip joint,

205
00:09:57,548 --> 00:10:01,082
then all your moves will
become one step faster.

206
00:10:01,682 --> 00:10:03,348
(slight moaning)

207
00:10:03,448 --> 00:10:07,648
(horrified gasp)

208
00:10:07,748 --> 00:10:10,148
Okay... that
should it.

209
00:10:10,248 --> 00:10:14,215
I'm sorry if that was
uncomfortable... you alright?

210
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:17,482
Yes I'm fine...

211
00:10:18,115 --> 00:10:19,815
(uncomfortable laughter)

212
00:10:19,915 --> 00:10:21,482
Alright.
Raise your sword.

213
00:10:21,582 --> 00:10:23,115
Okay...

214
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,248
Ikki:
And...?

215
00:10:26,348 --> 00:10:28,582
It feels
a little... tight.

216
00:10:28,682 --> 00:10:30,282
You'll get
used to it.

217
00:10:30,382 --> 00:10:33,348
Just feel the
difference. Here!

218
00:10:36,548 --> 00:10:37,648
(gasps)

219
00:10:37,748 --> 00:10:39,582
Yeah, that's
totally better.

220
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:40,582
Mmm!

221
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:40,882
Oh I see...

222
00:10:40,982 --> 00:10:45,048
Alice:
So when she defends herself,
she absorbs the impact
into her lower body‐

223
00:10:45,148 --> 00:10:46,815
instead of
her arms.

224
00:10:46,915 --> 00:10:49,015
Wow! You're
so great, Kurogane!

225
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:50,982
This was troubling me
for a long time,

226
00:10:51,082 --> 00:10:52,915
and you just fixed it
so easily!

227
00:10:53,015 --> 00:10:55,482
You're a professor
of swordsmanship!

228
00:10:56,515 --> 00:10:57,248
That's great.

229
00:10:57,348 --> 00:10:59,582
I'm not so sure I'm thrilled
about the title, though...

230
00:10:59,682 --> 00:11:01,282
I'm not so sure I'm thrilled
about the title, though...
(laughs)

231
00:11:01,382 --> 00:11:03,182
Mmm...

232
00:11:07,736 --> 00:11:09,072
Ikki:
I'm sorry
about earlier...

233
00:11:09,172 --> 00:11:12,139
I mean if I...
made you uncomfortable...

234
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:15,972
Not at all‐ I'm deeply grateful
for your help‐ Kurogane.

235
00:11:16,072 --> 00:11:22,205
And you... you have very...
big and rugged hands...

236
00:11:22,305 --> 00:11:26,872
They're like... my father's
hands‐ and that made me happy.

237
00:11:28,739 --> 00:11:31,339
I guess I never
saw them that way...

238
00:11:31,439 --> 00:11:32,772
Oh but I
like them...

239
00:11:32,872 --> 00:11:34,905
I think they're
really nice!

240
00:11:35,005 --> 00:11:37,939
They're the hands of
an incredibly lovely man.

241
00:11:39,705 --> 00:11:41,205
Oh...

242
00:11:41,705 --> 00:11:42,772
Oh, I'm sorry‐

243
00:11:42,872 --> 00:11:44,872
I didn't mean to say‐
I mean I wasn't trying to‐

244
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:46,605
It's not that I want to‐
I mean I was jus‐

245
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,772
No‐ I understand‐
it's okay!

246
00:11:48,872 --> 00:11:50,572
Shizuku, you
must be dying.

247
00:11:50,672 --> 00:11:53,805
I mean you saw the way
that he was touching her right?

248
00:11:53,905 --> 00:11:54,939
How silly.

249
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:57,639
He's just giving a
lecture on swordsmanship.

250
00:11:57,739 --> 00:11:59,172
And unlike the
Pig Princess,

251
00:11:59,272 --> 00:12:00,872
she's not trying
to trick my brother

252
00:12:00,972 --> 00:12:02,439
into getting into
bed with her...

253
00:12:02,539 --> 00:12:04,039
Who you callin'
a pig?!

254
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:07,972
Besides...as long as it makes
my big brother really happy...

255
00:12:08,072 --> 00:12:10,439
I'll be okay if I'm
not the one with him...

256
00:12:10,539 --> 00:12:11,605
Huh?

257
00:12:11,705 --> 00:12:15,472
If my big brother finds someone
who makes him truly happy‐

258
00:12:15,572 --> 00:12:19,239
even if it isn't me...
as long as they never betray him

259
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:22,439
or bring him sorrow,
then I will be happy for him.

260
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:25,572
It's just... I don't think
there's anyone other than me

261
00:12:25,672 --> 00:12:27,572
who can do that...
not like I can.

262
00:12:27,672 --> 00:12:32,572
Shizuku... that was extremely
mature... for a kid...

263
00:12:32,672 --> 00:12:34,139
And maybe you have
a child's brain

264
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:36,539
because all you developed
were your breasts.

265
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:37,772
Or maybe your
huge thighs...

266
00:12:37,872 --> 00:12:39,072
My huge what?!

267
00:12:39,172 --> 00:12:41,639
I feel... like I
could get stronger...

268
00:12:41,739 --> 00:12:45,672
if we could just... continue
our training... together.

269
00:12:45,772 --> 00:12:49,272
So would it be alright with you
if we could do this again?

270
00:12:49,372 --> 00:12:50,605
Of course!

271
00:12:50,705 --> 00:12:52,072
I must...

272
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,272
I must make
myself stronger.

273
00:12:55,372 --> 00:12:57,839
Ayase:
I have to win
the selection matches...

274
00:12:57,939 --> 00:13:00,505
and make it to the
Seven Star...

275
00:13:10,605 --> 00:13:12,139
Hey, Ikki?

276
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:13,105
Yeah?

277
00:13:13,205 --> 00:13:17,672
Stella:
How was it? Touching
Ayatsuji's body everywhere?

278
00:13:17,772 --> 00:13:20,305
I‐I have nothing
to say about that.

279
00:13:23,972 --> 00:13:27,239
Ikki... here...

280
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:34,172
Stella,

281
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:38,205
I was only trying to help her
improve her stance‐ I promise.

282
00:13:39,772 --> 00:13:41,072
I know, but...

283
00:13:41,172 --> 00:13:45,305
I just... I just felt a
little insecure that's all...

284
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:48,139
Don't you worry.

285
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:51,839
The one that I need...
is you, Stella.

286
00:13:52,605 --> 00:13:53,939
Ikki...

287
00:14:07,739 --> 00:14:09,605
You are getting much faster!

288
00:14:09,705 --> 00:14:11,939
Thank you... Miss Stella!

289
00:14:16,972 --> 00:14:19,605
Ayase:
Thank you so much for
helping me, Kurogane!

290
00:14:19,705 --> 00:14:21,405
This is totally
my treat today...

291
00:14:21,505 --> 00:14:24,005
so you two go ahead and
order whatever you want!

292
00:14:24,105 --> 00:14:25,772
Thank you,
Ayatsuji...

293
00:14:25,872 --> 00:14:29,705
but uh... Stella...
are you still hungry?

294
00:14:29,805 --> 00:14:32,105
I can't help it.
I need to eat this much

295
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,239
or my body doesn't
move well.

296
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:35,672
I see.

297
00:14:35,772 --> 00:14:37,372
But four servings of
mixed grill,

298
00:14:37,472 --> 00:14:38,605
and three large
steaks...

299
00:14:38,705 --> 00:14:42,272
Ayase:
and you can still keep
that slender waistline?
I don't get it.

300
00:14:42,372 --> 00:14:42,772
Yeah.

301
00:14:42,872 --> 00:14:45,172
(nervous laughter)

302
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:49,072
Since I started
practicing with you,

303
00:14:49,172 --> 00:14:52,505
every day... has been a
major discovery for me.

304
00:14:52,605 --> 00:14:54,239
Little by little...

305
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:56,072
slowly but surely...

306
00:14:56,172 --> 00:14:58,905
I feel so much closer
to my father every day.

307
00:14:59,005 --> 00:15:01,539
Mister Kurogane...
I can't thank you enough.

308
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:04,905
Don't thank me‐ it's all
because of your hard work.

309
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:07,139
And besides‐ I'm certain
that eventually...

310
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,605
you'd have figured
it out yourself.

311
00:15:09,705 --> 00:15:12,005
Eventually wasn't
gonna cut it...

312
00:15:12,105 --> 00:15:14,805
to get back what was
taken from me.

313
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:18,139
Yo, it's you, Ayase!

314
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:19,272
(gasps)

315
00:15:19,372 --> 00:15:21,539
Hey, it's Ayase!

316
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:23,905
We haven't seen
you in forever!

317
00:15:24,005 --> 00:15:26,239
HEY GIRL!
Wassup?

318
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:28,605
(chuckles)

319
00:15:28,705 --> 00:15:32,172
Thug 1:
Hey, bitch! Don't ignore Kuraudo
when he's talking to you!

320
00:15:32,272 --> 00:15:35,272
Excuse me, but you're
being rude.

321
00:15:35,372 --> 00:15:36,772
Could you leave us?

322
00:15:36,872 --> 00:15:39,039
What?! Who the
fuck are you?

323
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:42,139
Thug 2:
Someone wants to
get his ass kicked!

324
00:15:44,005 --> 00:15:46,339
You're a swordsman,
aren't you?

325
00:15:50,272 --> 00:15:50,905
Heh.

326
00:15:51,005 --> 00:15:52,905
Hey that's my bad‐ bro.

327
00:15:53,005 --> 00:15:54,839
Sorry to interrupt.

328
00:15:54,939 --> 00:15:58,972
I just saw an old face,
so I had to say hi.

329
00:15:59,072 --> 00:16:02,839
Let me offer an...
apology.

330
00:16:02,939 --> 00:16:04,972
Sure, with
pleasure...

331
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:11,339
(chuckles)
A swordsman should
really keep his guard up

332
00:16:11,439 --> 00:16:11,739
Ikki!

333
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:12,772
Kurogane!

334
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:13,839
Kuraudo,
you're so bad!

335
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:17,372
(customers panicking)
Thug 1: YOU ARE ON THE
FUCKING EDGE DUDE!

336
00:16:17,472 --> 00:16:18,205
(growls)

337
00:16:18,305 --> 00:16:19,239
(gasps)

338
00:16:19,939 --> 00:16:20,472
(giggles)

339
00:16:20,572 --> 00:16:21,939
Kurado:
Listen up, asshole.

340
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:23,205
There's nothing
I like better

341
00:16:23,305 --> 00:16:26,572
than destroying weak little
sword‐swingers like you.

342
00:16:26,672 --> 00:16:30,872
So, Let's get it on...
You have your device, don't ya?

343
00:16:30,972 --> 00:16:32,472
You pieces of shit!

344
00:16:32,572 --> 00:16:35,772
I'm gonna send you back
to your families in an ashtray!

345
00:16:35,872 --> 00:16:37,072
Stella.

346
00:16:37,972 --> 00:16:40,605
His hand...
must've just slipped.

347
00:16:40,705 --> 00:16:42,472
It's nothing to fight about.

348
00:16:42,572 --> 00:16:44,305
Wh‐What the
hell are you...?

349
00:16:44,405 --> 00:16:45,172
Thug 1:
(laughs)

350
00:16:45,272 --> 00:16:49,139
Seriously? This guy got his head
busted and he's still smiling.

351
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:51,439
This sorry bastard
doesn't have any balls on him!

352
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:53,905
Hey it's natural to be
scared of Kuraudo,

353
00:16:54,005 --> 00:16:55,839
but where's your
fucking pride man?!

354
00:16:55,939 --> 00:16:58,739
Female Thug:
(giggles)
Look at him!

355
00:17:09,372 --> 00:17:10,339
Fuck it.

356
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:14,305
Messing with a baby like him
isn't good for the reputation.

357
00:17:14,405 --> 00:17:16,339
Let's go dudes.

358
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:18,205
Bye‐bye, baby boy!

359
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:21,972
You're lucky man‐ Kuraudo
doesn't bother with weaklings.

360
00:17:22,072 --> 00:17:25,172
Thug 2:
You can change your
diaper now baby!

361
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,088
What are you
doing, Ikki?!

362
00:17:33,188 --> 00:17:34,922
Letting these jackasses
say all they want!

363
00:17:35,022 --> 00:17:38,355
Ikki:
I mean, you obviously took the
first blow on purpose!

364
00:17:38,455 --> 00:17:39,455
(gasps)

365
00:17:39,555 --> 00:17:42,022
If I avoid it, it could
complicate things.

366
00:17:42,122 --> 00:17:45,722
I can't use my device
in a place like this.

367
00:17:45,822 --> 00:17:47,655
I could get expelled.

368
00:17:47,755 --> 00:17:49,322
Th‐That's true, but...

369
00:17:49,422 --> 00:17:51,455
You really didn't
need to use Intetsu

370
00:17:51,555 --> 00:17:52,922
to get rid of those jerks.

371
00:17:53,022 --> 00:17:54,188
I'm not so sure...

372
00:17:54,288 --> 00:17:55,255
Hm?

373
00:17:56,055 --> 00:17:58,155
He's very strong.

374
00:17:59,322 --> 00:18:01,388
Ayase:
(whimpers)

375
00:18:01,488 --> 00:18:04,788
Oh Wow, what a disaster,
what a misfortune.

376
00:18:04,888 --> 00:18:06,155
Huh?

377
00:18:06,255 --> 00:18:08,955
You've just met Kuraudo
Kurashiki‐ the Sword Eater.

378
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:10,622
He's the ace
of Donro Academy...

379
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:14,222
and he just picks on any and
everyone who gets his attention.

380
00:18:14,322 --> 00:18:17,688
But... you made a very
good call, Mr. Kurogane.

381
00:18:17,788 --> 00:18:20,155
Because he was one of the best
eight in last year's

382
00:18:20,255 --> 00:18:22,255
Seven Star Sword Art Festival.

383
00:18:22,355 --> 00:18:24,022
Kanata:
(giggles)

384
00:18:24,122 --> 00:18:26,522
Yes, that's absolutely right.

385
00:18:26,622 --> 00:18:29,488
If you actually did
resort to violence...

386
00:18:29,588 --> 00:18:34,088
then I'd have had no choice
but to take every single one
of you down right here.

387
00:18:34,188 --> 00:18:35,988
Ikki. Who are they?

388
00:18:36,088 --> 00:18:39,222
Ikki:
The Vice‐President of Hagun
Academy's student council,

389
00:18:39,322 --> 00:18:43,988
Utakata Misogi... and the
treasurer, Kanata Totokubara.

390
00:18:44,088 --> 00:18:45,655
Student council...?

391
00:18:45,755 --> 00:18:48,455
Yeah... lemme see
what I can do about your wound.

392
00:18:48,555 --> 00:18:51,655
At least I can...
make it feel better.

393
00:18:56,655 --> 00:18:57,622
Hey Kurogane...

394
00:18:57,722 --> 00:18:59,488
Are you gonna
be alright?

395
00:18:59,588 --> 00:19:01,922
Yeah... thanks to Misogi...

396
00:19:02,022 --> 00:19:04,622
It almost feels...
like the wound itself

397
00:19:04,722 --> 00:19:06,022
has completely disappeared.

398
00:19:06,122 --> 00:19:09,155
But more importantly...
who the hell are they?

399
00:19:14,822 --> 00:19:17,455
If you don't wanna answer that‐
you don't have to.

400
00:19:17,555 --> 00:19:20,122
Ikki:
But... if you're in some
kind of trouble with them,

401
00:19:20,222 --> 00:19:22,388
then I hope you'll
let me help you.

402
00:19:23,988 --> 00:19:25,655
Kurogane, I...

403
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:50,188
Thug 1:
That was awesome, what a coward!

404
00:19:50,288 --> 00:19:52,722
Thug 2:
Oh man did you guys see
the look on his face?!

405
00:19:52,822 --> 00:19:56,388
And how can he just keep smiling
after that? What an idiot!

406
00:19:56,488 --> 00:20:00,422
Thug 3:
Maybe he's just smart enough to
not go against Kuraudo.

407
00:20:06,588 --> 00:20:09,488
Female student:
One, two, three...

408
00:20:09,588 --> 00:20:11,655
Students:
One, two, three...

409
00:20:11,755 --> 00:20:15,488
She was so dedicated‐ where the
hell is she? It's weird.

410
00:20:15,588 --> 00:20:19,688
Well I'm sure the princess
is enjoying the sudden
decline in competition...

411
00:20:19,788 --> 00:20:21,622
You were so obviously
jealous of her.

412
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:23,955
That's not even what I was
talking about!

413
00:20:24,055 --> 00:20:27,588
Oh I'm sure you weren't...
"giant hippo legs."

414
00:20:27,688 --> 00:20:28,655
You better
shut up!

415
00:20:28,755 --> 00:20:29,388
Shizuku:
Well they're huge.

416
00:20:29,488 --> 00:20:30,855
Stella:
They're normal,
half‐pint!

417
00:20:30,955 --> 00:20:32,522
Shizuku:
That's what you
think, ya cow.

418
00:20:32,622 --> 00:20:33,022
(bird chirping)

419
00:20:33,122 --> 00:20:36,288
Alice:
So you... haven't
heard anything from her?

420
00:20:36,388 --> 00:20:37,688
Um why?

421
00:20:37,788 --> 00:20:41,388
If her goal is to make it to the
Seven Star Sword Art Festival,

422
00:20:41,488 --> 00:20:44,622
then she can't lose even one
fight in the selection match.

423
00:20:44,722 --> 00:20:48,255
But she has no chance of winning
tomorrow in the match with you.

424
00:20:49,388 --> 00:20:51,222
Alice:
And if that's
the case...

425
00:20:51,322 --> 00:20:54,622
Then our girl has to make
her move on you before then.

426
00:20:54,722 --> 00:20:56,255
Am I right?

427
00:20:57,922 --> 00:21:00,355
You don't miss much‐
do you Alice?

428
00:21:08,588 --> 00:21:10,122
And she sets her trap...

429
00:21:10,222 --> 00:21:17,255
Not Ayase. She would never
do something like that.

430
00:21:18,555 --> 00:21:21,688
She put all her
faith into my hands... ,/
so I'm going.
It'll be fine.

431
00:21:23,555 --> 00:21:25,622
Oh you are
so... shiny...

432
00:21:25,722 --> 00:21:27,222
I'm "shiny"?

433
00:21:27,322 --> 00:21:28,755
Yeah, shiny.

434
00:21:28,855 --> 00:21:30,822
You're sorta
like the sun.

435
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:32,222
I do envy you, that.

436
00:21:32,322 --> 00:21:36,622
I usually can't bring myself
to look at people straight on.

437
00:21:36,722 --> 00:21:41,222
However, I've grown quite adept
at seeing from the angles.

438
00:21:41,322 --> 00:21:46,288
You know‐ honey, you might have
to be prepared to end your
friendship with her.

439
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:49,622
You can't let her get into
your head and shake you...

440
00:21:52,255 --> 00:21:54,922
Thank you... ,/
But I won't be shaken‐
no matter what.

441
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:58,655
Ikki:
I'm going to keep the
promise I made to Stella.
