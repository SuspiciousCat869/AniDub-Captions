1
00:00:02,066 --> 00:00:05,266
ALRIGHT! Now‐ the selection
matches are really heating up!

2
00:00:05,366 --> 00:00:08,500
Hangetsu:
The stakes are getting high
and every battle is decisive!

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,033
Of course‐ all eyes
are on "Another One..."

4
00:00:11,133 --> 00:00:13,933
The still undefeated...
Ikki Kurogane!

5
00:00:14,033 --> 00:00:15,466
An easy win for Kurogane...

6
00:00:15,566 --> 00:00:18,566
now with a record
of twelve‐for‐twelve!

7
00:00:20,866 --> 00:00:22,600
Oh, some fresh air!

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,233
It's pretty cool of
the director to do this.

9
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:25,933
Sure is!

10
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:27,700
Everything's been
so hectic...

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,533
it's nice to get
a week off.

12
00:00:29,633 --> 00:00:30,633
Yeah some down time!

13
00:00:30,733 --> 00:00:34,200
And it sounds like she planned
a nice trip for us.

14
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,166
Kurono:
You two are the hopes
of the freshman class...

15
00:00:36,266 --> 00:00:40,133
so I'm inviting you to
attend the school's
training camp in Okutama.

16
00:00:40,233 --> 00:00:42,300
I... think you'll find
it enlightening...

17
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,466
Stella:
Oh, thank you so much!

18
00:00:44,566 --> 00:00:45,033
(giggles)

19
00:00:45,133 --> 00:00:47,433
We haven't had a chance to get
away alone together...

20
00:00:47,533 --> 00:00:49,700
this is going to be
really nice!

21
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,100
Oh hey!

22
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,466
Is this the kind of thing
people in Japan do before
they get engaged?

23
00:00:53,566 --> 00:00:55,200
What? Not exactly...

24
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,533
Oh, wow! Look Ikki!

25
00:00:57,633 --> 00:00:59,300
Stella:
It's gorgeous!

26
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,033
Hey! Can we go and see
that waterfall later?

27
00:01:02,133 --> 00:01:04,500
I've never seen one
like that up close before!

28
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,033
Ikki:
Well, she's having fun.
And I guess she's kinda right...

29
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:08,033
Ikki:
Well, she's having fun.
And I guess she's kinda right...
Stella:

30
00:01:08,133 --> 00:01:09,433
Stella:
Oh my God everything out here is
so beautiful I can't stand it!

31
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:10,733
(giggles)

32
00:02:43,866 --> 00:02:45,200
(sighs)

33
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,400
Honey‐ the sighs‐
oh my God!

34
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:47,600
Huh?

35
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,333
I know your heart
is heavy‐ dear,

36
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:52,000
but you sound like
a steam engine.

37
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,266
Shizuku:
I failed to prevent my big
brother from going on vacation

38
00:02:55,366 --> 00:02:57,333
with his flaming sex toy.

39
00:02:57,433 --> 00:02:59,600
I have a very good
reason to be sad.

40
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,633
If you would come with me,
I might at least feel
a little better...

41
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:06,600
Alice:
So sorry‐ love.
This girl's calendar is full.

42
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,666
Yeah... I know.

43
00:03:09,766 --> 00:03:10,800
Alice:
Oh, sweetheart...

44
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,300
Huh?

45
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,933
Alice:
Let me tell you one thing.

46
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:17,866
I might be wrong‐ but I have a
funny feeling what they're
going on is not a vacation.

47
00:03:17,966 --> 00:03:19,766
Call it women's
intuition.

48
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,066
Huh?

49
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:23,000
Achoo!

50
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,933
It's starting to get
a little cold...

51
00:03:25,033 --> 00:03:27,733
Are you okay...?
You want my jacket?

52
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,900
(giggles)

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,200
What's... so funny?

54
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:38,500
Stella:
I don't know! It's just that
this feels a little like
a boyfriend thing...

55
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,966
Ikki:
O‐Oh yeah? ,/
Well you know,
we're actually... uh you know.

56
00:03:42,066 --> 00:03:42,566
Uh...

57
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:45,733
Yeah‐ we're boyfriend
and girlfriend‐ I know!

58
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,433
Who is that?!

59
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,000
Stella:
That's the student council!

60
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,533
Stella:
Here I come! Be ready!

61
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:03,700
It's deep! But I can
still get it!

62
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,500
Not bad!

63
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:23,066
Not yet!

64
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:28,200
It's impressive...

65
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,433
it used to be badminton
but I think they've
invented something new...

66
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:34,500
Whatever it is,
your friend's helping...

67
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,366
As long as the two of
them are going at it‐

68
00:04:36,466 --> 00:04:37,933
none of us has to play
against Renren.

69
00:04:38,033 --> 00:04:41,966
It's exhausting to play her...
she's all over the place.

70
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:46,100
But of course... I don't believe
we came here today to have fun.

71
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,700
Oh really? You have
student council business?

72
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,600
Yes... actually.

73
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,900
But wait... did you two not
come here for the same reason?

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,366
Huh?

75
00:04:55,466 --> 00:04:57,900
You mean... you two
weren't made aware?

76
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,200
Uh... what...?

77
00:05:06,366 --> 00:05:09,633
We're not cleaning
the whole camp... are we?

78
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:10,666
Yes...

79
00:05:10,766 --> 00:05:11,233
One month from now,

80
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:15,100
the student representatives
are scheduled to have their
training camp out here.

81
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,600
Ikasuchi:
So before that happens, we have
to clean up the whole place.

82
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:23,166
The student council's job is so
much more boring than I thought.

83
00:05:23,266 --> 00:05:26,900
Whooooaaaaaaahhhh!

84
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,266
Ugh...

85
00:05:28,366 --> 00:05:31,300
Aren't you worried about
your clothes getting dirty?

86
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,233
Not at all...
I won't let them.

87
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:37,433
Whooooaaaaaaahhhh!

88
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:39,833
We didn't have enough people
to cover everything...

89
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:42,966
so we asked the director
to get us some helping hands.

90
00:05:43,066 --> 00:05:44,500
Oh, I see.

91
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,033
I'm glad she sent us
some dependable ones.

92
00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:49,966
Besides... Toka has been
dying to meet you guys.

93
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:52,333
Toka‐ the student
council president?!

94
00:05:52,433 --> 00:05:55,300
Yep, Toka Todo. She's slacking
off today, though.

95
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,066
Now‐ Vice President‐
that's misleading.

96
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:59,266
She's just come a little late

97
00:05:59,366 --> 00:06:00,900
because she has
an errand to run.

98
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,700
Oh yeah‐ is
that right?

99
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,433
(laughs)

100
00:06:03,533 --> 00:06:05,800
Utakata:
Well, I guess the
presidency is demanding...

101
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:10,200
(frustrated sigh)
I thought this trip was supposed
to be just for the two of us...

102
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,966
(car door closes)

103
00:06:12,066 --> 00:06:14,800
House Maid:
Welcome home, Miss Shizuku.

104
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,266
House Maid:
May I get you
something to drink?

105
00:06:17,366 --> 00:06:20,100
No‐ thank you‐
please leave me alone.

106
00:06:21,566 --> 00:06:22,766
(sighs)

107
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:26,400
Onitama:
(meows)

108
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,900
(meows)

109
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,666
(soft giggle)

110
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,466
I'm home, Onitama.
Did you miss me?

111
00:06:34,566 --> 00:06:38,066
Renren:
Oh? You're going to see
the waterfall? Right now?

112
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:41,866
Stella:
Yes! We saw it on the way out
and I told Ikki we had to visit.

113
00:06:41,966 --> 00:06:42,766
Right, Ikki?

114
00:06:42,866 --> 00:06:45,466
Juuuuuust
you two‐ huh?

115
00:06:45,566 --> 00:06:47,166
I uh...
uh‐huh...

116
00:06:47,266 --> 00:06:50,366
Oooooh, that's
how it is...

117
00:06:50,466 --> 00:06:51,100
(teasing giggle)

118
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,300
Uh‐ well then...

119
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,466
We're all finished with the
cleaning‐ aren't we?

120
00:06:54,566 --> 00:06:56,433
Yes. Much
thanks to you.

121
00:06:56,533 --> 00:07:00,200
And if we forgot something,
we'll just make Toka do it
whenever she shows up!

122
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,533
The waterfall's about
an hour's walk each way.

123
00:07:02,633 --> 00:07:05,100
Ikasuchi:
You should get out there
before the sun sets.

124
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,166
Thanks! Ya
ready... Stella?

125
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,066
Stella?

126
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,100
Huh? Oh yeah,
let's go!

127
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,600
Okay everyone,
see you later!

128
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,533
Hm?

129
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,766
Bye! Do your
very best!

130
00:07:21,866 --> 00:07:23,766
Huh? At what?

131
00:07:23,866 --> 00:07:25,700
Who knows?

132
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,433
Ikki:
Phew. This is steeper
than I thought.

133
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:36,100
It could be good for
our training though...

134
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,666
Don't you think, Stella?

135
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,966
What's wrong?
Are you getting tired?

136
00:07:42,066 --> 00:07:44,666
Huh? Oh no.
I'm alright...

137
00:07:44,766 --> 00:07:46,366
Come on, what's up?

138
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,900
You only had two large
bowls at lunch today.

139
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,466
Normally, you'd
easily eat seven...

140
00:07:51,566 --> 00:07:54,566
I wasn't hungry‐ OKAY?!
Not enough exercise!

141
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:56,133
Oh okay‐ I see...

142
00:07:56,233 --> 00:07:58,466
Well we... should go back
to the camp and...

143
00:07:58,566 --> 00:08:00,266
WE SHOULD NOT!

144
00:08:00,366 --> 00:08:02,966
We finally get
to be alone.

145
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,366
Okay, but...

146
00:08:04,466 --> 00:08:07,466
This little mountain road is
nothing‐ don't worry about it!

147
00:08:07,566 --> 00:08:08,533
Okay then? Let's go!

148
00:08:08,633 --> 00:08:10,233
Um... sure...

149
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:13,400
Shizuku:
(giggles)

150
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,800
Oh this one is so adorable!
Don't you think so, Onitama?

151
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,133
Onitama:
(meows)

152
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:21,200
(door knocks)

153
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:21,733
House Maid:
Miss Shizuku?

154
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,400
House Maid:
Miss Shizuku?
Leave me!

155
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,733
House Maid:
The master is waiting
for you in the drawing room.

156
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,733
Father's waiting...?

157
00:08:32,748 --> 00:08:35,099
(thunder rolls)

158
00:08:35,199 --> 00:08:37,633
(panting)

159
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:41,433
Stella... That's enough‐
we have to stop...

160
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:43,799
Yeah... to be honest..

161
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:45,799
my body feels really heavy...

162
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:49,533
and I feel dizzy,
and I wanna throw up.

163
00:08:49,633 --> 00:08:51,866
Maybe the kiss the other day
got me pregnant?

164
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:54,333
Huh?! No I don't think
that's how it works...

165
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:59,233
Well yeah but isn't
this... what they call...
morning sickness?

166
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:03,833
Umm... have you considered
it might just be a cold?

167
00:09:03,933 --> 00:09:04,766
A cold...?

168
00:09:04,866 --> 00:09:07,533
Oh, I see...
I've heard of these...

169
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:09,666
These little
bugs invade you...

170
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:11,633
and make you
feel terrible...

171
00:09:11,733 --> 00:09:12,433
I had no idea...

172
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:15,099
Ikki:
You mean you've never
had a cold before?!

173
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:17,833
No, never...
it's awful...

174
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:21,433
(panting)
Can barely
move my body...

175
00:09:21,533 --> 00:09:23,999
like it's not even
listening to me...

176
00:09:24,099 --> 00:09:27,199
Ikki:
We should get back
to camp right away.

177
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:30,766
Stella:
I'm sorry...
I ruined our trip.

178
00:09:30,866 --> 00:09:32,966
Ikki:
Nah, don't worry
about that...

179
00:09:35,766 --> 00:09:38,066
You've gotta be kidding me!

180
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,966
Thank God we found
this place....

181
00:09:52,999 --> 00:09:54,466
Oh, thank you.

182
00:09:54,566 --> 00:09:55,999
Lemme check you...

183
00:09:56,999 --> 00:09:59,933
I knew it...
high fever...

184
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:02,866
Stella, you should take off
those wet clothes.

185
00:10:02,966 --> 00:10:06,066
All they're doing is lowering
your body temperature.

186
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:15,133
I know what to do...
I'll take mine off too!

187
00:10:15,233 --> 00:10:18,933
If we're both naked,
you won't be embarrassed‐ right?

188
00:10:19,033 --> 00:10:20,133
Uh...!

189
00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:23,099
(giggles)

190
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:24,866
Huh? What...?

191
00:10:24,966 --> 00:10:28,499
It reminds me of the
very first time we met.

192
00:10:28,599 --> 00:10:30,766
You were like...
so suddenly...

193
00:10:30,866 --> 00:10:34,766
(nervous laughter)
Oh, yeah,
that's right!

194
00:10:35,866 --> 00:10:39,133
You saw pretty much
all of me that day...

195
00:10:39,233 --> 00:10:41,666
so it's not
a... big deal...

196
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:53,899
Stella:
(struggling)

197
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:08,133
Stella... I'll help,
if you want...

198
00:11:13,033 --> 00:11:16,099
Yes please...
I don't mind.

199
00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:17,799
Okay.

200
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,333
Here you go...

201
00:11:20,433 --> 00:11:22,166
Don't make her
uncomfortable...

202
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:23,933
don't embarrass her...

203
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:27,466
Let's just... keep
this businesslike...

204
00:11:27,566 --> 00:11:30,699
(panting)

205
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:37,233
(nervous sigh)

206
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:41,133
Ikki:
(sharp breath)

207
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,166
(gulp)

208
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:57,466
(sighs)

209
00:11:57,566 --> 00:11:59,433
Okay... blouse
is next...

210
00:11:59,533 --> 00:12:02,633
Okay...
okay... um...

211
00:12:17,766 --> 00:12:18,699
(frantic breath)

212
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:21,233
OhmyGod‐ohmyGod‐ohmyGod‐ohmyGod!

213
00:12:27,566 --> 00:12:29,299
(sighs)

214
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:31,933
Oh my God I think
I made it...

215
00:12:32,033 --> 00:12:33,066
Stella:
Ikki?

216
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,033
Uh‐huh?

217
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:40,666
Could you... maybe um... help
me... take off... my bra...?

218
00:12:40,766 --> 00:12:41,999
(panicked gasp)

219
00:12:42,099 --> 00:12:44,666
It's hard... for me
to breathe...

220
00:12:44,766 --> 00:12:46,566
If you could
just please...

221
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:49,299
unhook the
front... for me?

222
00:12:50,633 --> 00:12:51,966
Sure...

223
00:12:52,999 --> 00:12:53,899
Okay, so...

224
00:12:53,999 --> 00:12:57,366
Ikki & Stella:
(panting)

225
00:12:57,466 --> 00:13:01,466
Ikki:
(heart pounding)

226
00:13:01,566 --> 00:13:04,366
Ikki:
Hyaaa! Haaah!

227
00:13:04,466 --> 00:13:05,666
Ahhh!

228
00:13:05,766 --> 00:13:07,533
Stella:
(panting)

229
00:13:11,099 --> 00:13:12,633
Thank you.

230
00:13:13,366 --> 00:13:15,366
I feel...
much better now...

231
00:13:15,466 --> 00:13:17,599
Y‐You're welcome.

232
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:19,533
I'm sorry Ikki...

233
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,299
for being so
much trouble.

234
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:23,066
No way.
You're sick‐

235
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,699
it's not
your fault!

236
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:28,233
That too, but well,
you look like...

237
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,699
you're having
a hard time, so...

238
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:31,766
Ikki:
Huh?

239
00:13:31,866 --> 00:13:36,133
Stella:
I mean, you're kind
of bulging down there...

240
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:37,266
Huh?

241
00:13:38,533 --> 00:13:40,299
Oooh!
(frantic laughter)

242
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,233
I can explain
this... See‐

243
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,399
sometimes this happens when
a man when he gets... I m‐mean‐

244
00:13:43,499 --> 00:13:45,299
uh, what do I mean?
I mean if we could just sorta

245
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:48,566
overlook this right now,
I'd really appreciate it...!

246
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,266
I'm sorry!

247
00:13:50,366 --> 00:13:52,866
No. Don't apologize.

248
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:56,666
It doesn't bother me because
it's just a part of you...

249
00:13:56,766 --> 00:13:59,299
Actually‐ it makes me happy...

250
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:02,766
That you can get excited like
that when you're looking at me.

251
00:14:02,866 --> 00:14:06,066
Uh‐ Well yeah‐ Of course
I could! How could I not?!

252
00:14:18,499 --> 00:14:19,499
Hey, Ikki?

253
00:14:19,599 --> 00:14:20,733
Uh‐huh?

254
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:24,866
Do you...
want to...?

255
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,699
HUUUUUH?!

256
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:31,599
Oh my God, do you...
know you're saying...?

257
00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:34,233
I do.
So do you...?

258
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:49,366
Ikki:
Sorry.

259
00:14:49,466 --> 00:14:52,033
I... can't
answer that.

260
00:14:52,133 --> 00:14:53,299
Hm?

261
00:14:54,266 --> 00:14:55,999
Stella...

262
00:14:56,099 --> 00:14:58,766
I want to stand proudly
in front of everyone...

263
00:14:58,866 --> 00:15:00,966
and tell them how
I feel about you...

264
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:04,566
But... if we do "that"
before I have,

265
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:07,699
it'd be an offense...
to your parents...

266
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:09,799
and to my own
family....

267
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:11,966
Ikki:
I hope you don't think
I'm a coward...

268
00:15:12,066 --> 00:15:14,133
but I think
we should wait.

269
00:15:14,233 --> 00:15:16,533
So... I'm sorry.

270
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:18,933
Oh no! It's fine.

271
00:15:19,033 --> 00:15:21,533
It means that you're serious
about our relationship.

272
00:15:21,633 --> 00:15:23,266
Which is good...

273
00:15:23,366 --> 00:15:24,833
'Cause I am...

274
00:15:26,566 --> 00:15:27,666
(phone ringing)

275
00:15:28,633 --> 00:15:29,133
Oh the phone!

276
00:15:29,233 --> 00:15:32,499
What a relief, they must've
noticed that we've been
missing a while...

277
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:33,866
I'll get it.

278
00:15:35,133 --> 00:15:38,499
Hello? Yes...
this is Kurogane.

279
00:15:38,599 --> 00:15:40,466
Oh, yes, thank
you very much.

280
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:42,366
Um... actually we're
at the mountain lodge.

281
00:15:42,466 --> 00:15:46,133
It started raining pretty hard
so we took shelter...

282
00:15:48,366 --> 00:15:50,066
I am so...

283
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:53,233
Naughty!

284
00:15:58,433 --> 00:16:01,599
Akaza:
I see, I see, very good...

285
00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:03,099
(snickers)

286
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:03,533
(phone beeps)

287
00:16:03,633 --> 00:16:06,499
Well‐ it seems
I've located him...

288
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:07,099
(chuckles)

289
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,833
And now it's time
to let it all run wild...

290
00:16:17,998 --> 00:16:19,431
Shizuku:
Excuse me.

291
00:16:19,531 --> 00:16:21,231
(door opens)

292
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,153
Did you call for me... Father?

293
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,253
Shizuku. It's been a while.

294
00:16:29,353 --> 00:16:31,587
Please just tell me why
you called for me.

295
00:16:31,687 --> 00:16:34,553
Why don't you have a seat.
Let's have a little talk.

296
00:16:34,653 --> 00:16:38,387
If it's not pressing‐ I'll
return to my room. I'm tired.

297
00:16:38,487 --> 00:16:41,287
And I'm only here because I
received a letter from mother...

298
00:16:41,387 --> 00:16:44,420
Your mother wrote that letter
because I told her to.

299
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,787
What?

300
00:16:45,887 --> 00:16:48,720
Had it been from me,
I doubt youd've read it.

301
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,020
Did I assume
correctly?

302
00:16:51,853 --> 00:16:53,720
What is it that you want?

303
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,087
Only to find out
if my daughter,

304
00:16:55,187 --> 00:16:58,553
who's living away from
her family... is doing well.

305
00:16:59,587 --> 00:17:00,653
Isn't that enough?

306
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:04,387
I'm assuming you've heard
everything you need to
know from the federation.

307
00:17:04,487 --> 00:17:07,387
Of course I've heard about your
progress in the selection match.

308
00:17:07,487 --> 00:17:09,520
Twelve games,
twelve victories.

309
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:12,153
That's living up to
the name of Kurogane.

310
00:17:12,253 --> 00:17:14,887
You make me very
proud...Shizuku.

311
00:17:16,387 --> 00:17:18,953
With your abilities‐
you're sure to selected.

312
00:17:19,053 --> 00:17:20,520
Just don't lower
your guard...

313
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,553
My big brother
is also winning!

314
00:17:23,587 --> 00:17:26,620
Does he make you proud...
my loving father?

315
00:17:27,953 --> 00:17:29,220
You mean, Ikki?

316
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:33,020
How nice. You can still
remember his name.

317
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,420
Do you care about
him at all‐ Father?!

318
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,120
Yes I do.

319
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,053
All you do is lie!

320
00:17:43,453 --> 00:17:45,253
(door slams)

321
00:17:56,553 --> 00:17:58,820
(earth tremor)

322
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,187
(fierce tremor)

323
00:18:14,853 --> 00:18:16,487
Stella!

324
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,053
Uhhh... Ikki?

325
00:18:30,153 --> 00:18:33,153
Stay here. I'll
take care of this.

326
00:18:33,253 --> 00:18:36,053
Come to me, Intetsu.

327
00:18:36,153 --> 00:18:39,520
The First Secret
Sword... Saigeki!

328
00:18:44,587 --> 00:18:46,153
What?!

329
00:18:46,253 --> 00:18:48,320
The hell is this thing?!

330
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,587
Why are they after us?

331
00:18:54,453 --> 00:18:55,653
Ikki!

332
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,020
Stella no!

333
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,187
STELLA!

334
00:19:07,787 --> 00:19:09,520
STELLA!

335
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:15,387
Sorry for the wait, Stella!

336
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,153
Renren? Thank you...

337
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,453
Saijo!

338
00:19:21,553 --> 00:19:24,320
We'll take care
of this, Kurogane.

339
00:19:31,787 --> 00:19:33,853
A sick girl
needs her rest!

340
00:19:33,953 --> 00:19:35,953
Stella... Hey,
are you alright?

341
00:19:36,053 --> 00:19:38,653
Ikki... What
about you?

342
00:19:38,753 --> 00:19:40,187
Yeah. Sorta.

343
00:19:40,287 --> 00:19:42,820
Well, we got here just in time!

344
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,253
Lucky for us!

345
00:19:44,353 --> 00:19:46,320
Misogi...

346
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,353
Utakata:
Wow these guys look a
little tricky, don't they?

347
00:19:49,453 --> 00:19:49,920
Ikki:
Yeah.

348
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,753
They'll keep coming
until we find out

349
00:19:51,853 --> 00:19:54,587
where they're coming from.

350
00:19:54,687 --> 00:19:57,753
There must be a blazer somewhere
who's controlling them.

351
00:19:57,853 --> 00:19:59,120
Utakata:
You're probably right.

352
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,320
This looks like the the work
of a "steel wire user."

353
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,553
Ikki:
"A steel wire user"?

354
00:20:02,653 --> 00:20:04,820
Utakata:
It's a blazer who
uses magical strings

355
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,053
to remote‐control
inorganic substances.

356
00:20:07,153 --> 00:20:08,520
Some of them are able
to control them

357
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:11,787
from several dozens
of kilometers away...

358
00:20:11,887 --> 00:20:13,587
Then what do I do?

359
00:20:13,687 --> 00:20:16,053
Toka:
No matter how
far away they are...

360
00:20:16,153 --> 00:20:19,187
they're all connected by
the same magical power.

361
00:20:19,287 --> 00:20:22,587
So you trace the string,
and find the source.

362
00:20:24,387 --> 00:20:26,987
Haaaaa!

363
00:20:47,453 --> 00:20:50,987
Golem:
(roars)

364
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,487
Raikiri!

365
00:21:08,587 --> 00:21:11,220
Ahhhhh!

366
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,820
Oh? It appears they've sent you
a lightning attack

367
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,987
through the string...

368
00:21:17,087 --> 00:21:18,653
Well... that'll do.

369
00:21:18,753 --> 00:21:21,587
I guess we'll have
to come up with something...

370
00:21:21,687 --> 00:21:23,653
more interesting for our boy...

371
00:21:23,753 --> 00:21:25,587
(snickers)

372
00:21:30,087 --> 00:21:33,020
(laughs)
Well done,
Miss President.

373
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,253
Impressive
as always.

374
00:21:35,953 --> 00:21:37,020
(gasps)

375
00:21:40,287 --> 00:21:42,553
Ikki:
She made it all the way
to the quarterfinals

376
00:21:42,653 --> 00:21:45,020
at last year's Festival...!

377
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,287
She's the strongest knight
at Hagun Academy!

378
00:21:50,887 --> 00:21:52,620
Toka Todo...!

379
00:21:57,387 --> 00:21:58,353
(phone rings)

380
00:21:58,453 --> 00:21:59,487
Oh?

381
00:21:59,953 --> 00:22:01,087
(gasps)

382
00:22:05,487 --> 00:22:08,120
(chuckles)

383
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,320
Well... interesting...!

384
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:14,387
See you on the field...
Miss President...
