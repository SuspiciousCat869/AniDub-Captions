1
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,533
If you can't achieve, then you
shouldn't achieve.

2
00:00:11,633 --> 00:00:13,866
And that's all I
ever wanted from you.

3
00:00:13,966 --> 00:00:18,500
Utakata:
She's an inspiration and a
comfort to all the kids here...

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,433
Ikki:
What could I ever
have hoped for...?

5
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:25,533
The wielder of an empty...
worthless sword...

6
00:00:30,233 --> 00:00:32,833
Toka:
You guys! You already
made a banner?

7
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:35,833
Well‐ we don't want to
get too far ahead of
ourselves after all!

8
00:00:35,933 --> 00:00:40,633
It's not even certain
that I'll be in the Seven Star
Sword Art Festival...

9
00:00:42,933 --> 00:00:43,166
Yeah.

10
00:00:43,266 --> 00:00:47,266
When the selection matches
are over, I'll come back for a
little while, sound good?

11
00:00:47,366 --> 00:00:49,900
Alrighty then.
Talk to you soon.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,133
Bye‐bye, Mother.

13
00:00:51,233 --> 00:00:52,566
(phone beeps)

14
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:54,533
How was the director?
She sound good?

15
00:00:54,633 --> 00:00:58,066
Uh‐huh. She said everyone
is doing really great.

16
00:00:58,166 --> 00:00:58,933
(door knocks)

17
00:00:59,033 --> 00:01:01,133
Uh... coming!

18
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:04,100
Well hello.
Glad you're here!

19
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,833
Thank you so much
for coming tonight...

20
00:01:08,933 --> 00:01:10,466
Miss Kurogane.

21
00:01:18,337 --> 00:01:20,666
So what happened in your
audience with Madame President?

22
00:01:25,733 --> 00:01:26,199
Oh!

23
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:27,366
You're aware...

24
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:29,466
that I'm scheduled to fight
your older brother

25
00:01:29,566 --> 00:01:31,399
in the battle tomorrow...?

26
00:01:31,766 --> 00:01:33,333
Yes.

27
00:01:33,433 --> 00:01:35,899
Those unbelievable
assholes...

28
00:01:35,999 --> 00:01:36,833
I agree.

29
00:01:36,933 --> 00:01:39,799
I don't like the way the
Federation does things either...

30
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:42,999
But you understand I must
accept their decision.

31
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,633
I've heard that he's not being
kept in very good condition...

32
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:52,866
Toka:
But I know... that when he walks
out onto that battlefield...

33
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,899
he'll fight with
everything he's got.

34
00:01:56,999 --> 00:01:58,233
And so will I.

35
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:01,333
Anything less
would dishonor him.

36
00:02:01,433 --> 00:02:04,766
I'll have to fight him with
all my heart and soul.

37
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:10,433
That's why... I wanted to
ask you for a favor...

38
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:16,633
She wants you to ask Ikki
to withdraw... God...

39
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:18,666
So what did you
tell her?

40
00:02:18,766 --> 00:02:21,866
I said I needed
time to.. think...

41
00:02:22,466 --> 00:02:24,233
What do
I do Alice?

42
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:28,033
Should I ask him to
withdraw from the match?

43
00:02:28,133 --> 00:02:30,499
Only you can answer
that, my love.

44
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:33,933
You're the only one in your
family that Ikki opens up to.

45
00:02:34,033 --> 00:02:38,766
And you also know first hand,
just how strong Toka Todo is.

46
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:44,699
If Kurogane... withdraws
from the fight and I win...

47
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:47,099
or even if he
fights and I win...

48
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:50,533
Can I be proud... of going
to the national competition

49
00:02:50,633 --> 00:02:53,033
after winning the
battle like that?

50
00:02:53,133 --> 00:02:54,633
I don't know...

51
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:55,666
It's true.

52
00:02:55,766 --> 00:02:59,366
The match is being fixed
by adults to serve their
own selfish ends...

53
00:02:59,466 --> 00:03:03,833
but you're gonna have to
fight in a way that you
can be proud of‐ Toka...

54
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:07,699
And I'll bet ya,
that's what Ikki would want.

55
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:12,999
Yeah. I guess no matter how it
turns out, that's all I can do.

56
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:32,566
Hangetsu:
Ladies and gentlemen,

57
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:35,399
it's the final day of the
school's selection match!

58
00:03:35,499 --> 00:03:36,833
We've got a steamy
morning outside,

59
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:39,466
but the heat
is coming from right here!

60
00:03:39,566 --> 00:03:41,466
Six matches on
six battlefields today,

61
00:03:41,566 --> 00:03:46,266
and those six winners get their
tickets to the Seven Star
Sword Art Festival!

62
00:03:46,366 --> 00:03:47,533
I don't have to tell you...

63
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:50,233
that all the combatants
today are very tough fighters

64
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:53,199
who've each won all 19
of their matches so far!

65
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:55,466
Among them: Princess
Stella Vermillion,

66
00:03:55,566 --> 00:03:57,966
otherwise known as
the Crimson Princess!

67
00:03:58,066 --> 00:04:00,499
Her opponent today is one
of the school's representatives

68
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:03,166
from last year,
The double‐bladed junior...

69
00:04:03,266 --> 00:04:04,366
Mizuki Ohinata!

70
00:04:04,466 --> 00:04:08,566
But the fight that is getting
everyone's attention today
is this one folks!

71
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,566
One of the top four
fighters of last year's

72
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:14,566
Seven Star Sword Art Festival,
Toka Todo, vs the unbeaten

73
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,633
F‐rank knight: Ikki Kurogane!

74
00:04:16,733 --> 00:04:18,733
The battlefield is
packed with spectators,

75
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:21,433
all waiting to see
the battle of the century.

76
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:23,166
And‐ highly irregular, folks‐

77
00:04:23,266 --> 00:04:26,433
this match is being
broadcast live on TV!

78
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:28,233
The sound of
the helicopters above us

79
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,499
is only adding to the
excitement down here!

80
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:32,966
With me is Miss Nene Saikyo...

81
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:33,733
Miss Ne‐

82
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,466
Oh!

83
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:40,266
Oh my God, she left me all
by myself up here AGAIN!

84
00:04:41,366 --> 00:04:44,499
Oh my. This is a little
overboard‐ isn't it?

85
00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:46,799
Rather stringent conditions
for the Federation

86
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:49,366
to allow him to fight
at the school‐ don't you think?

87
00:04:49,466 --> 00:04:51,466
I do. And amidst
all this‐

88
00:04:51,566 --> 00:04:53,933
they've "arranged"
for him to battle Toka Todo.

89
00:04:54,033 --> 00:04:56,999
They're just dying to
watch him fail...

90
00:04:57,099 --> 00:05:00,566
There's only one way for Ikki
to make it out of this intact...

91
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,099
and that is to win this battle.

92
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,399
Oh, I finally found you!

93
00:05:06,499 --> 00:05:07,866
Oh yes...
good morning...

94
00:05:07,966 --> 00:05:08,366
Ugh!

95
00:05:08,466 --> 00:05:09,966
Oh God‐ what are
you doing here?

96
00:05:10,066 --> 00:05:12,233
It was a special
surprise dear!

97
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,666
"Surprise" my ass!
Waddyou want?!

98
00:05:14,766 --> 00:05:18,833
My favorite pupil gives a
colorful greeting as always.

99
00:05:18,933 --> 00:05:21,899
But that's part of what
makes her so adorable!

100
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:25,266
Adorable?! Well that is
not at all appropriate!

101
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,399
Nene. You know you love
the old man...

102
00:05:27,499 --> 00:05:31,166
Love is gross and old men
are gross and I don't wanna
go near either of 'em!

103
00:05:31,266 --> 00:05:32,799
She's so precious!

104
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,399
(laughter)

105
00:05:34,499 --> 00:05:36,399
Master Torajiro Nango,

106
00:05:36,499 --> 00:05:38,133
welcome to Hagun.

107
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:40,633
Did you come to see
Toka Todo's fight?

108
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:43,699
Exactly, she's another
of my favorite pupils.

109
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:47,633
Though... I probably should've
waited until the Seven Star...

110
00:05:47,733 --> 00:05:50,899
but I just had to see
the Kurogane boy...

111
00:05:50,999 --> 00:05:53,399
Master Nango and Ryoma Kurogane

112
00:05:53,499 --> 00:05:55,566
are relics from
the same bygone era!

113
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,933
Weren't you
lifelong adversaries?

114
00:05:58,033 --> 00:05:58,966
Hmm...

115
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:00,999
Mr. Akaza...

116
00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:02,333
Sly Akaza...

117
00:06:02,433 --> 00:06:04,899
Unfortunately for everyone,
Master Nango...

118
00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:08,133
It seems increasingly apparent
that today's match

119
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:09,999
may just have to be canceled.

120
00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:10,866
(snickers)

121
00:06:10,966 --> 00:06:11,866
Canceled?

122
00:06:11,966 --> 00:06:14,499
Female PA:
May I have your
attention, please...

123
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:15,733
It's already time to start,

124
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:19,299
but Ikki Kurogane hasn't yet
arrived on the grounds.

125
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,999
According to
selection match rules,

126
00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:23,899
Mr. Kurogane has 15 minutes
to report to the arena

127
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:28,066
for his battle, or he will
concede the match by default.

128
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,566
Mr. Akaza...

129
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:32,433
It was the Federation's
responsibility to see that

130
00:06:32,533 --> 00:06:33,933
Mr. Kurogane got here...

131
00:06:34,033 --> 00:06:37,366
And I'm sure there must've
been some miscommunication...

132
00:06:37,466 --> 00:06:39,733
I arrived to collect
the young man myself‐

133
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,199
but he'd already left
on his own...

134
00:06:41,299 --> 00:06:44,833
Akaza:
But... he's a big boy‐
so I'm sure he'll be fine.

135
00:06:44,933 --> 00:06:46,433
(panting)

136
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:49,866
Unless misfortune befalls
him along the way...

137
00:06:49,966 --> 00:06:52,333
(snickers)

138
00:06:52,433 --> 00:06:55,599
Oh, apparently we'd confiscated
his student handbook...

139
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:58,766
we thought you'd appreciate
having it back.

140
00:06:58,866 --> 00:07:03,599
(panting)

141
00:07:04,566 --> 00:07:06,433
Ryoma:
Does it frustrate you kid...?

142
00:07:06,533 --> 00:07:09,033
Does it upset you‐
to be the weakest one?

143
00:07:09,133 --> 00:07:12,699
That's good, you hold on
to that feeling. It's proof...

144
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:16,766
that feeling means
that you are not yet ready...

145
00:07:16,866 --> 00:07:18,666
to give up on yourself.

146
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:26,966
How much good have those "words
of wisdom" really done for you?

147
00:07:27,066 --> 00:07:31,899
Maybe he was just a crazy,
irresponsible, senile old man...

148
00:07:31,999 --> 00:07:33,033
And you took him seriously‐

149
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:36,733
and you spent your whole life
trying to live up to an
impossible ideal.

150
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:41,066
We all have our limits and
our place in this world
is defined by them.

151
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,499
All that
old man did...

152
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:45,366
was bring you more
pain and loneliness.

153
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,999
And all you got out of it
is this pathetic little sword

154
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:55,766
that nobody else in
the whole world cares about.

155
00:07:57,733 --> 00:07:59,933
How could such a useless
and ungifted knight

156
00:08:00,033 --> 00:08:03,466
who was tossed away ever
hope to defeat Raikiri?

157
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,366
Don't you think
you've had enough?

158
00:08:05,466 --> 00:08:08,933
Aren't you tired of hanging on
to some old man's nonsense?

159
00:08:09,033 --> 00:08:10,966
Let it go...

160
00:08:38,499 --> 00:08:40,199
You're going
to be alright...

161
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:41,966
I've got you now...

162
00:08:42,066 --> 00:08:44,099
I don't want
you to go.

163
00:08:44,199 --> 00:08:45,633
Please don't go.

164
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,866
I don't want you
to fight her.

165
00:08:47,966 --> 00:08:49,766
Shizuku...

166
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:52,966
But I realize...

167
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:56,233
I would never be able to
stop you even if I wanted...

168
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,366
Back when we were
growing up together...

169
00:08:58,466 --> 00:09:02,033
I can't remember ever seeing
you smile not even once...

170
00:09:02,133 --> 00:09:03,566
But you do when you're here...

171
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:06,766
and I want you to do
what makes you happy...

172
00:09:12,199 --> 00:09:13,299
Ayase:
Kurogane!

173
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:14,666
Kagami:
Over here!

174
00:09:14,766 --> 00:09:17,166
Manabe:
Haha! My Main Master!

175
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:18,733
We're all waiting for you
to get in there

176
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:22,366
and make us proud
Mister Kurogane!

177
00:09:22,466 --> 00:09:25,533
Kurogane... we all
believe that you can do it!

178
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:28,566
You had the balls to beat me,
so let's see'em again!

179
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,399
You're the samurai
I respect.

180
00:09:30,499 --> 00:09:33,033
You've gotta keep
striving Ikki. Go get her!

181
00:09:33,133 --> 00:09:35,333
Get in there
and ace her, Master!

182
00:09:35,433 --> 00:09:36,466
Our next front page...

183
00:09:36,566 --> 00:09:40,866
is gonna say "Ikki Kurogane
Wins A Flawless Victory!"

184
00:09:40,966 --> 00:09:42,333
Thanks guys...

185
00:09:42,433 --> 00:09:45,099
You can see that you're
not alone‐ Big Brother.

186
00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:46,466
Look at all
those people.

187
00:09:46,566 --> 00:09:48,866
You've inspired every
single one of them.

188
00:09:48,966 --> 00:09:50,766
And they all
believe in you.

189
00:09:52,099 --> 00:09:52,933
Ikki!

190
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:59,566
I'm keeping my promise and I am
going to the Seven Star
Sword Art Festival!

191
00:10:11,766 --> 00:10:13,366
Of course.

192
00:10:13,466 --> 00:10:16,733
How could I ever have
questioned it?

193
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:20,699
Stella... I have
a promise to keep...

194
00:10:21,766 --> 00:10:25,799
It's you and me!
All the way!

195
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:29,499
A text from Renren...
Kurogane's just arrived.

196
00:10:29,599 --> 00:10:30,699
Well...

197
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:35,766
Hm?!

198
00:10:37,133 --> 00:10:39,433
I gotta
go... Uta.

199
00:10:39,533 --> 00:10:43,033
Yup! You have a
good battle... Toka.

200
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:46,233
Hangetsu:
Okay everybody,
the long wait is over!

201
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,533
We'll now begin the
final selection match...

202
00:10:48,633 --> 00:10:51,599
for the Seven Star
Sword Art Festival!

203
00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:53,333
Entering from the East Gate,

204
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:56,999
it's Toka "Raikiri" Todo,
The Lightning Cutter!

205
00:10:57,099 --> 00:10:57,733
(cheers and applause)

206
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,099
A shining star
on a glorious path,

207
00:11:00,199 --> 00:11:02,566
looking ready for the showdown!

208
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:06,366
And, entering opposite
her from the West Gate...

209
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:10,966
it's the Worst One,
Ikki Kurogane!

210
00:11:11,066 --> 00:11:11,799
He's been through Hell‐

211
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:14,233
and he looks a little
worse for the wear,

212
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:14,899
But here he is!

213
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:18,933
Looking lean and mean and
more than ready to do battle!

214
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,966
Miss Alice!
How'd it go?!

215
00:11:44,066 --> 00:11:48,033
(chuckles)
My opponent was
very gracious.

216
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:50,399
So, how's
our boy doing?

217
00:11:50,499 --> 00:11:52,833
Kurogane is
completely exhausted.

218
00:11:52,933 --> 00:11:55,133
I wonder what
they did to him...

219
00:11:55,233 --> 00:11:58,899
It could be the boy was enjoying
himself and stayed out too late

220
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:00,333
Akaza:
(snickers)

221
00:12:00,433 --> 00:12:03,366
Toka:
I'm so sorry, Kurogane.

222
00:12:03,466 --> 00:12:06,233
I know that you're
tired and wounded.

223
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,699
But I still can't help...

224
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:10,899
being excited about
this battle today.

225
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:14,766
Because ever since...
the first time I saw you fight,

226
00:12:14,866 --> 00:12:17,233
I've been imagining...

227
00:12:24,733 --> 00:12:26,599
What it'd be like to fight you!

228
00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:29,666
I feel exactly
the same way, Toka...

229
00:12:29,766 --> 00:12:31,999
And now that I'm
standing here...

230
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:32,899
I will not shame you,

231
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:36,266
or any of the good people
who've shown me support.

232
00:12:36,366 --> 00:12:39,933
I owe you all a great deal
more than that.

233
00:12:40,033 --> 00:12:41,399
Ikki:
So I swear to you...

234
00:12:41,499 --> 00:12:43,299
the only thing that I can.

235
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:45,633
With all my strength,
I will defeat all of yours!

236
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:47,666
Hangetsu:
The girl who's remained
at the top,

237
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:50,299
versus the boy who
climbed up from the bottom.

238
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,466
Their final battle begins now!

239
00:12:53,566 --> 00:12:55,833
Computer:
(buzzer)
Let's go ahead!

240
00:12:55,933 --> 00:12:57,933
ITTO SHURA!

241
00:12:58,033 --> 00:13:01,566
Kurogane has already opened
the match with his Itto Shura!

242
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,733
That's surprising
to say the least!

243
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:04,766
What's he doing?!

244
00:13:04,866 --> 00:13:05,866
That's so reckless!

245
00:13:05,966 --> 00:13:07,133
Heh.

246
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:07,999
What, Stella?

247
00:13:08,099 --> 00:13:12,033
So Ikki must've... decided
to do that from the beginning.

248
00:13:12,133 --> 00:13:15,999
He won't use any tricks.
If he wants to beat her...

249
00:13:16,099 --> 00:13:18,299
I'll have to take you head on!

250
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:23,433
He'll come at me straight ahead.

251
00:13:23,533 --> 00:13:26,499
If I could avoid him once‐
then I'd win...

252
00:13:27,099 --> 00:13:28,699
Not that way!

253
00:13:31,433 --> 00:13:33,999
I'm only gonna get
one good shot.

254
00:13:34,099 --> 00:13:36,899
So... if one's all I get...

255
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:39,299
I'll give it all my power!

256
00:13:47,433 --> 00:13:49,166
Close‐range is my territory!

257
00:13:49,266 --> 00:13:52,633
The best place for me
to fight is right here!

258
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:57,266
This... is how I show my respect
to the warrior who faces me...

259
00:13:57,366 --> 00:13:59,866
And this... is how
I'll beat her!

260
00:13:59,966 --> 00:14:03,899
I will will face him...
with my unbeaten Raikiri!

261
00:14:03,999 --> 00:14:07,699
It doesn't matter anymore...
if they set us up!

262
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:11,099
I'm not fighting to protect
my status in this school!

263
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,766
Ikki & Toka:
I'm fighting... because I want
to beat this knight...

264
00:14:13,866 --> 00:14:16,366
with all the power
I have inside of me!

265
00:14:16,466 --> 00:14:18,966
The Seventh Secret Sword, Raiko!

266
00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:22,733
Raikiri!

267
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,366
I knew from the beginning...

268
00:14:25,466 --> 00:14:26,966
that she's strong...

269
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,933
and I don't have her power.

270
00:14:29,033 --> 00:14:33,033
So I have to gather it all...
and force it out...

271
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:36,966
I don't need a minute.
All I need is one second!

272
00:14:37,066 --> 00:14:38,899
Sharpen my soul!

273
00:14:38,999 --> 00:14:41,866
Push through...! USE IT ALL!

274
00:15:11,866 --> 00:15:15,699
(panting)

275
00:15:22,033 --> 00:15:24,699
Hangetsu:
GAME OVER!

276
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,233
Todo is down!

277
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,233
One exchange of swords...

278
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,133
one single attack!

279
00:15:30,233 --> 00:15:31,299
One moment later...

280
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:34,633
Todo and her Raikiri
are shattered into pieces!

281
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,833
Let the winner hear you folks!

282
00:15:36,933 --> 00:15:37,933
(roaring cheers)

283
00:15:38,033 --> 00:15:43,333
The Worst One. No!
Another One! Ikki Kurogane!

284
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:48,899
Heh.

285
00:15:52,966 --> 00:15:54,533
Wh‐what' the meaning of this?!

286
00:15:54,633 --> 00:15:57,566
Toka Todo must have been
pulling all of her punches!

287
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:58,333
No, son.

288
00:15:58,433 --> 00:16:04,366
Toka used her power to
its very limit‐

289
00:16:04,466 --> 00:16:06,433
of that I have absolutely
no doubt in my mind! ,/
Nango:
But that amazing boy...

290
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:10,066
he expanded his limit
at the very last moment.

291
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,433
Huh?! He
did what?!

292
00:16:12,533 --> 00:16:15,599
He wasn't going to beat
Raikiri with Itto Shura.

293
00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:18,133
He put it all...
into one stroke...

294
00:16:18,233 --> 00:16:21,933
Every bit of his power in one
swing, rather than one minute.

295
00:16:22,033 --> 00:16:23,166
(seething)

296
00:16:23,266 --> 00:16:26,266
That one has
far more than power.

297
00:16:26,366 --> 00:16:28,533
More than simple technique...

298
00:16:28,633 --> 00:16:31,599
He has... strength
beyond strength.

299
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,999
And the will of a demon...

300
00:16:34,099 --> 00:16:38,666
Well then we should call it...
the "Itto Rasetsu" from now on.

301
00:16:38,766 --> 00:16:40,433
(giggles)

302
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:43,699
The boy is so much...
like his grandfather...

303
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:48,333
I'll never...
allow this... I WILL NOT!

304
00:16:49,366 --> 00:16:51,366
Are you going to do
anything about him?

305
00:16:51,466 --> 00:16:53,366
I think that's about
to get worse...

306
00:16:53,466 --> 00:16:55,599
Whatever he does,
it'll be too late.

307
00:16:55,699 --> 00:16:58,199
Ikki Kurogane just won
all of his arguments

308
00:16:58,299 --> 00:16:59,933
with one stroke
of a sword.

309
00:17:00,033 --> 00:17:04,066
Kurono:
He won't be theirs
to control... not anymore.

310
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:05,766
Not yet...

311
00:17:07,033 --> 00:17:10,133
I... can't pass out yet...

312
00:17:10,233 --> 00:17:13,799
There's something...
I have to tell her...

313
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:17,766
Young man... I will
not allow this!!!

314
00:17:17,866 --> 00:17:19,799
You are a failed knight!

315
00:17:21,933 --> 00:17:23,766
You are not worthy of the name
KuroganeYAAAAAAHHHHH...!

316
00:17:23,866 --> 00:17:26,099
Stella:
Outta my way!
You are not worthy of the name
KuroganeYAAAAAAHHHHH...!

317
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:28,333
Ikki!

318
00:17:39,095 --> 00:17:40,575
Stella...

319
00:17:57,142 --> 00:18:00,909
I'm so proud
of you... Ikki.

320
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:03,509
Thanks.

321
00:18:03,609 --> 00:18:08,709
But... challenging her
head‐on like that in the
condition you're in...?

322
00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:11,009
How stupid are you?

323
00:18:13,042 --> 00:18:14,842
I know, I know.

324
00:18:14,942 --> 00:18:17,575
Sorry to make you
worry... like that.

325
00:18:17,675 --> 00:18:20,409
It's ok.
I'm stupid too.

326
00:18:22,209 --> 00:18:27,309
'Cause... I've fallen in love...
with a total idiot!

327
00:18:33,142 --> 00:18:37,242
Oh... this warmth...

328
00:18:37,342 --> 00:18:42,375
Ikki:
This warmth... it's
what saved me all along...

329
00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:47,442
I have something
I want to say...

330
00:18:47,542 --> 00:18:49,442
Huh?

331
00:18:50,842 --> 00:18:52,309
What?

332
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:56,442
Stella.

333
00:18:59,342 --> 00:19:01,609
I want the two of us
to be a family.

334
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:22,142
Yes! What took you
so long to ask me?!

335
00:19:22,242 --> 00:19:24,342
(thunderous applause)

336
00:19:24,442 --> 00:19:25,842
This is a first!

337
00:19:25,942 --> 00:19:27,909
A marriage proposal
on the field!

338
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:31,042
AND THE PRINCESS SAID YES!

339
00:19:43,675 --> 00:19:44,542
Itsuki:
This is Kurogane.

340
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:48,375
Emperor:
Hello, Mr. Kurogane...
It's been a while.

341
00:19:49,075 --> 00:19:50,809
Emperor of Vermillion?

342
00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:52,509
Emperor:
Look what your son has done.

343
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:56,042
This is obviously big news
in my country as well.

344
00:19:56,142 --> 00:20:01,809
I see. As chief of the
International Federation of
Magical Knights, I apolog‐

345
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,409
Emperor:
There's no need. Kurogane...

346
00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:09,375
let us spare our
children the burden...
of the schemes of adults.

347
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:13,109
Something I imagine any father
would want for his children.

348
00:20:13,209 --> 00:20:16,675
You agree with me,
don't you... Itsuki?

349
00:20:20,109 --> 00:20:24,709
Kagami:
And then, since the
Emperor of Vermillion clearly
expressed his discomfort,

350
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:28,042
the whole scandal disappeared
like yesterday's news!

351
00:20:28,142 --> 00:20:30,309
Oh yeah‐ and...
that Akaza guy

352
00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:32,109
was ousted from the
Ethics Committee!

353
00:20:32,209 --> 00:20:32,975
Kagami:
(laughs)

354
00:20:33,075 --> 00:20:35,142
But you probably know
more about that than I do...

355
00:20:35,242 --> 00:20:37,975
So how's your brother?
Is he feeling better?

356
00:20:38,075 --> 00:20:41,009
Uh‐huh! He's... great!

357
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:46,442
Kurono:
Junior Class, B‐rank,
Kanata Totokubara.

358
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:49,342
Junior Class, C‐rank,
Kikyo Hagure.

359
00:20:49,442 --> 00:20:52,809
Junior Class, D‐rank,
Botan Hagure.

360
00:20:52,909 --> 00:20:56,242
Freshman Class, D‐rank,
Nagi Arisuin.

361
00:20:56,342 --> 00:21:00,042
Freshman Class, A‐rank,
Stella Vermillion.

362
00:21:00,142 --> 00:21:03,609
Freshman Class, F‐rank,
Ikki Kurogane.

363
00:21:03,709 --> 00:21:07,275
I officially announce these six
representatives of Hagun Academy

364
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,909
for the Seven Star
Sword Art Festival!

365
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:12,975
(loud cheers)

366
00:21:13,075 --> 00:21:14,775
And now we appoint
our flag‐bearer.

367
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:19,542
President of the student
council, Toka Todo,
come forward.

368
00:21:19,642 --> 00:21:21,409
Toka:
Yes.

369
00:21:21,509 --> 00:21:22,542
Thank you‐ Director.

370
00:21:22,642 --> 00:21:25,775
I'm very proud to announce
this year's leader...

371
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:28,909
And it's...
Ikki Kurogane!

372
00:21:29,009 --> 00:21:29,709
Huh?

373
00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:31,775
Uh... but, wh‐why me?!

374
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:36,575
I think... anybody here could
probably answer that question!

375
00:21:36,675 --> 00:21:37,842
Yeah, Ikki!

376
00:21:37,942 --> 00:21:39,775
"Another One" RULES!

377
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,409
Kurogane, way to go!

378
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:47,642
(cheers)

379
00:21:47,742 --> 00:21:52,142
Now... please
come here and receive
the school flag, Kurogane.

380
00:21:52,242 --> 00:21:54,375
Ikki:
Oh... Right!

381
00:21:57,642 --> 00:21:58,809
Hey Kurogane...

382
00:21:58,909 --> 00:22:03,275
I am extremely proud...
that I got to battle with you.

383
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:06,442
Miss Toda...
it was only because...

384
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:11,042
you were my opponent... that I
was able to exceed myself.

385
00:22:11,142 --> 00:22:12,509
But winning is a promise.

386
00:22:12,609 --> 00:22:15,575
And every victory
brings responsibility.

387
00:22:15,675 --> 00:22:20,575
You carry with you
the hopes and dreams of
all those you've defeated.

388
00:22:20,675 --> 00:22:27,309
So carry ours, with this flag,
to the top of the Seven Star!

389
00:22:27,409 --> 00:22:28,642
Male Student 1:
Ikki's the man!
I promise.

390
00:22:28,742 --> 00:22:29,742
Male Student 1:
Ikki's the man!

391
00:22:29,842 --> 00:22:32,142
Male Student 2:
Hell yeah, Another One!

392
00:22:32,242 --> 00:22:35,342
(cheers)

393
00:22:35,442 --> 00:22:36,442
Stella.

394
00:22:36,542 --> 00:22:36,942
Yep?

395
00:22:37,042 --> 00:22:42,009
Ikki:
You know, I used to think
I didn't care what people
thought of me,

396
00:22:42,109 --> 00:22:45,309
as long as
I knew my own value.

397
00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:49,642
But being acknowledged by others
now... it feels pretty good.

398
00:22:49,742 --> 00:22:53,842
Yeah! 'Specially when it's by
someone... that you like!

399
00:22:53,942 --> 00:22:55,275
Heh.

400
00:23:00,675 --> 00:23:02,942
(birds chirping)

401
00:23:03,042 --> 00:23:04,842
Ikki:
By the way... Stella?

402
00:23:04,942 --> 00:23:06,309
Stella:
What is it, Ikki?

403
00:23:06,409 --> 00:23:10,975
Ikki:
What I said the other day, about
me wanting us to... be a family?

404
00:23:11,075 --> 00:23:12,509
Alice:
Booties incoming!

405
00:23:12,609 --> 00:23:13,642
Shizuku:
Excuse me.

406
00:23:13,742 --> 00:23:14,842
Sh‐Shizuku?

407
00:23:14,942 --> 00:23:15,475
Alice?

408
00:23:15,575 --> 00:23:18,475
You lovebirds only have two more
years until graduation....

409
00:23:18,575 --> 00:23:21,142
In the meantime, I'm going
to teach you everything
you need to know

410
00:23:21,242 --> 00:23:23,142
about being
a Kurogane bride.

411
00:23:23,242 --> 00:23:26,142
First, you must be no closer
to him than one meter

412
00:23:26,242 --> 00:23:27,042
until you're
married.

413
00:23:27,142 --> 00:23:27,742
Stella:
Hey now? What are
you talking about?

414
00:23:27,842 --> 00:23:29,275
Hey! Let's just
take it easy, guys...
Stella:
Hey now? What are

415
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:30,809
Hey! Let's just
take it easy, guys...

416
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:31,842
You "take it easy!"
You "take it easy!"

417
00:23:31,942 --> 00:23:34,609
Yup, got it...
I'll calm down...
Shizuku:
No kissing, no conversations

418
00:23:34,709 --> 00:23:37,942
no physical contact of any kind,
these are the Kurogane rules!

419
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:39,775
Stella:
You just made that up,
like one second ago!

420
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:42,275
Shizuku:
It doesn't matter when I
made it up. They're rules now.

421
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:45,909
Stella:
Then kissing 30 times a day!
That's a Vermillion rule!
