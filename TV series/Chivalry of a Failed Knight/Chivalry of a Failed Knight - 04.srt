1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,233
Tsukuyomi:
It has finally begun...

2
00:00:03,333 --> 00:00:06,400
The selection match for the
Seven Star Sword Art Festival.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,166
Vermillion's first
opponent is Momotani,

4
00:00:09,266 --> 00:00:11,300
also known as:
"The Heavy Tank"!

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,300
His "Goliath" is a
very rare armor device,

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,533
and with it, he releases
a Heavy Charge.

7
00:00:16,633 --> 00:00:19,000
Will we get to see it
explode today?!

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:19,500
(students cheering)

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,766
Male Student 1:C'mon, Momotani!
(students cheering)

10
00:00:20,866 --> 00:00:22,000
Male Student 2:
No one can beat you in
close‐range combat!

11
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,766
Male Student 2:
No one can beat you in
close‐range combat!
Male Student 3:

12
00:00:23,866 --> 00:00:24,466
Male Student 3:
She lost to an F‐rank!

13
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:25,000
Male Student 4:
Show her the power
of a senior student!

14
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,400
Male Student 4:
Show her the power
of a senior student!
Stella:

15
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,266
Stella:
Unlike all your screaming fans
up there in the stands,

16
00:00:28,366 --> 00:00:30,000
you seem to get the picture.

17
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,900
This is a
real fight...

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,300
These aren't
phantom forms,

19
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,966
so you know if
you jump right in‐

20
00:00:35,066 --> 00:00:36,733
you are gonna
get burned alive.

21
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:39,633
Stella:
Think good and hard before
you make your next move.

22
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:42,166
(panicked breathing)

23
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,600
(armor rattles)

24
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,366
Ha... I... give up!

25
00:00:46,466 --> 00:00:48,900
Female P. A.:
Winner: Stella Vermillion!

26
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,766
(students cheer)

27
00:00:49,866 --> 00:00:51,400
(giggles)

28
00:00:55,733 --> 00:00:59,200
Alice:
An A‐ranked knight really
is so much stronger.

29
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,466
Shizuku:
It's nothing to be
too proud of.

30
00:01:01,566 --> 00:01:04,266
Her opponent was
disappointingly inadequate.

31
00:01:04,366 --> 00:01:06,066
Oh, now‐ honey‐
come on...

32
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,200
Stella:
No, as far as
today's concerned‐

33
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,966
Shizuku
is right.

34
00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:11,400
I heard you both
won your bouts...

35
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,033
Alice:
Yes! Triumph
all around!

36
00:01:14,966 --> 00:01:16,633
You were all totally awesome!

37
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:20,166
Stella:
(screams) Kagami!
Don't scare me like that!

38
00:01:20,266 --> 00:01:21,466
(excited giggle)
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:21,566 --> 00:01:25,800
But I saw three first year
winners all together
and I got excited!

40
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,733
Uh...

41
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:27,933
Who are
you‐ sweetie?

42
00:01:28,033 --> 00:01:30,000
Kagami:
Oh, excuse me!

43
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,066
My name is
Kagami Kusakabe!

44
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:34,833
I'm a member of the
school's newspaper club!

45
00:01:34,933 --> 00:01:37,100
Ooooh! A
journalist!

46
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,700
I'll bet you just get all
the interesting news don't you?

47
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,666
Hmm... Well‐ I am
a serious journalist...

48
00:01:42,766 --> 00:01:45,533
I mean I'm not writing a
gossip column or anything.

49
00:01:45,633 --> 00:01:48,633
But I do hear
all kinds of things...

50
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,966
Well hello‐
my newest friend.

51
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:52,866
Can I call you
"Kagamin"?

52
00:01:52,966 --> 00:01:54,000
Sure!

53
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,900
Alice & Kagami:
(evil snickers)

54
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,233
(video tracking)

55
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,300
(pained cries)

56
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,333
(gasps)

57
00:02:06,366 --> 00:02:07,466
(gasps)

58
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,366
(sighs)

59
00:02:10,466 --> 00:02:11,166
(door opens)

60
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:13,033
Stella:
I'm back, Ikki.

61
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:15,200
Stella...

62
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,900
Congrats!
I saw the results.

63
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,666
Hey‐ it's me‐ you know.
What did you expect?

64
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:22,900
Heh, of course.

65
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,266
Stella:
Have you been watching
this all day?

66
00:02:25,366 --> 00:02:28,433
Ikki:
Yeah. I want to see
what his timing's like.

67
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:30,400
That's
"Area Invisible"?

68
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,933
That's his...
technique‐ huh?

69
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:34,933
Stella:
So he can hide everything‐

70
00:02:35,033 --> 00:02:37,133
sight, scent,
air pressure changes...

71
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:39,066
total imperceptibility?

72
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:42,866
Yeah. A feature of
his device, Oborozuki.

73
00:02:42,966 --> 00:02:44,633
Ikki:
It's a
tricky one.

74
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:47,366
Stella:
Attacking his enemy
from complete concealment.

75
00:02:47,466 --> 00:02:50,566
How slimy. I don't like
the way he fights.

76
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:53,933
(chuckles) Yeah, but if
you were his opponent,

77
00:02:54,033 --> 00:02:55,600
he'd withdraw
from the battle.

78
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,400
What?

79
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,533
Ikki:
With your array
of wide‐ranging attacks,

80
00:02:58,633 --> 00:03:01,700
you could easily overturn
his Area Invisible.

81
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,500
He'll uh... always try to
avoid an opponent like that.

82
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
Seriously...?

83
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,400
Ikki:
His un‐knightly approach
has earned him a nickname:

84
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,400
"The Hunter."

85
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,500
Stella:
Where I come from‐
they call that "a coward."

86
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,766
But... he's gonna be
a tough one for you.

87
00:03:17,866 --> 00:03:18,500
Hmm.

88
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,000
He's the worst possible
match‐up for me...

89
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,266
Are you gonna
be... Okay?

90
00:03:24,366 --> 00:03:26,833
Are you worried
about me, Stella?

91
00:03:26,933 --> 00:03:28,966
What? I'm...
not at all!

92
00:03:29,066 --> 00:03:32,166
I just don't want you to
lose to a guy like that!

93
00:03:33,433 --> 00:03:34,033
I see.

94
00:03:34,133 --> 00:03:35,333
I... what
do you...?

95
00:03:35,433 --> 00:03:38,100
Don't worry. I think
I've got a way.

96
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,100
I will...
defeat him.

97
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,733
Oh... you will,
I know!

98
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,033
Stella:
You've got this.

99
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:46,366
Ikki:
Yeah.

100
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:50,766
(panting)

101
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:56,066
I canNOT lose to him...

102
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,266
Well‐ hello...
stranger...

103
00:03:59,366 --> 00:04:00,800
Alice...

104
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,100
Can we talk?
You got a sec?

105
00:04:03,633 --> 00:04:05,233
Sure. What's up?

106
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,200
Alice:
I heard a rumor that
there was some bloodshed

107
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,600
between you and
Shizuya Kirihara last year.

108
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,033
That true?

109
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,600
(sighs)

110
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,533
Ikki:
Last year, my family
had connections

111
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:19,433
with the previous
director of the school,

112
00:04:19,533 --> 00:04:22,433
and they were trying
to get me kicked out.

113
00:04:22,533 --> 00:04:25,633
So Kirihara thought
I was a good target.

114
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:29,000
Kirihara:
Hey, is it true that
you can't attend classes

115
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,133
because your
scores are too low?

116
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:32,200
Yeah it's true.

117
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,500
Hey... I know....

118
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,200
You want your teachers to
recognize your ability?

119
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,866
Why don't you show 'em
how you stand up in a duel
with a real talent?

120
00:04:42,966 --> 00:04:45,133
Right here
and right now.

121
00:04:45,233 --> 00:04:47,866
No thanks. I'm not
dueling with you.

122
00:04:47,966 --> 00:04:50,133
(chuckles)
C'mon now man!

123
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:53,066
I'm only trying to
help out a fellow student!

124
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:53,766
(arrow fires)

125
00:04:53,866 --> 00:04:55,366
AHH!

126
00:04:55,466 --> 00:04:57,100
That looked like it really hurt!

127
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,800
(teasing laugh)
Why don't you fight back?!

128
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,433
Ngh.

129
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:02,500
Oh, you better
make your move, dude,

130
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,333
because no one in this
school is gonna give a shit

131
00:05:04,433 --> 00:05:06,833
about helping out
The Worst One!

132
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:10,300
Ikki:
I knew if I summoned my device,
I'd have gotten expelled...

133
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,666
even if I only used it to try
and avoid the fight...

134
00:05:13,766 --> 00:05:16,666
So you couldn't
even defend yourself?

135
00:05:16,766 --> 00:05:17,900
Ikki:
Mm‐mm.

136
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,566
It's the only reason
I'm still here.

137
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,966
Alice:
Ikki... if things
hadn't changed...

138
00:05:23,066 --> 00:05:26,766
if you were still being
barred from classes
and official events...

139
00:05:26,866 --> 00:05:29,600
what would
you have done?

140
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,566
Ikki:
I'd still be here.

141
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:34,766
I will demonstrate
my strength. I will...

142
00:05:36,133 --> 00:05:38,400
No matter how many years
it takes me.

143
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,433
Alice:
I get you.
I really do.

144
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:47,266
Ikki...?

145
00:05:47,366 --> 00:05:49,766
I think you've been hurt
you so many times...

146
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:51,866
you're used to it.

147
00:05:51,966 --> 00:05:55,333
Alice:
Strength is nothing but
tolerance, sweetie.

148
00:05:55,433 --> 00:05:59,233
Just resistance
to accumulated stress.

149
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,300
Our brain has funny ways
of showing us

150
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,033
when we're about to
reach our limit.

151
00:06:04,133 --> 00:06:07,000
Anger, sadness,
irritation...

152
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,333
They're all just
smoke signals.

153
00:06:11,066 --> 00:06:13,000
But honey, you...

154
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,733
You've already tolerated
so very much...

155
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,800
You can't even
read the signs anymore...

156
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,166
That's why...

157
00:06:20,266 --> 00:06:24,366
Your face is always such
a mask of perfect serenity.

158
00:06:24,466 --> 00:06:27,466
Sorry Alice,
I don't get it...

159
00:06:27,966 --> 00:06:29,500
Yeah...

160
00:06:30,566 --> 00:06:33,200
Alice:
Ikki‐ my greatest
hope for you...

161
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,066
is that someone's gonna come
along who can read those signs.

162
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:41,000
As your friend...
I think you've earned that.

163
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:46,133
Stella:
You still have a little time
until your standby hour.

164
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:47,333
Do you wanna...

165
00:06:47,433 --> 00:06:49,300
maybe watch some
of the other battles?

166
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,433
No thanks. I think I'm
going to the waiting room.

167
00:06:52,533 --> 00:06:54,833
I want to concentrate
on my fight.

168
00:06:54,933 --> 00:06:56,933
Oh uh...
Big Brother?

169
00:06:57,033 --> 00:06:59,000
Your shoelace...

170
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,500
Oh, thank you,
Shizuku!

171
00:07:02,366 --> 00:07:04,366
Be careful out there.

172
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:08,900
Computer:
This selection match is
full contact and may cause
injury or death.

173
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,900
If you understand this
and wish to continue,
please press "Agree."

174
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,533
Nene:
(giggles) Wow, you didn't even
have to think about it, did you?

175
00:07:18,633 --> 00:07:22,333
Up through junior high school‐
all matches are conducted in
phantom form;

176
00:07:22,433 --> 00:07:25,366
so many students seriously
hesitate at this point.

177
00:07:25,466 --> 00:07:28,100
I've been waiting to fight
an official match...

178
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,633
I won't hesitate.

179
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:32,500
Oooh, very cool‐
I'm impressed!

180
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,400
You're Nene Saikyo,
aren't you?

181
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,700
Nene:
Oh yeah? So you know
my name‐ do you?

182
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,433
Ikki:
The Demon Princess
of the KOK Top League?

183
00:07:40,533 --> 00:07:42,900
There's no one in this school
who doesn't know you.

184
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,466
Well, I suppose.

185
00:07:44,566 --> 00:07:47,266
I also heard that you and
the Director are old friends,

186
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:50,766
and that you'll be working as a
part‐time instructor this year.

187
00:07:50,866 --> 00:07:53,033
Yes, yes, that is correct.

188
00:07:53,133 --> 00:07:55,166
So, what do you say?

189
00:07:56,866 --> 00:07:57,433
How about...

190
00:07:57,533 --> 00:08:01,433
if maybe tonight I give you
a very special private lesson?

191
00:08:01,533 --> 00:08:02,433
Uh... I don't...

192
00:08:02,533 --> 00:08:05,600
Kurono:
Dammit. Would you get away
from my student please?

193
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,633
Ahh! You startled me!

194
00:08:07,733 --> 00:08:10,966
Don't do that, Ku‐chan. I could
very easily have killed you.

195
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:13,300
Not even on your
best day‐ sweetheart.

196
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,533
Moving on... our third
match seems to have
lost its supervisor.

197
00:08:16,633 --> 00:08:20,500
(nervous laughter)
Well‐ it was a terribly
boring fight‐

198
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,666
so I just decided...

199
00:08:21,766 --> 00:08:21,833
(whack)

200
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:25,300
Kurono:
Get back to your post,
you walking public indecency!

201
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,700
Okay, okay, I'll go ‐
stop pulling my hair!

202
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:43,200
Thirty more minutes left...
gotta concentrate...

203
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:50,366
Ikki:
I finally made it here...

204
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:55,233
...to my first official match.

205
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,200
I fought for it...

206
00:09:01,266 --> 00:09:04,766
...and now I get my chance.

207
00:09:04,866 --> 00:09:08,033
I cannot... will not lose.

208
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,833
(gasp)

209
00:09:09,933 --> 00:09:11,800
Wh‐what is...this?

210
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,400
Distorted PA:
Ikki Kurogane to
the battlefield please.

211
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,433
Ikki Kurogane to the
battlefield.

212
00:09:19,366 --> 00:09:22,333
(sighs)
Here we go...

213
00:09:23,233 --> 00:09:25,000
(cheers and applause)

214
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,266
Hangetsu:
Look at this!

215
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:29,033
The biggest field in the school,
the Great Arena,

216
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:33,233
is utterly packed
with eager spectators!

217
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:36,300
This is Hangetsu Tsukuyomi...
on play‐by‐play,

218
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,800
and here with me...
instructor and commentator
Nene Saikyo!

219
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,600
Great to
be here...

220
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,633
Hangetsu:
You'll be glad you
didn't miss this match!

221
00:09:44,733 --> 00:09:45,533
Our first combatant,

222
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:48,900
already a veteran of the Seven
Star Sword Art Festival...

223
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,966
C‐rank knight, Shizuya Kirihara!

224
00:09:52,066 --> 00:09:53,300
Female Student 1:
Shizuya!

225
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,700
Female Student 2:
He's so cool!

226
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,566
Our other contestant,

227
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:59,033
an F‐rank knight who recently
defeated Stella Vermillion

228
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:02,933
in a mock battle...
Ikki Kurogane!

229
00:10:03,033 --> 00:10:05,466
Kirihara:
I can't believe
you actually showed up.

230
00:10:05,566 --> 00:10:09,133
I guess I get to
beat you up like a
rag doll, right Worst One?

231
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,100
You can try... Shizuya.

232
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,633
(chuckles) It's time to
go hunting. Oborozuki!

233
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,100
Heh, heh.

234
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,333
Come to me, Intetsu.

235
00:10:26,066 --> 00:10:26,366
(buzzer)

236
00:10:26,466 --> 00:10:28,500
Computer:
Let's go ahead!

237
00:10:36,446 --> 00:10:38,846
Whoa, that's such
a hard stare!

238
00:10:38,946 --> 00:10:42,513
I don't think I like the way
you're lookin' at me, Kurogane.

239
00:10:42,613 --> 00:10:45,446
The battle has already
started... Kirihara.

240
00:10:45,546 --> 00:10:49,213
(chuckles) Jeez man‐
you are so uptight!

241
00:10:49,313 --> 00:10:50,979
But if you're in such a hurry...

242
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:55,013
(synthesizers play)

243
00:10:56,446 --> 00:10:58,613
Hangetsu:
There it is!
Area Invisible!

244
00:10:58,713 --> 00:11:02,179
Kirihara has
disappeared from view!

245
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:04,213
It really is a
tricky ability, but...

246
00:11:04,313 --> 00:11:06,646
there's a way
to beat this!

247
00:11:06,746 --> 00:11:09,579
Hangetsu:
And Kurogane
deftly deflects!

248
00:11:10,913 --> 00:11:11,846
There you are!

249
00:11:11,946 --> 00:11:12,879
Ugh.

250
00:11:12,979 --> 00:11:15,946
Did we... Did we just
get a glimpse? Amazing!

251
00:11:16,046 --> 00:11:20,046
Hangetsu:
Did Kurogane somehow
find Kirihara?

252
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:23,213
Nene:
That's right. Kirihara's
Area Invisible...

253
00:11:23,313 --> 00:11:24,846
doesn't extend to
his arrows.

254
00:11:24,946 --> 00:11:27,279
Kurogane calculated
his location...

255
00:11:27,379 --> 00:11:29,746
by tracing their
point of origin..

256
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:32,679
Well my goodness.

257
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:36,313
Is it possible you actually
intend to win this battle?

258
00:11:36,413 --> 00:11:38,379
I wouldn't be here...
if I didn't.

259
00:11:38,479 --> 00:11:43,779
Kirihara:
(laughs) You haven't even
changed a little bit, have you?

260
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:46,946
It's cute... but
it's really annoying.

261
00:11:47,046 --> 00:11:48,179
Just keep shooting.

262
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:49,713
Let your arrows fly.

263
00:11:49,813 --> 00:11:52,013
I'll knock 'em all
away, "Hunter."

264
00:11:52,113 --> 00:11:56,346
Hmph. The Worst One's got a
mouth on him‐ doesn't he?

265
00:11:57,813 --> 00:12:00,279
Kirihara:
Tell ya what: From now on‐

266
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:03,246
I'll tell you where
I'm shooting you.

267
00:12:03,346 --> 00:12:04,979
First, your right thigh.

268
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:06,846
AHHH!

269
00:12:06,946 --> 00:12:07,179
(pained panting)

270
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,879
(pained panting)
Next, your left arm.

271
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:09,846
Ugh!

272
00:12:09,946 --> 00:12:11,062
H‐how...?

273
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:11,842
(laughs)

274
00:12:11,942 --> 00:12:15,797
Kirihara:
Well, well. I'll bet The Worst
One feels pretty stupid
right now‐ doesn't he?

275
00:12:15,897 --> 00:12:18,097
I'll bet you thought
I couldn't get any better!

276
00:12:19,832 --> 00:12:23,354
My Area Invisible can
make the arrows I shoot
invisible too, now!

277
00:12:23,454 --> 00:12:25,488
That means you won't see
them till they hit you!

278
00:12:25,588 --> 00:12:27,488
You got that,
dumbass?!

279
00:12:27,588 --> 00:12:28,954
Left hand, coming up!

280
00:12:29,054 --> 00:12:31,921
Ahh!

281
00:12:32,021 --> 00:12:33,054
Look at that!

282
00:12:33,154 --> 00:12:36,321
Hangetsu:
Kirihara shows us some
devastating new tricks!

283
00:12:36,421 --> 00:12:37,354
This is bad...

284
00:12:37,454 --> 00:12:38,354
It is...

285
00:12:38,454 --> 00:12:40,088
Big Brother's
strategy...

286
00:12:40,188 --> 00:12:41,421
has been foiled
completely.

287
00:12:41,521 --> 00:12:44,021
Kirihara:
Left thigh‐ order up!

288
00:12:44,121 --> 00:12:46,821
Why didn't he make a move
right at the beginning?

289
00:12:46,921 --> 00:12:47,421
Huh?

290
00:12:47,521 --> 00:12:49,854
Stella:
He knew his enemy was
going to disappear.

291
00:12:49,954 --> 00:12:52,154
He could've ended this fight
before it even started!

292
00:12:52,254 --> 00:12:56,588
Shizuku:
But... his technique requires
that he study his opponent...

293
00:12:56,688 --> 00:12:58,654
All he's doing
is wasting himself...

294
00:12:58,754 --> 00:13:00,954
fending off
invisible attacks.

295
00:13:01,054 --> 00:13:01,988
Huh?

296
00:13:02,088 --> 00:13:05,388
Stella:
It should've been an easy
decision for him.

297
00:13:05,488 --> 00:13:07,654
It's not that
he didn't do it...

298
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:09,554
It's that
he couldn't.

299
00:13:09,654 --> 00:13:09,821
Huh?

300
00:13:09,921 --> 00:13:12,588
It should've been
an easy decision for him,

301
00:13:12,688 --> 00:13:15,054
But he's nervous
as hell...

302
00:13:15,154 --> 00:13:16,288
What do you mean?

303
00:13:16,388 --> 00:13:17,488
That's ridiculous!

304
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,688
He wasn't nervous at all...

305
00:13:18,788 --> 00:13:20,088
Ikki:
Don't worry...

306
00:13:20,188 --> 00:13:21,021
Ah!

307
00:13:21,121 --> 00:13:23,354
I will... defeat him.

308
00:13:23,454 --> 00:13:24,488
Ikki...

309
00:13:24,588 --> 00:13:25,688
he was so sure‐

310
00:13:25,788 --> 00:13:28,354
it did seem
extremely unlike him...

311
00:13:28,454 --> 00:13:31,321
Alice:
Honey‐ when you think about
everything he went through

312
00:13:31,421 --> 00:13:32,821
just to get this chance...

313
00:13:32,921 --> 00:13:36,421
can you imagine any world
in which he wasn't terrified?

314
00:13:36,521 --> 00:13:39,221
Even if he was
acting normal...

315
00:13:39,321 --> 00:13:41,321
it was just
a mask.

316
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:44,488
Oh my God. There's no way he
wasn't nervous.

317
00:13:44,588 --> 00:13:48,354
False confidence...
just a smoke signal‐ darling.

318
00:13:48,454 --> 00:13:52,654
Why couldn't I see it? I was
the closest person to him...

319
00:13:52,754 --> 00:13:54,721
Kirihara:
Get it together, Worst One.

320
00:13:54,821 --> 00:13:57,488
Your graduation is
on the line, isn't it?

321
00:13:57,588 --> 00:13:59,788
The new director didn't do you
any favors...

322
00:13:59,888 --> 00:14:02,354
with your special
graduation requirement...

323
00:14:02,454 --> 00:14:03,821
Huh? What is he
talking about?

324
00:14:03,921 --> 00:14:06,321
Only he has a requirement
for graduation?

325
00:14:06,421 --> 00:14:07,921
Kirihara:
Left elbow next!

326
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:10,321
Winning at the Seven Star
is the only way

327
00:14:10,421 --> 00:14:12,788
you're gonna be able to
graduate, isn't it?!

328
00:14:12,888 --> 00:14:15,054
He thinks he can win
at Seven Star?

329
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:15,854
He's out of his mind!

330
00:14:15,954 --> 00:14:18,254
He's Rank F, isn't he?
Is he serious?

331
00:14:18,354 --> 00:14:20,554
(laughter)

332
00:14:20,654 --> 00:14:23,454
Oh no, they're
all laughing at you.

333
00:14:23,554 --> 00:14:25,288
Aren't you mortified?

334
00:14:25,388 --> 00:14:28,021
Hey, why don't you declare
right here in front of everyone

335
00:14:28,121 --> 00:14:30,354
that you're gonna win
at the Seven Star?

336
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:31,754
Hah! He's miserable.

337
00:14:31,854 --> 00:14:34,554
A Rank F talking
about winning? Impossible.

338
00:14:34,654 --> 00:14:37,721
Just because he beat Rank A
by sheer dumb luck.

339
00:14:37,821 --> 00:14:40,154
Male Student 1:
There's a rumor that
the match was fixed.

340
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,654
Male Student 2:
Once a Rank F‐
always a Rank F.

341
00:14:42,754 --> 00:14:45,588
All these people who don't
know what real courage is...

342
00:14:45,688 --> 00:14:47,054
and they're making
fun of him...

343
00:14:47,154 --> 00:14:50,388
Kirihara:
Lets try something vital
this time...

344
00:14:50,488 --> 00:14:51,554
(arrow impacts)

345
00:14:51,654 --> 00:14:54,554
Kirihara:
(cackles)

346
00:14:54,654 --> 00:14:57,588
Everyone. Kurogane
is discouraged‐

347
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,488
so let's cheer him up!

348
00:14:59,588 --> 00:15:02,154
For the Worst One‐
let's hear it!

349
00:15:02,254 --> 00:15:03,988
For the Worst One!

350
00:15:04,088 --> 00:15:05,221
The Worst One!

351
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,788
Students:
The Worst One!

352
00:15:06,888 --> 00:15:08,354
Kirihara:
The Worst One!

353
00:15:08,454 --> 00:15:09,354
Students:
The Worst One!

354
00:15:09,454 --> 00:15:10,421
Kirihara:
Come on!

355
00:15:10,521 --> 00:15:11,054
Students:
The Worst One!

356
00:15:11,154 --> 00:15:11,588
Kirihara:
Come on!

357
00:15:11,688 --> 00:15:13,088
Students:
The Worst One!

358
00:15:13,188 --> 00:15:14,854
SHUT UP!

359
00:15:14,954 --> 00:15:19,488
Stella:
He's better than all of you...
you stupid bastards!

360
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:24,854
Ikki! Don't you ever
look like that!

361
00:15:24,954 --> 00:15:27,588
Don't you ever
let me see you giving up!

362
00:15:27,688 --> 00:15:32,021
I like you better when you're...
when you're looking up!

363
00:15:32,121 --> 00:15:33,721
Show me your strength!

364
00:15:33,821 --> 00:15:39,021
You better show me your strength
at all times‐ you dumbass!

365
00:15:45,054 --> 00:15:46,588
(sighs)

366
00:15:51,354 --> 00:15:53,154
Thank you, Stella.

367
00:15:53,254 --> 00:15:54,321
Just what I needed.

368
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:55,588
(cackles)

369
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:58,621
Being scolded by a girl
pepped you up huh?

370
00:15:58,721 --> 00:16:01,654
Stop being arrogant,
Ikki Kurogane.

371
00:16:01,754 --> 00:16:04,654
You've been fixated
on seeing his arrows...

372
00:16:04,754 --> 00:16:08,588
Well I guess... I'll aim
for your broken little
brain this time.

373
00:16:08,688 --> 00:16:10,621
And then
you'll be dead!

374
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:12,488
There was only
one way...

375
00:16:12,588 --> 00:16:14,121
one way from
the beginning...

376
00:16:14,221 --> 00:16:15,488
Alright... Itto Shura!

377
00:16:15,588 --> 00:16:17,954
Let's see you
avoid this, loser!

378
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:22,054
Remember... the
sequence of his shots...

379
00:16:22,154 --> 00:16:22,654
the timing...

380
00:16:22,754 --> 00:16:25,121
Here it comes!
(cackles)

381
00:16:25,221 --> 00:16:27,627
The depths, the angles...

382
00:16:27,627 --> 00:16:28,739
Kirihara:
I'm gonna gitchya!

383
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:30,739
Kirihara:
I'm gonna gitchya!
Remember his taunts...
their proximity...

384
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:31,106
Remember his taunts...
their proximity...

385
00:16:31,206 --> 00:16:32,339
Time for you to die!
Remember his taunts...
their proximity...

386
00:16:32,439 --> 00:16:34,006
Time for you to die!

387
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:41,773
Huh?!

388
00:16:43,065 --> 00:16:44,089
That's what I thought.

389
00:16:44,189 --> 00:16:47,556
Now I know... where you're
coming from‐ Kirihara.

390
00:16:47,656 --> 00:16:51,089
Huh? No way!
You can see it?!

391
00:16:51,189 --> 00:16:55,256
I can't see your shape
or shadow... But I know.

392
00:16:55,356 --> 00:16:57,323
Kirihara:
That is impossible!

393
00:16:59,423 --> 00:17:00,456
Ahh!

394
00:17:00,556 --> 00:17:01,823
Your rhythm...

395
00:17:01,923 --> 00:17:03,723
your level of
emotion...

396
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:06,089
Even the depth of
pain you inflict...

397
00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:08,456
They're giving me
everything I need....

398
00:17:08,556 --> 00:17:10,456
I can trace them all back...

399
00:17:10,556 --> 00:17:12,023
to... their source...

400
00:17:12,123 --> 00:17:14,956
That's where I
find you... hiding!

401
00:17:16,223 --> 00:17:17,189
I see you...

402
00:17:17,289 --> 00:17:19,356
You can't hide from
me anymore!

403
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:21,723
(laughter)
Look at that!

404
00:17:21,823 --> 00:17:24,123
This kid really is
full of surprises!

405
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,856
But how... how did he
do it‐ Miss Saikyo?

406
00:17:26,956 --> 00:17:30,423
How was Kurogane
able to find Kirihara?

407
00:17:30,523 --> 00:17:31,789
With his "Blade Steal."

408
00:17:31,889 --> 00:17:34,889
Nene:
Kurogane can use it
to observe, adopt,

409
00:17:34,989 --> 00:17:37,189
and even perfect his
opponent's technique...

410
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:40,689
He just used an advanced version
of it to read, anticipate

411
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:43,756
and pre‐empt Kirihara's
very thoughts.

412
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:45,489
That version's called...

413
00:17:45,589 --> 00:17:47,623
"Perfect Vision"...

414
00:17:47,723 --> 00:17:48,956
I can see
everything.

415
00:17:49,056 --> 00:17:51,623
Kirihara:
HE'S CHEATING!

416
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:56,256
Are you ready,
Kirihara...?

417
00:17:56,356 --> 00:17:58,223
With all of my
strength...

418
00:17:58,323 --> 00:17:59,689
I will defeat
all of yours!

419
00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:02,889
Kirihara:
(frantic screams)

420
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:06,989
Million Rain!

421
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:12,489
Wait, wait! Stop!

422
00:18:12,589 --> 00:18:14,123
Stop it!

423
00:18:14,223 --> 00:18:15,356
Stop it, please!

424
00:18:15,456 --> 00:18:16,389
Don't!

425
00:18:19,756 --> 00:18:23,123
I know, let's play rock,
paper, scissors!

426
00:18:25,456 --> 00:18:27,889
Kirihara:
Can we just be friends?!

427
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:30,756
That sword could
kill me! Come on!

428
00:18:30,856 --> 00:18:33,423
WE'RE FRIENDS! Come on man
I'm begging you!

429
00:18:33,523 --> 00:18:34,523
CONCEDE!

430
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,623
I concede!

431
00:18:35,723 --> 00:18:38,756
I GIVE UUUUUUUUP!

432
00:18:41,656 --> 00:18:46,089
Aaah...

433
00:18:46,189 --> 00:18:48,856
Guess I was one
millimeter off.

434
00:18:48,956 --> 00:18:50,856
Gotta work
on that.

435
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:54,556
Shizuya Kirihara
has conceded the match.

436
00:18:54,656 --> 00:18:56,056
The winner is
Ikki Kurogane!

437
00:18:56,156 --> 00:18:57,423
Ikki Kurogane!

438
00:18:57,523 --> 00:19:01,356
Hangetsu:
An F‐Rank knight who
couldn't even take classes
last year steps up!

439
00:19:01,456 --> 00:19:05,289
His very first official match‐
a stunning victory!

440
00:19:05,389 --> 00:19:06,256
He did it!

441
00:19:06,356 --> 00:19:07,823
(sighs)
Big Brother...

442
00:19:07,923 --> 00:19:12,056
Students:
(stunned chatter)

443
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,423
Huh? Oh!

444
00:19:18,523 --> 00:19:18,789
Stella:
Ikki!

445
00:19:18,889 --> 00:19:20,923
Hangetsu:
Medical! Medical
to the field please!

446
00:19:21,023 --> 00:19:23,323
We have to get Kurogane
to an IPS capsule!

447
00:19:23,423 --> 00:19:28,989
(chuckles) Somehow I
just knew I couldn't miss
this year's selection matches.

448
00:19:39,089 --> 00:19:40,323
Uhh...

449
00:19:40,423 --> 00:19:41,656
Hm?

450
00:19:42,356 --> 00:19:45,189
Stella:
(snoring)

451
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:46,623
Heh.

452
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,689
Hiya, sweetheart.
Aren't you gonna go in?

453
00:19:53,423 --> 00:19:54,789
(sighs)

454
00:19:55,323 --> 00:19:56,623
Huh?

455
00:19:58,756 --> 00:20:00,689
We can stay here
for a little while...

456
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:02,489
I've got
you now...

457
00:20:02,589 --> 00:20:06,223
(whimpers)

458
00:20:07,223 --> 00:20:08,256
Stella:
Noooo!

459
00:20:08,356 --> 00:20:11,156
I can't believe you kept
looking at me while I drooled!

460
00:20:11,256 --> 00:20:12,256
You... ASS!

461
00:20:12,356 --> 00:20:12,823
Oh! I'll just bet it was real
funny wasn't it, you piece of...

462
00:20:12,923 --> 00:20:15,156
Whoa, Stella, take it easy!
Oh! I'll just bet it was real
funny wasn't it, you piece of...

463
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:15,523
How could you?!

464
00:20:15,623 --> 00:20:18,389
How could you let that little
prick beat up on you like that?!

465
00:20:18,489 --> 00:20:19,589
I'm really sorry...

466
00:20:19,689 --> 00:20:21,656
I keep embarrassing
myself...

467
00:20:21,756 --> 00:20:23,523
Sorry to
make you worry.

468
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:26,389
I‐I wasn't worried
about you‐ you dumbass!

469
00:20:29,256 --> 00:20:30,323
Stella.

470
00:20:30,423 --> 00:20:31,723
Huh?

471
00:20:32,623 --> 00:20:35,356
I really...
I really like you...

472
00:20:35,456 --> 00:20:36,889
Huh?!

473
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:43,223
I'm very lucky...
to have met you...

474
00:20:43,323 --> 00:20:44,556
I‐ what the
hell are you‐

475
00:20:44,656 --> 00:20:46,156
what are you
talking about?

476
00:20:46,256 --> 00:20:48,623
Uh... When I said
that I liked you before...

477
00:20:48,723 --> 00:20:52,956
...what I meant was your way of
life and your aspiration,
that kind of stuff.

478
00:20:53,056 --> 00:20:54,323
Yeah I know...

479
00:20:54,423 --> 00:20:58,323
But I... I just wanted
to tell you the whole truth.

480
00:20:59,323 --> 00:21:00,056
No fair.

481
00:21:00,156 --> 00:21:00,723
What?

482
00:21:00,823 --> 00:21:04,423
It's no fair‐ you being all
honest and everything...

483
00:21:04,523 --> 00:21:05,423
Now close your eyes!

484
00:21:05,523 --> 00:21:07,823
Uh, are you...
gonna hit me?

485
00:21:07,923 --> 00:21:09,689
Just shut up and
close your damn eyes!

486
00:21:09,789 --> 00:21:13,823
I... I... whatever
you say....

487
00:21:24,989 --> 00:21:27,289
D‐Don't you misunderstand me.

488
00:21:27,389 --> 00:21:31,923
I did that cuz... well,
I did it because I... wanted to.

489
00:21:32,023 --> 00:21:36,323
Does that mean...
that you... like me back?

490
00:21:36,423 --> 00:21:37,623
Mm‐hmm.

491
00:21:38,356 --> 00:21:39,789
Whoa!

492
00:21:41,289 --> 00:21:42,323
Hmm.

493
00:21:44,523 --> 00:21:46,656
I'm gonna let you get
away with that...

494
00:21:46,756 --> 00:21:49,389
because you're injured.

495
00:21:49,489 --> 00:21:51,323
Ikki:
Stella...

496
00:21:51,423 --> 00:21:52,756
When you're
with me...

497
00:21:52,856 --> 00:21:55,256
I feel like I could
do anything...

498
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,223
Stay with me.

499
00:21:57,323 --> 00:22:01,156
We'll make each other the
best of knights. And then...

500
00:22:01,256 --> 00:22:04,456
In the final battle
for the top position...

501
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:06,723
It'll just be
you and me.

502
00:22:06,823 --> 00:22:08,189
Careful with that wish...

503
00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:11,689
because I am not going
to lose to you again.

504
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:13,756
Stella & Ikki:
It's a promise.
