1
00:00:02,666 --> 00:00:05,766
Shizuku:
It took too long for me
to really see it...

2
00:00:05,866 --> 00:00:07,900
the cruelty that we
can hide away...

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,333
behind a mask
of peace.

4
00:00:10,433 --> 00:00:12,966
And how this person
that I love...

5
00:00:13,066 --> 00:00:15,433
how he'd been forced
to suffer.

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,733
Father, mother,
the whole family...

7
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,866
none of them
ever loved him.

8
00:00:21,966 --> 00:00:23,166
They hurt him.

9
00:00:23,266 --> 00:00:26,466
And now they only want
to hurt him even more.

10
00:00:26,566 --> 00:00:30,033
But if that's what they
want, then I...

11
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:36,500
(panting)

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,600
(drinking water)

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,700
Good run‐
Miss Stella.

14
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,400
(panting)

15
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:44,900
Just Stella!

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,633
(panting)

17
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:47,933
Oh...

18
00:00:48,033 --> 00:00:50,866
Yeah right...
just Stella...

19
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:51,400
We done?

20
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,133
I usually run about
20 kilometers every day...

21
00:00:55,233 --> 00:00:57,033
You know‐ you don't
really have to‐

22
00:00:57,133 --> 00:00:58,666
I'm fine‐
this is nothing.

23
00:00:58,766 --> 00:00:59,500
And besides...

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,866
you have very powerful magic
that can compensate
for a lack of‐

25
00:01:02,966 --> 00:01:06,333
LACK OF WHAT?!
Did I or did I not finish?

26
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:06,800
(winded sigh)

27
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,966
Man, you've got a competitive
streak don'tcha...?

28
00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:10,966
Here.

29
00:01:11,066 --> 00:01:13,300
Uh... what are you...?

30
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,866
Uh... you need
your electrolytes...

31
00:01:15,966 --> 00:01:17,833
You drank from...

32
00:01:17,933 --> 00:01:19,033
It'd be like
kissing you...

33
00:01:19,133 --> 00:01:19,833
Oh‐ right!

34
00:01:19,933 --> 00:01:22,800
You don't wanna drink out of
that‐ it's got my germs on it!

35
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,433
Sorry.

36
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:26,666
What? When did I
say anything about germs.

37
00:01:26,766 --> 00:01:27,966
Maybe I want those germs...

38
00:01:28,066 --> 00:01:28,866
What?

39
00:01:28,966 --> 00:01:32,233
WHAT? NEVER MIND!
I need my electrolytes!

40
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:35,400
(water sloshing in bottle)
(drinking)

41
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:38,533
Huh?

42
00:01:38,633 --> 00:01:39,600
Look how happy you are!

43
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,066
Yeah, my sister starts
school here today...

44
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:44,866
four years since
I've seen her...

45
00:01:44,966 --> 00:01:46,533
Oh!

46
00:01:46,633 --> 00:01:48,033
So she's your sister?

47
00:01:48,133 --> 00:01:49,866
That's like a real
sister‐ right?‐

48
00:01:49,966 --> 00:01:51,433
not like a friend
you call "sister..."?

49
00:01:51,533 --> 00:01:54,966
Yup. As in "daughter
of my mother and father."

50
00:01:55,066 --> 00:01:56,766
I'll allow it.

51
00:01:56,866 --> 00:02:00,266
Ikki:
Okay, well...
thank you...?

52
00:03:36,029 --> 00:03:38,500
Helloooooo freshmen!
Welcome to you all!

53
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,267
I'm your teacher,
Yuri Oriki!

54
00:03:41,367 --> 00:03:44,500
I'm new too‐ you guys
are my very first class‐

55
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,433
so you can all just
call me Miss Yuri.

56
00:03:47,533 --> 00:03:48,367
Now we won't have class today,

57
00:03:48,467 --> 00:03:50,733
She looks like she
hasn't slept in a year.
but I do have one thing to add
about the selection match

58
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:51,600
(laughs) I know,
but she's a good teacher.
but I do have one thing to add
about the selection match

59
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,667
(laughs) I know,
but she's a good teacher.
for the Seven Star
Sword Art Festival.

60
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:57,567
Of course, I'm sure all of you
remember very well

61
00:03:57,667 --> 00:03:59,567
what the Director said
during assembly...

62
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:04,000
Kurono:
Traditionally‐ Hagun Academy's
representatives have been chosen
based on score.

63
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,600
this year, students will face
one another in battle

64
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,733
to determine our top six.

65
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,567
Our team of representatives....

66
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,733
will be composed
of these six students.

67
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:15,433
Kurono:
This year's selections...
will be simple and fair.

68
00:04:15,533 --> 00:04:19,233
Yuri:
So‐ I'm sure I don't have to
remind you that the school match

69
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,600
will start next week!

70
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,233
You'll be informed of your
fight schedule and opponent

71
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,167
by emails to your student ID.

72
00:04:25,267 --> 00:04:26,133
Professor...?

73
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:30,567
No, no! Call me Miss Yuri,
or I won't answer your question!

74
00:04:30,667 --> 00:04:31,733
Stella:
Uh...

75
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,367
M‐Miss Yuri...?

76
00:04:33,467 --> 00:04:35,800
Yes? Your question,
Miss Stella?

77
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,600
How many matches
will we be fighting?

78
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,200
Yuri:
It could easily amount to more
than 10 matches per student.

79
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,800
It's safe to assume
that you'll be fighting a match

80
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,900
once every three days.

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,400
Male Student:
Whoa, seriously?

82
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,867
Female Student:
That's insane!

83
00:04:48,967 --> 00:04:50,900
Female Student:
I don't even care about the
Seven Star Bored Fart Festival!
Once every three days.

84
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,233
Female Student:
I don't even care about the
Seven Star Bored Fart Festival!
In that case, maybe I can

85
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,300
In that case, maybe I can
use Itto Shura.

86
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,200
Yuri:
If you don't wish
to participate then don't...

87
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,433
Doing so will in
no way affect your grades.

88
00:04:58,533 --> 00:05:03,067
But in my opinion,
you're all being given
a really wonderful opportunity

89
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:06,000
to compete with one another
on a level playing field...

90
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,400
And so... I do hope
you'll all try.

91
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,933
Okay guys!
This coming year...

92
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:14,033
let's all do
our very best!

93
00:05:14,133 --> 00:05:16,533
AAAALLLLLright
let's give a cheer!

94
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:18,367
Hip, hip hoorAGGGHHHH!

95
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:19,300
(students screaming)

96
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,200
(concerned gasp)
Miss Yuri!

97
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,133
(sigh)
There she goes...

98
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:24,667
Yuri:
No reason to worry.

99
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:25,633
To tell the truth‐

100
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:28,233
I vomit at least
a liter of blood per day...

101
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,567
(coughing)

102
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:31,200
Th‐That's awful...

103
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,833
You shouldn't push yourself
so hard‐ Miss Yuri...

104
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:37,033
Mm. Oh I know,
but it's a big day!

105
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:40,400
I just wanted to be
at my very best for you guys...

106
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,400
Miss Yuri got
me accepted here.

107
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,533
I'm only in this school
because of her...

108
00:05:44,633 --> 00:05:45,167
No Ikki.

109
00:05:45,267 --> 00:05:48,133
It was nothing but your own
ability that got you in here.

110
00:05:48,233 --> 00:05:50,767
Although‐ last year
was very unfortunate...

111
00:05:50,867 --> 00:05:52,300
(nervous laugh)
Huh?

112
00:05:55,233 --> 00:05:58,333
So... Why was last
year so "unfortunate"?

113
00:05:58,433 --> 00:05:59,233
Oh‐ that's...

114
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:02,233
just because I wasn't
allowed to take any classes.

115
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:06,500
There was no standard criteria
for measuring my ability score.

116
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,533
Alright, so
why didn't...

117
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,533
Kagami:
Mister Kuroganeeeeeeeeeee...!

118
00:06:09,633 --> 00:06:10,767
(gasps)
Whoa!

119
00:06:10,867 --> 00:06:13,500
I finally get to meet
you‐ Mister Kurogane!

120
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,733
Omygod whatareyou...
WHO IS THIS?!

121
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:19,100
I don't have any idea!
Who are you‐ Miss...?

122
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,933
Kagami! Kagami Kusakabe‐

123
00:06:21,033 --> 00:06:24,500
I'm in your class!
I'm such a HUGE fan of yours!

124
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,400
Ikki:
What...? Fan...?

125
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,467
(snarling)

126
00:06:26,567 --> 00:06:28,667
I saw you fight!
In the mock battle!

127
00:06:28,767 --> 00:06:30,733
Amazing‐
Mister Kurogane!

128
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:33,333
Maybe that's
a stretch...

129
00:06:33,433 --> 00:06:36,233
I'm thinking seriously about
starting a newspaper club.

130
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:39,867
And I want you to be
on the front page of our
historic first issue!

131
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:41,900
Would you please let me
interview you?

132
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,433
I really don't think
I'd be much of a...

133
00:06:44,533 --> 00:06:48,033
Well look at you‐ already so
popular from the first day of
the school!

134
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:50,433
You definitely don't wanna
keep your public waiting‐

135
00:06:50,533 --> 00:06:51,333
"Mister Amazing..."

136
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:51,933
"Mister Amazing..."
No... STELLA!

137
00:06:52,033 --> 00:06:52,200
No... STELLA!

138
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,933
I've already got
the perfect headline!

139
00:06:54,033 --> 00:06:55,867
"Ikki Kurogane:
Genius In Our Midst‐

140
00:06:55,967 --> 00:06:57,100
A Man Nobody
Noticed Before,

141
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,867
Becomes The Center
Of Attention"!

142
00:06:58,967 --> 00:07:01,267
That's... a really long
headline‐

143
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:03,600
Can we talk later?!
Okay then...

144
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,233
Stella, WAIT!

145
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,067
Well‐ I finally found you!

146
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:08,267
Uh?

147
00:07:08,367 --> 00:07:10,367
(students talking)

148
00:07:10,467 --> 00:07:12,000
(giggles)

149
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,367
Shizu...ku?

150
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:13,967
Huh?

151
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:15,533
Male Student 1:
Dude, that's...

152
00:07:15,633 --> 00:07:16,267
Male Student 2:
Lorelei!

153
00:07:16,367 --> 00:07:18,700
Female Student:
She's second best
of the freshman!

154
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,700
I've really missed you...
my big brother!

155
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,300
Wow‐ Shizuku!
You look different!

156
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,867
I was going to come
searching for you later...

157
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:28,900
But it seems
like you beat me to it!

158
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,233
I know! I just really
couldn't wait to see you...

159
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,067
Big Brother...

160
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:33,467
Uh...

161
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:34,467
(kiss)
Hm?

162
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:35,067
(gasp)

163
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,433
Oh!

164
00:07:35,533 --> 00:07:38,767
(students in shock)

165
00:07:38,867 --> 00:07:40,467
What the hell is THIS?!

166
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:43,767
WOW! Front page,
FRONT PAGE!

167
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,067
(pants)

168
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,300
I have missed you...
so much...

169
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,433
Shizuku...?

170
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:53,733
I‐ I can't even...

171
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,567
IKKI OH MY GOD
WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE?!

172
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:57,600
I haven't got
the slightest idea!

173
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,467
I'm simply kissing
my beloved brother.

174
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:02,800
Kissing is only a
show of affection...

175
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,633
If two people who share a bond
like "romantic love" can kiss...

176
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:09,867
Then why... shouldn't I
be able to kiss my big brother‐

177
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:12,667
with whom I share such
a rare and special bond?

178
00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:15,600
Besides, it's like a greeting
in foreign countries...

179
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,800
Hm? It is...?

180
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,733
There are NO siblings who kiss
like that in my country!

181
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,833
In any other country,
actually!

182
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:23,533
I haven't
heard of it...

183
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:26,167
This is about us. Ignore them
all‐ Big Brother.

184
00:08:26,267 --> 00:08:28,733
We've been
separated for four long years...

185
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,167
even sleeping together at
night...

186
00:08:30,267 --> 00:08:32,967
wrapped in each others arms
wouldn't be strange for us.

187
00:08:33,067 --> 00:08:34,833
YES IT WOULD!

188
00:08:34,933 --> 00:08:38,200
Shizuku! You are a young
woman‐ this isn't right!

189
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,067
Jeez‐ I'm
just kidding!

190
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:43,200
But hey... I can tell it's
what you really want so...

191
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,200
THAT'S IT!

192
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,233
(struggling)

193
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,567
(yelp)

194
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:48,367
Pull yourself
together, Ikki!

195
00:08:48,467 --> 00:08:50,233
Don't just sit
there like an idiot!

196
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,967
Uh right, thank you, Stella...

197
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:54,800
Shizuku:
So you're the famous
Princess Stella...

198
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,000
I'll advise you
not to insert your petty,

199
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,167
common jealousies between
my brother and me...

200
00:08:59,267 --> 00:09:01,633
Stella:
Looks to me like someone
needs to put something

201
00:09:01,733 --> 00:09:03,133
between your
brother and you!

202
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:03,900
Oh really?

203
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,300
That's for my big brother
and me to decide.

204
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,233
Your opinion means
nothing to us!

205
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:08,933
Huh!

206
00:09:09,033 --> 00:09:11,300
We're related in ways
some feeble princess

207
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,100
could never
understand.

208
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,333
Oh yeah?‐ Well he and I
are sorta related too...!

209
00:09:15,433 --> 00:09:18,100
Oh? And just what
way is that...?

210
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,500
BECAUSE HE'S MY‐
I mean he's kinda my...

211
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,133
Shizuku:
What is my brother to you...?

212
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:25,233
(inhale) HE IS MY
GRACIOUS MASTER...

213
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,200
AND I AM HIS
DEVOTED SERVANT!

214
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,467
Students:
(gasp)

215
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:30,133
No wait‐
hold on Stella!

216
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:31,733
I told you we should
forget about that...

217
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:33,467
THIS IS ONE
JUICY SCANDAL!

218
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:34,800
I can see
the headline...

219
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,800
Kagami:
"MOGAKE:
Struggle In My Arms‐

220
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,867
A bonded princess servant
and her savage roommate

221
00:09:38,967 --> 00:09:41,600
in closed room
for 72 hours.

222
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,467
What is with...
these long headlines?!

223
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:45,733
Long but accurate!

224
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,233
After you defeated
me in battle,

225
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,567
you did give me
an order...

226
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,200
Stella... you must
sleep in my bed....

227
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,800
NO‐ STOP
THE FLASHBACK!

228
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,433
You know I didn't say
anything like that!

229
00:09:58,533 --> 00:09:59,367
Is this all true?

230
00:09:59,467 --> 00:10:01,067
Er...

231
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:04,533
Big Brother... I'm asking
you if it's true.

232
00:10:04,633 --> 00:10:05,600
Well, sort of...

233
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,867
I mean in a way
I guess it's true.

234
00:10:07,967 --> 00:10:11,267
But I really...
just meant the bunk bed...

235
00:10:11,367 --> 00:10:13,667
Shizuku:
(giggles)

236
00:10:13,767 --> 00:10:16,867
Because if it is...
if it is true...

237
00:10:16,967 --> 00:10:17,133
(giggles)

238
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:20,233
I... I don't...
Shizuku what're you...?

239
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:20,933
Then Big Brother,

240
00:10:21,033 --> 00:10:24,233
I will free you from your
burden this very moment....

241
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,233
Shower me...
Yoi Shigure!

242
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,967
Shizuku!
No‐ you can't...!

243
00:10:28,067 --> 00:10:30,400
Well of course
I can Big Brother!

244
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,367
I'm water
and she's fire.

245
00:10:32,467 --> 00:10:33,600
Water will always
put out a fire...

246
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,200
Ikki:
No‐ what?‐ that's not
what I'm talking about!

247
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,567
If you use your device
in an undesignated area...

248
00:10:38,667 --> 00:10:41,633
Stella:
Serve my will,
Laevatein.

249
00:10:42,733 --> 00:10:44,933
AND YOU SHOULD
NOT BE ENCOURAGING HER!

250
00:10:45,033 --> 00:10:45,333
(sword swoosh)

251
00:10:45,433 --> 00:10:48,100
It's such a frail and
delicate little device...

252
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,333
It's an awful
lot like its wielder...

253
00:10:50,433 --> 00:10:51,300
Yours seems fitting....

254
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,600
Tasteless, classless,
gilded, gaudy, and provincial.

255
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,500
And of course,
comically oversized....

256
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,333
Well, well, well...

257
00:10:57,433 --> 00:11:00,567
someone seems a little hung up
on the size of my assets‐

258
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:02,333
maybe she's jealous...

259
00:11:02,967 --> 00:11:03,067
Fat.

260
00:11:03,167 --> 00:11:03,833
Ugly.

261
00:11:03,933 --> 00:11:04,100
(scoffs)

262
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,933
Stella & Shizuku:
NO YOU DID NOT!

263
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:08,933
(explosion)

264
00:11:09,033 --> 00:11:10,700
Students:
Whoa!
(explosion)

265
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,333
(explosion)

266
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,449
Kurono:
On or off campus,
the activation of devices

267
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:22,949
outside of a designated
combat area is forbidden.

268
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,183
Ordinarily‐ you'd both
be suspended...

269
00:11:25,283 --> 00:11:27,716
However‐ since it
was the first day‐

270
00:11:27,816 --> 00:11:29,983
you'll just be cleaning
restrooms for a week.

271
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,283
You may now thank me
for my generosity...

272
00:11:32,383 --> 00:11:35,116
Thank you very much for
your generosity‐ Director...

273
00:11:35,216 --> 00:11:38,416
I'm very sorry‐ I promise
to never do that again...

274
00:11:38,516 --> 00:11:39,216
Very good.

275
00:11:39,316 --> 00:11:42,716
You may go home after you've
finished all the ladies'
restrooms in the school.

276
00:11:42,816 --> 00:11:45,583
Don't worry girls, only
twenty six more to go.

277
00:11:45,683 --> 00:11:46,983
(giggles)

278
00:11:48,716 --> 00:11:50,083
Washboard.

279
00:11:50,183 --> 00:11:51,183
Top heavy.

280
00:11:51,283 --> 00:11:52,316
Baby Bee Stings.

281
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:53,416
Floppy Grandma.

282
00:11:53,516 --> 00:11:54,949
Wet rag.

283
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:55,783
Dud firecracker.

284
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:58,649
Stella:
(angry grunt) Zero feet
above sea level.

285
00:11:58,749 --> 00:11:59,849
Shizuku:
Mount Everest.

286
00:11:59,949 --> 00:12:01,249
Both:
(angry panting)

287
00:12:01,349 --> 00:12:04,316
Stella:
Under‐inflated
water balloon.

288
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,283
(panting continues)

289
00:12:06,383 --> 00:12:09,316
Shizuku:
Over‐inflated
sex doll!

290
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:12,349
Hey, alright‐ I'm gonna give
you a break pipsqueak!

291
00:12:12,449 --> 00:12:14,016
Good‐ then you'll
leave him alone?

292
00:12:14,116 --> 00:12:15,783
You'll stay away
from my big brother

293
00:12:15,883 --> 00:12:16,883
for the rest
of your life?

294
00:12:16,983 --> 00:12:18,583
That's not
what I meant!

295
00:12:18,683 --> 00:12:20,016
And I am sorry
to tell you,

296
00:12:20,116 --> 00:12:22,016
but I can't exactly
"stay away."

297
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,583
When we happen
to be roommates!

298
00:12:23,683 --> 00:12:25,649
Ugh. No matter
what excuse you use

299
00:12:25,749 --> 00:12:27,849
to manipulate
your way into his life...

300
00:12:27,949 --> 00:12:29,816
my big brother will
always belong to me.

301
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:30,949
What are you‐ crazy?!

302
00:12:31,049 --> 00:12:33,483
This is your actual brother
we're talking about here‐

303
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,116
what the hell is
the matter with you?!

304
00:12:35,216 --> 00:12:38,216
This is something that you are
incapable of ever understanding.

305
00:12:38,316 --> 00:12:39,616
What are you
talking about?

306
00:12:39,716 --> 00:12:40,783
What's the
big secret?!

307
00:12:40,883 --> 00:12:43,383
I didn't say...
It's not that it's...

308
00:12:43,483 --> 00:12:44,483
(footsteps)

309
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:45,249
What is it?

310
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:47,716
Whatever it might be,
it's useless to talk to you

311
00:12:47,816 --> 00:12:49,483
because you
will not understand!

312
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:50,783
You're not a Kurogane‐
you'll never...

313
00:12:50,883 --> 00:12:53,583
Oh don't even try playing
the family card on me!

314
00:12:53,683 --> 00:12:55,383
I've got family too!

315
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,016
You have no idea,
princess!

316
00:12:57,116 --> 00:12:58,316
How my brother felt‐

317
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,049
being treated like
he never existed!

318
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:01,216
Oh.

319
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,049
Uh.

320
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,383
Stella:
What do you mean...

321
00:13:05,483 --> 00:13:06,883
"like he
never existed"?

322
00:13:06,983 --> 00:13:08,683
I don't
understand...

323
00:13:08,783 --> 00:13:10,516
Shizuku:
Of course
you don't.

324
00:13:10,616 --> 00:13:11,949
And you
never will...

325
00:13:12,049 --> 00:13:14,583
Just leave both
of us alone.

326
00:13:15,383 --> 00:13:16,449
(door opens)

327
00:13:16,549 --> 00:13:18,016
Alice:
Enter:...
"the roommate."

328
00:13:18,116 --> 00:13:18,683
(gasps)

329
00:13:18,783 --> 00:13:21,283
I was wondering when
I was going to meet you.

330
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,116
Well come on in‐

331
00:13:22,216 --> 00:13:24,683
and I will call off
the search and rescue.

332
00:13:24,783 --> 00:13:26,616
I'm Nagi Arisuin...

333
00:13:26,716 --> 00:13:28,983
But My friends just
call me "Alice."

334
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,183
Mm.

335
00:13:33,683 --> 00:13:36,816
What does she mean,
"like he never existed"?

336
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,516
Ikki:
Hey, Stella....

337
00:13:38,616 --> 00:13:39,149
Oh.

338
00:13:39,249 --> 00:13:40,783
What are
you doing here?

339
00:13:40,883 --> 00:13:43,983
Oh, I was...
waiting for you...

340
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:44,283
Huh?

341
00:13:44,383 --> 00:13:46,449
I mean I thought we were
supposed to practice‐

342
00:13:46,549 --> 00:13:47,683
but then you
didn't show...

343
00:13:47,783 --> 00:13:50,349
I figured you might not
feel up to it today...

344
00:13:50,449 --> 00:13:51,249
Sorry bout that.

345
00:13:51,349 --> 00:13:52,483
It's no big deal...

346
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,316
this is for you...

347
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,583
It was in the room.

348
00:13:55,683 --> 00:13:56,983
Ikki:
Oh, thanks.

349
00:13:57,549 --> 00:13:58,316
Ikki...?

350
00:13:58,416 --> 00:13:59,649
(gulping water)
Hm?

351
00:13:59,749 --> 00:14:01,549
Why would your family
want to treat you

352
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:03,049
like you never
existed?

353
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:03,683
(spit take)

354
00:14:03,783 --> 00:14:05,083
Oh... oh! Sorry!

355
00:14:05,183 --> 00:14:07,449
Maybe it would've been better
if I'd been a little less direct

356
00:14:07,549 --> 00:14:08,849
asking that question...

357
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:11,749
Ah... I guess you've
been talking to Shizuku?

358
00:14:11,849 --> 00:14:14,516
Um... well yeah.
Maybe a little....

359
00:14:14,616 --> 00:14:17,349
It's okay, I wanted
to tell you...

360
00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:20,749
I guess this might be
just as good a time as any.

361
00:14:20,849 --> 00:14:21,383
Huh?

362
00:14:21,483 --> 00:14:25,316
Are you sure you want to hear
this? It's kinda depressing...

363
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:28,883
Hm... mhm.

364
00:14:28,983 --> 00:14:31,749
Ikki:
Have you heard of
a samurai named Ryoma?

365
00:14:31,849 --> 00:14:33,149
Of course I have!

366
00:14:33,249 --> 00:14:37,049
Stella:
He's the hero that led Japan to
victory in the last world war.

367
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:39,416
Everyone's heard
of Ryoma Kurogane...

368
00:14:39,516 --> 00:14:40,116
Oh....

369
00:14:40,216 --> 00:14:43,149
Right‐yeah‐that's the one
I mean‐ he's my grandfather.

370
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:46,783
And he's... the kind of man
I want to be.

371
00:14:48,383 --> 00:14:51,883
Ikki:
For generations, the Kurogane
have produced brilliant Blazers.

372
00:14:51,983 --> 00:14:54,749
What they call a
"distinguished legacy."

373
00:14:54,849 --> 00:14:57,683
But I wasn't like
the rest of my family...

374
00:14:57,783 --> 00:14:59,983
I didn't have their gift...

375
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:04,383
So they decided that I wasn't
worth acknowledging...

376
00:15:04,483 --> 00:15:08,049
...there was never a seat
for me at my family's table...

377
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:12,049
Then one year... while I
hid away and listened...

378
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:14,483
I could hear them
at their New Year's party,

379
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,183
and something
in me just broke...

380
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:18,583
(wind whipping)

381
00:15:18,683 --> 00:15:20,883
I didn't know
where I was going...

382
00:15:20,983 --> 00:15:24,449
But I... I knew that
I had to go...

383
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:25,516
Somewhere...

384
00:15:25,616 --> 00:15:27,816
(wind whipping)

385
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:32,216
I suddenly realized I was lost.
And I was freezing.

386
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:38,416
I think I was ready to die.
but then all I could think of...

387
00:15:38,516 --> 00:15:42,216
was how frustrating it would be
to die like this.

388
00:15:43,816 --> 00:15:45,283
And then...

389
00:15:45,383 --> 00:15:48,249
he was suddenly there‐
standing in front of me.

390
00:15:48,349 --> 00:15:50,283
(footsteps in the snow)

391
00:15:53,349 --> 00:15:54,816
The samurai Ryoma?

392
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:58,216
Yes. And I remember
every word he said.

393
00:15:58,316 --> 00:16:00,716
I'll never
forget it...

394
00:16:00,816 --> 00:16:02,549
Does it frustrate you kid?

395
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:04,749
Does it upset you,
to be the weakest one?

396
00:16:04,849 --> 00:16:06,949
That's good,
hold on to that feeling.

397
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:11,383
Ryoma:
It's proof. That feeling means
that you are not yet ready...

398
00:16:11,483 --> 00:16:13,583
to give up on yourself.

399
00:16:13,683 --> 00:16:15,083
Take it from me, boy.

400
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:18,283
Your life will be very boring
if you aspire for no more

401
00:16:18,383 --> 00:16:20,183
than to "live within
your means."

402
00:16:20,283 --> 00:16:24,516
You can be anything you want
to be... look at all mankind!

403
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:27,049
We were... never gifted
with a pair of wings‐

404
00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:29,783
yet we've still
flown to the moon...

405
00:16:29,883 --> 00:16:32,516
He spoke to me
in the simplest terms...

406
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:35,283
but those words
saved my life.

407
00:16:35,383 --> 00:16:36,916
Hm.

408
00:16:38,549 --> 00:16:39,816
So I decided...

409
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:44,083
right then that's the kind
of man I would become.

410
00:16:44,183 --> 00:16:47,583
Someday‐ I might meet someone
like I was then...

411
00:16:47,683 --> 00:16:51,149
I want to give them what
my grandfather gave me.

412
00:16:51,249 --> 00:16:55,949
But in order to do that...
I have to be as strong as I can.

413
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,749
Like my grandfather.

414
00:16:58,849 --> 00:17:01,549
So that's why you wanted
to become a knight.

415
00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:03,983
But no one wanted
to teach me anything...

416
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:06,349
So I did my
practicing alone.

417
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:07,616
Alone?

418
00:17:07,716 --> 00:17:08,549
(flames crackle)

419
00:17:08,649 --> 00:17:11,049
(panting)

420
00:17:11,149 --> 00:17:14,916
Ikki:
Eventually... I got
accepted to this school.

421
00:17:15,016 --> 00:17:17,649
Ikki:
My family didn't like the idea
that a failure like me

422
00:17:17,749 --> 00:17:20,449
could earn his place among
them as a knight...

423
00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:22,516
So they started
to pressure the school.

424
00:17:22,616 --> 00:17:23,116
Huh?

425
00:17:23,216 --> 00:17:26,316
The standard requirements
to take a class...

426
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:30,216
those were created by the
former director of the academy.

427
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:32,716
To prevent me
from graduating.

428
00:17:32,816 --> 00:17:35,749
(breeze blows)

429
00:17:35,849 --> 00:17:39,783
Luckily, the new director
is Kurono Shinguji.

430
00:17:39,883 --> 00:17:43,016
But my family's going to try
to pressure her too...

431
00:17:43,116 --> 00:17:46,249
But even...
even if they do...

432
00:17:46,349 --> 00:17:47,649
You won't give up.

433
00:17:47,749 --> 00:17:51,349
Even if you end up getting
burned... badly...

434
00:17:56,316 --> 00:17:58,583
Stella:
I think I understand
how you feel...

435
00:17:58,683 --> 00:17:59,683
I mean sort've...

436
00:17:59,783 --> 00:18:03,249
I know...
I know you do, Stella.

437
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:04,283
However, Ikki‐

438
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:07,216
there is still one thing we're
going to have to correct here...

439
00:18:07,316 --> 00:18:08,249
What's that?

440
00:18:08,349 --> 00:18:09,583
Earlier today...

441
00:18:09,683 --> 00:18:12,249
you accused me of having
a competitive streak.

442
00:18:12,349 --> 00:18:13,683
Oh...

443
00:18:13,783 --> 00:18:15,883
Yeah, I guess
I should correct that...

444
00:18:15,983 --> 00:18:19,483
Okay so... We're
both competitive.

445
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,149
That's more like it!

446
00:18:21,249 --> 00:18:22,783
(giggles)

447
00:18:24,449 --> 00:18:28,216
Shizuku:
I always loved my brother...
because he was kind.

448
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:33,249
Even after he left the house...
left us... I still loved him.

449
00:18:33,349 --> 00:18:36,949
When I could see how badly
my family had treated him...

450
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:41,549
I hated them. I despised them
from the bottom of my heart.

451
00:18:41,649 --> 00:18:43,083
And I decided...

452
00:18:43,183 --> 00:18:47,016
Our father's love, our mother's
love, our brothers' love...

453
00:18:47,116 --> 00:18:49,083
all that they
wouldn't give him...

454
00:18:49,183 --> 00:18:52,983
I would give him all
that he deserves myself.

455
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,416
Heh.

456
00:18:54,516 --> 00:18:56,583
Oh, I'm so sorry!

457
00:18:56,683 --> 00:18:58,616
We just met and I'm
talking your ear off...

458
00:18:58,716 --> 00:19:01,449
You don't like people very much‐
do you Shizuku...?

459
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:01,983
Huh?

460
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,449
Probably always
been uncomfortable
around strangers...

461
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:07,116
but it sounds like...
your family made
it impossible

462
00:19:07,216 --> 00:19:09,783
for you to be
comfortable with anyone.

463
00:19:09,883 --> 00:19:11,583
Uh...

464
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:12,549
I get that.

465
00:19:12,649 --> 00:19:15,216
I used to know a "little girl"
who was a lot like you...

466
00:19:15,316 --> 00:19:17,283
Well, obviously you
and I are now going to be

467
00:19:17,383 --> 00:19:18,749
the very best
of friends.

468
00:19:18,849 --> 00:19:20,016
You ever want to
talk about anything‐

469
00:19:20,116 --> 00:19:23,249
you talk to me‐ okay?
Just like a big sister.

470
00:19:24,249 --> 00:19:25,683
'kay!

471
00:19:25,783 --> 00:19:27,816
Stella:
(humming)
(stew stirring)

472
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,849
(humming continues)

473
00:19:30,949 --> 00:19:31,349
Hm?

474
00:19:31,449 --> 00:19:32,616
(water sloshes in bathtub)

475
00:19:32,716 --> 00:19:33,349
Hm.
(water sloshes in bathtub)

476
00:19:33,449 --> 00:19:35,649
(water sloshes in bathtub)

477
00:19:38,283 --> 00:19:39,049
(water moving)

478
00:19:39,149 --> 00:19:40,449
(relaxed sigh)

479
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:42,449
Stella:
Ikki, I'm coming in.

480
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:43,949
Oh sure, go ahead...

481
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:45,583
Ahh!
(splash)

482
00:19:45,683 --> 00:19:46,983
Ikki:
AHHH!

483
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:47,949
S‐Stella?!

484
00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:51,016
What?! Ikki‐ why are you
freaking out like that?

485
00:19:51,116 --> 00:19:53,649
I'm not freak‐ I mean
OF COURSE I'm freaking out!

486
00:19:53,749 --> 00:19:54,983
What are you doing?!

487
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:55,983
Well I...

488
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,216
I thought that maybe
you would like me to come in

489
00:19:58,316 --> 00:19:59,683
and help you wash up...

490
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:01,483
Ikki:
Huh? W‐why?

491
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,616
Because, you know...

492
00:20:03,716 --> 00:20:06,349
I mean‐ I took a vow
and I am your servant...

493
00:20:06,449 --> 00:20:09,383
And this is one of the many
things that servants do.

494
00:20:09,483 --> 00:20:11,949
So it's my duty
to bathe you. Right?

495
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:13,316
But you don't have to‐
I didn't ask!

496
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:16,316
The very best servants
do not have to be asked!

497
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:19,016
Sit‐ and let
me do my job... now!

498
00:20:19,116 --> 00:20:20,349
Ikki:
B‐But...

499
00:20:20,449 --> 00:20:22,016
Or I could boil you...

500
00:20:22,116 --> 00:20:22,716
Ikki:
Okay...

501
00:20:22,816 --> 00:20:24,383
(soapy rag scrubbing)

502
00:20:24,483 --> 00:20:25,949
Stella:
Hm.

503
00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:26,249
Hm.

504
00:20:26,349 --> 00:20:29,516
(scrubbing continues)

505
00:20:29,616 --> 00:20:30,849
Hm.
(gasp)

506
00:20:30,949 --> 00:20:32,549
(fleshy slapping sounds)

507
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:36,049
(scrubbing continues)

508
00:20:36,149 --> 00:20:37,716
(exerted sigh)

509
00:20:38,616 --> 00:20:39,583
(restrained sigh)

510
00:20:39,683 --> 00:20:41,649
(fleshy slap)

511
00:20:41,749 --> 00:20:44,049
Here... I'll do
your back next.

512
00:20:44,149 --> 00:20:45,316
O...kay.

513
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:46,816
Hey, um Ikki?

514
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:49,349
I uh, want to ask
you something...

515
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:50,816
W‐what?

516
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,583
Do you like looking at girls'
breasts and stuff?

517
00:20:53,683 --> 00:20:56,283
(stammers)
Why are you asking me that?!

518
00:20:56,383 --> 00:21:00,149
Because... when that girl Kagami
was pushing hers against you‐

519
00:21:00,249 --> 00:21:01,783
you seemed happy.

520
00:21:01,883 --> 00:21:04,116
And I noticed...
you've been...

521
00:21:04,216 --> 00:21:06,249
well you've been
looking at mine a lot...

522
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:07,983
Uh‐Sorry!

523
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:11,516
You don't have to apologize,
just... tell me the truth...

524
00:21:11,616 --> 00:21:13,216
Mm...

525
00:21:13,316 --> 00:21:14,849
I like them.

526
00:21:14,949 --> 00:21:16,183
'Kay...

527
00:21:19,116 --> 00:21:20,616
(shower drips)

528
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:22,583
Mm.

529
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:25,883
(bouncing effect)

530
00:21:25,983 --> 00:21:29,016
Uh... wha‐ what are
you doing with your...

531
00:21:30,316 --> 00:21:32,316
No! Stay still!

532
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,383
Huh?! Whaaa‐?!

533
00:21:33,483 --> 00:21:36,549
Y‐You're not supposed to move!

534
00:21:36,649 --> 00:21:39,016
(flustered gasp)
Uh... 'kay...!

535
00:21:39,116 --> 00:21:39,716
Don't move...

536
00:21:39,816 --> 00:21:41,149
(bikini unfastens)

537
00:21:41,649 --> 00:21:43,049
(bikini falls)

538
00:21:51,116 --> 00:21:51,916
Uhh?!

539
00:21:52,016 --> 00:21:52,716
O‐oh...

540
00:21:52,816 --> 00:21:54,849
(echoing moan effect)

541
00:21:55,616 --> 00:21:57,149
Uhh...!

542
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:59,116
H‐Hey, Stella, maybe...?

543
00:21:59,216 --> 00:22:01,216
(shrieks)
Don't look at me!

544
00:22:02,016 --> 00:22:02,783
Uh...

545
00:22:02,883 --> 00:22:03,916
OH!

546
00:22:04,016 --> 00:22:06,083
Uh, Stella...!

547
00:22:06,183 --> 00:22:10,616
This, is this‐ are you‐
umm... uh... n‐naked...?

548
00:22:10,716 --> 00:22:13,183
Stella:
(slaps)
(screams)
