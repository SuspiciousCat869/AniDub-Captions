1
00:00:08,912 --> 00:00:10,430
Ikki:
So... what was it
you needed?

2
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,330
Ayase:
Well, the reason I wanted you
to meet me here so late is...

3
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,063
because I have something
important to ask you.

4
00:00:17,163 --> 00:00:18,296
Whatever you need...

5
00:00:18,396 --> 00:00:21,196
I recently heard that you
and Princess Stella...

6
00:00:21,296 --> 00:00:23,163
have promised that you
would fight one another...

7
00:00:23,263 --> 00:00:25,430
at the Seven Star
Sword Art Festival.

8
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,330
That's right.

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,696
Ikki:
We both promised
each other...

10
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:31,130
that we would be
sure to fight again.

11
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:32,730
I see...

12
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,563
But what if before
you get there...

13
00:00:34,663 --> 00:00:37,530
you're forced to face an enemy
that you can never even hope

14
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,196
to defeat in your life?

15
00:00:39,296 --> 00:00:41,730
What do you think
you'd do then‐ Ikki?

16
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:45,396
I would fight fair‐
and with everything I've got.

17
00:00:45,496 --> 00:00:46,696
Even if it's hopeless?

18
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:51,030
Yes. All I can ever do...
is give it all I've got.

19
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,263
Oh no...
there's much more...

20
00:00:54,363 --> 00:00:57,430
You wanna face your enemy
on the higher ground...

21
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,163
you wanna fight fair.

22
00:01:01,063 --> 00:01:02,963
But me...

23
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,330
No matter how much it takes...
I will take him out.

24
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,096
(bell rings)

25
00:01:08,196 --> 00:01:10,096
(blade cuts through metal)

26
00:01:17,296 --> 00:01:20,196
Ikki:
AYATSUJI NOOOOOOO!

27
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:56,599
AYATSUJI NOOOOOOO!

28
00:02:59,132 --> 00:03:00,666
Itto Shura!

29
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:06,599
HAAAAA!

30
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:11,066
Still not clear...

31
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:14,399
(swings foot)
(explosion)

32
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:31,366
I don't understand...
Ayatsuji...

33
00:03:31,466 --> 00:03:33,232
If I hadn't saved
you, you'd be‐

34
00:03:33,332 --> 00:03:34,732
You used it.

35
00:03:35,832 --> 00:03:37,499
You used it!

36
00:03:38,932 --> 00:03:40,766
Itto Shura...

37
00:03:41,399 --> 00:03:43,399
You mean you...

38
00:03:45,832 --> 00:03:46,999
So it was...

39
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:50,399
your intention from the
beginning to make me use it...?

40
00:03:50,499 --> 00:03:51,866
Ayase:
Your ace
in the hole...

41
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:54,432
which you can only
use once a day...

42
00:03:54,532 --> 00:03:57,632
The selection match
begins in 10 hours.

43
00:03:57,732 --> 00:04:00,499
You won't have enough
time to recover.

44
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:03,532
This way‐ I have
a chance to win.

45
00:04:03,632 --> 00:04:06,532
I may not be a skilled
enough swordsman...

46
00:04:06,632 --> 00:04:08,999
but if I combine it with my
ability as a blazer,

47
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:12,499
I can defeat you now that
you've lost your "ace."

48
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,066
Ikki:
Why...?

49
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,366
Ayase...?

50
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,766
Why is winning
so important to you...?

51
00:04:19,866 --> 00:04:23,666
That you would throw away...
everything the knighthood
stands for...

52
00:04:23,766 --> 00:04:26,066
you'd sacrifice your pride...?

53
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:26,899
Why would
you do that...?

54
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:29,799
I do not care
what you say.

55
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:32,499
I'll defeat you
however I can...

56
00:04:32,599 --> 00:04:35,032
because I have to.

57
00:04:35,132 --> 00:04:37,432
(pants)
W‐wait.

58
00:04:40,299 --> 00:04:43,399
Ayase...
please wait...

59
00:04:49,766 --> 00:04:52,332
Oh... oh...!

60
00:04:52,432 --> 00:04:56,532
No you don't, Ikki...
We can't out here...

61
00:04:56,632 --> 00:04:59,532
Not "Nighttime Itto Shura..."

62
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,332
But everybody is looking at us.

63
00:05:01,432 --> 00:05:04,366
(giggles)
I told you no Ikki!

64
00:05:04,466 --> 00:05:06,066
(thud)

65
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:09,132
I can't... what was...?

66
00:05:10,932 --> 00:05:13,232
Ikki?

67
00:05:13,332 --> 00:05:17,099
Oh my God, Ikki‐ what are you
doing?! It's the middle of the
night!

68
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:17,799
What the...?

69
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:21,366
Well are you gonna
say something‐ or uh... uh...?

70
00:05:21,466 --> 00:05:25,499
Oh! Wait I've heard about this!
You Japanese guys...

71
00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:29,799
get... sneaky... when the lights
go down...? Uh...

72
00:05:31,232 --> 00:05:32,866
Hey... Ikki...?

73
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:37,966
Ikki what are... uh...
Ikki? IKKI WAKE UP!!!

74
00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:44,266
Uh... where am I?

75
00:05:44,366 --> 00:05:45,799
Shizuku:
Big Brother!

76
00:05:47,566 --> 00:05:48,499
Ikki:
Shizuku...

77
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:51,066
Oh thank God...
Are you alright?

78
00:05:51,932 --> 00:05:53,699
How long was I...?

79
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,232
Ahh!

80
00:05:55,332 --> 00:05:56,766
Stella:
You still have time.

81
00:05:56,866 --> 00:05:59,299
The match doesn't
start until 3pm.

82
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,866
So you still have
plenty of time.

83
00:06:02,466 --> 00:06:04,366
Alice told us.

84
00:06:04,466 --> 00:06:07,799
Ayase Ayatsuji wanted
to meet you last night.

85
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:09,366
Yeah...

86
00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:12,632
She was...

87
00:06:12,732 --> 00:06:15,699
Oh good, it looks like you're
finally awake, Kurogane.

88
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:19,732
I know you must be tired...
but I need you for a sec...

89
00:06:23,499 --> 00:06:23,932
Male Student:
What the heck
was this...?!

90
00:06:24,032 --> 00:06:24,566
Male Student:
What the heck
was this...?!
Kurono:

91
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:27,666
Kurono:
So... I think
I recognize your work,
Mr. Kurogane.

92
00:06:27,766 --> 00:06:29,566
I heard you were brought
into the Nurse's Office,

93
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,899
so I had what we
call "a hunch..."

94
00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:33,699
I can't
say anything.

95
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:35,566
But I will accept the
punishment...

96
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:37,666
Stella:
Ah! Hey, Ikki!

97
00:06:37,766 --> 00:06:39,732
Ikki:
Stella...

98
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:40,499
(chuckles)

99
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:44,699
Why now Mister Kurogane... might
you be covering for someone?

100
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:47,132
Ikki:
May I ask you
something, Director?

101
00:06:47,232 --> 00:06:48,199
Hm?

102
00:06:48,299 --> 00:06:51,899
About Ayase Ayatsuji
of Class 3‐1.

103
00:06:55,799 --> 00:07:00,099
Well‐ he'll find out on his own,
so I might as well...

104
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:02,199
About two years
ago... I think...

105
00:07:02,299 --> 00:07:06,966
her father, Kaito Ayatsuji,
better known as the
Last Samurai...

106
00:07:07,066 --> 00:07:10,099
wielded his sword
for the very last time.

107
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,999
Well what happened
to him...?

108
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:16,866
His school was challenged and he
fought a one‐on‐one battle to
defend its honor.

109
00:07:16,966 --> 00:07:17,532
His opponent was‐

110
00:07:17,632 --> 00:07:19,399
The Sword Eater...

111
00:07:19,499 --> 00:07:21,232
from Donro Academy...

112
00:07:21,332 --> 00:07:24,466
Kurashiki... correct?

113
00:07:24,566 --> 00:07:26,232
Kurono:
That's right.

114
00:07:26,332 --> 00:07:29,799
And according to the rules they
agreed upon before their duel,

115
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:35,032
ownership of the family's
land and holdings was
transferred to Kurashiki.

116
00:07:35,132 --> 00:07:38,699
What about Kaito?
What's his condition?

117
00:07:38,799 --> 00:07:43,499
He's been unconscious...
for the past two years.

118
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:49,566
Kaito:
Ayase, listen...

119
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:52,799
A warrior must never lose
sight of her pride.

120
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:57,732
Value civility.
Help the weak. Hate all evil.

121
00:07:57,832 --> 00:08:01,432
No matter the enemy‐ you face
them fair and square....

122
00:08:01,532 --> 00:08:03,966
Become a
swordswoman of honor.

123
00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:10,499
Ugh!

124
00:08:13,966 --> 00:08:14,832
Kurado:
You know...

125
00:08:14,932 --> 00:08:19,099
You're not even worth the time
it would take me to kill you.

126
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,799
Don't come back.

127
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:24,232
(seething)

128
00:08:24,332 --> 00:08:27,432
I could fight him at the
Seven Star Sword Art Festival.

129
00:08:27,532 --> 00:08:29,732
It's... my last chance.

130
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:32,432
I...

131
00:08:32,532 --> 00:08:36,466
I'm... I'm... sorry...

132
00:08:39,832 --> 00:08:42,399
Don't apologize
anymore, Father.

133
00:08:43,466 --> 00:08:46,466
I promise I'll
get everything back.

134
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:48,832
That's a terrible
story.

135
00:08:48,932 --> 00:08:51,266
Everything the poor girl ever
loved or treasured

136
00:08:51,366 --> 00:08:53,432
was taken from her.

137
00:08:53,532 --> 00:08:56,166
Alice:
But that's what makes her
so fierce.

138
00:08:56,266 --> 00:08:58,399
She's like a desperate
animal.

139
00:08:58,499 --> 00:09:02,432
And she see you as the only
thing that's standing
in her way.

140
00:09:02,532 --> 00:09:04,966
So what are you
gonna do, Ikki?

141
00:09:06,266 --> 00:09:09,799
I'm going to fight her
with all my heart and soul.

142
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:12,899
Anything less...
would be an insult.

143
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:14,632
Shizuku:
Okay, but...

144
00:09:14,732 --> 00:09:16,599
She used such
a dirty trick...

145
00:09:16,699 --> 00:09:17,932
Shizuku.

146
00:09:20,266 --> 00:09:21,266
Stella.

147
00:09:21,366 --> 00:09:22,666
Hm?

148
00:09:23,499 --> 00:09:25,666
Would you...
come with me?

149
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:28,799
Yeah... okay...
to where?

150
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:29,832
I've just got...

151
00:09:29,932 --> 00:09:32,599
one more thing
that I need to do...

152
00:09:32,699 --> 00:09:34,766
before the
big fight.

153
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,032
Huh?

154
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,754
Hangetsu:
Here we are on
Training Field Three,

155
00:09:45,854 --> 00:09:48,654
and today's third match
is just about to begin!

156
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,754
I'm your reporter...
Hangetsu Tsukuyomi checking in.

157
00:09:51,854 --> 00:09:54,454
On commentary:
Miss Yuri Oriki!

158
00:09:54,554 --> 00:09:55,321
Hello everybody!

159
00:09:55,421 --> 00:09:57,721
Students:
(cheers)

160
00:09:57,821 --> 00:10:00,787
Well Miss Yuri, I must say
you're looking well.

161
00:10:00,887 --> 00:10:04,454
Mmm. Thanks so much‐ but we're
just getting started...

162
00:10:04,554 --> 00:10:06,287
The Miss Yuri you
all know and love

163
00:10:06,387 --> 00:10:07,987
will be back to
her old ways soon.

164
00:10:08,087 --> 00:10:12,054
But don't worry!...
I've got spare blood
and I'm ready to GO...

165
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:12,854
Bleeeghhhh...

166
00:10:12,954 --> 00:10:18,821
Hangetsu:
Well folks... as Miss Yuri
demonstrates, what's a battle
without bloodshed?!

167
00:10:18,921 --> 00:10:22,421
Female PA:
Combatant entering
via the East Gate.

168
00:10:28,254 --> 00:10:30,721
Hangetsu:
And here's the
First Year Sensation,

169
00:10:30,821 --> 00:10:33,154
an F‐rank knight with
a perfect record

170
00:10:33,254 --> 00:10:35,421
of six wins for
six fights...

171
00:10:35,521 --> 00:10:37,321
We used to call
him "The Worst One"

172
00:10:37,421 --> 00:10:39,721
but now we call him
"Another One..."

173
00:10:39,821 --> 00:10:42,587
Still undefeated...
Ikki Kurogane!

174
00:10:42,687 --> 00:10:45,021
Female PA:
Combatant entering
via the West Gate.

175
00:10:45,121 --> 00:10:48,687
Hangetsu:
Across from him, Combatant
Number Two makes her appearance.

176
00:10:48,787 --> 00:10:51,421
Also undefeated‐ a Third‐Year
with a spotless record

177
00:10:51,521 --> 00:10:53,621
of six wins for six fights...

178
00:10:53,721 --> 00:10:57,054
She is a D‐rank knight
from class three‐one...

179
00:10:57,154 --> 00:10:59,154
Ayase Ayatsuji!

180
00:10:59,254 --> 00:11:01,987
Students:
(cheers and applause)

181
00:11:02,087 --> 00:11:04,487
Kagami:
"Uniquely Gifted Swordsman
and Swordswoman...

182
00:11:04,587 --> 00:11:08,687
Devoted Pupil‐ Ayase
Rises Up Against
Her Swordmaster‐ Kurogane..."

183
00:11:08,787 --> 00:11:13,821
"Student Versus Teacher In An
Epic Battle From which there
Can Emerge Only One Victor..."

184
00:11:13,921 --> 00:11:15,554
Front page!

185
00:11:16,287 --> 00:11:17,654
So you showed up after all.

186
00:11:17,754 --> 00:11:21,087
I was hoping to make this
a "win by default, This time."

187
00:11:21,187 --> 00:11:23,487
I'm really quite
impressed‐ Kurogane.

188
00:11:23,587 --> 00:11:25,787
Come to me, Intetsu.

189
00:11:30,387 --> 00:11:32,721
I know that you will
never forgive me.

190
00:11:34,254 --> 00:11:36,587
But I'm the one who wins.

191
00:11:37,421 --> 00:11:40,021
Come, Blade of scarlet, Hizume!

192
00:11:45,187 --> 00:11:46,554
I don't know
her power...

193
00:11:46,654 --> 00:11:48,554
what kind of a
blazer is she, Alice?

194
00:11:48,654 --> 00:11:50,687
There's almost no
information about her‐

195
00:11:50,787 --> 00:11:52,287
and believe me‐
I've been looking.

196
00:11:52,387 --> 00:11:55,554
She didn't enter any of
the official matches
prior to this year‐

197
00:11:55,654 --> 00:11:57,087
so there's no data anywhere.

198
00:11:57,187 --> 00:12:00,087
She's won every battle this year
with nothing but her sword.

199
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:01,887
So nobody's seen
her abilities.

200
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:05,587
That means... whatever kind
of abilities she possesses...

201
00:12:05,687 --> 00:12:08,454
Are a mystery to everyone‐
including Ikki.

202
00:12:10,321 --> 00:12:12,687
Computer:
Let's go ahead.

203
00:12:12,787 --> 00:12:14,787
Whoa! We are off with
a big bang!

204
00:12:14,887 --> 00:12:17,287
Hangetsu:
A swift opener
from Kurogane!

205
00:12:17,387 --> 00:12:18,087
(bell rings)

206
00:12:18,187 --> 00:12:19,054
(slashes through air)

207
00:12:19,154 --> 00:12:21,121
Ugh...

208
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:23,654
Hangetsu:
What on Earth did we
just see, folks?!

209
00:12:23,754 --> 00:12:25,954
Kurogane takes a severe cut
in mid‐air!

210
00:12:26,054 --> 00:12:28,587
And Ayatsuji didn't
even appear to move!

211
00:12:28,687 --> 00:12:31,554
Kurogane is staggered by a
mysterious attack...

212
00:12:31,654 --> 00:12:35,021
Trying to recover from what had
to be a devastating blow!

213
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,221
(bell rings)

214
00:12:36,321 --> 00:12:38,287
Ahh! Nngh...

215
00:12:38,387 --> 00:12:41,121
Hangetsu:
Oh! An attack from behind?!

216
00:12:41,221 --> 00:12:42,721
Big Brother‐ No!

217
00:12:45,887 --> 00:12:47,521
My Noble Art...

218
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:51,121
"Mark of the Wind."
What do you think of it?

219
00:12:51,221 --> 00:12:53,854
It does seem...
pretty effective...

220
00:12:59,854 --> 00:13:01,821
Cutting you with the Mark of the
Wind...

221
00:13:01,921 --> 00:13:04,921
That's the ability of my
device, Hizume.

222
00:13:05,021 --> 00:13:09,221
I think... she's placing traps
somehow with her device...

223
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:12,387
Then triggering them
when I pass through...

224
00:13:17,721 --> 00:13:20,854
Ayase:
I made plenty of cuts in the air
before we got here.

225
00:13:20,954 --> 00:13:24,754
All I have to do
is activate whichever one
is closest to him...

226
00:13:24,854 --> 00:13:28,287
and a vacuum blade
releases a whirlwind attack.

227
00:13:28,387 --> 00:13:31,454
Ikki:
Then she's already pre‐loaded
the entire field...

228
00:13:31,554 --> 00:13:34,187
With enough sword‐slices to
cut him to shreds.

229
00:13:34,287 --> 00:13:36,054
There's nowhere you can run!

230
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:40,821
If she is planting these traps
before the match...

231
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:43,421
that is industrious‐
but it's illegal...

232
00:13:43,521 --> 00:13:45,921
If that's what she did‐
they're gonna figure it out...

233
00:13:46,021 --> 00:13:47,621
the match will be forfeit...

234
00:13:47,721 --> 00:13:49,654
and my Big Brother will win...

235
00:13:52,687 --> 00:13:54,954
Ayase:
Good. Yuri hasn't noticed yet.

236
00:13:55,054 --> 00:13:56,454
How about Kurogane?

237
00:14:00,087 --> 00:14:01,421
Not yet.

238
00:14:02,621 --> 00:14:04,121
What the...?!

239
00:14:04,221 --> 00:14:06,387
Is he figuring out my traps?

240
00:14:06,487 --> 00:14:09,687
He can't be sure yet.
So before he is...

241
00:14:13,821 --> 00:14:14,754
(bell rings)

242
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,954
Gah... Ahh!

243
00:14:17,054 --> 00:14:20,854
Hangetsu:
Another hit! And Kurogane
is brought to his knees!

244
00:14:20,954 --> 00:14:23,021
But we still haven't
seen the attack!

245
00:14:23,121 --> 00:14:26,221
It looks as though these wounds
are opening all by themselves!

246
00:14:26,321 --> 00:14:28,887
Ikki:
That was...
also her...

247
00:14:30,654 --> 00:14:33,787
I used my ability
to open that wound.

248
00:14:33,887 --> 00:14:38,121
Using that tiny cut I made with
Hizume just a moment before.

249
00:14:38,221 --> 00:14:39,654
I've got him...!

250
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,221
If she hits me
in the wrong place,

251
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:43,487
I could wind up
dead out here!

252
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:49,721
And Ayatsuji unleashes an
aggressive assault...!

253
00:14:49,821 --> 00:14:52,954
Hangetsu:
putting Kurogane
on the defensive!

254
00:14:58,387 --> 00:15:01,687
Kurogane...
I'm sorry...

255
00:15:03,887 --> 00:15:05,521
Big Brother!

256
00:15:15,987 --> 00:15:17,254
You tricked me!

257
00:15:17,354 --> 00:15:19,154
His "irregular
guarding" technique!

258
00:15:19,254 --> 00:15:20,554
She can't
beat it!

259
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:23,187
He is more impregnable‐
the closer you get...

260
00:15:23,287 --> 00:15:24,787
That's true...

261
00:15:28,187 --> 00:15:29,854
Ikki:
Good.

262
00:15:31,687 --> 00:15:33,354
I'm happy to
see that...

263
00:15:33,454 --> 00:15:35,721
that you really are
who I thought you were.

264
00:15:35,821 --> 00:15:37,087
Huh?

265
00:15:42,854 --> 00:15:45,721
Yuri:
What is it I can do
for you, Mr. Kurogane?

266
00:15:45,821 --> 00:15:47,921
Ikki:
Ma'am...
Miss Yuri...

267
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:50,887
I think that Miss Ayatsuji
is going to break the rules....

268
00:15:50,987 --> 00:15:53,087
Bleeeeeghhhhh!

269
00:15:53,187 --> 00:15:53,987
Are you sure?

270
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:56,187
Then... as soon as we
spot it we can stop
the match immediately.

271
00:15:56,287 --> 00:15:57,487
No.
Then... as soon as we
spot it we can stop
the match immediately.

272
00:15:57,587 --> 00:16:00,487
Please don't. I'd like for
you to overlook the violation.

273
00:16:00,587 --> 00:16:02,187
Bleeeeeghhhhh!

274
00:16:02,287 --> 00:16:04,354
What?! Why, Ikki?

275
00:16:04,454 --> 00:16:07,587
If Miss Ayatsuji really
is violating a rule,

276
00:16:07,687 --> 00:16:10,521
then the match will
be forfeit and you'll be
declared the winner.

277
00:16:10,621 --> 00:16:15,421
You're perfectly aware how
important each selection match
is, aren't you‐ Mr. Kurogoane?

278
00:16:15,521 --> 00:16:16,621
Ikki:
Yes...

279
00:16:16,721 --> 00:16:18,521
If I lose even
one match...

280
00:16:18,621 --> 00:16:21,087
I probably won't be going
to the Seven Star...

281
00:16:21,187 --> 00:16:23,021
Yuri:
And even so,
you want...

282
00:16:23,121 --> 00:16:25,754
Yes Miss Yuri.
I do.

283
00:16:26,854 --> 00:16:29,754
Can you at least
tell me why Ikki?

284
00:16:31,954 --> 00:16:33,054
I wanna believe.

285
00:16:33,154 --> 00:16:35,221
...to believe...
what...?

286
00:16:35,321 --> 00:16:37,654
If I end my friendship
with Ayatsuji...

287
00:16:37,754 --> 00:16:41,121
that would be just
like losing the match.

288
00:16:41,221 --> 00:16:43,354
Is beating her
that important?

289
00:16:43,454 --> 00:16:44,754
I've thought about
it a lot lately

290
00:16:44,854 --> 00:16:46,954
and I still don't
have an answer.

291
00:16:47,054 --> 00:16:50,221
But... I can answer
something else...

292
00:16:50,321 --> 00:16:51,721
And what is that?

293
00:16:51,821 --> 00:16:55,521
I know... that a really good
friend can be hard to find...

294
00:16:55,621 --> 00:16:57,121
and we have
to hold on to them.

295
00:16:57,221 --> 00:16:59,521
(sighs)
(giggles)

296
00:16:59,621 --> 00:17:03,321
Miss Yuri... can you please
give me one last chance...

297
00:17:03,421 --> 00:17:05,921
to find out
what she really wants?

298
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:10,187
Ayatsuji.

299
00:17:10,287 --> 00:17:11,721
Now‐ your
swordsmanship...

300
00:17:11,821 --> 00:17:13,954
your steps‐ and
your breathing...

301
00:17:14,054 --> 00:17:15,654
They're all out of order.

302
00:17:15,754 --> 00:17:17,587
Not only what I taught you...

303
00:17:17,687 --> 00:17:21,054
you're not even using your
former technique effectively.

304
00:17:21,154 --> 00:17:24,287
You're trying to create
something dark inside you...

305
00:17:24,387 --> 00:17:26,121
But you can't fool your soul.

306
00:17:26,221 --> 00:17:29,987
When your mind is lost,
You can't meet your potential.

307
00:17:30,087 --> 00:17:32,154
Shut up Kurogane!

308
00:17:32,254 --> 00:17:33,454
Ayatsuji.

309
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:35,921
There is so much more
to you than this.

310
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:37,887
Your pride is true...

311
00:17:37,987 --> 00:17:41,954
I can see it in your father's
technique... Ayatsuji Itto‐ryu.

312
00:17:42,054 --> 00:17:43,821
But my mind
is not lost!

313
00:17:43,921 --> 00:17:46,454
I learned the hard way
two years ago...

314
00:17:46,554 --> 00:17:48,887
no matter how much pride
you have in yourself...

315
00:17:48,987 --> 00:17:51,254
it does you no good
at all if you lose.

316
00:17:51,354 --> 00:17:55,187
Pride without strength to back
it up... its meaningless!

317
00:17:55,287 --> 00:17:56,721
So I'll do
whatever it takes!

318
00:17:56,821 --> 00:17:59,254
I will beat you
no matter what...

319
00:17:59,354 --> 00:18:01,721
AND get back
what I lost!

320
00:18:03,854 --> 00:18:06,787
Then there's only one thing
that I can do for you.

321
00:18:06,887 --> 00:18:10,587
Ayatsuji... with all
of my strength...

322
00:18:10,687 --> 00:18:12,687
I will bring back
your pride!

323
00:18:12,787 --> 00:18:14,054
I will WIN!

324
00:18:14,154 --> 00:18:17,854
Ayase... prepare yourself!

325
00:18:17,954 --> 00:18:20,254
Hangetsu:
Kurogane is dashing towards her!

326
00:18:20,354 --> 00:18:22,421
But this is not
Itto Shura!

327
00:18:22,521 --> 00:18:25,254
He doesn't seem to be using
any powers at all!

328
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,687
(bell rings)

329
00:18:30,521 --> 00:18:32,987
Ayase:
He's using his Perfect Vision.

330
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,721
I knew he had it.

331
00:18:35,421 --> 00:18:36,687
I need to be faster...

332
00:18:36,787 --> 00:18:38,454
faster than
his eyes can be...

333
00:18:38,554 --> 00:18:40,521
Or I'll never defeat
the Sword Eater.

334
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:42,654
I can't lose.

335
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:44,854
I cannot give up yet!

336
00:18:46,287 --> 00:18:48,021
Not yet.

337
00:18:48,121 --> 00:18:49,954
This isn't over!

338
00:19:00,721 --> 00:19:04,654
The Fourth Secret
Sword... Shinkiro.

339
00:19:11,687 --> 00:19:13,021
Hangetsu:
He's done it!

340
00:19:13,121 --> 00:19:16,521
Kurogane took her down
with one clean swing!

341
00:19:16,621 --> 00:19:19,321
Well he did it...
but what...?

342
00:19:19,421 --> 00:19:20,854
Right before
he cut her...

343
00:19:20,954 --> 00:19:24,087
he must've switched his
device into phantom form.

344
00:19:24,187 --> 00:19:26,221
Why would he do
something like that?

345
00:19:26,321 --> 00:19:30,521
From the beginning‐
his intention was
to drain her energy.

346
00:19:30,621 --> 00:19:32,121
'Cause his objective...

347
00:19:32,221 --> 00:19:34,821
wasn't just to win the match.

348
00:19:38,454 --> 00:19:41,621
Damn you...
you're holding back!

349
00:19:41,721 --> 00:19:43,321
Yes... I am.

350
00:19:43,421 --> 00:19:45,421
I don't have to hurt you
to beat you now.

351
00:19:45,521 --> 00:19:47,421
Don't insult me!

352
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:51,287
(struggling)

353
00:19:51,387 --> 00:19:53,987
There's no way I'm done
fighting with you yet...

354
00:19:55,387 --> 00:19:57,587
Why can't I move?!

355
00:19:58,387 --> 00:20:01,454
Why?! Why...?

356
00:20:02,854 --> 00:20:06,287
When we're on the edge,
and have nowhere to go...

357
00:20:06,387 --> 00:20:08,521
The only thing that
can support us...

358
00:20:08,621 --> 00:20:11,021
is the pride we have
in our swords.

359
00:20:12,321 --> 00:20:14,287
What's happened
to yours?

360
00:20:14,387 --> 00:20:16,954
Where have you
hidden it Ayase?

361
00:20:20,454 --> 00:20:21,854
It's gone...

362
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:24,787
I see...

363
00:20:24,887 --> 00:20:26,754
I can see it now...

364
00:20:26,854 --> 00:20:29,921
I've been deceiving myself
this whole time...

365
00:20:31,421 --> 00:20:34,421
I guess you were right
about me, Ikki.

366
00:20:37,287 --> 00:20:40,821
So I lose...
I'm done.

367
00:20:40,921 --> 00:20:44,721
Hangetsu:
There we have it! Ayase Ayatsuji
has conceded the match!

368
00:20:44,821 --> 00:20:48,187
And another one bites
"Another One's" dust!

369
00:20:48,287 --> 00:20:50,554
Kurogane wins again!

370
00:20:51,254 --> 00:20:53,221
I am so pathetic.

371
00:20:53,321 --> 00:20:58,254
I fought like a coward... and I
couldn't even see that through.

372
00:20:58,354 --> 00:21:00,587
You're not
pathetic, Ayase...

373
00:21:01,921 --> 00:21:06,154
You got hurt, made mistakes,
lost sight...

374
00:21:06,254 --> 00:21:09,487
But you never threw away your
father's Ayatsuji Itto‐ryu.

375
00:21:09,587 --> 00:21:12,354
And that's where your
strength comes from.

376
00:21:12,454 --> 00:21:14,687
(whimpers)

377
00:21:14,787 --> 00:21:18,387
Ayase... I want
to help you...

378
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:20,487
to get back
what you lost...

379
00:21:20,587 --> 00:21:22,721
I want us
to be friends...

380
00:21:23,921 --> 00:21:25,887
Why, Ikki...?

381
00:21:25,987 --> 00:21:27,687
How could you...?

382
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:30,187
After everything
I've done to you...?

383
00:21:30,287 --> 00:21:34,854
So why would you? What reason
could you possibly have?

384
00:21:34,954 --> 00:21:39,021
I'm your friend.
And I don't need a reason...

385
00:21:39,121 --> 00:21:40,821
to help a friend.

386
00:21:44,221 --> 00:21:46,154
I only...

387
00:21:46,254 --> 00:21:49,087
I only...
wanted...

388
00:21:51,554 --> 00:21:56,087
to become... the kind of
swordsman that my father was.

389
00:22:00,587 --> 00:22:02,321
I'm sorry Ikki...

390
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:03,287
(sobbing)

391
00:22:03,387 --> 00:22:05,387
I'm sorry...

392
00:22:06,654 --> 00:22:11,187
Please help me...
I can't do it alone.

393
00:22:11,287 --> 00:22:13,887
Then the two of us
will do it together.
