1
00:00:00,666 --> 00:00:01,400
(battle cry)

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,366
(swords swinging)
(dodging)

3
00:00:04,466 --> 00:00:06,033
(swords clash)

4
00:00:08,833 --> 00:00:09,433
(battle cry)

5
00:00:09,533 --> 00:00:11,233
(clash)

6
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:11,866
Nice!

7
00:00:11,966 --> 00:00:13,900
Okay‐ Let's
call it quits for now.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,300
(intetsu dissipates)

9
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:17,533
(relieved sigh)

10
00:00:17,633 --> 00:00:18,666
That was
a good bout!

11
00:00:18,766 --> 00:00:21,233
So did you get your
first battle yet?

12
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:24,000
Yeah‐ I just got
the email from ad‐min.

13
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,600
I'm fighting Momotani‐
he's a junior.

14
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,500
Oh...

15
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,966
Yeah‐ I've seen him
in a fight before.

16
00:00:30,066 --> 00:00:32,033
His device is a
rare armor‐type, and...

17
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:33,266
Stop right there.

18
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,200
I do not want to hear
another word about it‐

19
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,566
thank you very much.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,433
You don't‐ really?

21
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:40,300
Nope!

22
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,833
I don't wanna
know a thing...

23
00:00:41,933 --> 00:00:45,000
Battles like this are supposed
to be training for the future...

24
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,800
when I end up fighting
blazers I've never met.

25
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:48,700
Ikki:
I see.

26
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,333
And of course you won't always
know what their abilities are...

27
00:00:52,766 --> 00:00:53,600
Exactly!

28
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,500
I also think it's important
to research your opponent
[just] like you do.

29
00:00:58,433 --> 00:00:59,433
(chuckles)

30
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:00,733
Mm...

31
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:02,133
What's so funny?

32
00:01:02,233 --> 00:01:04,100
It's just strange...

33
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,100
You and I are so
different...

34
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,400
but we get along
really well.

35
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,366
O‐oh...

36
00:01:10,466 --> 00:01:11,766
Mm!

37
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:14,666
Uh...
(nervous laugh)

38
00:01:14,766 --> 00:01:16,933
(school bell rings)

39
00:01:17,033 --> 00:01:19,500
First bell...
let's go.

40
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,333
Huh? Oh... ahh!

41
00:01:22,433 --> 00:01:23,933
Uh...

42
00:01:24,033 --> 00:01:25,400
(frustrated growl)

43
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,066
Ikki!

44
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,333
Huh?

45
00:01:28,433 --> 00:01:31,733
Isn't umm...
isn't it Friday today?

46
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:32,666
Yeah.

47
00:01:32,766 --> 00:01:33,700
So that means...

48
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,333
tomorrow is Saturday
and the school is out...?

49
00:01:36,433 --> 00:01:37,133
That's right.

50
00:01:37,233 --> 00:01:39,566
Oh, okay... so...

51
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:43,100
SO... MAYBE YOU
AND I COULD...

52
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,100
Uh... I mean...
umm...

53
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,533
We could...

54
00:01:47,366 --> 00:01:49,300
Uhh... could
go an a d...

55
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,366
Aaah!
(cell phone ringing)

56
00:01:53,874 --> 00:01:55,531
Oh! I'm sorry‐ that's me...

57
00:01:55,841 --> 00:01:56,508
Is it about
your opponent?
(cell phone beeps)

58
00:01:56,608 --> 00:01:58,274
Is it about
your opponent?

59
00:02:00,441 --> 00:02:02,408
Stella & Ikki:
Oh...

60
00:02:02,508 --> 00:02:04,041
SHIZUKU!

61
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:05,841
(cell phone beeping)

62
00:02:05,941 --> 00:02:06,608
Huh?

63
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:10,808
"Okay... I will see...
you then..." and send.

64
00:02:12,974 --> 00:02:16,608
Oooh.... ahhhh!

65
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:17,841
Stella:
OH, COME ON!

66
00:02:17,941 --> 00:02:19,074
Stella:
OH, COME ON!
Ikki:
Huh? What? what?!

67
00:02:19,174 --> 00:02:20,608
Ikki:
Huh? What? what?!

68
00:03:54,308 --> 00:03:56,174
(giggles)

69
00:03:56,274 --> 00:03:58,341
(pouty snarl)

70
00:03:58,441 --> 00:04:00,374
This is such
a surprise!

71
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:01,574
Who would ever have imagined

72
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:04,641
that such a noble and refined
princess as Her Highness...

73
00:04:04,741 --> 00:04:08,274
would deign to join my
brother and me for our
private leisure...

74
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:10,974
When I told him I wanted
to learn more about Japan‐

75
00:04:11,074 --> 00:04:12,874
he invited me
to tag along...

76
00:04:12,974 --> 00:04:15,074
He is a gracious
master‐ MY Ikki.

77
00:04:15,174 --> 00:04:15,974
(embarrassed laugh)

78
00:04:16,074 --> 00:04:17,841
Perhaps it would
be wise‐ Princess...

79
00:04:17,941 --> 00:04:21,041
for you to go back home
and practice reading
between the lines.

80
00:04:21,141 --> 00:04:22,841
Oh‐ I can read
between these lines.

81
00:04:22,941 --> 00:04:25,341
And I will not allow my
master to endanger himself

82
00:04:25,441 --> 00:04:27,841
by being alone with
his freakishly obsessive sister.

83
00:04:27,941 --> 00:04:29,041
Hmph!
Hmph!

84
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:32,274
Hi‐ uh... We haven't
been introduced...

85
00:04:32,374 --> 00:04:34,441
Shizuku asked me
to accompany her.

86
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,741
I am her new roommate.
Nagi Arisuin.

87
00:04:37,841 --> 00:04:39,908
Just all
me Alice.

88
00:04:40,008 --> 00:04:41,508
Alice?

89
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:43,941
Oh, my!

90
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,041
Did I just get
a "once‐over"?

91
00:04:46,141 --> 00:04:48,141
You are going to be
trouble, aren't you?

92
00:04:48,241 --> 00:04:49,541
Mmm...
Oh, sorry.

93
00:04:49,641 --> 00:04:53,141
Mmm...
But, I mean...
you're a guy‐ aren't you?

94
00:04:53,241 --> 00:04:55,141
Mmm...
Well‐ clinically,
I suppose...

95
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:56,441
Mmm...
But rest assured....

96
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:57,641
Mmm...
I've the heart
of a maiden.

97
00:04:57,741 --> 00:05:01,341
Mmm...!
Well‐ I... I don't know what I'm
supposed to rest assured of...

98
00:05:01,441 --> 00:05:04,608
Mmm...!
(chuckles)
You are adorably
serious...

99
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:07,508
You know... I think
that's wonderful.

100
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:10,608
Maybe I should try
to seduce you...

101
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:11,541
Ooh!

102
00:05:11,641 --> 00:05:11,974
(glass breaks)

103
00:05:12,074 --> 00:05:13,808
(splash)
Mmm...

104
00:05:13,908 --> 00:05:15,074
Just joking!
Just a joke!

105
00:05:15,174 --> 00:05:16,441
You can stand
down, honey!

106
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:19,708
Shizuku! Put that away‐
you're going to get in trouble!

107
00:05:19,808 --> 00:05:24,274
(train rolling)

108
00:05:28,574 --> 00:05:33,708
Wow! The shopping
malls here are amazing!

109
00:05:33,808 --> 00:05:37,174
Shizuku, you're pretty dressed
up for the mall today, aren't
you?

110
00:05:37,274 --> 00:05:40,841
Yes!.. Alice coordinated
this whole outfit for me!

111
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:42,241
Huh?!

112
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,074
Oh.My.God,
Shizuku!

113
00:05:44,174 --> 00:05:45,774
Stop holding
your brother's hand!

114
00:05:45,874 --> 00:05:46,641
What's wrong
with that?

115
00:05:46,741 --> 00:05:50,974
It's a perfectly ordinary
show of affection
between siblings.

116
00:05:51,074 --> 00:05:51,808
My big brother...

117
00:05:51,908 --> 00:05:55,474
has always held my hand when
we're walking... haven't you?

118
00:05:55,574 --> 00:05:56,608
(laughs)

119
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:57,908
Yeah, I suppose I have.

120
00:05:58,008 --> 00:06:00,808
Well... then I guess
I should too...

121
00:06:00,908 --> 00:06:01,574
Shizuku:
Really?

122
00:06:01,674 --> 00:06:01,974
Huh?

123
00:06:02,074 --> 00:06:03,374
Doesn't that
seem like it's a little

124
00:06:03,474 --> 00:06:05,141
inappropriate
for a servant?

125
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:06,508
Ugh...

126
00:06:06,608 --> 00:06:07,541
But, of course...

127
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:09,574
if he allows
it‐ it's all right.

128
00:06:09,674 --> 00:06:13,441
Oh but... a simple servant
holding her master's hand...

129
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:17,008
seems to indicate some very
un‐servant‐like feelings.

130
00:06:17,108 --> 00:06:18,574
OH MY IS IT POSSIBLE?!

131
00:06:18,674 --> 00:06:19,741
(embarrassed growl)

132
00:06:19,841 --> 00:06:21,208
NO, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE!

133
00:06:21,308 --> 00:06:24,441
HE IS MY MASTER!
And I'm simply his servant.

134
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:27,308
Then you have no reason
to hold his hand, do you? Hmph.

135
00:06:27,408 --> 00:06:29,908
So, my big brother,
shall we go?

136
00:06:30,008 --> 00:06:31,408
Uh, yeah...

137
00:06:31,508 --> 00:06:35,111
Shizuku:
Oooh, I know! Let's go
get something to eat!

138
00:06:35,824 --> 00:06:36,280
(growls)
Ikki:
I could go
for anything...

139
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,514
(growls)
Then please
go for me!

140
00:06:37,614 --> 00:06:39,180
(growls)
The food court's
this way...

141
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,180
(pouty grunt)

142
00:06:41,705 --> 00:06:42,121
Stupid Ikki!
You pervert!

143
00:06:42,824 --> 00:06:43,450
You idiot! Such a stupid...
perverted... idiotic...So gross!

144
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:47,084
THERE we go now...
Let it all out, honey...
You idiot! Such a stupid...
perverted... idiotic...So gross!

145
00:06:47,184 --> 00:06:48,484
You idiot! Such a stupid...
perverted... idiotic...So gross!

146
00:06:50,027 --> 00:06:52,229
Hey, man. You about ready
to switch out?

147
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,563
Oh yeah, She's all
yours. Great...!

148
00:06:54,663 --> 00:06:55,129
(door kicked)

149
00:06:55,229 --> 00:06:56,063
Huh!

150
00:06:56,163 --> 00:06:58,763
Wow! This stuff is delicious!

151
00:06:58,863 --> 00:06:59,596
(noms)

152
00:06:59,696 --> 00:07:00,596
Mmmm!

153
00:07:00,696 --> 00:07:01,696
I know‐ isn't it?

154
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,463
The cream is so rich
and still so delicate...

155
00:07:04,563 --> 00:07:05,563
Well good!

156
00:07:05,663 --> 00:07:07,829
This place is such
a lovely little gem,

157
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:09,363
I'm glad
you like it!

158
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:10,896
Although,
for ice cream,

159
00:07:10,996 --> 00:07:13,429
might I recommend a spot
up on the third floor...?

160
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:15,696
You seem to know
a lot of places...

161
00:07:15,796 --> 00:07:18,863
When it comes to delicious
sweets and keen fashion sense...

162
00:07:18,963 --> 00:07:21,963
no one in the world can
beat my roommate... Right?

163
00:07:22,063 --> 00:07:24,529
Alice:
(chuckles)
It's what I live for.

164
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:26,029
Oh, Shizuku.

165
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:27,229
Huh?

166
00:07:27,329 --> 00:07:28,863
Oh...! Huh?

167
00:07:30,187 --> 00:07:31,082
Stella:
Ah!

168
00:07:31,182 --> 00:07:31,682
Stella:
Ah!
Don't want to get anything on
your pretty dress, do you ?

169
00:07:31,782 --> 00:07:33,816
Don't want to get anything on
your pretty dress, do you ?

170
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,316
Oh...!
Ikki:
There ya go.

171
00:07:36,485 --> 00:07:37,165
Oh my.

172
00:07:37,265 --> 00:07:39,465
I guess there's no
defensive power you can use

173
00:07:39,565 --> 00:07:40,865
against that‐ is there?

174
00:07:40,965 --> 00:07:42,599
Oh shut up, Alice!

175
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:43,699
It's not a big deal‐

176
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:45,599
Shizuku:
he just took me by
surprise is all‐

177
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,499
I wasn't expecting him
to reach out and...

178
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:48,765
Huh? Ooh!

179
00:07:48,865 --> 00:07:51,332
What? Oh hey‐ do I have
something on my face?

180
00:07:51,432 --> 00:07:53,832
How does that happen
without you even noticing?!

181
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:55,999
Well‐ if there's
anything on my face,

182
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:56,999
you can just
take it off

183
00:07:57,099 --> 00:07:59,065
like you did
for your sister, right?

184
00:07:59,165 --> 00:08:02,599
Yeah but... this is
a whole different level...

185
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:04,865
I'm gonna go
find you a towel...

186
00:08:05,053 --> 00:08:06,403
Ahh!

187
00:08:06,503 --> 00:08:07,932
Stella:
No‐ wait, Ikki!

188
00:08:08,204 --> 00:08:09,411
Miss Stella...

189
00:08:09,411 --> 00:08:11,504
Were you dropped on
your head a lot as a child?

190
00:08:11,504 --> 00:08:14,546
(chuckles) Oh honey‐
you are just precious!

191
00:08:14,646 --> 00:08:16,680
Alice:
I mean it‐ I am
rooting for you.

192
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,980
Oh just... Shut up. Hmph!

193
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,280
(footsteps)

194
00:08:25,913 --> 00:08:26,580
(water running)

195
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,646
I have to say‐
I'm surprised.

196
00:08:28,746 --> 00:08:32,180
Shizuku doesn't... well‐
she doesn't open up very easily.

197
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,446
Doesn't she? Well that
isn't such a surprise.

198
00:08:38,546 --> 00:08:43,346
She's very sensitive... and
usually shy around new people.

199
00:08:43,446 --> 00:08:45,213
Ikki:
Especially men.

200
00:08:45,313 --> 00:08:47,380
Alice:
Darling, I am no man.

201
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,880
Heh... Well, I know that
you're a good friend you...

202
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,046
obviously mean a
lot to her. Thank you.

203
00:08:54,146 --> 00:08:55,680
Uh? Heh...

204
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:59,246
And you are exactly as your
sister describes you.

205
00:08:59,346 --> 00:09:02,713
Very strong,
and exceedingly kind...

206
00:09:02,813 --> 00:09:04,146
However...

207
00:09:04,246 --> 00:09:06,546
That is exactly why you...

208
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,013
Huh?

209
00:09:08,113 --> 00:09:11,646
Oh, don't mind me.
Shall we‐ then?

210
00:09:11,746 --> 00:09:12,846
(footsteps)

211
00:09:12,946 --> 00:09:14,113
Uh...

212
00:09:14,213 --> 00:09:16,613
What's wrong... Mmm!

213
00:09:16,713 --> 00:09:18,946
Yakin:
Man, what a
pain in the ass...

214
00:09:19,046 --> 00:09:22,546
Thug:
It's Bisho's order.
We gotta do it right.

215
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:25,946
Yeah I know... but damn!

216
00:09:26,046 --> 00:09:29,246
So what if there are a couple of
dudes hiding in here?!

217
00:09:29,346 --> 00:09:30,813
(gunshots)
(glass shattering)

218
00:09:30,913 --> 00:09:32,546
Cool it! Knock it off!

219
00:09:32,646 --> 00:09:35,513
The boss told us to take
anybody we found hostage!

220
00:09:35,613 --> 00:09:37,913
Yeah...
I hear ya, man!

221
00:09:38,013 --> 00:09:38,846
But check it out...!

222
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:42,213
Yakin:
We just found out
there was no one in here!

223
00:09:42,313 --> 00:09:44,046
Thug:
Jesus...

224
00:09:44,146 --> 00:09:45,680
(door closes)

225
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,913
Who are these people?

226
00:10:00,013 --> 00:10:03,046
Well at the very least‐
we know they're not friendly.

227
00:10:03,146 --> 00:10:05,213
It's possible
that by now...

228
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,246
They've taken
the mall...

229
00:10:07,346 --> 00:10:10,280
Exactly.
Wanna go find out?

230
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,780
I've never seen
your device before...

231
00:10:21,213 --> 00:10:22,380
Well...

232
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,613
Alice:
Meet the Hermit of Darkness.

233
00:10:24,713 --> 00:10:27,380
I can control
shadows with this.

234
00:10:29,746 --> 00:10:32,580
And I can also
use shadows to travel.

235
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,346
Alice:
Let's go. I'm worried
about the girls.

236
00:10:35,446 --> 00:10:36,813
Ikki:
Yeah...

237
00:10:39,646 --> 00:10:42,713
Stella...
Shizuku...

238
00:10:50,246 --> 00:10:54,646
(relieved sigh)
They'll be all right‐
they've just been anesthetized.

239
00:10:54,746 --> 00:10:57,880
Really... It's already
on the news?

240
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,713
Kurono:
Yes. Someone escaped
and called the police.

241
00:11:01,813 --> 00:11:04,446
They've already got
the mall surrounded.

242
00:11:04,546 --> 00:11:06,846
Ikki:
Do we know
who these guys are?

243
00:11:06,946 --> 00:11:09,613
A crime organization led
by a rogue blazer...

244
00:11:09,713 --> 00:11:11,946
They've asked for
an insane ransom...

245
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,313
Ikki:
(sigh)

246
00:11:13,413 --> 00:11:14,613
If money is what they want,

247
00:11:14,713 --> 00:11:17,180
there's gotta be an easier
way than this...

248
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,913
Kurono:
It's not about the money.

249
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:20,646
It never is with guys like this.

250
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:23,913
These cowards want to control
people... by making them afraid.

251
00:11:24,013 --> 00:11:26,080
The police have requested
our assistance.

252
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,813
I'm giving the four of you
special authorization

253
00:11:28,913 --> 00:11:31,946
off of school grounds...
to utilize your devices.

254
00:11:32,046 --> 00:11:34,680
(computer beeping)

255
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,980
We won't let
you down... Director.

256
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,613
Kurono:
I'm counting on you...
don't be reckless.

257
00:11:42,713 --> 00:11:43,646
Right!

258
00:11:49,613 --> 00:11:51,813
Yakin:
Hey you! C'mere.

259
00:11:51,913 --> 00:11:54,513
They're taking women
and children hostage...

260
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:55,813
They're despicable.

261
00:11:55,913 --> 00:11:58,646
I have a plan,
but I need some time...

262
00:11:58,746 --> 00:12:00,946
Whatever you do
don't attract attention

263
00:12:01,046 --> 00:12:02,646
until I'm ready,
all right?

264
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,080
I'll do my best.

265
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,313
Mother:
Please‐ I'm begging you!

266
00:12:06,413 --> 00:12:08,280
Just don't hurt
my child, please!

267
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,646
Get back on your knees
and shut up‐ bitch!

268
00:12:10,746 --> 00:12:11,613
Uhh!

269
00:12:11,713 --> 00:12:13,413
Child:
Don't hurt my mommy!

270
00:12:13,513 --> 00:12:16,313
Child:
(struggles)

271
00:12:18,013 --> 00:12:19,880
Stupid little shit!

272
00:12:20,246 --> 00:12:20,913
Uhh!

273
00:12:21,013 --> 00:12:23,880
Momma shoulda taught
you manners‐ boy.

274
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,046
Mother:
No! NO PLEASE DON'T!

275
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:28,246
So now I WILL!

276
00:12:28,346 --> 00:12:30,080
(dragon roars)

277
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,613
(bullets singe)

278
00:12:31,713 --> 00:12:32,113
(growls)

279
00:12:32,213 --> 00:12:35,346
(flames dissipate)

280
00:12:38,413 --> 00:12:40,646
Well, shit! We got us
a blazer!

281
00:12:40,746 --> 00:12:41,046
Nice try...

282
00:12:41,146 --> 00:12:44,980
But bullets are not really
effective against my
Empress Dress.

283
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,380
Yeah, We'll see!

284
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,580
I am not going to waste
my time with you...

285
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,880
Where's your boss
hiding tough guy?

286
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,446
You got a mouth on you‐ huh?
Eat lead, bitch!

287
00:12:54,546 --> 00:12:56,713
Hold your fire... Yakin!

288
00:12:56,813 --> 00:12:58,380
Yakin:
(gasp)

289
00:13:02,013 --> 00:13:07,180
Well, well! If it isn't the
second princess of the
Vermillion Empire!

290
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,946
It is an honor
to meet you.

291
00:13:10,046 --> 00:13:11,880
And you must
be the boss.

292
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,780
That is correct.

293
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,013
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

294
00:13:15,113 --> 00:13:16,713
I am Bisho.

295
00:13:16,813 --> 00:13:19,646
You idiot! Were
my instructions not clear?

296
00:13:19,746 --> 00:13:22,446
You were specifically
told not to touch the hostages!

297
00:13:22,546 --> 00:13:24,046
Boss...
I'm sorry...

298
00:13:24,146 --> 00:13:25,346
But that
little bastard

299
00:13:25,446 --> 00:13:27,413
threw an ice cream
cone at my head!

300
00:13:27,513 --> 00:13:30,946
What?! And for that
you try to shoot the boy?!

301
00:13:31,046 --> 00:13:31,946
Heh...

302
00:13:32,046 --> 00:13:34,313
No...

303
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:37,280
You have been horribly
affronted, Yakin.

304
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,280
Uh‐Yeah.

305
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:42,246
Bisho:
But honestly now,

306
00:13:42,346 --> 00:13:46,946
you cannot blame
a child for the failures
of his parents, can you?

307
00:13:47,046 --> 00:13:48,180
(gasp)

308
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,446
Don't you dare!

309
00:13:49,546 --> 00:13:51,313
Punishment
follows crime.

310
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,113
Forgiveness
follows punishment.

311
00:13:53,213 --> 00:13:53,746
That's my Motto.

312
00:13:53,846 --> 00:13:58,746
And this woman...
has been negligent in
disciplining her child...
(panicked breathing)

313
00:13:58,846 --> 00:14:01,046
And for that
you'll die...

314
00:14:01,146 --> 00:14:02,346
Good night, "Mommy."

315
00:14:02,446 --> 00:14:05,446
Serve my will, Laevatein.

316
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:06,946
Heh, heh...

317
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:07,546
It's a trap!

318
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:10,180
But I will burn
right through it!

319
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,013
Judgment Ring!

320
00:14:12,113 --> 00:14:13,280
(gasp)
(sword clangs)

321
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,080
What the...?!

322
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,413
Such strength,
and such speed!

323
00:14:17,513 --> 00:14:19,213
But neither will
help you now...

324
00:14:19,313 --> 00:14:22,513
The real world is big
and scary‐ child!

325
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:24,380
(explosive impact)

326
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,546
(pained gasp)

327
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,046
(pained groans)

328
00:14:30,146 --> 00:14:32,113
This is my device‐ girl.

329
00:14:32,213 --> 00:14:34,280
It is called "Judgment Ring."

330
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,613
It is the circle of
crime and punishment.

331
00:14:37,713 --> 00:14:41,913
The left ring absorbs
the power of your criminal
attacks upon me...

332
00:14:42,013 --> 00:14:46,480
...and the right ring
releases that power
as punishment.

333
00:14:48,413 --> 00:14:50,846
So... You just hit me...

334
00:14:50,946 --> 00:14:53,413
Stella:
with a reflection of
my own full power...

335
00:14:53,513 --> 00:14:55,680
Ha! I like
this girl!

336
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,480
Bisho:
Such a noble
creature,

337
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:01,180
to risk her own safety
for the "commoners!"

338
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,946
I respect your
courage, Princess.

339
00:15:03,046 --> 00:15:06,513
So perhaps I'll give you a
chance to save their lives.

340
00:15:07,413 --> 00:15:08,580
How then?

341
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,280
You may take his place,
and beg forgivness from me.

342
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,080
(excited inhale)

343
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,013
AND REMOVE
YOUR CLOTHING!

344
00:15:15,113 --> 00:15:17,913
Bisho:
(cackle)

345
00:15:18,013 --> 00:15:20,180
Son of a bitch!

346
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,980
Stay calm‐ love.
It's not time yet...

347
00:15:42,246 --> 00:15:44,546
(chuckles)
This is awesome!

348
00:15:44,646 --> 00:15:46,880
Yeah take
it all off!

349
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,313
Heh, heh. Looks like our little
princess has nerves of steel.

350
00:16:00,413 --> 00:16:03,646
But let's hurry it up now‐
alright my dear?

351
00:16:07,713 --> 00:16:09,746
Ikki:
(frustrated breathing)

352
00:16:09,846 --> 00:16:11,813
(sword clanging)

353
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,813
Alice:
Shadow Bind.

354
00:16:14,913 --> 00:16:18,746
I've held you by your
own shadow... I'm sorry.

355
00:16:18,846 --> 00:16:21,813
Alice...
let me go!

356
00:16:21,913 --> 00:16:25,680
Shizuku's facility with magic
is the best in school.

357
00:16:27,313 --> 00:16:29,846
You must trust
your sister.

358
00:16:29,946 --> 00:16:31,613
Alice:
While Stella has had
them distracted,

359
00:16:31,713 --> 00:16:34,746
she's been creating
a magical barrier.

360
00:16:41,113 --> 00:16:44,846
SHOHA SUIREN!

361
00:16:44,946 --> 00:16:47,413
(water falling)

362
00:16:47,513 --> 00:16:50,013
Bisho:
Shit! There's another
blazer in here!

363
00:16:50,113 --> 00:16:53,213
All bets are off now, boys‐
kill 'em all! Do it!

364
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:55,646
Yee‐haw!

365
00:16:59,046 --> 00:17:02,513
I leave the rest
to you now... Big Brother.

366
00:17:02,613 --> 00:17:04,213
Ikki:
Come to me, Intetsu.

367
00:17:04,313 --> 00:17:06,746
Christ...
they're everywhere.

368
00:17:18,713 --> 00:17:20,413
Itto Shura.

369
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,813
Right now, I don't
need to see in color.

370
00:17:24,913 --> 00:17:26,713
I'll repurpose
those receptors...

371
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:28,946
...to see only
what is necessary.

372
00:17:29,046 --> 00:17:31,113
Ikki:
If I attack him
on his left...

373
00:17:31,213 --> 00:17:33,080
he'll turn it
against me...

374
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,613
RIGHT THEN!

375
00:17:51,846 --> 00:17:53,413
(blood gushing)

376
00:17:53,513 --> 00:17:56,013
Seventh Secret Sword. Raiko!

377
00:17:56,113 --> 00:17:57,646
(whailing in pain)

378
00:17:57,746 --> 00:18:00,280
If my sword is faster
than your "judgment,"

379
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,913
then you cannot use
it against me.

380
00:18:03,013 --> 00:18:05,746
You took... my hand!

381
00:18:05,846 --> 00:18:08,446
You should consider yourself
very fortunate...

382
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:09,880
that's the
only thing I took.

383
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,380
YOU...
BASTARD...!

384
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,613
I think... your little
show is over‐ honey.

385
00:18:17,713 --> 00:18:23,113
YOU THINK SO HUH? BOYS!
KILL 'EM ALL! DO IT NOW!

386
00:18:23,213 --> 00:18:23,980
Huh?

387
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,913
Mm.

388
00:18:34,253 --> 00:18:37,542
Alice:
Oh look! They're all so much
cuter when they're sleeping.

389
00:18:38,842 --> 00:18:40,342
Ikki:
Stella! Stella!

390
00:18:40,442 --> 00:18:44,209
What... I... Oh, my Goodness...
what's wrong, Ikki?

391
00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:47,209
Ikki:
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry!

392
00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:49,709
Ikki...

393
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:51,009
Well good Lord...

394
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:53,309
That was awfully
hasty of you...

395
00:18:53,409 --> 00:18:56,376
running into the middle
of a fight like that.

396
00:18:56,476 --> 00:19:00,109
Although... it was also
decidedly badass...

397
00:19:00,209 --> 00:19:04,109
You too.
You protected everyone...

398
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:05,564
Heh. Ugh...

399
00:19:05,564 --> 00:19:06,132
Ikki!
Oh, Big Brother!

400
00:19:06,232 --> 00:19:08,999
I'm alright... I'm just
a little drained...

401
00:19:09,099 --> 00:19:10,765
Woman:
(screaming)

402
00:19:10,865 --> 00:19:14,299
Female thug:
Nobody move!... If you
do anything stupid...

403
00:19:14,399 --> 00:19:16,032
I'll kill her.

404
00:19:16,132 --> 00:19:17,865
Is she
one of them?

405
00:19:17,965 --> 00:19:20,999
You are not the only ones
smart enough to hide yourselves

406
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:22,199
among the
hostages.

407
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:23,632
You poor
fools!

408
00:19:23,732 --> 00:19:27,232
Female thug:
Listen up! You better
let Bisho go...

409
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,332
Or the bitch dies!

410
00:19:28,432 --> 00:19:31,432
Please, no!
Someone help me!

411
00:19:34,165 --> 00:19:36,132
Pierce them... Oborozuki!

412
00:19:36,232 --> 00:19:37,665
(pained cry)

413
00:19:37,765 --> 00:19:39,699
Uh... ahh!

414
00:19:44,032 --> 00:19:45,165
What...
the hell...?

415
00:19:45,265 --> 00:19:47,332
Where did
that come from?

416
00:19:49,399 --> 00:19:51,265
(chuckles)

417
00:19:52,965 --> 00:19:55,399
Kirihara:
I didn't want to
steal your thunder.

418
00:19:55,499 --> 00:19:58,532
That's really not
my style at all.

419
00:19:58,632 --> 00:20:02,365
Flawless camouflage,
I couldn't even sense him...

420
00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:06,832
That's Kirihara...

421
00:20:06,932 --> 00:20:09,532
It's been a while,
Mister Ikki Kurogane...

422
00:20:09,632 --> 00:20:12,599
The faculty actually
let you stay?

423
00:20:12,699 --> 00:20:14,232
(chuckles)

424
00:20:16,065 --> 00:20:18,499
(sirens wailing)

425
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:22,332
Female Student:
Oh, Kirihara! We were
so worried about you!

426
00:20:22,432 --> 00:20:25,332
Ha, ha, ha... I wasn't
in THAT much danger.

427
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,665
But you went and beat
the bad guys, right?

428
00:20:29,065 --> 00:20:30,699
You're sooo
awesome!

429
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,732
Ohmygod I KNOW!
Nope... I really
don't like him.

430
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:36,965
AT least you and I completely
agree about something.

431
00:20:38,032 --> 00:20:41,932
Girls:
(giggling and fawning)

432
00:20:43,732 --> 00:20:44,899
What's up?

433
00:20:44,999 --> 00:20:46,065
Look Kirihara...

434
00:20:46,165 --> 00:20:49,299
Thank you for earlier.
You saved us.

435
00:20:49,399 --> 00:20:51,932
Hey man‐ I'm always happy to
lend a hand to the weak...

436
00:20:52,032 --> 00:20:52,965
Ugh...
Ugh...

437
00:20:53,065 --> 00:20:54,465
So now tell
me something...

438
00:20:54,565 --> 00:20:57,999
Kurogane... are you still
trying to be a magical knight

439
00:20:58,099 --> 00:21:00,399
with that lame
power of yours?

440
00:21:01,665 --> 00:21:04,065
Oh shut up! How about
I shove that smug...

441
00:21:04,165 --> 00:21:06,365
Stella!
It's fine.

442
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:06,765
Mm.

443
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,099
It's not fine!

444
00:21:08,199 --> 00:21:09,832
You arrogant
little prick!

445
00:21:09,932 --> 00:21:13,232
Ikki is ten times the knight
you could ever hope to be!

446
00:21:13,332 --> 00:21:17,832
(growing laughter)

447
00:21:17,932 --> 00:21:20,832
Uh... what... SHUT UP!

448
00:21:22,165 --> 00:21:24,332
Oh this is
funny!

449
00:21:24,432 --> 00:21:29,832
Sounds like you've got
'em all wrapped around your
little finger‐ Kurogane!

450
00:21:29,932 --> 00:21:32,232
But don't you think you should
tell them all the truth?

451
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:36,065
Kirihara:
You know... about how
you turned tail and ran on me

452
00:21:36,165 --> 00:21:39,765
because you didn't want the ass
kicking I was gonna give you?

453
00:21:41,432 --> 00:21:44,832
Oh by the way...
you should check your inbox.

454
00:21:44,932 --> 00:21:46,699
Huh?

455
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:47,832
(cell phone beeps)

456
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:49,332
Uh!

457
00:21:54,865 --> 00:21:58,032
Yeah... guess who's gonna
be your first opponent...

458
00:21:58,132 --> 00:22:02,265
The guy who's already
represented Hagun
at the Seven Star...

459
00:22:02,365 --> 00:22:04,732
Shizuya Kirihara.

460
00:22:04,832 --> 00:22:08,732
You gonna stick around for the
fight this time, Worst One...?

461
00:22:08,832 --> 00:22:11,265
(seething)
