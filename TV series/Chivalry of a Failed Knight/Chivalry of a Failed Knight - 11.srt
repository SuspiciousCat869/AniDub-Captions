1
00:00:02,366 --> 00:00:05,700
Burn it all! Laevatein!

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,633
Ah... ahh! Ahhhhh!

3
00:00:08,733 --> 00:00:10,400
There's the WIN
for Stella!

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,433
Hangetsu:
Now at 14 for 14!

5
00:00:13,533 --> 00:00:13,833
(cheers)

6
00:00:13,933 --> 00:00:15,233
(sighs)

7
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:19,866
(birds chirping)

8
00:00:19,966 --> 00:00:25,400
(stretches)
I feel like I still have plenty
strength left in me today!

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,800
I could almost go
fight another match...

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:28,900
(laughs)

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,800
Maybe I'm building
up stamina...

12
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,000
Because someone I know
has been torturing me
every day since spring.

13
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,800
Wha...? I was not!

14
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,500
Stella:
I'm just kidding.

15
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,800
You remember...
our promise...?

16
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,000
That we'd both
be selected

17
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,300
for the Seven Star
Sword Art Festival?

18
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,300
And fight each other again
at the finals, right?

19
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,766
We can do it...
We just have to stay undefeated.

20
00:00:53,866 --> 00:00:55,133
Together, right?

21
00:00:55,233 --> 00:00:56,466
(giggles)

22
00:01:03,766 --> 00:01:05,166
(camera beeps)

23
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:07,433
(snickers)

24
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:45,066
Kurono:
First of all, congratulations.

25
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,266
Now‐ there's something
I need to ask you...

26
00:02:47,366 --> 00:02:49,133
Do you know a man named Akaza

27
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:51,933
from the International
Federation of Magical Knights?

28
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:53,766
Uh!

29
00:02:53,866 --> 00:02:58,066
Ikki:
Yes. I met him a few times
at my parents' house.

30
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:00,633
He's a member of one of
Kurogane's branch families,

31
00:03:00,733 --> 00:03:04,033
and I believe that he's
working for my father now.

32
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:06,466
Hmmm... The Federation
put him in charge...

33
00:03:06,566 --> 00:03:09,166
of the Japanese Branch
of the Ethics Committee...

34
00:03:09,266 --> 00:03:12,200
and he's been secretly
sniffing around our school.

35
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:14,433
I've met your father...

36
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:17,966
and Itsuki Kurogane is most
certainly a complicated man.

37
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:22,100
But it's really hard to
imagine that he'd resort
to something so underhanded.

38
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:28,400
(frustrated sigh)
I think... Akaza is
likely acting on his own.

39
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,633
He's always hated me and
he's never made it a secret.

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,900
I see.

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,566
Well it sounds like
he just spreads sunshine
everywhere he goes...

42
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:40,333
Director. If I'm causing
any trouble for the school
I'd willingly‐

43
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:45,100
Kurogane... it is a grave error
to underestimate me...

44
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:50,366
And it's my duty as
an educator to protect you.

45
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:56,000
Ikki:
Thank you
very much, Director.

46
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:02,000
Do you have
any idea at all...

47
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,200
why the Student
Council wants us?

48
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,766
Nope... I don't
have a clue...

49
00:04:06,866 --> 00:04:08,733
(door knocking)

50
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,600
Ahhh!
Excuse me...

51
00:04:12,033 --> 00:04:14,100
Ouch ouch ouch...

52
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,166
Hey... Uta!

53
00:04:16,266 --> 00:04:19,266
Would you please put the comics
away after you read them?!

54
00:04:19,366 --> 00:04:20,466
Okay...

55
00:04:20,566 --> 00:04:21,200
And Tomaru‐

56
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,366
I keep telling you to put
your weight training equipment

57
00:04:23,466 --> 00:04:25,333
away when you're
done using it!

58
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:28,333
Yup‐ I'll get
right on that...

59
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:32,433
We're uh... sorry if we're
interrupting anything.

60
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:34,933
Oh! A guest!

61
00:04:35,033 --> 00:04:35,866
Hey, are you...?

62
00:04:35,966 --> 00:04:37,600
Ikki:
Toka Todo?

63
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,100
Yes. I haven't properly
introduced myself to you.

64
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,600
Please forgive my rudeness.

65
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,700
I'm Toka Todo, the president
of the student council.

66
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,766
Uh... hi!

67
00:04:46,866 --> 00:04:48,800
It's very nice
to meet you.

68
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,433
Uh, Miss President...?

69
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:51,466
Yes?

70
00:04:51,566 --> 00:04:54,200
Stella:
Umm... your panties are showing.

71
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,666
Ahhh! Excuse me...

72
00:04:57,766 --> 00:04:59,233
(snickers)

73
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:02,033
Well, well.
That's our president!

74
00:05:02,133 --> 00:05:04,133
She always
putting on a show...

75
00:05:04,233 --> 00:05:05,933
Are you doing it
on purpose?

76
00:05:06,033 --> 00:05:07,200
No, I am certainly not!

77
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,700
Toka:
Why do you have to be such a
crass little monster?!
Well she... she

78
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,033
Utakata:
Old habits die hard,
Miss President!
from... how

79
00:05:12,133 --> 00:05:12,833
Toka:
I thought you
grew out of all this stuff!
Mmm...

80
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:13,366
Toka:
I thought you
grew out of all this stuff!
She's much friendlier

81
00:05:13,466 --> 00:05:14,900
Utakata:
Well I'm workin' on it!
She's much friendlier
than I thought she'd be.

82
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,266
Toka:
Oh you little...!
She's much friendlier
than I thought she'd be.

83
00:05:17,366 --> 00:05:19,500
Little Boy:
It's been forever,
Big Sister Toka!

84
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,533
Little Girl:
How have you been?
We missed you!

85
00:05:23,596 --> 00:05:24,229
(laughs)

86
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:26,229
You guys are
looking well!

87
00:05:26,329 --> 00:05:29,263
Toka and I grew up together
in an orphanage in Fukoaka

88
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:31,129
that was a lot
like this one.

89
00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:35,929
So... we come and visit
the kids here whenever
we're able to make the time.

90
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:37,663
We asked you to come
with us because‐

91
00:05:37,763 --> 00:05:41,596
HEY! I've seen that pretty
red lady over there on TV!

92
00:05:41,696 --> 00:05:44,463
Oh! She's the princess
from another country!

93
00:05:44,563 --> 00:05:46,229
Come on! Play with
us please!

94
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:48,963
(giggles)
Alright then! What would
you guys like to play?

95
00:05:49,063 --> 00:05:49,996
Little Girl 1:
What about kick the can,
big sister?
Perfect!

96
00:05:50,096 --> 00:05:51,029
Little Girl 1:
What about kick the can,
big sister?
I was totally sure the kids

97
00:05:51,129 --> 00:05:52,296
Little Girl 2:
Yeah, yeah! Kick the can!
I was totally sure the kids
would fall absolutely in

98
00:05:52,396 --> 00:05:53,563
Stella:
Alright let's do it!
I was totally sure the kids
would fall absolutely in

99
00:05:53,663 --> 00:05:54,263
Little Girl 1:
Oh my gosh, this is
gonna be awesome!

100
00:05:54,363 --> 00:05:56,429
Little Girl 1:
Oh my gosh, this is
gonna be awesome!
You were right...

101
00:05:56,529 --> 00:05:59,596
(birds chirping)

102
00:05:59,696 --> 00:06:00,096
(children cheering)

103
00:06:00,196 --> 00:06:01,696
Mm‐hm.
(children cheering)

104
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:04,563
Mm‐hm!
Mm‐hm!

105
00:06:05,396 --> 00:06:06,763
Kick the can!
Kick the can!

106
00:06:06,863 --> 00:06:08,063
Yeah!

107
00:06:09,463 --> 00:06:10,629
Um, Miss Todo...

108
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:13,463
we never got much of
a chance to thank you...

109
00:06:13,563 --> 00:06:14,296
What for?

110
00:06:14,396 --> 00:06:16,496
For saving us
back in Okutama.

111
00:06:16,596 --> 00:06:20,296
And for giving my sister...
such a great battle.

112
00:06:20,396 --> 00:06:23,129
Toka:
Oh no, you don't
need to thank me.

113
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:26,029
Your sister was..
really impressive!

114
00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:29,929
She even forced Toka to
take off her stylish glasses...

115
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:33,163
I'm certain you've...
figured it out...?

116
00:06:33,263 --> 00:06:36,896
Yes. It was just my
speculation‐ but you can...

117
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:39,163
increase the accuracy
of your Noble Art...

118
00:06:39,263 --> 00:06:40,896
by blocking your
own vision. Right?

119
00:06:40,996 --> 00:06:43,229
Exactly. I knew
you'd see it.

120
00:06:43,329 --> 00:06:45,396
(chuckles)
(chuckles)

121
00:06:45,496 --> 00:06:48,429
Toka:
Human beings...
are like living computers.

122
00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:52,429
Our brain controls our body
by transmitting signals
across synapses,

123
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:55,863
and these signals are
a weak electrical current.

124
00:06:55,963 --> 00:06:57,363
Since I'm a lightning user,

125
00:06:57,463 --> 00:06:59,529
I can sense that current.

126
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:03,296
That's my Noble Art:
"Reverse Sight."

127
00:07:04,996 --> 00:07:07,196
All of our thoughts
and actions...

128
00:07:07,296 --> 00:07:10,363
they're all there,
within those transmissions...

129
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,063
And when I block my vision,

130
00:07:12,163 --> 00:07:14,563
I can read an opponent's mind.

131
00:07:14,663 --> 00:07:15,563
That's why...

132
00:07:15,663 --> 00:07:18,229
Ikki:
You were able to anticipate
Shizuku's attacks...

133
00:07:18,329 --> 00:07:20,996
because you could
read her impulses...

134
00:07:21,096 --> 00:07:22,596
Is that how it works?

135
00:07:22,696 --> 00:07:24,229
Yes.
Perfect answer.

136
00:07:24,329 --> 00:07:26,029
I'll take care of
the rest of this stuff.

137
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:28,363
You guys can go take
a break if you want.

138
00:07:30,296 --> 00:07:34,396
Rawwwr! Get back here!
I'm gonna getchya!

139
00:07:39,063 --> 00:07:41,363
Kurogane?
Is something wrong...?

140
00:07:41,463 --> 00:07:43,296
I don't know how
to explain this, but...

141
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:46,263
it's like I can't take
my eyes off of Todo...

142
00:07:46,363 --> 00:07:48,196
Utakata:
You're seeing her
real strength...

143
00:07:48,296 --> 00:07:49,729
here with these kids.

144
00:07:49,829 --> 00:07:51,529
This is the core
of who she is..

145
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:54,063
All her lightning
and her "Reverse Sight,"

146
00:07:54,163 --> 00:07:56,529
They're all insignificant,
if you ask me.

147
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:57,629
Uh!

148
00:07:57,729 --> 00:07:59,263
Where Toka
and I grew up...

149
00:07:59,363 --> 00:08:00,929
there were a lot
of very troubled kids‐

150
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:04,063
all with very
complicated stories...

151
00:08:04,163 --> 00:08:07,096
It wasn't...
a very healthy place...

152
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:08,596
Utakata:
There was this one
in particular...

153
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,796
who was really broken
when he got there.

154
00:08:10,896 --> 00:08:12,763
His own parents
had tried to kill him...

155
00:08:12,863 --> 00:08:14,196
and he was full of hate...

156
00:08:14,296 --> 00:08:19,163
He lashed out at Toka
again and again...

157
00:08:19,263 --> 00:08:23,429
and even though he hurt her...
Toka never gave up on him.

158
00:08:24,163 --> 00:08:25,563
Because of her,

159
00:08:25,663 --> 00:08:30,163
that kid was able to let go
of all that rage and
feel Human again.

160
00:08:31,763 --> 00:08:34,496
Heh. She used to... tell me...

161
00:08:34,596 --> 00:08:35,629
I was very fortunate...

162
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:38,263
Because before I ended up
in that situation...

163
00:08:38,363 --> 00:08:41,263
my parents gave me
a lot of love.

164
00:08:41,363 --> 00:08:44,596
And though they're gone,
I still have those memories...

165
00:08:44,696 --> 00:08:46,896
and they will always support me.

166
00:08:46,996 --> 00:08:48,463
I want that...

167
00:08:48,563 --> 00:08:49,429
for other people too.

168
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:53,963
I want to give them memories
that support all of them.

169
00:08:54,063 --> 00:08:55,729
Utakata:
And that's exactly
what she does.

170
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:59,663
She's an inspiration and a
comfort to all the kids here.

171
00:08:59,763 --> 00:09:02,596
She shows them that no matter
where they come from,

172
00:09:02,696 --> 00:09:04,129
they can become something great

173
00:09:04,229 --> 00:09:06,229
and that they can
be something more.

174
00:09:06,329 --> 00:09:09,796
And that's the true and
real power of Raikiri.

175
00:09:09,896 --> 00:09:11,596
(children chattering)

176
00:09:11,696 --> 00:09:12,829
Om!

177
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:14,229
(giggles)

178
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:16,496
Toka:
Alright...

179
00:09:16,596 --> 00:09:18,563
(giggling)

180
00:09:18,663 --> 00:09:20,496
The source of her strength...

181
00:09:20,596 --> 00:09:23,496
is that she uses
her power for others...

182
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:26,663
and never simply for herself.

183
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:35,096
That's her power... but do I
really understand the source...

184
00:09:37,496 --> 00:09:39,063
...of mine?

185
00:09:40,696 --> 00:09:42,663
Kagami:
Look! They're back!

186
00:09:42,763 --> 00:09:45,363
Stella! Kurogane!

187
00:09:45,463 --> 00:09:47,829
What's up guys?
Is something wrong?

188
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:50,063
You two need
to look at this!

189
00:09:50,163 --> 00:09:51,396
What's the...

190
00:09:51,496 --> 00:09:51,663
(gasps)
Ah!

191
00:09:51,763 --> 00:09:54,829
Ikki:
Crimson Princess,
forbidden affair?

192
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:55,896
Stella:
What?!

193
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:57,429
Alice:
The press is everywhere.

194
00:09:57,529 --> 00:09:59,996
They love a State Sex Scandal
even more than they love

195
00:10:00,096 --> 00:10:01,429
a celebrity in rehab...

196
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:02,496
Hmph!

197
00:10:02,596 --> 00:10:07,096
"Her partner Ikki Kurogane‐
well known as Hagun Academy's
worst student...

198
00:10:07,196 --> 00:10:12,096
Under continued investigation
by the Knight Federation
for misconduct..."?!

199
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:14,463
This is all nothing but lies!

200
00:10:14,563 --> 00:10:15,363
Grrr!

201
00:10:15,463 --> 00:10:16,596
Uh...

202
00:10:18,363 --> 00:10:19,363
Huh?

203
00:10:26,336 --> 00:10:28,185
(snickers)

204
00:10:29,851 --> 00:10:30,685
Who's that?

205
00:10:30,785 --> 00:10:34,785
Mamoru Akaza. One of
our father's henchmen.

206
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:37,785
Akaza:
Ikki Kurogane.

207
00:10:37,885 --> 00:10:39,551
Based upon recent
developments...

208
00:10:39,651 --> 00:10:42,751
The Federation has decided
to conduct a hearing.

209
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,618
Will you come
with me please?

210
00:10:44,718 --> 00:10:46,251
What? What kind
of hearing?

211
00:10:46,351 --> 00:10:50,051
This is an official summons‐
straight from the
ethics committee...

212
00:10:50,151 --> 00:10:53,085
So you will honor
it of course...?

213
00:10:54,451 --> 00:10:56,685
(snickers)

214
00:10:56,785 --> 00:10:57,585
Are you kidding?!

215
00:10:57,685 --> 00:11:00,951
You can't just run around
pulling people off the street!

216
00:11:01,751 --> 00:11:02,951
Ikki?

217
00:11:03,051 --> 00:11:06,751
It's fine.
I'll be... right back.

218
00:11:06,851 --> 00:11:08,318
This is my problem.

219
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:09,885
Yeah but...

220
00:11:10,318 --> 00:11:11,318
Alice.

221
00:11:11,418 --> 00:11:13,418
Ikki:
Look after Stella
and Shizuku.

222
00:11:13,518 --> 00:11:15,818
Yep... you got it.

223
00:11:40,885 --> 00:11:42,151
(snickers)

224
00:11:42,251 --> 00:11:45,718
Let's get started, shall we,
young Mister Kurogane?

225
00:11:45,818 --> 00:11:48,585
Precisely when did you
begin your relationship

226
00:11:48,685 --> 00:11:50,885
with Princess Stella Vermillion?

227
00:11:53,251 --> 00:11:55,351
Ikki:
Around the beginning
of the selection match

228
00:11:55,451 --> 00:11:57,251
for the Seven Star.

229
00:11:57,351 --> 00:11:59,285
It was after my
first match ended.

230
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,285
And did it not occur to you
that an indecent relationship

231
00:12:02,385 --> 00:12:05,518
with a foreign princess,
might not be an advisable
course of action?!

232
00:12:05,618 --> 00:12:10,251
Pardon me, Sir, but the princess
and I have engaged
in no indecent beha‐

233
00:12:11,518 --> 00:12:12,551
Akaza:
Ikki, Ikki...

234
00:12:12,651 --> 00:12:17,151
You will be informed when
we are prepared to allow you
to make your statement.

235
00:12:17,251 --> 00:12:19,818
Akaza:
Impertinence has no
place here, son.

236
00:12:19,918 --> 00:12:21,285
Forgive me, Sir.

237
00:12:21,385 --> 00:12:24,751
However, I must insist
on making this very clear.

238
00:12:24,851 --> 00:12:26,285
Now, Ikki...!

239
00:12:26,385 --> 00:12:28,985
I love the Princess
and she loves me.

240
00:12:29,085 --> 00:12:32,685
Our intentions are as
pure as they are serious.

241
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:34,085
We've done nothing wrong...

242
00:12:34,185 --> 00:12:36,185
And I cannot simply
stand here and stay mute,

243
00:12:36,285 --> 00:12:38,885
while you try and tell us
that we have!

244
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,618
What they're really after
is a full confession:

245
00:12:43,718 --> 00:12:46,885
"I did it... I defiled
the princess and dishonored

246
00:12:46,985 --> 00:12:48,318
my family's good name..."

247
00:12:48,418 --> 00:12:51,218
That's what they're trying to
get from Kurogane‐ isn't it?

248
00:12:51,318 --> 00:12:52,118
Mm‐hmm...

249
00:12:52,218 --> 00:12:55,318
but the national branches
can't simply disqualify a knight

250
00:12:55,418 --> 00:12:56,718
of their own volition...

251
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:58,585
Right... but
that slimeball Akaza

252
00:12:58,685 --> 00:13:01,685
will stop at absolutely
nothing to get what he wants...

253
00:13:01,785 --> 00:13:03,185
Kurono:
Oh, I know...

254
00:13:09,118 --> 00:13:11,918
The hearing resumes
at six in the morning sharp.

255
00:13:12,018 --> 00:13:13,385
Go to sleep now.

256
00:13:28,385 --> 00:13:33,185
Game over! Stella is
on fire! 15 for 15!

257
00:13:33,285 --> 00:13:34,085
Male Student 1:
Did you see the news?

258
00:13:34,185 --> 00:13:36,951
Male Student 2:
I know! Those two are
in so much trouble!

259
00:13:37,051 --> 00:13:39,551
I heard they are
sharing a room!

260
00:13:39,651 --> 00:13:42,118
Male Student 3:
I bet it gets real
steamy in there man!

261
00:13:42,218 --> 00:13:44,918
Male Student 4:
Heh, she prob'ly
burns the bed!
Hmph. That's a

262
00:13:45,018 --> 00:13:47,151
They have no idea
what they're up against!

263
00:13:47,251 --> 00:13:49,451
She's got nothin'
in her way!

264
00:13:49,551 --> 00:13:51,251
Oh, doesn't she...?

265
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:04,785
Ikki...

266
00:14:09,885 --> 00:14:11,518
Selection match here?

267
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:13,318
Instead of the academy...?

268
00:14:13,418 --> 00:14:17,818
Yes! We would certainly
never wish to interfere
with your other duties.

269
00:14:17,918 --> 00:14:21,385
Chief Akaza did you
a favor! Be grateful!

270
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,318
(snickers)

271
00:14:27,185 --> 00:14:28,918
Ikki:
Ah! Miss Yuri!

272
00:14:29,018 --> 00:14:29,618
Kurogane...

273
00:14:29,718 --> 00:14:31,185
No private
conversations!

274
00:14:31,285 --> 00:14:33,951
Get in your starting
position prisoner!

275
00:14:37,518 --> 00:14:39,551
(snickers)

276
00:14:39,651 --> 00:14:41,418
Akaza:
Let's go ahead!

277
00:14:46,551 --> 00:14:49,451
Kagami:
"Ikki Kurogane narrowly
wins the battle...

278
00:14:49,551 --> 00:14:52,718
his face showing no
expression of remorse."

279
00:14:52,818 --> 00:14:54,918
It's just more
Ethics Committee propaganda.

280
00:14:55,018 --> 00:14:56,585
Alice:
They're dragging Ikki through
all the mud they can muster.
Isn't that the girl?

281
00:14:56,685 --> 00:14:58,918
Alice:
They're dragging Ikki through
all the mud they can muster.
It is!

282
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:04,751
Could all this
be my fault?

283
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:08,085
Maybe I... should
just let him go...

284
00:15:08,185 --> 00:15:09,118
STELLA!

285
00:15:12,451 --> 00:15:13,551
Stella!

286
00:15:16,618 --> 00:15:19,251
Shizuku‐ what's
your problem?!

287
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:22,651
That's my question.
What is YOUR problem?

288
00:15:22,751 --> 00:15:24,518
Is it possible
that you don't understand

289
00:15:24,618 --> 00:15:27,085
why my brother is putting
himself through all of this?

290
00:15:27,185 --> 00:15:28,985
Shizuku:
It's because he couldn't deal
with the fact

291
00:15:29,085 --> 00:15:31,018
that his relationship
with you was violated

292
00:15:31,118 --> 00:15:33,318
by their obscene intervention!

293
00:15:34,218 --> 00:15:35,118
That is why!

294
00:15:35,218 --> 00:15:36,785
That's what you mean to him!

295
00:15:36,885 --> 00:15:39,185
That's how much
my brother loves you!

296
00:15:40,885 --> 00:15:42,318
Stella...

297
00:15:42,418 --> 00:15:44,418
I want to stand
in front of everyone...

298
00:15:44,518 --> 00:15:47,851
and tell them how
I feel about you...

299
00:15:47,951 --> 00:15:49,918
Shizuku:
If you don't
even understand that,

300
00:15:50,018 --> 00:15:52,685
if you dare walk
away from him...

301
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,885
I will never forgive you.

302
00:15:56,885 --> 00:15:58,851
Me neither...

303
00:16:04,766 --> 00:16:06,494
Stella:
Ikki is doing
this to protect me.

304
00:16:06,594 --> 00:16:09,361
He is fighting them for me.

305
00:16:09,461 --> 00:16:12,094
But what... can I do...?

306
00:16:15,861 --> 00:16:17,828
What can I do?!

307
00:16:22,394 --> 00:16:23,494
(snickers)

308
00:16:23,594 --> 00:16:24,861
That's it!

309
00:16:24,961 --> 00:16:28,194
Ikki Kurogane wins!
Well done, son!

310
00:16:28,294 --> 00:16:33,828
(panting)

311
00:16:33,928 --> 00:16:35,628
Easy Kurogane, it's okay...

312
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,561
Do not touch
him ma'am!

313
00:16:37,661 --> 00:16:39,428
Yeah, yeah...

314
00:16:39,528 --> 00:16:40,094
Mm... bleeeeeegh!

315
00:16:40,194 --> 00:16:41,961
What the hell?!
Mm... bleeeeeegh!

316
00:16:45,194 --> 00:16:48,994
Alright... I'll see you
at your 17th match.

317
00:16:49,094 --> 00:16:50,994
What's the matter
with her?

318
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:54,461
(snickers)
A messy but
impressive trick.

319
00:16:58,494 --> 00:17:03,061
(panting)

320
00:17:07,561 --> 00:17:08,528
(gasps)

321
00:17:15,128 --> 00:17:19,261
Ikki:
Stella's fighting...
and she's winning...

322
00:17:20,228 --> 00:17:22,728
She is going to
keep our promise.

323
00:17:22,828 --> 00:17:24,828
And so will I.

324
00:17:24,928 --> 00:17:26,328
No matter what happens...

325
00:17:26,428 --> 00:17:30,161
Or... who tries
to get between us...

326
00:17:30,261 --> 00:17:32,594
Let me speak
with my father.

327
00:17:32,694 --> 00:17:33,294
Pardon?

328
00:17:33,394 --> 00:17:36,894
My father... Itsuki Kurogane
is the branch leader.

329
00:17:36,994 --> 00:17:39,628
I'll take my appeal
directly to him.

330
00:17:39,728 --> 00:17:40,828
(snickers)

331
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:45,061
Patently ridiculous!
Is this why you asked to see me?

332
00:17:45,161 --> 00:17:47,294
Huh? What?! Impossible!

333
00:17:47,394 --> 00:17:49,294
Why would he interrupt
in the midst of...

334
00:17:49,394 --> 00:17:50,261
Oh!

335
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:54,228
Could this be the
little vixen's doing...?

336
00:17:54,328 --> 00:17:59,028
Kurogane. I'm afraid...
it's time to face your past...

337
00:18:07,228 --> 00:18:07,994
Father.

338
00:18:08,094 --> 00:18:12,128
I heard... you're
winning all your matches.

339
00:18:12,228 --> 00:18:16,128
and that not all of your
opponents are weak
or low‐ranking.

340
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,961
That's quite... something.

341
00:18:19,061 --> 00:18:19,828
(heart pounding)

342
00:18:19,928 --> 00:18:21,561
Father...

343
00:18:22,594 --> 00:18:24,094
Ikki:
I thought I was done...

344
00:18:24,194 --> 00:18:26,494
done with you,
done with this family...

345
00:18:26,594 --> 00:18:29,461
I didn't want to be what
you were making me in to.

346
00:18:29,561 --> 00:18:33,428
It's what fueled me and
kept me going into battles....

347
00:18:33,528 --> 00:18:36,028
But now I see you here
in front of me...

348
00:18:36,128 --> 00:18:39,428
and all I want...
all I ever wanted...

349
00:18:40,628 --> 00:18:41,994
Father‐ I...

350
00:18:44,194 --> 00:18:45,894
I'm working very hard.

351
00:18:45,994 --> 00:18:49,094
My rank is still F,
but I'm getting...

352
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,194
getting much stronger
every day...

353
00:18:51,294 --> 00:18:55,861
If I could make it to
the Seven Star... if I won...

354
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:00,294
would you...
acknowledge me then?

355
00:19:01,594 --> 00:19:02,594
I see.

356
00:19:02,694 --> 00:19:05,128
You thought all this time
that you weren't acknowledged

357
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:07,194
because you were simply weak.

358
00:19:08,294 --> 00:19:11,694
If that is so‐ you've made
a terrible error.

359
00:19:11,794 --> 00:19:14,161
I have always acknowledged you.

360
00:19:15,928 --> 00:19:20,561
However... teaching our family
techniques to someone without
significant talent...

361
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:24,361
is a futile exercise for both
the teacher and the student.

362
00:19:24,461 --> 00:19:24,861
Huh?

363
00:19:24,961 --> 00:19:27,294
But, futility is not
the worst thing.

364
00:19:27,394 --> 00:19:30,794
It's far worse to
imagine mediocrity
as something toward which

365
00:19:30,894 --> 00:19:32,194
we should strive.

366
00:19:32,294 --> 00:19:34,128
Much as you're doing now.

367
00:19:42,994 --> 00:19:44,928
Itsuki:
When mediocrity rises‐

368
00:19:45,028 --> 00:19:46,228
it demeans us all.

369
00:19:46,328 --> 00:19:47,994
When we celebrate
the untalented,

370
00:19:48,094 --> 00:19:50,861
more untalented seek
to follow their example.

371
00:19:50,961 --> 00:19:53,561
And that's something this
organization can't allow.

372
00:19:53,661 --> 00:19:58,528
Ikki:
I see. It wasn't that
my father hated me...
Itsuki:

373
00:19:58,628 --> 00:20:00,528
Ikki:
It was that he never...
had any expectations of me...
Itsuki:

374
00:20:00,628 --> 00:20:03,161
Ikki:
It was that he never...
had any expectations of me...
Itsuki:

375
00:20:03,261 --> 00:20:04,361
Itsuki:
Your place in the pecking order
is decided the very
moment you're born...

376
00:20:04,461 --> 00:20:07,794
Ikki:
and you can't fail a man who
expects nothing from you...
Itsuki:

377
00:20:07,894 --> 00:20:10,728
If you can't achieve,
then you shouldn't achieve.

378
00:20:10,828 --> 00:20:13,828
And that's all
I ever wanted from you.

379
00:20:17,128 --> 00:20:18,461
What are you crying about?

380
00:20:18,561 --> 00:20:23,528
I'm nothing to him. And I've
always been nothing to him...

381
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:30,494
(snickers)

382
00:20:31,661 --> 00:20:34,061
Poor little... Kurogane...

383
00:20:37,794 --> 00:20:39,661
Ikki:
Until today...

384
00:20:39,761 --> 00:20:41,461
all I wanted from my father...

385
00:20:41,561 --> 00:20:45,161
was for him to tell me
that I was worthy...

386
00:20:45,261 --> 00:20:47,894
But I will never
be worthy of him...

387
00:20:47,994 --> 00:20:51,328
Not to him...
and not to anyone else...

388
00:20:52,494 --> 00:20:53,894
Ever...

389
00:20:56,328 --> 00:20:58,694
I had no idea
it went so deep.

390
00:20:58,794 --> 00:21:00,794
Yes... I know...

391
00:21:00,894 --> 00:21:04,461
I never imagined that he could
still have such feeling for our
father.

392
00:21:04,561 --> 00:21:08,228
Timing couldn't be worse...
but I have news...

393
00:21:11,428 --> 00:21:14,528
It's time that you learned
who you're facing next.

394
00:21:14,628 --> 00:21:16,894
It's Toka... "Raikiri" Todo.

395
00:21:16,994 --> 00:21:21,761
Inquisitor 1:
Your opponent for your
final‐round selection match
has been decided.

396
00:21:21,861 --> 00:21:24,161
The Ethics Committee
has grown tired...

397
00:21:24,261 --> 00:21:25,861
of this embarrassing debacle...

398
00:21:25,961 --> 00:21:29,228
Inquisitor 2:
If you wish to prove your
qualifications as a knight,

399
00:21:29,328 --> 00:21:33,528
then win this duel and see
these questions put to rest.

400
00:21:33,628 --> 00:21:34,594
Duel...

401
00:21:34,694 --> 00:21:35,994
(snickers)

402
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:38,061
If you win the match
against Raikiri...

403
00:21:38,161 --> 00:21:41,094
we will no longer persue
this inquiry against you.

404
00:21:41,194 --> 00:21:42,394
But if you lose today...

405
00:21:42,494 --> 00:21:46,828
you'll have to give up these
ambitions of becoming a Magical
Knight for good.

406
00:21:47,661 --> 00:21:48,794
I understand.

407
00:21:48,894 --> 00:21:51,094
(snickers)

408
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:56,594
Akaza:
The match will begin
at 11 am tomorrow.

409
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:11,428
Stella:
Ikki...
