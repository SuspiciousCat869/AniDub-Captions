1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,833
Ayase:
The Last Samurai...

2
00:00:03,933 --> 00:00:08,300
that was my father,
Kaito Ayatsuji's nickname.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,833
When I was in junior high, he
retired due to a heart problem.

4
00:00:13,933 --> 00:00:17,333
Even when he became unable to
wield a sword like he used to,

5
00:00:17,433 --> 00:00:20,700
he still taught us
and guided us with dignity.

6
00:00:23,766 --> 00:00:25,133
Kaito:
No.

7
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:28,500
Relax your shoulders
but keep your arms strong.

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,300
Tighten your wrists more,
but never strain.

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,033
Try to be as natural
as you can be.

10
00:00:35,133 --> 00:00:36,333
Until you've mastered that,

11
00:00:36,433 --> 00:00:40,666
you won't be able to master the
secret technique of Ten‐i‐muho.

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,133
Don't strain.

13
00:00:44,233 --> 00:00:46,200
Ayase:
I‐It's hard to do!

14
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,200
Father, maybe it's
impossible for me...

15
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,733
Kaito:
It's not impossible.

16
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:50,900
Ayase.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,433
You have followed my teachings
with greater devotion

18
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:55,633
than anyone else
I've ever seen.

19
00:00:55,733 --> 00:00:57,066
Uh...!

20
00:00:57,166 --> 00:01:00,166
Kaito:
I know you've taken it to heart:

21
00:01:00,266 --> 00:01:03,166
"A warrior must never
lose sight of her pride."

22
00:01:03,266 --> 00:01:07,566
"Value civility... Help
the weak. Hate all evil."

23
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:10,900
The secrets of
Ayatsuji Itto‐ryu...

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,400
Ayase:
Are meant to protect people.

25
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:18,233
That's when I realized...

26
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:19,900
that my father doesn't...

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,733
have very much time left.

28
00:01:23,033 --> 00:01:26,100
That's why he taught
me Ayatsuji Itto‐ryu...

29
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,633
even though I was
still... so immature.

30
00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:31,566
But... Father...

31
00:01:46,766 --> 00:01:48,266
Father...

32
00:03:24,631 --> 00:03:27,791
Stella:
Kuraudo Kurashiki,
a junior at Donro Academy.

33
00:03:27,891 --> 00:03:29,024
What a jerk.

34
00:03:29,124 --> 00:03:30,557
This guy is
really bad news.

35
00:03:30,657 --> 00:03:33,524
He has an ugly habit of
charging in to other schools,

36
00:03:33,624 --> 00:03:36,657
challenging their leaders‐
and then taking their dojos...

37
00:03:36,757 --> 00:03:39,891
Yeah but... he was also one
of the top eight contestants..

38
00:03:39,991 --> 00:03:42,724
at last year's Seven
Star Sword Art Festival...

39
00:03:42,824 --> 00:03:44,391
they call him
"Sword Eater."

40
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:47,457
Stella:
Sword Eater...
Swordsman killer.

41
00:03:47,557 --> 00:03:49,557
He's a force to
be reckoned with.

42
00:03:49,657 --> 00:03:52,724
Two years ago, when he
challenged my father's school...

43
00:03:52,824 --> 00:03:55,224
Ayase:
...he didn't even
use his device.

44
00:03:55,324 --> 00:03:56,957
He didn't use
any powers?

45
00:03:57,057 --> 00:03:58,891
His sword technique
must be strong...

46
00:03:58,991 --> 00:04:00,357
Ayase:
Yeah...

47
00:04:02,424 --> 00:04:04,291
even my father
couldn't...

48
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:05,691
That's unbelievable.

49
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:09,391
Kaito was called the "Last
Samurai..." for a good reason.

50
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:11,391
I've seen it...

51
00:04:12,224 --> 00:04:14,391
I've seen what he can do.

52
00:04:16,091 --> 00:04:17,657
Ayase:
It was like...

53
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,657
I was living in a nightmare
or something...

54
00:04:20,757 --> 00:04:25,957
Kurado:
(battle cry)
(laughs)

55
00:04:33,157 --> 00:04:34,791
Father!

56
00:04:37,224 --> 00:04:38,891
Father! Please stop!

57
00:04:38,991 --> 00:04:43,424
Sensei! Please‐ that's enough!
I beg you stop this!

58
00:04:43,957 --> 00:04:45,024
Thank you.. both..

59
00:04:45,124 --> 00:04:48,391
for demonstrating such
kindness and concern for me.

60
00:04:48,491 --> 00:04:51,291
I am very proud
of the both of you.

61
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,657
Kaito:
And that is why...

62
00:04:53,757 --> 00:04:54,857
(grunts)

63
00:04:54,957 --> 00:04:59,957
I can never forgive this
animal... for doing harm to you!

64
00:05:01,857 --> 00:05:03,891
The Last Samurai, huh?

65
00:05:03,991 --> 00:05:07,824
Protector of the people?
How noble of you.

66
00:05:07,924 --> 00:05:10,257
That it? That all ya got?

67
00:05:10,357 --> 00:05:13,091
Shit‐ I heard you
were a real badass...

68
00:05:13,191 --> 00:05:15,924
Let's find out... little man.

69
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:25,491
Father no!

70
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:28,524
This is my fight!
Stay out of it!

71
00:05:32,391 --> 00:05:35,091
I'll show you, if you wish...

72
00:05:35,191 --> 00:05:37,491
The heart of my sword‐form...

73
00:05:37,591 --> 00:05:40,524
the heart of Ayatsuji Itto‐ryu.

74
00:05:48,324 --> 00:05:49,757
Wha‐?!

75
00:05:55,124 --> 00:05:57,324
Stop!

76
00:06:06,557 --> 00:06:08,791
No...! Father!

77
00:06:10,324 --> 00:06:11,624
I‐...

78
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:14,124
Father!

79
00:06:14,224 --> 00:06:18,057
I'm...sorr...

80
00:06:19,757 --> 00:06:21,391
I...

81
00:06:23,757 --> 00:06:26,957
Kurado:
I'll give you twenty four hours
to pack up your shit and leave.

82
00:06:27,057 --> 00:06:30,357
You're stinkin' up my new house
with all that blood.

83
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:33,491
You son of a bitch!

84
00:06:34,724 --> 00:06:36,224
I should've stopped him...

85
00:06:36,324 --> 00:06:37,524
I should've...

86
00:06:37,624 --> 00:06:42,257
stood in front of that bastard
and taken my father's place.

87
00:06:42,357 --> 00:06:45,657
Kuraudo Kurashiki...
has no pride.

88
00:06:45,757 --> 00:06:48,457
He's a reckless barbarian.

89
00:06:48,557 --> 00:06:50,024
And that monster...

90
00:06:50,124 --> 00:06:52,724
took down... my father...

91
00:06:52,824 --> 00:06:55,957
and left him completely
broken and disgraced!

92
00:06:56,057 --> 00:06:57,491
I'm sorry...

93
00:07:00,191 --> 00:07:01,591
Kaito...

94
00:07:08,457 --> 00:07:12,424
Ayase:
This is what's left...
of my father's dojo...

95
00:07:24,724 --> 00:07:27,557
It looks like the
place has rats...

96
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:30,357
Thug 1:
Check this one out...

97
00:07:30,457 --> 00:07:32,257
Ikki:
Hey you guys...

98
00:07:32,357 --> 00:07:36,157
I'd appreciate it if you could
take me to see Kurashiki...

99
00:07:36,257 --> 00:07:37,824
Thug 1:
What the fuck...?

100
00:07:40,924 --> 00:07:43,391
(doors open)

101
00:07:52,024 --> 00:07:55,524
Well hey! It's the pussy
from the other day.

102
00:07:55,624 --> 00:07:59,724
Kurashiki. I am here
to challenge you.

103
00:08:00,824 --> 00:08:02,324
Yeah?

104
00:08:02,424 --> 00:08:05,257
On behalf... of the
Ayatsuji family,

105
00:08:05,357 --> 00:08:07,357
I'm prepared to fight
you for this school.

106
00:08:07,457 --> 00:08:09,891
(chuckles)
You want my dojo?

107
00:08:09,991 --> 00:08:13,257
Pretty ballsy, kid...
I already kicked
your ass once.

108
00:08:13,357 --> 00:08:16,857
And you know that wasn't the
right time or place for that.

109
00:08:18,591 --> 00:08:20,824
How did she talk
you into it?

110
00:08:22,524 --> 00:08:24,657
It's prohibited for the
knights of Hagun Academy

111
00:08:24,757 --> 00:08:27,457
to use their devices outside
the school without permission.

112
00:08:27,557 --> 00:08:31,157
Unless of course you happen
to be at an accredited
martial arts school

113
00:08:31,257 --> 00:08:32,957
and the master
permits it.

114
00:08:33,057 --> 00:08:35,157
You're not going
to turn me down, are you?

115
00:08:35,257 --> 00:08:37,357
(chuckles)
Interesting!

116
00:08:37,457 --> 00:08:38,824
But before we get into it...

117
00:08:38,924 --> 00:08:43,757
I'm gonna have to make sure
you're even qualified
to take me on.

118
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,324
These guys...
think I am.

119
00:08:54,957 --> 00:08:56,624
Orochimaru.

120
00:09:00,324 --> 00:09:01,857
Easy, boy...

121
00:09:01,957 --> 00:09:03,657
(laughs)

122
00:09:03,757 --> 00:09:07,957
(exerting force)

123
00:09:16,091 --> 00:09:18,357
Come to me, Intetsu.

124
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:29,291
Ooh nice... that's a
first‐class stance...

125
00:09:30,524 --> 00:09:33,424
Damn I love fucking
up swordsmen!

126
00:09:40,724 --> 00:09:43,824
Alright then...
Are you ready to die?!

127
00:09:48,757 --> 00:09:50,057
(laughs)

128
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:51,824
Nice reflexes!

129
00:09:54,091 --> 00:09:54,857
(chuckles)

130
00:09:54,957 --> 00:09:55,524
Oops!

131
00:09:55,624 --> 00:09:57,424
My timing
was perfect...

132
00:09:57,524 --> 00:10:00,424
Does he know
what's coming? No...

133
00:10:03,757 --> 00:10:06,924
Bring me his head...
Jakotsujin!

134
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:13,457
Orochimaru can transform
into anything!

135
00:10:13,557 --> 00:10:17,491
It's impossible to get
out of my reach‐ asshole!

136
00:10:17,591 --> 00:10:21,124
Kurashiki's reach almost
seems to be... endless...

137
00:10:21,224 --> 00:10:25,257
Ikki's not as effective
from range and he has no
way to close the gap...

138
00:10:25,357 --> 00:10:26,157
But it doesn't matter.

139
00:10:26,257 --> 00:10:29,291
Ikki's technique is way more
than this guy can handle.

140
00:10:29,391 --> 00:10:30,991
Poor dumbass...

141
00:10:34,724 --> 00:10:37,957
So that's your next move...
I thought so.

142
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:41,624
Perfect vision!

143
00:10:43,824 --> 00:10:45,991
Missed me!

144
00:10:46,091 --> 00:10:48,524
His reflexes... I see!

145
00:10:50,091 --> 00:10:51,791
(laughter)

146
00:10:51,891 --> 00:10:52,724
No!

147
00:10:53,891 --> 00:10:56,657
What... did we...
just see?!

148
00:10:56,757 --> 00:11:01,324
(chuckles)
You can dodge that‐
that's pretty good!

149
00:11:04,091 --> 00:11:05,891
I see now.

150
00:11:05,991 --> 00:11:08,124
This ability of yours...

151
00:11:08,224 --> 00:11:10,924
this is how you defeated
the Last Samurai.

152
00:11:21,632 --> 00:11:24,537
The foundation of your technique
is built on a single power...

153
00:11:24,637 --> 00:11:26,704
and that's your
reflex speed.

154
00:11:26,804 --> 00:11:30,404
Ikki:
"To perceive, to understand,
and to respond."

155
00:11:30,504 --> 00:11:33,304
The time it takes to process
and execute all of these things

156
00:11:33,404 --> 00:11:35,437
is called... reflex speed.

157
00:11:35,537 --> 00:11:38,970
It's about three tenths
of a second for most people...

158
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,604
For me and Stella‐ it's about
a tenth of a second,

159
00:11:41,704 --> 00:11:43,637
no matter how much we train.

160
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:46,070
But I've been watching the speed
of your counterattacks...

161
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:50,004
And you've actually
managed to get it down to
five hundredths of a second.

162
00:11:50,104 --> 00:11:53,604
Before I can make one move,
you can make two or three...

163
00:11:53,704 --> 00:11:56,770
that gives you quite the
advantage in a battle like this.

164
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:59,204
With a reflex speed...
that fast...

165
00:11:59,304 --> 00:12:02,570
You can dodge attacks
that would otherwise be
impossible to avoid,

166
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:06,070
or alter your weapon's
orientation before
it makes contact,

167
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:10,337
enabling you to strike
spontaneously from a
completely different angle.

168
00:12:10,437 --> 00:12:12,470
This is why his sword
looked like it disappeared

169
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,437
in the middle
of a stroke.

170
00:12:14,537 --> 00:12:15,337
(laughs)

171
00:12:15,437 --> 00:12:16,504
I gotta hand
it to ya‐

172
00:12:16,604 --> 00:12:18,304
you figured out my
"Marginal Counter"

173
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,604
the first time
you fought me.

174
00:12:19,704 --> 00:12:22,204
Big deal...
it won't help you.

175
00:12:22,304 --> 00:12:24,137
There's nothing
you can do about it.

176
00:12:24,237 --> 00:12:26,904
Marginal Counter
is not a technique.

177
00:12:27,004 --> 00:12:29,170
It's a gift
I was born with.

178
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:31,404
No matter how much
you train your body,

179
00:12:31,504 --> 00:12:34,737
hone your techniques,
Or study your tactics...

180
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,404
Yes. It's meaningless
if it's all overwhelmed

181
00:12:37,504 --> 00:12:39,804
by your natural
reflex speed.

182
00:12:39,904 --> 00:12:43,170
Wow man you are one
insightful little shit...

183
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:47,670
I hope you don't
die too fast! Hebigami!

184
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:51,604
Double strikes...
from one attack!

185
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:55,604
Amateur! You think you can
pull the same trick twice?!

186
00:12:57,804 --> 00:12:59,037
Irregular guarding?

187
00:12:59,137 --> 00:12:59,737
That's right.

188
00:12:59,837 --> 00:13:03,237
It means you're not the only
one who can control distance!

189
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:04,770
(laughs)

190
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:09,204
It's not over! Let's see how
you manage this little trick!

191
00:13:11,237 --> 00:13:13,437
A four‐point attack?!

192
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,937
I can't block
them all...!

193
00:13:25,737 --> 00:13:29,370
Huh... Your clumsiness kept
me from killing you that time.

194
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,504
Lucky son of a bitch...

195
00:13:31,604 --> 00:13:34,404
His skill is
truly exceptional!

196
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:38,204
I'm not gonna give you
a second chance to stumble.

197
00:13:38,304 --> 00:13:40,670
I'll slice you into pieces!

198
00:14:01,404 --> 00:14:04,404
You won't get your school back
if you get involved.

199
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:10,304
Trust me... I'd like a
piece of him‐ myself...

200
00:14:10,404 --> 00:14:14,270
But look... he's having
so much fun.

201
00:14:16,304 --> 00:14:18,104
He's smiling?

202
00:14:18,204 --> 00:14:20,204
This is his
favorite thing.

203
00:14:20,304 --> 00:14:21,937
Vanquishing
the adversary...

204
00:14:22,037 --> 00:14:25,237
Facing overwhelming strength
and defeating it...

205
00:14:25,337 --> 00:14:28,237
That is all that
Ikki's thinking about.

206
00:14:41,204 --> 00:14:42,070
Hey Ayase...?

207
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:46,770
Are you sure
the Last Samurai was so
ashamed when he went down...?

208
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,970
What are you talking about?!
Of course he was ashamed!

209
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,704
Ayase:
This... this bastard mocked
my father's honor...

210
00:14:52,804 --> 00:14:54,570
and challenged
him for his dojo...

211
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:59,004
Cut him down in what should've
been his peaceful years...!

212
00:14:59,104 --> 00:15:03,537
I understand... but it might
not be all that simple...

213
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:06,704
Stella:
Your father was
a master swordsman, Ayase.

214
00:15:06,804 --> 00:15:09,970
There's a reason people
called him The Last Samurai.

215
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:13,437
How long do you think such a
warrior could feel fulfilled...

216
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,904
by growing old peacefully?

217
00:15:19,604 --> 00:15:23,004
Stella:
You're right about this guy‐
he is an animal...

218
00:15:23,104 --> 00:15:26,070
But... don't you think some
part of your father...

219
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:29,137
relished the idea that someone
like this would come along

220
00:15:29,237 --> 00:15:30,504
and challenge him?

221
00:15:30,604 --> 00:15:34,770
And in the end... he went down
just how he wanted to?

222
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:40,537
His... his final words...

223
00:15:42,104 --> 00:15:43,337
I‐...

224
00:15:44,604 --> 00:15:45,804
Father!

225
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:48,870
I'm...sorry... I...

226
00:15:51,237 --> 00:15:57,837
I'm sorry... I could
not finish the lesson...

227
00:15:59,504 --> 00:16:02,870
I can see that I was never
a real swordsman...

228
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:07,904
I never understood...
...the Warrior's Way...

229
00:16:08,004 --> 00:16:11,637
(sobbing)

230
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:12,804
Father!

231
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,437
Stella:
So that's the
Sword Eater's weakness!

232
00:16:22,537 --> 00:16:26,070
"Marginal Counter" gives him
a whole lot of extra speed...

233
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:28,604
but no extra
stamina...

234
00:16:30,537 --> 00:16:32,970
Goddamn‐ you are
a stubborn little shit.

235
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,804
Hate to lose...
you know how it is...

236
00:16:35,904 --> 00:16:39,137
Honestly... you've really been
keeping me on my toes,

237
00:16:39,237 --> 00:16:40,837
you're very gifted...

238
00:16:40,937 --> 00:16:43,137
I've been having fun...

239
00:16:43,237 --> 00:16:44,870
I wanted to
make it last...

240
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,270
You're
havin'... fun?

241
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:50,170
(laughs)
You are my kind
of psychopath!

242
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,870
If you don't mind I...
got a question...

243
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,604
Go ahead...

244
00:16:54,704 --> 00:16:56,470
There's something
I want to know...

245
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,237
about the Last
Samurai...

246
00:16:58,337 --> 00:17:01,437
Ikki:
He was smiling just
like we are‐ wasn't he?

247
00:17:01,537 --> 00:17:02,937
What a stupid
question.

248
00:17:03,037 --> 00:17:06,404
Look, you don't earn a name
like "The Last Samurai..."

249
00:17:06,504 --> 00:17:10,204
If a nice, deadly battle
doesn't make you smile!

250
00:17:14,004 --> 00:17:16,204
Miss Ayatsuji.

251
00:17:16,304 --> 00:17:19,237
With all my strength...
for you and your father...

252
00:17:19,337 --> 00:17:21,670
I'm gonna get
back your two years.

253
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:35,837
Come! Yamata‐no‐orochi!

254
00:17:41,537 --> 00:17:45,304
Straight ahead?! This kid's
got a death wish!

255
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:55,837
This is... what the old man
was trying to show me
before he keeled over!

256
00:18:02,104 --> 00:18:06,070
Aw man I waited two whole
years to see this move!

257
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,770
Haaa!

258
00:18:23,884 --> 00:18:25,188
Did... he just use...?

259
00:18:25,288 --> 00:18:29,354
(pained breathing)

260
00:18:29,454 --> 00:18:34,088
Ayase:
My father's final
technique... Ten‐i‐muho!

261
00:18:36,021 --> 00:18:39,888
The soul... of
Ayatsuji Itto‐ryu!

262
00:18:39,988 --> 00:18:43,354
How... How does
he even know that?

263
00:18:43,454 --> 00:18:46,221
Did I... show him...?

264
00:18:46,321 --> 00:18:47,754
Oh yeah‐
"Blade Steal..."

265
00:18:47,854 --> 00:18:48,321
Huh?

266
00:18:48,421 --> 00:18:51,821
(chuckles)
He's done it to me too.

267
00:18:51,921 --> 00:18:55,688
Stella:
Lemme tell ya... that's not all
he steals‐ either....

268
00:19:02,021 --> 00:19:04,188
Alright. What's your name?

269
00:19:05,121 --> 00:19:06,921
Ikki Kurogane.

270
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:08,621
Kurogane...

271
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:18,021
We'll finish this at the
Seven Star Sword Art Festival.

272
00:19:18,121 --> 00:19:19,754
What about the dojo.

273
00:19:19,854 --> 00:19:21,588
It was fun while
it lasted...

274
00:19:21,688 --> 00:19:24,754
but I've got bigger
fish to fry, kid.

275
00:19:29,554 --> 00:19:30,221
Uh!

276
00:19:30,321 --> 00:19:32,821
Ikki! Are
you alright?!

277
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,988
Ayase:
Kurogane...

278
00:19:35,088 --> 00:19:37,088
I owe you
an big apology.

279
00:19:37,188 --> 00:19:39,254
All of this is
completely my fault...

280
00:19:39,354 --> 00:19:42,688
I guess I never really
understood anything...

281
00:19:42,788 --> 00:19:46,954
About my father... or what
it means to live as a warrior...

282
00:19:47,054 --> 00:19:48,488
I'm simply not worthy...

283
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:51,888
to carry on with teaching
Ayatsuji Itto‐ryu.

284
00:19:51,988 --> 00:19:53,421
Ikki:
That's not true.

285
00:19:53,521 --> 00:19:54,454
Huh?

286
00:19:54,554 --> 00:19:56,521
Ikki:
The reason I could win today...

287
00:19:56,621 --> 00:19:58,888
was because you knew
that technique...

288
00:19:58,988 --> 00:20:02,321
you understand Kaito's sword
to the last inch.

289
00:20:02,421 --> 00:20:04,588
Without your understanding
of the style...

290
00:20:04,688 --> 00:20:08,754
I couldn't have used Ten‐i‐muho
in the first place.

291
00:20:08,854 --> 00:20:13,321
No one in the world
is better suited to carry
on your father's legacy.

292
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:17,021
The true successor of the Last
Samurai should be his daughter.

293
00:20:17,121 --> 00:20:19,221
Maybe she
should...

294
00:20:20,254 --> 00:20:24,321
Thank you...
But if that's the case...

295
00:20:24,421 --> 00:20:27,954
Then I'm gonna... have to train
hard and grow stronger...

296
00:20:28,054 --> 00:20:32,254
Ayase:
My father's successor...
better be a great warrior..

297
00:20:40,954 --> 00:20:43,554
Stella:
So... did you
hear about Ayase?

298
00:20:43,654 --> 00:20:46,788
Apparently she had
a meeting with the
Selection Match Committee...

299
00:20:46,888 --> 00:20:50,688
and admitted to laying all
those traps before your match.

300
00:20:50,788 --> 00:20:51,621
I did.

301
00:20:51,721 --> 00:20:54,088
She was disqualified
from the match,

302
00:20:54,188 --> 00:20:56,521
and got suspended
for 10 days.

303
00:20:56,621 --> 00:20:59,788
She said that she was
gonna take responsibility...

304
00:20:59,888 --> 00:21:01,221
I guess she
really meant it.

305
00:21:01,321 --> 00:21:02,421
(phone rings)

306
00:21:02,521 --> 00:21:03,254
Huh?

307
00:21:04,354 --> 00:21:05,188
Ikki:
Ayase?

308
00:21:05,288 --> 00:21:06,421
What'd she say?

309
00:21:06,521 --> 00:21:09,354
She says that her father's
come out of his coma!

310
00:21:09,454 --> 00:21:11,521
Really?
That's great!

311
00:21:11,621 --> 00:21:13,921
Well... it looks like
that all got wrapped up

312
00:21:14,021 --> 00:21:15,688
rather nicely
didn't it?

313
00:21:15,788 --> 00:21:16,721
Mhmm!

314
00:21:16,821 --> 00:21:19,488
You did
good... Ikki.

315
00:21:19,588 --> 00:21:21,288
Awwww!

316
00:21:21,388 --> 00:21:21,621
Eh?!

317
00:21:21,721 --> 00:21:23,221
Sh‐Shizuku?! Alice?!

318
00:21:23,321 --> 00:21:25,321
C'mon Ikki‐ here‐
let's battle!

319
00:21:25,421 --> 00:21:28,354
Japanese thumb wrestling!
Ready, set, go!

320
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,721
Oh my. I hope we're
not interrupting...

321
00:21:30,821 --> 00:21:33,221
I think we have a
legitimate right to do so...

322
00:21:33,321 --> 00:21:38,021
I mean‐ we were both completely
left out of this whole
"Ayase's Dojo" thing...

323
00:21:38,121 --> 00:21:40,088
Maybe we should go
pick some fights...

324
00:21:40,188 --> 00:21:40,621
Huh?!
Uhh!

325
00:21:40,721 --> 00:21:43,121
C'mon Ikki! I was just
about to beat you!

326
00:21:43,221 --> 00:21:46,321
Well‐ I know I have my own
complications but...

327
00:21:46,421 --> 00:21:48,288
at least I've never been
that high maintenance...

328
00:21:48,388 --> 00:21:50,154
Stella:
Who you callin
"high maintenance"?!

329
00:21:50,254 --> 00:21:51,521
Shizuku:
I'm talkin'
to you‐ Princess.

330
00:21:51,621 --> 00:21:53,821
Stella:
And what exactly about me
says "high maintenance"?!

331
00:21:53,921 --> 00:21:56,388
Shizuku:
It probably takes a team of
people to put your bras on...

332
00:21:56,488 --> 00:21:57,354
Stella:
OH MY GOD!

333
00:21:57,454 --> 00:21:58,588
Shizuku:
They must
be exhausted...

334
00:21:58,688 --> 00:22:02,354
Stella & Shizuku:
(back and forth arguing)
