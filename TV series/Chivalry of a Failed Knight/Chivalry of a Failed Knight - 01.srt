1
00:00:02,233 --> 00:00:05,633
Reporter:
Stella Vermillion,
second princess of the
Vermillion Empire

2
00:00:05,733 --> 00:00:08,500
is expected to be arriving
in Japan today.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,466
Recently admitted into
"Hagun Academy,"

4
00:00:10,566 --> 00:00:13,133
with the highest recorded
score in the prestigious

5
00:00:13,233 --> 00:00:14,766
Tokyo Chivalry's history,

6
00:00:14,866 --> 00:00:17,966
she's been said to be among
the strongest and most gifted...

7
00:00:18,066 --> 00:00:20,200
(slight crowd uproar)

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,333
Reporter:
We're seeing her now...!

9
00:00:21,433 --> 00:00:23,700
Crimson Princess!
Princess Stella!

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,366
Your Highness! Tell us
how it feels to be in...

11
00:00:29,633 --> 00:00:33,666
Ikki:
Some people will tell
you that life is unfair.

12
00:00:33,766 --> 00:00:36,833
They'll tell you it's because
what you were born with

13
00:00:36,933 --> 00:00:38,600
is what you end with.

14
00:00:39,466 --> 00:00:42,000
(crowd chatter)

15
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:42,633
(frustrated sigh)

16
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:46,033
Kurono:
Well‐ Miss Vermillion,
Welcome to Tokyo.

17
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:49,500
Thank you‐ Director.
I'm glad to be here.

18
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,033
(car driving off)

19
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:55,166
Ikki:
Gifted or ungifted.

20
00:00:55,266 --> 00:00:58,066
Your place in the pecking order
is decided for you

21
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:00,366
the very moment you're born.

22
00:01:00,466 --> 00:01:03,333
We raise the "gifted" up
to places the "ungifted"

23
00:01:03,433 --> 00:01:05,400
are not allowed to reach...

24
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,833
to places they can never
dream of reaching.

25
00:01:07,933 --> 00:01:10,733
(panting)

26
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:12,333
(sigh)

27
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,133
But does it always
have to be this way?

28
00:01:17,233 --> 00:01:19,700
(wind whipping)

29
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,100
Ryoma:
Does it frustrate you kid?

30
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,066
Does it upset you‐
to be the weakest one?

31
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:27,533
That's good, hold on
to that feeling.

32
00:01:27,633 --> 00:01:32,233
It's proof. That feeling means
that you are not yet ready...

33
00:01:33,033 --> 00:01:35,066
to give up on yourself.

34
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:40,400
(jacket whipping)

35
00:01:41,966 --> 00:01:44,433
Come to me, Intetsu!

36
00:01:45,933 --> 00:01:46,933
Blazers:

37
00:01:47,033 --> 00:01:51,000
those who can manifest a weapon
forged from their own soul...

38
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,233
and use it to wield
extraordinary powers...

39
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:56,433
(sword swinging)

40
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,733
Ikki:
Blazers approved by the
international organization,

41
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:02,133
are known as
Magical Knights.

42
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,900
I, Ikki Kurogane...

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,400
...aspire to be one of them.

44
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,766
Hm?

45
00:02:23,866 --> 00:02:26,400
(footsteps)

46
00:02:30,466 --> 00:02:32,066
(gasp)

47
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:39,233
(gasp)

48
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:39,666
Hold on.

49
00:02:39,766 --> 00:02:41,900
I already know
what you're going to say.

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,900
I'm not... going to pretend
I didn't see what I just saw...

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,066
So how's this?!

52
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:50,133
I'll get naked...
and we'll call it even!

53
00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:53,466
(frightened suttering)

54
00:02:53,566 --> 00:02:55,400
NOOOOOOOO!

55
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,100
(slap)
NOOOOOOOO!

56
00:03:01,233 --> 00:03:04,000
Kurono:
As you already know‐
the Hagun Academy

57
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,566
is one of the
highest‐ranked institutions

58
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:10,133
among all the
chivalry schools in Japan.

59
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:13,433
At the prestigious
Seven Star Sword Art Festival,

60
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:15,800
where the strongest of
students compete,

61
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,500
Aspiring Magical Knights
from our school have won
almost every year.

62
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,600
Unfortunately,
over the past few years,

63
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,200
our record has
been slipping.

64
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,400
I accepted the
post of director,

65
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,000
in order to rebuild
this academy.

66
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,300
And on day one...

67
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,066
Kurono:
I have to deal with something
as asinine as a peeping tom...

68
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:40,200
I... I know...
just an accident, though!

69
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,966
Kurogane‐ you peeked
at a girl with her clothes off,

70
00:03:43,066 --> 00:03:44,966
and then proceeded
to remove your own.

71
00:03:45,066 --> 00:03:46,633
You call this an accident?

72
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:47,666
Well‐ maybe
fifty‐fifty?

73
00:03:47,766 --> 00:03:51,266
I mean‐ I was really only
trying to... be a gentleman...

74
00:03:51,366 --> 00:03:53,600
I see‐ so you were...
being a gentleman...

75
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,600
Well yeah, I mean I'm not
like a creep or anything...

76
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,066
Well‐ that's
good to hear.

77
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,000
Let's see you
be a gentleman...

78
00:03:59,100 --> 00:03:59,966
Let's see you
be a gentleman...
(door opens)

79
00:04:00,066 --> 00:04:02,133
(door opens)

80
00:04:02,233 --> 00:04:04,966
Ikki:
(surprised gasp)
Miss Stella Vermillion!

81
00:04:05,066 --> 00:04:05,633
(shocked gasp)

82
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:09,300
I uh... I'm sorry that
I surprised you earlier.

83
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,866
I swear, I didn't
do it on purpose.

84
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:13,566
(indignant scoff)

85
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:16,233
Ikki:
I accept full
responsibility.

86
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:19,066
I'll take whatever
punishment you see fit.

87
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:22,333
What is your name?

88
00:04:22,433 --> 00:04:23,066
Um...

89
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,833
My name is Ikki...

90
00:04:24,933 --> 00:04:26,966
How noble
of you Ikki.

91
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:28,900
There's no need for us
to turn this into an

92
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,633
international incident.

93
00:04:30,733 --> 00:04:35,000
In light of your apology,
I will show you My mercy.

94
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,000
Thank you.

95
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,633
You may now throw yourself
upon your sword.

96
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:39,166
Eh...?

97
00:04:39,266 --> 00:04:41,233
(innocent giggle)

98
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,933
That's a...
joke... isn't it...?

99
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:46,166
It's no joke‐ I have
made a great compromise.

100
00:04:46,266 --> 00:04:48,066
Your compromise is
for me to kill myself?!

101
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,933
"Whatever punishment,"
you said!

102
00:04:50,033 --> 00:04:52,666
It's a figure of speech!
And it was an accident!

103
00:04:52,766 --> 00:04:53,333
(offended gasp)

104
00:04:53,433 --> 00:04:56,300
I'm supposed to pay with
my life for such a little thing!

105
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,133
"Such a little..."?!
(angry realization)

106
00:04:58,233 --> 00:05:01,266
Ikki:
I mean‐ so what? So I saw
you in your underwear!

107
00:05:01,366 --> 00:05:04,800
And now what? I have
to disembowel myself...?

108
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,000
Huh?

109
00:05:07,866 --> 00:05:09,133
Uh... I...

110
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:09,433
Bye, now.

111
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:10,233
Bye, now.
Huh?! Wait, Director...!

112
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,200
Huh?! Wait, Director...!

113
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,333
Prepare yourself.

114
00:05:12,433 --> 00:05:14,466
You disrespectful,
creepy, crude,

115
00:05:14,566 --> 00:05:16,566
perverted
little commoner...

116
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:19,566
I will turn you into
ashes all by myself!

117
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,133
(flames rage)
(fire alarm sounds)

118
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:23,600
Ikki:
(screams)

119
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,166
Wait, Miss Stella!
Calm down!

120
00:05:26,266 --> 00:05:30,533
You snuck into my room,
and defiled me with your eyes.

121
00:05:30,633 --> 00:05:31,966
How dare you!

122
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:33,966
"Defiled..."?!

123
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:34,633
(denying whimper)

124
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:37,866
I saw the look in your eyes as
you were staring at me!

125
00:05:37,966 --> 00:05:42,100
You're not sorry! You liked it
and you're just mocking me!

126
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,700
Yes I saw you...
but it... was...uh...

127
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,300
(growling)

128
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,000
It was because I've never seen
anyone... so beautiful!

129
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,600
Huh?

130
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,566
(fire sprinkler starts)

131
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:57,466
(magic fireball ithers)

132
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,633
Y‐you know it's very rude
to just come out
and tell a princess

133
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:03,266
that she's beautiful without
any c‐c‐consideration for...

134
00:06:03,366 --> 00:06:05,900
(groans)
...I mean there
are rules...

135
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,100
What is it?

136
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,700
Well, earlier, you
said "your room..."

137
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,366
But that's
actually my room...

138
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:14,500
(shocked gasp)
If you think you're
being funny...

139
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,100
Oh, by the way,
I forgot to tell you,

140
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,033
...you two are
going to be roommates...

141
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:20,766
Starting today.

142
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,266
Stella & Ikki:
HUUUUUH?!

143
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,166
Kurono:
See? It's official.

144
00:06:27,266 --> 00:06:28,866
I have a
question.

145
00:06:28,966 --> 00:06:29,500
Hmmm?

146
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,966
Usually roommates are students
of the same rank, right?

147
00:06:33,066 --> 00:06:35,166
Then why is
Stella with me?

148
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:37,866
She's a Rank A
and I got flunked.

149
00:06:37,966 --> 00:06:40,100
WHAT? What do you
mean you "got flunked?"

150
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,233
Mhm. I'm a Rank F...

151
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:45,866
The only superpower I can use is
a minimal physical enhancement.

152
00:06:45,966 --> 00:06:49,266
My magical power... is about
one tenth of the average.

153
00:06:49,366 --> 00:06:52,266
Other ability scores are
also all at the lowest level...

154
00:06:52,366 --> 00:06:54,700
earned him the nickname
"The Worst One."

155
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,133
Kurono:
Literally, he is the weakest
student at this academy.

156
00:06:58,233 --> 00:06:59,766
"The Worst One."

157
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:03,400
Kurono:
See kids, this is what they
call a "teachable moment."

158
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,633
Kurogane is totally
and completely inferior...

159
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:10,000
Vermillion is totally
and completely superior...

160
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,033
Sounds perfect,
doesn't it?

161
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:14,266
That makes
no sense at all.
B‐B‐B‐But what if there's some
sort of accident or something?

162
00:07:14,366 --> 00:07:16,700
B‐B‐B‐But what if there's some
sort of accident or something?

163
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,866
Oh? What kind of "accident"
are you thinking of?

164
00:07:19,966 --> 00:07:22,633
Well... I
mean it's...

165
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,600
We have plenty of male & female
pairings on this campus.

166
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,466
You object? You can
always quit the academy.

167
00:07:28,566 --> 00:07:29,566
(catches breath)

168
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:30,800
(sighs)

169
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,066
Okay fine...
here's how it is.

170
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,266
If you and I are going
to live together...

171
00:07:35,366 --> 00:07:37,500
then I have three
conditions.

172
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,000
Okay...

173
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,566
Stella:
You may not
speak to me.

174
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:39,833
(groan)

175
00:07:39,933 --> 00:07:41,066
You may not
open your eyes.

176
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:41,733
(annoyed groan)

177
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:42,500
You may
not breathe...

178
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,566
(alarmed groan)
If you like, I'll just
fall down dead right now.

179
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,533
If you can stick
with the rules...

180
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,366
you may live
in front of the room.

181
00:07:49,466 --> 00:07:50,833
I can't be
inside the room?!

182
00:07:50,933 --> 00:07:52,533
What, you
can't do it?

183
00:07:52,633 --> 00:07:54,466
Of course not!
At least let me breathe!

184
00:07:54,566 --> 00:07:57,933
No way! You're thinking about
breathing my aroma, pervert!

185
00:07:58,033 --> 00:07:58,766
Then I'll breathe with my mouth!

186
00:07:58,866 --> 00:08:01,933
Nuh‐uh! You just want to taste
the precious air that I breathe,

187
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:02,833
you little deviant!

188
00:08:02,933 --> 00:08:03,566
I didn't even
think of...!

189
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,600
If you don't like it,
quit the school!

190
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,633
You're freaking
me out!

191
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:08,900
Alright, let's just
take a breath...

192
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,500
Chivalry is about deciding your
own destiny with your sword.

193
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,033
Isn't it?

194
00:08:14,133 --> 00:08:17,366
So we should let our
abilities do the talking?

195
00:08:17,466 --> 00:08:20,000
Kurono:
Exactly. You can have
a mock battle...

196
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,566
and whoever wins decides
the rules of your room.

197
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:26,000
Hm. I suppose
that sounds fair.

198
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,833
What do you say,
Miss Stella?

199
00:08:27,933 --> 00:08:28,700
Umm...

200
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,766
You'll have to forgive me
if I'm being blunt...

201
00:08:31,866 --> 00:08:33,466
But how are you‐
a rank "F"‐

202
00:08:33,566 --> 00:08:35,300
going to beat me‐
a rank "A?"

203
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,733
Takes more than "rank"
to decide a battle...

204
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:40,633
And besides I've really
been practicing a lot!

205
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:44,800
(pouty sigh)
Alright fine. I'll let you
have your little battle.

206
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,266
Stella:
But if we're gonna do this,
it's not just the
"rules of the room"

207
00:08:48,366 --> 00:08:50,300
that are on the table anymore.

208
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:50,733
Uh?

209
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:54,100
The loser will obey the winner
for the rest of his life!

210
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,933
And no matter how
humiliating it is...

211
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:59,333
Stella:
he will serve his mistress
like a loyal dog!

212
00:08:59,433 --> 00:09:01,266
You might be taking this
a little too far...

213
00:09:01,366 --> 00:09:04,900
That... is... the... deal!

214
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,066
O...kay...?

215
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,600
Very good then.

216
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,933
(catch reactions)

217
00:09:11,033 --> 00:09:12,566
You two had better get ready.

218
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:17,566
One hour from now,
the mock battle will begin
on Training Field Four!

219
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:18,400
(intimidating growl)

220
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,066
(confused reaction)
(intimidating growl)

221
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:19,400
(disgusted reaction)

222
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,600
(nervous laugh)
(disgusted reaction)

223
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,300
(birds chirping)

224
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,400
Stella:
(annoyed scoff)
Seriously...

225
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,266
What do I have
to do this for?

226
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,666
"I've really been
practicing a lot," he says.

227
00:09:36,966 --> 00:09:38,400
Stella, my love.

228
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,600
You don't have to put
yourself through all of this...

229
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,833
I do, Mother.

230
00:09:42,933 --> 00:09:47,633
A little nation such as ours has
to have a really strong
Magical Knight.

231
00:09:47,733 --> 00:09:52,033
Stella:
I promise‐ I am going to learn
how to control this power.

232
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,100
And to get there...

233
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,000
And to get there...
I'll do what I have to.

234
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:03,300
I'm going to crush you...
Ikki Kurogane.

235
00:10:08,044 --> 00:10:09,311
(students talking)

236
00:10:09,411 --> 00:10:11,777
Female Student A:
Look! It's the
Crimson Princess!

237
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:13,611
Male Student A:
She's a princess
and a genius!

238
00:10:13,711 --> 00:10:16,177
Female Student B:
Can you even imagine
what her life is like?

239
00:10:16,277 --> 00:10:17,411
Female Student C:
Yeah, but why is she gonna...?

240
00:10:17,511 --> 00:10:21,944
Male Student B:
I know, the mock battle?
And the Worst One, to boot.

241
00:10:28,877 --> 00:10:31,144
Kurono:
I was surprised
you said "yes" to this.

242
00:10:31,244 --> 00:10:33,944
Well‐ she's someone
I have to beat eventually.

243
00:10:34,044 --> 00:10:37,111
"Beat her," huh?
I like your optimism...

244
00:10:37,211 --> 00:10:41,177
You said I have to win at the
Seven Star Sword Art Festival.

245
00:10:41,277 --> 00:10:41,511
(sigh)

246
00:10:41,611 --> 00:10:45,677
Because if I win,
I can graduate even though
my ability score is low.

247
00:10:45,777 --> 00:10:47,911
I'll hold
you to that.

248
00:10:48,011 --> 00:10:48,777
Heh.

249
00:10:48,877 --> 00:10:52,944
And she's sure to compete.
So this has to happen.

250
00:10:53,044 --> 00:10:55,311
Ikki:
Whether it's sooner or later.

251
00:10:56,477 --> 00:10:57,377
Oh, I made it!

252
00:10:57,477 --> 00:11:01,044
I just came to turn in an
application, and I
get to see this!

253
00:11:01,144 --> 00:11:02,711
What luck!

254
00:11:02,811 --> 00:11:04,744
Oh...! She's here!

255
00:11:07,544 --> 00:11:11,111
Ikki:
Hi Miss Stella.
You all set?

256
00:11:11,211 --> 00:11:15,411
I heard about you. I heard
your ability score is so low,

257
00:11:15,511 --> 00:11:18,644
you don't even qualify
to take any real combat classes.

258
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:21,844
Stella:
Maybe it'd be safer for you
if you just stopped trying

259
00:11:21,944 --> 00:11:24,744
to become
a Magical Knight.

260
00:11:24,844 --> 00:11:26,611
Ikki:
You might be right.

261
00:11:26,711 --> 00:11:29,844
Still... I am not
quitting this match.

262
00:11:29,944 --> 00:11:32,011
Are you one of those people
who think hard work

263
00:11:32,111 --> 00:11:33,911
can stand up
against real talent?

264
00:11:34,011 --> 00:11:35,577
Stella:
You're wrong.

265
00:11:35,677 --> 00:11:38,177
That is exactly
what I believe.

266
00:11:40,211 --> 00:11:41,611
(armor clanging)

267
00:11:41,711 --> 00:11:43,577
Damn it... DAMN IT!

268
00:11:43,677 --> 00:11:47,877
Fallen Fighter:
All this hard work, and I'm
still no match for her talent...

269
00:11:49,644 --> 00:11:51,177
Like I don't work hard...

270
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,577
who the hell do you
think you are?

271
00:11:53,677 --> 00:11:54,711
Huh?

272
00:11:54,811 --> 00:11:55,877
Let's get started.

273
00:11:55,977 --> 00:11:59,011
Director? We are ready
and await your command.

274
00:11:59,111 --> 00:12:01,644
Very well then‐
the mock battle will now begin.

275
00:12:01,744 --> 00:12:05,544
Kurono:
As you all know, a mock battle
is a non‐lethal competition.

276
00:12:05,644 --> 00:12:08,244
The purpose is to drain
your opponent's strength.

277
00:12:08,344 --> 00:12:12,477
Weapons are to be deployed
in phantom‐form only.

278
00:12:12,577 --> 00:12:14,677
(main lights shut off)

279
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:17,077
Come to me, Intetsu.

280
00:12:17,777 --> 00:12:19,877
(magical electricity)

281
00:12:19,977 --> 00:12:23,344
(sword being drawn)

282
00:12:23,444 --> 00:12:25,611
(sword swinging)

283
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:28,111
Stella:
Serve my will, Laevatein!

284
00:12:28,211 --> 00:12:31,744
(eruption, fire spinning)

285
00:12:31,844 --> 00:12:32,811
(sword swings)

286
00:12:32,911 --> 00:12:35,011
(sword clangs)

287
00:12:35,111 --> 00:12:35,977
(buzzer)

288
00:12:36,077 --> 00:12:37,744
Computer voice:
Let's go ahead!

289
00:12:37,844 --> 00:12:38,611
(fire rising)

290
00:12:38,711 --> 00:12:40,111
(battle cry)

291
00:12:40,211 --> 00:12:40,777
(readies sword)

292
00:12:40,877 --> 00:12:41,777
(loud impact)

293
00:12:41,877 --> 00:12:43,377
You're smart to dodge.

294
00:12:43,477 --> 00:12:44,877
My Dragon Breath
fire burns at...

295
00:12:44,977 --> 00:12:47,144
around 3,000
degrees Celsius!

296
00:12:47,244 --> 00:12:49,444
Taking it head‐on would've
turned you to ashes!

297
00:12:49,544 --> 00:12:51,411
(sword swings)
(fire roars)

298
00:12:51,511 --> 00:12:52,077
(exerting force)

299
00:12:52,177 --> 00:12:53,277
(swords clang)
(explosion)

300
00:12:53,377 --> 00:12:56,411
(footsteps)
(swords clanging)

301
00:12:56,511 --> 00:12:57,044
(exerting force)

302
00:12:57,144 --> 00:12:58,811
Male Student:
Whoa, man...

303
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,011
Nene:
Just what I thought.

304
00:13:00,111 --> 00:13:02,177
Sometimes I can't
believe you, Ku‐chan.

305
00:13:02,277 --> 00:13:05,111
You really should tell me
about these things‐ you know.

306
00:13:05,211 --> 00:13:07,877
You always know it's
happening anyway. Why bother?

307
00:13:07,977 --> 00:13:10,177
(giggle)
That's very true.

308
00:13:10,277 --> 00:13:12,977
But this is quite...
unexpected‐ isn't it?

309
00:13:13,077 --> 00:13:15,644
I never imagined that
Stella Vermillion

310
00:13:15,744 --> 00:13:17,644
would consent to
such a thing...

311
00:13:17,744 --> 00:13:19,711
(exerting force)
(swords clashing)

312
00:13:19,811 --> 00:13:20,777
Is he...?

313
00:13:20,877 --> 00:13:22,944
Stella:
fending me off...?

314
00:13:23,877 --> 00:13:25,911
You're pretty gifted
at running away.

315
00:13:26,011 --> 00:13:27,677
I'm... observing you...

316
00:13:27,777 --> 00:13:29,977
The sword technique
that you've been using...

317
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:34,277
I see it. Not just your
talent... Your hard work too.

318
00:13:34,377 --> 00:13:35,944
(surprised gasp)

319
00:13:36,044 --> 00:13:37,877
You've got a
pretty good eye...

320
00:13:37,977 --> 00:13:39,544
But the technique
I've been using...

321
00:13:39,644 --> 00:13:42,444
is going to be harder
than that to see through!

322
00:13:42,544 --> 00:13:44,777
No. I already have...

323
00:13:46,277 --> 00:13:46,811
(loud clash)

324
00:13:46,911 --> 00:13:49,544
My technique!
How could you possibly...?

325
00:13:49,644 --> 00:13:51,077
(jumps back)
(swords clash)

326
00:13:51,777 --> 00:13:52,644
How are you...

327
00:13:52,744 --> 00:13:55,344
How are you using my
technique against me?

328
00:13:56,311 --> 00:13:57,244
When I was a kid...

329
00:13:57,344 --> 00:13:59,911
nobody ever wanted
to teach me anything...

330
00:14:00,011 --> 00:14:03,111
So I had to teach myself
how to see!

331
00:14:03,211 --> 00:14:05,244
When you see through the
branches and leaves to the root,

332
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,311
Ikki:
you'll understand
the truth.

333
00:14:07,411 --> 00:14:08,544
And you can overcome!

334
00:14:08,644 --> 00:14:10,377
(rocks crumbling)

335
00:14:10,477 --> 00:14:11,444
Uh!

336
00:14:13,344 --> 00:14:13,844
(sword rattles)

337
00:14:13,944 --> 00:14:16,177
This is my sword technique.

338
00:14:16,277 --> 00:14:18,111
"Blade Steal."

339
00:14:18,211 --> 00:14:21,011
Alright smart guy,
let's see you steal a feint.

340
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:21,844
(battle cry)

341
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,177
(sword whiffs)

342
00:14:23,277 --> 00:14:23,544
Uh!

343
00:14:23,644 --> 00:14:24,411
(battle cry)

344
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,277
Your swordsmanship
is slipping.

345
00:14:26,377 --> 00:14:26,577
Huh?

346
00:14:26,677 --> 00:14:27,944
(loud clang)

347
00:14:28,044 --> 00:14:28,811
No way!

348
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:30,311
A wild attack isn't
like you...

349
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,677
and losing control
is a fatal error!

350
00:14:32,777 --> 00:14:33,911
(swords clash)

351
00:14:34,011 --> 00:14:35,144
Huh?

352
00:14:35,244 --> 00:14:35,777
(battle yell)

353
00:14:35,877 --> 00:14:37,977
(sword impacts)
(fire flowing)

354
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:38,977
Female Student:
Is this it?

355
00:14:39,077 --> 00:14:40,677
Male Student:
How could a
Rank A...?

356
00:14:40,777 --> 00:14:41,877
No, look!

357
00:14:41,977 --> 00:14:42,277
Uh?

358
00:14:42,377 --> 00:14:43,477
(energy flowing)

359
00:14:43,577 --> 00:14:45,277
(sword swinging)
(steps back)

360
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,977
It doesn't look good...

361
00:14:49,077 --> 00:14:51,344
to win like this.

362
00:14:51,444 --> 00:14:54,311
Ikki:
You knew that Intetsu would not
be able to hurt you at all.

363
00:14:54,411 --> 00:14:57,311
And in spite of that,
you chose a sword battle.

364
00:14:57,411 --> 00:15:00,544
Stella:
Yes... so I could beat
you with my sword,

365
00:15:00,644 --> 00:15:02,011
and let everyone
see for themselves

366
00:15:02,111 --> 00:15:04,811
that there's more to
me than just my talent.

367
00:15:04,911 --> 00:15:06,377
But I will admit...

368
00:15:06,477 --> 00:15:08,944
this battle... the only
reason I'll be able to win

369
00:15:09,044 --> 00:15:11,844
was certainly because
of my magic ability.

370
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:14,611
Stella:
So with the
greatest due respect...

371
00:15:14,711 --> 00:15:16,977
I will defeat you.

372
00:15:18,277 --> 00:15:20,344
It's true...
that I don't have the gift

373
00:15:20,444 --> 00:15:21,744
to be a Magical Knight.

374
00:15:21,844 --> 00:15:23,511
Pierce the blue sky,
Ikki:
But I won't back down.

375
00:15:23,611 --> 00:15:25,744
flame of purgatory!
The vow that
makes me who I am...

376
00:15:25,844 --> 00:15:28,244
will not allow me
to give up on myself.

377
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,244
That's why I thought about it...
what I need to do

378
00:15:30,344 --> 00:15:31,444
Burn it all...!
in order for the weakest
to beat the strongest.

379
00:15:31,544 --> 00:15:32,811
Calusaritio Salamander!
in order for the weakest to beat
the strongest.

380
00:15:32,911 --> 00:15:33,077
Calusaritio Salamander!

381
00:15:33,177 --> 00:15:34,377
Calusaritio Salamander!
And this is it...

382
00:15:34,477 --> 00:15:36,477
Itto Shura!

383
00:15:36,577 --> 00:15:37,811
Where did he... go?

384
00:15:37,911 --> 00:15:39,444
(gasps)
(exerts force)

385
00:15:39,544 --> 00:15:40,311
(whoosh)

386
00:15:40,411 --> 00:15:41,911
Huh? He's gotten faster!

387
00:15:42,011 --> 00:15:43,944
His power is
getting stonger...

388
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:45,211
Not getting stronger.

389
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,877
I'm just using it
with everything I've got!

390
00:15:47,977 --> 00:15:50,177
You'll still lose!

391
00:15:50,677 --> 00:15:51,311
Impossible!

392
00:15:51,411 --> 00:15:54,811
Concentrating my living energy
into one minute and using it
all.

393
00:15:54,911 --> 00:15:57,211
That's the Noble Art
that I created.

394
00:15:57,311 --> 00:16:00,244
With all my strength I will
defeat all of yours!

395
00:16:00,344 --> 00:16:00,944
(slash)

396
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:05,111
(magic disperses)

397
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:06,911
Wha...?
(gasp)

398
00:16:07,011 --> 00:16:08,911
Uh...
(sword clangs)

399
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:11,944
For a mediocre man
to defeat a genius...

400
00:16:12,044 --> 00:16:15,077
he... must
become... a demon.

401
00:16:15,177 --> 00:16:16,311
That's it!

402
00:16:16,411 --> 00:16:19,677
Kurono:
The winner...
is Ikki Kurogane!

403
00:16:19,777 --> 00:16:21,711
(amazed gasps)

404
00:16:24,377 --> 00:16:25,211
Well!

405
00:16:25,311 --> 00:16:29,411
This year's selection match is
going to be terribly exciting.

406
00:16:29,511 --> 00:16:32,744
(panting)

407
00:16:35,811 --> 00:16:38,111
(birds chirping)

408
00:16:38,777 --> 00:16:39,644
(door opens)

409
00:16:39,744 --> 00:16:40,611
Huh?

410
00:16:40,711 --> 00:16:43,411
Vermillion.
How are you feeling?

411
00:16:43,511 --> 00:16:45,711
You know‐
I'd almost forgotten...

412
00:16:45,811 --> 00:16:49,277
What it's like...
to lose a match like that.

413
00:16:49,744 --> 00:16:50,344
How is he?

414
00:16:50,444 --> 00:16:52,977
To consume all that
power in one minute...

415
00:16:53,077 --> 00:16:55,044
That's something you can
only do once a day.

416
00:16:55,144 --> 00:16:57,311
He used everything he had
to beat you...

417
00:16:57,411 --> 00:16:59,511
and he's in much
rougher shape than you are.

418
00:16:59,611 --> 00:17:02,311
But... you'll be glad to know
he's going to live.

419
00:17:02,411 --> 00:17:06,211
Madame Director...
what's the story with him?

420
00:17:06,311 --> 00:17:07,711
What... story?

421
00:17:07,811 --> 00:17:09,211
Don't play
dumb with me!

422
00:17:09,311 --> 00:17:12,944
Him being a Rank F
doesn't make any sense.

423
00:17:13,044 --> 00:17:16,911
Your rank... is based solely on
your ability as a Blazer...

424
00:17:17,011 --> 00:17:18,111
Kurono:
Your combat skills,

425
00:17:18,211 --> 00:17:20,477
your swordplay‐
your physical prowess,

426
00:17:20,577 --> 00:17:22,177
are not subject
to evaluation.

427
00:17:22,277 --> 00:17:24,677
As it is, our current
system simply can't

428
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:27,277
make a proper evaluation
of Kurogane.

429
00:17:27,377 --> 00:17:30,311
Yeah... but failing him?

430
00:17:30,411 --> 00:17:31,977
(sighs)

431
00:17:32,077 --> 00:17:35,244
Listen‐ it's all
very complicated...

432
00:17:35,344 --> 00:17:39,711
Or... maybe it's really
not very complicated at all...

433
00:17:40,511 --> 00:17:42,311
One thing
I can say...

434
00:17:42,411 --> 00:17:44,977
...is that life has been
very unfair to Kurogane.

435
00:17:45,077 --> 00:17:47,011
He's had plenty
of reasons to give up,

436
00:17:47,111 --> 00:17:49,744
but he's never stopped
pushing himself to improve.

437
00:17:49,844 --> 00:17:54,511
Kurono:
That's... a man
no "system" can measure.

438
00:17:54,611 --> 00:17:57,511
Princess... I asked
you this morning...

439
00:17:57,611 --> 00:18:00,144
"What made you
want to study abroad?"

440
00:18:00,244 --> 00:18:04,244
In my home country...
I am in a "prison of genius."

441
00:18:04,344 --> 00:18:08,344
I don't have the freedom
to try something and fail...

442
00:18:08,444 --> 00:18:09,944
Princess Vermillion,

443
00:18:10,044 --> 00:18:13,011
I think there's a lot
you can learn from Kurogane.

444
00:18:13,111 --> 00:18:14,177
Kurono:
I have a feeling...

445
00:18:14,277 --> 00:18:17,844
that he will be a valuable
expenditure of your time.

446
00:18:24,744 --> 00:18:29,644
(snoring)

447
00:18:29,744 --> 00:18:32,211
(stirs)
(sheets rustle)

448
00:18:35,377 --> 00:18:36,277
(fleshy impact)

449
00:18:36,377 --> 00:18:39,477
Um... oh...

450
00:18:41,011 --> 00:18:45,077
This is... this is what
a man's back looks like...

451
00:18:45,644 --> 00:18:45,777
(stirs)

452
00:18:45,877 --> 00:18:47,144
(surprised yelp)
(stirs)

453
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,611
Oh! Oh my God!

454
00:18:50,711 --> 00:18:52,977
(Stella struggling)
(bed creaking)

455
00:18:53,077 --> 00:18:57,144
Stella:
Maybe if I could...
I could just... Oh God....

456
00:18:58,244 --> 00:18:59,777
Mm...

457
00:19:00,877 --> 00:19:02,477
(exerts force)

458
00:19:02,577 --> 00:19:03,911
(hand slips free)

459
00:19:04,011 --> 00:19:05,844
(embarrased gasp)

460
00:19:11,611 --> 00:19:13,444
Stella:
(shaky breath)

461
00:19:15,177 --> 00:19:19,377
NO STELLA! You are a princess
and this is totally disgraceful!

462
00:19:19,477 --> 00:19:20,744
But he is so...

463
00:19:20,844 --> 00:19:23,377
(sleeping)

464
00:19:23,477 --> 00:19:25,844
Hang on... this guy
totally walked in on me

465
00:19:25,944 --> 00:19:27,344
and saw me
in my underwear...

466
00:19:27,444 --> 00:19:30,277
Stella:
So this just makes
us even, right...?

467
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:33,544
(sighs)
This is... what a
man's body feels like...

468
00:19:33,644 --> 00:19:34,977
(ding)
(sparkle)

469
00:19:35,077 --> 00:19:38,444
Oh my God! I've never
felt anything like this...!

470
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:39,711
(gasp)

471
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:41,811
(panting)

472
00:19:41,911 --> 00:19:45,744
What is... what is
happening to me...?

473
00:19:45,844 --> 00:19:49,011
Yeah... That was going
to be my next question.

474
00:19:49,111 --> 00:19:49,844
Uh...

475
00:19:49,944 --> 00:19:53,611
Miss Stella...
what are you doing?

476
00:19:53,711 --> 00:19:55,244
(embarrassed squeal)
(loud thud)

477
00:19:55,344 --> 00:19:57,344
Owww!

478
00:19:59,677 --> 00:20:01,411
Ikki:
Okay. There ya go.

479
00:20:02,477 --> 00:20:04,011
Uh... thank you...

480
00:20:04,111 --> 00:20:06,877
I'm just glad it
wasn't a concussion.

481
00:20:07,977 --> 00:20:09,544
Stella:
I'm sorry.

482
00:20:09,644 --> 00:20:10,677
Hmm?

483
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:12,077
I despised everyone
at home because

484
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:14,344
they put this
label on me...

485
00:20:14,444 --> 00:20:17,744
And then I did the same
exact thing to you.

486
00:20:17,844 --> 00:20:20,444
I couldn't see you
for what you were.

487
00:20:20,544 --> 00:20:21,844
If I'd tried harder,

488
00:20:21,944 --> 00:20:24,011
I wouldn't have
freaked out like that...

489
00:20:24,111 --> 00:20:27,177
Well, I'm done
freaking out... Ikki!

490
00:20:28,777 --> 00:20:30,077
Okay.
(box closes)

491
00:20:30,177 --> 00:20:32,011
So now you're...

492
00:20:32,111 --> 00:20:34,544
...you're gonna be,
like, my servant, right?

493
00:20:34,644 --> 00:20:34,711
Huh?

494
00:20:34,811 --> 00:20:37,511
"The loser will obey
the winner for the rest
of her life," remember?

495
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,444
"The loser will obey
the winner for the rest
of her life," remember?
Oh!

496
00:20:38,544 --> 00:20:40,277
No wait I didn't think
we were taking that seriously!

497
00:20:40,377 --> 00:20:41,944
The deal was‐ you do
what I say, right...?
No wait I didn't think
we were taking that seriously!

498
00:20:42,044 --> 00:20:42,944
The deal was‐ you do
what I say, right...?

499
00:20:43,044 --> 00:20:44,677
Ikki:
"Anything..."?

500
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:45,344
Mmm...

501
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:49,244
Wait‐ anything?! There's no way
buddy! The deal is off!

502
00:20:49,344 --> 00:20:52,844
'Kay... so the Royal Vermillion
family is not so great

503
00:20:52,944 --> 00:20:55,411
at honoring treaties,
then, I guess...?

504
00:20:55,511 --> 00:20:55,877
(offended exhale)

505
00:20:55,977 --> 00:20:57,844
HOW DARE YOU SAY SUCH A THING!

506
00:20:57,944 --> 00:20:59,877
FINE! Then I'll be
your servant, or your dog,

507
00:20:59,977 --> 00:21:01,611
or whatever you want!

508
00:21:01,711 --> 00:21:03,777
Make me bend
to your evil wishes!

509
00:21:03,877 --> 00:21:06,111
Use me for your
villainous sexual desires!

510
00:21:06,211 --> 00:21:09,944
Pervert! Peasant!
I... hate you! Hmph!

511
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:12,644
(laughs)

512
00:21:12,744 --> 00:21:13,911
Stella:
What's so funny?!

513
00:21:14,011 --> 00:21:17,444
Okay then this is
your order... Miss Stella...

514
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:22,177
I order you to be my roommate.

515
00:21:22,277 --> 00:21:23,377
Huh?

516
00:21:23,477 --> 00:21:27,477
Miss Stella... I want us
to be closer‐ to be friends...

517
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:28,844
Um...! "Closer..." What...?

518
00:21:28,944 --> 00:21:29,944
I am a Princess!

519
00:21:30,044 --> 00:21:33,277
That is... just so
inappropriate...

520
00:21:33,377 --> 00:21:36,844
Well then I guess if
we can't be roommates...

521
00:21:36,944 --> 00:21:38,744
Ikki:
Then we should probably...
go talk to the Director...

522
00:21:38,844 --> 00:21:41,444
No... no I...
don't...

523
00:21:41,544 --> 00:21:42,877
Huh? "Don't" what?

524
00:21:42,977 --> 00:21:45,311
Let me be clear!
I made a deal.

525
00:21:45,411 --> 00:21:49,377
I will honor it‐ but I have
no desire to be "closer" to you!

526
00:21:49,477 --> 00:21:50,711
Stella:
Do you understand?

527
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:54,777
Heh. That's fair enough...
Miss Stella.

528
00:21:55,944 --> 00:21:57,811
(softens tone)

529
00:21:58,211 --> 00:21:59,444
Stella.

530
00:21:59,544 --> 00:22:00,311
Huh?

531
00:22:00,411 --> 00:22:04,277
It's just "Stella."
Or the agreement is off!

532
00:22:04,377 --> 00:22:04,911
(moved sigh)

533
00:22:05,011 --> 00:22:08,744
Okay... that's cool... "Stella."

534
00:22:08,844 --> 00:22:10,844
Well alright then.

535
00:22:11,411 --> 00:22:12,344
Uh?

536
00:22:12,444 --> 00:22:13,811
Heh.

537
00:22:15,411 --> 00:22:17,277
(fist bump)
