1
00:00:03,475 --> 00:00:05,452
Shizuku:
I was born a daughter
of the Kurogane family...

2
00:00:05,552 --> 00:00:09,818
I demonstrated talent
as a blazer‐ beginning in
my early childhood...

3
00:00:09,918 --> 00:00:12,952
I could've been as selfish
as I wanted to be.

4
00:00:13,052 --> 00:00:16,185
Children can twist justice
in the face of power...

5
00:00:16,285 --> 00:00:19,885
Adults permit transgressions
in the face of power...

6
00:00:19,985 --> 00:00:22,518
I realized when
I was quite young...

7
00:00:22,618 --> 00:00:24,752
that people disgust me.

8
00:00:24,852 --> 00:00:26,552
And I couldn't
reconcile...

9
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:28,952
the fact that I am
one of them.

10
00:00:29,385 --> 00:00:30,752
Oh!

11
00:00:34,752 --> 00:00:38,118
Ikki:
Shizuku...
you're wrong.

12
00:00:38,952 --> 00:00:40,018
Shizuku:
It was he...

13
00:00:40,118 --> 00:00:41,752
who taught me
what was wrong...

14
00:00:41,852 --> 00:00:44,452
and showed me
what was right...

15
00:00:44,552 --> 00:00:46,885
He never gave in
to any power.

16
00:00:48,485 --> 00:00:52,285
And finally...
I made the decision...

17
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,918
that no matter what happens...

18
00:00:54,018 --> 00:00:57,752
I would follow him...
my brother Ikki Kurogane.

19
00:00:59,185 --> 00:01:00,585
But...

20
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:02,685
I was too young
to understand...

21
00:01:02,785 --> 00:01:05,518
The real conditions
of his upbringing...

22
00:01:05,618 --> 00:01:09,485
or the winter of solitude
in which he spent his life.

23
00:01:09,585 --> 00:01:11,652
I understood nothing.

24
00:02:46,813 --> 00:02:47,901
What a bullshit article!

25
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,501
"Remaining survivor of
an ancient giant tribe"?

26
00:02:50,601 --> 00:02:54,101
It was a golem‐ and a golem's
not even really alive!

27
00:02:54,201 --> 00:02:54,734
Fair point.

28
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:57,934
Alice:
So you guys weren't able to find
out who was pulling the strings?

29
00:02:58,034 --> 00:03:00,501
No. After they
rescued us...

30
00:03:00,601 --> 00:03:04,567
the student council looked
into it but they came up dry.

31
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:05,967
So‐ Toka Todo...

32
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:08,501
tell me what
you thought of her...

33
00:03:08,601 --> 00:03:09,467
What was she like?

34
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:13,667
Well we... didn't get much
of a chance to talk...

35
00:03:13,767 --> 00:03:14,701
although...

36
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:17,334
she lives up
to her reputation.

37
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:19,301
Shizuku...

38
00:03:19,401 --> 00:03:23,234
she's going to fight her
tomorrow at the selection
match‐ isn't she?

39
00:03:23,334 --> 00:03:24,601
Yeah she is.

40
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:26,567
She's been having
mock battles...

41
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:28,767
with some lightning‐powered
upperclassmen.

42
00:03:28,867 --> 00:03:30,667
She said I
couldn't come.

43
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:33,134
Apparently‐ she finds me too
distracting...

44
00:03:33,234 --> 00:03:35,234
Stella:
Shizuku is a water user.

45
00:03:35,334 --> 00:03:38,234
So a lightning user is
the worst kind of enemy...

46
00:03:38,334 --> 00:03:41,234
Ah‐ but our little girl...
has ways around that.

47
00:03:41,334 --> 00:03:44,101
Alice:
Shizuku is a very
high‐level magic‐user.

48
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:47,401
She can create ultra‐pure water‐
free of any conductive elements.

49
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:50,334
Its electrical
conductivity is near zero.

50
00:03:50,434 --> 00:03:51,534
Which means...

51
00:03:51,634 --> 00:03:52,434
Ahh!

52
00:03:52,534 --> 00:03:53,167
Ahh!

53
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:54,234
Ahh!

54
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:57,034
Alice:
Lightning is useless against it.

55
00:04:00,067 --> 00:04:01,134
Stella:
Really...

56
00:04:01,234 --> 00:04:03,801
Well maybe Todo won't be
so hard after all.

57
00:04:03,901 --> 00:04:05,067
Shizuku might have a chance!

58
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:06,801
Yeah‐ her odds
are better...

59
00:04:06,901 --> 00:04:09,901
but it's still going to be
a very difficult match.

60
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:13,034
I'm... I'm
worried....

61
00:04:13,134 --> 00:04:13,967
Ikki...

62
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:16,134
Ikki:
I want her to win‐
of course,

63
00:04:16,234 --> 00:04:18,634
but I'm afraid she'll
push herself...

64
00:04:18,734 --> 00:04:22,034
I just hope she...
doesn't get hurt...

65
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:32,201
Stella:
Shizuku!
Hey, Shizuku!

66
00:04:32,301 --> 00:04:33,067
Ah!

67
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:36,101
Yes Princess?
Do you need something?

68
00:04:36,201 --> 00:04:38,401
No‐ it's really
nothing, but...

69
00:04:38,501 --> 00:04:40,334
I just... wanted
to make sure

70
00:04:40,434 --> 00:04:42,934
that you weren't too nervous
or anything like that...

71
00:04:43,034 --> 00:04:44,701
Well yes‐ I'm
moderately nervous‐

72
00:04:44,801 --> 00:04:48,667
because she's a stronger
opponent than I've ever
faced before...

73
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,734
But not so much that
it would affect my battle.

74
00:04:50,834 --> 00:04:55,534
Oh! I know! But... she's
student council president...

75
00:04:55,634 --> 00:04:56,801
Stella:
Ikki's worried‐ too.

76
00:04:56,901 --> 00:04:59,467
He says he doesn't want
you to push too hard...

77
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:00,367
He's worried?

78
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,101
Ah... no...

79
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:03,167
I just wanted to say
that I'd be at your battle

80
00:05:03,267 --> 00:05:05,201
to support you...
That's all!

81
00:05:06,301 --> 00:05:07,834
(door creaks and closes)

82
00:05:08,534 --> 00:05:09,834
Alice:
(sighs)

83
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:13,767
Bless her heart...
She is so awkward...

84
00:05:13,867 --> 00:05:17,067
Not easy bein' you...
is it dear?

85
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:20,434
Shizuku:
So...they're all
worried about me?

86
00:05:20,534 --> 00:05:23,767
Alice:
They can't help it. They just
saw the power of Raikiri

87
00:05:23,867 --> 00:05:26,367
in all its glory with
their very own eyes.

88
00:05:26,467 --> 00:05:31,734
Except... if it were Stella who
was about to step into the ring,

89
00:05:31,834 --> 00:05:34,134
my big brother wouldn't
be worried at all...

90
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:36,734
Shizuku:
He'd trust her
and support her...

91
00:05:36,834 --> 00:05:40,967
he sees her as his
partner... his equal...

92
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:44,201
But I'm not... strong enough
a knight for him to...

93
00:05:44,301 --> 00:05:46,267
think of me that way.

94
00:05:46,767 --> 00:05:48,567
Oh honey...

95
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:51,334
So I must... become
much stronger...

96
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:54,167
Shizuku:
The Kuroganes...
all hated my big brother,

97
00:05:54,267 --> 00:05:56,801
but eventually, he
got away from them.

98
00:05:56,901 --> 00:05:59,601
He had an easy smile
and an open heart.

99
00:05:59,701 --> 00:06:03,767
It took me too long to see...
that behind that smile of his...

100
00:06:03,867 --> 00:06:05,867
he hides incredible pain.

101
00:06:06,401 --> 00:06:08,034
And I decided...

102
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:11,801
If none of them could love him,
then I would be the one

103
00:06:11,901 --> 00:06:15,001
to love him enough
for all of them.

104
00:06:15,101 --> 00:06:17,401
That's why I needed
to be strong.

105
00:06:17,501 --> 00:06:21,467
Otherwise... I wouldn't
be able to keep him close.

106
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:23,067
And he'd be all alone...

107
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:26,234
Oh, sweetie...
I know...

108
00:06:26,334 --> 00:06:28,934
Shizuku:
But... I'm not
strong enough yet.

109
00:06:29,034 --> 00:06:32,267
My Big Brother is aiming for the
top of the Seven Stars.

110
00:06:32,367 --> 00:06:35,967
In order to get there, I have
to be as strong as Stella.

111
00:06:37,501 --> 00:06:39,001
When I battle her tomorrow...

112
00:06:39,101 --> 00:06:42,134
I will claim victory
over Toka Todo.

113
00:06:42,234 --> 00:06:45,967
And I will prove that
I am worthy of my brother...

114
00:06:46,067 --> 00:06:48,901
I will prove
my love for him.

115
00:06:56,601 --> 00:06:59,067
Mikazuki:
And... here's the fight
you've waited for!

116
00:06:59,167 --> 00:07:02,634
Combatant number one: She's
the sister of Ikki Kurogane,

117
00:07:02,734 --> 00:07:04,801
and the number two
freshman this year,

118
00:07:04,901 --> 00:07:07,067
right behind the
Crimson Princess.

119
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:08,801
With a record of
twelve‐for‐twelve,

120
00:07:08,901 --> 00:07:11,001
and her eye on
number thirteen...

121
00:07:11,101 --> 00:07:13,801
Here to demonstrate her
incredible combat prowess...

122
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:18,701
She's the witch
of the deep ocean,
Shizuku "Lorelei" Kurogane!

123
00:07:18,801 --> 00:07:19,401
(cheers and applause)

124
00:07:19,501 --> 00:07:22,401
And her opponent: she's
the student council president,

125
00:07:22,501 --> 00:07:24,167
and Hagun Academy's top‐seed...

126
00:07:24,267 --> 00:07:26,467
She's so fast that you
can't avoid her!

127
00:07:26,567 --> 00:07:29,701
She's so sharp that
you can't defend yourself!

128
00:07:29,801 --> 00:07:30,801
Will her golden lightning...

129
00:07:30,901 --> 00:07:33,401
bring down yet another
challenger today?!

130
00:07:33,501 --> 00:07:36,301
A top four finalist
at last year's Seven Star,

131
00:07:36,401 --> 00:07:38,967
and undefeated at
twelve‐for‐twelve...

132
00:07:39,067 --> 00:07:43,101
From the junior class,
it's Toka "Raikiri" Todo!

133
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:46,134
Mikazuki Tsukuyomi,
reporting for this match.

134
00:07:46,234 --> 00:07:48,801
And Commentary is provided
by Miss Nene Saikyo!

135
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:50,367
Yeah... hi...

136
00:07:53,901 --> 00:07:56,401
You're the strongest
I've ever faced.

137
00:07:56,501 --> 00:07:58,801
But... you
must fall...

138
00:07:58,901 --> 00:08:01,267
Shower me,
Yoi Shigure!

139
00:08:08,867 --> 00:08:11,134
Narukami, thunder.

140
00:08:24,101 --> 00:08:25,601
I'll show you
Big Brother...

141
00:08:25,701 --> 00:08:29,867
how much I've loved you for the
last five years of my life...

142
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,234
I will exceed
my limit.

143
00:08:32,334 --> 00:08:35,234
And you will see...
how strong I am!

144
00:08:35,334 --> 00:08:35,767
(buzzer)

145
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:37,334
Computer:
Let's go ahead!

146
00:08:48,034 --> 00:08:50,601
It's... a bit
of a slow start...

147
00:08:50,701 --> 00:08:51,834
No one appears
to be moving...

148
00:08:51,934 --> 00:08:53,234
What are we seeing,
Miss Nene?

149
00:08:53,334 --> 00:08:55,101
Nene:
Well, they're both
waiting to see

150
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,434
how their opponent
will open.

151
00:08:56,534 --> 00:08:59,967
Either combatant is
strong enough to be
a Seven Star Champion.

152
00:09:00,067 --> 00:09:01,901
No room here for
a careless move...

153
00:09:02,001 --> 00:09:03,401
Yeah‐ not only that,

154
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,334
but Shizuku doesn't want
to make the first move.

155
00:09:06,434 --> 00:09:08,667
Ikki:
Todo's most
effective up‐close.

156
00:09:08,767 --> 00:09:11,534
Her strongest weapon‐
by far‐ is her sword...

157
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,567
Right‐ her ace
in the hole...

158
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:15,401
Yeah.
Her Noble Art.

159
00:09:15,501 --> 00:09:18,534
Ikki:
It's so well‐known...
and so powerful‐

160
00:09:18,634 --> 00:09:20,601
she got her nickname
from it...

161
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:23,667
The Lightning Cutter...
"Raikiri."

162
00:09:23,767 --> 00:09:25,901
Alice:
And with a power
like Raikiri,

163
00:09:26,001 --> 00:09:30,067
Miss Toka Todo wins her
battles... every time.

164
00:09:30,167 --> 00:09:33,401
It's an electromagnetic
quick‐draw technique.

165
00:09:33,501 --> 00:09:36,234
It's fast.
And it's deadly.

166
00:09:36,334 --> 00:09:39,967
Yeah but... she lost at last
year's Seven Star‐ didn't she?

167
00:09:40,067 --> 00:09:42,034
So there's gotta
be a way to beat it.

168
00:09:42,134 --> 00:09:42,567
There's not.

169
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:46,801
Ikki:
The blazer who beat Todo
and won the final match
was a spear user.

170
00:09:46,901 --> 00:09:48,067
He stayed out of range.

171
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:50,534
That's the only way
he was able to beat her.

172
00:09:50,634 --> 00:09:53,401
Alice:
So... even the guy who won...

173
00:09:53,501 --> 00:09:55,067
was afraid of Raikiri.

174
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:56,301
Smart boy...

175
00:09:56,401 --> 00:10:00,167
Ikki:
No one has ever been able
to break through her
close‐range attacks.

176
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,901
Once you step into melee,
you get slashed by a sword

177
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:06,067
that moves faster
than lightning.

178
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:10,101
Shizuku knows this...
and she's hanging back.

179
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:11,967
She's waiting
for Todo...

180
00:10:12,067 --> 00:10:13,701
Right. In this match...

181
00:10:13,801 --> 00:10:16,034
Ikki:
She'll play defense
all the way.

182
00:10:16,134 --> 00:10:19,867
Shizuku is well‐practiced...
at long‐range attacks.

183
00:10:19,967 --> 00:10:21,567
She doesn't want
to move in.

184
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:23,567
It would put her
at a disadvantage.

185
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:26,001
Freeze, Toudo Heigen.

186
00:10:27,767 --> 00:10:30,034
Suirodan.

187
00:10:30,134 --> 00:10:32,067
She dodged and
countered from range.

188
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:33,701
She's incredibly
accurate!

189
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:36,201
But this is exactly
what I expected...

190
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:38,001
Shoha Suiren!

191
00:10:47,434 --> 00:10:51,334
Ikki:
Yes. Todo has already
realized her advantage.

192
00:10:51,434 --> 00:10:52,067
Rapid‐fire?!

193
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:54,101
In order to keep
Shoha Suiren going,

194
00:10:54,201 --> 00:10:58,201
Ikki:
Shizuku continuously
generates ultrapure water.

195
00:10:58,301 --> 00:11:00,034
But Todo's lightning
is endless...

196
00:11:00,134 --> 00:11:02,767
and all she has to do
is keep firing...

197
00:11:02,867 --> 00:11:05,867
The difference in their
rate of attack is apparent.

198
00:11:16,601 --> 00:11:19,167
Well‐ Todo may be a
fast thinker, but believe me‐

199
00:11:19,267 --> 00:11:21,801
Shizuku's a...
deep thinker.

200
00:11:21,901 --> 00:11:24,067
Alice:
She can defend herself,
lock down her opponent,

201
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:27,567
and attack...
all at the same time.

202
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:32,034
Stella:
That is incredible control!
She's very gifted...

203
00:11:43,934 --> 00:11:45,767
Just... extraordinary!

204
00:11:45,867 --> 00:11:48,467
Both combatants give
an amazing display of power!

205
00:11:48,567 --> 00:11:50,601
The President's
a total badass!

206
00:11:50,701 --> 00:11:52,467
I know man‐ she's in
the top four!

207
00:11:52,567 --> 00:11:55,634
Female Student:
Yeah but... that little freshman
is kicking some serious ass!

208
00:11:55,734 --> 00:11:58,967
Mikazuki:
We can hear the murmur
of a riveted crowd here...

209
00:11:59,067 --> 00:12:01,034
Miss Nene... considering
what we've seen so far‐

210
00:12:01,134 --> 00:12:03,601
who do you expect
will be victorious?

211
00:12:03,701 --> 00:12:04,934
Nene:
Oh, you know...

212
00:12:05,034 --> 00:12:07,767
Mikazuki:
No, I don't know!
Shizuku's putting
up a good fight!

213
00:12:07,867 --> 00:12:10,967
Yep... Our little
fountain is on fire!

214
00:12:11,801 --> 00:12:13,667
Maybe not...

215
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:14,901
Shizuku:
I don't get it.

216
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:17,767
I had the drop on her
and she still fought it off!

217
00:12:17,867 --> 00:12:20,401
How is she able
to anticipate my attacks?!

218
00:12:20,501 --> 00:12:24,667
Even from above, from what
should be her blind spot!

219
00:12:24,767 --> 00:12:26,634
How is she doing this?

220
00:12:26,734 --> 00:12:29,501
What is she seeing
that I can't see...?

221
00:12:29,601 --> 00:12:32,034
Utakata:
They sure are neck
and neck, Kanata.

222
00:12:32,134 --> 00:12:34,734
Kanata:
So it would appear,
Vice President.

223
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:37,601
The underclassmen really
are something else!

224
00:12:37,701 --> 00:12:39,667
They've got Kurogane and Stella,

225
00:12:39,767 --> 00:12:41,534
and this one's very impressive!

226
00:12:41,634 --> 00:12:42,101
Truly.

227
00:12:42,201 --> 00:12:44,801
Kanata:
I never imagined that
she would stand up this well

228
00:12:44,901 --> 00:12:45,367
against the president.

229
00:12:45,467 --> 00:12:49,201
Utakata:
I know! It's as if they're
perfectly matched!

230
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:50,967
Or it seems that way...

231
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:53,301
with long‐range attacks.

232
00:12:53,401 --> 00:12:54,734
Heh.

233
00:13:06,804 --> 00:13:07,730
What was that?!

234
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,930
WHOA! And a
narrow escape!

235
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,063
Kurogane barely
dodges an attack!

236
00:13:12,163 --> 00:13:15,330
Mikazuki:
Did Todo just catch her
opponent daydreaming?!

237
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,963
I don't understand!

238
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:19,396
I never lost
eye contact with her.

239
00:13:19,496 --> 00:13:22,163
But... was I
zoning out?

240
00:13:22,263 --> 00:13:24,130
That's impossible!

241
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,130
Either way‐ doesn't matter.

242
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,496
I have to make sure
I don't lose track of her...

243
00:13:28,596 --> 00:13:29,896
(gasps)

244
00:13:29,996 --> 00:13:31,663
Aaah!

245
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,530
Shizuku!

246
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,496
Brilliant defense!
Kurogane uses a "water shadow"!

247
00:13:44,596 --> 00:13:46,996
Her decoy absorbs the
attack and she can...

248
00:13:47,096 --> 00:13:50,096
No wait! Hold on!
Kurogane is injured!

249
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:55,163
Mikazuki:
Todo scores a hit on Kurogane!
Toka Todo draws first blood!

250
00:13:55,263 --> 00:13:57,030
(cheers and applause)

251
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:58,963
Shizuku:
I can't see what she's doing!

252
00:13:59,063 --> 00:14:00,330
I don't know
what the trick is,

253
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,596
or how she's
concealing her moves...

254
00:14:03,663 --> 00:14:05,063
Shizuku...

255
00:14:05,163 --> 00:14:06,563
Mikazuki:
What is happening here?!

256
00:14:06,663 --> 00:14:10,096
Lorelei and Raikiri
have been neck and neck
in this match so far,

257
00:14:10,196 --> 00:14:12,496
but Todo's got Kurogane‐
on the run!

258
00:14:12,596 --> 00:14:14,796
Miss Nene‐ what can you
tell us about...

259
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:16,596
Ahhh!

260
00:14:16,696 --> 00:14:19,763
Oh my God.
What is going on?

261
00:14:19,863 --> 00:14:23,630
Why does Shizuku look
like everything's taking
her by surprise?

262
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:24,563
Yeah...

263
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:26,096
Alice:
Todo is moving normally,

264
00:14:26,196 --> 00:14:28,930
but it's like Shizuku
can't even see her...

265
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,496
Ikki:
That's it, exactly.

266
00:14:30,596 --> 00:14:31,363
What?

267
00:14:31,463 --> 00:14:33,896
She actually can't
see Todo move...

268
00:14:33,996 --> 00:14:37,330
Ikki:
I think I've... seen this
technique before...

269
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,396
It was Miss Saikyo's move.

270
00:14:40,496 --> 00:14:42,263
Nene:
Good eye, kiddo!

271
00:14:42,363 --> 00:14:43,563
I was sure
you'd notice.

272
00:14:43,663 --> 00:14:45,963
Aren't you supposed to be
doing the commentary?

273
00:14:46,063 --> 00:14:47,530
Oh, who cares about that?

274
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,663
The technique is
called "The Nukiashi"‐

275
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:52,830
a series of stealthy steps
and breathing techniques...

276
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,696
Here‐ let me
show you...

277
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:56,496
There‐ you see?

278
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:59,130
Look at this‐
these things are amazing‐

279
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,063
what do they feed you at home?!

280
00:15:01,163 --> 00:15:02,596
Ahh! Oh my God,
oh my God!

281
00:15:02,696 --> 00:15:05,596
I'm just trying to understand
the sheer physics of these...

282
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,896
Well‐ why don't you fondle
your own "physics"?!

283
00:15:07,996 --> 00:15:09,630
Oh relax girl‐
it's for science!

284
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:10,963
OH MY GOD!

285
00:15:11,063 --> 00:15:13,230
So... how's this
technique work...?

286
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,863
The way that our
brains operate...

287
00:15:14,963 --> 00:15:18,663
we don't retain every detail
of what we experience
with our senses.

288
00:15:18,763 --> 00:15:21,863
Some of that information
goes to our subconscious.

289
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:24,596
Ikki:
With The Nukiashi,
you can conceal your presence

290
00:15:24,696 --> 00:15:28,096
in the unconscious mind
of your opponent.

291
00:15:28,196 --> 00:15:29,396
That's what Todo's doing.

292
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:31,296
Shizuku is looking
right at her,

293
00:15:31,396 --> 00:15:33,696
but she can't
process the image...

294
00:15:33,796 --> 00:15:36,796
Her eyes are following
Todo's every move...

295
00:15:36,896 --> 00:15:38,930
but The Nukiashi...
is tricking her brain

296
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:42,230
into categorizing that
information as unnecessary.

297
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,330
Todo can do this...

298
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:46,163
right up to the moment
before she makes an attack.

299
00:15:46,263 --> 00:15:49,030
Correct answer.
How do you know this?

300
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,896
Uh, Director...

301
00:15:51,963 --> 00:15:52,996
Ikki:
I never imagined...

302
00:15:53,096 --> 00:15:56,996
that a student would be capable
of mastering this technique.

303
00:15:57,096 --> 00:15:58,930
Actually‐ it
"runs in the dojo."

304
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:02,430
Nene and Todo both studied it
under the same knight.

305
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:05,863
Is that right?
And just who was the master?

306
00:16:05,963 --> 00:16:07,363
Torajiro Nango.

307
00:16:07,463 --> 00:16:08,863
It was Master Nango?!

308
00:16:08,963 --> 00:16:11,030
Now hold on just
a second there!

309
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:13,530
I have never considered
that geriatric bastard

310
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,896
to be MY master!

311
00:16:14,996 --> 00:16:15,830
Why are you
so sensitive?

312
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:19,063
Kurono:
Wasn't he your inspiration
for the tall wooden clogs?

313
00:16:19,163 --> 00:16:19,896
Ahhh!

314
00:16:19,996 --> 00:16:22,530
Absolutely not! I am not
trying to imitate that old man!

315
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,563
I simply saw them on an
infomercial saying they were a
natural remedy for constipation!

316
00:16:23,663 --> 00:16:27,030
I simply saw them on an
infomercial saying they were a
natural remedy for constipation!
Jesus! Would you go back

317
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:30,130
Kurogane. If you could
figure out the trick so well...

318
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,930
then I'll bet
you're already aware...

319
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:35,463
Kurono:
that your sister won't be able
to break the Nukiashi.

320
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:40,363
Honestly, it's going to be
very difficult for her...

321
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,963
No way...

322
00:16:43,063 --> 00:16:43,396
Ikki:
Maybe...

323
00:16:43,496 --> 00:16:47,296
If she has something that
she can use against Raikiri
at close‐range...

324
00:16:47,396 --> 00:16:49,363
then she might have a chance...

325
00:16:49,463 --> 00:16:51,196
But if she doesn't...

326
00:16:52,996 --> 00:16:57,296
Shizuku! You've got this!

327
00:16:57,396 --> 00:17:00,463
It doesn't make
me happy‐ Princess...

328
00:17:00,563 --> 00:17:03,296
to hear you
cheering for me...

329
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:03,963
But!

330
00:17:04,063 --> 00:17:08,896
Stella is sure to go to the
Seven Star Sword Art Festival.

331
00:17:08,996 --> 00:17:11,496
And so is...
my Brother...

332
00:17:11,596 --> 00:17:15,363
I swore to myself...
that I'd exceed my limits...

333
00:17:15,463 --> 00:17:17,196
That I would
show my brother...

334
00:17:17,296 --> 00:17:18,763
how much I loved him!

335
00:17:18,863 --> 00:17:22,796
I can't do that...
if I give up now!

336
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:28,496
I will beat her,
and I will go...

337
00:17:28,596 --> 00:17:31,863
with my Brother...
and my friends...

338
00:17:31,963 --> 00:17:33,430
all the way to
the Seven Star!

339
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,563
And Lorelei is standing
her ground people!

340
00:17:35,663 --> 00:17:37,496
Mikazuki:
Todo had her on
the defensive...

341
00:17:37,596 --> 00:17:41,196
But the freshman
is clearly not giving up!

342
00:17:41,296 --> 00:17:43,896
Shizuku:
No‐ I am most certainly not!

343
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,430
But I have to make up my mind.

344
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:48,696
If I can't see her when
she's moving in close to me...

345
00:17:48,796 --> 00:17:51,696
No more defense.
I need to attack.

346
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:53,430
I'll beat it...

347
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,863
that close‐range
attack of hers...

348
00:18:06,563 --> 00:18:07,730
Haaa!

349
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:19,896
Haa!

350
00:18:27,463 --> 00:18:28,430
(gasps)

351
00:18:30,596 --> 00:18:32,230
Ahhh!

352
00:18:33,796 --> 00:18:34,596
(chuckles)

353
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:35,596
(gasps)

354
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:44,096
Byakuya Kekkai.

355
00:18:44,196 --> 00:18:48,130
Mikazuki:
Oh! She's covered the
entire battle field with fog!

356
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,563
We can't see anything!

357
00:18:49,663 --> 00:18:51,030
Shizuku:
In this magical fog,

358
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,830
the only person who can
move freely is me,

359
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,563
the one who created it!

360
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,596
Hisuijin.

361
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:06,863
Nothing in this world can
withstand the power of water...

362
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,563
NOTHING!

363
00:19:13,096 --> 00:19:14,796
Haaaa!

364
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,196
Toka:
Raikiri!

365
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:49,163
Mikazuki:
A flash of lightning!

366
00:19:49,263 --> 00:19:50,863
A freshman falls!

367
00:19:50,963 --> 00:19:52,063
Game over!

368
00:19:52,163 --> 00:19:54,963
President of the student
council, Toka "Raikiri" Todo,

369
00:19:55,063 --> 00:19:58,163
has emerged‐ at last‐
the winner!

370
00:19:59,396 --> 00:20:00,930
Well, Ikki...

371
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,196
Did you see...

372
00:20:02,296 --> 00:20:04,963
what your little sister
was trying to show you?

373
00:20:05,063 --> 00:20:07,030
I saw it, Alice.

374
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,463
I saw everything.

375
00:20:08,563 --> 00:20:11,063
Ikki:
Shizuku's last attack
wasn't reckless...

376
00:20:11,163 --> 00:20:13,396
it was directed and precise.

377
00:20:13,496 --> 00:20:15,830
It was the best move
she could've made.

378
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,830
But Todo saw it coming...

379
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:20,196
and met it head‐on.

380
00:20:31,001 --> 00:20:32,040
Alice:
You're awake.

381
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,073
Uh?

382
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,807
Shizuku:
Alice.

383
00:20:35,907 --> 00:20:39,373
I lost...
didn't I...?

384
00:20:39,473 --> 00:20:41,440
Shizuku...
you did so well...!

385
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,773
I'm sorry.

386
00:20:42,873 --> 00:20:46,273
Could you... all please
leave me alone?

387
00:20:46,373 --> 00:20:48,673
Just for a little while please?

388
00:20:48,773 --> 00:20:51,307
I need to rest...

389
00:20:51,407 --> 00:20:54,240
Sure, ok...
Let's go, Stella.

390
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,007
Uh... Yeah...

391
00:21:00,807 --> 00:21:04,040
Will she... be okay?

392
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,240
Yeah.

393
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,240
She is... very strong...

394
00:21:13,407 --> 00:21:14,807
Why are you still here?

395
00:21:14,907 --> 00:21:16,573
Well, where else
would I be?

396
00:21:16,673 --> 00:21:19,073
I told you
to leave me alone.

397
00:21:19,173 --> 00:21:20,473
Yes. Yes you did.

398
00:21:20,573 --> 00:21:21,907
GET OUT!

399
00:21:24,073 --> 00:21:26,507
A‐Alice...?

400
00:21:26,607 --> 00:21:27,873
You were amazing
out there.

401
00:21:27,973 --> 00:21:28,907
(gasps)

402
00:21:29,607 --> 00:21:31,373
Your big brother...

403
00:21:31,473 --> 00:21:34,740
was with you all
the way to the end.

404
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,607
You don't have to pretend
with me, my little love.

405
00:21:37,707 --> 00:21:40,107
I know exactly who you are.

406
00:21:40,207 --> 00:21:41,307
So...

407
00:21:41,407 --> 00:21:44,207
why don't you
stop acting so damn tough?

408
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:55,873
(sobbing)

409
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:03,773
Itsuki:
I see. Shizuku... lost.

410
00:22:03,873 --> 00:22:07,540
Too bad. Alright‐
so about the next move...

411
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,707
I leave it to you.

412
00:22:08,807 --> 00:22:11,140
Then I'll certainly
take care of it.

413
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,007
(snickers)
