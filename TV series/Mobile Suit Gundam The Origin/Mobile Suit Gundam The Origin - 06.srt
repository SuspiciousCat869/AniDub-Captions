‐ I could try to establish
a laser comm link.

139
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:52,943
‐ However we don't want the enemy to know

‐ We're leaving something
like this to my eyeballs?

Minovsky particle density

Multiple nozzle plumes.

159
00:09:35,818 --> 00:09:37,737
Must be the rear of one of our fleets.

160
00:09:37,737 --> 00:09:40,702
Looks like they've arrived
at the front lines.

164
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:46,129
And their bearing is‐‐

165
00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:47,131
‐ What's the vector analysis?

166
00:09:47,131 --> 00:09:48,508
‐ Doing it now.

167
00:09:48,508 --> 00:09:49,343
Let's see...

168
00:09:49,343 --> 00:09:51,264
They're approaching from our 2:00.

169
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:53,935
But that means...

170
00:09:55,105 --> 00:09:56,064
It's the enemy!

171
00:09:56,064 --> 00:09:57,108
‐ [Ryu] This is the Duckbill!

172
00:09:57,108 --> 00:09:58,403
Come in Falcon!

173
00:09:58,403 --> 00:09:59,237
This is the Duckbill!

174
00:09:59,237 --> 00:10:00,072
‐ This is bad!

175
00:10:00,072 --> 00:10:01,199
The enemy is all around us!

176
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:02,035
‐ Crap!

177
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:03,747
The Falcon isn't responding!

178
00:10:07,128 --> 00:10:07,963
[suspenseful music]

179
00:10:07,963 --> 00:10:10,092
‐ Unidentified craft on our sensors.

180
00:10:10,092 --> 00:10:11,470
‐ Yeah, so?

181
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,641
‐ It could be an enemy recon unit, sir.

182
00:10:13,641 --> 00:10:16,062
‐ But what's it doing way out here?

183
00:10:16,062 --> 00:10:18,776
‐ Sir, this could prove to be problematic.

184
00:10:18,776 --> 00:10:20,153
‐ I don't care.

185
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:22,240
We are sticking to the plan!

186
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,951
We're holding our course!

187
00:10:23,951 --> 00:10:24,828
‐ Right.

188
00:10:24,828 --> 00:10:26,081
Holding our course.

189
00:10:32,803 --> 00:10:36,267
‐ Well, all of our vessels
have completely ceased fire.

190
00:10:36,267 --> 00:10:39,273
‐ All units, load in initial rounds,

191
00:10:39,273 --> 00:10:41,736
and make sure your safeties are engaged.

192
00:10:44,534 --> 00:10:46,120
Nicely done.

193
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,080
So far so good.

194
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,335
‐ Find anything?

195
00:11:11,335 --> 00:11:12,629
‐ I can't tell what it is.

196
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,967
‐ Let me have a look.

197
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:17,138
‐ I thought it was debris, but from what?

198
00:11:18,808 --> 00:11:20,269
‐ Those are...

199
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:22,231
They're ships!

200
00:11:22,231 --> 00:11:24,694
Come in bridge, this is the right wing!

201
00:11:24,694 --> 00:11:27,073
‐ Are you positive that they're ships?

202
00:11:27,073 --> 00:11:28,869
What is the CIC saying about it?

203
00:11:28,869 --> 00:11:30,664
‐ [Officer] Admiral on the bridge!

204
00:11:30,664 --> 00:11:32,042
‐ Hmm?

205
00:11:32,042 --> 00:11:33,544
Keep working on confirmation.

206
00:11:37,385 --> 00:11:39,223
‐ [Admiral] As you were.

207
00:11:39,223 --> 00:11:40,266
‐ Yes sir.

208
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,771
‐ All right then, what's
our current status?

209
00:11:42,771 --> 00:11:44,315
‐ Sir, of course.

210
00:11:44,315 --> 00:11:46,277
We're making our way
toward the engagement zone,

211
00:11:46,277 --> 00:11:49,075
and the fleet's acceleration is steady.

212
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,788
[dramatic music]

213
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:58,927
‐ There it is.

214
00:11:58,927 --> 00:11:59,929
I've found their main force.

Be amazed at what I am
capable of, almighty red!

217
00:12:16,294 --> 00:12:18,089
‐ How's Tianem's Second Fleet doing?

218
00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:18,924
‐ Right.

219
00:12:18,924 --> 00:12:21,554
They have engaged the enemy
and now have the upper hand.

220
00:12:22,514 --> 00:12:25,604
Also, CIC relayed a
report from a recon unit

221
00:12:25,604 --> 00:12:26,606
a few moments ago.

Squadron has been hit!

00:12:33,577 --> 00:12:34,830
I see fire!

226
00:12:35,874 --> 00:12:37,710
‐ [Officer] There's another flash!

227
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,213
‐ That's ship number two, the Forrestal.

228
00:12:39,213 --> 00:12:41,343
Damage to superstructure spotted.

229
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,472
Most likely due to an enemy attack.

230
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:44,891
‐ [Officer] But from where?!

231
00:12:49,107 --> 00:12:51,695
The fire appears to be
spreading inside the ship!

232
00:12:51,695 --> 00:12:53,115
‐ [Admiral] What's the enemy's bearing?

233
00:12:53,115 --> 00:12:55,662
‐ [Officer] 4:00, according
to passive sensors.

Bearing 207!

Encoded message from Tianem Fleet.

240
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,695
They've lost track of the Dozle Fleet.

241
00:13:12,695 --> 00:13:14,155
‐ Wait, they've what?

242
00:13:14,155 --> 00:13:15,742
Apparently a few minutes prior,

243
00:13:15,742 --> 00:13:17,370
there was a report from a recon craft

244
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,124
that claimed to have spotted enemy ships.

245
00:13:19,124 --> 00:13:20,710
‐ Deploy air defense squadrons.

246
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,005

‐ Direct call from lookout.

‐ [Pilot] Unidentifiable ship!

251
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:30,604
‐ [Officer] Shall I ping their IFF?

252
00:13:30,604 --> 00:13:33,401
Receiving emergency
messages from consort ships.

253
00:13:33,401 --> 00:13:34,904
‐ What is that there?

254
00:13:34,904 --> 00:13:36,950
‐ Multiple ships, 12:00!

255
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,369
IFF unknown.

256
00:13:38,369 --> 00:13:40,248
They are not friendly forces!

It's Revil's own fleet.

All thrusters ahead, steady as she goes!

Keep firing till you're out of ammo!

We're gonna blow a hole right
through their ugly mugs.

I think they've been hit!

‐ Give the order to turn around.

280
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:17,519
The enemy is going to
attempt another pass.

281
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,564
‐ [Officer] Fleet,
prepare to change course.

00:15:19,564 --> 00:15:21,861
‐ So the cornered rat
wants to attack the cat.

283
00:15:23,113 --> 00:15:25,034
We were bitten, all right.

331
00:18:15,363 --> 00:18:17,283
Falcon Leader, come in!

332
00:18:18,451 --> 00:18:19,955
‐ Dammit!

333
00:18:19,955 --> 00:18:21,959

‐ I've found you!

343
00:19:15,186 --> 00:19:17,399
It's the Ananke!

344
00:19:17,399 --> 00:19:18,275
Their flagship.

345
00:19:21,073 --> 00:19:23,285
So that's Revil's ship.

346
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,709
And we're taking it out, yeah!

347

[guns firing]

348
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:36,269

00:19:36,269 --> 00:19:37,771

00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,877
‐ Damage report!

353
00:19:48,877 --> 00:19:49,754
‐ [Officer] Fire in the engine room!

354
00:19:49,754 --> 00:19:51,047
They can't contain it!

355
00:19:51,047 --> 00:19:53,302
‐ We have three mobile suits on us.

356
00:19:53,302 --> 00:19:54,429
‐ Admiral!

357
00:19:54,429 --> 00:19:55,765
‐ [Officer] Primary power holding steady.

358
00:19:55,765 --> 00:19:56,933
‐ Our engines are offline.

359

We need to transfer you to a new vessel.

Abort flyer response.

361
00:20:01,651 --> 00:20:03,404
Prepare to abandon ship.

362
00:20:03,404 --> 00:20:05,325
‐ All hands, abandon ship immediately!

363
00:20:05,325 --> 00:20:06,285
‐ All hands, abandon ship at once!

[exploding]

‐ All right, go get 'em Mash!

366
00:20:16,639 --> 00:20:17,974
‐ Shut up and let me work.

367
00:20:17,974 --> 00:20:19,937
‐ Leave it to me, I'll finish her off!

‐ Those are nice and small.

373
00:21:01,642 --> 00:21:03,521
Makes 'em more fun to shoot down!

00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,334
Huh, the admiral's flag.

‐ What happened?

382
00:22:10,984 --> 00:22:11,902
Where am I?

383
00:22:13,823 --> 00:22:15,452
I'm in space.

384
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,415
I thought I was a goner for sure.

385
00:22:20,002 --> 00:22:23,968
One minute you're a pilot,
the next you're space trash.

386
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,268
Look, more trash is coming to join me.

387
00:22:29,812 --> 00:22:31,733
Hey, Four‐eyes!

388
00:22:31,733 --> 00:22:32,985
Where are you?

389
00:22:34,237 --> 00:22:36,993
[dramatic music]

390
00:22:55,153 --> 00:22:56,739
‐ Three rounds left.

391
00:22:56,739 --> 00:22:58,743
Let's try and take down two more.

392
00:23:02,584 --> 00:23:03,418
‐ He's fast.

393
00:23:03,418 --> 00:23:05,047
Hold on, a red mobile suit?

394
00:23:05,047 --> 00:23:06,341
Must be Lieutenant Char.

395
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,224
‐ It's that bastard!

396
00:23:10,224 --> 00:23:11,685
‐ Char you mean?

397
00:23:11,685 --> 00:23:14,022
‐ He's moving at three
times the normal speed!

398
00:23:14,941 --> 00:23:19,951
Ha, the guy's a veritable red comet.

‐ He took out a cruiser
with a single bazooka?

402
00:23:58,024 --> 00:24:01,949
How in the world can I
compete against that?

403
00:24:01,949 --> 00:24:03,368
‐ [Officer] Lieutenant Char?

404
00:24:04,328 --> 00:24:06,708
‐ Master Chief Petty Officer Cozun.

405
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:08,378
‐ I have a spare magazine, sir.

406
00:24:08,378 --> 00:24:10,048
Shall I top you off?

407
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:12,344
‐ [Char] You should focus
on grabbing your own glory,

408
00:24:12,344 --> 00:24:14,431
I don't need help with mine.

409
00:24:14,431 --> 00:24:15,267
‐ Sorry.

410
00:24:15,267 --> 00:24:16,101
‐ [Cozun] I was only‐‐

411
00:24:16,101 --> 00:24:18,230
‐ You served under Lieutenant
Ramba Ral, didn't you?

412
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,065
‐ Yes sir.

413
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:22,906
‐ Then do your part to make up
for the lieutenant's absence.

414
00:24:43,612 --> 00:24:45,198
[grunts]

415
00:24:45,198 --> 00:24:47,119
‐ I should congratulate you.

416
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:50,584
What a grand victory for our forces.

417
00:24:50,584 --> 00:24:53,548
Please accept my sincere compliments.

418
00:24:53,548 --> 00:24:55,344
We have the Supreme Commander's

419
00:24:55,344 --> 00:24:58,015
masterful leadership to thank.

420
00:24:58,015 --> 00:25:00,479
I underestimated your brilliance.

421
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:02,399
‐ I wasn't expecting such lavish praise,

422
00:25:02,399 --> 00:25:04,862
especially not from you.

423
00:25:04,862 --> 00:25:07,116
‐ This will guarantee the negotiations

424
00:25:07,116 --> 00:25:08,452
will be quick and easy.

425
00:25:09,496 --> 00:25:11,958
I'm sure the agreement
will skew in our favor.

426
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,674
‐ A bit premature.

427
00:25:15,674 --> 00:25:19,390
This was just the first
step on the road to victory.

428
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:22,020
We mustn't allow the fighting to end,

429
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,857
at least not until we have achieved

430
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:26,362
our ultimate triumph over the Federation.

431
00:25:26,362 --> 00:25:30,160
‐ Oh, I guess I've underestimated
you again, brother.

432
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,289
‐ If an opportunity presents itself,

433
00:25:32,289 --> 00:25:34,419
one must adapt to seize it, Kycilia.

434
00:25:35,964 --> 00:25:38,552
‐ Might I trouble you with a question?

435
00:25:38,552 --> 00:25:39,972
‐ What is it?

436
00:25:39,972 --> 00:25:42,059
‐ The Sovereign's ship, the Great Degwin,

437
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:45,274
is currently out there on
the front lines by herself,

438
00:25:45,274 --> 00:25:47,277
and she is exposed.

439
00:25:47,277 --> 00:25:49,907
‐ I'm sure it's just as Father wanted.

440
00:25:49,907 --> 00:25:53,247
The troops are inspired, and
he is now able to witness

441
00:25:53,247 --> 00:25:55,668
our historic victory firsthand.

442
00:25:55,668 --> 00:25:58,174
I expect he's most pleased.

443
00:25:58,174 --> 00:26:01,972
‐ Hypothetically speaking, if
the Tianem Fleet were prepared

444
00:26:01,972 --> 00:26:04,603
to sacrifice itself in a suicide run,

445
00:26:04,603 --> 00:26:07,691
do you think the Sovereign
would be able to fight them off?

446
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,236
‐ A needless concern.

447
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:11,741
The corrupt bureaucrat
soldiers of the Federation

448
00:26:11,741 --> 00:26:14,120
do not possess the heroic recklessness

449
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,373
to attempt such a thing.

450
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:16,751
‐ But let's say they did,

451
00:26:16,751 --> 00:26:18,630
what do you suppose would happen then?

452
00:26:20,007 --> 00:26:22,386
‐ Do I really need to answer that?

453
00:26:24,557 --> 00:26:26,353
‐ Perhaps not.

454
00:26:26,353 --> 00:26:28,565
‐ This concludes the
summary of estimated losses

455
00:26:28,565 --> 00:26:29,901
suffered by the enemy fleet.

456
00:26:29,901 --> 00:26:30,736
‐ Way to go, Dozle!

457
00:26:30,736 --> 00:26:32,532
Amazing, a complete victory!

458
00:26:33,492 --> 00:26:35,663
Our forces are unbeatable!

459
00:26:36,622 --> 00:26:38,209
‐ It's not over yet, Garma.

460
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:42,717
There is the possibility
that the Federation

461
00:26:42,717 --> 00:26:45,431
could still send in their Tianem Fleet.

462
00:26:45,431 --> 00:26:49,940
If that happened, the Zeon
homeland would be defenseless.

463
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,860
[gasps]

464
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,407
They would be adopting a lose the battle

465
00:26:54,407 --> 00:26:56,160
to win the war strategy.

466
00:26:56,995 --> 00:26:59,166
[gasping]

467
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,509
‐ Enemy ships, dead ahead.

468
00:27:04,509 --> 00:27:07,098
We have them on optical sensors as well.

469
00:27:07,098 --> 00:27:08,935
The large one is Gwazine‐class.

470
00:27:08,935 --> 00:27:12,233
It is likely the Great Degwin,
the sovereign's flagship.

471
00:27:14,487 --> 00:27:16,908
Mobilizing the Dozle Fleet
may have stretched the enemy

472
00:27:16,908 --> 00:27:18,662
so thin that they've
been forced to send out

473
00:27:18,662 --> 00:27:19,664
even their flagship.

474
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,421
‐ If we can get past those,
we'll be on their doorstep.

475
00:27:23,421 --> 00:27:25,342
‐ If we make a run at the Zeon homeland,

476
00:27:25,342 --> 00:27:26,677
we could force a surrender.

477
00:27:26,677 --> 00:27:30,310
‐ Admiral, our fleet has only
sustained very minimal losses.

478
00:27:32,689 --> 00:27:34,025
‐ Not a chance.

479
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:40,662
We aren't attacking, no way.

480
00:27:40,662 --> 00:27:42,541
‐ But why not?

481
00:27:42,541 --> 00:27:45,923
‐ The outcome of this battle
is already written on the wall.

482
00:27:45,923 --> 00:27:47,385
‐ Admiral!

483
00:27:47,385 --> 00:27:50,641
‐ Our most pressing duty is
to aid the fleeing Revil Fleet

484
00:27:50,641 --> 00:27:53,145
by making sure they have
cover for their retreat.

485
00:27:53,145 --> 00:27:54,272
All ships, come about!

486
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:55,108
‐ Yes sir!

487
00:27:55,108 --> 00:27:55,943
Attention all ships!

488
00:27:55,943 --> 00:27:57,570
Prepare to come about!

489
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:58,447
‐ Changing course!

490
00:27:58,447 --> 00:27:59,616
‐ [Officer] Laser comm link established!

491
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,451
‐ [Officer] Confirm engine pressure!

492
00:28:00,451 --> 00:28:01,620
‐ [Officer] Course is clear!

493
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,415
‐ You haven't defeated us yet.

494
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,544
This isn't over.

495
00:28:09,218 --> 00:28:12,224
[suspenseful music]

496
00:28:31,135 --> 00:28:32,847
‐ [Officer] The Tianem
Fleet has turned around.

497
00:28:32,847 --> 00:28:35,518
They are 4000 kilometers
away and counting.

498
00:28:35,518 --> 00:28:36,562
‐ We did it!

499
00:28:36,562 --> 00:28:38,065
A decisive victory!

500
00:28:38,065 --> 00:28:40,028
This means that we've
definitely won the battle,

501
00:28:40,028 --> 00:28:41,155
right Father?

502
00:28:41,155 --> 00:28:43,159
Next time, I'm gonna fight too,

503
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:45,204
for I am ready for anything!

504
00:28:45,204 --> 00:28:47,792
After all, I'm a soldier
of the Principality!

505
00:28:48,753 --> 00:28:49,588
‐ Garma.

506
00:28:50,422 --> 00:28:52,301
You are still young.

507
00:28:52,301 --> 00:28:55,432
No, rather you are still a child.

508
00:28:55,432 --> 00:28:58,480
You are not yet fully
capable of comprehending

509
00:28:59,357 --> 00:29:00,859
the true horrors of war.

510
00:29:00,859 --> 00:29:03,448
I caution you never to act rashly.

511
00:29:05,284 --> 00:29:07,748
Send the following to Dozle!

512
00:29:07,748 --> 00:29:10,461
Admiral Revil has surrendered to us,

513
00:29:10,461 --> 00:29:13,300
so he is to be extended
every courtesy possible.

514
00:29:25,657 --> 00:29:27,160
‐ [Officer] There's a ship
returning fire at 10:00!

515
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,162
‐ [Officer] Turn to port!

516
00:29:28,162 --> 00:29:30,542
All engines ahead, full speed!

517
00:29:30,542 --> 00:29:31,377
Open fire!

518
00:29:33,673 --> 00:29:35,969
‐ [Officer] Magellan‐class at 038!

519
00:29:35,969 --> 00:29:36,762
Continue firing!

520
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:41,104
[lasers blasting]

521
00:29:41,104 --> 00:29:42,857
Direct hit, direct hit!

522
00:29:42,857 --> 00:29:45,321
‐ [Officer] Enemy battleship
group's battle line collapsing!

523
00:29:45,321 --> 00:29:46,238
‐ [Officer] Heavy damage to
Magellan‐class confirmed!

524
00:29:47,533 --> 00:29:48,367
‐ [Officer] Crew has
begun to abandon ship!

525
00:29:48,367 --> 00:29:49,328
‐ It's nothing personal.

526
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:52,542
This is the fate of the vanquished.

527
00:29:53,586 --> 00:29:56,091
[solemn music]

528
00:29:58,929 --> 00:30:00,182
Hold your fire!

529
00:30:00,182 --> 00:30:02,186
Attention fleet!

530
00:30:02,186 --> 00:30:04,650
A moment of silence for
all the brave soldiers

531
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:07,112
who breathed their last breath out here.

532
00:30:07,112 --> 00:30:08,573
Let us honor them!

533
00:30:23,018 --> 00:30:26,441
[cheering and chanting]

534
00:30:31,326 --> 00:30:32,912
[shouting]

535
00:30:32,912 --> 00:30:34,248
‐ Long live the Sovereign!

536
00:30:34,248 --> 00:30:38,131
‐ Long live Lord Gihren,
the Supreme Commander!

537
00:30:40,135 --> 00:30:43,057
[triumphant music]

538
00:30:49,528 --> 00:30:52,158
‐ Gihren, an immediate peace agreement.

539
00:30:52,158 --> 00:30:54,579
That is our goal here.

540
00:30:54,579 --> 00:30:57,209
I believe the wisest course of action

541
00:30:57,209 --> 00:31:01,468
is to use this victory to force
the Federation to the table.

542
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:04,557
‐ With all due respect,

543
00:31:04,557 --> 00:31:07,103
our victory doesn't have to end here.

544
00:31:07,103 --> 00:31:08,940
We'll win the next battle.

545
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,695
And the next, till the very end.

546
00:31:11,695 --> 00:31:15,328
When we do negotiate, it will
be at a time of our choosing,

547
00:31:15,328 --> 00:31:18,709
when we determine that it
is most advantageous for us.

548
00:31:18,709 --> 00:31:21,547
‐ Others preached this
before their downfall.

549
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:23,886
Men with the names of Napoleon and Hitler!

550
00:31:23,886 --> 00:31:25,347
‐ There are no lessons to be learned

551
00:31:25,347 --> 00:31:27,518
in the follies of ancient history.

552
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:29,605
After all, we are living
outside the bounds

553
00:31:29,605 --> 00:31:31,692
of anything they ever experienced.

554
00:31:31,692 --> 00:31:34,405
Forget their history,
we'll cultivate our own.

555
00:31:34,405 --> 00:31:37,411
To think that such words
would come from my own father,

556
00:31:37,411 --> 00:31:40,376
Zeon Zum Deikun's closest comrade!

557
00:31:40,376 --> 00:31:42,547
What was it that Deikun said?

558
00:31:42,547 --> 00:31:45,261
Did he not declare us
the future of humanity?

559
00:31:45,261 --> 00:31:47,598
That Spacenoids would
become the new species

560
00:31:47,598 --> 00:31:51,021
that will usher us into the
next stage of human evolution?

561
00:31:51,021 --> 00:31:53,777
We have at our fingertips
the perfect opportunity

562
00:31:53,777 --> 00:31:57,158
with which to make
Deikun's ideals a reality.

563
00:31:57,158 --> 00:32:00,999
An opportunity like this will
not present itself again.

564
00:32:00,999 --> 00:32:03,713
It would be folly not to press on.

565
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:07,344
We shall never compromise,
but always press onwards.

566
00:32:07,344 --> 00:32:08,179
Onwards!

567
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:11,936
[groans]

568
00:32:15,151 --> 00:32:15,986
‐ Kycilia.

569
00:32:16,905 --> 00:32:17,907
‐ Yes Father.

570
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:22,206
I am right here.

571
00:32:23,083 --> 00:32:24,502
‐ What do you think?

572
00:32:25,546 --> 00:32:27,800
Quite frankly he frightens me.

573
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,848
‐ No need to worry, I will assist you.

574
00:32:32,017 --> 00:32:33,395
‐ Please do.

575
00:32:33,395 --> 00:32:37,987
At this point I am afraid
nobody can stop him except you.

576
00:32:37,987 --> 00:32:39,908
He's turned into a monster.

577
00:32:41,035 --> 00:32:43,331
Deikun's unfinished business has become

578
00:32:43,331 --> 00:32:45,710
an evil spirit and possessed him.

579
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:48,758
He will destroy this country,

580
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:51,388
and our entire family along with it.

581
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,145
‐ Rest easy, Father.

582
00:32:56,356 --> 00:32:58,402
I will always have your back.

583
00:33:06,835 --> 00:33:07,670
‐ [Garma] No!

584
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:10,508
I don't want to be assigned to staff HQ!

585
00:33:10,508 --> 00:33:13,264
‐ Sorry, but there's not
much I can do about it.

586
00:33:13,264 --> 00:33:15,268
‐ I want to be on the front lines!

587
00:33:15,268 --> 00:33:17,647
Please let me make a name for myself!

588
00:33:17,647 --> 00:33:19,191
‐ Well, here's the thing.

589
00:33:19,191 --> 00:33:22,573
This is what Father wanted,
and the top brass has agreed,

590
00:33:22,573 --> 00:33:25,245
so, it's out of my hands.

591
00:33:25,245 --> 00:33:26,622
‐ I find that hard to believe.

592
00:33:26,622 --> 00:33:27,458
‐ Huh?

593
00:33:27,458 --> 00:33:29,545
‐ They can't say no to you, they love you.

594
00:33:29,545 --> 00:33:31,758
You're the hero of Loum, after all.

595
00:33:31,758 --> 00:33:32,843
‐ Well, I guess.

596
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,601
‐ I won't be outdone, not by Char.

597
00:33:38,062 --> 00:33:39,689
I heard that the decoration he's getting

598
00:33:39,689 --> 00:33:41,401
has a two‐rank promotion.

599
00:33:41,401 --> 00:33:43,572
He'll be a lieutenant commander!

600
00:33:43,572 --> 00:33:45,951
Then that means I'll be...

601
00:33:45,951 --> 00:33:46,912
‐ If that's why you're worried,

602
00:33:46,912 --> 00:33:49,208
I can make you the same rank easy!

603
00:33:49,208 --> 00:33:51,963
‐ Who cares if I didn't actually earn it?!

604
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:54,593
All I've done is watch
battles from a safe distance.

605
00:33:55,428 --> 00:33:56,847
‐ There, there...

606
00:33:58,601 --> 00:34:00,188
‐ I hate it.

607
00:34:00,188 --> 00:34:01,565
I'm not taken seriously.

608
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:06,157
So doing me this favor
isn't really going to help.

609
00:34:06,157 --> 00:34:09,372
People will say my only
accomplishment was being a Zabi.

610
00:34:10,249 --> 00:34:12,294
[crying]

611
00:34:14,173 --> 00:34:15,007
‐ Huh?

612
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,602
‐ All right then.

613
00:34:20,602 --> 00:34:23,274
I'll be sure to talk to Gihren about it.

614
00:34:23,274 --> 00:34:25,570
Don't come crying if
it doesn't go your way.

615
00:34:28,701 --> 00:34:31,623
[triumphant music]

616
00:34:38,052 --> 00:34:39,013
‐ [Reporter] We're coming to you live

617
00:34:39,013 --> 00:34:41,726
from the Battle of Loum
victory celebration!

618
00:34:41,726 --> 00:34:44,648
At the newly‐completed
Principality Government Building,

619
00:34:44,648 --> 00:34:46,569
Deikun Hall!

620
00:34:46,569 --> 00:34:49,032
The decoration ceremony has just ended,

621
00:34:49,032 --> 00:34:51,913
and our brave soldiers are
now filing into the building.

622
00:34:52,998 --> 00:34:55,962
Here comes our fleet
commander, Vice Admiral Dozle!

623
00:34:56,838 --> 00:34:58,467
The commanding presence he radiates

624
00:34:58,467 --> 00:35:00,721
is most certainly palpable.

625
00:35:00,721 --> 00:35:02,767
Following close behind
him are the triumphant

626
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:03,936
Black Tri‐Stars!

627
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:05,523
Lieutenant Gaia!

628
00:35:05,523 --> 00:35:07,985
Lieutenant Junior Grade Mash!

629
00:35:07,985 --> 00:35:09,822
Lieutenant Junior Grade Ortega!

630
00:35:10,823 --> 00:35:13,746
And now the man who earned
the nom de guerre Red Comet,

631
00:35:13,746 --> 00:35:17,629
our ace of aces, Lieutenant JG Char!

632
00:35:17,629 --> 00:35:18,464
Strike that!

633
00:35:18,464 --> 00:35:20,300
The dashing cape of a field officer

634
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,137
is now fluttering on his shoulders!

635
00:35:22,137 --> 00:35:25,895
Make that Lieutenant
Commander Char Aznable!

636
00:35:25,895 --> 00:35:28,275
[growling]

637
00:35:28,275 --> 00:35:29,944
‐ With this glorious victory,

638
00:35:29,944 --> 00:35:33,158
these warriors, our pride
and joy of the battlefield,

639
00:35:33,158 --> 00:35:36,164
have proven to the world
that Deikun's great teachings

640
00:35:36,164 --> 00:35:38,753
are true, that we Spacenoids stand

641
00:35:38,753 --> 00:35:42,343
head and shoulders above all
the others in the universe!

642
00:35:42,343 --> 00:35:44,180
[cheering]

643
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:47,520
But countrymen, we
can't relax our efforts,

644
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,108
because our fight has only just begun.

645
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:52,905
May I remind you there are parts of Loum

646
00:35:52,905 --> 00:35:54,868
who've yet to acknowledge our principality

647
00:35:54,868 --> 00:35:57,873
and continue their futile resistance.

648
00:35:57,873 --> 00:36:00,545
We must eliminate these rabble rousers

649
00:36:00,545 --> 00:36:02,966
so we can unite the colonies as one.

650
00:36:02,966 --> 00:36:04,970
It's only then we will be victorious

651
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:07,684
in our final battle
against the Federation!

652
00:36:07,684 --> 00:36:09,938
[cheering]

653
00:36:16,451 --> 00:36:17,912
‐ Yes, it's true.

654
00:36:17,912 --> 00:36:19,624
That is what happened.

655
00:36:19,624 --> 00:36:21,293
‐ We were the ones who were responsible

656
00:36:21,293 --> 00:36:23,089
for taking Revil prisoner!

657
00:36:23,089 --> 00:36:25,928
So why's it that guy who's
getting all the attention?!

658
00:36:25,928 --> 00:36:28,933
‐ Just let it go, Ortega, and cool down.

[gasping]

662
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:34,026
How are you doing, my friend?

663
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:36,364
I've been following your exploits.

664
00:36:36,364 --> 00:36:37,992
‐ Ah, Garma.

665
00:36:37,992 --> 00:36:40,789
It appears that you're doing well too.

666
00:36:40,789 --> 00:36:43,920
‐ Yes, I'm a major with our
elite airborne division.

667
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,174
My assignment just came through today.

668
00:36:46,174 --> 00:36:47,970
‐ Why then congratulations.

669
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:50,600
That's a very fitting post for you.

670
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:54,482
‐ Ground combat is far more
risky than fleet warfare.

671
00:36:54,482 --> 00:36:56,611
It's dirty, bloody work.

672
00:36:56,611 --> 00:36:58,115
‐ Mhmm.

673
00:36:58,115 --> 00:37:01,288
‐ I may only be a major,
but a whole armored regiment

674
00:37:01,288 --> 00:37:02,999
will serve under me.

675
00:37:02,999 --> 00:37:05,671
And with that regiment
behind me, I'll mop up

676
00:37:05,671 --> 00:37:08,092
any remaining enemy forces in Loum.

677
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:09,261
‐ Oh?

678
00:37:09,261 --> 00:37:10,722
‐ You think I can't handle it!

679
00:37:10,722 --> 00:37:12,893
That's what you're thinking, huh?!

680
00:37:12,893 --> 00:37:14,855
‐ I swear to you I'm not.

681
00:37:14,855 --> 00:37:17,486
‐ It's just, it sounds rather dangerous,

682
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:20,575
and I didn't think that you
liked to get your hands dirty.

683
00:37:20,575 --> 00:37:22,161
I'm more shocked that Sovereign Degwin

684
00:37:22,161 --> 00:37:23,246
and Admiral Dozle would‐‐

685
00:37:23,246 --> 00:37:24,749
‐ They've nothing to do with this!

686
00:37:24,749 --> 00:37:26,962
I'm responsible for my own successes!

Don't underestimate me, okay?

689
00:37:31,554 --> 00:37:32,973
We are of the same ilk.

690
00:37:34,393 --> 00:37:38,735
Neither one of us are the
little boys we were back then.

They're there, right there!

This statue is said to date
back to fourth century B. C.

of the Earth calendar.

[gasps]

711
00:39:35,084 --> 00:39:38,007
The real one's a replica
from the Roman era.

712
00:39:38,007 --> 00:39:40,136
This one must be a copy of that copy,

713
00:39:40,136 --> 00:39:42,015
made during the Renaissance era.

714
00:39:44,311 --> 00:39:46,356
‐ Well, this item is a standout

715

among the museum's collection.

716
00:39:47,984 --> 00:39:49,320
A Grecian urn!

717
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,909
The creatures depicted on
it are called centaurs.

718
00:39:51,909 --> 00:39:54,121
The earn was found in
Vulci, in southern Italy‐‐

719
00:39:54,121 --> 00:39:55,958
‐ This one is also a fake.

Something you would sell to tourists.

Even worse than a pure
counterfeit, one could say.

723
00:40:02,136 --> 00:40:02,971
And this?

724
00:40:03,973 --> 00:40:05,894
‐ [Curator] This is an example of a mask

725
00:40:05,894 --> 00:40:08,983
used in theatrical
performances in the Roman era.

726
00:40:08,983 --> 00:40:10,694
‐ [M'Quve] This as well?

727
00:40:10,694 --> 00:40:13,575
‐ [Curator] Yes, we believe
that to be the case.

728
00:40:13,575 --> 00:40:15,996
‐ These must have cost a small fortune.

729
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:18,544
‐ Yes, to say the least.

730
00:40:18,544 --> 00:40:21,591
‐ For all the grandeur
of our Universal Century,

731
00:40:21,591 --> 00:40:24,764
our history does not even
stretch back a mere 100 years.

732
00:40:25,682 --> 00:40:27,894
That's why we're looked down upon.

733
00:40:27,894 --> 00:40:30,775
‐ [Kycilia] Dismissed as nouveau riche.

734

‐ If you'll excuse me, I have
other things to attend to.

Feel free to view any
of the other exhibits.

736
00:40:42,966 --> 00:40:45,262
‐ You have made your
feelings abundantly clear.

737
00:40:45,262 --> 00:40:47,349
I appreciate you coming.

738
00:40:47,349 --> 00:40:50,021
I agree that this war
is by far the worst ever

739
00:40:50,021 --> 00:40:53,653
in human history, and we
must find a way to end it.

740
00:40:53,653 --> 00:40:56,450
‐ Ever since Cain lifted
that rock to kill Abel,

741
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:59,080
violence between men has not ceased.

742
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:02,378
We're no closer to understanding
our fellow man either.

743
00:41:02,378 --> 00:41:04,424
What a deplorable state.

744
00:41:04,424 --> 00:41:06,678
Zeon Zum Deikun's intent

745
00:41:06,678 --> 00:41:09,935
was to liberate us from this old cycle.

746
00:41:09,935 --> 00:41:12,814
Though from space we are
still God's creation,

747
00:41:12,814 --> 00:41:14,652
subject to his laws,

748
00:41:14,652 --> 00:41:16,864
and as such might it be possible

749
00:41:16,864 --> 00:41:19,285
that the space immigrants'
hope for liberation

750
00:41:19,285 --> 00:41:22,208
surpasses that which
Earth's people once sought

751
00:41:22,208 --> 00:41:25,005
when they crossed over to the New World?

752
00:41:26,258 --> 00:41:29,597
That was Deikun thinking when he set forth

753
00:41:29,597 --> 00:41:31,810
his protocols for the new era.

754
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:35,901
A group of us as his comrades
gathered under that banner.

755
00:41:35,901 --> 00:41:39,826
But that this new humanity
would be used to justify

756
00:41:39,826 --> 00:41:43,249
such destruction is
something we never predicted.

757
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:49,302
Admiral Revil, is there nothing
we can do to defuse this?

758
00:41:49,302 --> 00:41:51,557
A way to somehow work together?

759
00:41:53,853 --> 00:41:56,232
‐ What could I possibly do?

760
00:41:56,232 --> 00:41:58,403
And how could I provide assistance?

761
00:41:58,403 --> 00:42:01,367
I am a prisoner of war right now.

762
00:42:01,367 --> 00:42:02,328
‐ Point taken.

763
00:42:07,755 --> 00:42:08,757
I hear you.

764
00:42:15,728 --> 00:42:18,734
And I understand you, Admiral Revil.

765
00:42:21,322 --> 00:42:22,992
I'm hardly the ideal man candidate

766
00:42:22,992 --> 00:42:25,246
to conduct such negotiations.

767
00:42:25,246 --> 00:42:28,044
‐ Is that because you
instead hope to invade Earth

768
00:42:28,044 --> 00:42:31,049
and restore the fruits of
our culture and civilization,

769
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:33,763
as well as our spiritual holy land?

770
00:42:33,763 --> 00:42:35,600
‐ You have surmised correctly.

771
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,896
‐ That makes you the
right man for the job.

772
00:42:37,896 --> 00:42:40,692
Make no mistake, the war must continue!

773
00:42:44,575 --> 00:42:47,540
Let me be clear,
Lieutenant General M'Quve.

774
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:50,754
You will not be going as
an emissary to end the war.

775
00:42:50,754 --> 00:42:54,344
You will be going there to
lead the Earth Invasion Force.

776
00:42:55,596 --> 00:42:58,310
I didn't come up with this idea on my own.

777
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:01,107
Supreme Commander Gihren
is of the same mind.

778
00:43:01,107 --> 00:43:04,364
We will seize the Earth's
bounty and her lands!

779
00:43:04,364 --> 00:43:06,785
Which is precisely why
we must send someone

780
00:43:07,745 --> 00:43:09,373
who can appreciate Earth's charms.

781
00:43:10,459 --> 00:43:14,425
‐ Would you mind it terribly
if I asked two questions first?

782
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,220
‐ Please do.

783
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,973
‐ As I'm sure you are aware,

784
00:43:17,973 --> 00:43:20,729
war requires there to be an opponent.

785
00:43:20,729 --> 00:43:22,356
In the event that the Federation

786
00:43:22,356 --> 00:43:24,611
has completely lost its will to fight,

787
00:43:24,611 --> 00:43:27,450
who do you then suggest
that we aim our fists at?

788
00:43:28,702 --> 00:43:30,956
‐ You said you had two questions for me.

789
00:43:30,956 --> 00:43:32,585
What was your second?

790
00:43:32,585 --> 00:43:34,171
‐ Ah, yes.

791
00:43:34,171 --> 00:43:36,175
What assurances do I have?

792
00:43:36,175 --> 00:43:39,389
My troops and I will be
parachuting into the enemy's lap.

793
00:43:39,389 --> 00:43:40,809
I'm sorry for my bluntness,

794
00:43:40,809 --> 00:43:43,606
but I've no wish to be a sacrificial pawn.

795
00:43:43,606 --> 00:43:45,860
‐ I shall address your second question.

796
00:43:46,946 --> 00:43:49,868
We have assigned Garma
Zabi to serve under you.

797
00:43:51,914 --> 00:43:55,922
My dear brother Garma, whom
my father, Sovereign Degwin,

798
00:43:55,922 --> 00:43:57,550
cherishes above all else.

799
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:01,474
You can be sure our sovereign
would never abandon you.

800
00:44:01,474 --> 00:44:04,229
What greater assurance could you ask for?

801
00:44:04,229 --> 00:44:09,239
And now, as for the answer
to your initial question,

802
00:44:11,618 --> 00:44:13,914
regardless of the time or place,

803
00:44:13,914 --> 00:44:17,045
mankind fundamentally desires warfare,

804
00:44:17,045 --> 00:44:18,757
because man is foolish.

805
00:44:18,757 --> 00:44:21,680
Sometimes war is the smartest choice.

806
00:44:24,018 --> 00:44:26,147
In terms of prolonging the war,

807
00:44:26,147 --> 00:44:28,067
plans are already in motion.

808
00:44:29,695 --> 00:44:31,907
Lieutenant General M'Quve,

809
00:44:31,907 --> 00:44:34,622
please try to rememeber this one thing.

810
00:44:34,622 --> 00:44:37,628
You aren't like those mediocre commanders,

811
00:44:37,628 --> 00:44:41,217
because you're a man who's
extraordinarily insightful.

812
00:44:42,553 --> 00:44:44,766
As for Supreme Commander Gihren,

813
00:44:46,645 --> 00:44:47,563
I detest him.

814
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:58,417
‐ What's so special
about that bastard M'Quve

815
00:44:58,417 --> 00:45:00,922
that he gets to represent Zeon?!

816
00:45:00,922 --> 00:45:05,138
He didn't so much as break
a sweat at Loum or Hatte!

817
00:45:05,138 --> 00:45:07,226
I simply cannot stand that guy!

818
00:45:08,144 --> 00:45:10,482
And to handle the peace
talks of all things!

819
00:45:10,482 --> 00:45:11,944
If it blows up in their faces

820
00:45:11,944 --> 00:45:14,365
they better not come crying to me!

821
00:45:14,365 --> 00:45:17,204
In all honesty though, I was concerned

822
00:45:17,204 --> 00:45:19,333
that a talented officer such as yourself

823
00:45:19,333 --> 00:45:20,919
would be going down there with him.

824
00:45:20,919 --> 00:45:23,424
I am happy to see you'll
be staying behind.

825
00:45:23,424 --> 00:45:25,678
‐ Earth doesn't really agree with me.

826
00:45:25,678 --> 00:45:28,392
I'm a true‐blooded Spacenoid
through and through.

827
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:31,440
He did approach me informally,
but I turned him down.

828
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,900
‐ Hmm.

829
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,446
Don't get me wrong here.

830
00:45:34,446 --> 00:45:37,325
I'm not in the habit of
squabbling over subordinates

831
00:45:37,325 --> 00:45:39,079
like a bunch of schoolchildren.

832
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:42,169
I have a good reason for
not wanting him to have you.

833
00:45:42,169 --> 00:45:44,882
I have a specific job in mind for you.

834
00:45:44,882 --> 00:45:46,260
‐ That so?

835
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:47,929
And what would that job be?

836
00:45:50,935 --> 00:45:53,900
‐ The Federation is developing
a brand new mobile suit.

837
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:56,613
The project's being conducted in secret.

838
00:45:56,613 --> 00:45:57,448
‐ Hmm.

839
00:45:57,448 --> 00:46:00,454
‐ Apparently its codename is Operation V.

840
00:46:00,454 --> 00:46:02,833
This development is being
carried out right now

841
00:46:02,833 --> 00:46:04,252
somewhere in space.

842
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:11,266
[suspenseful music]

843
00:46:37,734 --> 00:46:40,197
It was mobile suits that
ultimately determined

844
00:46:40,197 --> 00:46:42,285
the outcome of our recent battles.

845
00:46:42,285 --> 00:46:44,247
That said, even if I convinced them

846
00:46:44,247 --> 00:46:45,916
that Operation V is a threat,

847
00:46:45,916 --> 00:46:48,881
they still won't
understand its importance.

848
00:46:48,881 --> 00:46:52,387
That's the reason I'm giving
you the following orders.

849
00:46:52,387 --> 00:46:56,770
Pursue any clues you discover
and annihilate any resistance.

850
00:46:56,770 --> 00:47:01,155
Ssniff out Operation V's
headquarters and destroy it.

851
00:47:01,155 --> 00:47:02,657
‐ Sir.

852
00:47:02,657 --> 00:47:04,201
‐ I had a feeling you'd get it,

853
00:47:04,201 --> 00:47:06,707
how important this mission truly is.

854
00:47:06,707 --> 00:47:08,794
Which brings us now to this!

855
00:47:11,007 --> 00:47:15,265
Even if you are such a great
big hero of the Zeon Forces,

856
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:16,726
I don't expect you to carry out

857
00:47:16,726 --> 00:47:18,813
such a crucial mission by yourself.

858
00:47:20,107 --> 00:47:23,489
Look, that ship is now yours.

859
00:47:26,913 --> 00:47:29,167
Feast your eyes on The Falmer.

860
00:47:29,167 --> 00:47:30,461
I named her myself.

861
00:47:31,713 --> 00:47:34,886
She's a Musai that
surpasses all other Musai!

862
00:47:35,763 --> 00:47:38,267
She is my special gift to you.

863
00:47:38,267 --> 00:47:41,691
I even handpicked a crew
that's the best of the best.

864
00:47:41,691 --> 00:47:43,611
You will not have to answer to anyone.

865
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:46,575
This mission is your only priority.

866
00:47:46,575 --> 00:47:48,705
Do you have any questions?

867
00:47:48,705 --> 00:47:49,957
‐ I do not.

868
00:47:50,834 --> 00:47:52,086
Thank you sir.

869
00:47:52,086 --> 00:47:54,007

‐ We lucked out, this
baby is quite the ship!

873
00:48:22,144 --> 00:48:25,150
Next to my rundown old
Papua resupply vessel,

874
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:27,906
this beauty is so shiny
it's almost blinding,

875
00:48:27,906 --> 00:48:29,533
Congratulations, Captain.

876
00:48:29,533 --> 00:48:33,208
‐ You're the ship's captain
now, Lieutenant Dren.

877
00:48:34,125 --> 00:48:36,923
‐ You really shouldn't
joke about stuff like that,

878
00:48:36,923 --> 00:48:37,966
Lieutenant Commander.

879
00:48:37,966 --> 00:48:40,722
‐ Except I meant it in all seriousness.

880
00:48:40,722 --> 00:48:42,976
No matter how good the ship, rest assured

881
00:48:42,976 --> 00:48:46,316
I have absolutely zero desire
to be chained down by it.

882
00:48:46,316 --> 00:48:48,403
Do not forget this, my men.

883
00:48:48,403 --> 00:48:51,367
I have never once had the desire to become

884
00:48:51,367 --> 00:48:54,540
a fine sailor such as yourselves.

885
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:57,379
I prefer to be a warrior of the cosmos.

886
00:48:57,379 --> 00:48:59,258
A knight who possesses the freedom

887
00:48:59,258 --> 00:49:01,804
to race faster than any
ship across the heavens.

[laughs]

889
00:49:03,724 --> 00:49:06,146
Continue with the testing, Captain.

890
00:49:06,146 --> 00:49:07,607
‐ Of course sir!

891
00:49:07,607 --> 00:49:10,654
Then I, Lieutenant Dren, will humbly serve

892
00:49:10,654 --> 00:49:12,324
as acting captain!

893
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:15,372
We shall engage in combat
drills immediately!

894

Listen up, don't think of this as a drill.

00:49:24,222 --> 00:49:27,562
Treat this like a real combat situation!

899

Let us make for the
designated battle area!

Turn her about, 90 degrees to port!

‐ Permission to speak, ma'am.

‐ What is it?

‐ This name of this operation, Blue Bird,

909

what is it in reference to?

910
00:50:02,296 --> 00:50:05,134
‐ In the Cold War period of the old era,

911
00:50:05,134 --> 00:50:06,846
it was the name of the first film

912

jointly produced by America and the USSR.

Come with us.

What's going on?

919
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:44,753
I wasn't informed of any transfer.

Hmm?

right if I asked you something?

There'll be a launch scheduled
in that berthing bay,

so be ready to run for it.

in charge of this operation?

984
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:24,762
You're the captain though.

985
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:26,849
‐ [Officer] Distance, 7900!

986
00:54:26,849 --> 00:54:28,769
Speed has dropped off slightly.

987
00:54:30,022 --> 00:54:31,566
‐ They've spotted us.

988
00:54:31,566 --> 00:54:32,860
What now?

989
00:54:35,156 --> 00:54:36,283
‐ What the heck?

990
00:54:36,283 --> 00:54:38,663
This wasn't part of the original plan!

991
00:54:38,663 --> 00:54:40,709
I thought you said that
there weren't going to be

992
00:54:40,709 --> 00:54:42,670
any warships in this area!

993
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:45,134
‐ [Officer] The Musai closing in, sir!

994
00:54:45,134 --> 00:54:46,929
‐ Why don't you order them to stop?

995
00:54:49,476 --> 00:54:51,062
We've discovered an enemy ship

996
00:54:51,062 --> 00:54:53,233
in a sector where there should be none.

997
00:54:53,233 --> 00:54:56,030
There are two ways to
deal with this situation.

998
00:54:56,030 --> 00:54:59,662
You can capture it, or you
can choose to destroy it.

999
00:54:59,662 --> 00:55:02,709
Well Captain, wouldn't you agree?

1000
00:55:02,709 --> 00:55:04,255
‐ Yes, of course.

1001
00:55:06,049 --> 00:55:08,136
Attention, Federation vessel!

1002
00:55:08,136 --> 00:55:09,807
Halt immediately!

1003
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:13,146
This is the Falmer, with
Lieutenant Commander Char Aznable!

1004
00:55:13,146 --> 00:55:16,236
And so any resistance is futile.

1005
00:55:16,236 --> 00:55:18,114
You will stop at once!

1006
00:55:18,114 --> 00:55:19,534
‐ Did he say Char?

1007
00:55:19,534 --> 00:55:21,955
‐ He's the one who destroyed
five battleships at Loum,

1008
00:55:21,955 --> 00:55:22,790
and is known as...

1009

‐ The Red Comet.

1010
00:55:24,669 --> 00:55:27,549
‐ Of all people, why did we run into him?

1011
00:55:28,467 --> 00:55:31,223
‐ [Dren] I repeat, halt at once!

1012
00:55:31,223 --> 00:55:32,058
‐ Dren.

1013
00:55:32,058 --> 00:55:32,892
‐ Huh?

1014
00:55:32,892 --> 00:55:34,855
‐ Let's fire a warning shot.

1015
00:55:34,855 --> 00:55:35,773
A volley.

Turret 1, aim starboard of the enemy ship!

Turrets 2 and 3, aim to
the ship's port side!

1020
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:49,925
This is a warning!

1021
00:55:49,925 --> 00:55:51,011
Got that?

1022
00:55:51,011 --> 00:55:52,347
Don't hit them!

1023
00:55:52,347 --> 00:55:55,144
‐ This is Turret 1, we
have target acquisition.

1024

‐ This is Turrets 2 and
3, we're aimed and ready.

Dren, I'm going out in my Zaku.

Have Denim provide cover.

Pull up alongside them and wait.

Hold on, Lieutenant Commander Char,

you're not supposed to leave the...

[eerie music]

1038
00:57:08,368 --> 00:57:11,793
‐ That thing must be Zeon's
brand new mobile suit, the Zaku.

1039
00:57:11,793 --> 00:57:13,545
‐ I've never seen one before!

‐ A red Zaku.

1041
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:16,468
‐ That's the Red Comet!

[gasps]

00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:38,051
we are currently at war.

1045
00:57:38,051 --> 00:57:41,391
By all rights, we should've
destroyed you without warning.

1046
00:57:43,395 --> 00:57:46,651
What would possess you to
sneak into the heart of Zeon?

1047
00:57:46,651 --> 00:57:48,196
How did you manage it?

1048
00:57:50,367 --> 00:57:52,328
And for what end?

1049
00:57:52,328 --> 00:57:54,709
‐ There's just one of
him, we can take him.

‐ I doubt that this is a
reconnaissance or sabotage mission.

Pardon the presumptuousness of my asking,

00:58:46,141 --> 00:58:49,146
but am I standing in the
presence of Admiral Revil?

1061
00:58:52,361 --> 00:58:55,409
‐ That is correct, I'm
indeed Admiral Revil.

1062
00:58:55,409 --> 00:58:57,287
‐ And what will you do
with that knowledge,

1063
00:58:57,287 --> 00:59:01,754
are you a Zeon officer who
is faithful to his duty?

Please forgive me for so rudely
interrupting your journey.

Admiral, I wish you safe travels.

1068
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:23,505
‐ Lieutenant, Lieutenant Commander Char

1069
00:59:23,505 --> 00:59:24,966
has disembarked from the ship!

00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:30,060
I guess there's no reason
for me to get involved, then.

1072

‐ [Officer] He seems to
be returning to his Zaku.

Should we really be turning a blind eye?

1077

Sir, they violated our territory!

1078
00:59:49,305 --> 00:59:50,808
‐ [Char] It's fine, Dren.

1079
00:59:50,808 --> 00:59:54,649
That was a treasure ship that
was far too rich for my blood.

1080
00:59:54,649 --> 00:59:57,612
We came very close to
ruining a brilliant bit

Not so well that I'd hire you

In light of my future prospects,

1089
01:00:42,574 --> 01:00:45,079
your company doesn't even make my list.

1090

I think he would be an excellent choice.

What do you say, buddy?

It's about your father.

Just like I always suspected.

And why is it so hush‐hush?

He's trying to get us

01:04:06,385 --> 01:04:07,512
Damn you!

1144
01:04:07,512 --> 01:04:08,514
Stop, thieves!

1145
01:04:08,514 --> 01:04:09,766
Activating security mode!

[shouts]

1147
01:04:11,269 --> 01:04:12,104
Haro!

1148
01:04:19,535 --> 01:04:22,958
‐ I won't divulge to Chief Ray
what you tried to pull today.

1149
01:04:22,958 --> 01:04:26,758
But you aren't to say anything
to anyone either, got that?

1150
01:04:26,758 --> 01:04:28,762
This is your one and only warning.

1151
01:04:30,556 --> 01:04:32,769
‐ Well, that was completely useless.

1152
01:04:40,534 --> 01:04:41,369
Hmm?

1153
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,504

[suspenseful music]

1156
01:04:59,612 --> 01:05:01,741
‐ Amuro, I'm so sorry.

1157
01:05:01,741 --> 01:05:03,495
I was taken off guard.

1158
01:05:03,495 --> 01:05:05,499
They got the best of me.

[suspenseful music]

1161
01:06:02,901 --> 01:06:04,154
‐ [Reporter] Ladies and gentlemen,

1162
01:06:04,154 --> 01:06:08,203
we come to you today from Scott
City, located in Antarctica.

1163
01:06:08,203 --> 01:06:11,877
This is the picturesque setting
where historic peace talks

1164
01:06:11,877 --> 01:06:13,380
are about to take place.

1165
01:06:16,344 --> 01:06:17,429
‐ I see.

1166
01:06:17,429 --> 01:06:18,974
That's good to hear.

1167
01:06:18,974 --> 01:06:20,310
Nicely done.

1168
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:22,565
I'll request a special two‐rank promotion

1169
01:06:22,565 --> 01:06:23,775
for the entire team.

1170
01:06:24,861 --> 01:06:27,574
‐ [Judock] Commander
Judock reporting, sir!

1171
01:06:28,534 --> 01:06:30,873
‐ Have the media arrangements
been taken care of?

1172
01:06:30,873 --> 01:06:31,790
‐ Yes sir!

1173
01:06:31,790 --> 01:06:35,130
Most major stations on Earth,
as well as the colony sphere,

1174
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:37,343
have their live feeds set up.

1175
01:06:37,343 --> 01:06:38,470
‐ Hmm.

1176
01:06:38,470 --> 01:06:40,056
‐ This will be a speech that will go down

1177
01:06:40,056 --> 01:06:41,434
in the history books!

1178
01:06:47,321 --> 01:06:49,241
‐ I'll be honest, it'll
be difficult for us

1179
01:06:49,241 --> 01:06:50,452
to lose you right now.

1180
01:06:51,787 --> 01:06:53,791
At the same time, I understand if you feel

1181
01:06:53,791 --> 01:06:57,256
that you cannot remain here
while we are under Zeon control.

1182
01:06:59,302 --> 01:07:03,018
Now, that said, I can
assist you with a transfer.

1183
01:07:03,018 --> 01:07:06,274
Would you be interested
in taking a job at Side 7?

1184
01:07:06,274 --> 01:07:08,069
‐ At Side 7?

1185
01:07:08,069 --> 01:07:09,363
Why there?

1186
01:07:09,363 --> 01:07:12,118
‐ Well I know it's out
in the middle of nowhere.

1187
01:07:12,118 --> 01:07:14,373
However it is free from Zeon influence.

1188
01:07:15,792 --> 01:07:17,545
And this is Luna II.

1189
01:07:17,545 --> 01:07:19,633
The Federation forces
still have control of it,

1190
01:07:19,633 --> 01:07:20,718
at least for now.

1191
01:07:25,102 --> 01:07:26,689
‐ And is that it?

1192
01:07:26,689 --> 01:07:28,149
Side 7?

1193
01:07:28,149 --> 01:07:28,985
‐ Yes.

1194
01:07:28,985 --> 01:07:32,199
You see it's a development
area located opposite

1195
01:07:32,199 --> 01:07:33,034
Zeon's Side 3.

1196
01:07:34,078 --> 01:07:36,374
And because of that I
doubt they would ever

1197
01:07:36,374 --> 01:07:38,336
want to bother with it.

1198
01:07:38,336 --> 01:07:40,297
There's a construction worker population

1199
01:07:40,297 --> 01:07:42,176
of about 30,000 there.

1200
01:07:42,176 --> 01:07:45,516
They live in a remote frontier
town without a doctor.

1201
01:07:45,516 --> 01:07:47,895
Regardless of the current
political climate,

1202
01:07:47,895 --> 01:07:51,027
as a doctor, I just
can't turn a blind eye.

1203
01:07:51,027 --> 01:07:51,862
‐ I can do it.

1204
01:07:51,862 --> 01:07:52,697
I'll go.

1205
01:07:53,949 --> 01:07:55,536
I'll go to Side 7!

1206
01:07:56,663 --> 01:08:00,086
‐ In Scott City, where peace
talks are already underway,

1207
01:08:00,086 --> 01:08:03,760
delegates from both sides
are beginning to arrive.

1208
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:06,724
Representing Zeon is
Lieutenant General M'Quve.

1209
01:08:06,724 --> 01:08:10,565
Representing the Federation
Forces is Admiral Gopp.

1210
01:08:10,565 --> 01:08:13,320
Will the talks be successful
and peace reached?

1211
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:14,697
It remains to be seen.

1212
01:08:16,159 --> 01:08:19,123
[suspenseful music]

1213
01:08:32,941 --> 01:08:36,573
‐ We've been awaiting your
arrival, Admiral Revil.

1214
01:08:36,573 --> 01:08:37,408
‐ Good day.

1215
01:08:37,408 --> 01:08:38,702
Nice to see you, Wakken.

1216
01:08:40,832 --> 01:08:42,584
I'm happy to know you're still alive.

1217
01:08:43,503 --> 01:08:45,549
I'm very sorry for what happened at Loum.

1218
01:08:46,843 --> 01:08:48,721
‐ Please hurry, sir.

1219
01:08:48,721 --> 01:08:50,057
We don't have much time.

1220
01:08:54,483 --> 01:08:55,317
‐ Elran!

1221
01:08:56,988 --> 01:08:59,075
I must say I'm surprised.

1222
01:08:59,075 --> 01:09:01,914
That was quite the little
miracle you pulled off there.

1223
01:09:01,914 --> 01:09:04,252
‐ Nothing gets past you, Admiral Gopp.

1224
01:09:04,252 --> 01:09:06,046
Word travels fast I see.

1225
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:08,802
‐ Hardly.

1226
01:09:08,802 --> 01:09:11,933
The entire general staff
knows about this one.

1227
01:09:11,933 --> 01:09:15,190
What do you suppose Revil's
going to say in his speech?

1228
01:09:15,190 --> 01:09:17,110
‐ One can only imagine.

1229
01:09:17,110 --> 01:09:19,156
[chuckles]

1230
01:09:19,156 --> 01:09:22,161
‐ I imagine these negotiations
we are about to engage in

1231
01:09:22,161 --> 01:09:24,248
will be a complete waste of effort.

1232
01:09:24,248 --> 01:09:26,377
‐ I wouldn't go that far, sir.

1233
01:09:26,377 --> 01:09:29,300
Settling on a wartime
treaty would be worthwhile.

1234
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:32,306
We could have a ban on
nuclear, biological,

1235
01:09:32,306 --> 01:09:33,767
and chemical weapons.

1236
01:09:33,767 --> 01:09:35,562
And of course, let's not forget

1237
01:09:35,562 --> 01:09:38,735
the use of colonies or
asteroids as superbombs.

1238
01:09:38,735 --> 01:09:41,073
‐ If I'm understanding you correctly,

1239
01:09:41,073 --> 01:09:43,577
have your war, just do it cleanly?

1240
01:09:43,577 --> 01:09:45,832

[alarm buzzing]

01:10:10,421 --> 01:10:12,091
‐ We go live in 15 seconds!

1244
01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:18,186
10 seconds!

1245
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:22,110
Five seconds!

1246
01:10:22,110 --> 01:10:23,279
Four!

1247
01:10:23,279 --> 01:10:24,114
Three!

1248
01:10:29,166 --> 01:10:31,545
‐ Citizens of the Earth Sphere,

1249
01:10:31,545 --> 01:10:35,678
I am Johann Ibrahim Revil.

1250
01:10:35,678 --> 01:10:37,349
[gasping]

1251
01:10:37,349 --> 01:10:40,480
As an admiral of the Earth
Federation Space Forces,

1252
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:43,694
I led the operation at
our allied nation of Loum.

1253
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:48,370
This ended in a resounding defeat for us.

1254
01:10:48,370 --> 01:10:50,415
Since I was the commander in charge,

1255
01:10:50,415 --> 01:10:54,214
the fault can only lay in my
strategy and combat leadership.

1256
01:10:54,214 --> 01:10:55,592
‐ Is that for real?

1257
01:10:55,592 --> 01:10:57,930
‐ Why is he in a field officer's uniform?

1258
01:10:57,930 --> 01:10:58,848
‐ Shh.

1259
01:10:58,848 --> 01:11:01,645
‐ As you are aware, I was
injured in the battle,

1260
01:11:01,645 --> 01:11:05,194
taken prisoner, and held
in the Zeon homeland.

1261
01:11:05,194 --> 01:11:07,740
The only reason I am able
to speak to you today

1262
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:11,957
from an allied base is because
I was rescued from captivity

1263
01:11:11,957 --> 01:11:15,004
by a group of valiant
soldiers from our forces.

1264
01:11:15,004 --> 01:11:16,757
[gasping]

1265
01:11:16,757 --> 01:11:20,223
We lost hundreds of thousands of soldiers,

1266
01:11:20,223 --> 01:11:23,186
as well as a great many warships.

1267
01:11:23,186 --> 01:11:26,192
I take full responsibility for all of it.

1268
01:11:27,194 --> 01:11:29,867
The fact that I was
rescued by the very forces

1269
01:11:29,867 --> 01:11:32,788
that I robbed of both glory and pride

1270
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:35,753
is solely thanks to the grace of God.

1271
01:11:35,753 --> 01:11:37,298
[chuckles]

1272
01:11:37,298 --> 01:11:39,050
‐ Lieutenant Dren.

1273
01:11:39,050 --> 01:11:40,094
‐ Hmm, what?

1274
01:11:40,094 --> 01:11:42,432
‐ You should all be listening to this.

1275
01:11:42,432 --> 01:11:44,686
‐ And I take it as a sign from God

1276
01:11:44,686 --> 01:11:48,277
that I must do something
redeem the loss and disgrace‐‐

1277
01:11:48,277 --> 01:11:50,448
‐ [Char] The curtain is
about to rise on a new act.

1278
01:11:50,448 --> 01:11:53,829
A second act, in which I
guarantee there's no God.

1279
01:11:53,829 --> 01:11:55,833
‐ If you decide that I can be entrusted

1280
01:11:55,833 --> 01:11:57,336
with that duty once again,

1281
01:11:57,336 --> 01:12:01,511
you can be assured I would
devote myself body and soul

1282
01:12:01,511 --> 01:12:04,350
to making up for that horrendous defeat!

1283
01:12:04,350 --> 01:12:05,894
[gasping]

1284
01:12:05,894 --> 01:12:08,733
Of course, I am aware
that we are in the process

1285
01:12:08,733 --> 01:12:13,116
of peace negotiations in
Antarctica at this very moment.

1286
01:12:13,116 --> 01:12:16,248
Naturally, I am praying for peace as well.

1287
01:12:16,248 --> 01:12:20,798
However, a truce must not be
signed at this point in time,

1288
01:12:20,798 --> 01:12:25,306
because this would not be a
truce, it would be a surrender!

1289
01:12:25,306 --> 01:12:27,561
[gasping]

1290
01:12:27,561 --> 01:12:30,149
It means that the good people of Earth,

1291
01:12:30,149 --> 01:12:33,531
with their long history of
culture and civilization,

1292
01:12:33,531 --> 01:12:37,079
would be giving up all they've
known to authoritarian rule!

1293
01:12:38,708 --> 01:12:42,047
[dramatic music]

1294
01:12:42,047 --> 01:12:43,885
‐ Rot in hell, Revil!

1295
01:12:46,222 --> 01:12:47,766
‐ [Page] Excuse me, sir.

1296
01:12:47,766 --> 01:12:50,939
The commanders of the
Earth Expeditionary Force

1297
01:12:50,939 --> 01:12:53,361
have been waiting outside
to receive your blessing,

1298
01:12:53,361 --> 01:12:54,447
Sovereign.

1299
01:12:54,447 --> 01:12:55,782
‐ Be right there.

1300
01:13:05,676 --> 01:13:09,183
‐ Well then Father, I am taking my leave.

1301
01:13:10,018 --> 01:13:12,732
I've been promoted to colonel
for my distinguished service

1302
01:13:12,732 --> 01:13:14,443
in the Loum mop‐up.

1303
01:13:14,443 --> 01:13:18,117
I'll be taking command of
the North American Force,

1304
01:13:18,117 --> 01:13:19,370
the Western Sector!

1305
01:13:22,584 --> 01:13:25,381
‐ Listen closely, Garma.

1306
01:13:25,381 --> 01:13:28,220
You go out there and
silence those ingrates!

1307
01:13:29,639 --> 01:13:30,850
‐ Yes.

1308
01:13:30,850 --> 01:13:33,146
‐ Go out there and crush the souls

1309
01:13:33,146 --> 01:13:36,068
of ever lost one of those
war‐loving Earthers!

1310
01:13:41,078 --> 01:13:42,707
‐ [Revil] It was a grand
endeavor that only succeeded‐‐

1311
01:13:42,707 --> 01:13:45,753
‐ I can't believe how
behind schedule they are.

1312
01:13:45,753 --> 01:13:48,134
All this extra construction is pointless.

1313
01:13:49,469 --> 01:13:52,099
‐ [Revil] Zeon slaughtered
billions of innocent people.

1314
01:13:52,099 --> 01:13:55,481
These people were the backbone
of that grand enterprise!

1315
01:13:55,481 --> 01:13:57,151
‐ It's so peaceful, isn't it?

1316
01:13:57,151 --> 01:14:01,910
‐ One can only hope that this
place will remain peaceful.

1317
01:14:03,163 --> 01:14:07,045
‐ Why did they dare carry
out as barbaric an act

1318
01:14:07,045 --> 01:14:10,092
as dropping a colony full
of civilians onto Earth?

1319
01:14:10,092 --> 01:14:12,806
‐ Do you think this means
the war will continue?

1320
01:14:12,806 --> 01:14:13,850
‐ I do.

1321
01:14:13,850 --> 01:14:16,396
Their taste for destruction
hasn't been sated.

1322
01:14:16,396 --> 01:14:18,985
Humanity hasn't taken this
thing as far as it can go,

1323
01:14:18,985 --> 01:14:20,946
not by a long shot.

1324
01:14:20,946 --> 01:14:22,867
‐ [Revil] And so I beg
you, citizens of Earth,

1325
01:14:22,867 --> 01:14:27,000
you must not believe the
lies of Degwin and Gihren!

1326
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,588
‐ [Father] Regardless of what people say,

1327
01:14:29,588 --> 01:14:32,094
humanity has a desire for war.

1328
01:14:37,521 --> 01:14:39,858
[laughing]

1329
01:14:47,790 --> 01:14:48,625
‐ Hey!

1330
01:14:50,129 --> 01:14:51,297
The water's great!

1331
01:14:51,297 --> 01:14:53,260
Why don't you guys come in and play?

1332
01:14:54,428 --> 01:14:57,768
‐ Kai sir, I think she's
asking us a question.

1333
01:14:59,563 --> 01:15:01,860
And what are you doing, anyway?

1334
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:05,658
‐ Some military bigshot is
giving an important speech.

1335
01:15:05,658 --> 01:15:07,662
And I'm listening to it!

1336
01:15:07,662 --> 01:15:08,581
‐ Oh wow.

1337
01:15:08,581 --> 01:15:11,419
So does this mean the war
is going to be ending soon?

1338
01:15:11,419 --> 01:15:13,506
‐ Based on this speech,

1339
01:15:13,506 --> 01:15:15,552
I would say it doesn't seem very likely.

1340
01:15:15,552 --> 01:15:16,554
You know how it is.

1341
01:15:22,816 --> 01:15:24,235
[laughs]

1342
01:15:24,235 --> 01:15:25,070
‐ Amuro!

1343
01:15:27,158 --> 01:15:29,662
Hey, come play in the water with us!

1344
01:15:29,662 --> 01:15:32,001
I promise you it'll be fun!

1345
01:15:37,637 --> 01:15:40,643
[groaning]

1346
01:15:40,643 --> 01:15:43,189
‐ [Child] Hey look, it's Hayato!

1347
01:15:43,189 --> 01:15:45,109
Wanna play with us in the water?

1348
01:15:45,109 --> 01:15:45,945
It's super fun!

1349
01:15:45,945 --> 01:15:46,988
‐ [Hayato] Sorry, I can't.

1350
01:15:46,988 --> 01:15:48,366
I have to go to practice.

1351
01:15:49,493 --> 01:15:52,164
[children whining]

1352
01:15:52,164 --> 01:15:53,542
Cut it out!

1353
01:15:53,542 --> 01:15:54,795
Hey, stop pulling!

1354
01:15:56,507 --> 01:15:57,759
[shouts]

1355
01:15:57,759 --> 01:16:00,013
[laughing]

1356
01:16:07,194 --> 01:16:09,949
[dramatic music]

1357
01:16:16,795 --> 01:16:17,965
‐ On the other side of that,

1358
01:16:17,965 --> 01:16:19,634
I bet that's where the Gundam is.

1359
01:16:29,946 --> 01:16:30,906
[laughing]

1360
01:16:30,906 --> 01:16:31,741
‐ Hey now.

1361
01:16:34,371 --> 01:16:35,206
Let's see.

1362
01:16:39,088 --> 01:16:41,469
Hey baby, come play with us!

1363
01:16:41,469 --> 01:16:43,806
You seem kinda bored.

1364
01:16:43,806 --> 01:16:46,728
I promise we'll show you a real good time!

1365
01:16:46,728 --> 01:16:48,940
Hey, what are you listening too, anyway?

1366
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:51,404
It doesn't look to me
like you're enjoying it.

1367
01:16:52,573 --> 01:16:55,244
‐ I'll let you listen if you want.

1368
01:16:55,244 --> 01:16:57,332
But you just have to be quiet,

1369
01:16:57,332 --> 01:16:59,712
because it's a very important speech.

1370
01:16:59,712 --> 01:17:02,717
‐ I urge you to not overestimate Zeon,

1371
01:17:02,717 --> 01:17:05,598
because remember, with its limited

1372
01:17:05,598 --> 01:17:07,685
human and material resources,

1373
01:17:07,685 --> 01:17:09,856
there's no way Zeon can continue fighting

1374
01:17:09,856 --> 01:17:11,693
for that much longer!

1375
01:17:19,667 --> 01:17:23,633
We must not lose our courage
and play into their hands.

1376
01:17:23,633 --> 01:17:26,722
We must continue to fight
for what we know to be right.

1377
01:17:34,154 --> 01:17:36,616
There are no soldiers in Zeon!

1378
01:17:36,616 --> 01:17:39,581
So we are certain to be
victorious in this war!

1379
01:17:42,127 --> 01:17:45,133
[upbeat rock music]

[singing in foreign language]

01:22:35,694 --> 01:22:38,533
[dramatic music]

1382
01:22:48,218 --> 01:22:50,765
‐ Atmospheric exit is complete.

1383
01:22:50,765 --> 01:22:52,643
Target orbit has been achieved.

1384
01:22:52,643 --> 01:22:55,316
Accelerating, and now
setting a course for Luna II.

1385
01:23:01,953 --> 01:23:05,502
‐ She sure is a mighty fine
vessel, isn't she, Mr. Bright?

1386
01:23:05,502 --> 01:23:06,504
‐ She is.

1387
01:23:06,504 --> 01:23:08,591
‐ Yeah, we're lucky to
have this state of the art,

1388
01:23:08,591 --> 01:23:11,221
Minovsky Craft‐equipped ship, all right.

1389
01:23:11,221 --> 01:23:13,433
I'll admit, it's quite
the thrilling experience

1390
01:23:13,433 --> 01:23:15,145
for this old reservist.

1391
01:23:15,145 --> 01:23:17,566
All we have to do now
is complete our mission,

1392
01:23:17,566 --> 01:23:18,735
isn't that right?

1393
01:23:18,735 --> 01:23:19,570
‐ Yes sir.

1394
01:23:23,995 --> 01:23:25,833
‐ Where's Chief Tem Ray?

1395
01:23:25,833 --> 01:23:27,448
‐ He's in his cabin, sir.

1396
01:23:27,448 --> 01:23:30,660
I can show him to the
bridge later if you'd like.

1397
01:23:30,660 --> 01:23:31,494
‐ Mhmm.

1398
01:23:32,995 --> 01:23:34,038
‐ At last.

1399
01:23:35,665 --> 01:23:37,667
I thought the day would never be here!

1400
01:23:39,168 --> 01:23:42,463
Amuro, your father has done it!

1401
01:23:43,965 --> 01:23:45,508
The Gundam is finally complete!

1402
01:23:47,510 --> 01:23:49,762
I haven't made life easy for you, have I?

1403
01:23:53,516 --> 01:23:56,018
[light music]

1404
01:24:08,990 --> 01:24:11,784
‐ [Narrator] But who will survive?
