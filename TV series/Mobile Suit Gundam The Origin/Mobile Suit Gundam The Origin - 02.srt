1
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,000
[NARRATOR:] It was a time
when humanity set out

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,800
into space in search
of new lands.

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,960
And they gave that time
the name: Universal Century.

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,040
Humanity entrusted their future

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,280
to gigantic space colonies

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,520
that had been constructed
around the Earth.

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,160
However, this second homeland

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,240
was a far cry from the paradise
they had been promised.

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,880
Universal Century 0057

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,480
In Side 3, the cluster
furthest from Earth,

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,880
there appeared a leader

12
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,400
who called for
Spacenoid independence

13
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,160
and the reformation of
the human race.

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,440
This man's name was
Zeon Zum Deikun.

15
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,920
It appeared to the people
that the Earth Sphere

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,160
would advance even further
under his leadership.

17
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,040
But instead, this was merely the
beginning of a thorny path

18
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,040
that would lead to a war

19
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,480
more tragic than any prior
in human history.

20
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,920
At Side 3, also known as Munzo,

21
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,600
Deikun founded an
independent government

22
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,800
and managed to convince the
Earth Federation Government

23
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,080
to grant them
conditional autonomy.

24
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,040
However, Deikun's struggle
to expand that autonomy

25
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,600
and his quest for an
eventual independence

26
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,280
was met with a harsh crackdown
by the Earth Federation Forces.

27
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,160
U.C. 0068.

28
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,280
Deikun stood before
the Munzo Diet

29
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,120
to deliver what would be an
historic address.

30
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,080
He was going to demand the
withdrawal of the EFF’s
garrison force

31
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,040
and issue a de facto
declaration of independence.

32
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,080
However...

33
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,160
Just as he was about to begin
his speech, Deikun collapsed.

34
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,600
Deikun's sudden death led to
rumors of foul play.

35
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,200
We want freedom!

36
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,400
The people believed the
Federation
assassinated Zeon Deikun.

37
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,680
And even from within
the Deikun camp,

38
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,120
long‐held tensions suddenly
erupted into
factional infighting.

39
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,040
Degwin Zabi, a longtime
supporter of Deikun,

40
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,440
known for being his
right‐hand man,

41
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,240
did not let such an
opportunity pass him by.

42
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,240
Which one of you is
responsible for this?!

43
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,880
He and his faction
defeated the rival Ral family,

44
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,920
who had been harboring
Deikun’s next of kin,

45
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,440
and for all intents
and purposes,

46
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,680
he seized power in Munzo.

47
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,120
Deikun's widow, Astraia, was
locked in a tower

48
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,000
by Deikun’s first wife.

49
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,840
However, her children, Casval
and Artesia along
with Jimba Ral,

50
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,000
with the help of Munzo Defence
Force Captain Ramba Ral

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,360
and his partner‐in‐crime
Crowley Hamon,

52
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,640
managed to sneak
aboard a shuttle

53
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,200
and narrowly escape to Earth.

54
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,560
My enemy, your enemy,
even Mother's, everyone's enemy!

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,920
And I’m gonna take them out!

56
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,920
The two young children
suddenly found themselves

57
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,520
facing a vast, unfamiliar world
as well as a cruel fate.

58
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,520
A fate that would utterly
transform their persons,

59
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,520
especially that of Casval,

60
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,480
who would learn of the dark
struggles that burden adults.

61
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,400
It was this that would transform
him into the Red Comet.

62
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,720
Into Char Aznable.

63
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:20,160
MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM THE ORIGIN II

64
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,280
Andalusia, Spain

65
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,280
[VILLAGER] Miss, you aren’t from
around here, are you?

66
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,440
You're ten?

67
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,440
I never would have guessed.

68
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,520
You're awfully mature for ten.

69
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,920
Thank you for your help.

70
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,920
I bet you'll make a
wonderful doctor someday.

71
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,320
What? You really
live over there?

72
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,320
Well, that sure is a surprise!

73
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,800
[VILLAGER:] Why, that means
you’re a princess!

74
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:02,200
Artesia's Sorrow

75
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,800
[TEABOLO:] Do you suppose the
influx of refugees

76
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,520
will slow down any time soon?

77
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,240
[WOMAN:] I highly doubt it.

78
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,880
The camps get more
crowded every day.

79
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,440
Algiers and Marrakesh have both
been swallowed by sand.

80
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,600
And now reports say North Africa

81
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,360
is no longer fit for
human habitation.

82
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,520
We needed more radical
and comprehensive

83
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,880
policies to combat
climate change.

84
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,320
Father!

85
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm back!

86
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Stop, Miss Sayla! Hold on!

87
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You must disinfect
yourself first thing

88
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,280
after returning from the camp!

89
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,520
Is that the girl I've
heard so much about?

90
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,680
It is.

91
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,840
Oh, my!

92
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,840
You could’ve fooled me!

93
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,000
We do pass for father and
daughter, don’t we?

94
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,680
To be quite honest, I wasn't
keen on the idea at first.

95
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,960
Even if it was for an old
friend of mine,

96
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,560
I don’t need to risk
getting pulled

97
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,000
into a space colony political
struggle that has nothing
to do with me.

98
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,680
But for the first time, I
understand what it’s like,

99
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,120
the happiness that comes
with having a family.

100
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,600
My goodness! Aren't you going to
take a shower, young lady?

101
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,280
[ARTESIA:] I don't need to!

102
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,920
I'll just rinse off in the pool!

103
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,920
[MAID:] Be careful!
Stop running!

104
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,720
[MR. RAL:] Mr. Casval! Focus,
we’re not done!

105
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,440
This is the most important
part of the lesson!

106
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,800
When he had the realization of
the historic duty of Spacenoids

107
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,040
and turned mankind’s
reformation into an ideology,

108
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,960
that was the moment when the
grand concept of
Newtypes was born!

109
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,520
In every age, prophets have
been solitary figures.

110
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,960
Even Deikun's ideology was not
readily accepted by
the people...

111
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,640
Are you listening to me?!
Master Casval!

112
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,880
Of course.

113
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,120
Then let us continue.

114
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,880
Only after humankind has
gone into space

115
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,640
where they can see the Earth as
a single living organism

116
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,680
that a time of evolution
finally arrived!

117
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,440
These Newtypes will not only

118
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,600
transcend imperfect human
communication,

119
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,640
but they will achieve true
mutual understanding,

120
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,720
and gain new physical
possibilities,

121
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,480
to become this world’s
most eminent...

122
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,480
[ARTESIA:] What's wrong with me?

123
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,960
Your land will go to good use,
Don Teabolo.

124
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,960
Please, think nothing of it.

125
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,960
It's an honor to be able to be
of service, High Commissioner.

126
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,800
I ask only that public
safety and sanitation

127
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,720
is carefully monitored.

128
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,400
[MR. RAL:] Which
brings us to now!

129
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,120
Munzo is trying to rebrand
itself by calling itself Zeon!
The audacity!

130
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,600
Spearheaded by those Zabi swine,

131
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,720
who were responsible for the
murder of Zeon Deikun!

132
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,360
There’s no doubt in my mind that
your father was
clearly poisoned!

133
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,840
They gave him small doses of
poison over time to weaken his
heart, until finally he —

134
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,360
Come in, Miss Artesia! You have
such perfect timing!

135
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,480
I’ve already heard the
poison story.

136
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,840
Edouard, I don’t feel good.

137
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,520
What? Do you think
you’re getting sick?

138
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,720
You have a fever.

139
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,600
There’s a chance it's
just a cold.

140
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,600
You should take some
medicine and go to bed.

141
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,240
Master Casval! We need to
schedule your next lesson!

142
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,880
His name is Edouard now!

143
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,680
And you should really start
calling me Sayla Mass!

144
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,160
Boy, oh boy.

145
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,120
Being able to watch little ones
grow up is a blessing,

146
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,760
however, at the same time...

147
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,880
Hm? What is it?

148
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,640
I beg your pardon, but you
have a visitor, sir.

149
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,760
Oh! He's here!

150
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,520
[TEABOLO:] I won't allow you to
do these kinds of things

151
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,560
behind my back!

152
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,720
A Welfare Department official?

153
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,360
Don't lie to me!

154
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,120
That was Anaheim's executive VP,
Chelsea!

155
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,200
That man used to be my
business rival!

156
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,600
I could pick his face
out of a lineup!

157
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,160
Now that we’re clear,

158
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,560
we can talk about this further,
back in my office.

159
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,390
Start talking.

160
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:45,080
What exactly was it you were
discussing with them?

161
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,560
F‐Forgive me!

162
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,240
Let me guess, you're planning a
counteroffensive against Side 3?

163
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,120
You dare do such a thing
without informing me?!

164
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,800
I won't allow it! Besides, it
doesn't have a chance in
hell of succeeding!

165
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:02,200
But...if we don’t try,
we’ll never know!

166
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,240
And Anaheim reassured me that
they will give us

167
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,000
their full backing! Weapons!
Funding!

168
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,520
And also, they even say
they'll start lobbying

169
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,880
key Federation figures
on our behalf!

170
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,960
How can we not succeed with
that type of support?

171
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,560
Besides, we have something
else on our side...

172
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,840
Go on, I’m curious to know.

173
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,360
On our side, we have...the
children of Deikun!

174
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,240
We have all the pieces to
bring down the Zabis!

175
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,880
It couldn’t be more perfect!

176
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,360
Deikun’s heirs will be
their downfall!

177
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,960
The Zabis' power is flimsy!

178
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,280
In contrast, Deikun's influence
shines more brightly than
ever in his absence!

179
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,200
And when everyone sees
the fine youths

180
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,400
that Casval and Artesia
have grown into,

181
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,560
they won’t be able to resist
flocking to our side!

182
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,800
Edouard and Sayla are
my children.

183
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,800
Those children are legally
members of the Mass family

184
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,400
because you said they would
never survive otherwise.

185
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,600
Surely you realize that was only
a temporary arrangement!

186
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,600
You are going too far!

187
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,440
I'll never let you claim
Deikun’s heirs as your own!

188
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,880
If that's how you feel, then
plan your schemes
somewhere else!

189
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,760
You are no longer welcome here!

190
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,360
But if you are so determined,

191
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,360
and only if the children
agree to go with you,

192
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,520
then I will renounce all
parental rights

193
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,600
and I will pretend the last
three years never happened.

194
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,440
What you’re asking me to do is a
great sacrifice on my part.

195
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,440
But that is insignificant

196
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,600
compared to what Edouard and
Sayla will have to endure

197
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,840
if they decide to risk their
lives for such conflict.

198

only person I can rely on!

I gave into temptation!

202
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,480
I was blinded by the support of
a massive corporation
like Anaheim,

203
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,680
And I thought they’d
guarantee our success!

204
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,160
[TEABOLO:] The only thing
they can guarantee

205
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,320
is that they’d be making
money off of you.

206
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,840
They couldn't care less about
Zeon, the Zabis, or your people.

207
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:08,280
That's just how a
military‐industrial conglomerate
like Anaheim operates.

208

[MR. RAL:] That may be so.

209
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,320
But I couldn’t help it!

210
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,800
I wanted so desperately to
believe the things they said!

211
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,840
I can't stand the Zabis
calling themselves Zeon!

212
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,320
I was hoping this would be
my last chance!

213
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,120
To fulfill my dream!

214

Are you going to deny
me even that?!

[ARTESIA:] Mother, it’s a
full moon tonight.

219
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,440
It’s the 43rd full moon since
we arrived on Earth.

220
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,360
When I first learned that a full
moon only happens once a month,

221
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,690
I was mad at you.

It was cruel to make me
wait that long.

223
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,480
But soon it will be fifty times.

224
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,880
That's halfway.

225
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,840
By the hundredth time, I'll be
even bigger than I am now.

226

I bet you'll be surprised
when you see me.

227
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,800
Casval is already taller than
Mr. Jimba Ral now.

228
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,680
And Mr. Teabolo has gotten
bigger as well. He
reminds me of...

What’s the diagnosis, doctor?

230
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,920
It's most likely just
the common cold.

231
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,920
However, if she contracted this
from somebody at the camp,

232
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,200
there's a chance that it
could be Sahara Fever.

233
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,200
In any case, we should keep a
close eye on her.

234
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,440
If it helps, I can sit by her
side until morning.

235
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,160
Good idea. It sure
couldn’t hurt.

00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,120
She's skipped a few grades and
will be starting college.

312
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,720
And she says she wants to study
to become an astronaut.

313
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,880
Can you believe it?

314
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,560
Well, you’re daughter’s smart.
You must be so proud.

315
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,240
It’s a pretty name. Mirai is
Japanese, right?

316
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,720
If I remember correctly, it
means “the future.”

317
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,600
A fine name indeed.

318
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,560
I hope a good future is in
store for you both.

319
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,920
[COPS:] Back up! Stay back!
Move back further!

320
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,520
What is it, Mirai?

321
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,360
There, in the window!

322
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,280
I saw a girl and boy
standing there.

323
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,880
Do you think those
were the kids?

324
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,920
Yes, it probably was them.

325
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,640
Poor things...

326
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,520
Side 3: Munzo

327
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,040
[CROWD:] Zabi! Zabi! Zabi! Zabi!

328
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:41,120
Zabi! Zabi! Zabi! Zabi!

329
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:51,080
[KYCILIA:] Director Gihren, the
Chairman requests your presence.

330
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,800
He’s making an appearance.

331
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,680
Kycilia, did you have
Jimba Ral killed?

332
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,480
I did. Do you take
issue with that?

333
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,840
And yet, you failed to take
care of the other two.

334
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,720
That's what happens when you
rely on the locals.

335
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,760
Don't you agree?

336
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,560
The Special Service isn't like
the old private army.

337
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,040
You're in command of it now,

338
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,600
so I suggest you act like it
and lead your men.

339
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,800
Are you're saying that as the
National Campaign Director?

340
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,160
Fine! Understood!

341
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,600
Where is Dozle? I don’t see him.

342
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,800
He couldn’t come. Had some
important business.

343
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,320
Garma, you should ride
with me in my car.

344
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,280
Y‐Yes, sir!

345
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,120
[HAMON, SINGING:] There you are,
looking discouraged.

346
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,880
Come here, let the
wind guide you,

347
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:26,280
and I will take away the
pain inside you.

348
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:32,960
Lean on me, until the dawn.

349
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,440
Even in darkness,

350
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,440
you are the only one
gleams in my heart.

351
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:51,520
Don’t give up hope, there’s
a better tomorrow

352
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:59,960
I’d go through whatever it
takes to protect you.

353
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:06,840
Tonight, I’ll be your light.

354
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:15,280
So bright, you won’t
lose the way.

355
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:21,960
I’ll be by your side,
day and night.

356
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,800
Like I’ve always been.

357
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:35,960
Here we are, holding each other—

358
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,080
[CRASH]

359
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,040
No‐one likes a sappy love song!
I’ve had enough!

360
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,040
I’d rather karaoke!

361
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,680
All right! Give me the mic!

362
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,360
C’mon, I’ll show you
how it’s done!

363
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,760
Bandage.

364
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,320
You do what you need to do, and
don’t worry about the mess.

365
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,480
Thanks, Clamp.

366
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,480
In that case, I won’t hold back.

367
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,280
Get in there!

368
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,480
What are you doing?

369
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,920
Don't lose to some
stinking colonist!

370
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,120
D‐Don't let him beat you!

371
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,400
Fight back already!

372
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,760
You there!

373
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,320
Where are you going?

374
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,320
It’s too early to
call it a night.

375
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,400
Here, take the mic.

376
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,800
You wanted to sing, so sing!

377
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,480
No...thanks!

378
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,720
I said sing!

379
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,560
Well, what’s wrong with you?!

380
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,240
I told you to sing!

381
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,960
[DOZLE:] I think they've
learned their lesson.

382
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,080
The head of the Ral family,

383
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,200
fistfighting against a bunch of
Federation pipsqueaks?

384
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,960
The Ral family?

385
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,080
They’re hardly relevant anymore.

386
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,720
Not since you dragged their
bloody bodies through the mud!

387
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,600
Yes, you have a point.

388
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,000
That was indeed regrettable.

389
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
What?!

390
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,600
I'm here to ask a favor of you.

391
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,240
Would you be willing to help me?

392
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,800
To keep me from losing face?

393
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,200
A favor from me?

394
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,800
Where exactly are you taking us?

395
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,440
[DOZLE:] The docking bay.

396
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,480
Are we accompanying you on a
lunar field trip, is that it?

397
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,760
[DOZLE:] No, we’re not
going that far.

398
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,960
It's right next door.

399
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,520
Side 3 Extra Banchi Dark Colony

400
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,760
Commence with the testing
straight away!

401
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,400
Yes, sir!

402
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,280
We've been waiting for you, sir!

403
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,240
[DOZLE:] Good!

404
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,720
[GAIA:] Captain!

405
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,320
I thought that was you,
Captain Ral!

406
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,320
It's been a long time, sir!

407
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,880
Sergeant Gaia!

408
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,520
Hang on, you made
commissioned officer?

409
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,240
Yup!

410
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,240
That sure was a quick promotion.

411
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,600
Did you do something to
distinguish yourself?

412
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,120
About to soon, Captain.

413
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,440
Something big! Very big!

414
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,520
[SCIENTIST:] Testing will
commence in 60 seconds!

415
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,120
All personnel to your stations!

416
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,240
Standing by!

417
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,440
Warrant Officer Ortega, are
you ready to proceed?

418
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,440
Ortega? He's a warrant officer?!

419
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,120
And Mash is here, too.

420
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,120
We're all on the
same assignment.

421
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,760
What the hell’s going on?

422
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,880
What could you need
those hoodlums for?

423
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,960
Corporal Ortega standing by!

424
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,560
No, I mean Warrant Officer!

425
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,760
I’m ready whenever you guys are!
Let's do this!

426
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,640
[SCIENTIST:] Colonel
Dozle is observing!

427
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,680
Stay focused!

428
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,920
What in the world is that thing?

429
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,720
That’s called
“Mobile Worker 01.”

430
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,000
[DOZLE:] And it is going to
crush the Federation.

431
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,000
Mobile Worker?

432
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,520
[SCIENTIST:] All sensors
functioning normally!

433
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,800
Starting at a range of 600.

434
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,360
Target standing by.

435
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,920
How'd you get that Guntank?

436
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,920
It's a Federation MBT we
acquired through back channels.

437
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,040
Begin testing now!

438
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,760
[SCIENTIST:] Speed at 30!

439
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,120
Standard walking pace!

440
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,040
Walking pace accelerating!

441
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,760
Range, 450!

442
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,480
Target is opening fire!

443
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,840
Both units are advancing!

444
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,680
All systems green!

445
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,120
Grouping nominal!

446
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,040
Damage within expected range!

447
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,840
Ortega! Make sure you don’t
let that shield down!

448
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,480
This is too easy!

449
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,160
Show me what you've really got!

450
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,160
Main guns: fire!

451
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,280
Damage minimal!

452
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,000
He’s continuing to advance!

453
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,920
Nice move! Good, Ortega!

454
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,680
Yes! You did it!

455
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,680
Test successful!

456
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,840
That was amazing!

457
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,360
[GATE AGENT:] Flight 005
to Side 5, Loum,

458
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,360
will begin boarding momentarily.

459
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,640
[BOY:] No, wait, come back!

460
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,480
No, stop! Don't go that way!

461
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,760
Hey. Let me go, let me go.

462
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,440
What are you doing?

463
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,040
Who are you?

464
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,560
I am Haro.

465
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,880
Who are you?

466
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,920
Wait for me, Dad!

467
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,320
Quit dawdling!

468
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,920
Didn't I tell you not to
open that thing until later?

469
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,640
Let’s go.

470
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,920
Sayla, what’s wrong?

471
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,160
Nothing, there was a boy
chasing after his big toy.

472
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,320
It almost got away.

473
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,480
It did, eh?

474
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,280
I guess he wanted that
toy pretty badly!

475
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,960
The package is headed to Loum.

476
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,120
Prepare for pickup.

477
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:28,000
Lucifer, we're going
into space again.

478
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,240
If only we could go back
and see Mother.

479
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,040
It would make me so happy.

480
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:49,960
[ASTRAIA:] I see...Madam
Roselucia has passed away, then?

481
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,080
[HAMON:] Wait, did you
not know that?

482
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,800
Course not. I'm never told
anything around here..

483
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,240
They won’t even tell me how my
children are doing.

484
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,920
They have some nerve!

485
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,720
Before Artesia left, she
promised she would write
to me every day,

486
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,320
but I haven’t received any...

487
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,040
Don’t worry, they’re doing fine!

488
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,680
They’re living on Earth, and
they were adopted by a man

489
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,920
named Teabolo Mass, and...

490
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,560
That’s quite all right, Crowley.

491
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,320
I’ve heard everything I
need to know.

492
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,760
Tell me, how is the club?

493
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,760
Is Eden doing well?

494
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,000
You know, same as always.

495
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,800
All sorts of people drop by,

496
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,880
and brawls break out every
once in a while.

497
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,560
I see. That takes me back...

498
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,760
It’s been so long since I’ve
been there. Feels like decades.

499
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,000
We were all still so
young back then,

500
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,920
without a care in the world
about what tomorrow might bring.

501
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,760
And one day, a
tired‐looking man walked in.

502
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,480
I just wanted to show him
some kindness.

503
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,360
Kindness to a man who was
clearly hurting.

504
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,200
But I didn’t know what
that would lead to.

505
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,960
And yet, I don't regret a
single moment.

506
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,840
Crowley, if I could have
anything I wanted,

507
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,360
do you know what I
would wish for?

508
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:20,480
I would wish to be with my
children, just for
one more night.

509
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,360
[MAID:] I’m afraid
your time is up.

510
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,080
You must leave. She
needs her medicine.

511
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,680
Astraia has only just
fallen asleep.

512
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,800
You should leave and give
her some peace.

513
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,520
Surely you can grant her
something like that.

514
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,160
It’s the least you
people can do.

515
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,760
Is that all you got?

516
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,760
Why you...!

517
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,800
...the hell?

518
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,040
Impact coefficient, 1.2 mega!

519
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,000
[SCIENTIST:] Instantaneous
acceleration, 800,000 gal!

520
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,280
Test Unit 02, abnormality in
first joint of the left arm!

521
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,560
Damn you!

522
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,280
[SCIENTIST:] Damage to Test
Unit 02's head!

523
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,360
Measurement disabled!

524
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,640
Gotta hand it to the Captain!
He actually won!

525
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,120
Get those two out of there!

526
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,040
Don't stop us!

527
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,720
I don't need a head to
keep fighting!

528
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,240
Colonel! This entire
setup is insane!

529
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,240
Did you see how Mash
tried to kill me!?

530
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,520
Look who's talking!

531
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,160
Climb on out, you two!

532
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,640
If you want to keep fighting, do
it on your own time!

533
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,800
Alright, fine. But for
what it’s worth,

534
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,080
I think this damn cockpit is a
deathtrap waiting to happen!

535
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,640
And the manipulators on this
thing need to be
completely modified!

536
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,760
Can’t stand the
restricted arm movement!

537
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,800
That's all valuable input.

538
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,960
I'll be certain to incorporate
it into the next prototypes.

539
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,440
Captain Ral!

540
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,240
What happened to you, sir?!
Another brawl?

541
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,640
[JIMBA:] None of your business.

542
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,320
Working your side job
again tonight?

543
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,640
[TACHI:] No, this is a
volunteer gig!

544
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,960
Be careful, sir! Lean on me!

545
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,880
Don’t touch me!

546
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,360
Hey.

547
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,320
Is the back room occupied?

548
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,840
[HAMON:] But why do you have to
be the one to do this?

549
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,440
Look how I’ve fallen.

550
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,480
I’m nothing more than the Zabis'
hired dog now.

551
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,320
But you're doing this for Col.
Dozle, right?

552
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:29,000
He’s different from his
siblings. He’s no
Gihren or Kycilia.

553
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,440
Today, I was able to
visit Lady Astraia.

554
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,720
I assume the Colonel must have
pulled some strings.

555
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,720
Probably as a thank you
for your help.

556
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,800
And how is she holding up?

557
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,640
Well, she asked me about how
the bar was doing.

558
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,720
After that, we talked a little
about the good old days.

559
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,760
It's just so unfair,
it’s so sad.

560
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,200
She's going to die soon.

561
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,160
However, Casval and Artesia...

562
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,720
they were supposed to go to
Loum, weren't they?

563
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,280
Yes, that’s right.

564
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,240
Loum, eh?

565
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,000
Side 5: Loum

566
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,800
[ROGER:] We've been
expecting you.

567
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,720
I'm Texas Village's chief
manager, Roger Aznable.

568
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,000
This is my lovely wife,
Michelle.

569
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,640
This place was originally
built as a hotel.

570
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,920
And while it’s supposed to
have a Texas theme,

571
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,360
it feels a bit more like
Wyoming to me.

572
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,200
What do you think?

573
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,360
I hope you find it to
your liking.

574
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,640
It’s charming.

575
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,840
All right, Lucifer!

576
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,800
Time to explore our new house!

577
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,760
[ARTESIA:] Edouard! Wait for me!

578
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,640
You're so mean!

579
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,880
Don't leave me behind!

580
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,240
The house looks so
small from here!

581
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,160
I didn’t realize we’d
ridden out this far!

582
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,280
[ARTESIA:] Not again!

583
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,000
C'mon! We have to chase
after my brother!

584
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,400
C’mon horsey, we have to go!

585
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,040
Hurry!

586
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,440
Oh wow, when did he get so
good at riding horses?

587
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,520
Wait a sec...

588
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,200
That's not him!

589
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,920
Then who is he?

590
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,200
[CHAR:] You’d make a
dashing little cowgirl.

591
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,450
Your name wouldn't happen to be
Sayla Mass, would it?

592
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:08,680
Nice to meet you, my
name’s Char Aznable.

593
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,850
I'd heard that your family was
coming to stay here.

594
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,360
Char Aznable?

595
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,160
Yeah, you met my dad.

596
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,280
He didn't mention me?

597
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,800
That’s funny, considering I’m
the exact same age as
your brother.

598
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,520
[ARTESIA:] He looks
just like Edouard!

599
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,960
The only difference is
their eye color...

600
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,040
Edouard's are blue, but
this boy's are...

601
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,160
Oh, and the way you’re holding
the reigns right now is wrong.

602
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,480
You gotta loosen up and
relax your shoulders.

603
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,120
Try it!

604
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,280
Yeah, there you go!

605
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,680
[CHAR:] Don't try to make him
run fast, and lift your
butt off the saddle.

606
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,960
Good, good, just like that!

607
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,600
That's called a trot!

608
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,720
Now, if you tap his sides with
your feet, he'll go even faster!

609
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,400
Nice, that's called a canter!

610
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,040
You’re a total natural!

611
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,480
Didn’t I tell you that you’d
make a good cowgirl?

612
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,120
See that over there?

613
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,600
That's Center Village.

614
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,200
That’s where the school
and church are.

615
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,200
And my parents house, too.

616
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,760
So is that where you live?

617
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:14,120
Not me, because I’m going to the
central colony’s high
school right now.

618
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,960
It's my brother!

619
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,880
Hi, I’m Edouard Mass.

620
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,040
And I'm Char Aznable!

621
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,440
[ARTESIA:] Dear Mother, I have
so much to write about today!

622
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:05,280
There are a lot of new things
happening in my life.

623
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,960
[CAT NOISE]

624
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,520
Lucifer made a funny
noise just now.

625
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,040
He's gotten older, too.

626
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,240
Texas Colony is nothing like
what it was on Munzo.

627
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,680
There’s so much starlight and
moonlight that it's
bright even at night.

628
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,080
I can see the lake clearly
from my window.

629
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:29,320
I can even see the village off
in the distance, too.

630
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:32,120
Mr. Aznable's and his
wife live there.

631
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:36,400
I got to meet Mr. Aznable's son.
His name is Char.

632
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,920
Mr. Char is the same
age as Casval,

633
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,840
and they look amazingly alike.

634
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,760
They look so similar that I
wasn't sure what would happen

635
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,320
when the two of them first met.

636
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,960
But in the end, it was fine.

637
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,760
I think they’re gonna be
really good friends.

638
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,640
Mr. Char has been teaching me
how to ride a horse.

639
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,640
I've already mastered cantering.

640
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,160
Next time, I'll try a gallop!

641
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,200
Edouard?

642
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,000
What's the matter, are you okay?

643
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,430
Artesia...

644
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,440
it’s Mother... she’s...

645
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,160
She's dead.

646
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,080
[HAMON, V/O:] I’m sorry to write
you such sad news.

647
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:35,720
However, I feel you must
face the truth.

648
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:39,600
Brace yourself for what you
are about to read.

649
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:44,440
Last night, your mother
Astraia passed away.

650
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:48,640
No!

651
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:09,200
Loving mother of
Edouard and Sayla.

652
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,560
[THEO:] She spends all her
free time down there.

653
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,320
It simply breaks my heart.

654
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,040
I really would have liked to
place a proper inscription

655
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,960
with the name Astraia on it,

656
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,440
but there's just no telling who
might come across it.

657
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,080
Yes, we understand.

658
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,320
Don’t worry, your secret
is safe with us.

659
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,960
Not even our son, Char,
knows the truth.

660
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,080
All I can do is pray that
God protects them.

661
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:50,720
Them, and all the other
kindhearted people
like yourselves.

662
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,480
[TEABOLO:] My meeting with the
headmaster shouldn't take long.

663
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,040
Why don’t you two wait at Mr.
Aznable's cafe

664
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,720
and I’ll meet you there after?

665
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,800
I must say, both your children
are excellent students.

666
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,000
Your son Edouard in particular.

667
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,720
It’s up to you, but
if you wanted,

668
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,960
he could advance to high
school right away.

669
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,160
You’re not being
straight with me.

670
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,920
Has Edouard done
something wrong?

671
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,440
Well...

672
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,800
I’m just not sure if we’re
suited to provide for
young Edouard.

673
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,800
Has he been misbehaving?

674
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,400
No, not at all!

675
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,400
Quite the opposite, actually.

676
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,240
Several of our more
problematic students

677
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:55,120
have suddenly started performing
better, and it’s thanks to him.

678
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,400
It's just...

679
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,160
Just what?

680
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,880
I'm afraid of him.

681
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,840
The boy terrifies me! Truly!

682
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,600
We have seen many young students

683
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,280
pass through our doors over
the years, but, well,

684
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,680
I’ve never come across
one like Edouard.

685
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,560
He has a keen mind.

686
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,200
Acute sensitivity.

687
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,080
He's a special boy with many
unique qualities.

688
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:21,160
However...there’s a
coldness to him.

689
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:25,200
He's hard like a steel knife,
just waiting to cut you!

690
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,920
It’s my concern that one day
he will be the cause

691
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,520
of some sort of catastrophe.

692
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:36,560
Enough! Say no more!

693
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,360
Oh, you're done with the
meeting already?

694
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:43,040
I want that headmaster fired!

695
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,960
I’ll take a beer and a hot dog.

696
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,760
I can’t believe his nerve.

697
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,640
He had no right to say
the things he did!

698
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:16,040
Mr. Aznable, I have a
proposal for you.

699
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:20,240
Your son and mine seem to have
really hit it off.

700
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,320
How would you feel if
the two of them

701
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,200
were to attend the same school?

702
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:32,080
Well, I don’t think it’s a bad
idea, but the truth is,

703
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,560
Char dropped out of school.

704
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,400
He took the Munzo
military academy exam.

705
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,080
The Zeon military academy?!

706
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,360
Edouard? Where are you going?

707
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,000
Quit your staring.
What do you want?

708
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,200
How long do you plan on
following us?

709
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,520
Look here, kid.

710
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,960
I don't know what kind of
joke you're playing—

711
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,200
Stop it, Edouard!

712
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,040
Father, help! Make Edouard stop!

713
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,720
You think you’re a tough guy,
huh?

714
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,600
Well, I’m gonna teach you a
lesson, you punk!

715
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,200
Edouard! Stop it now!

716
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,680
[HEADMASTER, V/O:] The boy
terrifies me, truly!

717
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:52,880
What's going on?

718
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,880
Is it part of a show?

719
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,520
No, it's for real!

720
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,280
That’s the boy who started it!

721
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,560
You think I won't lay a hand on
you, cause you’re a kid?

722
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:08,200
Think again!

723
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,600
I’m gonna beat some sense
into you, brat!

724
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:27,920
[ARTESIA:] Stop it!

725
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,360
Please, stop it, Edouard!

726
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,600
If you don’t, you’ll
kill that man!

727
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,600
What did he do, anyway?

728
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:38,480
I just don’t understand why
you would do this!

729
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:42,040
Besides, what good do you
think it will do?!

730
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,840
And what do you think Mother
would think if she saw
you like this?

731
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:48,400
I hate it! I hate it whenever
you get like this!

732
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,770
I'm sorry, Artesia...

733
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:53,200
I won't let it happen again.

734
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,680
[ARTESIA:] What's the matter,
Lucifer?

735
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,680
You haven't been
yourself lately.

736
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:21,400
We'll go into town and take you
to the vet tomorrow, okay?

737
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,600
Don't worry, the shots
don't hurt much.

738
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,600
[CHAR:] I did it! I passed!

739
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,440
I got into the military academy!

740
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:29,920
Isn't that amazing?!

741
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,920
I wasn’t sure I would
pass the exam!

742
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,760
The competition to get
in is intense!

743
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,600
Zeon is where all the
action is right now!

744
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,480
The world’s changing!

745
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,680
The times have finally caught up
with Zeon Zum Deikun's ideas!

746
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,840
Hey, I know you must
agree with me!

747
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,680
Oh. Yeah...

748
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:52,600
It is simply unfair the way
colony communities are
being exploited!

749
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:55,040
[CHAR:] It's just like
Gihren Zabi says!

750
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,560
Spacenoids are being robbed
of their wealth,

751
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,360
and Earthnoids are then
turning around

752
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,920
and using that hard‐earned
wealth to drive the
Earth into ruin!

753
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,800
[ROGER:] Char, why don’t we
change the subject?

754
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,520
This was supposed to be a
celebratory dinner.

755
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,400
Oh, I’m sorry.

756
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:12,160
I suppose I might’ve gotten a
little too carried away.

757
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:16,400
You know, even if what you say
is true, I doubt we’ll
really go to war.

758
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,480
That certainly may be
true for now.

759
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,480
But ten years, who can say?

760
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,000
In fact, it may be as
short as five years.

761
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,720
You never really know.

762
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:28,440
Char! Is that why you wanted to
join the military academy?

763
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:31,120
Because if that’s the reason,
I won't allow it!

764
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,440
I’m against war!

765
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:34,360
Now, now, Dad...

766
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,080
All we get is bad
news these days.

767
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:42,880
I wonder if Char has
always felt that way.

768
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:47,080
Lucifer, I'm sorry I left
you all alone.

769
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:48,840
Did you finish your dinner?

770
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,680
Hey there, Lucifer?

771
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,560
Lucifer, goodbye.

772
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,480
I know you left because
you were afraid

773
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,480
Mother was lonely
all by herself.

774
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:14,640
Please keep her company

775
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:18,400
and cheer her up for all of us
back here, okay? Please?

776
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,120
[CASVAL:] Artesia.

777
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,480
I’m leaving, so I won’t see
you for a while.

778
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:39,200
I’ve already discussed it
with Mr. Teabolo

779
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,480
and decided to go to Loum's
central school.

780
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:44,560
But why? Isn’t that the same
school that Char went to?

781
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:46,320
He’s not going there anymore,
though!

782
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,080
He wants to be a Zeon soldier!

783
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,760
That doesn't matter to me.

784
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,360
I'm my own person.

785
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,880
Goodbye, Artesia.

786
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:58,360
Don’t go! Why does everybody
have to leave me?

787
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,880
[ARTESIA:] Why is
everyone going away?!

788
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,440
Our mother is dead, and now even
Lucifer has left me!

789
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:07,000
Are you really going
to leave too?

790
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,960
I beg you, please! You can’t
leave me, brother!

791
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,120
Casval!

792
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,360
Don’t go!
