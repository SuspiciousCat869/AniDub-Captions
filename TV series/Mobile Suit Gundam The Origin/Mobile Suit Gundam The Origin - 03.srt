1
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,940
[NARRATOR:] It was a time
when humanity set out

2
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,050
into space in search
of new worlds.

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,740
This era was given the name:

4
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,480
Universal Century.

5
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,600
Clusters of massive
space colonies

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,400
were constructed
around the Earth,

7
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,110
where the future of
humanity now resided.

8
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,650
However, these second homes

9
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,250
were not the paradises

10
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,710
the people were promised.

11
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,480
Universal Century 0057

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,200
In Side 3, the cluster
furthest from Earth,

13
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:44,570
a leader appeared

14
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,570
who called for
Spacenoid independence

15
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:49,340
and the reformation of
the human race.

16
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,400
His name was Zeon Zum Deikun.

17
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,200
Universal Century 0068.

18
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,850
Just as Deikun began his speech,

19
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:02,450
he suddenly collapsed.

20
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,910
His death lead to
speculation of foul play.

21
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,570
Even within his own camp,

22
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,020
simmering tensions erupted

23
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,540
into factional infighting.

24
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,050
Degwin Zabi, a
longtime supporter

25
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,050
and right‐hand man of Deikun,

26
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,680
did not let this
opportunity pass him by.

27
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,800
The Zabis toppled their
rival faction,

28
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,940
the Ral family,

29
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,850
and seized power in Munzo.

30
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,770
Deikun's wife, Astraia,

31
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,370
was placed under house arrest,

32
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:41,510
alone in a tower.

33
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:44,510
As for his children,
Casval and Artesia...

34
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,770
My enemy, your enemy,
even Mother's,

35
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:49,970
everyone's enemy!

36
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,370
And I’m gonna take them out!

37
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,020
[NARRATOR:] The children
narrowly escaped to Earth

38
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,650
accompanied by Jimba Ral,

39
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,280
the head of the Ral family.

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,620
Three years later...

41
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,280
Artesia changed her
name to Sayla,

42
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,570
and Casval became Édouard.

43
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,570
The two of them were adopted

44
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,770
by the wealthy Teabolo Mass.

45
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,540
However, they were targeted

46
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,620
by Zabi assassins.

47
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,250
And Jimba Ral was killed.

48
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:39,370
Teabolo was gravely injured.

49
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,600
Heeding the advice of
Shu Yashima,

50
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,420
head of the Yashima Company,

51
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,340
Teabolo decided to move
to Texas Colony,

52
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,850
located in Side 5, also
known as Loum.

53
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,540
He had no idea a
fateful encounter

54
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,820
awaited them there.

55
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,600
Hi, I’m Edouard Mass.

56
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,940
And I'm Char Aznable!

57
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,420
Meanwhile, as Sayla was waiting

58
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,880
to be reunited with her mother,

59
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,080
she received some terrible news.

60
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,050
She’s dead...

61
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,770
[NARRATOR:] Her mother
Astraia had died.

62
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,620
No!

63
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,910
Édouard then bade
farewell to Sayla.

64
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,140
[CASVAL:] Artesia.

65
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,140
I’m leaving, so I won’t see
you for a while.

66
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,710
Goodbye, Artesia.

67
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,540
I beg you, please!

68
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,420
You can’t leave me, brother!

69
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,140
Casval!

70
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,170
Don’t go!

71
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,620
[NARRATOR:] Casval set
out on a new path.

72
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,280
And this...

73
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,170
was his first step
towards vengeance.

74
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,680
Universal Century 0074.

75
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,200
Édouard, secretly switched
places with Char.

76
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:10,650
He then entered

77
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,310
the Autonomous
Republic of Zeon's

78
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,970
military academy in his place..

79
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,970
Also at the academy
was Garma Zabi,

80
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,480
the Zabi heir.

81
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,420
I pledge...

82
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,820
Dorm 1, Garma Zabi!

83
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:37,680
Cozy, huh?

84
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,220
Think of it as your palace.

85
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,800
[NARRATOR:] It was at that time
when Char and Garma

86
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,570
forged a fateful bond.

87
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,910
Meanwhile, with the assistance

88
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:52,370
of the scientific genius Dr.
Minovsky,

89
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:55,310
Dozle Zabi advanced the
development of the mobile suit:

90
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,620
a new weapon he had
been working on.

91
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,740
But an unexpected accident

92
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,280
changed the political landscape.

93
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,370
The citizens rose up,
demanding independence.

94
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,200
[GARMA:] Attack the
Federation’s barracks?

95
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,340
[NARRATOR:] They could no
longer tolerate

96
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,510
oppression by the
Federation Forces.

97
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,800
And Char manipulated Garma

98
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,710
into inciting the academy's
cadets to take up arms.

99
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,340
It was to protect the lives,

100
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,970
the rights, and property
of Spacenoids!

101
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,140
All right! Then let’s move out!

102
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,710
However, there was
one cadet there

103
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,170
that managed to see through
Char's disguise.

104
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,340
His name was Lino Fernandez,

105
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,140
a fellow native of Loum.

106
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,800
Thank you very much, Lino.

107
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,680
[NARRATOR:] But
during the battle,

108
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,340
Char found a way to
silence Lino,

109
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,110
who had already pledged
loyalty to him.

110
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,600
[LINO:] Casval, call them off!

111
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,450
Fire!

112
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,620
[LINO:] Stop it! Don’t
do this Casval!

113
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:45,310
[NARRATOR:] Universal
Century 0077.

114
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,880
Under the command of Garma Zabi,

115
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,600
the uprising of some 200 cadets

116
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,740
forced the E. F. F.
security forces

117
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,910
to lay down arms.

118
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:01,940
This incident,

119
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:04,800
which later would be known as
the Dawn Rebellion,

120
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,310
was the event that
marked the beginning

121
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,740
of the One Year War,

122
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,800
the greatest tragedy in
human history.

123
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,400
As the military drama unfolded,
at Side 7,

124
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,000
which housed a secret
Federation facility...

125
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,570
Amuro Ray, I’m 13 years old!

126
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,370
[NARRATOR:] Tem Ray was also

127
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,740
conducting mobile suit

128
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,420
development research of his own.

129
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,570
This is it...this is Side 7...

130
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:50,940
MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM THE ORIGIN IV

131
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,710
[NEWSCASTER:] We’re at the
tickertape parade

132
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,570
for the Guardian Banchi heroes!

133
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:01,170
We honor these mere 200
academy cadets

134
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,370
who bravely took on the
Federation Forces,

135
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,940
and foiled the security
operation scheme!

136
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,020
And here comes the leader of
this Dawn Rebellion,

137
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,570
none other than our very
own Garma Zabi!

138
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:15,080
[CROWD CHEERS]

139
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,250
Oh, it looks like Cadet Garma

140
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,540
is waving to the crowd!

141
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,200
Following in the
cars behind him,

142
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,000
we have the photos of
those cadets

143
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,200
who fell in the battle.

144
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,250
They are proud
portraits of youths

145
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,110
who gave their lives for
their homeland!

146
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,080
What's the meaning of this?!

147
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,970
I demand an explanation!

148
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,600
These boys are criminals!

149
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,370
The Federation demands every one
of them be punished

150
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,540
and that the ringleader be
handed over immediately!

151
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,170
This so‐called ringleader is
my younger brother.

152
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,450
You expect me to hand him over?

153
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:48,140
I don't care one iota
about who he is!

154
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,050
Thank you, I’ve already
been briefed.

155
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,220
Vice Admiral Revil.

156
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,510
Firstly, allow me to
express my condolences

157
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:05,020
for the losses suffered by
you and your men.

158
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,650
Disciplinary actions will
be administered.

159
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,020
However, perhaps there
is someone else

160
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,000
we might discover

161
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,370
who is more appropriate
than young Garma

162
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:16,020
that can satisfy your
sense of justice.

163
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,140
The Republic of
Zeon's sole concern

164
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,280
is to avoid incidents of this
nature in the future.

165
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,700
I’d like to use this as
an opportunity.

166
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,260
Our chance to forge

167
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,430
a new relationship with
the Federation.

168
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,100
However...

169
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,160
We do have a few conditions.

170
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,900
That the Federation relinquish
their assets here

171
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,430
and withdraw their forces.

172
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,360
What kind of idiot are you?

173
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,700
Why do you think I appointed you

174
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,960
as the superintendent

175
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,500
of the military academy?!

176
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,960
You had one purpose! One!

177
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,600
That was to protect Garma!

Sorry about this.

Garma, why don’t you

184
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,460
come see me in my chambers.

185

Father seems to be in a
really bad mood.

187

188

Don’t worry about it, it’s fine.

You’ve done well.

Your actions prove you’re
a real Zabi man.

The important thing is you
weren't hurt, Garma.

194

You’re important to the nation.

195
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,660
You must take care of yourself.

Gihren, Dozle, and Kycilia

197

Alas, of all of them,

00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,360
only you have a
gentle disposition.

200
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,900
I should have encouraged you

201
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,400
to take the path of a scholar.

202
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,060
Instead, I enrolled you at the
military academy.

203
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,060
Come here Garma.

Approach me.

I would like you to
come over here

206

by my side and take my hand.

207

208
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,430
Does my hand feel cold to you?

209

Not at all. It feels warm to me.

210
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,660
Very warm.

211

Is that so?

212
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,130
Your cheek is also equally warm.

213
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:42,630
Stay like this for a while,

When one has reached

Dr. Minovsky succeeded...

490
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,930
He’s finally actually
made it happen!

491
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:47,860
Admiral Gopp!

492
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,430
Did you not just inform us

493
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:50,630
that you received this footage

494
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,500
through your back
channel connections

495
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,130
with Dr. Minovsky?

496
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:59,130
Let's continue this outside,
shall we?

497
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,700
Defecting?!

498
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,560
Dr. Minovsky is?

499
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,930
The reason for that is,

500
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,900
the good Doctor’s been poached.

501
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,860
Anaheim Electronics have
stolen him from Zeonic.

502
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:13,260
I need you to do
something for me.

503
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,700
Go to the Moon.

504
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:17,300
T‐To the Moon? Me?

505
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,430
The Doctor will be
heading from Granada,

506
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,560
where the Zeonic
factory is located.

507
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,330
From there, he will travel

508
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:24,600
all the way to Von Braun.

509
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,130
And I was hoping you could
assist with things.

510
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:31,560
I had heard Dr. Minovsky would
be a valuable asset,

511
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,130
but I wasn’t quite certain
just how valuable.

512
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:37,430
That’s why I wanted your honest
opinion about the footage.

513
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:39,960
I regret having to send you on
another long trip

514
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,160
after you just arrived from
a distant colony.

515
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:46,360
Don't you find it fascinating,
though, Chief Ray?

516
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:50,100
From here in Brasilia, you
can’t see Jaburo,

517
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,500
since it’s too far
up the Amazon.

518
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,500
But the Moon is plainly visible

519
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,460
even though it's much
farther away.

520
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,330
The more distance we cover,

521
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:00,030
the more we realize that space

522
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,900
is smaller than we
knew it to be.

523
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,530
[GOPP:] If Dr. Minovsky ends up
taking a leadership position,

524
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:10,660
you might find that your
project at Side 7

525
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:14,230
is positioned to make even
greater advancements.

526
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,060
There you go!

527
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,360
[FRAW:] You better eat, okay?

528
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:26,230
Bye, then!

529
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,560
See you tomorrow!

530
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,330
Make sure you get up early!

531
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:31,000
Don't be late for school!

532
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,200
Bye‐bye, Haro.

533
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,960
Bye‐bye, Fraw.

534
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,560
You must be Amuro's father,
right?

535
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,200
It's nice to meet you.

536
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,560
And you are?

537
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:46,000
I’m a classmate of Amuro’s.

538
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,600
My name is Fraw Bow.

539
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,360
And I live in the neighborhood.

540
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,300
Oh, is that right.

541
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,660
I’ve heard that your work

542
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,660
usually keeps you
extremely busy.

543
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:57,960
However, I think it’s
starting to affect Amuro.

544
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:00,900
It’s just that he’s
always alone.

545
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,360
And so...I feel real
bad for him.

546
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,400
Maybe you could try talking to
him a little bit more?

547
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,030
Sorry. I’m being nosy.

548
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:13,030
I gotta go, see you around!

549
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:17,530
Amuro! I'm back from work!

550
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,460
It's always such a
pigsty in here!

551
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,600
Oh hey, welcome back Dad.

552
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,060
Would it kill you to
clean up a bit?

553
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,530
This place is filthy!

554
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:27,960
Anyway, I have to pack.

555
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,360
[MR. RAY:] I’m going to the Moon
on another business trip.

556
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:34,160
I’m doing very important work.

557
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,360
[HARO:] You hurt Haro. Ow.

558
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,400
Go make me some coffee, okay?

559
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,130
[AMURO:] Okay.

560
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:45,300
I'm going to be even
busier from now on.

561
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,530
Which means you have to—

562
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:47,800
[MR. RAY:] Amuro!

563
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,930
Will you put some pants on?!

564
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:52,300
Don't be such a slob!

565
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,300
[AMURO:] Y‐Yes, Dad!

566
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,500
[MR. RAY:] I can’t believe
you had a girl over

567
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,200
when you were dressed like that!

568
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,700
Seriously.

569
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,700
No matter what, that boy just
refuses to grow up.

570
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,930
LUNAR CITY GRANADA

571
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,500
[FLIGHT ATTENDANT:] Ladies and
gentlemen, welcome to Granada.

572
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:24,260
[OTHER MAN:] It looks like we’ve
finally arrived, Doctor.

573
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,900
[FLIGHT ATTENDANT:] Please
remain seated until we
have fully berthed.

574
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,460
It shouldn’t be much longer now.

575
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:44,800
[BERGMANN:] We are here,
your Excellency.

576
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,430
Why don’t we get off, Catherine?

577
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:55,100
Yes, let’s. Thank you,
Major Bergmann.

578
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:01,100
[BERGMANN:] I'm been told that
Dr. Minovsky is planning

579
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,760
to head straight to Zeonic
from the spaceport.

580
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,100
Will we be proceeding
with the plan,

581
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:06,800
Your Excellency?

582
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,800
“Catherine, shall we go
ahead with our plans?”

583
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,030
Of course. Shall we go ahead
with our plans, Catherine?

584
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,160
Yeah, sounds good.

585
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,600
[PILOT #1:] Damn, it’s dark.

586
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,200
[RAMBA:] Yup. The far side of
the Moon is pitch black.

587
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,460
At night, anyway.

588
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,630
[PILOT #1:] This is
taking forever!

589
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:31,200
[RAMBA:] No jumping.

590
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:32,900
You'll just kick up dust.

591
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,500
There’s no rush.

592
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:36,830
Be patient. Walk slowly.

593
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,800
We just need to reach the edge
of Mare Smythii within 12 hours.

594
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,230
[PILOT #1:] I assume
there’ll be some place

595
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,500
to take a break between then
and now, Captain?

596
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:48,730
[RAMBA:] You won’t find a
five‐star hotel,

597
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,930
but our red friend
went up ahead.

598
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,130
He’ll be waiting for us
with some coffee.

599
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,030
That guy!?

600
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,730
[PILOT #2:] I really can't
stand that jerk!

601
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,330
They say he hardly has
any training!

602
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,360
And they just went and made
him an MS pilot!

603
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,930
I hear he got kicked out of
the military academy

604
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:07,430
and even has a criminal record!

605
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:11,060
I can just imagine him sucking
up to Col. Dozle, can’t you?

606
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,530
Bet he’s a smooth talker.

607
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:16,830
[RAMBA:] I wouldn't know about
that, but he's
definitely got talent.

608
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:17,760
Good lord!

609
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:20,960
You aren’t turning into a
softie, are you Captain?

610
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,900
Gaia, make those two shut up,
will ya?

611
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:27,100
[GAIA:] Afraid you'll just have
to grin and bear it.

612
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,060
Once those guys are worked up,

613
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,460
there’s nothing I can do.

614
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,130
Cut ‘em some slack, though.

615
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,900
They’re just pumped
about getting to be

616
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,660
in the first mobile
suit battle ever!

617
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:55,900
[AGENT:] Dr. Minovsky has
already left for the
industrial zone.

618
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,930
He’s slightly ahead of the
projected schedule.

619
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,100
It looks like our leak
did the trick.

620
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,200
Your excellency!

621
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,460
The Doctor, he’s already

622
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,460
Sorry, forgive me! I meant...

623
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:10,960
Catherine...

624
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:20,600
Now, if you'd be so kind as to
escort me, Major?

625
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,760
I'd be honored to,
Missus Catherine.

626
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:27,930
But...may I have permission to
ask you a question first?

627
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,830
What would you like to know?

628
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,400
This thing?

629
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,530
Could I...

630
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:35,130
I mean, would you mind if
I wiped it off?

631
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,560
You may do whatever you like,
Mr. Bergmann.

632
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,430
[VALET:] Have a pleasant
evening, Madam.

633
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,960
[DRIVER:] You two off for a
night on the town in Granada?

634
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,560
[CATHERINE:] That's right. We’re
curious about the nightlife.

635
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,460
Just take us to a club
with a nice vibe.

636
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:03,760
LUNAR CITY VON BRAUN

637
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,130
[EXECUTIVE:] You can't do that!

638
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:12,360
Do you know how much trouble
that would cause us?

639
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,660
That’s unacceptable!

640
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:16,760
I hate to tell you this after
coming all the way from Side 7,

641
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,400
but there’s nothing I
can do for you!

642
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:21,960
[EXECUTIVE:] L‐Look, I've
heard all the rumors.

643
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,630
I already know about Dr.
Minovsky defecting.

644
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:28,360
I also know he’s planning
on coming here.

645
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:31,230
But I ask you: what
did you hope to

646
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,300
accomplish by coming here
at the 11th hour?!

647
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,060
Wait a sec!

648
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:37,330
Admiral Gopp told me personally
that Anaheim had poached him!

649
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:38,730
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know.

650
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:40,260
But that’s the head
office’s doing.

651
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,630
The truth is, they have no clue
how things work here.

652
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:47,730
Our RCX‐76 Project is coming
along just fine, thank you!

653
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,060
Alright, fine! I’ll let you
see for yourself!

654
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:54,260
I’ll take you to visit our
latest production line.

655
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,860
You see that?

656
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,700
Those completed units,

657
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,260
ready to go and already
rolling off the line!

658
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,160
We've already started making
deliveries to the military.

659
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:10,860
And they’re passing all the
tests with flying colors.

660
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,130
I know for a fact that
over at Zeonic,

661
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:15,130
their MS‐04 is over budget,

662
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:17,860
so now they're
developing the MS‐05,

663
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,600
which actually has lower specs.

664
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,260
Don’t look so surprised: I
know everything!

665
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:25,530
Just like I also know
that your own RX‐78

666
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:27,460
is starting to fall
behind schedule.

667
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,800
I guess it doesn’t matter,
though.

668
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,830
There won’t be a need for the
RX‐78 anytime soon.

669
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:35,600
Oh, I know!

670
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,460
Why don't you keep Dr.
Minovsky occupied?

671
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,400
He's your mentor, right?

672
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,960
And besides, I’m sure
you can find

673
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,960
plenty of things to
ask him about.

674
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,460
Give the Doctor a warm welcome,
okay?

675
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:08,700
[MR. RAY:] This isn't it.

676
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,630
This isn't what Dr. Minovsky
called a mobile suit!

677
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,260
This isn't it!

678
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,230
This is not a mobile suit!

679
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,330
C’mon.

680
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:04,360
[AGENT:] Von Braun,
do you read me?

681
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,600
Von Braun, come in!

682
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,730
This is TYM!

683
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:09,100
We’ve entered the next
phase of the plan.

684
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,700
Be prepared to
receive the cargo.

685
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,660
[AGENT:] We’ve left
Granada proper.

686
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,230
We’re proceeding
westwards on Route 1!

687
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,960
ETA to Abul Wafa is 10 hours.

688
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,960
[SOLDIER:] Everything is going
according to plan.

689
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,560
The Doctor is currently at
this location, here.

690
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,430
He still has a long way to go.

691
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:38,060
Ready the welcoming party.

692
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:41,000
[SOLDIER #2:] Heat sources
detected in Mare Smythii!

693
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,960
I’m guessing it’s probably those

694
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,700
new Zeon humanoid weapons!

695
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,700
Are you telling me they
have those things

696
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,530
on the Moon now?

697
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,960
How many of them?

698
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,860
I think there are four, sir.

699
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:54,130
They only have four of
those guys, huh?

700
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,230
Dispatch the Iron
Cavalry Squadron!

701
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,730
[SOLDIER:] The squadron?

702
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:58,600
All of them?

703
00:40:59,030 --> 00:40:59,900
That's right.

704
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:01,230
Normally, I wouldn't
normally choose

705
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:03,630
a sledgehammer to
swat a mere fly,

706
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:05,830
but this first
engagement is critical.

707
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:06,700
[MR. RAY:] Commander!

708
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,400
I would like to be sent out
to the battle site.

709
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:11,230
I want to see these Guncannons

710
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:13,660
in action with my own two eyes.

711
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:23,160
So Zeon is deploying their
mobile suits...

712
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,630
[SOLDIER:] Sending the
weapon to stop the man

713
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:29,700
who created said weapon.
How ironic.

714
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,260
[LOUDSPEAKER:] Emergency
mobilization alert.

715
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:35,100
Emergency mobilization alert.

716
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:38,100
Iron Cavalry Squadron,
prepare to mobilize.

717
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:42,060
Emergency mobilization alert.

718
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:44,660
Iron Cavalry Squadron,
prepare to mobilize.

719
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:51,500
[PILOT:] Erdush, launch
preparations complete!

720
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,760
[CLUB MUSIC]

721
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:16,530
The Federation forces at Von
Braun have mobilized.

722
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:19,860
They've even sent out their
prized Iron Cavalry Squadron.

723
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:21,000
Well, well.

724
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:24,300
This is going to be a night
we’ll never forget!

725
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,730
So this is twilight on the Moon.

726
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,000
[GAIA:] Hey Red, you jerk!

727
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,160
You weren’t at the
rendezvous point!

728
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,630
And why aren't you
sending out a beacon?

729
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:53,060
Sorry, you don’t
seriously want me

730
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,630
to answer that question, do you?

731
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:55,900
Damn straight I do!

732
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,430
And where does a private get off

733
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:59,360
speaking to me like that,
anyway?!

734
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,000
Alright, I’ll answer you.

735
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,500
A beacon would be seen
by the enemy.

736
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,400
Besides, you still managed to
locate me without one.

737
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,160
Didn’t you, Warrant Officer?

738
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,300
[RAMBA:] That’s enough,
both of you!

739
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,030
The rabbit's about to
enter the trap.

740
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:24,930
It's about time!

741
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,430
Let’s go rabbit hunting!

742
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:28,900
No one shoot, got that?

743
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,460
We’re just stopping the vehicle.

744
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:45,830
[AGENT:] TYM here!

745
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:48,030
We’re being ambushed by a
group of mobile suits!

746
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:56,800
Send help, now!

747
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,260
[PILOT:] Copy that!

748
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,000
We’re sending you some
assistance now!

749
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:10,400
See if you can make your way to

750
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,330
outside of the
Granada‐controlled sector!

751
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:19,460
[RAMBA:] It makes no sense!

752
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:23,360
Doctor, what are you doing?

753
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:28,560
We developed these very mobile
suits together, Doctor!

754
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:34,200
Doctor, wait! This is Capt.
Ral speaking!

755
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,000
I can guarantee your safety!

756
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,600
Just come back with me!

757
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:40,560
We're not going to make it!

758
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:42,230
We’re going to be fine!

759
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:44,530
The Federation is sending
assistance as we speak!

760
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:45,960
We can’t outrun them!

761
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:50,630
Don't shoot, Gaia! Not yet!

762
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:52,630
You're wasting our time,
Captain!

763
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:55,000
This is the perfect chance
to finish him off!

764
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:02,230
[FEDERATION PILOT:] Single red
mobile suit spotted.

765
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,830
Four more up ahead.

766
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:07,300
We’ve also located the
Doctor’s vehicle.

767
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,560
Five? I thought the report
said there were four!

768
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,730
Take them all out!

769
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:24,260
[ZEON PILOT:] Son of a...

770
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,800
That bastard started without
receiving the order!

771
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:33,160
Captain didn’t say I
couldn’t shoot you guys!

772
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:37,430
The enemy forces have engaged!

773
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,130
Copy that.

774
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:41,500
Squadron! All units, drop now!

775
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,660
[PILOT:] Our objective is to
protect the Doctor's car!

776
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:53,360
Here’s the play:
surround the enemy

777
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,630
and then take them out!

778
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,900
[AGENTS:] They're here!

779
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:04,830
They're here!

780
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,600
Don’t worry, the Federation

781
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,160
mobile suit forces have arrived.

782
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,860
They’re here to save us, Doctor.

783
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:12,530
Targets: 01 through 04!

784
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:13,930
Range, 400!

785
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,360
Fire!

786
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:51,660
Your ass is mine!

787
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,430
Good work, men!

788
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:07,930
Show those Federation scumbags
what real mobile suits can do!

789
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:10,900
No you don't!

790
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:13,030
You’re not getting
away that easily!

791
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:29,100
[PILOT:] I’m sorry, but
we can't, sir!

792
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:30,660
It’s too dangerous!

793
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:32,430
I’m not putting us in the
middle of a fight!

794
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:36,160
Don’t be an idiot! What the hell
do you think we came
all this way for?

795
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:40,030
[MR. RAY:] Do not take your eyes
off those sensors, got that?

796
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:45,300
I can't believe they've
advanced so far...

797
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:47,730
[SOLDIER:] Oh, no!

798
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:49,630
They’re gonna get
slaughtered at this rate!

799
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:50,930
Recall mobile suits!

800
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:52,930
All remaining forces, retreat!

801
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,300
[GAIA:] These aren’t
mobile suits!

802
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,160
These are playthings!

803
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,500
What the hell?

804
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:43,460
Let me guess, that’s the
handiwork of Red again?

805
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:47,200
Way to hog all the fun, you
smarmy bastard!

806
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,100
Another sucker bites the dust!

807
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:17,600
No...it can’t be...

808
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:20,730
[SHUTTLE PILOT:] We’re
overwhelmed with
multiple heat sources!

809

Our infrared sensors are
not functioning!

810

That’s Dr. Minovsky!

No, wait! Let that one go, Gaia!

812
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:50,200
That’s an order!

813
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:01,430
No, don't do it!

814
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:49,730
I'm afraid that I must refuse.

815
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:51,900
Granada is a neutral territory.

816
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,030
And as such, we cannot side

817
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:57,030
with Zeon and take
part in your war.

818
00:50:57,330 --> 00:50:59,330
And as we are fellow
lunar cities,

819
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:02,030
we’ve maintained a cordial
relationship with Von Braun

820
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:03,260
for a number of years.

821
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:07,060
I cannot participate
in something

822
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:09,430
predicated on betraying
that relationship.

823
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:12,400
Someone like you can surely
understand that.

824
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:16,960
Just a moment.

825
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:26,130
I see. A job well done.

826
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:29,130
Please give Capt.
Ral my regards.

827
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:33,500
Mr. Mayor. There’s been an
interesting development.

828
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:37,660
My men have wiped out a
squadron‐sized Federation
force at Mare Smythii.

829
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,660
I’ll let that sink in a bit.

830
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:44,830
For this is the kind of power
that Zeon already possesses.

831
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,300
That can’t be possible!

832
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:48,560
We must confirm this with
Prime Minister Gihren!

833
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,600
That’s Supreme Commander Gihren!

834
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:57,760
Zeon is no longer a republic,
it’s a principality.

835
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,930
My father will name himself
as its sovereign,

836
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:03,900
and he’ll declare our
independence any time now!

837
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,560
Maybe, but I can’t
take your word.

838
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,200
I must confirm it myself.

839
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,430
Be careful on your way home.

840
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:14,560
Granada can be a very
dangerous place.

841
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,530
Tell me, Bergmann.

842
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:20,930
How do you suppose that the
Mayor knew about the war?

843
00:52:22,930 --> 00:52:25,830
I made a request that we
merely be allowed

844
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:28,000
to place a garrison
force at Granada

845
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,760
equal in size to one that
the Federation has.

846
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,430
I didn't say anything
about using it

847
00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:34,960
as a launching point to
attack Von Braun!

848
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,230
Uh...all I did was...

849
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:38,160
[SILENCED GUNSHOTS]

850
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,800
A secret agency has no need
for blabbermouths.

851

F‐Forgive me, Missus
Catherine...

852

Pathetic fool.

853
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,660
We can finally drop the charade.

854
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:24,230
[MR RAY:] Our company must adopt
new policies without delay!

855
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:28,200
The entirety of the RCX‐76
squadron that we delivered

856
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,930
was completely annihilated by a
mere five mobile suits!

857
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:34,330
That makes the score 12 to 0!

858
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:35,830
A complete shutout!

859
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:41,433
You speak as if you aren’t even
a part of the project.

You're as much to blame
as anyone else!

He's right!

How dare you point the
finger at us!

863
00:53:46,333 --> 00:53:47,166
I admit...

864
00:53:47,166 --> 00:53:49,966
The blame certainly does
lie partly with me.

865
00:53:49,966 --> 00:53:53,166
Let me officially take full
responsibility.

866
00:53:53,166 --> 00:53:54,733
Please, I need your help.

867
00:53:54,733 --> 00:53:58,433
Help me to advance the RX
Project into the next phase!

868
00:53:58,433 --> 00:54:00,700
You’re just in this for your
own self‐interest!

869
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:02,033
You don’t belong here!

870
00:54:02,033 --> 00:54:04,900
If you’d like me to leave,
I will. Gladly.

871
00:54:05,266 --> 00:54:07,100
However, what will
become of your

872
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:09,900
mobile suit development
program after this?

873
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:11,833
It will be dead in the water!

874
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:15,566
Which means you will be
forfeiting the game to Zeonic!

875
00:54:15,566 --> 00:54:18,033
Dr. Minovsky decided to defect.

876
00:54:18,033 --> 00:54:21,333
He sacrificed everything for the
chance to work with us!

877
00:54:21,333 --> 00:54:24,000
And in the end, he
sacrificed his own life!

878
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,533
I was there when it happened,

879
00:54:25,533 --> 00:54:27,533
but there wasn’t
anything I could do!

But we can carry on his work!

That is easier said than done...

882
00:54:32,033 --> 00:54:34,166
I can certainly sympathize you,
however—

883
00:54:34,166 --> 00:54:35,833
There’s no need for concern.

884
00:54:35,833 --> 00:54:38,200
The project has been
coming along nicely.

885

Haro likes Fraw. Likes, likes!

I love Fraw!

Shut up!

If you don’t cut it out, I’m
gonna yank out your battery!

More military mumbo‐jumbo...

These don’t look anything like

E.F.S.F. Supreme Commander,

974
00:59:39,466 --> 00:59:42,300
recently said the following
in an interview:

975
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:45,633
I won't abandon the hope
of averting war.

976
00:59:45,633 --> 00:59:47,700
The reason being that this war

977
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:49,800
will almost certainly
result in a disaster

978
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:54,166
worse than any other war mankind
has ever experienced.

and the Federation are now
officially at war!

986
01:00:39,766 --> 01:00:41,633

This has already turned out
to be a fine mess.

Where are you going now?

Just to a friend’s place.

Hey, wait!

01:00:52,366 --> 01:00:54,400
Now’s not the time to
be going out!

I'm coming in!

Welcome, Fraw.

01:01:04,733 --> 01:01:06,300
Please enjoy your stay.

998
01:01:06,966 --> 01:01:09,033
You sure are clever, aren’t you?

999
01:01:09,266 --> 01:01:10,966
Please pardon the mess.

Amuro, are you going
to come down?

1004
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:31,366
The lasagna I brought over is
going to get cold!

1005
01:01:48,733 --> 01:01:51,033
Why do you have to be
such a jerk?!

1006
01:01:51,433 --> 01:01:54,466
All you ever do is just sit in
front of that that computer!

1007
01:01:54,866 --> 01:01:57,633
Do you even realize there’s
a war going on?!

1008
01:01:57,633 --> 01:02:01,766
And tons of people are dying,

I'm sorry.

I’m looking forward to
it... your lasagna...

Don’t you worry.

I’m gonna eat it.

It may seem like I don’t care.

1015

But truth is, I’m scared
about the war.

1016
01:02:31,666 --> 01:02:34,933
However, there’s nothing I
can do about it.

There’s nothing I can do
anything about, really.

I love the way they twinkle.
It’s so pretty.

twinkle here in space.

What, is that true?

Do me a favor and sit tight.
