334
00:17:54,104 --> 00:17:57,152
Several students in this class
stole a construction vehicle

335
00:17:57,152 --> 00:18:00,158
and attempted to enter the
development sector.

336
00:18:00,158 --> 00:18:02,204
Thank goodness they
were released,

337
00:18:02,204 --> 00:18:03,582
but anyone else who gets caught

338
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:06,379
may not get off as
easily next time.

339
00:18:06,379 --> 00:18:08,174
As you know, war has broken out

340
00:18:08,174 --> 00:18:11,640
between the Principality of Zeon
and the Earth Federation.

341
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,809
During this crisis,

342
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:16,357
we must do our utmost to avoid
dangerous activities.

343
00:18:16,357 --> 00:18:18,779
That includes to not under
any circumstances

344
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:20,908
go near the development sector.

345
00:18:20,908 --> 00:18:22,578
Is that clear?

346
00:18:22,578 --> 00:18:26,252
[gentle instrumental music]

347
00:18:37,441 --> 00:18:39,821
‐ [Man] Commander Ramba Ral,
entering the bridge.

348
00:18:39,821 --> 00:18:41,908
‐ Ah, great, you're here.

349
00:18:44,622 --> 00:18:47,419
The initial fleet battle was a
complete victory.

350
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:49,298
We sure showed that high
and mighty Reval

351
00:18:49,298 --> 00:18:50,551
a thing or two.

352
00:18:52,262 --> 00:18:56,020
Hey, now, what's with
the long face?

353
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,316
Isn't our victory worth
a little smile?

354
00:18:58,316 --> 00:19:01,113
‐ Truth be told, I would have
much rather participated

355
00:19:01,113 --> 00:19:02,909
in a fleet battle.

356
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:05,831
Hatte's defense forces are of
little to no consequence.

357
00:19:05,831 --> 00:19:08,169
I saw no need to
declare war on them.

358
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:10,508
‐ Come on, don't be like that.

359
00:19:10,508 --> 00:19:13,221
‐ That's Island Iffish,
isn't it?

360
00:19:13,221 --> 00:19:14,724
We could have taken it
in half a day

361
00:19:14,724 --> 00:19:16,018
if we chose to,

362
00:19:16,018 --> 00:19:19,024
and yet we were ordered to
leave it untouched.

363
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:22,197
‐ Precisely, that's why I
called you here.

364
00:19:22,197 --> 00:19:24,243
Our brilliant Supreme
Leader Gihren

365
00:19:24,243 --> 00:19:26,288
came up with an ingenious plan.

366
00:19:26,288 --> 00:19:29,002
In one stroke, he will put an
immediate end to this war,

367
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:32,467
ensuring Zeon a
decisive victory.

368
00:19:32,467 --> 00:19:33,971
‐ We are going to murder
those citizens

369
00:19:33,971 --> 00:19:35,306
and drop a colony?

370
00:19:35,306 --> 00:19:38,897
‐ Sh, you may want to
rephrase that.

371
00:19:38,897 --> 00:19:39,816
The way you're putting it,

372
00:19:39,816 --> 00:19:43,447
it makes it sounds like we're
doing something wrong.

373
00:19:43,447 --> 00:19:44,576
You there.

374
00:19:44,576 --> 00:19:45,619
‐ [Soldiers] Yes, sir.

375
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:48,542
‐ This is confidential between
me and the commander.

376
00:19:48,542 --> 00:19:49,669
Now get lost.

377
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:50,588
‐ Yes, sir.

378
00:19:55,054 --> 00:19:57,560
‐ Listen, this is war time here.

379
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,812
If we're at war with Hatte,

380
00:19:58,812 --> 00:20:00,148
then they're the enemy.

381
00:20:00,148 --> 00:20:01,400
Don't you get that.

382
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,235
‐ I know.

383
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:03,697
‐ I'm not done.

384
00:20:03,697 --> 00:20:06,076
Before you say anything,

385
00:20:06,076 --> 00:20:08,164
take a look at this here.

386
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,755
We'll attach external
engines to the colony,

387
00:20:11,755 --> 00:20:12,965
take it out of orbit,

388
00:20:12,965 --> 00:20:14,928
send it into low Earth orbit,

389
00:20:14,928 --> 00:20:18,852
and drop it on Federation
General HQ at Jaburo.

390
00:20:19,979 --> 00:20:21,566
You get it now?

391
00:20:21,566 --> 00:20:23,862
They anticipated they'd be
going to war with us

392
00:20:23,862 --> 00:20:25,323
and even prepped for it.

393
00:20:25,323 --> 00:20:28,287
How else do explain building the
new Jaburo Headquarters

394
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,375
under 1,000 meters of bedrock?

395
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,045
But this will smash it.

396
00:20:32,045 --> 00:20:33,381
‐ And I'm to carry this out?

397
00:20:33,381 --> 00:20:35,134
‐ Exactly, with the assistance

398
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:36,888
of your Mobile Suit team.

399
00:20:36,888 --> 00:20:39,059
‐ I will do no such thing.

400
00:20:39,936 --> 00:20:41,397
‐ What did you say?

401
00:20:41,397 --> 00:20:42,650
‐ I get it now.

402
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,946
Lord Gihren would plan
something like this.

403
00:20:44,946 --> 00:20:48,704
However, a military man should
never even suggest this

404
00:20:48,704 --> 00:20:50,373
because it's the work
of the devil.

405
00:20:50,373 --> 00:20:51,500
It's evil.

406
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,131
‐ You dare call me a devil.

407
00:20:54,131 --> 00:20:55,174
Look who's talking.

408
00:20:55,174 --> 00:20:57,178
That makes you a hypocrite.

409
00:20:57,178 --> 00:20:58,807
You have the blood of
hundreds of millions

410
00:20:58,807 --> 00:21:00,728
of Hatte civilians
on your hands.

411
00:21:00,728 --> 00:21:02,272
If anyone here is the devil,

412
00:21:02,272 --> 00:21:03,775
that would be you.

413
00:21:03,775 --> 00:21:07,282
Those poor souls are going to
wind up dead anyway.

414
00:21:07,282 --> 00:21:08,117
At least this way,

415
00:21:08,117 --> 00:21:09,829
their deaths are counting
for something.

416
00:21:09,829 --> 00:21:10,664
When you think about it,

417
00:21:10,664 --> 00:21:12,250
it's the most sensible option.

418
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,920
‐ No it is not.

419
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,048
‐ Why not?

420
00:21:15,048 --> 00:21:17,010
Why don't you agree?

‐ Admiral Dozle, this war
is sheer insanity.

423
00:21:23,523 --> 00:21:25,736
Zeon Zum Deikun would
never approve

424

00:33:59,408 --> 00:34:00,744
to win this war.

662
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:07,424
‐ I'm returning to my chambers.

663
00:34:07,424 --> 00:34:10,471
Garma, if you would
please accompany me.

664
00:34:10,471 --> 00:34:11,307
‐ Yes.

665
00:34:14,146 --> 00:34:18,237
‐ Too bad, he's getting on in
years, dear father.

666
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:21,953
[growling]

667
00:34:26,086 --> 00:34:29,259
‐ Zena, Maneva, where are you?

668
00:34:29,259 --> 00:34:30,512
I'm back.

669
00:34:30,512 --> 00:34:33,267
Are my two girls still awake?

670
00:34:33,267 --> 00:34:34,353
Zena, Maneva,

671
00:34:35,647 --> 00:34:38,402
oh, Maneva, you
waited up for me.

672
00:34:40,281 --> 00:34:42,912
Pretty girl, oh how
I missed you.

673
00:34:42,912 --> 00:34:44,957
[baby crying]

674
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:47,253
Oh, you opened up your eyes.

675
00:34:47,253 --> 00:34:48,673
Your papa's here.

676
00:34:48,673 --> 00:34:49,509
That's right.

677
00:34:49,509 --> 00:34:50,803
I'm your daddy.

678
00:34:50,803 --> 00:34:51,930
Who am I?

679
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:55,562
Your daddy. [laughing]

680
00:34:55,562 --> 00:34:58,067
[baby crying]

681
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:04,831
‐ Oh, there, there, did
you get scared?

682
00:35:04,831 --> 00:35:07,168
Your daddy can be so naughty.

683
00:35:07,168 --> 00:35:09,674
[baby crying]

684
00:35:12,763 --> 00:35:14,391
‐ [Dozle] Is she asleep?

685
00:35:14,391 --> 00:35:16,688
‐ Yes, she's asleep.

686
00:35:16,688 --> 00:35:18,608
We played together all day long.

687
00:35:18,608 --> 00:35:21,113
I think it tires her out.

688
00:35:21,113 --> 00:35:22,700
‐ Aw, how adorable.

689
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:26,916
Maneva's so previous.

690
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:30,256
I couldn't bear if something
happened to her.

691
00:35:30,256 --> 00:35:33,513
What have I, [crying].

692
00:35:35,517 --> 00:35:39,984
Just how many millions of little
Maneva's have perished

693
00:35:39,984 --> 00:35:42,197
all because of me?

694
00:35:42,197 --> 00:35:44,284
[crying]

695
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:50,964
[gentle instrumental music]

696
00:35:56,518 --> 00:36:00,191
Maneva started crying the
instant she saw my face.

697
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:03,573
Does my face look
that terrifying?

698
00:36:03,573 --> 00:36:05,953
I guess I must have the
face of the devil

699
00:36:05,953 --> 00:36:06,871
or an ogre.

700
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,211
Yes, that must be it.

701
00:36:10,211 --> 00:36:11,923
‐ Don't be silly, my dear.

702
00:36:11,923 --> 00:36:13,844
She was cranky because
she was sleepy.

703
00:36:13,844 --> 00:36:15,597
There's no need to read into it.

704
00:36:15,597 --> 00:36:17,267
‐ Do you think so?

705
00:36:17,267 --> 00:36:19,814
Is that why she was crying?

706
00:36:19,814 --> 00:36:22,611
I hope that you're right.

707
00:36:22,611 --> 00:36:25,993
You know, I like my family the
way it was before

708
00:36:25,993 --> 00:36:27,955
back when we all lived
together in this house

709
00:36:27,955 --> 00:36:29,584
and when we got along.

710
00:36:29,584 --> 00:36:31,504
Sasura was still alive,

711
00:36:31,504 --> 00:36:33,967
and Garma was just a tiny
kid and so cute.

712
00:36:33,967 --> 00:36:37,140
Well, I guess Garma's
still really cute.

713
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,477
[grunting]

714
00:36:39,477 --> 00:36:40,313
Zena,

715
00:36:42,317 --> 00:36:44,279
I am going to make it
my personal goal

716
00:36:44,279 --> 00:36:45,699
to make sure that you
don't regret

717
00:36:45,699 --> 00:36:47,828
marrying into the Zabi family.

718
00:36:47,828 --> 00:36:49,247
You and I together,

719
00:36:49,247 --> 00:36:52,420
we can create a new
legacy for the Zabis.

720
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,592
I want you to bear me
lots of children,

721
00:36:54,592 --> 00:36:57,723
brothers for Maneva
and sisters too.

722
00:36:57,723 --> 00:37:00,061
We'll make plenty of good
little children,

723
00:37:00,061 --> 00:37:01,981
and I swear I will
keep them safe,

724
00:37:01,981 --> 00:37:04,277
every single one of them.

725
00:37:04,277 --> 00:37:06,156
[murmuring]

726
00:37:06,156 --> 00:37:08,452
Anyone who lays a hand
on you or Maneva

727
00:37:08,452 --> 00:37:11,960
will answer to me, no
matter who they are.

728
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:14,548
I get it now.

729
00:37:14,548 --> 00:37:17,638
This is the reason men fight,
see?

730
00:37:17,638 --> 00:37:19,767
When you have people
that you love,

731
00:37:19,767 --> 00:37:21,896
you have no choice but to fight.

732
00:37:21,896 --> 00:37:24,067
Those fools living in Hatte,

733
00:37:24,067 --> 00:37:26,488
and the same can be said
for the Federation,

734
00:37:26,488 --> 00:37:30,539
they were too weak to keep
their Manevas safe,

735
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:32,375
so it was their fault.

736
00:37:33,837 --> 00:37:35,799
I am not weak like them.

737
00:37:37,468 --> 00:37:40,474
I will crush every
single one of them.

738
00:37:40,474 --> 00:37:42,688
If they dare touch
Maneva and Zena,

739
00:37:42,688 --> 00:37:44,817
I'll rip them in half,

740
00:37:44,817 --> 00:37:46,821
on this I swear, dammit.

741
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,204
[baby crying]

742
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:55,337
‐ Oh no, she's awake again.

[baby crying]

744
00:37:57,551 --> 00:37:59,597
There, there, you poor thing,

745
00:37:59,597 --> 00:38:02,477
I'm afraid your daddy just
loves to shout so.

746
00:38:02,477 --> 00:38:04,105
Oh, oh.

747
00:38:04,105 --> 00:38:05,066
‐ I'm sorry.

748
00:38:05,066 --> 00:38:05,901
‐ Oh, oh.

749
00:38:11,244 --> 00:38:13,165
[dramatic instrumental music]

[metal clattering]

752
00:38:41,221 --> 00:38:43,810
‐ [Reporter] The military has
mobilized to keep the peace.

753
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:46,774
They're opening fire on the
pro‐Zeon protestors.

754
00:38:46,774 --> 00:38:48,570
The Loum government appears
to have hardened

755
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:50,239
its anti‐Zeon position

756
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:53,538
and has the full backing of the
Federation military.

757

[siren ringing]

758
00:38:56,669 --> 00:38:58,590
‐ [Doctor] No, we can't accept
any more patients.

759
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:00,009
‐ Send the injured to
another hospital.

760
00:39:00,009 --> 00:39:03,015
‐ Doctor, this kid is
hurt real bad.

761
00:39:05,729 --> 00:39:08,442
‐ Please, you can't let him die.

762

[yelling]

763
00:39:10,237 --> 00:39:12,241
‐ I'll do what I can
to treat him.

764
00:39:12,241 --> 00:39:15,582
Please, move him to the
sofa over there.

765
00:39:16,709 --> 00:39:19,506
‐ You're Miss Artesia,
aren't you?

766
00:39:20,592 --> 00:39:21,928
‐ I'm sorry.

767
00:39:21,928 --> 00:39:23,388
You're mistaken.

768
00:39:23,388 --> 00:39:26,311
‐ Before you go, my
identification.

769
00:39:29,275 --> 00:39:30,862
Might you consider giving
me a few minutes

770
00:39:30,862 --> 00:39:32,824
of your time now?

771
00:39:32,824 --> 00:39:35,454
[helicopter engine running]

772
00:39:35,454 --> 00:39:38,168
‐ What did you want to speak to
me about, Lieutenant Tachi?

773
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:39,588
I've got to admit to you,

774
00:39:39,588 --> 00:39:40,799
you are an odd one.

775
00:39:40,799 --> 00:39:42,426
I've never had an
intelligence operative

776
00:39:42,426 --> 00:39:44,264
show me his ID before.

777
00:39:46,268 --> 00:39:49,482
‐ Long time no see,
Lady Artesia.

778
00:39:49,482 --> 00:39:50,527
I don't know if you're aware,

779
00:39:50,527 --> 00:39:52,531
but when you and your
brother escaped Munzo,

780
00:39:52,531 --> 00:39:55,620
I played a
significant part in it,

781
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,914
although in truth,

782
00:39:56,914 --> 00:39:59,168
the only thing I did was follow
Mr. Ral's instructions

783
00:39:59,168 --> 00:40:02,551
on how to get you and your
party past customs.

784
00:40:02,551 --> 00:40:03,720
‐ I would really appreciate it

785
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,974
if you would just stop
beating around the bush.

786
00:40:05,974 --> 00:40:07,644
It's not that I'm not
interested in hearing

787
00:40:07,644 --> 00:40:09,022
what you have to say,

788
00:40:09,022 --> 00:40:10,232
but it isn't a good time.

789
00:40:10,232 --> 00:40:12,320
A lot is happening right now.

790
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,405
‐ I'm well aware of that.

791
00:40:13,405 --> 00:40:15,075
It's the reason why
I'm even here.

792
00:40:15,075 --> 00:40:17,038
You see, I wouldn't have been
able to have made contact

793
00:40:17,038 --> 00:40:19,585
if it weren't for the current
state of affairs.

794
00:40:19,585 --> 00:40:21,046
Believe me, it's no easy task

795
00:40:21,046 --> 00:40:23,300
to beat the Kycilia
Agency to the punch,

796
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,306
intelligence operative or not.

797
00:40:26,306 --> 00:40:27,726
Now you're familiar with a man

798
00:40:27,726 --> 00:40:30,648
named Char Aznable, aren't you?

799
00:40:30,648 --> 00:40:31,483
‐ What?

800
00:40:31,483 --> 00:40:32,318
Char?

801
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:34,782

[gentle instrumental music]

803
00:40:41,837 --> 00:40:42,839
What is it?

804
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:44,593
What is this all about?

805
00:40:44,593 --> 00:40:47,181
‐ I first took note when he was
expelled from the academy

806
00:40:47,181 --> 00:40:49,310
for inciting the cadet uprising,

807
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:51,314
and since then, he's made a
name for himself

808
00:40:51,314 --> 00:40:53,360
as the pilot of a red
Mobile Suit.

809
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,615
He's now a young hero of Zeon,

810
00:40:55,615 --> 00:40:59,497
and he's risen from enlisted
man to lieutenant.

811
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:04,382
I suggest that you keep a
close eye on him.

812
00:41:04,382 --> 00:41:07,889
‐ What exactly are you
trying to say?

813
00:41:07,889 --> 00:41:09,893
‐ I have one other piece
of information.

814
00:41:09,893 --> 00:41:12,273
It's about Casval Rem Deikun.

815
00:41:12,273 --> 00:41:13,985
He's still alive.

816

[metal clattering]

818
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,249
Although to be perfectly honest,

819
00:41:21,249 --> 00:41:22,293
all of this is just based

820
00:41:22,293 --> 00:41:23,713
on my personal opinion.

821
00:41:23,713 --> 00:41:25,592
‐ No, please wait.

822
00:41:25,592 --> 00:41:27,386
‐ Sorry I can't stay longer.

823

984
00:49:50,517 --> 00:49:52,312
‐ Let us not forget.

985
00:49:52,312 --> 00:49:54,650
Every one of us is a
war criminal.

986
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:58,032
Should we fail, it will be
the gallows for us.

[murmuring]

988
00:50:03,877 --> 00:50:06,298
The enemy's forces are
split in two.

989
00:50:06,298 --> 00:50:08,512
One of them, led by Vice
Admiral Tianum,

990
00:50:08,512 --> 00:50:10,933
is currently hovering
near the Loum area,

991
00:50:10,933 --> 00:50:14,231
composed of 15 Magellan
class battleships,

992
00:50:14,231 --> 00:50:17,403
also 45 Salamis class cruisers,

993
00:50:17,403 --> 00:50:19,992
as well as Lepanto class
missile frigates,

994
00:50:19,992 --> 00:50:21,788
landing crafts and the usual.

995
00:50:21,788 --> 00:50:25,336
This fleet alone is comparable
to our entire force.

996
00:50:25,336 --> 00:50:26,714
[murmuring]

997
00:50:26,714 --> 00:50:29,762
Furthermore, Reval's main force
will be joining them,

998
00:50:29,762 --> 00:50:32,225
and this fleet will
probably be three times

999
00:50:32,225 --> 00:50:34,814
the size of Tianum's,
a real armada.

1000
00:50:34,814 --> 00:50:37,695
‐ A force four times our size?

1001
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:39,907
‐ That's right, four
times larger.

1002
00:50:39,907 --> 00:50:40,951
Nothing can be done about

1003
00:50:40,951 --> 00:50:42,705
the difference in
fighting strength,

1004
00:50:42,705 --> 00:50:45,836
so that's why we will not
be implementing

1005
00:50:45,836 --> 00:50:47,881
some ineffective plan to
divide our force

1006
00:50:47,881 --> 00:50:49,844
into smaller ones to
attack them.

1007
00:50:49,844 --> 00:50:52,390
Instead, we are going to hit
the Tianum fleet

1008
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:54,394

you intend to do

00:50:58,945 --> 00:51:00,699
about Reval's main force?

1012
00:51:00,699 --> 00:51:01,868
‐ Don't worry.

1013
00:51:01,868 --> 00:51:03,495
We will hit Reval's force

1014

with a Special Assault Regiment

What's that?

‐ I know that you generals are
unfamiliar with it,

but the unit has
already proven itself

more than capable in battle.

1023

For this mission,

1024
00:51:21,824 --> 00:51:24,496
I'll organize it into
two battalions,

1025
00:51:24,496 --> 00:51:26,249
and the fleet led by Reval

1026

during Operation British,

1086
00:53:57,301 --> 00:53:59,765
so an arrest warrant's been
issued for him,

1087
00:53:59,765 --> 00:54:01,769
and if you don't hand
him over to us,

1088
00:54:01,769 --> 00:54:03,271
we'll bring you in too.

already been punished

Besides, the direct order that
you are referring to

was actually issued by
Vice Admiral Dozle,

do with Kycilia.

Stay where you are,
or we'll shoot.

somebody help us.

Please, you've got to help us.

Thugs came from the Bay

and started attacking
the village.

‐ Mr. Aznable's house
is on fire too.

‐ They said they're going to
kill everyone in the park.

1166
00:59:53,054 --> 00:59:56,143
They said it's because we're all
Zeon supporters here.

01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:47,538
Seal up the doors and windows,

Hey, wait.

Where's Sayla?

Sayla.

‐ Yes, we have plenty.

They're really old though.

How about this?

A Winchester model 1873,

Everyone, take your seats

‐ So Miranda's been attacked,
huh?

1269
01:06:54,855 --> 01:06:56,525
‐ Yes, there are multiple
damage reports

from all Side Five Banshees,

1271

and those reports indicate

1272
01:06:59,531 --> 01:07:00,659
that their docking bay sections

1273
01:07:00,659 --> 01:07:02,788
have been largely crippled.

1274

‐ This doesn't make sense.

1275
01:07:04,415 --> 01:07:05,585
I would have thought
Zeon would want

1276
01:07:05,585 --> 01:07:08,006
to focus all its efforts on
a fleet battle.

1277
01:07:08,006 --> 01:07:09,342
‐ Perhaps we should
divert some ships

1278
01:07:09,342 --> 01:07:10,679
to defend Loum.

the second fleet

would be the closest.

01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:18,736
However, we are also the ones

who are located closest to
the Zeon fleet.

we'd be attacked from behind
by Dozle's ships.

1287
01:07:27,879 --> 01:07:30,342
We'll have to leave Loum
to Reval then.

After all, we only
initiated this operation

based on intelligence that
Reval himself received.

the garrison fleet is
stuck there,

1294
01:07:52,596 --> 01:07:55,059
so they are requesting for
our assistance.

‐ I see.

1296
01:07:55,935 --> 01:07:57,981
We did not anticipate this.

1297
01:07:57,981 --> 01:07:59,317

‐ They're even covering the
incident on the news.

to assist them?

1303

‐ That's not a good option.

1304
01:08:09,505 --> 01:08:10,590
Tianum's got his hands full

1305
01:08:10,590 --> 01:08:13,679
facing off against almost the
entire Zeon fleet.

1306
01:08:13,679 --> 01:08:16,685
I doubt he wants to
divert a single ship.

1307
01:08:16,685 --> 01:08:19,733
With that said, we must act.

1308
01:08:19,733 --> 01:08:22,196
Send Cunningham and Walking's
fleets over there.

1309

‐ Yes, sir.

01:08:23,031 --> 01:08:24,660
‐ Also, dispatch supply
and landing ships

1311
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:27,164
to provide aid to the
civilians in that area.

1312
01:08:27,164 --> 01:08:28,125
‐ Yes.

1313
01:08:28,125 --> 01:08:29,502
‐ Inform the bridge
that the combined

1314
01:08:29,502 --> 01:08:32,174
first and third fleet will stay
on its current course.

1315
01:08:32,174 --> 01:08:33,135
‐ [Officer] Yes, sir.

1316
01:08:33,135 --> 01:08:35,890
‐ Alright, men, looks like we're
upping our timeline.

1317
01:08:35,890 --> 01:08:37,727
‐ [Officers] Yes, sir.

1318
01:08:40,065 --> 01:08:42,403
[foreboding instrumental music]

1319
01:08:42,403 --> 01:08:44,323
‐ Uh, begging your pardon, sir.

1320
01:08:44,323 --> 01:08:46,453
Our fleet has arrived at the
final defense line

1321
01:08:46,453 --> 01:08:50,210
in the orbit between Side
Three and the Moon.

1322
01:08:52,716 --> 01:08:55,012
Ever since Vice Admiral
Dozle's fleet,

1323
01:08:55,012 --> 01:08:57,809
which is at the core of this
operation, set sail,

1324
01:08:57,809 --> 01:08:59,855
he has been advancing
towards the Loum front

1325
01:08:59,855 --> 01:09:01,525
under radio silence.

1326
01:09:02,694 --> 01:09:06,869
‐ To our fatherland, to the
principality of Zeon, salute.

1327
01:09:10,083 --> 01:09:12,547
‐ [Officer] As you can see, the
fleet has already spread out

1328
01:09:12,547 --> 01:09:14,843
and taken battle formation‐‐

1329
01:09:14,843 --> 01:09:16,346
‐ How frustrating.

1330
01:09:16,346 --> 01:09:18,851
Hey, father, I mean sovereign,

1331
01:09:19,811 --> 01:09:21,690
I think I made the
wrong decision.

1332
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:23,903
I should have requested a
position in the space forces,

1333
01:09:23,903 --> 01:09:25,030
not the ground forces.

1334
01:09:25,030 --> 01:09:25,865
‐ No, strike that.

1335
01:09:25,865 --> 01:09:28,161
I have a new report on the
enemy's activity.

1336
01:09:28,161 --> 01:09:30,667
The rebel fleet has split
into two groups.

1337
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:32,879
One has changed course
towards Loum.

1338
01:09:32,879 --> 01:09:33,881
They appear to have fallen

1339
01:09:33,881 --> 01:09:35,802
for our diversionary operation.

1340
01:09:35,802 --> 01:09:38,849
This alters our relative
fighting strengths considerably.

1341
01:09:38,849 --> 01:09:41,271
It is now roughly three to one.

1342
01:09:41,271 --> 01:09:42,774
We have also just
received a report

1343
01:09:42,774 --> 01:09:45,530
from the commando team that
was sent to Loum.

1344
01:09:45,530 --> 01:09:47,074
‐ That's the team
that Char's in.

1345
01:09:47,074 --> 01:09:48,995
‐ [Officer] Attack successful,

1346
01:09:48,995 --> 01:09:50,080
mission accomplished,

1347
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:52,459
no losses to friendly forces.

1348
01:09:52,459 --> 01:09:54,590
Upon retrieval of
Mobile Suit forces,

1349
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:55,925
you will make for the Loum area

1350
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:58,388
and rendezvous with Special
Assault Regiment.

1351
01:09:58,388 --> 01:10:02,396
[foreboding instrumental music]

1352
01:10:06,864 --> 01:10:10,162
‐ Alright, men, this is the
battle we've been waiting for.

1353
01:10:10,162 --> 01:10:12,959
The curtain's rising on a
new kind of warfare,

1354
01:10:12,959 --> 01:10:16,049
and you will be the lead actors
in the opening act.

1355
01:10:16,049 --> 01:10:17,886
We have one goal here,

1356
01:10:17,886 --> 01:10:21,059
and that is to beat
the Federation.

1357
01:10:21,059 --> 01:10:24,148
If we win, the
world's our oyster.

1358
01:10:24,148 --> 01:10:27,237
Rank, glory, and bonuses,
all around.

1359
01:10:28,658 --> 01:10:30,828
‐ Plus there's one more thing.

1360
01:10:30,828 --> 01:10:32,456
There's a punk out
there named Char

1361
01:10:32,456 --> 01:10:34,085
with a red suit.

1362
01:10:34,085 --> 01:10:37,174
You better make sure we
outperform that guy.

1363
01:10:37,174 --> 01:10:39,470
There's no way he's
getting the prize,

1364
01:10:39,470 --> 01:10:41,307
not out from under us.

1365
01:10:41,307 --> 01:10:42,769
Let's do this.

‐ [Officer] The Tianum fleet is
almost within firing range

1370
01:11:05,397 --> 01:11:06,482
of the enemy.

1371
01:11:07,819 --> 01:11:10,742
‐ Alright, go ahead and give
them the permission to engage,

1372
01:11:10,742 --> 01:11:12,411
and the Minovsky
Particle status?

[electronic beeping]

1374
01:11:15,417 --> 01:11:17,672
‐ Not good, it's already
causing some interference

1375
01:11:17,672 --> 01:11:20,636
with our radar and data links.

1376
01:11:20,636 --> 01:11:22,014
‐ Recon craft status.

1377
01:11:22,014 --> 01:11:23,058
‐ Handled, sir.

1378
01:11:23,058 --> 01:11:24,603
We've put together an
extra rotation

1379
01:11:24,603 --> 01:11:26,439
in addition to our
regular patrols.

[rocket engines running]

1381
01:11:29,195 --> 01:11:30,072
We've had them circling

1382
01:11:30,072 --> 01:11:33,244
the region nonstop
since this morning.

1383
01:11:34,288 --> 01:11:37,044
‐ Warfare has no choice
but to change.

1384
01:11:37,044 --> 01:11:39,048
Let's head up to the bridge.

1385
01:11:39,048 --> 01:11:41,804
Update me with new intel
as it comes in.

1386
01:11:41,804 --> 01:11:43,098
‐ Yes, sir.

1387
01:11:43,098 --> 01:11:45,393
‐ Distance now less than 10,000.

1388
01:11:45,393 --> 01:11:48,943
Enemy composition, three
battleship groups‐‐

1389
01:11:48,943 --> 01:11:51,489
‐ Dammit, this is aggravating.

1390
01:11:51,489 --> 01:11:54,370
I'm just stuck here
watching all this.

1391
01:11:54,370 --> 01:11:56,457
I bet you Char's in
the thick of it.

1392
01:11:56,457 --> 01:11:58,629
He's probably pursuing the
enemy fleet right now.

1393
01:11:58,629 --> 01:12:00,550
‐ That's enough, Garma.

1394
01:12:01,927 --> 01:12:05,350
In this world, there are those
whose deaths do not matter.

1395
01:12:05,350 --> 01:12:08,064
Then there are those to whom
it is not permitted.

1396
01:12:08,064 --> 01:12:10,193
You must prepare
yourself to be ready

1397
01:12:10,193 --> 01:12:11,780
when the time comes.

1398
01:12:11,780 --> 01:12:13,909
‐ With all due respect father,

1399
01:12:13,909 --> 01:12:16,497
I cannot be systematic when it
comes to people's lives

1400
01:12:16,497 --> 01:12:17,542
at a time like this.

1401
01:12:17,542 --> 01:12:18,878
‐ [Officer] Minovsky
Particle dispersal

1402
01:12:18,878 --> 01:12:20,756
appears to be increasing.

1403
01:12:20,756 --> 01:12:23,136
Density increase is sustaining.

1404
01:12:23,136 --> 01:12:25,850
Visual feed quality
is degrading.

1405
01:12:25,850 --> 01:12:28,104
The battle is about to begin.

01:12:33,657 --> 01:12:34,743
has reached a combat level.

1409

‐ [Man] Capacitor is
holding steady.

1410
01:12:35,912 --> 01:12:37,582
‐ [Man] Bearing 181 confirmed.

1411
01:12:37,582 --> 01:12:40,838
‐ All hands prepare to
initiate barrage.

1412
01:12:40,838 --> 01:12:42,216
‐ All hands ready the canons.

1413
01:12:42,216 --> 01:12:43,552
‐ All hands ready the canons.

1414
01:12:43,552 --> 01:12:44,638
‐ Prepare to fire.

1415
01:12:44,638 --> 01:12:46,265
‐ Loading of launch tubes one,
two, three confirmed.

1416
01:12:46,265 --> 01:12:47,977
‐ Switching system over
to canon fire.

1417
01:12:47,977 --> 01:12:49,355
‐ [Man] Stabilizers activated.

1418
01:12:49,355 --> 01:12:50,608
Safety is disengaged.

1419
01:12:50,608 --> 01:12:53,404
‐ [Man] Bearing 181, 012.

1420
01:12:53,404 --> 01:12:54,699
‐ [Man] Parameters entered.

1421
01:12:54,699 --> 01:12:56,118
‐ Here we go.

1422
01:12:56,118 --> 01:12:58,164
Commence barrage.

1423
01:12:58,164 --> 01:13:00,920
[weapons firing]

1424
01:13:06,932 --> 01:13:09,436
‐ [Officer] Our fleet has
launched a first attack.

1425
01:13:09,436 --> 01:13:11,984
‐ But the enemy has
better firing range.

1426
01:13:11,984 --> 01:13:13,027
‐ That is correct,

1427
01:13:13,027 --> 01:13:15,156
but it is not a concern of ours.

1428
01:13:15,156 --> 01:13:16,785
While our firepower is inferior

1429
01:13:16,785 --> 01:13:18,079
to the Federation's,

1430
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:21,085
our fleet's Musai class has
excellent hit deflection

1431
01:13:21,085 --> 01:13:23,089
due to its smaller
cross section,

1432
01:13:23,089 --> 01:13:24,676
and the maneuverability
from the placement

1433
01:13:24,676 --> 01:13:26,262
of its thruster nozzles

1434
01:13:26,262 --> 01:13:27,932
allows it to easily
take evasive‐‐

[yelling]

1436
01:13:29,978 --> 01:13:31,523
‐ What was‐‐

1437
01:13:31,523 --> 01:13:33,819
‐ One of our ships was hit.

1438
01:13:33,819 --> 01:13:35,071
Looks like it was a direct hit.

1439
01:13:35,071 --> 01:13:36,575
‐ Whose ship?

1440
01:13:36,575 --> 01:13:38,494
It wasn't Dozle's Valkyrie,
was it?

1441
01:13:38,494 --> 01:13:40,081
‐ [Officer] Uh, no, sir.

1442
01:13:40,081 --> 01:13:42,461
‐ But a hit is still a hit,

1443
01:13:42,461 --> 01:13:46,052
and what was that about
maneuverability, huh?

1444
01:13:46,052 --> 01:13:48,306
You said it had great
hit deflection.

1445
01:13:48,306 --> 01:13:49,642
The battle's only just begun,

1446
01:13:49,642 --> 01:13:51,688
and one of our ships has been
destroyed already‐‐

‐ Garman.

1448

You are embarrassing yourself.

1449
01:13:56,030 --> 01:13:57,784
Calm down right now.

Heavily damaged‐‐

our advanced fleet

1454
01:14:24,044 --> 01:14:25,046
that we've lost.

1455
01:14:25,046 --> 01:14:26,340
‐ [Man] Seltovic,
engines offline.

1456
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:28,971
‐ [Man] Proton and Amagie both
appear to have been hit.

1457
01:14:28,971 --> 01:14:31,225
‐ [Man] [murmuring] Has given
the order to abandon ship.

1458
01:14:31,225 --> 01:14:34,983
‐ Okay, we're going to be
altering our formation.

1459
01:14:34,983 --> 01:14:36,903
Inform the rest of the fleet.

1460
01:14:36,903 --> 01:14:38,448
Do not panic.

1461
01:14:38,448 --> 01:14:41,036
Disperse and change heading
while returning fire.

1462
01:14:41,036 --> 01:14:43,291
From here on out,
it's do or die.

Now get on with it.

01:15:07,297 --> 01:15:08,967
those Zeon bastards.

1469
01:15:09,761 --> 01:15:12,517
[weapons firing]

1470
01:15:13,392 --> 01:15:17,234
[dramatic instrumental music]

1471
01:15:37,232 --> 01:15:39,111
‐ Excuse me, the Tianum
fleet has begun

1472
01:15:39,111 --> 01:15:41,198
to engage the enemy, sir.

1473
01:15:47,502 --> 01:15:49,172
[laughing]

1474
01:15:49,172 --> 01:15:52,972
[dramatic instrumental music]

1475
01:16:03,952 --> 01:16:04,912
‐ [Char] I'm launching.

1476
01:16:04,912 --> 01:16:06,498
Open the hatch.

1477
01:16:06,498 --> 01:16:07,627
‐ [Dren] I think it's
best you wait

1478
01:16:07,627 --> 01:16:10,381
until the captain gives the
order, Lieutenant Char.

1479
01:16:10,381 --> 01:16:12,010
‐ I'll remind you that I'm
the one in charge

1480
01:16:12,010 --> 01:16:14,682
of the attack team, Ensign Dren.

1481
01:16:16,268 --> 01:16:17,688
I'm going in ahead.

1482
01:16:17,688 --> 01:16:20,485
Dena, take command of the
team and follow me.

1483
01:16:20,485 --> 01:16:21,403
Can you do that?

1484
01:16:21,403 --> 01:16:22,782
‐ [Dena] On it, sir.

1485
01:16:22,782 --> 01:16:25,036
‐ Man, oh man, looks like
being teamed up

1486
01:16:25,036 --> 01:16:26,706
with the winner of
the Zeon Cross

1487
01:16:26,706 --> 01:16:28,669
is gonna be bad for our health,
sir.

1488
01:16:28,669 --> 01:16:30,213
‐ Initiate launch.

1489
01:16:30,213 --> 01:16:32,008
‐ Okay, bosun, can you confirm

1490
01:16:32,008 --> 01:16:33,762
that he has clearance?

1491
01:16:33,762 --> 01:16:36,058
‐ Launch procedures are a go.

1492
01:16:36,058 --> 01:16:39,899

[rocket engines firing]

1494
01:17:01,568 --> 01:17:05,408
‐ [Dren] All units, proceed to
combat area at full speed.

1495
01:17:05,408 --> 01:17:06,870
‐ Just like we practiced.

1496
01:17:06,870 --> 01:17:08,164
‐ And don't fall behind.

1497
01:17:08,164 --> 01:17:10,669
‐ You're gonna form up on me.

1498
01:17:10,669 --> 01:17:14,092
[rocket engines running]

1499
01:17:14,092 --> 01:17:16,221

[electronic beeping]

1506
01:18:24,692 --> 01:18:25,652
‐ There it is.

1507
01:18:25,652 --> 01:18:27,363
I found their main force.

1508
01:18:27,363 --> 01:18:31,204
[dramatic instrumental music]

1509
01:18:40,014 --> 01:18:42,937
I'm changing the
course of history.

1510
01:18:45,859 --> 01:18:48,531
[alarm beeping]

1511
01:18:50,702 --> 01:18:54,794
Be amazed at what I am capable
of, oh mighty one.

1512
01:19:05,231 --> 01:19:08,905
[gentle instrumental music]
