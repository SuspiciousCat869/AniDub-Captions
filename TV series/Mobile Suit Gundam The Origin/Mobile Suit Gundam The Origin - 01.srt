Read it and see what you think,

It’s wrong...

Right now, this is simply a
demand for greater autonomy!

That’s not what I want!

59
00:03:46,691 --> 00:03:48,971
This speech is to be a
declaration of war

Lie down for a while, and‐ ‐

You expect me to sleep at a
time like this?

If I am asleep, how will I be
able to rouse my disciples?

Astraia, I’m running
out of time.

00:04:15,691 --> 00:04:18,891
They’ll drag me away to Golgotha
tomorrow to be executed.

69
00:04:20,611 --> 00:04:25,131
And when they do so, I will
address
the world from atop my cross.

I will warn them that

hellfire and be annihilated!

The medical staff did all they
could, but it was too late.

words to me were:

“Please look after Astraia

Deikun's death has yet to be
announced to the public!

Sasro, had a hand in it!

Wow, it's Deikun's family!

159
00:10:51,332 --> 00:10:52,452
It's Astraia!

160
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:55,052
It's Casval! Artesia, too!

161
00:10:55,052 --> 00:10:56,812
That is enough!

162
00:10:56,812 --> 00:10:59,012
I'm going to gun you down
if you don’t move!

163
00:11:03,812 --> 00:11:07,372
You seem to be in a bit of
trouble, aren’t you Capt. Ral?

164
00:11:08,332 --> 00:11:10,012
Kycilia Zabi...

165
00:11:10,492 --> 00:11:12,092
May I be of assistance?

166
00:11:12,092 --> 00:11:14,092
You won't have to pay me back.

167
00:11:47,012 --> 00:11:49,132
[ASTRAIA:] You're Miss Kycilia,
aren't you?

168
00:11:49,132 --> 00:11:51,412
Yes. Is everyone all right?

169
00:11:51,412 --> 00:11:55,652
Yes, thank you. Goodness, you
make quite the dashing figure.

170
00:11:55,652 --> 00:11:58,852
Considering that I’m a woman,
is that what you meant to say?

171
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:02,612
It’s a quality all Zabi’s have.
Runs in the family.

172
00:12:06,052 --> 00:12:09,172
[SASRO:] So you let them
slip through your fingers?!

173
00:12:09,172 --> 00:12:11,772
Yes. I thought it would be
childish and petty

174
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:14,572
to squabble with Ramba Ral
over those three.

175
00:12:14,972 --> 00:12:16,692
You allowed him to
snatch Deikun's

176
00:12:16,692 --> 00:12:19,132
orphaned children from
under your nose!

177
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,572
[SASRO] You fool!

178
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:27,452
C’mon, Sasro!

179
00:12:27,452 --> 00:12:28,892
You didn't have to hit her!

180
00:12:28,892 --> 00:12:31,332
I don’t want to hear a
single word out of you!

181
00:12:31,332 --> 00:12:33,052
Just when my strategic leaks

182
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:34,972
was starting to make everyone

00:12:34,972 --> 00:12:38,132
was a Federation assassination
were beginning to work!

You had to go and fall for
that old fool's scheme!

185
00:12:41,772 --> 00:12:44,772
Then elimination is
our only option.

186
00:12:45,612 --> 00:12:48,972
I am referring to the
doddering old fool.

187
00:12:48,972 --> 00:12:50,332
Meaning what?

188
00:12:50,772 --> 00:12:55,052
[GIHREN:] We deliver the final
blow to the Ral family. Once
and for all.

[PREACHER:] Zeon Zum Deikun.

190
00:13:29,545 --> 00:13:35,412
He was embodiment of our ideals
and leader of glorious Munzo.

191
00:13:35,412 --> 00:13:38,318
As chairman of the
Munzo Assembly,

192
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:41,930
he was a pioneer for
Spacenoid liberation,

193
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:45,410
and now, as he ascends
into the heavens,

194
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:49,772
he is becoming the very
cornerstone of that ideal.

195
00:13:49,772 --> 00:13:56,932
As we bid farewell, may his soul
be at rest and inspire eternal
justice.

196
00:13:56,932 --> 00:13:59,532
May his ideals live forever.

197
00:13:59,532 --> 00:14:02,107
Though his flesh may
be no longer,

198
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:07,332
may he cast his light upon our
path and show us
the way to salvation.

199
00:14:07,332 --> 00:14:09,332
Sieg Zeon.

200
00:14:33,052 --> 00:14:36,492
Sasro, don’t you think
you went too far?

201
00:14:36,492 --> 00:14:38,892
What? You mean Kycilia?

202
00:14:38,892 --> 00:14:42,172
Sure. You didn't really have
to go and slap her, did you?

203
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,172
I was showing restraint!

204
00:14:44,172 --> 00:14:46,692
She's been getting too full
of herself lately!

205
00:14:47,772 --> 00:14:49,105
Well, you may be right there.

206
00:14:49,105 --> 00:14:52,412
But we're family, so we ought to
at least make some effort to get
along.

207
00:14:52,412 --> 00:14:53,692
Dozle!

208
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:56,732
Get rid of that soft heart of
yours,
it doesn’t become you!

209
00:14:56,732 --> 00:15:00,412
Listen! The political situation
is
on the verge of a bloodbath!

210

Sasro were in, it —

Calm yourself down! Do
not be rattled!

Are you a Zabi or aren't you?!

216

[SOLDIERS:] We have
to put it out!

You bastards
murdered my brother!

219
00:15:41,132 --> 00:15:44,372
Which one of you is
responsible for this?

220
00:15:46,892 --> 00:15:48,852
I’m gonna hunt you down!

221
00:15:49,212 --> 00:15:50,612
[DOZLE:] Gonna make you pay!

222
00:15:50,612 --> 00:15:53,372
Tell me who did this!

223
00:15:55,852 --> 00:15:57,260
[NEWSCASTER:] One of the cars

224
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,932
in Zeon Zum Deikun's funeral
procession exploded today,

225
00:15:59,932 --> 00:16:03,092
killing Sasro Zabi, who was
among its passengers.

226
00:16:03,092 --> 00:16:07,092
His brother, Dozle Zabi
miraculously escaped
any life‐threatening injuries.

227
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:09,412
[MR RAL:] Lies, all lies!

228
00:16:09,412 --> 00:16:13,092
The stinking media, they’re
always doing the Zabis'
bidding, damnit!

229
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,412
This is all part of
Degwin's plot!

230
00:16:15,412 --> 00:16:17,572
He's trying to
distract the public

231
00:16:17,572 --> 00:16:20,092
from Deikun's assassination
by killing his own son

232
00:16:20,092 --> 00:16:22,732
and making it look like we
were behind it!

233
00:16:23,252 --> 00:16:25,092
Seriously, Dad?

234
00:16:25,092 --> 00:16:27,732
Excuse me? What do you
mean by that?

235
00:16:27,732 --> 00:16:29,492
Do you suspect me, too?!

236
00:16:29,652 --> 00:16:31,052
C’mon, I’d never do that.

237
00:16:31,052 --> 00:16:34,252
But do you think he’d kill
his son for that reason?

238
00:16:34,252 --> 00:16:37,612
Even though I never liked
Sasro, he was good at his job,

239
00:16:37,612 --> 00:16:39,732
and the other Zabis thought
very highly of him.

240
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,052
[BUTLER:] Mr. Ramba.

241
00:16:41,532 --> 00:16:44,012
My apologies, but Astraia
is asking for you.

00:16:44,532 --> 00:16:45,612

[CROWD:] Get out here, old man!
Murderer!

00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,612
You kidnapped Deikun's family!

That's dirty, you old geezer!

You're a disgrace to

You’re a traitor!

Of course you do!

But I ask that you wait a
little longer...

That’s not why she’s crying,
Captain.

255

It’s because...

Little Lucifer is all
alone right now.

He’s a cat, then?

261
00:17:49,852 --> 00:17:52,932
Lucifer can get really
scared and lonely.

262
00:17:52,932 --> 00:17:55,972
He can't fall asleep
unless I hold him,

00:17:56,732 --> 00:18:00,572
and he can't even go potty
unless I’m there to help him!

Don’t you worry! I know
what must be done!

bring him to you!

Yes, I’m giving you my word.

The Rals are ruined,

You're right, Ramba Ral
is a good man.

In fact, if he wasn't a Ral, I'd
want to
have him serving under me.

Then provide them

00:20:39,452 --> 00:20:43,212
Deikun and Jimba Ral are
both men of the past.

313
00:20:43,412 --> 00:20:48,092
The Zabi family will shoulder
the responsibility of history to
come.

314
00:21:01,612 --> 00:21:03,452
[ANGRY MOB:] Hold it
right there, pal!

315
00:21:03,452 --> 00:21:05,252
Which side are you on?!

316
00:21:05,252 --> 00:21:07,772
You’re not a Ral loyalist,
are ‘ya?

317
00:21:10,972 --> 00:21:12,492
Disgusting!

318
00:21:12,852 --> 00:21:16,372
What kind of cheap slop is
this guy drinking?!

319
00:21:16,732 --> 00:21:18,652
[MOB:] You’re two sheets to the
wind, and you're after a third?

320
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,652
Do you even know what today is,
Pops?!

321
00:21:21,692 --> 00:21:25,172
You can’t go in! The bar is
already closed for the night‐‐

322
00:21:28,212 --> 00:21:30,892
Captain Ral? Is that you?!

323
00:21:31,372 --> 00:21:33,412
Will you keep your voice down,
Lt....

324
00:21:33,412 --> 00:21:35,652
Tachi, that’s your name,
isn’t it?

325
00:21:35,652 --> 00:21:39,012
You moonlight as a club
bouncer or something?

326
00:21:39,012 --> 00:21:40,262
N‐No, that’s not it, sir!

327
00:21:40,262 --> 00:21:43,412
Things looked pretty bad out
there,
so I thought it my duty to help!

328
00:21:43,412 --> 00:21:44,692
You gotta believe me!

329
00:21:44,692 --> 00:21:47,812
Please! Wait a second, I'm
begging you Captain!

330
00:21:48,012 --> 00:21:50,812
Please don't drag her into
any dangerous situations!

331
00:21:50,812 --> 00:21:51,748
Just leave her be!

332
00:21:51,748 --> 00:21:54,972
Leave her alone, so she can live
a nice, quiet, ordinary life.

333
00:21:54,972 --> 00:21:56,972
Hasn’t she helped you enough?

334
00:21:56,972 --> 00:21:59,532
Stand down, Lieutenant.
That’s an order.

335
00:21:59,932 --> 00:22:01,412
Mind your own business and don't

336
00:22:01,412 --> 00:22:03,612
stick your nose in what
I'm about to do!

337
00:22:07,532 --> 00:22:09,652
Hey, good to see you, Captain!

338
00:22:09,652 --> 00:22:10,672
Hey there, Clamp.

339
00:22:10,672 --> 00:22:14,212
You look more at home behind
that bar every time I see you.

340
00:22:14,212 --> 00:22:17,772
How about it? So when you
coming back to the military?

341
00:22:17,772 --> 00:22:19,532
The military? Fat chance.

342
00:22:19,532 --> 00:22:22,772
My days of being a
Federation lackey are over.

343
00:22:22,772 --> 00:22:28,092
Captain, if you ever need me for
anything, just say the word
and I'll come running.

344
00:22:28,092 --> 00:22:29,292
Hamon!

345
00:22:29,292 --> 00:22:30,732
You've been requested!

346
00:22:35,972 --> 00:22:37,332
Follow me.

347
00:22:37,412 --> 00:22:39,572
[HAMON:] Bartender, we don’t
want to be disturbed.

348
00:22:41,812 --> 00:22:45,932
[HAMON:] Goodness, your disguise
today is even more elaborate
than usual.

349
00:22:48,652 --> 00:22:50,252
You didn’t get it all, you know.

350
00:22:50,732 --> 00:22:55,292
That’s because it isn't makeup.
That little devil got me real
good.

351
00:22:56,052 --> 00:22:58,612
You’ve been out
gallivanting now?

352
00:22:58,612 --> 00:23:00,812
What's this latest
conquest like?

353
00:23:01,732 --> 00:23:03,012
A raven‐haired...

354
00:23:10,012 --> 00:23:12,212
...nimble little
pain in the ass!

355
00:23:14,492 --> 00:23:17,972
Sorry, but I’m gonna need
another favor from you, Hamon.

356
00:23:19,332 --> 00:23:22,852
I need to smuggle someone,
I need to smuggle ‘em to Earth.

357
00:23:23,332 --> 00:23:26,012
Let me guess: your father,
Jimba Ral?

358
00:23:26,012 --> 00:23:28,372
You catch on quick,
same as ever.

359
00:23:28,372 --> 00:23:32,652
Because of what happened to
Sasro, the old man has a target
on his back.

360
00:23:32,652 --> 00:23:37,252
I couldn't live with myself if
he ended up falling into the
Zabis' hands.

361
00:23:37,412 --> 00:23:39,092
They’re probably
targeting you to.

362
00:23:39,092 --> 00:23:41,052
Yeah, but I can handle myself.

363
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:44,412
I'm confident I can find
something to hold over them.

364
00:23:45,492 --> 00:23:48,692
So your father... will he be
the only one going?

365
00:23:48,692 --> 00:23:50,092
About that...

366
00:23:50,092 --> 00:23:53,852
There's a chance he might be
traveling
with even peskier passengers.

367
00:23:53,852 --> 00:23:54,852
Do tell?

368
00:23:54,852 --> 00:23:58,692
Don't be coy. I’m guessing
you’ve already figured it out.

369
00:24:00,412 --> 00:24:04,252
Let me think...if I use my
connections at the Port
Authority,

370
00:24:04,252 --> 00:24:05,812
I guess I can manage!

371
00:24:05,812 --> 00:24:07,492
I can always count on you!

372
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:11,372
‐ I noticed that lieutenant is
here again.
‐ [HAMON:] Yep

373
00:24:11,372 --> 00:24:15,212
You really shouldn't string that
poor guy along. He’s too naive.

374
00:24:15,212 --> 00:24:18,852
Now that you mention it, he's
stationed at the docking bay!

375
00:24:18,852 --> 00:24:20,852
So he might prove to be
quite useful!

376
00:24:22,172 --> 00:24:23,572
That guy?

377
00:24:33,692 --> 00:24:35,568
[ASTRAIA:] Those poor children.

378
00:24:35,568 --> 00:24:38,172
Why were they fated to be
Deikun's progeny?

379
00:24:44,132 --> 00:24:45,052
[SOLDIERS:] Halt!

380
00:24:50,692 --> 00:24:52,532
Don't come any closer!

381
00:24:52,892 --> 00:24:55,012
Take another step,
and we'll fire!

382
00:24:55,012 --> 00:24:57,012
[KYCILIA:] Go ahead and try,
I dare you!

383
00:24:57,812 --> 00:25:00,418
Security Police
commander Kycilia Zabi.

384
00:25:00,418 --> 00:25:03,292
I’m here on a special,
classified errand!

385
00:25:03,292 --> 00:25:04,758
[SOLDIERS:] It doesn’t matter!

386
00:25:04,758 --> 00:25:07,372
Mr. Jimba Ral will not see any
member of the Zabi family!

387
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:12,772
Lucky for me! I have no use for
Jimba Ral and did not come
here to see him!

388
00:25:12,772 --> 00:25:18,652
On behalf of Degwin Zabi, the
new chairman, I wish to speak
with Casval Rem Deikun!

389
00:25:19,372 --> 00:25:22,212
[MR. RAL:] With Casval?!
Over my dead body!

390
00:25:22,212 --> 00:25:24,492
What, you already let her in?!

391
00:25:24,492 --> 00:25:26,132
You’re all idiots!

392
00:25:26,132 --> 00:25:27,332
Where is Ramba?!

393
00:25:27,332 --> 00:25:30,372
Don’t tell me he’s out
drinking again?!

394
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:32,492
That selfish waste of a son!

395
00:25:32,492 --> 00:25:34,852
This is not the time to
be traipsing around town!

396
00:25:35,852 --> 00:25:37,532
I will meet with the woman.

397
00:25:39,532 --> 00:25:42,612
If the woman happens to be
Kycilia, I know her.

398
00:25:42,612 --> 00:25:44,292
[CASVAL:] Tall and overbearing.

399
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:48,812
Don’t worry, I’m not intimidated
by
those who murdered my father.

400
00:25:48,812 --> 00:25:50,252
Zabis don’t scare me.

401
00:25:56,612 --> 00:25:59,612
My apologies, I must
have awoken you.

402
00:25:59,852 --> 00:26:03,852
You must think it rude of me to
call on you so late in the
evening.

403
00:26:04,812 --> 00:26:07,452
However, there’s something
important to discuss.

404
00:26:07,452 --> 00:26:09,892
It’s something only you
and I can do.

405
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:14,732
At this very moment, there are
fights and riots all over the
city,

406
00:26:14,732 --> 00:26:17,292
and many people have been
injured or even killed.

407
00:26:17,532 --> 00:26:20,092
How did this situation
come to pass?

408
00:26:20,092 --> 00:26:23,772
It is because your host, Jimba
Ral, murdered my brother.

409
00:26:23,772 --> 00:26:26,212
And why is it Sasro
was murdered?

410
00:26:26,212 --> 00:26:29,212
Because your family
decided to take refuge here.

411
00:26:29,772 --> 00:26:31,612
That’s one way to look at it.

412
00:26:31,612 --> 00:26:33,292
Or you could say all this began

413
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:35,652
when your family
murdered my father.

414
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,732
And where did you hear that,
I wonder?

415
00:26:39,732 --> 00:26:42,492
From your mother? No,
probably not.

416
00:26:42,492 --> 00:26:45,572
I bet it was Jimba Ral who
put that idea in your head.

417
00:26:45,572 --> 00:26:46,732
Miss Kycilia.

418
00:26:46,732 --> 00:26:48,052
I thought you said you wanted

419
00:26:48,052 --> 00:26:49,732
to discuss something
important with me.

420
00:26:50,932 --> 00:26:53,892
If all you are going to do is
scold me like some little child,

421
00:26:53,892 --> 00:26:56,052
I will pass, thank
you very much!

422
00:26:56,812 --> 00:26:58,772
I'm going back to my room.

423
00:26:58,772 --> 00:27:01,372
I’m sorry, no offense was meant.

424
00:27:01,572 --> 00:27:04,132
Let us return to our discussion,
then.

425
00:27:04,132 --> 00:27:05,972
I have a proposal.

426
00:27:06,332 --> 00:27:07,252
Go on.

427
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:09,532
I hear you have quite
a nice home.

428
00:27:09,532 --> 00:27:13,652
A big mansion tailored
especially for the Deikun
family.

429
00:27:13,652 --> 00:27:14,812
[KYCILIA:] Go back home.

430
00:27:14,812 --> 00:27:16,652
Just you, your mother,
and sister.

431
00:27:16,652 --> 00:27:19,132
And there will be no
retaliation for Sasro.

432
00:27:19,372 --> 00:27:22,052
Additionally, we’ll do our
best to calm the public.

433
00:27:22,052 --> 00:27:24,612
Don’t do it, don’t
listen to her!

434
00:27:24,612 --> 00:27:26,452
Can’t you see it’s a trap!

435
00:27:26,452 --> 00:27:30,812
If the three of them leave here,
they’ll slaughter every one of
my family!

436
00:27:30,812 --> 00:27:33,452
Let go of me! I have to
get in there!

437
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:34,812
Hey, where did Casval go?

438
00:27:34,812 --> 00:27:37,667
If you are truly prepared to
give me your word,

439
00:27:37,667 --> 00:27:39,612
then my family will return home.

440
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:42,492
However...

441
00:27:43,332 --> 00:27:44,372
However?

442
00:27:44,372 --> 00:27:46,972
You say you're willing to
overlook
what happened to Sasro.

443
00:27:46,972 --> 00:27:48,012
That may be.

444
00:27:48,012 --> 00:27:50,492
But what about the fact that
you murdered my father?!

445
00:27:50,492 --> 00:27:52,572
I will never be able to
overlook that!

446
00:27:52,572 --> 00:27:53,612
Not ever!

447
00:27:53,612 --> 00:27:55,972
I have had enough of
your insolence!

448
00:28:01,732 --> 00:28:03,572
It sounds like they’re fighting!

449
00:28:06,652 --> 00:28:08,252
It's gone quiet now.

450
00:28:10,012 --> 00:28:12,172
No! Casval's in danger!

451
00:28:12,172 --> 00:28:13,492
Open the door!

452
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:16,212
Wait! I think I can
hear something!

453
00:28:16,492 --> 00:28:18,692
[BUTLER:] It sounds
like talking!

454
00:28:24,852 --> 00:28:27,052
I expected you to yell.

455
00:28:27,852 --> 00:28:30,452
I wonder why you’re
being so quiet?

456
00:28:30,452 --> 00:28:33,892
You know you’re more than
welcome to cry out for help.

457
00:28:33,892 --> 00:28:36,572
Or perhaps you simply
aren't afraid of me?

458
00:28:38,612 --> 00:28:40,412
You may be under the
impression that

459
00:28:40,412 --> 00:28:42,652
because of your pedigree, no
one will harm you.

460
00:28:42,652 --> 00:28:45,132
Rest assured that you are wrong,
little lord.

461
00:28:50,452 --> 00:28:51,572
I can even throw you in
jail and call you a criminal
if I want.

462
00:28:51,572 --> 00:28:54,572
I have full authority to cuff
you, don’t you know?

463
00:28:54,572 --> 00:28:58,932
I can even throw you in jail
and call you a criminal if I
want.

464
00:28:58,932 --> 00:29:00,932
Are you afraid now?

465
00:29:00,932 --> 00:29:03,292
C’mon, say that you're afraid!

466
00:29:03,892 --> 00:29:05,532
I'm Deikun's son.

467
00:29:05,532 --> 00:29:07,772
So no, I’m not afraid of you.

468
00:29:07,772 --> 00:29:10,652
And nobody is allowed to
put me in chains.

469
00:29:10,652 --> 00:29:14,132
Degwin Zabi is the most
powerful man in this nation!

470
00:29:14,132 --> 00:29:17,332
If Degwin orders it, I can do
more than chain you!

471
00:29:17,452 --> 00:29:19,292
So? Who cares?

472
00:29:19,292 --> 00:29:21,732
I am still Zeon Zum
Deikun’s son.

473
00:29:22,492 --> 00:29:23,432
When I grow up,

474
00:29:23,432 --> 00:29:27,572
I’ll make Degwin and the rest of
your
family bow down before me!

475
00:29:27,572 --> 00:29:30,372
Casval Rem Deikun is
giving you an order!

476
00:29:30,372 --> 00:29:32,132
Take these off me!

477
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:39,935
[KYCILIA:] I have to admit,
Casval is quite formidable.

478
00:29:43,775 --> 00:29:46,055
I pressed him hard to
test his limits,

479
00:29:46,055 --> 00:29:49,535
but not only was he unafraid of
me, he even threatened me.

480
00:29:49,535 --> 00:29:53,695
He may be only 11 like our
Garma, but he is not a child.

481
00:29:53,695 --> 00:29:57,590
If you intend to create a Zabi
dynasty that will last a
millennium,

482
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,335
you must address this problem!

483
00:29:59,695 --> 00:30:00,708
I beg your pardon?

484
00:30:00,708 --> 00:30:04,255
That almost sounded as if you
were
giving me an order, Kycilia.

485
00:30:04,255 --> 00:30:05,856
No, I wouldn't dream of it.

486
00:30:06,025 --> 00:30:09,375
I was just trying to make
amends for my previous
mistake.

487
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:12,255
I've already given that specific
matter plenty of thought.

488
00:30:12,255 --> 00:30:14,135
No need for you to interfere!

489
00:30:17,255 --> 00:30:20,015
But now that’s Sasro’s no
longer with us —

490
00:30:20,015 --> 00:30:22,735
I should let you be the
mastermind, is that it?

491
00:30:22,735 --> 00:30:24,015
Don't make me laugh.

492
00:30:24,015 --> 00:30:25,895
Stop worrying about the boy.

493
00:30:25,895 --> 00:30:29,015
Instead, I suggest you pray
for Sasro's soul.

494
00:30:35,495 --> 00:30:38,495
Chairman's Residence

495
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:54,935
Oh, I had no idea that you’d
be here, Madam Roselucia.

496
00:30:55,255 --> 00:30:56,655
Why wouldn’t I be?

497
00:30:56,655 --> 00:30:59,695
I mean, this is my home,
after all.

498
00:31:00,935 --> 00:31:03,975
Yes. Of course, I haven’t
forgotten that.

499
00:31:04,215 --> 00:31:06,735
It's too noisy for us to
talk out here.

500
00:31:06,735 --> 00:31:10,055
But you and I need to have
a nice long chat.

501
00:31:10,295 --> 00:31:12,535
Stop by my room when
you’re settled.

502
00:31:13,575 --> 00:31:15,175
And come alone!

503
00:31:20,855 --> 00:31:23,735
Listen. You’ll relocate
to the tower.

504
00:31:25,335 --> 00:31:26,815
Yes, ma’am.

505
00:31:26,815 --> 00:31:28,935
[ROSELUCIA:] The tower
is not so bad.

506
00:31:28,935 --> 00:31:33,055
Aside from it being somewhat
more cramped and lonelier
than it is here.

507
00:31:33,055 --> 00:31:37,255
Did you know that it was
originally built
as a place for contemplation?

508
00:31:37,255 --> 00:31:43,175
Who knows how many seeds of
Deikun's grand ideas were
sewed from within its walls?

509
00:31:43,175 --> 00:31:46,775
All the emotions that we
2nd‐generation emigrants felt

510
00:31:46,775 --> 00:31:49,615
permeate the rooms of that
desolate tower.

511
00:31:49,615 --> 00:31:52,895
Our suffering, our sadness,
our hopes.

512
00:31:52,895 --> 00:31:54,895
And our dark resentment.

513
00:31:57,535 --> 00:31:59,495
How fortunate you are.

514
00:31:59,495 --> 00:32:03,295
After all, you had the privilege
of bearing Deikun's children.

515
00:32:05,055 --> 00:32:09,495
You were a merely nightclub
singer
who used your feminine wiles.

516
00:32:10,255 --> 00:32:12,615
I beg your pardon,
Madam Roselucia,

517
00:32:12,615 --> 00:32:16,415
But I have raised both Casval
and Artesia into fine young
children.

518
00:32:16,415 --> 00:32:18,335
Ones who will do
Deikun's name proud

519
00:32:18,335 --> 00:32:20,135
when they follow in
his footsteps!

520
00:32:21,495 --> 00:32:24,415
When did you become so haughty?

521
00:32:24,415 --> 00:32:26,175
All right, then! Tell me this!

522
00:32:26,175 --> 00:32:29,095
What does the reformation
of humanity refer to?!

523
00:32:30,295 --> 00:32:31,975
Go on, answer me!

524
00:32:31,975 --> 00:32:34,695
How exactly have
Spacenoids evolved, huh?

525
00:32:34,695 --> 00:32:37,135
How are they different
from Earthnoids?!

526
00:32:37,135 --> 00:32:40,415
Why is it that man must not
continue living on Earth?!

527
00:32:41,535 --> 00:32:43,055
You can't answer can you?

528
00:32:43,495 --> 00:32:46,335
As if someone like you could
ever understand!

529
00:32:47,135 --> 00:32:51,455
When we were young, we often
gather around Deikun and
engage in debate.

530
00:32:52,655 --> 00:32:55,015
I miss those days so much...

531
00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:58,015
I was willing to do
anything Deikun asked!

532
00:32:58,015 --> 00:33:01,495
The only thing I could not
do was give him children!

533
00:33:01,495 --> 00:33:03,135
But why should it have mattered?

534
00:33:03,135 --> 00:33:04,815
It’s only children!

535
00:33:04,815 --> 00:33:07,455
And just because I couldn't
bear him any children,

536
00:33:07,455 --> 00:33:09,815
does that mean someone of
my stature and breeding

537
00:33:09,815 --> 00:33:13,135
should have to lose out to a
pathetic little whore like you?!

538
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,855
Someone...

539
00:33:22,015 --> 00:33:24,135
Madam Roselucia! Hold on!

540
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:27,415
Calm down! Take slow breaths!

541
00:33:27,415 --> 00:33:29,935
I’ve got your medicine! Here,
take it!

542
00:33:40,095 --> 00:33:42,198
Um, Madam Roselucia...

543
00:33:42,198 --> 00:33:45,255
about relocating to the tower...

544
00:33:45,255 --> 00:33:47,455
Will the children be
joining me there?

545
00:33:48,815 --> 00:33:53,575
[ROSELUCIA:] I can't very well
send the heirs of the Deikun
family to live there.

546
00:33:53,575 --> 00:33:55,695
Not in a place like that.

547
00:33:55,695 --> 00:33:58,135
But as a token of my
generous nature,

548
00:33:58,135 --> 00:34:00,775
they may spend this one
night with you.

549
00:34:00,775 --> 00:34:04,095
You may consider it a
special parting gift.

550
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:11,775
What the hell happened here?

551
00:34:14,895 --> 00:34:16,735
And what happened to
our security?!

552
00:34:17,335 --> 00:34:20,055
Where is the butler?
Where is everyone?

553
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:22,055
Damn it.

554
00:34:23,015 --> 00:34:26,055
I guess they all left in a hurry
once the tide started changing.

555
00:34:26,615 --> 00:34:27,815
[MESSENGER:] Mr. Ral.

556
00:34:28,655 --> 00:34:30,015
There’s a message for you.

557
00:34:32,295 --> 00:34:33,415
What?

558
00:34:33,415 --> 00:34:35,735
“Astraia was exiled
to the tower.”

559
00:34:35,735 --> 00:34:37,415
“This is the family’s last
night together.”

560
00:34:37,415 --> 00:34:39,535
“We must act, it’s
now or never?”

561
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,735
Where’d this come from?
Who sent it?

562
00:34:41,735 --> 00:34:44,455
It was a fine little bit of
sleuthing, yeah?

563
00:34:44,455 --> 00:34:46,455
Hamon, it was you?

564
00:34:46,455 --> 00:34:48,455
That was a terrible joke.

565
00:34:48,455 --> 00:34:50,935
[HAMON:] In all seriousness,
that intel is no joke.

566
00:34:50,935 --> 00:34:56,295
Once they put her in that tower,
Astraia will be held under
strict house arrest.

567
00:34:56,295 --> 00:34:58,295
Extracting her will
be impossible.

568
00:34:58,295 --> 00:34:59,815
I await your decision.

569
00:35:00,735 --> 00:35:05,695
What are the chances the Zabis
will let the children grow up
and rise to power?

570
00:35:05,695 --> 00:35:06,935
None at all.

571
00:35:06,935 --> 00:35:08,535
I’m 300% sure.

572
00:35:08,975 --> 00:35:11,295
We have to be that sure
we’ll succeed

573
00:35:11,295 --> 00:35:14,015
before we even try to pull
this rescue off.

574
00:35:14,015 --> 00:35:18,455
And you? Will you be able to
transport
them to the docking bay in time?

575
00:35:19,015 --> 00:35:20,335
Don’t you worry.

576
00:35:20,335 --> 00:35:22,735
I have a foolproof
means of delivery.

577
00:35:24,815 --> 00:35:25,815
Hey, dad!

578
00:35:28,095 --> 00:35:29,615
Thank goodness it’s you!

579
00:35:29,615 --> 00:35:33,575
Where have you been?! Look
around! Can’t you see we’re
under attack?

580
00:35:34,015 --> 00:35:36,455
Oh brother. You and
your resistance.

581
00:35:36,455 --> 00:35:39,055
They won't take me down
without a fight!

582
00:35:39,055 --> 00:35:40,335
And if it comes to that,

583
00:35:40,335 --> 00:35:42,335
I’m gonna take Degwin with me!

584
00:35:42,335 --> 00:35:43,695
Never mind all that.

585
00:35:43,695 --> 00:35:46,535
I've already made arrangements
for you to flee to Earth.

586
00:35:47,095 --> 00:35:48,775
What?! You did that?!

587
00:35:48,775 --> 00:35:50,695
I have people taking
care of things,

588
00:35:50,695 --> 00:35:51,935
they’ll be
overseeing everything.

589
00:35:51,935 --> 00:35:53,935
[MR. RAL:] I don’t believe it!
Thank you!

590
00:35:53,935 --> 00:35:55,215
This is wonderful!

591
00:35:55,215 --> 00:35:58,015
You’re the best heir a
father could ask for!

592
00:36:00,495 --> 00:36:01,615
Once you get to Earth,

593
00:36:01,615 --> 00:36:04,135
it's up to you to decide what
to do with yourself.

594
00:36:04,535 --> 00:36:08,415
You can worry about those of
us who are left behind or not.

595
00:36:08,415 --> 00:36:10,335
I guess it doesn’t matter much.

596
00:36:10,815 --> 00:36:12,255
Whatever will happen,

597
00:36:12,255 --> 00:36:15,455
it will happen regardless of
whether you worry about it.

598
00:36:21,215 --> 00:36:23,535
[ARTESIA:] Is this
our new house?

599
00:36:25,535 --> 00:36:27,295
My bed!

600
00:36:28,335 --> 00:36:30,375
This new house, I like it!

601
00:36:30,695 --> 00:36:34,575
It's way better than that other
dumb house with that scary
old witch in it!

602
00:36:34,575 --> 00:36:37,375
The hallways are dark, huh?

603
00:36:38,135 --> 00:36:40,895
And the yard is really
small and dirty.

604
00:36:41,135 --> 00:36:43,775
But we can always clean it
and make it pretty!

605
00:36:43,775 --> 00:36:45,535
Isn’t that right, Momma?

606
00:36:47,655 --> 00:36:50,495
[ASTRAIA:] Artesia, stop running
around, you’ll hurt yourself.

607
00:36:53,415 --> 00:36:56,975
[ARTESIA:] Lucifer! Come here!

608
00:36:56,975 --> 00:36:59,215
[ASTRAIA:] Quiet down and come
over here, Artesia.

609
00:36:59,215 --> 00:37:00,695
And you too, Casval.

610
00:37:01,215 --> 00:37:02,415
Listen carefully.

611
00:37:02,775 --> 00:37:05,695
Mommy has something
very important to tell you.

612
00:37:12,815 --> 00:37:14,015
[ARTESIA:] What?

613
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:17,655
Sshh! We have to keep this
a secret, okay?

614
00:37:18,175 --> 00:37:20,215
[ASTRAIA:] We can’t let
anybody hear us!

615
00:37:20,215 --> 00:37:23,815
If those scary people find out
about this, our lives will be in
danger!

616
00:37:24,695 --> 00:37:28,495
[ARTESIA:] But why aren't you
coming with us, huh?

617
00:37:28,815 --> 00:37:29,855
How come?

618
00:37:30,695 --> 00:37:33,575
I don't wanna, not without you!

619
00:37:33,975 --> 00:37:35,775
No, no, no,

620
00:37:35,775 --> 00:37:36,975
I’m not going to Earth!

621
00:37:36,975 --> 00:37:40,015
If you're not coming, I’m
not going either!

622
00:37:42,255 --> 00:37:46,735
I'm so sorry, Artesia, Mommy
didn’t explain it clearly
enough.

623
00:37:47,695 --> 00:37:49,575
I'm going to join you later.

624
00:37:49,575 --> 00:37:52,695
You see, it’s just that I can't
come with you right now.

625
00:37:54,495 --> 00:37:56,015
Then...how long?

626
00:37:56,015 --> 00:37:57,415
How long, huh?

627
00:37:57,415 --> 00:37:59,415
How long until you come?

628
00:37:59,895 --> 00:38:03,295
If you’re a good little girl
on Earth, then I’ll come.

629
00:38:03,295 --> 00:38:04,695
I don’t wanna wait!

630
00:38:04,695 --> 00:38:06,695
Make me a real promise!

631
00:38:06,695 --> 00:38:08,855
Or I’m not gonna be a good girl!

632
00:38:09,055 --> 00:38:11,215
There, there. I’m sorry, dear.

633
00:38:11,215 --> 00:38:13,215
I have a new idea, okay?

634
00:38:13,215 --> 00:38:16,255
There on Earth, you’ll be
able to see stars in the sky.

635
00:38:16,255 --> 00:38:19,015
[ASTRAIA:] The biggest and
roundest one is the Moon.

636
00:38:19,015 --> 00:38:22,095
I want you to count each time
it shrinks down to half,

637
00:38:22,095 --> 00:38:23,615
gets really skinny,

638
00:38:23,615 --> 00:38:27,095
and then grows to be a round,
full circle again.

639
00:38:27,095 --> 00:38:30,695
After it does that 100 times,
I will come.

640
00:38:30,815 --> 00:38:33,415
So wait for me, all right?
Can you do that?

641
00:38:33,415 --> 00:38:37,415
Is it true? The
Moon... it’ll grow round?

642
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:42,655
Yes that's right. It’ll
do it 100 times.

643
00:38:43,455 --> 00:38:45,215
Can you count that high?

644
00:38:47,135 --> 00:38:54,135
One, two, three, four, five,
six...

645
00:38:54,535 --> 00:38:57,495
[SECURITY:] Miss Astraia! It's
too cold out there!

646
00:38:57,495 --> 00:38:59,135
It’s time you came inside!

647
00:38:59,135 --> 00:39:02,015
It's all fine for you, but
think of the health

648
00:39:02,015 --> 00:39:04,135
‐ [ARTESIA:] ... twelve...
‐ [SECURITY:] of those precious
children!

649
00:39:04,135 --> 00:39:05,535
...thirteen...

650
00:39:13,415 --> 00:39:14,655
A hundred times...

651
00:39:14,655 --> 00:39:19,695
[ARTESIA:] After the Moon grows
round 100 times... don’t forget,
you promised.

652
00:39:24,455 --> 00:39:26,735
[ASTRAIA:] Earth is a
beautiful place.

653
00:39:26,735 --> 00:39:30,295
The sky is blue, and it
has mountains and forests.

654
00:39:30,295 --> 00:39:32,295
[ARTESIA:] We have
forests in Munzo, too.

655
00:39:32,295 --> 00:39:36,015
You’re right, but Earth's
forests are filled with all
sorts of animals.

656
00:39:36,015 --> 00:39:37,655
[ARTESIA:] What
kinds of animals?

657
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:39,455
[ASTRAIA:] It's getting late.

658
00:39:39,455 --> 00:39:40,855
It’s time to go to sleep.

659
00:39:40,855 --> 00:39:42,415
[ARTESIA:] But I want to
talk some more.

660
00:39:43,015 --> 00:39:44,855
Aren't you sleepy, though?

661
00:39:45,815 --> 00:39:48,535
[ARTESIA:] I'm sleepy, but I
don't want to go to sleep.

662
00:39:48,935 --> 00:39:52,695
Because if I do, then it
would be morning.

663
00:39:54,055 --> 00:39:55,495
I hate the morning.

664
00:39:55,495 --> 00:39:57,495
I don't want it to be morning!

665
00:39:57,495 --> 00:40:01,055
I want it to stay tonight
like this forever.

666
00:40:03,055 --> 00:40:06,615
But if that happened, you
wouldn't be
able to see the Moon grow round.

667
00:40:07,535 --> 00:40:09,815
[ARTESIA:] I guess, but...

668
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:15,215
Nothing can stay the way
it is forever.

669
00:40:15,775 --> 00:40:17,735
It’s the same for you, Artesia.

670
00:40:17,735 --> 00:40:19,415
You have to grow up too.

671
00:40:20,815 --> 00:40:22,815
Grow to be a nice girl.

672
00:40:22,815 --> 00:40:25,455
And grow up to be a good person.

673
00:40:26,095 --> 00:40:28,815
Then you can make a lot
of people happy.

674
00:40:28,815 --> 00:40:29,655
Okay?

675
00:40:49,455 --> 00:40:51,135
[SOLDIERS:] Whoa,
what the hell?!

676
00:40:51,135 --> 00:40:52,855
[SOLDIERS:] Halt!
Stop right there!

677
00:40:54,855 --> 00:40:56,935
[HAMON, OVER LOUDSPEAKER:]
I am here to take custody

678
00:40:56,935 --> 00:40:58,655
of the orphaned children of
Zeon Zum Deikun

679
00:40:58,655 --> 00:41:02,335
as a special mission for the
Federation’s Munzo Garrison
Force!

680
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:04,335
Hand them over to me
immediately!

681
00:41:05,775 --> 00:41:07,695
Did you hear
anything about this?

682
00:41:07,695 --> 00:41:08,895
News to me...

683
00:41:08,895 --> 00:41:10,655
Would you like to be
court‐martialed?

684
00:41:10,655 --> 00:41:12,535
Because you are
refusing an order!

685
00:41:12,535 --> 00:41:14,415
[SOLDIERS:] No need
to go that far!

686
00:41:14,415 --> 00:41:15,935
We're calling it in right now!

687
00:41:18,775 --> 00:41:21,775
You’re Miss Artesia and Master
Casval, I take it?

688
00:41:22,175 --> 00:41:24,135
I am here to take you away.

689
00:41:28,295 --> 00:41:30,175
[SOLDIERS:] Somebody check in
with the Federation garrison!

690
00:41:30,175 --> 00:41:32,295
Hurry! What are you waiting for?

691
00:41:33,255 --> 00:41:36,455
Are you Miss Crowley Hamon,
then?

692
00:41:36,455 --> 00:41:39,055
Good, your mother must have
explained it to you.

693
00:41:39,295 --> 00:41:40,055
Let’s go.

694
00:41:42,055 --> 00:41:43,255
All aboard!

695
00:41:45,415 --> 00:41:46,895
Hey, wait a minute!

696
00:41:46,895 --> 00:41:47,815
Is anyone there?

697
00:41:47,815 --> 00:41:49,135
This is an emergency!

698
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,415
[SOLDIERS:] Hello? This is the
chairman's residence!

699
00:41:52,415 --> 00:41:53,815
Hello?! Hello?!

700
00:42:08,935 --> 00:42:10,175
We’re heading back!

701
00:42:10,175 --> 00:42:12,295
Turn 180 degrees!

702
00:42:21,335 --> 00:42:23,375
[SOLDIERS:] Is anyone there?!
Hello?!

703
00:42:36,295 --> 00:42:38,095
Momma!

704
00:43:00,455 --> 00:43:03,055
Get changed into these, okay?

705
00:43:03,055 --> 00:43:06,495
They're a tiny bit old, but be
good and put them on.

706
00:43:07,375 --> 00:43:09,255
Driver! Step on it!

707
00:43:09,255 --> 00:43:11,255
We’ve got some ground to cover!

708
00:43:16,175 --> 00:43:18,295
So, Miss Fake Lieutenant.

709
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:19,655
I think you’re hiding something

710
00:43:19,655 --> 00:43:21,495
about those kids you’re
keeping up there.

711
00:43:21,495 --> 00:43:23,495
And furthermore, we
underestimated

712
00:43:23,495 --> 00:43:25,015
how much this job would cost.

713
00:43:25,015 --> 00:43:29,015
Oh? 20,000,
including fuel costs,

714
00:43:29,015 --> 00:43:30,695
to take us to the cargo center?

715
00:43:30,695 --> 00:43:33,055
Not exactly what I’d
call cheap fare.

716
00:43:37,975 --> 00:43:39,775
I’ll tack on another 10,000!

717
00:43:39,775 --> 00:43:40,975
How does that sound?

718
00:43:40,975 --> 00:43:44,135
I’m afraid we won't accept any
less than double.

719
00:43:44,135 --> 00:43:46,775
If you simply don’t have
the means to pay,

720
00:43:46,775 --> 00:43:48,535
there are other ways.

721
00:43:48,535 --> 00:43:49,855
I’m listening...

722
00:43:49,855 --> 00:43:52,535
With your body, I’m sure
you’ll figure it out.

723
00:43:53,015 --> 00:43:55,175
What do you say, huh?

724
00:43:55,535 --> 00:43:56,655
You pig!

725
00:44:05,135 --> 00:44:06,335
Put that away!

726
00:44:06,535 --> 00:44:09,095
You know what would happen
if you fired a gun inside here,

727
00:44:09,095 --> 00:44:11,455
so I wouldn’t even
think about it.

728
00:44:13,655 --> 00:44:16,375
Now, do what I paid you to do!

729
00:44:17,215 --> 00:44:20,175
What do you mean, a Guntank
barreling through the city?

730
00:44:20,175 --> 00:44:21,535
This is unacceptable!

731
00:44:21,535 --> 00:44:22,735
Give me an update!

732
00:44:22,735 --> 00:44:25,255
[SOLDIER:] Sir, target is
proceeding along the rotation
axis!

733
00:44:25,255 --> 00:44:27,815
There’s a chance it could be
heading for the docking bay!

734
00:44:27,815 --> 00:44:30,295
Then stop it immediately!

735
00:44:39,935 --> 00:44:41,935
Keeping heading straight
down the main street!

736
00:44:41,935 --> 00:44:43,935
I want to take the
shortest route!

737
00:44:48,415 --> 00:44:52,895
[KYCILIA:] What’s that? Someone
in a Federation Guntank took
Casval and Artesia?!

738
00:45:00,335 --> 00:45:02,655
No way! It can’t be!

739
00:45:08,255 --> 00:45:11,415
Captain Ral, Miss Hamon was
successful in her mission!

740
00:45:11,415 --> 00:45:15,935
She's something else. Too bad
you
guys aren’t all more like her.

741
00:45:15,935 --> 00:45:16,655
All right.

742
00:45:16,655 --> 00:45:18,655
That means we’re up next.

743
00:45:27,335 --> 00:45:30,015
Hey! Watch where you're going,
dammit!

744
00:45:30,015 --> 00:45:31,735
Goodness, I'm so sorry!

745
00:45:31,735 --> 00:45:33,735
Okay, back it up!

746
00:45:33,735 --> 00:45:35,935
Huh? What’s that? A flat?

747
00:45:35,935 --> 00:45:37,575
What bad luck!

748
00:45:38,775 --> 00:45:39,975
Just change it!

749
00:45:39,975 --> 00:45:41,695
Or I'll run you over!

750
00:45:43,335 --> 00:45:44,615
What are you doing?!

751
00:45:44,615 --> 00:45:47,095
I don’t have all day!
Hurry it up!

752
00:45:47,575 --> 00:45:49,415
I don’t got a spare!

753
00:45:49,415 --> 00:45:52,215
So you see, we’ll have to
wait for a tow.

754
00:45:52,655 --> 00:45:56,055
‐ What are you doing? Move!
‐ Just get that mess cleaned up!

755
00:45:59,055 --> 00:46:00,815
How long are you gonna take?

756
00:46:00,815 --> 00:46:03,495
Just shove some dirt in it
and let us pass!

757
00:46:11,015 --> 00:46:12,535
They're here!

758
00:46:12,535 --> 00:46:14,135
They've come for us!

759
00:46:34,655 --> 00:46:37,815
I just knew this would happen!
I knew it! We’re screwed!

760
00:46:37,815 --> 00:46:40,935
Destroy them! Do it, and I'll
double what we agreed to!

761
00:46:40,935 --> 00:46:42,095
We can't win!

762
00:46:42,095 --> 00:46:44,095
There's four of them and
just one of us!

763
00:46:44,575 --> 00:46:46,815
You coward! Move aside!

764
00:46:58,295 --> 00:46:59,455
Who are they?

765
00:46:59,615 --> 00:47:01,175
The enemy!

766
00:47:02,135 --> 00:47:03,695
My enemy, your enemy,

767
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:06,495
Even Mother’s. Everyone’s enemy!

768
00:47:06,975 --> 00:47:09,015
And I’m gonna take them out!

769
00:47:17,655 --> 00:47:20,255
I see. I can fire from here.

770
00:47:20,255 --> 00:47:23,335
Disengage safeties. Ready!

771
00:47:25,495 --> 00:47:28,255
P‐Please don't! If you fire
that, they’ll execute us!

772
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:30,255
You know what? You can
keep your money!

773
00:47:30,255 --> 00:47:30,935
Shut up!

774
00:47:30,935 --> 00:47:32,375
I’m trying to concentrate!

775
00:47:51,055 --> 00:47:52,495
[SOLDIERS] I‐It opened fire!

776
00:47:52,495 --> 00:47:54,495
Return fire! Return fire!

777
00:48:05,735 --> 00:48:08,295
Stop firing! Please!

778
00:48:08,295 --> 00:48:11,255
It wasn't me! I didn’t
pull the trigger!

779
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:14,375
Could it be the boy?

780
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:28,015
[ASTRAIA:] Earth is a
beautiful place.

781
00:48:28,015 --> 00:48:31,055
The sky is blue, and it has
mountains and forests.

782
00:48:34,695 --> 00:48:37,095
[ARTESIA:] We have
forests in Munzo, too.

783
00:48:41,095 --> 00:48:44,935
[ASTRAIA:] You’re right, but
Earth's forests are filled with
all sorts of animals.

784
00:48:46,295 --> 00:48:48,215
[ARTESIA:] What
kinds of animals?

785
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:51,815
[ASTRAIA:] Nothing can stay the
way it is forever.

786
00:48:51,815 --> 00:48:54,055
It’s the same for you, Artesia.

787
00:48:54,055 --> 00:48:55,535
You have to grow up too.

788
00:48:56,215 --> 00:48:57,815
Grow to be a nice girl.

789
00:48:57,815 --> 00:49:00,335
And grow up to be a good person.

790
00:49:00,335 --> 00:49:02,895
Then you can make a lot
of people happy.

791
00:49:02,895 --> 00:49:04,255
Okay?

792
00:49:11,495 --> 00:49:14,095
Stop it, Casval!

793
00:49:24,615 --> 00:49:26,375
Those poor people...

794
00:49:36,455 --> 00:49:38,855
[NEWSCASTER:] We have a
breaking news bulletin!

795
00:49:38,855 --> 00:49:41,535
A battle has broken out
on 7th Avenue!

796
00:49:42,095 --> 00:49:43,375
Federation tanks are
exchanging fire!

797
00:49:43,375 --> 00:49:44,455
This isn’t good...

798
00:49:44,655 --> 00:49:46,095
Damn that Hamon!

799
00:49:46,095 --> 00:49:47,455
This is too much!

800
00:49:50,575 --> 00:49:52,575
[SOLDIERS:] Proceeding
north on 7th Avenue!

801
00:49:52,575 --> 00:49:54,295
Sir, it’s slowed down!

802
00:49:54,295 --> 00:49:56,415
It will reach the
blockade line soon!

803
00:49:56,415 --> 00:49:59,055
[OFFICER:] Permission to
destroy it! Standby to fire!

804
00:49:59,055 --> 00:49:59,855
Roger that!

805
00:49:59,855 --> 00:50:01,615
[DOZLE:] Not so fast!

806
00:50:01,615 --> 00:50:02,535
[OFFICER:] What?!

807
00:50:04,095 --> 00:50:05,535
[DOZLE:] Major Dozle Zabi,

808
00:50:05,535 --> 00:50:06,855
Munzo Defense Force,

809
00:50:06,855 --> 00:50:08,655
Capital Banchi, Command!

810
00:50:08,655 --> 00:50:09,935
Sir, what is it?

811
00:50:09,935 --> 00:50:13,895
The children of the late
Zeon Zum Daikun are aboard that!

812
00:50:13,895 --> 00:50:15,895
So you may not attack it!

813
00:50:15,895 --> 00:50:19,295
You must wait until after
they've
been retrieved from the vehicle!

814
00:50:19,295 --> 00:50:20,455
Yes! I understand!

815
00:50:20,455 --> 00:50:21,775
I’m calling my superior now!

816
00:50:22,535 --> 00:50:25,135
Yes! That’s exactly
what he said, sir!

817
00:50:26,495 --> 00:50:28,655
Huh? This isn't any concern
to the Federation?

818
00:50:28,655 --> 00:50:30,255
Destroy the rebel vehicle?

819
00:50:30,855 --> 00:50:33,655
I understand, sir, but he
seems quite adamant.

820
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:35,855
He says it’s a direct order.

821
00:50:35,855 --> 00:50:37,855
What?!

822
00:50:42,895 --> 00:50:45,495
How dare you defy me!

823
00:50:45,495 --> 00:50:50,455
You will not harm Deikun’s
children, or I will surely make
you regret it!

824
00:50:53,215 --> 00:50:54,255
For me?

825
00:50:54,775 --> 00:50:56,175
[GIHREN:] Yes, it's me.

826
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:58,535
Don’t take any action.

827
00:50:58,735 --> 00:51:00,535
Just wait and see how
it plays out.

828
00:51:00,775 --> 00:51:02,575
What about Deikun's children?

829
00:51:03,015 --> 00:51:05,175
I don’t care what
happens to them.

830
00:51:05,175 --> 00:51:06,775
Yes. Leave them.

831
00:51:13,055 --> 00:51:14,935
C’mon, kids! We’re getting out!

832
00:51:14,935 --> 00:51:16,535
There are more
Guntanks on the way.

833
00:51:20,215 --> 00:51:22,295
This smoke will make
for good cover.

834
00:51:24,855 --> 00:51:28,015
Wait! Where are you going?

835
00:51:28,015 --> 00:51:29,375
Don't leave us here!

836
00:51:29,375 --> 00:51:31,095
I've set the controls
to autopilot,

837
00:51:31,095 --> 00:51:33,255
so it should continue to
travel in a straight line!

838
00:51:34,855 --> 00:51:37,295
We’re gonna have to jump!
Ready?!

839
00:51:40,135 --> 00:51:41,815
Jump as far as you can!

840
00:51:41,815 --> 00:51:43,815
Don’t worry, I’ll be
there to catch you!

841
00:51:46,255 --> 00:51:47,975
Jump! Come on, now!

842
00:51:47,975 --> 00:51:49,055
Hurry Artesia!

843
00:51:59,255 --> 00:52:01,135
[SOLDIER:] RTX‐65 closing in!

844
00:52:01,135 --> 00:52:03,135
Distance, 2,000m!

845
00:52:03,135 --> 00:52:05,135
There’s still no response to
our orders to stop!

846
00:52:05,135 --> 00:52:07,135
Okay, prepare to...!

847
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:12,455
Major Dozle, would it be
all right if we attack, sir?

848
00:52:13,215 --> 00:52:15,295
Um...Yeah.

849
00:52:15,295 --> 00:52:17,295
Sir, yes sir!

850
00:52:18,055 --> 00:52:20,415
Ready cannons!

851
00:52:25,855 --> 00:52:26,895
Fire!

852
00:52:57,895 --> 00:52:59,775
Hey, taxi!

853
00:53:02,295 --> 00:53:04,415
Where to, young lady?

854
00:53:04,415 --> 00:53:06,375
Oh you, as if you don't know!

855
00:53:06,375 --> 00:53:08,655
Take us to the cargo terminal,
please.

856
00:53:11,935 --> 00:53:14,575
Things went almost
according to plan.

857
00:53:14,575 --> 00:53:16,575
Pretty successful, right?

858
00:53:16,575 --> 00:53:18,095
Yeah, right.

859
00:53:23,135 --> 00:53:24,655
[DOCK WORKER:] Lt. Tachi!

860
00:53:24,895 --> 00:53:28,215
This last container, I’m gonna
start closing it up, okay?

861
00:53:28,215 --> 00:53:30,855
There not here yet! You
have to wait!

862
00:53:30,855 --> 00:53:32,255
I mean, there’s a
last‐minute capsule!

863
00:53:33,415 --> 00:53:34,815
[MR. RAL:] Ow! Ouch...

864
00:53:35,575 --> 00:53:39,415
Damn it all! Is this how they
handle precious cargo!

865
00:53:40,415 --> 00:53:41,615
We’re the cargo.

866
00:53:41,615 --> 00:53:43,495
Well, such is our lives, now.

867
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:47,975
We’ll have to be very quiet, so
try not to say a word.

868
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:51,055
Because cargo does not talk,
you see.

869
00:53:52,135 --> 00:53:54,375
[LT. TACHI:] Shh! Keep it down!
They’ll hear you!

870
00:54:00,855 --> 00:54:02,775
Okay! That's the last one!

871
00:54:02,775 --> 00:54:03,815
Go ahead and load it!

872
00:54:05,455 --> 00:54:07,455
[LT. TACHI:] It's fragile, so
be gentle with it!

873
00:54:07,935 --> 00:54:09,055
[RAMBA:] Subtle.

874
00:54:09,055 --> 00:54:11,255
[HAMON:] Don’t worry, it’s fine.

875
00:54:11,255 --> 00:54:13,855
He’s perfectly capable of
getting the job done.

876
00:54:13,855 --> 00:54:16,575
Although he could be more
smooth about it.

877
00:54:18,775 --> 00:54:21,855
[LT. TACHI:] Hey, wait! Stop!
What do you think you’re doing?

878
00:54:21,855 --> 00:54:23,695
Running an HF tomography scan.

879
00:54:23,695 --> 00:54:26,975
[LT. TACHI:] What for?! Are you
saying
you don’t trust my inspection?

880
00:54:26,975 --> 00:54:29,335
Am I not the officer
in charge here?

881
00:54:29,335 --> 00:54:32,335
If you don't put it on right
now, the ship is gonna leave
without it!

882
00:54:33,695 --> 00:54:35,375
[CAT MEOWS]

883
00:54:36,615 --> 00:54:39,655
Shh! No meowing, okay Lucifer?

884
00:54:39,895 --> 00:54:43,775
Oh no! You didn’t hear a cat,
did you? I don’t believe it!

885
00:54:43,775 --> 00:54:45,295
It’s over there!

886
00:54:45,295 --> 00:54:47,015
It went that way!

887
00:54:47,015 --> 00:54:48,295
Here, kitty, kitty!

888
00:54:48,295 --> 00:54:51,535
Come on out! Where’d you go?

889
00:54:51,535 --> 00:54:53,895
Here, kitty, kitty!

890
00:55:12,615 --> 00:55:15,175
I was holding my breath
the entire time.

891
00:55:15,615 --> 00:55:17,295
[HAMON:] We’re not out of
the woods yet.

892
00:55:17,295 --> 00:55:19,095
Because it looks like
we’ve got company.

893
00:55:24,935 --> 00:55:27,495
[KYCILIA:] That was a clever
stunt you just pulled off,

894
00:55:27,735 --> 00:55:30,375
but if you think you’ve won,
you’re sadly mistaken.

895
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:33,055
If I wanted to, I could
give the order

896
00:55:33,055 --> 00:55:35,135
to ground all
outbound cargo ships

897
00:55:35,135 --> 00:55:37,855
and have their inventory
rechecked and scanned

898
00:55:38,015 --> 00:55:40,433
I am fully aware of that, Cdr.
Kycilia.

899
00:55:40,433 --> 00:55:43,535
But you’re too kind to do
anything that drastic.

900
00:55:43,535 --> 00:55:44,975
Why, thank you, Captain.

901
00:55:44,975 --> 00:55:47,135
You're a fine judge
of character.

902
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:49,575
That said, I tell you
what I will do:

903
00:55:49,575 --> 00:55:51,575
I'll turn you in to
the authorities.

904
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:53,415
Whatever you say.

905
00:55:53,415 --> 00:55:57,415
And we’ll go willingly, like the
good
little lambs we are, of course.

906
00:56:02,975 --> 00:56:04,615
[FLIGHT CREW:] Gate 3, open!

907
00:56:04,615 --> 00:56:06,855
Flight 103, clear for departure!

908
00:56:06,855 --> 00:56:08,895
Gate 1, course is clear.

909
00:56:09,055 --> 00:56:12,255
Ocean Cargo 008, you may
prepare for departure.

910
00:56:12,935 --> 00:56:15,175
008, proceed to taxiway!

911
00:56:15,175 --> 00:56:17,175
Roger! Activating
auxiliary engines!

912
00:56:20,215 --> 00:56:21,495
[CASVAL:] The ship is leaving...

913
00:56:21,895 --> 00:56:23,135
[FLIGHT CREW:] Dead slow ahead.

914
00:56:23,135 --> 00:56:24,255
Course is clear.

915
00:56:25,895 --> 00:56:27,335
[CASVAL:] It should be
safe to go out now.

916
00:56:27,895 --> 00:56:30,055
Not yet! Don’t go out there!

917
00:56:33,575 --> 00:56:35,015
We're inside a container...

918
00:56:35,015 --> 00:56:35,815
Let's go!

919
00:56:35,815 --> 00:56:37,135
[MR. RAL:] Wait, listen to me!

920
00:56:38,015 --> 00:56:42,015
[HAMON, V/O:]The capsule and
container
can both be opened from the
inside.

921
00:56:42,015 --> 00:56:44,615
It’s going to be cold in there,
but be prepared.

922
00:56:45,615 --> 00:56:46,775
[ARTESIA:] Casval...

923
00:56:46,775 --> 00:56:49,935
My body is floating,
like I’m swimming.

924
00:56:49,935 --> 00:56:51,695
It’s called zero‐G.

925
00:56:51,695 --> 00:56:53,695
In space, you don't
weigh anything.

926
00:56:54,655 --> 00:56:57,895
[FLIGHT CREW:] I hate to say
this, but the terminal at
Granada is pretty packed,

927
00:56:57,895 --> 00:56:59,615
so you should be
prepared for delays.

928
00:56:59,615 --> 00:57:02,095
[SHIP CAPTAIN:] Thanks for the
heads‐up, appreciate it.

929
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:17,455
[HAMON, V/O:]Once the
ship leaves port,

930
00:57:17,455 --> 00:57:19,455
see if you can go find a window.

931
00:57:20,775 --> 00:57:24,735
‐ Wow!
‐ [HAMON, V/O:] You'll be able
to see a sea of stars.

932
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:34,135
Amazing...

933
00:57:34,135 --> 00:57:35,615
So pretty!

934
00:57:35,615 --> 00:57:39,895
So this... is space?

935
00:57:42,255 --> 00:57:46,535
From there, you can see the
moon and your new home, Earth.

936
00:57:48,455 --> 00:57:52,135
Miss Hamon, can you tell
my mom something?

937
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:53,865
I'll be a good girl on Earth

938
00:57:53,865 --> 00:57:57,015
and I'm gonna count each time
the Moon grows round.

939
00:57:57,255 --> 00:58:00,495
After 100 times, make
sure you come.

940
00:58:00,495 --> 00:58:02,615
'Cause I'll be waiting for you.

941
00:58:11,295 --> 00:58:12,855
Over there, look!

942
00:58:22,815 --> 00:58:23,895
Munzo?

943
00:58:32,735 --> 00:58:34,335
You mean that’s...

944
00:58:34,335 --> 00:58:38,495
Our house, our city, everything
is inside of that?

945
00:58:38,495 --> 00:58:39,895
[CASVAL:] That's right.

946
00:58:39,895 --> 00:58:41,295
It's all in there.

947
00:58:42,255 --> 00:58:43,575
Artesia, look!

948
00:58:44,135 --> 00:58:45,855
That's the sun!

949
00:58:46,135 --> 00:58:48,215
I’ve never seen
anything like it.

950
00:58:48,215 --> 00:58:50,335
It's so bright I can't
even look at it!

951
00:58:50,335 --> 00:58:52,895
[CASVAL:] That light is the
source of life.

952
00:58:53,095 --> 00:58:55,815
Plants, people, and animals,

953
00:58:55,815 --> 00:58:58,135
they all come from that light.

954
00:58:58,135 --> 00:58:59,295
Casval!

955
00:58:59,295 --> 00:59:01,095
Look! What’s that?

956
00:59:01,095 --> 00:59:03,255
I think that thing is the Earth!

957
00:59:03,255 --> 00:59:04,735
The Earth?

958
00:59:05,175 --> 00:59:07,895
[ARTESIA:] Isn’t the Earth the
place we’re going?

959
00:59:07,895 --> 00:59:09,615
[CASVAL:] That's right, Artesia.

960
00:59:10,055 --> 00:59:14,775
It's blue and beautiful, but
humans have nearly ruined
it with all their pollution.

961
00:59:14,775 --> 00:59:19,255
That's why Spacenoids were
ultimately driven away and
came out into space.

962
00:59:23,255 --> 00:59:24,695
What's that?

963
00:59:24,695 --> 00:59:26,415
[ARTESIA:] What's
that big thing?

964
00:59:27,135 --> 00:59:29,095
Oh, that? The Moon.

965
00:59:29,095 --> 00:59:30,655
Go on and take a good look.

966
00:59:30,655 --> 00:59:32,335
That thing’s it?

967
00:59:32,855 --> 00:59:34,855
So that's the Moon?

968
00:59:35,615 --> 00:59:38,255
And it’s gonna grow round?
