1
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,440
[NARRATOR:] It was a time in
which humanity had set out

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,440
into space in search
of new lands.

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,880
And they gave that
time the name:

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,280
Universal Century.

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,080
Humanity entrusted their future

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,480
to gigantic space colonies

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,680
that had been constructed
around the Earth.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,440
However, this second homeland

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,920
was a far cry from the paradise
they had been promised.

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,240
Universal Century 0057

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,120
In Side 3, the cluster
furthest from Earth,

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,560
there appeared a leader

13
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,760
who called for
Spacenoid independence

14
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,440
and the reformation of
the human race.

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,000
This man's name was
Zeon Zum Deikun.

16
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,960
It appeared to the people
that the Earth Sphere

17
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,520
would advance even further
under his leadership.

18
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,760
However, in U. C. 0068.

19
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,800
As he was about to begin
his speech, Deikun collapsed.

20
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,720
Deikun's sudden death
sparked rumors of foul play.

21
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,640
We want freedom!

22
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,400
And even from within
the Deikun camp,

23
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,400
long‐held tensions
suddenly erupted

24
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,840
into factional infighting.

25
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,080
Degwin Zabi, a longtime
supporter of Deikun,

26
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,240
did not let such an
opportunity pass him by.

27
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,480
He and his faction defeated
the rival Ral family,

28
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,880
who had been harboring
Deikun’s next of kin,

29
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,840
and for all intents
and purposes,

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,840
he seized power in Munzo.

31
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,440
Deikun's wife, Astraia, was
locked in isolation.

32
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,240
And as for his children,
Casval and Artesia...

33
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,720
My enemy, your enemy, even
Mother's, everyone's enemy!

34
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,400
And I’m gonna take them out!

35
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,000
[NARRATOR:] They narrowly
escaped to Earth

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,960
accompanied by Jimba Ral, the
head of the Ral family.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,280
Three years later, in Spain's
Andalusia region.

38
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,720
Artesia changed her name to
Sayla, and Casval to Édouard.

39
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,440
They were adopted by
the wealthy Teabolo Mass.

40
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,918
However, their fellow defector,
Jimba Ral,

41
00:02:38,918 --> 00:02:41,960
was plotting a counterattack
against the Zabis,

42
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,960
which brought an assassination
attempt upon them.

43
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,320
Édouard fought off one attacker
and saved himself and Sayla,

44
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,520
but Jimba Ral was not
so fortunate.

45
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,520
Teabolo was also
gravely injured.

46
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,880
Heeding the advice of
Shu Yashima,

47
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,880
head of the Yashima Company,
an industrial giant,

48
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,000
Teabolo decided to relocate
to Texas Colony.

49
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,200
The colony was located in Side
5, also known as Loum,

50
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,000
and was intended to
be a theme park

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,280
modeled after the
American Old West.

52
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,560
However, a fateful encounter
awaited them there.

53
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,760
Hi, I’m Edouard Mass.

54
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,480
And I'm Char Aznable!

55
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,280
[DOZLE:] The head of the Ral
family in a fistfight?

56
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,160
[NARRATOR:] Back on Zeon, Dozle
Zabi was secretly developing

57
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,520
mobile workers for military use.

58
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,000
They would later come to be
called mobile suits .

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,080
Meanwhile, sad tidings
reached Sayla,

60
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,080
who had been diligently counting

61
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,480
the full moons until their
mother’s arrival.

62
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,680
She’s dead...

63
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,560
[NARRATOR:] It was news of their
mother, Astraia's death.

64
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,880
No!

65
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,120
[CROWD:] Zabi! Zabi!

66
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,760
[NARRATOR:] Fate was not yet
done with the siblings.

67
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,480
[CASVAL:] Artesia.

68
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,880
I’m leaving, so I won’t see
you for a while.

69
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,720
[NARRATOR:] Édouard bade his
beloved sister Sayla farewell.

70
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,720
I beg you, please! You can’t
leave me, brother!

71
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,000
Casval! Don’t go!

72
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,720
[NARRATOR:] At that moment, he
set out on a new path.

73
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,680
He took his first step
towards vengeance.

74
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:28,520
MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM
THE ORIGIN III

75
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,000
[KYCILIA:] Casval has
left Texas Colony?

76
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,880
He's planning to enter
Zeon from Loum?

77
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,040
Kill him! Casval can not
return here alive!

78
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,480
No Zabi would disagree.

79
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,400
Make it look like an accident.

80
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,318
For we cannot afford to
have the public

81
00:05:48,318 --> 00:05:52,000
suspecting that one of Deikun's
spawn was murdered, now can we?

82
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,791
[CHAR:] I don’t know why you
want to go to Zeon,

83
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,040
you know zero people there.

84
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,760
Don’t expect to be riding my
coattails, alright?

85
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,360
[CASVAL:] That suits
me just fine.

86
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,880
I plan on finding my own way,
making my own path.

87
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,360
Wait here for a minute, okay?

88
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,680
I'm on a student visa, so I have
some extra paperwork
to fill out.

89
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,320
[CHAR:] Man, that took forever!

90
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,680
Those immigration people are a
bunch of bureaucratic idiots!

91
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,800
What if we miss our flight
because of this?

92
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,320
Yes of course, I understand.

93
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,040
[CHAR:] What?!

94
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,960
[SECURITY AGENT:] Would you care
to explain what you’re
doing with this?

95
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,960
I've never seen that thing
before in my life!

96
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,680
I swear, it’s not mine!

97
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,680
Why don’t we discuss
this in private?

98
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,280
No! I can’t, I’m going to
miss my flight!

99
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,560
Tomorrow’s my first day at
military academy, the Zeon one!

100
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,160
Here's my acceptance letter!

101
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,920
I can’t miss the academy’s
orientation, I can’t!

102
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,760
I have an solution. You
just follow my lead.

103
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,614
Sorry.

104
00:06:59,614 --> 00:07:02,480
We have to use the restroom, but
we’ll be right back.

105
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,480
Stop pushing me!

106
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,800
I don't need to go!

107
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,280
Casval and his friend have just
entered the restroom.

108
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,800
His companion's baggage set off
a security alarm, and they
may be detained.

109
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,873
There’s been a development.

110
00:07:13,873 --> 00:07:16,640
Target may not be aboard his
anticipated flight.

111
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,480
[KYCILIA:] Understood. Await
further instructions.

112
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,440
Roger that.

113
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,840
Change places? Why
would we do that?!

114
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,280
[CASVAL:] Shh! If you want to
make flight 107, it's
the only way.

115
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,440
[CHAR:] Oh man...

116
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,800
[CASVAL:] We have to hurry!

117
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,040
They’re going to get suspicious.

118
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,520
[CASVAL:] Here!

119
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,560

120
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,120
Give me your papers, too!

121
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,120
And then I can put them
in my luggage!

122
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,880
[CHAR:] Oh, good idea.

123
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,920
Have you calmed down?

124
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,360
Sorry for my outburst.

125
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,480
I know you were merely
doing your job.

126
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,240
[GATE AGENT:] Mr. Édouard Mass!

127
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,120
Please go to the gate! If you
hurry, you can still catch
your flight to Zeon!

I'll never forget this!

Not ever! Not in a
million years!

131

Bye!

132
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,360
Ha, he’s dramatic.

00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,320
Your pal acts like you'll never
see each other again.

He does, doesn’t he?

135
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,080
[FEMALE ZABI AGENT:] Casval is
heading to the gate by himself.

136
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,080
Shall I proceed with the plan?

137
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,760
[KYCILIA:] Yes. You have
my permission.

138
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,360
With pleasure.

139
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,720
[KYCILIA:] That little friend of
his has no idea how
lucky he just got.

140
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,123
[GATE AGENT:] Flight 107 to Zeon

141
00:08:40,123 --> 00:08:42,080
has now departed five
minutes behind schedule.

142

Mr. Char Aznable!

143
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,840
[SECURITY AGENT:] I
apologize for the delay.

144
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,480
I have your suitcase for you.

145
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,480
About this, though...

146
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,760
I'm told that it's a gem of a
find from the 19th Century,

147
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,640
so it’s understandable why you
would want to bring it.

148
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,195
But rules are rules, so I’ll
have to confiscate it.

149
00:08:59,195 --> 00:09:00,200
You understand.

150
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,880
Now then, I believe
we’re done here.

151
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,600
Yes, of course sir.

152
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,240
Don’t forget, the next flight to
Zeon is first thing tomorrow!

153
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,440
Get a good night's sleep!

154
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,160
And have a safe trip, Mr.
Char Aznable!

Just my luck...

315
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,480
Is this thing it?
Your magnum opus?

316
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,480
We’ve increased the
mobility of the arms!

317
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,680
Also, we’ve managed to—

318
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,680
The decision's already made.

319
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,520
The MS Project has
been terminated.

320
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,520
Y‐You can't do this!

321
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,880
Not after all the progress
we’ve been making!

322
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,160
And this junkheap is what
you call “progress?”

323
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,440
What kind of weapon exposes its
engine by strapping
it on its back?

324
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,280
Forget it!

325
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,400
It's been settled!

326
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,800
It's a pleasure to meet you,
director.

327
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,560
I'm the technical advisor
for this project.

328
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,800
Name’s Torenov Y. Minovsky.

329
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,560
Your criticism is entirely
justified, sir.

330
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,960
But you don’t need to worry.

331
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,240
I am already working on a
solution for it.

332
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,160
[MINOVSKY:] These are the
schematics of my latest
fusion reactor.

333
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,440
As you can see,

334
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,120
it is a quantum leap smaller
than existing models,

335
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,600
and there is no impact
on its output.

336
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,880
And this right here is the
Fluid Pulse System,

337
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,320
which makes use of
Minovsky particles.

338
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,480
By using this method, we can
smooth out the drive system

339
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,760
and make active attitude
control possible.

340
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,080
As I am sure you are
all well aware,

341
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,960
Minovsky particles block
the propagation

342
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:07,080
of electromagnetic waves and
inhibit radar and
electronic circuits.

343
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,120
This advancement will change
the face of warfare.

344
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,440
But even more
significant than that,

345
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,040
they will take the focus
of combat away

346
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,840
from battleships and
precision‐guided weapons

347
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,360
and give warfare's starring
role to a new player.

348
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,320
Just one question:

349
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,920
When can you have it ready?

350
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,560
Before the year’s end,
I promise.

351
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,560
Very well.

352

Your wish is granted, I
rescind my order!

354
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,120
Continue with the project!

355
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,600
You won’t regret it!

356
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,760
We shall designate the model
equipped with this new
system MS‐03!

357
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,080
That said, do not miss
the deadline!

358
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,480
The political tides are
already shifting!

359
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,680

Here’s what you need to know
about this loaded march!

The pack you are carrying
weighs a total of 40 kg!

You must traverse this course
with it and return by sundown!

30 km like this?

far ahead that guy is!

pace yourself, cadet.

375

they are and rest!

slippery when it’s wet.

It's nice and dry, and
there’s plenty of room.

that I’m spoiled?

that’s your view.

so rather than press on,

they used a sneak attack to
overtake the enemy stronghold,

521

then used it as an observing
station for their mortar fire,

[FEDERATION SGT:] Attention! I
have your review!

The purpose of
today's mock combat

529

was to ascertain the level of
proficiency of you

Thank you for your generosity.

In that case, I have two
questions for you!

546
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:24,680
Question one: If today's
exercise was really meant to
mimic a real‐life mission,

547
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,040
what manner of enemy can we be
expected to confront

548
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,000
if we are meant to fight with an
already established

549
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,440
firepower disadvantage?

550
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,720
Question two: You just said that

551
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,400
you will not tolerate
any attempts

552

to alienate the colonies
from the Federation!

553
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,480
As such, since the Spacenoid
self‐defense force

554
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,080
is overwhelmingly inferior, with
sub‐standard equipment,

555
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,360
does it not follow that it’s
nothing but a sham military

whose only purpose is to drive
home just how weak the
colonies are?

Oh god, he said it!

I agreed to make an exception
because you had questions.

But the way I see it, that
wasn’t about questions.

00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,520
Oh, yeah, that. It's a
mobile worker.

628
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:42,640
A what?

629
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,943
They were originally created for
lunar resource extraction,

630
00:39:45,943 --> 00:39:47,960
but they can be used for
this stuff, too.

631
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,200
[GARMA:] My brother Dozle is in
charge of their development.

632
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,720
Char.

633
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,880
This is absolutely top‐secret.

634
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,120
But I'll let you in on it.

635
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:05,280
Those mobile workers out there
can be repurposed for
military use.

636
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:09,320
That's the reason why Dozle has
been working overtime on
their development.

637
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,480
They’re about to enter the
final stages, too.

638
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,720
[GARMA:] Thanks to Dr.
Minovsky's theories,

639
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,840
they’ve succeeded in
miniaturizing its fusion
reactor drive.

640
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,760
They're going to call
them mobile suits.

641
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:28,040
Mobile suits, huh? I see...

642
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,160
There’s a large ship approaching
from open space!

643
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,360
Oh no, stop them!

644
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,040
We're still cleaning up debris!

645
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,160
Can’t open a channel!

646
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,320
They won't accept anything
but a Federation code!

647
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,920
[GARMA:] Those idiots!

648
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,520
[CHAR:] That's an
assault landing ship.

649
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,760
It's massive.

650
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,360
It's probably on its way to
pacify Zum City.

651
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,440
Pacify?

652
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,040
Their security forces
opened fire.

653
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,080
They did what!?

654
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,640
Uh‐oh. I think we're about
to get flattened.

655
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,360
Those arrogant jerks!

656
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,040
They have no respect for anyone!

657
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,200
Don't they know who’s
responsible for this mess in
the first place?!

658
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,680
Rein them in, Gihren!

659
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,000
Are you listening to me?

660
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:29,960
Of course.

661
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:33,680
I merely thought it might be
best if we stand back and
observe for now.

662
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,400
Doing that will trigger a war.

663
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,520
We’re just a colony state,
there’s no way we’ll win
against the Federation!

664
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,120
Yes, maybe...

665
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,600
But we’ll never really
know unless we try.

666
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:48,320
You don't seem to understand the
stakes here, so listen.

667
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,760
If these riots
continue to escalate,

668
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,880
the Federation Forces are
guaranteed to intervene.

669
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,080
Meaning they will mobilize
Guardian Banchi garrison.

670
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,800
And may I remind you...

671
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:03,080
That's where Garma is located
at this very moment!

672
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,480
Calling it a military academy
might sound pleasant,

673
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,640
but while he’s there, he’s no
more than a hostage.

674
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,320
In an emergency situation,

675
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,080
the so‐called academy
will be taken over

676
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:17,920
by the vastly superior
Federation forces nearby.

677
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,880
And from that point on, his life
will be in their hands.

678
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,400
Well, now do you understand?

679
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,920
Mark my words, anything
happens to Garma,

680
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,760
I'll hold you responsible.
Understand?

681
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,920
They fired again!

682
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,600
Sadists!

683
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,160
Hey, it’s Garma!

684
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,520
[CADET:] What do you
want us to do?

685
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,400
Hey, that’s enough!

686
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,480
Garma's exhausted from working
debris cleanup detail!

687
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,120
You rookies just settle down!

688
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,560
[YES‐MAN:] Let us handle it.

689
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,320
Garma.

690
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,560
Can I talk to you for a sec?

691
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,960
[GARMA:] Attack the
Federation’s barracks?

692
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,120
That's right.

693
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,600
They’ll be off of their guard.

694
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,600
We’ll force them to disarm.

695
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,880
We can overtake them with
a sneak attack.

696
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,040
But we must act now.

697
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,240
You're joking...

698
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,960
Don’t tell me that
you’re scared!

699
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,200
You, an heir to your
family’s legacy,

700
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,680
who one day might lead the Zabis
and have control over Zeon?

701
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,600
You can’t be scared of a
little thing like this.

702
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,440
Yeah, but...

703
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,440
You have the ability to lead us!

704
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,760
You're our top student!

705
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,760
You’re the shining star
of the academy!

706
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,560
Char...

707
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,320
You saw that assault landing
ship with your own eyes.

708
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,218
That massive thing was
transporting security forces

709
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:43,320
from the Guardian
Banchi to Zum City.

710
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:47,440
And as we speak, those very
forces are slaughtering the
citizens there.

711
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,006
If the troops that are stationed
here are also shipped

712
00:43:51,006 --> 00:43:52,600
into the fray, what
happens then?

713
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,470
If you're the Zabi man
you say you are,

714
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:58,120
then you can't stand idly
by and do nothing.

715
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:00,560
You’re right.

716
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,280
But how are we going to win?

717
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,080
Don’t worry.

718
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,040
Take a look.

719
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,520
This is a map of the garrison.

720
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,240
The garrison houses an
entire regiment.

721
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:15,680
But of that, one battalion is
currently out in Zum City, which
leaves two battalions.

722
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,680
And that’s only 2,000 men.

723
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,360
We’re still outnumbered!

724
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,000
By about ten times!

725
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,720
Victory isn't determined by
who has more troops.

726
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:27,080
If they're not an organized
fighting force, then
they're simply a mob.

727
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,080
[CHAR:] There are two
barrack blocks.

728
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:32,240
In the center are the admin
building and regimental HQ.

729
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,680
Across from there are the armory
and heavy machinery hangar.

730
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:39,160
We'll designate these as
attack targets A, B, C, and D.

731
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,880
When did you do this?

732
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,680
It’s well thought out.
I’m impressed.

733
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,680
Well, don't be
impressed just yet.

734
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,960
We have to work out the details.

735
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,960
One of them is the docking bay.

736
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,908
We need to seize control
of it to prevent

737
00:44:52,908 --> 00:44:54,760
any support they may
send from outside.

738
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,320
The second thing is
Superintendent Dozle.

739
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,960
My brother is a good man.

740
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,320
If we talk to him, I'm
sure he'll...

741
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,320
That's it! We'd be better off
doing this with his help!

742
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,200
If I ask him...

743
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,200
Garma!

744
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,320
The gears of history
are shifting,

745
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,920
you can crank them with
your own hands

746
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,920
or you can run to your
brother for help.

747
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,760
[NEWSCASTER:] The unrest in
Zum City continues.

748
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,680
Citizens are erecting
barricades in the streets,

749
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,120
and security forces are
opening fire on them.

750
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,000
Further deterioration of the
situation is feared.

751
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:28,600
[CADET:] It's lights‐out!

752
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,040
What are you still doing awake?

753
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,280
Go to your bunks and get to bed!

754
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,680
You first and second years got a
lot of guts, breaking
the regulations!

755
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,680
You want demerits?

756
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,360
[CADET:] Dorm 2 is clear!

757
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,440
They're all in.

758
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,440
No questions asked.

759
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,440
Qumran was crying like a baby.

760
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,960
[CADET:] Well, his old man did
die in that agricultural
block explosion.

761
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,680
[CADET:] Garage status?

762
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,680
[CADET #2:] I can open it with a
spare key at any time.

763
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,680
Gear up and wait back
in your room!

764
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,120
[CADET #2:] Set intercom
to channel 0024!

765
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,880
Char's going out first. Then
we’ll move out under
Garma's command.

766
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,360
[CADET #3:] I wish I was going
out first as well!

767
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,760
[CADET #4:] Me, too!

768
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,360
Don't let the RA spot you!

769
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,360
[CADETS:] We’re
really doing this?

770
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,360
Those Federation bastards
are going to get it.

771
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,440
[GARMA:] Char! Come here!

772
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,240
I think something's
wrong with my vest!

773
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,400
I can't get it to...

774
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,800
Thanks...I appreciate it...

775
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,800
Char...are you sure you can’t
just come with me?

776
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,240
I can't.

777
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,920
Someone has to sneak in first to
create a distraction.

778
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,920
Zenna says she wants
to volunteer!

779
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,040
I hate to ask this.

780
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:49,520
It’s an important task, but if
anyone can do it, you can.

781
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,440
To be honest, I would prefer
to go into combat.

782
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,280
But if this is what you need,
I’ll do it!

783
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,720
All right, then, I'm off.

784
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:59,960
Remember, it’s not much
different from our mock combat.

785
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,080
[LINO:] Char!

786
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,960
Making a grand exit, I see?

787
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:15,280
You know, you’re doing a bang‐up
job of playing the leader.

788
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,000
So different from what you were
like in high school.

789
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:23,600
Remember the famous lunaball
final I mentioned during
the combat drils?

790
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,440
Well, the funny thing
about that is...

791
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,400
...it never existed.

792
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,520
See, I decided to do a little
detective work in my spare time.

793
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:38,200
Turns out an Édouard Mass of
Texas Colony died in a
shuttle accident.

794
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:41,080
He happened to be the spitting
image of Char Aznable,

795
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,360
except for the fact that his
eyes were crystal blue.

796
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,240
Like Casval’s.

797
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,000
Casval Rem, the son of
the late Deikun.

798
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Funny, huh?

799
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,440
You've finally come back to us,
haven't you?

800
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,440
Casval?!

801
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:00,120
You came to Zeon to get revenge
on the Zabis! Am I right?

802
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,840
Revenge? What are you
talking about?

803
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,080
Don’t worry, it’s okay!

804
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,800
I know how to keep a secret!

805
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,960
I promise, you can trust me,
Casval!

806
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,640
I'm on your side here!

807
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,916
I think poisoning your
father was unforgivable,

808
00:48:11,916 --> 00:48:14,000
and the Zabis need to pay
for their crimes!

809
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,720
I can help you out with that!

810
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,360
Did what to who?

811
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,160
I’m sorry, but I’m totally lost.

812
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,240
[LINO:] Ahh, right.

813
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,960
You don't know if you
can trust me yet.

814
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:23,480
That’s okay.

815
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,743
But if you're going to keep your
identity a secret,

816
00:48:25,743 --> 00:48:27,120
those eyes are a dead giveaway.

817
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,000
I have a solution, though.

818
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:31,880
What is that?

819
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:34,720
Lunaball headgear. I
modified it for you.

820
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,600
You can't exactly be wearing
glasses into battle, am I right?

821
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,360
How’s that?

822
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:49,040
Does it suit me?

823
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,880
It’s perfect!

824
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:53,240
It looks great on you, Char!

825
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,200
It does?

826
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,040
Thank you very much, Lino.

827
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:05,480
[GARMA:] To protect our
countrymen in Zum City,
we must rise up!

828
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:08,320
We have the potential to
make history today.

829
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:12,440
That said, we might also provide
the spark for an all‐out war

830
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,200
between the Federation and Zeon!

831
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,760
My friends, think back
and remember!

832
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,880
Why did we all enroll here?

833
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,360
Why did we want to
become soldiers?

834
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:25,960
It was to protect the lives,
rights, and property
of Spacenoids!

835
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,680
And it was never to serve
the Federation!

836
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:41,080
[GARMA:] We mustn't let the
Federation garrison
force mobilize!

837
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:43,280
They claim to be dispatching
for crowd control.

838
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,880
But they will murder the
citizens of Zum City.

839
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,560
This isn't about rebellion!

840
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,280
It’s about doing what’s right!

841
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,920
There you go, rich kid.

842
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,920
You gotta look strong.

843
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,920
You must understand one thing.

844
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,920
This is not one of our drills!

845
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,040
This is no mock battle!

846
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,600
The bullets out there
will be real!

847
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,600
You get hit, you could die!

848
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,200
And in all likelihood, some
of us surely will!

849
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,640
But will you stand with me?!

850
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:12,080
[CROWD:] Yeah!

851
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,760
All right! Then let’s move out!

852
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,520
[CROWD:] Yes sir!

853
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,080
[DOZLE:] What?

854
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,240
She wants to see me?

855
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,040
At this hour?

856
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,040
To discuss trouble with
academy life?

857
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,040
That's odd...

858
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,640
Zenna Mia...

859
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,880
Ranked eighth in her class, huh?

860
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,920
She appears to be a solid cadet.

861
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:41,880
These issues are typically
handled by a school counselor.

862
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,920
Sorry to disturb you, sir!

863
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,720
You know, I’m not usually awake
at this late hour.

864
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,000
Apologies, sir.

865
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,360
Since I am, I may as
well hear you out.

866
00:50:58,360 --> 00:50:59,160
Have a seat.

867
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,840
I'm fine standing right here,
sir.

868
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,480
Suit yourself.

869
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:05,000
Alright then, what seems to
be the problem?

870
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,840
Money? Boys? Soldier’s
life not suit you?

871
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,480
It’s none of the above, sir.

872
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,480
No complaints about the academy,
either.

873
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,240
Then why are you here?

874
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,720
The truth is...

875
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,200
The reason I’m here is to take
up some of your time.

876
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,360
Do what? Why do that?

877
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:27,120
[RUMBLING]

878
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,200
What the hell?!

879
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:43,760
[ZENNA:] Please remain
where you are, sir.

880
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,160
What's the meaning of this?!

881
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,320
Stay where you are!

882
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,400
It's an emergency mobilization
of the third‐year cadet corps.

883
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,960
They're on their way to the
Federation garrison.

884
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,200
Why, you little...

885
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,640
[SOLDIER:] Col. Dozle, sir!
it’s an emergency!

886
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,120
The cadets have gone rogue!

887
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,800
Please open the door!

888
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,200
You have to stop them!

889
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,520
You ignorant fools!

890
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:09,320
No, don't!

891
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,360
Who was it?!

892
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,520
Which of you is
responsible for this?!

893
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,520
What cadet is stirring the pot?!
Answer me!

894
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,640
It’s Master Garma, sir!

895
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:25,160
Master Garma, he inspired
us to take action!

896
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,880
No way.

897
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,640
Our little Garma is behind this?

898
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,600
I don’t believe it.

899
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,640
[CADETS:] This is the
self‐propelled mortar team!

900
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,000
We’re at the firing point!

901
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,720
Spotting point secured!

902
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,640
Good. Commence the operation!

903
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,840
Fire! And begin
storming the building.

904
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,120
[CADET:] Overshot! Two right!

905
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,800
Shorten 500! Left, 2!

906
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:20,120
Fire for effect, now!

907
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,240
[SOLDIERS:] What the...?

908
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,360
We're under attack?

909
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:33,920
No way!

910
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:40,800
Fire!

911
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,840
[GARMA:] Continue support fire!

912
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,400
We're under attack!

913
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,120
[CHAOS]

914
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:03,920
Hurry!

915
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,160
[SOLDIER:] Command!

916
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,400
This is the Guardian
Banchi garrison!

917
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,000
[SOLDIER:] We are currently
under mortar assault!

918
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,520
Return fire with heavy weapons!

919
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,320
This is the regimental
commander! Send out the tanks!

920
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:44,120
Direct hit to control tower!

921
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,480
Armory is on fire!

922
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:48,400
Squad flanking left is
neutralizing group D!

923
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:50,840
Nice work!

924
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:53,120
Have Char storm the
control tower!

925
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:00,880
Bastards!

926
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:04,800
Die now!

927
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:10,400
Char!

928
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,285
I have a message from Garma,

929
00:55:14,285 --> 00:55:16,120
he wants you to storm the
control tower!

930
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,280
I figured.

931
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,520
Everyone on alert! MBT
straight ahead!

932
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:28,720

933
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:29,560
Yeah?

934
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,200
I want you to
commandeer that 61.

935
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:35,600
If I recall correctly, you got
an A in special
vehicle operation.

936
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,520
I'll make a break for the
control tower.

937
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,040
Roger!

938
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,240
You can count on me!

00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,120
Good luck.

940
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:43,320
We'll use 010 for our
dedicated comms channel.

00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,440
Crap! I can't see a thing!

rejoin the squad!

945
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,160
[CHAR:] Roger that.

946
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,400
I knew you could do it.

947
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:47,720
I need another person
to man the guns!

948
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:48,960
See if you can send someone!

949
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,720
[CHAR:] Understood.
I'll see to it!

950
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,600
Char! Where's Lino?!

951
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,400
We ran into an enemy tank.

952
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:00,920
Those bastards!

953
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:02,920
We'll be sure to
avenge his death!

954
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:03,760
Let's go!

955
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:04,240
Right!

956
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,360
[SOLDIER:] Enemy is advancing
from two directions!

957
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,760
They’re still firing!

958
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:16,280
Those military academy
brats can go to hell!

959
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,240
What's that?

960
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,320
Do you read me? Come in!

961
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,440
I’ve got friendlies are
drawing a bead on me!

962
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:32,920
[LINO:] Are you there?

963
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:35,280
Casval! Casval!

964
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,240
Please respond!

965
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:43,960
Casval, call them off!

966
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,240
Casval! Casval!

967
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,160
Casval!

968
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:54,240
Fire!

969
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:02,840
Don’t do this Casval!

970
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:15,680
I told you, I’m not Casval.

971
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,680
My name’s Char Aznable.

972
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,600
[SOLDIER:] Central
block taking fire!

973
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:36,080
It won’t hold for much longer!

974
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,520
Those punks! How dare they!

975
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:41,360
Let me at those filthy
Zeon bastards!

976
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:46,000
What happened to the
backup generator?

977
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,880
You're the regimental commander,
I presume?

978
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:06,480
With all due respect, you
ought to surrender.

979
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:10,080
For all your sakes, order your
troops to stand down
immediately.

980
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:21,000
[NARRATOR:] And so, under the
command of Garma Zabi,

981
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,680
the uprising of some 200
military academy cadets,

982
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:29,080
forced the EFF security forces
to lay down arms.

983
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:36,280
[DOZLE:] Both sides,
hold your fire!

984
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:37,840
That is an order!

985
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:40,960
This is Superintendent Dozle!

986
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,840
Cadets, you will fall
back as well!

987
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,440
Dozle’s finally here.

988
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,440
Garma!

989
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:01,320
What the hell are you thinking,
you crazy kid?!

990
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,960
[DOZLE CRYING]

991
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:11,640
[NARRATOR:] Their actions would
later be known as the
Dawn Rebellion.

992
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:14,920
The students’ passion and
bravery stirred the hearts

993
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:17,320
of the citizens of the
Republic of Zeon.

994
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:20,386
However, this incident
would also mark

995
01:00:20,386 --> 01:00:23,000
the starting point of
the One Year War,

996
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:26,920
the greatest tragedy in the
history of humankind.

997
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,760
The Earth Sphere had begun

998
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:32,120
a headlong race into
chaos and darkness.

999
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,200
Everything is red.

1000
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:38,640
I think I rather like it.

1001
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:11,480
[VOCAL SINGING IN JAPANESE]

1002
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:27,920
Hey dad, what’s that?

1003
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:29,720
That is Luna II.

1004
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,200
[MR. RAY:] It used to be
the asteroid Juno.

1005
01:06:35,628 --> 01:06:38,143
It was brought here as a
source of raw materials

1006
01:06:38,171 --> 01:06:39,771
for space colony construction.

1007
01:06:41,115 --> 01:06:43,771
After that, it became the
beachhead for the construction

1008
01:06:43,858 --> 01:06:47,943
of a new Side at Lagrange 3, but
the project was put on hold.

1009
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:51,858
As it stands now, it's turned
into somewhat of a
white elephant.

1010
01:06:52,971 --> 01:06:57,458
Until construction on Side 7 is
finally approved, that is.

1011
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:00,285
There's Side 7.

1012
01:07:05,315 --> 01:07:07,943
I see, it’s still being
constructed, huh?

1013
01:07:19,715 --> 01:07:20,943
[SECURITY AGENT:] Okay,
you're all cleared.

1014
01:07:21,171 --> 01:07:22,085
Next please!

1015
01:07:25,371 --> 01:07:27,743
Amuro Ray, I’m 13 years old!

1016
01:07:29,915 --> 01:07:33,200
The son of the head of
development, huh? Nice.

1017
01:07:34,828 --> 01:07:37,571
[MR. RAY:] I’ll almost likely be
even busier than usual.

1018
01:07:38,258 --> 01:07:40,800
Chances are, I won’t be
home very often.

1019
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:42,258
So you'll be the man
of the house.

1020
01:07:42,258 --> 01:07:44,258
Pick good kids to be
friends with.

1021
01:07:44,258 --> 01:07:45,485
You’ll have to work hard.

1022
01:07:45,771 --> 01:07:47,858
You're the son of Chief Ray,
head of development.

1023
01:07:47,858 --> 01:07:50,058
That means a lot will be
expected of you.

1024
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,343
Are you listening?

1025
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:55,115
Haro. Friend.

1026
01:07:55,115 --> 01:07:56,943
Haro. Amuro's friend.

01:08:00,228 --> 01:08:01,628
[GATE AGENT:] Thank you
for your patience.

Now arriving at Gate 01.

1029
01:08:03,943 --> 01:08:07,371
You may feel unsteady until you
adapt to the G forces.

1030
01:08:07,371 --> 01:08:08,658
Please be careful.

1031
01:08:09,371 --> 01:08:11,028
The gate is now opening.

1032
01:08:11,343 --> 01:08:14,543
There will be a slight breeze
due to the change in
air pressure.

1033
01:08:29,143 --> 01:08:33,400
This is it...this is Side 7...
