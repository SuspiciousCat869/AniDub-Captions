1
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:21,958
Takkun, we're surrounded.

2
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:23,291
It's a full-scale attack.

3
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:24,458
They've got snipers, too.

4
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:26,250
Snipers are always
so annoying, you know?

5
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:27,541
If we move, they'll fire.

6
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:29,708
But we've gotta do something.

7
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:31,666
You're right.
I'll draw their fire.

8
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:32,708
It's dangerous-

9
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:34,375
[Haruko] That's the idea!

10
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,000
This is your final battle!

11
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:39,541
Go and die
to prove that you love me!

12
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,750
[Man on TV] Brother!

13
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:45,458
[Brother] I'm a runaway
bullet train after all.

14
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:48,541
[Man on TV]
Brother! You can't die now.

15
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:51,875
[Director] What are all these
pigeons doing here?

16
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:54,375
Get these stupid birds
outta this shot!

17
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:01,916
Hey, what are you doing?

18
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,750
Haruko-chan, play nice, now.

19
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:10,500
Not in a hundred thousand
years will you ever

20
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:13,541
get anything from me but
a butt full of lead, compadre.

21
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:16,583
You are so cruel, Haruko-chan.

22
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:18,416
[Naota]
What's with those clothes?

23
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,500
[Kamon]
Ah, this red jacket you mean?

24
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:23,916
Why, do you prefer
the green one, Naota?

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,750
You like
the other version, huh?

26
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:27,958
The "Castle of Cagliostro"
version, huh?

27
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:30,166
When did you become
such a hot shot preppy type?

28
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,916
Anyway, monkey-sensei
prefers the red one, you know.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,083
No matter what he says now,
we can't do anything about it.

30
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:36,791
Hey, hey where are you going?

31
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:38,500
Naota-kun. Naota-kun!

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,833
[Haruko] What? You're saying I
have personal feelings for him?

33
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:49,583
I don't think so.

34
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:51,416
The reason this mission
has been delayed

35
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,500
is because the channel
to N.O. is still open.

36
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:59,500
It's not about
liking or disliking.

37
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:01,041
Damn, the connection went dead!

38
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:03,208
Oh, were you listening?

39
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,375
Why don't you
put on some clothes?

40
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:09,250
Is there someone here?

41
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:10,333
How's this?

42
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:12,583
[Naota] Uh... I meant
normal clothes.

43
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:15,791
Haruko's "Master the guitar
in one millisecond" class.

44
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,666
Yeah! Sign up now!

45
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,541
Do you find this
difficult to understand?

46
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:24,166
Grab the guitar and you can be
a pop idol. Chicks dig it, dude!

47
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:24,958
Pyon!

48
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:25,666
[Naota] Pyon?

49
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,375
Like Filter or Slash.

50
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:30,791
Like Red Hot Chili Peppers,
or Rage Against the Machine,

51
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:32,333
or Richard Cheese.

52
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,458
There's one that doesn't
fit the list, you know.

53
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,458
You have to learn to stand
like a cool rock dude, pyon.

54
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:41,708
Jimi Hendrix and McCartney
both start out like this.

55
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:44,583
Haruko, hey!

56
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,125
What are you doing?

57
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,208
It's dangerous to go
waving that thing around.

58
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:56,166
Use your guitar again.
One more time, Takkun. Kakkin.

59
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,333
You did it so great last time.

60
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:00,291
Not interested.

61
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:01,916
I should teach you
how to be a man, Takkun.

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,583
Yeah, like you know!

63
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,291
[Haruko] Ya, Takkun,
that's more like it.

64
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,291
[Naota] No.

65
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:25,333
The horn... it's... the horn.

66
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:27,750
[Haruko]
Muku-muku my first kiss.

67
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,916
[Naota] Liar. You've already
done it plenty of times,

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,291
and you know it.

69
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,666
Naota-kun,
I can't forgive you.

70
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,958
You were making out
and doing perverted things

71
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,833
behind your father's back.

72
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:43,041
That's not true.
You don't know what-

73
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,125
Right. We will have
a duel of honor.

74
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,500
We must do battle
for Haruko-san.

75
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:48,875
I'm for it.

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,166
Haruko-san! Here's my weapon,
it's all for you.

77
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:01,583
"Forever the Bullet
of Love and the Plot"

78
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:06,250
"Brittle Bullet"

79
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:10,541
[Kamon] Hey hey, what's the
matter with my poor little son?

80
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,208
[Naota] What are you doing?

81
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:16,416
Geez!

82
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,208
[Kamon] If you're just gonna run
and hide like a scared rabbit,

83
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:23,291
then your dear old dad's gonna
have to take Haruko-san away.

84
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:26,958
[Haruko] Oh no, Takkun,
save me, save me.

85
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,500
[Naota] Get off of me.

86
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,041
[Naota] Don't use me
as a human shield.

87
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:35,291
Those things hurt.

88
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,416
Cut it out.

89
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,000
[Haruko] Save me.

90
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,875
Target sighted.
We are in range.

91
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,583
[Kitsurubami]
It's blue. Repeat. Blue.

92
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,625
[Amarao]
You're sure it's not red?

93
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,208
So the blue is confirmed then.

94
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:57,500
Alright. I already got Medical
Mechanica's unofficial consent.

95
00:04:57,583 --> 00:05:00,416
We'll take care of it here so
they can't interfere with us.

96
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,125
I have work to do,
so let's do this fast, ok?

97
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,791
But I want it to look cool,
you know what I mean?

98
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,750
Charming in a manly grown-up
kind of way. Get it?

99
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,875
If we screw up, Medical
Mechanica'll be all over us.

100
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,916
Just forget Raharu. She'll
just complicate everything.

101
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,958
Just take care of yourself
'til I get there.

102
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,500
You know, more mature looking.

103
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,083
Something that a woman I haven't
seen in a while would think,

104
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,208
"This guy's really virile, but
also nurturing and supportive."

105
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:20,083
Something like that.

106
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:21,166
That's what I'm looking for.

107
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,166
Oh, don't I get
one of those candies?

108
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,375
I wanna get the sweetest one.

109
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,250
Super sweet,
if you know what I mean.

110
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,250
[Kamon]
You're so easy Naota-kun.

111
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,791
So easy.

112
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:46,041
[Kitsurubami] They seem to be
playing some kind of game.

113
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,875
Looks really stupid.

114
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,875
I'm sure I can
handle this myself.

115
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:54,291
Huh, who's the girl
he hasn't seen in so long?

116
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:00,583
What are you doing? You're
supposed to be helping me.

117
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,375
But my guitar's
not plugged in.

118
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:05,583
Why'd you bring that? Are
you crazy? This is war, gee!

119
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:08,666
It's squeegee and
bungee and grungy.

120
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,208
We're in trouble, G.

121
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:19,416
[Naota] Take that.

122
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:25,333
[Kitsurubami] Blue. Blue.
Blue. Blue. Cobalt Blue.

123
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:28,041
If 7 of 9 heeds a cy
what do you have?

124
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,250
Cyborg!

125
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,958
Cyborg my butt!

126
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:38,458
Actually, confusing cyborgs
with robots is a common mistake.

127
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,333
Take that, yah!

128
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:42,875
"The correct kanji uses
the more Chinese-style 'blue.'"

129
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:47,916
[Kamon] I'm leaving
the rest to you, TV Boy.

130
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,083
Alright, just
one more and I win.

131
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,666
Wait, wait, hold on!

132
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,583
I get three timeouts, you know.

133
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,541
Don't gimme that look.

134
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:17,041
Okay, I just made it up!

135
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,041
Naota, you okay?

136
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,083
Did you... cut him up?

137
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,625
Were you hurt?

138
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:25,291
I'm used to this stuff.
I can handle it.

139
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,000
"Masamune Liquor"

140
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,250
What's this truck for?

141
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,541
[Masashi] Deliveries.
We got a part-time job.

142
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,958
[Naota] Job? You're
in elementary school.

143
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:36,375
[Masashi]  It's okay, don't
worry. We won't get caught.

144
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:38,208
We only drive along
the side of the river.

145
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,666
[Naota] You mean you do this
all the time?

146
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,666
That looks cool, you know?

147
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,750
Huh?

148
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:45,958
It's not that.

149
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,125
He's the one that wanted to.

150
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,208
It's a toy, right?

151
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,333
Does it shoot bullets?

152
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:53,416
Actually it, uh... uh...

153
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,250
Hey, Canti, go on and
buy the uh, drinks, yeah.

154
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:01,250
[Naota] And don't
get the sour kind.

155
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,791
[Gaku] So, Naota, didja hear?

156
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:06,916
[Naota] What?

157
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,791
[Gaku] A rumor.

158
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:10,166
[Naota] A rumor, about what?

159
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,416
What is it?

160
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,250
[Gaku] That that satellite
was coming down.

161
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:17,125
That you saved the city.
That you did it, Naota!

162
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,125
Also, there was that whole thing
with Ninamori at school.

163
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,458
That's right.
And everyone says

164
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,791
you're controlling
that killer robot.

165
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,333
[Gaku and Masashi] Yeah!

166
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:33,750
What's that? I didn't know
it was such a big rumor.

167
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,416
Geez, what do I say?

168
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,708
[Masashi] Yeah, so it's like
you're the pilot?

169
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,375
Like a robot commander
or something.

170
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:41,750
Is that true?

171
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,958
You're really the commander,
Naota? That's awesome!

172
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:46,000
It's true.

173
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,083
[Naota] Cut it out.

174
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,291
[Gaku] She's the one
who kissed him. Smooch!

175
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,291
Smooch! Smooch!

176
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,833
--[Eri] I won.
--[Gaku] Smooch! Smooch!

177
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,791
--[Masahi] Really?
Hold on a sec.
--[Gaku] Smooch! Smooch!

178
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:58,458
[Masashi] Here ya go.

179
00:08:58,541 --> 00:08:59,375
What?

180
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:00,750
[Masashi] 
It's a prize.

181
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,041
It was supposed to be
pay for work, but...

182
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,250
It's nice.

183
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,666
Hey, Sameji!

184
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,833
[Eri] You think they're
actually going out?

185
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,833
[Masashi] She's
his brother's girlfriend?

186
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,833
What's his name, Tasuku?

187
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:41,250
He's a baseball player.

188
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,791
[Gaku] But that other one
likes Naota, too.

189
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:44,958
The kiss kiss girl.

190
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:48,333
He's like... popular!

191
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:49,958
Pulpy, huh?

192
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:50,750
Hmm?

193
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:51,916
[Mamimi] Your drink.

194
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,166
You like the kind
with pulp now, Chief?

195
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,500
[Naota] Well, I don't like
the sour ones, you know that.

196
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,125
[Mamimi] And Haru-san?

197
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,458
Likes the pulp?

198
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,375
I was watching.

199
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:09,041
I saw you.

200
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:12,125
It's no big deal. You worried?

201
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,625
[Naota] I don't really
think anything about Haruko.

202
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,541
I guess I don't know how she
feels about me or anything.

203
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:20,291
But she was just messin' around
today, jumpin' all over me.

204
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,750
But it's always like that.

205
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,291
Well not always
always like that.

206
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:26,666
I mean that we like
do something like that.

207
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,000
You know what I mean.

208
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,583
It's pretty amazing, really.

209
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,666
You controlling Canti
and then attacking

210
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,750
the Great Lord of Fear
and even saving the city.

211
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:37,083
You saw all that?
Where were you?

212
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:40,666
Yeah, you're pretty amazing
lately, Takkun.

213
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,166
Naw, it's no big deal, really.

214
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:47,291
Although I did actually
save the whole city.

215
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,708
That is true
and everything, but you know.

216
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:52,250
So, you saw
the whole thing, huh?

217
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,583
[Naota] What?

218
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:03,583
The water. I me- in the river.
I'm sorry, the attack failed.

219
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:04,750
I lost the target.

220
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,333
[Kamon] Robots are
different from cyborgs.

221
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,916
It's a horrific enemy.

222
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,833
It flies around like
it's never heard of gravity.

223
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:19,250
Kitsurubami!
Kitsurubami! What's wrong!

224
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,916
[Hairdresser] Now hold still,
we gotta do the hair color next.

225
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,250
How do you want that,
by the way? Auburn? Chestnut?

226
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:29,416
Or should we make it
fooly cooly color?

227
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,416
[Amarao] FL CL?

228
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,958
[Haruko] What's with
the eyebrows lover boy?

229
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,666
An attempt at
bushy masculine charm?

230
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:46,208
Chicks dig the clean-cut look.
That what you were thinking?

231
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,583
Raharu.

232
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,958
Decided to send your
little commando on a mission?

233
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:00,333
[Naota] Ow!
Why'd you shoot at me?

234
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,958
[Mamimi] There, under your hood.
Is it FLCL again?

235
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,541
You're really
too amazing, Takkun.

236
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:13,291
You drink the pulp now,
and you do fooly cooly

237
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:17,000
and you do googly googly
and drooly drooly.

238
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,875
When did you start
to change and grow up

239
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:20,791
and everything, Takkun?

240
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:25,375
Is it because of Haru-sa?
Is she changing you?

241
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,833
[Naota] You mean,
ya mean that...

242
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,000
Come with me.

243
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,375
No! Stay away!

244
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,333
I'm not a child anymore.
I'm an adult.

245
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,833
I can buy my own insurance
and everything.

246
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,250
That robot is too dangerous.

247
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:02,500
If we don't take it out, Medical
Mechanica will make its move.

248
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,625
You understand they're willing

249
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,208
to activate the plan
for that purpose,

250
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,625
and you know what
that'd do to this planet.

251
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:09,750
And that thing.

252
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:12,791
When that thing turns red,
it's Atomsk.

253
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:27,666
[Haruko] Too easy.

254
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,166
[Men in Black] 
Hold it! Stay right there!

255
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,291
Don't move!
Don't even think about it!

256
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:36,833
Quiet!

257
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,958
You can't be real.

258
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,625
[Naota]
Like I said, it's nothing.

259
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:51,041
She's just like, a really
ditzy girl, that's all.

260
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,500
[Naota] Why are you
pulling me so hard?

261
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,500
It hurts, Takkun.

262
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,000
I mean it.

263
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,333
Ever since she came here,
bad things started happening,

264
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:01,916
like I never get to just
be with you anymore.

265
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,416
It was better
the way it was before.

266
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:08,250
"Take a rest here"
So, let's get something here.

267
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,833
Why are you doing this
all of a sudden?

268
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,458
I just wanna hang out
here with you.

269
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,000
What's wrong with that?

270
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:17,000
Takkun, you're not supposed
to do things like this with me.

271
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:18,083
[Naota] Why not?

272
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:20,291
We're here.

273
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,708
[Mamimi] This is
'cause of Haru-san.

274
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,166
[Naota] She has
nothing to do with this.

275
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,416
[Mamimi] You like Haru-sa.

276
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,958
[Naota] How can I like
someone who's insane?

277
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,583
[Mamimi] 
How much do you like her?

278
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:28,750
[Naota] I don't.

279
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,041
You've got it all wrong.

280
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,250
It's you that I-

281
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:34,083
[Mamimi] Takkun, don't lie.
You like her.

282
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,833
What's the matter?
I thought you liked me too.

283
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,250
I know you do.

284
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,041
Ow, watch where
you point that thing.

285
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,708
[Masashi] Wow,
that can't be good.

286
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,708
Where are my eyebrows?

287
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,625
Look at that!

288
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,791
Medical Mechanica's
transporting these monstrosities

289
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:21,208
here to destroy this planet.

290
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:22,583
It's all over.

291
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,416
Don't you see
what's happening here?

292
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
You're such a drama queen.
Figure it out!

293
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,250
You're the one
who caused all this.

294
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,500
I don't care, ya got it?

295
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,958
Your guitar's not
up to it, that's it.

296
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:37,500
You are a million years
under-evolved. Primitive Monkey!

297
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:38,833
That's discriminatory language

298
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:41,458
used against
under-developed planets.

299
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:45,708
[Haruko] Furi-kuri furi-kura
furi-kuri furi-kura

300
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:46,916
You can't do that here!

301
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,125
Where are my eyebrows?

302
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,625
I gotta find my eyebrows.

303
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,166
Uh, where are they?

304
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,083
[Haruko] Small, as usual.

305
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,958
Guess that's
the best you can do, huh?

306
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:05,458
Takkun's a lot manlier, pyon.

307
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,750
[Amarao] You're toying
with my feelings again.

308
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:11,541
Damn you.

309
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,875
What do you see
in that grade school kid?

310
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:17,083
What's he got
that I haven't got?

311
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,708
[Naota] Hold on!

312
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,000
[Naota] Haruko!

313
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:40,791
Daikon V! Yeah!

314

Stop it, Haruko!

315
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,875
Tasuku, help me, sempai!

316
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,000
[Naota] My brother?

317
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,375
[Mamimi] I don't
wanna be here anymore.

318
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,250
Help me, Tasuku-sempai.

319
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,833
Don't call my brother.

320
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:53,875
Tasuku-sempai, Tasuku-sempai,
Tasuku-sempai, Tasuku-sempai...

321
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,583
[Naota] I'm the one who's here.

322
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,666
--Hey, look at me.
--[Mamimi] sempai, sempai,
sempai, sempai

323
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,041
--I'm the one
who's gonna save you.
--[Mamimi] sempai, sempai,
sempai, sempai

324
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,833
Canti!

325
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,250
Now listen.
My name is Naota.

326
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,625
Don't ever call me
Takkun again.

327
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:30,416
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!

328
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,041
Pyon.

329
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,041
Huh?

330
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,333
Useless.

331
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:57,875
Chance.

332
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,208
[Gaku] It's falling!
Back up! Back up!

333
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:10,916
[Masashi]
Huh? Where's reverse?

334
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:14,791
[Eri] What, what?

335
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:15,625
Naota's-

336
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:16,500
wife.

337
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,750
Final round.

338
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:30,166
"I'm the Hitman 3"
[Masashi] Blockbusters.

339
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,791
I'm all out of ammo.

340
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,208
[Kitsurubami] Commander!

341
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,666
[Amarao] I told you
this was impossible.

342
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,875
[Amarao] This is bad.
He's headed for the plant.

343
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,375
He's going to activate it.

344
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,208
What's that?

345
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,416
It's... It's...

346
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,541
It's Atomsk's...

347
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:26,875
[Amarao and Haruko]
...Gibson EB-0, 1961 model.

348
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,166
He's really the one.

349
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,000
[Amarao] 
It's the real pirate king.

350
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:22,708
"I'm the Hitman 3"

351

00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,791
[Eri] Ouch.

353
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:15,041
<i>The sky paints an orange slide.</i>

354
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:21,583
<i>And pride dangles like a sponge.</i>

355
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:26,458
<i>Spider... The taste of</i>
<i>capturing something alive.</i>

356
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:29,750
<i>You don't have to deny it.</i>

357
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:34,375
<i>I want to dream in color.</i>

358
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:39,333
<i>Ride on shooting star...</i>

359
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:50,000
<i>With the voice in my heart,</i>
<i>I sang out like a shotgun.</i>

360
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,625
<i>Grungy hamster--acting adult.</i>

361
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:10,166
<i>Revengeful lobster--</i>
<i>drag him along.</i>

362
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:18,375
<i>Sniper... At the edge of</i>
<i>the world, what can you see?</i>

363
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:22,666
<i>Before I aim I want to touch it.</i>

364
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:28,000
<i>Ride on shooting star...</i>

365
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:31,583
<i>I was looking for you.</i>

366
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:38,500
<i>Through my withdrawal,</i>
<i>I was lying.</i>

367
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:41,791
<i>Ride on shooting star...</i>

"Next Episode"
[Haruko] Well, we're winding

370
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:21,000
down to the final episode,

371
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:23,375
but there's not
much to talk about.

372
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:25,000
You must have a lot
of questions by now,

373
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:27,125
but who knows if
they'll ever be answered.

374
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:29,916
So, Mr. Director,
how is this gonna end?

375
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:36,833
Next on FLCL, Episode 6:
"Fully Climaxed."

376
