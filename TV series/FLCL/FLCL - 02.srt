1
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,333
[Mamimi] I saw God
the other day.

2
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:14,833
[Mamimi] By the river
on a rainy afternoon.

3
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:17,458
He helped a kitten that
was left all alone.

4
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:19,916
It's a god that only I can see.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,666
A black-winged angel
that came down

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,083
from the heavens just for me.

7
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:25,541
[Naota] What are you doing?

8
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,125
[Mamimi] Huh?

9
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:28,625
"Mabase Elementary School"
Hey, Takkun!

10
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:30,541
Why are you at my school?

11
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:33,041
[Mamimi giggles]
I felt like it.

12
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:36,166
--Geez, aren't you embarrassed?
--[Eri] Who's that? Huh?

13
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,291
It's his wife.

14
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:39,375
Yeah, he's married.
To an older woman.

15
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:40,375
[Mamimi] Takkun...

16
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:41,458
Are they like, dating?

17
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,083
--Oh--!
--What do you want?

18
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:44,666
[Gaku and Masashi laugh]

19
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,125
She doesn't look very bright.

20
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:47,750
[Mamimi] What's that thing
on your head, Chief?

21
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:49,125
--It looks cool.
--[Naota] Cut it out!

22
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:50,458
--Let me see it. Huh?
--Stop looking at it.

23
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:51,833
--Huh? Huh?
--I mean it!

24
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,666
That is so not cool.

25
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,750
[Haruko] Okay, stay still.

26
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:57,500
Look at this. It's empty.

27
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:58,958
There's no brain.

28
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:01,166
Didja loose it somewhere?

29
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,875
You're the one that did this.

30
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:05,041
Don't blame me if you
go around losing things.

31
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:06,666
Some kids are just freaks.

32
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,583
Look who's talking, Miss Normal.

33
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:12,375
At least I didn't sprout a robot
out of my head like some people.

34
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:14,500
By the way, there's
something new there now.

35
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:17,291
It's weird. Not normal,
these horns sticking out.

36
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:20,291
The last one turned into a dumb
robot that's living at my house.

37
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:22,375
Living here!
What's up with that?

38
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:24,916
And it's all because I
was run over by your bike.

39
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's a normal Vespa,
go see for yourself.

40
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:30,083
And you still haven't
taken those clothes back.

41
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:33,708
People out there are starting
to think you're a real nurse.

42
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:37,125
Ah! Hey there. Haruhara
Haruko here. Age 19.

43
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:39,250
Splendiferous housekeeper
at Takkun's house.

44
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:40,708
She's older than that.

45
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:42,791
But my true identity is this...

46
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:50,166
[drumroll]

47
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,416
[guitar strum]

48
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,583
[Haruko] First Class
Space Patrol Officer.

49
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:57,000
[Haruko] Uh--

50
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,916
What a lame stage name.

51
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,125
[Naota grunts]

52
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:02,416
Chill out. We're not
going on Star Search.

53
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,666
That hurt! Why'd Miyu Miyu
get on your case yesterday?

54
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,625
[meow]

55
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:08,041
Because I'm in trouble.

56
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:09,416
Lots of trouble.

57
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,541
Because of Takkun,
they're all on my case.

58
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:13,208
What is this thing anyway?

59
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:15,541
How does a robot
take x-rays like that?

60
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:18,333
Because he's a Medical
Mechanica robot, probably.

61
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:19,416
Didn't you know that?

62
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,875
They make them there.

63
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:23,583
Why'd he come out of my head?

64
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,166
Yeah, that's what I wanna know.

65
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,208
What's your connection with
Medical Mechanica, huh? Huh?

66
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,833
--Huh? Huh? Huh?
--[Naota] That hurts!
Hey, cut it out!

67
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:32,541
[Naota's voice] Exactly
where does the truth end

68
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:34,708
and the lies begin?

69
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:37,500
Samejima Mamimi
and Haruhara Haruko.

70
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:40,125
A lot of lies are
flowing around me.

71
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:42,708
These two new horns
that sprang up...

72
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:45,916
A true story that
seems like a lie.

73
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,250
"Fire Starter"

74
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,125
[Kamon] Move it. Move it.

75
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,000
Well, since you don't
have any nifty functions,

76
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,291
you can at least make yourself
useful around the house.

77
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,625
Hey! You're using
him outside again?

78
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:04,041
[Kamon] No, no,
this one goes in first.

79
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,708
The neighbors
have eyes, you know?

80
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,250
[Kamon] You want
it all to yourself,

81
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,750
because you brought it home.

82
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,875
Aren't we being a
little bit selfish?

83
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,500
It's weird having a
robot in the house.

84
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,791
"Fresh Bread Shigekuni"
[Kamon] Don't worry about it.

85
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,333
So there's a robot in our house.

86
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:19,791
Think of the symbolism involved

87
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:22,750
in having a humanoid robot
in a normal household.

88
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,375
Contrast by the abnormal
advance of science,

89
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,166
which is thereby
proven to exist.

90
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,875
Consider the significance
of a human family, N.

91
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:32,625
The robot is a part of
it and accepted into it,

92
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:35,541
And the social structure, M,
that makes that possible.

93
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,458
And everyone is
buying Initial D,

94
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:40,208
Robot Detective K, Nakamori
Akina's Young Girl A...

95
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:41,916
[Haruko] What's he
talking about?

96
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,666
He wrote a whole book on
the deep mysteries of "Eva."

97
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,833
"Ewa?"

98
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,083
[Kamon] ...actual
meaning of the robot.

99
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,916
That robot was walking
around loose yesterday!

100
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,375
There've been a lot of
fires around here lately.

101
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,750
Yeah, like yesterday.

102
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,208
[Naota gasps]

103
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,750
He deserves a little
free time to himself.

104
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:00,458
Right, TV Boy?

105
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,000
Uh...?

106
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:14,666
[cat] Na, na, na...

107
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,083
[Mamimi] Mm?

108
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,416
You're in high school. What
do you think you're doing?

109
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,750
I was playing with Takkun
and my shoes floated away.

110
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,083
With who?

111
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,791
--Takkun.
--Na, na, na...

112
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,333
[Naota] That's his name, too?

113
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:31,125
[Mamimi] Yeah, Chief,
this Takkun is hungry.

114
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:32,458
Do you have anything for him?

115
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:33,541
[Naota] Like what?

116
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:34,750
[Mamimi] Well, not
like chewing gum.

117
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:37,166
You saved him? A stray cat?

118
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,750
[Mamimi] I'm like a god, huh?

119
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,958
A protector of the weak.
The god of the black flames.

120
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,791
You know, Lord Canti, Chief!

121
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,166
[Naota] That's a game, right?

122
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,916
The one where you burn down
the city and everything.

123
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,291
[Mamimi] Yeah, I'm addicted.

124
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:50,791
[Naota] You like games, huh?

125
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:53,208
Hm? You don't wanna play?

126
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,958
[Naota] I'm too busy.

127
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,833
[Mamimi] Yeah,
you're always busy.

128
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:57,875
[Naota] 'Cause there's
the bunch of people

129
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:00,208
I have to take care of. See ya!

130
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:04,916
[Haruko makes engine noises]

131
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,875
Oh? Oh! Aaaaahhh!

132
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:10,166
[Haruko struggles]

133
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,916
Aahh! Huh--?

134
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:20,125
Lady! Lady!
What year is this?

135
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:23,208
I've never seen parts
like these. Whoa!

136
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:24,333
You can save your breath.

137
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,500
This girl has no brains at all.

138
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,791
Just take a look at her.

139
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:32,250
Barges into an off-limits
facility and crashes her bike.

140
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,541
It's been bad enough
here lately without this.

141
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,583
Turns out the fire
yesterday was arson,

142
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,916
and the day before that
the nurse at the hospital

143
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,500
was tied up and all her
clothes were stolen.

144
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,166
There's a lot of depraved
people out there, huh?

145
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,333
Gahh!!

146
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,125
Aren't you embarrassed
to act like that?

147
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,541
Who the hell is this kid?
Your brother?

148
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:52,416
No. No relation.
I'm from planet Earth.

149
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,416
Then get lost. This is no
place for little kids.

150
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,958
Can't you see we're
working here?

151
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,208
[Haruko] This isn't a
place for people to work.

152
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,541
[Naota] Hm?

153
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,375
There's not even a
door to get in or out.

154
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:05,958
[Haruko] No doubt
you're thinking,

155
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:09,208
"Why would a grade-school
kid be my guardian?" Right?

156
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:12,208
Hold on. You're telling me
this kid's your guardian?

157
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,750
Yeah, I have custody.

158
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,208
It's kind of unusual.

159
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,625
[Haruko] So, you
came for me, huh?

160
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:21,125
[Haruko] The rain stopped.
I'll give you a reward.

161
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,125
[Naota] Hm?

162
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:25,166
[Haruko] It's even
better than CPR.

163
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,708
[Naota] Hm?!

164
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:33,375
He's not here yet, huh?

165
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:34,916
Huh?

166
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,041
Ah! It's a god.

167
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,250
[cracking noise]
[Mamimi] Uh?

168
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,625
Mm?

169
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,750
[Takkun] Na...

170
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:45,125
Ah...!

171
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,000
It's a god.

172
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:50,125
I can see him. He's really real.

173
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:53,166
That time I was saved, he...

174
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,083
[Haruko] So, you
usually don't come out

175
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,458
to the beach like this, huh?

176
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:02,000
Not in October.
It's too cold.

177
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:07,041
[Naota yells]

178
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,458
Hey, that's dangerous!
Your driving sucks.

179
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,291
I'm a very safe driver.

180
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:14,166
[distant yells]

181
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,041
I don't like scary stuff.

182
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,666
And I don't have a helmet.

183
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,166
Hm. You're scared. Even
though your brain is missing.

184
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:26,500
[Naota yells]

185
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:27,750
[Naota's voice]
When you're on a bike,

186
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,250
the ocean's a lot
closer than you think.

187
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,708
The autumn soft wind
went right through

188
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,833
into the back of my nose.

189
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:40,333
And maybe it's because, like
Haruko said, my head was empty.

190
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
"Samejima Mamimi (17)"
Anyway, I'm glad I followed him.

191
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:53,416
Geez, what if someone sees
it going around like that?

192
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,333
"Haruko Haruhara (?)"
I saw him at 7-11.

193
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:56,250
"Naota Nandaba (12)"
Huh?

194
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:58,666
[Haruko] He was reading Hustler.

195
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,750
"Naota Nandaba (12)"
When?

196
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,041
"Samejima Mamimi (17)"
It's so nice.

197
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,875
I wish I could have
him at my house.

198
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,250
Oh, yeah, you're not allowed 

199
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,583
"Naota Nandaba (12)"
to have any pets there, are you?

200
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,083
"Haruko Haruhara (?)"
Sameji.

201
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,500
Come on inside, it's cold.

202
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,333
[Mamimi] I'm okay out here.

203
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:12,541
[Naota]
My grandfather doesn't

204
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,000
"Miyu Miyu (12)"
like her dating my brother.

205
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,458
That's why you're keeping
her out of the house?

206
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:17,625
She said she doesn't care.

207
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:21,041
"Takkun (4 months)"
[Takkun] Na na na...

208
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,541
[Mamimi] Ah! He's back!

209
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:27,083
Ah! What are you doing?

210
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,666
[Naota yells]

211
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,791
Lord Canti!

212
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,250
Canti?

213
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:36,000
Hail oh god of
dark flames, Cantid!

214
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,000
You are late!

215
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,291
"The stupid clerk
at the store was slow..."

216
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,666
[Naota] Why are you
using him to run errands?

217
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,000
Ick! I told you to get
the kind with the pulp!

218
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:51,458
Huh? What's up with that one?

219
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:52,958
Hmm...

220
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,958
[Shigekuni] Hm?

221
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,125
[Mamimi groans]

222
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,666
[Shigekuni] Let's see it!

223
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:02,416
[Shigekuni] I said
to get the one

224
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,916
with the Anna
Nicole centerfold.

225
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,125
Can't you get anything right?

226
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,041
Grandpa too?

227
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,291
It's Hustler.

228
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,791
[Haruko] That robot's useless.

229
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,458
You're the one who
broke it, Haruko.

230
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,041
Haru-san, you shouldn't do this!

231
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,000
Don't you know that
Canti's a god?

232
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,083
What's she on about?

233
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,583
Oh, it's some video game.

234
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:21,041
In high school, I guess they
have a lot of free time.

235
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,333
It's not just a game.

236
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:25,166
The black wings prove it's him.

237
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,500
Don't go out anymore.

238
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:27,708
Or I'll have to chain you down.

239
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:28,916
[Haruko yelps]

240
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,416
"Scoop! Mysterious UFO!"
[Kamon] Hey, TV Boy.

241
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,625
Did you record the
Thursday night special?

242
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,750
[Gaku] Over here.

243
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,916
[Eri] This used to be
a boathouse? This thing?

244
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,208
[Gaku] Kinda smells.

245
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:49,958
[Eri] It says "Do Not Enter."

246
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,625
Then don't follow us, Ninamori.

247
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,666
Don't worry, the police
have already been here.

248
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,666
Oh.

249
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,750
[Masashi] I heard it was arson.

250
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,916
--[Eri] Again?
--[Gaku] Arson! Arson!

251
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,250
[Eri] Probably some
stressed-out housewife, huh?

252
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,416
Just too many dirty dishes.

253
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,541
It's not that.

254
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,083
The UFO zapped it.

255
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,916
Focus Magazine had pictures
and all kinds of stuff.

256
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,541
It was foreign agents.

257
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,750
If it was anything like that,
they'd burn something big,

258
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,291
not a boathouse.

259
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,500
[Gaku] That's true, they'd hit
like a school or something.

260
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,833
[Masashi] There was a school
that burned down, wasn't there?

261
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:19,500
[Gaku] Yeah, but that
was a long time ago,

262
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:20,750
when we were all little.

263
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,125
[Eri] Someone burned it down?

264
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:25,458
You can still see part of it.
It's all ashes.

265
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,458
Hey, what's that?

266
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,416
Ah--

267
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,250
What's she doing?

268
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:39,083
I don't know. I saw some
girls bullying her yesterday.

269
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,875
[Gaku] What uniform is that?

270
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,375
[Masashi] Shinden High School.

271
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,416
[Gaku] Hmm?
She's in high school?

272
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,666
[Eri] At that age,
it's really pathetic.

273
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,375
Hm?

274
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:29,916
[Naota gasps]

275
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,208
Ah...!

276
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,166
[Naota's voice] "Fire Starter."

277
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,708
It's a hand-held video game.

278
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:50,416
No one knows how Endsville,
the city of devils, was created.

279
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,208
--But as soon as it appeared,
--[Mamimi] Ah! Takkun.

280
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,375
--it started to grow
--Can you bring me some sandals?

281
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:55,958
--and slowly eat up the world.
--My shoes floated away.

282
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:59,916
You are an agent of Canti,
the god of the black flame.

283
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,041
And you must stop Endsville
from destroying the world.

284
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,750
Your only weapon is flame.

285
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:08,583
Matches, lighters, fire bombs.

286
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:11,666
Get the weapon.
Outsmart the firefighters.

287
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,375
Hide from the police.

288
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:16,250
And torch the city.
Purge its devils.

289
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,208
But you must be careful.

290
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,625
You cannot burn everything.

291
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:25,541
If the entire city burns down,
there will be no place to live.

292
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,625
Thus your battle is endless.

293
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:30,083
There is no final victory.

294
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:34,875
The only thing you can do
is burn and burn and burn.

295
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,875
Your highest goal is to receive

296
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:41,875
the personal blessing of Canti,
the god of black flame.

297
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:43,416
[Haruko] Yeah!

298
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,958
[Haruko] No, I haven't been
able to get in touch with him.

299
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,708
Well, I recruited one
of the enemy robots,

300
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,250
but he's useless anyway.

301
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,666
You know, the gears are turning,
but I don't know what--

302
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,875
Ah! Oh! Oh! Ow! Ah! Oh!

303
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,958
[distant sirens wail]

304
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,500
Huh?

305
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,041
[Firefighter]
Please, stand back.

306
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,125
The riverbed.

307
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:14,375
Ah! Where'd she go?

308
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,875
[Naota's voice] I remember now.

309
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,583
The fire at the elementary
school, six years ago.

310
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:23,958
[Mamimi] He's the
one who saved me.

311
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,208
[Naota] My brother?

312
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:28,541
Mamimi] The protector
of the weak, Lord Canti!

313
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,666
[Naota's voice] There were
rumors that it was arson,

314
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,833
but they never
found out for sure.

315
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,416
That's the day Mamimi
and my brother met.

316
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:45,208
[Mamimi] Fooly cooly,
fooly cooly, fooly cooly...

317
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,208
[Takkun] Na...

318
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:50,625
[Mamimi] Fooly cooly,
fooly cooly, fooly cooly...

319
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:55,916
[Mamimi] Why'd you
come down here?

320
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,583
It's kind of late.

321
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,708
You dropped something.

322
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:04,208
[Mamimi] I don't
need it anymore.

323
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:05,916
You can have it.

324
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,291
[Naota] This is where you and my
brother went to school, right?

325
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,458
[Takkun] Mew?

326
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,458
[Takkun] Na? Na!

327
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,041
[Mamimi] I hated this place.

328
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,583
[Takkun] Naaa!

329
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,500
He's here?

330
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:34,458
[Mamimi] And so... I wished
that it would go away.

331
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:37,166
But it's useless.
Even if it burns down,

332
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,750
the wreckage and ash
are still there.

333
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,041
[Takkun] Na na?

334
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,958
[Mamimi] Look,
Endsville is burning.

335
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:54,125
Now, Lord Cantid,
bless me with your kiss.

336
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,208
Your absolution.

337
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:57,375
Kiss me.

338
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,916
[Naota] Ah!

339
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,916
[Haruko] Uh?

340
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,041
[Naota] Ah! Ow!

341
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,166
[Naota grunts]

342
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,333
[Naota] W-What's this?
It's bigger than before!

343
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:11,708
Oh, no!

344
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,541
There's some weird fat
thing coming out of Takkun.

345
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:22,375
[Naota grunts, yells]

346
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,500
Takkun!

347
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:47,666
Wha? How dare you
hurt Takkun?! Huh?

348
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,208
[Takkun] Na na...

349
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,958

[Haruko grunts]

00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,916

Mamimi!

362
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,000

00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,250
No! Look out!

[Naota grunts]

369
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,291
Takkun?

370
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:15,541
[Haruko grunts]

371
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:19,291
[Naota yells] What are
you doing? Let me go!

372
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,125
Wah-- wah--

373
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,041
Takkun is...

374
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,583
He ate him!

375
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:29,708
[Naota struggles]

376
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:32,875
[Naota screams]

377
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,791
Stupid! You're not
Lord Canti at all!

378
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,875
Why'd you have to
go and eat Takkun?

379
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,666
Uh?

380
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:52,916
Ahh...

381
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:07,875
[Takkun] Cha na na?

382
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,541
Transformation?

383
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,625
[Mamimi whimpers]

384
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,333
[Haruko] Chance!

385
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,458
Huh? Uh-oh.

386
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,750
[Mamimi] Hm?

387
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,291
Ahh...

388
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:05,958
[Naota groans]

389
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:06,958
Takkun!

390
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,833
[Naota grunts]

391
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,833
Takkun, you're all sticky.

392
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,375
Ah... Huh?

393
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:16,375
[Naota] The ashes
are all blown away.

394
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,416
[Mamimi] And something smells.

395
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,416
[Takkun] Nya...

396
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,416
[distant sirens wail]

397
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,416
[Haruko] Ah, shit!

398
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,916
Let's get outta here.

399
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,125
Ah?

400
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,375
[Takkun] Nnna?

401
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:32,291
Hey guys, why are you
just standing there?

402
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,125
[Naota's voice]
At the time, I didn't notice

403
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,916
the sirens that were
coming toward us.

404
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,583
I don't know where the lies
end and the truth begins.

405
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:44,000
I asked myself what I
could do for Mamimi.

406
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:46,875
I decided to stay by her side.

407
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,625
Forever.

[Haruko's voice]
Anime directors like cats,

426
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:14,166
because they don't have
to take care of them.

427
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:17,000
You know, they can't even
take care of themselves.

428
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:20,291
Oshii is probably the only
director that loves dogs.

429
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:22,583
He thinks he's a dog himself.

of the sound effects

00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:30,250
is from a real cat at Gainax.
