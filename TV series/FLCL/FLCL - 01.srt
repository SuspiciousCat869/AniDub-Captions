1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,708
[Mamimi] Legs spread,
same width as the shoulders.

2
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:14,500
Body tight, then hit the ball
like you're defeating the enemy.

3
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:16,375
Here, the pinky
finger is the key.

4
00:00:16,458 --> 00:00:18,666
And then you just
hit, hit, hit.

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,708
Kakkin bingo!

6
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:22,500
[Naota] What are
you talking about?

7
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:23,875
[Mamimi] He who
conquers the left side

8
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:25,583
conquers the world, Chief.

9
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:29,083
Setting the parameters.

10
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:31,291
That's really the hard part.

11
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:32,875
[Naota] Are you talking
about a video game?

12
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:34,833
Hm?

13
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:37,166
Takkun, what are you doing?

14
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,416
[Naota] Homework.

15
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,708
[Mamimi] Then why don't
you do it at home?

16
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,250
It's not cool.

17
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:45,333
You can do my homework too,
if you want, huh?

18
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:47,750
Mm? Your hands are upside down.

19
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:51,541
Eh? [Mamimi fumbles]

20
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:54,041
You should play
baseball, too, Takkun.

21
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:58,166
Why do you always
carry around a bat?

22
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,791
[Naota] Why do you always
hang around here by the river?

23
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:04,750
Because, you know...

24
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:07,083
Huh? Now why was it?

25
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:09,333
You're in a good mood.

26
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:10,916
Huh?

27
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:16,625
[Naota] You smell
like cigarettes.

28
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:19,833
The strong ones.

29
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:21,958
I haven't been smoking.

30
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,625
[Naota] Mamimi, why do
you always do this?

31
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:31,000
[Mamimi] Earlobes.

32
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:33,250
[Naota] Mm? Ow!

33
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:35,666
[Mamimi] If I don't
do it, I'll overflow.

34
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:36,916
[Naota] What do you mean?

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,041
What'll happen?

36
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:43,000
[Mamimi] Probably
something amazing.

37
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:44,541
[Naota] Ahh!

38
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:53,166
[Naota's voice] Nothing
amazing happens here.

39
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,458
Everything is ordinary.

40
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:58,708
The huge factory that can
be seen from our town,

41
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:00,791
the Medical Mechanica plant...

42
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:04,083
All the adults got excited
when it came here.

43
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:06,208
Like it was really a big thing.

44
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:19,500
The white steam that billows
out every day at the same time.

45
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:23,750
It looked to me like smoke that
signified some kind of omen.

46
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:27,125
Smoke that spreads out
and covers everything.

47
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:34,708
"Fooly Cooly"

48
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,625
[Naota] Uh--

49
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:50,166
You know I don't
like sour drinks.

50
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,375
Pfaaah... Huh?

51
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,791
Oh, look, a mark. Wow.

52
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:59,250
How 'bout a Band-Aid?

53
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:00,708
Here.

54
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:01,750
[Naota] What?

55
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,291
[Mamimi] It's yours, isn't it?

56
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,791
There's more than
half left, Chief.

57
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:23,750
You know what?

58
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:28,125
My brother, in the U.S....

59
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:50,625
Alright! Lunch time!

60
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,833
[Naota grunts]

61
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:55,875
[Haruko] Already?

62
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:01,541
Takkun.

63
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:02,541
[Haruko] Stop!

64
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,750
Ah? Mm...

65
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:07,875
Hm?

66
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:10,208
Native girl must stop!

67
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,750
Taro-kun just hit his head,

68
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:15,166
so you can't move
him yet. Understand?

69
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,833
[Mamimi] Ah...

70
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,833
Ah-- But he isn't Taro-kun...

71
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,958
[Haruko gasps]

72
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:31,166
He's dead. This young
boy is completely dead,

73
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,416
just as Taro would be.

74
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,791
But he's not Taro, like I said.

75
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,708
--[Haruko] Oh, I killed him.
--[Mamimi] His name's Naota.

76
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,916
--I finally find the SOB,
and I killed him.
--I call him Takkun though.

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,791
--I didn't mean to,
it was an accident. Kinda.
--It's kind of cute,
don't you think?

78
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,666
Aw, let's face it;
I definitely,

79
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,708
totally killed him,
just like that.

80
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,041
Bang!

81
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:50,458
No, more like Bong! Kablam!
Or Kunk-Kunk-Splat!

82
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:53,125
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

83
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:56,250
Yeeeah...

84
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,875
Ay!

85
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,416
Ah...?

86
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,250
Come back to life!

87
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,583
Aaah...!

88
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:12,875
Smooch!

89
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:17,125
Waaah--!!

90
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:24,458
Those slow motion scenes
are really tough, huh?

91
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:27,083
Yeah, you have to hold
your breath until they cut.

92
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,416
You can get cramps
from that, you know?

93
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,375
[Naota] What? I thought
it was a special effect!

94
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:32,375
You're doing the slow motion?

95
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,875
"It's wrong."

96
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:39,416
[muffled sounds
from Naota]

97
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,208
Ahh! Alright! And
Taro-kun is back.

98
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:43,708
He's not Taro, okay?

99
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:45,833
Oh, really? That
was close, then.

100
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,333
'Cause if it was Taro,

101
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,625
he woulda just turned
into another statistic.

102
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,166
Death by motorbike.

103
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,208
I lucked out!

104
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:54,750
Round two.

105
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:57,916
Knock out?

106
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:06,041
Yo--Yoisho...

107
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,833
Here we go!

108
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:10,500
It's not coming out.

109
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,000
Guess I better hit him again.

110
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,250
Stop!

111
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,833
He hit his head, alright.

112
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,625
You said yourself you
shouldn't move him.

113
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:18,625
Tch...

114
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:22,875
[Naota moans
and groans]

115
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:24,708
What did you do to me?

116
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,500
CPR.

117
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,125
What do you think I did?

118
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,791
That's not what I meant.

119
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,458
Did she put her tongue inside?

120
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:34,875
You are useless!

121
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,583
What are you talking about?

122
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:38,333
Bleh!

123
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:39,958
[Naota and Mamimi yelp]

124
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:45,708
She's very fast.

125
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:48,083
She's at least twenty years old.

126
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,041
You need a doctor?

127
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:55,000
A stupid adult who doesn't
know how to grow up.

128
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,541
Does it hurt?

129
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,083
Ow! Ow, ow, ow,
ow, ow, ow, ow...

130
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,958
It doesn't look like
a normal bump.

131
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:06,708
I can't go to the
hospital like this.

132
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:11,500
[Naota mumbles]

133
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,291
Ow... Ow...

134
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,583
Guess I just need to hold it.

135
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:19,583
Ah! What'll I do in
school tomorrow?

136
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:23,500
Ow! Ow, ow, ow,
ow, ow, ow, ow...

137
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,250
[Gaku] Did you hear?
She was around yesterday!

138
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,833
--[Masashi] For reals?
--[Eri] That really
looks bizarre.

139
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,041
[Gaku] Yeah, isn't it awesome?

140
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,791
You're hiding
something, huh? C'mon.

141
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:32,833
Don't be such a brat.

142
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:35,541
Naota, Naota, didja hear?

143
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:36,916
--What?
--[Gaku] The Vespa Woman!

144
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Vespa?

145
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,291
"Vespa: 1. wasp, hornet"
A wasp woman?

146
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,583
She has a guitar.

147
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:41,791
And a cool Yuusaku bike.

148
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:42,833
Not exactly.

149
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:44,291
Some girl in the
other class had her

150
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,958
super spicy curry bread stolen.

151
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,250
Super spicy?

152
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,500
And when she stings,
she leaves a demon's mark

153
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,041
that shows you've been
doing naughty things,

154
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,791
and it never goes away!

155
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,208
What naughty things?

156
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,291
Uh, well...

157
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,250
Like something
really perverted.

158
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,750
Gyah! Perverted?

159
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,375
So, what's that mark?

160
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,083
It's the mark of the demon!

161
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,291
[Masashi] Really? Let me see.

162
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,875
[Naota] There's nothing
to see. Cut it out!

163
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:07,916
[Gaku] Didja see her, Naota?

164
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,916
[Masashi] Did she sting ya?

165
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,958
[Gaku] Pervert! He's a pervert!

166
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,208
[Naota] What are
you talking about?

167
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,166
[Gaku] Pervert!

168
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,291
[Naota's voice] Nothing
amazing happens here.

169
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,250
Everything is ordinary.

170
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:20,875
So it's not a punishment, like
when I go see Samejima Mamimi.

171
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,833
It's just something I always do.

172
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,666
It's ordinary.

173
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,458
After school, I decided
to go to the hospital.

174
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:32,000
I didn't wanna think
about Vespa Woman.

175
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:37,541
[Haruko] Hmm, yeah,
this is just right.

176
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,333
Has a good feel, too.

177
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,916
So what happened
yesterday after I left?

178
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,458
Did something happen?

179
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,625
Hey, something
did happen, right?

180
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,166
Like something weird?

181
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,958
I don't know what
you're talking about.

182
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:51,541
What's that? A pimple?

183
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:54,375
Looks kind of sick. Putrefied.

184
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:58,333
You're not hiding
something, are you? Ah--

185
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,000

from trying too hard.

That's a lie. I never
heard that before.

193
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:26,833
[Nurse] Yeah, I lied.

194
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,875
[Nurse/Haruko] So
what is the truth...

[Haruko and Naota yell]

00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,416
Ah! What are you
doing in the hospital?

about my brother.

He was batting and I was
dazzled by his swing.

It seemed impossible
that anything

could have been so perfect.

[Kamon] Ah, I just hired
her to work for us.

Her name's Haruhara.

[Haruko] Haruko. Pleasure.

228
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,625
[Kamon] I got run over,
you know. Smashed.

229

[Naota] By her Vespa?

230

shoulda killed him.

we got you a live-in

housekeeper out
of it, didn't we?

00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,041
[Naota] Are you
feeling okay, Grandpa?

234
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,125
I mean-- You got a housekeeper?

235

A housekeeper?

236
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,333
[Haruko] I was watching Taro-kun

who was making out with
a high school girl.

I'm not Taro!

240

you're fooling around with?

Huh? Huh?

244
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,208
[Naota] Ma-Mamimi. We
were down at the river!

does it like a weasel.

She's cursed I tell ya.

248
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,166
[Kamon] Ah, your
brother is away,

249
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,916
so she's sinking her
fangs into you, Naota.

250
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,500
Fondling around. Fooling
around. Fooly cooly!

251

What's fooly cooly?

252

[Naota] How should I know?
I'm still in grade school.

253
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:03,666
You think I'm that crazy?

254
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:07,750
[Kamon] Ha ha... Ha, ha, ha!

255
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:10,333
That's what it is,

--[Kamon] It's that
Tomino-esque thing...

saying it's Gundam,
but basically,

258
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,166
it's giant robot anime, right?

259
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,916
[Naota] I don't know
what you're talking about!

I know he's doing it.

impressive, little bro.

a lovely young wife.

Ooh hoo hoo hoo! Cooly cooly!

with your hands, see?

275
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,666
[Haruko] Oh, right.

276
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,041
I'm already in that kinda
relationship with Takkun here.

279
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,791

Cooly cooly cooly...

282

[Haruko] I told you to
shut up about that!

283
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,500

in the same house,

fooly cooly, I see.

it's fooly or cooly?

286
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,333
[Kamon] But you're
still thinking about

291
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:19,208
you must be hiding it underneath
this Band-Aid, aren't you?

292
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,166
[Naota] Aah! I'm not
hiding anything!

--I made a total pig of myself.

bread is delicious!

chatter indistinctly]

299
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,541
[Naota] They're in a good mood.

300
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:36,500
Oh, well... They
say they're making

301
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:40,250
some kinda medical
machines or something.

302
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:44,708
Yeah. Uh-uh. I don't
know that yet.

303
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,250
Yes, that's true.

304
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,541
You got a point.

305
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,250
The channel is
imperfect, and the kid

306
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,666
I found here is pretty useless.

307
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,208
Uh--

Ask before you come in.

310
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:07,458
I see the bottom's yours,
so I'll sleep on top.

311
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:09,708
Really?

312
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:12,333
Who are you, and
what do you want?

313
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,416
I'm just a wandering
housekeeper.

314
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,666
Tell me the truth.

315
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,916
I'm an alien.

316
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,166
Right, and this afternoon
you were a nurse.

317
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,000
What's underneath the Band-Aid?

318
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,791
[Naota gasps]
You're really...freaky.

319
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:28,083
Under the Band-Aid,
what's it like? Tell me.

320
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,083
I don't know.

321
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,125
You're lying.

322
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,583
You saw it.

323
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,458
Something strange is happening.

324
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,708
What are you hiding
under the Band-Aid?

325
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,000
You did it, didn't you?

326
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,458
You should know
about your own head.

327
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:39,875
Because you hit me there!

328
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,875
[Haruko] Let's see it!

329
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,250
[Naota] You came
here with my father!

330
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,083
Why don't you go
stay with him?!

331
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,541
What do you want?

332
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:59,500
You're the one I
saw first, Takkun.

333
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,583
Anyway, the top bunk
is my brother's,

334
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,541
so no one else can sleep there.

335
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,666
[Naota] That's the way it is.

336
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,500
So, how old is your brother?

337
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,666
Where is he?

338
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,166
[Naota] America.

339
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,500
[Haruko] Why?

340
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:19,708
[Naota] Baseball.

341
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:22,583
[Haruko] Oh, he's really
a good player, huh?

342
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,166
Ah! You're sleeping here?

343
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,375
Is this where you're
sleeping, huh?

344
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:28,916
It's the only place.

345
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,875
The top belongs to
your brother, right?

346
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,291
[Naota shudders]

347
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,750
[Naota] Aw, she's
playin' with my head.

348
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:37,833
[Kamon] Naota-kun.

349
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,083
[Naota] Huh?

350
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:42,083
[Kamon] We need to talk.

351
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,541
[Naota] About what?

352
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,291
[Kamon] About Haruko-san.

353
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,875
You're against her
staying here, aren't you?

354
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,708
Do whatever you want.

355
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:55,708
Hm. I named you
"Naota" for honesty.

356
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:59,625
So it would appear...
you were run over too.

357
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,958
[Naota] Mamimi was here?

358
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,958
[Kamon] She asked for
some of the day-old bread

359
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,958
we've got on sale.

360
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:09,250
It's a Mimi type of thing.
A dreamy type of thing.

361
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:13,583
Is Mamimi's family poor,
would you say? Huh?

362
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,125
[Naota pants]

363
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,416
He's alright.

364
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,958
[meow]

365
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:37,291

growing louder]

366

[Naota pants]

367
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,833
[Mamimi] He gave me... a lot.

368
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,875
[Naota] Did he
send you a letter?

369
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:04,583
[Naota] Hasn't he
contacted you at all?

370
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:11,750
[Naota] My brother. I mean,
how much do you like him?

371
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,291
[Mamimi] It's hard.

372
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,291
You saw the sign at our bakery.

373
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,041
That bread's old.

374
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:30,458
Watermelon.

375
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,083
[Naota] Hm?

376
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:35,333
[Mamimi] Or like a
panda with a mean face.

377
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:38,416
Or like sandals with pressure
points drawn on them.

378
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,250
Or the smell of a
blackboard eraser.

379
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:44,958
Or a Sunday morning where
you wake up and it's raining.

380
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:48,791
Well, I like him more
than hard bread.

381
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,708
[Naota] Why don't you stop that?

382
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,333
[Naota] You know, he has a...

383
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:01,541
Oh, no.

384
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:04,750
[Haruko moans]

385
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,125
Ah? An American girlfriend.

386
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:06,666
"I got me a blonde gal!"
Ah? An American girlfriend.

387
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,833
[Mamimi groans]

388
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:12,666
No, I must respect your
brother's privacy.

389
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,958
Huh? Uh-oh.

390
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,458
Hey, what's the matter?

391
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:19,791
[Mamimi] I'm gonna overflow.

392
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,041
Huh?

393
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,458
[Mamimi] I'm gonna overflow!

394
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:23,666

Aahhh!

00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:49,500
Aahh!

404
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,666

What's going on?

00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:05,333
[Naota wails]

413
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,250
Ah!

[Naota coughs] Haruko!

00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:44,333
[Haruko yells]

421
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:50,875
Wow.

422
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,708
[Naota's voice]
As soon as I said that,

423
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:54,833
I knew I shouldn't have.

424
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:57,666
In that moment,
just for a flash,

425
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,833
she looked like my brother.

426
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,833
--[Naota] Hey, I'm
stuck on this thing.
--[Haruko] Butta. Butta.

427
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,750
--Hey, come on!
--Where is he?

428
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,708
Unhook me, will ya?

"Store reopened
as of today-Management"

430
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:17,166
[Naota] Anyway,
the Band-Aid came off.

431
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,958
The horn is gone.

432
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:20,875
Nothing amazing.

433
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,708
You have to roll
the dough smooth

434
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,750
or the bread'll be lumpy.

435
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,208
--Now get it right this time.
--[Naota's voice] Only the
ordinary happens here.

436
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,458
[Haruko] You call that bread?

437
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,208
[Naota] I gotta go.

441
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:41,375
[Mamimi] You didn't have
to run all the way. Here.

442
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:42,958
[Naota] Huh?

443
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:54,375
[Naota] But I said I
don't like sour stuff.

[Haruko's voice] The
advance is hip right now,

but the original has
a place in my heart.

Unlike Pocket, there was
only the plastic gray.

Though color had killer app use

465

for things like
the sewing machine,

466
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:34,375
not much use for
virtual anymore, huh?
