1
00:00:07,291 --> 00:00:08,083
Hai!

2
00:00:09,583 --> 00:00:12,416
[Miyaji] Let's have a fun
lunchtime using chopsticks.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,125
Regular use of
chopsticks can help prevent

4
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:18,333
Alzheimer's disease
for grandpa and grandma.

5
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:20,166
Hai!

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,625
That's because chopsticks
exercise your brains.

7
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:24,916
You can do it

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,083
just...like...this...

9
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:33,541
Hai!

10
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,958
[Class] Time to eat.

11
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:40,541
We always used to use sporks.

12
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:42,958
[Gaku] Sporks? You mean
those fork-spoon things?

13
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:44,916
Yeah, sporks
are better for sure.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,208
You use 'em too?

15
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:47,833
You like sporks better?

16
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:49,250
[Gaku] Those plastic things
in the cafeteria?

17
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,625
"How to Use Chopsticks"

18
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:52,625
Hai!

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,041
[Miyaji] Ow! Ow! My finger
is cramped! My finger!

20
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:59,833
Is something wrong...
with Miya-jun?

21
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:01,583
--[Masashi] Where's Naota going?
--[Miyaji] It's bent... 
the wrong way.

22
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:03,416
[Eri] To get some sporks.

23
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:08,166
[Gaku] Oh, you think
he's gonna get some?

24
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,541
I dunno.

25
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:11,583
Whatever.

26
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:18,250
[Naota's Voice] Ever since that
day, the smoke has continued

27
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:21,250
to pour out of
the Medical Mechanica factory.

28
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:24,125
the town is completely covered
in white mist.

29
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:27,041
You can't see
the sky or the stars.

30
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:29,958
It's almost like,
outside of this town,

31
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:32,333
nothing else exists anymore.

32
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:35,333
A town where you can't
go beyond the edge.

33
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:38,125
The gigantic hand says,
"Stay where you are.

34
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:39,541
You have no choice."

35
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:41,458
It's like the
right hand of a judge

36
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:45,458
or a prison warden about to give
the signal for an execution.

37
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,375
"We have stopped serving
super spicy curry bread."

38
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,750
When Haruko and Canti vanished,

39
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:53,583
I wondered if
they went out there...

40
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:55,416
to the outside world.

41
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,958
Somewhere.

42
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:59,125
"Haruhara Haruko (19)
Canti (Robot)"

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,875
[Kitsurubami]
It's a hand, isn't it?

44
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:03,166
[Amarao] It's a hand.

45
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,000
[Kitsurubami]
Do you think it'll grab it?

46
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:08,750
I think that it
wants to grab it.

47
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:12,250
But, I mean, that's just 
so obvious, isn't it?

48
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,666
A hand grabbing an iron?

49
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,583
[Amarao] Well, that's
just the way it is.

50
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,750
[Kitsurubami] Does it want
to iron out the wrinkles?

51
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:21,000
[Amarao] Of what?

52
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,208
[Kitsurubami] Like
the wrinkles on the brain.

53
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:24,416
You know?

54
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,583
[Amarao] Then we'd all
be brainless morons.

55
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:27,833
Those wrinkles
are how we think.

56
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:29,166
What?

57
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,250
But of course you know
the real psycho is Raharu.

58
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,250
She's always been like that.

59
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:38,291
The parameters aren't
completely clear yet.

60
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,458
If that's the terminal core

61
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:42,583
that's going to
control the hand,

62
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,833
then of course
it wouldn't activate yet.

63
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:47,250
Ah, what did I do?!

64
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,083
That's right,
forget about Haruhara.

65
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,083
We have to find him.

66
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:51,916
Track down the terminal core.

67
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,958
Before the plan activates.

68
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:59,791
"FLCLimax"

69
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:05,083
[Mamimi] Takkun.

70
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:09,125
Takkun, where'd you go?

71
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,750
[Gaku] Who thought up
sporks anyway?

72
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,291
[Masashi] I dunno.

73
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,333
[Gaku] Huh? Look over there.

74
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,875
Naota's wife.

75
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:47,333
Naota, you just
gonna leave her there?

76
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,541
Well, you're energetic.

77
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,250
[Amarao] Drinking the
bitter ones, huh?

78
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,333
That makes you feel grown-up?

79
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:57,833
The brain needs glucose.

80
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:01,750
If you wanna get your head back
to normal, try something sweet.

81
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,125
You're tired, aren't you?

82
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,916
Every time something
comes out of your head

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,833
it creates problems
for everyone.

84
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:12,250
Well, I don't think your
housekeeper is gonna come back,

85
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,000
but just in case...

86
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,666
Cats should stick with
other cats. It's only natural.

87
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,583
That high school girl
looked kinda sad.

88
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,166
Seems like a little
kindness might help,

89
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,833
but you'd need some maturity
to treat her that way.

90
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,708
Do you know why Raharu
got so close to you?

91
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:35,958
Oh, you know her as Haruko,
but Raharu's her real name.

92
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:39,375
Well, her target is
an astral being named "Atomsk."

93
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:42,791
I've never met him, but there
are rumors. Lots of rumors.

94
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,208
they say he has so much N.O.

95
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,666
that he can steal
whole star systems.

96
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,458
That's why they call him
the "Pirate King."

97
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,583
Normally, he and Raharu
would be mortal enemies,

98
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,125
but there's a catch.

99
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,541
Atomsk was captured
by Medical Mechanica,

100
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:59,125
so Raharu came
to this planet to rescue him.

101
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,333
Why?

102
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:03,041
She's in love with him.

103
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,708
Sempai's phone number!

104
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,833
Hey, don't!

105
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,375
Stop it!

106
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,750
You can have it.

107
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:00,833
Alright, but you're
responsible then.

108
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:03,625
From now on,
your name is Takkun.

109
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,625
[Kamon] Nao, dinner.

110
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,625
[Naota] Ahh! It's you!

111
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,291
[Kamon] Why are you yelling?

112
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,875
[Shigekuni]
Hurry up and sit down.

113
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,041
[Haruko] Hi.

114
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,833
[Naota] You're--

115
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,416
What are you doing just sitting
there like nothing happened?

116
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,166
You're a fugitive.
You're wanted.

117
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,833
[Kamon] Ah, I forgot to mention,
Haruko-san asked me

118
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,083
for a little time off.

119
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,125
[Shigekuni] She went to Hawaii.

120
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:05,083
[Shigekuni] She brought back
some spicy fish eggs.

121
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,708
[Naota] They don't
come from Hawaii,

122
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,291
and why would
she get them there?

123
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,708
And why would a wanted criminal
take a vacation?

124
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,750
[Haruko] Vacation, alienation,
Japanimation, manga, kanga,

125
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,291
naked lunch,
Hawaiian Punch, fruit juicy.

126
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,416
It's not funny.
I'm gonna kill you!

127
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,625
[Naota] Why me? It was
your stupid joke.

128
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,625
[Haruko] Well, if I ever
do take a vacation,

129
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,041
I wanna be all alone
with Takkun.

130
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,541
[Naota] As if I'd go with you.

131
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:30,375
[Haruko] Ah, you're embarrassed,
you little brat.

132
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,791
[Naota] Stop!
Don't noogie noogie!

133
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,625
[Haruko] The people's
crotch attack!

134
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,625
[Naota] Don't noogie noogie
there, or you'll-

135
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:40,750
[Shigekuni] She can doodlie
doodlie me like that any time.

136
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,791
[Kamon] I knew it, fooly
coolying all over the place.

137
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,291
What about me?

138
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:47,916
Frooly drooly head. Googly
googly eyes. Fooly cooly this.

139
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,500
Fooly cooly fooly cooly

140
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,458
fooly cooly fooly cooly

141
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,541
fooly cooly fooly cooly

142
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:54,375
fooly cooly

143
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:57,333
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

144
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,083
That's enough now, huh?

145
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,583
Let's just stay with anime.

146
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,375
--[Naota] Anime?
--[Shigekuni] That's exhausting.

147
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,333
It's hard to
be in manga form.

148
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,583
Takes time and
it's a lot of work.

149
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:10,791
After the first episode,

150
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,750
they said not to do
the manga thing again,

151
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:15,125
but then we get accused
of being lazy, right?

152
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,333
What do you mean, right?

153
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,625
Quit fooling around,
it's not cool you know?

154
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,375
Fooly cooler.

155
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,458
Fooly cooly.

156
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:27,500
Naota, it's time
to lay it on the line.

157
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,000
What does fooly cooly mean?

158
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,041
I don't know.

159
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,625
C'mon, you have to know.

160
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,958
The main character
always knows stuff like that.

161
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,625
Tell us already, Naota.

162
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,041
Grandpa, too?

163
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:38,625
What is this?

164
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:41,041
Who cares about
furi-kuri anyway?

165
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,583
Furi!

166
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,666
Why are you hitting me
with that thing?

167
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,708
[Haruko] Furi furi-kuri!

168
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,333
Furi-kuri furi-kuri.

169
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,208
[Naota] Ah! I don't get it!

170
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,833
[Shigekuni] That stuff
makes me constipated.

171
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:05,750
[Haruko, Kamon and Shigekuni
chatter indistinctly]

172
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,458
[Naota] They're in a good mood.

173
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,291
[Naota] Are you asleep?

174
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,250
Who are you, really?

175
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,125
What are you?

176
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,333
Where did you come from?

177
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:43,833
Were you just about to confess
your great love for me?

178
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,791
I didn't know you were awake.

179
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,833
How embarrassing.

180
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,291
Why'd you come back anyway?

181
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,000
Just to see you.

182
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,541
Your head's the only one
that works, Takkun.

183
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,166
You're a liar.

184
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,583
It's the truth.

185
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,791
[Naota] Are you
gonna go away again?

186
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,166
[Haruko] Wanna come with me?

187
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:13,666
You wanna throw everything away
and come with me?

188
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,833
You mean it?

189
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,708
Why are you being so nice?

190
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,875
Come on, Takkun. You're
still just a kid, you know?

191
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,416
[Naota] Where did you go?

192
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,375
You left without
saying anything.

193
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,333
[Naota's voice]
When you're in a town like this,

194
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:38,833
all covered with smoke,

195
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:41,791
you forget that there's
a world outside.

196
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,041
Nothing amazing happens here.

197
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,291
And you get used to that.

198
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:51,083
Used to a world
where everything is ordinary.

199
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,625
Every day we spend here

200
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:56,416
is like a whole lifetime
of dying slowly.

201
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,250
But now Haruko is here.

202
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:03,333
That's how I know there
really is a world outside.

203
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:15,416
[Mamimi] 
Takkun. Takkun,

204
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,791
I brought some more
for you, Chief.

205
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,208
Takkun.

206
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:50,666
[Miyaji] Alright, I'm going to
raise it ten more centimeters.

207
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,708
[Masashi] That's bad.

208
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,125
[Eri] What's bad?

209
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:55,166
[Masashi] Really bad.
He hasn't been home for days,

210
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,375
that's what I heard.

211
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:58,833
--[Miyaji] Next person!
--[Eri] He ran away?

212
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,291
[Gaku] Maybe he eloped
with that older girl,

213
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,000
you know the kiss kiss one.

214
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,375
[Gaku] Miya-jun's
going to his house.

215
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:13,291
Teacher-parent conference to
see where Naota put his brain.

216
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,708
[Eri] All he needs to do
is say what he really feels.

217
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,666
That's what I did.
Then I cried and stuff.

218
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,375
Huh?

219
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:19,541
To who?

220
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,541
To my mother and father.

221
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:23,583
[Both] Father?

222
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,666
[Kitsurubami] It's normally
connected to this contact unit,

223
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,666
but we found it like this.

224
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,625
[Amarao] That means the core
is functioning independently.

225
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,125
I understand your whole team
saw the document.

226
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,875
[Kitsurubami] Yes, last week,
in the maintenance room.

227
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,875
This planet was nearly as
mangled as that thing.

228
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,666
And it will be yet
unless we handle

229
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,083
Medical Mechanica
very carefully.

230
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,208
Yeah, but don't you think
the Pirate King

231
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,208
has some plan to stop it?

232
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,958
I wouldn't count on it.

233
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,500
He's not one of us, you know.

234
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,083
We're not that close.

235
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:09,208
Anyway, we don't even know
where Atomsk disappeared to.

236
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:17,625
[Mamimi]
There's plenty for you to eat.

237
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:22,375
Every kid in my high school has
one of these things, ya know?

238
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:25,750
Maybe they're too small.

239
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,833
I think you need
bigger stuff now, huh Chief?

240
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,583
[Haruko] Blech.

241
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,625
I tried to tell you,
you can't get some off-brand

242
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,583
just 'cause it's jumbo sized.

243
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:41,875
You have to stay with
the good kind, like I said.

244
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,041
Trade!

245
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,333
When you act selfish like that,

246
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,416
bad things are bound
to happen, you know.

247
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:51,041
Oh well. I'll have to deal
with the bad things then.

248
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,583
Think of it like this...

249
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:57,208
eating ramen that tastes really
bad can be kind of fun too.

250
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:01,750
Man, this smoke
is really obnoxious.

251
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:04,541
[Naota] You're always fighting
Medical Mechanica, right?

252
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:07,833
I mean, is that your job?

253
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,416
[Haruko] They took
something from me,

254
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,958
something I really want.
So I'm trying to get it back.

255
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:15,375
That's the deal.

256
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:16,500
[Naota] Can you do it?

257
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,250
[Haruko] As long as I have you.

258
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:22,250
[Naota] This really tastes bad.
Trade me back!

259
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,416
[Haruko] No way.

260
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,750
[Naota] Man, you're
as selfish as ever.

261
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,583
Yeah, that's the one, Chief.

262
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,416
I finally found it.

263
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,916
Now a little payback
for splashing me.

264
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,833
Go ahead. Eat up.

265
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:34,666
Come on, Chief.
Let's go find the next one.

266
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:33,000
Finally, I think I'll be able to
forgive all of them after this.

267
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,958
[Masashi]
Last night, you know Fuji?

268
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:38,000
Yeah, well his sister's
moped got hit too.

269
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,250
See ya later!

270
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,291
[Gaku] That yankee girl
with the bleached hair?

271
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,833
Fuji's older sister, you mean?

272
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,708
[Masashi] Everyone
from downtown over.

273
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:48,791
Their motorcycles are wrecked,
and their cars and bikes.

274
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:52,166
Hurry! Someone's
gonna see us.

275
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,958
[Gaku] What the-

276
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,375
It's Naota's wife,
the one he dumped.

277
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:02,250
What's that?

278
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,541
[Gaku] Is it something I said?

279
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:10,375
[Mamimi] Stop it! They're not on
my revenge list. Cut it out!

280
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:11,916
Be a good boy.

281
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,583
Takkun, don't eat their pickup!

282
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:25,833
Takkun! Why do you
do bad things like this?

283
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:28,125
That's my father's truck.

284
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,958
[Miyaji] A pupil should not
skip school for no reason.

285
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,791
[Kamon] Yes, I totally agree.

286
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:36,166
When I was in the 6th grade,
I was in charge of the hamster.

287
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,875
But I caught a cold
and I was absent,

288
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:40,250
so when I went back to school,
two or three days later,

289
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,416
it was dead.

290
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,125
Well, everyone made
a big deal about it,

291
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,541
calling me Hamster Killer.

292
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,625
But the kids who said that
had never once taken care

293
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,833
of a hamster in their lives.

294
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:52,375
--Did they even think about-
--[Miyaji] I'm talking about
your son. Can we stay focused?

295
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:56,375
Oh, right!
He'll be okay. Trust me.

296
00:18:56,458 --> 00:19:01,166
Unlike that hamster,
Naota's enjoying his freedom.

297
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,875
So, Kitsurubami,
what do you like to do

298
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,916
when you're off the clock?

299
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,625
I don't wanna
talk about that now.

300
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:08,875
[Amarao] Don't be so cold.

301
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:13,291
We're on the same team.
Come on, tell me.

302
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,083
[Kitsurubami] This is a problem.

303
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:18,125
[Amarao] This kind of problem
is nothing, trust me.

304
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:21,708
Commander!

305
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:24,041
Geez, it's huge!

306
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:27,375
Takkun, listen! You shouldn't
do things like this.

307
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:31,416
Takkun? You know what that is?
It's the terminal core!

308
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,958
She's been feeding it.

309
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,333
"Crossing"
It's him!

310
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:38,041
In a green skirt?

311
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,583
Why's he here?

312
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,833
[Amarao] That's it.
He's a component.

313
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:52,208
He's part of
the terminal core.

314
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,250
Then the hamster, Hamtaro...

315
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:05,166
[Miyaji] Ah! That's my new VW!

316
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,416
[Amarao] Get out of there!

317
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,708
[Haruko] Sleepy time's all over.

318
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,541
I can't get loose!

319
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:25,000
It's the climax!

320
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,500
[Kitsurubami] I-I-Is the bomb
going to activate?

321
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,875
[Amarao] Not yet,
it's still missing something.

322
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,416
I'm not sure what.

323
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,541
[Hakuro] Yahoo!

324
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:49,583
[Amarao] It's her.

325
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,500
[Amarao] Where are
your eyebrows?

326
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,458
Why did you take them off?

327
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,833
I told you not to trust her.

328
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,833
She's only thinking
about herself.

329
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,625
She doesn't care
what happens to you.

330
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,625
She doesn't care
what happens to anyone.

331
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,250
But you have family

332
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,750
and friends who live here.

333
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:22,583
And that high school girl,
you wanna save her, don't you?

334
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:25,333
Of course you do, that's normal.

335
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,958
You're thinking like an adult.

336
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,458
Come over here.

337
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:31,791
Don't let her manipulate you.

338
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:39,916
What are you doing? How much
pain before you realize?

339
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,708
Are you out
of your mind? You brat.

340
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:49,291
Takkun, it's time
to get what I want,

341
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,291
but I need your help, k?

342
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:56,791
[Hakuro] Alright, get ready.

343
00:21:56,875 --> 00:22:01,250
--[Amarao] Don't do it!
--[Hakuro] Lunch time!

344
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,708
Ah! We're screwed.

345
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:15,458
[Amarao] This is insane.

346
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:18,916
You're doing exactly what
Medical Mechanica wants.

347
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,500
They're flattening planets
all over the galaxy,

348
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:24,458
smoothing out the wrinkles
so you can't think.

349
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:27,208
Even the Pirate King
has been captured.

350
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:29,541
They're using him
to lure you in.

351
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:34,375
It's over. It's all over.

352
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:38,208
I said I don't care
about any of that.

353
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:40,125
I just want Atomsk,
that's all.

354
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:42,333
I don't care
what happens to this planet.

355
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:45,083
They'll have to learn
to think smooth, I guess.

356
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:51,375
[Amarao] See? She tricked you!
I tried to tell you!

357
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:55,416
Why wouldn't you believe me? I
can't hold on to these wrinkles.

358
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:09,083
Commander! Commander Amarao!

359
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:23,125
Here he is.

360
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,208
The kid. Did he do it?

361
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:44,541
He got the powers
of the Pirate King, Atomsk.

362
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:53,541
Takkun, you can't do that.

363
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:55,541
That power's mine.

364
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,333
[Haruko] Don't get in my way
or you'll regret it.

365
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:12,958
This is our chance.
We can gather the outsiders

366
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:14,500
and get rid
of them all at once.

367
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:17,208
[Haruko] I'm not gonna go
easy on you, Takkun.

368
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:21,125
Only one of us can eat him,
and that's gonna be me.

369
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:30,750
That guitar.

370
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,000
She's just as bad
as Medical Mechanica.

371
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:41,291
You're not going to
get what you want from her.

372
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:43,208
Fight back! Take her out!

373
00:24:56,833 --> 00:24:58,166
I love you.

374
00:25:18,166 --> 00:25:19,416
[Haruko] Atomsk!

375
00:25:23,916 --> 00:25:24,916
What is that thing?

376
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,375
What's going on,
oh man, look!

377
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:39,666
N.O.

378
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:47,083
I lost him again
because of you, Takkun.

379
00:26:47,166 --> 00:26:48,625
We couldn't pull it off.

380
00:26:50,416 --> 00:26:51,833
Wanna come along?

381
00:26:54,041 --> 00:26:56,500
Know what? Forget it.

382
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:59,291
'Cause you're
still a kid, Takkun.

383
00:26:59,375 --> 00:27:01,208
Save it for next time.

384
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:40,166
[Naota's voice] So long, Naota.

385
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,833
That's what Mamimi said
when she left school.

386
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:49,125
[Naota] You could've asked me
before you picked that one.

387
00:27:49,208 --> 00:27:50,083
Ninamori?

388
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:51,625
There's no practice today?

389
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:55,375
You know what, Naota?

390
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:57,500
That uniform looks
really stupid on you.

391
00:27:57,583 --> 00:27:59,166
Yeah? What about you?

392
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,708
Here.

393
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:03,416
[Naota] I can't drink that.
It's too carbonated.

394
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,041
[Eri] You really are
still a kid.

395
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:10,041
[Naota's voice] Nothing
amazing happens here.

396
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:12,208
Everything is ordinary.

397
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:17,166
We crossed the bridge
as usual,

398
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:20,916
and before we knew it,
the seasons had changed.

399
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,291
Mamimi left town.

400
00:28:23,375 --> 00:28:26,208
She said she wanted
to be a photographer.

401
00:28:26,291 --> 00:28:28,750
I don't know what
happened to her after that.
