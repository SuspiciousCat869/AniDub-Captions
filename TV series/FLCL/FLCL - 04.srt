1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,083
Yeeah... Ahh!

2
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:14,458
[yells]

3
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:18,583
[Haruko] Oh, yeah. Uh-huh.

4
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:21,958
Thank you, thank you.

5
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:24,375
[Player] Ah, it's
comin' outta left field.

6
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,250
[sighs]

7
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:28,541
That girl is brutal.

8
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:29,750
Every single time at bat,

9
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:31,500
she had an
out-of-the-park homerun.

10
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:33,458
"Mars"
You know the last one she hit?

11
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:35,875
I think it escaped
the earth's gravity.

12
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:38,208
Where the hell'd
she come from anyway?

13
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:39,291
"Fire"
Do you know, coach?

14
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:40,500
[grumbling]

15
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,458
[Haruko] Yes, thank you.

16
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:46,375
Hey there, do you have
any other hidden talents?

17
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:49,041
Haruko-san's a
pain in the old rear.

18
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:50,458
[Long-haired player]
Haruko?

19
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:51,875
[Shigekuni] It's pathetic.
Pathetic, do you hear me?

20
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:53,458
That our team, the Martians,

21
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:55,916
who are supposed to explode
with the eruptions of Olympus,

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,333
couldn't get a single run.

23
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,083
[Baseball Player 3]
Situation beyond our control.

24
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:02,416
With Tasuku-chan in the U.S.,
we're out our best player.

25
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,666
[Baseball Player 4]
Yeah, it's been like this

26
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,541
since they built that
new medical plant thing.

27
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:07,291
[Shigekuni] You're not trying
hard enough, that's the problem.

28
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:09,625
[Baseball Player 4] The ability
to try hard's a talent, too.

29
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:11,416
[Baseball Player 3] We only
had Tasuku-chan's bat.

30
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,541
[Baseball Player 5] The only
help we got is his brother,

31
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:15,083
if you call that help.

32
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:19,708
[Players]
C'mon kid, you can do it!

33
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:21,958
[Shigekuni] Go!

34
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:23,625
[Umpire] Strike!

35
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,000
[Naota yells]

36
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:30,166
[groaning]

37
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,500
[Umpire] Dead!

38
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:33,833
Dead ball!

39
00:01:33,916 --> 00:01:35,208
[Long-haired player]
Who knows if he's any good,

40
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:36,791
he hasn't swung
the bat all game.

41
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:38,458
[Baseball Player 5]
So much for Olympus.

42
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:40,333
This is an extinct volcano.

43
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:42,208
[Baseball Player 3]
Aw, we need a star player...

44
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:44,791
to do for our team what
she's doing for theirs.

45
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:47,916
[flabbergasted]

46
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:53,916
[Everyone]
Huh?

47
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:02,500
Is that even possible?
Check it out!

48
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:04,333
Tomorrow's game is in the bag.

49
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,875
[laughing]

50
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:09,333
[Shigekuni]
Now we have a secret weapon.

51
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:16,083
[Everyone cheering]

52
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:20,875
It looks good on you.

53
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:22,833
New style? The bandage look?

54
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:23,833
Whatever.

55
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:25,208
I don't care about baseball.

56
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,750
You are a big liar.

57
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:31,250
Cut it out. Hey!

58
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,083
[motorcycle engine]

59
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,250
[Haruko] Anyway...

60
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:43,291
Nothing can happen
'til you swing the bat.

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,041
"Full Swing"

62
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:07,125
I'm back.

63
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:08,083
Grub?

64
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:09,833
Hey, welcome home, Naota-kun.

65
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:11,541
Dinner'll be ready soon, okay?

66
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,250
[Haruko moaning]

67
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:16,250
[Haruko] It hurts!

68
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,583
Not so hard.

69
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,375
[chopping]

70
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:24,666
[Kamon] Ah, I'm sorry,
Haruko-san.

71
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,416
What are you doing to her?

72
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,250
Yeah, right there.

73
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,625
Your chin hair is-

74
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,250
Electric massage really works.

75
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,041
Anything wrong?

76
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,500
You're all sweaty.

77
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,750
You could at least change
out of your uniform.

78
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:42,583
Your uniform's not
sweaty. Wonder why.

79
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:45,458
Oh, I'm too tired to
hold a pair of chopsticks.

80
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,583
Why you playing for their team?
You don't even live there.

81
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,041
What's up with that?

82
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,541
Part-time job.

83
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:53,500
I thought I should help out
with the electric bill here.

84
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,708
[groaning]

85
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,583
[Kamon] Here, Haruko-san.

86
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:01,458
[Both moaning suggestively]

87
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,833
[Naota] What are you doing?

88
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,208
[Haruko] You're the one
I met first.

89
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:07,791
[innocently] Hmmm?

90
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,666
[Naota] Just forget it.

91
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,250
Aren't you going
to have dinner?

92
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,166
Come on, we're
having your favorite:

93
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,708
genetically altered
fermented soybeans.

94
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:21,375
[thud]

95
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:27,875
[Amarao] Oh man.

96
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,333
Don't hit it with
a baseball bat.

97
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:35,000
Try a baguette, you know,
a loaf of French bread.

98
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,625
Huh?

99
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,166
[Amarao] This is your home,
right?

100
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,041
And it's also a bakery?

101
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:41,958
"Super-spicy"
Super spicy, huh?i

102
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,791
Didn't carry this
before, did you?

103
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,166
[distant moaning]
You ever feel like there's

104
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,500
a lot of extra unwanted
stuff in your life?

105
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,791
People should be
more ambiguous.

106
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,375
You agree?

107
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,791
I don't know.

108
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,708
[Amarao] As you force yourself
to eat the spicy bread,

109
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,750
you get addicted to it. Right?

110
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,250
I hate that stuff.

111
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,625
It's terrible.

112
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,125
Really?

113
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:04,333
But it seems that she's addicted
to you in a certain sense.

114
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,083
[Amarao] Any idea why?

115
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,958
[Naota] Those eyebrows.

116
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,958
Playing it close to the vest?

117
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:14,166
That means you're smart.

118
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,625
Word to the wise: don't tell
too many people about her.

119
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,250
You'll find out what you're
dealing with eventually.

120
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,458
She's a menace. Enough said.

121
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:24,291
[Kamon and Haruko
giggling and moaning]

122
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,583
Can I have a receipt for this?

123
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:28,250
"Mabase"

124
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,333
Older women can have
a very strong effect.

125
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:33,458
A very painful effect.

126
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,416
[Haruko laughing distantly]

127
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,666
[Kamon] Oh, Haruko-san.

128
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:40,166
[Haruko upchucking]

129
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,083
[Naota] Adults are
really stupid.

130
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,583
[Mamimi] Did you
have an argument?

131
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,458
[Naota] I'm not going
to argue with her.

132
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:46,458
[Mamimi chuckling]

133
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,500
That's very mature
of you, Chief.

134
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:49,916
[Naota] What are you
trying to say?

135
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,416
[Mamimi] Why you in
such a bad mood?

136
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,625
Huh, Takkun?

137
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,333
I wanna leave my mark again.

138
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,125
Batting practice at sunset?

139
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:03,833
Do you want me
to be your coach?

140
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,291
No, thanks!

141
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,791
I could teach you how.

142
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,041
[Naota] Go play some more
games with my dad.

143
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,500
Leave me alone.

144
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,833
[Haruko] We're in this together.

145
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:19,500
Your head is the only
one that works, Takkun.

146
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:22,458
You'll be able to hit
a homerun soon. Promise!

147
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,041
[Haruko] Yeah, yeah, that's
the right stance.

148
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,250
But, you have
to swing the bat.

149
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,333
[surprised]

150
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,750
Hit it into the sky.
Don't hold back.

151
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,291
Before he swings the bat,

152
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:42,416
a real slugger imagines
an arc inside his heart.

153
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,708
Arching directly to Heaven.

154
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:48,458
There. That star'd
make a perfect target.

155
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,708
It's kinda flickery
though. See?

156
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,208
[Female voice] Heat tolerances
are above scale.

157
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,166
[Male voice] Tracking sub-light
velocity and gaining.

158
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,458
[Female voice]
Atmospheric approach.

Imminent.

increased by a factor of ten.

162
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,166
[Female voice] It has
entered the atmosphere.

163
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,958
Minus 2200.

164
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,666
[Kitsurubami] Alright, we have
it on screen.

165
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,708
It's been ten
hours since impact.

166
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:18,000
We experienced a
total loss of control.

167
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,833
After it cause
irreparable damage

168
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,291
to sectors six through eleven

169
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,125
and displaced all
three antennas,

170
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:24,708
including the spare,

171
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:27,041
it made a quantum leap into
the central processing sector

172
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,750
and scored a direct
hit on the core unit.

173
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,458
This is satellite Shiosaki,

174
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:34,083
it's proceeding with its
self-programmed attack.

175
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,458
Commander Amarao?

176
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:40,083
No, I'm pretty sure
it's not poisonous.

177
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,708
[Female voice] It's
going into freefall.

178
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,250
"Shigekuni's"
It's Kitsurubami, right?

179
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,833
Can you dispose of this?

180
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:47,750
Sir?

181
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,166
[Amarao] You didn't know?

182
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,666
Well now you do.
I don't like it spicy.

183
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:54,708
[Kitsurubami] Those eyebrows.

184
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,500
So, where's it going to fall?

185
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,750
Where'd she go now?

186
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,000
[Kamon and Haruko moaning]

187
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:19,125
[Kamon] Haruko-san.

188
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,250
[Haruko] Ah, look,
it's so pathetic.

189
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,166
[Kamon] Haruko-san.

190
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,416
[Haruko] C'mere.
I'm gonna stick it in.

191
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,416
[both moaning]

192
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,500
[Haruko] Why won't it stand up?

193
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:33,833
It's 'cause of this
extra layer thing.

194
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,500
[Haruko gasps]

195
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:40,333
[yells]

196
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:42,791
I got it.

197
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,625
We're locked on the beacon.

198
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:45,625
I knew it.

199
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,000
It's Mabase.

200
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,416
Huh?

201
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:51,916
[Kitsurunami] Eyebrows.

202
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,291
[Umpire] Play ball!

203
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:00,208
[Shigekuni] Alright!
Show no mercy!

204
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,291
[Baseball player] My mother
hits better than this guy.

205
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:07,583
[Mamimi] That must be the
Great Emperor of Fear I bet.

206
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,166
[Naota] What are you
talking about?

207
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,916
[Mamimi] Nostradamus
predicted it,

208
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,625
but he must have got lost.

209
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:13,875
Don't you think?

210
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,541
[horn beeping]

211
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:16,833
Haru-san!

212
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,125
The game is already
started, you guys.

213
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,291
Are you doing that
perverted stuff again?

214
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,041
You're the one
who's perverted.

215
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,708
Then let's get ready
and swing the bat.

216
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,000
You want Takkun?

217
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,083
But he's not the type

218
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,916
to actually swing
the bat, you know?

219
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,583
[Naota] I don't play baseball.

220
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,500
[Haruko] It's Canti's
first game today.

221
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:35,833
[Mamimi] Lord Canti?

222
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:36,875
[choking]

223
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,791
Wait up, I gotta see this!

224
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:45,541
Yeah, well those homeruns you
hit yesterday were no big deal.

225
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,750
And I don't want you
coaching me anymore!

226
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,125
[quiet footsteps]

227
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,166
[floor creaking]

228
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,375
[Kamon] Oh, I didn't know
you were here.

229
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,875
[Kamon] Uh-oh. Give me
a break, Haruko-san.

230
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,083
I told her not to
leave any marks.

231
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,333
[chuckling]

232
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,541
I didn't want
you to see them.

233
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,375
It makes... me blush.

234
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:31,208
You see, it's just
that Haruko-san and I

235
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,916
have that kind of relationship.

236
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,125
What kind?

237
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,125
[voice changing to Haruko's]
Mouth-to-mouth.

238
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,541
Mouse?

239
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:38,750
[meow]

240
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:41,000
[Haruko] You're the one
I saw first, Takkun.

241
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:44,500
[growling]

242
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,250
[Haruko] It has to be you,
Takkun.

243
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,666
That's how life is.

244
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,458
Sometimes you're the cat,
sometimes the mouse.

245
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:55,625
[Broken robotic voice] See, I
couldn't get myself up before.

246
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:58,500
It was all covered.
You understand.

247
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:01,333
But Haruko-san
fixed it for me.

248
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,333
I can walk now.

249
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,791
Now Takkun.

250
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:07,666
Shut up!

251
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,375
[crash]

252
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,500
Yaaa!

253
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,083
[screaming]

254
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:43,041
[Long-haired baseball player]
Like I said, she's brutal.

255
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,625
[Baseball player] She's doing
it on purpose, for sure.

256
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:46,291
[whistling]

257
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,583
[alarm]

258
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,083
Huh?

259
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,458
[Female Announcer] A state
of emergency has been declared

260
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:52,958
in Mabase City.

261
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:56,500
All citizens please evacuate
the city immediately.

262
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,416
Repeat. Evacuate at once.

263
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,166
This is an emergency.

264
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,375
[Amarao] Nandaba, Naota.

Father Nandaba, Kamon.
Owns a bakery. 47 years old.

267
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:12,000
Up until ten years ago, he
worked in publishing in Tokyo

268
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:15,166
where he was the assistant
editor of a subculture magazine.

269
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,666
One month ago,

270
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,583
an unknown woman identifying
herself as Haruhara Haruko

271
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:22,333
took up residence
in the same household.

272
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:25,625
You could have hit him
with a loaf of French bread.

273
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:28,458
I didn't hit him with anything.

274
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,791
That bat must've really hurt.

275
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,708
I didn't hit my father.

276
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,083
Have a drink.

277
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:37,458
I didn't hit anyone.

278
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,666
[splash]

279
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,958
Here. You like sweet things.

280
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,333
Sweet drinks
taste better, right?

281
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,000
I hit the television,
that's all I did.

282
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,125
You hit the TV.

283
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,083
It was an accident.

284
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,541
[Amarao] Mmm?

285
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:55,125
So you're the type of person
who can only use your bat

286
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,541
to swing at machines,
not on the field, huh?

287
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:58,666
On the field?

288
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,083
An older woman.
That's a big mistake.

289
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,291
Swinging my bat
out on the field?

290
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:04,916
Here you are, fighting
with your father

291
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
for a woman who's
not even worth it.

292
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,291
[Naota] Haruko has nothing
to do with this.

293
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:10,708
[Amarao] Haruko.

294
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,916
You call her by
her first name.

295
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,416
You must be very close.

296
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,708
[Naota] What do you care?

297
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,791
[Amarao] She's your batting
coach, isn't she?

298
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,333
[Naota] I hate her.

299
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,250
[Amarao] Do you like her...
swing?

300
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,583
[Naota] I told you. Haruko has
nothing to do with this.

301
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,541
Then why did you
hit him with that bat?

302
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:28,916
I didn't! I told you!

303
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,666
[Naota] You hit your
own television?

304
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,083
Yes, because I was--

305
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,750
[coffee spilling]

306
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:39,166
[Amarao] Because you were
jealous of Dad? Hmm?

307
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,541
Yes, that's it.

308
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,333
You were simply caught
in the middle of something.

309
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:47,833
I'm sure you've
heard her speak of

310
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:50,000
the Galaxy Space
Police Brotherhood

311
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,166
and the pirate lord, Atomsk.

312
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,708
Make sure you don't tell anyone
that you spoke to me here

313
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:55,875
or what we spoke about.

314
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,458
That's very important.

315
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:58,958
And that includes your father.

316
00:13:59,041 --> 00:13:59,791
Huh?

317
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,625
Well, she is very alluring.

318
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:02,791
It's not your fault.

319
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,833
You're just her
current victim.

320
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,000
Eyebrows.

321
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,416
[Amarao] What about eyebrows?

322
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,833
[Naota] N-Nothing.

323

[Female Annoncer] A state of
emergency has been declared

00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,041
in Mabase City.

325
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:23,875
All citizens, please evacuate
the city immediately.

326
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:26,333
Repeat. Evacuate at once.

327
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:27,833
No fooly cooly.

328
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,333
This is an emergency.

329
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,708
Please proceed in
an orderly fashion.

330
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:34,958
You are advised to
leave Mabase City at once.

331
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,500
A state of emergency
has been declared.

332
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:38,750
All citizens-

333
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:41,125
[buzzing]

334
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:41,916
[meow]

335
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,625
[yelling]

336
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,875
[freaking out]

337
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:57,500
[screaming and crashing]

338
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:58,041
Oh!

339
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,750
Oooh!

340
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:08,125
[Mamimi] Follow
the trembling thunder!

341
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:11,166
And the great rumble!

342
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:17,250
Welcome, Lord of Fear! Hail!

343
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,875
[laughing]

344
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:22,041
You see, it was worth
invoking his presence,

345
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,958
even after the
prediction failed.

346
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,833
[motorcycle engine]

347
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,000
[Kamon groans weakly]

348
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:41,250
I guess you prefer your real
father after all, huh Naota?

349
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:46,458
I wasn't any good
for Haruko-san at all.

350
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:49,666
She asked if she could use
my head and I gladly agreed,

351
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:53,416
but I guess
I actually died for a while.

352
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,666
[Amarao] N.O. utilizes
the right brain

353
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,791
and left brain's distinct
thought processes

354
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,625
to open up an
inter-dimensional channel,

355
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,291
capable of pulling
things through,

356
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,375
sometimes from
light years away,

357
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:05,750
in an instant.

358
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,958
But you can't just
use anyone's head.

359
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:11,750
You gotta find
the right one.

360
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:15,916
[Kamon] Yeah, yeah.

361
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,666
Haruko-san is not your
ordinary houseguest.

362
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:25,291
[crashing and screaming]

363
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,416
[Amarao] What you encountered
was a kind of high-tech

364
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,708
mannequin that looked
like your father.

365
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,166
The equivalent of
a vending machine.

366
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,458
When the chips are down,

367
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,916
few people can
really swing the bat.

368
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,166
Right now, there's
a satellite carrying a bomb,

369
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,291
falling rapidly
toward this city.

370
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,583
It's too late
for this evacuation.

371
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,291
No one will survive.

372
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,458
That's why I want you
to go home and tell her.

373
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,875
Tell her she's gotta hit
one more outta the park.

374
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:52,708
Tell her it's a request
from a hometown fan.

375
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,416
Yo.

376
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,333
[Naota] What's up with
this robot thing?

377
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,625
[Kamon] I'm embarrassed.

378
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,000
[Naota] Who're you really?

379
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,833
I'm an illusion
of your youth,

380
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:05,708
a manifestation of the feelings
in your adolescent part.

381
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,791
[Naota] Where'd you get
that line from? Anime?

382
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:11,500
There's a satellite coming down,
you know.

383
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:14,250
A double-header
takes a lot out of you.

384
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,541
Tell the hometown fan
that it's gonna be expensive.

385
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:20,041
I say we file a complaint!

386
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,416
No.

387
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,166
[Amarao] The satellite bomb
was our secret backup

388
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,958
in case of dire emergency.

389
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,416
We can't let it go public.

390
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,083
She really is a terror
though, isn't she?

391
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:30,833
Raharu.

392
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:31,750
[Kitsurubami] Raharu?

393
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,583
Haruha Raharu.

394
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:36,250
Her plan is to penetrate us,
the foreign embassy,

395
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,041
and the Medical Mechanica.

396
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,208
That's why she made
this whole thing happen.

397
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:43,333
And she's willing to destroy
a whole town to pull it off.

398
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,833
[Kitsurubami] That poor kid.

399
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,833
[yelling]

400
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:58,000
[Mamimi] If that thing
comes down here,

401
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,375
you think they'll
cancel school tomorrow?

402
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,000
[Naota] Isn't this where it's
heading?

403
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,875
[Haruko] This spot would have
the least amount of damage.

404
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,208
And here we go!

405
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,666
Hey!

406
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,666
What are you doing to me?

407
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,750
[Haruko] Just hold still.

408
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:19,875
Hey, I didn't know
boys felt like this inside.

409
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:22,666
[Naota] Ah, don't touch me there
from behind.

410
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:25,625
Ah, easy!

411
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,916
[screaming]

412
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
What are you waiting for?
Hurry up and pop it!

413
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:36,583
If I rush it won't pop!
Go slow.

414
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,458
What? What's that?

415
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:44,833
[Haruko] Your bat.

416
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,208
Impressive.

417
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,791
He's only a little kid.

418
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,125
Tracking altitude.

419
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,000
Now entering final descent.

420
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,083
Purge sequence initiate.

421
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,541
[explosion]

422
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,166
[Female voice] It's breaking
through the lower atmosphere.

423
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,166
[Haruko] Now, if you do it
just the way I showed you,

424
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,000
it'll be just perfect.

425
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,083
It's okay?

426
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,458
Hey, here it comes.

427
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,250
Keep your eye on it. Ready?

428
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,500
Ready?

429
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:23,625
That boy is-

430
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,583
That kid'll never pull it off.

431
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,333
Impact is imminent.

432
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,125
Huh? But... it's impossible.

433
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,000
Haruko? Haruko?

434
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:44,666
No, it's spinning.

435
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,208
It's a sinker.

436
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,625
Tasuku.

437
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,208
Maybe when the chips are down,

438
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,625
he's too scared
to swing the bat himself.

439
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:03,916
Depending on what he does,

440
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,708
to all you folks out there,
sayonara!

441
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,541
It's pushing him back.

442
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,166
He swung the bat.

443
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,375
Oh no! It's going to blow up!

444
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,458
Takkun.

445
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,750
He really swung the bat.

446
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,750
[Naota] By the time I realized
it, it was over.

447
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,000
I'd already done it.

448
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:36,083
The palm of my hand
still stings.

449
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,500
I wonder if Haruko
feels like this all the time.

450
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:49,875
[laughing]

451
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,208

The satellite achieved

00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:37,583
[Haruko] When you see
a John Woo film,

476
00:24:37,666 --> 00:24:40,541
it's comforting to know how
shallow the world really is.

477
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:42,666
The full force of
the manly coolness factor,

00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,916
with a piece of nose hair
sticking out from

479
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,333
the tiny crack between
manly and cool,

480
00:24:47,416 --> 00:24:50,875
exposes the thinness
of the male hormone factor.

481
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:54,375
Next, on FLCL, Episode 5:
"Brittle Bullet."

482
00:24:54,458 --> 00:24:56,250
It takes an idiot
to do cool things.

483
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:57,625
"Brittle Bullet"
That's why it's cool.
