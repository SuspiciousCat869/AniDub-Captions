1
00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:12,416
[Secretary smacks lips]

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,458
You handled that well.

3
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:17,333
The mayor was worried
you'd be upset,

4
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:20,125
but you listened very calmly.

5
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:23,500
I guess. Anyway, this is
between the two of them.

6
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:26,166
[Secretary] You're very
mature. It's impressive.

7
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,083
When I was your age, I didn't
understand things like this.

8
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:31,375
If they both want to split up,

9
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:33,541
then there's really
nothing I can do about it.

10
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,791
Well, that's very
level-headed of you.

11
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:37,416
Don't worry.
I won't do anything

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,250
to ruin your
father's reputation.

13
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:40,416
I promise.

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,125
It's okay. I'm not worried.

15
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,083
You seem like a smart secretary.

16
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:45,458
You slept over last night,

17
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:47,833
but you put on a different
suit this morning.

18
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:51,541
Well, well, that's
very observant.

19
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,916
[Secretary] And, uh,
you have extra clothes too.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,125
Why's that?

21
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:58,166
[Eri] It's a costume.
For the school play.

22
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,583
I got the lead role!

23
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:04,583
"Marquis de Carabas"

24
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:09,666
[engine revving noise
in the background]

25
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:17,875
[Naota moans lightly]

26
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:21,125
[Naota grunts lightly]

27
00:01:25,541 --> 00:01:27,583
Hey, housekeeper-wannabe.

28
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:31,666
Cleaning woman.

29
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,500
Maid!

30
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:35,208
Bottom-feeder!

31
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:38,083
Evil alien.

32
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:39,458
Huhwhat?

33
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:41,833
[Naota growls] Can you clean
up your mess in my room?

34
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:43,458
[Haruko] What for?
The whole store

35
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:45,625
is stacked up with
papers anyway.

36
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:47,666
[Naota] Is he printing
more of those dumb zines?

37
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,000
[Haruko] Well, after all,
Mon-chan is a journalist.

38
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:51,875
Mon-chan?

39
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:53,250
"Kamon"

40
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,875
[Haruko] He says
it's a mini-zine.

41
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:57,375
With no readers.

42
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:58,541
[Naota yells]

43
00:01:58,625 --> 00:01:59,666
[concerned chatter]

44
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,833
[Haruko coughs]

45
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:03,125
What a junker.

46
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:05,000
[Haruko] These parts
are in perfect shape.

47
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,458
How can they just
backfire like that?

48
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:09,750
Very strange.

49
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,708
Hm.

50
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:12,833
[Naota yells]

51
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:14,291
Have fun today!

52
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:15,958
That hurts! Let me go!

53
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:18,250
I see you're wearing your
ugly hat to school again.

54
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,583
[Naota struggles]

55
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:22,416
[Haruko] Don't make such a fuss.

56
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,791
[Naota blubbers]

57
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:28,208
[Haruko] I just love the way
these feel. So soft and fuzzy.

58
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,666
They make you feel
all snuggly, ya know?

59
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,875
[Naota] Keep your hands off me.

60
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:34,500
So, what's up for supper?

61
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:36,083
[Naota] Huh?

62
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:38,291
[Haruko] You're probably going
to insist on curry again, right?

63
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,541
I hate spicy stuff!

64
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:45,416
That's why we're going to buy
you "Little Prince Curry" brand.

65
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,416
[Naota sighs]

66
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,958
[Haruko] It's for kids.

67
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,416
--[Eri] You're late.
--[Naota] Hm?

68
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,541
[Eri] I told you we had
rehearsal this morning.

69
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,750
You know you were
supposed to be there.

70
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,916
Naota, you're the lead role.

71
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,833
No, you're the lead role.

72
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:03,291
Anybody can play
my part. I pass.

73
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:06,708
We voted for the cast. And you
got voted in to play the cat.

74
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:07,333
"Komine Nandaba 1 5 23"

75
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:08,416
[Naota] The cat.

76
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,166
Do not miss the
rehearsal after school.

77
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:16,000
By the way, that
hat's really bizarre.

78
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,000
"Outdoor shoes forbidden"

79
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,000
Why's she so into this play?

80
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,500
[Miyaji] Cats, or felines,
love to be babied

81
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,083
when you rub their ears.

82
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:26,583
They have the amazing ability to
lick any part of their own body.

83
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,958
The cat family includes
tigers, manxes,

84
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:32,541
and animated cats, such as
Doraemon and Tom and Jerry.

85
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:33,708
Uh, is this...

86
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,791
Is that cool or what?
Found it in Sakai.

87
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,791
It was at some store,
right out on the rack.

88
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,833
Store that still
sells Crystal Pepsi.

89
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:41,000
Pepsi?

90
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,166
[Gaku] You know, the one
that Van Halen did

91
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,958
those "Right Now"
commercials for.

92
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:46,375
You there. What are
you whispering about?

93
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:47,708
[Masashi shudders]

94
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,125
Miya-jun.

95
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,166
Demerit! Demerit!

96
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,041
Grade 6, class 1 is
officially banned

97
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,583
from bringing in any more
reading matter of low taste.

98
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,958
Plus, reading something
like this secretly

99
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,666
is impolite to Ninamori-san!

100
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,083
[Eri] Huh?

101
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,583
[Miyaji] Just think about
Ninamori-san's feelings...

102
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:16,583
[Naota's voice]
Kids can't choose

103
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,583
the adults in their lives.

104
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,541
They can't choose their parents.

105
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:23,458
Ninamori's father is
the mayor of Mabase.

106
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:26,750
I don't really get it, but it
must make it tough for her.

107
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,000
Of course, that didn't stop me

108
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,333
from ditching the
rehearsal after school.

109
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:33,166
Playing a talking cat
is really too dumb.

110
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,583
[Mamimi] Okay, here we go.

111
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,458
[Naota] That hat.

112
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,916
[Mamimi] You finally
ditched school, too, Takkun.

113
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,291
Just like me. Meow.

114
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,916
[Naota] Is it a cat or what?

115
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,125
[Mamimi] You're a delinquent.

116
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,541
[Naota] It's after school.

117
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,291
Anyway, practicing
for a school play

118
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,416
isn't a regular part of class.

119
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,500
[Mamimi] I used to
be in school plays.

120
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:56,166
It was really dumb
and embarrassing.

121
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,958
But I was kind of happy too.

122
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,416
Mom and Dad both came
to see me together.

123
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,958
So, it's a good memory.

124
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,625
Hey, everyone!

125
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,041
The king's ears...

126
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,583
--[Naota yells]
--...are really...

127
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,333
--[Naota yells]
--...donkey's ears!

128
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,041
[Naota yells]

129
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,208
[Takkun] Na na?

130
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,541
Huh?

131
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:16,708
[Naota] Wah! Uh...? Hah!

132
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:17,708
[Mamimi giggles]

133
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,166
[Naota gasps]

134
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,541
[Kamon] Got a lot of
response, didn't it?

135
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:26,541
Well, investigative journalism
is the key to community reform.

136
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,750
My mini-zine of justice,
"Come on Mabase,"

137
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,333
will bring in so many
new customers,

138
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,041
I'll bet you'll even sell
out of your backlog

139
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,416
of old Crystal Pepsi.

140
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,708
Ah, well, gee.
What'll we do, huh?

141
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:41,166
So, how 'bout it? More copies
while I've still got 'em?

142
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,583
How 'bout a hundred?

143
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,416
Let's say 80.

144
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,250
Hm? See? Someone
wants a copy already.

145
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:49,500
Hello?

146
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,416
Yes, here you are, Sweetheart.

147
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,666
[Mamimi] I like your head.

148
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,333
You just never know what's
going to come out of there next.

149
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,958
Like Lord Canti
and these kitty ears.

150
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,875
Takkun, you're almost
as cute as Doraemon.

151
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,958
[Naota] He doesn't have ears.

152
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:08,250
[Mamimi] Anyway,
you saved me, right?

153
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,708
[Naota] Hm? 

154
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:12,000
[Mamimi] The other night,
when you piloted Lord Canti

155
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,750
and fought that evil robot.

156
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,916
You were super cool, Chief.

157
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,208
[Naota] Eh?

158
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:18,875
[Naota's voice] I could
hardly even remember

159
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,333
what happened that night.

160
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,625
After I got
swallowed up by Canti.

161
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:29,250
[Haruko] Canti! Canti!

162
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,833
Would you bring in
the laundry already?

163
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,208
What's that?

164
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,291
It smells. Uh--

165
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,750
I'm counting on you!

166

"Ninamori"

[Secretary yelps]

170
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,791
[Eri] Uh?

171
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,416
You're also smart
about running away.

172
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,583
That's 'cause I'm a grown-up.

173
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,375
I really like your boots.

174
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:14,166
Perfect for a nouveau
riche princess.

[Eri scoffs]

176
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,000
[Secretary] Goodbye!

177
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,583
[intense chatter in background]

178
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,875
[Eri] I don't have a
home to go back to.

179
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:27,208
All I have is my cat.

180
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,416
[Naota] Ah-hah!

181
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,416
The class president hanging
around town like a derelict?

182
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,708
Uh...

183
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:44,208
W-What're you doing
ditching rehearsal again?

184
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,750
[Naota] Should I tell
everyone where I found you?

185
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,583
[Eri] Naota, I swear
sometimes I think

186
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,583
you really are like a
delinquent or something.

187
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:54,625
[Naota] Could be.

188
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,500
[Eri] But that
hat's still bizarre.

189
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:00,000
[Naota] So... is there
like a major scene

190
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,583
at your house right now?

191
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,541
[Eri] I don't care.

192
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,250
[Naota] It's just some
tabloid thing anyway, right?

193
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,000
So don't worry about it.

194
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,708
[Announcer] The 5:37 train
for Nagano will depart from...

[Eri] Anyway, it's
all true, you know.

[Announcer] ...platform 2
in a few moments.

197
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,125
[Eri] But hey, I have
a lot of money.

198
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,791
Yeah, I'm a nouveau
riche princess.

199
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:20,875
Huh?

200
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,833
So, you wanna go somewhere?

201
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,208
Right now, you mean?

202
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,083
Yeah, you're Puss-in-boots
and I'm your owner.

203
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,041
So you just purr
and follow my lead.

204
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,666
[Naota] You talking
about that play?

205
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,375
I don't wanna be a dumb cat.

206
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,041
Anyway, I'm waiting for someone.

207
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,041
Huh?

208
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,041
[engine revs]

209
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,416
Ah, there she is.

210
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,416
Who's that?

211
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,958
Our housekeeper.

212
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:43,833
[Eri and Naota scream]

213
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:45,916
--Huh?
--Nya.

214
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,875

[Eri groans]

220
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,083
Naota! Hm?

221
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:18,791
[Eri] What's this?

222
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,083
[Haruko] Don't touch it!

223
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:21,416
[Eri] Uh?

224
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,291
[Haruko] A young girl like
you shouldn't touch it

225
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,500
with your bare hands.

226
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,458
What is it, anyway? Hello?

227
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:29,541
Yeah, I... guess it's an ear.

228
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:30,583
What kind?

229
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,041
[Haruko] Cat, looks like.

230
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,416
Kitty kitty, meow.

231
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:39,958
Ow, ow, my stomach.

232
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,875
[Eri groans]

233
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,208
[Haruko] I told you
not to touch it.

234
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,000
Is that my fault?

235
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:50,875
"Shigekuni's"

00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,166
Pretty good.

It's spicy! I don't care
if he goes to New York!

[muffled moans from Naota]

246
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,375
You're just being a kid.

247
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:13,958
It's an adult taste.

[Naota] What?

249
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,750
Why doesn't he think it's spicy?

250

[Eri] Why is this robot eating?

251
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,083
What is it?

252
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:22,416
That's just our television set.

[Shigekuni] Ah! Water!

254

[Naota] No fair, yours
isn't even as hot as mine.

255
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,583
Why is it walking?

256
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:31,125
Uh... Because it's a
TV Walkman, that's why.

257
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,375
Sony brand?
But it was eating curry.

is milder. Look.

Would you like chocolate
icing on your curry?

261
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,500
Hey, Canti, I want
a glass of water too.

262
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:41,750
Go get your own water.

263
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,291
You're supposed to be
the housekeeper here!

264
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,125
Yes, but only for Takkun.

265
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,291
Ah, soda. How did
you like the soda,

266
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,166
Miss Mayor Ninamori's daughter?

267
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,333
Soda?

268
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,083
How do you know about Ninamori?

269
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:55,250
Well, her father's a
famous person now, right?

270
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,625
No. I don't think
it's any big deal.

271
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:00,125
Haruko hit her. On her bike.

272
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,416
She ran her over?

273
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,708
Hit the mayor's daughter?

274
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,583
That's why she
started feeling sick.

275
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,291
Oh? Oh, no.

276
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,041
I don't think it's any big deal.

277
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:12,708
Please don't tell people our
bakery's motorbike ran you over.

278
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:15,000
Uh, but you got run over.

279
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,333
How's your stomach?

280
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:17,666
That's kinda rude, Takkun.

281
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,666
I don't think it's any big deal.

282
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,833
Hey listen, she can stay
at the house tonight,

283
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,666
since her family's in this big
awful scandalous mess right now.

284
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,000
What are you saying?

285
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,375
Uh, what I meant was:

286
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,541
why don't you stay over
tonight and get a good rest,

287
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:33,125
and forget about all of the bad
things that have happened.

288
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:34,958
Things like getting run over.

289
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,791
I don't think it's any big deal.

290
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,916
See, she says it's no big deal.

291
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,583
I can call your father and
mother to see if it's alright.

292
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,916
That's okay. My parents
are separate people.

293
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,416
If my father divorces my mother,
or gets arrested by the police,

294
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,833
it's up to him.
It doesn't matter to me.

295
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:55,458
[Eri's stomach makes
noises; Eri groans]

296
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:56,458
After effect.

297
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:57,458
[Eri] Restroom?

298
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,000
[Haruko] Over there.

299
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:05,291
[sound of toilet flush;
Shigekuni grunts]

300
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,791
[Kamon] Are you okay?

301
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,416
How's your stomach?

302
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,583
I don't think it's any big deal.

303
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:23,291
[Kamon] You think
I'm a bad person?

304
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,541
I'm glad you did it.

305
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,333
It finally got rid
of that secretary.

306
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:27,666
She had to go.

307
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,666
[Kamon] You're so
mature for your age.

308
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,875
Here. This'll keep the
soap out of your eyes.

309
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:38,541
[Naota] What? No,
it's not like that.

310
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:42,125
Don't worry. Ninamori's very...
she's very grown-up.

311
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,791
[Naota] Oh. Glasses.

312
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,916
Our secret.

313
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,291
I wear contacts.

314
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:50,958
[Naota] You've been
hiding things.

315
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,250
Oh, look who's talking.

316
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:53,625
[Naota] Mm?

317
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,791
Look, your pajamas?
They're way too short for me.

318
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:56,875
Can you see?

319
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,083
Hmm. So you're really
sleeping over?

320
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,500
Aah!

321
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,000
Well, we already called.

322
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,541
Er, your father did.

323
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:06,333
[Naota] Man, he's only
considerate at times like this.

324
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,000
[Eri] But we
wouldn't tell anyone

325
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,750
at school about this, right?

326
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,666
Of course not. People could
say all sorts of things.

327
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,208
Starting tomorrow,
don't hang out with me

328
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:16,500
for a while, alright?

329
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,541
Yeah, but tonight it's okay?

330
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,083
Uh?

331
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,791
[Naota screams]

332
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,125
Oh, I mean, not in that way.

333
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,375
[Naota grunts]

334
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:32,000
[Naota] You know what?
Go home! This is weird!

335
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,208
What's really weird
is your ears.

336
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,666
[Naota gasps] You saw 'em?

337
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,666
I was told I
shouldn't touch 'em.

338
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,125
So, what are they?

339
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,583
What do they look like?

340
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,291
Like cat ears.
Perfect to play a cat.

341
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:47,500
Why do I have to be
the one to play the cat?

342
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:52,041
[Eri] 'Cause.
I rigged the votes.

343
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,458
So I play the lead,
and you play the cat.

344
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:55,833
You didn't figure it out, huh?

345
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,958
See, no one would suspect.
They wouldn't think

346
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,333
the class president would
do a thing like that.

347
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,333
You mean you cheated?

348
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,208
You're not mad, are you?

349
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:05,708
You wanted to play
the lead bad enough

350
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,291
to do something like that?

351
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,041
Who would understand
better than you?

352
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,708
You're Puss-in-boots,
the one who tricks the prince.

353
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:12,916
He hides who he really is

354
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,541
and pretends to be
someone else forever.

355
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,500
But in time,
he becomes that person,

356
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,500
so his lie becomes
the truth, see?

357
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:19,791
He transcends the mask.

358
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:20,708
Well, don't you get it?

359
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,250
That's how he finds happiness.

360
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,291
That's pretty good, right?

361
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:27,083
[Haruko] You really think so?

362
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,208
How long were you there?

363
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,666
The whole time.

364
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,083
You were listening to us?

365
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,541
Course not. Anyway, why
would I care if you cheated

366
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:38,041
to get the lead role and
made Takkun a pussy cat?

367
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,625
[Eri] Who is she, really?

368
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,000
That's what I wanna know.

369
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,833
[Haruko] Pretty tricky
getting him to act in a play

370
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,208
by blackmailing him
about his ears.

371
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,166
[Eri] It's just a play.
I'm not hurting him.

372
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,041
Really? I'm not so sure.

373
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,416
[Haruko] It's not nice to
trick people, you know?

374
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,583
Yeah, tell her.

375
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,500
[Haruko] Honest people
are more popular.

376
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:57,083
Is that right? And do you
always sleep up there?

377
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,166
Yes, always.

378
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,041
[Naota] Stop it.

379
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,416
You're there every night?

380
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,916
Yep, every night.

381
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Right here, all alone
with cuddly Takkun.

382
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,500
--[Naota] Don't touch me there.
--[Haruko] Furry furry.

383
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:10,958
--Not the ears!
--Furry furry furry...

384
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:15,125
[meow]

385
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,708
[Naota shudders]

386
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:22,125
Mwah!

387
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,125
[Naota yells]

388
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,750
It's a robot?

389
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,958
Is there a person inside?

390
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,250
Eww, she kissed him on
the lips. Did you see that?

391
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,833
--Smooch! Smooch!
--[Naota] What are you doing?

392
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:31,833
[Naota groans]

393
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,250
--[Haruko] Here.
--[Naota] Huh?

394
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:36,041
It's your lunch.
Mild curry for your rehearsal.

395
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,916
I don't want it. I'm not
acting in that play.

396
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,916
Whaa!

397
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,708
You still gotta
eat lunch, Takkun.

398
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,458
I'm going home now.

399
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:44,625
No!

400
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:47,833
You've gotta stay
for rehearsal today.

401
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:50,250
You have to do what
Ninamori's telling you, Naota.

402
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,750
That's right. It was a
group democratic decision.

403
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:55,458
Did she put her
tongue in? Smooch!

404
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:58,458
[Naota] Shut up. You
can't tell me what to do.

405
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,458
[Gaku] Smooch?

406
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,291
I'm not going to
let you go home.

407
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,625
I don't wanna do the play.
I told you that.

408
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:07,625
It's already been decided.

409
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,458
Why you so uptight about it?

410
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:10,750
Everyone's going to see it.

411
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,250
A few people are gonna see it.

412
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,791
I want them to see it.

413
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:14,958
'Cause you're show-off.

414
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,833
My parents are going
to see it together.

415
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,750
School plays are
for little kids.

416
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:21,083
We are kids. Including you.

417
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,708
I'm not gonna play a cat.
It's embarrassing!

418
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,875
You think that's embarrassing?

419
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,291
With a head like that?

420
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,500
Smoooch?

421
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:30,875
What's that, ears?

422
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,208
They're cute.

423
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,750
[indistinct chatter]

424
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,166
Aaah!

425
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,166
Yeah? You're the one who
cheated to get the lead role!

426
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:54,958
[Eri yells]

427
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:55,958
Huh? Hey, wait!

428
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,083
Huh?

429
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,708
What's this?
What's happening?

430
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,708
[Eri cries in pain]

431
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,500
[Eri yells]

432
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:07,458
[Eri grunts]

433
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:12,000
[indistinct chatter]

434
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:17,166
Cha!

435
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:21,291
[Miyaji] Stop this now,
Ninamori-san!

436
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,875
[Naota yells]

437
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,708
[Gaku] Waah! Ninamo'.

438
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:45,125
[Haruko grunts]

439
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,333
Haruko, cut it out!

440
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:50,125
Ukulele no good.

441
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:51,583
Canti!

442
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,125
Let's get outta here.

443
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,625
[Haruko] Nya nya nya!

444
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:02,333
[Naota] Ninamori, get away!

445
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,875
Wah! Whoa!

446
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,458
[Naota yells]

447
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:11,208
[Miyaji] Demerit! No running
in the hallways! Ooohh...

448
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,500
Huh?

449
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:13,833
[Gaku] Miya-jun!

450
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,500
It's hit and run!

451
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,916
[Naota] Ow! Ah!

452
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,375
[Naota groans]

453
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,125
Alright, this is perfect.

454
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:27,750
Got it just where I want it.

455
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:30,291
Quit playing! It's got Ninamori.

456
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,916
[Haruko grunts]

457
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,125
[Haruko snickers]

458
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,000
[Naota yells]

459
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:40,875
Haruko, no! Aaah!

460
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:43,500
[Haruko grunts]

461
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,333
Canti!

462
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,500
Nya nya!

463
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:55,625
[Naota yells]

464
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,666
Out of my way! Heh!

465
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,875
[Haruko] Nyaah...!

466
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,416
Wha--?

467
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,916
It ate Takkun's curry.

468
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,375
Where did it go?

469
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:18,916
[Gaku and Masashi yell]

470
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:21,708
[Gaku wails]

471
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:22,916
Miya-jun's car!

472
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,500
[Masashi] She's still
paying off the loan.

473
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,541
[Girl] Miya-jun is messed up.

474
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,125
[indistinct chatter]

475
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:32,250
What? No indecency! Demerit!

476
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,041
[Haruko] Restroom? Over there.

477
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:51,250
Heh.

478
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,958
[Mamimi coos]

479
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,500
[Naota's voice] In the end,
Ninamori's father

480
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:20,125
wasn't prosecuted, and he
didn't get a divorce.

481
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:25,125
Ninamori said she
didn't care either way.

482
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,375
Then she smiled.

483
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:30,333
There was a rumor that she
was going to change schools.

484
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,083
But she's still here.

485

00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,458
Oh, look, glasses.

500
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:22,000
<i>I was looking for you.</i>

501
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:28,750
<i>Through my withdrawal,</i>
<i>I was lying.</i>
