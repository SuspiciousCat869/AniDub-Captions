1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,500
[NAGISA] I started
badminton really early,

2
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:14,416
back in elementary school.

3
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:23,875
It was frustrating.
Sometimes even painful.

4
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:26,875
Despite that, it was always fun.

5
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:32,041
"I'll become the best in Japan
and play on the world stage."

6
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,041
That's what I thought...

7
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:37,333
until that day.

8
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:44,458
No matter how I hit it,
no matter where I sent it,

9
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:47,125
I couldn't manage to get
a single shot past her.

10
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:56,791
My opponent... was overpowering.

11
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:02,708
[AYANO]
Finally home.

12
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:05,666
[AYANO sighs]

13
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,416
[UCHIKA]
Welcome back, Ayano.

14
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,916
But I guess it's
the other way around,

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,500
seeing as how I haven't
been here in a while.

16
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:30,458
I heard the news.

17
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:33,416
You're going to the finals
in the Inter-High.

18
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:52,375
My dear, Uchika...

19
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:58,125
for long time, you and Ayano
have shared a deep connection,

20
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:01,458
a mutual passion
for the sport of badminton.

21
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:06,291
Won't you consider coming home?

22
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:11,375
[clock chiming]

23
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,625
I wonder how she plays now.
I've been gone a long time.

24
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:22,458
Things change.
Has she gotten better?

25
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:01,916
Intense!

26
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,208
Watching them play
is wearing me out.

27
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,916
[BOTH grunting]

28
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,208
[AYANO]
Dang it!

29
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,833
[YU]
Seventeen-fourteen.

30
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:11,958
So close!

31
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,000
It makes sense he's good.

32
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,666
Coach Tachibana
was an Olympic hopeful.

33
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:20,708
[RIKO] But Ayano could have
played him anytime this summer.

34
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:23,000
Why is it suddenly
so important?

35
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,041
[grunting]

36
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,125
Final score, 21-17.
Coach Tachibana wins the game.

37
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:43,458
I'm exhausted.

38
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,666
Thanks again
for asking me to play, Hanesaki.

39
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,333
-[AYANO] One more time.
-No way, no how.

40
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,416
Go easy on an old man,
all right?

41
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:55,958
No fair! Just one more, please!
I was only getting warmed up!

42
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:58,166
[AYANO grumbling]

43
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,875
You. Want to go?

44
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,208
It'll be a dry run
for the finals.

45
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:12,250
Not like there's anyone else
here worth practicing against.

46
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,791
You want to play me,
don't you, Nagisa?

47
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:20,375
Wait a minute.
What's the rush?

48
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,375
You'll both get your chance
during the finals!

49
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:26,333
Don't be so uptight, Riko.
It's only a practice match.

50
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,375
Yeah, I'm not stupid!
But I don't want...

51
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:31,708
-[TACHIBANA clapping]
-Huh?

52
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:34,416
I need everyone
to come gather around!

53
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,833
[sighs]
Let's go.

54
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:47,500
As you all know,
the boys' prelims are tomorrow.

55
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,291
Hayama, Isehara,

56
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:52,250
it all comes down to this.
Don't hold anything back.

57
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,500
[HAYAMA and GAKU together]
Yes, sir.

58
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,583
Good luck tomorrow.

59
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,666
[laughing]
I got paired

60
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,166
against one of the top four
players from last year.

61
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,791
Luck's not on my side.

62
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,750
You can't predict what's going
to happen during a match.

63
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,166
The only thing you can do
is offer up your best.

64
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,666
Right! I'll be seeing you
in the finals, Gaku!

65
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,458
-We're in the same bracket.
-Huh?

66
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,625
If we do play each other,
it'll be in the semis.

67
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:19,208
Yeah! I was
aware of that, obviously!

68
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:22,125
It was a joke, really!
I mean, you do know

69
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,916
not everything has to be
taken so literally!

70
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,000
So, pretty cool, huh?

71
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,541
How we have two girls
from our school

72
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:44,875
who ended up being finalists!

73
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:46,250
For sure!

74
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,916
And it means they're both
going to nationals,

75
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,333
which is way exciting!

76
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:50,750
Yeah, agreed.

77
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:53,541
When they finally play,
I'm sure it'll be great.

78
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:56,041
I don't know why the two
of you are pretending.

79
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,791
Let's be real.

80
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,708
Nagisa doesn't stand
a chance against me

81
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,958
after how messed up her knee is.

82
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:07,541
Well, you can't be sure of that

83
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,458
until you have a chance
to play her.

84
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:23,166
Nagisa, you don't...

85
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,416
I need to make a stop
at the coach's office.

86
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,291
Go on ahead without me.

-[NAGISA] Excuse me.
-Hey.

You wanted to see me?

[MIYAKO]
How's your knee treating you?

94
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,791
There's some stiffness and pain,

95
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,708
but it's not affecting me
on the court.

96
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:07,375
There's no reason
you should push yourself harder.

97
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:08,750
You made the Inter-High.

98
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,291
So what? You're telling me
I should forfeit?

99
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:14,750
You can wait to face Hanesaki
on the national stage.

100
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,833
We may never get matched up.

101
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,208
If you continue winning,
eventually, you will.

102
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:22,541
You're both capable
of reaching that point.

[sighs]

104
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:26,375
Don't get so fixated
on every match

105
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,125
and think about your future.

[TACHIBANA'S stomach grumbling]

Well, mull it over.
Let me know what you decide.

108
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:39,500
The only thing
on my mind now is food.

109
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,666
See you tomorrow!

110
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:50,458
I've told you this before,
but he went really far.

111
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:51,791
[NAGISA]
Coach was in the running

112
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,041
for the Olympics, right?

113
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:57,333
His knee was
giving him problems too.

114
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,583
He had a big international
match coming up.

115
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:02,083
Since he was a shoe-in
for the Olympics,

116
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,416
he decided not to participate.

117
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,791
Then another Japanese player
came out with a surprise victory

118
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,625
during the competition.

119
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:13,250
The Olympic slot ended up
going to that athlete,

120
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,958
and soon afterwards,
Tachibana retired.

121
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,916
Okay, back up.

122
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,416
Coach was worried
about his knee,

123
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,083
and it ended his career?
Then I--

124
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,750
I'm saying that he knows
what you're going through,

125
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,708
and he's still telling you
to be careful.

126
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,375
At this moment,

127
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:35,583
I think he can relate
to you better than anyone else.

128
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:40,375
Try to understand, he only wants
what's best for your future.

129

[RIKO] What did Coach Tachibana
want to talk about?

130
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,958
[NAGISA]
You can guess.

131
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:51,833
[RIKO]
Your knee, huh?

Look, I know
it's not my decision,

but if you have to choose,

00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,708
I don't think
you should play her.

135
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:07,666
And besides,
I'm worried about Ayano.

136
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,541
She's been acting
stranger and stranger.

137
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,666
I guess
I really don't like the idea

138
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,875
of you two going head-to-head.

139
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:24,916
But hey, I should learn to start
minding my own business!

even go to our school.

For real?

I mean, he is a handsome guy.
No denying it.

00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,000
[MIYAKO]
Congrats on your win.

161
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:07,250
See if you can conserve energy
through your second match.

162
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:08,291
Right.

163
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,750
[GIRL]
I'll be cheering you on!

164
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,333
[SORA]
Some advice.

165
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:16,958
Goku, don't get cocky
out there, okay?

166
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:23,083
How can she tell?
Boy's got a poker face.

167
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,666
No clue.

168
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,041
Your first match of the day.
You ready?

169
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,833
[HAYAMA]
Yeah.

170
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,666
[MIYAKO]
Do your best!

171
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,375
[TACHIBANA] What gives?
Where's your usual passion?

172
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:39,833
I'll be there to watch you
during the early game.

173
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:43,625
Start out by hitting him hard
and making him lose his focus.

174
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:44,791
Sure, coach.

175
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,125
After coming this far,

176
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:48,041
what else can you do
but give it your best?

177
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,208
Remember, he made it
to the final four last year,

178
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,708
but he's a second-year.
Experience is on your side.

179
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,166
[YU]
You don't have to fight so hard!

180
00:12:56,625 --> 00:13:00,041
You don't have to fight
so hard anymore!

181
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,916
[TACHIBANA]
What's the matter, Ebina?

182
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:14,541
[NAGISA] I don't get it.
Was it something I said?

183
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,333
Hmm?

184
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:21,000
Huh? Hold on!
It's my not my fault!

185
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,708
[footsteps approaching]

186
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:42,208
Yu, come sit beside me.

187
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:54,291
[REFEREE]
On my right, Shun Hosoi.

188
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,250
On my left, Yukiteru Hayama.

189
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:00,583
Hosoi to serve.
Love-all. Play!

190
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,333
Nice!

191
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,500
Yes!

192
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:19,541
-All that training paid off!
-He's really moving!

193
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:28,875
Yeah!

194
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,875
-Luck is on his side!
-Come on, Hayama!

195
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,000
Damn it!

196
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,500
-He's on a roll!
-Three points in a row!

197
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:42,750
You're doing great, Hayama!

198
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,083
[RIKO]
Since his opponent's flustered,

199
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:48,166
he should widen his lead
as much as possible.

200
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:01,291
-[GAKU] He got it!
-[NAGISA] Now!

201
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,250
[HAYAMA]
It's out.

202
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,666
Finally on the board!

203
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,958
What? But didn't it land
out-of-bounds?

204
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,166
Almost. It was on the line.

205
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,208
He scored, which means
now, the real match begins.

206
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:28,666
-[REFEREE] Out.
-[grumbling]

207
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,250
Sixteen!

208
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:34,458
We can count. He is so annoying.

209
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:37,416
Keep calm!
You can still catch up!

210
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,291
His opponent sure
has a lot of skill.

211
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,208
There's a reason
he reached the final four

212
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,791
during his first year.

213
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:46,416
[ELENA] Do your best, Hayama!
Fight! We believe in you!

214
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,750
[GAKU] Lower your gravity!
And don't watch your shots!

215
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:52,375
[NAGISA] Now finish strong!
Don't sweat it!

216
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,416
[RIKO]
You're still in this!

217
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,666
[GAKU]
Don't give up!

218
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,500
You'll make it back!

219
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:03,916
[HAYAMA] Damn! I gotta change
this momentum somehow.

220
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:07,708
[HAYAMA]
Yes!

221
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,333
[gasping]

222
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,916
-In!
-There we go!

00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,041
So close! What a shame!

Come on!
Always keep your feet moving!

225
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:24,875
You're leaving?

226
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,541
[YU]
Bathroom break.

227
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:36,583
Your opponent's worn down, too.
You've gotta hang in there.

228
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:40,250
[HAYAMA] I'll try.
He sure is good, though!

229
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,666
Well, I should get to my match.

230
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,416
Don't get distracted, okay?

231
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,333
-Fight hard!
-Sure.

232
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,833
Yeah, I see you up there.

233
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:11,041
[HAYAMA] Your third match
is coming up next, right?

234
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:14,500
I know you can make it...
to nationals.

235
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:18,291
[HAYAMA] Okay, the backhand grip
looks like this.

236
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,333
You got it! Just raise
your index finger higher.

237
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,375
-Like this?
-Perfect!

238
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,541
And for the next lesson,

239
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,125
I'm gonna teach you
how to serve!

240
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,208
The first thing you should know
is there's two kinds,

241
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,000
short and long serves.

242
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:45,625
[breathing heavily]

243
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:49,083
[COACH] Isehara!
What were you thinking?

244
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,083
I told you to hit
around-the-head,

245
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,625
not a high backhand!

246
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,791
If you take the easy approach,
you'll never get far!

247
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:55,916
Sir.

248
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,583
[COACH]
Also, you're changing

249
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,958
the direction
your racket faces too early.

250
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,750
You need to hold it
until the last second,

251
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,875
or you won't beat
stronger opponents.

252
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,166
And your eye-line.

253
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,750
If you always look
in the direction

254
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,833
you want the birdie to go,
you'll give your angle away.

255
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,583
[HAYAMA]
No matter what you tried,

256
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,750
you always managed
to pick it up right away.

257
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:17,708
I guess I'm kind of a dummy
and could never get the knack.

258
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,041
-You're wearing him down!
-That's in!

259
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:20,875
[HAYAMA]
I didn't have the talent for it.

260
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:26,166
The thing is
I have a different one.

261
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,250
A talent for not knowing
when to quit!

262
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,750
[NAGISA]
Want to talk?

263
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,166
Did something happen
with you and Hayama?

264
00:18:55,916 --> 00:19:01,250
I saw him. He was training
in the park at night.

265
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:05,875
I knew he was putting
in time practicing,

266
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,708
trying to be a better player.

267
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:14,458
But then, actually seeing him
working so hard at badminton,

268
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:19,416
for some reason,
it made me feel so frustrated.

269
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:24,125
It was painful.

270
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,833
[HOSOI]
Oh, yeah!

271
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:33,208
[panting]

00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,583
[REFEREE]
Game. Match won by Hosoi.

275
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,458
Good match!

276
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:50,500
[crying]

277
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,791
Talk about rough luck.

278
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,958
I'm going to keep playing
in college.

279
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,916
Yeah, I know.

280
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,875
I thought this would be
the end of the road,

281
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,708
but I don't want to quit now.

282
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:35,208
I'm behind that idea completely.

283
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,000
Yu? Is this usually the way
you take to get home?

284
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,708
[YU]
Nope.

285
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,333
Thanks a bunch.

286
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,458
[laughing]

287
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,500
Feels strange practicing
when it's over.

288
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:10,041
-Let me talk, all right?
-Why are you shouting at me?

289
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:13,375
Because, I think
I kinda liked you!

290
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,291
For real?

291
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:18,458
[YU] But now,
I'm not so sure anymore.

292
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:21,416
I kinda had a realization.

293
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,291
The reason I wanted
to encourage you

294
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:24,916
was probably because

295
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,416
you helped me understand
I shouldn't stop playing,

296
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,750
even if I'm actually
no good at badminton.

297
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,875
[grumbling]
Wait!

298
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,791
Okay, I have no talent
for badminton,

299
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:37,666
and I'm not going to be
the best in the world.

300
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,583
So I thought, "Why shouldn't
I give it up entirely?"

301
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,083
But you taught me
that wasn't the point of game.

302
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:46,500
Struggling, working hard,
that meant something on its own,

303
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:48,041
something important.

304
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:50,416
So what's going on?

305
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,541
Does that mean
I like you or what?

306
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:58,041
I think it means you really
like playing badminton.

307
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:01,166
Oh! You know,
I think you're right!

308
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:04,250
Well, thanks
for clearing that up!

309
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:06,208
-No problem?
-See you later!

310
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:15,583
Who knows?
Maybe I'll keep playing.

311
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:23,500
21-14. Ayano wins.

312
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:26,750
-Thanks.
-[SORA] No, thank you.

313
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:27,958
What a work out!

314
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:30,375
Wanna play?

315
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:32,458
Oh, yeah. That's right.

316
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:34,958
Your knee could blow out
at any time.

317
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:37,833
Although, it's not like
it would make any difference.

318
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:46,125
[NAGISA]
I'm playing in the finals.

319
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:48,208
You know she's provoking you.

320
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:50,458
Don't let her get
inside your head.

321
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,500
[NAGISA] When Ayano beat me
in the All-Japan Juniors,

322
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:59,291
it's because I gave up.
I stopped chasing her shots.

323
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:03,791
And that's when I lost.
Not to her, but myself.

324
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:07,041
It's important I play Ayano,

325
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:09,791
because I'll be fighting
the person I was back then.

326
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:15,041
Honestly, I kind of figured
you were gonna say that.

327
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,458
[NAGISA] I won't push myself
past my limit.

328
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:22,791
Coach me.

329
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:25,708
I need your instruction
if I'm going to win.

330
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:27,708
[TACHIBANA]
I'll give you my best.

331
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:30,083
[MIYAKO]
And you have my support too.

332
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:54,750
[UCHIKA]
I heard you played Connie.

333
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:01,500
[UCHIKA] Once this
tournament's over with,

334
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:04,416
why not leave Japan with me?
