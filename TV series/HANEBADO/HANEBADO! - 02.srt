[BOTH gasp]

2
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:22,541
[MIYAKO]
She's returning each one.

3
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:25,875
Riko, you don't suppose
this Hanesaki girl is...

4
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:27,708
[RIKO]
Yeah, the one who beat Nagisa

5
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:30,916
at last year's junior
nationals in a shutout.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,458
[MIYAKO]
Oh, I knew it!

7
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:33,958
[TACHIBANA]
A shutout?

8
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:36,791
[RIKO] She was still in
middle school at the time.

9
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:50,125
[NAGISA] If placement
doesn't work, how 'bout this?

10
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:51,125
[NAGISA grunts]

11
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:56,916
8-3.

12
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,375
What awesome defense.

13
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:04,916
[NAGISA]
The corners, the body.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,291
No matter where I aim,
my smashes don't get through.

15
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:11,083
You can do it!
You've got to win this!

16
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:13,708
Otherwise Hanesaki
won't join the club!

17
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:15,916
She'd be a great addition!

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
[TACHIBANA] Yes. Her reflexes,
the flexibility of her wrist,

19
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:21,625
it's all exceptional.

20
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:22,625

[YU]
Service over! 4-8!

25
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:48,500
Ayano.

26
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:52,166
You didn't even go for it.

27
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:54,833
[AYANO]
I've had enough.

[NAGISA grunts]

29
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,458
[NAGISA]
What does that mean?

30
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:59,833
We're in the middle of a match!

31
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:02,625
Are you not feeling well?

32
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:05,250
I'm the adviser by the way.

33
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,208
Have you decided to join?

34
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:09,416
No, thank you.

35
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,208
--Huh?
--I told you I didn't want to.

36
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:16,458
Come on. We're leaving.

37
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:21,125
[ELENA] If you need one,
I'll be the team manager.

38
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,041
[gasps]

39
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,458
Not gonna lie.

40
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:28,125
I wish it had been full of
hot guys like tennis club,

41
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,125
but what can you do?

42
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,958
But, Elena, why?

43
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:27,875
[HAYAMA sighs] Look at what
all your practice is doing.

44
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,833
You've worn out these birdies.

45
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,958
[YU] But you keep yours
in perfect condition,

46
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,250
don't you, Hayama?

47
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,000
What's that supposed to mean?

48
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,916
[YU giggles]

49
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,708
So, how many times has
she done this drill?

50
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,625
This is the fifth, I think.

51
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:43,875
[RIKO]
Last one!

52
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,583
Great job.

53
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:52,166
I wasn't the one doing the
drill, and I'm exhausted.

54
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,708
[NAGISA]
No, let's do one more set.

55
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:55,916
[gasps]

56
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,666
You should probably
take a break.

57
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,083
[NAGISA]
No.

58
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:05,416
I have to practice more.
Can't afford to relax.

59
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,083
I need to get better.

60
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,916
[TACHIBANA]
Heya, what's up, team?

61
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,083
--[PLAYERS] Hello, coach.
--[ELENA] Hello, perv boy!

62
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,375
Where in the schedule are you?

63
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,666
Done. We're onto
practice matches.

64
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,250
Good.

65
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:24,333
Then on Court A, let's have
the older Isehara and Hayama.

66
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:28,083
On court B,
Aragaki and Hanesaki.

67
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,875
Okay, and the rest of you--

68
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,208
[AYANO]
I'll pass for now.

69
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,333
Since I just joined.

70
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:39,291
[TACHIBANA]
Why did you quit?

71
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,833
Huh?

72
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:43,291
Why did you give up
playing badminton?

73
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,416
[TACHIBANA]
Like I said before,

74
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,541
you have naturally
flexible wrists,

75
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:53,541
and you're left-handed,
which is an enormous advantage.

76
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,625
You have real talent!

77
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:59,208
We'll crush the Inter-Highs,
move to the nationals...

78
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,375
...then the world tournament!

79
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:06,500
After that... on to
the Olympic--[groans]

80
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:10,375
I told you, cut it out with
the creepy hand groping!

81
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:13,250
[AYANO whimpers]

82
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,083
But you're still
playing badminton.

83
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,625
I won't let you quit.

84
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,750
What? How come?

85
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:21,625
'Cause the perv's right.
You've got major talent.

86
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:26,083
[AYANO groans] Even if that
was true, I don't want to play.

87
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:29,125

89
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,458
Yes?

90
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:34,375
[TACHIBANA] For today,
you and Aragaki can partner up.

91
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:35,958
This is so stupid.

92
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,500
Let's get started.

93
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:38,916

Mm-hmm.

21-15.

97
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,916

Don't get distracted!

102
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,083
What? Oh, sorry.

103
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:29,833
[NAGISA]
Wrong one!

104
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,750
You know what I think?

105
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:36,833
After she lost in the junior
nationals to Hanesaki,

106
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:39,541
it really threw
Aragaki off her game.

107
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:55,208
[NAGISA] All the time I've
put in hasn't been a waste.

108
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:58,250
After all, I have my smash.

109
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,416
With it, I can win!

110
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,416
[RIKO]
I've got it! I can...

111

21-19. Match won by Aragaki!

112
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,583
[RIKO sighs]
I got so close

113
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:15,125
to beating you
that time, Nagisa.

114
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:32,583
This is gonna be tough. Yep.

115
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,166
[YU]
Hey. What's Ayano's deal?

116
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,291
She acts like she
couldn't care less.

117
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,791
[SORA]
Not sure.

118
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,958
But for someone that
apathetic, she's really good.

119
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:46,625
Must be nice to
have natural talent.

120
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:47,833
I don't know.

121
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:50,166
I think you and your
brother are talented.

122

We're average, really.

Well, catch you later.

Down the hatch!

Look at you, going to town!

I can't help myself!

I'm telling you guys,
after a workout,

131
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:20,625
nothing restores your
energy like meat!

132
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:29,125
The club. How's it going?

133
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,458
I mean, is she
still on a rampage?

134
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:36,333
[MEGU] Come on. Be honest.
Is it miserable?

135
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,291
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

136
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:42,875
But recently, the slump she's in
seems to be, uh, getting worse.

137
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,666
[MEGU]
Sounds like karma.

138
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,833
[TOMO]
It's what she deserves

139
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:48,375
for taking out her
anger on the team.

140
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:51,458
Huh?

141
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,583
But I thought you were hungry.

142
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,916
It's not as if
I worked out today.

143
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,125
Let's go.

Well, get back on your feet.

Nagisa, the unstoppable force,

Those two should be

the perfect complement
to each other, and yet...

They're both so different,

can work together.

to get in my way!

You have tunnel vision.

You're too fixated
on your smashes.

What did Izumi do different?

She used judgment
while you did not.

Yeah, sounds about
right. Got it.

In other words, I need to
make your favorite look good.

Right, Tachibana?

I mean, it's the least I can do.

You need untalented

[NAGISA] It doesn't matter
how good at badminton I get.

I win is because I'm tall.

You shouldn't take it so hard.

return it underhanded.

She didn't hit cross-court.

where her slump is coming from.

[TACHIBANA]
I'm tall like you. I get it.

291
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:19,041
You're relying on a jump smash
from a high vantage point,

292
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,666
because you're convinced
it's your greatest weapon.

293
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,625
You've thought that
since you were young.

294
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,375
"She's only good
'cause she's tall."

295
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:28,583
I bet you heard that

from the other students
all the time, right?

297
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:34,833
Thing is, they don't realize
it also makes you heavier,

298
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:37,000
so you need to work
out your legs more,

299
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,958
or you won't make contact.

300
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,791
The reason you win isn't
because you're tall.

301
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,666
It's because you train
harder than everyone else.

302
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,833
[TACHIBANA]
It's okay to hit the net.

303
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:56,916
It's okay if your
placement isn't spot on.

304
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,291
And that smash of yours,

305
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:01,291
it's pretty damn hard
to return at all.

306
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:04,750
You should be proud of that,
because you worked for it.

out of badminton, don't you?

I've trained more than anyone.

311

[panting]

313
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:38,875
That's more like it.

314
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:00,291
Everyone, I'm sorry.

315
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:01,750
A captain should
never put herself

ahead of the rest of the team.

00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,125
It was wrong of me.

318
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:10,250
[RIKO] The Inter-High
prelims are coming up soon.

319
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,875
Nagisa, you know
I love this club.

320
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:16,500
I want to keep playing badminton
with you as long as I can.

321
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,375
Since this is our last summer,

322
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:21,083
wouldn't it be awesome
if our team won?

323
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,250
Look at those starry eyes.

324
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,958
We're gonna see this
through! All the way!

325
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,416
[RIKO]
Mm-hmm.

326
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,541
Go on!

327
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,708
Let's go! Kitakomachi, fight!

328
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,791
[ALL]
Yeah!

329
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,125
[PLAYERS clapping]

330
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,708
Ayano.

331
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:08,541
We're on the same team,
but I am going to beat you.

332
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:17,458
Yeah. I can quit
whenever I want.

333
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:18,916
[TOMO]
Yu!

334
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,000
So what's new?

335
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,166
I'm guessing practice
went late today?

336
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:30,583
Yeah, things got a little crazy.
What about you guys?

337
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,250
Don't think just 'cause
you're in badminton,

338
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,291
you're the only one
with a busy schedule!

339
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,125
We just got out of cram school.

340
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:40,000
What? No way. Oh!

341
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:44,416
Uh-huh. You had it in your head
we were a bunch of slackers.

342
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:49,166
To be honest, I don't have
enough time these days

343
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,083
to pursue much else.

344
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:53,041
However...

345
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,500
--[YUKA laughs]
--[YU gasps] Huh?

346
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,333
You know, meat's
just the thing you need

347
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,791
after a mental workout.

348
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,000
That's the truth.

349
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:05,416
Agreed.

350
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,291
Can you hear me?

351
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:32,083
I want the world to know
how much I love myself!

352
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,458
If I want to win,
it's now or never!
