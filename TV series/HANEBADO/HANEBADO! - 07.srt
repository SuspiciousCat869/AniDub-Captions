161
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,041
I need to switch things up.

162
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,791
Engaging overkill mode!

163
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,583
Her backhand's open!

164
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,625
[gasping]

165
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,416
[REFEREE]
Hanesaki's the winner!

166
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,333
[grumbling]

167
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,916
[REFEREE 1]
Out.

168
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,291
[REFEREE 2]
Five, love.

169
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,916
You're a natural, Hanesaki.
I'm impressed.

170
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,666
Serigaya always wins,
even against boys.

171
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,541
How embarrassing.

172
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,916
The least she could do
is spare us a love game.

173
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,500
All that bragging
didn't amount to much, huh?

174
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:45,833
[laughing]

175
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:48,250
Satomi managed to hold out
for longer than this.

176
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,291
[SASA]
What's Ayano's deal?

177
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:54,625
She's like a totally different
person from last time!

178
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:57,583
Keep it up, Ayano! Looking good!

179
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:01,250
It's pretty crazy how easily
she's outmaneuvering Kaoruko.

180
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:02,583
There's something
about this match

181
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,000
that's making her
play differently

182
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,958
than her usual
all-defense approach.

183
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,416
[KAORUKO]
Okay, think.

184
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,625
Ayano goes on the offensive

185
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,791
every time
I attempt a kill shot.

186
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,916
In other words,
she's countering.

187
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,875
Change of plan.

188
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:19,416
Just avoid the kill and survive.
Hang in there.

189
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,958
[SASA]
Don't stop fighting, Kaoruko!

190
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:24,333
[KAORUKO] I'll outlast her
and eke out my first point.

191
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,000
[KAORUKO]
Don't take the bait!

192
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:41,666
This rally's been
going on forever.

193
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,083
The pace definitely feels like

194
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,583
somebody's slammed
on the brakes.

195
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,625
She's gone on the defense.

196
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:50,041
Ayano doesn't have
much attack power.

197
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,791
This might be hard for her.

198
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,541
[KAORUKO]
Since I stopped taking her bait,

199
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,166
there's been a definite change.

200
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,833
I can tell her focus
during the rallies

201
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,125
is gradually declining.

202
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,166
[KAORUKO]
Time to go on the attack!

203
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:10,750
There's the opening!
Seize the initiative!

204
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,333
-[CROWD cheering]
-[KAORUKO] Yes!

205
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,375
Nice smash, Kaoruko!

206
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,916
[KAORUKO]
I can win this!

207
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,375
Impressive.

208
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:35,083
Kaoruko strategizes
while she's playing.

209
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:36,625
Like she's trying
to trick her opponent

210
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:39,333
and have them fall
into a pattern.

211
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,500
[TACHIBANA]
You hit the nail on the head.

212
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,708
Their styles are night and day,
opposites.

213
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:48,416
When I played competitively,
I was more like Serigaya.

214
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,416
So I know all the hours
she's put in.

215
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,500
[CROWD cheering]

216
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,750
[TACHBANA] Never underestimate
the power of hard work.

217
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,208

[REFEREE]
Eleven, five. Interval.

221
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,125
Come on. Why?

222
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:34,208
They don't know you.
You've just started!

223
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,458
[KAORUKO]
Fine, I'll admit it.

224
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,041
You're a skilled player.

225
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,375
Still...

226
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,833
nothing like you used to be.

227
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,333
Whatever you're doing,
stick to it.

228
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,291
Just keep hanging in there.

229
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:54,291
Sir.

230
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,833
[KAORUKO] Her psychology
is her weak point.

231
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,583
If I can wear her down
as much as possible,

232
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,000
she'll slow by the second half,

233
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,500
and when I strike...

234
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,875
it should mentally shatter her.

235
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:15,916
[TACHIBANA] A war of attrition
is just what she wants.

236
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,166
You need to set
the pace yourself.

237
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,791
Okay.

238
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,958
Hey, champ, need this?

239
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,541
Thank you.

00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:28,041

Oh.

[RIKO]
Your hair tie.

242
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,916
Do you want to use mine?

243
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,208
I'll be fine.

244
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:41,333
Now, for my counterattack.

245
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:42,250
Huh?

246
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,791
[KAORUKO]
Don't you look cute?

247
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,000
[NAGISA]
Kaoruko's using

248
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:01,250
her mind and body
to their full capacity,

249
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,500
but...

250
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,458
[panting]

251
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:19,083
Is it me?
Or are they moving faster?

252
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,625
She's put up her defenses,

253
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:23,583
but you can tell the pressure
is making her crack.

254
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,041
Don't get worn
out first, okay?

255
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,125
[SASA]
No need to worry.

256
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:32,083
You can take it from me.
She won't break.

257
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,250
[SASA]
Yeah, she puts on airs,

258
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,291
but there's a reason.

259
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,333
She's been working
harder than anyone!

260
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,166
As long as there's
a game left to play,

261
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,958
she'll never burn out!

[KAORUKO]
I'll accept your challenge!

263
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,708
You're the first player
my own age

264
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,166
that I've ever lost to.

265

Ayano, you're the one person...

266
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:06,125
I'll never forgive!

267
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,958
There's no one back at school

268
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,833
that I could just go all-out
and play honestly.

269
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:13,166
I hope the two of us
can be close friends!

at the top of my list.

This sport is my life.

The only thing I ever
think about is badminton.

00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,916
That I needed reminding?

00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,041
[KAORUKO]
I can pull out a win.

286

Take the flow of the match
and reverse it.

a little while longer.

[SASA crying]

320
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,458
[KAORUKO]
Nothing about this makes sense!

321
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:12,166
You're crying,
but I'm the one who lost!

322
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,041
[AYANO]
She was pretty pathetic.

323
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:21,708
After all that build up,
what a letdown!

324
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,250
Don't say that.

325
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,125
Huh?

326
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:25,333
For your information,

327
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,791
you can win
and still respect your opponent.

328
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:30,833
Stop kidding around, Elena.

329
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:34,166
Only one thing matters,
winning matches.

330
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:44,208
[HAYAMA]
Well, Sora lost her match too.

331
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:51,250
What I said, listen...

332
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:54,333
It doesn't matter. Forget me.

333
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:56,958
Find Sora. Go and comfort her.

334
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:59,500
Yu? What does that mean?

335
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,083
[grumbles]

336
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:33,541
[KURA]
It's just as I suspected.

337
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:37,708
No problem at all.
She's already finished.
