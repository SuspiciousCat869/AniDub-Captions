00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,458
Can you believe
we're about to play a match

161
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,583
against the Fredericia Girls?

162
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:25,458
Feels like my heart's going
a million miles an hour.

-[SORA] Yeah.
-But the good news is

164
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,083
we have Nagisa playing
for our side,

165
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,875
and Aya seems like she'll have
no trouble in her game.

166
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:34,125
I've got a feeling
our school could win.

00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,166
[YU]
By the way,

168
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,958
did something happen
between you and Aya?

169
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,000
Not at all.

170
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,666
Nothing?
It just seems like you're...

171

Hey, guys. Sorry,

172
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:48,083
but do you know if she's made it
back from the store yet?

173
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,625
[YU]
You mean Aya?

174
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:52,250
Come to think of it,
she's been gone a while.

175
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,750
[AYANO]
What do you mean "beat"?

176
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,291
[CONNIE]
I want to play and defeat her.

177
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,916
That's why I transferred
to Japan

178
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,875
and attended this camp.

179
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,750
It was all so I could fight her.

180
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:09,458
And I've waited a long time.

181
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:10,666
Just the thought

182
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,583
of pummeling her
into the ground...

183
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,625
It's so exciting.

184
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,125
What a coincidence!

185
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,750
I'm also attending
a training camp

seeing you from behind feels...

I don't know... familiar.

How so?

00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,916
Not to sound weird,
but it's kind of soothing.

191

In fact, it reminds me
of a someone I know.

Uh, at first, I didn't want to,

00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,083
but I've started
feeling different lately.

196

I like the idea,
being part of a team.

Why's that?

198
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:57,250
You see, for the longest time,

199
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,708
I was convinced
I'd always be on my own.

200
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,291
But you know what?

201
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:04,166
Getting involved with a group
might not be such a bad thing!

202

Huh.

I can manage it all okay.

Besides, I like the idea
of helping out my team.

Love-all. Play.

318
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,625
[TAGAJO] I know
she told me not to do anything,

319
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:18,625
but how can I let a perfect shot
like that get away?

320
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,750
[REFEREE]
One-love!

321
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:27,500
-It was just a lucky shot!
-Defend against those smashes!

322
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:32,000
Sorry. That was my fault.

323
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:46,250
[REFEREE]
Uh, service over. One-all.

324
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,625
Huh?

325
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:52,583
Hey, Connie,
what the hell are you doing?

326
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:57,208
There's no point to this match
unless I win it by myself.

327
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:58,916
If you're going
to get in the way,

328
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,708
you can play without my help.

329
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:01,833
[TAGAJO]
Huh?

330
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,708
[TAGAJO panting]

331
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:18,500
Ayano, stay focused.

332
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,166
I don't know
what this girl's deal is,

333
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,833
but we can't let it distract us.

334
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:22,750
You're right.

335
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,375
[WATARI]
Sorry I'm late.

336
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,375
Hopefully,
I didn't miss too much.

337
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,833
Coach Watari, good morning.

338
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,250
A good morning to you as well.

339
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,708
You won't have to worry
about me interfering.

340
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,416
Much appreciated, Coach.

341
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:45,166
[exerting]

342
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,000
[REFEREE]
Ten- two.

343
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,166
[TAGAJO panting]

344
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,458
[TAGAJO]
It's impossible.

345
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,208
I can't possibly win by myself!

346
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:03,708
I can. Wanna trade?

347
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:06,083
Huh?

348
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:31,333
[REFEREE]
Service over. Three-ten.

349
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:34,041
I'll handle it from here on out.

350
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,583
So don't get in my way again.

351
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:38,791
What do you think?

352
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:41,041
Could you have returned
a shot like that?

353
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:44,541
That's what I thought.
I didn't even see it.

354
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:57,000
-Great shot!
-[TACHIBANA] Yes! It's through!

355
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,916
[gasping]
So high!

356
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:06,458
[exclaiming]

357
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:07,875
[CONNIE]
How insulting!

358
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:09,416
You expected that
to get past me?

359
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,375
We're finally face to face.
Pull out all the stops.

360
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:17,583
What's with this Connie chick?
She acts like this is personal.

361
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:21,833
Wait.
That girl's Connie Christiansen.

362
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,208
[ELENA]
Huh?

363
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,291
[TACHIBANA]
She's a prodigy from Denmark.

364
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,041
We're talking about the winner

365
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:31,000
of multiple world titles
before the age of 16.

366
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,208
Hold up, you said Denmark?

367
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,208
So what's she doing here
in Japan?

368
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:36,625
[TACHIBANA]
Whatever the reason,

369
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,541
she's an internationally
ranked player.

370
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,000
It's not hard to see why.

371
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,583
The length of her limbs,
her physical prowess.

372
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,458
Hanesaki might have
great instincts,

373
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:45,958
but compared to this...

374
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:49,708
[REFEREE]
Eleven-ten. Interval!

375
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:55,916
[panting]

376
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:08,833
-We can still win, right, Ayano?
-Uh, yeah.

377
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:10,833
[REFEREE]
Forty more seconds.

378
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:19,041
[gasping]

379
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:33,833
Like I told you earlier,
your team is meaningless...

380
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:36,583
big sister.
