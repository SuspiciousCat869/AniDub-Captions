00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:15,875
Seventy-two, 73, 74.

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,083
No! No! No!
How many times does that make?

3
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:27,041
It's 74, uh, plus one.

4
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:30,083
A new record! Let's go again!

5
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:31,041
[gasps]

6
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:33,791
That's four, and five,

7
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:38,250
six, seven.

00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:44,458
[YOUNG AYANO]
Oh, please! Just one more!

9
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:46,083
That's it, I swear!

10
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:47,500
[UCHIKA]
No, Ayano.

11
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,958
You promised we'd stop
whenever you dropped it next.

12
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:52,416
[YOUNG AYANO]
Aw! But I mean it this time!

13
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,166
Really. Come on! Please, Mom?

14
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,416
I went to bed
crying my eyes out!

15
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,208
I don't think it's possible
to make a bad medical drama.

16
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:04,416
[ELENA]
Go on ahead without me.

17
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:09,791
[ELENA]
Hey, Ayano,

18
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:12,250
I heard you gave up
badminton club.

19
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,375
[AYANO]
No one can keep up with me,

20
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:17,291
but that's okay.
Mom said I could quit.

21
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:21,000
Oh, but on my new team,

22
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:23,416
there's gonna be
this girl named Kaoruko.

23
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,125
She's really good!
I can't wait!

24
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:32,916
Huh?

25
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:41,833
[giggling]

26
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:45,166
Octo-octo.

27
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:50,000
[AYANO crying]

28
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:59,125
[ELENA] What do you mean
your mom left?

29
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,625
[ELENA] Well, if you're sure
you want to try Kitakomachi.

30
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:10,416
[AYANO] Yeah. I wanna go
to school with you, Elena.

31
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:16,166
You're not seriously
quitting badminton.

32
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:20,791
There's a bunch
of other fun stuff out there,

33
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,291
and I'm missing out on it!

34
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:31,083
Elena, I'll be waiting
outside, okay?

35
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,416
[sighs]

36
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,583
[NORIKO]
You two are inseparable.

37
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:36,583
[ELENA]
Mm-hmm.

38
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,333
[NORIKO]
Remember at tennis club

39
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:41,250
when she hit that smash
and saved your life?

40
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:43,291
[ELENA]
Hmm.

41
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:46,416
Okay! I admit!
I may have squeed a bit!

42
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,500
[ELENA]
Yeah? Interesting.

43
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:49,791
[NORIKO]
When I see stuff like that,

44
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,291
I start to think
I could fall for a gir--

45
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,333
Well, nothing ventured,
nothing gained.

46
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:54,208
[NORIKO]
Huh?

47
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,083
[ELENA]
Sorry, Noriko,

48
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,000
but we won't be joining
the tennis club.

49
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,083
[gasps]

50
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,125
[ELENA]
Ayano, you're coming with me!

51
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,708
[AYANO sighs]

52
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,958
[AYANO]
Where are we going?

53
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,208
Are you...

54
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,333
[ELENA]
I'm your best friend, right?

55
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:17,708
Well, I think you ought to be
playing badminton! [giggles]

56
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,333
[ELENA]
Rise and shine!

57
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,125
We need sign these forms
and turn them in

58
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,708
by the end of this week.

59
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,000
[AYANO]
That soon?

60
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,541
But I haven't made up my mind.

61
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,666
[NORKIO breathing heavily]

62
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,916
Something wrong, Noriko?

63
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,458
We were going to a movie.

64
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,750
Then, he flaked on me
last minute.

65
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:23,791
[ELENA]
Which guy is this?

66
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,750
I thought you were
after Saionji.

67
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,208
Right. He's the guilty party
that texted.

68
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,750
[ELENA] That was fast!
You two are dating already?

69
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,958
I was gonna tell him
how I felt today at the movies.

70
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,375
Looks like I failed
to seal the deal.

71
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,791
But, hey, you two
want to go instead?

72
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,250
I've got reserved seats
and everything.

73
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:44,625
Oh, Ayano.
We have club today, remember?

Keep up the energy, Yu!
Ten seconds left!

[NAGISA] All right,
let's take a 10-minute break!

80
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:04,958
[PLAYERS]
Okay.

Isn't it great?

[TACHIBANA]
At that age,

83
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,833
the smallest thing
can throw you off your game,

84
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:13,708
but you can rocket back
just as quickly.

85
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,791
I know. Definitely had
my share of those.

86

Thanks to you,
we've got Aragaki back,

87
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,791
and practice can resume
as normal!

Hey, just curious.

00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:35,916
Is it true
you've been playing badminton

93
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,458
since elementary school?

[AYANO]
No.

95
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,916
[RIKO]
So before that? How far back?

Do you think
maybe we could trade?

under all that muscle?

Second place has
to treat the winner to a drink!

It's a Kitakomachi rule!

It's second nature to her.

She's on a totally
different level.

Dang!

I counted 61!

[HAYAMA] If she wanted,
she could've kept going forever.

[AYANO]
Elena?

119

When we were together,
I relied on you too much.

120
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:33,916
I wanted to be strong.
That's why we had to break up!

[MAN onscreen]
But when we were separated,

122
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,625
I learned something important.

123
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:41,416
What I missed
was having you rely on me!

124
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,666
[ELENA]
I had fun.

125
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,333
Thanks for hanging out
after I called out of nowhere.

Wasn't that a great movie?

There's nothing I love more

around her finger!

[NORIKO]
I got a text.

132

He's asking
if I want to grab dinner.

Yeah.
But it's pretty bare-bones.

Text him back "yes."

on eating dinner at home anyway.

[ELENA]
I admit,

144
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,458
I was a little bit worried
at the beginning

145
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,250
that she might not fit in
with the others.

146
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:02,750
That's why I tagged along.

147
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:05,375
Turns out, everybody's
been so welcoming.

148

I think she can stand
on her own now.

It hasn't been easy
for me, though.

Do you know the reason

she quit badminton
in the first place?

I figured if anyone did,
it'd be you.

at junior nationals,

she was perfect.

155
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:31,500
Compared to six months ago,
she seems broken.

156

Leave everything to me!

157

what's going on with her.

what a manager can handle.

00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,625
I think
it'd do you a lot of good

319
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,416
to keep on playing badminton.

320
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,833
Just my opinion.

321
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,333
[NAGISA]
No need for us to go to the gym.

322
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,375
This can be our court.

323
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,958
-[wind whistling]
-Oh!

324
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,833
One, love.

325
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,958
Yikes, the wind really messes
with your aim!

326
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:19,083
[AYANO and NAGISA exerting]

327
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,916
[NAGISA]
Whoa! What gives?

328
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,375
[AYANO]
That one was out.

329
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,500
[NAGISA]
I don't see any referees around.

330
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:28,958
Hey, where are you hitting it?

331
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:30,583
[AYANO]
Yeah, but you just said...

332
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,208
Why should it be me
that talks to her?

333
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,583
Because you and her
are basically the same.

334
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:38,833
[NAGISA]
Huh?

335
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,958
Pretend all you want,
but I know the truth.

336
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,958
And despite everything
I've heard you say,

337
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:45,833
it's obvious that you're crazy
in love with badminton!

338
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,666
Uh...

339
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,000
So is Ayano.

340
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,375
The other thing
you guys have in common

341
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,333
is that you're not too complex.

342
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:55,458
[NAGISA]
Hmm.

343
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:59,208
[ELENA]
I envied the fact you knew

344
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:01,208
what your passion was.

345
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:04,000
All through elementary
and middle school,

346
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:05,625
I always thought,

347
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:08,875
"I don't have anything
I can devote myself to,

348
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,666
not the way she does."

349
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,791
Because whenever I see
you playing, Ayano,

350
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:16,541
you look like you're having
so much fun!

351
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:18,708
[UCHIKA]
Good!

352
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:25,791
I love playing badminton!

353
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:41,583
[ALL laughing]

354
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:42,750
Amazing.

355
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:49,041
Back when I was a kid,

356
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:52,083
I used to play badminton
in the park just like this.

357
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:54,583
It was fun then, too.

358
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:01,000
[badminton volleying]

359
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:04,708
Do you think she meant
an aquarium with a squid?

360
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:09,000
Elena definitely told Nagisa
it was in a public park.

361
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:10,208
Squid.

362
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:14,166
[HAYAMA]
Well, it is a cephalopod.

363
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,000
[NAGISA]
Sure are taking your time.

364
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:18,041
[AYANO] You got it
stuck in a tree last time.

365
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:19,416
You get it.

366
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,583
[NAGISA] Because I returned
your crazy shot!

367
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:24,458
-[NAGISA] There!
-[AYANO] Hey! No fair!

368
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:27,375
-[YU] I want in on this!
-[HAYAMA] So do I!

369
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,791
Come on. Let's divide into teams
and play matches!

370
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:35,083
You're supposed
to be at practice.

371
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:36,375
Don't be that way, Nagisa.

372
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:37,875
[NAGISA]
How can you even play?

373
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,416
You didn't bring your rackets.

374
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,541
Now, we're getting somewhere!

375
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:44,416
