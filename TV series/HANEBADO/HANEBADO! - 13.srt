00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:15,291
[NAGISA] In a battle,
you either win or you lose.

2
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:20,041
[AYANO] There's only one
way to prove yourself,

3
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:22,750
and that's by defeating
your opponent.

4
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:25,958
[AYANO]
But...

5
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:32,333
[NAGISA] What you see on
the other side of that net...

6
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:41,041
[AYANO]
Is always...

[NAGISA]
Come on!

11
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:44,083
She hit it...
using her right hand?

[KAORUKO gasps]

13
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,583
[MALE REFEREE A]
Nine, love.

14
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,875
How typical. It's anything
goes with her.

15
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,166
[NAGISA]
She noticed my placement

16
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,375
and switched the racket
between hands.

17
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:55,541
[MALE REFEREE A]
Serve.

18
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,500
[AYANO]
Why?

19
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:07,500
Yes!

20
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:10,083

Ten, love.

21
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,333
[AYANO]
What's the reason I'm fighting?

22
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:23,125
[NAGISA]
Was that intentional?

23
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,208
[SASA]
Another easy return!

24
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,250
Is she trying to lose?

00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,666
More hesitation.
She's losing ground.

28
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,000
[AYANO] What am I still
playing badminton for?

29
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:50,125

[CROWD cheering]

31
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,166
[MALE REFEREE A]
One, Ten.

32
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,416
She's got a point on the board!

33
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,375
Keep 'em coming, Aya!

34
00:03:57,458 --> 00:04:00,416
Don't let it get to you!
You'll make the next one!

35
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,125
[NAGISA] Snap out of it.
You need to be more confident.

36
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,625
[MIYAKO]
Something's different.

37
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:08,291
Hanesaki's stance isn't
the same from before.

38
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:09,833
The zero position.

39
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,333
[MIYAKO gasps]

40
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:13,166
She used her right hand to
make that earlier play as well.

41
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,125
It wouldn't surprise me if she's
always been ambidextrous.

42
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:19,416
This whole time?
Why'd she keep it a secret?

43
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,208
I don't think she
intentionally concealed it.

44
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:26,000
Playing with both hands, you
lose time switching the racket.

45
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,791
Plus, you risk
directional imprecision.

46
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:32,958
But she decided to do it anyway.
She's giving it all she's got.

47
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:38,583
[NAGISA] I can visualize it.
The next point is mine!

48
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:44,791
[YU]
She's being aggressive!

49
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:49,416
Did you see that? Guess that
means she's in the zone again!

50
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,708
It does, meanwhile you can
tell Aragaki's losing steam.

51
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,416
[TACHIBANA]
The momentum's reversed.

52
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,958
[SASA]
That looks like...

53
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,000
[KAORUKO] She's stealing her
opponent's ability to think

54
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:05,000
with swift rallies. Sheer power
isn't enough at this point.

55
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:08,166
Nagisa doesn't have the
strength left to regain control!

56

[NAGISA pants]

57
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,083
[NAGISA]
I need to regain control!

00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:43,958

difference minutes ago!

61
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:53,041
I need to take a
quick sweat break.

00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:20,083
[NAGISA] I've got to
focus on myself first.

00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,458
It's another lift!

70
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,333
[SORA]
There we go.

71
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,333
Aya tied the score!

00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:30,958
[MALE REFEREE A] 
Seventeen, all.

73
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,166
One thing's certain.

74
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,583
Hanaysaki's figured
out her smashes.

75
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:45,750
What will you do now, Aragaki?

76
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,541
Bring it on!

77
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:48,666
[AYANO]
Hm.

78
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,083

They should be exhausted!

79
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,958
How can they keep playing?

80
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,875
[AYANO]
Now I see.

81
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,666

She made it! It's over the net!

[AYANO]
At this moment,

00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,875
I know why I'm
playing badminton.

86
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,166
[AYANO]
It's for one reason.

87
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,000
To beat Nagisa!

88
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,625
[NAGISA] Ayano. You're an
incredible player.

89
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,000
[NAGISA] When people
use the word "gifted",

90
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,458
they're talking about
players like you.

91
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:14,958
[NAGISA]
The thing is...

92
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,208
[SORA]
She did it!

93
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,958
They're neck and neck!

94
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,958
I should call the match.

95
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm pretty sure she
has patellar tendinitis.

96
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,208
It also goes by the
name Jumper's Knee.

97
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:34,625
Inflammation caused
from overuse.

98
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:38,250
If not properly treated, it can
kill a player's career.

99
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:45,500
Can we hold off Coach?
Just a little longer.

[TACHIBANA grunts]

101

She needs this.

102
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,500
[NAGISA]
I don't want to lose!

103
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:57,958
How can she keep up that
speed after three games?

104
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:00,708
She's done more training runs
than anybody on the team.

105
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:01,750
[HAYAMA]
Hm!

I don't know what
we're supposed to do!

It's deuce.

121
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,958
At this stage, scoring two
points in a row

122
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:14,125
is gonna be tough
for both of them.

123

[MALE REFEREE A]
Twenty-one, match point twenty.

124
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:25,583
A cut smash where she
least expected it.

Hm. Not bad at all.

126
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,666
Ayano only needs to
score one more point now.

Then let's have some fun.

She was a split second too
late approaching the net!

They're both running on empty.

00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,208
Actually, you were amaz--

161
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:59,000
[AYANO]
I hated you.

162
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,416
You left because
I had no talent,

163
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,791
because I wasn't a good enough.

164
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:06,416
I hated you.

165
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,833
Yesterday, I asked
you a question.

166
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,875
What're you playing
badminton for?

167
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:16,416
[AYANO] Right now, for me.
It's because I love it too.

168
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:21,875
[UCHIKA chuckles] You and I
could go overseas together.

169
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,791
Would you like to
come to Denmark?

170
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,750
It'd be you, me and Connie.

171
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,000
The three of us
could play badminton.

172
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:34,750
I'm staying here,
with my friends and team.

173
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,375
[AYANO]
If I'm taking the next step,

174
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,750
I want this to be
my starting line.

175
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:44,791
[ALL giggle]

176
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:49,041
I guess it's fair. This time
I'm the one being left behind.

177
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:53,500
[AYANO] Don't worry.
We'll play again sometime.

178
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,250
[UCHIKA chuckles]

179
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:07,083
[AYANO hums]

180
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,791
[ELENA]
Hey, Ayano.

181
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:15,250
[ELENA] What I said,
before the match.

182
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,125
It was wrong of me. I'm--

183
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,416
[AYANO]
Elena.

184
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,750
Before I go home,
I want to stop somewhere.

185
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,166
[RIKO]
You're sure your knee is okay?

186
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,916
[NAGISA] Yeah. I'm going
to the hospital tomorrow.

187
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,166
Not that I'm complaining,

188
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,208
but don't you have to
babysit your siblings?

189
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,375
[RIKO]
Today's Sunday.

190
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:39,375
So Mom and Dad are
home looking after them.

191
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,958
You deserve a break.

192
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,416
[RIKO] I can't get the
finals out of my head!

193
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,875
You were so impressive!

194
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:49,375
What's next? Think you could
be the national champion?

195
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:54,791
I really don't know. It might
turn out I'm not as talented

196
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:59,000
at badminton as I hoped.
But even if I'm not,

197
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:01,500
I'll probably keep
playing it forever.

198
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:06,916
[NAGISA]
Riko.

199
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,250
I wanted to say...

200
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:15,833
Thank you. I know,
if you weren't by my side,

201
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:18,708
I would not have
made it this far.

202
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:19,833
[NAGISA]
So thanks.

203
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,208
[RIKO chuckles]

204
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,541
If I'm being truthful with you,

205
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,458
I was feeling
kind of frustrated.

206
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:29,041
[NAGISA gasps]

207
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,333
I realized something.
The place you're at

208
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:35,166
as an athlete now can't be
reached with hard work alone.

209
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,000
Discovering that was a
little disappointing.

210
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,125
[AYANO]
Octo-octo!

211
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:51,708
[ELENA giggles]

212
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:02,750
[AYANO]
Elena... I'm sorry.

213
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:03,916
[ELENA]
Huh?

214
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,875
You mean about the match?
You worked really hard!

215
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,500
There's no reason to be upset!

216
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:13,208
[AYANO]
I didn't mean the finals.

217
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,416
I'm not sorry I lost.

218
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,125
[AYANO sobs]

219
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,625
[AYANO]
You were always there.

220
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,791
You never abandoned me.

221
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,250
You were the one who encouraged
me to play badminton again

222
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:34,458
and gave me a chance
to be a part of a team!

223
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,000
Thank you!

224
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:42,583
[ELENA sighs]

225
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,541
[YU]
Hey there!

226
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:55,541
Crazy. We actually beat
Nagisa to practice?

227
00:18:56,666 --> 00:19:00,083
She went to the hospital
with Coach Tachibana.

228
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,375
[YU]
To get her knee looked at?

229
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,166
[RIKO]
Yeah.

230
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,958
[HAYAMA]
We have arrived!

231
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,416
[YU]
Oh, it's you.

232
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,541
[HAYAMA grunts] That's how
you greet an upperclassman?

233
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,250
You're supposed to look
up to those who are

234
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,083
older and wiser than you!

235
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,625
[YU] Speaking of wise,
shouldn't you be studying?

236
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,375
You don't want to be
in the bottom ten.

237
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:20,916
[HAYAMA grunts] Today was
my last day at this school.

238
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,250
[YU]
Hm?

239
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,375
[HAYAMA] I'm trying for
Meisei University.

240
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,625
[YU gasps] I remember hearing
they're supposed to have

241
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,625
a great badminton team.

242
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,458
Seemed like a good choice.

243
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,500
Since I'm going to
keep playing the sport.

244
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,291
Fat chance they're going
to accept you now,

245
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:35,500
given your grades and all.

246
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,041
[HAYAMA]
You're supposed to have my back!

247
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,208
Besides, I've still
got six months!

248
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,375
[TACHIBANA]
We're back!

249
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:40,666
[GAKU]
Hm?

250
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,250
[RIKO gasps]
Nagisa!

251
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:48,625
[TACHIBANA] Turned out to be
patellar tendinitis after all.

252
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,083
Whatever you said,
it sounds way bad.

253
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:54,083
It can be sometimes.
The X-rays came back

254
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:57,500
showing small tears in the
tendon beneath the kneecap.

255
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,875
So what does that mean?

256
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,583
[TACHIBANA]
It means don't worry.

257
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,500
The symptoms were only minor.

258
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,791
For the moment,
it's not a huge concern.

259
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:10,041
She'll be okay...? I'm so glad!

260
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,666
I kept telling you it wasn't
gonna be some big deal.

261
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,250
[RIKO]
I know, but still.

262
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,916
We're all relieved,
but for right now,

263
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,958
you need to rest as
much as possible.

264
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,666
So I want you to
skip any practices

265
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,125
that might work
your legs too h--

266
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,416
[AYANO]
Wanna play?

267
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,625
[ALL gasp]

268
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:26,000
[AYANO] What're you
waiting for? Let's go!

269
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:29,458
[gasps] Did you even hear a
single word the coach said?

270
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:30,958
She needs rest
before she's ready to--

271
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,500
But how does Nagisa feel?

272
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:35,416
[NAGISA]
Uh, I feel, um...

273
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,166
You're well enough to
play me, aren't you?

274
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,875
Not exactly.

275
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,208
No, I get it.

276
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:43,458
Obviously, you're too scared
to accept a rematch.

277
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:44,791
[ELENA]
Uh...

278
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,666
So much for the real Aya
being the shy, quiet type.

279
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,500
Rule number one in life,
people never change.

280
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,875
[AYANO] Yeah. There's no
point for us to play again

281
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,208
when everyone's knows
I would beat you.

282
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:57,500
You got yourself a match.

283
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,041
Huh?!

284
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,000
[NAGISA] And lucky for you,
since my knee's a total wreck,

285
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,625
we ought to be on the
same playing level now.

286
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,666
[TACHIBANA]
Woah! Woah! Woah! Slow down!

287
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,416
Let's see if you can
back up your trash talk.

288
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,333
[ELENA]
Is everyday gonna be like this?

289
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,416
You're so mean.

290
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,500
I just want to play Nagisa
as soon as possible!

291
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:18,125
[NAGISA]
Good morning!

292
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:20,291
About time you showed up!

293
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:23,208
I took the first available
bus to get here.

294
00:23:49,666 --> 00:23:55,375
[AYANO] What you see on
the other side of that net...

295
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:57,833
[NAGISA]
Is always...

296
00:23:57,916 --> 00:24:00,291
[NAGISA, AYANO]
...a reflection of yourself!
