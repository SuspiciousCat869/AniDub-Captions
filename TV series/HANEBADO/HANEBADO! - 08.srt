00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:18,166
Returning all those shots
is utterly pointless.

167
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,916
She's still getting beaten.

168
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,250
[REFEREE]
Nine, seven.

169
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,458
Told you so.

170
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,916
Hey, hey, hey! Pattern C!

171
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,458
Rotate, C-one to C-six.

172
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,791
Make her run. Make her run more!

173
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,166
[REFEREE]
Ten, seven.

174
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:39,333
Look at her.
Something strange is going on.

175
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,541
[KURA]
That's the way! Now intensify.

176
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:42,708
Even more running.

177
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,541
I guarantee you
Aragaki is finished.

178
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:52,250
And not just here.
Entirely.

179
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:56,458
To be frank, she's at risk
of ending her athletic career.

180
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,541
Despite the advantage
of height and build,

181
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,375
the girl throws herself
at every birdie,

182
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,958
no matter how difficult it is
for her to make the return.

183
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:08,041
I can only think
of two reasons for this:

184
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,625
She's a bad judge
of what's in and out.

185
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,500
Or the second possibility...

186
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:14,083
It's out!

187
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,083
[groans]

188
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,541
[KURA]
Some fault in her personality.

189
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,458
Doesn't really matter.

190
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,458
There's a major difference
in the amount of strain

191
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:27,541
Aragaki places on her legs
compared to you.

192
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,041
[NOZOMI]
This is ridiculous.

193
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:34,000
[KURA] Great one.
Hang in there. Hang in there!

194
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,750
[NOZOMI] Even if it goes
against his playbook.

195
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,000
I can still...

196
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:40,375
[grunts]

197
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,708

Eleven, eight. Interval.

[sighs]

199
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,375
Why didn't you
make her run for it?

200
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,666
Are you planning on
following my instructions?

201
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:00,958
Ugh.

202
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:03,416
If you don't respond,
how I am supposed to know

203
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,250
you're comprehending
a single word I'm saying?

204
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,166
Answer me!

Ishizawa...

208
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,541
I'm waiting.

209
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,208
[nervously]
I heard you.

210
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,541
In that case,
go C-two to C-four.

211
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:30,416
If you want to win,
then do as you're told.

212
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,666
Yes, sir.

213
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,916
Nagisa. Are you having
any kind of pain?

214
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,625
Not especially.

215
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,166
Her coach seems pretty adamant

216
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,750
about making you
run back and forth.

217
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,458
Do you think maybe
he wants to do more

218
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:43,833
than wear down your stamina?

219
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,083
No idea.

220
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,041
You don't have to return
every cut smash

221
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,250
that she sends your way.

222
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,750
-Yes, I do!
-You don't get it?

223
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,583
Fine, I'll spell it out.

224
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:55,416
They're making you run
to try and blow out your knee.

225
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:59,500
I know that,
but it's not like I can just...

226
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:02,916
I have to...

227
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,916
Hmm.

228
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,791
Go after the cuts if you want,

229
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:18,000
but don't force yourself
to run for them.

230
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:21,291
Before you start,
focus on one or two rallies.

231
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:22,625
Find a way to compensate

232
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,458
and alleviate the burden
on your knees.

233
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,958
What do you mean
by compensate for it?

234
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,875
[REFEREE] One minute over.
Please return to the court.

235
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,208
What a load of crap.

236
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:37,750
I sure hope she'll be okay.

237
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:40,250
[REFEREE]
Eleven, eight. Play.

238
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,916
[NOZOMI]
I have to win.

239
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,583
If I lose, it means
all this was a waste.

240
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,333
[NAGISA]
What'll she send my way?

241
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,666
One or two rallies,
then compensate.

242
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,500
Ishizawa. Pattern E!
Cross it over.

243
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:00,750
[NAGISA] Imagine scoring a point
and work backwards.

244
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:03,250
I can get her moving
the way I want.

245
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,958
She's predicting the shots.

246
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:08,000
[NAGISA] Then I'll bring
the match up to the net.

247
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,458
Oh too bad.

248
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,416
Wrong choice, Nagisa.

249
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,041
Perfect!

250
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,500
Refrain from strangling.

251
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,000
Watch her attack patterns.

252
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,375
The net play.

253
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,041
Her racket work.

254
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,583
It's all flawless.

255
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,166
Yeah, what gives?

256
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,708
How come you're
sitting there all quiet,

257
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,833
not shouting instructions
like the other coach?

258
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,250
-Huh?
-Settle down, Elena.

259
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,583
I'm just saying it's not fair

260
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:34,208
if they're doing it
and we're not.

261
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,916
It wouldn't have
any effect on her.

262
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,500
I can't shout any command
that's going to make Aragaki

263
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,416
better than she already is.

264
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,333
[ELENA] What?
So you're not even going to try?

265
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,625
If anything, it would
only distract her more.

266
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:47,333
But if this keeps up,
Nagisa will--

267
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:50,750
She's going to lose.
You're okay with that?

268
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,125
[NAGISA]
Damn it.

269
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,041
I'm still getting run
all around the court.

270
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:57,250
What did he mean by
"focus on one or two rallies"?

271
00:14:57,333 --> 00:15:00,416
I know what's not helping.
Thinking about this crap!

272
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,375
[NOZOMI]
A backhand to the body?

273
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:06,208
[NAGISA]
She doesn't have full control.

274
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:11,458
Ishizawa, control!
A-two! A-two!

275
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,666
[NOZOMI] How can a drive
have that much force?

276
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,541
[NAGISA] She may have strategy,
but I can trample it.

277
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:17,625
Aah.

278
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,166

00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,291
She did it!

283
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,708
Nagisa broke through.

284
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,000
Looks like she finally managed

285
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,625
to turn the match
around in her favor.

286
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:37,666
[RIKO]
Just curious, what did you mean

287
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,416
by focusing on
one or two rallies?

288
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,208
[TACHIBANA] I figured
if she could arrange shots

289
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,875
in a way that would let her
take the initiative

290
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,250
she'd have it made.

291
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,125
[RIKO] Uh-huh.
Well, I understood that part.

292
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:50,750
It figures she compensated
by using brute force.

293
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:54,125
But I'm not sure she's thinking
that hard about it anymore.

00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,250

295

00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,666
Come on. B. Pattern B.

297
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,541
Cut. Control!

00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,500

-Hyah!
-And, boom!

300
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,458
That's six points in a row.

301
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,875
Enough to build up a solid lead.

302
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,958
And it's only going
to keep climbing.

303
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:25,416
Just look at that girl
from Zushi Sogo.

304
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,875
She seems pretty rattled.

305
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,875
What are you doing
out there, idiot?!

306
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:32,416
You're supposed to be
using pattern A right now!

307
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,958
Control!

308
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,250
What was that?

309
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,916
Seven in a row!

310
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,458
-I feel kinda sorry for her.
-Huh?

311

the damned serve!

00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:55,916
[NOZOMI]
What if I lose?

315
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,250
No. I can't.

316
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:01,291
If I do, then what was
the point of all of this?

317
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,958
The work. Enduring.

318
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,625
Suffering this abuse?

00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:13,208
Mai Tomoda from Ishii Middle.

320
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:19,083
My name's Nozomi Ishizawa
from Totsuka Middle School.

321
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:24,250
Did she say Totsuka?
That was Nagisa's school.

322
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:27,000
Do you think she's better
at playing badminton?

323
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,500
I mean she has to be,

324
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,541
otherwise she wouldn't have
