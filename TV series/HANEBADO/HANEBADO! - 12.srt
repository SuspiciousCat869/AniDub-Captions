A smash or a cut?

[AYANO]
I'm okay now.

Oh? That's good.

I'm not expecting you
to be bring me a gift,

but those chocolates
you brought back

00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:12,916

[AYANO]
You know, I didn't really lose.

10
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:28,958
I mean, every other time
we played, I won.

11
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:30,458
I got so sick of it.

12
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:32,666
I decided not to
push myself as hard.

13
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:37,916
But I didn't expect her
to get worked up like that.

14
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:41,666
So, you see,
I didn't really lose.

00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:01,166
You're coming back,
aren't you, Mom?

Don't go!

[AYANO]
Please don't leave me.

19
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:19,000
You've really become
quite a sneaky player,

20

haven't you, Nagisa?

21

Then again...

00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,875
what I think is

23
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:27,541
you don't want me
to see that smash of yours.

24
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,583
[NAGISA]
Stay calm.

25
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:32,833
If she riles you,
you'll lose control of the game.

[badminton volleying]

27
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,125
[gasping] She's going
to force her way through?

[giggles]

30
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,708
I want to know why
you walked out on Ayano

31
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:34,958
and left her behind.

32
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,416
You're her best friend.

33
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,250
Always by her side
all these years.

Thank you.

[UCHIKA]
The short version is

36
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,333
I wanted to develop
Ayano's talent.

37
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,083
Have it grow
as much as it could.

[AYANO whining]

Well, that's all for today.

Aw! But that's not fair!
Aw, one more!

41
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,416
[UCHIKA]
If you want longer games,

42
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,625
you'll need to become

43
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,500
a much better player
than you are now.

44
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,000
[AYANO]
But if I play you,

45
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:26,083
I will get better!
Mom, please! Just one more time!

46

Guess she took my advice.

[YOUNG AYANO exerting]

48
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:44,000
[UCHIKA] At that moment,
I could plainly see.

49
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:47,958
She was only invested
in badminton for my sake.

50
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:51,416
That's why?
You left her because of that?

51
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,416
[REFEREE]
One, two.

52
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
What the heck is going on
over there?

53
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:07,500
It was all vroom,
then zwoo! How?

54
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,375
You've seen
a cut smash before.

55
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,208
Well, sure!
But when I try to pull them off,

56
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:13,083
they don't look
anything like hers did!

57
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,583
That's probably because
you play right-handed.

58
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,916
You make it sound
like a bad thing.

59
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,250
[NAGISA]
I need to turn things around.

[KURA]
Her doubt's showing.

61

to pick up on that.

There it goes! The same curve!

00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:36,958
[KAORUKO]
Look at this birdie.

65
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,583
The feathers
run counterclockwise.

66
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:43,250
Meaning, if a southpaw hits
with a cut smash,

67
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,833
it gives the shuttlecock
a wild spin.

68
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:49,041
Or as it's also known,
a crossfire.

69
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,750
[NAGISA]
I can't let this bother me.

70
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:54,875
Otherwise, I'll lose
even more initiative.

One more time.

[KAORUKO] By removing both feet
from the ground,

78
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:32,916
she was able
to soften the impact

79
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,916
as well as place herself
just far enough away

80
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,125
to make the perfect net shot.

Ayano, you beautiful monster.

That's not the sort of move
you can pull out of thin air.

It must have taken
Hanesaki years of practice

84
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,291
in order to master.

There's sweat on the court.

[NAGISA]
From this point forward,

I won't be surprised
by anything you throw at me.

88
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,458
Then again, I was never
under the delusion

89
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,750
I could overwhelm you, anyway.

then this was all for nothing!

[UCHIKA]
I may be an awful parent.

96
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:19,166
Badminton always came first,
even before my duty as a mother.

97
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,000
Because I wanted
to open her eyes

98

and show her how far skill
can take you in life.

99
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:28,375
We're talking about a sport.

100
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:31,083
You make it sound like
some kind of philosophy.

101
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,833
[UCHIKA] There's only
a very small number of people

102

who can make a living
being a professional athlete.

103
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,500
Even if you achieve that,

104
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:41,416
one injury can end it
all in an instant.

105
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,958
Dedicating your life to a sport

106
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,875
hardly seems like
a worthwhile endeavor.

107
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,583
But it is.

108
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:51,000
Feeling your body move
the way you want it to.

109

Controlling the path
of the shuttlecock

like it's an extension
of yourself.

They're at game point!

You can tell Ayano is
way more determined than usual.

She is. Definitely.

is equally intriguing.

I want to be clear.

00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,250
[MIYAKO]
She's on the offense.

161
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,958
Meanwhile, you have Aragaki
putting up a strong defense.

162
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:19,541
It's like they switched styles
with each other.

163
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,708
What gives?
She didn't smash it?

164
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,625
Yeah!

165
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,166
[YU]
It's getting close.

166
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,208
Aya's losing her cool.
What's wrong with her?

167
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:50,458
Ayano doesn't understand
what terrifies her opponent.

168
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:53,541
See, the most frightening way
to face her is in a rally.

169
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,791
She uses an unusually
fast return speed,

170
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,958
stealing your ability
to think.

171
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:04,208
Let's say you adopt large clears
to counter her reflexes.

172
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:12,333
She'll answer by using shot
placement to rob you of stamina.

173
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,375
And typically, that works,

174
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:17,416
but Nagisa's strength
rivals male players'.

175
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,958
[REFEREE]
Fifteen, all.

176
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,666
[KAORUKO] She's been
freely offering up her stamina.

177
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:27,333
All to protect the one thing
she can't surrender!

178
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,666
And it's working!

179
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,666
She did it! The game's tied!

180
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,375
Go, Nagisa!

181
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:37,500
[AYANO panting]
There's no way I'll lose.

182
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:41,083
The idea of being defeated
by her, it's unthinkable!

183
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,833
I can't let that happen!

184
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,250
Because this time,
I'm going to win!

185
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,291
Then I'll abandon Mom!

186
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,125
-She returned it!
-There wasn't enough curve.

187
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,750
Ayano's swings
are becoming weaker!

188
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,666
[AYANO]
Time to retake the lead!

189
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,666
[CROWD cheering]

190
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,583
[REFEREE]
Sixteen, fifteen.

191
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,041
She's in the lead!

192
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,666
There's that jump smash
we've been waiting for.

193
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,750
And it couldn't have come
at a better time!

194
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:21,708
Not only for the score,
but psychologically too.

195
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:25,375
Nagisa traded stamina
to protect her key weapon,

196
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:28,916
her ability to think!

197
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,208
I said we'd have fun, right?

198
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,375
[AYANO]
Another short serve.

199
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:38,666
[TACHIBANA]
A split second too late.

200
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,958
[AYANO]
Make it big.

201
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,875
Hanesaki possesses
lightning-fast reflexes,

202
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,416
which allows her
to return birdies

203
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,958
while remaining
close to the net,

204
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:47,625
shots most can't make.

205
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:49,583
However...

206
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:56,375
if she keeps refusing
to move any closer,

207
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:57,958
it won't make a difference.

208
00:14:58,041 --> 00:14:59,000
She's out of gas?

209
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,708
[NAGISA panting]

210
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:05,833
I know the exact expression
on Ayano's face.

211
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,875
I don't even need a clear view.

212
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,291
Whenever things get tough,

213
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,375
it means you've got
to take a step forward!

214
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:14,583
Was that a cheer?

215
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:18,791
[AYANO]
Shut up. I'm going to.

216
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,375
I don't need you telling me.

217
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,041
-No!
-Good.

00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,083
Got it!

00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:48,583
-Yes!
-What? That was in bounds!

220
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:49,541
[REFEREE]
It was out.

221
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:02,333
[HAYAMA]
Talk about a comeback!

222
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:03,708
She's made it to game point.

223
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,500
[GAKU] Refusing to use her smash
in the first set

224
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,500
is paying off now.

225
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:10,000
Come on!

226
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,583

You totally won!

[NAGSIA] Easy! All I did was
manage to tie the match.

00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,958
[RIKO]
Yeah, but it's still a big deal!

Right, you need a drink.

[TACHIBANA]
Aragaki.

236
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,750
Let me check.

How's this?

-[NAGISA] Fine.

240
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,208
[TACHIBANA]
And this?

241
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,500
What'd I just say?

242
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,833
[TACHIBANA]
Promise me one thing.

243
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:56,083
If you start feeling like
you can't go on at any point,

244
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:59,250
you don't have to say a word.
Just look over at me.

245
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:02,583
I'll make the call
and end the game.

246
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,583
Thanks for offering.

247
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:08,250
Thing is... I might look
your way accidentally

248
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:11,125
after scoring another point.
[laughs]

249
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:15,333
I'll be sure
to tell the difference.

250
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,208
Are you okay?

251
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,000
Do me favor. Quit pretending.

252
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:31,583
I know you're on Nagisa's side.
You all want me to lose.

253
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,750
Like I can't tell what
you're really thinking.

254
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:36,541
What? No.

255
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:41,458
Leave me alone. You're annoying.

Game number three!
Love, all! Let's play!

260
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:58,458
[NAGISA] It's the final stage.
Things are getting exciting.

261
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,875
[AYANO]
I'll be abandoned again.

Don't go!

I need to be better than good.

Otherwise,
I'm useless to everyone.

265
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,416
I have to win.

If I don't,
nobody will ever need me.

[AYANO giggling] Well,
what do I need boys for?

I'm happy enough just being
in the same class as you.

You're looking so adorable, Aya!

Huh? Did you call me "Aya"?

[ELENA] Turned out
pretty well, didn't it?

280
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,458
It feels like
we're part of a team now.

281
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,166
Part of a team.

282
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:28,125
All right, time to win
and be a part of this team.

283
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,500

She said she abandoned me

284
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,916
so I would become
a better player.

Isn't that funny?

I feel so dumb,
withdrawing like I did.

287
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:40,708
Now that I think about it,

288
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:43,291
I'm glad I didn't stop
playing badminton.

289
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:47,583
Because back then,
Mom was the one who deserted me.

290
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:51,708
But this time,
I'm going to abandon her.

to the badminton club.

I wanted to go.
Play in the finals same as you.

00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:52,583
But you know what?
It didn't work out that way.

holding this back,

Just do your best!

off the hook if you lose!

Get back in and fight!

Nice to have a team

But here, out on
this badminton court,

there's only you and me.
Nobody else can enter it.
