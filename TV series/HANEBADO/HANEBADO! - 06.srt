1
00:00:10,083 --> 00:00:12,250
[MIYAKO exclaiming] No! This
one's definitely the cutest!

2
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:15,000
Having a model really helps
with the visualization process!

3
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:16,958
No problem. What are these?

4
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:18,958
Your new uniforms of course!

5
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:20,291
They need to be ordered today,

6
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:22,458
or we won't have them
for the prelims!

7
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:24,041
How about this design?

8
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:25,791
[sighs]

9
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:27,416
Instead of short
and distracting,

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,833
why don't we go
with a more classic approach?

11
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:32,000
The look we've been using
never goes out of style.

12
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:33,333
I say we stick with--

13
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:35,541
-[MIYAKO] It's old-fashioned!
-[TACHIBANA] Old?

14
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:38,333
You're hopeless.
Allow me to enlighten you.

15
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:40,375
Cute outfits
give women confidence,

16
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:42,500
and that's the attitude we need
for the prelims!

17
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:45,041
'Cause we have a date
with destiny, and guess what!

18
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:46,416
We gotta have new clothes!

19
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,375
With the right fashion,
there's nothing we can't do!

20
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:51,125
[laughing]

21
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,833
I still don't get
why it's so important

22
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:55,666
for us to switch uniforms.

23
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,916
I would've been fine
wearing the same thing.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,166
You know, I like the idea

25
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,916
of the team having
a brand-new look.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,291
Not you too.

27
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:04,916
It lends us that Kitakomachi
High School 2.0 feeling!

28
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,291
First, we got Coach Tachibana.
Then Ayano joined the club.

29
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:13,291
Plus Elena's become our manager.

30
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,000
With all the changes
that have happened,

31
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:17,875
this year feels completely
different from the previous one.

32
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:20,000
To keep the trend going,

33
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:22,833
I'm gonna do my best
to make it to nationals.

34
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,875
After all,
it is our last summer.

35
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:28,750
[RIKO]
Let's both do our best, Nagisa.

36
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:30,000
[NAGISA]
You bet.

37
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,250
The captain's ruthless.

38
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:06,333
Yeah, but that's
why we love her so much.

39
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,750
[NAGISA]
Look alive out there!

40
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:11,166
Are your feet made of cement?

41
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,458
Is it just me,
or does she seem different?

42
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:14,875
Mm-hmm.

43
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:17,958
She'll always be tough as nails,
but yeah, she's changed.

44
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,166
Oh, sure,
Nagisa's come a long way,

45
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,750
but I was talking about Riko.

46
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,333
Huh? Riko?

47
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,125
Come on! You could have
returned that shot!

48
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,541
One more time.

49
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,416
[NAGISA]
I can't hear you.

50
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,666
One more time!

51
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,875
I didn't catch that!

52
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,791
-One more time!
-Shout it loud!

53
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,208
One more time!

54
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,458
[ELENA]
Dang, look at Ayano go.

55
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,750
She's totally invested
in the drill.

56
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,041
[CONNIE] It doesn't matter
if you belong to a team.

57
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,583
If she doesn't acknowledge you,

58
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:03,541
there's no point
in playing badminton, is there?

59
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,500
[TACHIBANA]
Okay, Hayama, you're up!

60
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:06,750
[HAYAMA]
Let's do this!

61
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,000
[ELENA]
Ayano?

62
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,666
Are you okay?

63
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,125
Yeah, of course.

64
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,916
[NAGISA]
They published the brackets.

65
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,291
Oh, wow. Hey. I found me!

66
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:33,250
These match-ups are legendary!
What did you get, Sora?

67
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,916
I'll say this much.

68
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,041
It's better than
last year at least.

69
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,416
[YU]
Check it out!

70
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,750
Your third round is
against Hashizume from Shoei.

71
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,375
Don't you think
you should focus more

72
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,500
on the matches
you're going to be playing?

73
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:45,666
[YU]
Eh...

74
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,958
By the way,
how did you make out, Riko?

75
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,291
-[gasping]
-[YU] Huh?

76
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,416
She's scheduled to play
Ishizawa the first round.

77
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,041
[ELENA]
What's the big deal?

78
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,583
Is she any good?

79
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:03,000
[RIKO]
In the final four last year.

80
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,291
And it's kind of weird

81
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,666
since she and I went
to the same middle school.

82
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,041
Ah, an old friend, huh?

83
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:12,000
Kinda sounds like the ultimate
showdown with destiny

84
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:13,833
if you ask me!

85
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,916
Well, catch ya later!

86
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:22,500
You'll do fine!

87
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,208
After all the training
you've put in,

88
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,375
I know you can beat--

89
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,000
Hey, Riko, how far
did you get last year?

90
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:34,000
Well, I lost in the third round.

91
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,958
[AYANO] Hmm.
It might be tough for you then.

92
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:51,041
For real! Talk about bad luck
for my last time.

93
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,833
[NAGISA] What did you mean
back in the locker room?

94
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,166
[RIKO]
Which part?

95
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,291
[NAGISA] The whole thing
about having bad luck?

96
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:05,750
[RIKO sighs]
I was only joking.

97
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,166
But still...

98
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,875
It sounds like you're already
throwing in the towel

99
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:10,958
before the match has even--

100
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,041
[RIKO]
I'm not.

101
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,125
[RIKO] But come on.
I'll be up against Nozomi.

102
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,875
She's got zero stamina.

103
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,291
As a matter of fact,

104
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,416
she's usually exhausted
by the second half of the game.

105
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,750
If you can stretch out
the rallies

106
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,333
and wear her out,
you'd probably--

107
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,166
[RIKO]
That's how you would play her!

108
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,250
I'm not the same as you!

109
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,791
I never said you were.
I was trying to help.

110
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:47,500
Do... Do you really think
I stand a chance?

111
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,291
That I could beat her?

112
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:54,125
Your whole speech about
working hard over the summer,

113
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:55,666
did you mean a word of it?

114
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,958
I'm not good enough!

115
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:04,083
So what was all the training
you've been putting in this year

116
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,708
leading up to?

117
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,333
Don't you want to win, Riko?

118
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,666
Do whatever you want!

119
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,708
What I want is...

120
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,333
Are you not
feeling good, big sis?

121
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:43,291
-Shhh!
-No, it's all right.

122
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,958
[RIKO]
Guess I'd better make dinner.

123
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,666
[giggles happily]

124
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:12,500
[grumbling]
Damn it!

125
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,791
[exhales] I didn't know
there'd be this many people.

126
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,125
If I'm nervous,

127
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,791
I can't imagine what
the rest of you are feeling.

128
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,875
Elena, do your best!

129
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,958
Don't worry.
I'm not the one who's playing.

130
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,708
[SASA]
Don't leave me behind!

131
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:50,500
Not so fast, or I'll lose you
in this sea of people!

132
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:51,833
Do me a favor.

133
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,833
Stop embarrassing me
in front of the competition.

134
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,541
You betcha!

135
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,583
Isn't that the same girl
who challenged you a while back?

136
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,625
Yeah, Kaoruko.

137
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,125
Every year is
a different experience.

138
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,041
Weird how we're matched up
the first round.

139
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,000
Look...

140
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,125
Let's leave here
with no regrets.

141
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,166
I'll see you soon.

142
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,750
[TACHIBANA] Here we are,
the Inter-High prelims

143
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,625
leading up
to the August tournament.

144
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:47,625
For you third-years,
this is your last summer.

145
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,458
I just have one thing to say.

146
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,291
Have fun out there!

147
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,416
[ALL]
Yes, sir.

148
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,083
[MIYAKO]
Aren't you forgetting something?

149
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,000
[ALL]
Huh?

150
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,125
[panting]
Oh, I don't know.

151
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,916
The most important part
of the competition?

152
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
[ALL]
Huh?

153
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,333
[grumbles angrily]
Your new uniforms!

154
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,083
What else would
I be talking about?

155
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,875
They barely made it in time
for the competition,

156
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:08,625
and go figure,
when they finally arrived,

157
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,333
the school's name wasn't
embroidered on the back

158
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,166
like it should have been,
so I had to do it myself!

159
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,791
Oh! I feel so legit!

All the above? Mm-hmm.

162
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,875
[ELENA] Girls' singles go
to semi-finals on the first day,

163
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,875
while the boys
will play next week.

164
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,208
[ELENA] Will they really get
through all these matches?

165
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:33,583
There's so many.

166
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,916
A spillover day is set aside
in case things run long,

167
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,416
but it's rare,

168
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,333
since they keep matches going
on every court available.

169
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:40,458
Huh?

170
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,416
Pacing yourself
is the key factor.

171
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,083
Otherwise, you won't make it
through the tournament.

172
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,125

the players have it rough.

without a care in the world.

What do you expect?

176
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,041
The poor baby pulled
an all-nighter.

177
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,166
Say, before
my match gets underway,

178
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,000
maybe I can sneak in
a nap or two.

179
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,125
But I kid.

180
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,541
Be honest.
Aren't you a little nervous?

181

Yeah, yeah.

00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,791
Guess it's not a big deal.

00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,750
Seeing how
I'm only a second-year.

While I can't speak

How are you feeling?
Seems you're distracted.

Uh, nope! Perfectly fine here!

It's just... I got swept up

[RIKO]
Uh... Um, there's three.

220
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,791
Hmm. When you feel yourself
in a spiral,

221
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,458
I find the best way
to break free is

222
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,916
by thinking of something else
and resetting your brain.

223
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,166
Once you've settled down,
then head back to the court.

224
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,166
Incidentally,
the answer is four!

225
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,958
Well, if you're gonna be sneaky!

226

[TACHIBANA laughs]

227
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,833
It worked. Your head's cleared?

228
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:13,208
Sometimes you have to
be sneaky in badminton.

229

[RIKO]
The first one was over here.

230

Repeated backcourt forehands.

She's not doing homework,
right, guys?

232
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:25,041
[RIKO]
Then she returned my shot.

233
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:28,250
It dropped shallow.
Then I hit it to her forehand.

234
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,000
[RIKO]
I can't be certain.

235
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,833
But at this point,
it's worth a try!

[RIKO]
I knew it!

243
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:04,333
Nozomi wanted me to return
the birdie to her forehand.

244
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,875
She's tried to make me hit
to that side

245
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:08,291
the whole time,
even when it was risky,

246
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,875
because she doesn't like
using her backhand!

247
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,625
[NOZOMI grunting]

248
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,958
[RIKO] The return is weaker
than her forehand,

249
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,416
and the placement's sloppier.

250

[NOZOMI]
Knock it off!

252

[GAKU]
Was that a cut smash?

253
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,916
Her opponent
has got serious talent.

254
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,416
No joke.

255
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,875
Nozomi swung like she was going
to return a normal smash.

256
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,875
Then delivered a slice
like it was nothing,

257
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:38,458
and right in the middle
of a high-speed rally too.

258
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,666
[RIKO]
She's switching up her timing,

259
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,375
and the smashes,
they're way faster than before.

260
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:47,125
I can't keep up
with all the changes!

00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,416

[RIKO]
Here's what I know.

268
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,500
I can't hit a smash like Nagisa,

269
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,666
and I don't have
lightning-fast reflexes,

270
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,375
not the way Ayano does.

271
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:50,541
But what I've always done
is thrown myself into the game.

272
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:53,500
I can't quit. Not now.

273

Why did you hand-deliver her
the point?

276
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,250
-Yes! She returned it!
-Barely.

277
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,625
See that? It's not just luck!

278
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,000
She must have figured out a way

279
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,666
to get past
Nozomi's smash technique.

280
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,041
Or maybe her shots are weaker
because she's tired?

281
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,291
-Neither. Look closer.
-Huh?

282
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:19,625
[GAKU] Izumi's objective isn't
to maintain a high-speed rally.

283
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:22,541
Instead, she's using big clears
to give herself more time

284
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,583
until her opponent
makes the return.

285
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,083
Which is allowing her
to get in position

286
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:28,125
and make the return,
despite how unpredictable

287
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,958
the pacing
of Nozomi's shots are.

288
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:32,541
If she keeps this up,
doesn't that mean

You got that right.

317
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,791
[ELENA, tearfully]
Riko.

318
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,750
[RIKO]
What's with the tears?

319
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,708
There's no reason
to get upset over a game!

320
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,375
[ELENA] I don't know
what you're talking about.

321
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:35,666
I'm not crying.

322
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,041
[RIKO] Ayano should still be
playing her match.

323
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,666
What do you say
we go cheer her on?

324
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,000
-Sound good?
-[ELENA sniffles] Sure.

325
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,625
Yeah!

326
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:54,708
Yes!

327
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:57,000
[CROWD cheering]

328
00:19:57,083 --> 00:20:00,000
What did she say?
[laughing]

329
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:03,000
[sighing happily]

330
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:29,250
Oh, hey. Is Ayano's match
already over with?

331
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:36,125
She's really good at badminton.

332
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,833
[NAGISA]
I get it, okay?

333
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,750
I know how you feel, Riko.

334
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,750
I've been there too.

335
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:51,166
[RIKO crying]

336
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:59,500
Nagisa, I really...

337
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:06,208
I wanted to win so bad.

338
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,208
I wanted to win!

339
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:10,958
[RIKO sobbing]

340
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:29,708
[REFEREE]
Game.

341
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:32,250
Match won by Christiansen
from Fredericia Girls.

342
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:36,500
Great as always.

343
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,375
I have to find someone.

344
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,125
Oh, who are you looking for?

345
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:43,375
My mama. She's arrived.

346
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:47,833
[AYANO]
I was hoping for a workout,

347
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:49,791
but I'll settle for a warm-up.

348
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,583
[HAYAMA] Three matches
and hardly breaking a sweat.

349
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,958
Little Ayano, the juggernaut.

350
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:57,000
I mean, it took every ounce
of oomph in me

351
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,000
just to make it
past the first round.

352
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:01,333
Then again, guess that's down
to the difference in talent

353
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:03,375
between me and Aya.

354
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:05,500
-[HAYAMA] It's a little early...
-[YU and SORA] Huh?

355
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:10,125
To start bringing talent
into it, don't you think so?

356
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:12,708
[UCHIKA] Are you
the Kitakomachi students?

357
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:15,375
That would be us.
How can we help you?

358
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:16,958
Do you know which court

359
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:19,416
Ayano Hanesaki
is supposed to play on?

360
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,416
[KAORUKO]
Brought you a gift.

361
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:28,625
[AYANO]
A handkerchief?

362
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:30,125
[KAORUKO]
You're gonna need it...

363
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:32,416
for drying your tears
after losing to me.

364
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,333
Or maybe...

365
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:36,750
wiping away snot
if you happen to get sick.
