Why am I even doing this?

Where are you going?
Don't leave, Mom.

00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:27,750
What am I...
What am I playing badminton for?

[NAGISA]
Why am I even doing this?

What am I playing badminton for?

7
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:27,875
[CHO] Such healthy appetites!
Like mother, like daughter.

8
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:30,083
But then you're so active,

9
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:32,083
and going through
a growth spurt too.

10
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:35,125
I'm pretty sure my days
of growing are over with.

11

It doesn't matter
how old you get,

I'll always see you
as my child, Uchika.

But we're having cake
for dessert!

Oh, Uchika, is Ayano even
on speaking terms with you?

Not exactly,

May I come in?

22
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,750
[UCHIKA] I remember when
you craved my acknowledgment

23
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,625
above anything else.

24
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,958
Always wanting to be by my side.

25
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,708
That's why you played badminton.

26
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,666
But you don't need me anymore.
You can play on your own.

27
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,875
Pretty well, I might add.

28
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:29,916
[UCHIKA] That's why I'm here,
the reason I came back.

29
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,083
Nagisa seems
pretty on edge.

30
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:43,250
Well, there are only three days
to go until the finals.

31
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,916
That's true, I guess.

32
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,208
Plus, it's gonna be
quite the re-match.

33
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,250
Speaking of, have you noticed

34
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:52,041
how Aya's been acting
spaced out recently?

35
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:55,750
Yeah. In fact I'd say
it's a pretty common occurrence.

36
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,375
Ugh!

37
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,250

-Hey, Yu.

41
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,750
And you brought Gaku!

42
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,250
Don't you need to be studying
for entrance exams?

43
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:16,375
[gulps] Why are you only looking
at me when you say that?

44
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,375
I should be hitting
the books too,

45
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,916
but thought I'd stop by

46
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,375
in case anyone needed help
or to practice.

47
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:25,375
Exactly. That's the same
reason we're here.

48
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:26,791
-Right?
-Huh?

49
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,916
Well, Gaku's smart enough
to be in the top ten,

50
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,625
so he doesn't need
to study that hard.

51
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,791
Where does Hayama
stand academically?

52
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:36,375

He's, um...

56
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,958
Well, I'm sure he's not
in the bottom ten, right?

57
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,208
What? How could you ask that?

58
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,541
So I guess you're ranked higher

59
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,833
than the bottom 20 students
in your year?

60

Uh...
We're off topic!

I'm here because of my love
for the game!

you and I play?

in the zone.

He's playing way better
than at the prelims.

67

You're right, but Aya's not
letting anything through.

68
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,583
Her defense is amazing.

69
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,916
Makes sense.
Uchika Shindo trained her,

70
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,916
and she's a ten-time
consecutive national champ.

Asking you to coach was one
of the best decisions I've made.

160
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,375
I can't take credit.

161
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:34,125
She did the work...
both on and off the court.

162
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,791
It's only been three months,

163
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:38,625
but she's become a much
stronger athlete than before.

164
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:41,625
You mean the way
her playing has improved?

165
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:44,375
Her technique's definitely
come a long way,

166
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,833
but most of all,
I mean her mental state.

167
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,375
From watching her,

168
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:51,375
I can tell she's got
what it takes to be a champion.

169
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,333
[MIYAKO]
What about Ayano?

170
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:01,083
I had a feeling
she'd make it to this point.

171
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:03,875
And she's certainly
throwing herself

172
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:05,750
into the game with abandon.

173
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:08,250
I guess, she really does have

174
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,958
some kind of natural talent
for badminton.

175
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,958
Tachibana, you've always
focused on working hard,

176
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,916
but there's a player
you've ignored

177
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,208
because you thought she didn't
need anything from you.

178
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,458
The way you coached Nagisa,

179
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:24,500
you put in the time figuring out
what she needed to get better.

180
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:30,250
But what about Ayano?
She deserves the same treatment.

181
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:33,000
No one's born knowing
how to play badminton

182
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:35,833
or good the moment
they pick up a racket.

183
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,708
You shouldn't draw
such a hard line

184
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,291
between effort and talent.

185
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,666
What I'm saying is...

186
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:45,458
Ayano, well... she's put in
the effort that she needed to,

187
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:46,958
day after day,

188
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,916
in order to become
the kind of athlete she is now.

189
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,166
In that way,
she's just like Nagisa.

190
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,208
[YU] I'm free.
You want to play, Aya?

191
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:02,708
No.

192
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,458
[RIKO]
Should we move on to smashes?

193
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,541
No, I'm done for now.

194
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:14,041
Don't wanna give her too much
to work with.

195
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,208
Both of you, do your best
out there, okay?

196
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:22,416
Sure.

197
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,333
[YU]
You work hard, too, Aya!

198
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,208
[AYANO]
I don't need any encouragement.

199
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,333
[YU] Um, I didn't mean
to insult you.

200
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,708
It's not like cheering
or wishing someone luck

201
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,166
makes them play better.

202
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,625
Wait. If you think it might
help Nagisa somehow,

203
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,291
then that's
a different story! Go ahead!

204
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,250
In fact,
it'd probably be better

205
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,458
if you all encouraged her
for my sake!

206
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,916
At least, then she might give me
a decent run for my money.

207
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,166
Can we have a word alone?

208
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,541
Huh?

209
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,625
[ELENA] Why did you talk
to them like that?

210
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:56,083
You realize they
were offering support?

211
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,833
Why can't you be gracious
and accept it?

212
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,916
[AYANO]
Because it's stupid and fake.

213
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,583
Acting like we're
all best buddies.

214
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:07,500
[ELENA] Are you having fun
playing badminton this way?

215
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,916
I don't get you.
What're you fighting for, Ayano?

216
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:19,583
Mom's here, finally.
She came back home.

217
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:22,000
She said she abandoned me

218
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:24,750
so I would become
a better player.

219
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:27,125
[laughing]
Isn't that funny?

220
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,833
I feel dumb withdrawing
like I did.

221
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,458
Now that I think about it,

222
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,833
I'm glad I didn't stop
playing badminton.

223
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:37,083
Because back then,
Mom was the one who deserted me,

224
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:42,125
but this time,
I'm going to abandon her.

225
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,166
-[ELENA] This is all my fault.
-Huh?

226
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:48,708
[ELENA] I'm the one
who brought you

227
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:49,875
to the badminton club.

228
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,666
[ELENA gasping]

229
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,916
[RIKO]
It's time. You ready?

230
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,875
[NAGISA]
I'm going to win.

231
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:20,458
This year,
I'm going to defeat myself.

232
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:31,166
[RIKO] Nagisa, you're no longer
the person you were back then.

233
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:46,125
[exhales deeply]

234
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:52,416
[NAGISA] You were wearing
the same expression a year ago.

235
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,833
[AYANO]
I have a question.

236
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,750
Why do you play badminton?

237
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,083
[NAGISA]
Because--

238
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,125
Let me guess.
You love it, right?

239
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:07,250
[AYANO]
You people, I swear.

240
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:11,041
[ANNOUNCER]
The Kanagawa Prefecture

241
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:14,375
Girls' Singles Finals
will now commence.

242
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:18,708
From Kitakomachi High School,
Hanesaki, first year.

243
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,916
Also from Kitakomachi
High School,

244
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,500
Aragaki, third year.

245
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:29,791
Ayano... let's go have some fun.

246
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,083
Hey, be careful out there.

247
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,500
[REFEREE]
Players to the court.

248
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:53,041
-Hey, something wrong?
-Nope.

249
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,708
[REFEREE] On my right,
from Kitakomachi High School,

250
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,333
Ayano Hanesaki.

251
00:17:57,416 --> 00:18:01,958
Also from Kitakomachi,
on my left side, Nagisa Aragaki.

252
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,375
Hanesaki to serve.

253
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:13,666
[NAGISA]
When I played you last year,

254
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:17,083
it wasn't just that you were
a stronger player than me.

255
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:21,708
I had a flaw I was blind to,
a weakness in spirit!

256
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,708
[REFEREE]
Love, all. Play!

257
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,833
[NAGISA] First up, she'll make
me pick up some low shots,

258
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,583
reading the trajectory
of my racket.

259
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,500
Ayano's playing
really cautiously

260
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,375
for someone with such a giant
superiority complex.

261
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:43,666
[KAORUKO]
She'll start with lobs,

262
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,541
sending her opponent back.

263
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,541
That'll cause the rally's
initiative to balance out.

264
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:51,333
[NAGISA]
It's okay. I'm staying calm.

265
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:54,833
I see it, the entire court.
I feel it!

266
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:59,500
[BOTH exerting]

267
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,083
[REFEREE]
One, love.

268
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,791
Pretty quiet start
to the match, huh?

269
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,958
Scoring the first point
is significant.

270
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,791
It gives you a mental edge.

271
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,750
Her uncertainty's growing.

272
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,458
She's the kind of player
who plans out her match

273
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,666
while observing her opponent.

274
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,208
Based on their history,
she was probably hoping

275
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,625
for a game facing
an aggressive Nagisa.

276
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:24,791
But her opponent realized that
and went against type.

277
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,000
[NAGISA] That first rally
ought to introduce the idea

278
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,583
of diagonal shots
into her head.

279
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:34,583
I want to get as far as I can
without using smashes.

280
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:40,000
Once I do, her eyes will adjust
instantly to them,

281
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:43,125
and the game is
basically over. Meaning...

282
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,333
A smash?

283
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,000
-No.
-A cut?

284
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,583
[NAGISA]
I'll rely on cuts and drops

285
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,625
to constantly
put her off-balance!

286
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:53,583
More than likely, she wants
to keep Ayano confined

287
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:54,708
to the rearcourt.

288
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,291
[AYANO grunting]

289
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,958
[NAGISA]
She's on guard.

290
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,625
Waiting for a smash
at point-blank range.

291
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,625
Ayano's more
in control of things,

292
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,833
if she continues
driving her opponent back

293
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:05,916
while pressing forward.

294
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,833
However, the more they maintain

295
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,500
a back-and-forth
from the midcourt,

296
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,833
the more Nagisa is in control.

297
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,583
From Ayano's viewpoint,

298
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:16,375
the question is when to force
her opponent away.

299
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,583
[KAORUKO]
A simple arrangement would be

300
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,750
a series of repeated shots
to the rearcourt

301
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:23,000
in order to focus the other
player's attention there.

302
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,750
Then use a cut disguised
as a smash,

303
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:28,583
catching her off guard
and scoring the point.

304
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,500
That would be ideal.

305
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,791
She'd get
a perfectly good ace that way.

306
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:35,541
And by making her opponent
lift up low shots,

307
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,416
Ayano would have
control of the game.

308
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,000
[NAGISA]
But you can't afford

309
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,708
to stick with
simple arrangement, can you?

310
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:44,791
Because you never know
when I'll throw in a smash.

311
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:47,833
So your mind has started
making the game complicated,

312
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,166
filling up with more scenarios

313
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,791
than you actually
need to think about!

314
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:55,166
[AYANO] A smash!
She threw me off.

315
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,791
[NAGISA] And what's producing
all those options

316
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:58,875
is your uncertainty!

317
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,625
[AYANO]
A smash? Or a cut?

318
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,208
-All right!
-[CROWD cheering]

319
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:10,583
[REFEREE]
Two, love.

320
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:13,500
-That was totally unexpected.
-[GAKU] Yeah.

321
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:15,625
[gasping]

322
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,958
[breathing heavily]

323
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,208
Huh?

324
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:31,291
[thudding]

325
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:43,000
It's been a while, hasn't it?

326
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:46,625
-[UCHIKA] Uh, you are?
-Elena Fujisawa.

327
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,291
I've been friends with Ayano
since kindergarten.

328
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:54,083
[gasps] Elena!
Of course I remember you!

329
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:02,666
[ELENA] Um, this may seem weird,
me coming to you now.

330
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:11,833
I wanted to have a conversation
with you about Ayano.

331
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:19,500
[NAGISA]
So far, so good.

332
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:21,958
But those points had
the element of surprise.

333
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:24,125
The real trouble's coming.

334
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:29,333
You've really become
quite a sneaky player,

335
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:30,875
haven't you, Nagisa?

336
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:33,083
Then again...

337
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:34,833
what I think is

338
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:38,375
you don't want me to see
that smash of yours.
