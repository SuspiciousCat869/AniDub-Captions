00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,666
so I'm gonna need you
to stick close by.

159
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,250
Okay, let's go.

160
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,208
Wait. I know you.

[AYANO]
Nah.

164
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:03,291
Hey, are you really going
to join the tennis club?

165
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,958
[ELENA] Why not? There's
plenty of hotties there.

166
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,000
Wanna come with?

167

Hmm.

Come on. Say yes.

[NAGISA] You're a third-year.
Underclassmen look up to you.

175
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,958
You want to set a good
example for them, right?

176
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,208
[YUKA] Stop taking
your anger out on me.

177
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,875
And what's that
supposed to mean?

00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,916
I don't think it
needs any explaining.

Okay, guys, break it up.

Uh-oh.

00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:32,458
If you don't have any intention
of getting better...

182
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,250
...then just quit.

Wow, they're really going at

187
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,333
each other's throats,
aren't they?

188
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,625
You think I can't see that?

189
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,875
What is with her?

190
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,833
Guess everyone's
lashing out today.

[RIKO]
Nagisa, do something!

192
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:10,208
[NAGISA] Anyone who won't
put the work in should quit.

193
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:13,541
If they won't do that,
then they don't belong here.

194

You need to realize,

195
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,916
not all of us can
do this like you.

One more.

This time, I want you
to play for real.

[TACHIBANA] Back up.
I should introduce myself.

a future gold medal winner!

316
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,583
[MIYAKO squeals]

317
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:23,791
[BOTH]
Huh?

318
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:26,250
That's cool, but a
gold medal in what?

319
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:29,625
What have I been talking about?
The Olympics, of course!

320
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:30,791
[HAYAMA]
Could you imagine?

321
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:32,916
Although I have to ask,

322
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,750
do you have any other club
members hiding somewhere?

323
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,750
[ELENA] Stop complaining
and just come on!

324
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,291
[AYANO]
No!

325
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,000
[ELENA]
Ayano!

326
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,583
Hey there!

327
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,500
Hurry up! You're doing this!

328
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,583
The girl from yesterday?

329
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:54,166
But why? Elena?

330
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,625
[ELENA]
Because...

331
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:59,791
[ELENA] I really think you
should be playing badminton.

332
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:03,291
I mean, you've got crazy talent!

333
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,583
[ELENA]
If you keep running away,

334
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:10,458
you'll never be able
to move forward.

335
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,916
[TACHIBANA] She's right.
What you have can't be taught.

336
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,458
[ELENA gasps]
Back off, pervert!

337
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:18,416
[TACHIBANA] For the
last time, I'm not a perv!

338
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,250
I'm the coach here, all right?

339
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:22,041
What I'm saying is...

340
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:25,208
The spring in your legs,
your kinetic vision,

341
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:26,875
the suppleness of your wrist,

342
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:28,666
plus the fact that
you're left-handed.

343
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,583
You have all the
natural elements

344
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:32,000
that practice can't give you.

345
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:35,416
It's almost like you were
born to play badminton!

346
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,791
[AYANO]
Please stop.

347
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:37,875
[BOTH gasp]

348
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:39,875
[AYANO]
I'm not going to change my mind.

349
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,208
Why don't we have a
match to settle this?

350
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:43,416
[AYANO]
A match?

351
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,041
[ELENA]
You know, like making a wager!

352
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:46,791
"If I lose, I'll give up on you.

353
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:49,125
And If I win,
you'll join the club!"

354
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:50,500
That sort of thing!

355
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:53,000
This is straight out
of a <i>shonen</i> manga.

356
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:54,291
For real.

357
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:57,916
So, who's the best player
in this club anyway?

358
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:01,333
[ELENA chuckles]
No one's brave enough?

359
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:03,625
You do seem like a small club.

360
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:06,125
Don't you want a new player?

361
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:08,791
Or maybe you're
more afraid of losing.

362
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:11,875
[ELENA]
She is pretty good and only a...

363
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:13,375
[AYANO]
Will you cut it out?

364
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,791
I don't want to play badminton,
and that's final!

365
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:17,458
It's pointless, okay?

366
00:23:17,541 --> 00:23:19,916
[TACHIBANA] Come on.
You have so much talent.

367
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,875
You could be world-class if
you put a little effort in!

368
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:24,375
It's only a sport, though.

369
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:25,750
[TACHIBANA gasps]

370
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:27,666
[TACHIBANA]
Hey, don't be like that.

371
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,083
[AYANO]
It's true.

372
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:32,875
Playing badminton in a
club... is utterly pointless.

373
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:34,083
[gasps]

374
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:38,125
[RIKO] You don't know
what you're talking about!

375
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,083
It's not pointless!

376
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:45,750
[RIKO] Working your
fingers to the bone.

377
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:49,375
[RIKO]
Wanting so badly to win!

378
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,750
It's not pointless at all.

379
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:55,333
You don't have to get
so upset about it.

380
00:23:55,416 --> 00:23:56,291
[NAGISA]
I'll do it.

381
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:57,541
[ALL gasp]

382
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:02,833
You and me.

383
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:04,333
Let's play.
