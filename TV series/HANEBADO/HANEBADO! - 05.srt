00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,375
[REFEREE]
Eleven, seven! Interval!

163
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,333
[AYANO]
Um, Riko?

164
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:08,958
It looks like
we found our rhythm.

165
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:09,958
Let's keep this up.

166
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,375
[AYANO]
Okay!

167
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:16,166
Still think it's a good idea
to go it alone?

168
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,166
[CONNIE] I said I was doing this
on my own terms.

169
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,625
No one's interfering.

170
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,500
[SHIWAHIME]
For someone calling the shots,

171
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,166
you seem to be struggling.

172
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:30,625
Connie, let's play like a team.

173
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,291
[grumbling in frustration]

174
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,625

175
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,000
[AYANO]
They're cheering for me.

176
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,250
Get that point!

177
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,000
-[AYANO] I can't let them down.
-[REFEREE] Play.

178
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:44,250
[AYANO] I've got to win
and become part of a team!

179
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,208
[CONNIE]
Don't get cocky

180
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,125
just because you have
a slight lead right now!

181
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:55,708
Is it just me,

182
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,000
or are her shots faster
than before?

183
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,875
She's starting to get serious.

184
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,000
[CONNIE]
I don't need a team.

185
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:07,750
[CHILDREN laughing]

186
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,916
[CONNIE]
I'll win all by myself!

187
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,791
[REFEREE]
Fourteen all!

188
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,208
She caught up to them!

189
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:32,541
All right, girls, don't panic.
Keep your cool.

190
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,791
It'll be fine.
We'll get back in there.

191
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:37,833
[AYANO]
Yeah.

192
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,916
[CONNIE]
If I can't win this game...

193
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
[breathing heavily]

194
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,875
[AYANO]
I have to be part of the team.

195
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,083
I need to win.

196
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,666
[AYANO]
I can't lose.

197
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:03,750
[AYANO]
I can't lose.

198
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,541
[AYANO]
I can't lose.

199
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,875
The score is 20, match point 19!

200
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,625
You can do it!

201
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,583
[AYANO]
I'm going to lose.

202
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,625
Just one more point.

203
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:23,250
If I miss this, it's over!

204
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,458
We're gonna win this together,
all right, Ayano?

205

Game two, 21-19.

208
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,125
Match won
by the Fredericia Girls,

209

Christiansen and Tagajo.

210

[TAGAJO]
You bet we did!

211
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:27,166
[TAGAJO] Gotta cramp, huh?
You need a stretch?

212

[CONNIE grunting painfully]

213
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,333
[TAGAJO]
I can't win.

214
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:44,666
[HAYAMA] What a bummer!
You almost had them too!

215
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,166
[YU]
You were so close, Aya!

216
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,791
[AYANO]
No. I didn't really lose.

217
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:01,041
[AYANO] I would've beaten her
if my string hadn't broken.

218
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,625
[RIKO]
Ayano?

219
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,375
[AYANO] I mean, they were trying
to confuse us the whole time.

220
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,333
That one girl playing us
the entire game.

221
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,041
Then the other jumping in
at the last minute.

222
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,708
It was totally unexpected!

223
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:13,791
It wasn't fair,
so I didn't really lose!

224
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:16,750
Don't make excuses. They won.

[TACHIBANA]
Hanesaki! Where is she--

227
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,416
[YU]
Aya! Wait!

228
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,333
[TACHIBANA]
Hanesaki, where are you?

229
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:35,041
I wonder
if they've had more luck.

230
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,250
I'll check.

231
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:43,416
Same here. We haven't found
any sign of her yet.

232
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,125
[YU]
How you doing, Aya?

233
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,125
Why don't we head back
to the gym?

234
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:57,083
Everyone's looking for you.

235
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,291
[SORA]
I need to say this.

236
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:06,500
I hated you, Ayano.

237
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,000
Huh? Why would you say that?

238
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,708
[SORA] You had talent,
so people counted on you,

239
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,958
but you acted
like you couldn't care less.

240
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:16,458
And when you stopped showing up,
the club went looking for you.

241
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,916
[SORA]
But in that last match,

242
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,166
I couldn't help but think
how cool you were.

243
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:31,250
From now on, no excuses
for being awesome, okay?

244
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:42,000
We should head back. You coming?

245
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,000
[CONNIE]
What's that? A pity gift?

246
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:04,291
Uh-huh, but I was kinda worried.

247
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,791
[CONNIE]
I just want to be left alone.

248
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:15,208
Didn't you hear what I said?
[crying]

249
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,666
[CONNIE]
That girl today,

250
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,916
the way I treated her,
I think I went too far.

251
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,125
Who do you mean?

252
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,166
[CONNIE]
Hina. [gasping]

253
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,791
And you wanna make it up to me?
I know just the thing!

254
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:37,791
Help! Somebody call the embassy!

255
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,166
[TAGAJO]
Commence cleaning!

256
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,166
[CONNIE] Gimme my clothes back!
I want out!

257
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,166
I prefer to take my baths alone!

258
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,416
But you said you'd do anything
to make it up to me.

259
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,625
Pretty sure you made that up
in your head!

260
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,791
Let's not sweat
over the details, okay?

261
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,875
Besides, it's time
for your massage!

262
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,333
Should I start here?

Oh!

265

There, there. It's only a bath.
You're being such a baby.

266
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,416
I am not! [crying]

267
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,750
[TAGAJO] No fair, captain!
I wanna wash her hair!

268
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,875

Hurry up and get this over with!

269
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:11,625
[SHIWAHIME]
I would if you'd hold still.

270
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,291
You know,
Connie always struck me

271
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,666
as the unapproachable
prodigy type.

272
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:20,250
Ditto, but she's kinda cute
or whatever.

273
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:21,875
[SHIWAHIME]
Almost done.

282
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:47,958
You're a regular card shark.

Huh? [chuckling]

286
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,875
Look, Elena,
you want to team up with me?

287
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:01,916
-Huh?
-Good.

288
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,208
She says she can't wait to play!

289
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,708
Do you have your phone
in camera mode right now?

290
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,125
Let's take a group photo!

291
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,166
Yu! Wait till
I take off my mask!

00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,208

What gives?

296
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,583
The minute we take our eyes
off you, you go missing!

297
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,791
[CONNIE]
I can't brush my teeth in peace?

298
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,708
If you'd told us,
we'd have gone with you!

299
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:53,708
Which is exactly
why I didn't say anything.

300
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:56,125
[TAGAJO] Brushing as a team
would've inspired you.

[door closing]

302
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Bye, Nagisa.
Kitakomachi has a unique team.

303
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,250
Make it to the Inter-High,

304
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,666
so we can compete
with each other again.

305
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,708
Thanks for saying so,
but that was always the plan.

306
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:11,958
[SHIWAHIME]
See ya.

307
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:20,625
Before we go, I need to ask you.
How do you know my mom?

308
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:26,375
You must be confused.
Uchika's my mother.

309
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:27,666
[AYANO]
What do you mean?

310
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,916
She saved me.

311
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,500
Before Mama entered my life,
I was alone.

312
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:35,708
[AYANO] "Mama"?
Why're you calling her that?

313
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,958
[CONNIE] Because
she taught me how to live.

314
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,708
[AYANO]
You're not making sense!

315
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,166
Is that...

316
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,833
I looked pretty cute
with short hair, didn't I?

317
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,625
You're the girl.

318
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:07,708
Mama's coming to Japan soon.
Surprised?

319
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:12,750
[CONNIE]
She's my family,

320
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,291
the most important person
in my life.

321
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,416
I bet it's the same for you.

322
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,958
It doesn't matter
if you belong to a team.

323
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,208
If she doesn't acknowledge you,

324
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:26,500
there's no point
in playing badminton, is there?

325
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,625
[UCHIKA] Okay, that's
enough practice for today!

326
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,583
Please! One more!

327
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,375
And if I miss,
then I promise we'll stop!

328
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:41,333
No, Ayano,
you said that last time.

329
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,333
Practice is over with for today.

330
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,125
We'll try tomorrow.

331
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,083
That's no fair!
We gotta keep going!

332
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,291
Say it didn't count, please!

333
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,500
If you get good enough one day,

334
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,291
I'll play with you
any time you want.

335
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:00,250
[YOUNG AYANO]
Don't leave! Wait for me!

336
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:06,041
I'm going to beat you one-on-one

337
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:09,208
and prove to Mama
I'm worthy of her love.

338
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,208
We'll meet again soon.

339
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:33,916
Hey, so, um, did you get to talk
to that Connie girl

340
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,291
about your mom?

341
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,416
[AYANO]
What does it matter?

342
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,583
I don't need a mom.
