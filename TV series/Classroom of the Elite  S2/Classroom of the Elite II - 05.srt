...she's a traitor?

4
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,990
Just think: there's no way
anyone could've figured out

00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,330
your group's VIP

00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:38,040
with how careful you were.

7
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,210
I seriously doubt you or Hirata
would let that information slip.

00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:43,880
Of course not.

[AYANOKOJI]
The only other answer

10
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:49,340
is that Kushida
revealed it herself.

11
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,970
But why would she do that?

12
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,340
She has no reason
to betray the group.

13
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,890
We can't say that for sure.

14
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,930
It's possible that another
class paid her off

15
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,480
with private points.

16
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,810
Wait, seriously?

17
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,600
You think she'd just
sell out Class D like that?

18
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,400
[AYANOKOJI] All I'm saying is
it's a possibility.

19
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,320
The only one who knows
the real reason is her.

20
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,200
And that's why you invited
her to come along?

21
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,490
To find out her real motive?

22
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,250
You and Kushida appear
to have some sort of history.

23
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,290
Not really.

24
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,210
Any class that allows
a traitor in their midst

25
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:25,790
is doomed to fail.

26

27
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,260
[AYANOKOJI] If you want to
lead the class to victory,

28
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,180

To be clear, I don't care

something so mean to me?

00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,780
I just wanted to know,
during the special exam,

51
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,360
someone told Ryuen
our VIP's identity.

00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,280
Was it you?

00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,610
What's that?

54
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,950
[AYANOKOJI] I knew that she
wasn't gonna sugar coat it,

55
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,660
but I didn't expect
her to be so upfront.

56
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,790
You don't have to confess.
I'm not looking for that.

But it wasn't me.

All the same,
as a member of Class D,

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,800
I need some kind of assurance
that you can be trusted.

60
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,680
I still don't get why you
think it's me betraying you.

00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,100
All I want is for everyone
to make it to Class A together!

I promise, it wasn't me!

[STUDENT 5AD]
Is she okay?

161
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,410
No, Horikita!

162
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,840
I'll go back to the tent
for a first aid kit!

163
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,710
Right, and I'll find a teacher!

00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,510
[AYANOKOJI]
Does it hurt?

165
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,890
If you're wondering if
I can still compete today,

166
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,390

[SUZUNE] Don't touch me!
What's wrong with you--

168
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,730
You shouldn't be walking
on this, let alone running.

169
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,570
We've got way bigger
things to worry about

170
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,110
than a bruised ankle.

171
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,610
That Class C girl
you collided with?

172
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,820
I've got a strong feeling
that she did it on purpose.

173
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,330
But still, focus on yourself.

174
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,750
I can take care of
my problems just fine.

175
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:45,380
I heard that you had
a talk with Koenji.

176
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,750
Big help that was.
He still flaked.

177
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,760
Maybe if I was
more like Kushida,

178
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,260
I might've been able
to convince him

179
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,260
to help out the class for once.

180
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:58,060
Well, that's surprising.
Never thought you'd say

181
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,770
you wish you were
more like Kushida.

182
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,480
I don't wanna hear it.

183

It's not like I always
hated her, you know.

184
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,530
Just don't tell
anyone what I said.

185
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,280
If you say so.

186
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,070
Try not to push
yourself too hard.

187
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:16,320
[SUZUNE] I'm fine.
Don't worry about me.

[STUDENT chattering]

189
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,800
It looks like all the Class C
girls are targeting Horikita!

00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,670
Aw, man! This is Ryuen's doing!

I got it!

Ken! Your event's up next!

Got it!

Are you okay? Your leg.

196

I'll be fine, thanks.
What do you want?

197
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,120
Oh. That's good.

198
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,200
I just wanted to say that you
can leave everything to me!

199
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,330
I'll fight hard enough
for the both of us!

200
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,880
I'm very glad to hear that.

201
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,170
[KEN]
Yeah! Come on, you guys!

202
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:13,470
We'll knock that jerkass
Ryuen's head right off!

203
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,010
[AYANOKOJI]
It started well.

204
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,720
Our strategy was
to work in tandem

205
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,510
with the Class A students.

206
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,680
[groaning]

207
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:28,610
[AYANOKOJI] But Sudo let
Ryuen get under his skin

208
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:31,570
--and lost his cool.
--[airhorn blows]

209
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,990
Meaning, we lost the match.

210

I'm gonna teach that
son of a bitch a lesson!

211
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,240
Just try to ignore it.

212
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,700
Yeah, that's real easy
for you to say!

213
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,590
[AYANOKOJI]
Looks like the early lead we had

214
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,510
is completely gone, now.

215
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,590
Hey, Kiyotaka, you think
we can still win?

216
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,800
[AYANOKOJI]
Maybe.

217
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,890
Wait. Did you just
use my given name?

218
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:06,100
Well, I've been calling Hirata,
"Yosuke" for a little while now.

219
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,520
So, I thought I'd give it a try.

220
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,520
Oh, yeah. Horikita's
in bad shape, huh?

221
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:16,650
It's because Class C
is targeting her.

222
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,490
Is that the reason she
keeps getting matched up

223
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:22,280
against tough opponents?
It's not just a coincidence?

224
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:25,620
That's right, and
it's not just her.

225
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,790
From what it looks like,

226
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,160
our class's event
selections were leaked.

227
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,790
Seriously?

228
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,380
Yeah. There's a traitor
in our class

229
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,170
and they gave the list to him.

230
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,050
It seems that Ryuen
has two goals in mind.

231
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,760
The first is to put
their weakest students

232
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,810
up against our
powerhouses, like Sudo.

233
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,060
Then strategically assign
the rest of their class

234
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:52,230
to beat ours, accumulating
more points overall.

235
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:56,320
His second goal is to completely
crush Horikita's spirit.

236
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,900
No way.

237
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:02,030
With how far our class has
fallen behind at this point,

238
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,950
do we still even
have a chance to win?

239
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,540
[AYANOKOJI]
Win?

240
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,460
I've never had any
intention of winning.

241
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,830
Huh?

242
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,630
[AYANOKOJI] Our best course
of action in this moment

243
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,210
is to let this play out.

244
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,300
It's part of my plan.

The worse we lose
in the sports festival,

the better our position
will be later.

That smug bastard Ryuen

249

away with cheating.

gonna lose it all!

Shut the hell up! Out of my way!

as far as this is concerned!

Yeah, I know, but look
at how you're acting!

who lashes out like that?

If you ask me, this is
the perfect chance

315
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,320
for you to acquire a weapon.

316
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,320
Weapon?

317
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,900
Moving forward,

318
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:29,530
you'll find there are limits to
what you can accomplish alone.

319
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:32,950
Even now, you're nearly
helpless by yourself.

320
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,580
That's not--

321
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,710
You need something that you
can use in these situations.

322
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,750
Ken Sudo can be that weapon.

323
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,040
In the right hands,
he'd find his worth.

324
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:45,750
Use him, in the same
way I use you.

325
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,300
[gasps]

326
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,470
[AYANOKOJI] Tell me, what else
do you think you'd be doing?

327
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,260
Praying that your
ankle somehow recovers?

328
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,720
Good luck with that.

329
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,730
I'm not sure.

330
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,390
I'll leave you to
think it over yourself.

331
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,610
[KARUIZAWA]
Come on.

332
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,530
How long are you gonna
keep it a secret?

333
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:16,870
Can't you just tell us
who the traitor is?

334
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,750
Sorry, now's not the time.

335
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:21,750
Huh? But why is that?

336
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:24,710
Wait. If you knew
there would be a traitor,

337
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:28,550
we could've stopped them from
leaking out our class's list.

338
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,050
That's true.

339
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:33,050
But that's something you'd
have to ask Horikita about.

340
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,970
[KARUIZAWA gasps]
Where is Horikita right now?

341
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:39,020
I haven't seen her
in a little while.

342
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,520
She's busy, taking care of
something only she can do.

343
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:51,150
[KIKYO]
There you are! Hey, Horikita!

344
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,910
Oh, it's you.
Is something wrong?

345
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,410
Yeah! It's bad!

346
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:59,410
You know, Kinoshita,
the girl you ran into before?

347
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,540
They had to take her
to the nurse!

348
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,660
[gasps]

349
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,540
And now, they said they want you

350
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:08,340
to come to the
nurse's office, too!

351
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,880
All right, I'll go.

352
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,640
[gasps]

353
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,180
Hey there, Suzune.

354
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,520
[SUZUNE]
Wait. What are you doing here?

355
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,020
Poor Kinoshita was just
telling me what you did to her.

356
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:30,650
I can hardly believe that
you would stoop so low.

357
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,530
What are you trying to say?

358
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:34,910
Don't play dumb.

359
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,660
Kinoshita said that you
knocked her over on purpose!

360
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,910
That's just absurd!
Why would I do that?

361
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,080
When I fell,

362
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,420
you looked over at me
and then said,

363
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,170
"As if I'd ever let you
take first place."

364
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,800
[gasps] That isn't true!

365
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,130
You know I never said
anything like that!

366
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:52,550
[RYUEN]
Oh, come on.

367
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:55,430
Is this the kind of injury
that happens by accident?

368
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,470
It's shocking.

369
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,680
How cold-blooded does someone
have to be to do that?

370
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:04,440
[MINORI grunts]

371
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,100
I've had enough of this!

372
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:08,190
You're just trying to set me up!

373
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,030
And now it seems
you're trying to blame me

374
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,480
to cover up your own wrongdoing.

375
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:15,200
How sad can you get?

376
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,030
[SUZUNE] It's nearly
impossible for me to prove

377
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,160
that I didn't
intend to hurt her.

378
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,080
In other words,
it's The Devil's Proof.

379
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,080
I think it'll be best if
Kinoshita reports this incident

380
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,830
to the school, don't you?

381
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,420
The school?

382
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,670
You could try to
prove your innocence

383
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,970
and bring it up to
the Student Council.

384
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,800
Don't bother.

385
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:41,970
[SUZUNE] No matter what, I can't
make trouble for my brother.

386
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,770
Wait! Please, Ryuen!

387
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,100
I know Horikita, and she
isn't the kind of person

388
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:48,480
who'd try to injure
someone on purpose.

389
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,770
Kushida.

390
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,030
There's no way she
meant to hurt Kinoshita!

391
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:54,780
So, couldn't she just
say that she's sorry?

392
00:19:54,860 --> 00:20:00,530
You know that could work.
Depending on how sorry she is.

393
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:04,160
I want a million points.
How's that sound?

394
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,660
All you have to do is pay up,
and this goes away.

395
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:11,170
It's only fair that Kinoshita
gets compensated for her injury.

396
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,420
Don't be ridiculous.
Is this what you were after?

397
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:16,670
Why you orchestrated
this whole thing?

398
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,130
Too bad. It looks like
we're gonna have to

399
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,640
bother the student
council, after all.

400
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,720
Hold on!

401
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,940
If I give you 1,000,000 points,

402
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,820
do you promise that you'll
never bring this up again?

403
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,150
Yeah. But, I'm afraid
you're too late.

404
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,950
That offer was only available
for a limited time.

405

[SUZUNE]
What?

[RYUEN] You really shouldn't
have turned it down.

[RYUEN]
Let me think.

408
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,420
Now, on top of the points.

409
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,840
I want you to grovel.

410
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,250
You're truly a
disgusting person.

411
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:58,760
Well, I'm not gonna force you
to make a decision right now.

412
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,390
Why don't I give you till
the end of the festival?

413
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,400
[SUZUNE]
I should've seen it coming.

414
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:18,400
I was careless and fell
right into his trap.

415
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:20,780
Right, I'll check
on that now, sir.

416
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,170
[gasps]

417
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,090
[SUZUNE]
I'm keenly aware that Class D

418
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,800
isn't pulling their weight.

419
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,840
And the effect that's having
on the entire team's score.

420
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:45,930
I know that the fault
lies in my leadership.

421
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:49,350
But I promise
I'll turn it around.

422
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:52,770
No matter what, I won't
bring you down with me.

423
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:01,320
I couldn't sense a shred
of sympathy from him,

424
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,780
but he stopped
and listened to me.

425
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,870
I'll have to be
satisfied with that.

426
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,170
[SUZUNE]
All right, then.

427
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,710
For Class D to have any
chance of coming back,

428
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,090
there's one more thing
I need to take care of.
