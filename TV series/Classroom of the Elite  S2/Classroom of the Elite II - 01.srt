That man who called me.

Who, I am sure you've figured
out by now, is your father,

Is the book good?

00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,041
It's not a romance novel, is it?

Of course not.

The second special examination

What's got her so upset?

00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:45,166
[MASHIMA]
Now that everyone's here,

72
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,417
I'll explain the rules
of this special exam.

73
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,750
All first-year students
will be split

74
00:05:50,834 --> 00:05:52,417
into eight different groups,

75
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,041
each named after a planet
in the solar system.

76
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,333
You all will be part of "Mars."

77
00:05:57,417 --> 00:05:59,792
Look here. Every group
will include students

78
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,917
from each of the classes.

79
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,166
[AYANOKOJI] There're 14
people in each group.

80
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,208
[KARUIZAWA]
We have to work with Class C?

81
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:09,458
Plus, three from
Class A and Class B!

82
00:06:09,542 --> 00:06:11,834
But aren't we supposed
to be competing with them?

83
00:06:11,917 --> 00:06:15,667
[AYANOKOJI] For this test, we're
no longer students of Class D,

84
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,959
and instead, we'll be acting
as members of the "Mars" group.

85
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:22,750
Our test results will go towards
the group's overall score.

86
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:24,875
The exam will last four days,

87
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:27,709
with day three set aside
for everyone to rest.

88
00:06:27,792 --> 00:06:30,625
At 8AM, the school will send out
an email to one member

89
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:34,417
of each group,
who will then be "the VIP"

90
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,667
Two times a day,
the group will meet up

91
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,917
and have a discussion and try
to find out the VIP's identity.

92
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,959
Thirty minutes after
the sixth discussion ends,

93
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,500
everyone will mail their
answer to the school.

94
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:49,458
Each person can only
submit one guess.

95
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,041
For obvious reasons,

96
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:54,041
the VIP isn't allowed
to send in an answer.

97
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,500
Let's see. It says here...

98
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,041
There are four scenarios.

99
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:01,000
"In case one, if everyone in
the group, aside from the VIP

100
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:04,166
and their classmates, correctly
guesses the VIP's identity.

101
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,000
Then all members of the
group will be awarded

102
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,166
500,000 private points.

103
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,667
And The VIP will receive
an extra 500,000 points."

104
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,583
Whoa! That's crazy!

105
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:16,959
So, the VIP gets
1,000,000 points?

106
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,542
"In case two,

107
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:21,166
one or more people, aside from
the VIP and their classmates,

108
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,542
fails to submit an answer in
time, or guesses incorrectly.

109
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:27,250
If this happens, then only
the VIP will be awarded

110
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,959
500,000 private points."

111
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,542
[AYANOKOJI]
So that's how it is.

112
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,333
Case two represents the scenario

113
00:07:33,417 --> 00:07:35,625
where the VIP keeps
their identity hidden.

114
00:07:35,709 --> 00:07:38,333
And if they succeed, they'll be
the only person in the group

115
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:40,333
to get points.

116
00:07:40,417 --> 00:07:41,917
[MASHIMA] Just so you know,
you don't have to wait

117
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,208
until the end.

118
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:46,125
You can attempt to expose
the VIP at any time.

119
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:50,000
Of course, that scenario is
covered by cases three and four.

120
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,458
Everything he said is true,
according to this.

121
00:07:52,542 --> 00:07:56,166
"Answers will be accepted at any
time during the testing period.

122
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,208
Regardless if answers
are submitted early

123
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,959
or at the end of the last day.

124
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:03,834
Any incorrect answers
will result in a penalty.

125
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:06,750
In case three, someone,
other than the VIP,

126
00:08:06,834 --> 00:08:09,208
emails the school before
the end of the last day,

127
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:11,750
and correctly guesses
the VIP's identity.

128
00:08:11,834 --> 00:08:13,834
In that case, that
person's class will have

129
00:08:13,917 --> 00:08:16,291
50 class points
added to their total.

130
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:20,417
Also, that student will be
awarded 500,000 private points,

131
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,834
and the testing for that group
will immediately end.

132
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:26,333
However, correct answers
from students in the VIP's

133
00:08:26,417 --> 00:08:28,500
own class will be
declared invalid

134
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,542
and the exam will continue.

135
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,041
And case four:

136
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,417
someone, other than the VIP,
emails the school

137
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,125
before the end of the last day,
but incorrectly guesses

138
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,750
the identity of the VIP.

139
00:08:38,834 --> 00:08:41,291
If that happens, then that
person's class will have

140
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:44,083
50 class points deducted
from their total.

141
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:48,333
Additionally, the VIP will be
awarded 500,000 private points.

142
00:08:48,417 --> 00:08:50,959
Furthermore, their class
will have 50 class points

143
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,792
added to their total."

144
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:55,291
[AYANOKOJI] And the moment the
incorrect answer is received,

145
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:59,000
the testing for that
group will conclude.

146
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,583
Oh. It says here if
the wrong answer comes

147
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:03,333
from someone
in the VIP's class,

148
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:06,125
their answer is invalid
and won't be accepted.

149
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,875
[YUKIMURA]
I see, this won't be easy.

150
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:15,500
Honestly, I still don't really
understand what's going on.

151
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:19,250
I'm in the same boat. This test
is surprisingly complicated.

152
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,125
I'll explain it
to you both later.

153
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,250
Don't bother the
teacher over it.

154
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,834
Last thing. The
school is committed

155
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:27,125
to protecting our
students' anonymity.

156
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,041
After the special exam is over,

157
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,667
We'll take steps to make sure
that only your group's

158
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,792
final result and class-wide
point changes are announced.

159
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,208
What about the VIP's identity?

160
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,583
[MASHIMA]
That will remain secret

161
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:40,458
along with everyone's answers.

162
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,208
--[GIRL 201A] This is so weird!
--[GIRL 201B] Right?

163
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,500
[AYANOKOJI] It seems there are
four ways this can play out.

164
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:47,917
What a pain.

165
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,750
The VIP is identified.

166
00:09:49,834 --> 00:09:53,291
Then the whole group answers
correctly and wins.

167
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,083
If, on the last day
of the test,

168
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,959
at least one person
guesses wrong,

169
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,291
only the VIP is victorious.

170
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,500
Someone betrays the group
and wins points

171
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,709
for their class instead.

172
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:05,500
[AYANOKOJI]
And the final possibility:

173
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,208
someone betrays the group,

174
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,458
but their guess
turns out to be wrong.

175
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,625
They're evaluating
our "thinking."

176
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:12,667
Which students will be able

177
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,875
to accurately analyze
the situation,

178
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,667
and if they can effectively
manage their group's actions.

179
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,959
In short, they're testing
our problem-solving ability.

180
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,250
This special exam is
all about anticipating

181
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:26,250
how others will act and
manipulating their actions

182
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,208
to your benefit.

183
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,834
How annoying.

184
00:10:36,917 --> 00:10:38,333
It's almost time.

185
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:39,375
Yeah.

186
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,125
I got the same message.

187
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:49,959
That's a shame. Neither of us
were selected as VIPs.

188
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,959
Agreed. This limits our options.

189
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,834
What do you think
of this whole thing?

190
00:10:54,917 --> 00:10:56,583
The special test, I mean.

191
00:10:56,667 --> 00:10:59,375
It depends on how
the VIP approaches it.

192
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:03,750
That said, I've come up with
a few ideas for how we can win.

193
00:11:03,834 --> 00:11:05,291
Of course you have.

194
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,750
Seems I can leave
the Mars group to you.

195
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,291
Sure.

196
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:12,083
I am curious to see how you
handle things with your group.

197
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,375
Do you need my help?

198
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,625
No thanks. I'm fine.

199
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:17,625
Anyway, I wanted to ask you.

200
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:19,333
Is there anyone you're wary of
in the other classes--?

201
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:21,291
[RYUEN]
Oh, what a coincidence!

202
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:24,625
You don't mind
if I join you, right?

203
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:27,875
Suzune, you're not
the VIP, are you?

204
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:29,959
I wouldn't tell you
even if I was.

205
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:33,417
Really. Who would freely give
away that kind of information?

206
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,792
[RYUEN]
I would, if you just asked.

207
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,000
But I couldn't care
less about that.

208
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,500
What I want to know
is how you managed

209
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,792
to pull off that stunt
on the island.

210
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,792
Based on Ibuki's daily reports,

211
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,917
you did absolutely nothing,
from beginning to end.

212
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,542
It's laughable how much
you trusted those.

213
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,458
I mean, she struggled to
beat me even when I was sick.

214
00:11:52,542 --> 00:11:53,750
So.

215
00:11:53,834 --> 00:11:56,917
Then how about a rematch,
right here and now?

216
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,375
If I'm being honest,

217
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,792
the way you guys won
wasn't all that special,

218
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,542
once you understand it.

219
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:05,166
That said, few people could've
come up with that plan

220
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,792
and actually pulled it off
under those conditions.

221
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,500
It's certainly not something
a strait-laced little girl

222
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,125
like you could've cooked up.

223
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,458
Suzune.

224
00:12:13,542 --> 00:12:16,125
Sorry to burst your bubble,
but it was my idea.

225
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:17,709
You see, the truth is,

226
00:12:17,792 --> 00:12:20,083
Anyanokoji, over there
is the closest thing I have

227
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,959
to a friend.
Though he's so useless,

228
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,709
I wouldn't rely
on him for anything.

229
00:12:23,792 --> 00:12:26,625
The kind of bottom feeder
I'd expect from Class D.

230
00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:28,208
[camera shutter clicks]

231
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,458
Delete that picture!

232
00:12:29,542 --> 00:12:31,083
This'll be a fun game.

233
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:34,291
I can't wait to find out
who's pulling your strings.

234
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:37,458
They can't hide in the shadows
forever--I'll drag 'em out.

235
00:12:37,542 --> 00:12:40,709
Why are you so obsessed with
the students from Class D?

236
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:42,458
You're just a bunch of new toys.

237
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:44,667
I know what the
other classes can do.

238
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,542
They aren't a threat to me.

239
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:51,583
[AYANOKOJI] You've suddenly
become the woman of the hour

240
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:54,750
Oh, spare me.
All this is your fault.

241
00:12:54,834 --> 00:12:57,125
[AYANOKOJI] I see.
The more they pressure her,

242
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,583
the more she wants
to fight back.

243
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:02,500
Seems there's nothing for me
to worry about, then.

244
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,000
What now?

245
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,375
It's nothing.

246
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:17,250
[sighs] What did I do
to get lumped into a group

247
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,000
with these losers?

248
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,083
Uh--

249
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,792
[ICHINOSE]
All right, let's get started!

250
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,834
Let's go around
and introduce ourselves!

251
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:37,875
After all, the instructions
specifically mentioned it!

252
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:40,917
I don't see the point in wasting
our time with introductions.

253
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,417
We're not here to make
friends with each other.

254
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,375
Well, yeah, I guess I can't
force you to participate.

255
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,542
Although, it's entirely possible

256
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,792
that the school put
a bug in this room!

257
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,166
That's a good point.

258
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,500
And you know how the school
is about their rules.

259
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,792
If you don't play along,
you could get punished.

260
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,041
[MACHIDA sighs]
Let's get this over with.

261
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,500
Thanks so much!

262
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,750
[AYANOKOJI] Ichinose's
seized the initiative.

263
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:05,333
Interesting.

264
00:14:05,417 --> 00:14:08,000
[ICHINOSE] I'd like to nominate
myself as the group's moderator!

265
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,625
If anyone has any objections
to that, please let me know!

266
00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:12,083
I won't mind!

267
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:13,959
[AYANOKOJI]
So that's how she's playing it.

268
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,291
If anyone here objected,

269
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,792
they'd basically be
volunteering themselves.

270
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,083
The moderator gets
to lead the discussion.

271
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,709
But they risk
revealing too much.

272
00:14:22,792 --> 00:14:24,667
It's safer to let her lead.

273
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,667
Well, since I don't
see any objections,

274
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,375
I guess I'll accept
the position!

275
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,875
To start with, let's all
get on the same page.

276
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,333
Are we all clear
on the rules of the exam?

277
00:14:33,417 --> 00:14:35,208
Does anyone have any questions?

278
00:14:37,917 --> 00:14:41,041
Great! Then, I have a proposal!

279
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:45,250
If it's possible, I'd like
for all of us to work together!

280
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:46,417
In other words,

281
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,625
I say we should try
to aim for case one!

282
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:50,917
That way we can all win points!

283
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,583
What do you guys think?

284
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:54,834
Obviously yes,
it's a no-brainer!

285
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:56,959
Naturally, we're in agreement.

286
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,208
I'm on board.

287
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:00,583
This is a good chance
to earn more points.

288
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:02,834
And it'll be easier
to cooperate.

289
00:15:02,917 --> 00:15:04,041
Right you are!

290
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,834
We'll overcome this
challenge, post haste!

291
00:15:05,917 --> 00:15:07,500
Jeez, could you
get any weirder?

292
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:10,917
[MACHIDA] Sorry. Unfortunately,
Class A has decided

293
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,291
not to participate
in any discussions.

294
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,542
Wait. They're saying no?

295
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,250
But why?

296
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:24,000
Would you mind explaining
why you won't join in?

297
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,875
Don't worry,
it's nothing personal.

298
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:27,333
I promise you.

299
00:15:27,417 --> 00:15:29,417
It's just that the safest
and most certain way to win

300
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,667
is for Class A to abstain
from any discussions

301
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,500
during the special exam.

302
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,625
[AYANOKOJI]
Katsuragi's idea, I'm sure.

303
00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:38,166
But with that strategy,
you're basically making sure

304
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,875
only the VIP walks
away with points.

305
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,625
Tell me, what is the worst
possible result from this test?

306
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,917
[gasps] Uh, let's see.

307
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,875
I guess, if someone figured
out the VIP's identity

308
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,667
and then betrayed the group?

309
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,041
Close, but not quite.

310
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,625
The worst-case scenario
in this test is if someone

311
00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:56,417
tries to betray the group
and guess early

312
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,792
but submits an incorrect answer
and loses class points.

313
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,542
In order to avoid that,
you're withholding information

314
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:04,709
to ensure that case two occurs.

315
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:07,917
That conservative strategy might
seem like it's the safest route.

316
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,291
But ignoring the VIPs

317
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,667
could create a point disparity
between the classes!

318
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,125
We can't be sure
how they decided

319
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:15,041
who the VIPs were going to be.

320
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,542
And what if, through
a stroke of luck,

321
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:19,250
most of the VIPs
were from one class?

322
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,333
[AYANOKOJI]
Hamaguchi's got a good point.

323
00:16:21,417 --> 00:16:24,542
Without knowing the class
distribution of the VIPs.

324
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:27,709
Class A's strategy would be
too dependent on luck.

325
00:16:27,792 --> 00:16:31,750
But he's forgotten
something very important.

326
00:16:31,834 --> 00:16:33,709
The school's policy.

327
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:35,917
"Fairness for all classes."

328
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,375
As you know, our school
goes to extreme lengths

329
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,959
to adhere to that doctrine,
even in these tests.

330
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,959
Because of that,
I'm confident that there is

331
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:46,208
an even distribution of VIPs
all across the classes.

332
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,333
I see, makes sense.

333
00:16:48,417 --> 00:16:49,583
[ICHINOSE] I have to admit,
you're making some

334
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:51,417
very compelling arguments.

335
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,250
Although, executing your
strategy won't be easy.

336
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,834
You're betting that no one
from Class A gets greedy

337
00:16:56,917 --> 00:16:58,834
or lets any info slip out.

338
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:02,333
Not gonna happen!
We completely trust each other.

339
00:17:02,417 --> 00:17:04,834
Sounds to me like
it'll be less of a hassle.

340
00:17:04,917 --> 00:17:07,083
Well, what do
you think, Yukimura?

341
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,917
Perhaps it would be better
to go along with them.

342
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:14,542
Doing nothing would be easier.

343
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,792
However, I can't help
but feel this strategy

344
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:20,125
gives Class A an advantage
over other classes.

345
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,500
Sorry, I'm not following
what you're saying.

346
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,250
By forcing a case two result,
you're making students

347
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,625
from other classes lose
a chance to catch up!

348
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:29,041
Well, that's, uh...

349
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,250
The major downside
with your strategy

350
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,750
is that no one
can earn class points

351
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:34,250
to raise their class ranking.

352
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,000
If you wanna talk
about class points,

353
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,125
your plan doesn't help
the lower classes either!

354
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,625
You're wrong! It does help!

355
00:17:40,709 --> 00:17:44,542
You see, the Mars group has four
members from Classes C and D!

356
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,750
But only three
from Classes A and B!

357
00:17:46,834 --> 00:17:49,291
In other words, if we can
get the case one result,

358
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:52,583
Classes D and C, on the whole,
will each be awarded an extra

359
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:54,667
500,000 private points!

360
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,917
That may be true. But hold on.
Going with your idea

361
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,417
would also be disadvantageous
for your class!

362
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,667
A small price to pay.

363
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,458
This works out better
for us than letting you

364
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:05,291
do whatever you want.

365
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,458
After all, if the VIP
was from your class,

366
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:09,041
then only you would win!

367
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,792
I'm inclined to agree.

368
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,667
[AYANOKOJI]
That was well done.

369
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,792
Class B must've guessed what
Class A was aiming for.

370
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,125
Doesn't matter.

371
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,542
Class A's strategy
remains unchanged.

372
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:28,041
We won't participate
in the discussion.

373
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:33,667
Oh, my. What are we
gonna do with them?

374
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,542
[AYANOKOJI] Both Machida and
Ichinose have good points.

375
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,458
It's hard to argue with them.

376
00:18:39,542 --> 00:18:43,333
And I'm sure each class
has their own schemes.

377
00:18:43,417 --> 00:18:47,166
[MANABE]
Yo, Karuizawa, got a second?

378
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,208
Hey! Don't ignore me,
I'm talking to you!

379
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:51,333
Whadaya want?

380
00:18:51,417 --> 00:18:53,333
Did you get into
a fight with Rika?

381
00:18:53,417 --> 00:18:54,875
Before summer break.

382
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:56,959
Huh? Rika who?

383
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,583
What are you talking about?

384
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:00,583
She's a girl in our class
who wears glasses

385
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:02,166
and puts her hair in buns.

386
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,667
Now do you remember her?

387
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,959
Out with it!

388
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:08,333
Can't say that I do.
You've got the wrong girl.

389
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:10,917
Nice try, but Rika
told us what happened!

390
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,500
She said that
a girl with a ponytail

391
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,333
from Class D bullied her!

392
00:19:14,417 --> 00:19:16,750
She was just minding her
own business, then somebody

393
00:19:16,834 --> 00:19:19,458
cut in front of her
and shoved her aside!

394
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:23,125
[KARUIZAWA] Too bad for her,
but that wasn't me.

395
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,709
Don't give us that crap!

396
00:19:24,792 --> 00:19:27,750
You should own up to what you
did and apologize to her!

397
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,959
Let's just get a picture of her
and check with Rika.

398
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,417
Don't you dare take my picture!

399
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:35,041
What's wrong with you?

400
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:37,291
Are you crazy? You could've
broken her phone!

401
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,917
Well, you can always just
get a new one from the school.

402
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,166
And what about my pictures
and personal stuff, huh?

403
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,917
Who cares? What do you want?

404
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,166
If you're really innocent,
then why are you being so pissy?

405
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,625
Let us take a pic!

406
00:19:49,709 --> 00:19:50,917
[KARUIZAWA]
I told you, no!

407
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,959
[MANABE]
What's your problem?

408
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,000
[YAMASHITA]
Would you look at that?

409
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,041
She's all shy, now!

410
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,333
[MANABE]
You're kidding me.

411
00:19:55,417 --> 00:19:56,917
[YABU] Stop freaking out.
It's just a picture!

412
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Leave me alone!

413
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,583
[MACHIDA] Hey. You girls
are causing a scene!

414
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:02,875
[KARUIZAWA]
Machida!

415
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,834
Stop picking on her.
She's nearly in tears.

416
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,458
This is none of your business,
so buzz off, Machida!

417
00:20:12,542 --> 00:20:14,083
Do I need to call a teacher?

418
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:16,959
Fine, whatever.
Come on, let's go.

419
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,291
[YAMASHITA]
Oh, right!

420
00:20:20,542 --> 00:20:22,959
Hey. Do you think that
she was telling the truth?

421
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:26,208
If we had a picture,
we could show Rika.

422
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,542
[KARUIZAWA]
Thanks for saving me, Machida.

423
00:20:44,542 --> 00:20:47,125
If we want to avoid
playing into Class A's hands,

424
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,000
we need to have
open group discussions.

425
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,667
[KARUIZAWA] But even then,
it's not like the VIP

426
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,500
is gonna reveal themselves.

427
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,834
It's no use.
This test is too hard.

428
00:20:54,917 --> 00:20:57,125
I'd say that depends
on our approach.

429
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,542
This is kind of like the last
test, while it may seem

430
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,375
difficult at first, I just know
we'll find a way to overcome it!

431
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:03,834
Worry not, Karuizawa, for I--

432
00:21:03,917 --> 00:21:05,417
I just love being
on this cruise!

433
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,875
Isn't it so fun?

434
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:08,709
Even if we have to sit
through these meetings,

435
00:21:08,792 --> 00:21:10,000
we can still chat!

436
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,959
And we can use our phones
as much as we want!

437
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,583
I guess it's not so bad.

438
00:21:13,667 --> 00:21:15,875
Exactly! We can
talk about anything!

439
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:19,709
It must be boring sitting
in silence the entire time!

440
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:20,917
There's nothing stopping you all

441
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,625
from spending the
whole hour talking.

442
00:21:22,709 --> 00:21:24,458
Just don't expect us
to chime in.

443
00:21:24,542 --> 00:21:27,750
After all, who knows what you
guys from Class B are plotting.

444
00:21:27,834 --> 00:21:28,834
You sure?

445
00:21:28,917 --> 00:21:30,583
Maybe your classmates
wanna join in?

446
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,667
Obviously not.

447
00:22:11,709 --> 00:22:18,792
[whimpering]
