1
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,280
[KIKYO]
This isn't my fault.

2
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,660
Why is everybody so mad at me?

3
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,870
They're the ones with
the problems, not me.

4
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:40,160
All I did was tell
everybody the truth.

5
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,920
They have only themselves
to blame for rejecting me.

6
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,010
[KIKYO]
It was inevitable!

7
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:48,920
[HIRATA]
Okay!

8
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,090
So is everyone on board

9
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,630
with holding study
sessions to prepare?

10
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,930
I need the help for sure!

11
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,350
Yeah!

12
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,890
[HIRATA]
We'll split into groups.

13
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:01,060
Kushida, Horikita, and I will
serve as our class's tutors.

14
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,520
Group one will meet after class,
and group two after club's end.

15
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,070
Each will get two hours.

16
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,980
Let's decide on the groups now.

17
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,230
'Scuse me!

18
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,240
I'd love to help both
groups as much as I can!

19
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,160
Thank you for volunteering!

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,200
We can do this, guys!

21
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,830
[giggles]

22
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,000
[HIRATA]
I'll be overseeing group two.

23
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,380
[SUZUNE]
Then I'll take group one.

24
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,970
[GIRLS chuckling]

25
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,300
[HIRATA]
As for Kushida,

26
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,930
she'll be assisting both groups
whenever she can.

27
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,720
--[phone dings]
--[KIKYO] Uh?

28
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,930
Well, bye!

29
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,190
[MIYAKE]
Hey, can we talk?

30
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:13,650
[HIRATA] Oh, Miyake and
Hasabe? What's up?

31
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,190
We got paired up together,

32
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,280
but the problem is that
both of us struggle

33
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,280
in the same subjects.

34
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,780
I see.

35
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,160
Which means you might not hit
the minimum score to pass.

36
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,580
That's right.

37
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,670
But both the study groups have
too many people already.

38
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,540
Adding you might do
more harm than good.

39
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,710
Agreed.

40
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,130
Things would be
a whole lot easier

41
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,970
if we had another
potential tutor.

42
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:41,350
[YUKIMURA] How about me?
I could look after them.

43
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,970
[HIRATA]
Yukimura? Are you sure?

44
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,020
I want to help our class
get through this exam.

45
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,270
During the sports festival,
I was basically useless.

46
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:51,940
[HIRATA]
That's not true.

47
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,530
It's a miracle that
our whole class

48
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:56,070
managed to pass the last exam.

49
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,910
I doubt we're going to
get that lucky again.

50
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,530
We can't just focus
on our strengths.

51
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,540
At this school, if we want
our class to move up,

52
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,290
all of us have to
be well-rounded.

53
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,000
Yes. That's true.

54
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,880
Smarts. Creativity. Instinct.

55
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,550
This Paper Shuffle will put all
those qualities to the test.

56
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,260
None of us can do
all of it alone.

57
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:23,350
What we need now is for our
class to come together.

58
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,560
That makes sense.

59
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,440
Favor. I want you to help out
Yukimura with his study group.

60
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,270
He's fine on his own.

61
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,860
Just observe and make
sure things run smoothly.

62
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,530
Shouldn't be too hard.

63
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,280
Plus, on the cruise ship test,

64
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,370
seemed like you two
made a pretty good team.

65
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,450
Having you work together
again would be good.

66
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,750
[YUKIMURA]
All right, let's begin.

67
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,170
Our study group's first
official session.

68
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,050
Just us four, huh?

69
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,220
I guess. Should we jump
right into it, then?

70
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,350
Sounds good to me.

71
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,760
Whoa, so you can
talk, Ayanokoji.

72
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,430
Hey! You're being rude!

73
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,770
Am I wrong? I hardly ever
notice when he's in class.

74
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:14,860
He takes being "a fly on the
wall" to a whole 'nother level.

75
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,400
Still, though. Besides,
he did great in the festival.

76
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,490
Yeah, people keep saying that,
but I was in the bathroom,

77
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:24,070
so I didn't get to
see him in action.

78
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,870
You raced the former student
council president, right?

79
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,580
[YUKIMURA]
Since we're on that topic,

80
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,370
no more holding back on us
like you did in the festival.

81
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,500
I asked Horikita about it,

82
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,380
and she says that you're good
when it comes to academics.

83
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,960
I've just got a decent
memory, that's all.

84
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,510
[YUKIMURA]
Miyake, Hasebe,

85
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,880
I've already gone over
your weakest subjects,

86
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:47,010
and I've come up
with a lesson plan...

87
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,720
I'm terribly sorry,

88
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,850
but specialty cakes have to be
reserved a week in advance.

89
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,100
[ISHIZAKI]
I heard you,

90
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,900
but you've gotta make
an exception this time!

91
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,150
What's his deal?

92
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,360
I recognize him.
He's from Class C.

93
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,400
Come on, guys, stay
focused on the questions.

94
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,280
A cake, huh?

95
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,410
[AYANOKOJI]
That reminds me.

96
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,580
My birthday is coming
up soon. Right.

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,290
It's actually impressive.

98
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,630
[YUKIMURA] They made almost
the exact same mistakes.

99
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,050
So this'll just be
like we're teaching

100
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,130
a single person, then, huh?

101
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:25,680
Class C's gonna be coming up
with our questions, aren't they?

102
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,220
Yeah, they are.

103
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,140
As long as we get
you two up to speed,

104
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,890
it shouldn't be a problem.

105
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:33,440
Even if they throw
us some curveballs.

106
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,810
It's not like they're gonna
stick to the textbook.

107
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:38,940
You honestly think this study
group thing is gonna help?

108
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,270
You have a point.

109
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,610
Teachers will be
reviewing the questions

110
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:45,110
and deciding if
they're appropriate.

111
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,530
Yeah?

112
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,450
If we can figure out where
the school draws the line

113
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,290
when it comes to questions,
it'll be a big help.

114
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,460
[MIYAKE] Yeah, but that's
easier said than done.

115
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,330
How do we find that out?

116
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,710
[AYANOKOJI]
I think I've got a way.

117
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,170
[AYANOKOJI]
For the next step,

118
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,510
we should only turn in questions

119
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,130
that have a good chance
of getting rejected.

120
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,680
Stuff that could be considered
too hard or tricky.

121
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,140
Whether or not they
accept our questions

122
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,810
will tell us where
they draw the line.

123
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:17,600
Yes, I see.
That would be valuable.

124
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:20,190
[AYANOKOJI] How's the question
writing coming along?

125
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:23,110
Hirata and I are
making some progress.

126
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,650
And on the other front,

127
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,030
we're sharing study
group information, too.

128
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,320
Good. How are things
with Kushida?

129
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,160
Pretty much the same.

130
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,950
Any changes in her behavior?

131
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,120
No, and she helped out
as much as she could, too.

132
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,880
I know this is something
that goes without saying,

133
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,210
but don't let her know
about the questions.

134
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,510
Right. Hirata and I are
keeping everything secret.

135
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,800
Although it still
doesn't resolve

136
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,300
our main issue with Kushida.

137
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,140
Agreed.

138
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:57,140
Don't worry, I think I've
got a way to deal with her.

139
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:00,110
Ayanokoji, I actually
have another favor

140
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,150
I'd like to ask of you.

141
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,360
Which is?

142
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,990
On days when Yukimura's
group isn't meeting,

143
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:09,030
could you stop by and help tutor
the members of our group?

144
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,160
[AYANOKOJI]
This again?

145
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,780
[SUZUNE]
There are just too many people.

146
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,490
It's hard to keep
track of everyone.

147
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,040
[AYANOKOJI grunts]

148
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,970
Are you all right?

149
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,770
[SATO] Whoa! I haven't been
to the school's library before!

150
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,860
Have you, Ayanokoji?

151
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,650
[AYANOKOJI]
I've been many times.

152
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:47,780
[SATO] Oh, really?
You must love studying, huh?

153
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,650
[AYANOKOJI]
I do it to kill time.

154
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,370
Don't you have any hobbies
or anything better to do?

155
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,910
Hey, so... am I a problem?

156
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,120
[AYANOKOJI]
What do you mean?

157
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:00,660
I was wondering
if it was all right

158
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,170
for me to work my way into
the study group like I did.

159
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:08,130
I don't mind at all.
It's good that you came along.

160
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:11,090
And if you ask Horikita,
I'm sure she'll say the same.

161
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,720
That's not exactly what I meant.

162
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,890
[SUZUNE] I need for everyone
to stop the side chatter

163
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,430
and focus on studying.

164
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,140
Right! You won't hear a peep!

165
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,680
Yeah, for sure!

166
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:23,980
Hey, so what should I be doing
to get ready for this exam?

167
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,320
You lucked out.

168
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,570
Your partner is here,

169
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,570
so why don't you just
go along with Ayanokoji?

170
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,280
[AYANOKOJI]
Are you sure about that?

171
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,740
My test scores aren't that
much better than Sato's are.

172
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,080
That's a great idea!
It'll be fun!

173
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,410
[AYANOKOJI groans]

174
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,620
I like how, no matter what,

175
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,750
you're always so
calm and collected.

176
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,630
It makes me wonder what you
were like in middle school!

177
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,590
Wait a second, when did
those two get so cozy?

178
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,710
Almost like they're
dating or something!

179
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,630
Yeah, right!

180
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,800
[SUZUNE]
Hey, Ike, Yamauchi.

181
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,550
Quit goofing around and
get your notes out,

182
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,930
we're starting soon.

183
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,180
Everyone ready?

184
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,600
[ALL]
Fine.

185
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,480
[alarm beeping]

186
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,230
[SUZUNE]
That's enough for today.

187
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,310
[YAMAUCHI]
Ah, it's finally over!

188
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,940
Well, thanks for
coming, everybody!

189
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,480
Bye, Horikita!

190
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,360
Sure.

191
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,120
Wanna walk back to
the dorms with me?

192
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,160
Sorry, but I still have a few
things I need to take care of.

193
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,000
Aw, that's too bad.

194
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,000
Yeah.

195
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,830
Well, I'll see you
tomorrow, then.

196
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:34,590
What did you have in mind
for dealing with Kushida?

197
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,720
[SUZUNE]
I've been thinking it over.

198
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,260
If I hadn't come to this school,
none of this would've happened.

199
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:43,430
Kushida would've gotten
along with the whole class.

200
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,850
Not only that, she
would've whole heartedly

201
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,730
helped the class to move up.

202
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:52,070
Thing is, that possibility
was stolen from her

203
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,450
because I'm here.

204
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:58,580
And I know it's not
my fault, of course.

205
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,830
But it does involve me.

206
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,830
What will you do?

207
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:07,210
I've got a plan for
how to deal with her.

208
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,790
[AYANOKOJI]
Mhm.

209
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:19,100
[SUZUNE] Kushida,
sorry for making you wait.

210
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,560
[KIKYO] So, what were you
talking to Ayanokoji about?

211
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,810
That is none of your business.

212
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:27,690
You know how much
I love secrets.

213
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,020
The reason you're trying
to have me expelled

214
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,860
is because I know
about your past

215
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,070
since we went to
the same school.

216
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,530
Have I understood
things correctly?

217
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,660
Yup! That's exactly it!

218
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,280
It's really too bad, Horikita,

219
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:43,240
and I'm sorry that it's
had to come to this.

220
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,660
It doesn't matter
what I have to do,

221
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,880
I'll make sure what happened
stays buried in the past.

222
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,920
I only heard rumors,
nothing more.

223
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,170
But you know I can't take
that risk, don't you?

224
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,880
[SUZUNE sighs]

225
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,550
How about we place a bet?

226
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,720
Sounds interesting!

227
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,470
We'll use the Paper Shuffle.

228
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,350
If I manage to get a higher
score than you on the exam,

229
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:08,520
then I want you to promise

230
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,190
that you'll stop
trying to sabotage me.

231
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,400
I see!

232
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,070
What happens if I get a
higher score than you?

233
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:19,860
In that case, I'll voluntarily
drop out of school.

234
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,410
Ooo!

235
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,910
And we'll only be comparing our
individual scores, correct?

236
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,290
[SUZUNE]
Yes.

237
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,080
I'll have to pass!
That's not very fair!

238
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,880
I don't think I've ever
beaten you head-to-head

239
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,460
when it comes to overall
test scores before!

240
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,250
I've already considered that.

241
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,220
Which is why I'm proposing
that we compete

242
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,050
in just one subject
from our finals.

243
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,970
And I'll even let you
choose the subject.

244
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,260
Huh?

245
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,930
So it'll be fair.

246
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,100
Sounds good, but how are
we going to make sure

247
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,980
that both sides follow through
with their end of the bet?

248
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,690
What if afterwards,
the loser pretends

249
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,980
the bet never happened
in the first place?

250
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:56,530
That won't be a problem.

251
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,780
I've gotten someone to act
as a witness for us.

252
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,700
[KIKYO]
A witness?

253
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:08,500
Sorry for the delay.
It's been some time, Kushida.

254
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,910
[gasps]

255
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,920
Well, that's surprising.
I can't believe you remember me.

256
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,880
Don't read into it.
I just never forget a face.

257
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,380
Does this ease your concern?
I trust that he'll be impartial.

258
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,930
Plus, you know his reputation.

259
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:26,760
I'm sure that you also place
some degree of trust in him.

260
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,520
[KIKYO gasps]

261
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,680
Are you okay with this bet?

262
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,560
It's not my business.

263
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,230
I'm only here to serve as
a witness, nothing more.

264
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,490
[KIKYO] But it's your sister
we're talking about!

265
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:39,740
If I score higher than her,

266
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,990
then she'll have to
leave the school!

267
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:45,620
[MANABU] She's the one who first
proposed the terms of the bet.

268
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,120
She'll have to deal
with the consequences.

269
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:56,040
You want to play for
keeps. I like it.

270
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,920
I'd rather get this
over with already.

271
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,470
Okay. Let's see who can
get a higher score.

272
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:07,810
The subject I choose is math.
You said I could pick, right?

273
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,230
[MANABU]
Then it's done.

274
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,730
There will be severe
consequences

275
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,940
for going back on your word.

276
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,320
No exceptions.

277
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:22,610
I'll be looking forward to the
finals, so good luck to you!

278
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,370
Let's both give these
exams our best efforts.

279
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:28,240
Good luck to you,
too, Ayanokoji!

280
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,910
Come on, you don't think
I'm that stupid, do you?

281
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,500
He's been listening from your
cell phone the whole time!

282
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:38,210
Don't be shy!
Why don't you join us?

283
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,300
[KIKYO]
So, if it's okay with you two,

284
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:49,100
I'd like to propose another
condition onto our little bet.

285
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,390
What do you mean?

286
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,930
It's just a suggestion,

287
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,890
but if I beat your score
on the math final...

288
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:58,400
...I'd like for Ayanokoji to
withdraw from school as well!

289
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,480
I can't agree to that.

290
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:04,150
That's too bad! Oh, well!

291
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,990
Fine by me.

292
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:09,030
I accept. I'll throw in
my lot with Horikita.

293
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,250
I don't need you to step in.
This has nothing to do with you!

294
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,330
[AYANOKOJI]
Tell her that.

295
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,330
[KIKYO laughs]

296
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,540
I'm so glad you
agreed to join in!

297
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,670
I'm sure.

298
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,880
[KIKYO laughs]

299
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,720
Just one thing. I have
a request of my own.

300
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,550
I'd like for you to
tell me everything.

301
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:30,350
What did you do
in middle school?

302
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,220
[gasps]

303
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:35,140
[AYANOKOJI] Don't you think
that I have a right to know?

304
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,940
After all, I'm putting
myself at risk

305
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,480
over a secret I'm
not even privy to.

306
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:43,190
Furthermore, you've been acting
under the assumption

307
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,900
that Horikita already
knows everything.

308
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,570
So that's why.

309
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:48,820
Telling us what really happened

310
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,870
doesn't actually
change anything.

311
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:54,870
I'm not interested in digging
around in Kushida's past!

312
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:58,210
I get that you don't
care, but I do.

313
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,210
How 'bout it?

314
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,460
It's fine.

315
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,840
If you'd rather
keep it to yourself,

316
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,050
we can just call
the whole thing off.

317
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,690
[KIKYO] You want to know
that badly, huh?

318
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,560
[KIKYO sighs]

319
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:25,780
[KIKYO] So tell me, Ayanokoji.
Do you know what it feels like?

320
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,700
To realize that you're better
than everyone else around you?

321
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,530
It's an incredible feeling.

322
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,790
[KIKYO]
In elementary school,

323
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:42,380
people would always
lavish me with praise,

324
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,960
even over the littlest
accomplishments.

325
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,130
If I got the best
grade on a test,

326
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,510
or finished first
in a sports event,

327
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:53,970
I'd instantly become
the center of attention.

328
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:57,100
They'd call me amazing,
incredible, and cute!

329
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,600
I loved those moments of
being in the spotlight,

330
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:02,400
of being seen.

331
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,980
I wanted everyone to notice me.
I needed everyone to praise me.

332
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,360
It was only when I
got that attention

333
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:13,530
that I felt like I
was worth something.

334
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:16,450
I think they call it a
"desire for recognition."

335
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,790
For some reason,
I felt it more strongly

336
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:20,210
than those around me.

337
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:23,540
I began to crave it.

338
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:28,130
Eventually, I started to get
less and less recognition.

339
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,590
No matter how hard I worked,

340
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,930
whether it was in
academics or sports,

341
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,180
everyone stopped paying
attention to me.

342
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:43,980
[KIKYO]
Then I came to the realization:

343
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:48,230
I just had to do the things
nobody else wanted to do.

344
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,030
"It's okay, I'll tutor you!"

345
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,110
"I'll help you with that!"

346
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,110
"I'll be there for you!"

347
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,330
I'd do whatever I could to be
nice and friendly to others.

348
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,740
I made sure I was
everyone's best friend.

349
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:01,080
The most popular
person in class!

350
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,000
I was needed and trusted!

351
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,670
I felt that wonderful
feeling again!

352
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:11,720
Ah! It was pure ecstasy!

353
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,340
It didn't last.

354
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,720
You see, always putting
everyone else's needs

355
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,560
before my own... was painful.

356
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:25,520
[KIKYO]
And that pain only got worse.

357
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:28,020
[scraping]

358
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:32,280
[KIKYO]
It hurt, but I couldn't stop.

359
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,610
I had to suck it up.

360
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,460
[KIKYO]
If I wanted to stay popular,

361
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,210
I couldn't throw away
what I had built.

362
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:52,420
So I endured it,
day in and day out.

363
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:56,590
But it had become
unbearable. I snapped.

364
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,140
[snap]

365
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,770
[KIKYO] I needed an outlet to
release all the pain inside me.

366
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:08,400
So I created a blog!

367
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,570
It was the one place
I could let everything out.

368
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,110
I didn't have to
pretend anymore!

369
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,620
It was like magic; I could
finally breathe again.

370
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,620
It was the perfect answer.

371
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,540
Until one day, a classmate
happened to stumble across it.

372
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,210
Even though I didn't
use any names,

373
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:32,710
they could tell exactly
who the posts were about.

374
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,510
[KIKYO] Eventually,
everyone in class figured out

375
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,590
that I was the one who wrote

376
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:39,180
all those awful
things about them.

377
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,720
Then, the attention
became negative.

378
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,560
They wouldn't listen.

379
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,100
After everything I
had done for them,

380
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:48,100
the entire class turned on me
without a second thought!

381
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,070
Even the boys who
said they liked me!

382
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,860
And the girls who cried on my
shoulder after they got dumped!

383
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,900
I mean, those boys were gross

384
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,570
and there were so many times
I wished they would just die.

385
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,700
And if those girls wanted
to know why they got dumped,

386
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,740
all they had to do
was look in a mirror!

387
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:05,080
The entire class was against me.

388
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,830
My back was against the wall.
I had no other choice!

389
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,630
I did what I had to do;
I used my weapon.

390
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:16,010
I told them everything.
I held nothing back.

391
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:19,970
I even revealed things I hadn't
written about in my blog.

392
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,510
[KIKYO] That he had been
cheating with someone

393
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,770
from another class.

394
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,520
And that she had been
badmouthing her friends

395
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,980
behind their backs!

396
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,440
I brought all those dark secrets

397
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,860
that lurked inside
them to the light.

398
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,860
Then, naturally...

399
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,610
Did you think I
wouldn't find out

400
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,440
that you're messing
around behind my back?

401
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:40,950
[BOTH shouting]

402
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,160
[KIKYO]
Just like that,

403
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,950
all the anger they had
pointed in my direction

404
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,160
suddenly turned
in on themselves.

405
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,960
That's the way it had to be!

406
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:54,590
Since there's no way they'd
go back to praising me.

407
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,630
I hope that answers
your question!

408
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,840
[AYANOKOJI]
So she used the "truth."

409
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:03,100
It's certainly effective,
but it's a double-edged sword.

410
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,930
[KIKYO]
To be perfectly honest with you,

411
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,220
I don't know Class D
all that well.

412
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:11,060
But I've gathered enough secrets
to really shake things up.

413
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:14,020
If I felt like it.

414
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,190
Looking back on it,

415
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,940
my only real mistake
was venting online.

416
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,700
You never know
who's looking at it

417
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:23,240
and they could get a screenshot
of it even if you delete it.

418
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,530
Things are better now!

419
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,620
Anytime I'm feeling angry
or stressed out,

420
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,870
I just use my words instead!

421
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,170
[KIKYO] I swear to god, I hate
you, I hate you, I hate you!

422
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,800
I wish you would just
drop dead, Horikita!

423
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,710
[giggles]

424
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,430
All that for attention?
What's wrong with you?

425
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,050
[KIKYO] Of course!
It's my purpose in life!

426
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,470
There's nothing I love more

427
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,390
than being noticed and praised
by everyone around me!

428
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,230
And whenever somebody
tells me a secret

429
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,060
that they've never shared
with anyone else,

430
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:56,400
I get this feeling inside me
that's simply indescribable!

431
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:01,860
[AYANOKOJI] A monster consumed
by her "desire for recognition."

432
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,820
Since you know about my past,

433
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:07,410
I'm sure you can see why
I want to keep it to myself!

434
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:08,990
Don't forget your promise!

435
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,370
If I beat Horikita,

436
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:12,580
the both of you will have
to drop out of school.

437
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:15,290
I'm looking forward to it!
