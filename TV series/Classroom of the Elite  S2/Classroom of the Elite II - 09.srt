1
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,950
[RYUEN]
So...

2
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,660
I hear you've been pretty
busy lately, Kushida.

3
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,950
Something about a bet with
Horikita and Ayanokoji?

4
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,580
I couldn't pass up
the opportunity!

5
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,330
And as long as you
give me the answers

6
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,130
to your class's questions,

7
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,760
there's no chance
I'll lose to them!

8
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,880
Sure. Although,
you know I can't just

9
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,760
hand them over
for free, don't you?

10
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,220
Yeah, of course!

11
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,060
But you see, you are
getting something for them!

12
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,730
I'll make sure Class C
wins the Paper Shuffle.

13
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,640
[RYUEN]
That's quite the promise.

14
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,600
Just trust me on this!

15
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,570
By the way, any progress
on tracking down this

16
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,030
"shadowy mastermind" of yours?

17
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:14,620
It's only a matter of time
before they're exposed.

18
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,030
And I know just
the person for it.

19
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,930
[HASEBE]
Jeez. Is it just me,

20
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,550
or are today's
questions extra hard?

21
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,600
Yukimoo!

22
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,810
I told you to stop
calling me that.

23
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,350
It's demeaning.

24
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,230
Aw. C'mon, let me have this.

25
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:11,110
Stop messing around, Hasebe!
Let's just get this over with.

26
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,900
Oh, wow, you're raring
to go! How studious!

27
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,110
[MIYAKE] I'm already giving up
club time for this.

28
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,780
I'd like to get out of here
sometime today, please.

29
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,280
Stop distracting them.

30
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,500
It's good to see you're so
motivated to study at least.

31
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,630
Fine. But first, I'm
getting another drink!

32
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,710
[HASEBE yelps]

33
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,920
[HASEBE]
Whoops!

34
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,430
Oh, sorry.

35
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,640
Really? I said sorry!

36
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,150
Well, well, what do
we have here?

37
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,520
Ryuen!

38
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,230
I never got a
response from you.

39
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,570
What are you talking about?

40
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,070
[AYANOKOJI]
That email.

41
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:03,990
What do you think?

42
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,410
Anything in particular
standing out? Hiyori?

43
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,670
[HIYORI]
I'm not sure.

44
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,500
Both of these guys have
really boring faces.

45
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,630
Completely forgettable.

46
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,170
People should be,
at the very least,

47
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,880
somewhat memorable.

48
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,470
Don't be like that.

49
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,470
After all, there's a good
chance you'll be spending

50
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,890
a lot of time with them later.

51
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,270
Why don't you just
leave us alone? Okay?

52
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,850
Don't worry,
I'm heading out now.

53
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,480
I'll be seeing
you all again soon.

54
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:41,030
[HIYORI]
Here. To apologize for earlier.

55
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:45,080
Once finals are done with,
I hope we can talk again!

56
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:54,040
[HASEBE] So, that was,
like, super weird, right?

57
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,420
[MIYAKE] I mean, all they
did was come over

58
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,630
and waste a bunch of our time.

59
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,470
[HASEBE] Mm! Man,
that really hits the spot!

60
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,510
There's nothing like ice cream
after a study session!

61
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,020
It's filled with preservatives
and artificial ingredients.

62
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,230
If you let stuff
like that stop you,

63
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,020
then how do you eat anything?

64
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,610
There's nothing wrong with
being health conscious.

65
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,530
Though I shouldn't expect
too much from junk food.

66
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,780
You always such a killjoy?

67
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,990
[HASEBE chuckles]
To be honest,

68
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,780
I do kinda like this.

69
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,160
What's so fun about this?

70
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,250
You know, Miyacchi and
I have always sort of

71
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,160
done things on our own.

72
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,710
But these study
sessions have been

73
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,420
actually way comfier
than I was first expecting.

74
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,750
So, I was thinking...

75
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,710
Instead of being
a bunch of leftovers,

76
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,630
the four of us should
become an official group.

77
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,180
Sounds good. Yeah, I'm on board.

78
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:48,430
So, we agree!
What do you guys think?

79
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,680
I'm really only here
to help improve your grades

80
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,690
for the Paper Shuffle.

81
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,650
Although, if you want
to create a real study group,

82
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,190
I'm not opposed.

83
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,610
Yeah, right!
Just say you want in!

84
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:00,440
[YUKIMURA sighs]

85
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,190
That's what I thought!

86
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,610
You've got a point.

87
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,570
You all have been surprisingly
easy to get along with.

88
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,700
Yeah! Then it's settled!

89
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,460
[YUKIMURA] If we do this, no
more of those silly nicknames.

90
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,250
[HASEBE] We'll use our
given names, then.

91
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,210
Just call me Haruka!

92
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,710
I'm Akito.

93
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,550
Kiyotaka for me.

94
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,970
I guess that makes
you Teruhiko, right?

95
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:30,100
It doesn't! Seriously,
don't use that name.

96
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,480
[MIYAKE]
You don't like your own name?

97
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,690
[YUKIMURA] My mother
came up with Teruhiko.

98
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,860
But she abandoned my father
and I when I was little.

99
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,240
I'll never forgive her.

100
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,990
Oh, sorry. I wasn't
trying to vent.

101
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,870
[HASEBE]
It's fine! I brought it up.

102
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,370
It's not like you knew.

103
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:56,370
How about instead, just call
me "Keisei" from now on?

104
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,500
Sure thing.

105
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,130
It's the name my dad
wanted to give me.

106
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:03,630
No problem! I like it!

107
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,130
It's fine with me, too.

108
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,630
A pleasure, Keisei.

109
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,760
Right!

110
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,140
Kiyotaka, Akito and,
of course, Haruka.

111
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,350
Yeah!

112
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,890
And with that, this new
group is official!

113
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,940
[SAKURA]
Excuse me! Hold on!

114
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,520
Um. Wait!

115
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,780
Sakura?

116
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,570
Well, you see...

117
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,320
I was wondering if
maybe it'd be all right

118
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,410
for me to join your group, too!

119
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,450
[YUKIMURA] To be honest,
Horikita would probably

120
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,410
be a better teacher
than either of us.

121
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,910
Oh. that's fine!

122
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,580
She's got her hands full as is,
and if I'm being honest,

123
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:41,040
I'd rather be in a group
with all of you.

124
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,800
No objections here.

125
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,050
What do you think?
Should we let her join us?

126
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:49,010
Well... I don't have
a problem with it.

127
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,680
Sakura's pretty quiet anyway.

128
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,180
Hold on a sec!

129
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,930
I'm sorry, but it's
not that simple,

130
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,850
there's something
you gotta do first.

131
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:02,940
Sorry, I'm not following you.

132
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,240
If you really wanna be
a part of this group,

133
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,780
then you have to call us by
our given names or a nickname!

134
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,530
Here's Keisei,
Akito, and Haruka.

135
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,490
Right. Hello, Keisei.

136
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,910
Uh, Akito... and Haruka!

137
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,380
Also, um, Kiyo...

138
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,800
...tio... kaka... I mean, K--

139
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,420
Kiyotaka!

140
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,510
Good! 'Kay, you're in!

141
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,970
Now, call him "Kiyo- <i>pon</i> "!

142
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,010
[AYANOKOJI]
Excuse me? "Kiyo- <i>pon</i> "?

143
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,810
It's, uh, Airi?

144
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,310
[gasps] Yeah!

145
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,890
Now that Airi's here,

146
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:41,560
I'm pleased to announce we're
officially the Ayanokoji group!

147
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,570
Hold on. I think we
should revisit the name.

148
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,770
Hey, why not?

149
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,320
You are the one who
brought us all together.

150
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,450
It'd be better than
the "Yukimura Group."

151
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,030
How embarrassing.

152
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:53,450
--[HASEBE] It's settled, then!
--[SAKURA] Thanks for having me!

153
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,870
[YUKIMURA laughs]

154
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,250
[KARUIZAWA]
A movie?

155
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,000
[AYANOKOJI]
Uh-huh. Sometime tomorrow.

156
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,550
[KARUIZAWA]
Thanks for the short notice.

157
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:10,050
Whatever, it's fine. So,
what movie are we seeing?

158
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:12,340
There are some good ones
that just came out!

159
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,850
[AYANOKOJI]
Wait a minute.

160
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,350
Why are you acting like
you're coming along with us?

161
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,850
[gasps]

162
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,600
[AYANOKOJI]
It'll just be my group.

163
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,770
We're going to the movie theater

164
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:24,310
after we're done with
our study session.

165
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,520
[KARUIZAWA]
I see.

166
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,320
When did you all
become so friendly?

167
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,990
[AYANOKOJI]
Anyways, I was calling you about

168
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,410
the test strategy meeting
with everyone tomorrow.

169
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,620
I need you to do me
another favor.

170
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,200
What do you need?

171
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,750
[AYANOKOJI]
Do you understand the plan?

172
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:46,040
Look, what you're asking for
is a lot easier said than done!

173
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:48,750
What's the point of it, anyway?

174
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,670
[AYANOKOJI]
I'll explain everything later.

175
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,930
Yeah, you better!
Well, see you tomorrow.

176
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,430
[phone chimes]

177
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,210
[KARUIZAWA] Look at this!
They've got a ton of songs!

178
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,620
Hey, Karuizawa.

179
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,920
We came here to work,
not to have fun!

180
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,340
[KARUIZAWA]
Aw, come on!

181
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,670
The whole point of this meeting

182
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,720
is to discuss our strategy
for the Paper Shuffle.

183
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,510
Fine, whatever!

184
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:37,220
But if you ask me, not singing
at a karaoke is just dumb.

185
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,600
It's okay, we can sing
after we're done!

186
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,980
Good enough for me!

187
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,560
Back to what I was saying
about the study groups.

188
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,730
It looks like the entire class
is making good progress.

189
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:52,150
Yeah! I told you my
flash-card game was on point!

190
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,530
Yes!

191
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,860
I wouldn't be so fast
to celebrate if I were you.

192
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,870
All that studying and
you're barely doing better

193
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,240
than a middle schooler.

194
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:03,710
Uh-- Come on, can't you
just let me have one win?

195
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,960
[SUZUNE] How are Hasebe
and Miyake doing?

196
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,580
I have no complaints.

197
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,290
That's good to hear!

198
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:13,720
It would be terrible if
anyone was left behind!

199
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,180
Let's get through this together!
I know we can do it!

200
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,510
[KARUIZAWA] As if.
That's easy for you to say.

201
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,010
[KIKYO]
Is something wrong?

202
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,730
The teacher said that every
year someone gets expelled.

203
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:25,980
You say we're all gonna pass,

204
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,560
but you can't guarantee
me or Sudo won't fail.

205
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,940
I'm gonna pass!

206
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,570
I'm really sorry, I wasn't
trying to offend you!

207
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,690
You're always talking about

208
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,280
looking on the
bright side, Kushida.

209
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,570
Must be easy when
you're smart, huh?

210
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,700
Calm down, Karuizawa!

211
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,660
I've wanted to say
this for a while.

212
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,210
You way overdo it with
that "good girl" act.

213
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,580
Um, I don't know what
you're talking about!

214
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,880
The two of you can
settle this later!

215
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,710
We should be focusing on
the upcoming test--

216
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:54,130
[KARUIZAWA]
You stay out of this, Horikita!

217
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:56,510
Look. You may act nice,

218
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,550
but I know you think
you're better than us!

219
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,100
That's not true at all!

220
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,180
[KARUIZAWA] Then stop pretending
like everything's just fine!

221
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,600
I promise you, I'm not!

222
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,100
What are you gonna do if
I fail and get expelled, huh?

223
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,230
[KIKYO]
But you won't fail!

224
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,940
[KIKYO gasps]

225
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:12,860
Whoa!

226
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,190
You can't do that!

227
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,490
Come on, we've talked
about this already!

228
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,570
[gasps]

229
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,360
[KIKYO]
Wait! Please don't blame her!

230
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,660
She's under a lot
of stress right now!

231
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,870
[YUKIMURA]
Even so, that was unacceptable!

232
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,370
Uh... I just...

233
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,500
You have to calm down.
If you storm out of here,

234
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,380
you'll only end up
regretting it down the road.

235
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,300
I think you should
start by apologizing.

236
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,260
[KARUIZAWA]
Sorry.

237
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,260
It's okay, I forgive you.

238
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,430
To be honest, I should've been
more sensitive to your situation

239
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,010
and how you were feeling.

240
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,640
Thank you.

241
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,060
[sighs]

242
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,520
I don't think I've ever
seen her freak out like that.

243
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,650
Wow, as if you're in
any position to talk.

244
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,820
I know this doesn't come
close to making it right,

245
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,150
but would you let me
clean your uniform for you?

246
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,650
[KIKYO]
You don't have to do that!

247
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,530
[KARUIZAWA]
Unless I do something,

248
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,280
it'll just keep eating at me!

249
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,620
I won't be able
to sleep at night!

250
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,450
I'm begging you, please!

251
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,080
[KIKYO]
Don't cry, Karuizawa!

252
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,910
It's okay! You can
clean my uniform!

253
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,590
[CHABASHIRA] So, then these
are the questions your class

254
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:20,880
has decided to submit
for the Paper Shuffle.

255
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,590
I see.

256
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,760
Although, I wasn't expecting you
to be the one to turn them in.

257
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:29,350
I couldn't say no
when Horikita asked!

258
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,770
[CHABASHIRA]
I understand. Thank you.

259
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:34,900
Actually, can I ask you
a favor, Ms. Chabashira?

260
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,730
I'm afraid someone
might come by later

261
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,900
and try to replace all the
questions at the last minute.

262
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,280
It's possible.

263
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,700
I was thinking.

264
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,990
If someone comes by and
tries to turn in a different

265
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,740
question sheet, you could
pretend to take it,

266
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,040
but then throw it away
once they're gone.

267
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,710
Very well then.

268
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,920
I suppose I could go along
with what you're asking.

269
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,090
Yay!

270
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,670
Thank you so much
for all of your help!

271
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,350
Going behind everyone's
backs and swapping out

272
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,600
your class's question
sheet, are you?

273
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,680
How very cold-blooded.

274
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,850
I already told you,
I'll do whatever it takes

275
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:15,150
to get Suzune Horikita
kicked out of school!

276
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:19,360
Anyway, don't you have
something to give to me, now?

277
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,900
[RYUEN]
But of course.

278
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:24,740
A copy of Class C's
question sheet.

279
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,700
[KIKYO] I can't wait to see
how everything turns out!

280
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,450
Good luck. I'm counting on you.

281
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,670
[SATO] Hey, good morning!
Guess it's finally test time.

282
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,840
[AYANOKOJI]
Did you sleep okay last night?

283
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,090
Kind of.

284
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,340
I was just feeling
a little nervous, y'know?

285
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,050
You're gonna do fine.

286
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,680
I've seen first-hand
how much effort

287
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,720
you've been putting
into your studies lately.

288
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,970
[gasps]

289
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,060
G'morning, Sato!

290
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,270
Hey, morning to you, too.

291
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,390
[KARUIZAWA]
It's funny, I thought I saw

292
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,110
you two back there!
So, what's up?

293
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:01,150
You guys having a
last-minute study session?

294
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,530
Oh, no! Just talking.

295
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:04,990
If you say so!

296
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,780
Hey, do you wanna grab
something to drink real quick?

297
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,950
Okay! See you later, Ayanokoji!

298
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,330
[KARUIZAWA]
Let's go!

299
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,340
[AYANOKOJI]
Hm?

300
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,540
[HIRATA] Wow, I've never seen
Karuizawa get jealous like that.

301
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,170
What does that mean?

302
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,840
I've gotten to know her
pretty well at this point.

303
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,720
It'd explain why she's been
so hung up on you lately.

304
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,800
Think someone's got a crush.

305
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:32,430
No way, you're reading
too much into it.

306
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,140
[HIRATA]
I don't know about that.

307
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:37,810
Maybe I am, but it'd be good
to see you two together.

308
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,860
Me and Karuizawa, huh?

309
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,900
[HIRATA] She deserves better
than some pretend relationship.

310
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,650
Well, anyway.
It's none of my business.

311
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,910
[AYANOKOJI]
Hm.

312
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,460
I barely recognize
our class like this.

313
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,840
Yeah, it's a good sign.

314
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,590
[AYANOKOJI]
Agatha Christie, huh?

315
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,090
That's ominous.

316
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,050
Nobody is getting expelled.

317
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:09,390
Of course, that
includes us, too.

318
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,100
[CHABASHIRA]
You may begin.

319
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,310
[AYANOKOJI]
Looks like Yukimura was right.

320
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:22,320
These questions aren't so bad
if you understand the material.

321
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,730
But I'm curious how she's doing.

322
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,360
No.

323
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,620
[KIKYO]
What's this?

324
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,880
[YAMAUCHI]
Kill me!

325
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,630
[IKE]
My brain hurts so bad.

326
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,380
How was it for you, Miyacchi?

327
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,590
[gibberish]

328
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,260
Sorry, Suzune! I gave
it everything I had,

329
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,510
but I think I maybe got
a 40 at best!

330
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,430
That's plenty. Based on
the questions we were given,

331
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,140
I'd be surprised if I ended up
with less than a 90,

332
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,060
so we should be fine.

333
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,440
[KEN]
That's awesome!

334
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,730
[bang]

335
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,360
[door opens]

336
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:12,950
[door closes]

337
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,910
[KEN]
What's her problem?

338
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,910
[KIKYO]
What the hell was that?

339
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,710
Why was the exam
completely different

340
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,670
from the question
sheet you gave me?

341
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,340
Thanks to you,
Horikita's gonna win!

342
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,670
How could you
betray me like that?

343
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,920
Heh. You still haven't
figured it out yet?

344
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,220
Huh?

345
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,850
You were so sure you
had outmaneuvered Suzune.

346
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,520
In the end, you're the
one who got played.

347
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,140
What?

348
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,020
[AYANOKOJI]
It's all very simple.

349
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,110
Kushida thought that
handing in a question sheet

350
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:48,230
before anyone else did was all
she would have to do to win.

351
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,780
But Horikita had
already planned for that.

352
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,150
How'd she do it?

353
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,080
The same day we found out
about the Paper Shuffle,

354
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,240
she went to talk to the teacher.

355
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,370
During the meeting
with Ms. Chabashira,

356
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:03,000
Horikita got her to agree
to two things.

357
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,040
Number one, she would only
accept a question sheet

358
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:09,340
turned in by Horikita
personally, as the class rep.

359
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,680
And two, if anyone else
submitted a question sheet,

360
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,680
she would pretend to accept it.

361
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,760
Then, without letting them know,

362
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:20,060
she'd get rid of the
new set of questions.

363
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,850
I see. Then that
means Horikita knew

364
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:24,440
exactly what Kushida
was gonna try to do!

365
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,020
That's right.

366
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:28,980
Which also means we didn't need
to do your little plan at all!

367
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,690
After everything I did
to make a scene

368
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,860
and plant that
cheat sheet on her.

369
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,410
I get that it was in case
things went wrong,

370
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,660
but now everyone
thinks I'm crazy!

371
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,990
I had my doubts.

372
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,330
But Horikita managed
to pull through.

373
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:45,170
In the end, I didn't even
have to lift a finger.

374
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:50,050
[KIKYO]
I hate that stupid bitch!

375
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,670
[RYUEN] You didn't hold up
your end of the agreement.

376
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,300
So why would you
expect me to just

377
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,600
hand over the real
question sheet?

378
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,810
[KIKYO] I was so close
to getting rid of her!

379
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,810
Yeah, right. You lost
before the game even began.

380
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,020
[KIKYO gasps]

381
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:08,190
Don't touch me!

382
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:11,980
Don't flatter yourself.
Look at this.

383
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,900
[gasps]

384
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:17,280
I thought so.
It's a little cheat sheet.

385
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:21,080
[KIKYO] That's not mine!
What was it doing in my jacket?

386
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,830
[RYUEN]
If I had to take a guess,

387
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:26,710
somebody in Class D was about
to throw you under the bus.

388
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,920
[gasps] Hold on!

389
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,300
Something about this
doesn't make any sense.

390
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,840
All the answers on this
piece of paper.

391
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,930
They're for the
questions you gave me!

392
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:40,510
But if you and I were the only
ones who saw the questions,

393
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,680
then how did the
mastermind know?

394
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:45,560
[laughs] You're finally
catching on.

395
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:50,360
[growls] You handed it
over to them? You did this!

396
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,940
[RYUEN]
Don't be ridiculous, Kikyo.

397
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:56,070
I've never thought of you as
anything but a tool to use.

398
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,320
[gasps]

399
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,160
It really shouldn't come
as any surprise to you.

400
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:16,720
I'll admit, you beat me
this time. Are you happy?

401
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,300
Will you stop trying
to sabotage me, now?

402
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:23,100
Just remember, you agreed
to it as part of the bet.

403
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,140
You don't have to
worry about that.

404
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,350
I'll be sure to keep the promise
I made to you and your brother.

405
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,270
I'll even sign a contract.

406
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,230
[SUZUNE]
There's no need. It's fine.

407
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,730
I trust that you won't
go back on your word.

408
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,700
Yeah, no. I hate you.

409
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,370
Yes, I'm sure you do.

410
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:46,620
But still, I'm gonna do whatever
it takes to get you to like me.

411
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,380
You can try, but it won't work!

412
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,090
Oh, and by the way.

413
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,460
As far as my promise goes,

414
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:57,010
I only said that I'd
stop sabotaging you.

415
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:00,010
What?

416
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:02,680
Is she gonna go after him next?

417
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,850
[AYANOKOJI]
Just as expected.

418
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:09,440
Ryuen decided to agree
to the trade.

419
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,690
"Give me the question sheet
that Class C submitted

420
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:15,650
for the Paper Shuffle,
as well as the answers for it.

421
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:18,490
Or significantly alter
the question sheet

422
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:21,950
you give to Kikyo Kushida
without telling her."

423
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,830
In exchange, I told him
that Horikita had already

424
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:28,330
figured out and come up with
counter to Kushida's plan.

425
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:33,080
I kinda wish I could've seen
the surprise on his face.

426
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:35,750
In the end, he chose
the second option,

427
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,210
changing the question sheet
he handed over to Kushida.

428
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,470
[RYUEN]
Incredible.

429
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:44,140
This mastermind knows
me all too well.

430
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,350
In a single move, he protected
Suzune from expulsion

431
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:50,680
and drove a wedge between
Kikyo and Class C.

432
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:51,850
It's only a matter of time

433
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,440
before he's forced
into a corner.

434
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,280
And if he still doesn't
wanna come out of hiding,

435
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,200
I'll break his toys, and I won't
stop until he reveals himself.

436
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:06,280
[RYUEN] You'll pay
the price for using me.

437
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:07,950
That I promise.

438
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,410
[AYANOKOJI] I gave you
the chance to back off.

439
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,040
But go ahead and throw
everything you have at me.

440
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:19,510
I'm more than happy to entertain
you anytime, anywhere.
