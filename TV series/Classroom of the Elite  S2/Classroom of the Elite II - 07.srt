[MANABU]
For the past two years,

2
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,950
I have served the student body

3
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,490
as the student council
president with pride.

4
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:35,160
I will forever be grateful for
the opportunity I was given.

5
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,790
Thank you all.

6
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,080
And with that, I'll conclude
my resignation speech.

7
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,580
So farewell, everyone.

[AYANOKOJI]
Interesting.

10
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,130
She's taking it
surprisingly well.

11
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,800
[ANNOUNCER 205A] Thank you
for all of your hard work,

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,010
President Horikita.

13
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,680
And now, we'll hear a few words

14
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,600
from the incoming student
council president.

15
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,150
Hello, everyone!

16
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,440
For those of you who
aren't familiar with me,

17
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:08,230
I'm Miyabi Nagumo
from classroom 2A.

18
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,240
I'll get straight
to the point.

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,990
My vision for this school

20
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,780
is to turn it into a true
meritocracy for every student!

21
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,790
Those with talent and ability
will rise to the top,

22
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,330
while those without
will be left behind.

23
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,630
Just as things should be.

24
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,880
I was surprised
by your performance

25
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:33,010
in the sports festival.

26
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,260
Oh, thanks.

27
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,640
Give Horikita a warning for me.

28
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,140
She needs to be
on guard for Ryuen.

29
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,640
I'm curious.

30
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,770
Didn't your class form an
alliance with him before?

31
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,230
A mistake I'm still paying for.

32
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,530
I never should've gotten
involved with that snake.

33
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,530
Ryuen is my enemy
as much as yours.

34
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:55,530
I see. I'll let her know.

35
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:56,870
[KATSURAGI]
Please do.

36
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,080
They're feeling
the pressure, too.

[SATO]
Hey.

39
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,420
So, um. You mind coming
with me for a second?

40
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,760
There's something
I wanna talk about.

41
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,650
I know this is kinda random,

42
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,440
but I've been
meaning to ask you.

43
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,440
Are you seeing anyone
right now, Ayanokoji?

44
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:58,450
Just you. No one's here?

45
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,820
I don't mean like
who you literally see!

46
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,330
I'm asking if you have
a girlfriend or not!

47
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,040
So, do you?

48
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,580
No, I don't.

49
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,670
Oh. That's good to hear.

50
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,170
[SATO] Why don't we
exchange phone numbers?

51
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,300
You know,

52
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,090
since both of us are
in the same class?

53
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,180
I'd be okay with that.

54
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,480
[AYANOKOJI]
Hey. Where's this coming from?

55
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,440
During the sports festival...

56
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,190
When I watched your race,

57
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,230
I couldn't help but notice
how impressive you were.

58
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,240
And I realized you're
actually quite handsome.

59
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,240
On top of that that,
you're nice, too!

60
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,240
[SATO]
Um. Anyway.

61
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,330
That's all I wanted! Thanks!

62
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:58,170
[CHABASHIRA] It's clear you only
have one thing on your minds.

63
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:02,050
Therefore, I'll reveal your
midterm results now.

64
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,640
[STUDENT 207A]
Are you kidding me?

65
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,390
Dreams do come true!

00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,690
Whoa! Look at Ken's score!

67
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,020
Yeah!

68
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,740
Hardly worth shouting about.

00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,030
Yeah, right!

00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,950
[AYANOKOJI]
Just like a puppy

71
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,120
[CHABASHIRA]
Since you all passed,

72
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,530
no one will be expelled
this time around.

73
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,700
In my three years with Class D,

74
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,080
this is the first group of
students to go this long

75
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,790
without any dropouts.
I'm impressed.

76
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,590
Excellent work.

the props we deserve!

[YUKIMURA] It's actually
kind of unsettling.

80
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,010
Of course,

00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,220
you're not out of
the woods just yet.

82
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,100
You'll have to prove yourselves
during the next special exam,

83
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,430
which will serve as your finals.

84

This test is called
the Paper Shuffle.

Uh. What's that?

86
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,360
[CHABASHIRA] For this exam,
you will be split into pairs.

87
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,690
In order to pass you'll
need to work together

88
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,070
Will we be competing
with each other?

to choose the pairs?

That's right!

Can you tell us how our

It's freakin' tests

It's to ascertain your
current academic prowess

and determine where
you stand in the class.

There aren't any penalties.
So don't worry.

Thank goodness for that!

107
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,610
That said,

108
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,240
these test scores are crucial
to the Paper Shuffle.

109
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,410
So, you ought to do your best.

110
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,210
[CHABASHIRA] If, on the
upcoming special exam,

111
00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:00,380
a pair's total score in any
subject falls below 60 points,

112
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,500
both students will be expelled.

[CLASS gasps]

114
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,220
Because only the total is
considered, if one of you

115
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,760
gets a zero and the other
scores a 60, both pass.

116
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,260
And one more thing.

117
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,350
There's a minimum total score
for all subjects combined.

118
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,810
I'll give you a more
accurate number later.

119
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,310
Just know that, on average,

120
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,440
the requirement is
around 700 points.

121
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,320
[AYANOKOJI]
Across eight subjects.

122
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,690
That means, for each exam,
everyone needs to get

123
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,530
an average of 44 points.

124
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,990
And finally...

125
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,870
For this test,
you'll be writing it.

All of you.

127
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,120
Huh?!

128
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,540
[CHABASHIRA]
It's up to you to come up with

129
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,580
the questions for the exam.

130
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:42,420
Which will be answered by
one of the other classes.

131
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,420
You'll also pick a class
you hope gets your questions.

132
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,130
So, choose wisely.

133
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,010
If a class is picked
multiple times,

134
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,930
the test they will
get will be random.

135
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,470
Additionally, each classes'
score will be compared

136
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,930
to that of the class that
received their questions.

137
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,640
And whoever ends up
with a higher score

138
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:00,060
will steal 50 class
points from the other.

139
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,310
The test is a direct challenge.

140
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,570
What if they ask something
that can't be answered?

141
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,070
Doesn't seem fair.

Hah. How laughable,
everything has an answer.

[CHABASHIRA]
There's no need to worry.

144
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:12,870
We've accounted for that.

145
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,950
The teachers will be
reviewing all questions.

146
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,120
Obviously, cheating
will be severely punished,

147
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:22,080
resulting in
immediate expulsion.

148
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,340
Every year,

00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,920
a pair or two gets
expelled during this exam.

It would be a shame if you
broke our streak with this.

00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,340
Something to consider.

on how to write your

00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:03,630
[KARUIZAWA] Hey, I've got
a question for you.

162
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,880
Earlier. Sato asked
you out, right?

163
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,640
[AYANOKOJI]
Who told you that?

164
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,060
[sighs] It came from
Sato, herself! Obviously!

165
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,140
It's not like it's
a secret or anything!

166
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,520
She told a bunch of people
she was gonna ask you out.

167
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,650
Well, it's not like he'd
know anything about it.

168
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:30,530
Things work totally
different for boys.

169
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,280
Ugh. He saw me?

170
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,660
Ugh... As dense as that guy is,

171
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,370
sometimes he's
really perceptive.

172
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,620
[HIRATA]
Karuizawa!

173
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:45,210
We're having a meeting
to discuss the special exam.

174
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,960
[KARUIZAWA]
Uh. Sure! Got it!

175
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,380
If it's all right with you all,

176
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,800
I'd like to start
the meeting now.

177
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,350
What, right here?
Can't we go somewhere else?

178
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,810
Maybe a café!

179
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:01,850
Come on! Right? It'll be fun.

180
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,440
Fine, then. We'll relocate.

181
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,360
[KIKYO]
Excuse me.

182
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,730
Would you mind if
I joined you guys?

183
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,740
If that's okay.

184
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,410
Well, if you ask me.

185
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:18,830
Kushida could really help,
she's friends with everyone.

186
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,080
Yes, of course! Appreciate it.

187
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,540
This works out,

188
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,500
since I've been meaning to
talk to you about something.

189
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,040
Thanks so much!

190
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:30,420
Why don't you all go
on ahead without me.

191
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,510
I'll catch up.

192
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,670
I need to talk with Ayanokoji.

193
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:39,260
[KEN]
We'll save you guys some seats!

194
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:42,520
You ok with that?
Letting her come along?

195
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,190
Saying no would've only
caused more problems.

196
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,820
Right. So, what did you
want to talk about?

197
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,030
We can't keep them
waiting too long.

198
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:55,150
I don't care to meddle
in other people's business,

199
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,780
or air out their dirty laundry.

200
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:02,120
But you should know
Kushida's past.

201
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:18,140
[SUZUNE]
Both Kushida and I

202
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:22,350
went to the same middle school.

203
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,600
It was a rather large school.

204
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,350
So, we never got put
into the same class.

205
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,730
Which is why I hardly
remembered her.

206
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:34,070
But something happened during
our final year at that school.

207
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,740
[SUZUNE]
No one knew exactly what.

208
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:43,290
But it completely tore
one of the classes apart.

209
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,660
From all the rumors
that were circulating,

210
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,630
it was caused by one person.

211
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,920
A girl who was in that class.

212
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,010
You believe it was Kushida?

213
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,590
I honestly don't
know what to think.

214
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,100
What could she have done to make
her class break apart like that?

215
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,470
I don't get it.

216
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,270
They were in constant
turmoil until graduation.

217
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,600
But how?

218
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:13,650
Can a single person really
destroy an entire class?

219
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:17,030
I can think of a couple ways.

220
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,200
Let me ask.

221
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,780
What's the most surefire method
to get what you want?

222
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:29,040
I don't know, I'd say
violence, I guess?

223
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,130
Throughout history, there's been
no better tool than that.

224
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:36,090
[AYANOKOJI]
But that's not Kushida's style.

225
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,880
Whatever her method,

226
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:41,300
it seems that it's just as
effective as violence is.

227
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:44,140
We could spend all
day speculating.

228
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,470
At the end of the day,
I'm an obstacle to her.

229
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,810
Even though I don't
actually have a clue

230
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:50,310
what happened back then.

231
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:53,690
[AYANOKOJI] You'll have a hard
time convincing her of that.

232
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,400
If you ask me, your
best course of action

233
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,860
may be to take things
into your own hands.

234
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,200
Are you saying I should
get Kushida expelled?

235
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,450
If you do go on the offensive,
it could save you the trouble.

236
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,370
Weren't you the person
who got on my case

237
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,330
when I was thinking about
cutting Sudo loose?

238
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,460
What's changed now?

239
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,420
Kushida will continue to
plague us until you're gone.

240
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,670
She's quite stubborn.

241
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,470
[SUZUNE] Well, things have
only gotten to this point

242
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,350
because I refused to
confront her about it.

243
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,640
And she's a talented person.

244
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,390
She could be a valuable
asset to our class.

245
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,900
So, you think you
can convince her?

246
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,070
I can! I'll keep on
trying to talk to her.

247
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:42,610
We aren't her enemy.
I'll make sure she sees that.

248
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,120
Very well.

249
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,080
If you're really
that determined,

250
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,750
I'll leave it up
to you to handle.

251
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:49,830
Just watch.

252
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,960
And this time, don't interfere!

253
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,750
I don't want you to step in
like with the festival.

254
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,130
So, you knew.

255
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,130
I had an idea.

256
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:01,340
I found it extremely annoying
that you planned around

257
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,760
the assumption
that I would fail.

258
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,510
That said, I guess you did
help me back there.

259
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,350
That's good to hear.

260
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,100
[SUZUNE]
Listen.

261
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:17,400
I'm not sure what I
would've done without you.

262
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,980
Thank you.

263
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:30,500
[AYANOKOJI] Is it really so hard
for her to say "thank you"?

264
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,410
[RYUEN]
Now, call me crazy.

265
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,580
But there's been something fishy

266
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:37,670
about the last couple
of special exams.

267
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,880
I don't believe for a
second it's a coincidence.

268
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,010
Someone's out there
pulling Class D's strings.

269
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:48,760
Not to mention a spy
helping them out.

270
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:51,270
So, which one of you
betrayed me?

271
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:54,940
Really? You can't be serious!

272
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,690
[RYUEN]
A question for you!

273
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:01,280
Do any of you know what the
strongest force in world is?

274
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,820
It's simple:
unrestrained violence.

275
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,950
I'll give you
one last chance.

276
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,370
Whoever the traitor is,

277
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,830
come clean, and I'll
let it slide this time.

278
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:16,080
I feel like I'm being
more than reasonable here.

to play dumb with me...

not to get caught doing it.

How are you this stupid?

person behind it all.

According to you, Yukimura

has to be one of those two.

Wait a sec.

I've had some dealings
with Ayanokoji

and I don't think he's
that kind of person.

He is suspicious.

It seems almost too obvious.

317
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:16,240
We'll be going over
the Paper Shuffle, right?

318
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:17,700
Not yet.

319
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:21,750
We have a more immediate
concern: next week's mini test.

320
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:24,500
[AYANOKOJI] Let's see how
Horikita does on her own.

321
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:26,590
Since it won't
affect our grades,

322
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,630
what's the point of it?

323
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:33,350
The only explanation is that
it'll determine the pairings.

324
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:36,640
Remember what
Ms. Chabashira said?

325
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,480
...a pair or two gets
expelled during this exam.

326
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:43,730
It would be a shame if you
broke our streak with this.

327
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:45,940
[SUZUNE] Doesn't that
number seem a little low?

328
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,280
If the bottom students of each
class were grouped together,

329
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,400
you'd have dozens of people
dropping out each year.

330
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,160
[gasps] That's right!

331
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,740
Good point! That explains it.

332
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:59,660
The point of the test is
to create balanced pairs!

333
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,000
Yeah.

334
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,750
The teacher also said we'd
be ranked by our scores.

335
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:04,920
If they put the highest

336
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,920
and the lowest ranking
students together,

337
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,130
it'd ensure everyone got roughly
the same average score.

338
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:12,170
[KARUIZAWA]
That makes sense!

339
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,470
That means our goal for
this test is to pair up

340
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:17,180
highest and lowest
scoring students.

341
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,180
We'll start by splitting
everyone in Class D

342
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:22,480
into four different groups based
on their academic standing.

343
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,560
And then we'll coordinate with
the lowest group and make sure

344
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,940
that they all leave
their test sheets blank.

345
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,480
Oh, that's smart!

346
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:32,950
That way, they'll definitely get
paired with the top scorers.

347
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,990
Right. In the same vein,

348
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,240
everyone in the
second-lowest block

349
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:40,040
will only try to get
one question right.

350
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,330
[HIRATA]
I see.

351
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,960
That'll reduce the chance
of making a weak pair!

352
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,210
Are you still
keeping up, Sudo?

353
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:48,000
Not even a little bit, man.

354
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:50,260
Just smiling and
nodding over here.

355
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,420
Come on!

356
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,010
It's pretty simple
if you think about it!

357
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,590
[KEN]
Shaddap! Nobody asked you!

358
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:00,890
[STUDENTS laugh]

359
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:03,390
That's it for my proposal.

360
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,690
Besides, we still need
to make a decision

361
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,570
on which class we should
have answer our questions.

362
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,610
If we're talking academics.

363
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:13,570
It might be best to
avoid Classes A and B.

364
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,320
Which only leaves us one choice.

365
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,410
Yes, Class C will
be our best bet.

366
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:40,350
[phone rings]

367
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:45,270
[gasps]

368
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,980
[AYANOKOJI] I told you to only
contact me in case of emergency.

369
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,690
[KARUIZAWA] Come on,
what's the harm in talking?

370
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,740
Anyway, I just wanna know what
you said to Sato earlier!

371
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,280
[AYANOKOJI]
Really, this again?

372
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,620
I don't see why it would matter
at all to you what I told her.

373
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,040
Huh! What are you
even going on about?

374
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,240
You were blackmailing me

375
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:06,620
and then made me do
a bunch of weird stuff!

376
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:09,460
Also, if Sato finds
out about it,

377
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,300
then it's only a matter of
time before it gets around!

378
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,130
[AYANOKOJI]
I see.

379
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,510
I think I know what
you're getting at.

380
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,920
[laughs]

381
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:19,260
[AYANOKOJI] You're worried that,
if I get close with her,

382
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,680
I might get
distracted and forget

383
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,060
about my promise to
protect you, right?

384
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,140
[KARUIZAWA]
You think I care about that?

385
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,560
Am I wrong?

386
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,980
[KARUIZAWA] Not exactly,
but there's more to it!

387
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,190
I promise you,
that won't happen.

388
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,980
[KARUIZAWA] So, are you
going out or what?

389
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:36,150
[AYANOKOJI]
Huh. I didn't say we were.

390
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,950
[KARUIZAWA]
Yeah, but you didn't have to!

391
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:42,950
Honestly, all you boys
are exactly the same!

392
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,910
You've shown your true colors.

393
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:47,620
Anything to get in
a girl's pants, huh?

394
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,670
[AYANOKOJI]
Where's this coming from?

395
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,420
That's a tremendous
leap in logic.

396
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,920
Is it?

397
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,420
That was the first thing you
did when you blackmailed me!

398
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,880
[AYANOKOJI]
I see.

399
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,880
If I'm the kind of person
you're accusing me of being,

400
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:01,800
what does that
mean for Horikita?

401
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:04,850
Yeah right, you wish!
Horikita would never!

402
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,310
[AYANOKOJI] By the way, Sato
didn't actually ask me out.

403
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:09,640
Uh--

404
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:12,310
She just asked if we could
exchange phone numbers.

405
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,770
There wasn't anything
more to it than that.

406
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,070
[KARUIZAWA]
Oh. Was that really it?

407
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,650
Do you see now why I
told you it didn't matter?

408
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,740
[KARUIZAWA] You say that,
but I bet you secretly hope

409
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,790
you'll get paired up with her
during the special exam!

410
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,580
[AYANOKOJI]
Absolutely not.

411
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:31,460
Well, I guess I'll let you off
the hook just this one time!

412
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,710
[AYANOKOJI]
Wow, how gracious of you.

413
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:38,010
Whatever. Anyway,
that's all I wanted.

414
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:39,420
'Kay, bye!

415
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:42,510
[AYANOKOJI] Hold on a sec,
I wanna ask you something.

416
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,350
What's up?

417
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,470
[AYANOKOJI]
Those girls.

418
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,220
They haven't bothered you
since then, right?

419
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:51,230
Not yet. They just ignore me.

420
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:55,400
[AYANOKOJI] If they do, make
sure you come to me right away.

421
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,280
No matter what happens,
I swear I'll protect you.

422
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:05,910
You'd better!

423
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,450
I just mean,
those were the terms

424
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:10,120
of our agreement after all!

425
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,250
[AYANOKOJI] One more thing,
make sure you that you delete--

426
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:15,250
...all my call history.
I already know!

427
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:18,340
[AYANOKOJI]
Perfect, thanks. See ya.

428
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:26,300
[KARUIZAWA]
Ugh.

429
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:33,560
[AYANOKOJI] The next day,
Horikita explained the details

430
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,440
of her plan to everyone
else in the class.

431
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,150
They seemed pretty convinced
by her presentation,

432
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:43,700
and they all agreed
to go along with it.

433
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:48,200
In the 1960s, a Swiss zoologist
named Adolf Portmann

434
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:53,290
proposed the theory that all
humans were born premature.

435
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:56,080
Naturally, a newborn
can't walk on its own.

436
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:58,590
It has to learn
by trying and failing.

437
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,550
Horikita is the same way.

438
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:03,840
But that same
underdeveloped nature

439
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,100
doubles as the capacity
for infinite potential.

440
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,480
[AYANOKOJI] This was the
first time that Class D

441
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,640
was completely unified.

442
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:24,610
[AYANOKOJI] It seems leaving it
to her was the right choice.

443
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,360
[CHABASHIRA]
The tests have been graded.

444
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:29,450
I will now announce the
pairs for the Paper Shuffle.

445
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,710
Go, Ken!

446
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:46,010
[AYANOKOJI]
Oh, brother.
