1
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,450
Hey, wait!

2
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,200
What do you want?

3
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,830
If you pull out of the festival,

4
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,200
Class D won't have
any chance of winning.

5
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:41,540
Me coming back
won't change anything!

6
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:42,630
Right.

7
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,670
After everything I did
for those jerks.

8
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,010
Sudo, I've seen first-hand

9
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,550
how seriously you've
been taking this.

10
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:54,220
But still, you aren't
blameless either!

11
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,260
If you're just here
to lecture me, Horikita,

12
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:57,470
I think I'll pass.

13
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,480
I don't really want
to hear it right now.

14
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,520
You're too old
to throw tantrums.

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,110
How do you expect to succeed
with this kind of attitude?

16
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,230
[KEN grunts]
Just shut it!

17
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,280
See? This is exactly
what I'm talking about!

18
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,240
Great, another lecture.

19
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:47,830
[KEN] Give it a rest, already!
I'm sick of everyone riding me!

20
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,420
It's all their fault!

21
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,840
With me in charge, winning this
sports festival should be easy!

22
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,340
But I'm stuck with this class!

23
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,760
They're dead weight,
and all they're doing

24
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,010
is keeping me
from crushing it!

25
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,720
You're upset that we're losing
in a test you excel in.

26
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,520
That much is clear,
but that's not all.

27
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:10,650
I wanted to show off, I guess.
Get some respect, you know?

28
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:14,400
I needed to prove to them
that I deserved to be here.

29
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,490
Just picturing the looks
on everyone's faces

30
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:21,910
who talked smack to me.
I'm pathetic.

31
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:25,410
Growing up, I was always
the kid from the trash family.

32
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,540
I told myself that
I'd be different.

33
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,420
But every day, I see
more of 'em in me.

34
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,670
[SUZUNE] You shouldn't
think of it in that way.

35
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,260
It's not their fault.

36
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,800
You can't blame others
for who you are.

37
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,510
You have to decide
that for yourself.

38
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,100
Life would be so different
if we simply inherited

39
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,190
the qualities of our family.

40
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,940
What's that supposed to mean?

41
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,190
[SUZUNE]
Your future isn't set in stone.

42
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,820
You can always choose
what you want to be.

43
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,030
Huh.

44
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,320
It pains me to admit,
but you're talented

45
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,030
when it comes to sports.

46
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,950
However, at the moment,
you're worthless.

47
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,080
Even now, you're
trying to run away.

48
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,710
If you refuse to help us
win the festival,

49
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,830
you'll only be proving that

50
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,090
you really are trash
like your parents.

51
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,460
Well, that's perfectly
fine by me!

52
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,550
I couldn't care less
about that crap anymore.

53
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,880
[ANNOUNCER 205AA]
Attention students,

54
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,050
the lunch break
will end soon.

55
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:23,600
All competitors, please
assemble on the field.

56
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,850
You better get out there.

57
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:30,390
No, not until you agree
to come back with me.

58
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,980
I'll be waiting right here.

59
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,820
Whatever.

60
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,870
Real quick. Could you
tie our legs together?

61
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:50,540
[KIKYO] Mm-hm! You know,
it's kinda hard to believe.

62
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,130
Horikita actually chasing
after Sudo like that!

63
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,380
Kushida.

64
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,590
Just a sec! I'm almost
done tying the knot--

65
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,840
[AYANOKOJI]
It's you, isn't it?

66
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,590
You're the person
who betrayed our class

67
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,800
by sharing our submission
form with Class C.

68
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,260
[KIKYO] I don't have a clue
what you're talking about!

69
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,930
Where's this coming from?

70
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,190
I didn't know you
liked telling jokes!

71
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,940
It isn't. I saw
you taking pictures

72
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,650
of our class's
submission form.

73
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:18,530
I just wanted to make sure
I didn't forget my events!

74
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,780
We were told not
to take pictures.

75
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,910
Oh, really? Whoops,
I totally forgot!

76
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,990
Sorry!

77
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,790
Hope that doesn't
make me a suspect!

78
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,410
But that's not the only reason.

79
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,830
What's been happening
would only be possible

80
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,380
if someone leaked
information to Class C.

81
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,090
Hey, Ayanokoji.

82
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,430
Let's say that you're right
and I was the person

83
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,760
who shared our class's
submission form.

84
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,970
If you knew I was going
to betray everyone,

85
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:51,140
then why didn't you do anything?
Instead, you just let it happen.

86
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,480
Isn't that right?

87
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,020
You could've changed
the roster, but you didn't.

88
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,560
What's the point?

89
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,400
As long as a traitor existed
in Class D, it wouldn't matter.

90
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,030
What do you mean?

91
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,860
Even if we made changes,

92
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,450
anyone could've checked the form
and it would've tipped off

93
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,660
the traitor we were onto them.

94
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,410
But why couldn't you have
just kept the roster secret?

95
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,250
And then turn it in
at the last second?

96
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:16,170
That way, if someone wanted to
leak it to the other classes,

97
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,170
it would be too late.

98
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,550
Ah, although, if we did that,

99
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:25,050
it'd just make things
super confusing for us, too.

100
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,590
I get it now.

101
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,220
But I'm still not the
traitor, you're talking--

102
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,390
[AYANOKOJI] If I asked the
teacher who checked the roster,

103
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,810
I have a feeling your
name would come up.

104
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,810
If that's the case, why would
you come see it again

105
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:39,230
if you had a picture?

106
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:42,320
[KIKYO giggles]
Color me impressed, Ayanokoji.

107
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,150
You're really something!

108
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,620
I guess there's no point
in hiding it now.

109
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,070
You're right!

110
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,120
I'm the one who leaked our
submission form to Class C!

111
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,540
So, it was you.

112
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,500
[KIKYO] Mm-hm! Well,
it doesn't matter if you know,

113
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,040
'cause you can't
tell anyone about it!

114
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:01,170
Don't you forget!
I have that uniform!

115
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,970
I know my hands are tied.

116
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,930
I wasn't looking to expose
you as the culprit.

117
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,060
I was just checking.

118
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,680
[KIKYO giggles]

119
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,520
[AYANOKOJI]
This wasn't the first time.

120
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,270
Class C took first place
in the last exam because

121
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:21,610
you told Ryuen that you
were the VIP, didn't you?

122
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,610
If I had to guess, he promised
you a favor in exchange.

123
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:25,690
[KIKYO]
My goodness!

124
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,610
It sounds like
you know everything!

125
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,160
Have you figured out the reason
why I'd betray our class then?

126
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,330
I imagine that it has
to do with whatever grudge

127
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,460
you hold against Horikita.

128
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,790
[KIKYO giggles]
Mm-hm! Amazing!

129
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,090
You really did get to the
bottom of it, Ayanokoji!

130
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,590
It's true!

131
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:48,220
More than anything, I want
Suzune Horikita to be expelled.

132
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,600
[AYANOKOJI] Although,
I still don't quite understand

133
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,430
your reasoning for all this.

134
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,970
Why do you hate her so much?

135
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,350
[KIKYO]
It doesn't matter.

136
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,350
I'll make sure that
she gets kicked out

137
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,730
and there's nothing you
can do to change my mind.

138
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,270
[AYANOKOJI]
It's that important?

139
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,900
So much that you'd sell out
your own class for it?

140
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,440
[KIKYO]
Absolutely!

141
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:10,700
I don't really care if
I make it to Class A or not!

142
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,240
The only thing I want is
for Horikita to be expelled

143
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,450
before the year is over!

144
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,660
[AYANOKOJI]
I see.

145
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,460
[KIKYO] Don't get me wrong!
I'm not against moving up!

146
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,080
Once she's been kicked
out of the school,

147
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,800
I'd be more than happy to help
everyone reach Class A.

148
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,800
I think that would be kinda fun!

149
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,800
I'm looking forward to it, now!

150
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,470
Oh, actually,
I just changed my mind

151
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,550
about one part of that plan.

152
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,760
How about...

153
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,390
Since you like her so much,

154
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,730
I'll make sure you get
expelled with Horikita!

155
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,520
That way, I won't have
to look at your face again!

156
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,820
And once the two of you
are out of my life,

157
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,320
I can work with everyone
to get to Class A!

158
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,160
I can't believe you
actually stayed here.

159

'Course.

160
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,370
Hold on, Sudo!
Where are you going?

161
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,290
[KEN]
Back to my room, where else?

162
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:04,960
Wait! Over the past hour,
I've been thinking.

163
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,050
About what kind of person I am

164
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,260
and what you told me
about yourself.

165
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:13,970
I realized we aren't so
different from each other.

166
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,930
Don't make me laugh.
We're nothin' alike.

167
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,560
You've met the student
council president, right?

168
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,690
Oh, That stuck-up bastard?

169
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,440
Yeah, he's my older brother.

170
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,690
Despite that,
he goes out of his way

171
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:31,150
to pretend that I don't exist.

172
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,030
I disappoint him. And
because of my incompetence,

173
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,870
my perfect brother hates being
associated with me in any way.

174
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,960
[KEN]
Like I'd believe that bull.

175
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,040
You're talented and smart.

176
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:47,630
That may be so, but I can't
hold a candle to him.

177
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,380
[SUZUNE]
All my life, I've chased him.

178
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:56,930
Doing everything in my power
to try to catch up.

179
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,970
And because of that...

180
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:07,190
[SUZUNE]
...I was always alone.

181
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,650
I believed that I didn't matter.

182
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,900
I thought, if I proved myself,

183
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:17,280
my brother would eventually
see my worth and accept me.

184
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,870
I'm exactly like you.

185
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,790
I wanted to use this
festival to show off.

186
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,040
I was holding onto
some vague hope

187
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,840
that if I could just do well
enough, he'd be proud of me.

188
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,260
I thought I was above
everyone else in our class.

189
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,470
I realize how wrong I was.

190
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,350
I'm not special or exceptional.

191
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,560
I became someone I didn't like.

192
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,180
I can't do this alone.

193
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,770
Working with our team
was the first time

194
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,940
I felt like I could accomplish
something worthwhile.

195
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,020
I'll never give up,
no matter what.

196
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:50,110
I'll earn my brother's
acknowledgement.

197
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,990
I'll work hard to become
someone I can be proud of.

198
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,950
And if on the way, it looks like
you're straying from the path,

199
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,410
I'll do whatever it takes
to bring you back.

200
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:03,080
I won't let you run away again.

201
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,330
You're the only one
who understands me.

202
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,670
Please, help me lead
our class forward.

203
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:12,170
Trust me, you can become so much
more than what people assume.

204
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,630
My entire life,
I've heard that kind of

205
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,180
sentimental junk nonstop.

206
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,560
But somehow, when it's
coming from you,

207
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,180
a part of me wants
to believe it.

208
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:27,270
So, Ken Sudo. I'll ask again.

209
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,690
Will you help class D win?

210

Horikita.

211
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,940
Ugh. Damn it!

212
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,860
All right, you've convinced me!

213
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,320
I don't know what your plan is,

214
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,450
but I've got the feeling
that going along with you

215
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:41,580
is the right choice!

216
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,080
I'll be the person
you think I can be!

217

[STUDETS gasp]

219
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,300
[KEN] I'm sorry for losing my
temper and taking it out on you.

220
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,470
This is my fault.

221
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,850
I deserve all the blame

222
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,430
for the position our
class is in right now.

223
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,930
We're just glad you're back.

224
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,100
This is the last event!

225
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,190
So, let's give it
everything we've got!

226
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,690
Let's end this festival
with a bang!

227
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:12,980
I think I'm going
to need someone

228
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:15,360
to stand in for me
during the race.

229
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,820
I'm afraid I won't able to do
very much with my leg like this.

230
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,200
Yeah, that's true.

231
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,700
Hey, Kushida.
Would you mind going?

232
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,080
Sure, no problem!

233
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,000
Sorry to spring
this on everyone.

234
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,580
But I think I'll have
to sit this one out, too.

235
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,920
You see, I twisted my ankle

236
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,090
during the 200-meter dash
earlier this morning.

237
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:37,050
I thought it might feel
better if I rested it,

238
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,340
but it still hurts.

239
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,880
That's not good.

240
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,970
It sounds like we'll need to
make a last minute substitution

241
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,560
for the boy's team.

242
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,980
It's fine. I can
run in his place.

[STUDENTS cheering]

246
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:21,130
From what I observed
earlier in the festival,

247
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,600
I assumed your class
was beyond salvation.

248
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,640
Although, that no longer
seems to be the case.

What happened?

[AYANOKOJI]
They found themselves

251

someone to rally behind.

252
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,230
You can thank
your sister for that.

I see.

That's right.

Didn't you want to see
what kind of person I am?

259
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,290
I could show you.

If you are interested,

to indulge you with a race.

00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,380
I have to do better.

315
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,170
Although, I feel like
this sports festival

316
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,340
was the key to
helping me grow.

317
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:51,890
Ugh, just listen to me.

318
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,640
Going on about
something as sappy as

319
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,850
"learning from my mistakes."

320
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:59,480
If it makes you a better person,
then is it really that bad?

321
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,690
This class will become stronger.

322
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,650
I know, eventually,
we'll get to Class A.

323
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,360
Oh.

324
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,610
What's wrong?

325
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,490
I never thought you'd
say something like that;

326
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,240
it gave me goosebumps.

327
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,040
Me neither. It's not
like me at all.

328
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,370
Right. This isn't
going to be easy.

329
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,790
There are gonna be
plenty of problems

330
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:22,290
that we'll have to deal with.

331
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,500
Problems?

332
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:26,590
We'll just have to take
things as they come.

333
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,170
Thanks for today.

334
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:49,030
Wow. Look who decided
to come after all!

335
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,610
Suzune.

336
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,450
[SUZUNE]
If I turned tail and ran,

337
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,160
I don't think I could ever
forgive myself for it.

338
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,040
Let's get this over with.

339
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,040
I like the fight in your eyes!

340
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,660
Feeling nice and
confident now, are we?

341
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,420
There's just one thing
I wanna deal with first.

342
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,920
How long are you gonna
keep up that act?

343
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:11,840
Huh? What are you talking about?

344
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,880
[SUZUNE] You can stop
playing dumb already.

345
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,680
You're who betrayed our class.

346
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,430
That's why Class C had such
an easy time beating us.

347
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,100
In exchange, you had
Ryuen help you.

348
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,600
I hope whatever you
got was worth it.

349
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,310
Traitor.

350
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,650
My goodness!

351
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,820
Someone from our class
must've spilled the beans!

352
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,700
Hirata? Ayanokoji?

353
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,740
[SUZUNE]
I don't get it.

354
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,990
We're the only ones
here right now.

355
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,660
Why don't you quit
pretending already?

356
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:41,580
Pretending?
Whatever do you mean?

357
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,670
I actually didn't recognize
you when we first met.

358
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,710
However, the more I saw you,

359
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,250
the more you
reminded me of someone

360
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,260
I went to middle school with.

361
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,390
That's right, though
I was a bit more

362
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,600
of a problem child back then.

363
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,430
And since you've managed
to piece together

364
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,100
that much by yourself,

365
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:07,860
I imagine you've figured out
what I'm really after, then.

366
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,400
That much is obvious.

367
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,690
Your goal is to try to get me
expelled from the school.

368
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,400
But you have to be careful
with how you do it,

369
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,610
because I know your secret.

370
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,120
Right on the money.

371
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,830
However, I don't think
I have to remind you

372
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,660
that if you tell even
a single soul about me,

373
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,660
then everything
will come to light.

374
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,210
And if that happens,

375
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:32,010
you won't be able to keep your
precious big brother out of it.

376
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:34,550
Why take the risk when
you could just ignore me?

377
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:37,380
You know I don't pry into
matters that don't concern me.

378
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,850
I don't get it.

379
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:41,310
In order for me to truly
become the person I want to be,

380
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,850
I can't take any chances.

381
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,640
I need to get rid of anyone
who knows about my past.

382
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:46,850
Oh, really?

383
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:50,150
Tell me, that list
includes me, doesn't it?

384
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,610
Maybe one day, you never know!

385
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,820
I'd like to see you try.

386
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,490
[KIKYO] I'm glad I can tell
you this to your face.

387
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:02,450
You're going to get expelled,
and It'll be because of me.

388
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,790
I'd even make a deal
with the devil, himself.

389
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,120
You heard her.

390
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,830
[SUZUNE]
I see.

391
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,880
You got the better
of me this time.

392
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,710
And what about
the sports festival?

393
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,300
Did you plan that out, too?

394
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,510
It's gotta be all
about you, huh?

395
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,510
But let's say that you're right.

396
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,010
I'd be more than
happy to indulge

397
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,640
in your little fantasy story.

398
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,680
Here it is.

399
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,810
Before the festival even began,
I had Kikyo here

400
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:32,070
take a picture of Class D's
roster and send it to me.

401
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:35,150
Afterwards, I based my
class's roster around it.

402
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,950
Ensuring that we had the
best matchups against you.

403
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,070
I'll admit that was
a brilliant move.

404
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,830
But you got lucky, too.

405
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,410
[RYUEN]
What luck?

406
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:46,120
The fact that I got taken out
of the festival due to my leg.

407
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,080
Not to mention Kinoshita
getting injured that badly.

408
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,340
There's no way you planned
for both of those to happen.

409
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,800
[RYUEN] Don't tell me
you seriously think

410
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,510
that was just coincidence.

411
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,920
[SUZUNE]
But how?

412
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:00,680
[chuckles] It's true, she
really did trip and fall.

413
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,390
But a tumble like that's
only gonna give you

414
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,350
some scrapes and bruises.

415
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,890
That's why I had her act
like she was badly hurt.

416
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:12,110
Then afterwards, I made sure she
didn't have to pretend anymore.

417
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:15,360
I made it worth her while.

418
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,530
I see. Got it.

419
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,740
By the way, I've been
recording all of this.

420
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,950
This plan of yours
ends here and now.

421
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,200
If you try to blackmail me
or go to the student council,

422
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:31,370
I'll just let them listen to
what you have to say about it.

423
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:34,920
Heh. You never cease
to entertain me

424
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,380
with your little schemes,
Suzune. It's so cute.

425
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,720
But I already told you
at the start.

426
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,140
All of that just now,
was a hypothetical scenario.

427
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,510
Of course, I was
only playing along.

428
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,640
I can always cut around that
and only keep in the parts

429
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,270
where you talk about
your plan, you know.

430
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:54,230
I guess you could do that.
I'll just give them this.

431
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,650
[gasps]

432
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:56,860
It's funny.

433
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,030
I've been recording
our conversation, too.

434
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,110
[sighs]

435
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:05,870
Time for you to grovel, Suzune.

436
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:12,250
[inhales, sighs] Very well.

437
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,720
Ugh.

438
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:41,240
[RYUEN chuckles] Well now,
isn't that interesting?

439
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,030
[RYUEN]
Hey, Suzune.

440
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:45,370
I gotta hand it to you,
whoever's pulling your strings

441
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:47,580
is truly something special.

442
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,790
They planned this whole thing
out from the very beginning,

443
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,620
and we've been
dancing to their tune.

444
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,580
[RYUEN] If we wanna
crush Suzune Horikita

445
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,130
and the rest of Class D,

446
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,550
I've come up with the
perfect plan to trap her.

447
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:03,050
And it's practically fool proof.

448
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,930
The first part of
the plan is to put you

449
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,970
in the obstacle course
event with her.

450
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:10,060
Do whatever it takes
to bring her to the ground.

451
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,430
After that, I'll injure you
for real, she'll think

452
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,850
she hurt you, and then
we'll blackmail her.

453
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,110
Where did they get that?

454
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:20,820
It looks like Class C
has a traitor, too.

455
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,110
[KIKYO gasps]

456
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:24,400
[RYUEN]
They played us for fools, Kikyo.

457
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:26,360
Anticipating our every move,

458
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:30,490
even accounting
for your betrayal.

459
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,540
[RYUEN] Not many people could've
successfully pulled this off.

460
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,620
I swear, no matter where
they run or try to hide,

461
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:41,380
I'll find them.

462
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,970
[RYUEN] Suzune, you're off
the hook, for now.
