1
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,570
To tell you the truth,

2
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,740
the real reason I called you
was so that I could apologize.

3
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,070
[KARUIZAWA]
Apologize?

4
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:30,410
Yes.

5
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,200
It's my fault that you've
now a potential target.

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,160
[KARUIZAWA] Huh? Where's
all this coming from?

7
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:38,790
[AYANOKOJI]
Things have changed.

8
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,330
There's no need for me
to try to bring up

9
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,420
Class D's standing anymore.

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,880
What was motivating me
before is gone.

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,300
[KARUIZAWA]
I see.

12
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,970
So you're gonna go back
to laying low from now on?

13
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,930
Yeah. I'll leave it
up to Horikita and Hirata

14
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,760
to take care of everything.

15
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,970
[KARUIZAWA]
Makes sense.

16
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,270
Well, this means you're
free now, doesn't it?

17
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,190
[AYANOKOJI]
I guess it does.

18
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,900
Although, there's something
you should know.

19
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,990
I won't be contacting
you again.

20
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,910

21

[STUDENTS chattering]

22
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,700
Good morning.

23
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,870
Hey.

24
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,750
[MIYAKE] Yeah, but I got
club stuff to do.

25
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,200
[MIYAKE]
Sup, Kiyotaka!

26
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:21,540
[AYANOKOJI]
Morning.

27
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,880
[MIYAKE]
As chipper as ever, I see.

28
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,210
[AYANOKOJI]
Sorry. Not a morning person.

29
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,720
[SUZUNE] So, what was it that
you wanted to propose?

30
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:01,850
I was thinking, what if we make

31
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,220
the study groups
an ongoing thing--

32
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,430
[slam]

33
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,360
[IKE]
Guys, look!

34
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,360
You assholes lost?
Get the hell outa here!

35
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,860
Hey, Ryuen. What are
you doing here?

36
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,650
Since when do I need
any special reason

37
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,570
to pay a little visit to
my neighbors in Class D?

38
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,370
You all can relax now.
I don't bite often!

39
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,500
Wouldn't be a
big deal elsewhere,

40
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,040
but this school is different.

41
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,750
Since we have to compete
against the other classes.

42
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,960
And here I was thinking
we could start being friends.

43
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,880
It's time.

44
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,850
Y'see that?

45
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,140
Is it just me, or does it look
like they're up to something?

46
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,890
--Wanna check it out?
--[YAMAUCHI] No way!

47
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,520
You don't think they're gonna
try to mess with Koenji, do you?

48
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,270
Class C's gone crazy!
This is bad.

49
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,400
Agreed.

50
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,690
Hey, so...

51
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,690
Do you think we should
go after them?

52
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,030
Like, with as many
people as possible.

53
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,660
You know, just in case they
try something nefarious?

54
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,080
Probably.

55
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,370
Having cameras around wouldn't
be enough to stop Ryuen.

56
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,540
[YUKIMURA]
I'll go, too!

57
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,000
You're right, a few of us
won't be enough.

58
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,920
[AYANOKOJI] I think it might
be best if you stay here

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,670
to hold down the fort.

60
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,510
If Ike and Yamauchi
come along,

61
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,840
they'll only escalate
the situation.

62
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,090
You can keep them here
and make sure

63
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,050
they don't do something stupid.

64
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,760
That's a good point.
All right, then.

65
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,930
If anything happens,
safety first.

66
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,820
Hey! What are you doing?

67
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,360
What's this? We've got
ourselves an audience.

68
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,450
Well, it doesn't matter.

69
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:47,700
As you can all plainly see,
we haven't done anything.

70
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,750
I'm curious what you're after.

71
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,750
Forgive me, but I don't
recall ever conducting

72
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,080
any business with Class C.

73
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,840
Well, I wanted to talk to you.

74
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,590
The "weirdo."

75
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,630
'Scuse me?

76

You're not referring
to me, are you?

00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,220
[RYUEN] Who else would
I be talking about?

78
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,720
You don't have high
opinion of me, it seems.

79
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,350
I'll pretend I didn't
hear your slander!

80
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,890
A sign of my magnanimity.

81
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,520
In case you didn't know,

82
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:16,860
I've got a big date
I've gotta get ready for!

83
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,820
So, I'd appreciate it
if you kept this brief.

84

[whistle]

85
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,320
It's too bad, but you're
gonna have to delay

86
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,870
those plans of yours.

87
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,200
[KOENJI]
Huh?

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,670
[KOENJI] How terribly lowbrow!
What've you done?

89
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,380
Do you know how much
this mirror cost me?

90
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,510
Sorry. But accidents happen.

91
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,760
That's enough! Stop this!

92
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,260
Just pipe down, there, Suzune.

93
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,760
Right now, I'm playing
a game with Koenji.

94
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,520
I thought I heard
something brewing.

95
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,100
But I certainly
did not anticipate

96
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,770
seeing all of you here!

97
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,440
Hey, Sakayangi.

98
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,650
Seems to me that you came here
right in the nick of time.

99
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,150
Just a coincidence.
I happened to be passing by.

100
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,530
As if I'd believe that.

101
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,570
But now that I'm here,

102
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,200
I'm curious what
you were discussing.

103
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,910
Christmas plans, perhaps?

104
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:13,750
That's enough from you.
Your turn will come, just wait.

105
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,670
[SAKAYANAGI] Oh, come on,
after I came all this way?

106
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,340
There's no harm in letting me
join in on the fun, is there?

107
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,550
[RYUEN]
Fine, you can stay if you want.

108
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:25,010
Just don't interrupt.

109
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,720
[KOENJI] Not that I mind
having a larger audience.

110
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,680
But you still haven't said
why you've stopped me.

111
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,940
I'm a very busy man.
Please, don't waste my time.

112
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,640
Sorry about that.

113
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,690
Let's get down to brass tacks.

114
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,980
Though, I can already
guess what it is.

115
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,940
It seems that
somebody from Class D

116
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,700
has been interfering
with your plans of late.

117
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,490
And you're trying
to find out the identity

118
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,950
of this mysterious mastermind.

119
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,040
That's exactly right.

120
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,540
[KOENJI]
In that case, I can assure you

121
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,750
I'm not the person you're after.

122
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,000
Truth be told,
I couldn't care less

123
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,050
where any of the classes
ultimately end up.

124
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,210
Up to this point,
I haven't put any effort

125
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,800
into clearing these
so-called special exams.

126
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,430
Nor do I ever intend to.

127
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:12,850
So, what could you possibly
gain from confronting me?

128
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,730
Thing is, your story
doesn't quite add up.

129
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,940
What about the VIP
test on the ship?

130
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,190
Doesn't fit your narrative.

131
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,230
I know what you did back there.

132
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,320
I was just killing time.

133
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,780
Plus, turning in the answer
early had the added benefit

134
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,660
of freeing me from those
insufferable get-togethers.

135
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,080
[RYUEN] Well, sure, you say
that, but how can I be sure

136
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,790
you haven't participated
in any of the other exams?

137
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,380
What's more, that little stunt
you pulled on the cruise ship

138
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,080
only proves that you're
more than qualified

139
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:42,880
to take control of Class D.

140
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,130
Correct?

141
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,590
I'd be inclined to agree!

142
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,760
Although, if that's all
it took to convince you

143
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,680
that I'm who you're looking for,

144
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,970
I must say, you're only
demonstrating the limits

145
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,850
of your mental capacity.

146
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,430
Moronic.

147
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,980
That's how I would describe
your thought process.

148
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,810
I suppose that's fair.

149
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,360
And if everything you've
just told me is the truth,

150
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,360
that would make you
entirely irrelevant

151
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,280
to my investigation, then.

152
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,740
Exactly! I do
appreciate the fact

153
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,660
that you're quick on the
uptake, my dear Dragon Boy.

154
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,160
[SAKAYANAGI giggles]

155
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,540
Hold on, a thought
just occurred to me.

156
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,670
What if I decided to just
force the truth out of you?

157
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,750
There you go again with
your nonsensical ideas.

158
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,300
You wouldn't do that, not with
all these witnesses nearby.

159
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,760
That's where you're wrong.

160
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,840
You see, I'm capable
of doing anything,

161
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,930
even if you have witnesses.
I truly couldn't care less.

162
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,350
All right, then.

163
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:38,390
Since you're so insistent,

164
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,980
let's say, for the
sake of argument,

165
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,020
you decided to use brute force.

166
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,690
I'd have no choice but
to defend not only myself,

167
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,150
but my pride as well.

168
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,490
Suffice it to say, I can't
guarantee the safety

169
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,990
of anyone who comes after me.

170
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,990
[RYUEN] You really think
you can beat me all alone?

171
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,620
[KOENJI]
But of course, I can't imagine

172
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,330
any reason why I couldn't.

173
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,210
[RYUEN]
I see.

174
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,750
The way that brain of yours
thinks is completely insane!

175
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,670
But I'll believe your story.

176
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:10,510
I'm glad to have this
misunderstanding sorted out.

177
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,930
[RYUEN]
Just tell me one thing, Koenji.

178
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,470
If it's not you, then who is it?

179
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,890
You'd tell me if your
class's mastermind was among

180
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,770
the crowd here, wouldn't you?

181
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,230
[KOENJI] I wouldn't dare dream
of depriving you of your fun.

182
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,650
[SAKAYANAGI]
So that was what this was about?

183
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,360
A little birdie told me that
our dear Dragon Boy here

184
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,740
was tearing his hair out
looking for a particularly

185
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,830
clever member of Class D.

186
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,160
I guess it was true af--

187
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,790
I already told you to keep
out of this, Sakayanagi.

188
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,080
And another thing. If you ever
try to call me that again,

189
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,790
I'll kill you.

190
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,790
Don't tell me you're
embarrassed by it!

191
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,880
If you ask me, I think it's
a lovely nickname for you.

192
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,720
Dear Dragon Boy.

193
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:04,440
Oh, my goodness,
did that upset you?

194
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,150
I tried to tell you
what would happen.

195
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,440
Seems you need to get
your ears checked.

196
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,780
What are you doing?
You just attacked someone!

197
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,200
Are you insane?

198
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,700
Hashimoto, did someone
attack you? Tell us!

199
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:21,330
Oh. No. I just accidentally
tripped and fell.

200
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,660
[SAKAYANAGI]
And there you have it!

201
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,170
Everything's okay!

202
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,090
You're just as crazy as he is!

203
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:28,880
What's wrong with you?

204
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,460
[SAKAYANAGI]
I'm terribly sorry, Ryuen.

205
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,470
It's just a harmless joke.

206
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,470
[KOENJI humming]

207
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,350
There he goes.
You sure about this?

208
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,810
Trust me, if he was
the one I was looking for,

209
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,730
he wouldn't be going anywhere.

210
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:49,980
If you ask me, he's
acting pretty suspicious.

211
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,610
On top of that, he's almost
impossible to read.

212
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:53,950
How can you be sure
he wasn't lying

213
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,490
about not being the mastermind?

214
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:57,570
His thought process

215
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,910
is completely
incompatible with mine.

216
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,910
And from how he
treats his classmates,

217
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,370
do you really think he
would scheme with Suzune?

218
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,750
I agree, he doesn't seem
like that kind of person.

219
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,750
But then what was the
point of going after him

220
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,130
in the first place?

221
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,340
Hey.

222
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,630
I'm curious what you
think about Koenji.

223
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,470
Why the hell would we tell
you anything, you jerk wad?

224
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,260
Just get lost already!

225
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,730
Control your dog, Suzune.

226
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,020
What was that?

227
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,100
I'm warning you.

228
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,650
I have half a mind to
report this to the school.

229
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,020
Leave our class alone.

230
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,400
You can try.

231
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,900
But it's pointless since
I haven't broken any rules.

232
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:38,990
And after today, I can
take yet another name

233
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,910
off my list of suspects.

234
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:44,910
It's only a matter of time
before I find who's behind you.

235
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,210
I don't really care why you're
harassing Class D's students.

236
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,090
But it's time for you to stop.

237
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:53,670
From now on, I want you to stay
away from me and my classmates.

238
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,970
[RYUEN] What are you
gonna do if I say no?

239
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,260
Find some way to
make me back off?

240
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,300
I'd love to see you try.

241
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:03,680
But don't you worry,
we're already in the endgame.

242
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,310
I can't wait for you
to see the finale.

243
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,450
[AYANOKOJI] It looks like both
Ichinose and Sakayangi

244
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:19,740
have started to show
an interest in me.

245
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:23,120
As long as I'm careful, I should
be able to fade out of view.

246
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,500
But there's still
one obstacle left.

247
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,370
Ryuen.

248
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:38,260
After all that, he still
never tipped his hand.

249
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:42,010
My first little fox hunt ended
as a complete failure.

250
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,430
What's the point of this?
Let's just drop it.

251
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:49,100
[RYUEN] I refuse.
Not until I destroy him.

252
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,440
He managed to stay hidden today,

253
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,150
but he won't be able
to avoid me forever.

254
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:56,820
The hunt continues.

255
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,820
After the Paper Shuffle,

256
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,490
I assigned watchdogs
to keep tabs on specific

257
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:04,330
Class D students
who I deemed worthy.

258
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,660
Even though they just
watched, their presence

259
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,290
sowed unease and tension
through Class D.

260
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,040
After only two weeks,

261
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,170
I'm sure he's starting
to feel the pressure.

262
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,340
There're no signs
of cracking yet.

263
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,260
But I wonder how much longer
he can hide behind Suzune.

264
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,260
Why are you doing this?

265
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,760
I'm just enjoying myself.

266
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27,470
The truth is,
it makes my heart race.

267
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,770
This burning feeling in my chest
is like finding my first love.

268
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,750
So, are you gonna share

269
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,040
why you had us come
all the way out here?

270
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,670
[RYUEN]
You worried?

271
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,500
I like to know
what I'm getting into.

272
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,460
[RYUEN]
You'll find out soon enough.

273
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,800
I've called the bait here.

274
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,300
I've also sent an email
to the mastermind.

275
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,430
[IBUKI]
Do you really think he'll come?

276
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,720
Who's to say?

277
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:10,430
Worst-case scenario,
neither of them shows up.

278
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,940
Which would be entertaining
in its own way.

279
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,070
So, what's a "good scenario"?

280
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,820
[RYUEN]
To catch the mastermind.

281
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,030
Or...

282
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,200
...crush the bait if
he doesn't play along.

283
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,200
[IBUKI] Right, good luck
getting away with it

284
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,780
with all these security
cameras around.

285
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,910
[RYUEN]
That won't be a problem.

286
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,920
[spray can rattling]

287
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,840
[spray can hissing]

288
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,800
[IBUKI]
It's freezing!

289
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,350
Now we can conduct
our business in private.

290
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,480
But wait, won't you
get in trouble?

291
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,480
I'm just pulling
a harmless prank.

292
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,560
I'll get a slap on
the wrist at most.

293
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,820
Albert.

294
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,650
[RYUEN]
Take your position.

295
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,780
If the bait comes,
let it through.

296
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,870
If anyone unexpected shows up,
call me immediately.

297
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,450
[ISHIZAKI grunts]
That's heavy!

298
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:14,210
Hope you're right about this.
It'd suck if the bait no showed.

299
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,420
[RYUEN]
Or, she'll show.

300
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,090
The card I hold is far too
important for her to ignore.

301
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,130
Now, all that's left is to wait.

302
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,020
[RYUEN]
Are you alone?

303
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,940
[KARUIZAWA] Well, that's what
it said in your message, right?

304
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,730
Yeah, I came by myself,
just like you asked.

305
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,900
And what the heck
was that email about?

306
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:46,110
It didn't make any sense!

307
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,660
[RYUEN] Do I really need
to spell it out for you?

308
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,620
I don't know what Manabe and
those other girls said to you.

309
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,790
I have no clue what
you're talking about!

310
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,540
Then why didn't you
ignore my message?

311
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,250
Well, because...

312
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,500
...I just didn't want you to go
spreading a bunch of lies

313
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,590
and rumors about me.

314
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,170
[RYUEN]
Why should I believe you?

315
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,800
I'm telling you the truth!

316
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,300
Quit playing dumb.

317
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,640
Everyone here knows that,

318
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,100
before you reinvented
yourself for high school,

319
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:17,180
you were the victim
of constant bullying.

320
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:19,350
[KARUIZAWA]
No, you're wrong!

321
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,690
What are you doing?
Cut it out!

322
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:24,320
Stop--I said stop!

323
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,400
Let me go! Right now!

324
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,860
Hey, that hurts! Ow!

325
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,370
[KARUIZAWA]
What do you want from me?

326
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:37,540
I don't know anything,

327
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,960
so there's no point
in threatening me!

328
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,090
I'm just killing time.

329
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,960
If you don't let me
go this instant,

330
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,210
I'm reporting you all
to the school!

331
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,720
Sure. Go for it.

332
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,130
[gasps]

333
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,140
[RYUEN] But I don't think
you can afford to do that.

334
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,020
You wouldn't want everyone
to know the truth about you.

335
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,690
[RYUEN]
Karuizawa.

336
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,980
I'd like for you to tell me
the name of the person

337
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,480
who's pulling you
and Suzune's strings.

338
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:06,980
If you do that,

339
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:11,360
you can leave and I'll never
bring up your past again.

340
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:13,870
I still don't know where
this is coming from.

341
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:17,410
Class D's mastermind stopped
Manabe from bullying you.

342
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,870
He went out of his way
to save you.

343
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,420
What are you talking about?
I've never been bullied!

344
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,920
And I don't know anything
about this "mastermind"!

345
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,010
[RYUEN]
I have the video.

346
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:29,590
I had Manabe show it to me.

347
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,800
And according to her,
the mastermind used it

348
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,760
to make her leave you alone.

349
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:34,970
That's a lie!

350
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,310
[RYUEN]
Of course.

351
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:39,310
All that means you know
the mastermind's identity.

352
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,600
Who is it?

353
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,020
[RYUEN] All I want from you
is a name, Karuizawa.

354
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:49,320
I'm not really interested in
airing out your dirty laundry.

355
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,030
You can make this
easy on yourself.

356
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,870
No, I told you! But you're
not listening to me!

357
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,290
I don't know what
you're talking about!

358
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:00,540
I see, he must be someone
important to you.

359
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,460
Go ahead and keep asking me
the same questions!

360
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,460
My answer isn't gonna change!

361
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,670
Untie me already!
I'm freezing to death in here!

362
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,220
Well then, you've left me
with no other choice.

363
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,220
I'm going to tell every
single friend you've made

364
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,760
at this school the truth
about your past.

365
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:18,810
Is he worth losing all of that?

366
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:28,440
You're just bluffing.
Don't treat me like I'm stupid!

367
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:31,280
You think there's someone out
there pulling my strings, right?

368
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,030
And the only reason
you're coming after me

369
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:35,870
is because you can't figure out
who they are by yourself!

370
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,330
Which means I'm your only chance

371
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,700
of uncovering this
mastermind of yours!

372
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,540
You think I'm bluffing?

373
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:45,460
I see. If I expose your past,
I lose my leverage.

374
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,670
Exactly! Get it now?

375
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,210
I'm never gonna
tell you anything,

376
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,720
so you're better off
just letting me go!

377
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,760
We'll see. I'll get
that name from you.

378
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,430
Don't worry about that.

379
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,220
[RYUEN]
No matter what it takes.

380
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,600
[gasps]

381
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,890
Ishizaki.

382
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,600
[ISHIZAKI]
Right!

383
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:07,980
[KARUIZAWA]
Wait! What are you doing now?

384
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,320
Hey! Hold on a second!

385
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,190
You don't have to do this!
Just let me go!

386
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,260
[KARUIZAWA]
Please, stop it.

387
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,970
[RYUEN] On the surface, this
school appears to be governed

388
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:46,690
by strict rules.
But in reality, it's not.

389
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:50,020
We're allowed to use violence,
to a certain degree.

390
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,900
Tamper with the cameras.

391
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,230
Bribe upperclassmen.

392
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,950
And make deals
with other classes.

393
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,320
The school prohibits
these things outwardly,

394
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:02,990
while at the same time,
implicitly encourages them.

395
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,410
It's obvious to
anyone with a brain.

396
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,080
And it's up to us to find the
boundaries of what's permitted

397
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:09,710
through trial and error.

398
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:14,420
Let's see where
that boundary lies.

399
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,050
That's enough. We'll move on.

--[water splashing]
--[KARUIZAWA grunting]

401
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,200
[RYUEN] Trauma, by its
very nature, is something

402
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,320
that triggers faster
through experience,

403
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:44,080
rather than just words.

404
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,330
I will break you down until
there's nothing of you left.

[MIYAKE]
Kiyotaka!

407
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,710
I was thinking we
could go do something!

408
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,970
Oh! You mean like karaoke?

409
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,590
That's a great idea!

410
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,300
Well, we managed to
pass our second term!

411
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:04,470
I think we all deserve a break!

412
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,020
You in, Kiyo- <i>pon</i> ?

413
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,310
Sounds like fun.

[KARUIZAWA coughs]

415
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:18,780
Stop it. Please, no more.

416
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,990
[RYUEN] I love seeing you
this way, Karuizawa.

No.

00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,760
I'll ask you one more time.

421
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,510
Who's Class D's mastermind?

422
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:45,510
There's no one!
They're not real.

423
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,520
I promise! Please, no more!

424
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,140
That is some resolve
you've got.

425
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:54,360
Oh, that's right!
I understand now.

426
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,480
Since you've been
bullied your whole life,

427
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:59,650
your tolerance for pain
must be a lot higher, huh?

428
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,280
[IBUKI]
Hey.

429
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:05,410
The second we get her
to tell us his name,

430
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,660
I'm leaving.

431
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:15,790
[RYUEN] This turned out to be
more fun than I thought.

432
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,090
I've decided.

433
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,550
I'll destroy Kei Karuizawa.
