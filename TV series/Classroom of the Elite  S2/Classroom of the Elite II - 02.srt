1
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:28,959
[KOENJI] Hirata, my boy,
you'll have to excuse me.

2
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:35,792
[KOENJI laughs]
Currently, I'm far too busy

3
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:38,458
cultivating the perfect body.

4
00:00:38,542 --> 00:00:40,583
Well, that's as good
a reason as any.

5
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:43,500
Whoa! Huge!
This lounge is amazing!

6
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:46,458
[IKE laughs] Wait until you see
how big the hot tubs are!

7
00:00:46,542 --> 00:00:47,834
[KEN]
You guys wanna check 'em out?

8
00:00:47,917 --> 00:00:51,208
[HIRATA] Let's go over
what we know so far.

9
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:54,041
Truth is, someone's
already messaged me.

10
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:56,834
So, I know who one of
Class D's VIPs is.

11
00:00:56,917 --> 00:00:57,875
You're kidding me.

12
00:00:57,959 --> 00:00:59,834
Who would come out and say it?

13
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:04,792
Well, you see...

14
00:01:06,917 --> 00:01:08,000
That makes sense.

15
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:10,041
But if the VIPs were
evenly distributed,

16
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:12,333
there should be one more
VIP from our class.

17
00:01:12,417 --> 00:01:15,417
[KOENJI] They want us to keep up
this farce for two more days?

18
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,500
How ridiculous.

19
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:19,125
[YUKIMURA]
We have to.

20
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:22,750
This "special exam" is but a
simple quiz to call out a liar.

21
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:24,041
[phones chime]

22
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,667
We got a message?

23
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:26,750
Let's see.

24
00:01:26,834 --> 00:01:28,583
"The Saturn Group's test
has concluded."

25
00:01:28,667 --> 00:01:30,125
Wait, did something happen?

26
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:31,834
"The Saturn Group
is no longer required

27
00:01:31,917 --> 00:01:33,500
to participate in the test"?

28
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:35,917
What did you just do, Koenji?

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,667
[KOENJI laughs] Adieu!
I'm off to work up a sweat.

30
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,917
[AYANOKOJI] If there's anything
good about Koenji,

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,709
it's that he's decisive.

32
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:23,583
[AYANOKOJI]
Of course, it's my fault.

33
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,375
[AYANOKOJI] You're asking
for the impossible.

34
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,667
It's Koenji we're talking about.

35
00:03:43,542 --> 00:03:45,959
[SUZUNE] I swear,
the next time I see him...

36
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,250
...I'll give him
a piece of my mind.

37
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:51,917
If you want. Although,
you know it'd be pointless.

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,125
You're better off just
focusing on your own group.

39
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,500
Our class can't afford
to fail this exam.

40
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:58,875
I know.

41
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,000
[AYANOKOJI] It's probably
too ambitious for Class D

42
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,959
to win in every group.

43
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:09,000
Maybe somebody with a lot of
connections could pull it off.

44
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:12,041
Shame I don't have any.

45
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,917
Tell me everything
you know about Karuizawa.

46
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,041
Huh? Where did that come from?

47
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,291
[AYANOKOJI]
Yukimura and the professor

48
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,208
are easy enough to figure out.

49
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:24,000
But I don't even know where
to begin with Karuizawa.

50
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,834
[SUZUNE] Do you suspect
that she's the other VIP

51
00:04:25,917 --> 00:04:27,750
from our class and is hiding it?

52
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,333
[AYANOKOJI]
That's part of it.

53
00:04:29,417 --> 00:04:33,166
It's just something about the
way she's been acting seems off.

54
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,041
There's never been any
logic behind her actions.

55
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,125
Trying to understand
her is pointless.

56
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:41,250
[AYANOKOJI]
Horikita. As you know,

57
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:44,000
people tend to judge others
by their appearance.

58
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:47,750
How impressive, or attractive
they look, even their clothes.

59
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:51,083
All of those factors form
a "first impression."

60
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,458
What's your point?

61
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,500
[AYANOKOJI] Similarly,
people will make assumptions

62
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,875
about others based
on how they behave.

63
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,417
They're quick to label someone
as "sociable," "aggressive,"

64
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,041
or "easy-going." But, like
with a person's appearance,

65
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:06,041
it's just surface level.

66
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:09,083
The way the others see me
is a prime example of this.

67
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:12,417
So, you believe that Karuizawa
is hiding her true self?

68
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,625
[AYANOKOJI]
Actually, she's more like you.

69
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:20,083
Whenever you first
meet her, she gives off

70
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,250
the impression that she's
a self-centered person,

71
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,291
who's stubborn to a fault.

72
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,542
And yet, she's
undeniably popular

73
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,917
among the students of Class D.

74
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,625
In that case, she could
be the key for our class

75
00:05:31,709 --> 00:05:34,166
to take back the initiative
in this special exam.

76
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,375
Thing is, she's shown
no sign of wanting

77
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,709
to participate in
the test at all.

78
00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:41,542
And she's been unusually quiet.

79
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:44,750
Acting so out of character
makes her suspicious.

80
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:47,208
But is there anything
you can do about it?

81
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,792
You can't exactly
make her participate

82
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,542
if she doesn't want to.

83
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:53,625
That's true. I'm still
working on in.

84
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:55,792
[AYANOKOJI]
If we want to win this,

85
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,041
Class D is going to
have to work together.

86
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:01,083
For that to happen,
we may need Karuizawa's help

87
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,709
convincing the girls.

88
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:04,458
[RYUEN]
Hey, Suzune.

89
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:07,083
Kind of a lame place
to have a date.

90
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:10,834
You don't mind if I join?

91
00:06:10,917 --> 00:06:14,959
Have you come up with a way
to sniff out the VIPs yet?

92
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,834
Even if I had, you'd be
the last person to know.

93
00:06:17,917 --> 00:06:20,583
I actually wanted to
ask you your thoughts.

94
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:22,083
But from the look of things,

95
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,583
you haven't narrowed down
the suspects at all.

96
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:26,333
I doubt you're doing any better.

97
00:06:26,417 --> 00:06:27,750
What if I told you
I'm about to find

98
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:30,333
the identities of all the VIPs?

99
00:06:30,417 --> 00:06:32,458
Would you be more
inclined to listen then?

100
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:35,417
Everyone in our grade knows just
what kind of person you are.

101
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,750
You can't be sure
the information

102
00:06:36,834 --> 00:06:38,333
you've gathered is real.

103
00:06:38,417 --> 00:06:40,834
I couldn't care less
about what they think.

104
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:42,834
Love me, hate me--
it doesn't matter.

105
00:06:42,917 --> 00:06:45,125
In the end, I always
get what I want.

106
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:49,041
[RYUEN]
Just watch.

107
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,208
It's only a matter of time

108
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:52,750
before I have the
whole test in my hands.

109
00:06:52,834 --> 00:06:54,750
Believe me or not.

110
00:06:54,834 --> 00:06:56,417
But don't be surprised
when Class C

111
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,375
comes out on top in every group.

112
00:06:58,458 --> 00:06:59,834
As if!

113
00:06:59,917 --> 00:07:02,709
[AYANOKOJI]
No, it's a definite possibility.

114
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:05,792
Based on the other tests, the
school structures their exams

115
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:09,375
so that they adhere to
some underlying logic.

116
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,959
They seem difficult at first,
but if you understand

117
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:14,166
the underlying logic,
you can almost guarantee

118
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,417
a passing grade.

119
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,709
It seems like
he's realized that.

120
00:07:17,792 --> 00:07:20,959
Once I know the identities
of the VIPs in my class,

121
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,792
I'll be able to use that
to narrow down

122
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:23,959
the other possibilities.

123
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:26,166
Why would anyone
share that info?

124
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,291
If I was in the same class as
a tyrant like you, who's to say

125
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:32,125
I wouldn't stay quiet and just
keep the points for myself?

126
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:33,959
Yeah, that would be a problem.

127
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:38,000
But, you see, I don't need
to take anyone at their word.

128
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,041
Because everyone from
Class C handed over

129
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,750
their cell phones to me.

130
00:07:42,834 --> 00:07:46,375
And now, all I need to do
is check out their emails.

131
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,125
But that's against the rules!

132
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,291
You're crazy!

133
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:50,667
You could get expelled
for breaking the--

134
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,959
[RYUEN] We both know
that's not gonna happen.

135
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:57,709
I've made sure of that.
Anyway do you believe me now?

136
00:08:02,417 --> 00:08:03,834
Well, Suzune?

137
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,208
[SUZUNE]
Get lost.

138
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,792
Like I said, I'm about
to get to the endgame.

139
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,834
And that's why...

140
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,834
[RYUEN]
...I have a proposal.

141
00:08:18,917 --> 00:08:21,125
Why don't our classes
work together?

142
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,709
It'll be easy to get
Class B on board.

143
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:28,125
If we knew the identities
of all our classes' VIPs...

144
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:32,000
It'll be child's play to figure
out who the Class A VIPs are.

145
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,750
Then we'd utterly crush them.

146
00:08:34,834 --> 00:08:36,083
What do you say?

147
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,875
You're just wasting your breath.

148
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:40,709
No one's going to
accept your proposal.

149
00:08:40,792 --> 00:08:43,542
That's too bad. I thought
it was a good offer.

150
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,041
[RYUEN]
Catch you later,

151
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,500
Suzune.

152
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,709
[KARUIZAWA]
This familiar feeling.

153
00:09:00,792 --> 00:09:02,667
I'm back to how I used to be.

154
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,959
I don't need a social life.

155
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,083
I don't need any friends!

156
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,542
The only thing that
matters right now

157
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,500
is keeping myself safe.

158
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,083
I won't let them
hurt me anymore.

159
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,667
I'll do whatever it takes!

160
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm a parasite.

161
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:20,750
A creature that can't
live on its own, pathetic.

162
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,500
[SUZUNE] How much longer are
you going to just sit there?

163
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,583
It would be quite annoying
if rumors about us

164
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:31,000
started to spread.

165
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,333
[AYANOKOJI] You're the one
asked to meet up.

166
00:09:32,417 --> 00:09:34,583
You've overstayed your welcome.

167
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:41,041
[AYANOKOJI]
This is gonna be awkward.

168
00:10:00,792 --> 00:10:02,709
[gasps] Hey!

169
00:10:02,792 --> 00:10:04,125
Well, fancy seeing you here!

170
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,625
Hey, Kushida.

171
00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:08,375
Um, Ayanokoji, are you alone?

172
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:09,500
Yeah.

173
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:12,000
I am, too!

174
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,458
What a coincidence.

175
00:10:14,542 --> 00:10:16,417
Well, goodnight.

176
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,000
[KIKYO]
Mm-hm. See you later!

177
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:21,083
It is getting late.
I should go, too!

178
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,125
[AYANOKOJI]
Bye.

179
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,166
[KIKYO]
Hold on!

180
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,208
Huh?

181
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:34,750
Kushida?

182
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,583
[KIKYO] Sorry, I didn't
mean to scare you.

183
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:43,083
People were hugging like this.

184
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,750
And so, I...

185
00:10:45,834 --> 00:10:48,083
I wanted to see how it felt.

186
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,667
[KIKYO gasps]
Oh, no!

187
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,333
Sorry! Really!

188
00:10:55,417 --> 00:10:58,083
I shouldn't have
jumped on you like that.

189
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,500
Have a good night!

190
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:05,917
Huh. That was surprising.

191
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,166
[HOSHINOMIYA]
Ah, I've missed this!

192
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,834
It's been a while!

193
00:11:11,917 --> 00:11:13,333
Things have been
so hectic lately,

194
00:11:13,417 --> 00:11:16,458
we haven't gotten
a chance to catch up!

195
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,208
I saw you the other day.

196
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,417
It kinda looked like
you were on a date!

197
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,208
Was that your new girlfriend?

198
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:23,500
[MASHIMA]
What about you?

199
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:24,834
What happened to
your last boyfriend?

200
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,959
[HOSHINOMIYA giggles]
Oh, him?

201
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:29,834
He didn't even last two weeks!

202
00:11:29,917 --> 00:11:31,875
--[CHABASHIRA] Chie.
--[HOSHINOMIYA] What's up?

203
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:34,500
I was wondering.
Normally, the representatives

204
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,959
for each class are assigned
to the Earth group.

205
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,000
[HOSHINOMIYA] Ah, you're
asking about Ichinose.

206
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:43,792
I promise you, I don't have
any ulterior motives.

207
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,375
Ichinose's a good girl,
but grades aren't everything,

208
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,166
and I think she could
use the challenge.

209
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,500
That's why I figured
it'd be best

210
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,542
if she was in the Mars group!

211
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,291
Yeah, that's fair enough.

212
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,542
It's not that big
of a deal, is it?

213
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,792
I just wanted to double
check that you weren't

214
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,875
being personally motivated.

215
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:01,291
[HOSHINOMIYA]
Oh, come on!

216
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:04,000
Are you talking about that
thing from ten years ago?

217
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,709
I've told you a thousand times,

218
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:07,417
that's all water
under the bridge!

219
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,250
[CHABASHIRA]
I wonder about that.

220
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,291
It's just that you always
seem so desperate

221
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,917
to butt into my business
one way or another.

222
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Well, to tell you the truth,
I'm curious about

223
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,500
your fascination with
that Ayanokoji boy,

224
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,834
but that's a coincidence!

225
00:12:20,917 --> 00:12:23,083
Though, when I think
about it a little more...

226
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:25,667
I would like to know how he
ended up as Class D's leader

227
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,041
during the last exam.

228
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,709
[MASHIMA]
Is that what this is about?

229
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:33,041
While it's not a strict rule,
we should be impartial.

230
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,458
Please don't put
me in a position

231
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:36,083
where I'd have to file a report.

232
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:39,166
Aw. I wouldn't do that!

233
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,333
[KARUIZAWA] That's why
I want you to protect me!

234
00:12:49,417 --> 00:12:50,750
I got your message.

235
00:12:50,834 --> 00:12:53,125
It's not like you
to resort to violence.

236
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:54,208
What's going on?

237
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,208
They keep on harassing me!

238
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:59,375
I'm your girlfriend, you should
be taking my side on this!

239
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,959
No matter what I do,
they won't leave me alone.

240
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:04,000
I'm afraid of what
they might try next.

241
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,000
We're gonna figure this out.

242
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:09,208
All we have to do is find a way
to patch things up with them.

243
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:10,625
[KARUIZAWA]
That's impossible!

244
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:13,542
Those girls just
hate me for no reason!

245
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,417
[HIRATA] You say that,
but you picked a fight

246
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,291
with Rika in the first place.

247
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:18,542
[KARUIZAWA]
Not on purpose!

248
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,500
I accidentally bumped into her.

249
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,792
Don't forget, you promised
that you'd protect me, Hirata!

250
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,875
[HIRATA]
I did, and I'm gonna help!

251
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:27,500
I won't stand by and do nothing

252
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:30,542
when someone harasses
my classmate.

253
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,208
But I won't hurt anyone.

254
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:36,792
There has to be a way
to resolve this peacefully.

255
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,542
You lied to me.

256
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:39,709
You're a liar!

257
00:13:39,792 --> 00:13:41,792
You told me that
you'd protect me!

258
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:44,166
[HIRATA]
I'm the liar?

259
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,917
The only lie I've told
is to the rest of our class.

260
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,792
Because it's not like
we're actually dating.

261
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,667
I didn't mind pretending
to be in a fake relationship.

262
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,834
But I told you at the start

263
00:14:06,917 --> 00:14:09,166
I couldn't take your
side on everything.

264
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,125
This is one of those times.

265
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,792
What are you saying?

266
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,000
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do!

267
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,834
The only way you're
going to get out of this

268
00:14:16,917 --> 00:14:19,208
is if you to face
the problem head on.

269
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,917
[KARUIZAWA]
Hirata, don't you care

270
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,375
about what they'll do to me?

271
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:25,834
That's not what I'm saying.
I won't let them hurt you.

272
00:14:25,917 --> 00:14:27,500
I know you might not like it.

273
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,166
But I can act as a mediator
and tell Manabe and the others

274
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,709
that you want to apologize.

275
00:14:31,792 --> 00:14:33,125
Anything but that!

276
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:34,625
[HIRATA]
If you won't apologize,

277
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:36,625
there's not much else
I can do to help.

278
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:37,875
Find someone else.

279
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:39,333
[KARUIZAWA]
Forget you, then!

280
00:14:39,417 --> 00:14:41,750
If you won't protect me
like you promised,

281
00:14:41,834 --> 00:14:43,917
then I don't need you anymore!

282
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,125
Don't talk to me ever again!

283
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,500
We're done!

284
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:05,458
[HIRATA]
Oh, hey!

285
00:15:05,542 --> 00:15:06,834
How long were you there?

286
00:15:06,917 --> 00:15:08,959
Pretty much from the beginning.

287
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,583
So, you heard that.

288
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:12,458
Can I ask you a question?

289
00:15:12,542 --> 00:15:13,959
[HIRATA]
Sure.

290
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,250
[AYANOKOJI] To be honest,
I've actually been meaning to

291
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,041
ask you this for a while now.

292
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:20,083
But why were you pretending
to be Karuizawa's boyfriend?

293
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,875
Was it that obvious?

294
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:24,959
Sounds like you already knew
that we weren't a real couple.

295
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:28,250
You two started "dating"
each other four months ago,

296
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:31,291
and yet you always kept
her at arm's length.

297
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:34,083
You didn't even call each other
by your first names.

298
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,542
[HIRATA]
You figured us out.

299
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:39,000
[AYANOKOJI] In less than a month
after we got to the school,

300
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:42,500
a rumor spread around that
Hirata had asked her out.

301
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:46,625
Afterwards, Karuizawa's
popularity skyrocketed.

302
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:51,000
Just like a parasite.

303
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,583
Or wait.

304
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:58,875
Maybe she's trying
to protect herself.

305
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,500
Right on the money again!

306
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,834
You're surprisingly
perceptive, Ayanokoji.

307
00:16:02,917 --> 00:16:04,667
It's giving me goosebumps!

308
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,333
[AYANOKOJI] I'm just repeating
what Horikita said.

309
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:09,792
[AYANOKOJI] I don't understand
why he's telling me all of this.

310
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,375
It's strange.

311
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:15,000
I guess she caught on, too.

312
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,834
One day after school,
Karuizawa asked me

313
00:16:17,917 --> 00:16:19,792
to pretend to be her boyfriend.

314
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,333
So, I went along with it.

315
00:16:21,417 --> 00:16:23,417
She wanted me to protect her.

316
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,208
She felt I could save her.

317
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:26,875
[AYANOKOJI]
From what?

318
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,125
From the stress
of it all, I suppose.

319
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,000
Truth is,

320
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:35,583
the person who she's pretending
to be isn't the real Karuizawa.

321
00:16:35,667 --> 00:16:37,792
I think she's forcing
herself to act tough

322
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,250
or like she doesn't care.

323
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,750
Huh.

324
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,458
[HIRATA] It might be hard to
believe, looking at her now,

325
00:16:42,542 --> 00:16:44,792
that she wasn't always popular.

326
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:48,250
In reality, she's been
the victim of horrific bullying

327
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:51,375
that's followed her for nearly
ten years of schooling.

328
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:11,959
[KARUIZAWA]
Hey, I'm curious.

329
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,917
You're not the VIP, are you?

330
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,417
It shouldn't be Yukimura
or what's-his-face

331
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,250
from our class? The weird one?

332
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:20,333
[AYANOKOJI]
It's not me.

333
00:17:20,417 --> 00:17:22,792
I see. Thanks for the info.

334
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,333
[AYANOKOJI]
That was surprisingly fast.

335
00:17:25,417 --> 00:17:27,667
Do you believe me?

336
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,709
[KARUIZAWA]
Well, you aren't, right?

337
00:17:29,792 --> 00:17:32,583
[ICHINOSE]
Huh? Oh, wow! You're early!

338
00:17:32,667 --> 00:17:34,375
Ready to go, huh?

339
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:45,083
Would it kill you to take
this discussion seriously?

340
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,792
[MANABE] Lately, I just
seem to eat and eat,

341
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,375
but I'm still hungry.

342
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:52,959
[YAMASHITA]
Honestly, same!

343
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,542
[MACHIDA]
It'll be okay.

344
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:57,166
Whatever happens,
I'll support you.

345
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,667
Thank you so much, Machida!

346
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,500
[MANABE] Did you see Koenji
walking around earlier?

347
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,000
[YABU]
Yeah, in that tiny speedo?

348
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,041
[KARUIZAWA]
You're so reliable!

349
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,125
[AYANOKOJI]
Ichinose's doing her best.

350
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:34,750
But we still can't
break this deadlock.

351
00:18:34,834 --> 00:18:37,250
Exactly as Class A planned.

352
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,625
[AYANOKOJI]
Still no luck.

353
00:18:59,709 --> 00:19:03,083
Ichinose keeps trying different
ways to lead the group.

354
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:12,083
[AYANOKOJI] But Class A
isn't budging an inch.

355
00:19:17,709 --> 00:19:18,667
[MACHIDA]
Karuizawa.

356
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,750
I'll call you later, 'kay?

357
00:19:25,542 --> 00:19:27,333
Tch.

358
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:29,250
[KARUIZAWA]
The meeting's finally over!

359
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,500
Yeah, I'm on my way!

360
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:32,750
Sure!

361
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,375
[YUKIMURA]
Those Class C girls.

362
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:42,834
They're acting
kind of suspicious.

363
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:45,125
Them? They are?

364
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,500
I think they might
be up to something.

365
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,375
Should we follow them,
to be safe?

366
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:50,709
So annoying.

367
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:52,291
We've already got
enough to worry about

368
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,083
with this stupid exam.

369
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,250
[BOTH gasp]

370
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:26,792
You again?

371
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:29,250
Look, I already told you that
you've got the wrong person!

372
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,667
You're not getting out of this!

373
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,125
You can play dumb all you want,
we know it was you!

374
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:36,000
You're crazy! Why would
I push your friend?

375
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:40,000
Why won't you just
leave me alone?

376
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,333
Listen, I've got
stuff to do, okay?

377
00:20:42,417 --> 00:20:43,667
Can I go now?

378
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,542
[YAMASHITA] Fine, let's
find out once and for all.

379
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:48,208
[MANABE] We're going to give
Rika a call and ask.

380
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:51,041
And if she says it wasn't you,
then we'll let you go.

381
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,750
You can't treat me this way!

382
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,500
I'm telling the
school about this!

383
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:55,917
[YABU]
Hah, who cares?

384
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,250
[YAMASHITA] Seriously?
We haven't even touched a hair

385
00:20:58,333 --> 00:20:59,834
on your stupid, ugly head.

386
00:20:59,917 --> 00:21:01,750
[MANABE] Maybe we should tell
the school that you shoved Rika!

387
00:21:01,834 --> 00:21:02,750
What do you think of that?

388
00:21:02,834 --> 00:21:04,375
[YAMASHITA]
Don't try to run.

389
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:08,041
[yelps] Wait!
Just hold on a sec!

390
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,792
[YABU]
Are you gonna admit it?

391
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,709
I think I remember now.

392
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:15,000
I accidentally bumped into
someone in the café once. Owie!

393
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,917
[YAMASHITA]
You're so transparent.

394
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,417
Took you long enough
to admit you did it.

395
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,834
Whatever. Are you gonna
apologize to Rika?

396
00:21:22,917 --> 00:21:24,500
But it wasn't my fault!

397
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,000
I barely even touched her
when she tripped on her own!

398
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,959
If she wasn't so clumsy...

399
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:30,250
How dare you?

400
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,166
You're still making excuses?

401
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,291
All you had to do
was apologize to Rika,

402
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,583
and we would've just let you go!

403
00:21:36,667 --> 00:21:37,875
You're a bunch of liars.

404
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:40,959
You were never
going to let me go.

405
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,250
Hey, Shiho.

406
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:44,250
I don't think she's
gonna say sorry.

407
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,208
So why don't we get
a little payback for Rika?

408
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:48,709
You're so right!
Let's teach her a lesson!

409
00:21:48,792 --> 00:21:49,750
[KARUIZAWA muffled screaming]

410
00:21:49,834 --> 00:21:50,834
[AYANOKOJI]
Not yet.

411
00:21:50,917 --> 00:21:54,208
We can't just sit here
and do nothing!

412
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:55,917
[GIRLS laughing]

413
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,834
[YAMASHITA]
Aw, what's wrong?

414
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:00,834
[MANABE] Save that
"helpless little girl" act

415
00:22:00,917 --> 00:22:02,417
for someone who cares!

416
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,041
[YAMASHITA] Just seeing her ugly
face makes me want to punch it.

417
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:06,500
[YABU]
C'mon, say cheese!

418
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:08,041
Maybe we should
leave a couple scars

419
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:10,000
to make sure it really sinks in.

420
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:12,750
Wait a sec, look!
She's actually crying!

421
00:22:12,834 --> 00:22:15,250
Please, stop it.

422
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:16,709
Let me go!

423
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:20,500
Huh.
