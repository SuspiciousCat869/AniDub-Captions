1
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:31,200
[RYUEN] Sometimes I wonder,
before I killed it,

2
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,080
if it had bitten me that day.

3
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,120
If I had been afraid of it,

4
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,710
would I still have made
the same decision?

5
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:53,140
[phone rings]

6
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,520
Where the hell could he have
run off to in his condition?

7
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,400
[sighs]

8
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,030
[footsteps]

9
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:14,370
[IBUKI] Don't tell me
you're dropping out!

10
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,040
Uh--

11
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:26,250
All of my personal points.
I'm giving them to you.

12
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,380
Huh?

13
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,250
I have to take responsibility.

14
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,880
It's my fault.

15
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,930
So, you're just gonna
give up like that?

16
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,800
You always said the
only thing that mattered

17
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,010
was who was left
standing in the end!

18
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,140
Wasn't that how you and
Albert managed to take--

19
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,770
What's your point?

20
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,520
You're saying that's
the end of it?

21
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,810
There's no reason
for me to stay.

22
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,110
People only tolerate tyrants
when they serve a purpose.

23
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,530
I'm not gonna just let
you quit without a fight!

24
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,870
You're still injured.
Don't bother.

25
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,250
What's wrong with you?

26
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,510
You didn't even
try to dodge that!

27
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,340
Fine, go quit, then!

28
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,050
[IBUKI]
Man, that felt good!

29
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,400
[AYANOKOJI] Interesting.
She could still be useful.

30
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,700
[KARUIZAWA] After what happened
yesterday, something's changed.

31
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,370
Things're completely
different now.

32
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,040
And it's all because of him.

33
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,290
Kiyotaka.

34
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,660
[KARUIZAWA]
He doesn't talk much.

35
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,250
And he's basically
invisible in class.

36
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,300
[KARUIZAWA] But deep down,
he's totally different.

37
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,880
He uses people without
a second thought,

38
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:59,010
but he kept his
promise to save me.

39
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,890
[KARUIZAWA gasps]

40
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,020
[KARUIZAWA]
That's impossible.

41
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:10,650
I don't have any
feelings for him, do I?

42
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:14,030
No way! That's just crazy!

43
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,240
[KARUIZAWA]
No freaking way!

44
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,330
Did you say, "a date"?

45
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,710
Uh-huh!

46
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,590
With Kiyo--I mean,
with Ayanokoji?

47
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,460
That's what I said!

48
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,130
I was wondering
if you had any tips

49
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,510
for how to make him fall for me.

50
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,340
Huh?

51
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,840
Oh, come on!

52
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,680
You and Hirata started dating
as soon as school started,

53
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,720
so you definitely know
what you're doing!

54
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:10,230
I guess so, but, to be honest,
it's not anything special.

55
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,480
I totally disagree! I think
you're super awesome!

56
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,270
Oh, thanks!

57
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,730
[KARUIZAWA]
But why did it have to be him?

58
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,860
All right, so.
It's just a first draft,

59
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,570
but I came up with a plan
for how the date could go.

60
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,120
Tell me what you think!

61
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,660
Uh, okay!

62
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,910
[KARUIZAWA]
Let's see here.

63
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,370
Meet up at 12.
Grab lunch. See a movie.

64
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,420
After that, go shopping.

65
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,750
Then, under the
legendary tree...

66
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,710
Make it official?

67
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,130
You're going exclusive?
After just one date?

68
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,760
Also, what's this about
a "legendary tree"?

69
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,560
Um. So. When are you
planning to have the date?

70
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,100
In two days!

71
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,480
It'll be on December 25th!

72
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,060
[KARUIZAWA] You're seriously
having your first date

73
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,560
on Christmas day?
That's intense!

74
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:01,110
What is Kiyotaka thinking,
actually taking her up on it?

75
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,030
Well, it's better than a date
on Christmas Eve, I guess.

76
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,660
Is everything all right?

77
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,200
Oh, yeah, no problem!

78
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,330
This is a really
good starting point!

79
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,290
But I've got some ideas for how
we could make it even better!

80
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:13,710
Really?

81
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,790
I knew coming to you for help
was the right choice!

82
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,380
Well, like you said,
I'm kinda used to it!

83
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,340
[KARUIZAWA]
Although, I've never actually

84
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,420
been on a real date before.

85
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:25,090
But since Sato specifically
asked me for advice,

86
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,470
I have to at least try my best!

87
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,010
[SATO]
Oh, one more thing!

88
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,140
What do you think about us
making this into a double date?

89
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:36,190
[gasps] A double date?

90
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,200
A date, huh?

91
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,330
Tell me what the plan is?

92
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,950
I thought you were done with
trying to bring up Class D,

93
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,330
so why are you getting
close to Sato?

94
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,960
But what if this
is something personal.

95
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,890
[phone rings]

96
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,550
Yes?

97
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,970
[AYANOKOJI]
Are you by yourself right now?

98
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,100
Yeah. I am. What's up?

99
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,600
[AYANOKOJI]
I need your help.

100
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,770
I want you to look
into something for me.

101
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,190
[KARUIZAWA]
Are you serious?

102
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,900
And what happened to
not needing to ask me

103
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,740
to do things for
you anymore, huh?

104
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,910
Whatever, just tell me
what you want me to do now.

105
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,450
[AYANOKOJI]
It's about Sato.

106
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:32,290
[gasps] What does she
have to do with anything?

107
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,330
[AYANOKOJI]
Find out who she hangs out with,

108
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,710
and what she does
on a normal day.

109
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,250
I want you to get
as much information

110
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,380
about her personal
life as possible.

111
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,920
I don't know if I can
help you with this.

112
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,710
Sato and I don't really hang out
in the same friend groups.

113
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,420
[AYANOKOJI]
Email me whatever you discover.

114
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,340
[phone clicks]

115
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,840
[KARUIZAWA]
Hold up!

116
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,520
At least let me call you a jerk
before you hang up!

117
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,480
[KARUIZAWA]
Stupid Kiyotaka.

118
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,480
I guess he wanted to get
some information on her

119
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,060
before his date to
make sure it goes well.

120
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:05,860
Could it be that he actually
has feelings for Sato?

121
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:10,820
Or maybe he wants
to make her a pawn, too.

122
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,910
But he already has me.

123
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,080
[KARUIZAWA groans]
Dang it.

124
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,870
I can never tell what's
going on in his head!

125
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,880
[SUZUNE]
Well, this is a treat.

126
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,420
Normally, you only invite me out

127
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,680
whenever there's a special
exam to deal with.

128
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,180
I guess that's true.

129
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:34,300
All right, then. Is there
something you want?

130
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:38,390
So, listen. You should join
the student council.

131
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,730
[gasps] Why would I?

132
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:42,900
I just don't understand

133
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,320
why you'd bring this
up all of a sudden.

134
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,990
It's not my idea.

135
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:50,650
A certain someone would like you
to join the student council.

136
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,240
It's your older brother.

137
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,830
[gasps] That seems unlikely.

138
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:01,210
You don't need to believe me.
Just ask him yourself.

139
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,760
If you're lying to me,
I'll make sure you pay.

140
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:19,100
[SUZUNE]
Um. Hello? Yes, it's me.

141
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,690
Yeah, Suzune. Uh-huh.

142
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:25,480
Sorry, Ayanokoji just
handed me his phone.

143
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:30,990
Yes. Right. Okay.

144
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,370
[sighs]

145
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,250
What did he say?

146
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,380
He said joining the council
would benefit me,

147
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,130
but didn't explain further.

148
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,420
Thing is, even if
he wants me to do it,

149
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:52,930
I can't see what good
it would do for me.

150
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,470
At the very least,

151
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:57,220
I'll wait until after I'm done
being your stand in.

152
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,060
I'll give you more
time to consider.

153
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,190
Okay, but I've already
made up my mind.

154
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,990
Aren't they so cute together?

155
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,960
[GIRL 213A laughs]
Hey, that tickles!

156
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,000
[GUY 213A]
Oh, yeah?

157
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,340
It's cold.

158
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,010
[RYUEN] You're a disappointing
Christmas Eve date.

159
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,680
I thought that maybe we
could have a little chat.

160
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,440
I tried turning myself in
for spray painting the cameras.

161
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,520
I was fully expecting to
get expelled because of it.

162
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:53,450
But, apparently,
Class D took the blame.

163
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:59,450
[RYUEN]
So, it seems I get to stay.

164
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,490
I'm guessing you arranged that.

165
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:06,710
[AYANOKOJI] Huh. Trying to drop
out over the security cameras,

166
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:10,750
that's a surprising decision.
To be honest with you,

167
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,670
I figured it'd be because
of the Karuizawa thing.

168
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,090
[RYUEN]
If I did that,

169
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,510
the others would've
been expelled, too.

170
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,850
It'd be a lousy way

171
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,850
for me to take responsibility
for the situation.

172
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:26,020
[AYANOKOJI]
Makes sense.

173
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,440
Yesterday, in the storage room.

174
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,110
I was impressed.

175
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,070
[RYUEN]
What do you mean?

176
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,820
You made a wise
choice back there.

177
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,700
If you were by yourself,

178
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,120
you could've hung in there

179
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,450
and put up more
of a fight, I'm sure.

180
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,500
You realized you had
no chance of beating me,

181
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,710
so you put on that show
before surrendering.

182
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,090
Heh. You're paying me
a compliment, but,

183
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:54,460
for some reason, I can't help
but feel a little insulted.

184
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,800
Like you're looking down on me.

185
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,970
So, what now? What do
you got planned for me?

186
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,180
Nothing.

187
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,640
[RYUEN]
Heh. Yeah, right. Let me guess,

188
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,730
you're gonna send me after
the other classes, right?

189
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,270
That's what I'd do.

190
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:12,480
There's no other reason you'd
keep me here at this school.

191
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,610
Other classes?

192
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:17,360
And why would I do
something like that?

193
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,740
But what about Class D?

194
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,240
I don't care about them.

195
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,580
Although, I wouldn't
get in the way

196
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,250
of those who want to
raise their class ranking.

197
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,000
That's fair enough.

198
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,330
Before they can do that,
Class D has a serious problem

199
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,380
they need to take care of first.

200
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,250
You mean Kikyo.

201
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,420
What're you gonna do?

202
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,920
A word of advice.

203
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:41,180
You can treat a cancer to
keep it at bay for a while,

204
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,390
but unless you cut it out,
it'll never truly go away.

205
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:49,640
What's worse, if you're not
careful, it may start to spread.

206
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:52,520
I've already made up my mind.

207
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:53,480
[RYUEN]
Oh?

208
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:54,820
[AYANOKOJI]
In the third term,

209
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,740
Class D will take
Class C's place.

210
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,530
But it'll be temporary,

211
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:02,490
and they'll fall back
down to the bottom.

212
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:04,830
That's because...

213
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,200
...I'm going to have Kikyo
Kushida kicked out of school.

214
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,590
Heh. You're a real terror,
through and through,

215
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,920
you know that?

216
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,310
[SATO]
Hey there, Ayanokoji!

217
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,810
You're here early.

218
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:31,190
Looks like you
got here early, too!

219
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,270
Please tell me you weren't

220
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,440
waiting very long
for me to show up.

221
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,980
No, don't worry,
I just got here.

222
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:37,940
[SATO]
Really?

223
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,030
Uh-huh.

224
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,700
So where to?

225
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,660
Oh! Let's see.

226
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,790
[HIRATA]
Hey!

227
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,000
Hirata?

228
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,250
Fancy seeing you two here!

229
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,290
[SATO gasps]
What a coincidence!

230
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,460
[KARUIZAWA laughs]

231
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,000
Are you out on a date, as well?

232
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,630
[HIRATA]
Well, it is Christmas.

233
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,260
It was Karuizawa's idea.

234
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,510
[SATO]
I can't believe we ran into you!

235
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:05,850
I'm just glad to spend
the day with someone.

236
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,470
Huh, with your popularity,
I'm surprised

237
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,850
that you didn't have
anything else planned.

238
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,850
I guess my friends
thought I'd be busy.

239
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,860
Makes sense.

240
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,270
Well, we should let you two
get back to your date.

241
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,240
Hey, Kei. Wanna head out?

242
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,400
Actually, I've got an idea!

243
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:25,990
What do you think about us
turning this into a double date?

244
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,870
A double date, huh?

245
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,450
Come on!

246
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,710
I checked with Sato, we planned
on doing the same stuff anyway!

247
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:35,630
It'd be fun to mix
things up a little!

248
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,210
[HIRATA]
Sure, but it's Christmas.

249
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,880
You can't decide that
all on your own.

250
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,510
Are you okay with it?

251
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:46,510
Yeah! Sounds good to me!
Are you cool with that, too?

252
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,800
If that's what
everyone wants to do,

253
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,640
then I have no objections.

254
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,100
Great! It's settled then!

255
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,640
[SATO]
All right!

256
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,790
[WAITRESS 213A]
Hi! How many in your party?

257
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,290
I have a reservation
under Sato.

258
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,880
[WAITRESS 213A] Let's see,
a reservation for four, right?

259
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,670
Please, follow me!

260
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:23,420
That's quite the coincidence.
Almost like she knew.

261
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,760
Oh, Sato called and
changed the reservation

262
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,970
after we decided to do
the double date!

263
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,470
What a liar.

264
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:33,100
[laughs] I don't wanna hear
that from you of all people!

265
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:38,060
What do you normally do
on your days off, Sato?

266
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:41,820
Oh, I usually spend my free time
learning about fashion design.

267
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,820
Wow, I never knew that!

268
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,280
It makes sense that
you'd be into that stuff.

269
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,650
Thanks!

270
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,950
And it'd be great if I could
make it into Class A!

271
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:52,870
Do you know what you
wanna do after graduation?

272
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,200
[gasps]

273
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,000
University, I guess.

274
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,540
[SATO] Oh, gross.
I could never do that.

275
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,420
Even the thought of
having to do more school

276
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,880
after I graduate
makes me wanna puke.

277
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,380
[HIRATA laughs] I take it
you're not a fan of academics.

278
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,380
[SATO]
I mean, it's not like I hate it,

279
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,220
it's just not really my thing.

280
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,140
[SATO]
Today was amazing!

281
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,220
--[AYANOKOJI] I agree.
--[HIRATA] I'll say!

282
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,890
[HIRATA]
This was fun, you two.

283
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,190
[SATO]
Uh-huh! Thanks for coming along!

284
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,020
[KARUIZAWA]
Bye-bye!

285
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,900
We'll see you guys later!

286
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,900
So, hey. Do you think that
we could stop somewhere

287
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,650
on the way back to the dorms?

288
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:36,200
[SATO] Karuizawa and Hirata
are really something, huh?

289
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:40,630
And they make such a perfect
couple, too, don't you think?

290
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,960
I'd love to have
what they've got.

291
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,550
Hey, Sato.

292
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:52,510
I appreciate you
inviting me out today.

293
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,890
It was fun.

294
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,680
[SATO]
Um. Ayanokoji?

295
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:01,100
Tell me, did you actually
have fun with us?

296
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,820
What makes you think I didn't?

297
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,280
It's just... I was
watching you today.

298
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,070
And I never saw you
smile even once.

299
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,400
It's not on you.

300
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:13,070
I've never been the
type to smile much.

301
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,830
[AYANOKOJI]
But it's not that I can't smile.

302
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:20,250
You just haven't
given me a reason to.

303
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,460
I'd rather not waste the energy.

304
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,840
Listen up.

305
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,170
Um. I really like you, 'kay?

306
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,840
Do you like me?

307
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,220
[AYANOKOJI]
I'm sorry, Sato.

308
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,640
The truth is,

309
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,220
I don't think I can be the
person you want me to be.

310
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:39,220
Oh. I understand.

311
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:41,390
I should've expected it.

312
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:45,440
Could you tell me why?

313
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,230
I mean, only if you're
comfortable with it.

314
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,070
It wouldn't be right
for me to lead you on

315
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,620
since I don't have
any feelings for you.

316
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,910
[SATO gasps]

317
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,250
[AYANOKOJI]
Honestly,

318
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:04,040
I've never felt romantically
attracted to anyone before.

319
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,840
When it comes down to it,

320
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,880
I don't think I'm mature
enough to fall in love.

321
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,920
[SATO]
I see.

322
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:17,560
It's my fault for moving
too fast, I guess.

323
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,640
Sorry. I think I need
some alone time.

324
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:27,270
[sighs] You can come out.

325
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,740
I still don't understand,

326
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,290
why did you turn Sato down?

327
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,290
Why would I settle for her,
when I already have you?

328
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:48,920
[gasps] Can I ask a question?

329
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,840
I guess I've kinda had this
feeling for a while now.

330
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,090
But I wanna know.

331
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:56,180
Do you really only see
people as tools to use?

332
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,680
And what if said that I do?

333
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,390
Also. You've never had
a crush on anyone?

334
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,060
Ever?

335
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,230
Unfortunately, it's true.

336
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,570
Oh, wow. It's
really coming down.

337
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,080
With how gloomy
you always are,

338
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,540
I bet you haven't
gotten a single present

339
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,540
from anyone, right? Here.

340
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,500
[KARUIZAWA] It's not a big deal,
so just take it, okay?

341
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,470
[AYANOKOJI]
Oh, right. I got this for you.

342
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,720
[KARUIZAWA]
Cold medicine?

343
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:46,060
The other day, you were
completely drenched with water.

344
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,610
I thought you
might've fallen ill.

345
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,730
But I guess I was wrong.

346
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,110
[sighs]

347
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:57,150
[KARUIZAWA] At least it shows
he was worried about me.

348
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,990
Thanks a bunch.

349
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:01,830
It's about time we
headed back. Let's go.

350
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:05,250
[gasps] Oh, yeah. Sure thing.

351
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,630
[AYANOKOJI]
Excellent.

352
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:18,470
From now on, she'll be
entirely dependent on me.

353
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,850
I proposed an end
to our arrangement,

354
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:23,680
which sparked a fear
of abandonment in her,

355
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:26,680
and waited until she was
at her breaking point.

356
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:29,140
Only then did I
come to save her.

357
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:35,030
[AYANOKOJI]
Everything went as planned.

358
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:38,240
I upheld my promise
to her, and now,

359
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,330
she genuinely trusts
that I'll protect her.

360
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:47,750
Karuizawa's proven her loyalty
and her usefulness. But...

361
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,960
[sighs]

362
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,920
Oh, wow! Look at how
pretty all the snow is!

363
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,300
It's nice.

364
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,760
[AYANOKOJI]
Even now.

365
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:04,720
I suppose I'm still
stuck in that place.

366
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:09,020
[AYANOKOJI] I wonder, will I
ever see those around me

367
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,110
as more than just pawns?

368
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:17,400
Will the relationships I've made
so far ever be more than that?

369
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,700
[KARUIZAWA]
We're almost at the dorms.

370
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:54,420
Someone might recognize us,
so let's part ways here.

371
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,500
[AYANOKOJI]
Right.

372
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,880
Have a good night!

373
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,650
I've been looking for a chance
to speak with you privately.

374
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:21,320
It has been a while.
Right, Ayanokoji?

375
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,740
Do I know you?

376
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:30,870
[SAKAYANAGI] Perhaps not, but I
know exactly who you are.

377
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:34,460
The "ultimate masterpiece"
of the White Room.

378
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,790
Though, as far as I'm concerned,

379
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:38,380
you're nothing
but a false genius.

380
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,050
But don't worry, I'll
make sure to bury you.

381
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:47,380
Really now? Well,
you are welcome to try.
