1
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,200
Apparently. No one from
any of the other classes

2
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,700
was expelled during
the Paper Shuffle, either.

3
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,580
If you ask me, that's good.

4
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,580
Even if we're competing, I don't
want to see them get expelled.

5
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,370
That would make me really sad.

6
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,790
Yeah, it would be great
if we could all just get along

7
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,500
with everyone, but the
school keeps pitting us

8
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,130
against each other.

9
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,210
I agree. If we don't do our best

10
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,260
to overtake the other classes,
we put ourselves at risk.

11
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,680
I guess.

12
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,390
Huh?

13
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,770
[YUKIMURA] Well, that's not
something you see every day.

14
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,900
Those two hanging out like that.

15
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,150
Aren't they basically rivals?
You're right, that is weird.

16
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,360
Well, it is Ichinose
we're talking about,

17
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,940
and she gets along with
pretty much everyone.

18
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,240
[HASEBE]
If I'm being honest,

19
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,070
she kinda makes
me uncomfortable.

20
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,820
[MIYAKE]
Really? How do you mean?

21
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,950
[HASEBE] It's not like I
hate her, don't get me wrong.

22
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,660
It's just that she seems way
too perfect at everything.

23
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,290
It's like she's not
even a real person.

24
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:25,540
People have to have a few flaws
to be likable, you know?

25
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,130
Right, when someone
seems like a total saint,

26
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,670
it makes you suspicious.

27
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,380
I get what you're saying.

28
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,050
But not everybody who's nice
has some ulterior motive.

29
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,560
Regardless, if we
make it to Class C,

30
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,220
we'll end up facing
off against her.

31
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:43,060
I wouldn't get too close
to her if I were you.

32
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,810
Forget about that for now!

33
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,110
Christmas is right
around the corner, guys!

34
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,150
Aren't you excited?

35
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,530
[YUKIMURA] I don't see how
that's pertinent at all.

36
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,360
[HASEBE]
Where's your festive spirit?

37
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:57,200
And for your information, I've
been seeing a lot more couples.

38
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,780
Hey, Kiyotaka.

39
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,410
Um. Do you have
any Christmas plans?

40
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,660
I mean...

41
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,040
Who, me?

42
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,290
Oh, Airi! So that's
your type, huh?

43
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,290
[SAKURA]
Uh, no!

44
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,750
I see you.

45
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,800
[SAKURA]
That's not what I meant at all!

46
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,380
Yeah. I was just wondering
what he was doing!

47
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,890
[HASEBE]
Really?

48
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,100
[AYANOKOJI]
Hm...

49
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,980
[phone chimes]

50
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:12,210
Whoa, and she said
that to your face?

51
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:15,000
[KARUIZAWA]
Mm-hm! Then I told her...

52
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,720
Is something wrong?

53
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,390
Oh, nothing! Let's go!

54
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,230
[AYANOKOJI] Someone from
Class C was tailing you?

55
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,030
Uh-huh. What do you
think I should do?

56
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,320
[AYANOKOJI] I doubt
they're gonna do anything

57
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,200
more than keep watch.

58
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,120
You can just ignore them.

59
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,530
All right. I will, then.

60
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,000
[AYANOKOJI] While I have you,
that thing I asked you about--

61
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,120
any luck on your end?

62
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,710
[KARUIZAWA]
Oh. Yeah.

63
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,670
Turns out, you were right,
there was a strange girl

64
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,960
following your study
group around today.

65
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,960
[KARUIZAWA] Just like
you said in your email.

66
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,380
There she was.

67
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,800
[KARUIZAWA] But the weird thing
is, she wasn't from Class C.

68
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:08,520
I've seen her around before,
and I think she's from Class A.

69
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,020
[AYANOKOJI]
I see.

70
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,730
Yeah. I managed
to get a picture.

71
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,780
I'll send it to you,
but why would Class A want--

72
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,030
[phone clicks]

73
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,490
Seriously, dude? Come on!

74
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:24,910
[phone beeps]

75
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,950
[AYANOKOJI]
Class A, huh?

76
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,410
What is Sakayanagi planning?

77
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,790
[STUDENTS chattering]

78
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,090
Good grief.

79
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,420
What the hell's wrong with
those Class C jerks?

80
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,300
What's up, big K?

81
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,430
They've been tryin' non-stop
to pick fights with me

82
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,890
the entire day.

83
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,810
Just making sure, you didn't
hurt any of them, did you?

84
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,310
Of course, I didn't!

85
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,640
I just ignored 'em
and walked away.

86
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,520
The Ken'll never break
his word, no matter what!

87
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,190
[AYANOKOJI]
You've got a well-trained dog.

88
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,820
Well... He has gotten better,
but not by much.

89
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,410
Sudo isn't alone, either.

90
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,330
A number of our students
have been provoked, too.

91
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,950
[AYANOKOJI] Seems like
Class C's up to something.

92
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,080
They've been getting
more active, lately.

93
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:17,170
It's retaliation. We managed
to win a lot of points

94
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,380
from them during
the Paper Shuffle.

95
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,130
That's enough for
Ryuen to target us.

96
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,140
It's clear that he's
after something else.

97
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,510
It's pretty obvious.

98
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,560
Ryuen is trying to
figure out the identity

99
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,020
of Class D's mastermind.

100
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,520
But that person is you.

101
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,860
He's not falling for
that trick anymore.

102
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,610
He's realized that I
was just a figurehead.

103
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,610
[AYANOKOJI]
There's no way he knows that.

104
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,650
[SUZUNE] Unlike the others
from our class,

105
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,410
Class C hasn't
bothered me even once.

106
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,910
Ah, I see.

107
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,660
What's the plan?
How do we fight back?

108
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,790
There's no plan.

109
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,620
Leaving me out
of the loop as usual.

110
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,960
Don't know why
I expected different.

111
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:03,090
But I can still count on
you to help me, right?

112
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:06,300
In bringing this class up
to Class A's position?

113
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:10,470
Sure. I don't see any real
reason not to help you out.

114
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,560
[AYANOKOJI]
What's this?

115
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,480
It's due back today.

116
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,320
Could you return it
to the library for me?

117
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,940
Why would I do that?

118
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:26,240
Come on, you said you
wanted to read it, right?

119
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,780
If you want to check it out,

120
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,700
this is the most efficient
way of doing that.

121
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,910
Obviously, you don't
have to say yes.

122
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,120
It's not a big deal for me
to stop by the library

123
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,540
and return it myself.

124
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,420
Though, with a book
as popular as this one,

125
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,710
who's to say if you'll even
get a chance to check it out

126
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,210
before it's snatched up?

127
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,920
So why don't you
save us both a hassle

128
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,090
and take it to the librar--

129
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,680
All right.

130
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,010
I'll take it off
your hands, then.

131

[SUZUNE]
Please do.

132
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,680
You can return it
any time today,

133
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,850
but make sure it's in
before they close.

I really appreciate your help.

I wasn't planning on reading it.

in the wrong section,

[gasps] Wait a sec!

153
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:56,910
That's <i>Farewell My Lovely</i> by
Raymond Chandler, isn't it?

Correct.

Not yet.

159
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,380
Though, I've heard good
things about her work.

160
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,920
[HIYORI]
In that case,

161
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:12,510
I recommend starting with
her <i>Lord Peter</i> series!

162
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,680
It was her debut novel!

163
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,180
Okay.

164
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,640
Oh. I just thought
you were looking around

165
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,560
for more books to check out.

166
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,900
I hope I'm not being too pushy.

167
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,770
No. I appreciate
the recommendation.

168
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,110
I'm more than happy to help out!

169
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,650
I get lonely.

170
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,780
There's no one to talk about
books with in my class.

171
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,830
And Ryuen? I was
under the impression

172
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,830
that Class D had someone you
were fervently searching for.

173
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,540
I believe I'm a prime suspect.

174
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:47,210
Don't worry about all that!
Infighting between classes?

175
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:49,760
I couldn't care less
who ends up on top.

176
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,380
All right, then.

177
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,380
Honestly, I would prefer it

178
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,760
if everyone got along
with each other.

179
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:07,150
Well, that's quite the
unexpected coincidence.

180
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,150
I've been looking
for you, Ayanokoji.

181
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,530
[AYANOKOJI]
Really? What for?

182
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:19,370
We need to talk in
private. Come with me.

183
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,420
You know, I'm supposed
to be meeting up

184
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,290
with some friends right now.

185
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,210
I'm afraid this conversation
is not optional.

186
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:31,460
It pertains to your future here.

187
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,970
[AYANOKOJI]
A reception room?

188
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,470
[CHABASHIRA]
Yes. You have a visitor.

189
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,350
[AYANOKOJI]
And they wanted me?

190
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,450
As you requested,
I've brought your son.

191
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,460
[CHABASHIRA]
If that's all, I'll be going.

192
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,670
[AYANOKOJI'S FATHER]
Finally. Kiyotaka.

193
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,110
[AYANOKOJI] It's been a year
and a half or so since I left.

194
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,110
[AYANOKOJI'S FATHER] Why don't
you make yourself comfortable?

195
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,200
I don't have any intentions
of staying here

196
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,540
longer than I have to.

197
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,290
[AYANOKOJI'S FATHER] A man is
dead because of your actions.

198
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:51,500
I'm sure you remember
the butler, Matsuo?

199
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,050
He was the person
who first told you

200
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,090
about this school, after all.

201
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,260
And then, of course,
he helped you

202
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,760
make your escape
from the White Room.

203
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,890
Because of his insubordination,

204
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,010
I had no choice
but to dismiss him.

205
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,270
And?

206
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:10,060
Last month, the man
set himself on fire.

207
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,320
Naturally, his death
is a tragedy.

208
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,440
As you can imagine,
his family is quite distraught.

209
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,570
And all of it could
have been avoided

210
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,860
if you hadn't insisted
on defying my orders

211
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,740
by enrolling here.

212
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,660
[AYANOKOJI'S FATHER]
I wasn't expecting your

213
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,910
shocking indifference
to the news.

214
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,960
You didn't seriously
think I'd feel guilty

215
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,170
over something like that?
Please, I am not that naive.

216
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,300
Kiyotaka. Explain this to me.

217
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,680
What in the world inspired you
to come to this school?

218
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,430
You did, actually.

219
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:47,560
You kept talking about how you
gave us the ultimate education.

220
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,770
So, naturally,
I took an interest

221
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:52,480
in the "worldly society"
that you rejected.

222
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,150
To see it for myself.

223
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,400
[AYANOKOJI'S FATHER]
There is no greater path

224
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,440
than the one I laid
out before you.

225
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:00,200
Surely, you can
appreciate that by now.

226
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,070
Sorry to disappoint you.

227
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,160
But I'll choose my own path.

228
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,620
[AYANOKOJI'S FATHER]
I've already wasted enough time

229
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,660
by coming here.

230
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:13,080
I want you to sign
this, Kiyotaka.

231
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,590
I see no reason for me
to leave this school.

232
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,710
This isn't a request.

233
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,010
I get that you're used to
having your orders followed.

234
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:24,640
But your authority doesn't
extend past the White Room.

235
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,680
Speaking of which,
the White Room

236
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,480
has resumed operations.

237
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,890
So, you can just
leave me alone, then.

238
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,770
[AYANOKOJI'S FATHER] I have yet
to witness another talent

239
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,440
comparable to yours.

240
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,030
You are my finest work to date.

241
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:41,240
And my most prized possession.

242
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,610
Oh, spare me.

243
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,830
Next, you'll tell me
it's because I'm your son.

244
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,290
[AYANOKOJI'S FATHER] I wouldn't
even bother wasting my breath.

245
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,370
Neither of us would
believe it anyway.

246
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,170
Guess that's true enough.

247
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,880
This will be my final warning.

248
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,550
Sign the form and
withdraw from school.

249
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,930
You're in no position to refuse.

250
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,720
[knocking]

251
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,310
[CHAIRMAN SAKAYANAGI]
Excuse me.

252
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,940
It's good to see you.

253
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,520
Mr. Ayanokoji.

254
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,310
This is a surprise.

255
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,150
How long has it
been, Sakayanagi?

256
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,070
Seven or eight years
now, I think.

257
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,610
Although, I must say, it feels
like it was only yesterday

258
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,120
that I left my post to become
this school's chairman.

259
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,910
[AYANOKOJI]
Sakayanagi?

260
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,250
I don't believe
we've met before.

261
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,210
A pleasure.

262
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:36,710
Same to you.

263
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,800
So, the principal already
filled me in on the details.

264
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,550
As I understand it,
you'd like your son

265
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,590
to be withdrawn from school.

266
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:44,970
I would.

267
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,720
I've put in an official request,
which means you have

268
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,970
a responsibility to
release him back to me.

269
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,980
That's incorrect.

270
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,270
Ordinarily, it would
work that way.

271
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,940
But this school prioritizes
its students' independence

272
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,610
above all else.

273
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,530
So now you're adhering
to the rules?

274
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,110
[CHAIRMAN SAKAYANAGI]
What does that mean?

275
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,950
It's no big secret
that the interviews

276
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,620
and entrance exams
are mere formalities.

277
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,700
So, I ask you, how did Kiyotaka,

278
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:14,410
who wasn't initially enrolled,
manage to get accepted?

279
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,590
Looks like you're
as well informed as ever.

280
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,750
Nothing gets past you.

281
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,920
Someone gave him
a recommendation,

282
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:25,840
which allowed him to
register with the school.

283
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,890
So, it seems to me,
someone circumvented the rules

284
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:29,970
and took in a student

285
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:32,510
who would've otherwise
been rejected.

286
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,850
[CHAIRMAN SAKAYANAGI]
Yes, it's true.

287
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:37,060
Your son wasn't originally
on our acceptance list.

288
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,190
However, after giving
it some thought,

289
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,440
I decided to approve
his enrollment.

290
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,530
And now that he's
one of our students,

291
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:47,530
I'm afraid I'm duty-bound
to protect him.

292
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:50,700
And unless he personally
expresses a desire to withdraw,

293
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,410
I'll have to deny your request.

294
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,210
That's nothing more than
sophistry and you know it.

295
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:59,540
And just when I thought you
couldn't disappoint me further.

296
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:02,670
Your complaint is noted.

297
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,670
Have it your way.
I'll leave for now.

298
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,970
But I would not get
too comfortable.

299
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:18,020
Mark my words,
you will return to me.

300
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,610
[sighs] Even after
all these years,

301
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,360
that man is still
a pain to deal with.

302
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,450
This must've been
hard on you, too.

303
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,200
I'm fine. Really, I am.

304
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,960
Chairman, I have a question,
if you don't mind.

305
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,370
Yes?

306
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:41,080
It's about a first-year
student in Class A.

307
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:47,050
Do you mean Arisu?
Yes, she is my daughter.

308
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,800
And I know what
you're thinking!

309
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,340
I don't give her
any special treatment.

310
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,510
As part of this
school's administration.

311
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,470
I have to remain impartial.

312
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,600
I'm bound by the
school's regulations.

313
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,520
[AYANOKOJI] In other words,
he can only offer help

314
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,570
as long as it falls
within the rules.

315
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:04,900
By the way,

316
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,990
I've been wanting to meet
you for quite some time.

317
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:11,110
I'm guessing you know
about the White Room, then?

318
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,240
I wouldn't spend any more
effort thinking about that.

319
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:16,120
You're better served
focusing your energy

320
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,330
on your studies here.

321
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:20,460
It'll be worth it.
You'll see soon enough.

322
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,510
How was it seeing
your father again?

323
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,970
You don't need to
keep playing pretend.

324
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,100
I had always suspected
you were lying to me,

325
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,270
but this was just the
confirmation that I needed.

326
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,640
Oh?

327
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:45,400
The truth is, you have no
connection to my father.

328
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,900
And what makes you
so sure of that?

329
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,740
Even now, you're
refusing to admit it.

330
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:55,160
I figured it out after
talking to the chairman.

331
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,490
For some reason, you're obsessed
with getting to Class A.

332
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,830
The problem is, you've
never been lucky enough

333
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,460
to get the right students.

334
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,250
Until this year, that is.

335
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:13,220
As Class D's homeroom teacher,
you had easy access to my files.

336
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,010
And you came up
with a plan to use me.

337
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:20,310
Even if it meant lying about
my father and threatening me.

338
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,600
It's too bad.

339
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,850
If he hadn't come
to meet me today,

340
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,440
I might still have
been your pawn.

341
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,070
[CHABASHIRA]
I see.

342
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:31,610
Somehow, you've gotten
the chairman on your side.

343
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,450
[AYANOKOJI] The truth is,
you never had the authority

344
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,160
to have me expelled.

345
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,080
Which means I don't have to do
what you ask anymore.

346
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,490
Don't tell me you're
going to give up

347
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,700
on getting up to Class A.

348
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,500
Your class is starting
to work together,

349
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,960
and you want to
throw that all away?

350
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,420
Just don't count on me
getting involved anymore.

351
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,840
Also, I'd rather
you not bother me

352
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,590
with your personal
endeavors again.

353
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,600
Ayanokoji! What are you
going to do now?

354
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:06,900
[phone ringing]

355
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,520
[KARUIZAWA]
What's up?

356
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,440
[AYANOKOJI] I was just
thinking about you.

357
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,110
As if I'd believe that!

358
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,900
The only time you ever call
is when you need me

359
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,950
to do something shady!

360
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,410
[AYANOKOJI]
Guess that's true.

361
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,780
Have Manabe and the
others tried anything?

362
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,910
[KARUIZAWA]
Nah. Hold on a second,

363
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,040
you didn't really just call me

364
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,380
to make sure I was
all right, did you?

365
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:31,000
While I've got you,
can I ask you a question?

366
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:34,260
It's something that I've been
thinking about for a while now.

367
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,510
[AYANOKOJI]
What is it?

368
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,300
Is there a reason you
don't just tell people

369
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,350
how smart you actually are?

370
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,970
[KARUIZAWA] If you were
as outgoing as Yosuke is,

371
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:45,850
I bet you'd be pretty popular!

372
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:47,230
And I'm sure
everybody in class

373
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,190
would like you a
whole lot more, too!

374
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,940
I think you could even
be like a schoolwide

375
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,690
celebrity or something!

376
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,900
Remember the sports festival?

377
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,110
[AYANOKOJI]
The attention would be annoying.

378
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,620
I'd prefer to stay anonymous
for as long as possible.

379
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,910
It just feels like such a waste.
You're actually really good at--

380
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,210
[AYANOKOJI]
Karuizawa.

381
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,000
[KARUIZAWA sighs]
What?

382
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,710
To tell you the truth,

383
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:13,880
the real reason I called you
was so that I could apologize.

384
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,300
[KARUIZAWA]
Apologize?

385
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,470
Yes. It's my fault that you're
now a potential target.

386
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:23,470
[KARUIZAWA] Huh?
Where's all this coming from?

387
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,770
[AYANOKOJI] Things've changed,
there's no need for me

388
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,600
to try to bring up
Class D's standing anymore.

389
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:32,070
What was motivating me
before is gone.

390
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,570
[KARUIZAWA]
I see.

391
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:36,150
So, you're gonna go back
to laying low from now on?

392
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,200
Yeah. I'll leave it up
to Horikita and Hirata

393
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,990
to take care of everything.

394
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:43,120
[KARUIZAWA]
Makes sense.

395
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,490
Well, this means you're
free now, doesn't it?

396
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,370
[AYANOKOJI]
I guess it does.

397
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,130
Although, there's something
you should know.

398
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,420
I won't be contacting
you again.

399
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:59,550
[gasps] Wait, hold on!

400
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,550
What did you just say?

401
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,470
[AYANOKOJI]
Oh, did the line cut out?

402
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,310
I was just saying that
this is the last time

403
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:08,600
that I'd be calling you.

404
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,690
I won't be asking you
for any more favors,

405
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,730
so there's no point.

406
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:15,900
[KARUIZAWA]
Oh, right! Of course.

407
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,190
Yeah, that makes a lot
of sense, I guess.

408
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,280
[AYANOKOJI] Obviously, if
anything unexpected happens,

409
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:24,580
I'll help you just
like I promised.

410
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,200
It'll be safest if you delete
anything that links us.

411
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,790
You can keep my
emergency contact,

412
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,000
but everything else has to go.

413
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,540
Wait, are you sure?

414
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:33,840
[AYANOKOJI]
I've already completely erased

415
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,210
your contact
information on my end.

416
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,760
Just hold on a second!

417
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,630
Why are you acting like this
doesn't matter to you?

418
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,470
[AYANOKOJI]
What do you mean?

419
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,760
I totally get it.

420
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,850
But, do we have
to be strangers again?

421
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,140
[AYANOKOJI] Our relationship
was purely transactional

422
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,770
from the very beginning.

423
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:52,900
I was under the impression

424
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,980
you didn't like being
my pawn, either.

425
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:57,570
Of course not, obviously.

426
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,940
[AYANOKOJI]
Are you sure about that?

427
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:01,740
[KARUIZAWA]
As if! You're delusional!

428
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,660
Then I don't see
what the problem is.

429
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,660
Goodbye.

430
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,330
[gasps]
