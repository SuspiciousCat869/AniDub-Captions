1
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,030
[RYUEN] You can make this easier
on yourself, Karuizawa.

2
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,740
Why do you insist on putting
yourself through all this pain?

3
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,120
You're holding out
hope for someone

4
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,790
to come and save you.

5
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,590
Now that you're no longer
useful, you've been abandoned.

6
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:44,750
[KARUIZAWA gasps]

7
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,140
[RYUEN]
Come on.

8
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,980
Just tell me the name of
the mastermind, already!

9
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,780
Let's get this over with.

10
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,940
I'm curious, Karuizawa.

11
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,870
Back during the
cruise ship exam,

12
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,700
you agreed to
meet up with Hirata,

13
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,160
but were ambushed
by Manabe and her friends.

14
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,290
Any guesses why that happened?

15
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,500
Your precious mastermind
set you up.

16
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,380
He orchestrated it so he
could turn you into his pawn,

17
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,800
and you fell right
into his trap.

18
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,220
You're wrong.

19
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,640
[RYUEN] Do you get it now?
You have no value to him.

20
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,730
He won't be coming.

21
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:09,400
[KARUIZAWA] That can't be.
Ryuen's lying to me.

22
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,020
There's no way.

23
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,360
Was I just deluding myself?

24
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,940
He promised that
he'd protect me.

25
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,410
There's only one way you're
getting out of this situation.

26
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,080
So, tell me.

27
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,200
His name. Right?

28
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,830
Exactly.

29
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:29,040
All you have to do
is tell me who he is.

30
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,090
If you do that,
I promise I won't touch

31
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,960
another hair on your head.

32
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:37,380
But, if you refuse,
I'll keep going.

33
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:40,510
I'll drive you to
the brink of insanity,

34
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,810
and plunge you into hell.

35
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,810
And I'll see to it that
you drop out of school.

36
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:51,900
Now. Give me the
mastermind's name.

37
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:57,570
[KARUIZAWA] If I tell him...
will all of this really go away?

38
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:03,240
Ah, will I go back
to the way I was then?

39
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,830
His... name.

40
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,120
[RYUEN]
That's a good girl.

41
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,500
[KARUIZAWA]
I won't.

42
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,960
Even if it means that
I'll be losing my safe place

43
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,380
at this school, and that this
nightmare keeps on going.

44
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,090
No matter what.

45
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,850
I'll never tell.

46
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,270
Do your worst. I don't care.

47
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,350
[KARUIZAWA gasps]

48
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,560
Why go to such lengths

49
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,360
to protect someone who
made you their pawn?

50
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,780
Who knows? I wish
I could tell you.

51
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,450
I guess, even after
everything, somehow I...

52
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,240
I just can't bring
myself to betray him.

53
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,200
[RYUEN] Stubborn to the
very end. Huh, Karuizawa?

54
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:51,460
Yes. I don't care if
I end up regretting it.

55
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,170
I won't give in.

56
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,800
Your loyalty is admirable
in its own pathetic way.

57
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,590
But face it, he doesn't
care about you.

58
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,800
Too bad.

59
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,760
This is the end of
the road, Karuizawa.

60
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:07,890
Because I am going
to destroy you now.

61
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:11,810
[KARUIZAWA] I accept this.
I don't mind it at all.

62
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,440
As long as I can still help him.

63
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,190
That's enough for me.

64
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:20,190
I'm sorry, this is the
only thing I can do.

65
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,030
For as long as I can
remember, my entire life's

66
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,820
been nothing but
a pointless marathon.

67
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,790
But teaming up with Kiyotaka
to do all that stuff,

68
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,620
it was actually kind of fun.

69
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:35,040
That's why I don't
regret anything.

70
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,130
[KARUIZAWA]
Although,

71
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:43,180
if I'm being honest, a part of
me believed that he would

72
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:47,060
really keep his promise and
come running here to rescue me.

73
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,230
[KARUIZAWA] It's true that
you reap what you sow.

74
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:57,520
I deserve this.
Farewell to my fake self.

75
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,780
[HASEBE]
If we're gonna do karaoke.

76
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,240
I say we make it interesting
and compete for points!

77
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,830
Uh. No thanks, I'm good.

78
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,500
[SAKURA] You've been quiet.
Is something wrong?

79
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,750
Sorry. I'm gonna have to pass.

80
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,130
--[HASEBE] Really?
--[MIYAKE] You okay, dude?

81
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:23,300
I didn't sleep well last night
and it's catching up with me.

82
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,760
That sucks.

83
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,350
Go on without me,
I'll join next time.

84
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,560
[SAKURA]
Oh. Sure.

85
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,940
So what's this
"emergency" of yours?

86
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,230
I'm waiting.

87
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,530
A warning. There's
something going on

88
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:47,490
that I believe you
ought to know about.

89
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:50,330
If you do nothing,
then, after today,

90
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,870
Class D will lose any chance
it had of ever advancing.

91
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,750
Well, I'm listening.

92
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:59,750
You see, Ryuen is
targeting Karuizawa.

93
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,550
He wants to put on one of
his little plays, no doubt.

94
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,170
Your point?

95
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,010
If Ryuen manages
to break her spirit,

96
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:10,010
she'll likely drop
out of school.

97
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,100
And Class D won't be able
to recover from that loss.

98
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,600
You can stop
with the theatrics.

99
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,140
I know what you want.

100
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,770
To force me to save Karuizawa.

101
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,610
If I ask for your assistance,
would you help me?

102
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:26,280
[CHABASHIRA] You're expecting
too much. It's school policy.

103
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,490
Teachers can't meddle
in students' affairs,

104
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:30,910
not without a
damn good reason.

105
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,490
I wouldn't say that.

106
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,290
[CHABASHIRA]
What do you mean?

107
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,540
Well, I haven't asked you
to do anything yet. Right?

108
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,210
Correct.

109
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:43,300
[AYANOKOJI] Aren't you curious?
How this situation turns out?

110
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,390
[AYANOKOJI]
Sorry to make you wait.

111
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:57,480
[CHABASHIRA]
Manabu Horikita? Is this a joke?

112
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,980
What is he doing here?

113
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,440
Don't tell me he's
going to stop them.

114
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,190
Of course I'm not.

115
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:07,570
My only purpose here is
to deal with the aftermath.

116
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:11,660
Also, if the school has to
get involved in the matter,

117
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,120
he's agreed to testify
that Ryuen and Class C

118
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,700
started it all.

119
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:20,830
Consider it done. Don't
forget your promise to me.

120
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,290
Right. I'll do whatever I can

121
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,510
to help your sister get
onto the student council.

122
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,800
[MANABU]
So, we understand each other.

123
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,880
[AYANOKOJI] In that case,
whatever comes next

124
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,470
is up to you.

125
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,430
What do you plan on doing?

126
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:40,480
Tell me, how exactly do you
intend to resolve all this?

127
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,900
I see.

128
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,730
It seems his aim is to end
this conflict by himself.

129
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,990
No way.

130
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,780
I don't understand.

131
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:52,070
Is he planning to thwart
Ryuen's group all alone?

132
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,710
[AYANOKOJI]
Just relax.

133
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,840
I'm the one you're waiting for.

134
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,730
[RYUEN] Too bad. This is the
end of the road, Karuizawa.

135
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,190
Because I am going
to destroy you now.

136
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:28,230
[KARUIZAWA] I deserve this.
Farewell to my fake self.

137
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,910
Why are you here?

138
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,830
[KARUIZAWA]
You came.

139
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:46,090
Ayanokoji?

140
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:48,000
Forgive me, Karuizawa.

141
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,300
For being late.

142
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,970
But why are you...?
What are you doing here?

143
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,930
I promised you
if anything happened,

144
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,430
I'd be there to protect you.

145
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,810
Karuizawa sent me a message.

146
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:04,690
Asking me for my assistance.

147
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,270
Which means,
I'm the "mastermind"

148
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,070
who you've been looking
for this entire time.

149
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,110
You've gotta be kidding!

150
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,070
There's no way that you're
the person we're after!

151
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,700
Back on the island,

152
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,240
you didn't even think
twice before accepting.

153
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:19,830
During that test,

154
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,370
the camera you hid away
stopped working.

155
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,870
What? How'd you know?

156
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,750
[AYANOKOJI] Because I'm
the one who broke it.

157
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,800
I'm sure you just thought
it was caused by the rain.

158
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,050
[gasps]

159
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:39,050
The fear in her eyes has
completely disappeared.

160
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,520
So, it really is you.

161
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,020
The person controlling
Class D behind the scenes.

162
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,060
But, Ayanokoji,

163
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:51,280
I have to say, I expected
so much more from you.

164
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,450
I'm honestly
kind of disappointed.

165
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,280
Surely, you must know
that your best move

166
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:03,160
at this stage of the game is to
sacrifice your little pawn here.

167
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,750
But instead, you've decided
to throw yourself

168
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,960
into the lion's den.

169
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,710
I'm dying to know.

170
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:12,250
What plan have you cooked up
to get out of this?

171
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:16,970
Sorry. I don't have a plan.

172
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:22,310
There's no need. I just
came to get Karuizawa.

173
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,980
[RYUEN]
Hold your horses!

174
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,480
Why don't we play
a little first?

175
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,230
You must not think
very highly of us.

176
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:31,690
You see, that hurts
our feelings.

177
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,950
Wait! Don't do this!

178
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,870
In this world, there's
nothing more effective

179
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,790
than the power of violence.

180
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,920
No matter what clever
tricks you try to pull.

181
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,590
They'll be crushed before
the might of absolute violence.

182
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:02,300
[RYUEN] It looks like you still
have some fight left in you.

183
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:05,310
Don't worry, though,
I'll break that soon enough,

184
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:08,100
and that'll be
the end of Class D.

185
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:10,860
I don't suppose you'd
be willing to negotiate?

186
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,230
[RYUEN] Heh. You should've
thought about that

187
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,280
before you came alone.
Too late now.

188
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,990
I think there's been
some confusion.

189
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,530
I'm not the one in trouble here.

190
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,740
What?

191
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:25,080
There are only four of you.

192
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,120
You'll need more than that.

193
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:32,250
[RYUEN laughs]

194
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,130
Ishizaki.

195
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,630
[ISHIZAKI]
It's nothing personal.

196
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,340
I'm sure you understand.

197
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,640
[gasps] Ishizaki!

198
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:48,890
[ISHIZAKI grunts]

199
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,690
Impossible!

200
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,110
Hey, you better
take this seriously!

201
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,540
No way.

202
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:18,210
[ISHIZAKI] I'm gonna make
you pay for that!

203
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,220
[AYANOKOJI] You shouldn't
shout before you attack.

204
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,510
[ISHIZAKI yells]

205
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:26,220
[ALBERT groans]

206
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,100
Not bad!

207
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:35,400
You're much better than
I imagined you'd be.

208
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,030
[IBUKI]
Wait, was he always this strong?

209
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,280
So, have you
figured it out yet?

210
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,740
A situation where violence
is the only way to resolve it.

211
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,410
That's what I've wanted
from the beginning.

212
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:47,870
Huh?

213
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:48,950
[AYANOKOJI]
If my goal really was

214
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,120
to keep my identity a secret,

215
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:54,170
I never would've used
Manabe in the first place.

216
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,750
This whole time you've
been operating under

217
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,920
the assumption that I was
afraid of being discovered.

218
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,180
But that was all just an act
to draw me into a trap, right?

219
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,010
Took you long enough.

220
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,680
I'm surprised you didn't
figure it out sooner.

221
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,100
Is that so?

222
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,060
You're telling me that
we've just been dancing

223
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,560
in the palm of your hand?

224
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,310
What do you think
of that, Ibuki?

225
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,820
[gasps]

226
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:22,070
You are messed up.
Both you and Ayanokoji!

227
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:25,660
Just shut up!

228
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,580
I don't get what's going on.
But you're annoying!

229
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,300
[RYUEN]
I underestimated you.

230
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,300
I see that now.

231
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,550
And yet you've managed
to remain relatively calm.

232
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,050
Impressive.

233
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,430
Yeah, I wouldn't act like
I've already won, if I were you.

234
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:52,060
There's more to fighting
than fancy moves.

235
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,860
[coughs]

236
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,900
Not bad. Really.

237
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:07,120
You having as much fun as I am?

238
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,450
Let's keep on going.
I could do this all day!

239
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,910
Do you get it now?
This is all a game to me!

240
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,040
Everything, from crushing
the other classes,

241
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:21,170
and even luring out
Class D's mastermind.

242
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,680
Don't tell me this is
everything you've got!

243
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,890
Come on, entertain me!

244
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:35,770
[AYANOKOJI] He hasn't had
any formal training.

245
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:39,940
He's using his own unique style,
developed from actual fights.

246
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,360
Tell me, if you're as
good as you claim to be.

247
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,950
Why won't you fight out in the
open where others can see you?

248
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:48,620
I simply don't
wish to, that's all.

249
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,530
[RYUEN]
Then I'll have to make you!

250
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,450
[gasps]

251
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:52,790
[RYUEN]
No matter what it takes,

252
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:55,620
I'll drag you out and
force you into the light!

253
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,750
[RYUEN grunts]

254
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,590
Do you honestly think
you can still win?

255
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,470
[RYUEN]
Of course!

256
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,470
Losing was never an option!

257
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,350
Forgive me.

258
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:20,690
But I just don't
see that happening.

259
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:24,270
[RYUEN] You may beat me
today, that much is true.

260
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,400
But what about tomorrow?
Or the day after that?

261
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:31,030
So, you plan on
continuing this farce?

262
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,660
Sure do.

263
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,160
I'll be there 24/7,
waiting to strike

264
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,710
when you least expect it.

265
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,420
It seems you're not
afraid of failure.

266
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:48,470
[RYUEN] 'Course not!
What is there to be afraid of?

267
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,220
I've never felt fear
once in my life!

268
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:58,180
[RYUEN] Fear and pleasure are
just two sides of the same coin.

269
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:01,350
Emotions separated
by a hair's breadth.

270
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,110
[RYUEN]
Although people try to deny it,

271
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,530
this world runs on violence.

272
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,360
And a person's
strength is determined

273
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,700
by their capacity for it.

274
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,280
The truth is, there's only
one thing that can overturn

275
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:18,500
that law of nature,
and that is the power of death.

276
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,590
Fear is the natural
response of the weak!

277
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:26,210
It's simple: if you subject
a person to pain,

278
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,510
it's only a matter of time
before it turns to fear.

279
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,090
Interesting.

280
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,760
In that case, why don't you let
me test out your little theory?

281
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:36,470
[laughs] If that's
what you want.

282
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,810
I'm more than happy to oblige!

283
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,860
No! Kiyotaka!

284
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:52,240
Do you feel it now?

285
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,280
If I'm being completely
honest with you,

286
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,290
I've been trying to
experience this "fear"

287
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,790
you keep talking about.

288
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:03,120
Unfortunately,
I haven't felt it.

289
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,750
Don't lie to me!

290
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,760
[RYUEN groans]

291
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,890
[RYUEN]
Truly. You're something special.

292
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,810
Given all the power you
have at your disposal,

293
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,690
I don't understand
why you waste your time

294
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:30,110
with the garbage in Class D.

295
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:33,110
I can't say I've ever
thought about it that way.

296
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,450
I don't believe
that for a second.

297
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,450
[AYANOKOJI]
That's enough. Don't you think?

298
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,140
I believe you told me
earlier that you've

299
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,220
never once felt fear before.

300
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:04,180
[panting] You're damned right!

301
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,480
Sure, it hurts a little,
but that's it.

302
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:13,740
So, you're gonna have to do
a lot better than that.

303
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:21,240
Even if you beat me this time,
I'll never give up.

304
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,700
Ma-Mark my words!

305
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,500
No matter the time or place.

306
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,170
I'll be watching.

307
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,710
Waiting for my moment.

308
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:36,050
Of course, in the end, I'll be
the one who comes out on top!

309
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:39,680
All that's left is for you
to savor this moment.

310
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,810
Victory is just
within your grasp,

311
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,100
however fleeting it may be!

312
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,520
So, go on, Ayanokoji!

313
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:52,320
Show me exactly what
you're feeling right now!

314
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,570
Is it joy? Or anger?

315
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,610
Maybe even annoyance?

316
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,030
I want to see all the emotions
you're experiencing!

317
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:09,080
I don't have any idea
what you're talking about.

318
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:17,720
Why would a mundane task
like this make me feel anything?

319
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,760
[AYANOKOJI] There's no
emotion for me to show you.

320
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:32,110
[sputtering]

321
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:36,400
Yeah. I suspected
that this might happen.

322
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:37,820
[RYUEN sputters]

323
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,330
By now I'd think you'd realize

324
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:50,540
that even you have the
capacity to feel fear.

325
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:00,340
Kiyotaka.

326
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,980
I'm sorry for letting
you suffer for so long.

327
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,390
I'll be okay.

328
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,900
It's just that my legs are
still numb from the cold.

329
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,230
You must be disappointed.

330
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,360
Well, who wouldn't be?

331
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,200
You were using me
from the beginning.

332
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,780
That makes sense.

333
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:25,790
But then why didn't
you sell me out?

334
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,830
For myself.

335
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:30,160
That's it, no one else.

336
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,500
[KARUIZAWA]
I was so scared!

337
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:38,590
I really thought you
weren't coming!

338
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:41,760
You're okay. It's all over now.

339
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,800
I want you to know,
as of this moment,

340
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:48,810
the chains of your past that
once bound you are gone.

341
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:52,900
It's my fault that you got hurt.

342
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,980
I won't ask for
your forgiveness.

343
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:58,900
I just want you
to remember one thing.

344
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,200
Like today,
if anything happens,

345
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,450
I'll be there to save you,
no matter what.

346
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:07,950
You better. Okay?

347
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,750
[AYANOKOJI]
This will do.
