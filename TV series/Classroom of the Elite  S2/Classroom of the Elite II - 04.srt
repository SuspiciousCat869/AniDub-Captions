1
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,570
[KARUIZAWA] I don't get it.
What are you talking about?

2
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,530
What did the names of the groups
have to do with the VIPs?

3
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,450
Were they supposed to be a hint?

4
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,450
We already explained it to you.

5
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,080
Now, now.

6
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,790
Remember how the groups
were named after planets?

7
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,000
That, along with
the student's names,

8
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,960
was how the VIP was
chosen for each group.

9
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,590
You following so far?

10
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,130
[KARUIZAWA]
Mm.

11
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,090
[HIRATA] Mars is the fourth
planet from the sun.

12
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,010
If we sort that group into
Japanese alphabetical order,

13
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:59,100
it goes Ayanokoji, Ichinose,
Ibuki, and Karuizawa.

14
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,600
So that's why I was
picked to be the VIP.

15
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,940
In the Earth group,
Kushida was chosen.

16
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:07,360
Third name listed for the
third planet from the sun.

17
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,480
I get it now,

18
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,490
but doesn't that method
seem a little...

19
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,490
Simplistic.

20
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:12,860
Exactly!

21
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,870
It's only "simple"
once you know it.

22
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,240
Yeah.

23
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,000
It's a lot harder to figure
it out during the test.

24
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,120
Even if you saw the
pattern in your class,

25
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,630
there's no way you'd
be able to prove it.

26
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,880
That's right.

27
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,920
But Ryuen did, somehow.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,380
Based on their scores, Class C
must have found out the rule.

29
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,170
He still made a mistake.

30
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,260
I suspect that someone
sabotaged him.

31
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,350
From what it looks like,
he has all of Class C

32
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,020
under his control.
Who'd betray him?

33
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:45,730
It's just speculation, dictators
foster an unhappy populace.

34
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,690
What if the miscalculation
was because of

35
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,530
someone from another class?

36
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,400
[AYANOKOJI]
I wonder that, too.

37
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,320
[SUZUNE] Maybe, but I have
a hard time believing

38
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,490
that no one would
stand up to that bully.

39
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:58,030
[HIRATA]
You've got a good point.

40
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,330
I gotta say, I'm glad you
decided to come join us.

41
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,410
I mean it.

42
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,000
What choice did I have?

43
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,670
It's becoming apparent that
these exams require teamwork

44
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,040
to successfully clear.

45
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,300
That does seem like the trend.

46
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,090
So even if I don't like it,

47
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,550
it's important to
form connections

48
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,640
with the people
I need to rely on.

49
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,390
[AYANOKOJI]
Yes.

50
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,890
There are limits to what
a single person can do.

51
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,990
[CHABASHIRA] Today marks the
beginning of your second term.

52
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,990
Starting September
and continuing through

53
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:02,660
early October, you'll have
more gym classes than usual,

54
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,160
to prepare you for
the sports festival.

55
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,160
I've handed out your new
schedules along with

56
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,000
the rules for the festival.

57
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,710
You can find
the same information

58
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,130
posted on the school's website.

59
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,840
You may compare them
if you must.

60
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,420
'Scuse me!

61
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,470
Is the sports festival going to
be considered a special exam?

62
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:24,060
You're certainly free to think
of it as one, if it helps you.

63
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,810
Regardless of what you call it,

64
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:30,060
this will have a major influence
on your class's standing.

65
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,770
[SOTOMURA] This is cruel
and unusual punishment!

66
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,860
[KEN]
Yeah! My time to shine!

67
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,150
A sports festival.

68
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,780
[CHABASHIRA]
This year, the entire school

69
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,780
will be split into two teams.

70
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,740
Competing as either
Team Red or Team White.

71
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,200
All of you will be working
together with Class A

72
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,740
to make up Team Red.

73
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,750
We're teaming up with Class A?

74
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,620
With the second
and third years, too.

75
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,830
This sounds annoying.

76
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,380
Just leave it up to me,
I'll carry us to victory!

77

[STUDENTS chattering]

78
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:56,880
Hold on, guys!

79
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,760
Let's try to speak
one at a time.

80

Everyone! We can
discuss it later!

[STUDENTS chattering]

82
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,680
[AYANOKOJI]
You okay?

83
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,850
You're thinking about
how you'll finally

84
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,270
get a chance to see
him again, huh?

85
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,730
I don't have a clue
what you're talking about.

86
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,450
So, I'd drop it if I were you.

87
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,740
Right.

88
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,450
Make sure that you fully
understand the rules.

89
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,660
It says all events are
classified as either

90
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,290
"mandatory" or "voluntary."

91
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,000
[AYANOKOJI] Generally
speaking, voluntary events

92
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,750
award more points
for participating

93
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,090
than the mandatory ones.

94
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,300
As a word of advice,
you should try your hardest

95
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,590
to place well in every event.

96
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,680
The penalty for
losing is severe.

97
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,100
[IKE]
Question!

98
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,390
What's this about bonuses
for the top three places?

99
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,440
[YAMAUCHI] There's something
else about adding points

100
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,980
to written exams?

101
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,440
Think of it as an incentive
to win your events.

102
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,820
[YAMAUCHI]
Oh!

103
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,030
Those who do well enough
will be awarded bonus points

104
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,990
that can be added to
their next written exam.

105
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,620
I'm sure a number
of you could use them.

106
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,870
Seriously?

107
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,500
[STUDENTS gasp, chatter]

108
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,410
[AYANOKOJI]
Sounds too good to be true.

109
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,750
There has to be a catch.

110
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,500
Those who place
in the bottom ten

111
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,920
will be penalized.

112
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,760
Uh. Wait. Hold on a second.

113
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,840
It says there'll be a penalty?

114
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,510
The ten first-year students
in each event who perform

115
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,930
the worst will have ten points
deducted from their

116
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:34,140
total score on their
next written exam.

117
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,640
[STUDENTS]
Say what?!

118
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,610
So we can lose
exam points, too?

119
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:39,730
Dude, this sucks!

120
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,070
Why did they crush my dream?

121
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,360
Does that mean we can fail
even with a good score?

122
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,070
The handout I gave you
includes a list

123
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,410
of all the events.

124
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,950
It'll be up to you to pick
the ones you compete in.

125
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,500
[AYANOKOJI]
There are 13 events total.

126
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,000
This feels like a lot of events.

127
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,750
They expect us to do
all of this in one day?

128
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,250
Yes, of course.

129
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,050
The sports festival
will be the only thing

130
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,760
happening on that day.

131
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,300
Prepare yourselves.

132
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,640
Each event will be a test of
your strength and athleticism.

133
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,020
It'll be up to you to decide who
will participate in each event.

134
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,770
Once you've made
your selections,

turn it in to me.

are we expected to do?

It's all up to you.
Absolutely everything.

138
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,450
From how many voluntary
events you enter

139
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,570
to which heat each
person will be in.

[STUDENTS murmur]

141
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,830
[AYANOKOJI]
Hm...

142
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,880
[SUZUNE] In both of the
previous special exams,

143
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,550
there were multiple
ways to pass.

144
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,180
The school likes
to give us options.

145
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,180
That's why there has
to be more at play.

146
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,310
I dunno.

147
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,890
I've got a feeling
this sports festival

148
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,270
is going to be different
from the other tests.

149
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,480
You sure?

150
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,440
It seems like any other
special exam to me.

151
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,280
It's structured
just like the last two.

152
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,440
Each class can earn
or lose points.

153
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:10,820
You're not wrong.
On paper, it is similar.

154
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:13,700
But the principle behind it
is very different.

155
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,750
Think of it this way.

156
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:18,830
The first two special exams
had different premises,

157
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,330
but at their core, they were
testing our intelligence.

158
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,130
And you're saying the
sports festival isn't?

00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,970
that our strength
and athletic abilities

161
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,300
were the only things
that mattered

162
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,100
for the sports festival.

163
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,890
We can't trick
our way through it.

164
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,230
[AYANOKOJI]
If we want to win this,

165
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:40,060
we'll need to make sure
our class is fully prepared.

166
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,860
It's the only option.

167
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,480
I was talking about that!
How we should prepare!

168
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:49,610
You were looking for loopholes,
a shortcut to victory.

169
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,620
Like having the other team's
students miss their events

170
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,830
or by finding a way
to make them drop out.

171
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,580
--That's--
--[AYANOKOJI] I know.

172
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:00,250
You want, more than
anything, to win.

173
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,580
I see. So, you're
saying we'll have to

174
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:05,380
beat the other classes through
more traditional means?

175
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,340
If that's how you wanna
take it, be my guest.

176
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,850
I'm tellin' you, you guys are
way overthinking this thing!

177
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:18,100
I know I can easily win
all those events, trust me!

178
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,730
Plus, if I win, the class wins!

179
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,060
It benefits everybody here!

180
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,770
I guess so?

181
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,020
Well, if he says he can do it.

182
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,360
Honestly, I don't see a problem
with Sudo competing

183
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,490
in all the voluntary events.

184
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,820
Then it's settled!

185
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,120
You won't regret it--

186
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,990
I'm gonna win every single
one of those events!

187
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,000
Now that that's decided, let's
go back to the main question.

188
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,460
How will we determine who gets--

189
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,250
[SUZUNE] Hold on.
I have an alternate proposal.

190
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,750
[STUDENTS]
Huh?

191
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:51,010
Between those two options,
I do prefer the skill method.

192
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,550
But still, there's no
guarantee it'll be enough

193
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,100
for us to beat
the other classes.

194
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,510
[HIRATA]
I guess that's true.

195
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,720
The idea itself is sound,
though it could be better.

196
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,390
We should still put
our athletic students

197
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,350
in the events they're good at.

198
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,610
But for the mandatory events,
we need to be more strategic

199
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,020
with whoever we select.

200
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,780
If we do it right, we can
easily gather points.

201
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,200
Just think, instead of
putting two fast people

202
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,240
in the same race together,
we should pair them

203
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,780
with someone slow, to
guarantee better placements.

204
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:20,540
[SHINOHARA]
Wait a minute. That sounds good.

205
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,540
But doesn't that put
the non-athletic students

206
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,620
in our class
at a disadvantage?

207
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:27,630
We wouldn't stand a chance
at earning those bonus points.

208
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,630
Sacrificial pawns
who's fate is to lose!

209
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:33,420
Coming in last place would cost
them their private points.

210
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,720
It's hard to believe
they'd agree to this plan.

211
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,800
The benefits of our class
winning far outweigh that loss.

212
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:40,350
What's the problem here?

213
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,640
But you're telling us
to throw away our chance

214
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:44,600
to earn extra exam points!

215
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,860
You can't just use
people like that!

216
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,360
I understand your concerns
about this strategy.

217
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,480
It's unfair!

218
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:52,990
But your priorities
are misplaced.

219
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,110
Instead of trying
to earn exam points,

220
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,070
focus on your studies so you
don't have to rely on them!

221
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,410
--[STUDENTS murmur]
--[KEN] No!

222
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,910
Only the top three places
get those points,

223
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,040
earning them was
never a sure thing.

224
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,750
You need to face reality.

225
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:08,420
What event do you think you
can place third or better in?

226
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,500
[SHINOHARA]
It... could happen.

227
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:16,220
[KARUIZAWA]
Um. I have some thoughts!

228
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:21,220
Horikita's suggestion.

229
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:24,310
I'm sorry, but I can't
go along with it.

230
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,450
And what's your
issue with my idea?

231
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,370
Well, your proposal just
doesn't sit right with me.

232
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,590
Your objection to it is
based on your feelings?

233
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:56,050
[KARUIZAWA]
Fine. I don't understand it!

234
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,760
[SUZUNE]
I thought I was being clear.

235
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,220
What are you not understanding?

236
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,720
[KARUIZAWA]
Um, all of it?

237
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,510
Why don't you dumb it down
so even I get it?

238
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,640
[sighs]

239
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,230
Oh, yeah. That's
right, I forgot.

240
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,020
You don't like
dealing with idiots.

241
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,520
Stop putting words in my mouth!

242
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,320
But it's the truth, isn't it?
I agree with Shinohara!

243
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,530
How could you say that you
want your classmates to fail?

244
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,280
It's for the greater good.

245
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,870
Then you berated the people
who wanted extra exam points!

246
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,830
How do you expect our
class to work together

247
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,790
with that attitude?

248
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,910
It's not like we
have another choice.

249
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,210
[sighs] I guess I should've
expected that from you.

250
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,790
Well, what do you
think, Kushida?

251
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,550
Huh? My thoughts?

252
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,670
Yeah.

253
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,800
This is kind of
a tricky situation.

254
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,390
Because I feel like
I can understand

255
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,470
where both sides
are coming from.

256
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,810
In a perfect world, we'd find
a way to combine both ideas!

257
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,770
So, everyone, regardless
of how they place

258
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,480
in their events, can be happy!

259
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,060
That would be the best solution!

260
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,230
True.

261
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,320
Yeah, something like
that would be nice.

262
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,400
Well, I had already
considered that.

263
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:01,200
There's a way we
can satisfy everyone.

264
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,530
While coming in last place
results in a penalty,

265
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,200
placing in the top three
awards you private points.

266
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,830
The points that our
top placers earn

267
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,210
can offset any
points we'll lose.

268
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,380
As long as we work together,
no one loses out.

269
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,340
Yeah! That's a great idea!

270
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,470
Ugh. But it only helps
for private points!

271
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,470
Your proposal is still unfair!

272
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,340
What do you think
about it, Sato?

273
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:25,470
If Karuizawa is against
the idea, then I am, too.

274
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,890
Same with me.

275
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,600
I'll go with whatever
Karuizawa thinks we should do!

276
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,100
Did you not listen
to a word I said?

277
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,480
You're against it
only because she is?

278
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,360
That's irrational!

279
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,900
My idea is the most efficient
way for our class to win

280
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,950
as many points as
possible in this test!

281
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,030
[KARUIZAWA] You act like
you know everything.

282
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,830
But at the end of the day,
I, along with plenty

283
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,540
of other people in
the class, don't agree!

284
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,040
You're a cruel person, Horikita.

285
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,960
[SATO]
She really is.

286
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,460
[MATSUSHITA]
Yeah.

287
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,130
[MIT] It's no wonder that she
doesn't have any friends.

288
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,090
Hey!

289
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,590
[HIRATA]
Both of you, calm down!

290
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,300
This argument isn't going
anywhere, and since neither side

291
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,340
is budging, let's settle
this with a vote.

292
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:07,890
Yup! That's exactly
what we need!

293
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:10,100
[HIRATA] Horikita's suggestion
is to focus entirely

294
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,350
on optimizing our picks.

295
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,560
While Karuizawa's suggestion
is to let people

296
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,650
choose their own events.

297
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,900
Let's have a show of hands.

298
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:22,070
First up, who here
agrees with Horikita?

299
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:26,830
[HIRATA]
All right, ten votes.

300
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,780
Hey, Ayanokoji!

301
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,290
I'm abstaining.

302
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,120
Don't look at me like that.

303
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:34,710
[HIRATA] And next, if you
agree with Karuizawa's plan

304
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,340
for how we'll pick events,
then rase your hands now.

305
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,340
[HIRATA]
Thank you all.

306
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,800
It looks like we have a winner.

307
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,050
With ten votes for Horikita,

308
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,470
and eight votes for Karuizawa.

309
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,100
Everyone else abstaining.

310
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,390
[KEN]
Heck yeah!

311
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,430
[HIRATA]
All right.

312
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,690
Now that we've
decided our approach,

313
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,860
let's hammer out the
rest of the details!

314
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,110
Sure!

315
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,360
Put me down for every event!

316
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,320
Maybe we can just have Sudo
win the whole festival!

317
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,400
Oh, yeah!

318
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,370
You can leave
everything to the Ken!

319
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:08,490
Don't you think
it's super cute?

320
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,870
Yeah, it totally is!

321
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,700
[laughs] Thanks!

322
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,080
[KARUIZAWA]
Wait a sec!

323
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,460
I did what you asked me to do.

324
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,000
Mind telling me what
the point of it was?

325
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,500
Only the top three places
get those points--

326
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,380
earning them was
never a sure thing.

327
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,090
You need to face reality.

328
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,180
What event do you think you
can place third or better in?

329
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,390
[SHINOHARA]
It... could happen.

330
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,390
That was a good argument
you came up with on the spot.

331
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,060
I still don't get why you
told me to argue with Horikita.

332
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,400
I actually agreed with her idea.

333
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,900
And what was the point of
asking Kushida for her opinion?

334
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,780
Come on, don't you think
I deserve to know?

335
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,700
If I had to explain myself
for every little thing,

336
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,280
it'd be a pain.

337
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:54,700
Anyway, I have secrets
I'd like to keep.

338
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:57,620
There's something that I've
been meaning to ask you about.

339
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:00,590
What's your reason
for doing this?

340
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,960
[AYANOKOJI] I'd like to raise
Class D's standing.

341
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:06,050
If you asked Horikita,
she'd say the same.

342
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,800
That isn't what I meant!

343
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,350
I wanna know what
you're actually after.

344
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:12,180
[AYANOKOJI]
I wonder.

345
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,600
Currently, my goal is to
put Class D in a position

346
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,640
where they could
take Class A's spot.

347
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,560
Are you satisfied with that now?

348
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,480
And you really think
you can make that happen

349
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,320
by pulling everyone's strings?

350
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,190
It's understandable that you
wouldn't just believe me.

351
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,490
Especially without any proof.

352
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,860
That's why I'll
create a situation

353
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:32,740
that'll show you what I mean.

354
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:36,830
During this sports festival,
one of our classmates

355
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,830
will betray our class.

356
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,210
[gasps]

357
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,710
That's right.

358
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,630
The traitor will likely
share information

359
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,710
amongst the other classes.

360
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,050
Wait-- Really?

361
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:51,640
Well, if that's the case, we
should do something about it!

362
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,470
We will, when the time comes.

363
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,600
But what are we waiting for?

364
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,600
Wouldn't it be safer to expose
the traitor right away?

365
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,810
Just trust me.

366
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:04,070
Now, go. We don't want
to draw attention.

367
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:13,620
[KARUIZAWA] All right,
what did you get again?

368
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,250
[KARUIZAWA laughs]
Looks like 11.5!

369
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:25,000
[KEN yells]

370
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:26,880
Look at that! 82.4!

371
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,920
[STUDENTS gasp]

372
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,760
Dude, you're some
kind of monster!

373
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,260
That's some nice
grip strength!

374
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,140
I've been working out
a lot lately!

375
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,300
So, you know.

376
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:37,020
Hey, Koenji, why don't
you give it a try?

377
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,270
No thanks, think I'll pass.

378
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,810
Tch. Whatever.

379
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,480
Here, your turn.

380
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,110
[KEN]
Something wrong?

381
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,400
What do you think the
average grip strength is?

382
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:52,150
Huh? I dunno, like 60?

383
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,280
Sixty, huh?

384
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,990
[AYANOKOJI]
When it comes to grip strength,

385
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,540
It's not necessarily
proportional

386
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,580
to the size of your arms.

387
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,540
It mainly relies on
two different muscles

388
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,880
in the forearm which are
called the brachioradialis

389
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,710
and flexor carpi radialis.

390
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,210
If you can focus on building
up those two muscles,

391
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,300
you can increase your strength.

392
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:15,010
In other words, with enough
exercise and muscle training,

393
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:19,560
a person's grip strength can
reach over 100 kilograms.

394
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,180
That should be enough.

395
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,810
This is the best I got.

396
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,190
What was it?

397
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,940
[AYANOKOJI]
60.6.

398
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,570
Oh, wow, you're a lot stronger
than you look, Ayanokoji!

399
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,780
Oh really? Isn't that
just kinda average?

400
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,450
[HIRATA] I'd say that you're
far above average!

401
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:37,780
It's like 45.

402
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:40,910
Or maybe even 50
on the high end.

403
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:45,830
Just 42.6? Can we fudge
the number to like 50?

404
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,920
Sorry! You got a 42.6!

405
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,170
[IKE groans]

406
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:52,590
[AYANOKOJI]
I see. So, 60 is a bit too high.

407
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,470
[HIRATA]
All done!

408
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,850
All right! The results!

409
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:02,220
Yeah! I'm in all
the voluntary events!

410
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,060
Everyone, remember,
these assignments

411
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,230
are highly sensitive,

412
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,480
so only write down
the events you're in!

413
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,990
Please make sure this
information doesn't get out.

414
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,070
[ONODERA]
Okay.

415
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,370
[KEN]
Keep pulling!

416
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,490
Don't you dare
think about giving up!

417
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,490
Good! Keep your
center of gravity low!

418
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,370
Yeah. Okay!

419
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,170
[KEN]
Put your backs into it!

420
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,960
Pull like your lives
depend on it!

421
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,250
We have to win!

422
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,300
[YAMAUCHI]
We're trying!

423
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,760
[KEN]
I can't hear you!

424
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,510
Hey, slow down a little.
You're running way too fast.

425
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,630
So that's why our
rhythm was off.

426
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,300
Because you can't keep pace.

427
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,810
[gasps]

428
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:44,140
Why should I have to hold back
to match your mediocrity?

429
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,730
Instead of asking me to slow
down, you need to speed up.

430
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,280
[AYANOKOJI]
Can we talk?

431
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,780
Talk about what?

432
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:01,240
Listen, I know you
may not like it,

433
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:03,620
but you're gonna need to learn
to compromise with the others.

434
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,620
If I don't push them,
we won't place high enough

435
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,660
during the sports festival.

436
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,130
For the three-legged race,
it's more logical to make

437
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:13,960
the slower runners go faster,
than the other way around.

438
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,760
[AYANOKOJI] You're not
budging on that position?

439
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,010
[SUZUNE]
No.

440
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,050
If that's the way
that you think,

441
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,890
then you might have a hard
time finding a partner.

442
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:25,020
If they can't match my rhythm,
I don't want them as a partner.

443
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,520
So, that works out for me.

444
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,310
Why don't we make an attempt?

445
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,900
What do you mean by that?

446
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,280
Let's run a three-legged race.

447
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,150
And what good would that do?

448
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,030
The sports festival
has a co-ed event.

449
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,910
I would like to see for myself
if we'd make a good team or not.

450
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:47,040
You seriously think you
can keep up with me?

451
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,040
Quit dreaming.

452
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,000
Come on, just this once.

453
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,590
I promise that I'll keep up
with your rhythm.

454
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:56,170
Whatever. Okay.

455
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,640
Let's get this over with.

456
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,020
Hey, hold on!

457
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,520
It shouldn't be hard
for you to match my pacing.

458
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,560
Well, duh. I've already got it!

459
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,250
[AYANOKOJI] It's not about
how fast you can run.

460
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,250
Your problem is that you aren't

461
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,340
paying attention
to your partner.

462
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,670
You need to look at them and
get a feel for their rhythm.

463
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,510
Focusing only on your own pace
is what's holding you back.

464
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,850
Oh, right.

465
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:47,180
You'll be coming
with me tomorrow.

466
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,930
What for?

467
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,600
We'll be gathering
intel on Team White.

468
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:54,110
It'll be you, me,
and someone else.

469
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,400
[SUZUNE]
Who is it?

00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,820

00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,450
During the last test,

who betrayed the Earth group.

474
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,830
It was her.
