Please, stop it. L-Let me go!

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,190
Hah! You really think we'll
just let you off the hook

3
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,450
if you shed a couple tears?

4
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,320
You're the worst kind of
person, you know?

5
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,320
Always looking for some
guy to hide behind!

6
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,200
For real, I hate girls like you!

7
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,700
What happened to all that
attitude you had before?

8
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,660
--Come on, I'm talking to you!
--[KARUIZAWA yelps] Ow!

00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,170
That's hilarious!
Hold her still for a sec!

10
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,210
If we're getting pictures,

11
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:45,800
we should clean
her up a little bit!

12
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,300
[YAMASHITA]
That's a great idea!

13
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,550
[YABU]
Yeah, let's do it.

14
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:52,630
Leave me alone! I'm sorry!

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,060
[YUKIMURA]
We have to do something!

16
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,350
Not yet.

17
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,480
I can't watch this anymore!

18
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,020
What are you doing?
Leave her alone!

19
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,150
[MANABE]
Leave her alone?

20
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,780
We're just having a little chat!

21
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,110
[YAMASHITA]
Yeah! That's right!

22
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:11,200
Don't think for even
a second that this is over.

23
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,320
One way or another,
you're gonna apologize to Rika.

24
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:17,870
[YUKIMURA]
You okay?

25
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,120
[KARUIZAWA]
Leave me alone.

26
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,250
I-I was trying to help!

27
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:27,300
Shut up! I never asked
for you to help me!

28
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,250
What the hell is her problem?

29
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,090
[AYANOKOJI] I see,
maybe I'll give it a try.

30
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,440
[AYANOKOJI]
So, Venus Group's test

31
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,860
has ended early as well.

32
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,610
Which means someone
in that group sent in a guess

33
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,740
about the VIP's identity.

34
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,860
Too bad this only helps Class C.

35
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,370
[AYANOKOJI] Ryuen is trying
to figure out the criteria

36
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,870
for the VIP selections.

37
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,040
I guess I should start
assembling my pieces

38
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,120
while I can.

39
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,380
[AYANOKOJI]
Okay.

40
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,470
Let's see what they
decide to do now.

41
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:51,520
[sighs] There's no
signal down here.

42
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,820
If Hirata wanted to talk,

43
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,780
we could have met up
somewhere else!

We're glad you could make it!

48
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,040
This is the "Karuizawa begs
for mercy" photoshoot!

[YAMASHITA laughs]

Make sure you get
everything, Yamashita!

51

Sure thing!

52
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,050
Stop this!

53
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,810
I haven't done
anything wrong, okay?

54
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,350
[MANABE] If that's true,
why is your voice shaking?

55
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,140
[YABU]
Look at her! She's scared!

56

What's the matter, little piggy?

Are you gonna cry again?

Please. Yeah, right!

61
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:42,820
It just occurred to me.
You've been bullied before.

[KARUIZAWA gasps]

63
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,080

I called it!

00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,550
[YAMASHITA]
Oh, my gosh, she totally has!

65

Well, you already
know how this goes!

take a shot, Rika?

No thanks, I'm fine.

[AYANOKOJI]
Stanley Milgram conducted

89
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,250
a series of experiments and
found that external pressure

90
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,880
can enhance a person's
natural cruelty.

91
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,930
Yes! That's the kind of
expression I like to see!

[AYANOKOJI]
Well done, Manabe.

93
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,430
All I did was set the scene,
and you've run with it.

00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,730
[MANABE] If you just
begged from the start...

95

[KARUIZAWA]
Please, forgive me.

96
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:42,780
[AYANOKOJI] Getting Karuizawa to
rock bottom will save me time.

This is necessary.

[KARUIZAWA]
How did you find me?

99
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,060
It seems no matter
how you try to change,

100
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,890
you'll always be a victim.

101
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:16,850
[gasps] You were
watching all that?

102
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,020
I wouldn't bother
reaching out to Hirata.

[gasps]

104
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,740
[AYANOKOJI] I know he's not
really your boyfriend.

105
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,360
And I know about your past.

106
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:30,370
You have no secrets from me.

107
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,950
What that means for you is

108
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,330
I can expose you
any time I want.

109

Let go!

110
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,130
You were terrified
of being bullied again.

111
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:49,640
So, you hid your past and became
a parasite that used others.

112
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,180
Where did that get you?

113
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:55,310
What--What are you
planning to do with me?

114
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,770
[AYANOKOJI] Let's see how
far you're willing to go.

115
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,690
Spread your legs.

116

[gasps]

117
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,630
[KARUIZAWA]
I don't know what I expected.

118
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,760
You're just another bully, no
better than those other girls.

Trying to make me do
something ridiculous,

120
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,550
and using blackmail
to get your way.

121
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,430
And yet, you don't
seem to be resisting.

122
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,730
You don't understand anything.

123
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:39,230
What do you think people do
when they're stuck in a reality

124
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,150
that they have no control over?

125
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,900
They simply accept it.

126
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,320
When placed in
a hopeless situation,

127
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,820
they give up, and stop
resisting the abuse.

128
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,530
That mentality invades
every part of their lives.

129
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,620
They can't run away,
or fight back.

130
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,710
It becomes automatic.

131
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,410
There's more to it than that.

132
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,290
There's something you're
trying to escape.

[gasps]

134
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,880
Something so dreadful
that you'd be willing

135
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,260
to surrender your body.

136
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,880
What is this trauma
that you're hiding?

137
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,340
I want to see it for myself.

138
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,510
No! Don't touch me!

139
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:19,020
[AYANOKOJI] Is this it?
Is this your darkness?

140
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,850
I understand.

141
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:24,270
There are many kinds
of despair that exist.

142
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,690
What you've been through
definitely qualifies,

143
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:29,240
and you're not alone
in that misery.

144
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,200
Those with darkness in their
hearts are drawn together.

145
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,240
And then the stronger
one between them

146
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,490
inevitably engulfs the other.

147
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,830
What? I'm confused.

148
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,250
What do you mean?

149
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,920
[AYANOKOJI] This world of ours
contains more darkness

150
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,840
than you could ever imagine.

151
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,840
I'll release you from
the shackles of your past.

Karuizawa, I promise you.
From now on,

153
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,850
I will protect you.

154
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:06,440
And in a far more reliable way
than Hirata or Machida.

release this video,

I want you to help me.

161
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,250
I have a problem that
only you can solve.

162
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,340
Huh? Why would you need my help?

163
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,050
As it is now, Class D will
never be able to move up.

164
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,590
But if you can use
your popularity

165
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,220
to lead the other girls,

166
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,510
we'll make it so our
class works together.

167
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,100
[AYANOKOJI] Right. This is
something Horikita can't do.

168
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,600
Seriously? But why?

169
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,640
I'll keep the promise
I made to you.

170
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,520
And all you need to do
is help me out.

171
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:49,610
That's the kind of exchange

172
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,150
that you've been
looking for, isn't it?

173
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,490
All right, then.

174
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:00,120
What's the next step
in this plan of yours?

175
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,490
First thing's first.

176
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,750
I'd like for us
to win this test.

177
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,540
And to do that...

178
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,000
[inaudible]

179
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,590
[gasps]

180
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:18,010
[CHABASHIRA]
Sorry to make you wait.

181
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,850
What did you need?

182
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,720
There's something that I'd
like to purchase with points.

183
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,320
[AYANOKOJI]
Already here, huh?

184
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:59,220
[phone beeping]

185
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,810
Ayanokoji! I'm sorry!
I was hogging the sofa!

186
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:04,640
Whoops!

187
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,890
No, it's fine.

188
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:11,190
Can we chat for a bit?
Before everyone else gets here?

189
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,240
To be honest, there's
something I've been dying

190
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,080
to ask you about, Ayanokoji!

191
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,080
[AYANOKOJI]
Really?

192
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,990
Yup! Is it true
that you're trying

193
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,290
to get to Class A
before graduation?

194
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,790
It would be nice, yeah.

195
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:32,130
What a diplomatic answer!
It's the same for me!

196
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,550
It's a dream of mine to
graduate as a part of Class A.

197
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,510
Too bad, though, huh?
That we're in different classes.

198
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,970
I guess that means
only one of us

199
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,930
can make our dream
come true, right?

200
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,760
I suppose. Although,

201
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,930
there's another way for you to
get into Class A, isn't there?

202
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,350
Ah, that's right!

203
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,940
You could just buy your way in
with 20,000,000 points!

204
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,230
Uh-huh.

205
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,730
But from the rumors
that I've heard about it,

206
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,190
nobody's ever done it before.

207
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,400
Hey, Ayanokoji.

208
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,660
Remember that time
you borrowed my phone?

209
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,450
You saw my point
total, didn't you?

210
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:07,500
Sorry, I wasn't trying
to pry or anything.

211
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,330
[AYANOKOJI]
Right.

212
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:11,790
It was during the end
of the first term.

213
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,960
She had amassed a
huge number of points.

214
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,130
[laughs] I wasn't
accusing you of that!

215
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,550
It's fine that you saw.

216
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,090
But please don't
spread it around!

217
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,550
Of course. It's none
of my business.

218
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,980
I didn't expect you'd be here
this early, Ayanokoji.

219
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,600
Looks like Ichinose's
here as well!

220
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:32,810
Wait a sec.

221
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,400
Have we interrupted
a romantic rendezvous?

222
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,110
[ICHINOSE]
What are you imagining?

223
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,110
That's not the case at all!

224
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,200
[ICHINOSE] Let's start
the final discussion!

225
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,410
Oh, Hamaguchi!

226
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,370
I believe you wanted
to say something?

227
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,500
Please correct me if I'm wrong.

228
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,750
But I think everyone here
wants to earn points.

229
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,630
And the best way to do that is
to aim for a case one result.

230
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,210
[IBUKI]
Thanks for stating the obvious.

231
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,760
[SOTOMURA]
Of course!

232
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,880
That is the very motive for
these discussions, is it not?

233
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:05,180
At the rate we've been going,
we aren't going to find the VIP.

234
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,890
That's why I have a proposal.

235
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,600
We need to make a drastic
change in our strategy.

236
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,480
[YUKIMURA]
And what are you suggesting?

237
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,230
[HAMAGUCHI] A way to remove
the possibility of falsehoods!

238
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:17,860
We should show each other the
email we got from the school.

239
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,570
Everyone received an email
on the first day

240
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,780
telling them if they
were the VIP or not.

241
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,320
Since they're
impossible to fake,

242
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,030
they'll be definitive proof.

243
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,660
This is ridiculous.

244
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,910
Aren't you forgetting about
the case three result?

245
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,410
Someone could betray the
group and steal the points.

246
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,540
If there's even
one traitor, it's over.

247
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,380
I'm well aware of
the risks in my plan.

248
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:39,290
However, if we keep playing
it safe, only the VIP will win.

249
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,720
So, you'd rather our
group take a gamble.

250
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,170
Yes. But my proposal
evens the playing field

251
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,970
for those of us who aren't
the VIP or their friends.

252
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,010
What do you guys think?

253
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,100
[HAMAGUCHI]
If you think about it,

254
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,350
they'd be the only
ones who'd object.

255
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,140
Do you seriously think
we're all going to agree

256
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,680
to such a risky plan?

257
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,980
[ICHINOSE] You seemed awfully
quick to reject it, Machida.

258
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,190
[MACHIDA]
What's that?

259
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,690
Just thinking out loud.

260
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:01,650
If this ends in a deadlock and
no one earns class points,

261
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:05,240
wouldn't that work out
in Class A's favor?

262
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,320
But, on the other hand,
that means the rest of us

263
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,160
from the other classes
have an incentive

264
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,330
to take a risk, doesn't it?

265
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,750
[AYANOKOJI]
Ichinose has to be behind this.

266
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,290
Hamaguchi may be speaking,

267
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,880
but I'll bet anything
those are her words.

268
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,630
I can't force anyone
to show their email

269
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,050
if they don't want to.

270
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:25,010
But since it was my idea,
I'll show you my phone!

271
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,380
Hamaguchi!

272
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:29,390
I'll show mine, too!
Look, I'm not the VIP.

273
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,140
Oh, my! What a twist!

274
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,770
[AYANOKOJI]
The longer we take to agree,

275
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,730
the more suspicious we look.

276
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,140
Might as well.

277
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,350
All right.

278
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,150
I'll go along
with your proposal.

279
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,650
What are you doing?

280
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:43,070
Ayanokoji? You sure?

281
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,440
[AYANOKOJI]
Yes.

282
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:47,240
I see, so you weren't
picked to be the VIP either.

283
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,660
Huh.

284
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,740
Uh, whatever, I'll join.

285
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,120
Are you serious?

286
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,620
If we wait out
the clock like this,

287
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,250
the entire test will just
have been a waste of time.

288
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,880
It's better to risk it.
Unless, one of you is the VIP?

289
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,040
Obviously not!

290
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,540
[KARUIZAWA]
I'll show my email, too!

291
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:05,760
Any chance is better than none!

292
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,590
Fine, here it is. You happy now?

293
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,600
A wise man said, "If you
can't beat 'em, join 'em!"

294
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,310
It's not me, either!

295
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:20,860
Other than Class A,
all that's left is you.

296
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,400
Come on! Show us your email!

297
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,490
I need everyone to promise,
right now, that you won't

298
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,370
betray the group by turning
in your answer early.

299
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,950
Does that mean it's you?

300
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,330
[YUKIMURA]
Ayanokoji.

301
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,910
Please forgive me
for lying to you.

302
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,380
I'm our group's VIP.

303
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,750
What? You're kidding!

304
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,170
I see.

305
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,930
[AYANOKOJI]
Good job, Yukimura.

306
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,050
With that, our victory
is all but guaranteed.

307
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,220
Everyone!

308
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:57,430
Let's all agree not
to expose Yukimura!

309
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,310
We can win this test together!

310
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:02,310
I guess that's fine.

311
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,110
I appreciate that.
I want to believe.

312
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,990
No, I choose to believe!

313
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:09,820
[HAMAGUCHI]
Right!

314
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,950
[BEPPU]
Let's win this!

315
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,660
[SOTOMURA]
We shan't betray your trust!

316
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,160
[AYANOKOJI] Of course,
that's not gonna happen.

317
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,910
Blinded by greed, someone
will betray the group.

318
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,790
But that's exactly what we want.

319
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,210
Yukimura isn't the VIP.

320
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,300
Earlier, I told him that
the school chose me.

321
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,510
So, we swapped our cell
phones with each other.

322
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:34,430
I wasn't expecting
Ichinose to make a move.

323
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,430
But it still worked out.

324
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:38,390
--[phone rings]
--[YUKIMURA gasps]

325
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,190
Yukimura, would you care
to explain why you were

326
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,770
in possession of
Ayanokoji's phone?

327
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,150
Oh? It's his? Who knew?

328
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,150
You see, I just called
Ayanokoji's number,

329
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,950
but the phone in your hand rang!

330
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,080
And it couldn't have been your
number, because I don't know it!

331
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,160
Does that mean that
the real VIP is Ayanokoji?

332
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,870
What the heck is going on?

333
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,290
They switched phones?

334
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,540
Hah. That was pretty sneaky!

335
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,420
So, everything you
said before was a lie?

336
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,420
You better explain
yourselves, Class D!

337
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:12,470
Hold on! I didn't know
anything about this!

338
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,590
[ANNOUNCER 201A] The discussion
period is now over.

339
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,430
All groups must disperse...

340
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,930
[YUKIMURA]
Damn it!

341
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:21,520
Finally showing everyone your
true colors, Class D scum.

342
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,020
Nice job.

343
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,900
We got to see exactly how
little your "trust" is worth.

344
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,940
Well, here's hoping
that no one else

345
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,110
breaks their promise, huh?

346
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,910
[YUKIMURA]
This is awful!

347
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:50,130
It all went according to plan.

348
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:55,220
[AYANOKOJI] Yup. This was
the perfect outcome for us.

349
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,970
I need you because
you're the VIP, Karuizawa.

350
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,270
[gasps] How did you know?

351
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,350
[AYANOKOJI]
Hirata mentioned it to me.

352
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,480
It's good that you're the VIP.
We can use that to set a trap.

353
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:12,070
First off, you and I need
to exchange our cellphones.

354
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,110
Then, I'll pretend
to be the VIP.

355
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,910
I'll convince Yukimura
to trade cellphones,

356
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,990
but I'll keep him in the dark
about your involvement.

357
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,750
For part two of our plan,
we'll steer the conversation

358
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,500
to make him admit
to being the VIP.

359
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,170
So, it doesn't matter if
someone sees through our plan.

360
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,880
Because even if they figure out
that you two swapped phones,

361
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,840
if they guess you, we still win!

362
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,220
[AYANOKOJI] But there's a
critical flaw with this plan.

363
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,050
It doesn't matter how many times
we switch. If we can't change

364
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,850
our phone number,
we'd be exposed

365
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,510
the second someone called us.

366
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,270
What are we supposed
to do, then?

367
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,770
When we swap phones,
I'll keep my SIM card.

368
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,190
Aren't the SIM cards locked
to their original phones?

369
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,520
The ones from the school
don't let you take them out.

370
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,690
There's nothing you
can't buy with points.

371
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:56,700
That's one of the fundamental
rules of this school.

372
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,410
I'm certain I can
get Ms. Chabashira

373
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,660
to sell me the key.

374
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,540
[KARUIZAWA]
It worked out,

375
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,830
but I still feel kinda
bad for Yukimura.

376
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,580
[ICHINOSE]
Yeah, me, too!

377
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,130
Oh, Ichinose?

378
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,380
[ICHINOSE] After uncovering
a lie, people have a tendency

379
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,800
to accept the next answer
they hear as true.

380
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,510
Someone from our
group is definitely

381
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,800
going to fall into your trap.

382
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,550
I see, that explains why
you tried to call my phone.

383
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,930
I'm guessing Class B has
something similar planned.

384
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,810
Great minds think alike!

385
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,310
Although, if you knew our plan,
then why didn't you just

386
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,310
call us out during
the discussion?

387
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,980
We didn't have to! We
weren't gonna risk guessing.

388
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,360
So, we decided we should let

389
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,950
someone from Class A
or Class C take the fall.

390
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:42,280
Was that the reason why you let
all the discussions drag on?

391
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:45,200
Just so you could
orchestrate this situation?

392
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:47,120
Yeah, something like that.

393
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,460
My turn!

394
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,460
I'm curious, did Horikita
come up with this plan?

395
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,380
If not her, who else could?

396
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,170
[ICHINOSE]
Huh... Well, if you say so!

397
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,340
[phone chimes]

398
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,430
Huh? Results?

399
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,980
[SUZUNE]
How could this have happened?

400
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,190
Class C got so many points.

401
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,690
Somehow, Class A totally
dropped the ball!

402
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:16,110
An acceptable result. But still.

403
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:18,320
[RYUEN]
That's a nice expression.

404
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,070
Suzune.

405
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,910
Do you believe me now?

406
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,080
I did tell you that I'd
find out the identities

407
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,250
of all the VIPs, didn't I?

408
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,080
Believe you?

409
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,670
You wouldn't hesitate for a
second to betray the group

410
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,460
if that meant that you won.

411
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,840
Our group made it to the end,
so there's no way you knew.

412
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,840
[RYUEN]
Kikyo Kushida.

413
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,260
What's wrong?

414
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,220
Did you really think you could
hide the VIP's identity?

415
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:47,180
I figured out it was
Kushida by day two.

416
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,470
How'd you know?

417
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,350
It was painfully obvious.

418
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:53,360
I can read you
like an open book.

419
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,650
That look on your face--
it gets me going.

420
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:59,070
I think I'll make you
my next target.

421
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,740
How's that sound?

422
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,080
I'm going to tear you into
pieces, body and soul.

423
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,990
Our second term is
shaping up to be a fun one.

424
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,670
[AYANOKOJI]
With how things are panning out,

425
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,300
Class D could be put
in a difficult spot.
