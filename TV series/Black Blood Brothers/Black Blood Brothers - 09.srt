1
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:44,500
I'm coming with you.

2
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:45,833
Excuse me?

3
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:48,041
You can't, Jiro. Besides,
this isn't your problem.

4
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:49,125
Let her handle it.

5
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:50,375
Let me go.

6
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:56,208
Why are you so hard headed?

7
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:57,875
Cassa, you can't
let him do this.

8
00:01:57,958 --> 00:01:59,416
Alice, please. Let go.

9
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,500
No, Jiro, I won't let you.

10
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:06,791
Good grief. Move aside
and let me handle this, Alice.

11
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:12,666
There. That wasn't
so hard now was it?

12
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,958
Now he'll stay out of my way.

13
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:19,500
Alice! Don't let her do this.

14
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:20,875
Shut up, Sub-Lieutenant.

15
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:23,583
It seems that you've
forgotten who you're talking to.

16
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:24,875
Now let's go.

17
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:26,375
Cassa!

18
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:30,500
We're leaving, Alice.

19
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,416
Alice.

20
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,625
It's taking me a lot longer
to get back than I thought.

21
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:03,083
I sure hope Mimi has
some food waiting for me.

22
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:09,125
Get a load of this kid.

23
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,541
Yeah. That's a nice vest.

24
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:12,875
Your parents rich?

25
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,208
Who are you guys?

26
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,916
Us? We're just
a bunch of nobodies.

27
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,791
Hey, you've got
some money, right?

28
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,416
How about sharing
a little with us?

29
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,791
You better do what we
say or we'll sell you to

30
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:27,083
some sick pervert who's
into little kids like you.

31
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,500
You're a bunch of bullies.

32
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,166
And you won't
get away with this.

33
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,666
I'm gonna make sure you
don't hurt anyone ever again.

34
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,500
Right. So what
do you guys think?

35
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,166
Should we teach him a lesson?

36
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,333
Yeah.

37
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,375
Hey. You need a hand?

38
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,333
Zelman!

39
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:53,416
Huh. So we meet again, Kotaro.

40
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,083
That's right. Keep running.

41
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,708
So what are you doing here?

42
00:03:58,791 --> 00:03:59,791
Ummmm.

43
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:02,375
Well. I guess I...

44
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:21,083
Thank you, Mister Zelman!
The food was delicious.

45
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:24,500
Just don't forget that I helped
you out, and now you owe me one.

46
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,916
So you have to help
me out when I need it.

47
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:31,375
Cassa the Black Snake
is here! How exciting.

48
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,375
You seem really
happy about it.

49
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,458
I missed out on all of the
best battles back in Hong Kong.

50
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,791
So I'm looking forward to this.

51
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,458
Listen to me Mr. Zelman.

52
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,666
The Special Zone's
in great danger.

53
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,208
You really need to
start taking this seriously.

54
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,916
Don't be so uptight, kid.

55
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,416
And besides, who are
you to talk anyway?

56
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,333
You're the one who ran
away from your brother,

57
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:55,291
and now you're just
wandering around the city lost.

58
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:58,458
I-I'm not just wandering
around the city lost.

59
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:01,000
I came to find Mimi
so she could help us out.

60
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,416
What could she
possibly do for you now?

61
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,750
I don't know.
I thought maybe she could

62
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,708
talk some sense
into brother for me.

63
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:11,916
Oh really? Just what makes
you think she could do that?

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,833
Well, I don't know
how to put it into words,

65
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,875
but I just know she can help.

66
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:20,791
And things can't stay the way
they are now. It's all wrong.

67
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:23,750
But I don't know.

68
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,166
Maybe brother's right.
Maybe this is better.

69
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,500
Everything's just been
so complicated lately,

70
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:31,541
I really don't know
what's going on anymore.

71
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,750
No. I think you're mistaken.

72
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,208
What?

73
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,291
You do understand, because
it's in your blood, Kotaro.

74
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,000
The blood passed down to you.

75
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,333
It contains all the
wisdom of your ancestors,

76
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:43,541
and it is what
makes you a vampire.

77
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:46,625
Listening to the voices
of the past can be difficult.

78
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:50,166
But when you've lost your way
and find yourself truly alone,

79
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,125
then simply silence your mind
and heed the flow of your blood.

80
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,833
It's the one thing
that will never betray you.

81
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:59,416
But the day that you no
longer listen to those voices

82
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,833
is the day your
bloodline will die.

83
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,750
You have to trust it.

84
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,583
That is the true
way of our kind.

85
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:08,750
It is the only way
we Black Bloods survive.

86
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:13,083
Thanks very much, Mister Zelman.

87
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,000
Well, I guess I should
keep looking for Mimi.

88
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:21,916
I'll help you.

89
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,375
Huh?

90
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,916
I have something I need to
discuss with Mimiko as well.

91
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,291
So you'll help
me find her? All right!

92
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,458
We should get started right
away. The Special Zone's in

93
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:35,583
a real mess and I don't wanna
leave Mimi out there alone.

94
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:42,250
Hey. You're pretty strong
aren't you, Mister Zelman?

95
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,375
Yeah. You could say that.

96
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:47,041
I wonder if you're stronger
than this Cassa person.

97
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:50,000
What do you think? Are you?

98
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:02,958
Easily.

99
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,208
Listen, Mimiko. I don't
think this is going to work.

100
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:15,083
If we keep this up, our chances
of finding the Silver Blade are

101
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,875
less than one in a million.

102
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,166
But we have to keep looking.
We don't have a choice.

103
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,541
We can start by hitting
all the hotels in town.

104
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,708
So innocent. I
suppose that's one of

105
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,416
the strengths
of the red bloods.

106
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,416
Huh?

107
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,625
Nothing. Anyway...

108
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:32,541
Can you tell me anything
more about the Eleventh Yard.

109
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:33,833
I find it hard to believe that

110
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:36,416
it's really nothing
more than an urban legend.

111
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,833
And why is that?

112
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,666
Did you know that the
conception of the Special Zone

113
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,083
coincides directly with
beginning of the Company?

114
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,583
And that the Order Coffin
Company is the de facto group

115
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,791
calling the shots
in the Special Zone?

116
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,750
If there really is some
sort of Hong Kong legacy here,

117
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:52,791
it would be odd for the
Company not to know about it.

118
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:55,500
And when people have questions
regarding the Eleventh Yard,

119
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:58,375
the Company is the first
place they go, am I right?

120
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:00,541
I suppose that's true.

121
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,291
Just think about it Mimiko.

122
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:05,166
The Company is even keeping
secrets from its own employees.

123
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,625
You have to ask yourself, what
else are they not telling you?

124
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:11,458
Please, Miss Wong. Let's
just calm down for a minute.

125
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,666
Why exactly are
you so interested in

126
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,583
the Eleventh Yard, anyway?

127
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,250
It's just--

128
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,375
Yes? Hey, Hibari.

129
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:23,791
Mhmmm.

130
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,125
Yeah.

131
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,083
Sorry, can you
speak up a little?

132
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,333
Alice.

133
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:48,708
Okay, I guess I'll
talk to you later, Hibari.

134
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:52,458
I know where he lives now.
The information broker.

135
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,500
What's so funny, Miss Wong?

136
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,416
What?

137
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,666
Amazing. She's exactly
the same as she was before.

138
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,125
Uh, what?

139
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,041
Oh, it was nothing.

140
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:09,500
I was just remembering
something from a long time ago.

141
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,625
So... you found him?

142
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:12,500
Yes.

143
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:13,791
Then, shall we go?

144
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,208
Okay.

145
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:20,708
I'm glad I came. This
place truly is interesting.

146
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:23,875
That woman just now.
Did you know her?

147
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,250
You saw her?

148
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:28,041
Only for a moment. But
the other woman was wearing

149
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,000
a company uniform
and definitely

150
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,208
looked a lot
like Mimiko, right?

151
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,625
Oh no!

152
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:35,916
We'll follow them.

153
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,583
Oh, okay.

154
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,916
Was it my imagination?

155
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,041
I thought I saw someone
I knew really well,

156
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,291
but different somehow.

157
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,041
We can fight it
out here quietly.

158
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:58,333
I sense that there
are other vampires here.

159
00:09:58,416 --> 00:09:59,750
Are they infected?

160
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,875
No. They're not
Kowloon Children.

161
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:05,291
Then what's their purpose?

162
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:09,583
I can't tell. Not just yet.

163
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:14,916
Look darling. Now is just
really not a good time for me.

164
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,375
If that geezer Zhang finds
out, he'll strangle us both,

165
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,125
and that'll
just be for starters.

166
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,750
They don't need you right now.

167
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:23,000
Cain told me you
were an expendable asset.

168
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,916
That's awful! How could
they say that about the

169
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,083
star of Criminal
Investigations?!

170
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,666
Ahhhh, talk about
killing my motivation!

171
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,916
I don't give a damn
about your motivation.

172
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,375
My brother's out there alone.
I can't waste any more time.

173
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,958
I beg of you!
Please help me find him!

174
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,166
There's really no reason
for you to worry, Jiro.

175
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,083
I mean, your little brother
is a Black Blood after all.

176
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,458
It's not like
getting run over by

177
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,750
a dump truck
will kill him, right?

178
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,333
You idiot! Cassa
may already be inside

179
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,083
the Special Zone as we speak.

180
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,708
And I'm not going to
leave Kotaro out there

181
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:56,000
alone for one minute longer.

182
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,000
Please take this seriously.

183
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,541
Oh, don't worry,
we'll find Kotaro.

184
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:02,708
And there's really no need to

185
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,458
get yourself all
worked up about it, okay?

186
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,125
It's not helping anything.

187
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,916
And after all, it's not
like the Kowloon Children are

188
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,916
out to get the
two of you anyway.

189
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,625
Then what are they after?

190
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:16,625
Cain said the same thing.
He said Cassa wasn't after us.

191
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,458
Then what is their objective?

192
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:21,458
Why would they risk so much
by entering the Special Zone?

193
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:22,833
Uh. How would I know?

194
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,541
Don't lie. You know!

195
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,041
Well, yeah...

196
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,083
Tell me what they're after!

197
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,750
There's something about
this place that bothers me.

198
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,708
All the special circumstances
and Sei's barrier.

199
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:37,791
They've essentially recreated
Hong Kong during the crusade.

200
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,125
Um, well. It's just--

201
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,375
That is--

202
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,916
Please don't Jiro, darling.

203
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,416
What did I do?

204
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,125
Attack!

205
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,875
What the--?!

206
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,541
Were they bitten?

207
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,500
I doubt it. If they had
been, then they would have

208
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,708
begun to turn immediately.

209
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,375
That was quick.

210
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,083
Yafuri Chao.

211
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,083
Damn!

212
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:55,208
I see. So this is your doing?

213
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,416
You've found me out.

214
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,916
Open fire!

215
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:04,583
So we know that
at the very least

216
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,875
he has the power
of the Hide Hand.

217
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,708
Where is your older sister?

218
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,500
Let's not worry about my sister.

219
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,291
You're going to need all you've
got if you hope to defeat me.

220
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:17,166
I see you've brought quite
a few troops to back you up.

221
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,208
Maybe I'll start by
taking them out first.

222
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:21,375
What?

223
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:27,458
Listen to me, young man.

224
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:30,458
You're a fool to assume
you could fight me on your own.

225
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,083
You don't stand a chance.

226
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,791
We'll see about that.

227
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:42,750
A cheap trick!

228
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:52,750
Just leave him to me.
Take care of the others.

229
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,583
Oh my goodness,
that was terrible.

230
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,041
It was Cain, wasn't it?

231
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,750
Yeah. He used hypnotic
suggestion in order to gag me.

232
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,958
If I ever try to talk,
that's what happens.

233
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,041
This is your treat, am I right?

234
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,166
Look, I'll help
you on one condition.

235
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,500
And what's that?

236
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:15,125
I want you to go see
Mimiko and apologize to her.

237
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,291
I left because it
was too dangerous

238
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:21,000
for her to be around
me. That's all.

239
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,500
Well the way I see it, you'd do
more good for her than bad,

240
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,750
and I think that
she's good for you, too.

241
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,791
But I'm a vampire.

242
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,333
This is the Special Zone.

243
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:33,500
Never underestimate
the people who live here.

244
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:39,625
Whatever. Shall we go?

245
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,250
Where should we start looking?

246
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:42,500
I have no idea.

247
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,208
Then a lotta help you are.

248
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,416
You know, I'm well informed
about the inner workings

249
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,458
at the Company. I'm sure
I could dig something up.

250
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:37,750
Shit!

251
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,000
Damn sorcerer!

252
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,750
That's checkmate.

253
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:18,333
I thought you
might be coming, Cain.

254
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:22,041
You want to know my whereabouts
that badly, do you? Hmmm?

255
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,333
But you've failed.

256
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:41,208
You're definitely a Warlock.

257
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:46,041
It's an honor to fight you,
the Great Cain Warlock.

258
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:49,333
Hero of the Crusade.
Knight of Azami Mansion.

259
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:52,583
Steely blood of Morgan
the Witch's bloodline.

260
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,541
My name is Yafuri Chao.
And I'm a direct descendant of

261
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,333
the Kowloon King and
the younger brother of

262
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,625
Cassandra Jill Warlock.

263
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:04,166
Have to admit, your
fighting's pretty impressive.

264
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,583
Just what I'd expect
from an Old Blood.

265
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:07,791
Oh really?

266
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:10,125
I assume that you
consent to this fight.

267
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,750
He's good!

268
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,083
D'ya like that?

269
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:34,750
I like that look in your eyes.

270
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:37,250
It means you're
seeing me, Yafuri Chao,

271
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,416
and not just
Cassa's little brother.

272
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,958
When you swing your
sword, put your back into it.

273
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:46,291
The young are always quick
to neglect the fundamentals.

274
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:47,500
And that makes
them quick to lose to

275
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,791
a more experienced opponent.

276
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:52,916
Bastard! Look at yourself!

277
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,125
You wanna teach
me how to fight?!

278
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:03,291
How pathetic. Could my
skills have dulled that much?

279
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:06,750
No, I just let my guard down.

280
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,416
Talk about weak.

281
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,833
So, this is the best a hero
of Hong Kong has to offer?

282
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,958
You know, sis said
you were stubborn.

283
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:24,250
She was right about that.
But at least that made this

284
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:27,125
better than my fight
with the Silver Blade.

285
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:29,833
What?

286
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,750
Yeah, I went at it with
the Silver Blade yesterday.

287
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:35,291
But he was a disappointment.
It wasn't even a proper fight.

288
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,958
I mean, I just don't
understand why my sister is so

289
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,916
hung up over a wimp like him.

290
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,833
Now then, what'll it be?

291
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:44,375
I'm sure that as an
Old Blood you have some

292
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,875
enormously inflated sense
of pride, and I don't wanna

293
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,416
put you down while
you lay there like a dog.

294
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,875
So why don't you try to stand?

295
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,250
To think I had forgotten
something so basic.

296
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:13,375
I won't be able to look
Lord Dragon in the eye.

297
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:16,458
What-- What's happening to you?

298
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:20,958
What? You wanna know what?

299
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,541
"Rage" you pathetic child!

300
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,541
Rage!

301
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:30,458
Cain the Blue Wolf!
Alright. You're dead!

302
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:03,750
Remember this:
if Jiro lays down his life

303
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:06,750
and draws his sword
you can rest assured

304
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,375
that not even
Lady Cassa would be

305
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,625
a match for
his immense power.

306
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,000
He is indisputably the hero,

307
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:16,750
the Source Blood Killer,
who saved our world.

308
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,958
Hello?!

309
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,000
Is anyone home?

310
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,541
Oh...

311
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,208
Excuse me.

312
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:48,041
Oh! Pardon me for
barging in here like this.

313
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,083
I'm a compromiser
with the Company

314
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,666
and I've come to as--

315
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:57,833
He isn't dead.
He's just unconscious.

316
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,166
Was it a vampire?

317
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,000
No, there are no bite marks.

318
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,416
It looks like someone
just knocked him out.

319
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,500
What?

320
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:06,958
But why would
someone knock him out,

321
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:09,291
then not take any of his stuff?

322
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,500
What is it?

323
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,333
Wait...

324
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:21,583
This is a stockpile
of blood for vampires.

325
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,250
They must be selling it.

326
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:26,166
Oh no. Is this all blood?

327
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:28,833
Battery's dead.

328
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,458
Use mine.

329
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:31,958
Thanks, Miss Wong.

330
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,000
Oh, good.
Chief, it's Katsuragi.

331
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:39,458
I'm in the fourth
yard right now,

332
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:42,583
and I've discovered an
illegal inventory of blood.

333
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:45,166
I need you to send someone
over here immediately.

334
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,666
Understood. I've got the
perfect person right here.

335
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,750
I'll send her over now.
She needs to see you anyway.

336
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,500
Here, she wants to talk to you.

337
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:55,166
Oh. All right.

338
00:21:57,083 --> 00:22:00,708
Are you there, Mimiko?
It's me, Kelly Wong.

339
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,583
What's wrong? Mimiko?

340
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:02,500
I don't give a damn how you
do it, but put all our resources

341
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:04,791
in to damage control
and cover this thing up!

342
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:06,458
You men have kept
the Special Zone together

343
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:07,875
these past ten years!

344
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:10,791
Demonstrate your strength!
We have to do this!

345
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:12,750
Our honor is at stake!

346
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:16,125
