1
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:50,500
Mochituki, Mochi--

2
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:54,500
Wait, I'll get it.
Ah! Mochi...

3
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:56,916
What's wrong with just calling
me Jiro, like you always have?

4
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,375
Well...

5
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:01,916
I think you're making things
too complicated, my lady.

6
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,166
Why can't you call me Alice?

7
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,291
Fine. Then why don't
you just call me Jiro.

8
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,750
No way!

9
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:09,666
I want to be able to
call you by your full name.

10
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:17,791
Jiro Motizuki? Jiro
Mochidizuki? Mochitu--

11
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:21,541
It's Jiro Mochizuki.

12
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:25,916
So, what exactly
does Motizuki mean anyway?

13
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,458
Mochizuki.

14
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,250
Don't be so mean.

15
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,458
Look.

16
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,583
The full moon?

17
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:37,625
The full moon!

18
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:40,083
So your name must
mean "full moon" am I right?

19
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:42,958
Jiro Motizuki! Jiro Motizuki!

20
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:46,208
Mochiduki! Mochiduki!

21
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:50,166
Mochituki! Mochituki!

22
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:26,000
What are you
doing here, Auguste?

23
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,875
He an acquaintance of yours?

24
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,916
No way. He's a known criminal.

25
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,041
He's a coven extremists and
one of Zelman Clock's cronies.

26
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,125
Did you say Zelman?

27
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,750
Wait, you mean
Crimson-Eyed Zelman?

28
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,375
What's he doing here?

29
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:46,291
Well... He's the ringleader
of our group, the Coven.

30
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,791
Interesting.

31
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,958
The Coven is a group that
completely defies the Company

32
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,000
and the Special
Zone's conventions.

33
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,458
And Zelman's at
the center of it all.

34
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,291
Have you have you
heard of him before?

35
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,666
Yes. And I'm
beginning to see...

36
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,750
the Special Zone is home to
the most unexpected people.

37
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:02,958
I'll have you know,

38
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:05,166
I've been appointed
Zelman's right hand man.

39
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,041
If anything were to happen to
me, he wouldn't take it lightly.

40
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,666
Is that right?

41
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,458
Yes. So think twice
before you kill me.

42
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,208
Believe me, I
have no desire to

43
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:17,625
pick a fight with
Crimson-Eyed Zelman.

44
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,208
I'm no fool.

45
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,458
But what about
a coward like you?

46
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,791
When you return will
you ask for an appeal?

47
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,625
Will you ask him to
avenge your honor because

48
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,875
Silver Blade mocked you?

49
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,333
You little bastard.

50
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,458
He's not strong at all,

51
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,958
but he's braggin' about
how powerful his friend is?

52
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,375
He's the bastard.

53
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,208
Language!

54
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,250
I think you're right.

55
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:43,291
And now I have just one
question I'd like you to answer.

56
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:44,583
What's that?

57
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:47,250
Was this attack
sanctioned by Zelman?

58
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,541
No.

59
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,166
Auguste has acted on his own.

60
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,625
Is that so?
And who might you be?

61
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,500
My name is Sayuka.

62
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,958
I'm the personal
assistant to Zelman Clock.

63
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,000
It's an honor to meet you.

64
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,083
My master wishes
to speak with you.

65
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,750
So please, come with me.

66
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,166
Come on, Hibari.

67
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,000
It may be a juicy rumor,
but don't you think

68
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,000
it sounds a little
too good to be true.

69
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,583
But it is true!

70
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:24,583
You see. The person acting as
the Silver Blade's guide is--

71
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:27,166
Ooooh it's Mimiko Katsuragi!

72
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:31,416
Mimiko Katsuragi. Sorry,
that doesn't ring a bell.

73
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,000
I promise I'm not lying
to you. She's the one.

74
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,291
Okay, sure thing, Hibari.
Thanks you for the heads up.

75
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:40,125
Stories are the lifeblood of an
information broker, after all.

76
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,375
I just thought that I should

77
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,333
return the favor
from the other day.

78
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,041
So I guess you
could say we're even now.

79
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,208
Well, I sympathize
with the girl.

80
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,208
This Mimiko Katsuragi. She's
gonna be in for a rough time.

81
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,666
I wouldn't want
to be her, right now.

82
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,875
Your guests have arrived.

83
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,333
You're here.

84
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:19,083
I know. Humans are
attracted to us vampires.

85
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,958
I feel it in the way you stare.

86
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,708
It's written all over your face.

87
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,833
Wow you're pretty.

88
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,000
Thanks.

89
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:36,041
How are you?
My name's Kotaro Mochizuki.

90
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,458
It seems that you're
the only one in this bunch

91
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,833
with any manners, little boy.

92
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:47,083
That's an odd little brother
you have there, Silver Blade.

93
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:51,375
He somehow seems different
than the reincarnations of Sei.

94
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:55,000
You speak as if
you knew The Sage.

95
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,625
No. Unfortunately
I've never met her.

96
00:06:58,541 --> 00:06:59,458
But then...

97
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:00,791
If you live as long as I have,

98
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:04,291
you tend to hear
all sorts of stories.

99
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Enjoy the cola.

100
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,250
Yes!

101
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,000
You shouldn't be so tense.

102
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:18,708
Staying on edge all the time
will only be to your detriment.

103
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:23,833
Go ahead.

104
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,250
Thanks for the cookies.

105
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:29,833
I didn't expect such
a low brow reception

106
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,541
from the Crimson-Eyed Zelman.

107
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,416
Oh please. Can we
stop with these games?

108
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,000
Didn't know I was playing.

109
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,083
You're so uptight compared
to your little brother.

110
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,500
Did you not learn anything
from the Sage's teachings?

111
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,708
That's a subject that
I'd rather not talk about.

112
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:46,250
Surely the matter is of
no concern to you, Zelman.

113
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,875
Well. That's true enough.

114
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,166
Let's say we...

115
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,541
start from beginning.

116
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,000
It's a pleasure to make your
acquaintance, Zelman Clock.

117
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,166
He with eyes the color of blood.

118
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,333
The last descendent of

119
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:13,166
the legendary Warrior
Asura's bloodline.

120
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,083
My name is Jiro Mochizuki.

121
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:17,458
And I am of the
Sage Eve's bloodline.

122
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,625
Ten years ago,
during Kowloon Shock,

123
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,166
I became known
as the Silver Blade.

124
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:27,166
Though I have lived a hundred
years, my pulse is yet shallow.

125
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,708
So may your
course be unhindered.

126
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:32,791
And may our hearts
both beat strongly.

127
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,291
That was quite
the formal introduction.

128
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,916
Auguste acted
without my permission

129
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,958
and for that I
apologize to you.

130
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,375
I thank you.

131
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:47,625
So, will you be joining
forces with the Company?

132
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:50,666
Have you not yet heard
of their plan, compromiser?

133
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,375
It seems that
your executives want

134
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,958
the Silver Blade
all to themselves.

135
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,416
They do? Oh.

136
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,500
Why would Jinnai assign
someone like her to

137
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:02,500
the task without even
explaining the situation?

138
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,583
If you have no intentions
of befriending anyone,

139
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:08,375
then I suppose that siding
with the Company is a good idea.

140
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:11,208
That way you'll retain a neutral
position when dealing with

141
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,291
the various houses in power.

142
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:16,750
Neutral. You must be joking.

143
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,416
I'm sure the Company
already has enough problems

144
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,250
keeping things
running smoothly.

145
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,041
Welcoming a nuisance
like myself would be

146
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,500
too much of a challenge.

147
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,208
What do you mean?

148
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,791
I don't think
that's true, brother.

149
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:32,708
I mean, Mimiko's really nice
and she works for the Company.

150
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,291
Maybe they'll be
as nice as she is.

151
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:37,208
I mean, you can't assume they'll
reject us without even asking.

152
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,958
The Company would only
welcome us for their own gain.

153
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,958
But you don't
know that, brother!

154
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,666
The Company people
need us, right?

155
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,250
What would be so
wrong about helping them

156
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,541
with their problems?

157
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:52,250
You may be right, Kotaro.

158
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,416
People's hearts often have
both a hidden and an open side.

159
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,166
And just because
there is a hidden agenda,

160
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,041
that doesn't mean that what's
out in the open is meaningless.

161
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,791
Right. Right!

162
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,333
Yes.

163
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,375
It seems your older brother
was being a little presumptuous.

164
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,000
I hope you'll forgive me.

165
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:11,958
Unbelievable. Did you
say your name was Kotaro?

166
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,250
Yeah.

167
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,375
To be honest, I've
developed quite an interest

168
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,750
in you and your brother, Kotaro.

169
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,708
So how about it?

170
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:21,958
Why don't you stay here
and join forces with me?

171
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,750
That's very nice,
but you're a bad person,

172
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,333
aren't you, Mr. Zelman?

173
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:31,708
Yes, but being one of the bad
guys can have its advantages.

174
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:35,416
I like to fight for justice.
I don't want to give that up.

175
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,541
Evil never wins,
but good always will!

176
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:39,875
Is that so?

177
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,750
Then that's too bad.

178
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,875
But if you ever tire
of the Company's justice,

179
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:49,250
don't hesitate to come back.
You'll always be welcome.

180
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,833
Thanks but I don't want you
to hold your breath waiting.

181
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,708
My brother and I
are vampires of justice

182
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,750
and I don't see us changing.

183
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:03,875
Silver Blade, Kotaro,
and the compromiser.

184
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,750
I'd like to thank
you for the visit.

185
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,666
This was truly a pleasant
way to stave off boredom.

186
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,666
When next we meet,
we may be enemies.

187
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,750
But yet I look forward
to seeing you again.

188
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,958
Farewell for now.

189
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,791
I can't believe it.

190
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,833
He's just letting
them walk out of here?

191
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,375
Auguste, you need
to just calm down.

192
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:33,833
It has yet to be determined if
the Silver Blade is our enemy.

193
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:39,083
It seems Zelman's fangs have
dulled with the passage of time.

194
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,875
Or perhaps he's
simply lost his nerve with

195
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,291
the return of this Kin-Killer.

196
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,958
You arrogant fool!

197
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:53,916
Damn it. I can deal with
this humiliation no longer.

198
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,666
The great Auguste Wyker will
not back down without a fight.

199
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:02,541
You'll pay for what you've
done to me, Silver Blade.

200
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,666
The master is busy right
now and can't be disturbed.

201
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,625
You'll have to try again later.

202
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,125
Hey.

203
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:24,750
Wait. What's going on?

204
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,750
Don't worry, Mimiko.
I'm sure they have reason for

205
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,958
not meeting with us.
Remember, not everything is

206
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,875
always as it appears to be.

207
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,708
But what are we gonna do?

208
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,583
That was unexpected.

209
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:42,208
I can't believe that the Sei
and Warlock Houses would

210
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:45,333
both refuse to
accept the Silver Blade.

211
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,458
I was sure they would
jump at the opportunity to

212
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:48,833
bring him into their fold.

213
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:49,916
If they did so they would

214
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,166
definitely strengthen
their influence.

215
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,750
They must have a reason for

216
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:56,500
rejecting him of
which we're unaware.

217
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,875
The affiliate houses have
continued to show honesty

218
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,500
and deference to us to
ensure that humans will remain

219
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,791
in the position of leadership.

220
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,166
Even if they don't
believe in what we do,

221
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:10,041
they've always made a
public show of supporting us.

222
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,791
But now it seems that
they're keeping secrets.

223
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:17,083
I will investigate
the matter immediately.

224
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,250
Please do.

225
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,708
Mimi, what're we
going to do now?

226
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:28,125
Let's just go
back to my place.

227
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,541
I'll cook you
something for dinner.

228
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,000
Yay!

229
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,208
Hey. Why'd we stop?

230
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:37,458
There's something I
haven't asked you yet.

231
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:38,708
And what's that?

232
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:41,083
Now, be honest with me.

233
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,666
Why did you come
here to the Special Zone?

234
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,583
The truth. Jiro, now.

235
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,375
And look me in the eye.

236
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,583
Um, well, it's just that I--

237
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,375
Ah! Look at me.

238
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,250
And if you use
the Eye Raid on me

239
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:58,541
I'll beat the crap out of you.

240
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,583
I have no intention
of doing that.

241
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,708
Then answer.

242
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,500
Well, I...

243
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:05,583
Hey, there!

244
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,458
We had just about
given up on you.

245
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:09,875
Where on earth
have you been hiding?

246
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,250
Jiro, darling.

247
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,916
Do you know how long
we've been waiting for you?!

248
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,291
What's the--?

249
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:20,666
Well, you know,
I just didn't feel right,

250
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,958
inviting ourselves
into this girl's apartment.

251
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:25,916
That's no excuse for forcing the
Lord Dragon to dine outdoors.

252
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,833
It's fine.

253
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,041
But...

254
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,500
I haven't had
a picnic in a while.

255
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,458
It's fun.

256
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:35,833
Oh, I see then. I'm so happy
to hear that. In that case,

257
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,500
I'll do my best to refrain from

258
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,583
complaining for
the rest of the evening.

259
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,125
It's quite insulting
to make promises to

260
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,125
the Lord Dragon that
you incapable of keeping.

261
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,875
What did you just say to me?

262
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:49,041
So what is the reason for
your visit to the Special Zone?

263
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:52,125
I'm not obligated to
answer any of your questions.

264
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:53,375
Then why don't you leave!

265
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:56,083
Nor am I obligated
to do as you say.

266
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,458
You're nothing but a nuisance.

267
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,500
And why is that my problem?

268
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,625
He's the general
manager of the Marine Bank!

269
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:04,541
I don't think talking to him
like that's such a good idea.

270
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:05,666
Don't worry.

271
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,791
Excuse me for
saying so, but you've

272
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:10,541
certainly reincarnated
into a rather cute new form.

273
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,791
It's good seeing you.

274
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,291
I never got a chance to
thank you for what you did.

275
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:19,208
It's in the past.
Forget about it.

276
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:24,083
So, you're a black
blood too, aren't you?

277
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,333
And you live at
that giant mansion

278
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:26,958
we went to earlier today?

279
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:27,958
Yes.

280
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,291
That's awesome.

281
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,500
And your name must
be Sei, am I right?

282
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,583
That's right.

283
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,291
Nice to meet you.
My name's Kotaro.

284
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,375
Kotaro?

285
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:38,000
Yup! You don't
talk much, do you, Sei?

286
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,583
I don't know why,
but for some reason

287
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,708
you remind me of the princess.

288
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,250
She's my older sister.

289
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:46,583
What?

290
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,708
The Dark Princess of
the North. That's my sister.

291
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,125
No way! Really?!

292
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,208
Really. We have
the same parents.

293
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,875
What a surprise!

294
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:57,708
But I haven't seen
her in a very long time.

295
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,708
I can't wait till
we see each other again.

296
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,625
Wow. That's amazing!

297
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:05,208
I never thought I'd meet
the princess' little brother.

298
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,541
We can be best friends.

299
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,625
I just came out of
the princess' sanctuary

300
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:11,458
and I really don't know much
about the outside world yet.

301
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,708
Your name's Cain, right mister?

302
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,791
And you're my
brother's friend, huh?

303
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,083
I-I wouldn't say that.

304
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,583
Cain and I are simply
old acquaintances, Kotaro.

305
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:23,166
He used to run out on errands
all the time to fetch bread

306
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,166
and milk for our
group back in the day.

307
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,250
The hell I did!

308
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,750
Oh yeah? But you
always took care of

309
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:30,000
an assortment of
chores for us, remember?

310
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,166
You're such a fool.

311
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,541
I did that for the
Lady Sage and Cassandra.

312
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:40,083
I was merely looking after the
best interests of the Lady Sage.

313
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,166
I never did anything for you.

314
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,166
Ummm. Excuse me.
May I say something?

315
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,666
Yes. What is it?

316
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,750
Earlier this afternoon, I took
these two by the Marine Bank

317
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:59,625
and to Sei's residence. They
wanted to gain acceptance to

318
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:03,666
one of the houses,
but in both cases...

319
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:05,875
Jiro, I--

320
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,000
Lord Dragon.

321
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,125
Allow me to explain it to them.

322
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:13,583
The real reason they refused
to grant you an interview today

323
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,750
is because I
ordered them not to.

324
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:19,041
At the moment, I'm
afraid we cannot welcome

325
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,333
the Silver Blade
into our house.

326
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,750
And, furthermore,

327
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,916
we can't allow him to
stay in the Special Zone.

328
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,875
What? Why can't he stay?

329
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:30,333
You two are old
friends, aren't you?

330
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,250
Jiro fought against
the Kowloon Children.

331
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:35,208
He protected the Special Zone.
I think he's earned this.

332
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,666
I'm afraid that's
neither here nor there.

333
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,083
Wherever the Silver Blade goes,

334
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:42,291
unnecessary commotions
arise and follow in his wake.

335
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,625
And there's no guarantee
that the next commotion that

336
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,250
arises around Jiro will be as

337
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,958
easily contained as
the float mart incident.

338
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,750
The presence of the
Silver Blade is nothing but

339
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,833
kindling for conflict
in the Special Zone.

340
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,625
That's terrible.
You can't blame him for that.

341
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,208
He shouldn't have to leave.

342
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:59,750
He's has nowhere else
to go! I can't believe this.

343
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:02,625
You're just going
to abandon your friend?

344
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:05,833
It's... it's so unfair.
He hasn't done anything wrong.

345
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,875
The Special Zone....

346
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:11,375
is not as peaceful
as it appears to be.

347
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:15,083
I know that you're not
happy with what I've said.

348
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:18,166
But you're a compromiser
so you must understand

349
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,333
and you must
respect our decision.

350
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,250
I know.

351
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:38,083
What are we gonna do?

352
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,916
We've been turned
down on all sides.

353
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,250
It's okay.

354
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:45,208
I'm sorry. There must
be a way for you to stay.

355
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,083
I hate to ask you
for another favor, but--

356
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:52,500
Would you mind putting
us up for another night?

357
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,375
You wanna go home?

358
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,083
Enough is enough.

359
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,208
Have you not
learned your lesson?!

360
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,541
I told you,
didn't I, Silver Blade?

361
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:26,166
That you wouldn't get
away with making a fool of me.

362
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:30,916
It's made of silver.
And all insolent newcomers...

363
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,125
get their heads lopped off.
And that's the Coven's code.

364
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,166
I heard nothing of
this code from Zelman.

365
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,625
That's because he doesn't
know anything about it.

366
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:45,375
That Zelman. He doesn't
care about our Coven.

367
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:46,958
Damn it all!

368
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,041
Are you intoxicated
or just insane?

369
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:54,375
If I were you I'd
stop taking this so lightly.

370
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:08,791
Damn it!

371
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:13,500
Don't worry
about them, just fight!

372
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,750
Could he be turning into--

373
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,625
No. If he were, the change
would be instantaneous.

374
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,916
That kind of
delay shouldn't occur.

375
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,833
You three, tell me
what you've done to him!

376
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,916
W-What are you're talking about?

377
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,333
Damn. That's it!
I'm getting out of here!

378
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,666
Hey!

379
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,666
Damn lowlifes.

380
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,250
Come on Silver Blade...

381
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,083
I don't know why
I ever gave a damn

382
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,791
what that fool
Zelman thought about me.

383
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:54,041
I haven't felt
this excited in ages.

384
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,291
You give me no choice.

385
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,958
No Jiro, don't do it!
If you stir up trouble now,

386
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,666
you'll give everyone the
excuse they've been looking for.

387
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:09,916
Pardon me. I guess I was
just being a little impatient.

388
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,625
I'm not playing
around, Silver Blade!

389
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:14,000
It's a matter of life or death!

390
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,416
Hate to disappoint you.
But we're done here.

391
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,000
I won't kill you now.

392
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,791
Even though I have no qualms
with cracking your head open.

393
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:24,291
So go home to Zelman.
And receive your punishment.

394
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,750
Bastard!

395
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,791
Have it your way.
But I'll make sure

396
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:38,458
you acknowledge me,
no matter what it takes.

397
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,583
I'll burn your ass for sure!

398
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,875
Brother, he didn't
hurt you, did he?

399
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm fine.

400
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:48,333
Thank goodness.

401
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,958
But I have my suspicions.
Something was different.

402
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:52,083
Huh?

403
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:54,166
Auguste was like
another person from

404
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,333
when we say him
earlier at the market.

405
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:57,916
Yeah, I guess he was.

406
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:02,375
Well, Mimiko. What do you
say we go home for the night?

407
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,166
Sure thing.

408
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:17,833
No. That's my house.

409
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:03,666
I promise, Auguste Wyker,

410
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:08,041
I will carve the ways of the
Black Blood into your bones.

411
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:15,708
Episode Seven: "Silver Blade"
