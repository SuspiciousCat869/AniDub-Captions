1
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:03,291
Alice, no!

2
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:13,875
Cassa!

3
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:19,500
Don't do that! You scared me.

4
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:23,375
You're such an utter failure.

5
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:27,291
You're better suited to be her
playmate than her protector.

6
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,916
Don't be so hard on him.
Jiro's doing the best he can,

7
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,041
so why don't you cut
him some slack for once?

8
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:33,958
If you say so.

9
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,666
Cassa.

10
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:52,500
Cassa. What a weird dream.

11
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,250
What the--?!

12
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:02,166
Oh. Good morning, Mimiko.

13
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,250
And good morning to you, Kotaro.

14
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:05,750
What's going on?

15
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:08,208
Don't worry about it.
I just had a little accident

16
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,083
and I don't wanna talk about it.

17
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,958
Oh.

18
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:25,791
Nice, huh? We've got a great
view of the river from here.

19
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,166
Yeah.

20
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,958
So is this still
the Special Zone?

21
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,916
That's right. Why do you ask?

22
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,291
Cause it looks a lot different
than it did last night.

23
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,000
Oh. Right.

24
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,750
The Special Zone's
a pretty big place.

25
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,625
What you saw
yesterday was the New Yard.

26
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:48,125
But now you're in the Old Yard.

27
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:51,416
And I guess that this area is
what you'd call our Downtown.

28
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,833
Looks like someone's moving in.

29
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,875
I didn't know that
the building across

30
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:01,041
the street was residential.

31
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,541
Can we eat soon, Mimi?
I'm starved.

32
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:07,083
Oh, right. Sorry about that.
Let's see what we've got to eat.

33
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:08,541
Do you think we should
wake Jiro up for breakfast?

34
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,000
Yeah.

35
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:14,250
I can't feel him breathing. You
sure he's still alive, Kotaro?

36
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,375
He's fine.
He's just sound asleep.

37
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,875
I bet he's really tired.

38
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:22,000
He didn't get to sleep
any during the day yesterday.

39
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:26,083
It doesn't look
like he's gonna wake up.

40
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,083
Well, I hope he
does soon, 'cause we have

41
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,750
to find you guys a
place to live today.

42
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:33,625
But I thought that we would
all just live here together.

43
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:36,000
Don't you think that it
would be a little cramped?

44
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,583
And besides,
grown-ups don't usually

45
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:43,250
move in together so casually.

46
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,875
But it's a pretty nice
apartment, don't you think?

47
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,750
Yeah. It's small,
but that just makes it feel

48
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,500
like a secret
hideout or something.

49
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,583
Thanks, I guess.

50
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:55,500
Oh no!

51
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,375
What time is it?
I have to go to wo--

52
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,708
Brother did that earlier. He
doesn't get modern appliances.

53
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:06,250
So he couldn't figure
out how to turn it off.

54
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,791
I'm massively late.

55
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:35,666
Wake the hell up!

56
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,208
You're sure about this?

57
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,916
Has the Silver Blade really
entered the Special Zone?

58
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,291
Yes. I have no doubt.

59
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:48,583
And I believe that every
other powerful group within

60
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,500
the Special Zone
is currently trying to

61
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,333
determine how best
to deal with his arrival.

62
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:56,625
Do you think they plan
to gain him as an ally?

63
00:05:56,708 --> 00:06:00,833
Or perhaps, their aim
is to put an end to him.

64
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:04,083
Hypothetically speaking, if
Silver Blade and Zelman were to

65
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,291
clash in the Special Zone...

66
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,916
Could the suppression
team gain control of

67
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
the situation and
put them down quietly?

68
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,500
Impossible.

69
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,708
The battle between
the Hero of the Crusade

70
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:16,916
and an eight hundred year old

71
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,208
Black Blood
would be devastating.

72
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:20,833
I doubt that we
would have any chance of

73
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:23,000
stopping it once it began.

74
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,083
They're too powerful.

75
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:30,291
Then, allow me
to express my opinion.

76
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:34,458
We, the Company, must
seize control of Silver Blade.

77
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,166
We must have him,
no matter what the cost.

78
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:41,333
Keeping him in our custody, is
like harboring a bomb, Chairman.

79
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,375
I think it's better to
have him in our custody

80
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:47,125
than to hand him over
to the affiliate houses.

81
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,166
But that's just my opinion.

82
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,208
I'd like to hear your
thoughts on the matter...

83
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:55,916
As one of the human heroes.

84
00:06:56,708 --> 00:07:01,000
Let's just say that I've...
already taken action on this.

85
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,041
You've always been
quick on the draw.

86
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:08,166
I ask this merely out
of personal curiosity.

87
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,916
But what kind of man
is this Silver Blade?

88
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,916
You are acquainted
with him, are you not?

89
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,416
That was a long time ago,
a lot's changed since then.

90
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,958
When I knew him,
he was just an immature brat.

91
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:22,375
A child to say the least.

92
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,041
Well then.

93
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,208
I'll leave him to you.

94
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:27,958
Chairman!

95
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,666
Are you sure about this?

96
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,833
I have my doubts.

97
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:34,875
Jinnai. Don't screw up.

98
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:44,583
Don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me.

99
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,833
I promise it won't hurt.

100
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:53,583
It'll be the most pleasurable
thing you've ever experienced.

101
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:59,000
Prepare for the
ultimate physical pleasure.

102
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,416
Don't make me chase you.

103
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,083
What do you propose we
do about the Silver Blade?

104
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:26,125
I assume he'll approach
the Sei or Warlock house.

105
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:29,291
That makes sense. They do
have a history with him.

106
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,291
They met when they were in the
crusade together in Hong Kong.

107
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:35,416
So, it is possible that he'll
join forces with one of them.

108
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,666
Either way. It won't
be good for us if they

109
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,375
become any more
powerful than they are now.

110
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,041
This might be a
good opportunity for us to

111
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,708
show them what The Coven
is truly capable of.

112
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,833
No doubt about it.

113
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:51,958
So the Hero of the
Hong Kong crusade is here.

114
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:59,041
We'll need to
lay down the law...

115
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:02,791
as one of the leaders
of the Special Zone.

116
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,291
So this is where I work.

117
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,541
Cemetery management
is just our front.

118
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,000
Alright. Wait here a minute

119
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,625
and I'll see if I can find
anything that will help us.

120
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:26,666
Good morning everybody.
Uh, I'm sorry I'm so late.

121
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,375
Looks like nobody's here.

122
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,416
Oh, I'm sorry. Wait
a minute, Miss Mimiko.

123
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,208
Where in the
world have you been?

124
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:39,583
Hey, Hibari?! Good morning.

125
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,416
Don't "good morning"
me, Mimiko.

126
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,375
Everyone's been in an
uproar all morning long

127
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,208
because of what
happened yesterday.

128
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,291
The chief's been trying
to reach you all day.

129
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,708
He must have called
you a hundred times.

130
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:54,458
What's the deal? What have you
been doing all this time anyway?

131
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:58,250
Oh, you know,
stuff came up, things.

132
00:09:58,333 --> 00:09:59,583
Everyone went
racing off to their

133
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:03,083
assigned affiliate houses
a couple of hours ago.

134
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,708
You might want to think
about joining them soon.

135
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:08,083
Yeah. I guess
I should get going.

136
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,458
Here you go.

137
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:10,250
Thanks.

138
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,708
Sure.

139
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,416
More importantly, Miss Mimiko.

140
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,041
I have some top
secret information that

141
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,458
has to stay between us.

142
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:19,041
Don't tell anyone, but
apparently yesterday's incident

143
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,875
involved the
famous Silver Blade.

144
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,958
Oh, right.

145
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,208
Did you hear what I said?
The Silver Blade!

146
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,958
The hero of the
Hong Kong crusade that

147
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,458
took place a decade ago.

148
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:31,083
He's the most powerful vampire
to ever side with humans.

149
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,166
A legendary man that
everyone in our line of

150
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,833
work surely knows about.

151
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,416
They say the
suppression team was

152
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,958
completely helpless
against him yesterday.

153
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,666
And they said he was laughing
as he wiped out the group of

154
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,916
vampires that
caused the commotion.

155
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,958
And now, they think
that this Silver Blade guy

156
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,291
may have made his way
into the Special Zone.

157
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,083
And to top it all off,
they think that somebody who

158
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:53,541
works for the company
actually invited him in. Crazy!

159
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,458
Okay, Hibari. Just calm down.

160
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,333
And now I might end up coming
face to face with him someday.

161
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,708
What'll I do? What'll I do?

162
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:05,000
What if he attacks me
and wants to suck my blood?

163
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,458
Talk about embarrassing!

164
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,166
What's the matter?

165
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,208
Oh. There you are.

166
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,375
Mimiko!

167
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,375
Look! I'm hangin' out!

168
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,916
Hot, hot, hot, hot,
hot, hot, hot, hot!

169
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,541
I must be really tired.
I think I'm seeing things.

170
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,875
That little kid was
a vampire, wasn't he?

171
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:42,625
Owie! Owie! That
wasn't very nice of her.

172
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,250
That's what you get
for not staying here

173
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,041
like she told you to.

174
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:47,791
Miss Mimiko! Is that--?!

175
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,208
Don't say another word!

176
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:52,541
Listen. You can't tell a
soul what you just saw, okay?

177
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,625
You understand, don't you?

178
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:58,750
I'm not playing around here.
Keep your mouth shut!

179
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,291
Now I have to go out for
a while to run some errands.

180
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:06,375
So please, keep our
little secret just between us.

181
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,791
Big news! Big news!
I have to tell everyone!

182
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,208
Aw man!

183
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,541
We need to lay low for a while.

184
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,291
At least until
things calm down a bit.

185
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,583
But who knows when that'll be.

186
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,791
Sounds like a
splendid suggestion.

187
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,958
Let's go back to your place
and catch up on our sleep.

188
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:36,458
No way!

189
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:38,708
My superiors could decide to
come by my house to see me,

190
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,625
and then there'd be no escape.

191
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:43,000
You poured water
on me this morning.

192
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,791
And I've been walking
around in the sun all day.

193
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:48,041
I can't tell you how
incredibly tired I am.

194
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:51,916
I've got an idea. Let's do
something relaxing, huh?

195
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,416
I've got it.

196
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,750
Here's what I'm gonna do.

197
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:59,166
I am going to find
you guys a place to live.

198
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,458
But, I want to
live with you, Mimi--

199
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,041
No discussion.

200
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,916
Okay. In the Special
Zone, once you've decided

201
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,458
where you want to live,
you go introduce yourself to

202
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:09,541
the head of
the House that

203
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,625
claims leadership
of that territory.

204
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,500
Those who belong to the same
house live clustered together.

205
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,250
And then those people
who don't belong to any of

206
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,666
the Houses are considered
to be guests of the House that

207
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,208
controls the area in
which they take residence.

208
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:24,041
Firstly, we need to decide
where you want to live.

209
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:27,000
There are three major Houses
that control different areas of

210
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,000
the Special Zone.
And the first one is--

211
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,083
The Mainland faction.

212
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:32,416
Another is the European faction.

213
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,125
And the final
group is a coalition.

214
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:38,708
Or to put it another way, they
are Snakes, Dogs, and Darkness.

215
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,916
Does that about sum it up?

216
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,250
H-How did you know all of that?

217
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,208
It's simply a microcosm
of the world at large.

218
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:48,250
Things never change, you know?
And, since I myself never age,

219
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,666
I've come to understand
a few things in my long life.

220
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,541
You're so smart, brother.

221
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,083
It's common knowledge.

222
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,000
Well, then. You'll have
to choose between the

223
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,750
three houses you mentioned
when you pick a place to live.

224
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,250
I know you ruled out one, right?

225
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:07,083
No Darkness.

226
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:10,708
I see. Those from the House
of Darkness who settled here

227
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:13,166
show no signs
of progress either.

228
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,500
Mimiko!

229
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,208
Are you ready to get started?

230
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,416
As we look for a place to
live we should treat ourselves

231
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,583
to a tour of the Special Zone.

232
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,000
Now, let's get going.

233
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,916
All right! We're off
to explore the Special Zone.

234
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,541
Hey. Hold on! Wait for me!

235
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:30,875
Now, this isn't a field trip.

236
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,916
Choosing you area
is serious business.

237
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,666
'Kay!

238
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,208
I mean it!

239
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,666
May I enter now?

240
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,875
Hello, Lord Zelman. I've come
to report my findings to you.

241
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,375
Good.

242
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:15,708
I've been waiting, Sayuka.

243
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,083
What is this, Zelman?

244
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,041
Don't throw a fit.

245
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,750
Auguste's crew
sent her over to me

246
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,958
in an attempt
to curry my favor.

247
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:28,291
Please tell me that
you've restrained yourself.

248
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,458
A human prepared
for you by the Coven.

249
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:31,875
There's no telling what
the Company will do to you

250
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,541
once they've
caught wind of this.

251
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,458
Don't worry, Sayuka.

252
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:38,666
I've made sure
to keep her alive.

253
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,000
If you find yourself
thirsting for blood,

254
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:43,375
then please, summon me.

255
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,333
After all. That's one
of the reasons why

256
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,625
I'm here to serve
you, Lord Zelman.

257
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,750
You dare to reprimand me?

258
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:53,125
You've grown
annoying as of late.

259
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,833
So...

260
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,333
What is it you've come
to report to me, Sayuka?

261
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,125
Well... The executives
of the Company have

262
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,333
entrusted the handling
of Silver Blade to

263
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:07,250
the Mediation Department.

264
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:10,291
Mediation. That's Jinnai, then?

265
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,916
He was a member of
the Hong Kong group.

266
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,375
Isn't that right?

267
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:15,416
Yes, sir.

268
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,625
And I believe
he fought alongside

269
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,500
Silver Blade in the crusade.

270
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,875
So he'll be on the
Company's side for sure.

271
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,750
No. He appeared
at the Marine Bank

272
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,291
earlier today to
seek a residence.

273
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,833
Oh-ho. The Warlock house, is it?

274
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,833
But it appears that
Cain Warlock refused to

275
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:32,041
see him for some
reason or another.

276
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:35,250
And now, the Silver Blade is
headed towards the Old Yard.

277
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,500
Given this information,
most likely,

278
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,500
he is now on his
way to meet with Sei.

279
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,458
That's great. This
is getting interesting.

280
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,958
However, Auguste Wyker's
group is beginning to show signs

281
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,000
of movement. And I'm
afraid that you will be

282
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,916
held responsible
if they run amuck.

283
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,083
I don't care
about that. Ignore them.

284
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:51,708
But sir--

285
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,875
I'm over it.

286
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,500
Does The Silver Blade have
a companion traveling with him?

287
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:59,791
Yes, his younger
brother, supposedly.

288
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,166
I see.

289
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,750
Then who's this I sense?

290
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:10,000
Has Sei grown so weak
that he hasn't even noticed?

291
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,375
Talk about pathetic.

292
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,333
Pardon me, sir?

293
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:23,291
Your report
is much appreciated.

294
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:27,666
It was... nothing.

295
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,625
I'm going out.

296
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,500
But the sun hasn't
set yet. You can't go out.

297
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:36,000
A VIP who's maintained
his silence for

298
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,583
ten years has come to town.

299
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,750
There's no way I'm
gonna miss his appearance.

300
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:47,666
Please, Lord Zelman, wait!

301
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:00,750
Quite impressive.

302
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:03,208
This is amazing. I can't
believe you can buy things here!

303
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,833
Wow, they sell pots,
clothing, food...

304
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:07,958
You can find anything!
I wanna live here, brother.

305
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,541
Um, Mimiko.

306
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,541
I just don't
understand why they had to

307
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,041
have such a
bad attitude about it.

308
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,125
I mean, did they
have to be that rude?

309
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,541
Can you believe
the condescending look

310
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,125
that teller gave me?

311
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,041
That ticked me off.

312
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:21,583
So what if
they're a huge bank?!

313
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,833
They can't treat
people like that.

314
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,500
Just try not to
let it bother you.

315
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,291
And I could have
used a little more help.

316
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,375
I'm doing this
for you, you know?!

317
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,583
Come on now.

318
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:34,083
Let's just all try to
calm down a little bit.

319
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,875
Oh, uh... Would you
mind paying for these?

320
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,166
I guess.

321
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,541
Yay!

322
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,458
Kotaro! Get a
hold of yourself!

323
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,875
You keep jumping like that this
whole boat's gonna turn over.

324
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,125
Sorry.

325
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,875
As you can see,
the float mart is kind of

326
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:50,666
like the Old Yard's kitchen.

327
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,083
You can get just
about anything here.

328
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,083
Can we go in there?
Please, please?

329
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:59,541
Sure thing. You guys feel
like grabbing some lunch?

330
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,541
Jiro, are you
affected by garlic?

331
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,750
Don't move.

332
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,125
I think that they
have us surrounded.

333
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,166
How'd they find us out here?

334
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,750
Brother, are you okay?

335
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,166
It seems that members
of the Darkness have come to

336
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,250
welcome us to the Special Zone.

337
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:24,666
Don't worry.

338
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,583
They're not the most formidable
group I've come across.

339
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,333
We'll just try to sidestep
them here and draw them away.

340
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,666
Let's get outta here so
innocent people don't get hurt.

341
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,958
Hey, Kotaro. You think
that you can follow me?

342
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,458
Sure thing, brother.

343
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:48,125
Let's go, then!

344
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:49,875
Woo-hooo!

345
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,875
We're really
sorry about the boat, sir!

346
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,125
Just send the
bill to the Company.

347
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,583
Can't you draw less
attention to yourself?

348
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,125
That's not an option.

349
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:07,583
My only concern is getting
you back onto dry land safely.

350
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,291
I'm gonna be in so much trouble.

351
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,958
Now I'll see what the
Silver Blade's capable of.

352
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:25,166
How do I get myself
into these situations?

353
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,625
Impressive. You managed
to dodge all our

354
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,166
bullets out on the water.

355
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,208
I'm sure that was tiring.

356
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:35,708
What's wrong? Was that too
much of a work out for you?

357
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,166
Oh, that little
bit of action was

358
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,666
a piece of cake
for the legendary hero.

359
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,208
No doubt about it.

360
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:44,291
But now I've got you in my
sights, so don't make a move.

361
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:47,791
Or there'll be a mountain of
bodies caught in the crosshairs.

362
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:49,916
Why are you doing this?

363
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,416
Shut up, you company woman.

364
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,250
If I wanted to, I could
shoot you down right now.

365
00:20:56,041 --> 00:21:01,041
You can relax. We don't
on fighting anymore... today.

366
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,583
However, if you
decide to take up

367
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,958
residence here
in the Special Zone...

368
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,833
Well, you may be safe today,

369
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:10,500
but you never know
what might happen tomorrow.

370
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,083
Is that supposed to be a threat?

371
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:15,000
How about it, Silver
Blade? If you insist on

372
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:19,583
staying in the Special Zone,
why not join our proud Coven?

373
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:23,375
We'd certainly welcome you,
if you were one of us.

374
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,083
I've heard enough.

375
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,541
Kotaro.

376
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,458
What are you doing, Jiro?

377
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,750
You launched this
sneak attack on us.

378
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,125
And you've treated
us with such rudeness.

379
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:40,083
And now you ask, at gunpoint
no less, that I join you.

380
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:43,625
Your stupidity and ignorance
will lead you to your demise.

381
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,833
At my own hands.

382
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,541
I'll mete out your punishment.

383
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:50,416
After that, maybe
you'll finally wise up.

384
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:16,500
Die!

385
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:03,000
Did you say your name
was Kotaro? To be honest,

386
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:07,125
I've developed quite an interest
in you and your brother, Kotaro.

387
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:08,541
So how about it?

388
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:11,541
Why don't you stay here
and join forces with me?

389
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,125
