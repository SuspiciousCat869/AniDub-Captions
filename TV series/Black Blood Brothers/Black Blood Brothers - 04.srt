1
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,416
Uhh...

2
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,500
What?

3
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,000
Good evening, sir.

4
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,958
Oh... Good
evening to you, too.

5
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:33,958
Are you okay?
You weren't hurt were you?

6
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:36,291
I feel fine. I don't
think I'm injured.

7
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:38,208
But thanks for asking.

8
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,708
That's good to hear.

9
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,041
The carriage...

10
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,041
This is a horse
drawn carriage.

11
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,416
The horse on the
right is called Gale

12
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,625
and I like to call
the one on the left Gust.

13
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:52,750
We have to stop them.

14
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:54,250
Why would
you want to do that?

15
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,041
Because they're out of control!

16
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,625
It's okay. I almost
wish they could go faster.

17
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:00,541
But... Why?

18
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:03,208
Because we're...
running from someone.

19
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,166
Kotaro!

20
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,833
Enough!

21
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,541
No, Jiro. Wait!

22
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,458
You can't... You'll never
catch them in your condition.

23
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,041
Please let go.

24
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:10,041
You idiot... Go after them now
and you don't stand a chance.

25
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,500
I know what I'm doing.

26
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:14,625
And I don't have time to
stand around arguing with you.

27
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,583
Why didn't you tell me?

28
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:22,291
You wouldn't have
believed me, even if I did...

29
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:23,958
Not without this.

30
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,958
When I hold this
sword I am devoured by

31
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:28,875
the overwhelming
desires it bestows on me.

32
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:31,041
I thought I could
overcome these urges.

33
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:32,791
But I was wrong.
And because of that

34
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:35,625
I find myself in
this disgraceful state.

35
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:39,125
So please, Mimiko. I have
to find... my brother.

36
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm sworn to protect him.

37
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,333
I'm all that he
has left in this world.

38
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,208
I can't let him down.
I have to save him.

39
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,083
You might as well give up.

40
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,166
He won't listen to you no matter

41
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,875
how much you try
to persuade him.

42
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,458
I'll lend you my motorbike.

43
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,625
Maybe it will help
you catch up with those guys.

44
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,083
You know each other?

45
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,666
We sure do.

46
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,125
I've gone ahead
and shut down the streets

47
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,333
you'll be traveling on.

48
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,250
You'll have the
road to yourself.

49
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,583
Mimiko... We don't
have time for this.

50
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:08,083
And if you do catch up
with them, what will you do?

51
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:11,208
You can't possibly hope to
defeat them in your condition.

52
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,000
Just think!

53
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:17,416
I grow tired of your meddling.

54
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,916
Drink my blood
before you go then.

55
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:27,791
Wait a minute...

56
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,583
You're a compromiser, right?
This is strictly forbidden.

57
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,375
So don't tell anyone!

58
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,375
Sure thing.
I might not act like it...

59
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,500
But I am a
criminal investigator.

60
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,208
I'll let this slide.

61
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,166
Are you sure about this?

62
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,541
Just do it.

63
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:49,125
Well... While I
appreciate your offer

64
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,083
I do hope you
haven't forgotten.

65
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,208
Your company
currently restricts me from

66
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,333
entering the Special Zone.

67
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:02,166
You want to go save
Kotaro, don't you? So...

68
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:07,125
Hurry up and do it already.

69
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,750
More! Please more...

70
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,125
Mimiko...

71
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,083
Jiro?

72
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:33,791
It's over... I really
appreciate what you've done.

73
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:39,125
What... What's going
on? Where am I?

74
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:46,041
This was your first time
being bitten, wasn't it?

75
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,916
Huh? What are
you talking about?

76
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,041
Just take it easy... Start by
trying to stand up on your own.

77
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:56,791
I think I can hear
what you're thinking.

78
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,000
That's the phenomenon
know as resonance.

79
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,291
The blood of yours that is
now coursing through my body

80
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,416
is calling out to
the blood in your own.

81
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,166
Then does that
mean that you can...

82
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,041
Mimiko...

83
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,416
What is it?

84
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,958
You're drooling.

85
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,166
Please tell me that
this doesn't mean that

86
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,166
you can read my mind too.

87
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,166
Give it back. Give it back now.

88
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,708
Give my blood back
to me this instant.

89
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:25,041
I was kidding.

90
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:29,500
My blood has not entered
your body, so therefore...

91
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:32,125
There's really no way
for me to read your mind.

92
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,666
Really?

93
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,958
Right now, you can tell whether
or not I am lying. Can't you?

94
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:41,416
Yes... I can...

95
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,791
Don't worry.
It's only temporary.

96
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:47,541
The resonance will
disappear over time.

97
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:52,291
You've done a brave thing.
I can never thank you enough.

98
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:58,250
I am greatly indebted to
you from this day on, Mimiko.

99
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,666
I want to go with
you on your mission.

100
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,125
Miss Wong...

101
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,791
You would just slow us down...

102
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:10,041
Besides, they're no longer
the people you once knew.

103
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,083
I know...

104
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,333
But... I owe it to them...

105
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:17,125
They're my friends...
I want to see this through.

106
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,500
You need to go with them.

107
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,083
Who...? Me?

108
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:29,083
This woman here is not
a Kowloon Child. And so...

109
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,625
She's still
under the purview of

110
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,958
the compromiser who
started the negotiations.

111
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,750
Yes, that's true.

112
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,250
Mimiko... Thank you.

113
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,916
Just doing my job.

114
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:41,458
I have no intention of
apologizing at the moment.

115
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:44,500
But when this is all over
you'll have my gratitude.

116
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,208
So it's you...
The Silver Blade?

117
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm well aware... That I'm in no
position to ask you for favors,

118
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:01,125
but please... Help me...

119
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:06,000
Well, Jiro!

120
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,833
Since I am a hopeful
resident of the Special Zone...

121
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:12,125
I will make sure that the
Kowloon never make it in.

122
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:17,500
Okay, if you guys are done
with your pow wow session,

123
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,791
I think it's best that
we get this thing started.

124
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,458
So Jiro... Go do your thing.

125
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,000
With pleasure.

126
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,875
Damn it! Quit squirming!

127
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,666
And keep your mouth shut!

128
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,250
Brother, where are you?

129
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,583
Come beat this
rotten vampire to a pulp!

130
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,541
I think I might be sick.

131
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:05,625
Watch out!

132
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,583
Oh, right.

133
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,958
Keep going. Try to
link your senses with

134
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,625
Jiro to maintain your balance.

135
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,416
I'll try...

136
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,250
Incredible...

137
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,500
There they are!

138
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:10,583
Where?

139
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,416
Jiro has them in
his sights right now.

140
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:22,250
We're coming up
on the Twilight Bridge.

141
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,541
Then we should be there soon.

142
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,958
He's here... Impressive speed.

143
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:48,000
I wasn't expecting you to
catch up with us so quickly.

144
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,208
I guess what they
say about you is true...

145
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,208
Silver Blade.

146
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,458
Damn...

147
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,583
This annoying
little brat's been squirming

148
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,625
the whole time I've had him.

149
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,875
I only have one
arm, after all...

150
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:19,125
I don't need this unmanageable
little brat slowing me down.

151
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:22,208
I think I should
teach him some manners.

152
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,500
Tsang... That's
your name, isnt' it?

153
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,708
Yeah. Surprised
you remembered.

154
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:30,208
It's such an honor.
I'm touched. Really I am.

155
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,375
I'll forget it soon enough.

156
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,791
That's impossible!
He's using the Hide Hand!

157
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:49,791
Chan!

158
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:33,041
You shouldn't let your emotions
get the better of you...

159
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,666
Pathetic.

160
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,375
That's it!

161
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:50,083
Now you can play
together... in Hell.

162
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:57,500
What the Hell?
I was so close, dammit.

163
00:14:57,583 --> 00:15:00,083
What pathetic last words.

164
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,666
You'll never understand us.

165
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,416
You, whose bloodline
transcend death,

166
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,416
will never know
what we go through.

167
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,166
True. I don't
understand your hardships.

168
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,083
But neither can
you understand the destiny

169
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,875
and curse of my bloodline.

170
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,250
So don't assume that you do.

171
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,625
All my life I've
been surrounded by death.

172
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,291
I eat to live.

173
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,625
And I kill to eat!

174
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:34,416
That's... the life
of a Kowloon Child.

175
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,416
And that is no life.

176
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,625
You're a parasite for
whom I feel no sympathy.

177
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,833
You were very brave through
this whole ordeal, Kotaro.

178
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,333
Thanks, brother.

179
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,875
Chan...

180
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:50,375
Miss Wong... Bye...

181
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:17,875
The media's coming.

182
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,166
We have to get
away from here fast!

183
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,250
Do you think we should
go back to Chinatown?

184
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,916
I'm sure that area is still
crawling with Company forces.

185
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,125
And I bet the media
has gathered there as well.

186
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,291
What then?

187
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,541
We've only one place to go.

188
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,916
But, Mimiko, the barrier...
I can't get in.

189
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,458
What are you talking about?

190
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:41,416
Jiro Mochizuki...
Kotaro Mochizuki...

191
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,916
On behalf of the Company...

192
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,708
I invite you
into the Special Zone.

193
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,833
I, Mimiko Katsuragi,
welcome you

194
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:49,750
and sincerely hope
you enjoy your stay.

195
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:57,625
I see. Got it. Looks
like we've managed to

196
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,625
avoid the worst
possible scenario.

197
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,875
I hope you're not
getting ahead of yourself.

198
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:04,000
I mean... just think
of all the bad publicity

199
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,041
this incident
is sure to stir up.

200
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:09,625
But he did well for us. Why
not give him a little credit?

201
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:10,541
Credit?

202
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,083
Don't fool yourself.

203
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,125
His involvement in this
matter has only resulted

204
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,583
in greater losses
for the Company.

205
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,458
But it still makes
me laugh thinking of

206
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:21,041
him falling into the ocean.

207
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:24,375
He didn't fall into the ocean.
He jumped in without hesitation

208
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:28,000
to save the Lord Sage.
It was impressive really.

209
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:31,083
I see... So you were there
to witness the whole thing?

210
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:34,541
I envy you. I wish I
could have been there as well.

211
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:37,208
I would have liked
to have seen him drown.

212
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,708
I win.

213
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:43,916
I went out waiting for a pair,
so it's three limit hands.

214
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,916
Three... Limit hands!
Wait a minute, Lord Dragon.

215
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,958
Are you sure such
a hand even exists?

216
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:49,833
Yes.

217
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,458
You're... you're sure?

218
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:52,875
He would know.

219
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:55,750
Damn... I hate losing
to a little kid all the time.

220
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,000
It's just not fair.

221
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,333
Do you want to
play poker instead?

222
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:03,500
No, no it's fine. We don't have
to switch games on my account.

223
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,708
Now, let's go again.

224
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:08,000
We should invite
another player to join us.

225
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:09,958
Not purple boy, I hope.

226
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,125
Soon...

227
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:14,250
All of us... will play together.

228
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,083
Indeed, Sei.

229
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,583
Are you okay?

230
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:27,041
I've finally made it
into the Special Zone,

231
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,583
but there's no one
here to share it with.

232
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,791
I want to...

233
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:40,458
bury her in the earth
of the Special Zone.

234
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,291
Is Kotaro all right?

235
00:19:57,375 --> 00:20:00,958
Yes. By tomorrow, he'll
be brimming with energy.

236
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:06,541
I just can't believe
Chan's really gone.

237
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,833
I can't either.

238
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:13,666
Kotaro will never forget
her, though. I'm sure of it.

239
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,625
But he won't be
depressed forever.

240
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,125
He's really a tough
kid and he'll make it

241
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,500
through this hardship.

242
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,625
I'm sure you're probably right.

243
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,833
I guess that the
resonance... faded away.

244
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:30,083
What's that?

245
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,750
Oh nothing. I was
just talking to myself...

246
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,791
I was thinking you
guys could stay at my house,

247
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,958
at least for the night,
if that's all right with you.

248
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,708
How generous of you, Mimiko.

249
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,000
No problem.

250
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,625
But are you
sure it'll be okay

251
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,916
for a unmarried
woman to have guests?

252
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,916
Maybe not, but
don't remind me...

253
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,875
I'm kinda trying not to
let that bother me right now.

254
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:50,083
And on top of that,
you're a virgin.

255
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,666
It's really quite a rarity
in this day and age.

256
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,375
And I must say
that a virgin's blood

257
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,500
is a delicacy
to us vampires.

258
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:02,125
You pervert! Pervert!
Pervert! Pervert!

259
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,625
Just wait... I wasn't
trying to offend you!

260
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:07,916
I was merely... trying to convey
to you my vampire's appreciation

261
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,500
for virgin blood!
You're overre--

262
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:12,333
Just shut your mouth and
don't say another word to me!

263
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:15,000
Damn it! I wish I'd taken
Miss Wong's submachine gun

264
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,041
from her... But maybe...

265
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:20,250
Maybe I'll just throw you
into the ocean. Feed the fish.

266
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,083
Now listen... I absolutely
will not stand for

267
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,541
any more sexual harassment.

268
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,291
Sure... No more
sexual harassment.

269
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,583
Uh! Man, you piss me off!

270
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:41,583
Look, I'll give
you a place to sleep...

271
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,750
But it's gonna be on the floor. 

272
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:47,583
Tell me something, Mimiko.
Are these normal tactics that

273
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,750
compromisers use when
dealing with their clients?

274
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,166
You still talking?

275
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,750
One more word from you
and you're out on the street.

276
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:55,000
You don't have to
worry about me, Mimiko.

277
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:57,041
I promise to be
a perfect gentleman.

278
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:00,958
Oh, I'm not
worried about it, Jiro.

279
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:04,208
Because I'm sleeping
with a bucket of Holy water.

280
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:01,000
Yes, I have no doubt.

281
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:03,416
And I believe that every
other powerful group within

282
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,208
the Special Zone is currently
trying to determine how best to

283
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:08,041
deal with his arrival.

284
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:12,541
Or perhaps... their aim
is to put an end to him.

285
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:15,500
Episode five:
"The Special Economic Zone"
