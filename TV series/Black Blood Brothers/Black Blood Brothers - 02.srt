1
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,000
Amazing how quickly time passes.

2
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:43,875
It's been ten years since
you came here with Kotaro.

3
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:45,833
He was just a baby then.

4
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:48,333
This entire decade, I have
never forgotten the debt of

5
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:51,416
gratitude I owe
both you and the princess.

6
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,625
Truly, I owe you everything.

7
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:58,041
We have a few more years
before Kotaro emerges.

8
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:01,250
You two should stay here
until then. It makes more sense.

9
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:04,250
I'm sorry, Crow, but we've
been over this already.

10
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:08,375
Listen to me, Jiro. I'm worried
about you. Both of you.

11
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:11,541
Here the princess and I
can help you, but out there...

12
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:13,625
Well, out there's
a different story.

13
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:16,041
It's the destiny
of my bloodline.

14
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:19,458
If I wait until Kotaro
emerges, it will be too late.

15
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,583
I want him to know
the outside world before

16
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:23,291
it's out of reach for him.

17
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,083
His only thoughts
shouldn't be that of

18
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,916
unnatural things in
the darkness of night.

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,625
Wait up, Grand Duke Bow-wow!

20
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,291
Hi, princess...
What are you doing?!

21
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,541
That's for me?

22
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:52,583
Thanks, this is
really nice of you...

23
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,958
Did you knit the
whole thing yourself?

24
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,125
Don't bother...

25
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:02,500
This whole thing will get
covered in snow out here.

26
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,083
Please, your highness.
There's no need to be so sad...

27
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:12,875
When I'm in the Special Zone...
I'll write you all the time.

28
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:23,791
Thanks again for the scarf...
It means so much to me ...

29
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:27,250
And every time I wear it I'll
think of you, your highness.

30
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,000
I always knew you were
pretty amazing princess...

31
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,041
But I had no
idea you could knit...

32
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,166
Was it a hard
thing for you to do?

33
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,708
This is now my most
prized possession.

34
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:48,000
Uh... I'll just wipe
it off... See...?

35
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:02,416
Well, Crow... It looks like
Kotaro is up to no good again.

36
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,625
Oh, gimmie a break.

37
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,375
It must be nice to
be young and having fun.

38
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,916
I have next to zero
for my vacation time

39
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,333
and my salary
hardly makes it worth

40
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,208
my while in the first place.

41
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,500
That whole business
with the phone call

42
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,083
this morning
was a bunch of crap.

43
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,541
Calling a girl before dawn
and ordering her out of bed.

44
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,208
"Just get up, go down
the beach and investigate."

45
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,291
What the hell is that?

46
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,000
Is that it?!

47
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:53,833
What's that?

48
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:03,041
That's a... person.

49
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,916
Uh...

50
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,916
Go grab your phone...
We gotta call an ambulance!

51
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,041
Right!

52
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,375
Hey dude... You okay?

53
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,625
Can you stand?

54
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:42,125
Cut! Excellent guys,
Juuust great!

55
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:45,208
I've never seen
a performance like that!

56
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:49,541
Just masterful...
And the makeup! Wow...!

57
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,375
And let's see here.

58
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,291
Looks like you lived
to see another scene kid.

59
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:58,166
Now let's get you on to
the next set. Up and at 'em.

60
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,666
They've got crew and
extras ready and waiting.

61
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:05,625
You're a vampire right...?

62
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,166
I'm aware that
you don't know me...

63
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,000
But just trust me on this...
I came here to help you.

64
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,375
Anyplace out of the sun.

65
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,000
Leave it to me.

66
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:30,208
You kids and
your method acting. Ha!

67
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,541
What just happened?

68
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,333
I have no idea.

69
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,041
Have we gotten
any word from Johan?

70
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,583
Not yet.

71
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:51,583
Then our hands are tied... Just
stick to the plan for now...

72
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:54,666
The rest is in your
hands, Master Strategist.

73
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,083
It's what I do best, sis.

74
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,083
I can't do this anymore!

75
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,125
I'm finished.
I can hear it now.

76
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,250
For the rest of the summer
it'll be nothing but rumors

77
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,083
and stories about skeleton guy

78
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:37,375
and the crazy
giggling idiot lady!

79
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:41,375
I'll never be able to set foot
on that beautiful beach again.

80
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,708
I would like to thank
you for your assistance...

81
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:44,958
Without you we would've--

82
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:48,750
That's the biggest
load of crap-- I mean...

83
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,625
You have a name?

84
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:52,875
It's Jiro... Mochizuki.

85
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,458
Jiro's a pretty common name...

86
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,541
Should be an easy
one to remember.

87
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,416
Then please make
sure that you do.

88
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,125
I already have. So the
little one there next to you--

89
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,708
That's Kotaro, right?

90
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:03,750
As I said...

91
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,208
Our situation
happens to be grave

92
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:06,916
and is of no fault of our own.

93
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,583
To all appearances...
we have simply been caught up

94
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:12,750
in the chaos created by
your esteemed colleagues.

95
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:15,750
We brothers are
victims here. Nothing more.

96
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,333
Don't you think I know that...?

97
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,916
For ruining your voyage, as a
representative of the Company,

98
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,125
I would like to
offer our apologies...

99
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:24,750
We are very, very, very, sorry.

100
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:28,500
That's the biggest load
of crap... And you... are?

101
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:29,916
Mimiko Katsuragi!

102
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,458
Oh, yes, Mimiko...
What a very unusual name...

103
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:36,000
It's rather funny
sounding when you hear it.

104
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,916
Just do me a favor
and don't forget it...

105
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,250
You don't want to tick me off.

106
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:42,166
Oh, don't worry...
I remember it already.

107
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:49,125
Great, we agree...
Now, since I know that you

108
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,541
and the kid are traveling
to the Special Zone...

109
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,375
The least I can do
is offer you guidance.

110
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,458
I'll show you the way myself.
How does that sound?

111
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,333
Is it at that point
you'll hand my companion

112
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,791
and I over to
the suppression team?

113
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:01,541
Mr. Mochizuki.

114
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:02,750
Yes?

115
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,833
Let me take a moment
to make myself clear.

116
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,291
Okay, I'm listening.

117
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,208
While I'm part of
the same company as those

118
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,458
you met earlier,
I am a compromiser.

119
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:12,791
I act as more of a
mediator than anything..

120
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:16,125
In our line of work, the subject
always given top priority is

121
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,291
the continuing peaceful
co-existence between

122
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,958
Black Bloods like you
and the Red Bloods like us.

123
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,791
You call yourselves Red Bloods?

124
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,291
Oh right. You probably don't
know any of this, huh?

125
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:27,791
In order to be clear when we're
talking of our two races...

126
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:31,250
We call your kind Black Bloods
and we call our kind Red Bloods.

127
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:34,583
It shows equality between
two races of sentient beings...

128
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:37,208
that we're equal
as living creatures.

129
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,583
That's just two minutes
and seven seconds...

130
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,583
Yafuri, go ahead.

131
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:00,125
It's nothing personal pal.

132
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,250
How long are we
going to keep doing this.

133
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,333
Who knows? It's just one
of those things we have to do

134
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,916
in order to survive...

135
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,583
And remember if you
slack off, I'm telling sis.

136
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,583
Here... This is next.

137
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,125
Yeah, don't worry I'm on it.

138
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:15,791
Good boy.

139
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,791
Please, no!

140
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,875
So we've got red
bloods and black bloods...

141
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,750
Are we sure
there's nothing else?

142
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,291
Good morning, Kotaro.

143
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,375
Oh hey, brother! Good morning. 

144
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,458
How are you feeling today?

145
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:47,208
I feel kinda salty...
It's gross!

146
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,041
Looks like you
didn't fall apart though.

147
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,916
I remember now. I was
on the ship and then I--

148
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,083
You must have
jumped in and saved me!

149
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,583
I sure did.

150
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:59,666
Thank you brother. I always
knew I could count on you.

151
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:04,250
It figures... He's a lot
nicer to him than he is to me.

152
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,750
So brother...

153
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,000
Who's that... that girl?

154
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,083
Allow me to introduce myself...

155
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:13,833
My name is Mimiko Katsuragi...
It's nice to meet you.

156
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:16,583
Mimiko...
That name's kinda weird.

157
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:20,458
Yeah... It's different...
I get that a lot...

158
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,333
Now I know you feel
salty from the water...

159
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,000
But you can at least
get the taste out of

160
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,750
your mouth with a
few bites from this.

161
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:29,458
I can have this...?!
Are you serious?!

162
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,875
Thank you so much!

163
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,708
She's really nice, brother.

164
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,666
So, Mimi, what are you
doing here with us anyway?

165
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,291
Actually--

166
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,125
She's our guide.

167
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:46,000
It's her job to escort
us to the Special Zone.

168
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,958
We place
ourselves in your care.

169
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,666
She's really our guide?

170
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:56,166
It won't be a long trip,
but we'll have lots of fun.

171
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,000
Hey Mimi...

172
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,250
What's the matter?

173
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:25,583
Uh... Oh... I was just
noticing how different

174
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,375
you two are for being brothers.

175
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:30,166
We may look and act different,
but we're brothers for sure.

176
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,416
And outside of that
we've got no one.

177
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,500
We're the only
ones in our bloodline.

178
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:37,208
You shouldn't speak too
much of our family, Kotaro...

179
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,666
What my younger brother
here is saying is true...

180
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,333
We are brothers, but while
he can handle the sun...

181
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:43,833
and flowing water...

182
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:46,416
this obviously doesn't happen
to be the case with me...

183
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,333
And that's all there is to it...

184
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,666
I hope that's
satisfactory for you.

185
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,291
Sorry I noticed.

186
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:12,875
Awesome! Awesome! Awesome...!

187
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,166
This is so cool
brother...! Yes! Yes!

188
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,916
You can calm down now, Kotaro!

189
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,125
Okay! Right!

190
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,708
That's it!
That's the Special Zone!

191
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:26,500
It sure is. We just cross
that bridge and we're there.

192
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,875
Is something wrong?

193
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,083
How thoughtless of me.

194
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,250
What?

195
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:37,041
There's a barrier
surrounding the Zone.

196
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,583
Wait. What are
you talking about...?

197
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,750
They don't have
anything like that here.

198
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:43,750
It is a barrier that
cannot be felt by humans.

199
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:44,958
Most vampires would find that

200
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,416
they have no
reaction to it either.

201
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,083
The barrier serves
only one purpose.

202
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,666
And that is...?

203
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:55,291
To keep specific bloodlines from
entering without an invitation.

204
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:59,333
Yes... Ten years ago...
During the Kowloon Shock...

205
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:01,833
This method was developed
to establish defensive lines

206
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,250
and enclosed camps.

207
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,125
Wait a second, but...
That means--

208
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,833
It's not what you think...

209
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:09,416
Neither my brother nor
I are Kowloon Children.

210
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,250
Fine then. What are you?!

211
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:12,916
You may not see it...

212
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,916
but I am in fact descended from
a noble line of vampires...

213
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,333
and I always adhere
strictly to their traditions.

214
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:25,291
Kotaro...
Come over here please.

215
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,333
What?!

216
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:27,791
Come over here.

217
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:28,958
But Brother...

218
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,583
Just do it.

219
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,541
So what is it?

220
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:37,125
Mimiko's job as our
guide has come to an end.

221
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,708
Awe...

222
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:41,708
That was the arrangement from
the start. Now you know that.

223
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:46,375
Mimiko, I'd like to thank
you for your hospitality.

224
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,666
This young lady has
been nothing but good to us...

225
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:00,333
If you lay a hand on her, I
won't just stand by and watch.

226
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,000
I think you're aware I'm
not interested in the girl.

227
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,541
Our objective is you.

228
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:06,916
Huh?

229
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,791
Sorry for the trouble we
put you through last night.

230
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:13,666
Target has made contact.

231
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,208
Roger that.

232
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,083
My name is Kelly Wong...

233
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,333
and I need your help to
get into the Special Zone.

234
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:28,583
You see, unfortunately my
knowledge of which bloodline

235
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,666
I belong to is
minimal at best.

236
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,250
Shortly after I was transformed
my parents died in the

237
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:37,000
Kowloon Shock, taking with them
any information about my past.

238
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:39,250
One of the so-called
broken bloodlines...

239
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,375
So I take it you
were born in Hong Kong?

240
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:44,708
Basically... And I
overheard your conversation...

241
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,416
If you're parting ways
here with the company,

242
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,083
it works out for all of us...

243
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,458
I was hoping you would
join forces with us.

244
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:53,083
Join forces with you...?!
You're kidding me!

245
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,291
Well, aren't you clingy...

246
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:57,916
The man just said that
he was leaving you here

247
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,083
and you can't let go.

248
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,791
But I'm a compromiser...

249
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:04,125
I can't just abandon a job
before it's been completed.

250
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,125
Then you're invited
to come along too.

251
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,958
Well I don't, know, uh...

252
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:13,083
Hey, brother... You're pretty
popular, you know that?

253
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:15,625
Trust me, Kotaro,
that's not always a good thing.

254
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:19,458
But at the very least you can
write to Crow and brag about it.

255
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:22,916
Now if I did that he'd never
let me hear the end of it.

256
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,750
You've been listening,
so I assume you know...

257
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:34,250
I'm, to my regret,
suspected of being one of

258
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,250
the Kowloon Children you see.

259
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,500
And to invite one of that
bloodline into your group--

260
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,750
It doesn't matter what
bloodline you belong to.

261
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:44,333
We'll accept you... Even
if you are a Kowloon Child.

262
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:46,500
Let me make myself clear,
what I did last night was

263
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:48,083
not meant to benefit you.

264
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,666
I understand.

265
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:53,000
You reacted logically based on
your knowledge of the situation.

266
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,791
What we need from
you is your power...

267
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,500
And in exchange we
can provide you with

268
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,791
something that you
need but don't have.

269
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,750
Just what
exactly would that be?

270
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,666
Friendship of course.

271
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:13,375
A whole bunch of new friends...
What do you think?

272
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:16,041
Should we join up with that
lady and her group of people?

273
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,458
There's a young girl
traveling in our group that's

274
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,291
about the same
age as you are...

275
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:30,000
I'm sure the two of
you will be good friends.

276
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,083
Uh... But I...

277
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:39,208
It's settled... Now then...
Let's get out of here.

278
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,500
The first thing we'll do
is meet up with the others and--

279
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,083
Wong, wait a minute.

280
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,500
I wasn't sure at first, but...

281
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,666
I think this guy
is the kin-killer.

282
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,791
Is that true?

283
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:55,166
Fantastic...! I heard every
story there was about you

284
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,833
when I was a mercenary!

285
00:17:56,916 --> 00:18:00,416
I couldn't imagine a
better ally...! This is great!

286
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,208
Get Down!

287
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,958
Wong!

288
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:16,916
Are you okay?

289
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,541
Silver!

290
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:32,708
I never thought
they go so far as to

291
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,458
attack us in broad daylight...

292
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:37,458
It looks like The Company
is feeling rather bold.

293
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,208
Wait...! I didn't do this!

294
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,833
Don't worry. I know.

295
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,208
I may not look it but
I'm a hundred years old...

296
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,875
I've learned a
lot along the way.

297
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:51,416
A hundred... years old...? That
makes you an Old Blood right?

298
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:10,041
To be honest, I knew they'd
try to make this kind of move.

299
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,375
They really had no choice but to

300
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,833
set up an ambush
somewhere along the way.

301
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:15,583
I figured it would
be easier to negotiate

302
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:18,125
with you around
rather than not.

303
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:20,750
Kotaro!

304
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,291
What is it?

305
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:24,625
Listen Carefully... because
I had to save you in the ocean,

306
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,500
I've drained all of my energy...

307
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,958
so I'm too weak to break
down their lines and carry you.

308
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:33,166
I'm going to play decoy and
try to draw them away from you.

309
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,125
Which means that you'll have
to get past them on your own.

310
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,125
Do you think you can do that?

311
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,625
I don't know...
I guess I can try.

312
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,250
I'll go with him!

313
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,625
But Mimiko...

314
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,083
I appreciate the offer.

315
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,958
But I'd prefer not to
rely on your sympathy.

316
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:55,541
That wasn't
exactly why I offered.

317
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:58,333
At any rate, we'll be on
our way here very shortly.

318
00:19:58,416 --> 00:19:59,791
You can explain
this situation to

319
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,625
the suppression
team when they arrive.

320
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:06,500
Aw... You mean we're gonna have
to say goodbye to Mimi anyway?

321
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,958
Yes, now let it go! You
have to get out of here.

322
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,041
If you don't escape
soon, they'll catch you.

323
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,541
All right! I'm going!

324
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,791
Kotaro?

325
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,333
What is it now, brother?

326
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,875
You take care of
yourself out there.

327
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,333
You got it! See you later!

328
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:36,875
Is this the right move...?
I don't know.

329
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:55,958
Is the Japanese sunlight
really this powerful?

330
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:03,875
Move it!

331
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,958
Damn!

332
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,083
Over there!

333
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,041
What an idiot.

334
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,250
Under normal circumstances,

335
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:03,041
humans will not turn unless we
drink the blood of a Vampire.

336
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:06,291
But the Kowloon can turn humans
just by sucking their blood.

337
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:09,083
They can even convert other
Vampires to their bloodline.

338
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:11,250
If we allow them
to exist unchecked,

339
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:13,583
it could spell disaster.

340
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:16,500
