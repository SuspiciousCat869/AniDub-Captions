1
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:42,875
Thank goodness. I was worried
that you might get hurt.

2
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:45,208
No, I'm fine.
And I'm glad to see

3
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:46,458
that you're unharmed as well.

4
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:47,833
Oh, where are my manners?

5
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:50,791
Allow me to properly
introduce myself. My name is--

6
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:52,500
Alice, I know.

7
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:57,541
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Jiro Mochizuki.

8
00:01:57,625 --> 00:02:00,791
I'm a Sub-Lieutenant
Second Class in the Navy.

9
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:03,791
You--

10
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:05,000
What?

11
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,333
You just read my mind,
didn't you? But how?

12
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:09,791
How can that happen when I
haven't even drank from you?

13
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:11,833
No, stop it! Cut it out!

14
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:14,833
Will you please just
get out of my head already?

15
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:16,166
What are you talking about?

16
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,833
I've never read
anyone's mind before,

17
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:19,458
and I know I'm
not reading yours now.

18
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:22,583
But you! You knew my name
before I even told it to you.

19
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,458
I just happened to overhear it.

20
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:26,291
A woman named
Cassa called you that.

21
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,583
Wait, did you say Cassa?

22
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:31,666
That's right. I thought
that you might know her.

23
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,375
The infamous
Cassandra Jill Warlock.

24
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:43,375
No, I'm afraid I've
never heard the name before.

25
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:45,375
You're lying to me.

26
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:46,875
I'm telling the truth.

27
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,541
I don't believe you.

28
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:51,875
I-I swear that
I don't know her.

29
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:54,708
You know, deception really
isn't your strong suit.

30
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,166
Why do you
insist on doubting me?

31
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:01,083
I just wanted to make sure
that you knew. Cassadra is...

32
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,541
a vampire.

33
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:08,750
I don't know.

34
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:11,458
Uh, Miss Alice. What's wrong?

35
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:23,208
It seems like a lot's been
happening in the Special Zone.

36
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:26,291
I want to help out
and repay my debt to you.

37
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,666
What's wrong?

38
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,333
Hey, why won't you answer me?

39
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:32,708
Mimiko?

40
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,416
What's going on?

41
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,083
But how?

42
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:57,291
It's a simple trick really. Eye
Raid, plus a little ingenuity.

43
00:03:57,375 --> 00:04:00,500
Who are you?
What do you want with me?

44
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:04,666
Come on, Mimiko. There's no
need for you to be so afraid.

45
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,416
It's just me.

46
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,333
I spent the entire
day with you, remember?

47
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:14,208
Cassa.

48
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,583
Well, now! You know my name?

49
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:20,041
I drug you around without
showing you my true identity.

50
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:23,833
And now you've gone
and beaten me to the punch.

51
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,666
Sorry for deceiving you.

52
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,416
I assume that you
heard of me from Jiro.

53
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,916
Knowing him he's done
nothing but badmouth me.

54
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Always holding a grudge.

55
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:37,958
You wouldn't think it, but he
can be so sensitive sometimes.

56
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:43,916
Anyway. Welcome, Mimiko
to my secret hideout.

57
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,500
Did you not realize that?

58
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,500
This is my
family's safe house.

59
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:50,958
It's our refuge
in the Special Zone.

60
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,333
Allow me to introduce
you to my little brother.

61
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,208
He's not very
energetic right now,

62
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,791
but don't let that bother you.

63
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:59,541
He's just away for a bit.

64
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,125
Away?

65
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:04,916
He really is an odd one. And he
won't be waking up anytime soon.

66
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,708
Here, you can doodle
on him all you want.

67
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,625
It's permanent, of course.

68
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,750
What do you want with Jiro?

69
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:15,291
That's why you came to
me, right? To get to him?

70
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,541
My, you're a perceptive one.

71
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,583
What do I want with Jiro?

72
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:22,166
I wouldn't really say that
I want something from him.

73
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,708
I'd just like to see him again.

74
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,875
It's been over
ten years, you know?

75
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,333
As you so aptly observed,

76
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,333
I'm holding you
captive because I've planned

77
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,625
an elaborate scheme
to get under his skin.

78
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,416
Imagining the look
of rage on his face

79
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,333
brings me great pleasure.

80
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:36,666
Of course...

81
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,625
That's not the only
business I have here today.

82
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:49,375
Why doesn't anyone around
here answer their phones?

83
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,541
Alright, what's
going on here, Hibari?

84
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,583
The lines have been overloaded
all day long with calls

85
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:56,000
about the Kowloon Children.

86
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,583
But never mind that!

87
00:05:57,666 --> 00:06:00,916
Miss Mimiko went to the Eleventh
Yard to search for the Silver--

88
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Huh?

89
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:05,583
Now hold on a second.

90
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,708
What do you know
about the Eleventh Yard?

91
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,750
Eleventh Yard?
What's going on?

92
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:21,708
What's so special
about the Eleventh Yard?

93
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:25,583
Oh, now that is
a good question.

94
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:28,708
But, unfortunately, I'm afraid I
can't trust you with the answer.

95
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,041
And as we all know,

96
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,875
a good question is
meaningless without an answer.

97
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:34,583
It's just you and me.

98
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:37,291
We spent the entire
day together, remember?

99
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:46,333
Ah, yes. That is what I said.

100
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,333
You know, you do
delight me, Mimiko.

101
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:51,000
Given different circumstances,
I think we could be friends.

102
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,625
Mind if I charm
you once and for all?

103
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,125
Please don't.

104
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,250
All right, then how about this?

105
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:02,250
I'll tell you everything I know.
Even about the Eleventh Yard.

106
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,291
And in exchange...

107
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,500
A kiss is all I ask for.

108
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,833
You're going to turn
me into one of your kind?

109
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,458
Yup.

110
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,833
And then you'll kill me?

111
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:21,250
I must admit that I
find myself liking you.

112
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,500
Even after what you
went through yesterday.

113
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,458
You were still
determined to find Jiro

114
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,791
and help him. Amazing, really.

115
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,541
You're a human who will
do anything for vampires once

116
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,083
you've set your mind to it.

117
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:35,166
And with utter selflessness
and with no ulterior motives.

118
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,958
You're able to see the
good even in us vampires.

119
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,625
You've made all these
sacrifices for Jiro,

120
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:44,166
but for one hundred
years, he's survived by

121
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,083
drinking the blood of humans.

122
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:49,708
But you. You don't
see him that way, do you?

123
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:02,500
I can still smell
Jiro on your neck.

124
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:05,375
You let him drink
from you, didn't you?

125
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,375
Do you love Jiro?

126
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:10,541
No! Kotaro had
been kidnapped, and I--

127
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,333
Forget it.

128
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,500
You should know.
You don't stand a chance.

129
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:20,458
Jiro's taken. Every last drop of
his blood belongs to Alice Eve.

130
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,583
Alice? The Sage?

131
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:25,291
She seems so innocent,
but she's always been

132
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,541
an exceedingly
greedy Black Blood.

133
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,083
The fact that she's
unaware of it herself

134
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,250
makes it all
the more difficult.

135
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:37,500
Oh great. Looks
like we have company.

136
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,333
If you touch her,
you'll regret it!

137
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,583
No! Kotaro, stay away!

138
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,458
He'll be fine.

139
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,166
He was put under
a hypnotic suggestion.

140
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,416
You're the Silver
Blade, aren't you?

141
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,958
Yes I am.

142
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,375
Why did you leave Miss Mimiko
behind to fend for herself?

143
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:13,041
Well, I was
trying to protect her.

144
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,625
She's out there
in all that chaos

145
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,833
looking for you
right now, you know?!

146
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,166
She's looking for me?

147
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,791
And all this time while
she's trying to help you,

148
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,708
you've been running away
from the Kowloon Children.

149
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:23,708
How selfish and
cowardly is that?

150
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:26,791
I just thought it would be
best not to involve her in

151
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,291
this senseless conflict,

152
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:31,750
but evidently my
plan has backfired on me.

153
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:35,500
I've made a grave mistake,
and I am truly sorry for it.

154
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:38,541
The truth is, my younger brother
has gone looking for Mimiko,

155
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,958
and I must find
him immediately.

156
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:43,916
He's the only
family I have left.

157
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,333
So please, can you
tell me where Mimiko is?

158
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:50,416
I'm truly sorry to say this,
but the reason I want to

159
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,166
find her is to ensure that

160
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,458
my younger brother
returns to me safely.

161
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,416
And until that happens
getting him back is

162
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,916
my one and only concern.

163
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,958
I know I shouldn't
have left Mimiko,

164
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:04,541
and so I'm ashamed to ask, but
please, tell me where she is.

165
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:08,541
I need-- I need
to find my brother.

166
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,208
Why did you tell
me all that stuff?

167
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,083
What?

168
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,833
You could've just lied to me.

169
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,375
You didn't have to
mention your brother.

170
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,250
You could have told me
that you wanted to find her

171
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,333
so that you could
apologize to her.

172
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:24,750
Oh. Actually, now
that you mention it,

173
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,083
I do owe her an apology.

174
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,250
Okay, I guess this
Silver Blade guy isn't

175
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,458
so bad for
Miss Mimiko after all.

176
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:36,666
Huh?

177
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,916
Uh, nothing. I guess
I don't have a choice.

178
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,875
I'll gladly tell you where
you can find Miss Mimiko.

179
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,708
I can't thank you enough.

180
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:48,375
Get away from Mimi!

181
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:52,875
You're going to ruin
everything. Now get outta here!

182
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,458
I put a lot of
time and effort into

183
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,541
planning all of
this out to perfection.

184
00:10:56,625 --> 00:11:00,208
And it's just like you to come
in and screw up everything!

185
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,500
Oh, wow!

186
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,833
What the--?! What
are you doing here?

187
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:20,375
Damn!

188
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:42,416
It's a pleasure to make your
acquaintance, Zelman Clock.

189
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,625
Ancient hunter of darkness,
child of the Fire God,

190
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,000
the Crimson-Eyed Butcher,

191
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:50,666
and descendant of
Warrior Asura's bloodline.

192
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,791
As you know, my name
is Cassandra Jill Warlock.

193
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,958
And with all due respect, I must
express my reverence to you,

194
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,500
the successor of the fire
from the age of the gods.

195
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:02,708
But I must also say
damn you for interfering.

196
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,833
What are you, the
famed member of Darkness,

197
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:07,416
the wielder of the spiral
flames, doing with the Sage?

198
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,833
Silence, Black Snake.

199
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:11,083
How dare you bring
your abominable curse here

200
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,791
to tarnish my home?

201
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,958
Your kind disgusts me.

202
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,416
And just how
many of your own kin

203
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,125
have you bastards
killed in cold blood?

204
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,375
I can hardly believe that

205
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,750
the Crimson-Eyed Zelman
is saying such things.

206
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,625
Being as weak and
friendless as we are,

207
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:31,416
we're willing to use whatever
means necessary to survive.

208
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,000
That's amazing!

209
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,416
She's a fast one.

210
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,708
It's even more
powerful than I had heard.

211
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,500
Your Eye Ignite attack.
And as expected,

212
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,791
I am truly no
match for your powers.

213
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:58,458
I grow tired of this.
Kotaro. Compromiser.

214
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,916
Get down on
your knees and pray!

215
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:28,541
Well, it looks like our fight
will have to wait till later.

216
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:31,500
You don't really think
you can escape me, do you?

217
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,833
I met the members
of the Coven today.

218
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,125
What's that?

219
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:38,541
It really is a shame
that they're so trusting.

220
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,291
You bitch!

221
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:45,375
I'll be taking my leave,
Crimson-Eyed Zelman.

222
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:48,958
Farewell, Mimiko. And you...

223
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,958
Kotaro Mochizuki.

224
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,208
Thank you so much for
all of your help, Mr. Zelman.

225
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,791
That was a really close call.

226
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,625
This is far from over.
Don't thank me yet.

227
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,208
It's in the blood.

228
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:12,958
It can't be! Are
there more out there?

229
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:20,208
So, what do you think? Will
you be alright on your own?

230
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:23,750
Yeah! And thank you
so much for all your help.

231
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:30,583
It's funny. When I'm with you,
I feel different somehow.

232
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,208
Let's have ramen
together again sometime.

233
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,375
'Kay!

234
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,458
Hey, Mimi?

235
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:41,625
What's wrong?
Why won't you answer?

236
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,666
Cassa!

237
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:54,875
You betrayed us. But still, you
guarded her ashes all that time.

238
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:56,750
Why?

239
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,375
What's going on, sis?

240
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:19,333
It's nothing. Get things
started. Immediately.

241
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:38,291
A Kowloon infestation has broken
out at Tsukimiya Hospital.

242
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,500
The patients showing
symptoms are the vampires that

243
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,791
the suppression team
rescued from the docks.

244
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,041
What?

245
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:45,458
The losses here at
the hospital are enormous.

246
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:48,458
And secondary contagion
cases are already appearing!

247
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,541
We need the suppression
team there immediately.

248
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,000
Where is Chief Zhang now?

249
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,416
We're not sure.

250
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,541
Find him and have him sent
to me as soon as possible.

251
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:56,666
Yes sir.

252
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,708
How did this happen?

253
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,083
I'm in the fourth
yard right now,

254
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:04,250
and I've discovered an
illegal inventory of blood.

255
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,583
That's it!

256
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,583
Put out an order right away.

257
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,208
Prohibit all
vampires in the city from

258
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,791
feeding from blood packs.

259
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,208
Make it a top priority.

260
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,625
Yes, sir!

261
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,541
Inform Chief Zhang
of the situation.

262
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,708
That there are tainted blood
packs out there on the market

263
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:21,041
and they could infect
the entire population.

264
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,708
He needs to find those
blood packs and destroy them.

265
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,000
Yes sir!

266
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,875
You may enter.

267
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,083
Pardon me.

268
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:41,125
Mister Sei, I apologize for
interrupting your meditation,

269
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,750
but Chief Jinnai asks that
you come to the control room.

270
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:44,666
It's very urgent.

271
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,625
I know who you are.

272
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:49,250
It's you isn't it. Walkerman.

273
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:53,333
They used to call you man-walker
for your unique abilities.

274
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,791
I am called Zaza now.

275
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:59,458
Dragon King Sei,
Wise Man of the East,

276
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,541
young one of the Four Gods.

277
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:04,791
Sovreign ruler of the night of
Hong Kong and the Special Zone,

278
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,250
and divine protector
of red and black blood,

279
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:10,208
direct descendant of
the True Source Chaos.

280
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,625
Please forgive me for gaining
an audience with you by

281
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:16,041
means of this simple trick, but
it is important that I see you.

282
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:18,833
And I'm honored to be
in your presence once again.

283
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,833
So you are the insider.

284
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,375
Yes. And it wasn't easy.

285
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,041
Dragon King, I assume
that you know why

286
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,250
we have come here
to the Special Zone.

287
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:28,583
Just as I loved Hong Kong,

288
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:31,500
I now love this city
with the same intensity.

289
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,166
So if you would kindly
hand over what we're here for.

290
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,916
We'll gladly leave quietly--

291
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,000
Silence!

292
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,416
You presume to claim
such a thing as love?!

293
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,791
Have you forgotten what your
bloodline did to Hong Kong?!

294
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:51,000
How-- How about
we strike a deal?

295
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,041
I'm listening.

296
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:58,291
I've adjusted the concentrations
in the blood we've scattered

297
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:02,250
across the city so the
victims will turn in waves.

298
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:03,791
And if our
bloodline spreads itself

299
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,333
throughout the Special Zone,

300
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:07,666
the entire world will
again be consumed by

301
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:11,083
a devastating vampire
hunt just like Hong Kong.

302
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:14,541
Dragon King. Where
is the Eleventh Yard?

303
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,541
If you tell me, I'll
reveal the locations of

304
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,625
all the contaminated
blood packs.

305
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,958
And you may be able
to avoid this disaster.

306
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:24,541
I would never strike a
deal with a Kowloon Child.

307
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:28,000
You would be willing to
sacrifice the Special Zone?

308
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:31,916
The Special Zone will
not bow to you. Now leave!

309
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,500
Then I shall appeal directly
to Your Majesty's benevolence.

310
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:41,208
Earlier today... I hid
a bomb in the building.

311
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:44,500
How many hundreds of

312
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:47,000
your innocent subordinates
will die, I wonder?

313
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,833
You bastard.

314
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:55,000
Damn it! What's the
suppression team doing?

315
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,750
I can't even begin to imagine
what the total damages will be.

316
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:58,833
The very existence of

317
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,625
the Special Zone
is in serious danger.

318
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:04,000
The Company is here precisely
to deal with these situations.

319
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,708
It's too late! No
matter how hard we try,

320
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,708
we can't cover this up.

321
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:13,083
The fact is the Special
Zone is a den of vampires!

322
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,625
If that gets out,
it'll all be over!

323
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,833
The Special Zone
will cease to exist.

324
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,500
We'll just have
to do all we can to

325
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,166
keep hiding it
from the people.

326
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,500
By whatever means necessary.

327
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,166
But Chairman...

328
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,708
I do sympathize
with how you feel.

329
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,541
And I still remember
the beginning of it all

330
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,166
like it happened yesterday.

331
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,791
How you arrived with the leaders
of the large corporations,

332
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:36,583
returning triumphantly
to the Special Zone.

333
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:39,916
And it's because of you
that the Special Zone exists.

334
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,458
This city used to be
damn near uninhabitable.

335
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:45,958
And you're the one who's
made it as great as it is today!

336
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:48,375
But it's all over!

337
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:49,750
You have to get out now,

338
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,500
so you can go on to
create the next Special Zone!

339
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:53,500
You must!

340
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:57,041
Please, Chairman.
We beg of you!

341
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,291
I understand that you're
concerned with my safety.

342
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:03,250
And I thank you. But please...

343
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,375
Shut-up!

344
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,083
I'm sorry. It's just that we--

345
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:09,291
No! I've had enough
of your disrespect.

346
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,666
You want me to get out?!

347
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,208
Have you forgotten who
it is you're talking to?

348
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,666
I'm still the
Chairman of this Company.

349
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:19,750
And I will never run away and
leave the organization behind.

350
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:23,291
You listen to me good.
I was born here, raised here.

351
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:26,958
This is where I belong.
And this is where I'll die.

352
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:29,000
If the Special
Zone is going down,

353
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,791
I will gladly go down with it.

354
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:33,291
And nothing
will change my mind.

355
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:37,375
I don't give a
damn how you do it.

356
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:38,958
But put all our resources into

357
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:41,166
damage control and
cover this thing up!

358
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,666
You men have kept the
Special Zone together

359
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:46,000
these past ten years!
Demonstrate your strength!

360
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:49,000
We have to do this.
Our honor is at stake!

361
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:52,916
Yes, chairman.
We'll do it for you!

362
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,625
I'm waiting for a response.

363
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:04,958
Dragon King...

364
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,791
Zhang, this man is--

365
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:22,541
He allowed himself to be
possessed by someone working for

366
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:25,250
the Kowloon Children.
As a member of the Company,

367
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,875
he should have been prepared
for something like this.

368
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:32,625
It's you, Zhang Leikao.
You're the Pile Killer.

369
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:36,541
So you've heard of me before.
That's always a nice feeling.

370
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,291
What's wrong? Hey.

371
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,708
It's nothing!

372
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,875
Ugh, this is awful.

373
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:08,208
Hey, are you okay?

374
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:14,625
It's just me, Yafuri.

375
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,333
Brother...

376
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:18,583
Here. Once you
finish drinking that

377
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:20,833
we'll be meeting
up with sis again.

378
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:04,041
This sure is a
great city, huh?

379
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:07,291
I see why you like
living here so much, Mimi.

380
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:10,208
Everyone's trying
so hard to save it.

381
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:15,458
