1
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:03,291
You shouldn't have interfered.

2
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,833
Alice, are you hurt?

3
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:27,666
Alice.

4
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,958
I know that this isn't fair.

5
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:34,000
Alice.

6
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:37,958
Normally, we have the person
make the choice for himselves.

7
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,125
We explain
everything to them,

8
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:43,416
and make sure that
they properly understand,

9
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,208
and then having done that, we
give them the right to choose.

10
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,541
We don't force it on them.
They have to accept it first.

11
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:52,750
But this time
we couldn't do that.

12
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:57,250
There wasn't enough time
and besides... Besides...

13
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:01,541
No matter how hard I tried, I
just couldn't hold myself back.

14
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:14,541
I'm sorry, Jiro. I'm so sorry.

15
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:18,000
Forgive me for
falling in love with you.

16
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,666
Jiro?

17
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,541
Alice, I--

18
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,125
What is it?

19
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:20,833
It hurts, so much.

20
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,833
It hurts, Alice.

21
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:31,000
What's happening to me?

22
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:28,791
What's the situation?

23
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,375
At last count there were
thirty-two confirmed cases

24
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:31,750
of infection in the city!

25
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,833
Where has it hit the
hardest? What location?

26
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,333
Tsukimiya Hospital, sir.

27
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:38,666
Damn it! If only we'd
realized it at the dock.

28
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,958
There are
confirmed sightings of

29
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,791
Kowloon Children
in the Third Yard!

30
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,708
A compromiser has
just been injured!

31
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:45,708
There's an unknown
number of infected!

32
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,583
A death in the Ninth Yard!

33
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,750
We have witnesses!
People are panicking!

34
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,166
The prisoner in the
basement has just escaped!

35
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,541
What?!

36
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,333
Footage incoming!

37
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,250
Damn that boy!

38
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,750
What is this?

39
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:21,208
He infiltrated the Company,
but he's been dealt with.

40
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,541
Did you hear of the outbreak?

41
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:25,416
Yes, unfortunately.
It seems their plan to

42
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,833
distribute the tainted
blood has been a success.

43
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:30,333
We have no other choice but
for you to take the field in

44
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,916
opposition to the
Kowloon Children, Sei.

45
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,291
Otherwise, the
Special Zone will fall.

46
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:39,833
You can't mean that?

47
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:42,625
I'm afraid so, which means,
we must temporarily raise the

48
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:46,333
seal which now
protects the Special Zone.

49
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,958
I leave this place to you.

50
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:14,000
Quiet the confusion
among the people.

51
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,791
It can't be.

52
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:25,833
Cain.

53
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,041
Lord Dragon!

54
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,500
I must end this plague
of Kowloon Children.

55
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:33,250
Go after Cassa and
Walkerman for me, understand?

56
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,583
Did you say Walkerman?!

57
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,666
Then, the one who freed
Yafuri must have been--

58
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,000
It was him.

59
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,000
Allow them to escape,
and they will be the

60
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:43,208
seed of future trouble.
Stamp them out now!

61
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,333
We'll move heaven
and earth to do so.

62
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,333
Listen closely.

63
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,416
The Dragon King of the
East himself has gone to

64
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,333
return peace to
the Special Zone!

65
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,000
As of now, you are
to pour all your

66
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,291
efforts into
regulating information!

67
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,541
I will take
the offensive as well!

68
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,166
What?

69
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:17,541
That's... the Dragon
King of the East.

70
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:22,416
Hah! In the end, he's a Black
Blood, same as the rest of us.

71
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,583
That's the spirit.

72
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,083
How do you like
the boat, Yafuri?

73
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,750
Bro, it's you!

74
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,208
Where's sis at?

75
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:42,458
She hasn't come yet.

76
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:44,541
The Dragon King's
on the move tonight.

77
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:47,375
And I'm afraid we're
quickly running out of time.

78
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,875
Yafuri. Incoming!

79
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,125
It's Cain!

80
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,333
I know!

81
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,416
Come on, now. You're gonna
have to do better than that.

82
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,041
You want us
to get caught again?

83
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,625
Just shut up! I'll handle this!

84
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:18,708
Time to show 'em what
you're made of, Yafuri!

85
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,791
Now return to the Darkness!

86
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,083
Thank you.
You really saved us.

87
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:09,458
My work is finished here.
I'll leave the rest to you.

88
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,625
Stop it! What the
hell are you doing?

89
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:27,958
I'm so sorry. I can't
help myself anymore.

90
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,750
Really...

91
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:56,291
They're such a pain in the ass.

92
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,583
Are you sure you're
all right, Mimiko?

93
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:23,250
I wasn't able to do
anything. I'm worthless.

94
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,208
No, don't say that.

95
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,250
What's wrong?

96
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,500
It's Sei!

97
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:33,958
What?

98
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,958
Wow!

99
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:40,000
Cain is with him, too.

100
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,625
And so is Zelman.

101
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,416
You can tell?

102
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,875
Yeah, I'm not sure why. It's
like I can sense them somehow.

103
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,916
This sure is a great city, huh?

104
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,250
I see why you like
living here so much, Mimi.

105
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:53,833
Huh?

106
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,541
Everyone's trying
so hard to save it.

107
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,166
They're giving
everything they've got

108
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,083
in order to help
the city live on.

109
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,375
It must be a wonderful city
if everyone is willing to

110
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:08,125
lay down their
lives to protect it.

111
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,958
That's why you wanted us
to live here, too, isn't it?

112
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,000
Mimi, I want to thank you.

113
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,875
You invited us to live
in a really great place.

114
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:25,250
We're lucky to have you.

115
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:31,708
So, can I ask a
favor of you, Mimi?

116
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:32,750
What is it?

117
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:35,000
It's about my brother.

118
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:39,333
Will you try talking to
him one more time for me?

119
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,583
Yeah. But he won't listen.

120
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:47,125
Well, I know that my brother can
be really stubborn sometimes,

121
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,083
but I'm asking you
anyway, because I believe

122
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,541
deep in my heart that you
might be the only person who

123
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,541
can convince him
to save this city.

124
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:54,958
You think so?

125
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:57,583
I want to live here in the
Special Zone for a while.

126
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:00,708
After all, that's why we
came here in the first place.

127
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,166
Oh really, I
always meant to ask,

128
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,291
but surely
there's more to it.

129
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,208
No, that's it.

130
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,250
You're hiding
something aren't you?

131
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,958
Please Kotaro,
if there's another reason

132
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:15,250
why you guys are
here, I need to know.

133
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:18,291
Okay? Just tell me.

134
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,208
Don't tell brother, okay?

135
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:24,833
I won't.

136
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,916
He brought me here so that
I could make some new friends.

137
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,666
Just to make friends?

138
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,500
Yeah. I've been in
the sanctuary all my life.

139
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,500
And Grand Duke Bowwow
was my only friend

140
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,083
when I was living in there.

141
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,916
I guess it's because
everyone else who lived there

142
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,291
was so much older than me.

143
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,083
Oh, I see.

144
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,750
Brother was afraid I
couldn't be happy there,

145
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,458
so he decided that we should
leave for the outside world.

146
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:48,625
He said that I had a lot to

147
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,500
learn about things
outside the Sanctuary,

148
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:53,916
and that I'd make human and
vampire friends along the way.

149
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,833
So I guess you're
my first friend, Mimi.

150
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:59,291
You consider us
friends, don't you?

151
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,000
Yeah, I consider
you a friend.

152
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,916
Alright. No promises.

153
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,958
But I'll talk to him,
and we'll see what happens.

154
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:25,958
Where have you been?
I thought I'd lost you.

155
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:29,958
Kotaro, honestly,
sometimes you are just so--

156
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,875
Brother.

157
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,791
Are you okay?

158
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,666
What about Cassa?
The black-haired woman.

159
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,416
Did she do
anything to hurt you?

160
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,750
She didn't even touch me.
Mister Zelman scared her away.

161
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,916
Zelman did?

162
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,541
That's good.
I'm just so grateful to

163
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,166
see that you're alright.

164
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,125
I'm sorry if I
scared you brother.

165
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,666
I wanted to see Mimi again.

166
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,875
I know. It's my fault for

167
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:58,250
not taking your
feelings into consideration.

168
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:01,166
But please, don't ever
run off on me like that again.

169
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,125
Promise me that
you won't, Kotaro.

170
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:09,583
I won't. 'Kay,
I promise. I'm so sorry.

171
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:15,958
It's good to see you, Jiro.

172
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:20,583
Mimiko, listen. I'm sorry
for trying to leave,

173
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:23,250
but it was for your own good.
I'm afraid if you continue to

174
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:26,250
associate with us, it'll only
cause you more suffering.

175
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,666
Especially now that
Cassa is in the Special Zone.

176
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,000
There's no telling
what she might do.

177
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,041
What? What's the matter?

178
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,583
She sure was a strange person.

179
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:39,333
She's very dangerous
and can't be trusted, but under

180
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,166
different circumstances,
I'd like to talk to her more.

181
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:47,083
Mimiko! She's known as Cassa
the Black Snake for a reason.

182
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,166
Just stay far away from her!

183
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:54,291
I noticed she was very
interested in you, by the way.

184
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:58,166
I'm sure she was. Before
she became a Kowloon Child,

185
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,458
she was very close
to the Sage and me.

186
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:03,166
Makes sense.

187
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,250
Well, then why was she
so interested in Kotaro?

188
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:11,333
That damn snake. Why can't she
just leave the two of us alone?

189
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:14,833
She didn't seem particularly
hateful or resentful.

190
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:17,666
Maybe she's
not out to get you.

191
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:20,708
I don't know what Cassa's

192
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:23,083
true intentions
are with Kotaro and me.

193
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,500
And I haven't
for quite some time.

194
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:29,375
In Hong Kong, she betrayed
me in the vilest way imaginable.

195
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,750
But she saved Kotaro.

196
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:35,666
Wait, she saved Kotaro?

197
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:48,500
Can't this thing go any faster?
He's catching up with us.

198
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,708
She's maxed out at top speed.

199
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,291
Damn!

200
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:02,208
Glad to see you!

201
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,000
It's a good thing she's here.

202
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,000
Lady Cassa.

203
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:15,833
The fight has only just
begun. Let's take it easy.

204
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,875
Jiro, you're making a mistake.

205
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,375
What?

206
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:30,375
Running away is a mistake.
Having met her, I understand.

207
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:33,750
If you run, Cassa will
pursue you wherever you go.

208
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,125
That's the kind
of person she is.

209
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,458
Surely by now, you know that.

210
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,333
Please Jiro. You and Kotaro can

211
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,375
live with me here
in the Special Zone.

212
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,750
I'm afraid that I've
already made up my mind.

213
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,791
And I'm telling you, I
think leaving is a mistake.

214
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,541
You'll just never
understand, will you?

215
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,500
The world doesn't work
the way you think it does.

216
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:55,208
Not everything is
so easy and simple.

217
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,083
Oh is that right?

218
00:18:57,166 --> 00:19:00,041
What exactly were you
doing all day today, Jiro?

219
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,250
'Cause you sure
weren't there to

220
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,791
help Kotaro when he
was in danger earlier.

221
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,625
Zelman saved him.

222
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:11,625
Hey, Mimi, listen.
When I asked for your help,

223
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:14,041
this isn't exactly
what I had in mind.

224
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,375
You're wasting your time
trying to provoke me like this.

225
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:17,958
Protector, my ass.

226
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:20,458
You try to do everything
yourself, and by doing so,

227
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:23,416
you're putting Kotaro
in danger, for no reason.

228
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,500
In the end, you're only
looking out for yourself.

229
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,250
How dare you
talk to me that way!

230
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,875
You're just a pathetic
human who's barely 

231
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,541
been alive for twenty years.

232
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:37,041
And you think you can
admonish an Old Blood?

233
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,583
What about you?

234
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,208
You've lived a hundred years,

235
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,458
and what have
you made of yourself?

236
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,791
What do you have to
show for your heroism?

237
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,333
Who do you think you are?!

238
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:53,708
Listen!

239
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,375
Kotaro has been
kept safe up 'til now.

240
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,250
But it's not because of you.

241
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:02,000
Everyone in the Special
Zone has tried help.

242
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,416
You'll never be alone here,

243
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,416
because we all look
out for one another.

244
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,500
That's how the people here have
decided to lead their lives.

245
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,750
Understand?

246
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,583
How formidable Cassa is.

247
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:15,125
How dangerous the
Kowloon Children are.

248
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,375
Everyone knows about all that.

249
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,208
That's why they're
banding together now

250
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,000
and fighting for
all they're worth.

251
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,666
Because they know they
don't stand a chance alone,

252
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:27,083
but if we all fight together,
we can protect what's important!

253
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:30,958
We can't do it without you.
We need you, so please for

254
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:34,375
Kotaro's sake join forces
with those already fighting.

255
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:37,458
Only then will you
be able to defeat Cassa.

256
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:40,083
Only then will you become
a great river that can

257
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:43,708
stand fast against the
most powerful of forces.

258
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,000
So that...

259
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,500
someday, that river...

260
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:53,333
will lead you to the ocean.

261
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:14,416
But Mimiko... How in the
world did you know that?

262
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:32,000
No!

263
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,375
Wasn't the smartest move
using your body as a shield.

264
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:38,958
You're still far too erratic.

265
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:41,541
Silver Blade, my boy.

266
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:43,375
Brother!

267
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,333
Stay away!

268
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:22,791
Mimiko, no!

269
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:06,083
You aren't alone.
For starters, you have me.

270
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:10,833
Episode twelve, "For the
Eternal Pulse of Mine Bloodline,

271
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,666
I Would Offer
this Blood in Totality"
