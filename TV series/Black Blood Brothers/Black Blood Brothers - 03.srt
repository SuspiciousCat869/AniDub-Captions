1
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:46,625
I am so sorry...

2
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:50,625
You've been very
kind to me, but...

3
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:55,083
You don't
have to say anything.

4
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:57,500
And you dont need
to be sorry, Alice.

5
00:01:57,583 --> 00:02:00,208
What's done is done.
I'm happy being with you.

6
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:03,000
Jiro!

7
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,125
I can see the moon...

8
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:32,583
But my moon is here...

9
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:37,000
My full moon...

10
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,958
Stop on by for
a delicious pork bun!

11
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:03,250
Wow, those look yummy... No!

12
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,666
If I get sidetracked
brother will get mad

13
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,166
and punish me again.

14
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,000
Hey...

15
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,166
I'm glad to see you managed
to make it out alive.

16
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,208
Whoa...

17
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,125
Hey...! Is she
gonna be all right?

18
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,500
She'll be fine. More
importantly, what happened to

19
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,625
your brother
and that company woman?

20
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,083
We split up so
we wouldn't get caught

21
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,625
and now I have no idea
where my brother and Mimi are.

22
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,208
So, you're alone?

23
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,458
It'd be best if
you came with us.

24
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:38,625
We're about to
head to our hideout to

25
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,041
meet up with our group.

26
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:44,291
Really... Oh, but I have
to keep looking for my brother.

27
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:45,916
Come with us
and we'll help you.

28
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,958
You shouldn't be
wandering around alone.

29
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,333
You'll help?

30
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,166
It appears that Wong
here has grown awfully fond of

31
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,458
your brother, little man.

32
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,541
I must say my interest
has been piqued, too...

33
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,333
In your brother...
as well as you.

34
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:58,958
In me?

35
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,833
Kotaro!

36
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,166
Mimiko!

37
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,708
Would it be at all possible
for me to come along?

38
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,166
Sure, but you'll be
treated as a prisoner,

39
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,166
I understand... I promise I
won't cause you any problems.

40
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,583
I guess it's settled then...

41
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,583
I'll lead the way
back to our hideout.

42
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,666
Follow me. It won't take long.

43
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,291
Were together again.

44
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,291
Wake up!

45
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,666
What the hell's
the matter with you?!

46
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,750
You know, your treatment of

47
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:40,416
prisoners leaves
much to be desired?

48
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,000
How dare you disrupt my sleep,

49
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,416
and for the
second day in a row?

50
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,833
Shut up! You're lucky
I'm letting you sleep at all.

51
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,791
The sun hasn't even set.

52
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:52,166
It's only natural for a vampire
to sleep during daylight hours.

53
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,750
You don't understand the
weight of your situation...

54
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,041
And I'm getting
tired of your attitude.

55
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,958
Sorry my confidence
threatens you,

56
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,458
But I can't help but be myself.

57
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,875
And I don't intend
to change just for you.

58
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,208
So do what you must,
but do it quickly.

59
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,541
Let me get this straight.

60
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,541
You honestly expect me to
believe you know nothing about

61
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,625
those refugees we
encountered on the ship?

62
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:15,000
I didn't know them.
I have no reason to lie to you.

63
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,583
Yeah?

64
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:19,708
Then why won't you tell me the
truth about who you really are?

65
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,041
Enough with that already.
I told you,

66
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,958
I'm one of the last survivors
of a severed bloodline.

67
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,250
My only blood
relation is my brother.

68
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,208
And I bet you'd like to know...

69
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,375
where your brother is...

70
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,041
I'm warning you...

71
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,041
If my brother is
harmed in any way...

72
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,541
I will be able to detect it,

73
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:41,375
even if we are separated
by a great distance.

74
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,916
So don't you dare
lay a hand on him.

75
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,208
Yeah? That a threat?

76
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:50,125
Not a threat... A promise.

77
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,125
I think you should be
more worried about what those

78
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,666
refugees will do
to your little brother.

79
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,333
Our intelligence says he met up
with them in the city earlier.

80
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,750
And that the Compromiser's
with them as well.

81
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,583
Mimiko's with him.
Why's she there?

82
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:07,833
I don't know... Mediation
Department's always interfering.

83
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:08,916
Bastards...

84
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,458
And I assume you
know where they are now.

85
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:13,333
They're in Chinatown.
We're about to move in.

86
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:14,916
You idiot!

87
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,375
Escalating this conflict will
only serve to make things worse.

88
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:21,916
We have reason to believe

89
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,583
that there's a Kowloon
Child among the refugees.

90
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,208
That can't be...

91
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,958
We haven't been able
to determine which of them

92
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,166
are Kowloon Children yet...

93
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,875
And because of
this we have no choice

94
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,916
but to wipe
them out completely.

95
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
We can't leave
any of them alive.

96
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,833
It's time. Move out.

97
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:41,916
Yes, Sir!

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,500
Wait! Let me come with you.

99
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:47,416
I assure you, we can solve
this problem without your help.

100
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,250
But if you miss even one of them
they'll continue to multiply.

101
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,541
The battle could
very quickly grow

102
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,000
beyond your capabilities.

103
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,500
We'll handle it.

104
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,916
That was quite
a stunt you pulled.

105
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,041
What are you talking about?

106
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,833
This afternoon in the park...

107
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,000
I bet keeping a lid on that

108
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,541
commotion cost the
company a ton of money.

109
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:18,791
With nothing to show for it.
How do you plan on explaining--

110
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,291
Shut up!

111
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,375
It's not my problem if the
public becomes aware there are

112
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:22,958
still vampires on the loose.

113
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,458
It's my job to rid the earth of
the plague of Kowloon Children

114
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,375
and I'll do everything
in my power to do so,

115
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,083
no matter what the cost.

116
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:35,666
The board of directors can
all go eat shit for all I care.

117
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,291
Oh, Badrick, you're so rough!

118
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,583
But what's the hurry?

119
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:46,375
Shouldn't you wait for backup
before you go after the Kowloon?

120
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:47,833
I don't have time.

121
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:50,583
They've almost made
it to the Special Zone.

122
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,416
Remember ten years ago,
when vampires fought

123
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,041
alongside humans
in their effort to

124
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,250
destroy the Kowloon Bloodline?

125
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,541
Such blind heroism.

126
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,416
You fold this
corner here and then...

127
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,500
See...? A crane!

128
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,541
Wow! That's so cool!

129
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,291
Now it's my turn.

130
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:19,208
Well...? What's that Kotaro...?
Do you know origami too?

131
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,916
My brother taught
me how to make this.

132
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,166
Really?

133
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,125
Ta-da!

134
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:24,958
Oh wow!

135
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,416
What's that?

136
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,291
Watch!

137
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,458
Hello, Miss Wong.

138
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,083
It flew.

139
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,208
Here's another one.

140
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:51,916
That flew far.

141
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,791
Why don't you go play with Chan
and keep an eye on her, 'kay?

142
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,416
Roger!

143
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,041
Hey, Chan. Wait for me!

144
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,500
Chan has a new friend.
They seem happy.

145
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,791
You look better.
Has your injury healed?

146
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:07,000
Yeah... I had a fresh meal and
now everything's back to normal.

147
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,791
So... Our friend Jiro
must have been really worn out

148
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,416
from the fight
the other night.

149
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,833
Why didn't you let
him drink your blood?

150
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,000
Well... it's just...

151
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:22,041
I'm sorry.
Did I embarrass you?

152
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:25,625
It's just...
He'd use his mouth to...

153
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,125
What's wrong with that?

154
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,416
In return you'd be rewarded
with an exquisite pleasure.

155
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,333
And in all honesty,
sex pales in comparison.

156
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:33,541
Well... be that as it may...

157
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,083
It... It carries, you know,

158
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,500
a psychologically
addictive quality...

159
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,416
And under Company policy
it is strictly forbidden

160
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,500
for us to allow ourselves to--

161
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,333
It's against the rules.

162
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,875
Besides... I don't
know if he's...

163
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:49,791
Don't worry. He's not.
He's not a Kowloon child.

164
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,875
Do you know something
you're not telling me?

165
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,041
About Jiro?

166
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,291
If he's who I think he is...

167
00:09:56,375 --> 00:10:00,416
He can't be a Kowloon.
He is an Old Blood.

168
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,000
If you would have let
him drink your blood,

169
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:05,500
he could have easily escaped
from that ambush earlier.

170
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:06,583
Are you sure?

171
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,500
Last night he
completely overwhelmed

172
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:09,958
the suppression team.

173
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,791
No way... The Company's
suppression team is known as

174
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:15,125
one of the most effective
vampire assault units

175
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,333
in the whole world.

176
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,375
You'll see soon enough.

177
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:22,333
Chan! Where'd you go?

178
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,500
When you said earlier
that you would accept Jiro,

179
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:38,666
even if he were a Kowloon
Child... Did you mean it?

180
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:40,708
'Course I did.

181
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,250
How could you?

182
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,500
You're aware of how infectious
the Kowloon are, aren't you?

183
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,916
Under normal circumstances,
humans will not turn

184
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,125
unless we drink the
blood of a vampire.

185
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:52,625
But the Kowloon can turn humans
just by sucking their blood.

186
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:55,750
They can even convert other
vampires to their bloodline.

187
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:58,125
If we allow them
to exist unchecked...

188
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,833
it could spell disaster.

189
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,875
Back in my country,
there's no place left

190
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:06,500
for broken bloodlines.
It's a wretched existence.

191
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,166
This hasn't
been an easy journey.

192
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,041
We've already lost
two from our group with

193
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:14,666
no explanation as to
where they went or why.

194
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,583
As if they had
anywhere to go, anyway.

195
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:20,375
Just as humans fear
and persecute vampires,

196
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:24,375
vampires also fear and
persecute the Kowloon Children.

197
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:25,791
We're all forsaken.

198
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:28,750
The differences between
our races are inconsequential.

199
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,000
No, you're wrong!

200
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,208
Excuse me?

201
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,291
It's been ten years
since the Kowloon Shock.

202
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,125
If even one of them
had survived the purge,

203
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,166
then at least half the
world's population should be of

204
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,916
their bloodline by now.

205
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,583
But that's not the case.
And why do you suppose that is?

206
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,166
I don't know...

207
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:48,083
It's because the Kowloon kill
the people that they feed on.

208
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,041
They callously take
the lives of those who

209
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,916
they have converted
over to their bloodline.

210
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,916
So no, Wong,
you are nothing like them.

211
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,333
Chan!

212
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:06,291
Hey, Chan... Where are you?

213
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:08,708
Chan... What's that?

214
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,416
My airplane.

215
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,750
Kotaro...

216
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,333
Is that you?

217
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:19,458
There you are! Finally! I've
been looking all over for you.

218
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:22,750
Chan?

219
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,875
Kotaro... Want to play?

220
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:51,291
I'm sorry... My darling, Jiro!

221
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:54,416
I'm super repentant! A bunch of
unforeseen circumstances arose

222
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,416
one after the other and since
you don't even have a cell phone

223
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,375
I had no way of
getting in contact with you.

224
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,250
I promise it'll
never happen again.

225
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:01,083
You're dead!

226
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,041
Oh my... Are you mad at me?

227
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,041
I should have known
it was a horrible idea to

228
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,958
leave all my travel
arrangements up to you.

229
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,166
It was an unfortunate
series of mishaps.

230
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,166
I couldn't have
known there would be

231
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,791
other stowaways onboard.

232
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,583
Enough of this.
Did you bring it?

233
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,250
Oh, but of course I did.

234
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,333
I must say that I'm a little
concerned about Kotaro...

235
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,125
Please take care of him.

236
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:45,333
Oh. Now it looks like you
mean business. Go get 'em.

237
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,083
I'll deal with you later.

238
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:51,458
But first I'll settle things
with the ghosts of the past.

239
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,541
Right. Let me
show you the way.

240
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,333
Welcome back, Silver Blade.

241
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,875
Could I ask you something?

242
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,166
Sure.

243
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,125
I want to know why
you decided to come with us.

244
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,125
Well... I guess...

245
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,958
I'm still new at this
to tell you the truth.

246
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,541
But I wanted to see this thing
through to its completion.

247
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,291
I am a Compromiser after all.

248
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:16,375
Even if you may be
dealing with Kowloon Children?

249
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:18,416
If I wasn't
working for the Company,

250
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,666
then I wouldn't have
anywhere else to go...

251
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,416
'Cause I'm an orphan.

252
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,125
The company gave me a home.

253
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,791
They took care of
me when nobody else would

254
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:28,083
and they became my family.

255
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,833
That's why now I want
to be the one who gets to

256
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:34,750
tell everyone that
they'll never be alone.

257
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:38,416
'Cause I understand.
I've been there, too.

258
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,583
Oh. You don't
have to cry for me.

259
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,375
There are a lot of
kids in the Special Zone

260
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,500
who've lost their parents.

261
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:51,041
And are all these other orphans
compromisers just like you?

262
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,791
Like me? Just what
is that supposed to mean?

263
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,458
It's settled.

264
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,416
I'd like for you to talk
to the Company on our behalf.

265
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,916
But... What would I say?

266
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,416
Ask permission for us
to enter the Special Zone.

267
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,458
If they'll give us a
place to live I promise that

268
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,916
we'll accept any
conditions they deem necessary.

269
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,208
We just want a place
where we can live in peace.

270
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:14,458
I beg you...
Please don't forsake us.

271
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:17,000
You're the
only chance we have.

272
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,125
What's that?

273
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,041
Miss Wong!

274
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,708
Damn it!
The suppression team...

275
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,125
Garlic gas!

276
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,791
You have to stop,
you can't...

277
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,833
Wait... it's the compromiser.

278
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,791
We need to get you out of here.

279
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,041
Hey, stop!

280
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:11,791
Stop it!

281
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,458
These people are under the

282
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,083
care of the
Department of Mediation.

283
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,625
Cease your assault immediately.

284
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:24,500
Don't listen to her.
Keep firing.

285
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,666
I swear! I won't let
you get away with this.

286
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,625
This raid is
nothing but a massacre.

287
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,166
This is none of
your business, Compromiser.

288
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,291
Now get the hell out of
the way before you get hurt.

289
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:37,333
Your actions here today clearly
break Company regulations.

290
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,708
You can't justify slaughter.

291
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,750
I'll explain
the circumstance later.

292
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:47,625
Let go of me!
Damn it! Let go!

293
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,291
That's enough, Mimiko.

294
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,458
You've done plenty.

295
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,583
Miss Wong...

296
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,625
We surrender...

297
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:01,208
We have no intention of
resisting you any further...

298
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:02,625
So...

299
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:06,666
I ask that you please
spare the lives of my friends.

300
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,291
Shoot them!

301
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:13,375
What are you doing...?
Shoot them! Shoot them all!

302
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,250
No!

303
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,625
It's the Hide Hand!

304
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,041
It's just as we had suspected.

305
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,250
You're harboring a
Kowloon Child, aren't you?

306
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:32,125
That's ridiculous! We're
all from broken bloodlines.

307
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,625
That's all the more
reason why you wouldn't

308
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:35,625
be able to distinguish
one in your group.

309
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,500
And no vampire from
a broken bloodline would

310
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,041
be able to master
the Hide Hand technique.

311
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,791
Am I wrong?

312
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,166
I-I don't know...

313
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,375
But we've been together
since we left our homeland.

314
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,500
We would've found
out about it by now.

315
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,541
We've lost two from our group. 

316
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:53,541
It's because the Kowloon kill
the people that they feed on.

317
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:58,625
Then it's true...
But who...? Who is it?!

318
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,083
Get a hold of yourself!

319
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,958
Don't lose it now.
We're so close.

320
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,916
What happened to the bravery you
showed when we left our country?

321
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,416
Come on, Wong. Let's
destroy these Company scum.

322
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,333
Tsang...

323
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:16,500
I just want you to know... It
did make me happy earlier today

324
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:20,125
when you said you'd even welcome
someone of my dubious bloodline.

325
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:22,458
We Kowloon Children
are used to being hated.

326
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:25,458
I guess you could say
we're starved for kindness.

327
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,291
Open fire!

328
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,833
You fools!

329
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,916
Now... Let's get started.

330
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:52,750
Where's Kotaro?
I have to find him!

331
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,083
We can't afford to
let them overtake us.

332
00:18:58,166 --> 00:18:59,833
We have to put them down!

333
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,166
These guys are fighting under
the control of their master.

334
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,750
Call it liberation.

335
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,041
Now then...

336
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,500
I owe you my
thanks, Compromiser.

337
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:38,000
After all, if it
wasn't for you...

338
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:44,083
Attack! Get him!

339
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,875
Quite an entrance...

340
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,875
You escaped!

341
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,791
I don't know where
Kotaro is. I'm so sorry...

342
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:10,000
Don't worry about it.
He hasn't been harmed.

343
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,916
Now hand over my brother.

344
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,625
You'll have to
ask nicer than that.

345
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:21,500
You've succumbed to
my eye raid so easily.

346
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:22,666
You were already half-dead

347
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,375
before you
even joined the fight.

348
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,416
It's such an
unfortunate mistake.

349
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,125
I've heard a lot about you.

350
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:32,041
But how pathetic. So much
for the great kin-killer.

351
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:35,625
Did you call him the
kin-killer? That means he's...

352
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:36,666
the silver blade.

353
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,375
Wait... The silver blade?

354
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:43,208
I will not ask you again...
Give me my brother!

355
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,541
Look, it's Kotaro!

356
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:53,666
And Chan!

357
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,083
Oh, look...
What an emotional reunion.

358
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:02,958
Chan, now!

359
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,416
No don't!

360
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:13,875
You bastard!

361
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,458
Jiro!

362
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,791
Help! Get me outta here!
Brother, you have to help me!

363
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,916
Ah! This hurts like hell!

364
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,958
I guess that I underestimated
our little friend here.

365
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:27,666
Makes no difference...

366
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,375
I think it's time to
get this thing started.

367
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,041
So you're running away.

368
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:45,000
It's no fun here.
Let's go elsewhere.

369
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,000
You fool... Don't you know...?

370
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,333
That entire island
is surrounded by a barrier...

371
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,541
Kowloon children aren't allowed
to enter the Special Zone

372
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,333
without an invitation
from the Company.

373
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:57,750
I'm not worried.
You see... I've been invited.

374
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:01,625
You won't forsake
us now, right, Compromiser?

375
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:09,041
You won't get away!

376
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:15,500
See you guys later.
I'm bored with this.

377
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:18,541
Kotaro!

378
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,166
Kotaro!

379
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,083
Kotaro!

380
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:00,041
You'll never understand us.

381
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:01,750
You, whose bloodline
has transcends death

382
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:03,583
will never know
what we go through.

383
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:06,583
True. I don't
understand your hardships.

384
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:08,666
But neither can you
understand the destiny

385
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,041
and curse of my bloodline.

386
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:12,208
So don't assume that you do.

387
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:15,333
Episode four: "Old Blood"
