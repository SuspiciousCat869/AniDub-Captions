1
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:48,291
Jiro, you need to learn to be

2
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,166
more mindful of
your surroundings.

3
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,625
But I'm always aware
of what's around me.

4
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:55,291
If I wasn't, then I wouldn't
be very good at protecting you.

5
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:57,625
That wasn't really
what I was talking about.

6
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,375
I don't know how
to say this exactly.

7
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:05,166
Do you think that
water is strong?

8
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,541
Water? Is it strong?
I don't know.

9
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:10,083
And the river?

10
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:12,583
I'm not exactly sure
what you're getting at.

11
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:16,041
And then what about
the ocean? Is it strong too?

12
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:17,166
I guess you could say it

13
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,875
possesses a certain
kind of strength.

14
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,916
But when I think of the ocean,
I don't really think of it

15
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,166
in terms of
strength or weakness.

16
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:26,375
When you find yourself
facing the ocean,

17
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:27,958
the question of
whether or not it's strong

18
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,208
doesn't really matter anymore.

19
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,625
Water is water,
no matter where it is.

20
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:34,916
And it's the same
with blood, Jiro.

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,666
That's the nature of who we are.

22
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,416
Our true value is
not in being the water,

23
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,291
but in that we
could be the ocean.

24
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,833
I think I get it.

25
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:50,000
Good. Can you
be the ocean, Jiro?

26
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,500
I promise I'll try.

27
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,708
Mimi...

28
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:16,333
I'm so glad.

29
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:18,333
What in the world do
you have to be glad about?

30
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,250
Your apartment just exploded.

31
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,541
I'm glad because my
apartment was the only one that

32
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,291
got damaged in the blast.

33
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,208
I've always complained
this building was too old

34
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,750
and run down, but I guess the

35
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,000
foundation's in
pretty good shape.

36
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,958
I'm really impressed
it's still standing.

37
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,541
What? Have you gone crazy?

38
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,291
Don't cry, Kotaro.

39
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:43,125
But I-I can't help it,
brother. I feel bad for Mimi.

40
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,208
You don't see
Mimiko crying do you?

41
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,708
So there's no reason
for you to cry either.

42
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:55,500
We better go.

43
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:56,916
We can't leave.

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,416
If we stay we'll be
interviewed by the police which

45
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,541
is more trouble than it's worth.

46
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:03,916
Listen to me, Jiro. We have
to go to the Company now.

47
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,291
I'll report to my superiors and

48
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,416
have them deal
with this appropriately.

49
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,291
And don't worry. Even if my
boss says no, I'll find a way.

50
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:15,250
You and Kotaro will stay here
and live in the Special Zone.

51
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:31,000
I promise, Auguste Wyker,

52
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:35,541
I will carve the ways of the
Black Blood into your bones.

53
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,750
I never expected Auguste
to engage the Silver Blade

54
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:46,625
in battle so quickly. Man,
that was a pretty close call.

55
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:49,000
If our cover's
blown, we're screwed.

56
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,666
It's a good thing that
I always make a point to

57
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,000
prepare for the worst. But...
with the mess he's gotten into

58
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,291
with the Silver
Blade I don't think

59
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,500
we can leave Auguste
to his own devices.

60
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:01,000
I guess I'll have to
ask you to take care of this.

61
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,666
I hope you don't mind.

62
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,041
Hey, Yafuri?

63
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:10,958
Oh no! This is not good!

64
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,708
If sis finds out I--

65
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,583
Oh man!

66
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,000
Hi.

67
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:24,083
Hey, sis. How are ya? Haven't
heard from you in a while.

68
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,583
Thank you for coming.

69
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:46,708
I appreciate your presense
here, Miss Katsuragi.

70
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,958
I heard about what
happened to your apartment.

71
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,250
I'm sorry for your loss,

72
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,291
but I'm glad to see
that you were not harmed.

73
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,875
Thank you for your
kind words, Chairman.

74
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:57,750
Zhang, how have we
been handling the media?

75
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:00,958
We told them the explosion
was caused by a gas leak.

76
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,291
And said that the
resident is currently on

77
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:06,333
a month long vacation
in mainland Japan.

78
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,791
Mimiko. I'm very sorry.

79
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:14,125
It all comes with the territory
when you're a compromiser.

80
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,333
Do you have
anything you'd like to

81
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,375
report to us
about the incident?

82
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:21,333
I heard the Silver Blade let
that idiot Auguste get away.

83
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:24,083
Yes. He escaped by
jumping into the canal.

84
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:27,666
He should have cut that rebel
fool in half. Talk about sloppy.

85
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,166
What kind of attitude is that?

86
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,333
What do you mean?

87
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:33,458
He's not my subordinate,
so what do I care?

88
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:37,375
For this outburst, we must
ensure that Auguste Wyker

89
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,666
and the rest of
his Coven pay dearly.

90
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:43,583
But, we must also
take into consideration,

91
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,000
how we might prevent
another from taking

92
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,583
Auguste's place
when he's disposed of.

93
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,083
Thanks for taking care of it.

94
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,458
No problem.

95
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,666
Son of a bitch!

96
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,125
What's going on? Janaway!

97
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,333
Oh no.

98
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,208
I told you we
have no intention of

99
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:45,166
accepting the Silver Blade as
a resident of the Special Zone.

100
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,791
We cannot allow
anyone to live here

101
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:50,166
who is constantly surrounded
by disorder and chaos.

102
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,583
Well then, if that's the case.

103
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:54,125
I'd be more than happy
to welcome him into my House.

104
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,083
Do you have any idea
of the consequences

105
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,791
that action would
bring upon you?

106
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:01,083
Of course not. I may be
older than most everyone here,

107
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:04,666
but that doesn't mean I can
accurately predict the future.

108
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,916
What an interesting development.

109
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,791
You would actually
have him join you?

110
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,708
Please, enlighten us
with your reasoning.

111
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,083
What can I say?

112
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,458
When I met him earlier
today he piqued my interest.

113
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:16,875
And I must say
his little brother is

114
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,541
quite a piece of work.

115
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,291
I hope you get
the chance to meet them.

116
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,916
You'll be pleasantly surprised.
As a former vampire hunter

117
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,291
I'm sure you've
heard the stories of

118
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,958
the legendary Silver Blade.

119
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,541
Hunter?

120
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:31,083
Do not lay a hand
on the Sage's blood.

121
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,958
Or have you forgotten
the unwritten law of this land?

122
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,250
What a scandalous accusation.

123
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,250
I assure you, Zhang,
that I have no intention of

124
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,791
harming the Sage.

125
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:42,666
Oh. Then please tell me why
the great Crimson-Eyed Zelman

126
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,208
would be so interested
in a stripling such as Jiro.

127
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:49,791
What does it matter to you,
Cain. Why do you even care?

128
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,416
Just answer my question.

129
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,541
Don't play dumb with me.
You know the reason.

130
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,500
Sure, he's the
Hero of Hong Kong,

131
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,500
and he's of the
Sage's bloodline.

132
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:01,250
But I'm not interested
in any of that.

133
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,583
What impresses me is the fact
that he killed the Kowloon King.

134
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,500
Zelman, enough.

135
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:12,541
Stop it. Control your tongue.

136
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:22,208
Lord Dragon, stop. Look
at what you're doing to her.

137
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,208
Oh I-I'm sorry.

138
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,500
Are you all right, Mimiko?

139
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:31,875
Oh, yes.

140
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,208
Hey! You can't go in there!

141
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,416
But Mimi's in there, right?

142
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,666
What's this kid doing here?

143
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,000
Is that Kotaro?

144
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,041
It's fine. Let him in.

145
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:43,791
Hey Mimiko.
I have terrible news.

146
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,375
What happened?

147
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,333
Brother went out
and left me alone.

148
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,958
He went out? Where did he go?

149
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:52,708
He said he was going
to mount an assault.

150
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:56,541
He was smiling,
but his eyes were scary.

151
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,083
Oh no...

152
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:03,041
That's what I'm talking about.
He really is quite interesting.

153
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,750
Damn that idiot!
What's he doing?

154
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,291
Zhang. Give the orders
to the suppression team.

155
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:08,791
Have them take care of this.

156
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,750
I want them mobilized
in under ten minutes.

157
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,208
Yes, Chairman.

158
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,166
Wait a minute.

159
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,208
You're not really planning
on attacking Jiro, are you?

160
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,583
Hopefully it
won't come to that,

161
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,291
but we can't take any chances.

162
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:20,958
There has to be some other way.

163
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,083
We can't afford for
this thing to get out of hand

164
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,333
and for the public
to find out about

165
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,250
the battles between
the Black Bloods.

166
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:29,208
And to put it bluntly, as long
as it stays under the radar,

167
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,333
we won't have to get involved.

168
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,250
Miss Katsuragi.

169
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:40,000
There's a vampire out there
trying to stir up trouble.

170
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:44,208
You're a compromiser, aren't
you? So mediate the situation.

171
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,166
Jiro Mochizuki is
your responsibility.

172
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,458
So go find him and try to
talk him out of this fight.

173
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:53,375
That's an order, Mimiko.

174
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:58,708
Come on, Kotaro!
We have to go stop Jiro.

175
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:08,333
She's a sassy one.
Tell me, Jinnai.

176
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:09,666
What is it?

177
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,333
I hear that you're
the one who decided to

178
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,541
send that girl
after the Silver Blade.

179
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:14,916
Did you pick her
just because she was

180
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,708
the only one
available at the time?

181
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,625
I don't remember
why I chose her.

182
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:22,375
It was before the crack of
dawn when I made that decision.

183
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,791
I think I was half asleep.

184
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,750
You sly fox.

185
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,958
We're not done here yet.

186
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,291
What's that?

187
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,375
If there are no objections,

188
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,291
I'd like to move
on to the main agenda.

189
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:36,750
I thought we were
only going to discuss

190
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,666
how to deal with
the Silver Blade today.

191
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,291
Of course, handling
him is a delicate issue,

192
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,833
but there is a more
immediate problem at hand.

193
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:46,083
And that problem is this...

194
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,375
Who's that?

195
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,625
Johan Tsang, he tried
to enter the Special Zone

196
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,125
late last night.

197
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,291
And he's a Kowloon Child.

198
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,250
Move aside!

199
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:10,333
I see. That's unfortunate.

200
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:14,208
But it's too late to do anything
about Yafuri's overzealousness.

201
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,791
Thought so.

202
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,625
Then I guess we better figure
out a way to rescue him somehow.

203
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,125
Forget about him.

204
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,375
 You can't mean that!

205
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,916
He's sure to get himself
killed by Silver Blade.

206
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,708
He brought it on himself.

207
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,000
Cold bitch.

208
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,541
Did you say something?

209
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:29,791
Nope!

210
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,458
He may not be able to win.

211
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:34,333
But he'll at least escape
by the skin of his teeth.

212
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:37,416
He is my little
brother, after all.

213
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,875
I wish I could see
the panic on Jiro's face.

214
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:43,791
Is that all you care about?

215
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,791
Alright. I think
I'm ready to go in.

216
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,166
Please tell me
you're just joking.

217
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,916
Once you go in, it won't
be easy for you to get back out.

218
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,625
Cain and Sei have
grown complacent

219
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:54,916
during this time of peace.

220
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,458
Just you wait,
I'll give them the

221
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,833
wake-up call
they've been needing.

222
00:13:58,916 --> 00:13:59,708
Pig-headed.

223
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,041
What did you say to me?

224
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,166
Nothing.

225
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,041
Okay. Do it.

226
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,333
I welcome you
to the Special Zone.

227
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,500
Miss Cassandra Jill Warlock.

228
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,000
Hello.

229
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,208
Jiro.

230
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,833
This is how it works, huh?
Kill anyone who crosses you?

231
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,541
You don't have
to thank me, Mimiko.

232
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:48,166
You idiot! It was
just a stupid apartment!

233
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,916
This will only make your
situation here even worse.

234
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,083
So why? Why did you do it?

235
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,916
I taught them a lesson.

236
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,291
What? What do you mean?

237
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,833
I showed them what
would happen if they

238
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:02,166
decided to mess with me again.
Think I got my point across?

239
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,500
Ugh! You can't do this.
Not here in the Special Zone.

240
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:09,208
If you want to stay here. You'll
have to stop this right now!

241
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,791
I don't think they're
going to let me stay here

242
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,000
much longer anyway.

243
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:13,375
I'll make them!

244
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:16,708
I promised you that! And
I intend to keep my promise.

245
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,625
I'm not even sure that
we should stay here anymore.

246
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,625
What if you had died
in that explosion today?

247
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:25,000
Have you considered the chain of
events that would have unfolded?

248
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,875
Both Cain and Sei would
have been completely enraged.

249
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,750
Without a doubt, Auguste
and his gang would have been

250
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,750
turned to ash
and scattered at sea.

251
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,375
That would surely
strike terror into those

252
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,625
who are at odds with the
Company, and it would have

253
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:38,666
further strengthened
the peace in the Special Zone.

254
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,125
All would live
happily ever after.

255
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:45,166
It may seem harsh,
but you know I'm right.

256
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,583
Mimiko. I'd never
forgive myself if

257
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,708
I was responsible
for your death.

258
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:52,750
I hate to say this after all the
trouble I've put you through,

259
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:55,083
but it's not
right for us to stay.

260
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,833
I feel we must leave.

261
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,833
For your safety.

262
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,750
But you can't.

263
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:33,875
And good evening to you, sir.

264
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:37,000
I had a feeling we hadn't
seen the last of you yet.

265
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,416
After studying our intelligence,
we've come to the conclusion

266
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,041
that arrangements were made for
him to enter the Special Zone.

267
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,708
There's someone in
the Special Zone who

268
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,625
would invite a Kowloon Child?

269
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,333
If a Kowloon Child
were to cross the barrier,

270
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,583
would it be at all
possible for us to detect it?

271
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:57,000
No sir. The barrier
that I constructed

272
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,166
does not have that capability.

273
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,333
The barrier doesn't just
keep them from entering.

274
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,375
It would also keep
them from leaving.

275
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,625
A Kowloon Child
that somehow makes it in

276
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:08,208
would have no choice
but to settle here.

277
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:09,500
Zelman!

278
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,041
Hello?

279
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,000
No, I'm still in the meeting.

280
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,625
What's that? What
are you trying to say?

281
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,666
Hey. Just wait.
Calm down, Sayuka!

282
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,791
What happened?

283
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,791
A man who Auguste drank dry
today has come back to life.

284
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,291
And then?

285
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:37,166
Janaway was bitten by the
man and he started going crazy.

286
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,125
He and the other three
ended up killing each other.

287
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:43,250
And then they all turned to ash.

288
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:46,875
What. What could have
caused all this to happen?

289
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,000
Could it be?
Please say it isn't.

290
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:54,041
That's all for today.
Go home and get some rest.

291
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,166
Yes, sir.

292
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,875
Just let me confirm one thing.

293
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,458
You're completely sure

294
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:01,041
that it was Auguste who
drank that man's blood?

295
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:03,750
Yes. There's no doubt about it.

296
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,958
Got it. Good night.

297
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,583
Have the suppression team
switch everything over to

298
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,208
anti-Kowloon
equipment immediately.

299
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,166
Yes!

300
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,250
Lord Dragon.

301
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:16,708
By the will of heaven,
Jiro is there.

302
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,375
Through him, we'll live.

303
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:22,250
I feel more powerful
now than I ever have.

304
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,125
Even when I was first turned.

305
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,666
I must confess that
I never felt so alive.

306
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,833
Bastard. Don't tell
me you're one of them now.

307
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,333
One of whom?

308
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,958
Don't play dumb!

309
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:34,375
In Hong Kong, I cut down more
of you than I care to remember.

310
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,833
I've seen this before.
There's no mistaking it!

311
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:37,958
You are one of them.

312
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:41,291
So it is as I suspected. I see.

313
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:44,250
So this is what it is
like to be a Kowloon Child.

314
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,458
Tell me who bit you.

315
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,625
But I haven't
been bitten by anyone.

316
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,583
Liar. Then how?

317
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,833
I don't care how it happened.

318
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,958
Mimi? Don't worry.

319
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:03,500
My brother will never
lose to a guy like that.

320
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,041
I hope you're right.

321
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:09,291
But I've been feeling
strange lately and I don't why.

322
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:12,125
I've got a bad feeling
in the pit of my stomach.

323
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,791
Shall we duel Silver Blade?

324
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,375
Quite impressive, Silver Blade.

325
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:14,333
As you know I have a long
history with Kowloon Children.

326
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:17,416
And I've vowed to never
let a single one escape.

327
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,458
It's a shame. You were
an excellent swordsman.

328
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,250
It's not over.

329
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,875
You're wrong. It is over.

330
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,541
I drank from my own men.

331
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,250
What did you just say?

332
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:55,833
As long as this blood survives,
then I'll be immortal.

333
00:20:57,083 --> 00:21:00,000
Then I'll kill them... all.

334
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:05,541
It looks like Auguste
has left me a parting gift.

335
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,375
Oh no!

336
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,416
Mimiko! Kotaro!

337
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,291
Sorry I'm late.

338
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:41,875
Just who are you?

339
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,833
Pleased to meet you.
Jiro Mochizuki.

340
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:49,916
The Kin-Killer.
Hero of the crusade.

341
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,125
And the protector of Old Blood.

342
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:55,750
The brave descendent
of the Sage Eve's bloodline.

343
00:21:55,833 --> 00:22:00,125
You're a descendent of
the Kowloon, right? How odd?

344
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:03,875
Yes. I am and my
name is Yafuri Chao.

345
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:05,791
During the crusade,
I was bestowed with

346
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:10,458
the kiss of darkness by
the Kowloon King's own fangs.

347
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:13,291
"I can't wait to see Jiro
again."

348
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:16,125
For ten years, that's
what she's been saying.

349
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:18,083
My sister, Cassa.

350
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:24,833
Cassa.

351
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:02,000
The Kowloon Children are
a menace that I cannot ignore,

352
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:04,791
for their existence
threatens my survival.

353
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:07,166
That is why I
eliminate your kind.

354
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,583
Whether you have
done wrong or not,

355
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:11,291
I assure you that
I will finish you.

356
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:15,291
