1
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:28,666
Welcome.

2
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:32,875
Excuse me.

3
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:34,708
I want to buy him.

4
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:40,833
You want him?

5
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,458
Yes.

6
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:46,208
I'm sorry, but
he's not for sale.

7
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:49,625
You see, I'm giving him to my
granddaughter for her birthday.

8
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:51,875
I'm afraid I
can't sell him to you.

9
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:55,375
What?! Oh, no.

10
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,958
It's okay, Alice.
Please don't get too upset.

11
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:00,833
You don't have to tell me that.

12
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:04,791
Then can I ask you to

13
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:06,375
pass a message along
to your granddaughter?

14
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:08,083
Sure.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,958
Tell her to take
good care of him. Okay?

16
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:18,833
I'll tell her that.
Thanks very much.

17
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:21,000
Alice.

18
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:26,916
What?

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,958
Oh, it's nothing.

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,458
Mimiko.

21
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:03,750
I'm sorry, but I
really don't think you can

22
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:06,333
protect us on
your own anymore.

23
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:09,916
Never underestimate
the people who live here.

24
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,166
I'd just like to see him again.

25
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,416
It's been over
ten years, you know?

26
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,750
So tell me. Can you
be the ocean, Jiro?

27
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:22,000
So that river
will lead to the ocean.

28
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:31,708
Jiro. Kotaro. You aren't alone.

29
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:35,000
For starters, you have me.

30
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,083
Brother!

31
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:28,500
You won, didn't you?
I'm so glad.

32
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:29,833
Yeah.

33
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,166
Hey, Mimiko.

34
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,375
Hi, Jiro.

35
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:46,583
It's time.
You should finish this.

36
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,833
Kotaro.

37
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:57,166
Forgive me. I was trying
to keep you out of harm's way.

38
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,083
But it appears now I
have no choice but to--

39
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,250
Don't worry.

40
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:03,500
I understand, Brother.
Now get 'em!

41
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,750
Damn it!

42
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,458
Jiro.

43
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,291
I have seen your resolve.

44
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:33,041
I will clear the
way for you. Now go!

45
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,750
Thank you, Sei.

46
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:39,750
Mimiko.

47
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,666
I need to tell
you why Kotaro and I

48
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,375
came here to the Special Zone.

49
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,916
Oh, actually, I already--

50
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,416
I brought Kotaro here so
that he might make new friends.

51
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,875
I don't want him to be lonely
when I'm not around anymore.

52
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:04,583
The vampire that turned me
was the Alice Eve, the Sage.

53
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,333
She was a Source Blood.

54
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:11,083
And she was one of the most
ancient among the Black Bloods.

55
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,833
A Source Blood?

56
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:18,125
But she did not attempt to
create any of her own kinsmen,

57
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:21,333
with one exception. Me.

58
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:24,583
I am the only one she has
ever shared her blood with.

59
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:27,791
As her protector,
it is my duty to

60
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:31,500
keep both her body
and her blood safe.

61
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,375
Alice!

62
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,833
She was killed in Hong Kong.

63
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:46,958
But then reborn
in the form a child.

64
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:57,291
Kotaro is that child.
He is her reincarnation.

65
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,041
What?

66
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,083
Cassa!

67
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,333
Jiro!

68
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,000
Cassa!

69
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,375
Alright then, name yourself!

70
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:45,541
I am the Child of
the Sage. Jiro Mochizuki!

71
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:48,541
So that's what you're
calling yourself? Fine then!

72
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,583
Here goes, Jiro!

73
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:58,291
Kotaro. Does he know about this?

74
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:05,375
In her reincarnated
state she is powerless.

75
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,291
She is alive,
but without a sense of

76
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:10,291
herself or her memories.

77
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:17,375
When her reincarnated
form is mature enough,

78
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:20,166
I will return her blood to her.

79
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,625
That is my responsibility
as her protector.

80
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:26,500
And afterwards I
will live on through her.

81
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:29,750
That's why it is called the
bloodline that transcends death.

82
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:33,458
But. Then, someday, Jiro will--

83
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:38,875
I live so that I
may be consumed by her.

84
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:45,500
It... it can't be...

85
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:51,500
Damn it all! Why'd he have to
show up and ruin everything?

86
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,041
Uh...

87
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:56,166
Wait a minute, Zaza, don't tell
me you're the cause of this.

88
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,458
I guess you could say I
stirred up the hornet's nest,

89
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,750
but it was what
sis wanted after all.

90
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,833
You-- You can be
such an idiot sometimes.

91
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:05,166
Fighting amongst yourselves?

92
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,208
Damn!

93
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:45,083
This is what it
means to be a vampire.

94
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:48,333
It is our destiny to sacrifice
anything and everything for

95
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,583
the sake of our bloodline.

96
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,500
Jiro!

97
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:58,166
Cassa!

98
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,250
Damn you, Zelman!

99
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,041
Isn't this fun, Jiro?!

100
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,000
Well... That should
just about do it.

101
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:06,250
I can't believe that they
actually made it through that.

102
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,458
That's some pretty
impressive driving.

103
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,125
Damn, Zelman.

104
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:23,291
This has nothing to do with you.

105
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,166
It looks like sis
is on the defensive.

106
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,000
That's what she
gets for being picky.

107
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,541
What?

108
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,958
She hasn't drank any blood.
Not for the last three months.

109
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,833
That doesn't sound good.

110
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,583
Damn it!

111
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,166
This is the end!

112
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:10,583
It's over. Give it up, Cassa.

113
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,500
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

114
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:16,916
But for my bloodline,
surrendering is not a choice.

115
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,083
Why?

116
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,208
Because it would mean

117
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,875
the complete
eradication of our people.

118
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:26,458
And that is why we will continue
battling to the bitter end.

119
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:29,291
And that is the way
of the Kowloon Child.

120
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:33,666
Well then, at the very least
you can fall beneath my sword.

121
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,625
Cut out the hero talk.
And let's just fight.

122
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:49,666
Such incredible pain! Jiro!

123
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,083
Brother!

124
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:53,875
As expected.

125
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,791
When it comes to the sword,
you have a slight edge.

126
00:12:56,875 --> 00:13:00,750
With this, it will be finished.

127
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,125
It's about time.

128
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:18,416
You bear an
unfortunate weakness.

129
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:22,916
The border!

130
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,208
Once we pass through there,
we'll be outside the barrier!

131
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:28,125
Seems that's it for today!
You'll see me again.

132
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,416
If you survive, of course.

133
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:34,166
Cassa!

134
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,291
Zaza, no!

135
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,750
Cassa!

136
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:52,375
Jiro!

137
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:07,375
Don't ever, come anywhere near
us again, or you'll regret it.

138
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,500
Well, we'll see.

139
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:42,333
I had fun, Jiro.

140
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,541
They got away.

141
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,583
I'm sorry I failed you.

142
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:13,708
Well, at least we're
rid of them for now.

143
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,041
Oh, Mimi. Good morning.

144
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:14,541
What's wrong? Are you
feeling sick or something?

145
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:18,875
Was that all just a dream?

146
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:23,750
Huh? A dream? Oh, brother
told me to give this to you.

147
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,208
It's not much, but here you go.

148
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,083
What's this for?

149
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,208
It's for rent.

150
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,458
What?

151
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,333
He wasn't sure exactly
what rent was like here

152
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:38,166
in the Special Zone, so
he said that's just for now.

153
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,416
He did?

154
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,666
Yup.

155
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,708
We're trying to find a place,
but it might take some time.

156
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:51,750
So we'll have to stay with you
for a little while longer, Mimi.

157
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:55,083
Brother wanted to make a good
impression by paying in advance.

158
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,875
Oh no. Why are you
crying? What's wrong?

159
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,750
Mimi, is that
not enough for rent?

160
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:10,541
Hey. Hey, Mimi!
What's the matter?

161
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,750
Ah, Master Swordsman!

162
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,333
I cannot thank
you enough for--

163
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:20,666
Shougo!

164
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:24,208
Hey, now. We haven't seen
each other in ten years.

165
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:26,250
No way to treat an old friend.

166
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,791
Rinsuke told me everything.

167
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,708
You're just awful.

168
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,208
Now tell me if it's true.

169
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:38,833
Mimiko's apartment
wasn't bombed by

170
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:41,166
the Auguste Wyker,
now was it?

171
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,750
The bomb was placed
at your command.

172
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,958
It's-- It's true.

173
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:51,000
You better have
a damn good reason.

174
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,541
I wanted you to stay together.

175
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:56,708
You and Mimiko
need to be a team.

176
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:58,791
What? That's just absurd.

177
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:02,041
Right or wrong, it
was to make sure you would

178
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,333
remain in the Special Zone.

179
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:07,541
There's an empty
building the Company

180
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,375
once used as a warehouse.

181
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:13,458
It's really old, but
it's more than big enough

182
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,333
for three people to live in.

183
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,458
You had this planned
from the start, didn't you?

184
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,875
Yeah, that's right.

185
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:22,541
But why would you go
to such lengths just to...

186
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,833
What's in the Eleventh Yard?!

187
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,291
Ashes.

188
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,833
But it can't be--

189
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:33,791
I'm afraid so. The ashes were
brought here from Hong Kong.

190
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:37,791
The Special Zone
is a burial ground.

191
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:41,458
The Eleventh Yard holds the
ashes of the Kowloon King.

192
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:45,583
Cassa and her people came here
to retrieve the King's ashes.

193
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,083
They wanted to resurrect him.

194
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:52,458
You defeated the Kowloon
King once before, Jiro.

195
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:55,583
So we need you to be
here if he comes back again.

196
00:18:55,666 --> 00:19:00,208
I-I can't do that. There
won't be a miracle this time.

197
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:03,875
I'm sorry, but you're
the only chance we've got.

198
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,458
So the Lord Dragon
and Cain were

199
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,458
attempting to
alienate me because--

200
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:12,375
That's right. They were trying
to free you of that burden.

201
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:15,875
Jiro, if you're staying
in the Special Zone,

202
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,833
I want you to work for us.

203
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:20,333
You want me to guard
the King's ashes?

204
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:24,125
No. To protect
Mimiko Katsuragi.

205
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:26,541
Mimiko? But why her?

206
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,208
You have to understand.

207
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:32,416
For a human, ten years is
not a short amount of time.

208
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,166
I'm afraid I'm no
longer capable of

209
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,041
fighting alongside you.

210
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:40,916
Protect her for me,
along with the Lord Sage.

211
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,666
Please, Jiro.

212
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,375
I will.

213
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,750
Jiro! You don't
have to push yourself

214
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,458
so hard just to help out.

215
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,708
No, no. I need to help.

216
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:13,541
We are going to be
imposing on you, after all.

217
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:14,625
Oh! Hot!

218
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,416
Let's get you inside.

219
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,458
Talk about lucky. We sure
found a great new place,

220
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,250
and so close, too.

221
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:26,041
I guess good things do
happen every once in a while.

222
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,416
Damn you, Shougo.

223
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,250
What?

224
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:31,500
Nothing.

225
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:36,958
I've been meaning to
talk to you. I need a favor.

226
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:41,708
Listen. You can't
tell Kotaro what you know.

227
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:47,625
Kotaro is that child.
He is her reincarnation.

228
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,541
Once you've returned
the blood to Kotaro,

229
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,666
then what's gonna happen?

230
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:58,000
I'll probably be
completely consumed by her.

231
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,666
Please don't be sad about it.

232
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,416
It's my fate,
and I'm very proud to

233
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,083
carry on the life
of my Source Blood.

234
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,875
Yeah, but--

235
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,541
I found something awesome!

236
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,958
Where did you get
that thing, Kotaro?

237
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,625
Found him upstairs.
Can I keep him?

238
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,916
I promise that I'll always
take really good care of him.

239
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,708
Well all the stuff here
belongs to the Company...

240
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:35,333
But I doubt anyone
will really miss it.

241
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:36,625
Awesome!

242
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,166
And from now on you're
going to be known as

243
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,166
my best friend,
Lord Bowwow.

244
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,833
You're going to be spending
all your time with me!

245
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:53,666
Yes? Katsuragi here.

246
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,250
Yeah.

247
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,791
I understand. We'll head
over there right away.

248
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:04,500
Jiro, Kotaro.
Let's get to work.

249
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,958
Does it have to be in
the middle of the day?

250
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:09,625
Oh, quit your complaining!

251
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:12,416
You're my closer, aren't you?

252
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,875
I suppose so.

253
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,958
Now let's kick some ass!

254
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:17,166
Yeah!

255
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,541
Come on, this is our first
gig! So try to look sharp!

256
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:22,500
Okay, fine.

257
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:30,958
It'll be all right. We'll
figure something out, Jiro.

258
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:32,875
I'm sure of it!

259
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:35,583
Right!

260
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:38,416
Oh, come on!

261
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,625
Do you have to walk so fa--?
