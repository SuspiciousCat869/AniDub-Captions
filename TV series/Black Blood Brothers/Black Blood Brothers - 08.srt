1
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:48,875
Lady Cassa, please wait!

2
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:50,750
It'll be dawn in under an hour.

3
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:52,791
I don't care. I need
to take care of this.

4
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:55,750
I'm surrounded by incompetence.
If only someone had saw fit to

5
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:58,750
contact me earlier, then I
wouldn't be in this predicament.

6
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:00,416
Surely you understand.

7
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,541
The mistress wishes to keep
you separate from this matter.

8
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:08,333
If you continue to act
with such wreckless abandon,

9
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:10,708
the mistress will take
action against you herself.

10
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,708
Why that would be splendid.

11
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:17,958
I'd love to settle things with
that old hag once and for all.

12
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:20,041
Cassa, no.

13
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:23,166
And when the time comes...

14
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,625
I expect you to be
standing there by my side.

15
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:30,208
Though I won't force you
if you really are opposed to it.

16
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,791
"I can't wait to
see Jiro again."

17
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,541
For ten years, that's
what she's been saying.

18
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:51,375
My sister Cassa.

19
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:54,000
What's the meaning of this?

20
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,666
Why did you stop him
from attacking Mimiko?

21
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,000
He was your kin, and yet you
cut him down dead in his tracks.

22
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:02,083
It was nothing special.

23
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,375
As you well know,
it is our misfortune that

24
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:06,958
everyone we bite is
turned into one of us.

25
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:10,166
Leaving him alive would
have only caused more problems.

26
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,250
Jiro. Hey...

27
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:21,083
I only did what was
in my best interest.

28
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,375
I will not fault you for it.

29
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:25,916
I am a being that
feeds on human blood.

30
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,541
So I have no
problem engaging in

31
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:30,666
horrendous acts
to ensure my survival.

32
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,708
Well that's a surprise,
coming from you.

33
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:37,250
There are few among us who are
kind enough to see it that way.

34
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:41,208
It's for the same reason that I
cut down those of your own kind.

35
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,750
The Kowloon Children are a
menace that I cannot ignore.

36
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,625
For their existence
threatens my survival.

37
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,958
That is why I
eliminate your kind.

38
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,375
Whether you have
done wrong or not,

39
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:54,208
I assure you that
I will finish you.

40
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,750
I understand.

41
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:59,625
I guess I should have expected
as much from the Kin-Killer.

42
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,541
But I'm glad you
left the sanctuary.

43
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:07,833
My siblings and I warmly welcome
your return, Lord Silver Blade.

44
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,875
You welcome the one
who hunts your kind?

45
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,916
The Kowloon Children
have always craved chaos.

46
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,708
And it's been boring not
having a worthy opponent.

47
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,375
You okay, Mimi?

48
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:24,750
And where is your
sister, Cassa, now?

49
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:26,958
She's on her way here.

50
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,916
Damn you!

51
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:40,291
Worthy opponent, my ass!
I will not play games with you!

52
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:41,750
It's no game, Silver Blade.

53
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,708
I've heard stories
about you my entire life.

54
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:46,708
I know how you fight.
I know everything about you!

55
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,875
Y'know, I didn't come here just
to track you down for my sister.

56
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:58,916
What?

57
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,041
I've come to test my skills.

58
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,208
Be careful.

59
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,958
You're not taking me seriously!

60
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,708
What's the matter, you can't
even hold your own against

61
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,791
someone as young as me?

62
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:44,208
It's the suppression team!

63
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,583
You disappoint me.

64
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:58,083
Brother!

65
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,375
Jiro, are you alright?

66
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:08,375
Sorry, Mimiko,
but this is goodbye.

67
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,666
It's not safe for
you to be with me.

68
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,458
I don't want you to get hurt.

69
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:14,791
Wait!

70
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,625
I think we should
get going, Kotaro.

71
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,875
What? But I
don't want to leave.

72
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:22,416
You have to at least tell
the Company about that guy.

73
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,875
Sorry, but after what's
happened, I have no intention

74
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:27,333
on involving myself
with the Company.

75
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,583
Brother, we can't go.

76
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:34,291
We have to stay here
at least a little longer.

77
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:37,250
I really don't want to argue
with you right now, Kotaro.

78
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,958
Now do as I say and come along.

79
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,916
Brother, please.

80
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,750
I won't discuss it any
further. We need to go now.

81
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:47,583
Okay, Okay.
I understand, that's fine.

82
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:51,333
But before we go, we should
have a talk with Sei and Cain.

83
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:57,000
I don't know how
to say this exactly...

84
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,583
But I don't think you can
protect us on your own anymore!

85
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:07,333
I agree with him.

86
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,916
Jiro, please
stay a little longer.

87
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,125
I'm so sorry, Mimiko.

88
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,291
No, don't apologize to me.

89
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,750
Just say you won't leave.

90
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:23,625
Brother.

91
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:26,333
Why would you do
something like that?

92
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,333
Jiro.

93
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,291
There's a case of
contagion in the Special Zone.

94
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,333
Not only that, but the
source of the contagion is

95
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,666
a second generation Kowloon
Child who is still at large.

96
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,291
This is the worst
possible situation.

97
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,625
The company must put
all of its resources towards

98
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:47,791
capturing the source
and eliminating

99
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,541
any further outbreak.

100
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,791
You will have
our full cooperation.

101
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:57,458
The fugitive vampire's
name is Yafuri Chao.

102
00:07:57,541 --> 00:08:00,666
It has only been ten
years since he was turned.

103
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,416
As long as the
conditions are right,

104
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,833
I believe the suppression team
can deal with him themselves.

105
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:08,875
Then why did the Silver
Blade fail to finish him?

106
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:11,625
I do not know. But more
importantly, the fact that

107
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,916
he managed to make it
into the Special Zone

108
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,916
suggests that he is working
with someone on the inside.

109
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,916
Excuse me, Sei. What are
the conditions necessary to

110
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,666
cross the barrier
into the Special Zone?

111
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,208
It's quite simple.

112
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:29,291
In order to cross the barrier
one must merely be invited.

113
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,541
And the one inviting them
must know they're a vampire.

114
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:35,666
Also, there's one more
requirement for entrance.

115
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,916
And that is?

116
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,208
The person who invites
them must be a resident,

117
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:40,916
and they must be human.

118
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,166
And exactly how is
residence determined?

119
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,416
There is no formal rule.
He must simply live upon

120
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,416
this land and
consider the Special Zone

121
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,291
to be the place
where he belongs.

122
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,708
Then if that's the case.

123
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:55,291
We have a pressing
need to find this insider.

124
00:08:56,083 --> 00:09:01,208
It was never my intention
to keep this from you, but...

125
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,791
Yafuri mentioned
an old acquaintance of

126
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:06,125
mine to the Silver Blade,
and claimed he was her brother.

127
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:10,041
Cassandra Jill
Warlock is her name.

128
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,875
She was formerly a prominent
figure in the Warlock house,

129
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,625
and I was once her servant.

130
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,625
Ten years ago,
when the source of

131
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,708
the Kowloon bloodline was born,

132
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:22,625
she was one of the first to
become tainted by their blood.

133
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,166
She is a traitor.

134
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,750
Impossible. You mean
she's still alive.

135
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:31,083
If she is involved
at all in this incident,

136
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,125
then I'm afraid that

137
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,166
the situation is
truly turning grave.

138
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,500
She has even been called the

139
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,875
second coming of
Morgan the Witch,

140
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:41,291
who is the Source Blood and
originator of our bloodline.

141
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,291
She is incredibly skilled
in the art of magic.

142
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,625
I must confess that I have a
history with this woman as well.

143
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:50,791
And, anyone else involved in
the Crusade will definitely have

144
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:54,416
some strong feelings regarding
Cassandra Jill Warlock.

145
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,375
Including Jiro.

146
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:00,916
The Silver Blade?

147
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,458
Yes.

148
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:06,708
And this boy Yafuri, even
though he is a Kowloon Child,

149
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:09,750
I don't think he will be
too much for Jiro to handle.

150
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,666
He must have been
quite unsettled at

151
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,791
the mention of Cassa's name.

152
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:17,125
That inexperienced idiot!

153
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,708
Answer me honestly, Sei.

154
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:23,833
Do you think you would
stand a chance against Cassa?

155
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,916
I do.

156
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,333
I'm relieved to
hear that, Lord Dragon.

157
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:38,583
The Special Zone was developed
as the successor of Hong Kong.

158
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:41,250
And we must now prevent it from
sharing the same fate as that

159
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:44,041
destroyed city no
matter what it takes.

160
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,125
Gentlemen!

161
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,958
We must sever the
Kowloon bloodline

162
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,500
as quickly as possible!

163
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:11,875
Yo.

164
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:16,791
Oh, it's you Yafuri. It's
good to see you. Welcome back.

165
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,250
You seem surprised I'm alive.

166
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:19,458
Want something to eat?

167
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,541
Have there been
any new developments?

168
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,500
Why, yes. Our sis has arrived.

169
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:24,916
For real?

170
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,333
Yep, she was here. And she
seems really enthusiastic.

171
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:30,541
She couldn't wait
to get things started.

172
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,916
She had an odd look in her eyes,
though. It could mean trouble.

173
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,125
Where is she?

174
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,375
She's already out
for a night on the town.

175
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,083
What do you think, Yafuri?

176
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:42,916
Here we are, working hard, and
she hasn't even lent us a hand.

177
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,291
Talk about self-centered, huh?

178
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,500
Did she say anything
when she was here?

179
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,166
Nuh-uh. Not really.

180
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,666
Oh, I see.

181
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,791
Well, she didn't seem that
mad at you for running off.

182
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,083
So go ahead and relax.

183
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:57,958
Do you not care where I was?

184
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,125
Huh?

185
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,625
I came across the
Silver Blade while I was

186
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,541
searching the Special Zone.

187
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:03,708
I know you did.

188
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,500
But how? We were
the only ones there.

189
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,250
There was a half-dead
member of the Coven

190
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:11,416
lying on the
ground. That's how.

191
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,625
I was watching
through his eyes.

192
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,000
Oh. Right.

193
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,791
You shouldn't have
approached him alone.

194
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,875
Don't ever do that again.

195
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,958
If you were watching
me then you know!

196
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,250
I had the upper hand
against the Silver Blade.

197
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:25,666
If we hadn't been interrupted,

198
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,416
I would have beaten him!

199
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,333
Why are you and sis
so hung up on that guy?

200
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,791
He didn't look
like anything special.

201
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,791
Is that jealousy in your voice?

202
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,500
What? You wanna
take this outside?

203
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:37,875
Bring it on!

204
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:43,208
Yafuri, if you had
continued your fight,

205
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:44,375
you wouldn't have been able to

206
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,625
stand against the
Silver Blade for long.

207
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,208
Just trust me on this one.

208
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,208
You don't know what
you're dealing with.

209
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:52,875
What do you know?

210
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,541
More than you think.

211
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:58,166
So try to get some rest
until the sun comes up. Okay?

212
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:04,583
Then you can start your
day by cleaning up this mess.

213
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,041
Whatever.

214
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:17,000
We can't do it.
We cannot stay here.

215
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,958
Kotaro. We're leaving.

216
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:31,083
I'm gonna go
say goodbye to Mimi.

217
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:33,833
I'll be right back,
so don't worry about me.

218
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,041
No!

219
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,750
I'm late again.

220
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,583
Jiro.

221
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,333
It's not safe for
you to be with me.

222
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,500
I don't want you to get hurt.

223
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,625
Jiro!

224
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:26,416
Oh, Miss Mimiko. Did I
wake you up? I'm so sorry.

225
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,625
No, it's okay.

226
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,458
The Chief gave me
a message for you.

227
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,458
He said you could
take the day off.

228
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:36,375
I guess you've been
serving in a critical capacity.

229
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,500
He said your hard
work is much appreciated.

230
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,875
I don't know what the
Chief is talking about.

231
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,625
Doesn't he know that I failed
to accomplish my mission?

232
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,333
He didn't mention it.

233
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,458
So you shouldn't be upset
with yourself about it.

234
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,875
Besides, that's just
par for the course for you.

235
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,166
How dare you!

236
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,291
Whoops. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

237
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,541
Miss Mimiko...

238
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:02,083
Cheer up. There's no reason
for you to be sad. Not really.

239
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,333
It's all the Silver
Blade's fault anyway!

240
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,916
That darn Silver Blade. How
could he just dump you like that

241
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,500
after you
helped him out so much

242
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,458
and got him into
the Special Zone.

243
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,541
And on top of that.
He brings you to

244
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:15,208
a hotel like
you're some floozy!

245
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,000
You so deserve better!

246
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,291
Huh?

247
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:22,500
Oh, but hey it's okay. You don't
have anything to worry about

248
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:25,416
because yesterday I checked
the regulations for you.

249
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,416
If a compromiser allows a
Black Blood to drink her blood,

250
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,541
she will be
severely punished.

251
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:33,166
But it's okay if she's
assaulted against her will!

252
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,416
Wait. Hibari, what
are you talking about?

253
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,541
What exactly did the
Chief tell you anyway?

254
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:40,833
He didn't tell me
anything. But I can sense it!

255
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,791
So today to help you relax
I'm going to take you to

256
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,000
the Seventh Yard
and we're gonna party!

257
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,708
Oh, but before we take off,

258
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:50,375
I think that you should
maybe go to the hospital.

259
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,416
You little freak!

260
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,958
Huh?

261
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:57,708
Nothing like that happened! If
I ever hear you say it did,

262
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,000
you will regret it.
You understand me?!

263
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,541
No way. Seriously? Nothing?

264
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:04,291
You seem so disappointed.

265
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,125
Well, when the Chief
talked to me earlier he seemed

266
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,916
really concerned about you.

267
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,083
He wanted me to come and
make sure you were okay.

268
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,250
He said, "Mimiko's at
the hotel and she's really

269
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,916
depressed, so go
cheer her up."

270
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,500
And when I heard that
I just assumed--

271
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:16,583
Assumed what?

272
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:19,125
Oh. Uh, it's nothing.

273
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,791
Then I guess I had it all
wrong about the Silver Blade.

274
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,541
Maybe he's not
so bad after all.

275
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,458
That woman must have
been telling me the truth.

276
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:26,833
I guess I should have listened.

277
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,208
And who was that?

278
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:31,166
Oooh some lady.
She's downstairs waiting.

279
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:33,958
Who's there?

280
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,541
Oh, you should have
waited in the lobby for us.

281
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,125
We were about to leave.

282
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:44,125
I'm sorry. I just got worried
when you hadn't come down yet.

283
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:47,250
Hey, Mimiko.

284
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,250
Wong, it's you!

285
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,291
Where are you, Kotaro?

286
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,166
And you're just
gonna let him go?

287
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,333
From what you've
told me, it seems like

288
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,833
the Special Zone
really needs him.

289
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:21,375
And isn't it your
job to try and find him?

290
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:22,541
But, I--

291
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:23,666
She can't.

292
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,958
It's too dangerous.

293
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:28,208
I wasn't asking you,
I was asking Mimiko!

294
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:31,000
I wanna know how you
honestly feel about this.

295
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,083
Tell me, are you
really okay with

296
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:36,125
the Silver Blade
just leaving you?

297
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,041
Miss Mimiko?

298
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,666
I'll do it.
I'll try to find Jiro

299
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,083
and see if I can
talk him out of leaving.

300
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,375
But how? How are
you going to find him?

301
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:47,916
He could be anywhere,
and there's no way you can

302
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,791
search the Special
Zone by yourself.

303
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:52,083
If the Silver Blade
is going after Yafuri,

304
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,250
I have an idea of
where he might be.

305
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,875
Tsang told me about him.

306
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:58,750
Evidently he has friends
in the Eleventh Yard.

307
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,041
What's the matter?

308
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:02,458
It's just that...

309
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,041
Did Tsang not tell you?

310
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:07,166
The Eleventh Yard is an urban
legend here in the Special Zone.

311
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,708
It's what?

312
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,416
There are only ten official
districts on record in the city.

313
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,125
So, the Eleventh Yard doesn't
really exist as far as I know.

314
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,333
It doesn't exist?

315
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,458
No.

316
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,708
After the Hong Kong crusade
there were stories that

317
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:23,375
some kind of legacy was
brought in to the Special Zone,

318
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,541
which was still under
development at the time.

319
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:28,458
And this legacy is said to be
hidden in the Eleventh Yard.

320
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:31,000
A district that
no one was ever seen.

321
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,958
I never heard that story.

322
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,791
Anyway even without any clues,

323
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,375
I'm sure I'll be
able to find Jiro.

324
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:40,791
Um, I know someone who's
researching the Eleventh Yard.

325
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:41,625
What?

326
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:42,875
Who's that?

327
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:45,208
An information broker's
been coming to see me.

328
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,875
And he's been asking a
lot of questions about it.

329
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:51,291
He comes by every so often
and we exchange information.

330
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,791
Now then, what should I eat?

331
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,916
Call the affiliate houses and
gather information from them.

332
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,500
We need clues to whereabouts of

333
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:21,375
the Kowloon Child
before it's too late.

334
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:25,458
Damn it! Things
are moving too slow!

335
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,916
And Cassandra is
always, always so...

336
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,333
I'm looking for my brother.

337
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:42,083
And why have you come here?
I don't know where he is.

338
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,083
I can't sense his aura
and I'm afraid something

339
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,916
may have happened to him.

340
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:51,458
You idiot! Why didn't you
finish those Kowloon off?

341
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,000
Because of you they might
spread throughout the city.

342
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:57,291
Please help me. Even the
smallest bit of information.

343
00:19:57,375 --> 00:20:00,333
I'm begging you. Please
help me find my brother.

344
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:03,666
Do you realize how dire the
situation is at the moment?!

345
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,833
You really
think we have time to

346
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:07,458
concern ourselves
with one child?!

347
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,333
Where are you going?

348
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,708
To look for Kotaro.

349
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:17,541
How? He's severed your
empathetic link, hasn't he?

350
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,666
I don't know how,
but I will find him.

351
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,333
So you can either help
me out or just shut up

352
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,333
and keep your
people out of my way.

353
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,625
You're behaving rashly.
Just calm down.

354
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,166
Calm down?!

355
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:31,833
I can't. Cassa could find my
little brother at any moment!

356
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:34,333
Damn it. If you're
not gonna help me,

357
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:37,916
then stop meddling in
the affairs of my bloodline.

358
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,458
Jiro!

359
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,083
Get up.

360
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:02,166
And you call yourself the chosen
protector of the Lady Sage?

361
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,958
Listen. The Special Zone has
been in grave danger as of late.

362
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:09,583
And I assure you that the enemy
is not after you or your kin.

363
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,916
You arrived in the Special
Zone only two days ago,

364
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,458
but this plan of theirs has
been meticulously devised

365
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,916
over a long period of time.

366
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,625
Then why? Why has Cassa
come to the Special Zone?

367
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:25,958
I'm afraid I
can't tell you that.

368
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:29,375
At any rate, now that the enemy
is aware of your presence here,

369
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:31,166
there is no guarantee
that they won't start to

370
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,750
cause problems for
you and your brother.

371
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,750
Go to the park
we were at yesterday.

372
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,541
I'll send Rinsuke to meet you.

373
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:40,458
He may not be of much help,

374
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:42,791
but he's the only person
I can afford to send.

375
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:46,458
At the very least, he knows the
Special Zone better than you do.

376
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:47,708
Thank you.

377
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,416
Save it. We really don't
have time for that now,

378
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,041
so just get out of here.

379
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,291
That boy will never grow up.

380
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,291
What have you found?

381
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:07,291
We've discovered their hideout.

382
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:08,791
I'll be right there.

383
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,750
Everything is falling apart.

384
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,625
But in a way
it's coming together.

385
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:03,583
Then what are they after?
Cain said the same thing.

386
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:06,041
He said Cassa wasn't after us.

387
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:07,875
Then what is their objective?

388
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:10,916
Why would they risk so much
entering the Special Zone?

389
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:15,375
