1
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:40,625
It's incredible! Like
nothing humanity has ever seen!

2
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:43,750
Vampires are completely
destroying the city!

3
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:46,041
News crews have been barred
from entering the hot zone,

4
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:48,375
so we're limited
in what we can show you.

5
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:49,791
What is obvious is that

6
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:52,375
the city's functioning
capabilities are dead.

7
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:54,208
We have reports
that citizens left behind

8
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:55,791
are rioting in the streets!

9
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:58,958
This entire city
has become a battlefield.

10
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:00,125
We are witnessing with our

11
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:02,791
own eyes a sacred
war between humans and--

12
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,333
Here they come.

13
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:44,416
The rumor we heard that

14
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,625
Walkerman aided
them seems to be true...

15
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,041
Which is a little unsettling.

16
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,208
It is.

17
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:51,875
How many?

18
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,541
Too many.

19
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:03,708
You're not going anywhere...

20
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,375
Stay here and
guard the Lord Dragon.

21
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,791
Did you even hear
what I just said to you...?!

22
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,458
You're going nowhere!

23
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:15,083
My strengths are better
suited to this than yours are.

24
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,791
While you may possess
the power that rivals that of

25
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:21,333
a source blood... now is not the
time to deviate from our plan.

26
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:28,583
Lord Dragon...
open the barrier.

27
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:29,916
You insolent bastard!

28
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,083
Do you have any idea
who you're talking to?!

29
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,458
It's fine.

30
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:34,916
But Lord Dragon...

31
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,541
Jiro... If you kill them,

32
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,625
it will not save
you from your grief.

33
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:49,708
I'm begging you...
I need... I need to do this.

34
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,750
Very well then.

35
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,583
You have my thanks. 

36
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,041
Lord Dragon...

37
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:17,291
Cain, please... I would
expect you to empathize with

38
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:20,333
the sorrow of losing,
what you strived to protect.

39
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,625
Silver Blade...

40
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:23,375
In this world, there's no
such thing as something useless.

41
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,416
It's good to see you, Jiro.

42
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,208
Stop it.

43
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,666
You always were troublesome...

44
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,875
Once you get worked up,

45
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,500
there's practically
no way to hold you back.

46
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,666
I said stop it!

47
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:22,583
Long time no see... I hope
you've been doing well...

48
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,750
But from the looks
of you, that's not the case.

49
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,541
You bitch... You bitch!

50
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:30,041
You bitch, you bitch...
you bitch!

51
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:33,875
Oh... Come on...
You can't say my name?

52
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:36,416
It's been a long time
since I've teased you.

53
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,333
You know... It's kinda funny.

54
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,250
When she first chose
you to be her guardian,

55
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,500
I thought it was foolish.
I guess I was right.

56
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,208
But you know
what's even funnier?

57
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:48,958
In the vast expanse of time
since we last saw each other...

58
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,541
I've learned that
I've never been happier than

59
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:54,333
in the days I spent
with the two of you.

60
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:59,541
Amazing isn't it? I cherish that
time in my life so very much...

61
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:02,083
Both then... and now.

62
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,500
Then why did
you betray us?! Why?!

63
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:11,166
Times change, Jiro... She said
it herself, remember...?

64
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,125
Just accept it.

65
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:14,750
Shut your mouth!

66
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:24,541
That was unreal, Jiro...!
You gave me the chills...!

67
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,916
But alas...
we'll have to stop here.

68
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,541
I would have enjoyed introducing
you to my new family, but

69
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:32,541
that will have to wait...
for another time.

70
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,500
Your family?!

71
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:38,625
That's right. Oh, I know you
hate the The Kowloon Children,

72
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,791
but I think
they're just so cute.

73
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,958
Stop talking!

74
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:54,833
That was careless.
So long, Jiro.

75
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,500
Cassa, wait!

76
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,666
No need to
bother missing me now...

77
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:02,333
Because today is only the
beginning of the whole thing.

78
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:06,500
Both ceaseless lamentation
and overflowing jubilation.

79
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:09,833
It's all laid out before us.

80
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:18,000
Cassa!

81
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:35,416
Tired yet?

82
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,750
No, but I'm getting there.

83
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,208
Well, we're almost there.

84
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:41,000
Yup... Looks like we'll
be in Yokohama by sunup...

85
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,750
I guess I'll
leave the bridge to you.

86
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,000
Sure. Get some rest.

87
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,291
Right.

88
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,416
Hey, brother?

89
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,250
Brother!

90
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,666
I think we're
still on the ocean...

91
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,833
I thought we'd be there by now?

92
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,083
Oh, great 

93
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:56,833
Wake up, brother...
Wake up brother.

94
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:04,083
Wake up brother! Wake up, wake
up brother! Wake up brother!

95
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:07,416
Wake up brother! Wake up
brother! Wake up brother!

96
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:13,333
Wake up brother! Wake up
brother! Wake up brother!

97
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:15,416
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

98
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,458
Wake up brother!
Wake up brother!

99
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:22,416
Wake-- Oh you're up.

100
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,500
That wasn't nice.

101
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:47,708
I forgot that you don't like
ships... Being on water and all.

102
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,291
Hey, brother... I think
I'm gonna wander around outside

103
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,291
and explore some.

104
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,541
Listen to me, Kotaro.

105
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:57,791
I need you to be
good and stay asleep

106
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,333
until we reach the harbor.

107
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:02,375
Remember, we're stowaways.
Not guests.

108
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:10,833
But... He's asleep...
How would he know anyway?

109
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,125
Sleep well!

110
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,666
Sorry, but... Who are you?

111
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,125
Chan.

112
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:55,875
Nice to meet you, Chan...
I'm Kotaro Mochizuki.

113
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,916
I forgot. It's supposed
to be a secret that

114
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,125
I'm traveling on this ship.

115
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,208
So... would you
mind not telling anyone?

116
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:03,458
Sure!

117
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:06,125
Thanks a lot, Chan...
And in return I'll...

118
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,458
I'll let you look
at the picture I drew.

119
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:14,416
What...? Uh, Chan...? Chan!

120
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:16,958
Chan!

121
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:31,333
Hey, Chan? Where'd you go?

122
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,583
That's awesome!

123
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,416
There they are!

124
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:40,625
They found me.

125
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:46,416
I can't believe
they actually shot at me.

126
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,541
What are they
gonna do now that

127
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,958
they know there're
stowaways on board?

128
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,541
Return fire!

129
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:57,541
Spread out men!
Don't give them a target!

130
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:03,791
Wait a sec...
They're not coming after me...

131
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,750
Damn it all! They brought
sunlamps with them!

132
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:18,083
If the sunlight is hurting
those people on the boat,

133
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,208
then that must
mean that they're like us.

134
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:21,541
Hey, kid--

135
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,458
What are you
doing out here alone?!

136
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:28,208
I apologize sir!

137
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,500
It can't be, Are you the...

138
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:37,291
Wait, um,... Have we
met somewhere before mister?

139
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:40,333
I guess that's silly,
huh? I'm sorry.

140
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,916
No, it's... it's fine I...

141
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,125
This is it.

142
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:03,000
That's my brother...
He's awake now.

143
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,416
Open fire, men!

144
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,541
A good morning
to you gentlemen.

145
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:49,291
I trust that, everyone
is doing splendidly today.

146
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,083
Hi, brother!

147
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:56,125
Oh... Kotaro...
Good morning to you...

148
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:57,625
Gorgeous night
don't you think?

149
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:58,916
Yeah!

150
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:04,791
Incidentally... I was curious as
to what you were doing up here.

151
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:07,916
Oh, yeah... That.

152
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,750
Your brother...

153
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:16,625
Ow, that hurt!

154
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,291
...was firm...

155
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,000
...when he told you...

156
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:25,583
To be good... and stay
asleep... until we arrived.

157
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,083
I only hope you didn't
wander around the ship...

158
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:32,458
And get into any more
trouble than you already are.

159
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:33,916
Like what, brother?

160
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,375
Like marking up any surface
you please with graffiti.

161
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,458
Whoa... How'd you know that?

162
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,083
I guess since
this is a Chinese ship,

163
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,458
I should've drawn
a panda bear instead.

164
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,583
That's hardly the point.

165
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,666
I'm really sorry.

166
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,708
Tell me... Why do
you always have to do

167
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:54,500
dumb things like this...?
You're such a pain.

168
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:57,458
That was mean tricking me into
thinking you weren't mad at me.

169
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:58,958
I don't want to hear it.

170
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,291
You're the one who couldn't
just do what he was told...

171
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,875
And now you turn around
and blame your brother...

172
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:02,916
It's disgraceful.

173
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,250
Fine.

174
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,458
Good grief brother.

175
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,083
Pardon me, gentlemen...

176
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,666
I'm sorry that you
had to witness that.

177
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,708
Please do you
best to not mind us.

178
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,083
And now...
since we've been able to

179
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,208
set aside
this private matter...

180
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,791
perhaps someone can tell
me what this fight is about...

181
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,666
See, while I don't
understand your reasons,

182
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,833
I take it that the ship itself
is not part of the conflict...

183
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:35,041
So all of the noise
wasn't appreciated.

184
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,333
Just who the hell
do you think you are?!

185
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,833
If you wish to ask my name,
I suggest that you start by

186
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,625
introducing yourself first.

187
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:44,625
Or have, such simple courtesies
been surrendered to the will of

188
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:47,375
disrespect during
my absence from Japan?

189
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:49,625
Alright then...

190
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,875
We're the suppression
team for the Company.

191
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,541
The company... Certainly
you must be referring to

192
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:57,541
the Order Coffin Company
from the Special Zone.

193
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:58,666
Yeah.

194
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,958
That's quite odd... I was
under the impression it's

195
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,541
an organization serving
as an intermediary between

196
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:06,875
the humans and us.

197
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,625
Ostensibly, yes.

198
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,500
Oh.

199
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:13,041
But this is how they
operate behind the scenes.

200
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:16,208
They seek out our brethren, only
to murder us indiscriminately...

201
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,416
They're nothing
but homicidal maniacs.

202
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,500
Homicidal...? I assure you we
don't go around killing humans.

203
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,416
You bastard!

204
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,875
Allow me to set you
straight on one more point.

205
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,125
Word is out there that the
Special Zone is considered as

206
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,166
some kind of haven
for you sick suckers,

207
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,333
which is a very
misguided perception.

208
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,541
The city that we guard is
not a lawless district that

209
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:36,958
we've let the monsters rule...

210
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,916
It's carefully maintained
location and strict order

211
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,291
is active twenty-four/seven.
Illegal immigrants from

212
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:45,375
some unknown bloodline
would never be allowed inside.

213
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:48,833
However, if you have a valid
referral from an affiliate house

214
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:50,541
then you don't
have any worries...

215
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:53,083
The Special Zone
will accept you...

216
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:54,333
But if you do not...

217
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,291
it doesn't matter if
you're an Old Blood with

218
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,041
hundreds of
years under your belt...

219
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,083
we'll show you no mercy.

220
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:03,375
That's the reality
for a Black Blood.

221
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,916
Reality for a
Black Blood... Ah...

222
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,875
I have been hearing that this
is what they've been calling

223
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,791
vampires these days...
And it's true...

224
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:14,541
My little brother and
I are, in fact, vampires.

225
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,250
This is quite a conundrum...

226
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,375
I have associates
in the Special Zone,

227
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,250
but I am afraid
I am unfamiliar to

228
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,833
this concept of
"affiliate houses".

229
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,291
Really?

230
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,333
That's too bad for you.

231
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:29,541
I don't think so.

232
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,125
Give him backup! All of you!

233
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,375
Are you serious??!
Do you even who that guy is?!

234
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,625
It doesn't matter
who he is, damn it...!

235
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,458
What matters is that
with him we can win...!

236
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:43,500
Or have you given
up on the Special Zone?!

237
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,791
No matter how
many times I explain...

238
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,250
you just don't understand.

239
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,333
What kind of power is that?!

240
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,916
This is bad...

241
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,500
Dammit!

242
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:48,250
 Was he bitten?

243
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,458
Yes, sir. But
thankfully he wasn't

244
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,375
bitten by a Kowloon Child.

245
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,000
What'd headquarters say?

246
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,750
They said they'll handle it.

247
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:02,916
But you might wanna strap in
for a big slap on the wrists.

248
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,041
First you open fire,
big time, on a ship,

249
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,750
and the whole thing explodes.

250
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:09,541
Not something you can
just cover up that easily.

251
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,166
That's the Intelligence
Department's problem.

252
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,291
As soon as we're back
at base I want everyone

253
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,875
suited up with
anti-Old Blood equipment...

254
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,291
We've got a zero percent
chance of rain tomorrow...

255
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,958
and a full moon on the
docket for tomorrow night...

256
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,291
We've got to settle
this thing by sundown

257
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:25,916
no matter what the costs.

258
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,958
What's bothering you, Wong?

259
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:39,708
That guy... It's obvious, that
he was one of the Old Blood...

260
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:42,833
But there was something
unusual about him...

261
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,750
With the right motivation maybe
he could have been our ally.

262
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:46,750
Right.

263
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,541
Miss Wong!

264
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,250
I'm begging you!

265
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,916
Please give her your blood...!
She's dying...!

266
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,625
If she becomes a
vampire like you then

267
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:06,291
she can be free
of death, right?!

268
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:11,000
Thank you! Thank you,
you've saved my little girl!

269
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:13,833
I will never forget this!

270
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,000
I don't understand
why we got off the ship.

271
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,750
It's just a little change
of plans, that's all...

272
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:23,416
By tomorrow... well...
the day after tomorrow,

273
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,333
we'll be arriving
in the Special Zone.

274
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:26,500
We will?!

275
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:27,958
Yes... Of course we will.

276
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:31,583
Alright... I'm hungry again.

277
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:35,083
It's amazing... Chan,
You're such a little glutton.

278
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:49,416
Kotaro...

279
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:10,958
Hello...? This is Katsuragi.

280
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:12,791
Mimiko, it's Jinnai.

281
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,583
Hey Chief...

282
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,708
What's got you calling
me this early in the morning?

283
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,833
What?! Now? Wait, I can't
hear you, you're breaking up.

284
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:26,083
Chief, where are
you calling me from?

285
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:01,541
In order to be clear
when we talk of our two races

286
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:04,916
we call your kind Black Bloods
and we call our kind Red Bloods.

287
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,333
It shows equality between
two races of sentient beings,

288
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:10,708
that were equal
as living creatures.

289
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,708
Next time: "Compromiser"
