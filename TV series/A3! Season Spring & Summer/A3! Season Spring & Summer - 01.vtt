My heart won't stop pounding.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.184 position:50% align:center
Ever since that day, this
is where I've wanted to be.

00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:22.772 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
Up on stage--

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:25.775 position:50% align:center
a sacred space for actors
and performers--

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.861 position:50% align:center
I'll have to swallow my nerves.

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:30.321 position:50% align:center

As the curtain rises,

00:00:33.783 --> 00:00:38.121 position:50% align:center
I feel a tiny bud
inside me opening up!

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:39.914 position:50% align:center
I want to laugh out loud!

00:00:39.998 --> 00:00:42.250 position:50% align:center
I want to shout till
I'm totally hoarse!

00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:46.963 position:50% align:center
And I want my performance
to be honest and truthful!

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:51.134 position:50% align:center
This is it.
This is where I belong.

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:54.346 position:50% align:center
Yes, the show must go on.

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:58.975 position:50% align:center
And that bud inside me...
can finally bloom!

[SAKUYA]
Thou seest.

00:01:13.782 --> 00:01:16.076 position:50% align:center
We are not all alone unhappy.

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.788 position:50% align:center

the scene wherein we play in.

00:01:24.668 --> 00:01:27.754 position:50% align:center
"The scene wherein we play in?"
Is that right?

00:01:27.837 --> 00:01:30.965 position:50% align:center
Crap, where was I? Oh, yeah,
"All the world's a stage."

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.637 position:50% align:center
All the world is a stage and
the men and women are players.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.722 position:50% align:center
They have their...
What do they have?

00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:40.642 position:50% align:center
Oh, right! "They have their
exits and entrances,

Just tell me the truth!

I do have a terminal
illness, don't I?

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:11.673 position:50% align:center
Cool, I love street acts!

00:02:11.756 --> 00:02:13.425 position:50% align:center
That's not true!

00:02:13.508 --> 00:02:15.844 position:50% align:center
Please don't lie to me.

00:02:15.927 --> 00:02:18.471 position:50% align:center
I saw.

00:02:18.555 --> 00:02:21.057 position:50% align:center
I saw you talking

It's my life! Tell me so
I know what I'm facing!

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:33.069 position:50% align:center
We'll attract attention here.
Let's go inside.

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:34.571 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

Actually, yeah,
we should be soon.

00:02:51.212 --> 00:02:52.297 position:50% align:center
[HARUTO]
Any experience?

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.674 position:50% align:center
No, unfortunately,
I don't have much.

00:02:54.758 --> 00:02:56.843 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, do you guys
have dorms there?

00:02:56.926 --> 00:03:00.430 position:50% align:center
Uh... No, I wish we did,
but we don't yet.

00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:01.514 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU]
Oh, gotcha.

00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:04.392 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
Um.

00:03:04.476 --> 00:03:06.519 position:50% align:center
If you're looking for a
dorm, I think I can help!

But please check out

[TSUZURU gasping]

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:19.783 position:50% align:center
[HARUTO] The heck was that
about? Mankai Company?

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:26.956 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
I think this is the place.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.125 position:50% align:center
The building looks like
it has some history.

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.127 position:50% align:center
Uh, love that.

Dad...

[FURUICHI] Excuse me. You've got
business at this theater?

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.935 position:50% align:center
Oh, are you the one
who sent the letter--

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:48.061 position:50% align:center
Well?!

00:03:48.144 --> 00:03:50.814 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI screams]
Dad, what's going on?

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:53.233 position:50% align:center
You don't owe this guy money
or something, do you?

00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:55.026 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Wait, it's you.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.611 position:50% align:center
Nope, not me!

00:03:56.695 --> 00:03:58.863 position:50% align:center
I definitely didn't receive a
letter or anything like that!

00:03:58.947 --> 00:04:00.281 position:50% align:center
I'm just Passerby A!

00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:02.283 position:50% align:center
[laughs nervously]

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:04.994 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI] Then I suggest you
keep walking, miss.

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:07.288 position:50% align:center
Unless you happen
to like danger.

00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:10.083 position:50% align:center

Huh? Danger?

00:04:14.295 --> 00:04:17.173 position:50% align:center

Look at my backhoe!
Go, baby, go!

00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:25.056 position:50% align:center
[SAKODA] Hey, Boss!
Can I bust it up now?

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.391 position:50% align:center
Yes, do it, Sakoda.

00:04:26.474 --> 00:04:29.394 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE]
No, I'm begging you, please!

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:34.816 position:50% align:center
But just take the sign down.

00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:36.818 position:50% align:center
I'm planning on turning
the building into a bar.

00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:38.945 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE]
Don't pretend you can't hear me!

00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:42.407 position:50% align:center
Uh. Wait, what are you doing?

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.993 position:50% align:center
Ma'am, I warned you it
would be dangerous here.

00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:47.537 position:50% align:center
Please, Furuichi!
You don't have to do this!

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.622 position:50% align:center
Look, I told you I'd
repurpose the place

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:51.541 position:50% align:center
if you couldn't pay the
debt off, remember that?

00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:52.417 position:50% align:center
It's time.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.877 position:50% align:center
But we're about to start a show!

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.547 position:50% align:center
If we make money, I can at
least pay off some interest!

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.174 position:50% align:center
Sakoda, you can stand down.

00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:01.426 position:50% align:center
You're the boss, Boss!

00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:04.888 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:05.805 position:50% align:center

Any presale?

00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:09.434 position:50% align:center
Not a one, sir!

00:05:09.517 --> 00:05:10.602 position:50% align:center

--None, sir!
--And when's showtime?

00:05:12.228 --> 00:05:14.272 position:50% align:center
In three minutes, sir!

[FURUICHI]
Sakoda, it's all yours.

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:20.987 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE] No, please, wait, it's
our newest member's debut show!

00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:24.115 position:50% align:center
That's just tragic!
We got no place else to go!

[ISUKE]
Don't you get it?

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.952 position:50% align:center
Every actor remembers
their debut!

00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:30.163 position:50% align:center
I mean, how sad would it be
to tear down the theater

00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:31.831 position:50% align:center
right before he's
supposed to go on?

00:05:31.915 --> 00:05:33.917 position:50% align:center
You have zero audience.
You call that a show?

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.796 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
But I'm here! Um.

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:39.673 position:50% align:center

Hope you don't regret this.

00:05:50.892 --> 00:05:52.894 position:50% align:center

It's my first year
in high school!

00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:34.060 position:50% align:center
I have a huge crush on this
beautiful girl in my class!

Oh, no! I'm gonna be
late to school!

Guess I better get going, now!

00:06:38.314 --> 00:06:40.400 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] I'm guessing
he's the new member.

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:42.360 position:50% align:center
But where are the other--

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:48.158 position:50% align:center
Hey, wait up, Romeo.
How 'bout you take me with ya?

Wait, there's a parrot?

like that is nothing

compared to the happiness
I feel in this moment!

00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:05.717 position:50% align:center
Although, I would definitely
be a lot happier

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.552 position:50% align:center
if she decided to like me back!

[IZUMI]
Nothing discourages this guy.

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:14.934 position:50% align:center
Looks like he's elated just
to be up there on the stage.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.355 position:50% align:center
Oh! How wonderful!

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:21.316 position:50% align:center

at the castle after all!

[GIRL A whispers]
To the ball!

00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:23.777 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

My first play was fun, too.

00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:33.745 position:50% align:center
I was so immersed it was
over before I knew it.

00:07:33.828 --> 00:07:37.332 position:50% align:center
It seems like forever ago,
but I was so happy.

being here today!

[IZUMI]
Uh?

00:07:55.892 --> 00:07:56.893 position:50% align:center
Demolition time.

00:07:58.228 --> 00:07:59.729 position:50% align:center
Seriously?!

00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:02.190 position:50% align:center
Only a monster could say that
after seeing how hard he worked!

[FURUICHI]
How hard he worked?

00:08:03.775 --> 00:08:06.486 position:50% align:center
Absolutely! He just got up
there and acted his butt off!

[FURUICHI]
You think this is a school play?

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:11.700 position:50% align:center
Where kids get to show off
that they can memorize lines?

00:08:11.783 --> 00:08:13.034 position:50% align:center
This is a business.

00:08:13.118 --> 00:08:16.287 position:50% align:center
These are professionals
being paid to entertain.

00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:18.790 position:50% align:center
You're not wrong. That's fair.

00:08:18.873 --> 00:08:20.291 position:50% align:center
Someday, if he keeps trying--

00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:23.962 position:50% align:center
In this world, it takes more
than hard work to succeed!

00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:28.508 position:50% align:center
[STAGE DIRECTOR A] It's not
going to matter how much you

00:08:28.591 --> 00:08:33.638 position:50% align:center
practice. The fact is,
you have no acting talent.

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:39.144 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
This troupe is being shut down.

00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:41.104 position:50% align:center
End of discussion.

00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:42.939 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
Wait, please!

00:08:43.023 --> 00:08:46.776 position:50% align:center
So, we really won't have
this place anymore?

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.028 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
That's correct.

00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:50.739 position:50% align:center
Well, that just sucks,
I only joined yesterday!

00:08:50.822 --> 00:08:52.991 position:50% align:center
Which you prob'ly
guessed from watching.

00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:56.494 position:50% align:center
I'm still not any good at acting
yet, but I love theatre,

00:08:56.578 --> 00:08:58.788 position:50% align:center
please don't tear this down!

00:08:58.872 --> 00:09:01.124 position:50% align:center
Aw, that's so sad.

00:09:04.961 --> 00:09:06.713 position:50% align:center
That's it?

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:09.966 position:50% align:center
[exhales]

00:09:14.346 --> 00:09:15.847 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:21.478 --> 00:09:24.856 position:50% align:center
No way. The show must go on.

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:32.030 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
Please, wait!

00:09:32.113 --> 00:09:34.032 position:50% align:center
I'm begging you from
the bottom of my heart!

00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:35.867 position:50% align:center
I really need this place!

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:37.660 position:50% align:center
I've already decided.

00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:39.496 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE]
I won't let you!

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:40.372 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
Manager.

00:09:40.455 --> 00:09:41.831 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, sir,

00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:44.125 position:50% align:center
but I'm determined to protect
this space at all costs!

00:09:44.209 --> 00:09:47.629 position:50% align:center
Matsukawa. I have given you
more than enough chances.

00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:48.672 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE]
But--

00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:50.924 position:50% align:center
There's no more room
for negotiation.

00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:55.595 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE] But there's still a
chance things'll turn around.

00:09:56.971 --> 00:09:58.682 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
In your dreams.

00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:04.062 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE]
Where is Yukio?

00:10:04.145 --> 00:10:07.190 position:50% align:center
I wish he'd come back and
make it like the old days.

00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:09.109 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
By Yukio.

00:10:12.404 --> 00:10:17.826 position:50% align:center
Do you mean my dad?
Sorry, I mean, Yukio Tachibana?

00:10:17.909 --> 00:10:22.080 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE] Hold on. Are you
actually Yukio's daughter?

00:10:23.164 --> 00:10:24.833 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE]
Hey, that's the letter I sent!

00:10:24.916 --> 00:10:26.835 position:50% align:center
But, where's Yukio?

00:10:26.918 --> 00:10:29.254 position:50% align:center
Well, to be blunt, I haven't
seen him for eight years,

00:10:29.337 --> 00:10:32.090 position:50% align:center
nor have I even heard from
him once during that time.

00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:34.217 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE]
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.220 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI] You continue to reach
and you've still got nothing.

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:39.681 position:50% align:center
You know, there's no need
to be so rude about it!

00:10:39.764 --> 00:10:42.392 position:50% align:center
I mean, who knows, there might
be another way to fix this!

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:44.394 position:50% align:center
The fact that you just
said that tells me

00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:46.438 position:50% align:center
that you know nothing
about this theater.

00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:51.109 position:50% align:center
Believe it or not, this space is
used exclusively for one troupe.

00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:52.736 position:50% align:center
Most small theatre companies

00:10:52.819 --> 00:10:55.196 position:50% align:center
have to rent venues
for their productions.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.656 position:50% align:center
But not this one.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.867 position:50% align:center
Combined with the costs of
maintaining company housing,

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:01.494 position:50% align:center
the funds needed to keep
this place up are steep.

00:11:01.578 --> 00:11:03.788 position:50% align:center
In its prime, until about
eight years ago,

00:11:03.872 --> 00:11:06.374 position:50% align:center
the company brought in revenue
by having seasonal troupes

00:11:06.458 --> 00:11:07.667 position:50% align:center
perform year-round called

00:11:07.751 --> 00:11:10.754 position:50% align:center
Spring, Summer,
Autumn, and Winter.

00:11:10.837 --> 00:11:13.048 position:50% align:center
It's clear that this
theatre can't stay afloat

00:11:13.131 --> 00:11:14.466 position:50% align:center
unless it has the extra revenue

00:11:14.549 --> 00:11:16.843 position:50% align:center
from those groups
performing constantly.

00:11:16.926 --> 00:11:19.095 position:50% align:center
A troupe of pros
might pull it off.

00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:20.638 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:20.722 --> 00:11:24.476 position:50% align:center
But all we have here is some
dabbler who joined yesterday.

00:11:26.061 --> 00:11:28.021 position:50% align:center
--[FURUICHI] Sakoda!
--[SAKODA] Wha-- Sir?

00:11:28.104 --> 00:11:29.606 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
Do it.

00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:36.321 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:40.742 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI screams]

00:11:40.825 --> 00:11:41.743 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:11:41.826 --> 00:11:42.660 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
What?

00:11:42.744 --> 00:11:44.245 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
I remembered something!

00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:45.663 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE]
Remembered what?

00:11:45.747 --> 00:11:47.165 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Well, I hadn't thought
about this in forever,

00:11:47.248 --> 00:11:49.250 position:50% align:center
but the truth is,
my dad officially left me

00:11:49.334 --> 00:11:51.711 position:50% align:center
the company if anything
ever happened to him so...

00:11:51.795 --> 00:11:53.463 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE]
He did?

00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:56.091 position:50% align:center
You said we would need
to form four sub-troupes.

00:11:56.174 --> 00:11:57.133 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
Well, yes.

00:11:57.217 --> 00:11:59.636 position:50% align:center
Awesome, that seems
totally doable!

00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:02.681 position:50% align:center
I just need to go recruit some
more company members!

00:12:02.764 --> 00:12:04.015 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
How many?

00:12:04.099 --> 00:12:08.186 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Uh. I know two I
can get right off the bat!

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:10.313 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
You have until sundown.

00:12:10.397 --> 00:12:14.651 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, demolition's at dusk.
Go ahead.

00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:16.569 position:50% align:center
See if you can bring
back two new members.

00:12:16.653 --> 00:12:18.113 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA, ISUKE gasp]

00:12:18.196 --> 00:12:20.365 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI] If you fail, don't
you dare grovel to me again.

00:12:20.448 --> 00:12:23.535 position:50% align:center
Right! I understand!
Let's go, you two.

00:12:23.618 --> 00:12:25.370 position:50% align:center
--[SAKUYA] Yes, ma'am!
--[ISUKE] You're the boss!

00:12:25.453 --> 00:12:27.622 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:12:27.706 --> 00:12:30.917 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
That was some sub-par acting.

00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:34.295 position:50% align:center
Nothing like Yukio.
Nothing at all.

00:12:36.006 --> 00:12:39.551 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE] What? Are you telling me
you were lying to us earlier?

00:12:39.634 --> 00:12:42.345 position:50% align:center
You were in a pinch and I
wasn't lying, I was acting!

00:12:42.429 --> 00:12:44.305 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE] So, when you said
you had new members.

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:45.348 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I don't.

00:12:45.432 --> 00:12:47.183 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE]
Oh--I can't believe this!

00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:48.977 position:50% align:center
So, wait, does that
mean we really are

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:50.186 position:50% align:center
going to get shut down?

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:51.813 position:50% align:center
No, it means that we
have to find new members

00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:53.314 position:50% align:center
so that doesn't happen!

00:12:53.398 --> 00:12:55.442 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE] Are you kidding me?
It's too late for that now!

00:12:55.525 --> 00:12:58.361 position:50% align:center
Come on, you never know until
you try, what could it hurt?

00:12:58.445 --> 00:12:59.821 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE]
Nope! It's impossible!

00:12:59.904 --> 00:13:01.698 position:50% align:center
Everybody left and I'm
the only one who stayed,

00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:04.325 position:50% align:center
and just one other person's
joined since then.

00:13:04.409 --> 00:13:05.535 position:50% align:center
And let's be real, okay,

00:13:05.618 --> 00:13:06.828 position:50% align:center
it's not like I'm super
popular or anything.

00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:09.247 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA] Look, it's gonna
work out! I mean...

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:12.042 position:50% align:center
I don't know what I can do,
but I'll help any way I can!

00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:15.045 position:50% align:center
I'm not ready to lose the troupe
I only just joined, you know?

00:13:15.128 --> 00:13:17.422 position:50% align:center
Of course. I never
introduced myself.

00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:20.216 position:50% align:center
I'm Izumi Tachibana.
It's very nice to meet you.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:21.843 position:50% align:center
I'm Sakuya Sakuma.

00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:24.054 position:50% align:center
So, "Saku" as in
a blooming flower.

00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:25.764 position:50% align:center
It's great to meet you,
too, ma'am!

00:13:25.847 --> 00:13:28.892 position:50% align:center
Stand up, Manager!
It's gonna be okay, you'll see!

00:13:28.975 --> 00:13:31.144 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE]
Fine. There's no hope, but...

00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:34.564 position:50% align:center
I guess we should at least
give the theatre gods a chance!

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:37.067 position:50% align:center
Now, bear with me,
but I think I've got an idea

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.569 position:50% align:center
of how we might be able to
recruit some actors quick!

00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:41.154 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE]
Hello, fellow humans!

00:13:41.237 --> 00:13:44.282 position:50% align:center
I'm Isuke, manager of
the Mankai Theatre Company!

00:13:44.366 --> 00:13:47.077 position:50% align:center
We're about to hold an
impromptu street audition!

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.328 position:50% align:center
Here! I'll go first

00:13:48.411 --> 00:13:50.413 position:50% align:center
in case anyone
else is too nervous to!

00:13:50.497 --> 00:13:52.499 position:50% align:center
I'm Sakuya Sakuma, I'm 17!

00:13:52.582 --> 00:13:53.667 position:50% align:center
My strongest talent is
remembering peoples' faces...

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.126 position:50% align:center
[MAN C]
Some kind of street show?

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:57.212 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN E]
Man, think he's loud enough?

00:13:57.295 --> 00:14:00.507 position:50% align:center
It seems to be going as planned,
we're getting attention.

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:01.925 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE]
Hey, Director!

00:14:02.008 --> 00:14:04.511 position:50% align:center
What questions would you like
to ask our auditioners?

00:14:04.594 --> 00:14:08.515 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Huh? You're asking me?
Uh, well, lemme think on that.

00:14:08.598 --> 00:14:10.725 position:50% align:center
Right, okay. I guess.

00:14:10.809 --> 00:14:14.854 position:50% align:center
Obviously the first question
should be the usual one!

00:14:14.938 --> 00:14:16.981 position:50% align:center
[VIEWER B] Wow, do you think
they lost some kind of bet?

00:14:17.065 --> 00:14:19.192 position:50% align:center
[MALE VIEWER 01B]
Maybe it's part of the act.

00:14:19.275 --> 00:14:20.443 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Very helpful!

00:14:20.527 --> 00:14:21.736 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE]
Go on, Director!

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:23.822 position:50% align:center
Okay, I've got it!
Here's the first question:

00:14:23.905 --> 00:14:26.366 position:50% align:center
What would you say were your
strengths and weaknesses,

00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:29.285 position:50% align:center
and what special quality would
you bring to the group?

00:14:29.369 --> 00:14:31.162 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:14:31.246 --> 00:14:33.998 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA] No one's giving us
a second glance out here.

00:14:34.082 --> 00:14:35.792 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:37.043 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:14:41.715 --> 00:14:44.384 position:50% align:center
Hey, I don't suppose you're
interested in theater, are you?

00:14:44.467 --> 00:14:47.137 position:50% align:center
Oh, me? Uh...

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.180 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Is that Masumi?

00:14:49.264 --> 00:14:50.890 position:50% align:center
Who? Don't tell me
you know this guy?

00:14:50.974 --> 00:14:52.892 position:50% align:center
Yeah, he's in the grade
below me at school.

00:14:52.976 --> 00:14:54.477 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI]
Sorry, who're you?

00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:57.188 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's so funny,
I guess he doesn't recognize me.

00:14:57.272 --> 00:15:00.233 position:50% align:center
Hey, listen, Masumi.
If you're interested in theatre,

00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:02.569 position:50% align:center
then I really think you should
consider joining our company!

00:15:02.652 --> 00:15:04.696 position:50% align:center
Are you part of the company?

00:15:04.779 --> 00:15:07.073 position:50% align:center
Huh? No, I'm not.

00:15:07.157 --> 00:15:08.825 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI]
Oh, you're not?

00:15:08.908 --> 00:15:10.660 position:50% align:center
Oh, please,
don't be shy, Director!

00:15:10.744 --> 00:15:12.787 position:50% align:center
The general director
is definitely a big part

00:15:12.871 --> 00:15:13.621 position:50% align:center
of the company!

00:15:13.705 --> 00:15:15.123 position:50% align:center
What? Wait!

00:15:15.206 --> 00:15:18.251 position:50% align:center
I was only doing that to go
along with the street act--

00:15:19.878 --> 00:15:21.254 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:24.424 position:50% align:center
I'll only agree if
you're involved.

00:15:24.507 --> 00:15:25.508 position:50% align:center
What?

00:15:25.592 --> 00:15:27.552 position:50% align:center
Masumi, you're joining?
That's awesome!

00:15:27.635 --> 00:15:29.304 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI]
I still don't know who you are.

00:15:29.387 --> 00:15:30.764 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
Oh, well, that's okay!

00:15:30.847 --> 00:15:34.684 position:50% align:center
I just... I really didn't
come here planning to join.

00:15:36.811 --> 00:15:39.314 position:50% align:center
But, cool. Guess we have
a new member!

00:15:39.397 --> 00:15:43.568 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI] Member number two,
Masumi Usui, age 16.

00:15:43.651 --> 00:15:46.529 position:50% align:center
My hobby's listening
to music, I guess.

00:15:46.613 --> 00:15:49.240 position:50% align:center
And I'm joining the company
determined to do my best

00:15:49.324 --> 00:15:51.242 position:50% align:center
for our beautiful director.

00:15:51.326 --> 00:15:52.911 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS gasp]

00:15:52.994 --> 00:15:56.247 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE]
Wow, Masumi's amazing, isn't he?

00:15:56.331 --> 00:15:58.875 position:50% align:center
He handles himself very
well and he has flair.

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.628 position:50% align:center
Hard to believe it's his
first ti-- Whoa, hello!

00:16:01.711 --> 00:16:03.129 position:50% align:center
You have any notes
for me, Director?

00:16:03.213 --> 00:16:04.005 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Yeah, great!

00:16:04.089 --> 00:16:05.632 position:50% align:center
Do you feel like I'm doing okay?

00:16:05.715 --> 00:16:07.175 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE] You were a natural
out there! So ama--

00:16:07.258 --> 00:16:09.386 position:50% align:center
--Yeah, sorry, not asking you.
--[ISUKE] Uh...

00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:12.013 position:50% align:center
Uh. I thought you did
a really great job!

00:16:12.097 --> 00:16:14.140 position:50% align:center
Just keep it up!

00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:19.688 position:50% align:center
Okay, he's a strange kid,
that's confirmed.

00:16:19.771 --> 00:16:20.980 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI]
How about this?

00:16:21.064 --> 00:16:23.358 position:50% align:center
It's great! You don't have
to ask every second!

00:16:25.318 --> 00:16:28.947 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE] Well, it's sunset.
Guess that's it.

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:31.491 position:50% align:center
There has to be someone.
One more.

00:16:31.574 --> 00:16:32.701 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:34.452 --> 00:16:35.286 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
It's him!

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:36.496 position:50% align:center
It's who?

00:16:36.579 --> 00:16:38.623 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA] He was asking
around for a troupe

00:16:38.707 --> 00:16:39.541 position:50% align:center
with a dorm earlier!

00:16:39.624 --> 00:16:40.917 position:50% align:center
Are you serious?

00:16:41.001 --> 00:16:43.962 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA] Yeah! I have a knack
for remembering faces!

00:16:44.045 --> 00:16:45.588 position:50% align:center
Let's follow him!

00:16:45.672 --> 00:16:46.715 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI]
Right! As you wish!

00:16:46.798 --> 00:16:48.425 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA panting]

00:16:52.971 --> 00:16:54.055 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:58.935 --> 00:17:02.022 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
Hey! Please, wait!

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:14.743 position:50% align:center
The world's a stage.
And the men and women...

00:17:14.826 --> 00:17:18.496 position:50% align:center
All the men and women
are merely players.

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:20.665 position:50% align:center
Shoot, what's the next part. Oh!

00:17:20.749 --> 00:17:23.126 position:50% align:center
[STREET MAN A] Uh-oh.
Ya think this guy is okay?

00:17:23.209 --> 00:17:24.836 position:50% align:center
[STREET MAN B]
Dude, no idea.

00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:27.756 position:50% align:center
...one man in his time
plays many parts.

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:28.673 position:50% align:center
His acts being seven ages.

00:17:28.757 --> 00:17:30.175 position:50% align:center
He's quoting Shakespeare.

00:17:30.258 --> 00:17:32.344 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA] I cannot believe I'm
getting all of this right!

00:17:32.427 --> 00:17:35.722 position:50% align:center
Ha, ha! At first
the infant. Yes.

00:17:37.265 --> 00:17:40.393 position:50% align:center
Mewling and puking
in the nurse's arms.

00:17:40.477 --> 00:17:45.065 position:50% align:center
Sorry, that was gross. And then,
the whining school-boy!

00:17:46.816 --> 00:17:48.526 position:50% align:center
Right! With his satchel!

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:50.987 position:50% align:center
With his satchel and
shining morning face,

00:17:51.071 --> 00:17:53.615 position:50% align:center
creeping like snail
unwillingly to school.

00:17:53.698 --> 00:17:55.533 position:50% align:center
And then, the lover.

00:17:55.617 --> 00:17:57.827 position:50% align:center
Hey, do you know this part, too?

00:17:57.911 --> 00:18:01.331 position:50% align:center
[BOTH] Sighing like furnace,
with a woeful ballad.

00:18:01.414 --> 00:18:03.416 position:50% align:center
Made to his mistress' eyebrow.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:06.961 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure if I know the
next part, but don't tell me.

00:18:08.171 --> 00:18:09.756 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU laughs]

00:18:09.839 --> 00:18:11.007 position:50% align:center
--[SAKUYA] Then a soldier...
---[TSUZURU] Oh, right!

00:18:11.091 --> 00:18:12.717 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA, TSUZURU]
...full of strange oaths,

00:18:12.801 --> 00:18:14.177 position:50% align:center
and bearded like the pard.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.846 position:50% align:center
Jealous in honor, sudden,
and quick in quarrel.

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:19.099 position:50% align:center
Seeking the bubble reputation!

00:18:19.182 --> 00:18:21.810 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Excuse me.

00:18:21.893 --> 00:18:24.979 position:50% align:center
Would you be interested in
joining a theater troupe?

00:18:25.063 --> 00:18:26.564 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:26.648 --> 00:18:28.483 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE] We even have the dorm
situation you're looking for.

00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:30.819 position:50% align:center
Wait, how did you know that?

00:18:30.902 --> 00:18:33.863 position:50% align:center
Also, I don't actually have
any theater experience.

00:18:33.947 --> 00:18:36.533 position:50% align:center
Hey, that's no problem,
I joined without any.

00:18:37.534 --> 00:18:38.910 position:50% align:center
Honestly.

00:18:38.993 --> 00:18:42.080 position:50% align:center
I think I'd rather write a play
than be the actor in it.

00:18:42.163 --> 00:18:43.498 position:50% align:center
In that case,
how would you feel

00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:45.792 position:50% align:center
about being both an actor
and a playwright?

00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:48.712 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU] I'm down.
Go ahead and sign me up!

00:18:48.795 --> 00:18:50.505 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE]
Yippee!

00:18:50.588 --> 00:18:53.091 position:50% align:center
Thanks! I'm Tsuzuru Minagi.

00:18:53.174 --> 00:18:55.093 position:50% align:center
Nice to meet you, Tsuzuru.

00:18:55.176 --> 00:18:56.720 position:50% align:center
Even I could write
a lame script.

00:18:56.803 --> 00:18:58.555 position:50% align:center
Look, it's not a competition!

00:18:58.638 --> 00:19:01.391 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA] Oh, hey!
We'd better get back, ma'am!

00:19:01.474 --> 00:19:04.227 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Right, I'll explain
everything later!

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.229 position:50% align:center
Everyone hustle.

00:19:06.312 --> 00:19:09.065 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU] If you say so!
I'm right behind you!

00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:10.483 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:19:16.114 --> 00:19:17.657 position:50% align:center
--[FURUICHI] Hm?
--[door opens]

00:19:17.741 --> 00:19:21.995 position:50% align:center
Ah. So, how did you
dupe them into this?

00:19:22.078 --> 00:19:23.204 position:50% align:center
[ALL panting]

00:19:23.288 --> 00:19:25.206 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA] We made it back
in time, didn't we?

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:27.834 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI] Yes. You got in
just under the wire.

00:19:27.917 --> 00:19:29.419 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE]
So, what's that mean?

00:19:29.502 --> 00:19:31.338 position:50% align:center
You won't demolish the place?

00:19:31.421 --> 00:19:33.214 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
I wouldn't breathe easy yet.

00:19:33.298 --> 00:19:35.342 position:50% align:center
All this really means for
you is that I won't be

00:19:35.425 --> 00:19:37.093 position:50% align:center
tearing down the sign today.

00:19:37.177 --> 00:19:37.969 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Wait, what?

00:19:38.053 --> 00:19:39.346 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI]
We're disbanding?

00:19:39.429 --> 00:19:41.848 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU] This guy's brutal.
He's like a TV villain.

00:19:41.931 --> 00:19:43.683 position:50% align:center
And here I was,
getting all excited

00:19:43.767 --> 00:19:45.852 position:50% align:center
that we could finally start
up a new Spring Troupe!

00:19:45.935 --> 00:19:47.103 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
That's your plan?

00:19:47.187 --> 00:19:48.521 position:50% align:center
Yes, it is!

00:19:48.605 --> 00:19:50.440 position:50% align:center
We'll debut a new show
once we get enough mem--

00:19:50.523 --> 00:19:51.524 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
When will that be?

00:19:51.608 --> 00:19:54.819 position:50% align:center
Huh? Um, well.

00:19:54.903 --> 00:19:56.738 position:50% align:center
What're your thoughts
on that, Director?

00:19:56.821 --> 00:19:57.655 position:50% align:center
Don't ask me!

00:19:57.739 --> 00:20:00.825 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
But, Director!

00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:03.370 position:50% align:center
Okay, let's see, we'd have
to start from the basics

00:20:03.453 --> 00:20:05.288 position:50% align:center
and build a new show
and rehearse it, so,

00:20:05.372 --> 00:20:06.456 position:50% align:center
I don't know, maybe six months--

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:07.290 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
Next month.

00:20:07.374 --> 00:20:09.376 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Huh?

00:20:09.459 --> 00:20:11.628 position:50% align:center
You should all begin
rehearsing soon.

00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:13.505 position:50% align:center
Then you will put on
a show next month.

00:20:13.588 --> 00:20:14.881 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
That's impossible!

00:20:14.964 --> 00:20:18.134 position:50% align:center
Shut up. I have one
final offer for you.

00:20:18.218 --> 00:20:20.679 position:50% align:center
If you can fulfill the following
three conditions,

00:20:20.762 --> 00:20:23.014 position:50% align:center
then, I'll extend
the debt deadline.

00:20:23.098 --> 00:20:25.058 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
What conditions?

00:20:25.141 --> 00:20:27.018 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
One: The new Spring Troupe

00:20:27.102 --> 00:20:28.436 position:50% align:center
is to launch their debut show

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:30.689 position:50% align:center
within the next month and
it must have a full house

00:20:30.772 --> 00:20:32.857 position:50% align:center
on closing night.

00:20:32.941 --> 00:20:35.985 position:50% align:center
Two: Form four sub-troupes
by the end of the year

00:20:36.069 --> 00:20:39.656 position:50% align:center
with each troupe consistently
running successful shows.

00:20:39.739 --> 00:20:44.536 position:50% align:center
Three: The entire debt is to
be paid off within one year.

00:20:44.619 --> 00:20:46.621 position:50% align:center
If even one condition
is not met,

00:20:46.705 --> 00:20:49.457 position:50% align:center
I'll demolish the place,
no questions asked.

00:20:49.541 --> 00:20:51.167 position:50% align:center
Within the year?
That's ridiculous!

00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:52.627 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
Would you quit whining?

00:20:52.711 --> 00:20:54.921 position:50% align:center
You know how much
debt the troupe's in?

00:20:55.005 --> 00:20:56.297 position:50% align:center
Ten million yen!

00:20:56.381 --> 00:20:58.049 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU]
That's crazy!

00:20:58.133 --> 00:21:01.678 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI] Understand? This is
as far as I'll compromise.

00:21:01.761 --> 00:21:03.555 position:50% align:center
That is, unless...

00:21:03.638 --> 00:21:04.806 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI gasps]

00:21:04.889 --> 00:21:07.017 position:50% align:center
You plan to take responsibility
for the debt,

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:09.602 position:50% align:center
because that's a whole
different conversation.

00:21:09.686 --> 00:21:13.690 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI grunts]
Don't grab her like that again!

00:21:13.773 --> 00:21:15.025 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
Hmph.

00:21:15.108 --> 00:21:17.193 position:50% align:center
Oh, also, one last thing.

00:21:17.277 --> 00:21:18.778 position:50% align:center
Great, what do you want now?

00:21:18.862 --> 00:21:20.822 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI] You will take on the
position of this theatre's

00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:24.325 position:50% align:center
general director.
That is my last condition.

00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:26.077 position:50% align:center
But... For real? Why me?

00:21:26.161 --> 00:21:29.706 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI] I see.
So you're going to run away.

00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:31.541 position:50% align:center
Just like your father?

00:21:31.624 --> 00:21:33.418 position:50% align:center
What exactly are you getting at?

00:21:33.501 --> 00:21:35.795 position:50% align:center
Your father was the
general director, wasn't he?

00:21:35.879 --> 00:21:37.088 position:50% align:center
He abandoned the troupe.

00:21:37.172 --> 00:21:38.923 position:50% align:center
I suppose he just couldn't
handle the pressure

00:21:39.007 --> 00:21:39.924 position:50% align:center
that comes with the job.

00:21:40.008 --> 00:21:41.634 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI gasps]

00:21:41.718 --> 00:21:43.762 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI] He must've cut his
losses when he realized

00:21:43.845 --> 00:21:45.138 position:50% align:center
he couldn't keep
the place afloat.

00:21:45.221 --> 00:21:47.057 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE]
Yukio would never!

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.517 position:50% align:center
He truly loved the theater!
It was everything to him!

00:21:49.601 --> 00:21:52.228 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI] Loving something
doesn't mean you're fit for it.

00:21:52.312 --> 00:21:55.440 position:50% align:center
So, that's the story.
Theatre is tough.

00:21:55.523 --> 00:21:58.610 position:50% align:center
You'd all do well to
bear that in mind.

00:21:59.611 --> 00:22:00.445 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
Even so.

00:22:00.528 --> 00:22:01.654 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI gasps]

00:22:01.738 --> 00:22:03.740 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:22:06.534 --> 00:22:08.328 position:50% align:center
Some things are a
joy to work hard at

00:22:08.411 --> 00:22:10.580 position:50% align:center
just because you love them!

00:22:10.663 --> 00:22:12.540 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI gasps]

00:22:14.542 --> 00:22:16.044 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
And, you know...

00:22:16.127 --> 00:22:19.255 position:50% align:center
If it doesn't work out, then,
you just have to keep on trying!

00:22:19.339 --> 00:22:22.550 position:50% align:center
I know that I love
the stage. So...

00:22:22.634 --> 00:22:26.179 position:50% align:center
...I'll never run away,
no matter how hard it gets!

00:22:29.808 --> 00:22:35.230 position:50% align:center
As for me, I refuse to run
before I've even started.

00:22:35.313 --> 00:22:36.481 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI]
Me neither.

00:22:36.564 --> 00:22:39.442 position:50% align:center
I haven't done anything
for the director yet.

00:22:50.453 --> 00:22:53.873 position:50% align:center
Okay, I'll do it.

00:22:53.957 --> 00:22:57.168 position:50% align:center
So, I guess...
You've got a general director!

00:22:57.252 --> 00:22:58.586 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:22:59.462 --> 00:23:00.880 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI chuckles]

00:23:01.464 --> 00:23:03.049 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA laughs]

00:23:06.052 --> 00:23:07.595 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
Yes, ma'am!
