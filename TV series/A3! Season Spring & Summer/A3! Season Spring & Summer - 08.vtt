[bell ringing]

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:15.598 position:50% align:center
Dude, I can't
believe you did that!

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.434 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
Hey! Yuki!

00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:24.065 position:50% align:center
Yuki?

00:00:24.107 --> 00:00:27.235 position:50% align:center
Oh, sorry. Is it okay
to use your first name?

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:29.904 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I guess. Sure, whatever.

00:00:29.946 --> 00:00:31.614 position:50% align:center
I'll walk with you!

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.410 position:50% align:center
What if people see us
together and realize

00:00:35.452 --> 00:00:36.870 position:50% align:center
we're living in the same dorm?

00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:37.746 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:39.664 position:50% align:center
Allow me to spell it
out for you.

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:41.708 position:50% align:center
When people find out
we do theater,

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.001 position:50% align:center
they'll just mock us.

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:45.170 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, you have a point.

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:47.964 position:50% align:center
I can already imagine the things
they'd make fun of us for.

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:50.759 position:50% align:center
They'd call us "double shorties"
or "the runt couple."

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.886 position:50% align:center
You do realize you
just insulted me.

00:00:52.927 --> 00:00:54.387 position:50% align:center
Oops. Sorry.

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:56.765 position:50% align:center
You can follow.
Just don't make it obvious.

00:00:56.806 --> 00:00:58.391 position:50% align:center
Right, I won't!

00:01:00.643 --> 00:01:04.773 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI] Sup homies! Those
uniforms are totes adorbs!

00:01:04.814 --> 00:01:06.232 position:50% align:center
Wait.

00:01:06.274 --> 00:01:08.443 position:50% align:center
Why're you guys
walking so far apart?

00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:09.611 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
We're discreet.

00:01:09.652 --> 00:01:13.073 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI] Ooh, what?
It's like you're celebs! So hip!

00:01:15.116 --> 00:01:17.160 position:50% align:center
Whoa! A Porche!

00:01:20.622 --> 00:01:24.834 position:50% align:center
Aw, snap! So is this your ride,
Tenten? Awesome!

00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:27.671 position:50% align:center
Will you please tone it down
a little? It's embarrassing.

00:01:27.712 --> 00:01:30.423 position:50% align:center
You're the embarrassing one
driving this flashy sports car

00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:32.258 position:50% align:center
down a narrow street
like you own the place.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.636 position:50% align:center
Name one thing that's
embarrassing about my car.

00:01:34.678 --> 00:01:35.804 position:50% align:center
Its owner.

00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:38.306 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI] Come on, all this
yelling is attracting attention.

00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:42.811 position:50% align:center
[BOY B] Don't wanna
grow up to be like them.

00:01:42.852 --> 00:01:44.771 position:50% align:center
Igawa. You can head back now.

00:01:44.813 --> 00:01:45.855 position:50% align:center
You sure?

00:01:45.897 --> 00:01:47.857 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
I'll walk from here.

00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:50.235 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:01:53.655 --> 00:01:55.448 position:50% align:center
Do you think that's his manager?

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.410 position:50% align:center
That's our Tenten! Making
his manager play chauffer.

00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:00.995 position:50% align:center
Don't just stand there.
Pick up the pace.

00:02:01.037 --> 00:02:03.707 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Yeah. That's our Tenten.

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:38.134 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] We'll now start Summer
Troupe's first rehearsal.

00:03:38.176 --> 00:03:40.720 position:50% align:center
Since most of you have
little acting experience,

00:03:40.762 --> 00:03:43.139 position:50% align:center
we'll begin by doing
some improv exercises.

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:44.391 position:50% align:center
Wait, exercises?

00:03:44.432 --> 00:03:46.101 position:50% align:center
You don't even know that much?

00:03:46.142 --> 00:03:48.103 position:50% align:center
Well. Why don't you
explain it to them?

00:03:48.144 --> 00:03:50.563 position:50% align:center
Listen, improv exercises
are no big deal.

00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:52.649 position:50% align:center
The actors ad-lib
a scene together.

00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:55.735 position:50% align:center
Hold on, why am I the one
having to teach these guys?

00:03:55.777 --> 00:03:58.947 position:50% align:center
You can complain, but that
was a super-helpful lesson!

00:03:58.988 --> 00:04:00.990 position:50% align:center
All right now, time to pair up.

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:03.785 position:50% align:center
Do we have any volunteers
to start things off?

00:04:03.827 --> 00:04:06.204 position:50% align:center
How about... Yuki and Muku.

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:08.373 position:50% align:center
--'Kay.
--Yes, ma'am.

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:12.252 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Ready and... begin!

00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:21.094 position:50% align:center
So, what's up?

00:04:21.136 --> 00:04:23.763 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh. Like nothing much?

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:26.182 position:50% align:center
Okay. Do you know of
anything fun to do?

00:04:26.224 --> 00:04:27.934 position:50% align:center
School has been so boring.

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:30.020 position:50% align:center
I need, like,
a hobby or something.

00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:31.771 position:50% align:center
Are they high school girls?

00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:33.857 position:50% align:center
Yukki seems like a natural.

00:04:33.898 --> 00:04:37.986 position:50% align:center
Yeah! I'm pretty bored, too.
Wanna, like, hang out?

00:04:38.028 --> 00:04:40.739 position:50% align:center
Sure thing. That'd be great.
Maybe, karaoke?

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.990 position:50% align:center
Oh. Yeah!

00:04:42.032 --> 00:04:43.992 position:50% align:center
All right. Where should be go?

00:04:44.034 --> 00:04:47.120 position:50% align:center
Let's see. Um... I know, like,

00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:48.997 position:50% align:center
maybe the place
by the train station.

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.082 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that works.
Let's go there.

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:52.375 position:50% align:center
And that's scene.

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:56.254 position:50% align:center
It was a solid effort
for your first time.

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:57.505 position:50% align:center
Stop saying "like."

00:04:57.547 --> 00:04:59.257 position:50% align:center
Also, you just
played yourselves.

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:01.801 position:50% align:center
There's nothing wrong with
that when starting out.

00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:04.721 position:50% align:center
Next up... Kazunari and Misumi.

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:05.889 position:50% align:center
Roger.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.891 position:50% align:center
I'm all over it.

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:13.438 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
And... action!

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.815 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
Hm, kay. I got it!

00:05:15.857 --> 00:05:18.568 position:50% align:center
Oh man, I need to
jet to the shoot.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.363 position:50% align:center
Then there's the magazine
interview after that.

00:05:21.404 --> 00:05:22.989 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI]
What are you doing?

00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:26.743 position:50% align:center
You're already late. The car
I called is waiting outside.

00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:28.578 position:50% align:center
You, uh called a car?

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.330 position:50% align:center
How many times do
I have to tell you

00:05:30.372 --> 00:05:32.123 position:50% align:center
to look over your schedule?

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:34.834 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
You're right, my bad.

00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:36.795 position:50% align:center
That weirdo is...

00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:39.047 position:50% align:center
...actually good.

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:41.049 position:50% align:center
And start answering your phone.

00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:43.885 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
Sorry, I had it on vibrate?

00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:46.805 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Stop there!
That was really good!

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:49.307 position:50% align:center
Tenma. Why don't
you jump in next,

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:52.435 position:50% align:center
and Misumi, you stay
as his scene partner.

00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:54.437 position:50% align:center
No problem.

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:04.823 position:50% align:center
Action!

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:10.870 position:50% align:center
Stop that.

00:06:10.912 --> 00:06:14.499 position:50% align:center
And why should I?
Is it a crime to look at you?

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:16.501 position:50% align:center
Say it. What's your problem?

00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:18.795 position:50% align:center
Always trying to pick a fight.

00:06:18.837 --> 00:06:21.131 position:50% align:center
Some things never change.

00:06:21.172 --> 00:06:23.800 position:50% align:center
What kind of little
brother acts like that?

00:06:23.842 --> 00:06:25.552 position:50% align:center
You're taking the high road?

00:06:25.593 --> 00:06:29.055 position:50% align:center
Pretty arrogant for someone
who barely ever comes home.

00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:31.599 position:50% align:center
You don't even know
that dad is sick.

00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:33.184 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Tenma's doing a stellar job

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:35.603 position:50% align:center
of adapting to
the story on the fly.

00:06:35.645 --> 00:06:39.607 position:50% align:center
He's sick?
What's wrong with him?

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:41.609 position:50% align:center
It's none of your business.

00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:46.239 position:50% align:center
Of course it's my business!
What are you talking about?

00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:47.782 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:55.749 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. Where's Dad now?
The hospital?

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.751 position:50% align:center
I'll drive us there.

00:06:57.792 --> 00:06:59.461 position:50% align:center
Thanks, brother.

00:06:59.502 --> 00:07:00.378 position:50% align:center
[clap]

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:01.921 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Scene. Okay, wow.

00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:05.467 position:50% align:center
You had all the elements of
an actual story. Excellent job.

00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:07.260 position:50% align:center
Now that was good improv.

00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:09.512 position:50% align:center
When you get into a flow
with your scene partner,

00:07:09.554 --> 00:07:11.264 position:50% align:center
you can tell a better story.

00:07:11.306 --> 00:07:14.059 position:50% align:center
Do you have to criticize
everything about us?

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.935 position:50% align:center
What a jerk.

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:21.107 position:50% align:center
[MUKU] I wonder why she asked
us to all meet after dinner.

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:23.902 position:50% align:center
I hope she hurries,
I'm about to crash.

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:24.736 position:50% align:center
[YUKI, MUKU]
Hm?

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:26.654 position:50% align:center
Good. You're all here.

00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:28.656 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
Ooh! Hi, Tsuzuroon!

00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:29.574 position:50% align:center
Hey, man.

00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:31.076 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
There are still plenty of things

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:32.619 position:50% align:center
we need to figure out
going forward,

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.913 position:50% align:center
but first, you guys
need to decide

00:07:34.954 --> 00:07:37.290 position:50% align:center
who's going to be the leader
of the Summer Troupe.

00:07:37.332 --> 00:07:39.250 position:50% align:center
--Leader?
--There's only one candidate

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:41.544 position:50% align:center
who makes any sort of sense,
and that's me.

00:07:41.586 --> 00:07:43.922 position:50% align:center
Really? You know, if your
head was any bigger,

00:07:43.963 --> 00:07:45.924 position:50% align:center
you wouldn't be able to fit
through the doorway.

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:46.841 position:50% align:center
Shut up!

00:07:46.883 --> 00:07:49.469 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI] Over here. I wouldn't
mind being top dog.

00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:50.512 position:50% align:center
[YUKI, TENMA]
Not a chance.

00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:51.429 position:50% align:center
Aw...

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:52.681 position:50% align:center
You're a flirt, not a leader.

00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:55.058 position:50% align:center
Pretty sure I'm
fine with anybody.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.643 position:50% align:center
You're a fool.

00:07:56.685 --> 00:07:58.395 position:50% align:center
Muku, what do you think?

00:07:58.436 --> 00:08:03.108 position:50% align:center
Huh? Oh, um. It would
make sense to have

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:04.693 position:50% align:center
someone with experience

00:08:04.734 --> 00:08:07.362 position:50% align:center
who can help teach us
how to be better actors.

00:08:07.404 --> 00:08:09.614 position:50% align:center
So, Tenma is probably
the best choice.

00:08:09.656 --> 00:08:11.866 position:50% align:center
For real?
Acting's all he's good at.

00:08:11.908 --> 00:08:13.910 position:50% align:center
What, you think I can't
handle the job?

00:08:13.952 --> 00:08:16.996 position:50% align:center
That's enough! I do think
Muku makes a solid point.

00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:18.957 position:50% align:center
Tenma is going to be our leader.

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:20.458 position:50% align:center
What?

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.334 position:50% align:center
I've got this.

00:08:21.376 --> 00:08:23.420 position:50% align:center
Tenma. You need to reflect on

00:08:23.461 --> 00:08:25.880 position:50% align:center
what it means to be in charge
of the Summer Troupe.

00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:27.424 position:50% align:center
That's not a problem.

00:08:27.465 --> 00:08:29.551 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty much
a natural-born leader.

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:32.220 position:50% align:center
Maybe you should actually
listen to the director.

00:08:32.262 --> 00:08:33.430 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
What does that mean?

00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:36.641 position:50% align:center
Settle down. Next up, you all
need to discuss the theme

00:08:36.683 --> 00:08:39.227 position:50% align:center
of your debut performance
with Tsuzuru.

00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:40.770 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI]
I don't care what we do as long

00:08:40.812 --> 00:08:42.772 position:50% align:center
as there'll be triangles.

00:08:42.814 --> 00:08:47.610 position:50% align:center
Hey, now. You'll be in the show.
So, we want your input, man.

00:08:47.652 --> 00:08:49.195 position:50% align:center
Yeah, okay.

00:08:49.237 --> 00:08:51.406 position:50% align:center
That's so kind of you
to point out, Kaza.

00:08:51.448 --> 00:08:53.283 position:50% align:center
Must be an extrovert thing.

00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:56.286 position:50% align:center
Sumi. Tell these guys.
You and I are buds, right?

00:08:56.327 --> 00:08:57.912 position:50% align:center
Kaza and I hit it off fast.

00:08:57.954 --> 00:08:59.330 position:50% align:center
I like you so much!

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:02.083 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Yeah!

00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:05.337 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] So, wow'd you decide
on <i>Romeo and Julius</i>?

00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:07.839 position:50% align:center
We were inspired by
the original Spring Troupe.

00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:10.175 position:50% align:center
Then maybe our troupe
should do the same.

00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:11.593 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
I'm down with that.

00:09:11.634 --> 00:09:13.053 position:50% align:center
Before we commit to something,

00:09:13.094 --> 00:09:15.722 position:50% align:center
what was the original
Summer Troupe into?

00:09:15.764 --> 00:09:18.475 position:50% align:center
They specialized in
high-energy comedies.

00:09:18.516 --> 00:09:19.934 position:50% align:center
Comedy?

00:09:19.976 --> 00:09:21.686 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Let me guess, you're
gonna complain.

00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:25.190 position:50% align:center
No, it's just that comedy isn't
something I've done much of.

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:27.192 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Sounds like a complaint to me.

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:29.444 position:50% align:center
But Tenma's concerns
may be valid.

00:09:29.486 --> 00:09:30.278 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
How?

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.530 position:50% align:center
Generally speaking, it's
harder to make people laugh

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:33.948 position:50% align:center
than it is to make them cry.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.160 position:50% align:center
This could be too big of
a challenge for you.

00:09:37.202 --> 00:09:39.329 position:50% align:center
I didn't say I couldn't do it.

00:09:39.371 --> 00:09:40.914 position:50% align:center
So, comedy, huh?

00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:44.250 position:50% align:center
This could be an excellent way
to expand my acting repertoire.

00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:45.335 position:50% align:center
We're going to follow in the

00:09:45.377 --> 00:09:47.837 position:50% align:center
original Summer
Troupe's footsteps.

00:09:47.879 --> 00:09:48.922 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI chuckles]

00:09:48.963 --> 00:09:51.383 position:50% align:center
She's got you wrapped
around her finger.

00:09:52.842 --> 00:09:55.470 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Is there anything else
you wanna say, Tsuzuru?

00:09:55.512 --> 00:09:59.265 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I plan to precast
before writing again.

00:09:59.307 --> 00:10:00.308 position:50% align:center
So, it would help to know

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:02.227 position:50% align:center
who wants to be in
the leading roles.

00:10:02.268 --> 00:10:06.189 position:50% align:center
Good point.
Anyone want to volunteer?

00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:07.524 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:08.817 position:50% align:center
[TENMA chuckles]

00:10:08.858 --> 00:10:11.653 position:50% align:center
[GROUP chattering]

00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:13.154 position:50% align:center
So, everybody.

00:10:13.196 --> 00:10:15.365 position:50% align:center
[TENMA] Gimme a break!
You think any of you

00:10:15.407 --> 00:10:16.991 position:50% align:center
could carry a show
on your back?

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:18.118 position:50% align:center
I got that lead energy!

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:19.869 position:50% align:center
My costume would be gorgeous.

00:10:19.911 --> 00:10:21.746 position:50% align:center
As the lead, I can inhabit
the role of the hero.

00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:24.416 position:50% align:center
If I'm the lead, I can
wear so many triangles!

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:25.375 position:50% align:center
Hell no!

00:10:25.417 --> 00:10:27.460 position:50% align:center
You can't leave this
to an amateur!

00:10:27.502 --> 00:10:29.963 position:50% align:center
Sakuya didn't have
experience and he did great.

00:10:30.005 --> 00:10:31.297 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
That was a total fluke.

00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:33.299 position:50% align:center
I'm glad they're
all so motivated.

00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:35.927 position:50% align:center
But not everybody can
share the spotlight.

00:10:35.969 --> 00:10:38.513 position:50% align:center
They're the complete opposite
of the Spring Troupe.

00:10:38.555 --> 00:10:42.392 position:50% align:center
Maybe we should
table this talk for now.

00:10:42.434 --> 00:10:48.523 position:50% align:center
No. We just need the right show.
One where everybody's a lead.

00:10:53.862 --> 00:10:55.488 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:11:05.248 --> 00:11:11.713 position:50% align:center
[GROUP singing]

00:11:16.384 --> 00:11:20.055 position:50% align:center
Come and get it! This curry's
not gonna eat itself.

00:11:20.096 --> 00:11:21.556 position:50% align:center
Is this all you can cook?

00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:22.807 position:50% align:center
Jeez, not again.

00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:24.809 position:50% align:center
We had curry yesterday
and the day before!

00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:27.520 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but the Director's
curry is delicious.

00:11:27.562 --> 00:11:31.107 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI]
I'll pour some over my onigiri.

00:11:34.903 --> 00:11:36.863 position:50% align:center
Tsuzuroon, what's wrong?

00:11:36.905 --> 00:11:41.159 position:50% align:center
[gasps] The script is done.

00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:42.827 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
Tsuzuroon!

00:11:42.869 --> 00:11:43.661 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Crap.

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:45.288 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
Call an ambulance!

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:49.459 position:50% align:center
Oh, no! Would a triangle help?

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:51.878 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.463 position:50% align:center
Is he drooling?

00:11:53.505 --> 00:11:54.964 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Huh?

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:05.684 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] He hasn't slept since
he started writing.

00:12:10.397 --> 00:12:12.982 position:50% align:center
Hey! How are you feelin'?

00:12:13.024 --> 00:12:16.820 position:50% align:center
What? Oh, sorry, suddenly I
couldn't keep my eyes open.

00:12:16.861 --> 00:12:18.321 position:50% align:center
You scared us for a second.

00:12:18.363 --> 00:12:19.698 position:50% align:center
What a pain.

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:22.784 position:50% align:center
Wait! Did you guys
read the script yet?

00:12:25.286 --> 00:12:29.124 position:50% align:center
Nice, this is perfect.
We'll use it.

00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:31.626 position:50% align:center
Okay, but what's the play about?

00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:34.045 position:50% align:center
Since all of you wanted the
chance to take center stage,

00:12:34.087 --> 00:12:36.006 position:50% align:center
I based the show
on <i>Arabian Nights.</i>

00:12:36.047 --> 00:12:39.384 position:50% align:center
Is that the same as
<i>The Thousand and One Nights</i>?

00:12:39.426 --> 00:12:41.011 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
And, uh... What's that about.

00:12:41.052 --> 00:12:43.138 position:50% align:center
The frame story is about
a noble's daughter

00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:45.515 position:50% align:center
who entertains a monarch
through storytelling.

00:12:45.557 --> 00:12:48.309 position:50% align:center
Those stories have a lot
of famous characters.

00:12:48.351 --> 00:12:50.186 position:50% align:center
Do I play a triangle?

00:12:50.228 --> 00:12:51.688 position:50% align:center
Sorry, there's not one.

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:52.939 position:50% align:center
Aw...

00:12:52.981 --> 00:12:56.317 position:50% align:center
As troupe leader you'll play
the main lead, Ali Baba.

00:12:56.359 --> 00:12:57.318 position:50% align:center
Naturally.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.029 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU]
Yuki will be Scheherazade.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:00.739 position:50% align:center
Oh, she's the princess, right?

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.949 position:50% align:center
My costume is
gonna be glamorous!

00:13:02.991 --> 00:13:04.617 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU]
Miyoshi will play Aladdin.

00:13:04.659 --> 00:13:06.202 position:50% align:center
Yay! Someone famous.

00:13:06.244 --> 00:13:08.121 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU]
Muku will play Sinbad.

00:13:08.163 --> 00:13:11.374 position:50% align:center
And Sinbad is a hero,
right? I can't wait.

00:13:11.416 --> 00:13:13.585 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU] Ikaruga, you'll be the
mysterious genie of the lamp.

00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:16.588 position:50% align:center
Cool! Lamps are
kind of triangle-y.

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:19.174 position:50% align:center
That was smart,
giving them each big roles.

00:13:19.215 --> 00:13:20.633 position:50% align:center
Nice work, Tsuzuru!

00:13:20.675 --> 00:13:21.801 position:50% align:center
Thanks!

00:13:21.843 --> 00:13:24.846 position:50% align:center
I get to handle all of the
costumes for the show, right?

00:13:24.888 --> 00:13:26.389 position:50% align:center
--[IZUMI] Of course!
--[YUKI] Yes!

00:13:26.431 --> 00:13:28.516 position:50% align:center
Are you sure? If the costumes
look cheap, we're done for.

00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:31.728 position:50% align:center
I need organdy and
sequins to start out with.

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:33.730 position:50% align:center
These will be so chic.

00:13:33.772 --> 00:13:35.565 position:50% align:center
Okay, then I'll design
some graphics

00:13:35.607 --> 00:13:37.233 position:50% align:center
that will match
Yukki's costumes.

00:13:37.275 --> 00:13:39.194 position:50% align:center
Thanks for doing that.

00:13:39.235 --> 00:13:41.279 position:50% align:center
Everything's gonna be handmade?

00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:44.324 position:50% align:center
That doesn't exactly
give me confidence.

00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:48.453 position:50% align:center
[bell ringing]

00:13:48.495 --> 00:13:51.206 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
Hey, wait up!

00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:55.085 position:50% align:center
Uh! Sorry, I'm supposed
to keep my distance.

00:13:55.126 --> 00:13:55.919 position:50% align:center
I forgot.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:59.214 position:50% align:center
[CLUB MEMBER A]
Wait up, Sakisaka!

00:13:59.255 --> 00:14:00.465 position:50% align:center
Been a while.

00:14:00.507 --> 00:14:02.258 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Hi, there.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.511 position:50% align:center
[CLUB MEMBER A]
What've you been up to lately?

00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:10.100 position:50% align:center
Not much, really.

00:14:10.141 --> 00:14:13.269 position:50% align:center
--I see.
--C'mon.

00:14:13.311 --> 00:14:16.648 position:50% align:center
We gotta run. Practice time.

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:19.025 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
Oh, sure. Have fun.

00:14:21.361 --> 00:14:22.821 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Former teammates?

00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:24.823 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
Huh?

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:26.825 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
From the track team.

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:28.576 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
You knew about that?

00:14:28.618 --> 00:14:31.454 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah. Of course I did.

00:14:31.496 --> 00:14:35.458 position:50% align:center
You were a big deal.
Our ace sprinter.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.586 position:50% align:center
Then, you know I got an injury.

00:14:38.628 --> 00:14:41.214 position:50% align:center
I do.

00:14:41.256 --> 00:14:43.842 position:50% align:center
There's a hero from
a shojo manga series.

00:14:43.883 --> 00:14:48.847 position:50% align:center
They were a track star, too.
I thought they were so cool.

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:50.098 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
You looked up to the character,

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.975 position:50% align:center
so you joined the track team?

00:14:52.017 --> 00:14:55.145 position:50% align:center
[MUKU] Yup. I wanted
to be a star like them.

00:14:55.186 --> 00:14:59.566 position:50% align:center
I practiced every day like
crazy. Gave it my all.

00:14:59.607 --> 00:15:02.736 position:50% align:center
My big dream was to
lead the team to victory.

00:15:02.777 --> 00:15:05.196 position:50% align:center
But then--

00:15:05.238 --> 00:15:07.115 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Were they good teammates?

00:15:07.157 --> 00:15:09.868 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
The best.

00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:12.495 position:50% align:center
I can't chase after the dream
I shared with them,

00:15:12.537 --> 00:15:15.457 position:50% align:center
at least not anymore.

00:15:15.498 --> 00:15:18.376 position:50% align:center
So, instead,
I chose another role.

00:15:18.418 --> 00:15:23.089 position:50% align:center
My new dream is to be like
a prince from a shojo manga.

00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:26.885 position:50% align:center
If my teammates found out,
they'd make fun of me.

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:29.929 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Are you embarrassed
by your new dream?

00:15:29.971 --> 00:15:33.016 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
No, not really.

00:15:33.058 --> 00:15:35.894 position:50% align:center
You know what? You should
invite them to the show.

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:38.980 position:50% align:center
Let them see you act, as Sinbad.

00:15:39.022 --> 00:15:40.523 position:50% align:center
What if--?

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:47.697 position:50% align:center
You have a new dream.
Something to shoot for.

00:15:47.739 --> 00:15:50.784 position:50% align:center
Then show them,
share it with them.

00:15:57.457 --> 00:16:00.085 position:50% align:center
That means...
I've gotta work hard.

00:16:00.126 --> 00:16:02.087 position:50% align:center
Let's head out.
If we're late again,

00:16:02.128 --> 00:16:04.297 position:50% align:center
we'll have to deal with
that hack complaining.

00:16:04.339 --> 00:16:06.800 position:50% align:center
Can I, uh, walk beside you?

00:16:06.841 --> 00:16:08.718 position:50% align:center
Do whatever.

00:16:22.565 --> 00:16:25.193 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Did everyone get a
chance to study the script?

00:16:25.235 --> 00:16:27.070 position:50% align:center
--[YUKI] Yeah.
--[TENMA] Thoroughly.

00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:29.698 position:50% align:center
In that case,
let's start from the top.

00:16:29.739 --> 00:16:32.075 position:50% align:center
"Tonight, I have another
tale to share.

00:16:32.117 --> 00:16:35.203 position:50% align:center
One of a thousand
stories to delight you."

00:16:35.245 --> 00:16:36.871 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Tell me, Scheherazade!

00:16:36.913 --> 00:16:39.541 position:50% align:center
Where can I find
the legendary Oasis?

00:16:39.582 --> 00:16:41.835 position:50% align:center
"If you wish to know,
then so be it.

00:16:41.876 --> 00:16:43.586 position:50% align:center
Long ago, in a faraway land"--

00:16:43.628 --> 00:16:46.214 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Quickly now! Spit it out!

00:16:46.256 --> 00:16:48.550 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Yuki's still feeling
out the character.

00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:51.011 position:50% align:center
But Tenma's already
got his role down.

00:16:51.052 --> 00:16:54.556 position:50% align:center
Aladdin? What's his
personality, anyway?

00:16:54.597 --> 00:16:57.517 position:50% align:center
Ah, who cares. You know,
you're a real cutie.

00:16:57.559 --> 00:16:58.685 position:50% align:center
What's your name, huh?

00:16:58.727 --> 00:17:01.730 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] It'll be easy for
Kazunari to be a flirty Aladdin.

00:17:01.771 --> 00:17:03.565 position:50% align:center
He was born to play this role.

00:17:03.606 --> 00:17:06.234 position:50% align:center
"I shall grant unto
you three wishes.

00:17:06.276 --> 00:17:07.318 position:50% align:center
And what is it that you desire?"

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.070 position:50% align:center
Ah! My butt is on fire!

00:17:09.112 --> 00:17:10.238 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
Can't you tell what I want?

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.282 position:50% align:center
Do something about the
magician and the serpent!

00:17:12.323 --> 00:17:13.575 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
The role's perfect for Misumi.

00:17:13.616 --> 00:17:16.453 position:50% align:center
His quirkiness lends to
the charm of the genie.

00:17:16.494 --> 00:17:18.455 position:50% align:center
That leaves...

00:17:18.496 --> 00:17:22.500 position:50% align:center
Um, uh. "Ali Baba grow up.

00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:25.670 position:50% align:center
There is no legendary paradise.

00:17:25.712 --> 00:17:28.506 position:50% align:center
You're not going to get
rich searching for it."

00:17:28.548 --> 00:17:31.760 position:50% align:center
Again, it sounds like you're
reading aloud for the class.

00:17:31.801 --> 00:17:36.014 position:50% align:center
[MUKU] Right, sorry!
Grow yup-- I mean up.

00:17:36.056 --> 00:17:36.973 position:50% align:center
[TENMA sighs]

00:17:37.015 --> 00:17:38.808 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
Sorry again.

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:41.019 position:50% align:center
He'd get better if you
didn't keep stopping him.

00:17:41.061 --> 00:17:42.103 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
You're blaming me?

00:17:42.145 --> 00:17:42.937 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
I'm sorry!

00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:45.273 position:50% align:center
It's because I'm a stupid,
dumb, piece of trash.

00:17:45.315 --> 00:17:46.775 position:50% align:center
[YUKI, TENMA]
Nobody said that!

00:17:46.816 --> 00:17:48.985 position:50% align:center
Please forgive me.

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:55.033 position:50% align:center
[TENMA] I'll get your damn
water! Maybe this was a mistake.

00:17:55.075 --> 00:17:57.452 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] And that's the end,
lookie there.

00:17:57.494 --> 00:17:59.079 position:50% align:center
We got through the whole thing!

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.372 position:50% align:center
That was awful.

00:18:00.413 --> 00:18:03.667 position:50% align:center
Listen, your level of acting
will never reach mine.

00:18:03.708 --> 00:18:05.418 position:50% align:center
That goes double
for you, Sakisaka.

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.587 position:50% align:center
You can barely
even read your lines.

00:18:07.629 --> 00:18:09.172 position:50% align:center
Stop right now!

00:18:09.214 --> 00:18:11.466 position:50% align:center
You can't expect them
to be performance ready

00:18:11.508 --> 00:18:12.801 position:50% align:center
from the first read.

00:18:12.842 --> 00:18:13.760 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Yeah, but--

00:18:13.802 --> 00:18:16.471 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] As leader, you should
focus on trying to figure out

00:18:16.513 --> 00:18:20.475 position:50% align:center
how you can help improve
everyone's acting.

00:18:20.517 --> 00:18:24.062 position:50% align:center
What the hell? So, I'm to blame?

00:18:25.522 --> 00:18:28.775 position:50% align:center
I have confidence in you, Tenma.

00:18:28.817 --> 00:18:33.071 position:50% align:center
Well, I've had enough.
Keep rehearsing without me.

00:18:36.408 --> 00:18:39.994 position:50% align:center
[door opens, slams]

00:18:40.036 --> 00:18:41.746 position:50% align:center
Just like that?

00:18:41.788 --> 00:18:46.209 position:50% align:center
It'll be fine, ignore
his temper tantrum.

00:18:46.251 --> 00:18:49.337 position:50% align:center
Muku, let me see a smile.

00:18:49.379 --> 00:18:52.924 position:50% align:center
Here, this triangle
will make you happier.

00:18:52.966 --> 00:18:54.342 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
Oh.

00:18:58.138 --> 00:18:59.222 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:19:00.765 --> 00:19:03.226 position:50% align:center
Thank you. It's great.

00:19:04.394 --> 00:19:06.479 position:50% align:center
[TENMA] They couldn't act
to save their lives!

00:19:06.521 --> 00:19:08.898 position:50% align:center
And she wants me to figure out
how to help them?

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:11.484 position:50% align:center
No way is that possible.

00:19:11.526 --> 00:19:16.072 position:50% align:center
So lame, and why do I feel like
I did something wrong here?

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:21.870 position:50% align:center
None of this is my fault.

00:19:21.911 --> 00:19:23.830 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
Tenma? Oh, hey.

00:19:23.872 --> 00:19:27.917 position:50% align:center
What's up? I thought you'd
still be rehearsing.

00:19:27.959 --> 00:19:30.045 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
I'm done for the day.

00:19:30.086 --> 00:19:33.548 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
Cool, hope it was fun.

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:35.842 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Hey.

00:19:35.884 --> 00:19:38.511 position:50% align:center
So, aren't you the
Spring Troupe's leader?

00:19:38.553 --> 00:19:43.058 position:50% align:center
How'd that go? Was it easy?

00:19:43.099 --> 00:19:44.768 position:50% align:center
Sorry, what?

00:19:44.809 --> 00:19:48.938 position:50% align:center
I mean, did you guys have any
issues or fight with each other?

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:51.775 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah. It was pretty
tough at the beginning.

00:19:51.816 --> 00:19:55.153 position:50% align:center
This guy named Yuzo dropped by
and kind of tore us apart,

00:19:55.195 --> 00:19:57.405 position:50% align:center
so we were all super bummed.

00:19:57.447 --> 00:19:59.491 position:50% align:center
How did you manage
to bounce back?

00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:03.745 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA] Hm... The director gave
each one of us special tasks.

00:20:03.787 --> 00:20:05.997 position:50% align:center
So, you weren't the one
who took control?

00:20:06.039 --> 00:20:08.833 position:50% align:center
Well, no I just helped out.

00:20:08.875 --> 00:20:12.337 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
And everything resolved itself?

00:20:12.379 --> 00:20:15.340 position:50% align:center
We got better at communicating
once we got to know each other.

00:20:15.382 --> 00:20:17.217 position:50% align:center
So, our acting improved.

00:20:17.258 --> 00:20:19.511 position:50% align:center
You think that's it?

00:20:19.552 --> 00:20:23.348 position:50% align:center
Shouldn't people be focused
more on their own skills.

00:20:26.226 --> 00:20:29.229 position:50% align:center
I don't know if I
can explain it.

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:31.564 position:50% align:center
But that really is the
experience we all had,

00:20:31.606 --> 00:20:32.941 position:50% align:center
I promise.

00:20:32.982 --> 00:20:36.152 position:50% align:center
You can tell when everyone on
stage is completely engaged.

00:20:36.194 --> 00:20:39.864 position:50% align:center
Your heart pounds.
It's the best.

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:50.041 position:50% align:center
[TENMA] Heh. Can't believe
I'm saying this,

00:20:50.083 --> 00:20:54.295 position:50% align:center
but on closing night...
you guys were incredible.

00:20:54.337 --> 00:20:55.880 position:50% align:center
Oh, one more thing...

00:20:55.922 --> 00:20:57.257 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:19.696 --> 00:21:22.824 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] The Summer Troupe
has a lot to overcome.

00:21:22.866 --> 00:21:23.992 position:50% align:center
[knocking]

00:21:24.034 --> 00:21:25.076 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
It's me.

00:21:25.118 --> 00:21:28.204 position:50% align:center
Is that you, Tenma?

00:21:28.246 --> 00:21:30.206 position:50% align:center
It's late--is something wrong?

00:21:30.248 --> 00:21:32.250 position:50% align:center
As the leader,
I've come up with a plan

00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:34.085 position:50% align:center
to help our troupe
get along better.

00:21:34.127 --> 00:21:34.919 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:21:34.961 --> 00:21:38.673 position:50% align:center
It's a brilliant idea based
on my research. Ready?

00:21:38.715 --> 00:21:41.176 position:50% align:center
Sure. Well, let me hear it!

00:21:41.217 --> 00:21:46.973 position:50% align:center
From now on,
we'll all sleep together!

00:21:49.434 --> 00:21:50.602 position:50% align:center
What?

00:21:52.437 --> 00:21:53.646 position:50% align:center
What what?

00:21:53.688 --> 00:21:55.023 position:50% align:center
That's your big plan?

00:21:55.065 --> 00:22:00.445 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah. Like I said,
I did some research.

00:22:03.823 --> 00:22:06.951 position:50% align:center
It could work.

00:22:06.993 --> 00:22:09.329 position:50% align:center
That might be a fantastic idea!

00:22:09.371 --> 00:22:12.832 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:22:12.874 --> 00:22:16.544 position:50% align:center
Well obviously it is.
I thought of it.
