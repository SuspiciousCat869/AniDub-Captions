00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:15.807 position:50% align:center
Ahem. Introducing Yuki Rurikawa.
Our newest costume designer!

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.058 position:50% align:center
Greetings.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.685 position:50% align:center
She's gotta deep voice.

00:00:18.727 --> 00:00:19.561 position:50% align:center
She?

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:22.564 position:50% align:center
Or... I mean... I'll shut up.

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:23.565 position:50% align:center
You're a student?

00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:25.025 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Third year of middle school.

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.609 position:50% align:center
I sell my clothing online.

00:00:26.651 --> 00:00:29.154 position:50% align:center
In case you doubt
my qualifications.

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:31.573 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU] Third year, huh?
Don't you have entrance exams?

00:00:31.614 --> 00:00:35.076 position:50% align:center
I attend an escalator school.
Like it's your business.

00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:38.371 position:50% align:center
That's one sharp tongue.
You two related?

00:00:38.413 --> 00:00:41.541 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] From what I understand,
we have quite the deadline.

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:45.712 position:50% align:center
So, I wanted to stop by and see
what I had to work with.

00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:48.340 position:50% align:center
Reading from to top to bottom:
Energy Concentrate.

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:49.632 position:50% align:center
Villager C.

00:00:49.674 --> 00:00:50.884 position:50% align:center
Psycho Stalker.

00:00:50.925 --> 00:00:52.302 position:50% align:center
Foreign Swindler.

00:00:52.344 --> 00:00:54.012 position:50% align:center
Elite Swindler.

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:56.931 position:50% align:center
Right. Once I create
some initial designs,

00:00:56.973 --> 00:00:58.975 position:50% align:center
I'll grace you with
my presence again.

00:00:59.017 --> 00:00:59.893 position:50% align:center
Um, bye.

00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:02.020 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Ciao.

00:01:04.105 --> 00:01:07.317 position:50% align:center
He seemed... nice? Who's this?

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:10.111 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE] Presenting,
our house carpenter, Tetsuro!

00:01:10.153 --> 00:01:12.614 position:50% align:center
He's been helping the company
since the early days.

00:01:12.655 --> 00:01:15.200 position:50% align:center
A total maestro with
a hammer and nails.

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:17.369 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU]
Question. Does he ever talk?

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.496 position:50% align:center
What did you say?

00:01:19.537 --> 00:01:22.123 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Hilarious. Yeah.

00:01:22.165 --> 00:01:23.917 position:50% align:center
You should give standup
a try, Tetsuro!

00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:25.502 position:50% align:center
Now I have more questions.

00:01:25.543 --> 00:01:27.879 position:50% align:center
Man. I was kinda
nervous at first,

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:30.215 position:50% align:center
but all the pieces
are falling into place!

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:31.716 position:50% align:center
[ITARU]
Listen, guys.

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:34.344 position:50% align:center
I don't want to dampen the mood.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.641 position:50% align:center
But we need to talk.

00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:18.365 position:50% align:center
What? You're not seriously
thinking about quitting?

00:03:18.406 --> 00:03:19.324 position:50% align:center
'Fraid so.

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:21.701 position:50% align:center
But only quitters quit.

00:03:21.743 --> 00:03:23.203 position:50% align:center
Can you tell us why?

00:03:23.244 --> 00:03:24.829 position:50% align:center
Actually...

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:27.457 position:50% align:center
It's fine.

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:30.293 position:50% align:center
They have a right to know.

00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:33.421 position:50% align:center
The truth is... I joined
so I could save rent money

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:37.842 position:50% align:center
to spend on food and games.
I'm not really into theatre.

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:39.552 position:50% align:center
I thought I could play
a supporting role,

00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:41.304 position:50% align:center
but then I saw the
number of lines I had

00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:44.933 position:50% align:center
to memorize and how driven
the rest of you are.

00:03:44.974 --> 00:03:48.478 position:50% align:center
Bottom line, I'm the only one
who doesn't belong here.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.439 position:50% align:center
And the sooner we all
admit it, the better.

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:54.150 position:50% align:center
For the sake of everyone
in the troupe.

00:03:54.192 --> 00:03:56.194 position:50% align:center
I hope it's not too late.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:58.405 position:50% align:center
And you're able to find
someone to take my place.

00:03:58.446 --> 00:03:59.739 position:50% align:center
A real actor.

00:03:59.781 --> 00:04:01.950 position:50% align:center
You can't.

00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:05.120 position:50% align:center
All this time you had
no interest in theater?

00:04:05.161 --> 00:04:06.746 position:50% align:center
Wait, then why did you
keep showing up

00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:08.039 position:50% align:center
for morning rehearsal?

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:11.042 position:50% align:center
Not sure.

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:14.921 position:50% align:center
Though, I guess, seeing how
enthusiastic you all were,

00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:16.297 position:50% align:center
it kinda inspired me.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:17.173 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
Okay, but...

00:04:17.215 --> 00:04:19.676 position:50% align:center
Listen, my mind's made up.

00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:20.635 position:50% align:center
No way.

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:22.804 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI] Then stop wasting
our time and go.

00:04:22.846 --> 00:04:24.305 position:50% align:center
Dude, not helping.

00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:26.558 position:50% align:center
If he's not committed,
he should get off the stage.

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:29.144 position:50% align:center
Ugh, I sound like Yuzo.

00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:32.647 position:50% align:center
And I agree.
Better now than later.

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:36.234 position:50% align:center
And, hey, I'll still support
you guys after I'm gone.

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:39.279 position:50% align:center
That night we slept on the
stage--we made a promise!

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.448 position:50% align:center
How we were all in this
together till the end!

00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:43.908 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know. But I'm not
like the rest of you.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:44.826 position:50% align:center
I don't belong here.

00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:48.038 position:50% align:center
What if you found out theater
was more interesting than games?

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:49.831 position:50% align:center
Would you take it
seriously then?

00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:51.332 position:50% align:center
That's a bit of a stretch.

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:54.085 position:50% align:center
I mean, gaming is my
only real obsession.

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:55.920 position:50% align:center
One cannot deny, they truly are

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:57.589 position:50% align:center
the highest form
of entertainment.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.716 position:50% align:center
Theater has that power, too!

00:04:59.758 --> 00:05:03.553 position:50% align:center
See? You've got a love for
the stage I'll never have.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.813 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Itaru. I can tell you're
not entirely sure about that.

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:17.609 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't compare yourself
to others. Take my word.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.320 position:50% align:center
Everyone's passion for
theater is different.

00:05:20.362 --> 00:05:22.614 position:50% align:center
Anyway, the question
you ought to be asking

00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:24.824 position:50% align:center
is whether or not
you want to stay.

00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:27.994 position:50% align:center
And perform with
the others on stage.

00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:30.205 position:50% align:center
Pretend for a second
I don't leave.

00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:31.915 position:50% align:center
But then I back out later.

00:05:31.956 --> 00:05:33.875 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't that cause
everyone trouble?

00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:35.335 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:35.377 --> 00:05:38.004 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] That tells me you still
care about the performance.

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:39.255 position:50% align:center
And everyone in the troupe.

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:40.548 position:50% align:center
Maybe.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.675 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
If that's the case,

00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:43.927 position:50% align:center
stick around a
little bit longer!

00:05:43.968 --> 00:05:45.845 position:50% align:center
And if I don't change my mind?

00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:49.641 position:50% align:center
C'mon, no one wants
to take on that risk.

00:05:49.683 --> 00:05:52.560 position:50% align:center
I do. We'll make it work.

00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:56.981 position:50% align:center
For now... I need to think.

00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:09.202 position:50% align:center
Thing is, I know
it's impossible for me

00:06:09.244 --> 00:06:12.080 position:50% align:center
to work alongside
those guys and open up.

00:06:12.122 --> 00:06:15.458 position:50% align:center
I'm not any good at creating
long-lasting friendships.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.753 position:50% align:center
Also, no matter how hard I try,
I can't put my heart

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:20.964 position:50% align:center
and soul into theater
like Sakuya can.

00:06:21.006 --> 00:06:23.133 position:50% align:center
That's not my way.

00:06:27.262 --> 00:06:30.849 position:50% align:center
Dammit. You freakin' griefer.

00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:38.690 position:50% align:center
[SHOPKEEPER A]
Have a great day!

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:42.235 position:50% align:center
Please. Allow me, Director.

00:06:42.277 --> 00:06:44.571 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
If you insist.

00:06:44.612 --> 00:06:46.531 position:50% align:center
Next up is the store of drugs.

00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:47.574 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Uh, drugstore.

00:06:47.615 --> 00:06:49.576 position:50% align:center
[CITRON gasps]

00:06:49.617 --> 00:06:53.413 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Hm? You see something?

00:06:53.455 --> 00:06:58.752 position:50% align:center
[CITRON] It is nothing. Shall we
resume with our errands?

00:06:58.793 --> 00:07:04.215 position:50% align:center
Director, you are convinced
Itaru will remain in the troupe?

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:05.342 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:07:05.383 --> 00:07:07.385 position:50% align:center
I believe so, too.

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:10.096 position:50% align:center
Though, I understand
where he is coming from.

00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:11.222 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah?

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:12.682 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:07:12.724 --> 00:07:13.850 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
What is it?

00:07:13.892 --> 00:07:14.768 position:50% align:center
[CITRON]
Quickly!

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:19.522 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Huh? Why are we running?
Citron, where are we going?

00:07:19.564 --> 00:07:21.733 position:50% align:center
Aren't you going to answer me?

00:07:24.986 --> 00:07:29.824 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI panting]

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:32.077 position:50% align:center
All right, Citron.
Tell me what's happ--

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:35.413 position:50% align:center
[CITRON]
Shh! They're close.

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:37.040 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:07:38.917 --> 00:07:41.753 position:50% align:center
[sighs] At last, they're gone.

00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:42.754 position:50% align:center
Who's "they"?

00:07:42.796 --> 00:07:47.884 position:50% align:center
We should be safe now.
I didn't mean to frighten you.

00:07:47.926 --> 00:07:53.556 position:50% align:center
It's fine. Not to pry, but are
you in some kinda trouble?

00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:55.433 position:50% align:center
I have a confession to make.

00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:58.395 position:50% align:center
I didn't come here as
an exchange student.

00:07:58.436 --> 00:07:59.688 position:50% align:center
Then why are--

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:01.189 position:50% align:center
[CITRON]
I fled from my country.

00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:04.067 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Hm? You better
not be kidding around.

00:08:04.109 --> 00:08:08.988 position:50% align:center
Of this, I would not kid.
Perhaps, for everyone's sake,

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:11.491 position:50% align:center
it would be better if I
departed the Spring Troupe.

00:08:11.533 --> 00:08:13.034 position:50% align:center
But you can't quit.

00:08:13.076 --> 00:08:14.703 position:50% align:center
[CITRON]
I don't want to cause trouble.

00:08:14.744 --> 00:08:16.996 position:50% align:center
That's what I meant
earlier about Itaru.

00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:20.250 position:50% align:center
How I understood where
he was coming from.

00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:22.460 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] I'm sure everyone
would tell you the same thing

00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:26.631 position:50% align:center
they said to him. I would, too.

00:08:26.673 --> 00:08:29.467 position:50% align:center
[CITRON] I am at a loss.
How can you be so kind?

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:30.927 position:50% align:center
You're trying your best.

00:08:30.969 --> 00:08:33.096 position:50% align:center
I see you working hard
on your line delivery.

00:08:33.138 --> 00:08:36.016 position:50% align:center
Each day, your acting
gets stronger and stronger.

00:08:36.057 --> 00:08:38.977 position:50% align:center
Everybody thinks so.
They want you up there

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:42.063 position:50% align:center
on that stage,
standing right beside them.

00:08:44.315 --> 00:08:47.402 position:50% align:center
Itaru spoke true about
the Spring Troupe.

00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:49.279 position:50% align:center
How we were like close friends.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.781 position:50% align:center
While I think that's lovely,

00:08:51.823 --> 00:08:54.367 position:50% align:center
there are times I'm convinced
we're much dearer than that.

00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:57.287 position:50% align:center
And more like a family.

00:08:57.328 --> 00:08:58.413 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI laughs]

00:09:01.458 --> 00:09:04.919 position:50% align:center
Um. Really,
there's no need to bow.

00:09:04.961 --> 00:09:06.046 position:50% align:center
Shukran.

00:09:06.087 --> 00:09:09.132 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Hm? Sorry?

00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:11.134 position:50% align:center
[CITRON]
It means "thank you."

00:09:11.176 --> 00:09:16.681 position:50% align:center

I'll go get her! Wait!

C'mon, Mom!

And I think we figured out
how to make you stay.

Let's hear it.

00:11:32.233 --> 00:11:35.570 position:50% align:center

like a proper lead.

00:11:49.334 --> 00:11:51.086 position:50% align:center
Here's the deal.

00:11:51.127 --> 00:11:54.005 position:50% align:center

I'm so happy!

00:11:57.258 --> 00:11:59.177 position:50% align:center

Don't be late, guys.

Wow. Imagine that.

We can ditch this little town

And we can go as far as we like!

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:46.683 position:50% align:center
Maybe so.

00:12:46.725 --> 00:12:50.562 position:50% align:center
You've got brawn, Romeo,
and I've clearly got the brains.

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:51.938 position:50% align:center
Besides, one day,

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.733 position:50% align:center
this town's whole future
will hinge upon you.

00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:56.943 position:50% align:center
I haven't wanted to say, but
I'm worried about you, Julius.

[IZUMI] Good, everyone feels
natural... One thing left.

Everyone's worked so hard!

Shunt him up, didn't we?

00:13:24.095 --> 00:13:28.058 position:50% align:center
[YUZO] Although, that climax
isn't exciting enough.

00:13:28.099 --> 00:13:29.726 position:50% align:center
It's missing something.

00:13:29.768 --> 00:13:31.978 position:50% align:center
Are you saying it's
cause of the script?

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.688 position:50% align:center
No, but it does need tweaking.

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:36.358 position:50% align:center
Huh. What if you
added a swordfight?

00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:38.026 position:50% align:center
Maybe in one of the
scenes near the end?

00:13:38.068 --> 00:13:39.652 position:50% align:center
That would heighten the climax.

00:13:39.694 --> 00:13:41.029 position:50% align:center
I'm so in!

00:13:41.071 --> 00:13:43.656 position:50% align:center
But I'm not trained
in stage combat.

00:13:43.698 --> 00:13:46.409 position:50% align:center
Just leave it to me.
I'll train them personally.

Are you serious?

00:13:47.744 --> 00:13:50.830 position:50% align:center
[YUZO] Yeah! Guess your
enthusiasm's rubbed off on me.

00:13:50.872 --> 00:13:54.292 position:50% align:center

not gonna go easy on ya!

the sword fight is cut.

Why?

put on Sakuya right now.

all be for nothing, anyway,

[IZUMI]
What, on your own?

00:16:59.602 --> 00:17:01.229 position:50% align:center

having a sword fight

What are you talking abo--

00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:13.366 position:50% align:center
It's for the best. We could
keep the sword fight.

00:17:13.408 --> 00:17:15.994 position:50% align:center
Masumi, that's not how
any of this works!

00:17:16.036 --> 00:17:19.789 position:50% align:center
The old guy said we needed it.
Do you not trust him now?

00:17:19.831 --> 00:17:23.251 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA] No way. No way!
I'm not giving up!

00:17:23.293 --> 00:17:25.545 position:50% align:center
Romeo is still my part!

00:17:25.587 --> 00:17:28.048 position:50% align:center
Hey, chill. We'll work this out.

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:30.925 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
Work what out? I won't do it.

00:17:30.967 --> 00:17:32.969 position:50% align:center
I'm never giving up this role.

00:17:33.011 --> 00:17:33.845 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Don't worry...

00:17:33.887 --> 00:17:35.972 position:50% align:center
You expect too much of him.

00:17:36.014 --> 00:17:37.557 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI growls]

00:17:37.599 --> 00:17:43.480 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA] Let me keep trying.
I'll do my very best. I promise!

00:17:43.521 --> 00:17:46.941 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Okay. I'm fine with
giving the sword fight

00:17:46.983 --> 00:17:48.568 position:50% align:center
a little more time.

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:51.738 position:50% align:center
However, no overdoing
it in practice.

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.531 position:50% align:center
Don't forget,
part of an actor's job

00:17:53.573 --> 00:17:55.617 position:50% align:center
is to take care of their bodies.

00:17:55.658 --> 00:17:57.243 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:18:06.878 --> 00:18:11.341 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Sakuya. It's so late.
Whatcha doin'?

00:18:11.383 --> 00:18:14.678 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
Hey, I'm not that sleepy yet.

00:18:14.719 --> 00:18:17.514 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
I see.

00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:21.267 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA] Thing is, even
when I try my very hardest,

00:18:21.309 --> 00:18:24.312 position:50% align:center
it's like I end up
failing anyway.

00:18:24.354 --> 00:18:27.148 position:50% align:center
I'm scared that it's
happening again this time.

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:28.775 position:50% align:center
I don't want that.

00:18:28.817 --> 00:18:30.944 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
You're not failing on any level.

00:18:30.985 --> 00:18:33.655 position:50% align:center
We're just a little
short on rehearsal time.

00:18:33.697 --> 00:18:34.698 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
That isn't why.

00:18:34.739 --> 00:18:35.782 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Huh?

00:18:35.824 --> 00:18:37.992 position:50% align:center
Wish it was.

00:18:38.034 --> 00:18:42.122 position:50% align:center
But you know how I've always
lived with relatives?

00:18:42.163 --> 00:18:45.875 position:50% align:center
I think I told you.

00:18:45.917 --> 00:18:49.546 position:50% align:center
Any time I moved,
I tried really hard,

00:18:49.587 --> 00:18:51.047 position:50% align:center
hoping this time
it'd be different

00:18:51.089 --> 00:18:54.551 position:50% align:center
and I'd be able to open up
to them like a real family.

00:18:54.592 --> 00:18:57.846 position:50% align:center
But it never
worked out that way,

00:18:57.887 --> 00:19:02.434 position:50% align:center
I always get bounced
to the next relative.

00:19:02.475 --> 00:19:06.896 position:50% align:center
You see? I pretty much
fail at everything I do.

00:19:06.938 --> 00:19:09.441 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
I know that's not true.

00:19:09.482 --> 00:19:13.028 position:50% align:center
That's not how it works.
Relationships have two sides.

00:19:13.069 --> 00:19:16.698 position:50% align:center
There's no reason to think
you should take all the blame.

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:21.870 position:50% align:center
Thank you for that. You know,
when I was given Romeo,

00:19:21.911 --> 00:19:24.873 position:50% align:center
it felt like I had finally found
a place where I belonged.

00:19:24.914 --> 00:19:26.499 position:50% align:center
I was so happy.

00:19:26.541 --> 00:19:30.003 position:50% align:center
It made me feel acknowledged
as a troupe member.

00:19:30.045 --> 00:19:34.966 position:50% align:center
So, when I thought I was about
to lose all of that, it sucked.

00:19:35.008 --> 00:19:37.802 position:50% align:center
Of course.
So, tell me something.

00:19:37.844 --> 00:19:39.846 position:50% align:center
How'd you first get
interested in theater?

00:19:39.888 --> 00:19:43.433 position:50% align:center
The first time I saw a play,
in elementary school...

00:19:43.475 --> 00:19:46.770 position:50% align:center
The actors were great.
So full of life!

00:19:46.811 --> 00:19:49.522 position:50% align:center
They seemed just like
real pirates, to me.

00:19:49.564 --> 00:19:52.359 position:50% align:center
I was mesmerized!

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.028 position:50% align:center
And then,
the fire alarm went off.

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:58.907 position:50% align:center
Right in the middle of the show.

00:19:58.948 --> 00:20:03.203 position:50% align:center
Scallywags!
We're under naval attack!

00:20:03.244 --> 00:20:06.539 position:50% align:center
Time to retreat, me mateys!

00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:11.419 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
C'mon, ye know the drill!

00:20:15.757 --> 00:20:20.220 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA] And to this day,
I still remember those lines.

00:20:20.261 --> 00:20:22.722 position:50% align:center
The students, who had
been close to panic,

00:20:22.764 --> 00:20:26.810 position:50% align:center
all started evacuating under
the captain's orders.

00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:28.978 position:50% align:center
It was so exciting!

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:34.567 position:50% align:center
It felt like... I was a
part of a real pirate crew.

00:20:34.609 --> 00:20:37.278 position:50% align:center
Even when the actors
stepped off stage,

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:40.115 position:50% align:center
the story continued.

00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:44.828 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess the show
must go on, right? Always.

00:20:44.869 --> 00:20:48.623 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA] Right! The show
must go on, no matter what!

00:20:48.665 --> 00:20:50.875 position:50% align:center
You can't abandon it.

00:20:50.917 --> 00:20:54.462 position:50% align:center
I wanted a place where I
could belong, and a role.

00:20:54.504 --> 00:20:57.090 position:50% align:center
One I played well,
and could take pride in.

00:20:57.132 --> 00:20:59.926 position:50% align:center
Like those actors that day.

00:20:59.968 --> 00:21:02.470 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
I get it.

00:21:02.512 --> 00:21:05.223 position:50% align:center
Well, please don't worry.
This is your home.

00:21:05.265 --> 00:21:07.767 position:50% align:center
And you're the only one
who can pull this off!

00:21:07.809 --> 00:21:09.769 position:50% align:center
Everybody knows that's true.

00:21:09.811 --> 00:21:11.980 position:50% align:center
I mean, heck, think
about it, Itaru probably

00:21:12.022 --> 00:21:14.274 position:50% align:center
only stayed in the
play thanks to you.

00:21:14.315 --> 00:21:16.901 position:50% align:center
Nuh-uh. Everyone
helped convince him.

00:21:16.943 --> 00:21:20.363 position:50% align:center
They may have, but you did it.
And that's because Itaru can see

00:21:20.405 --> 00:21:23.950 position:50% align:center
how hard you work for
the sake of the group.

00:21:23.992 --> 00:21:25.744 position:50% align:center
Yes, ma'am.

00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:28.621 position:50% align:center
Are you feeling any differently
about the sword fight?

00:21:28.663 --> 00:21:31.750 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA] Sorry, I still
really want to do it.

00:21:31.791 --> 00:21:35.712 position:50% align:center
[laughs] You're a stubborn one,
for sure. Okay, then.

00:21:35.754 --> 00:21:38.840 position:50% align:center
You can keep working on it as
long as you're super careful.

00:21:38.882 --> 00:21:39.883 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
Thank you!

00:21:39.924 --> 00:21:42.844 position:50% align:center
Could I please try in
rehearsal again tomorrow?

00:21:42.886 --> 00:21:45.764 position:50% align:center
[CITRON] The walls have ears,
the doors have Iris,

00:21:45.805 --> 00:21:47.140 position:50% align:center
and behind you is Citron.

00:21:47.182 --> 00:21:49.476 position:50% align:center
Seems a little crowded
for my taste.

00:21:49.517 --> 00:21:51.728 position:50% align:center
If you're caught eavesdropping
in my country,

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:54.981 position:50% align:center
you'd be punished by saying a
tongue twister 300 times, fast.

00:21:55.023 --> 00:21:56.483 position:50% align:center
Well, you're guilty of it, too.

00:21:56.524 --> 00:21:59.819 position:50% align:center
Ooh, an accomplice.

00:21:59.861 --> 00:22:04.157 position:50% align:center
I knew nothing about him.
Till now.

00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:09.871 position:50% align:center
That's okay.
We're learning each other,

00:22:09.913 --> 00:22:11.956 position:50% align:center
and we've just begun.
