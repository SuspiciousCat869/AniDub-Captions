[heavy breathing]

00:00:26.067 --> 00:00:27.694 position:50% align:center
[door slams]

00:00:29.654 --> 00:00:31.656 position:50% align:center
Congrats on closing
the show, everybody!

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:34.993 position:50% align:center
You should be proud!

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:37.412 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Let's toast!
Sakuya was our lead.

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:39.748 position:50% align:center
How about he does us the honors.
Make it good!

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:41.124 position:50% align:center
What? It's up to me?

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.625 position:50% align:center
Yeah! You got this.

00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:45.003 position:50% align:center
But I've never given
a toast before.

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:46.588 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI]
Just get on with it, man.

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:47.505 position:50% align:center
[ITARU]
Say what you feel.

00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:49.132 position:50% align:center
[CITRON]
Take a deep breath and relapse.

00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:51.176 position:50% align:center
Sure, okay.

00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:54.387 position:50% align:center
For a while,

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:56.931 position:50% align:center
I was the only
Spring Troupe member.

00:00:56.973 --> 00:00:59.726 position:50% align:center
I thought that was fine,
and I'd be happy as long as

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:01.603 position:50% align:center
I was on the stage.

00:01:01.644 --> 00:01:03.813 position:50% align:center
But then the theater was in
danger of being shut down,

00:01:03.855 --> 00:01:06.649 position:50% align:center
and you guys joined up.

00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:09.110 position:50% align:center
And that made me
want to reach higher.

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:11.363 position:50% align:center
I wanted to become
a stronger actor.

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:16.534 position:50% align:center
So, we could put on the best
show, one we were proud of.

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:21.164 position:50% align:center
Honestly, closing night was
the best experience of my life.

00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:23.541 position:50% align:center
My heart was full of joy
on that stage.

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:25.752 position:50% align:center
I wanted to live in
that moment forever.

00:01:25.794 --> 00:01:27.629 position:50% align:center
Did you guys feel the same?

00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:28.630 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I did.

00:01:28.672 --> 00:01:29.923 position:50% align:center
Totally.

00:01:29.964 --> 00:01:31.800 position:50% align:center
I still have so much to learn.

00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:33.593 position:50% align:center
I hope that you'll
keep pushing me.

00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:36.388 position:50% align:center
And I want us to do even
better performances.

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:37.555 position:50% align:center
[CITRON]
Me, too!

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:38.932 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI]
Naturally.

00:01:38.973 --> 00:01:41.476 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
That's it. Cheers!

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:43.353 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Cheers!

00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:45.939 position:50% align:center
[glasses clinking]

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:49.192 position:50% align:center
I can't believe it.

00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:51.653 position:50% align:center
This night reminds me
so much of the old days.

00:01:51.695 --> 00:01:53.029 position:50% align:center
I'm just... so happy...

00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:55.031 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Next up will be the
Summer Troupe's performance,

00:01:55.073 --> 00:01:57.117 position:50% align:center
but I want you to
help support them.

00:01:57.158 --> 00:01:58.368 position:50% align:center
It's as you wish.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.121 position:50% align:center
We've still got three
successful shows to pull off.

00:02:01.162 --> 00:02:03.790 position:50% align:center
I'll do anything for you,
Director.

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:06.209 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] I'm counting on you
to write the script, Tsuzuru!

00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:07.043 position:50% align:center
Sound good?

00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:08.503 position:50% align:center
On it.

00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:10.755 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
So, what's the recruitment plan?

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:12.966 position:50% align:center
There were ads for
auditions on our flyers.

00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:14.384 position:50% align:center
And I scouted a few people

00:02:14.426 --> 00:02:16.511 position:50% align:center
who I thought had
strong potential.

00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:17.679 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
Oh yeah?

00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:19.097 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU]
Who'd you talk to?

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.850 position:50% align:center
Guess you'll see at
tomorrow's auditions.

00:03:59.155 --> 00:04:01.700 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE] Are you sure
anyone's gonna show?

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:03.660 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU]
How many people came last time?

00:04:03.702 --> 00:04:05.704 position:50% align:center
It was only Sakuya.

00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:08.707 position:50% align:center
Yup, and he accepted me
without asking any questions.

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:11.084 position:50% align:center
So irresponsible.

00:04:12.293 --> 00:04:14.129 position:50% align:center
Heya! What's up?

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.755 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Hi.

00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:18.008 position:50% align:center
I'm so happy you both
decided to come!

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.844 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU] Don't tell me these
are the ones you scouted.

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:23.179 position:50% align:center
I haven't decided if
I'll be joining yet.

00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:25.223 position:50% align:center
I need to hear your terms
before I commit.

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:28.435 position:50% align:center
But I'm all in. Sounds fun,
bet I'll nail acting.

00:04:28.476 --> 00:04:29.853 position:50% align:center
Dontcha think, Tsuzuroon?

00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:31.479 position:50% align:center
That isn't how this works! Ugh!

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:32.397 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
What gives?

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:34.691 position:50% align:center
Theater's a great way
to make friends!

00:04:34.733 --> 00:04:35.859 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
Um... Hello?

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.403 position:50% align:center
[CITRON] Yuki, you're competing
in this trial, too?

00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:41.489 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Hmm... Thing is, I don't
have much of an interest

00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:43.616 position:50% align:center
in stepping out onto the stage.

00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:45.535 position:50% align:center
But imagine how amazing
your costumes

00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:47.370 position:50% align:center
would look if you
designed for yourself!

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:49.539 position:50% align:center
You'd take the audience's
breath away.

00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:52.584 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] That is true. Plus,
if I knew more about acting,

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:54.085 position:50% align:center
it might help with
costume construction.

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:55.170 position:50% align:center
'S'cuse me...

00:04:55.211 --> 00:05:00.216 position:50% align:center
See? Be an actor and a designer.
You'll learn at ton.

00:05:00.258 --> 00:05:02.469 position:50% align:center
I suppose it wouldn't
hurt to try.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.722 position:50% align:center
Awesome! Those costumes for
<i>Romeo and Julius </i>were so rad!

00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:07.974 position:50% align:center
They looked freakin'
sweet in the spotlight.

00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:10.560 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid you're going to
have to take it down a notch.

00:05:10.602 --> 00:05:11.644 position:50% align:center
Hello!

00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:13.688 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:14.522 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI]
Yes?

00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:16.733 position:50% align:center
So sorry, I'm interrupting.

00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:17.650 position:50% align:center
It's you.

00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:21.029 position:50% align:center
I, um, am I in the right place?
For the try outs?

00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:23.406 position:50% align:center
Sakisaka,
you're auditioning, too?

00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:26.076 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Wait, Rurikawa?

00:05:26.117 --> 00:05:27.243 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
You know each other?

00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:28.870 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Same year in school,

00:05:28.912 --> 00:05:31.164 position:50% align:center
I had no idea you were
interested in theater.

00:05:31.206 --> 00:05:32.874 position:50% align:center
Oh. I'm not sure.

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:35.043 position:50% align:center
I thought I would audition
just to try it out.

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:38.129 position:50% align:center
But who am I kidding, I'll
probably embarrass myself.

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:39.589 position:50% align:center
Not many candidates,

00:05:39.631 --> 00:05:41.508 position:50% align:center
so I don't think we
can turn anyone away.

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:43.426 position:50% align:center
Why don't we go ahead
and get started.

00:05:43.468 --> 00:05:45.261 position:50% align:center
If you three will foll--

00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:46.888 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:52.102 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Gross. This joint's a dump.

00:05:52.143 --> 00:05:54.604 position:50% align:center
Ugh, I must have come
to the wrong address.

00:05:54.646 --> 00:05:56.690 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Are you looking for
troupe auditions?

00:05:56.731 --> 00:05:59.526 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's right. Who are you?

00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:02.821 position:50% align:center
I'm Tachibana,
the theater's director.

00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:04.239 position:50% align:center
You're kidding.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.199 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
And you are...

00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:07.492 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:12.789 position:50% align:center
Hold on a sec,
I've seen him on TV before!

00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:14.791 position:50% align:center
Tenma Sumeragi.

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:17.919 position:50% align:center
Whoa, a major celeb! Awesome!

00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:19.337 position:50% align:center
[MUKU gasping]

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:20.880 position:50% align:center
Who's he?

00:06:20.922 --> 00:06:22.298 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:25.176 --> 00:06:27.220 position:50% align:center
You seriously don't
recognize me?

00:06:27.262 --> 00:06:28.930 position:50% align:center
You from the boonies
or something?

00:06:28.972 --> 00:06:31.641 position:50% align:center
S'cuse me?

00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:35.478 position:50% align:center
--Tenten! Gimme your autograph!
--What'd you call me?

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.022 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
I don't mind signing for a fan.

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:38.648 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI] Yay! I'll take
ten for my crew, too!

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.235 position:50% align:center
Um, why don't we go ahead and
begin the audition process?

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:00.628 position:50% align:center
Is something wrong?

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:04.924 position:50% align:center
Nothing. This is fine.

00:07:04.966 --> 00:07:06.176 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Thank you all for coming.

00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:07.469 position:50% align:center
We'll start now.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.554 position:50% align:center
Would you please state
your name, age,

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:11.931 position:50% align:center
and what theater
experience you have.

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:15.560 position:50% align:center
Yuki Rurikawa. Third-year.
No acting experience.

00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:17.562 position:50% align:center
You mean third-year
of middle school?

00:07:17.604 --> 00:07:18.438 position:50% align:center
Yes, so what?

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.939 position:50% align:center
Learn to respect your elders.

00:07:19.981 --> 00:07:21.149 position:50% align:center
What?

00:07:21.191 --> 00:07:23.360 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's me,
I'm next, right here.

00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:25.362 position:50% align:center
Kazunari Miyoshi in the flesh.

00:07:25.403 --> 00:07:28.198 position:50% align:center
College sophomore
with nada stage work.

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:30.241 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Great. Next is--

00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:31.576 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's my turn.

00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:34.079 position:50% align:center
Muku Sakisaka.
I'm a third-year, too.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.331 position:50% align:center
Also, no theatre experience.

00:07:36.373 --> 00:07:40.710 position:50% align:center
What a crappy group of amateurs.
You call this an audition?

00:07:40.752 --> 00:07:42.587 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Finally, Tenma.

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:45.924 position:50% align:center
I introduced myself
earlier. Why bother?

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:47.550 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Humor us, please.

00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:50.095 position:50% align:center
We'd like to know about
your work on the stage.

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:54.724 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Tenma Sumeragi.
High school second-year.

00:07:54.766 --> 00:07:56.601 position:50% align:center
Fifteen years of
acting experience.

00:07:56.643 --> 00:07:59.396 position:50% align:center
But none in theater, there.

00:07:59.437 --> 00:08:00.855 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
None? Not one play?

00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:02.982 position:50% align:center
I'm more of a movie kinda guy.

00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:05.568 position:50% align:center
Wow! You're incredible.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.405 position:50% align:center
And aren't your parents
famous movie stars, too?

00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:10.490 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:08:10.532 --> 00:08:13.743 position:50% align:center
Next, I want you to complete
a simple acting challenge.

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:15.870 position:50% align:center
You're going to say "good
morning" four times,

00:08:15.912 --> 00:08:17.831 position:50% align:center
channeling a different
emotion with each read.

00:08:17.872 --> 00:08:21.167 position:50% align:center
Uh. We're doing that right here?

00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:24.087 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Is that okay?

00:08:25.588 --> 00:08:28.258 position:50% align:center
I guess that should be fine.

00:08:28.299 --> 00:08:30.218 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Let's start with Yuki.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.596 position:50% align:center
Of course. [inhales]

00:08:33.638 --> 00:08:36.933 position:50% align:center
Good morning.
Good morning...

00:08:36.975 --> 00:08:40.061 position:50% align:center
Good morning...
Good morning!

00:08:40.103 --> 00:08:41.354 position:50% align:center
Like that?

00:08:41.396 --> 00:08:43.231 position:50% align:center
He has solid stage presence.

00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:44.858 position:50% align:center
A child could meet
this challenge.

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:47.110 position:50% align:center
What? Seriously,
what's wrong with you?

00:08:47.152 --> 00:08:49.279 position:50% align:center
Tenma, keep your
opinions to yourself.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.072 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Hmph.

00:08:51.114 --> 00:08:52.699 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Kazunari, You're up now.

00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:54.617 position:50% align:center
On it!

00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:56.161 position:50% align:center
Good morning!

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:58.705 position:50% align:center
Good mor-n-ing.

00:08:58.747 --> 00:09:00.457 position:50% align:center
Good morning...

00:09:00.498 --> 00:09:01.791 position:50% align:center
Yo!

00:09:01.833 --> 00:09:04.085 position:50% align:center
He changed up the last line.

00:09:04.127 --> 00:09:05.587 position:50% align:center
I think he sounded good.

00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:07.589 position:50% align:center
Can't even follow instructions.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:08.548 position:50% align:center
Annoying.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.091 position:50% align:center
What? You say something?

00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:11.051 position:50% align:center
No, not a word.

00:09:11.092 --> 00:09:13.470 position:50% align:center
Quiet! Muku, show us your stuff.

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:15.972 position:50% align:center
Ah! Yes, ma'am!

00:09:16.014 --> 00:09:18.558 position:50% align:center
Good morning.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.894 position:50% align:center
It's kind of hard to hear you
when you talk so soft.

00:09:20.935 --> 00:09:22.437 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
I'm so sorry!

00:09:22.479 --> 00:09:27.525 position:50% align:center
There's no need to apologize.
Try again with confidence.

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:31.196 position:50% align:center
Good morning!
Good morning.

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:34.741 position:50% align:center
Uh, good morning.
Good morning?

00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:36.785 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:38.661 position:50% align:center
That was terrible, I know.

00:09:38.703 --> 00:09:39.579 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
What's wrong?

00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:41.539 position:50% align:center
The big shot over there
keeps sighing

00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:43.917 position:50% align:center
like we're ruining the lines.
He's such a hack.

00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.544 position:50% align:center
Hold up! Who the hell do you
think you're calling a hack.

00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:49.839 position:50% align:center
Wait! Calm down! This is all
because of my crappy acting.

00:09:49.881 --> 00:09:51.299 position:50% align:center
I knew I shouldn't
have even bothered

00:09:51.341 --> 00:09:52.258 position:50% align:center
to show up here today!

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.511 position:50% align:center
Nobody said you were bad.

00:09:54.552 --> 00:09:58.515 position:50% align:center
[laughs] One more left.
Go, Tenma.

00:09:59.683 --> 00:10:01.393 position:50% align:center
After all the sighing
and bragging,

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:04.312 position:50% align:center
you'd better be
no less than perfect.

00:10:05.397 --> 00:10:07.190 position:50% align:center
[TENMA sighs]

00:10:07.232 --> 00:10:10.276 position:50% align:center
Hurry up and say-- [gasps]

00:10:19.327 --> 00:10:20.995 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasping]

00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:22.747 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI gasps]

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:33.341 position:50% align:center
Hey. Good morning.

00:10:33.383 --> 00:10:35.051 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:35.093 --> 00:10:36.803 position:50% align:center
Good morning.

00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:39.347 position:50% align:center
Good morning...

00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:41.391 position:50% align:center
Good morning!

00:10:43.435 --> 00:10:45.770 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] He's not just
a strong performer.

00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:48.023 position:50% align:center
He's on a completely
different level.

00:10:48.064 --> 00:10:49.607 position:50% align:center
That kind of talent
is only gained

00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:54.237 position:50% align:center
through years of experience!
We've found ourselves a pro!

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:56.114 position:50% align:center
Tenten's got mad skills!

00:10:56.156 --> 00:10:58.992 position:50% align:center
Amazing, a real-life actor
is so impressive.

00:10:59.034 --> 00:11:00.827 position:50% align:center
Naturally.

00:11:01.953 --> 00:11:03.246 position:50% align:center
He's fine.

00:11:03.288 --> 00:11:04.205 position:50% align:center
Say what now?

00:11:04.247 --> 00:11:06.916 position:50% align:center
All right, you guys.
Auditions are over.

00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.710 position:50% align:center
What? That's everything?

00:11:08.752 --> 00:11:09.753 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
The results?

00:11:09.794 --> 00:11:11.046 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Everyone's in!

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:13.798 position:50% align:center
What? And that includes me?

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.800 position:50% align:center
Congrats on making
the cut, dudes.

00:11:15.842 --> 00:11:17.344 position:50% align:center
Now lemme get all your numbers.

00:11:17.385 --> 00:11:18.470 position:50% align:center
No freakin' way!

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:21.222 position:50% align:center
You expect me to work
alongside these try-hards?

00:11:21.264 --> 00:11:23.308 position:50% align:center
You heard her,
how arrogant can you be

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:24.351 position:50% align:center
you good-for-nothing hack?

00:11:24.392 --> 00:11:26.686 position:50% align:center
You say that word one
more time and I swear...

00:11:26.728 --> 00:11:28.563 position:50% align:center
Well, why don't you
read the room?

00:11:28.605 --> 00:11:29.564 position:50% align:center
Idiot!

00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:31.316 position:50% align:center
Hey, please don't fight.
We're good!

00:11:31.358 --> 00:11:33.526 position:50% align:center
We've got to get along
if we're a troupe.

00:11:33.568 --> 00:11:34.694 position:50% align:center
Don't those two remind you

00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:37.280 position:50% align:center
of how Masumi and
Tsuzuru act sometimes?

00:11:37.322 --> 00:11:39.407 position:50% align:center
Bickering couples who're
bound to be friends.

00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:41.743 position:50% align:center
We'll rake it in
promoting them as pairs!

00:11:41.785 --> 00:11:43.328 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Stay out of this!

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:45.038 position:50% align:center
[clapping]

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.414 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
That's enough.

00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:48.792 position:50% align:center
Everyone's in and
that's the final verdict.

00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:50.585 position:50% align:center
Tenma, if you have
a problem with that,

00:11:50.627 --> 00:11:52.712 position:50% align:center
you'll simply have
to quit the troupe.

00:11:52.754 --> 00:11:54.631 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
What? You're cutting me?

00:11:54.673 --> 00:11:59.010 position:50% align:center
I don't want to,
but those are your options.

00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:01.262 position:50% align:center
I get it. I'll stay, then.

00:12:01.304 --> 00:12:03.682 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI laughs]
By the way,

00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:08.103 position:50% align:center
why did you decide to
audition in the first place?

00:12:08.144 --> 00:12:11.189 position:50% align:center
I have no theater experience
and I wanted to fix that.

00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:12.649 position:50% align:center
Joining a troupe
like this seemed like

00:12:12.691 --> 00:12:16.736 position:50% align:center
a good way to start,
so here I am.

00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:21.032 position:50% align:center
Hopefully I'll expand my acting
repertoire while I'm here.

00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:24.244 position:50% align:center
I saw the last show you did.
It wasn't half bad.

00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:26.621 position:50% align:center
You mean you actually came and
watched <i>Romeo and Julius</i>?

00:12:26.663 --> 00:12:28.164 position:50% align:center
We really appreciate
your support!

00:12:28.206 --> 00:12:30.750 position:50% align:center
Uh. It's nothing.

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:31.960 position:50% align:center
Now, then.

00:12:32.002 --> 00:12:34.337 position:50% align:center
You're officially members
of the Summer Troupe.

00:12:34.379 --> 00:12:36.047 position:50% align:center
Let's work hard together.

00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:37.549 position:50% align:center
Aw yeah!

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.676 position:50% align:center
Thank you for accepting me.

00:12:39.718 --> 00:12:41.428 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure.

00:12:41.469 --> 00:12:45.765 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Don't have much choice.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.185 position:50% align:center
What? A show in three months?

00:12:49.227 --> 00:12:50.061 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:12:50.103 --> 00:12:52.564 position:50% align:center
There's a reason the troupes
are named after seasons.

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:54.566 position:50% align:center
Summer debuts in three months.

00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:57.944 position:50% align:center
With this hopeless group?
Not in a million years.

00:12:57.986 --> 00:12:59.446 position:50% align:center
I promise it's doable.

00:12:59.487 --> 00:13:02.365 position:50% align:center
Look at us. We started with
nothing, worked our butts off,

00:13:02.407 --> 00:13:04.409 position:50% align:center
and then opening night
was two months later!

00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:05.869 position:50% align:center
That's all it took?

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.287 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
It won't be easy.

00:13:07.328 --> 00:13:10.498 position:50% align:center
I'll be working your tails off
for the next 90-or-so days.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:11.708 position:50% align:center
No problem.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.376 position:50% align:center
I'll try my best.

00:13:13.418 --> 00:13:15.670 position:50% align:center
Am I going to regret this?

00:13:15.712 --> 00:13:18.590 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] It'd probably make sense
for us to talk dorms now.

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:21.634 position:50% align:center
I'll live here!
And crash with Tsuzuroon!

00:13:21.676 --> 00:13:22.802 position:50% align:center
Yeah, hard pass.

00:13:22.844 --> 00:13:24.888 position:50% align:center
Someone's excited.

00:13:24.929 --> 00:13:26.848 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Since the three
of you are still in school,

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:28.767 position:50% align:center
you can't live in the dorms
without permission

00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:30.268 position:50% align:center
from your parents.

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:32.103 position:50% align:center
I've talked it over with mine.

00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:33.980 position:50% align:center
They said they're
all right with it.

00:13:34.022 --> 00:13:35.148 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
That was fast.

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.317 position:50% align:center
They believe sending a
less-than-agreeable kid

00:13:37.359 --> 00:13:39.527 position:50% align:center
out into the world
will build character.

00:13:39.569 --> 00:13:42.447 position:50% align:center
Say what? That's silly,
you are super fun!

00:13:42.489 --> 00:13:43.531 position:50% align:center
Let's be roomies!

00:13:43.573 --> 00:13:44.407 position:50% align:center
Hard pass.

00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:46.743 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
Aw, even your sass is cute.

00:13:46.785 --> 00:13:50.205 position:50% align:center
[MUKU] I definitely want to stay
in the dorm if no one minds.

00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:51.581 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Of course.

00:13:51.623 --> 00:13:54.626 position:50% align:center
Though, if you live nearby,
you can also commute.

00:13:54.668 --> 00:13:58.088 position:50% align:center
[MUKU] No. I'd like to be here,
close to everyone.

00:13:58.129 --> 00:13:59.589 position:50% align:center
That way I can focus on getting

00:13:59.631 --> 00:14:02.467 position:50% align:center
more comfortable acting
with the troupe.

00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:03.718 position:50% align:center
That sounds great.

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.805 position:50% align:center
I'll try to get in touch with
your parents later on today.

00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:08.932 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Yes, ma'am.

00:14:08.973 --> 00:14:10.517 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
How 'bout you, Tenma?

00:14:10.558 --> 00:14:13.103 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'll board here.
I've got permission.

00:14:13.144 --> 00:14:15.146 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] I'll still need
some contact info.

00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:16.856 position:50% align:center
My parents are filming overseas,

00:14:16.898 --> 00:14:19.192 position:50% align:center
so you can't get ahold
of them right now.

00:14:19.234 --> 00:14:22.195 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU] Sounds kinda like
Masumi's family.

00:14:22.237 --> 00:14:25.740 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] I'll at least want to
leave a message.

00:14:25.782 --> 00:14:27.325 position:50% align:center
I guess.

00:14:29.536 --> 00:14:31.204 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Beds are two to a room.

00:14:31.246 --> 00:14:34.082 position:50% align:center
The Summer Troupe will split the
three dorms on the second floor.

00:14:34.124 --> 00:14:35.834 position:50% align:center
I'll let you decide how.

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:38.378 position:50% align:center
I refuse to share
a room with anyone.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:41.464 position:50% align:center
Did you not hear what she
just said? Or are you stupid?

00:14:41.506 --> 00:14:43.008 position:50% align:center
What?

00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:46.761 position:50% align:center
Yukki totally turned me down.
You wanna bunk with me, Mukkun?

00:14:46.803 --> 00:14:50.140 position:50% align:center
You really want to? Sure,
if you're okay with that.

00:14:50.181 --> 00:14:52.851 position:50% align:center
All right!
I got my own roommate!

00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:56.312 position:50% align:center
If that's settled, then why
don't you move into room 202.

00:14:56.354 --> 00:14:57.856 position:50% align:center
If you say so.

00:14:57.897 --> 00:15:00.608 position:50% align:center
This works out. If we split up
the other two dorms,

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:02.527 position:50% align:center
that means I don't have
to bunk with anyone.

00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:06.156 position:50% align:center
Yes, but we'll revisit this
if we gain any new members.

00:15:06.197 --> 00:15:07.741 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Dibs on 203.

00:15:07.782 --> 00:15:09.951 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Why do you get to pick first?

00:15:09.993 --> 00:15:11.703 position:50% align:center
I'm fine in 201, though.

00:15:11.745 --> 00:15:13.121 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Then why're you complaining?

00:15:13.163 --> 00:15:15.415 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Do you ever shut up?

00:15:15.457 --> 00:15:19.127 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't set foot in
room 203 if I were you.

00:15:19.169 --> 00:15:20.128 position:50% align:center
[BOTH yelp]

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:22.005 position:50% align:center
What're you talking about?

00:15:22.047 --> 00:15:24.716 position:50% align:center
Like any good theater troupe,
the Mankai Company

00:15:24.758 --> 00:15:27.594 position:50% align:center
believes whole-heartedly
in several urban legends.

00:15:27.635 --> 00:15:29.012 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Urban legends?

00:15:29.054 --> 00:15:33.058 position:50% align:center
It's true. Room 203 has been
empty for the longest time.

00:15:33.099 --> 00:15:36.019 position:50% align:center
But strange voices
wail from inside it!

00:15:36.061 --> 00:15:37.479 position:50% align:center
[wailing]

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.605 position:50% align:center
Uh!

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:40.482 position:50% align:center
I refuse to go in there.

00:15:40.523 --> 00:15:43.693 position:50% align:center
So, it also hasn't been cleaned
in who knows how long.

00:15:43.735 --> 00:15:47.572 position:50% align:center
Ugh. Can you imagine how much
dust and filth has piled up?

00:15:47.614 --> 00:15:50.742 position:50% align:center
Okay, that actually
is pretty scary.

00:15:50.784 --> 00:15:52.243 position:50% align:center
Hey, kid. Let's switch.

00:15:52.285 --> 00:15:54.788 position:50% align:center
That's so cute, you're
frightened by the ghost.

00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:56.623 position:50% align:center
No way, I never said that.

00:15:56.664 --> 00:15:57.916 position:50% align:center
Then why the change of heart,

00:15:57.957 --> 00:16:00.001 position:50% align:center
you're the one who
pounced on the room.

00:16:00.043 --> 00:16:01.127 position:50% align:center
Yours just calls to me.

00:16:01.169 --> 00:16:02.003 position:50% align:center
Sorry, no.

00:16:02.045 --> 00:16:03.380 position:50% align:center
It's not your choice.

00:16:03.421 --> 00:16:05.382 position:50% align:center
Don't forget that I'm
older than you.

00:16:05.423 --> 00:16:06.383 position:50% align:center
I care because?

00:16:06.424 --> 00:16:07.634 position:50% align:center
Have some respect.

00:16:07.676 --> 00:16:08.718 position:50% align:center
Try earning it.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.220 position:50% align:center
Calm down, you guys.

00:16:10.261 --> 00:16:13.014 position:50% align:center
Let's go check out this haunted
room ourselves, whaddya say?

00:16:13.056 --> 00:16:16.893 position:50% align:center
Right. I bet we don't find
anything too ghostly.

00:16:16.935 --> 00:16:19.020 position:50% align:center
I'll do that, sure.

00:16:19.062 --> 00:16:23.316 position:50% align:center
But if I hear strange voices,
I'm never gonna sleep in there.

00:16:23.358 --> 00:16:25.985 position:50% align:center
I'm used to more
sophisticated accommodations.

00:16:26.027 --> 00:16:28.947 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Gah, what a selfish brat.

00:16:42.752 --> 00:16:44.504 position:50% align:center
Do you hear any voices?

00:16:44.546 --> 00:16:46.798 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Mm... No, it's quiet.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.216 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
Look.

00:16:52.012 --> 00:16:53.638 position:50% align:center
What is this thing?

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.724 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI]
Triangle.

00:16:55.765 --> 00:16:56.933 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:00.562 --> 00:17:02.147 position:50% align:center
Was that...?

00:17:02.188 --> 00:17:03.898 position:50% align:center
It's like some kind of moan.

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:05.942 position:50% align:center
We got a full-fledged
haunted room!

00:17:05.984 --> 00:17:07.652 position:50% align:center
This'll be a killer post!

00:17:07.694 --> 00:17:10.447 position:50% align:center
Don't! What if you
catch it on camera?

00:17:10.488 --> 00:17:12.407 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Knew you were a scaredy-cat.

00:17:12.449 --> 00:17:15.660 position:50% align:center
Well, this doesn't technically
prove it's a ghost inside.

00:17:15.702 --> 00:17:16.745 position:50% align:center
An intruder then?

00:17:16.786 --> 00:17:17.579 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:20.040 position:50% align:center

That's not much better!

00:17:20.081 --> 00:17:21.666 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:23.752 --> 00:17:25.170 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
You should open it.

00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:27.672 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Hell, no!

00:17:27.714 --> 00:17:28.798 position:50% align:center

00:17:34.721 --> 00:17:38.183 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] We can't use this room
if we don't know what's inside.

00:17:38.224 --> 00:17:40.477 position:50% align:center
We have to see.

00:17:40.518 --> 00:17:43.146 position:50% align:center
Leave it to me!
I'll handle this!

00:17:43.188 --> 00:17:44.856 position:50% align:center
Oh, thanks, Manager!

00:17:46.274 --> 00:17:48.777 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE] Masumi will be your
twenty-four-hour security guard.

00:17:48.818 --> 00:17:50.403 position:50% align:center
He'll protect you!

00:17:50.445 --> 00:17:51.780 position:50% align:center
What is this?

00:17:51.821 --> 00:17:53.656 position:50% align:center
We heard some strange
sounds in there.

00:17:53.698 --> 00:17:55.283 position:50% align:center
So, we wanted to take a peek.

00:17:55.325 --> 00:17:57.035 position:50% align:center
I'll inspect the room.

00:17:57.077 --> 00:17:59.579 position:50% align:center
You stay back here
where it's safe.

00:18:02.207 --> 00:18:03.541 position:50% align:center
Please be careful.

Let go. You're
crushing me, moron!

Holy crap!
It's a ghost, for real!

[MISUMI]
Behold the wonder of onigiri!

00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:30.735 position:50% align:center
So, it's an onigiri ghost?

00:18:30.777 --> 00:18:33.405 position:50% align:center
Quick! Somebody
exorcise this demon!

00:18:34.364 --> 00:18:37.575 position:50% align:center
Triangles. I bet you
want some of them, too.

00:18:37.617 --> 00:18:40.036 position:50% align:center
Hey, man.
You got a name or what?

'Course I do.
I'm Misumi Ikaruga.

It's a human?

00:18:48.503 --> 00:18:50.296 position:50% align:center
A squatter.

00:18:50.338 --> 00:18:53.633 position:50% align:center

I think you're right about that.

00:18:53.675 --> 00:18:54.968 position:50% align:center
Why the trash?

baby is one of my treasures.

How long have you lived here?

00:19:01.808 --> 00:19:04.811 position:50% align:center

all started your rehearsals.

How did I never realize this?

00:19:09.024 --> 00:19:12.318 position:50% align:center

so it was easy to get in.

But we're on the second floor.

you furnish this place?

he's an intruder!

How can he jump
around like that?

Who is this new person?

00:20:38.405 --> 00:20:40.865 position:50% align:center
Hi! The name's Misumi.

00:20:40.907 --> 00:20:43.910 position:50% align:center
First question, why were you
living in one of our dorms?

00:20:43.952 --> 00:20:46.287 position:50% align:center
Simple, I had
nowhere else to go.

00:20:46.329 --> 00:20:48.498 position:50% align:center
Great. It's time
to call the police.

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:51.042 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] I have something else
to ask. Do you like theater?

00:20:51.084 --> 00:20:52.293 position:50% align:center
Director?

00:20:52.335 --> 00:20:53.795 position:50% align:center
Hold on a second.

00:20:53.837 --> 00:20:55.422 position:50% align:center
This is crazy.

00:20:55.463 --> 00:20:56.715 position:50% align:center
Kick the creep out.

00:20:56.756 --> 00:20:59.175 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah. I guess so.

00:20:59.217 --> 00:21:00.593 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Want to try it out?

00:21:00.635 --> 00:21:03.221 position:50% align:center
Then you can stay in that
room and not have to hide.

00:21:03.263 --> 00:21:05.015 position:50% align:center
Would I get to eat onigiri?

00:21:05.056 --> 00:21:06.391 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Yeah!

00:21:06.433 --> 00:21:08.059 position:50% align:center
Then, yeah!

00:21:08.101 --> 00:21:10.478 position:50% align:center
Don't blame me
when this backfires.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.439 position:50% align:center
I have to work beside
this weirdo?

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.899 position:50% align:center
It's, uh, really
nice to meet you?

00:21:14.941 --> 00:21:20.655 position:50% align:center
Doesn't make sense to me,
but whatevs. Sup, Sumi!

00:21:20.697 --> 00:21:22.532 position:50% align:center
This certainly took
a strange turn.

00:21:22.574 --> 00:21:24.617 position:50% align:center
Awesome. Now you've
got five members!

I foresee trouble ahead.

00:21:29.873 --> 00:21:32.459 position:50% align:center
So, how are we gonna
be splitting up rooms?

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.252 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
How about Tenma and Misumi

00:21:34.294 --> 00:21:35.587 position:50% align:center

Hey. So, can I have another
of those onigiri?

00:21:40.091 --> 00:21:42.052 position:50% align:center
In celebration of
the Summer Troupe,

00:21:42.093 --> 00:21:45.013 position:50% align:center

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:47.932 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI]
Thank you!

00:21:47.974 --> 00:21:50.977 position:50% align:center
Do you all like triangles?
Raise your hand if you do...

00:21:51.019 --> 00:21:52.479 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Okay, lady pants.

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.272 position:50% align:center
I'll put up with you
as a roommate.

00:21:54.314 --> 00:21:56.483 position:50% align:center
If it's that much of a hassle,
you could drop out

00:21:56.524 --> 00:21:58.777 position:50% align:center
and not have to
"put up" with anything!

00:21:58.818 --> 00:22:03.073 position:50% align:center
Not so fast! I don't care
what you say, I'm in 201.

00:22:03.114 --> 00:22:05.241 position:50% align:center
Don't just call it
without asking, hack!

00:22:05.283 --> 00:22:06.117 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
What?

00:22:06.159 --> 00:22:07.827 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Stop following me!
That simple!

00:22:07.869 --> 00:22:08.703 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
You're following me!

00:22:08.745 --> 00:22:11.039 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
I'm worried about those two.

00:22:11.081 --> 00:22:14.959 position:50% align:center
But I have a feeling things
might end up working out.

--Damn right!
