You're still awake?

[gasps]

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.542 position:50% align:center
I couldn't sleep. You, too?

00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:44.336 position:50% align:center
I know he said he'd
convince his dad,

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:46.296 position:50% align:center
but will he be able
to pull that off?

00:00:46.338 --> 00:00:49.049 position:50% align:center
And what happens if he fails?

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.759 position:50% align:center
Well then,
I guess he'll drop out.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.593 position:50% align:center
He can't!

00:00:51.634 --> 00:00:54.846 position:50% align:center
Not after all five of us have
worked so hard to get here!

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:57.307 position:50% align:center
A waste of good costumes.

00:00:57.349 --> 00:01:01.770 position:50% align:center
Honestly, what does that idiot
even think he was doing?

00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:03.188 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.609 position:50% align:center

Tenma!

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.194 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:12.906 position:50% align:center
I'm back, guys.

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:45.665 position:50% align:center
That's friggin' cold.

00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:46.916 position:50% align:center
You doin' okay?

00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.085 position:50% align:center
Aw, man, that bruise
looks painful.

00:02:49.127 --> 00:02:51.087 position:50% align:center
I for one think
you wear it well.

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.048 position:50% align:center
Anyway, how did
your conversation

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:54.841 position:50% align:center
with your dad turn out?

00:02:54.883 --> 00:02:58.261 position:50% align:center
Obviously, he gave me
a pretty good smack.

00:02:58.303 --> 00:03:00.138 position:50% align:center
[MUKU] For joining a troupe
without telling him?

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.600 position:50% align:center
No, for walking away from the
movie offer without asking.

00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:05.852 position:50% align:center
I had to apologize for that.

00:03:05.894 --> 00:03:08.772 position:50% align:center
But once I did, he was
willing to hear me out.

00:03:08.813 --> 00:03:10.273 position:50% align:center
I talked him into it.

00:03:10.315 --> 00:03:12.233 position:50% align:center
[GROUP grunts]

00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:14.736 position:50% align:center
If I really want to move
forward in my acting career,

00:03:14.778 --> 00:03:17.405 position:50% align:center
doing this play
is a crucial step.

00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:20.617 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] True, onstage experience
is pretty important.

00:03:20.658 --> 00:03:24.746 position:50% align:center
[TENMA] Yeah. There's something
I haven't told you guys yet.

00:03:24.788 --> 00:03:26.873 position:50% align:center
And what's that?

00:03:26.915 --> 00:03:29.793 position:50% align:center
I have acted onstage before.

00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:34.297 position:50% align:center
In a play for the arts festival
back in elementary school.

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:38.301 position:50% align:center
I already had experience in
TV and movies by that point.

00:03:38.343 --> 00:03:40.011 position:50% align:center
And so I figured a
school play wouldn't be

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:42.013 position:50% align:center
any big deal in comparison.

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:44.391 position:50% align:center
[TENMA laughs]

00:03:44.432 --> 00:03:45.308 position:50% align:center
[applause]

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.476 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
But then...

00:03:46.518 --> 00:03:47.977 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:54.484 position:50% align:center
[TENMA] My mind went blank.
I forgot every line.

00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:57.320 position:50% align:center
I just stood there frozen
in the spotlight.

00:03:57.362 --> 00:04:01.032 position:50% align:center
With the whole crowd
staring at me in silence.

00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:08.373 position:50% align:center
[TENMA] And after what
felt like an eternity,

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:10.792 position:50% align:center
the curtain finally closed.

00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:15.171 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Everyone around me

00:04:15.213 --> 00:04:17.132 position:50% align:center
was still supportive after that.

00:04:17.173 --> 00:04:19.467 position:50% align:center
They encouraged me and told me
it was only because

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:20.760 position:50% align:center
I'd been working so much.

00:04:20.802 --> 00:04:23.972 position:50% align:center
But I never screwed up
like that at work.

00:04:24.014 --> 00:04:26.016 position:50% align:center
Since then, the feeling
of humiliation

00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:28.685 position:50% align:center
comes back anytime
I step onto stage.

00:04:28.727 --> 00:04:30.687 position:50% align:center
I never accepted
another role in a play

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.605 position:50% align:center
because I'm afraid
it'll happen again.

00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:34.357 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
So, your nerves get to you?

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:36.359 position:50% align:center
"Nerves" isn't the right word.

00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:39.988 position:50% align:center
It's fear. Maybe I'm
just a big coward.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.989 position:50% align:center
So that's it.

00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:43.074 position:50% align:center
<i>You </i>get scared?

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:44.284 position:50% align:center
When you're acting on camera,

00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:45.994 position:50% align:center
they can record a
scene several times

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:47.996 position:50% align:center
and cut all the
good takes together.

00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:50.123 position:50% align:center
The audience will
always get to experience

00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:52.292 position:50% align:center
the best performance
you can give.

00:04:52.334 --> 00:04:55.879 position:50% align:center
But onstage, you've only got
one chance to get it right.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.590 position:50% align:center
And that moment is the only
performance they see.

00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:01.301 position:50% align:center
That suddenly hit me
during my school play,

00:05:01.343 --> 00:05:03.470 position:50% align:center
and it was terrifying.

00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:04.429 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:06.306 position:50% align:center
You feel that if there
are people watching,

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:09.726 position:50% align:center
you should be showing them your
best performance every time.

00:05:09.768 --> 00:05:11.603 position:50% align:center
You're not a coward,
you're a professional

00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:14.022 position:50% align:center
and that means you hold
yourself to a higher standard.

00:05:14.064 --> 00:05:17.150 position:50% align:center
Which is the perfect attitude
for a working actor to have.

00:05:17.192 --> 00:05:17.984 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Either way,

00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:21.905 position:50% align:center
if I want to move forward,
I have to overcome this fear.

00:05:21.946 --> 00:05:25.992 position:50% align:center
So please let me take
the stage with all of you.

00:05:26.034 --> 00:05:27.077 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
Tenma.

00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:28.828 position:50% align:center
Glad you're here.

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.165 position:50% align:center
You can work on your
monologue later, hack.

00:05:32.207 --> 00:05:35.502 position:50% align:center
We obviously weren't gonna
drop you if you came back here.

00:05:35.543 --> 00:05:37.796 position:50% align:center
I mean c'mon, Tenma,
you're our leader.

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:40.840 position:50% align:center
Surely you didn't think
we would really just--

00:05:40.882 --> 00:05:42.217 position:50% align:center
What is that face?

00:05:42.258 --> 00:05:44.761 position:50% align:center
I think you called me by
my first name just now.

00:05:44.803 --> 00:05:45.762 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Seriously?

00:05:45.804 --> 00:05:47.722 position:50% align:center
Tenten. You're still
part of the crew

00:05:47.764 --> 00:05:51.142 position:50% align:center
and we're still doing this play.
We can't perform it without you.

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:52.852 position:50% align:center
Yeah, since we started
working with you,

00:05:52.894 --> 00:05:56.314 position:50% align:center
I feel like we've all
grown so much as actors.

00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:04.406 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI] Tenma.
May this grant you courage.

00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:07.117 position:50% align:center
It's a pointy-triangle
someone left on the road!

00:06:07.158 --> 00:06:09.285 position:50% align:center
[TENMA] Go put that thing
back where you found it!

00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:10.662 position:50% align:center
Aww.

00:06:10.704 --> 00:06:13.790 position:50% align:center
[GROUP laughs]

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.379 position:50% align:center
I appreciate it, everyone.

00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:22.048 position:50% align:center
Glad to be working
with you again, Yuki.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.426 position:50% align:center
My first name? Stop that.

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:26.553 position:50% align:center
Wait, what?
But you just used mine!

00:06:26.594 --> 00:06:30.557 position:50% align:center
A hack and a liar.
It just keeps getting worse.

00:06:30.598 --> 00:06:34.227 position:50% align:center
I'm positive you can
overcome your fear, Tenma.

00:06:35.645 --> 00:06:36.813 position:50% align:center
Yeah, thanks.

00:06:36.855 --> 00:06:38.898 position:50% align:center
Not everybody who comes
to watch a play

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.609 position:50% align:center
is going to see the same,
perfect performance.

00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:44.821 position:50% align:center
But you can give
your best every time.

00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:47.032 position:50% align:center
What's that mean?

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:49.701 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] It'll make sense
once you're onstage.

00:06:49.743 --> 00:06:52.579 position:50% align:center
We still have a troupe, so
let's get those tickets sold!

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.539 position:50% align:center
Can I add this as a bonus?

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:55.999 position:50% align:center
--[YUKI] No.

That's priceless.

That's great! The freaks
always find each other.

There's no café,
but there is a performance.

Here's a flyer in case
you're interested.

00:08:16.705 --> 00:08:17.997 position:50% align:center
It's a play?

[YUKI]
That's right.

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:25.422 position:50% align:center
So, I will spin another
tale for you tonight.

00:08:25.463 --> 00:08:31.011 position:50% align:center
One of a thousand stories to
captivate any imagination.

What the heck?

00:08:35.223 --> 00:08:37.142 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Does that give you the idea?

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:39.394 position:50% align:center
Now, take one of these
flyers and don't forget

00:08:39.436 --> 00:08:41.730 position:50% align:center
to show up on closing night.

00:08:41.771 --> 00:08:44.941 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Uh, I mean,
that might be okay.

00:08:44.983 --> 00:08:48.445 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. It's not a
crossdressing café or whatever.

00:08:48.486 --> 00:08:49.863 position:50% align:center
So, it's fine.

00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:52.866 position:50% align:center

Hey, Yuki.

00:09:00.999 --> 00:09:03.084 position:50% align:center

I need a breather.

00:09:03.126 --> 00:09:05.337 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
Uh, sure.

00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:18.099 position:50% align:center
You were seriously awesome
back there, Yuki.

00:09:18.141 --> 00:09:20.226 position:50% align:center
Wait, what? Come on.

00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:21.353 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
For real.

00:09:21.394 --> 00:09:24.731 position:50% align:center
I just... did what I saw
those God Troupe guys doing.

00:09:24.773 --> 00:09:28.568 position:50% align:center
I know, but you
did it really well.

00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:32.822 position:50% align:center
And it looked so cool.

00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:39.829 position:50% align:center
I guess. Could you
come here a sec?

00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:41.456 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
Yeah.

00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:50.799 position:50% align:center
Those two guys came
at you out of nowhere,

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.051 position:50% align:center
but you didn't back down.
That's the kind of thing

00:09:53.093 --> 00:09:55.762 position:50% align:center
that makes me look
up to you so much.

00:09:55.804 --> 00:10:00.642 position:50% align:center
Okay, enough already.
I believe you.

00:10:00.684 --> 00:10:03.103 position:50% align:center
That's good.

00:10:03.144 --> 00:10:04.771 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Thank you.

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:11.528 position:50% align:center
Anytime. Let's give
this our best, okay?

00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:13.488 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
For sure.

00:10:19.077 --> 00:10:21.162 position:50% align:center
--[knocking]
--Uh.

00:10:21.204 --> 00:10:22.831 position:50% align:center
Hello?

00:10:23.832 --> 00:10:26.418 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
Tenten, what's up?

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:28.211 position:50% align:center
Put me on the site.

00:10:28.253 --> 00:10:30.046 position:50% align:center
Let people know I'm in the show.

00:10:30.088 --> 00:10:31.423 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
Wait, for real?

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:33.133 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:35.427 position:50% align:center
[keyboard clacking]

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:38.388 position:50% align:center
Let's see here,
Tenma Sumeragi.

00:10:40.598 --> 00:10:42.684 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Yeah, update it.

00:10:42.726 --> 00:10:45.770 position:50% align:center
Okay. Then here we go!

00:10:49.691 --> 00:10:53.236 position:50% align:center
There, going live right... now!

00:10:54.237 --> 00:10:58.033 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE]
Director! We're doing too good!

00:10:58.074 --> 00:11:00.660 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna need you
to elaborate on that.

00:11:00.702 --> 00:11:01.870 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE]
Here's the thing.

00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:04.122 position:50% align:center
We suddenly got a huge
spike in ticket sales.

00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:07.334 position:50% align:center
Huge as in we're
totally sold out now.

00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:08.668 position:50% align:center
Sold out?

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.545 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE] It couldn't have been
more than ten minutes.

00:11:10.587 --> 00:11:12.714 position:50% align:center
Every seat for the entire run!

00:11:12.756 --> 00:11:14.841 position:50% align:center
We're sold through
closing night!

00:11:14.883 --> 00:11:17.344 position:50% align:center
So does that mean that they...?

00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:21.639 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI]
Look, he added more triangles!

00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:25.101 position:50% align:center
Wow, having a big name attached
to us got a lot of ticket sales!

00:11:25.143 --> 00:11:26.603 position:50% align:center
Who would have guessed?

00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:27.687 position:50% align:center
[phone ringing]

00:11:27.729 --> 00:11:30.857 position:50% align:center
Eh? Hello, you've reached
the Mankai Company.

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:32.984 position:50% align:center
Pardon. You want an interview?

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:36.488 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes, I can fax you the
details for the dress rehearsal!

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:39.449 position:50% align:center
Great. Looking forward to it!

00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:42.994 position:50% align:center
--[phone ringing]
--Hello? Of course!

00:11:43.036 --> 00:11:45.497 position:50% align:center
If you need me to
send you another copy

00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:46.790 position:50% align:center
of the info for
our dress rehearsal...

00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:49.042 position:50% align:center
Jeez, everything's going
completely insane.

00:11:49.084 --> 00:11:51.294 position:50% align:center
Phone's ringing off the hook.

00:11:51.336 --> 00:11:54.214 position:50% align:center
I bet they really like
talking to Isuke.

00:11:54.255 --> 00:11:56.675 position:50% align:center
Well then, it seems the press
will be in attendance.

00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:59.219 position:50% align:center
But what matters most is putting
the finishing touches

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:00.804 position:50% align:center
on our dress rehearsal!

00:12:00.845 --> 00:12:02.681 position:50% align:center
--Got it!
--Yes, ma'am!

00:12:07.185 --> 00:12:09.646 position:50% align:center
[REPORTER D] I've seen lots of
Tenma Sumeragi onscreen,

00:12:09.688 --> 00:12:11.940 position:50% align:center
but I never expected him
to take the stage.

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:12.899 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know.

00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:15.318 position:50% align:center
Lotta people looking
forward to this day.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.821 position:50% align:center
[REPORTER D] I can't wait
to see what he's got.

00:12:17.862 --> 00:12:21.825 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI] Oh, crap.
That's a whole lotta cameras.

00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:24.327 position:50% align:center
[MUKU] It's like something
you'd see on TV.

00:12:24.369 --> 00:12:25.995 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI]
There's so many people!

00:12:26.037 --> 00:12:29.332 position:50% align:center
So, is this normal for you?

00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:30.500 position:50% align:center
You with us?

00:12:30.542 --> 00:12:31.710 position:50% align:center
What--?

00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:34.254 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Are you going
into hack mode again?

00:12:34.295 --> 00:12:35.171 position:50% align:center
Uh, right.

00:12:35.213 --> 00:12:37.132 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
What's that mean?

00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:40.010 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Tenma, you okay?

00:12:40.051 --> 00:12:42.929 position:50% align:center
It's time, guys.
Get to your places!

00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:46.850 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Right, right!
It's almost go-time.

00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:48.560 position:50% align:center
Look alive.

00:12:53.481 --> 00:12:56.151 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE] On behalf of Mankai
Company's Summer Troupe:

00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:58.611 position:50% align:center
Welcome! Thank you
all for coming.

00:12:58.653 --> 00:13:01.031 position:50% align:center
Without further ado,
we are proud to present

00:13:01.072 --> 00:13:05.201 position:50% align:center

[applause]

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.764 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] I will spin another
tale for you tonight.

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:31.227 position:50% align:center
One of a thousand stories
to captivate any imagination.

00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:33.229 position:50% align:center
His name is Ali Baba.

00:13:33.271 --> 00:13:34.647 position:50% align:center
A hardworking young man

00:13:34.689 --> 00:13:37.859 position:50% align:center
who dreams living a life
of luxury one day.

00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:39.569 position:50% align:center
And my name is...

00:13:39.611 --> 00:13:42.947 position:50% align:center
[TENMA gasps]

00:13:42.989 --> 00:13:43.823 position:50% align:center
Your cue!

00:13:43.865 --> 00:13:46.284 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:46.326 --> 00:13:48.536 position:50% align:center
Oh, tell me, Scheherazade.

00:13:48.578 --> 00:13:51.748 position:50% align:center
Tell me where I can find
the legendary Oasis!

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:54.542 position:50% align:center
If you truly wish to know,
then so be it.

00:13:54.584 --> 00:13:58.004 position:50% align:center
Long ago, there was
a faraway land--

00:13:58.046 --> 00:14:02.175 position:50% align:center
Stop. Don't talk fancy,
get on with it!

00:14:02.217 --> 00:14:06.596 position:50% align:center
Aladdin. Magic lamp. Magician.

00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:11.434 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Sinbad?

00:14:11.476 --> 00:14:13.436 position:50% align:center
How do you not know where
the gold is hidden,

00:14:13.478 --> 00:14:15.230 position:50% align:center
aren't you supposed
to be the hero?

00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:17.774 position:50% align:center
Uh. Come on, grow up, Ali Baba.

00:14:17.816 --> 00:14:21.695 position:50% align:center
There is no legendary paradise
to find. You're not going to...

00:14:21.736 --> 00:14:23.405 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
They're too worried about Tenma

00:14:23.446 --> 00:14:26.908 position:50% align:center
to focus on their performances.

00:14:30.912 --> 00:14:32.664 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
This is an important scene.

00:14:32.706 --> 00:14:36.751 position:50% align:center
Scheherazade's about to
confess the truth to Ali Baba.

00:14:36.793 --> 00:14:38.920 position:50% align:center
I've stalled for as
much time as I can,

00:14:38.962 --> 00:14:41.464 position:50% align:center
but I'm afraid
my hands are tied.

00:14:41.506 --> 00:14:44.551 position:50% align:center
I must soon join
the king's harem.

00:14:44.592 --> 00:14:46.970 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Is that...?

00:14:47.012 --> 00:14:48.680 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:53.852 --> 00:14:55.145 position:50% align:center
[gasps] No.

00:14:55.186 --> 00:14:57.689 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
He's blanking out?

00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:00.775 position:50% align:center
C'mon, Tenten!

00:15:00.817 --> 00:15:02.485 position:50% align:center
You got this.

00:15:02.527 --> 00:15:03.403 position:50% align:center
[REPORTER C]
What's up?

00:15:03.445 --> 00:15:06.531 position:50% align:center
[REPORTER A]
Is this on purpose?

00:15:06.573 --> 00:15:10.744 position:50% align:center
It's quite shocking, I know.
You need a moment, don't you?

00:15:10.785 --> 00:15:12.746 position:50% align:center
Yeah, nice cover!

00:15:12.787 --> 00:15:15.040 position:50% align:center
They at least kept
the scene going.

00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:18.543 position:50% align:center
True, but...

00:15:18.585 --> 00:15:19.794 position:50% align:center
Whoa.

00:15:19.836 --> 00:15:22.255 position:50% align:center
Whoa, that was rough.

00:15:22.297 --> 00:15:24.299 position:50% align:center
[TENMA gasping]

00:15:39.814 --> 00:15:42.567 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Guys. There's no point
in denying you were off

00:15:42.609 --> 00:15:45.070 position:50% align:center
your game for our
dress rehearsal today.

00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:46.780 position:50% align:center
But all that means
is we really need

00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:48.448 position:50% align:center
to step it up for opening night!

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:51.076 position:50% align:center
That's right, we have
this thing on lock down.

00:15:51.117 --> 00:15:52.369 position:50% align:center
Yeah, all good!

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.537 position:50% align:center
Yup!

00:15:54.579 --> 00:15:57.248 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] How long are you
gonna brood by the window?

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:58.792 position:50% align:center
Oh, crap!

00:15:58.833 --> 00:15:59.793 position:50% align:center
Something wrong?

00:15:59.834 --> 00:16:03.338 position:50% align:center
What? There's nothing
to worry about.

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:04.214 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
The internet?

00:16:04.255 --> 00:16:06.716 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
Exactly! It's just the internet!

00:16:06.758 --> 00:16:09.511 position:50% align:center
Wait, Yukki! Hey,
I said don't worry about it!

00:16:09.552 --> 00:16:11.513 position:50% align:center
They wrote about our
dress rehearsal.

00:16:11.554 --> 00:16:13.264 position:50% align:center
Who cares what they said?

00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:14.933 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
"A Poor Start.

00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:18.645 position:50% align:center
Silver Screen Star Stumbles
in Stage Debut."

00:16:18.687 --> 00:16:20.689 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
Ouch. That's so harsh.

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:23.483 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
Yuki, that's enough!

00:16:23.525 --> 00:16:25.568 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] What? It's not
like they don't have

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:27.028 position:50% align:center
a good point, you know.

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:29.030 position:50% align:center
I'm super bummed
all of a sudden.

00:16:29.072 --> 00:16:31.950 position:50% align:center
Hey. It's cool.
The real thing's tomorrow.

00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:35.161 position:50% align:center
Which means we've still
got time to polish it up!

00:16:35.203 --> 00:16:40.917 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure. But we really
need to get on that.

00:16:40.959 --> 00:16:43.920 position:50% align:center
Are we gonna have
a meeting, leader?

00:16:43.962 --> 00:16:45.296 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
No.

00:16:46.464 --> 00:16:48.299 position:50% align:center
Poor Tenma.

00:16:51.636 --> 00:16:52.637 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
You guys

00:16:52.679 --> 00:16:55.432 position:50% align:center
don't think that he's gonna
give up on us, do you?

00:16:55.473 --> 00:16:58.059 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI] No way Tenten would
be tapping out already!

00:16:58.101 --> 00:16:59.936 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I should hope not.

00:17:19.581 --> 00:17:22.417 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI]
Hey, Grandpa. You were right.

00:17:22.459 --> 00:17:27.797 position:50% align:center
Acting is so much fun.
I never wanna stop.

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:29.424 position:50% align:center
I wanna keep going.

00:17:29.466 --> 00:17:33.345 position:50% align:center
I wanna keep doing this onstage
with all of my friends!

00:17:37.349 --> 00:17:41.686 position:50% align:center
Where'd he run off to?
That big idiot.

00:17:43.521 --> 00:17:45.774 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Is that what this is about?

00:17:45.815 --> 00:17:48.401 position:50% align:center
Why didn't you just tell me
that in the first place?

00:17:48.443 --> 00:17:51.029 position:50% align:center
Instead of wrapping
it up in some story?

00:17:51.071 --> 00:17:53.323 position:50% align:center
--[door creaks]
--Uh?

00:17:56.326 --> 00:17:59.537 position:50% align:center
My bad. I didn't
mean to interrupt.

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:00.663 position:50% align:center
You're fine.

00:18:00.705 --> 00:18:02.540 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Can we talk for a moment?

00:18:02.582 --> 00:18:05.043 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure.

00:18:05.085 --> 00:18:08.838 position:50% align:center
Still hung up on the
dress rehearsal, aren't you?

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.091 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
I can't believe it.

00:18:13.301 --> 00:18:15.011 position:50% align:center
[TENMA] For years,
I thought that school play

00:18:15.053 --> 00:18:17.972 position:50% align:center
was the worst performance
I'd ever give.

00:18:18.014 --> 00:18:20.392 position:50% align:center
But turns out I was wrong.

00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:23.353 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
It can get so much worse.

00:18:23.395 --> 00:18:26.231 position:50% align:center
Like me, I would pretty much
always skip some lines.

00:18:26.272 --> 00:18:28.692 position:50% align:center
And then there was the time
I went through an entire show

00:18:28.733 --> 00:18:30.318 position:50% align:center
doing the wrong
character's dialogue.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.778 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.364 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] I once stepped onstage
before my character appeared.

00:18:34.406 --> 00:18:37.200 position:50% align:center
One time I tripped and
pantsed the lead when I fell.

00:18:37.242 --> 00:18:38.952 position:50% align:center
No way, really?

00:18:38.993 --> 00:18:42.122 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah. Trust me. When it
comes to screwing up shows,

00:18:42.163 --> 00:18:43.957 position:50% align:center
you've got nothing on me, kiddo.

00:18:43.998 --> 00:18:45.750 position:50% align:center
After all that,
I'm kinda surprised

00:18:45.792 --> 00:18:47.127 position:50% align:center
you kept doing theatre.

00:18:47.168 --> 00:18:51.297 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI laughs]

00:18:51.339 --> 00:18:53.633 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
I'm so scared.

00:18:53.675 --> 00:19:01.391 position:50% align:center
What if I get out there tomorrow
and, and humiliate myself again?

00:19:01.433 --> 00:19:04.853 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Thing is,
those shows where I messed up?

00:19:04.894 --> 00:19:07.981 position:50% align:center
The crowd laughed so much
harder than they normally did.

00:19:08.023 --> 00:19:08.857 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Huh?

00:19:08.898 --> 00:19:11.901 position:50% align:center
Sure, it would have been better
to not screw things up.

00:19:11.943 --> 00:19:14.362 position:50% align:center
But getting to make a
crowd roar with laughter

00:19:14.404 --> 00:19:16.865 position:50% align:center
like that is a whole
experience in itself.

00:19:16.906 --> 00:19:19.492 position:50% align:center
Sometimes people mess up
or blank out onstage,

00:19:19.534 --> 00:19:21.286 position:50% align:center
and all you can really do
when it happens

00:19:21.327 --> 00:19:23.913 position:50% align:center
is keep the show going.

00:19:23.955 --> 00:19:25.749 position:50% align:center
Even if it's not a
flawless performance,

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:27.834 position:50% align:center
if it resonates with the crowd,

00:19:27.876 --> 00:19:31.004 position:50% align:center
that means you're still
giving them your best.

00:19:31.046 --> 00:19:32.797 position:50% align:center
That does make sense.

00:19:32.839 --> 00:19:34.883 position:50% align:center
Connecting with the audience.

00:19:34.924 --> 00:19:38.428 position:50% align:center
You might not know it, the way I
ham it up out there, but...

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:41.639 position:50% align:center
My heart would race before
I went out onstage.

00:19:41.681 --> 00:19:44.142 position:50% align:center
For every single show I did.

00:19:44.184 --> 00:19:46.102 position:50% align:center
It's just like you said.

00:19:46.144 --> 00:19:48.813 position:50% align:center
When you're onstage, you don't
get to keep running the scene

00:19:48.855 --> 00:19:50.982 position:50% align:center
till you get a perfect take.

00:19:51.024 --> 00:19:53.360 position:50% align:center
You've got one moment
with the audience.

00:19:53.401 --> 00:19:57.655 position:50% align:center
Make it the best moment
you can give them.

00:19:57.697 --> 00:20:00.533 position:50% align:center
Make that one moment...

00:20:00.575 --> 00:20:02.535 position:50% align:center
...priceless.

00:20:05.455 --> 00:20:07.624 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] It isn't really about
reciting every word

00:20:07.665 --> 00:20:11.378 position:50% align:center
in the script perfectly.
When you're on stage, your job

00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:15.590 position:50% align:center
is to keep growing as an actor.
It's a place without boundaries.

00:20:15.632 --> 00:20:18.134 position:50% align:center
This is where you define
what you can do.

00:20:18.176 --> 00:20:20.553 position:50% align:center
As long as you keep
coming back here,

00:20:20.595 --> 00:20:22.639 position:50% align:center
then you can make each
and every performance

00:20:22.681 --> 00:20:24.766 position:50% align:center
the best one yet.

00:20:26.518 --> 00:20:29.688 position:50% align:center
Ha, ha. You have
a way with words.

00:20:29.729 --> 00:20:32.899 position:50% align:center
That really was some good stuff.

00:20:32.941 --> 00:20:35.902 position:50% align:center
I kind of expected somebody
to laugh when I told all of you

00:20:35.944 --> 00:20:37.112 position:50% align:center
about my school play,

00:20:37.153 --> 00:20:39.656 position:50% align:center
but I didn't hear a peep
out of anyone.

00:20:39.698 --> 00:20:41.991 position:50% align:center
Instead, you recognized
that I freeze up onstage

00:20:42.033 --> 00:20:46.496 position:50% align:center
because I'm scared to give a
less-than-perfect performance.

00:20:46.538 --> 00:20:48.665 position:50% align:center
And you accepted it.

00:20:48.707 --> 00:20:51.876 position:50% align:center
That's the first time anybody's
ever done that for me.

00:20:51.918 --> 00:20:54.671 position:50% align:center
Glad we could help.

00:20:54.713 --> 00:20:57.382 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Sneaking off alone together?

00:20:58.925 --> 00:21:01.386 position:50% align:center
Did we just walk in on
something scandalous?

00:21:01.428 --> 00:21:03.263 position:50% align:center
No fooling around, Tenten!

00:21:03.304 --> 00:21:05.390 position:50% align:center
I want some of that!

00:21:05.432 --> 00:21:08.143 position:50% align:center
Playing the romantic foil
makes me nervous.

00:21:08.184 --> 00:21:10.895 position:50% align:center
But honestly it also
gets me kind of excited!

00:21:10.937 --> 00:21:13.231 position:50% align:center
Whoa. You're reading
into this, too--

00:21:13.273 --> 00:21:16.526 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI laughing]

00:21:16.568 --> 00:21:18.278 position:50% align:center
We are rehearsing, right?

00:21:18.319 --> 00:21:20.572 position:50% align:center
Get up Tenten,
we got work to do.

00:21:20.613 --> 00:21:23.783 position:50% align:center
I've got some rough patches to
smooth out before the show.

00:21:23.825 --> 00:21:25.535 position:50% align:center
Yup!

00:21:25.577 --> 00:21:28.413 position:50% align:center
You guys are-- [gasps]

00:21:31.332 --> 00:21:32.792 position:50% align:center
Come on, let's go.

00:21:32.834 --> 00:21:35.420 position:50% align:center
That's right.
It's time to practice!

00:21:35.462 --> 00:21:36.880 position:50% align:center
[TENMA grunts]

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:57.442 position:50% align:center
Okay, where're we starting?

00:21:57.484 --> 00:22:00.987 position:50% align:center
From the top. We're getting
this thing down tonight.

00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:03.948 position:50% align:center
All right, the hack
switched back into boss mode!

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:05.700 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
The hell? Let go of my hand...

00:22:05.742 --> 00:22:07.660 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] None of them
are ready to give up.

00:22:07.702 --> 00:22:09.454 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Aww, you stopped smiling.

00:22:09.496 --> 00:22:10.497 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
You are the worst!

00:22:10.538 --> 00:22:12.749 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] They can bounce back.
I know they can!

00:22:12.791 --> 00:22:15.210 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI]
Hip hip hooray!

00:22:15.251 --> 00:22:17.003 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI, MUKU]
Hooray!
