No fair!

[ATARU]
Hey, it's no use! I'm faster.

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:18.101 position:50% align:center
Ataru. Takeru.

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.270 position:50% align:center
No running inside the house.

[ATARU, TAKERU]
Kay...

00:00:21.813 --> 00:00:24.190 position:50% align:center
[SUBERU] Come on, you guys,
give Kaoru a break.

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:26.151 position:50% align:center
--[TAKERU] Aww...
--[ATARU] Fine.

00:00:26.234 --> 00:00:30.030 position:50% align:center
[TAKERU] Hey, Kaoru.
Dad's phone is ringing.

00:00:30.113 --> 00:00:31.197 position:50% align:center
It's Tsuzuru.

00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:33.199 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:36.786 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU]
Dad? Oh, hey, Kaoru.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.621 position:50% align:center
Nah, you're good.

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:40.957 position:50% align:center
I was just calling to let him
know I found a troupe

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:43.084 position:50% align:center
that has a dorm
where I can stay.

00:00:43.168 --> 00:00:44.711 position:50% align:center
Everything still good at home?

00:00:44.794 --> 00:00:46.379 position:50% align:center
Don't you worry about us.

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:48.631 position:50% align:center
You just keep living
your big dream.

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:51.468 position:50% align:center
I'll take care of things here.

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:55.055 position:50% align:center
Thanks, brother.
I'll talk to you again soon.

00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:39.701 position:50% align:center
This'll be the perfect
room for you, director.

00:02:39.784 --> 00:02:42.412 position:50% align:center
It's the one Yukio always
used back in the day.

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:44.706 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
My dad's old room?

00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.126 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:02:52.964 --> 00:02:54.799 position:50% align:center
There's plenty of
space for me, too.

00:02:54.883 --> 00:02:56.343 position:50% align:center
Yeah. No.

00:02:56.426 --> 00:02:58.887 position:50% align:center
That reminds me, considering
you're still a high schooler,

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.680 position:50% align:center
we're going to need permission
from your parents

00:03:00.764 --> 00:03:02.766 position:50% align:center
before you can move
into the dorms, Masumi.

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.017 position:50% align:center
No one'll care.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.727 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but I care.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.520 position:50% align:center
I should introduce
myself as well.

00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:09.105 position:50% align:center
What's a number I
can reach them at?

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.274 position:50% align:center
Wow, you already want
to meet my parents?

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:13.401 position:50% align:center
We only just started
dating, but sure.

00:03:13.485 --> 00:03:14.819 position:50% align:center
We are not dating!

00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:17.614 position:50% align:center
Uh. They're pretty busy,
and with the time difference,

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:19.032 position:50% align:center
it'll be tough to
get a hold of 'em.

00:03:19.115 --> 00:03:21.034 position:50% align:center
Really? Where are they?

00:03:21.117 --> 00:03:24.412 position:50% align:center
I think they told
me at some point.

00:03:24.496 --> 00:03:25.747 position:50% align:center
Oh, well.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.000 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Okay...

00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:31.836 position:50% align:center
I left a message, but you should
go home today just in case.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.546 position:50% align:center
He'll be fine staying here!

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.173 position:50% align:center
Plus I'm making a ton of food.

00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:37.717 position:50% align:center
It'll be late by the time we're
done, so this makes sense.

00:03:37.801 --> 00:03:41.096 position:50% align:center
Well. All right then.
I guess we'll talk rooms?

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:42.764 position:50% align:center
If you're not gonna
let me stay with you,

00:03:42.847 --> 00:03:44.099 position:50% align:center
I don't care where I sleep.

00:03:44.182 --> 00:03:46.851 position:50% align:center
In that case, I don't mind
bunking with Masumi.

00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:48.978 position:50% align:center
Same, I'm good with anything.

00:03:51.022 --> 00:03:53.441 position:50% align:center
Welp, looks like you
and me are roommates.

00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:55.944 position:50% align:center
Crazy to think we'll all be
living in the same place!

00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:57.696 position:50% align:center
I assume you already
have permission

00:03:57.779 --> 00:03:59.280 position:50% align:center
from your parents, right Sakuya?

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:01.950 position:50% align:center
Oh. Uh. Technically not.

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:03.159 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Seriously?

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:04.077 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
Yeah.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.537 position:50% align:center
How did I not know this?

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.664 position:50% align:center
Well, that's a great question!

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:11.418 position:50% align:center
[phone ringing]

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:12.961 position:50% align:center
[YOSHINAGA]
Yes. Yoshinaga residence.

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:13.920 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI gasps]

00:04:14.004 --> 00:04:15.296 position:50% align:center
[YOSHINAGA]
Hello?

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.591 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Um, hi. Is this where
Sakuya Sakuma lives?

00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:20.385 position:50% align:center
[YOSHINAGA]
Yes. That's correct.

00:04:20.468 --> 00:04:22.262 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Apologies for calling so late.

00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:24.889 position:50% align:center
I'm from Mankai Company.
We're a theater troupe.

00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:27.642 position:50% align:center
[YOSHINAGA]
Huh? Is everything all right?

00:04:28.893 --> 00:04:30.729 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
So, that's the situation.

00:04:30.812 --> 00:04:32.814 position:50% align:center
Will you allow him
to live in our dorms?

00:04:32.897 --> 00:04:34.858 position:50% align:center
[YOSHINAGA] Does it cost
anything for him to stay there?

00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:36.151 position:50% align:center
Oh. No, ma'am.

00:04:36.234 --> 00:04:38.236 position:50% align:center
[YOSHINAGA]
If that's the case, then sure.

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:40.280 position:50% align:center
Just make sure he
still goes to school.

00:04:40.363 --> 00:04:43.450 position:50% align:center
Otherwise it'll end up being
trouble for all of us.

00:04:44.576 --> 00:04:47.746 position:50% align:center
She said that you're good
to go. No need to worry.

00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:51.166 position:50% align:center
Thanks so much, director.
Really. You see...

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:53.543 position:50% align:center
My parents passed away
when I was young,

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:55.503 position:50% align:center
so I've always
stayed with relatives.

00:04:55.587 --> 00:04:57.422 position:50% align:center
That's why our names
don't match.

00:04:57.505 --> 00:04:59.132 position:50% align:center
You probably noticed.

00:04:59.215 --> 00:05:00.884 position:50% align:center
Sure, I get it now.

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:04.596 position:50% align:center
This'll be the first time I've
ever had a room of my own!

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:07.766 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna work so hard
for this troupe! I swear!

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:09.100 position:50% align:center
You better!

00:05:09.184 --> 00:05:11.144 position:50% align:center
Otherwise the dorms
will end up shut down

00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:12.395 position:50% align:center
along with the rest
of the theater.

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.189 position:50% align:center
We can't let that happen.

00:05:14.272 --> 00:05:15.774 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE]
Hey, everybody!

00:05:15.857 --> 00:05:18.485 position:50% align:center
Hope you're hungry
and ready to feast!

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:21.529 position:50% align:center
Bon appetite!

00:05:21.613 --> 00:05:23.281 position:50% align:center
--[IZUMI grunting]
--No way.

00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:25.784 position:50% align:center
It's hurting my eyes
just looking at it.

00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:27.952 position:50% align:center
And it kinda smells
like yesterday's trash.

00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:30.163 position:50% align:center
Please don't hold back,
'cuz there's plenty more

00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:31.414 position:50% align:center
where this came from!

00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:33.750 position:50% align:center
I guess I may as well
try it since it's here.

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:35.877 position:50% align:center
You sure that's a good idea?

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:40.757 position:50% align:center
I am slain.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.634 position:50% align:center
Wha--? Oh, no!

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:45.845 position:50% align:center
That's enough for me.

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:48.932 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE] What? You didn't even
try it. At least have a taste.

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:50.475 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI]
I'm not hungry anymore.

00:05:50.558 --> 00:05:53.895 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE] But there's enough for
seconds! And lunch tomorrow!

00:05:53.978 --> 00:05:57.774 position:50% align:center
Don't eat that! Let me
make you guys some curry.

00:05:57.857 --> 00:05:59.317 position:50% align:center
[BOYS]
Uh?

00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:04.114 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA gasping]

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:07.701 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
It's delicious!

00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:10.120 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI] I could eat your
cooking for every meal.

00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:12.330 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE] What kind of base
did you use for this?

00:06:12.414 --> 00:06:13.873 position:50% align:center
A base?

00:06:13.957 --> 00:06:15.875 position:50% align:center
You must mean that store-bought
stuff you buy on the cheap.

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:17.002 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE gasping]

00:06:17.085 --> 00:06:18.712 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
I'd never use such crap.

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:20.880 position:50% align:center
That shortcut is
a culinary heresy.

00:06:20.964 --> 00:06:23.133 position:50% align:center
Blasphemy against
the art of curry!

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:25.385 position:50% align:center
It is? Then how'd you make this?

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:27.554 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI laughs]
I'm glad you asked that.

00:06:27.637 --> 00:06:30.015 position:50% align:center
To start, it's important to
have all the right spices.

00:06:30.098 --> 00:06:31.016 position:50% align:center
Thanks, I'm done.

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:32.142 position:50% align:center
It was really good.

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:33.727 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'll take seconds.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.395 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Wait. I thought
you wanted to hear--

00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:37.814 position:50% align:center
Y'know, I think that
might be the best curry

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:38.773 position:50% align:center
that I've ever had!

00:06:38.857 --> 00:06:40.108 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah?

00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:42.277 position:50% align:center
I would be more than happy
to make it year-round.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.238 position:50% align:center
I feel like that
might be overkill.

00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:52.412 position:50% align:center
Uh? Hey. What's in there?

00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:55.081 position:50% align:center
The original Spring
Troupe's materials.

00:06:55.165 --> 00:06:57.500 position:50% align:center
I thought they'd help
give us some ideas.

00:06:59.336 --> 00:07:01.421 position:50% align:center
Whoa. This is great.

00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:03.465 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE] The Spring Troupe tended
to put on some of the more

00:07:03.548 --> 00:07:05.008 position:50% align:center
lighthearted,
conventional plays,

00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:08.261 position:50% align:center
so they were the most popular.

00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:10.889 position:50% align:center
This is cool.
A piece of their history!

00:07:10.972 --> 00:07:12.682 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU]
Mm-hm.

00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:16.895 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Today, we're going to

00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:18.688 position:50% align:center
get out there and try to
recruit some new members.

00:07:18.772 --> 00:07:20.357 position:50% align:center
Oh, do we need more?

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.609 position:50% align:center
Well, considering that
the original Spring Troupe

00:07:22.692 --> 00:07:24.694 position:50% align:center
was a group of five, I'm
guessing we're gonna need

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:26.863 position:50% align:center
at least that many
to fill out our cast.

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:28.490 position:50% align:center
I say we do some
more street acts,

00:07:28.573 --> 00:07:30.325 position:50% align:center
which has the bonus of
being good practice!

00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:31.868 position:50% align:center
--[TSUZURU] 'Kay!
--[SAKUYA] Yeah!

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:33.661 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU]
Wake up, already.

00:07:35.497 --> 00:07:39.501 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU] I even have a new home
now, thanks to Mankai Company!

00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:41.086 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and don't forget
we get to have

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:43.004 position:50% align:center
warm meals every
day, right, bro?

00:07:43.088 --> 00:07:45.799 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI] There'll be no more
sleeping in the doghouse for me.

00:07:45.882 --> 00:07:48.093 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
The... doghouse?

00:07:48.176 --> 00:07:49.886 position:50% align:center
--[MAN A] They suck.
--[WOMAN A] I know, right?

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:51.388 position:50% align:center
[MAN B]
Way to embarrass yourself.

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:53.139 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN B]
Talk about hammy acting.

00:07:53.223 --> 00:07:55.308 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Well, we're drawing
attention, at least.

00:07:55.392 --> 00:07:58.269 position:50% align:center
[CITRON] Interesting. So, these
are Japanese hams, then?

00:07:58.353 --> 00:07:59.479 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI gasps]

00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:01.398 position:50% align:center
[CITRON] Bake them or
toss them in a stew.

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:04.526 position:50% align:center
I do love a fresh
little ham, don't you?

00:08:04.609 --> 00:08:06.820 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Excuse me, please
stop calling them hams!

00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:09.948 position:50% align:center
[CITRON] Oh, sorry.
I beg your pardon, ma'am.

00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:11.950 position:50% align:center
Who's the weird guy
in the mask?

00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:13.326 position:50% align:center
A movie star?

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:15.829 position:50% align:center
We're just trying to
draw some attention here.

00:08:15.912 --> 00:08:18.498 position:50% align:center
So, if you're an actor
from another troupe,

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:20.667 position:50% align:center
would you mind going
somewhere else, please?

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.836 position:50% align:center
[CITRON]
You're mistaken. I'm no actor.

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:24.087 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Hm?

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.964 position:50% align:center
[CITRON] Just a happy tourist
passing through!

00:08:26.047 --> 00:08:28.091 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA] What's going on?
Everything okay?

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:30.593 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU] Is he promoting
a show or something?

00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:32.512 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
He says he's not an actor.

00:08:32.595 --> 00:08:34.639 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU] I've never seen
clothes like that.

00:08:34.723 --> 00:08:37.267 position:50% align:center
[CITRON] Well, this is what
all my countrymen wear.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:38.977 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA] So you aren't
from around here!

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:40.395 position:50% align:center
Are you sightseeing?

00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:43.898 position:50% align:center
[CITRON] I'm studying abroad.
And if I'm being honest,

00:08:43.982 --> 00:08:46.484 position:50% align:center
I've always wanted to
learn about theater.

00:08:46.568 --> 00:08:48.737 position:50% align:center
Great, would you like to
join our theater troupe,

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.655 position:50% align:center
Mankai Company?

00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:52.991 position:50% align:center
We have a dorm, so you'd
even have a place to stay.

00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:54.868 position:50% align:center
And that way,
you can study theater!

00:08:54.951 --> 00:08:55.994 position:50% align:center
You're serious?

00:08:56.077 --> 00:08:57.829 position:50% align:center
So, you'll take just
about anyone, huh?

00:08:57.912 --> 00:08:59.497 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU]
Can you memorize lines?

00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:00.707 position:50% align:center
[CITRON]
That's no problemo!

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.125 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU]
Well, that's good to hear.

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:04.627 position:50% align:center
[CITRON] I've decided.
I'll join your Monkey Company!

00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:06.588 position:50% align:center
It's Mankai!

00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:11.760 position:50% align:center
I'm Citron, by the way.
It's great to meet you guys!

00:09:11.843 --> 00:09:13.470 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU]
Sure. Back at you.

00:09:15.597 --> 00:09:17.891 position:50% align:center
I think it's finally
time to call it a day.

00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:19.309 position:50% align:center
But I'm not tired yet!

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:22.312 position:50% align:center
Staying out here longer isn't
going to do us any good.

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:23.396 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA grunts]

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.940 position:50% align:center
I think he's right, Sakuya.

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:30.403 position:50% align:center
[CITRON] As they say, "slow
and steady spins the race"!

00:09:30.487 --> 00:09:31.780 position:50% align:center
Can't say I've heard that one!

00:09:31.863 --> 00:09:34.824 position:50% align:center
You mean slow and steady
wins the race, right?

00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:36.701 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA screaming]

00:09:36.785 --> 00:09:39.579 position:50% align:center
[CITRON] I think spinning
sounds like much more fun!

00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:43.041 position:50% align:center
Look at you! Flying through
the air like a silly carpet!

00:09:43.124 --> 00:09:44.167 position:50% align:center
Of course!

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:47.837 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA groaning]
I'm so dizzy now.

00:09:47.921 --> 00:09:48.797 position:50% align:center
'Scuse me.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.340 position:50% align:center
Oh! Man, I'm sorry!

00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:51.591 position:50% align:center
Sir, are you okay?

00:09:51.675 --> 00:09:52.842 position:50% align:center
I am.

00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:56.388 position:50% align:center
Sorry. Sakuya's mistake
is really my mistake.

00:09:56.471 --> 00:09:58.014 position:50% align:center
[ITARU]
Don't worry about it.

00:09:58.098 --> 00:09:59.557 position:50% align:center
Um, sir.

00:09:59.641 --> 00:10:02.727 position:50% align:center
This is random, but are you
looking for housing around here?

00:10:02.811 --> 00:10:05.730 position:50% align:center
Uh. As a matter of fact, I am.

00:10:05.814 --> 00:10:07.440 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:10.235 position:50% align:center
[ITARU]
You have your own dorm?

00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:12.612 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] That's right!
Room and board are included.

00:10:12.696 --> 00:10:15.490 position:50% align:center
Well, I must tell you
that the offer is tempting,

00:10:15.573 --> 00:10:17.742 position:50% align:center
but I'm worried sharing
a room won't work.

00:10:17.826 --> 00:10:20.370 position:50% align:center
I've accumulated too many
things for that, I think.

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:22.706 position:50% align:center
Well, then, why don't I
just move in with Citron,

00:10:22.789 --> 00:10:24.624 position:50% align:center
then you could have a
room all to yourself!

00:10:24.708 --> 00:10:27.252 position:50% align:center
I'm absolutely okay with that!

00:10:27.335 --> 00:10:28.753 position:50% align:center
Ah, if that's the case,

00:10:28.837 --> 00:10:30.880 position:50% align:center
then I'd be interested in
learning more about the troupe.

00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:32.257 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasping, laughing]

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.301 position:50% align:center
First a foreigner and
now a businessman?

00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:37.721 position:50% align:center
I need to get a job.

00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:41.099 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] I'm happy to announce
our new friends, Itaru Chigasaki

00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:43.768 position:50% align:center
and Citron have officially
joined our merry little troupe!

00:10:43.852 --> 00:10:46.104 position:50% align:center
Thanks for the welcome,
I'm thrilled to be here!

00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:47.439 position:50% align:center
Well done!

00:10:47.522 --> 00:10:49.441 position:50% align:center
You managed to gather a
full team of five people!

00:10:49.524 --> 00:10:51.484 position:50% align:center
I knew you could do it!

00:10:51.568 --> 00:10:53.319 position:50% align:center
Hey, where's Itaru?

00:10:53.403 --> 00:10:55.238 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] He went home to
get ready to move in.

00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:57.657 position:50% align:center
But we should go ahead and open
up the discussion about what

00:10:57.741 --> 00:10:59.617 position:50% align:center
we think we should do
for our performance.

00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:00.618 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU gasping]

00:11:00.702 --> 00:11:01.911 position:50% align:center
Do you think it's
okay to do that

00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:03.580 position:50% align:center
without all of our members here?

00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:05.165 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
We're on a tight schedule.

00:11:05.248 --> 00:11:08.293 position:50% align:center
We won't make it unless we
start hashing out ideas now.

00:11:08.376 --> 00:11:09.711 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE]
How about reusing one of

00:11:09.794 --> 00:11:11.796 position:50% align:center
the original Spring
Troupe's scripts?

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.089 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
That might be a good idea.

00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:14.257 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU]
Hey, um.

00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:16.551 position:50% align:center
[ALL gasp]

00:11:16.634 --> 00:11:19.554 position:50% align:center
Do you think I could give
writing the script a shot?

00:11:19.637 --> 00:11:21.306 position:50% align:center
Right, that's what
you wanted to do!

00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:23.558 position:50% align:center
It's so great that you
want to be a playwright,

00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:25.268 position:50% align:center
but I'm a little bit nervous.

00:11:25.352 --> 00:11:28.063 position:50% align:center
We need to start
rehearsing right away.

00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:30.815 position:50% align:center
She's right, but how about
if you write our next show?

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:32.942 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU] Are you even sure
we'll have another show?

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:34.361 position:50% align:center
U-Uh...

00:11:34.444 --> 00:11:37.238 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Tsuzuru, approximately
how long do you think

00:11:37.322 --> 00:11:39.783 position:50% align:center
it will take you to
write a full script?

00:11:41.242 --> 00:11:43.078 position:50% align:center
Maybe one week.

00:11:43.161 --> 00:11:45.705 position:50% align:center
Can you please give me a week
to try and give this a shot?

00:11:45.789 --> 00:11:47.040 position:50% align:center
Huh. One week?

00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:49.584 position:50% align:center
Are you crazy? That's
impossible, even for pros!

00:11:49.668 --> 00:11:50.585 position:50% align:center
You've got it.

00:11:50.669 --> 00:11:51.670 position:50% align:center
What?!

00:11:51.753 --> 00:11:52.921 position:50% align:center
You'll let me?

00:11:53.004 --> 00:11:55.131 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] I think we can
justify one week.

00:11:55.215 --> 00:11:58.885 position:50% align:center
But you have to promise
to finish the script.

00:11:58.968 --> 00:12:00.970 position:50% align:center
And it better be good,
understand?

00:12:01.054 --> 00:12:02.639 position:50% align:center
Or you'll be taking
it up with me.

00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:04.140 position:50% align:center
Scary.

00:12:04.224 --> 00:12:06.017 position:50% align:center
I'll remind you that
this troupe's survival

00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:08.645 position:50% align:center
is on the line, so be honest
and don't let us go under

00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:11.147 position:50% align:center
just because you're
determined to write.

00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:12.732 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:12:16.653 --> 00:12:18.947 position:50% align:center
Have you decided what
you want to write about?

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:20.198 position:50% align:center
Well, after looking through

00:12:20.281 --> 00:12:21.783 position:50% align:center
the original Spring
Troupe's materials,

00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:23.952 position:50% align:center
Romeo and Juliet kept
popping into my head,

00:12:24.035 --> 00:12:26.705 position:50% align:center
so I'm planning to go with that.

00:12:26.788 --> 00:12:29.457 position:50% align:center
If we do that show,
who would play Juliet?

00:12:29.541 --> 00:12:31.292 position:50% align:center
I suppose one of you
will have to play her.

00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:33.086 position:50% align:center
I know that's what
they used to do.

00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:36.881 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU] I'll make it work.
You just need to trust me.

00:12:36.965 --> 00:12:38.842 position:50% align:center
[door closes]

00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:41.428 position:50% align:center
Director, do you really think
we can count on this guy?

00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:42.846 position:50% align:center
I mean, we just met him.

00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:44.097 position:50% align:center
We could always
do a read-through

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:45.765 position:50% align:center
of the Spring Troupe's
script, just in case.

00:12:45.849 --> 00:12:48.351 position:50% align:center
You know, to cover our bases!

00:12:48.435 --> 00:12:52.022 position:50% align:center
It's fine. I think we
should trust him.

00:12:55.525 --> 00:12:57.736 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] From now on,
Itaru and Citron

00:12:57.819 --> 00:12:59.904 position:50% align:center
will be joining our
daily rehearsals.

00:12:59.988 --> 00:13:02.157 position:50% align:center
Thanks. But I don't
have any experience,

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.034 position:50% align:center
so I hope I won't hold you back.

00:13:04.117 --> 00:13:05.493 position:50% align:center
Thanks for having me, too!

00:13:05.577 --> 00:13:09.164 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Of course!
Now how about we get started.

00:13:09.247 --> 00:13:11.666 position:50% align:center
Hey, Dad, wait! No-- Uh...

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:14.127 position:50% align:center
Oh! What time are you
coming home today?

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.463 position:50% align:center
[ITARU] I might actually
be back late again.

00:13:16.546 --> 00:13:17.797 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI]
Again? You gave us your word...

00:13:17.881 --> 00:13:20.508 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Sakuya's acting
is a little heavy-handed.

00:13:20.592 --> 00:13:22.135 position:50% align:center
He needs to relax.

00:13:22.218 --> 00:13:24.179 position:50% align:center
Masumi is a flawless actor.

00:13:24.262 --> 00:13:25.305 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
Hey, calm down, bro!

00:13:25.388 --> 00:13:26.431 position:50% align:center
[ITARU]
Let go.

00:13:26.514 --> 00:13:28.641 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI]
Stop this, you guys!

00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:31.519 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Citron and Itaru both
have a few things to work on,

00:13:31.603 --> 00:13:35.690 position:50% align:center
for sure, but they're
doing well for beginners.

00:13:35.774 --> 00:13:37.150 position:50% align:center
And, thankfully,

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:40.153 position:50% align:center
they'll keep getting
better with experience!

00:13:41.571 --> 00:13:42.697 position:50% align:center
Okay, next we'll--

00:13:42.781 --> 00:13:44.157 position:50% align:center
[beeping]

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.118 position:50% align:center
[footsteps]

00:13:47.202 --> 00:13:52.123 position:50% align:center
[ITARU sighs] Rehearsal goes
until nine tonight, right?

00:13:52.207 --> 00:13:54.918 position:50% align:center
Oh, apologies!
That went by so fast.

00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:56.378 position:50% align:center
Hey, I can keep acting!

00:13:56.461 --> 00:13:59.130 position:50% align:center
I can go until morning
if you're gonna be here.

00:13:59.214 --> 00:14:02.592 position:50% align:center
I think we got an awful lot
done--we shouldn't overdo it.

00:14:02.676 --> 00:14:04.511 position:50% align:center
I have work tomorrow, too.

00:14:04.594 --> 00:14:06.304 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's a very good point!

00:14:06.388 --> 00:14:08.765 position:50% align:center
Let's call it a day,
then, you guys.

00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:10.934 position:50% align:center
Um. Is it okay if I stay here

00:14:11.017 --> 00:14:12.519 position:50% align:center
and practice just
a little bit more?

00:14:12.602 --> 00:14:15.021 position:50% align:center
Yes, I'd like to stay, too!

00:14:15.105 --> 00:14:17.190 position:50% align:center
All right, but only 30 minutes.

00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:18.900 position:50% align:center
Thanks!

00:14:18.983 --> 00:14:22.278 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna head back.
Good work, everyone.

00:14:58.773 --> 00:15:00.900 position:50% align:center
Uh? Citron?

00:15:00.984 --> 00:15:03.737 position:50% align:center
I guess we both must've
had the same idea.

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.697 position:50% align:center
You're here to swipe
the script, am I right?

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.992 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
What? Well no, of course not!

00:15:09.075 --> 00:15:11.578 position:50% align:center
It's just that he's cooped
up in here by himself,

00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:14.164 position:50% align:center
even during meals. I'm worried.

00:15:14.247 --> 00:15:17.625 position:50% align:center
[CITRON] It's true.
He's like a chicken in a coop.

00:15:17.709 --> 00:15:18.918 position:50% align:center
Well, then?

00:15:19.002 --> 00:15:20.295 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:23.548 position:50% align:center
Why worry? Just open sesame!

00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:25.717 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
Wait! Citron, come on!

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.554 position:50% align:center
We can't just walk in!
That's not a cool thing to do!

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:34.851 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:36.603 position:50% align:center

[TSUZURU grunting]

00:15:48.365 --> 00:15:51.826 position:50% align:center
When did I fall asleep?

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:53.119 position:50% align:center
Mm?

00:16:07.592 --> 00:16:11.513 position:50% align:center
You think so? Weird spelling,
guys, but thanks.

00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:20.814 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU]
Kaoru knows me too well.

00:16:25.235 --> 00:16:27.112 position:50% align:center
Bleh, bitter.

00:16:36.162 --> 00:16:37.455 position:50% align:center
Here goes!

00:16:37.539 --> 00:16:39.082 position:50% align:center
[keyboard clacking]

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:46.006 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Well, it's been a week.

00:16:46.089 --> 00:16:48.216 position:50% align:center
Does anyone know
how Tsuzuru's doing?

00:16:48.299 --> 00:16:49.300 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI]
No idea.

00:16:49.384 --> 00:16:51.428 position:50% align:center
Huh? He's in his room,
though, right?

00:16:51.511 --> 00:16:52.595 position:50% align:center
Dunno.

00:16:52.679 --> 00:16:54.347 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] You don't?
But you're roommates!

00:16:54.431 --> 00:16:56.016 position:50% align:center
Don't you ever talk?

00:16:56.099 --> 00:16:57.267 position:50% align:center
No way.

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:59.686 position:50% align:center
I don't think he's been
going to class, either.

00:16:59.769 --> 00:17:02.647 position:50% align:center
Might be a good idea
to check on him.

00:17:03.648 --> 00:17:05.442 position:50% align:center
I'll go see how he's doing.

00:17:05.525 --> 00:17:08.069 position:50% align:center
Hey, what will we do if he
doesn't finish writing it?

00:17:08.153 --> 00:17:09.571 position:50% align:center
Is there a plan?

00:17:09.654 --> 00:17:11.448 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] We'll have to
do a different play.

00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:14.451 position:50% align:center
I know it sounds harsh,
but we can't wait any longer.

00:17:14.534 --> 00:17:16.703 position:50% align:center
I have no doubt
Tsuzuru will finish!

00:17:16.786 --> 00:17:20.081 position:50% align:center
I think so, too! I just know it!

00:17:20.165 --> 00:17:21.332 position:50% align:center
I'll be right back.

00:17:21.416 --> 00:17:23.626 position:50% align:center
As director, I'll feel
better if I check in.

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:25.295 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI]
Well, I go if you go.

00:17:25.378 --> 00:17:26.713 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
Oh! Me, too!

00:17:26.796 --> 00:17:28.798 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but I think I
actually need to head back

00:17:28.882 --> 00:17:31.551 position:50% align:center
to my room if that's
okay with you.

00:17:31.634 --> 00:17:34.971 position:50% align:center
I'm not feeling very well.
I just need to rest for a bit.

00:17:35.055 --> 00:17:39.184 position:50% align:center
Of course it's okay, and I hope
you start feeling better soon.

00:17:41.061 --> 00:17:43.355 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Tsuzuru? You there?

00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:45.315 position:50% align:center
Maybe he died.

00:17:45.398 --> 00:17:46.358 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI, SAKUYA gasp]

00:17:46.441 --> 00:17:47.901 position:50% align:center
Tsuzuru! I'm coming in!

00:17:47.984 --> 00:17:50.612 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Oh my gosh!

00:17:52.072 --> 00:17:53.615 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
What happened?

00:17:53.698 --> 00:17:55.116 position:50% align:center
I'll call an ambulance!

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.951 position:50% align:center
Oh, this poor boy!
How could you die like this?

00:17:57.035 --> 00:18:00.747 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA] Hey! Can you hear me?
Come on, wake up! What's wrong?

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:02.832 position:50% align:center
He did it.

00:18:02.916 --> 00:18:04.501 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Mm?

00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:16.262 position:50% align:center
[CITRON
"Did it"?

00:18:16.346 --> 00:18:18.682 position:50% align:center
Hold on, did he...?

00:18:18.765 --> 00:18:23.269 position:50% align:center
[gasps] You really finished
the entire script? Tsuzuru.

00:18:23.353 --> 00:18:27.190 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Shh! He's just
sleeping really soundly.

00:18:32.987 --> 00:18:35.490 position:50% align:center
Can't believe you
actually got it done.

00:18:35.573 --> 00:18:39.661 position:50% align:center
[CITRON] Pokey-poke-poke-poke.
Hey, hero, it's time to wake up.

00:18:39.744 --> 00:18:42.372 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] No, let him rest.
He probably hasn't slept

00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:44.040 position:50% align:center
all week in order to
meet the deadline.

00:18:44.124 --> 00:18:48.962 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes, I bet you're right.
Check out those raccoon eyes.

00:18:55.385 --> 00:18:58.430 position:50% align:center
Oh, I see. He turned
Juliet into a boy!

00:18:58.513 --> 00:19:01.891 position:50% align:center
That's right, but he didn't stop
at changing the gender.

00:19:01.975 --> 00:19:04.686 position:50% align:center
He made it a story
about friendship.

00:19:04.769 --> 00:19:05.937 position:50% align:center
I like that.

00:19:06.021 --> 00:19:08.064 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess it's not too bad.

Hey, Tsuzuru!

00:19:18.033 --> 00:19:20.702 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU] What do you think?
Will it work?

00:19:20.785 --> 00:19:23.705 position:50% align:center
Uh. Well, it's...

00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:30.337 position:50% align:center
I think it's perfect!
You should be proud.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.339 position:50% align:center

for our show next month!

All right! Yes! Yes!

00:19:43.308 --> 00:19:45.310 position:50% align:center
He's happy.

00:19:45.393 --> 00:19:47.270 position:50% align:center
Man, I sure am.

00:19:47.354 --> 00:19:49.439 position:50% align:center
Oh... Oh, yeah!

00:19:49.522 --> 00:19:53.151 position:50% align:center
By the way, I sorta precast
everyone in my head as I wrote.

00:19:53.234 --> 00:19:55.362 position:50% align:center
I think Sakuya should
be Romeo, the lead.

00:19:55.445 --> 00:19:57.364 position:50% align:center
[gasps] But I'm brand new!

00:19:57.447 --> 00:19:58.823 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU]
You joined up first,

00:19:58.907 --> 00:20:01.368 position:50% align:center
and you'll be perfect as the
face of the Spring Troupe!

00:20:01.451 --> 00:20:04.829 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] I agree! You're always
cheerful, lively, and sincere.

00:20:04.913 --> 00:20:06.790 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA] It's too much!
I'm happy to be in

00:20:06.873 --> 00:20:08.500 position:50% align:center
the background as long
as I'm on stage!

00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:09.876 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Don't be silly!

00:20:09.959 --> 00:20:13.922 position:50% align:center
I guess, if everyone's
all right--

00:20:14.005 --> 00:20:15.507 position:50% align:center
It's no protein!

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:16.508 position:50% align:center
"No problem," right?

00:20:16.591 --> 00:20:17.801 position:50% align:center
[CITRON gasps]

00:20:17.884 --> 00:20:19.844 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU] And do you have
an opinion on this?

00:20:19.928 --> 00:20:21.638 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI]
I don't really care.

00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:23.848 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Then, it's all set!
You'll be the Spring Troupe's

00:20:23.932 --> 00:20:25.517 position:50% align:center
leader and you'll
carry the main role.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.143 position:50% align:center
I'll do my best!

00:20:27.227 --> 00:20:29.104 position:50% align:center
Great! That's the spirit!

00:20:29.187 --> 00:20:31.523 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU] And I thought
Masumi should be Julius.

00:20:31.606 --> 00:20:32.857 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:20:32.941 --> 00:20:35.527 position:50% align:center
I wanna play the part of
Romeo's friend, Mercutio,

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:38.905 position:50% align:center
and then Itaru could play
Romeo's cousin, Tybalt.

00:20:38.988 --> 00:20:41.408 position:50% align:center
Citron, you would make
a great Friar Lawrence.

00:20:41.491 --> 00:20:44.035 position:50% align:center
[CITRON] The friar does
not have many lines!

00:20:44.119 --> 00:20:45.412 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know.

00:20:45.495 --> 00:20:47.789 position:50% align:center
The characters fit
everyone perfectly!

00:20:47.872 --> 00:20:48.998 position:50% align:center
You just need to get up there

00:20:49.082 --> 00:20:51.042 position:50% align:center
and make sure to
act your butts off!

00:20:51.126 --> 00:20:52.919 position:50% align:center
Yay, I can't wait!

00:20:53.003 --> 00:20:55.296 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI] You're kinda
worked up. You look happy.

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:58.591 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you bet I'm happy,
now we have an amazing script!

00:20:58.675 --> 00:21:01.553 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI groans] I could
write you one, too, ya know.

00:21:01.636 --> 00:21:05.682 position:50% align:center
No, you put all your energy
into acting, please.

00:21:05.765 --> 00:21:07.851 position:50% align:center
We'll finally get to do
a read-through tomorrow.

00:21:07.934 --> 00:21:10.186 position:50% align:center
Isn't that exciting?
So give it your best!

[TSUZURU, CITRON, SAKUYA]
Yes, ma'am!

Get outta the way!

00:21:32.375 --> 00:21:37.422 position:50% align:center
Uh. I, uh...
I brought the script!

00:21:38.757 --> 00:21:40.133 position:50% align:center
[ITARU]
Get the hell out!

00:21:40.216 --> 00:21:45.388 position:50% align:center
Argh! Dammit.
That cost me three kills.

00:21:45.472 --> 00:21:47.599 position:50% align:center
I'll murder you...

00:21:47.682 --> 00:21:50.852 position:50% align:center

[gasps]

00:21:56.191 --> 00:21:58.151 position:50% align:center
Don't just let yourself
into my room.

00:21:58.234 --> 00:22:01.112 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you can see,
I'm incredibly busy in here.

00:22:01.196 --> 00:22:02.530 position:50% align:center
Am I missing something?

00:22:02.614 --> 00:22:04.366 position:50% align:center
It looked like you
were just gaming.

00:22:04.449 --> 00:22:08.870 position:50% align:center
Hey, hold on a minute.
Who are you?

00:22:08.953 --> 00:22:12.123 position:50% align:center
Itaru Chigasaki.

00:22:12.207 --> 00:22:14.125 position:50% align:center
So what?
