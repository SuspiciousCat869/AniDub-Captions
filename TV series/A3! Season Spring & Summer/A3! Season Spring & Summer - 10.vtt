00:00:09.634 --> 00:00:12.220 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Wow, you already
sold seven tickets?

00:00:12.262 --> 00:00:14.639 position:50% align:center
[MUKU] Mm-hm. I convinced
the entire track team

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:15.974 position:50% align:center
to come see our play.

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:18.059 position:50% align:center
Congrats, that's great news.

00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:21.062 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI]
Mm-hm. I agree. Gold medal!

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:23.898 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] How many tickets does
the great genie have left?

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.609 position:50% align:center
Uhh... Two down, eight to go!

00:00:26.651 --> 00:00:28.737 position:50% align:center
Meaning you've barely sold any.

00:00:28.778 --> 00:00:30.864 position:50% align:center
Did you have better luck, Yuki?

00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:33.950 position:50% align:center
I've got six left. Selling
our quota of ten a piece

00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:35.535 position:50% align:center
is harder than I thought.

00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:37.537 position:50% align:center
If you want,
I could help you out.

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.456 position:50% align:center
I've already sold mine,
but could use more.

00:00:39.497 --> 00:00:42.625 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] All of 'em? Mister
Friendly McExtrovert over here.

00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:44.878 position:50% align:center
[MUKU] Sounds like you have
a bunch of friends, Kaz.

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:45.795 position:50% align:center
Heck yeah!

00:00:45.837 --> 00:00:49.257 position:50% align:center
Every day's a struggle replying
to all my messages!

00:02:23.935 --> 00:02:26.646 position:50% align:center
Tonight, I have
another tale to share.

00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:29.441 position:50% align:center
One of a three-year-old
Ali Baba wetting the bed.

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:30.608 position:50% align:center
Don't you dare!

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.943 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
You have ten seconds.

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:36.156 position:50% align:center
[growls] I'll get your
damn water, jeez!

00:02:36.197 --> 00:02:38.616 position:50% align:center
Maybe I rushed into this.

00:02:39.743 --> 00:02:40.952 position:50% align:center
What's the verdict?

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:45.290 position:50% align:center
Well, at least they're better
than the Spring Troupe.

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:47.876 position:50% align:center
But they still have
a long way to go.

00:02:47.917 --> 00:02:50.503 position:50% align:center
So, who exactly
is this Yuzo dude?

00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:54.257 position:50% align:center
He was a member of the
original Spring Troupe.

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.093 position:50% align:center
Must be the one Sakuya
was talkin' about.

00:02:57.135 --> 00:02:58.136 position:50% align:center
[YUZO]
Scheherazade!

00:02:58.178 --> 00:02:59.012 position:50% align:center
[YUKI grunts]

00:02:59.054 --> 00:03:00.805 position:50% align:center
Your delivery's wooden.

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:02.974 position:50% align:center
Start acting like
the second lead.

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:05.352 position:50% align:center
Cause Ali Baba's eclipsing you.

00:03:05.393 --> 00:03:07.771 position:50% align:center
And you sound like
washed up has-been.

00:03:07.812 --> 00:03:09.189 position:50% align:center
You. Aladdin!

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.440 position:50% align:center
Reporting! Sir!

00:03:10.482 --> 00:03:12.901 position:50% align:center
[YUZO] Your interpretation
of the character is weak.

00:03:12.942 --> 00:03:16.196 position:50% align:center
Being a flirt in real life
doesn't make you good actor.

00:03:16.237 --> 00:03:17.572 position:50% align:center
Totally brutal!

00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:19.532 position:50% align:center
--[YUZO] Sinbad!
--Um. Yes, sir?

00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:21.284 position:50% align:center
[YUZO]
Holding back doesn't help you.

00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:22.577 position:50% align:center
Your timid movements and voice

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:24.454 position:50% align:center
draw attention,
and not in a good way.

00:03:24.496 --> 00:03:25.955 position:50% align:center
I'll try harder.

00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:28.792 position:50% align:center
The genie, you're not half bad.

00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:31.461 position:50% align:center
Still, your character
doesn't feel solidified yet.

00:03:31.503 --> 00:03:33.088 position:50% align:center
Nope!

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.424 position:50% align:center
But the worst offender
is Ali Baba.

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:40.470 position:50% align:center
You're the lead, but you don't
have a clue about comedy.

00:03:40.512 --> 00:03:41.805 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:03:41.846 --> 00:03:43.348 position:50% align:center
You're too damn serious.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.684 position:50% align:center
Your timing's for drama,
not humor.

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:49.104 position:50% align:center
Go watch some
stand-up for research.

00:03:49.145 --> 00:03:52.857 position:50% align:center
Hey, you good?

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:56.444 position:50% align:center
Understood, I'll do that.

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:58.947 position:50% align:center
Tenma? Bossed around?

00:03:58.988 --> 00:04:01.783 position:50% align:center
Here's the deal. You're still
a long way from being fit

00:04:01.825 --> 00:04:04.160 position:50% align:center
to perform in front
of an audience.

00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:05.704 position:50% align:center
If you don't want to
embarrass yourselves,

00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:07.455 position:50% align:center
you better improve.

00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:10.959 position:50% align:center
We should all meet and
talk about this stuff.

00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:12.335 position:50% align:center
I can't wait.

00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:13.920 position:50% align:center
I think that's a great idea!

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:15.964 position:50% align:center
How about in the
lounge after dinner?

00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:18.091 position:50% align:center
You can leave the
beverages to moi!

00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:19.801 position:50% align:center
And I'll bring the onigiri!

00:04:19.843 --> 00:04:21.469 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
It's not a party, you know!

00:04:21.511 --> 00:04:24.472 position:50% align:center
These kids, I wasn't
nearly harsh enough.

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:26.474 position:50% align:center
After dealing with
Tenma's criticism,

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:28.018 position:50% align:center
nothing can get them down.

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:29.352 position:50% align:center
You know it's not a party

00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:31.396 position:50% align:center
until someone breaks
out the triangles.

00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:32.981 position:50% align:center
I don't get you.

00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:36.735 position:50% align:center
[YUZO] They'll be an interesting
bunch. Once they polish up.

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:39.487 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Hm? Is something on your mind?

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:41.740 position:50% align:center
[YUZO]
Nah. It's nothing.

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:46.411 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI]
Huh...?

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:47.954 position:50% align:center
What is this?

00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:49.956 position:50% align:center
An eight-millimeter tape player.

00:04:49.998 --> 00:04:51.332 position:50% align:center
Cool.

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:52.751 position:50% align:center
I'll explain.

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:55.170 position:50% align:center
I found this recording
in the storeroom.

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:58.840 position:50% align:center
This baby contains a rehearsal
from the original Summer Troupe.

00:04:58.882 --> 00:05:00.592 position:50% align:center
You mean there's
footage of them?

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:02.344 position:50% align:center
I wanted to show
everyone earlier,

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:04.721 position:50% align:center
but we couldn't find
any way to play the film.

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:06.639 position:50% align:center
There's this tech
junkie I know.

00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:09.642 position:50% align:center
He collects old gear like this
and let me borrow the deck.

00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:12.604 position:50% align:center
Speaking of, care to do
the honors, Sukecchi?

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:14.022 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:05:20.862 --> 00:05:22.447 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
That looks like...

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:24.240 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
...our rehearsal room?

00:05:24.282 --> 00:05:27.369 position:50% align:center
All these years,
and zero remodeling.

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:29.954 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
Who is he?

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:32.499 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
The original troupe's director?

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:33.792 position:50% align:center
That's my dad.

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:34.751 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
What?

00:05:34.793 --> 00:05:36.628 position:50% align:center
You mean "dad" as in your pops?

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.506 position:50% align:center
Meaning you followed
in his footsteps.

00:05:39.547 --> 00:05:41.299 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I guess.

00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:44.427 position:50% align:center
Keep watching.
They're about to start.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.725 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI]
Everyone's so lively.

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:52.394 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
And funny, too.

00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:56.064 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Makes sense why the
director wanted us to watch.

00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:58.024 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
So, they were our predecessors.

00:05:58.066 --> 00:06:01.486 position:50% align:center
Yep. You should've seen the way
they could rouse the audience

00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:02.904 position:50% align:center
and get them laughing.

00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:07.409 position:50% align:center
Actually, exhilarating comedies
were their specialty.

00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:13.790 position:50% align:center
They moved on to other things,
and each of them are gone now.

00:06:13.832 --> 00:06:15.542 position:50% align:center
Even though you can tell
from the recording

00:06:15.583 --> 00:06:16.793 position:50% align:center
they loved acting.

00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:22.424 position:50% align:center
You know, when you think about,
it kinda makes you a little sad.

00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:25.802 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI]
Yeah, melancholy.

00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:28.847 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
That's not gonna happen to us.

00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:30.974 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:06:31.016 --> 00:06:32.600 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess it will

00:06:32.642 --> 00:06:35.854 position:50% align:center
if we don't sell out
the house closing night.

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:38.732 position:50% align:center
You gotta have faith,
Tenten. We'll do it!

00:06:38.773 --> 00:06:40.108 position:50% align:center
Sure, we will!

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.235 position:50% align:center
There's not a doubt in my mind.

00:06:42.277 --> 00:06:44.112 position:50% align:center
I know we can!

00:06:45.947 --> 00:06:51.244 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Isn't that...?

00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:56.958 position:50% align:center
It's a perfect fit.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.126 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Naturally.

00:06:58.168 --> 00:07:01.629 position:50% align:center
So, guys, how do I look?

00:07:03.214 --> 00:07:05.008 position:50% align:center
You make Sinbad look good.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.010 position:50% align:center
Speak for yourself, Yuki!

00:07:07.052 --> 00:07:10.013 position:50% align:center
Check out how floofy
and sparkly everyone is!

00:07:10.055 --> 00:07:14.601 position:50% align:center
Stand together so I can see
how amazing you all look!

00:07:14.642 --> 00:07:16.102 position:50% align:center
Just curious.

00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:19.647 position:50% align:center
Where'd you find the
time to make these?

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:21.775 position:50% align:center
I worked on them
after rehearsals.

00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:23.360 position:50% align:center
Do you ever sleep?

00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:25.028 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
You're amazing, Yuki.

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.281 position:50% align:center
Personally, after practicing,
I'm out like a light.

00:07:28.323 --> 00:07:30.909 position:50% align:center
Really, though, great job!

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.369 position:50% align:center
It's nothing.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:33.703 position:50% align:center
[TENMA chuckles]

00:07:33.745 --> 00:07:38.458 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE] I'm back! Perfect!
You're already changed!

00:07:40.543 --> 00:07:43.254 position:50% align:center
Hey, there. I'm Omi Fushimi.

00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:44.506 position:50% align:center
A photographer?

00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:47.884 position:50% align:center
Remember how I said I wanted
photos to use for promotion?

00:07:47.926 --> 00:07:49.678 position:50% align:center
You went and hired
a professional?

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:51.930 position:50% align:center
I'm in photography
club at college.

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:54.557 position:50% align:center
So competent,
but far from a pro.

00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:56.059 position:50% align:center
Tsuzuru reached out to me.

00:07:56.101 --> 00:07:57.185 position:50% align:center
Oh...

00:07:57.227 --> 00:08:00.689 position:50% align:center
Last time, we left the manager
in charge of photo duties.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.691 position:50% align:center
But I shot that idea down fast.

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:03.942 position:50% align:center
You did?

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:06.444 position:50% align:center
It was pretty rough fixing
everything up last time

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:08.822 position:50% align:center
since all the pictures
sucked so bad.

00:08:08.863 --> 00:08:12.450 position:50% align:center
Plus, we want everyone to see
how fab Yukki's costumes are.

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:14.411 position:50% align:center
I know he's in a club and all,

00:08:14.452 --> 00:08:16.037 position:50% align:center
but don't we want
someone with more,

00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:17.622 position:50% align:center
I dunno, real experience?

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:20.583 position:50% align:center
Says the middle school
costume designer.

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:25.213 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Look, we'll shoot and
see if the photos work for you.

00:08:25.255 --> 00:08:27.340 position:50% align:center
All right, let's get started.

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:49.320 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
Oh, wow! These are sweet!

00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:50.905 position:50% align:center
And so sparkly!

00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:51.865 position:50% align:center
[OMI]
Look good?

00:08:51.906 --> 00:08:55.076 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Yeah, not bad
for a club amateur.

00:08:55.118 --> 00:08:57.787 position:50% align:center
[laughs] Yeah, sure.

00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:00.790 position:50% align:center
[OMI]
Well, I better be heading off.

00:09:00.832 --> 00:09:04.210 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Thanks again
for doing this, see ya.

00:09:04.252 --> 00:09:07.422 position:50% align:center
[OMI] Oh. Would you mind if I
take a look at the theater?

00:09:07.464 --> 00:09:09.591 position:50% align:center
Just real quick.

00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:17.223 position:50% align:center
[OMI] Whoa. The stage
is bigger than I expected.

00:09:17.265 --> 00:09:19.768 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Are you interested in theater?

00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:22.103 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I mean...

00:09:22.145 --> 00:09:24.481 position:50% align:center
Well, probably not in
the way you're thinking.

00:09:24.522 --> 00:09:26.024 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Huh?

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:27.942 position:50% align:center
I wanted to get an
idea of the stage.

00:09:27.984 --> 00:09:31.279 position:50% align:center
Familiarize myself. Plan.

00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:37.410 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Uh. Listen. Take these, please.

00:09:37.452 --> 00:09:39.287 position:50% align:center
They're for the
final performance.

00:09:39.329 --> 00:09:40.872 position:50% align:center
A thank-you for today.

00:09:40.914 --> 00:09:44.209 position:50% align:center
If you're free,
I hope you'll show up.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.670 position:50% align:center
I'll see you closing night.

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:51.341 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
Guys! Quick! Check it out!

00:09:51.383 --> 00:09:52.425 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
What is it?

00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:54.552 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI] I updated the
Mankai Company website.

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:57.263 position:50% align:center
So, you click on
"Summer Troupe" and watch.

00:09:57.305 --> 00:09:58.515 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
The photos from the shoot.

00:09:58.556 --> 00:10:00.016 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
The layout really jumps out.

00:10:00.058 --> 00:10:01.101 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
I know! Right?

00:10:01.142 --> 00:10:02.644 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI]
Triangle windows!

00:10:02.686 --> 00:10:04.521 position:50% align:center
I made those just for you, Sumi.

00:10:04.562 --> 00:10:05.814 position:50% align:center
Thanks!

00:10:05.855 --> 00:10:08.900 position:50% align:center
If it looks good, I'm going
live with the updated site.

00:10:08.942 --> 00:10:10.402 position:50% align:center
Before you do.

00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:11.236 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:13.947 position:50% align:center
Really? What's there
to complain about?

00:10:13.988 --> 00:10:17.534 position:50% align:center
[TENMA] Nothing with you guys.
I'm satisfied with the design.

00:10:17.575 --> 00:10:19.786 position:50% align:center
And the costumes look
great in the photos.

00:10:19.828 --> 00:10:21.287 position:50% align:center
Was that praise I heard?

00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:25.333 position:50% align:center
Aw, yeah! Tenten
gave me a compliment!

00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:26.501 position:50% align:center
One thing...

00:10:26.543 --> 00:10:29.879 position:50% align:center
I'd like you to remove my name
and face from the website.

00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:30.714 position:50% align:center
Why?

00:10:30.755 --> 00:10:33.341 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] What are you talking
about? You're the lead.

00:10:33.383 --> 00:10:35.260 position:50% align:center
I have a celebrity track record.

00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:38.221 position:50% align:center
However, I don't want to
rely on it for this play.

00:10:38.263 --> 00:10:39.097 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
Aw man.

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:42.100 position:50% align:center
We would've sold out in seconds
if people saw you were attached.

00:10:42.142 --> 00:10:44.978 position:50% align:center
Yeah, maybe so,
but it doesn't feel right.

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.605 position:50% align:center
What? Since when have
you ever passed up

00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:49.232 position:50% align:center
the opportunity to
be in the spotlight?

00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:50.608 position:50% align:center
Don't start with me!

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.986 position:50% align:center
Hey, if that's what
Tenten wants.

00:10:53.028 --> 00:10:55.613 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI]
Agreed! I'm okay with it, too!

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:57.490 position:50% align:center
We've still got tickets
left to sell.

00:10:57.532 --> 00:10:59.451 position:50% align:center
But we'll come up
with something!

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:01.953 position:50% align:center
Why couldn't we just
take the easy route?

00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:03.955 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Sorry.

00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:08.543 position:50% align:center
And done! Time to call
up my whole crew!

00:11:09.711 --> 00:11:13.673 position:50% align:center
I am a genie. And I shall
grant you three wishes!

00:11:13.715 --> 00:11:15.675 position:50% align:center
Tell me, what do you desire?

00:11:15.717 --> 00:11:18.636 position:50% align:center
Yeow! My butt caught on fire!

00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:20.138 position:50% align:center
Can't you tell what I want?

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:23.224 position:50% align:center
Do something about the
magician and the serpent!

00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:26.353 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI] The magician and
the serpent, you say?

00:11:27.771 --> 00:11:29.773 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Let's talk about that scene.

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:31.399 position:50% align:center
It's the highlight
of the first act,

00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:33.234 position:50% align:center
so I'm thinking it
might be a good idea

00:11:33.276 --> 00:11:35.779 position:50% align:center
to add more action there.
Any thoughts?

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.113 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that sounds great!

00:11:37.155 --> 00:11:39.657 position:50% align:center
I'm down for more action,
for sure!

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:42.660 position:50% align:center
I'm not convinced that we should
mess with that rhythm, though.

00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:44.829 position:50% align:center
It'll unbalance the whole play.

00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:47.165 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
Hm. Oh, that's a good point.

00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:48.041 position:50% align:center
I know.

00:11:48.083 --> 00:11:51.252 position:50% align:center
But it's the only scene where
the genie has a chance to shine.

00:11:51.294 --> 00:11:53.421 position:50% align:center
Audiences always dig action.

00:11:53.463 --> 00:11:54.923 position:50% align:center
So, I think we should do it.

00:11:54.964 --> 00:11:55.882 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
Mm-hm.

00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:59.511 position:50% align:center
Not so fast. We need to consider
the balance of the play.

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:00.970 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
Yeah. He's right.

00:12:01.012 --> 00:12:02.389 position:50% align:center
The more action,
the more we lose

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.391 position:50% align:center
the subtler elements
of the acting.

00:12:04.432 --> 00:12:05.433 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
That is true!

00:12:05.475 --> 00:12:07.727 position:50% align:center
Hold on, I wanna do
an action scene!

00:12:07.769 --> 00:12:09.938 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
I wanna watch an action scene!

00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:10.897 position:50% align:center
Hey, dude?

00:12:10.939 --> 00:12:13.858 position:50% align:center
All you've done this entire time
is agree with everyone else.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.568 position:50% align:center
So, what's your opinion?

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:21.449 position:50% align:center
Me? Oh, right. I guess...
I'm cool either way!

00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:22.826 position:50% align:center
Meaning what?

00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:25.537 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI] Mm. Well, I think
it'll be great whether we

00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:27.455 position:50% align:center
add new stuff to
the scene or not.

00:12:27.497 --> 00:12:29.457 position:50% align:center
Things always have
a way of working out!

00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:30.583 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
No, make a choice!

00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:32.460 position:50% align:center
Uh, I can't, though!

00:12:32.502 --> 00:12:34.713 position:50% align:center
Cause I totally get what
our director is saying,

00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:37.048 position:50% align:center
but I think you made
a valid point, too.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.341 position:50% align:center
It's tough!

00:12:38.383 --> 00:12:40.802 position:50% align:center
You should really just
decide with Miss Director.

00:12:40.844 --> 00:12:42.637 position:50% align:center
Form your own opinion!

00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:43.888 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:46.016 --> 00:12:49.686 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI] But how can I,
if I'm really okay either way?

00:12:49.728 --> 00:12:52.939 position:50% align:center
All you ever do is laugh
and shrug things off!

00:12:52.981 --> 00:12:55.316 position:50% align:center
Too far, easy.

00:12:56.609 --> 00:12:57.944 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:12:57.986 --> 00:13:01.823 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Let's table the decision
about the action scene for now.

00:13:01.865 --> 00:13:05.118 position:50% align:center
If you guys have any ideas,
let me know.

00:13:07.746 --> 00:13:10.206 position:50% align:center
Hey, everyone!
We're the Mankai Company!

00:13:10.248 --> 00:13:11.166 position:50% align:center
Here's a flyer!

00:13:11.207 --> 00:13:13.835 position:50% align:center
This is our Troupe's
debut performance!

00:13:13.877 --> 00:13:15.337 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A
<i>Water Me!</i>?

00:13:15.378 --> 00:13:17.964 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN B] Does that mean
it's about searching for water?

00:13:18.006 --> 00:13:21.718 position:50% align:center
Yeah! It's based on the
<i>Arabian Nights. </i>Here you go!

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.136 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN C]
Hey, come look!

00:13:23.178 --> 00:13:25.680 position:50% align:center
God Troupe is doing a
street act right over there!

00:13:25.722 --> 00:13:28.058 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN B] What?
With Tasuku and Haruto?

00:13:28.099 --> 00:13:30.101 position:50% align:center
--Let's go!
--Yeah!

00:13:30.143 --> 00:13:32.228 position:50% align:center
What's going on?

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.356 position:50% align:center
No clue.

00:13:34.397 --> 00:13:37.609 position:50% align:center
Oh, Christine!
You're everything to me!

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.444 position:50% align:center
I'm trapped in a world
of darkness,

00:13:39.486 --> 00:13:41.529 position:50% align:center
and you're the only light!

00:13:41.571 --> 00:13:44.240 position:50% align:center
No! Phantom! Be gone!

00:13:44.282 --> 00:13:47.077 position:50% align:center
Your place is down in
the pits of despair.

00:13:47.118 --> 00:13:49.579 position:50% align:center
Woo! Haruto!

00:13:49.621 --> 00:13:52.082 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN B]
Tasuku's so hot!

00:13:52.123 --> 00:13:54.876 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS cheering]

00:13:54.918 --> 00:13:57.879 position:50% align:center
Girls. Check it out!
God Troupe's performing soon.

00:13:57.921 --> 00:13:59.005 position:50% align:center
<i>Phantom of the Opera.</i>

00:13:59.047 --> 00:14:01.383 position:50% align:center
I'll go! I'll go no matter what!

00:14:01.424 --> 00:14:04.511 position:50% align:center
My lady.

00:14:04.552 --> 00:14:08.556 position:50% align:center
Dear Christine,
you are my light.

00:14:08.598 --> 00:14:10.517 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:14:10.558 --> 00:14:14.771 position:50% align:center
He's so cool. Just like a
prince from a shojo manga!

00:14:14.813 --> 00:14:19.150 position:50% align:center
He really has to stoop that
low to pack an audience?

00:14:19.192 --> 00:14:21.277 position:50% align:center
Whoa. Too loud.

00:14:22.821 --> 00:14:25.949 position:50% align:center
[HARUTO]
Hey. Did you just say something?

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:28.535 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] It must've been
your imagination.

00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:31.830 position:50% align:center
What theater troupe are
you guys from, anyway?

00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:36.084 position:50% align:center
The Mankai Company, huh?
Nope, never heard of it.

00:14:36.126 --> 00:14:39.587 position:50% align:center
You're pretty pretentious for
someone from a minor troupe.

00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:40.797 position:50% align:center
Yeah, whatever.

00:14:40.839 --> 00:14:43.341 position:50% align:center
I was just amazed that such
a popular troupe had to

00:14:43.383 --> 00:14:44.926 position:50% align:center
butter people up like that.

00:14:44.968 --> 00:14:46.678 position:50% align:center
Smells a bit like desperation.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.804 position:50% align:center
What?

00:14:47.846 --> 00:14:49.431 position:50% align:center
Hey, Haruto.

00:14:49.472 --> 00:14:50.974 position:50% align:center
[RENI]
What's all the commotion?

00:14:51.016 --> 00:14:52.308 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:56.813 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS gasp]

00:14:59.607 --> 00:15:01.651 position:50% align:center
[HARUTO]
Reni!

00:15:01.693 --> 00:15:04.904 position:50% align:center
[RENI] Is someone from my
troupe causing trouble?

00:15:04.946 --> 00:15:06.072 position:50% align:center
Your troop?

00:15:06.114 --> 00:15:07.949 position:50% align:center
Yes, I'm their manager.

00:15:07.991 --> 00:15:12.704 position:50% align:center
Reni Kamikizaka.
Was Haruto harassing you?

00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:14.706 position:50% align:center
Not really, It's fine.

00:15:14.748 --> 00:15:18.335 position:50% align:center
I apologize. He can be a bit
hot-blooded at times.

00:15:18.376 --> 00:15:21.963 position:50% align:center
So, you're handing out flyers,
as well? For what show?

00:15:22.005 --> 00:15:24.799 position:50% align:center
Oh! Here, please have one.

00:15:24.841 --> 00:15:26.343 position:50% align:center
Yes, thank you.

00:15:26.384 --> 00:15:29.596 position:50% align:center
Ah. You're doing
the <i>Arabian Nights</i>?

00:15:29.637 --> 00:15:31.389 position:50% align:center
Mm-hm...

00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:34.851 position:50% align:center
Mankai Company. Interesting.

00:15:38.355 --> 00:15:40.398 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.441 position:50% align:center
[YUKI gasps]

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:49.115 position:50% align:center
Well, that's weird.

00:15:49.157 --> 00:15:51.284 position:50% align:center
[RENI]
Come on, boys. Let's go.

00:15:51.326 --> 00:15:53.203 position:50% align:center
[HARUTO]
Yes, sir.

00:15:57.457 --> 00:15:58.458 position:50% align:center
What the heck?

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.920 position:50% align:center
Guess I learned something today.
Like member, like manager.

00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:05.173 position:50% align:center
I don't know. It's like as soon
as he saw we were Mankai,

00:16:05.215 --> 00:16:07.676 position:50% align:center
his attitude did
this complete 180.

00:16:07.717 --> 00:16:11.930 position:50% align:center
Snob. So rude. He realized
we're a minor theater.

00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:14.140 position:50% align:center
Yeah, maybe.

00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:29.114 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Kazunari?

00:16:29.155 --> 00:16:31.324 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
Hey, Miss Director.

00:16:31.366 --> 00:16:35.245 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Whatcha doin'?
Hanging out here all alone?

00:16:35.286 --> 00:16:37.497 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you know.

00:16:37.539 --> 00:16:39.749 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
What? Is it about today?

00:16:39.791 --> 00:16:41.918 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI laughs]

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:44.421 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI]
Triangle leap!

00:16:44.462 --> 00:16:45.672 position:50% align:center
Sumi?

00:16:45.714 --> 00:16:47.340 position:50% align:center
What on earth are you doing?

00:16:47.382 --> 00:16:49.259 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI chuckles]
No big deal.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.177 position:50% align:center
I just went out
to find triangles.

00:16:51.219 --> 00:16:52.095 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Huh?

00:16:52.137 --> 00:16:54.305 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI]
Yeah, a shortcut!

00:16:54.347 --> 00:16:56.933 position:50% align:center
Okay. I guess you
could call it that.

00:16:56.975 --> 00:16:59.102 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI]
Why? What were you guys doing?

00:16:59.144 --> 00:17:00.562 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Uh.

00:17:00.603 --> 00:17:04.816 position:50% align:center
Since you're both here,
can I talk to you guys?

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:09.821 position:50% align:center
[gasps] There you are.

00:17:09.863 --> 00:17:13.700 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Did you hand out
all the flyers?

00:17:13.742 --> 00:17:16.411 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Most of them.

00:17:16.453 --> 00:17:20.081 position:50% align:center
So, listen, about today.

00:17:20.123 --> 00:17:22.834 position:50% align:center
Did you have to get so angry?

00:17:25.086 --> 00:17:26.963 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
You see, all the way through

00:17:27.005 --> 00:17:28.548 position:50% align:center
the end of middle school,

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.592 position:50% align:center
I was a loner with no friends.

00:17:30.633 --> 00:17:33.219 position:50% align:center
--What?
--I can't believe that.

00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:36.139 position:50% align:center
Yep. Then, I guess you could say

00:17:36.181 --> 00:17:38.683 position:50% align:center
that I turned over a
new leaf in high school.

00:17:38.725 --> 00:17:41.936 position:50% align:center
Thing was, I was so obsessed
with upping my friend count,

00:17:41.978 --> 00:17:45.357 position:50% align:center
I kinda got used to repeating
what people wanted to hear.

00:17:45.398 --> 00:17:48.109 position:50% align:center
I don't get why he won't he
say what he really thinks.

00:17:48.151 --> 00:17:50.945 position:50% align:center
I think he just didn't
want to make any waves.

00:17:50.987 --> 00:17:52.822 position:50% align:center
[TENMA] He was pretty
opinionated about the photos,

00:17:52.864 --> 00:17:55.450 position:50% align:center
though, right? He made
specific requests because

00:17:55.492 --> 00:17:58.119 position:50% align:center
he wanted them to live up
to a certain standard.

00:17:58.161 --> 00:18:00.997 position:50% align:center
Why can't he say anything
when it comes to acting?

00:18:01.039 --> 00:18:03.792 position:50% align:center
But now, since I'm a
part of this troupe,

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:05.877 position:50% align:center
I've decided I can't
stay that way.

00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:08.922 position:50% align:center
It doesn't do me or
anyone else any good.

00:18:08.963 --> 00:18:11.299 position:50% align:center
If I keep sucking up to people
and saying stuff that won't

00:18:11.341 --> 00:18:14.177 position:50% align:center
upset them, then,
they won't know me.

00:18:14.219 --> 00:18:18.765 position:50% align:center
And I'll only ever have
shallow friendships, so...

00:18:21.976 --> 00:18:24.604 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
This is it.

00:18:24.646 --> 00:18:26.690 position:50% align:center
It's time.

00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:30.318 position:50% align:center
I can't do that with
the troupe, I won't.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:34.948 position:50% align:center
I want to connect...
on a deeper level.

00:18:34.989 --> 00:18:38.743 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:38.785 --> 00:18:42.747 position:50% align:center
I wanna connect
with you, too, Kaz.

00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:44.290 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:18:44.332 --> 00:18:46.292 position:50% align:center
And that's not just Misumi.

00:18:46.334 --> 00:18:48.378 position:50% align:center
I think everyone feels that way.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.171 position:50% align:center
Even Tenma, I'm sure!

00:18:50.213 --> 00:18:52.298 position:50% align:center
I know that he has a vision.

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:55.301 position:50% align:center
And as one of his fellow
performers on stage,

00:18:55.343 --> 00:18:57.429 position:50% align:center
I want to know where
he's coming from.

00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:00.765 position:50% align:center
We have to communicate honestly.

00:19:00.807 --> 00:19:04.352 position:50% align:center
We have to. It's the
only way we'll grow.

00:19:21.119 --> 00:19:23.455 position:50% align:center
--[KAZUNARI] Hey, guys?
--[GROUP] Hm?

00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:26.416 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI] Can I say something
before we start?

00:19:26.458 --> 00:19:30.795 position:50% align:center
It's about Sumi's action
scene from yesterday.

00:19:30.837 --> 00:19:32.839 position:50% align:center
Go ahead.

00:19:32.881 --> 00:19:35.467 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI] Well, this is
our debut show, right?

00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:37.552 position:50% align:center
So, let's take that
opportunity to show off

00:19:37.594 --> 00:19:40.263 position:50% align:center
our individual personalities.

00:19:40.305 --> 00:19:41.181 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
What do you mean?

00:19:41.222 --> 00:19:44.517 position:50% align:center
Like, think of it
as an introduction.

00:19:44.559 --> 00:19:46.394 position:50% align:center
I think it could be
really smart to have

00:19:46.436 --> 00:19:48.938 position:50% align:center
Sumi flaunt some of
his moves, you know?

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.440 position:50% align:center
Will it serve the play?

00:19:50.482 --> 00:19:52.984 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
That is an important question.

00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:55.653 position:50% align:center
But I think it wouldn't
take anything away.

00:19:55.695 --> 00:19:57.739 position:50% align:center
And it's something
the audience would love.

00:19:57.781 --> 00:20:02.494 position:50% align:center
I could see that. And you?
What do you say?

00:20:02.535 --> 00:20:06.122 position:50% align:center
What do you say? It's your turn.

00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:09.125 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
I agree.

00:20:09.167 --> 00:20:10.293 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:20:11.461 --> 00:20:14.005 position:50% align:center
I'll put some thought
into that option, then.

00:20:14.047 --> 00:20:17.008 position:50% align:center
Look at you! You can voice
your own opinions.

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:18.885 position:50% align:center
You should've spoken up sooner.

00:20:18.927 --> 00:20:20.637 position:50% align:center
No kidding.

00:20:22.055 --> 00:20:24.015 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:20:27.769 --> 00:20:31.981 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir?
May I ask who you are?

00:20:32.023 --> 00:20:34.567 position:50% align:center
Hello, it's very
nice to meet you.

00:20:36.027 --> 00:20:39.864 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Oh, I see.
So, you're Tenma's manager?

00:20:39.906 --> 00:20:43.702 position:50% align:center
What do you want?
I told you to never come here.

00:20:43.743 --> 00:20:46.913 position:50% align:center
It's just... I'm sorry
to say that your father

00:20:46.955 --> 00:20:48.957 position:50% align:center
found out about
this theater troupe.

00:20:48.998 --> 00:20:50.709 position:50% align:center
He what?

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:53.003 position:50% align:center
What? Wait just a minute!

00:20:53.044 --> 00:20:54.921 position:50% align:center
Didn't I call your parents
when you joined up?

00:20:54.963 --> 00:20:56.589 position:50% align:center
I could've sworn I did!

00:20:56.631 --> 00:20:59.050 position:50% align:center
I distinctly remember
leaving them a voicemail.

00:20:59.092 --> 00:21:01.052 position:50% align:center
That was my number you called.

00:21:01.094 --> 00:21:02.012 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Huh?

00:21:02.053 --> 00:21:04.431 position:50% align:center
[IGAWA]
Sorry, Tenma made me keep quiet.

00:21:04.472 --> 00:21:06.391 position:50% align:center
Igawa is basically my parent.

00:21:06.433 --> 00:21:10.186 position:50% align:center
He's my guardian when they're
away. What else could I do?

00:21:10.228 --> 00:21:11.938 position:50% align:center
It's near impossible
to get ahold of them

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:15.942 position:50% align:center
when they're overseas, anyway.
So, what does it matter?

00:21:15.984 --> 00:21:20.905 position:50% align:center
About that. Your father
has actually returned home.

00:21:20.947 --> 00:21:23.033 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:23.074 --> 00:21:25.285 position:50% align:center
Basically, he discovered
that you turned down

00:21:25.326 --> 00:21:27.454 position:50% align:center
a movie offer in order
to do this thing.

00:21:27.495 --> 00:21:30.749 position:50% align:center
He says you should prioritize
a movie over a play.

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:32.709 position:50% align:center
What the hell does that mean?

00:21:32.751 --> 00:21:35.378 position:50% align:center
He never cared,
but now he has an opinion?

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:37.714 position:50% align:center
Listen, I'm sorry,
but you gotta discuss this

00:21:37.756 --> 00:21:39.966 position:50% align:center
with your parents, Tenma!

00:21:40.884 --> 00:21:44.763 position:50% align:center
Fine, I will.
I'll go home for now.

00:21:44.804 --> 00:21:46.556 position:50% align:center
Then I guess that's that.

00:21:46.598 --> 00:21:48.683 position:50% align:center
You all have my deepest regrets.

00:21:48.725 --> 00:21:51.394 position:50% align:center
But please begin your search for
a replacement, immediately.

00:21:51.436 --> 00:21:52.270 position:50% align:center
What?

00:21:52.312 --> 00:21:53.438 position:50% align:center
The hell did you say?

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.398 position:50% align:center
[IGAWA]
Your father will insist.

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:59.402 position:50% align:center
[TENMA] Then I'll go convince
him myself. C'mon, Igawa!

00:21:59.444 --> 00:22:00.278 position:50% align:center
Wait, what?

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.238 position:50% align:center
Tenten?

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:07.035 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Listen up. Don't you guys worry.

00:22:07.077 --> 00:22:11.581 position:50% align:center
You can trust me. I'll be
with you on that stage!
