Hmph.

Hey, Boss,
is that a smile I see?

[FURUICHI grunts]

00:00:23.398 --> 00:00:25.859 position:50% align:center
We're not stickin'
around to watch?

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.528 position:50% align:center
The theater's only saved if
they sell out closing night.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.238 position:50% align:center
Nothing else matters.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.699 position:50% align:center
Whatever you say, Boss!

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:50.759 position:50% align:center
How's it already showtime?

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.511 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA] Feels like we
started rehearsing yesterday.

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:55.347 position:50% align:center
Since it's our first run
with an audience,

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:56.806 position:50% align:center
there might be some hiccups.

00:00:56.848 --> 00:00:59.601 position:50% align:center
If something happens out there,
have each other's backs.

00:00:59.642 --> 00:01:01.561 position:50% align:center
I'll see what I can do.

00:01:01.603 --> 00:01:03.021 position:50% align:center
[ITARU]
How are the ticket sales?

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:04.397 position:50% align:center
We still have some left,

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.025 position:50% align:center
but we'll sell more when
the positive reviews roll in.

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:10.403 position:50% align:center
Word of mouth! If we
do our best every show,

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:12.530 position:50% align:center
the audience should
just keep getting bigger!

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:13.823 position:50% align:center
On top of that,

00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:16.409 position:50% align:center
we're putting in a different
twist every performance.

00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:19.162 position:50% align:center
Which should have them
coming back for more.

00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:21.790 position:50% align:center
We've gotta keep the
momentum going, right?

00:01:21.831 --> 00:01:23.708 position:50% align:center
Do like we rehearsed,
we'll be fine.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.544 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA] Mm. Gotta trust
the effort we put in.

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:28.963 position:50% align:center
The Director, all of us.

A Mankai Company production

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:45.438 position:50% align:center
Looks like they
sold more tickets.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.357 position:50% align:center
Before the performance begins,

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.318 position:50% align:center
we have a couple rules
for the audience...

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.321 position:50% align:center
All right. Hope it's good.

00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:55.573 position:50% align:center
They should be jittery, not you.

00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:57.617 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE] The performance
will begin shortly.

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.496 position:50% align:center
Please have a seat
and enjoy the show.

00:02:01.538 --> 00:02:03.832 position:50% align:center
Is everyone ready?

00:02:03.873 --> 00:02:05.959 position:50% align:center
Let's do this.

00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:08.336 position:50% align:center
Leave everything onstage.

00:02:08.378 --> 00:02:10.213 position:50% align:center
You shaking, too?

00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:12.632 position:50% align:center
Only cause I'm excited!

[IZUMI]
My work is done for now.

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:16.928 position:50% align:center
I can't go on stage
with the actors.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.222 position:50% align:center
Only watch and pray.

00:02:19.264 --> 00:02:20.640 position:50% align:center
You're on.

00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:22.642 position:50% align:center
Ready for your first show?

00:02:22.684 --> 00:02:24.269 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Yeah!

00:04:14.004 --> 00:04:17.382 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE] Our story takes
place in Verona, Italy.

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:21.261 position:50% align:center
Where two families, House
Capulet and House Montague,

00:04:21.302 --> 00:04:25.306 position:50% align:center
are engaged in a
long-standing feud.

00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:28.309 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
It's finally time.

00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:32.022 position:50% align:center
Today, I shall invite Rosaline
to the party!

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.406 position:50% align:center
Yes. If you're not busy,

00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:42.782 position:50% align:center
I'd like to buy this
lovely bouquet.

00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:45.201 position:50% align:center
A bouquet, please.

00:04:45.243 --> 00:04:48.580 position:50% align:center
Addressed to Rosaline.

00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:49.414 position:50% align:center
What?

00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:51.166 position:50% align:center
And who might you be?

00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:52.625 position:50% align:center
My name's Romeo!

00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:56.171 position:50% align:center
And I'm inviting my beloved
Rosaline to the party.

00:04:56.212 --> 00:04:57.672 position:50% align:center
Your beloved?

00:04:57.714 --> 00:04:59.591 position:50% align:center
You're living in a fantasy.

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:02.802 position:50% align:center
Because she's attending with me.

00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:05.722 position:50% align:center
Or my name's not Julius!

00:05:09.184 --> 00:05:11.644 position:50% align:center
[BOTH gasp]
Fair Rosaline!

00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:13.480 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
Please accept these flowers!

00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:18.360 position:50% align:center
Roses! From my hand, seeing how
I'm the one who paid for them.

00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:20.862 position:50% align:center
[CROWD laughs]

00:05:20.904 --> 00:05:22.864 position:50% align:center
She's gone.

00:05:22.906 --> 00:05:24.616 position:50% align:center
Looks like someone got rejected.

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:26.993 position:50% align:center
As if you're one to talk!
We both were!

00:05:27.035 --> 00:05:29.037 position:50% align:center
What'd you say?

00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:33.291 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laughing]

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:35.418 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
They met as rivals in love.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.379 position:50% align:center
But after they resolved
their conflict,

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.757 position:50% align:center
the two ended up becoming
the best of friends.

00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:42.384 position:50% align:center
A whole world's out there.

00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:45.428 position:50% align:center
And it's just waiting
to be discovered.

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.015 position:50% align:center
Eventually, I'll have the chance
to see it with my own eyes.

00:05:49.057 --> 00:05:51.434 position:50% align:center
It sounds like we share
the same dream.

00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:55.271 position:50% align:center
There's only one thing
for us to do.

00:05:55.313 --> 00:05:58.066 position:50% align:center
Let's go on an
adventure, together.

00:05:58.108 --> 00:06:00.443 position:50% align:center
I say we ditch
this town for good,

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:02.529 position:50% align:center
and go travel the world!

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:07.701 position:50% align:center
I'm in. With your brawn, Romeo,
combined with my intellect,

00:06:07.742 --> 00:06:11.246 position:50% align:center
I'm positive we can
achieve anything.

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:19.921 position:50% align:center
You're right! As a team,
nothing can hold us back!

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:24.009 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU] Later, the two friends
meet again at the party.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.012 position:50% align:center
Where they discover their
families are enemies.

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:30.181 position:50% align:center
Mercutio invites Romeo
to the event.

00:06:30.223 --> 00:06:31.933 position:50% align:center
Which means I'm up.

00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:34.185 position:50% align:center
After all this time...

00:06:37.355 --> 00:06:38.690 position:50% align:center
You know,

00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:41.776 position:50% align:center
when I was still in school, I
decided to join the drama club.

00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:42.694 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Hm?

00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:44.988 position:50% align:center
We started rehearsals
and everything.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.032 position:50% align:center
But my younger brother
caught a fever.

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:48.825 position:50% align:center
So, I ended up quitting.

00:06:48.867 --> 00:06:51.453 position:50% align:center
Since it probably
wouldn't've worked out.

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:56.791 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU] Thing is, the fever
thing was just an excuse.

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:59.085 position:50% align:center
I could've found
a way to make it work.

00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:02.380 position:50% align:center
But I chose to give up
without a fight.

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:05.425 position:50% align:center
Then ended up blaming
the family I loved,

00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:08.553 position:50% align:center
because I was the one
who couldn't commit.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.684 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU] Enough.
I'm through with regrets!

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:17.479 position:50% align:center
Mercutio!

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.023 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?
You get your heart broken?

00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:21.274 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about it.

00:07:21.316 --> 00:07:24.110 position:50% align:center
The sea is vast and
full of fish, my friend.

00:07:24.152 --> 00:07:28.865 position:50% align:center
I know a party that will
take your mind off things.

00:07:28.907 --> 00:07:30.283 position:50% align:center
Romeo.

00:07:30.325 --> 00:07:32.118 position:50% align:center
You're Romeo Montague?

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.161 position:50% align:center
Answer me.

00:07:33.203 --> 00:07:36.998 position:50% align:center
Is it true you were born and
raised in House Montague?

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.375 position:50% align:center
I am.

00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:41.419 position:50% align:center
And you're Julius
from House of Capulet?

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.048 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:49.260 position:50% align:center
[ITARU]
If this continues,

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:52.514 position:50% align:center
we'll be forced to declare war
against House Montague.

00:07:52.555 --> 00:07:53.807 position:50% align:center
A war?

00:07:53.848 --> 00:07:55.058 position:50% align:center
You can't.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.601 position:50% align:center
Julius, wait!

00:07:56.643 --> 00:07:58.937 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI gasping]
Romeo!

00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:02.148 position:50% align:center
But he's my friend!

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.317 position:50% align:center
Romeo!

00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:11.658 position:50% align:center
Oh, Romeo, why do you
have to be Romeo Montague?

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.910 position:50% align:center
Forsake your home
and name, Julius.

00:08:13.952 --> 00:08:17.914 position:50% align:center
After all, don't we have an
even grander dream to share?

00:08:17.956 --> 00:08:24.170 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry. But I can't--
I cannot forsake my family.

00:08:24.212 --> 00:08:26.381 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI grunts]

00:08:26.423 --> 00:08:28.800 position:50% align:center
[YUZO] Romeo and Julius
were in a pinch,

00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:32.387 position:50% align:center
and so they visited Friar
Laurence for advice.

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:34.723 position:50% align:center
Your turn.

00:08:34.764 --> 00:08:39.060 position:50% align:center
[CITRON] I practiced the lines I
had trouble with over and over.

00:08:39.102 --> 00:08:41.479 position:50% align:center
Tsuzuru even helped out
by making adjustments

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:44.566 position:50% align:center
to the script up until
the last minute.

00:08:46.109 --> 00:08:47.736 position:50% align:center
I will assist you.

00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:50.030 position:50% align:center
The seeds of strife
will be uprooted.

00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:51.990 position:50% align:center
I know in my heart,

00:08:52.032 --> 00:08:53.241 position:50% align:center
good will come of this!

00:08:53.283 --> 00:08:55.744 position:50% align:center
May God bless your journey.

00:08:57.704 --> 00:08:59.622 position:50% align:center
A Montague, you say?

00:08:59.664 --> 00:09:01.958 position:50% align:center
We must proceed carefully,
for there's no telling

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.085 position:50% align:center
what will happen on
a night such as this.

00:09:04.127 --> 00:09:07.839 position:50% align:center
One day, this whole town's
future will hinge on you, Romeo.

00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:11.634 position:50% align:center
And when that time comes,
I will always be by your side.

00:09:11.676 --> 00:09:14.554 position:50% align:center
Montagues are the
greatest of calamities!

00:09:14.596 --> 00:09:17.891 position:50% align:center
Their house is an affliction
and must be stamped out!

00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:20.477 position:50% align:center
Can't you see I'm worried
about your safety?

00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:22.771 position:50% align:center
Allow me to protect you!

00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:24.314 position:50% align:center
This is for Julius!

00:09:24.356 --> 00:09:26.524 position:50% align:center

You seem more serious

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:21.871 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:26.710 position:50% align:center
Did you really think House
Montague would escape its fate?

00:10:30.922 --> 00:10:32.799 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:32.841 --> 00:10:36.720 position:50% align:center
Try as you might,
there's no outrunning it.

00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:42.183 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Although Mercutio
and Tybalt survived,

00:10:42.225 --> 00:10:44.394 position:50% align:center
Romeo confessed to his crime.

00:10:44.436 --> 00:10:47.147 position:50% align:center
A judgment was passed down
for the role he played.

00:10:47.188 --> 00:10:48.690 position:50% align:center
He was sentenced to death.

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:52.944 position:50% align:center
I have to find a way to
save him. What should I do?

00:10:52.986 --> 00:10:57.032 position:50% align:center
I know of a potion which allows
the drinker to feign death.

00:10:57.073 --> 00:11:00.618 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI] Hold on until I return,
Romeo. Don't die.

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.079 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] So, Julius set off
in search of the potion

00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:06.207 position:50% align:center
that would mimic eternal sleep.

00:11:06.249 --> 00:11:10.754 position:50% align:center
Later, on the day Romeo
was to be executed...

00:11:10.795 --> 00:11:12.255 position:50% align:center
Forgive me.

00:11:12.297 --> 00:11:16.134 position:50% align:center
I promised to go on a journey
with you, didn't I?

00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:17.927 position:50% align:center
Julius!

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.433 position:50% align:center
Now, die Romeo!

00:11:27.062 --> 00:11:28.188 position:50% align:center
What're you doing?

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:30.398 position:50% align:center
Stop fighting!
I thought we were friends!

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.649 position:50% align:center
Impossible!

00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:35.695 position:50% align:center
Are you not Romeo?
Of House Montague!

00:11:43.661 --> 00:11:45.246 position:50% align:center

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.970 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] I can feel
their energy from here.

00:12:10.814 --> 00:12:12.982 position:50% align:center
Romeo!

00:12:13.024 --> 00:12:15.151 position:50% align:center
Julius!

[gasps]

00:12:31.501 --> 00:12:34.045 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI] I'll wait
where we agreed to meet.

00:12:34.087 --> 00:12:36.172 position:50% align:center
That's quite enough.

00:12:39.342 --> 00:12:43.304 position:50% align:center
Now I see. You came
to give me this.

00:13:00.864 --> 00:13:03.033 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
It's the final scene.

00:13:26.973 --> 00:13:28.767 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI] I'm not much
for physical labor

00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:32.812 position:50% align:center
in the first place. I'm never
climbing up a mountain again.

00:13:32.854 --> 00:13:34.272 position:50% align:center
Sorry, friend.

00:13:34.314 --> 00:13:36.107 position:50% align:center
But I'll make it up
to you next time.

00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:38.193 position:50% align:center
I can fetch the
potion ingredients.

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:39.361 position:50% align:center
Excuse me?

00:13:39.402 --> 00:13:42.322 position:50% align:center
But I how many times are we
planning to go through this?

00:13:42.364 --> 00:13:44.324 position:50% align:center
Julius, it's time!

00:13:44.366 --> 00:13:46.576 position:50% align:center
Just as we promised that day.

00:13:46.618 --> 00:13:50.622 position:50% align:center
We're going on a quest...
to see the world!

00:14:00.507 --> 00:14:05.387 position:50% align:center
[applause]

00:14:08.598 --> 00:14:10.809 position:50% align:center
So, that's-- that's
applause, right?

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:11.935 position:50% align:center
Quite a crowd.

00:14:11.976 --> 00:14:13.061 position:50% align:center
Amazing.

00:14:13.103 --> 00:14:15.313 position:50% align:center
It sounds like a storm.

00:14:15.355 --> 00:14:18.483 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Hey! Why are you spacing out?

00:14:18.525 --> 00:14:19.693 position:50% align:center
Take a bow!

00:14:19.734 --> 00:14:22.987 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Right!

00:14:58.606 --> 00:15:02.485 position:50% align:center
[applause]

00:15:04.279 --> 00:15:07.782 position:50% align:center
Thank you, we appreciate it!

00:15:07.824 --> 00:15:09.075 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI chuckles]

00:15:11.786 --> 00:15:15.498 position:50% align:center
Thank you all very much!

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.876 position:50% align:center
Thank you for everything!

00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:22.130 position:50% align:center
We love each of you so much!

00:15:35.101 --> 00:15:38.355 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A] Today was great, too!
This was my third time!

00:15:38.396 --> 00:15:40.482 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN B] Yeah, they use
a little improv, right?

00:15:40.523 --> 00:15:42.400 position:50% align:center
So, each one's really different.

00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:45.320 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN C]
Can't wait for closing night!

00:15:45.362 --> 00:15:48.406 position:50% align:center
Hey, guys! I was thinking
we might...

00:15:55.163 --> 00:15:57.957 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Well, what do I expect
after consecutive shows

00:15:57.999 --> 00:16:01.503 position:50% align:center
and those constant
late-night meetings?

00:16:01.544 --> 00:16:04.464 position:50% align:center
Director!
I am about to freak out!

00:16:04.506 --> 00:16:06.466 position:50% align:center
Hey, dude. Is it morning?

00:16:06.508 --> 00:16:09.177 position:50% align:center
It's... it's... it's--
[stuttering]

00:16:09.219 --> 00:16:10.720 position:50% align:center
Hey, take a deep breath!

00:16:10.762 --> 00:16:12.263 position:50% align:center
Calm down and
tell me what happened.

00:16:12.305 --> 00:16:16.851 position:50% align:center
[inhales, exhales]

00:16:16.893 --> 00:16:20.230 position:50% align:center
We've done it.
Closing night's sold out!

00:16:20.271 --> 00:16:21.272 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:24.859 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE] It's true! We sold
the last seat a minute ago!

00:16:24.901 --> 00:16:26.861 position:50% align:center
What's a hold-out?

00:16:26.903 --> 00:16:29.531 position:50% align:center
So, wait. Doesn't that mean...?

00:16:30.532 --> 00:16:34.285 position:50% align:center
The theatre's safe,
and it's all thanks to you guys!

00:16:34.327 --> 00:16:37.497 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Woo-hoo!

00:16:37.539 --> 00:16:39.499 position:50% align:center
Masumi, c'mon, wake up!

00:16:39.541 --> 00:16:41.501 position:50% align:center
We did it!
Closing night sold out!

00:16:41.543 --> 00:16:43.461 position:50% align:center
Cool. Now, stop.

00:16:43.503 --> 00:16:46.673 position:50% align:center
[CITRON]
Yes! We did it, Itaru!

00:16:46.715 --> 00:16:50.093 position:50% align:center
Oh, forgive me,
am I too enthusiastic?

00:16:50.135 --> 00:16:53.471 position:50% align:center
Oh, you're all right.
But get off, now.

00:16:53.513 --> 00:16:55.849 position:50% align:center
We have two days
till closing night.

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:58.643 position:50% align:center
So, guys.
Let's finish with no regrets!

00:16:58.685 --> 00:16:59.561 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Yeah!

00:16:59.602 --> 00:17:02.105 position:50% align:center
You can count on me!

00:17:08.278 --> 00:17:09.529 position:50% align:center
Happened at today's show, huh?

00:17:09.571 --> 00:17:12.490 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Man, you scared me.
What do you mean?

00:17:12.532 --> 00:17:16.619 position:50% align:center
Itaru, there is no point
in playing numb.

00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:20.373 position:50% align:center
I twisted it a bit.
But I can get through two days.

00:17:20.415 --> 00:17:23.376 position:50% align:center
Just don't tell Izumi
or the others.

00:17:23.418 --> 00:17:25.795 position:50% align:center
Speak up if you
can't go on, though.

00:17:25.837 --> 00:17:28.131 position:50% align:center
You have to promise.

00:17:29.299 --> 00:17:31.176 position:50% align:center
Yeah, okay.

00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:44.022 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
Yep, it's a full house!

00:17:44.064 --> 00:17:47.901 position:50% align:center
Everyone has pretty high
expectations of the troupe now.

00:17:49.319 --> 00:17:50.445 position:50% align:center
[ITARU grunts]

00:17:52.405 --> 00:17:53.615 position:50% align:center
Heads-up, comin' in!

00:17:53.656 --> 00:17:56.451 position:50% align:center
I came to watch,
as we agreed.

00:17:56.493 --> 00:17:59.287 position:50% align:center
And it's a full house.
Also as agreed.

00:17:59.329 --> 00:18:00.955 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI]
So, it seems.

00:18:00.997 --> 00:18:03.375 position:50% align:center
I'll put a hold
on the demolition.

00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:05.001 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad.

00:18:05.043 --> 00:18:06.961 position:50% align:center
However, there's still no point

00:18:07.003 --> 00:18:09.047 position:50% align:center
unless you can
satisfy your audience.

00:18:09.089 --> 00:18:11.424 position:50% align:center
Securing regular patrons
is a necessity.

00:18:11.466 --> 00:18:14.260 position:50% align:center
You must bring in stable
revenue for the troupe.

00:18:14.302 --> 00:18:16.888 position:50% align:center
To do that, you must not
only continue to put on

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:17.722 position:50% align:center
high quality performances...

00:18:17.764 --> 00:18:19.391 position:50% align:center

another lecture.

What's so funny?!

00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:25.939 position:50% align:center
Nothing. It's just that
you're surprisingly concerned

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.899 position:50% align:center
about the fate of the troupe.

00:18:29.192 --> 00:18:30.402 position:50% align:center

[GROUP]
Huh?

00:20:43.535 --> 00:20:45.370 position:50% align:center
I'll be fine.

00:20:46.663 --> 00:20:49.374 position:50% align:center
I'm just feeling a
little overwhelmed.

00:20:49.416 --> 00:20:51.918 position:50% align:center
I've never felt this before.

00:20:52.919 --> 00:20:55.630 position:50% align:center
I'm really happy.

00:20:55.672 --> 00:20:57.549 position:50% align:center
Wait, if that's
the case, then...

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:00.593 position:50% align:center
Does it mean that you've decided
you'll stay with the troupe?

00:21:04.347 --> 00:21:05.515 position:50% align:center
I guess so.

00:21:05.557 --> 00:21:08.977 position:50% align:center

[IZUMI]
I know one thing, for sure.

00:21:17.902 --> 00:21:20.447 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] They'll remember
this show, and this night,

00:21:20.488 --> 00:21:22.615 position:50% align:center
for the rest of their lives.

[FURUICHI] What's got you
looking so smug?

00:23:07.137 --> 00:23:09.347 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Sakyo!

00:23:09.389 --> 00:23:11.433 position:50% align:center
You better keep moving,
you know.

00:23:11.474 --> 00:23:13.351 position:50% align:center
So far, all you've
accomplished is producing

00:23:13.393 --> 00:23:17.147 position:50% align:center
the Spring Troupe's
first show. So?

00:23:17.188 --> 00:23:19.733 position:50% align:center
Do you have potential members
for the Summer Troupe?

00:23:19.774 --> 00:23:21.026 position:50% align:center
There's a plan.

00:23:21.067 --> 00:23:24.070 position:50% align:center
We'll definitely recruit again.

00:23:24.112 --> 00:23:28.241 position:50% align:center
But there are also a few I want
to reach out to personally.

Mankai Company, huh?
