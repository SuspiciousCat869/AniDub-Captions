[SAKUYA]
Thank you very much!

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:20.395 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] I know you guys are
probably still a little anxious,

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:22.689 position:50% align:center
but if we focus on
one show at time,

00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:25.442 position:50% align:center
we'll be back on our
feet before we know it.

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:30.655 position:50% align:center
There you go, making
that hack face again.

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:31.906 position:50% align:center
Elaborate.

00:00:31.948 --> 00:00:34.617 position:50% align:center
Well, at least you can
still talk back.

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:35.744 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Hmph.

00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:39.039 position:50% align:center
Hey, man! If anything happens
to you, we got your back!

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.708 position:50% align:center
He's right. I'm gonna be
doing my best out there.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.293 position:50% align:center
Like you taught me.

00:00:43.335 --> 00:00:44.669 position:50% align:center
You guys...

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:49.466 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI] Tenma, I decided
to let you borrow this.

00:00:49.507 --> 00:00:51.092 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Is this a ruler?

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:52.677 position:50% align:center
That's my good luck charm!

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.056 position:50% align:center
And the most precious
triangle I own!

00:00:56.097 --> 00:00:57.265 position:50% align:center
This means a lot.

00:00:57.307 --> 00:00:58.516 position:50% align:center
Good luck!

00:00:58.558 --> 00:00:59.642 position:50% align:center
Hey, listen.

00:00:59.684 --> 00:01:02.729 position:50% align:center
So, I've got an idea for
the Summer Troupe's huddle.

00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:05.482 position:50% align:center
Our what? Just what're you...?

00:01:05.523 --> 00:01:08.526 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
Guys, gather round Tenten!

00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:14.324 position:50% align:center
What the heck is this?

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:17.744 position:50% align:center
We're wishing you a successful
performance. All of us!

00:01:17.786 --> 00:01:18.578 position:50% align:center
No thanks.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.580 position:50% align:center
Come on, Yuki, how about
just this one time?

00:01:20.622 --> 00:01:22.999 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI]
Yeah, bring it in!

00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:24.376 position:50% align:center
[YUKI grunts]

00:01:27.379 --> 00:01:30.840 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
Ready, go. Summer Troupe, fight!

00:01:30.882 --> 00:01:34.219 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Yeah!

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.471 position:50% align:center
I think that was my
first huddle ever.

00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:38.223 position:50% align:center
And how'd it feel?

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:39.849 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Embarrassing.

00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:40.975 position:50% align:center
Aw...

00:01:41.017 --> 00:01:42.477 position:50% align:center
You see? Told ya.

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:45.313 position:50% align:center
Awkward. But not bad.

00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:48.608 position:50% align:center
And I forgot my stage fright.
For a split second.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.235 position:50% align:center
Tenma's wearing his game face!

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:52.445 position:50% align:center
Trust us!
You'll do great onstage!

00:01:52.487 --> 00:01:56.116 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I hope, for our sakes.

00:01:56.157 --> 00:01:59.035 position:50% align:center
Everyone! It's five
minutes to curtain!

00:01:59.077 --> 00:02:02.622 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Hmph. This is it.

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:06.918 position:50% align:center
Show time.

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:09.004 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE chatters]

00:02:09.045 --> 00:02:12.424 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE] Hello and welcome
to the Mankai Theater.

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:14.426 position:50% align:center
This evening's production
is a new play

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:16.177 position:50% align:center
starring the Summer Troupe.

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:19.723 position:50% align:center
You'll be swept away
by <i>Water Me!</i>

00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:23.226 position:50% align:center
Thank you for attending,
and please enjoy the show!

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:26.896 position:50% align:center
[buzzing]

00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:37.907 position:50% align:center
[TENMA gasping]

00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:43.788 position:50% align:center
[TENMA gasps]

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:47.375 position:50% align:center
Knock 'em dead, you hack.

00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:55.425 position:50% align:center
[inhales, exhales]

00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:59.304 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Tonight, I have
another tale to share.

00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:04.309 position:50% align:center
One of many. Which will
capture your imagination.

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:05.852 position:50% align:center
This is Ali Baba.

00:03:05.894 --> 00:03:08.521 position:50% align:center
A poor, hardworking
young man who dreams

00:03:08.563 --> 00:03:11.274 position:50% align:center
of one day becoming rich.
And my name is--

00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:14.152 position:50% align:center
[TENMA] Scheherazade!
I'm tired of asking!

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:16.946 position:50% align:center
Where is the legendary
paradise Oasis?

00:03:16.988 --> 00:03:21.201 position:50% align:center
First, I'll spin another tale.
Long ago, in a faraway land. A--

00:03:21.242 --> 00:03:23.578 position:50% align:center
Cut to the chase and say
the three things!

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.331 position:50% align:center
Fine. Aladdin.
Magic lamp. Magician.

00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:28.541 position:50% align:center
Great. Be right back!

00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:31.544 position:50% align:center
Their rhythm and pacing
are way better.

00:03:31.586 --> 00:03:34.339 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Be careful,
Ali Baba! Stay smart.

00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:36.633 position:50% align:center
Listening to others has always
been your biggest flaw,

00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:38.760 position:50% align:center
but for once in your life,
give it a try.

00:03:38.802 --> 00:03:40.387 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI]
Tenma's rockin' it!

00:03:40.428 --> 00:03:42.138 position:50% align:center
And Yukki's in the zone, too!

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.307 position:50% align:center
I've set the pace,
so be sure you maintain it.

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:45.392 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
You got it!

00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:48.186 position:50% align:center
Hello, there!
You're a real cutie-pie.

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:50.855 position:50% align:center
Hey. You're not
bad lookin', either!

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:53.400 position:50% align:center
Wanna hang with the one
and only Aladdin?

00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:56.820 position:50% align:center
[TENMA] Wait!
Did you say you're Aladdin?

00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:59.280 position:50% align:center
You're talking to
the legend himself!

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:01.282 position:50% align:center
Then hand over the magic lamp!

00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:02.534 position:50% align:center
Magic lamp? You know what?

00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:04.452 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
Well, are you impressed?

00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:06.996 position:50% align:center
I'm performing exactly how
you taught me, Tenma!

00:04:07.038 --> 00:04:09.666 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE laughs]

00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:10.667 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI]
Listen to them!

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.669 position:50% align:center
If the audience loves this,
wait till they see

00:04:12.711 --> 00:04:15.130 position:50% align:center
what Kazunari and I planned!

00:04:15.171 --> 00:04:18.258 position:50% align:center
Now. It's my turn!

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.385 position:50% align:center
Come out, genie!

00:04:20.427 --> 00:04:23.888 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI grunting]

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.265 position:50% align:center
I'm the genie.

00:04:25.306 --> 00:04:27.517 position:50% align:center
And I shall grant you
three wishes.

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:30.103 position:50% align:center
Well? What is it that you
desire from me?

00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:32.397 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Yeowch! My butt's on fire!

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:33.523 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE laughs]

00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:35.150 position:50% align:center
Kinda obvious, isn't it?

00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:38.403 position:50% align:center
Could you do something about
the magician and the serpent?

00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:40.655 position:50% align:center
That's the magician
and the serpent, eh?

00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:42.323 position:50% align:center
So, just to be clear.

00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:44.659 position:50% align:center
Dealing with both will
use up two wishes.

00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:45.785 position:50% align:center
Is that what you want?

00:04:45.827 --> 00:04:46.870 position:50% align:center
[TENMA screams]

00:04:46.911 --> 00:04:49.080 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI] Yes! I don't care!
Just make them go away!

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:51.166 position:50% align:center
Very well then!

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.379 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
Where are you...?

00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:59.341 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI laughs]

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:00.633 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE gasps]

00:05:00.675 --> 00:05:03.595 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE gasping]

00:05:05.597 --> 00:05:08.058 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI] Sumi! Everyone's
eyes are glued on you!

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:11.478 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI] This is all because
you wanted more action!

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:14.105 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI laughing]

00:05:14.606 --> 00:05:16.483 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laugh]

00:05:16.524 --> 00:05:20.820 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI, MISUMI] The theater.
There's nothing else like it!

00:05:22.238 --> 00:05:24.991 position:50% align:center
All right, what will be
your final wish?

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:26.701 position:50% align:center
Ask about the Oasis!

00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:27.911 position:50% align:center
--Let me see...
--Say Oasis!

00:05:27.952 --> 00:05:30.580 position:50% align:center
I wanna go on a date with
a cute girl I met in town!

00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:32.916 position:50% align:center
--What?
--And so it shall be.

00:05:32.957 --> 00:05:36.419 position:50% align:center
Your three wishes have
been granted. Farewell!

00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:40.840 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Don't go! Come back here! Hey!

00:05:40.882 --> 00:05:43.885 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] You said
you want to become a prince.

00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:48.264 position:50% align:center
That's your new dream.
Step out and show them, Muku.

00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:49.766 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:54.145 position:50% align:center
[MUKU] You have the wrong
person. I'm no sailor.

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:55.355 position:50% align:center
You'll do just fine!

00:05:55.397 --> 00:05:58.149 position:50% align:center
Come! You're gonna show me
this Oasis. Now!

00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:00.610 position:50% align:center
Hold on. Know where it is?

00:06:00.652 --> 00:06:03.113 position:50% align:center
Wait, you're telling me
that you don't know?

00:06:03.154 --> 00:06:05.073 position:50% align:center
Why would you assume I did?

00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:09.119 position:50% align:center
[TENMA] You're Sinbad!
You're supposed to be the--

00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:14.082 position:50% align:center
He forgot his line!

00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:16.126 position:50% align:center
Not good!

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:21.798 position:50% align:center
This gold you seek.
I can't help you--

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.342 position:50% align:center
Oh, Ali Baba. Do grow up.

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:28.013 position:50% align:center
There isn't a
legendary paradise.

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:31.349 position:50% align:center
No. Not listening to you!
Not listening to you!

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:32.600 position:50% align:center
Muku nailed it!

00:06:32.642 --> 00:06:34.686 position:50% align:center
Nice recovery, Tenten!

00:06:34.728 --> 00:06:36.855 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
You really saved me back there.

00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:41.109 position:50% align:center
I was just about to flush all
our hard work down the drain.

00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:42.944 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
Don't worry about it, Tenma!

00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:44.529 position:50% align:center
You're never alone.

00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:45.947 position:50% align:center
All your friends in
the Summer Troupe

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:48.867 position:50% align:center
are sharing the stage with you!

00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:52.579 position:50% align:center
Good lord, our leader
sure is a handful.

00:06:54.622 --> 00:06:57.625 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Upon discovering that
the Oasis doesn't exist,

00:06:57.667 --> 00:07:00.211 position:50% align:center
Ali Baba questions
Scheherazade.

00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:03.381 position:50% align:center
She reveals her scheme:
to avoid the king's proposal,

00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:05.592 position:50% align:center
she lied and said
she'd only marry

00:07:05.633 --> 00:07:07.969 position:50% align:center
he who discovered the paradise.

00:07:08.011 --> 00:07:09.971 position:50% align:center
I've delayed things
as long as I could,

00:07:10.013 --> 00:07:12.057 position:50% align:center
but now my hands are tied.

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:14.517 position:50% align:center
Alas, I must join
the king's harem.

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:16.603 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me that's
what you really want!

00:07:16.644 --> 00:07:18.813 position:50% align:center
Of course not, but what
does that matter?

00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:23.026 position:50% align:center
Tell me. I'm nothing but just
someone else's plaything.

00:07:23.068 --> 00:07:25.070 position:50% align:center
Why did you wait
so long to tell me?

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:27.155 position:50% align:center
We should've just talked,
but you made up some cockama--

00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:29.532 position:50% align:center
Would things have turned
out differently?

00:07:29.574 --> 00:07:32.619 position:50% align:center
I dunno.
Maybe they would have.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.496 position:50% align:center
Forget about me, okay?

00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:37.290 position:50% align:center
We both know you
only care about riches.

00:07:37.332 --> 00:07:40.877 position:50% align:center
So go ask your genie to
make you a wealthy man.

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:43.338 position:50% align:center
How could you say
something so stupid?

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.589 position:50% align:center
If that's how you're gonna act,

00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:47.384 position:50% align:center
then I really am done with you
for good! You hear me?

00:07:47.425 --> 00:07:50.220 position:50% align:center
Ugh! And your mother's
a poopy head!

00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:51.054 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE laughs]

00:07:51.096 --> 00:07:54.432 position:50% align:center
You never were what I'd
call the mature type.

00:07:57.852 --> 00:07:59.688 position:50% align:center
I'm confused.

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:02.399 position:50% align:center
How come she just
didn't tell me the truth?

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.401 position:50% align:center
Scheherazade...

00:08:04.442 --> 00:08:06.152 position:50% align:center
After she's joined
the king's harem,

00:08:06.194 --> 00:08:08.196 position:50% align:center
I won't see her again.

00:08:08.238 --> 00:08:11.616 position:50% align:center
So, that's that. Our story ends.

00:08:16.788 --> 00:08:18.957 position:50% align:center
Fool! What're you doing back?

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:21.793 position:50% align:center
Do you think I have any idea?

00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:31.511 position:50% align:center
Well, my Master. I believe
you have one wish left.

00:08:31.553 --> 00:08:34.180 position:50% align:center
For my final wish...

00:08:41.146 --> 00:08:43.189 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
I see.

00:08:43.231 --> 00:08:46.443 position:50% align:center
So, this is what it feels like.

00:08:46.484 --> 00:08:51.281 position:50% align:center
I finally understand what the
director was talking about.

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:54.284 position:50% align:center
For my final wish,

00:08:54.325 --> 00:08:56.661 position:50% align:center
I want Scheherazade
to not marry the king!

00:08:56.703 --> 00:08:57.787 position:50% align:center
What?

00:08:57.829 --> 00:09:01.750 position:50% align:center
Consider it done!
You two are lawfully wed.

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:04.127 position:50% align:center
Wait, Ali Baba
and I are married?

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:05.754 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing that
means you can't join

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:07.547 position:50% align:center
the king's harem anymore.

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:11.384 position:50% align:center
Perhaps the two of you will
live happily ever after!

00:09:13.345 --> 00:09:15.263 position:50% align:center
You idiot!

00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:17.557 position:50% align:center
You used up all
the genie's wishes?

00:09:17.599 --> 00:09:20.727 position:50% align:center
I thought your dream
was to strike it rich!

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:23.271 position:50% align:center
Even if I were a wealthy man,

00:09:23.313 --> 00:09:25.857 position:50% align:center
I could never sleep
soundly at night

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:27.692 position:50% align:center
without hearing your stories.

00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:29.152 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:31.363 --> 00:09:32.822 position:50% align:center
Ali Baba.

00:09:32.864 --> 00:09:34.366 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
What is it?

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:38.411 position:50% align:center
I'm feeling quite parched.
Draw me some water, darling.

00:09:38.453 --> 00:09:40.497 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Huh? Why should I?

00:09:40.538 --> 00:09:43.625 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Tonight, I have another
tale to share with you.

00:09:43.667 --> 00:09:46.836 position:50% align:center
A story featuring a three-year-
old Ali Baba wetting the bed.

00:09:46.878 --> 00:09:48.421 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Wait! Anything but that!

00:09:48.463 --> 00:09:49.589 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE laughing]

00:09:49.631 --> 00:09:50.965 position:50% align:center
You have ten seconds.

00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:53.718 position:50% align:center
Fine, I'll get your
damn water, jeez!

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.221 position:50% align:center
Maybe I rushed into this.

00:09:58.139 --> 00:10:04.145 position:50% align:center
[applause]

00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:05.271 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
We did it!

00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:06.856 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
Listen to the applause!

00:10:06.898 --> 00:10:09.025 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI]
And not just ours!

00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:10.652 position:50% align:center
We're done? Wow.

00:10:10.694 --> 00:10:13.238 position:50% align:center
You bet we are!
That was awesome!

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:15.615 position:50% align:center
My adrenaline's
through the roof!

00:10:15.657 --> 00:10:17.951 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] It'll make sense
once you're onstage.

00:10:17.992 --> 00:10:18.785 position:50% align:center
[GROUP laughs]

00:10:18.827 --> 00:10:21.538 position:50% align:center
[TENMA] No two performances
are ever the same.

00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:23.123 position:50% align:center
The audience comes to see a show

00:10:23.164 --> 00:10:24.958 position:50% align:center
that'll never happen
the exact same way twice.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.794 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Hey, Tenma!
It's time for curtain call!

00:10:27.836 --> 00:10:30.338 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Huh? Oh, right.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.048 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheering]

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:33.550 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Thank you so much!

00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:35.218 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
You were a wonderful crowd!

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.219 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Many thanks!

00:10:36.261 --> 00:10:37.387 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
We appreciate it!

00:10:37.429 --> 00:10:39.264 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI]
Thank you!

00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:52.652 position:50% align:center
[applause continues]

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:08.084 position:50% align:center
[gasps] You guys!
Great work tonight!

00:11:08.126 --> 00:11:10.003 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Director.

00:11:10.045 --> 00:11:11.087 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Huh?

00:11:11.129 --> 00:11:12.797 position:50% align:center
[MUKU] We've successfully
redeemed ourselves

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:14.174 position:50% align:center
from the dress rehearsal.

00:11:14.215 --> 00:11:17.385 position:50% align:center
Almost had a repeat
is more like it.

00:11:17.427 --> 00:11:20.972 position:50% align:center
At first. But in the end,
everything worked out. We ruled!

00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:24.559 position:50% align:center
Muku. You saved me,
thanks a lot.

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:26.394 position:50% align:center
Tenma.

00:11:26.436 --> 00:11:28.646 position:50% align:center
I'm, uh... I'm sorry.

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:30.857 position:50% align:center
About all the harsh things
I said way back when.

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:32.984 position:50% align:center
It's fine. The funny thing is,

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:35.070 position:50% align:center
that's what made me
a better actor.

00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:36.488 position:50% align:center
I was confident out there

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:38.823 position:50% align:center
because of the lessons
you taught all of us.

00:11:38.865 --> 00:11:42.202 position:50% align:center
I'm the one who should
be thanking you.

00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:43.912 position:50% align:center
You still have a lot to learn.

00:11:43.953 --> 00:11:45.914 position:50% align:center
You just can't ditch
that arrogance, huh?

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:47.999 position:50% align:center
It's true he helped me
out on the stage.

00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:49.417 position:50% align:center
But I'm a professional actor

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:51.294 position:50% align:center
with tons more
experience to my name.

00:11:51.336 --> 00:11:52.671 position:50% align:center
Yeah, whatever.

00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:54.130 position:50% align:center
Hey, watch that attitude!

00:11:54.172 --> 00:11:56.591 position:50% align:center
Now it feels like things
are normal again.

00:11:56.633 --> 00:11:58.426 position:50% align:center
All right, Tenma is back!

00:11:58.468 --> 00:12:01.179 position:50% align:center
Ha! You know the only
reason we pulled this off

00:12:01.221 --> 00:12:03.223 position:50% align:center
was thanks to the huddle
I came up with.

00:12:03.264 --> 00:12:05.225 position:50% align:center
Crap, are we gonna
keep doing that?

00:12:05.266 --> 00:12:07.602 position:50% align:center
Yeah, why not? We could
use the good luck!

00:12:07.644 --> 00:12:08.853 position:50% align:center
[TENMA, YUKI]
Embarrassing.

00:12:08.895 --> 00:12:10.188 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
What?

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.232 position:50% align:center
Hey, guys. Stay excited!

00:12:12.273 --> 00:12:14.275 position:50% align:center
All the way through
closing night, okay?

00:12:14.317 --> 00:12:17.070 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Yeah!

00:12:17.112 --> 00:12:20.073 position:50% align:center
Better keep it together, hack.
Think you can do that?

00:12:20.115 --> 00:12:24.035 position:50% align:center
[TENMA] Heh. Trust me,
no reminder needed.

00:12:32.293 --> 00:12:33.753 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
Yep, you're in the right place.

00:12:33.795 --> 00:12:37.507 position:50% align:center
Welcome! And thanks
very much for coming today!

00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:49.978 position:50% align:center
S'cuse me, you guys.

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:51.563 position:50% align:center
Tenma's manager?

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:53.440 position:50% align:center
Tenma, it's bad news.

00:12:53.481 --> 00:12:55.483 position:50% align:center
Your parents are in
the audience tonight.

00:12:55.525 --> 00:12:58.528 position:50% align:center
What? Shouldn't they both
be overseas right now?

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:01.406 position:50% align:center
[IGAWA] Well, they said they
made time between shoots

00:13:01.448 --> 00:13:02.991 position:50% align:center
to see your last performance!

00:13:03.033 --> 00:13:06.119 position:50% align:center
Tenten's parents are here
to watch? That's terrifying!

00:13:06.161 --> 00:13:07.954 position:50% align:center
This is seriously weird.

00:13:07.996 --> 00:13:09.914 position:50% align:center
Not really, I actually sent them

00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:11.875 position:50% align:center
two tickets through
their agency.

00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:12.876 position:50% align:center
You didn't.

00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:14.210 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I sure did.

00:13:14.252 --> 00:13:16.963 position:50% align:center
Go out and use your performance
to prove to your parents

00:13:17.005 --> 00:13:20.967 position:50% align:center
that this play is a major step
in your career as an actor!

00:13:21.009 --> 00:13:22.469 position:50% align:center
Tenma.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.471 position:50% align:center
Guess you're not a
hack anymore, are ya?

00:13:24.512 --> 00:13:27.432 position:50% align:center
Would you stop?
I was never a hack.

00:13:27.474 --> 00:13:30.018 position:50% align:center
Okay. I'll make them see
that turning down

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.936 position:50% align:center
the movie offer was
the right choice.

00:13:31.978 --> 00:13:34.147 position:50% align:center
And then they'll understand.

00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:45.867 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Looks like the whole
track team's here.

00:13:45.909 --> 00:13:46.993 position:50% align:center
What do I do?

00:13:47.035 --> 00:13:48.453 position:50% align:center
What's the problem?

00:13:48.495 --> 00:13:50.288 position:50% align:center
You're the one who
invited them, aren't you?

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.082 position:50% align:center
Well. Yeah, I guess I did.

00:13:52.123 --> 00:13:56.086 position:50% align:center
But now that I see them,
I'm so nervous I could just die.

00:13:56.127 --> 00:13:57.504 position:50% align:center
[YUKI gasps]

00:13:57.545 --> 00:13:59.005 position:50% align:center
What's the matter?

00:13:59.047 --> 00:14:00.465 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Nothing.

00:14:01.508 --> 00:14:04.803 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
Oh, those guys are here.

00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:08.390 position:50% align:center
I honestly never thought
they'd come see this.

00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:12.644 position:50% align:center
Wait, my triangle.
Did I lose it?

00:14:12.686 --> 00:14:15.271 position:50% align:center
Hold up. Your triangle
ruler is missing?

00:14:15.313 --> 00:14:20.402 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I saw it this morning,
but now it's vanished. So sad.

00:14:20.443 --> 00:14:24.030 position:50% align:center
Man! Now you guys have
gotten me totally nervous, too!

00:14:24.072 --> 00:14:24.864 position:50% align:center
[door creaks]

00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:25.907 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:26.908 position:50% align:center
Hey, everyone!

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:28.243 position:50% align:center
Sup.

00:14:28.284 --> 00:14:29.911 position:50% align:center
Break an arm, guys!

00:14:29.953 --> 00:14:32.288 position:50% align:center
The word you're
looking for is "leg."

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:33.790 position:50% align:center
You're here! What's up?

00:14:33.832 --> 00:14:35.208 position:50% align:center
Moral support.

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:36.668 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA] We thought everyone
might be nervous

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:39.045 position:50% align:center
since it's closing night.

00:14:39.087 --> 00:14:41.715 position:50% align:center
Look. You're all winners
as long as you have fun.

00:14:41.756 --> 00:14:43.466 position:50% align:center
We were failures.

00:14:43.508 --> 00:14:47.762 position:50% align:center
Um, is it possible you're
talking about me?

00:14:47.804 --> 00:14:49.764 position:50% align:center
I found this earlier today!

00:14:49.806 --> 00:14:53.268 position:50% align:center
Ah! Thank you!
Grandpa's triangle!

00:14:53.309 --> 00:14:54.644 position:50% align:center
Aw, Sumi, that's awesome!

00:14:54.686 --> 00:14:56.896 position:50% align:center
Yay! Nibbling the
thanks in the butt!

00:14:56.938 --> 00:14:59.482 position:50% align:center
Dude, that's the worst one yet.

00:14:59.524 --> 00:15:02.485 position:50% align:center
A simple lot with heads
full of fluff, as usual.

00:15:02.527 --> 00:15:05.947 position:50% align:center
[laughs] I'm still
thankful, though.

00:15:05.989 --> 00:15:07.699 position:50% align:center
I am, too.

00:15:07.741 --> 00:15:10.660 position:50% align:center
Tenma. How ya feeling?

00:15:10.702 --> 00:15:13.663 position:50% align:center
It's a big responsibility.

00:15:13.705 --> 00:15:15.582 position:50% align:center
Being the lead, I mean.

00:15:15.623 --> 00:15:17.751 position:50% align:center
I have the upmost
respect for you.

00:15:17.792 --> 00:15:19.419 position:50% align:center
What? Me?

00:15:19.461 --> 00:15:22.255 position:50% align:center
[TENMA] So, were you scared
on closing night, too?

00:15:22.297 --> 00:15:27.010 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I was. To be honest,
I was terrified.

00:15:27.052 --> 00:15:30.347 position:50% align:center
A mess, but...

00:15:30.388 --> 00:15:33.558 position:50% align:center
I was as excited
as I was scared!

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.061 position:50% align:center
Same here, I get it.

00:15:36.102 --> 00:15:38.063 position:50% align:center
I never had a single
doubt that you'd be able

00:15:38.104 --> 00:15:40.357 position:50% align:center
to make this show happen, Tenma.

00:15:40.398 --> 00:15:42.567 position:50% align:center
And I bet tonight's show
will be the best one yet.

00:15:42.609 --> 00:15:44.444 position:50% align:center
Yep. Of course!

00:15:44.486 --> 00:15:48.198 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA laughs] You got this!
The show must go on, right?

00:15:48.239 --> 00:15:50.700 position:50% align:center
Break a leg tonight.
I know you will!

00:15:50.742 --> 00:15:53.953 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Yes, I think we can do it!

00:15:57.248 --> 00:16:01.252 position:50% align:center
Look alive, just a few
minutes till curtain!

00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:02.962 position:50% align:center
--[TENMA] Yuki.
--[YUKI] What?

00:16:03.004 --> 00:16:04.923 position:50% align:center
--[TENMA] Muku.
--[MUKU] Huh?

00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:06.049 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Kazunari.

00:16:06.091 --> 00:16:07.634 position:50% align:center
Yeah, what's up?

00:16:07.676 --> 00:16:08.551 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Misumi.

00:16:08.593 --> 00:16:10.220 position:50% align:center
Uh, what?

00:16:11.888 --> 00:16:14.933 position:50% align:center
You should know,
I'm glad to be here with you.

00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:15.975 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:18.395 position:50% align:center
[TENMA] You guys are each
really important to me.

00:16:18.436 --> 00:16:22.232 position:50% align:center
I consider you
to be my true comrades.

00:16:22.273 --> 00:16:24.609 position:50% align:center
Kazunari. When you said
we were friends,

00:16:24.651 --> 00:16:26.861 position:50% align:center
I might've been
super-embarrassed,

00:16:26.903 --> 00:16:29.823 position:50% align:center
but at the same time,
I was really happy.

00:16:29.864 --> 00:16:31.491 position:50% align:center
Aw, Tenten.

00:16:31.533 --> 00:16:32.784 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
I apologize for saying

00:16:32.826 --> 00:16:34.828 position:50% align:center
that you were
shallow during camp.

00:16:34.869 --> 00:16:37.288 position:50% align:center
No probs! Don't sweat it!

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:41.251 position:50% align:center
Okay. Let's go make
this show the best!

00:16:41.292 --> 00:16:44.170 position:50% align:center
Or the best performance
that we can give now,

00:16:44.212 --> 00:16:46.798 position:50% align:center
at this very moment.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.883 position:50% align:center
You'll follow my lead?

00:16:48.925 --> 00:16:50.260 position:50% align:center
But of course.

00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:51.761 position:50% align:center
You know we will!

00:16:51.803 --> 00:16:54.139 position:50% align:center
Let's bring the
whole house down!

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:57.183 position:50% align:center
I'm proud to keep up with you!

00:16:57.225 --> 00:16:59.185 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:17:00.562 --> 00:17:02.188 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Summer Troupe, fight!

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:04.149 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Yeah!

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.609 position:50% align:center
[buzzing]

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:16.953 position:50% align:center
Allow me to capture
your imagination.

00:17:16.995 --> 00:17:23.293 position:50% align:center
I have a tale. One of
a thousand, all unique.

00:17:23.335 --> 00:17:25.920 position:50% align:center
Hey, why're you spacing out,
Scheherazade?

00:17:25.962 --> 00:17:27.922 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
What? An ad-lib?

00:17:27.964 --> 00:17:29.674 position:50% align:center
That kid.

00:17:29.716 --> 00:17:32.177 position:50% align:center
Hello? Hack?
Are you even listening?

00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:34.721 position:50% align:center
Excuse me? You're the hack,
you broke pauper!

00:17:34.763 --> 00:17:35.680 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE laughs]

00:17:35.722 --> 00:17:37.682 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
You followed my lead.

00:17:37.724 --> 00:17:38.641 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Well, duh.

00:17:38.683 --> 00:17:40.226 position:50% align:center
Do you realize how
many times I've had

00:17:40.268 --> 00:17:43.146 position:50% align:center
to try and keep up with
Mr. Arrogant since day one?

00:17:43.188 --> 00:17:46.566 position:50% align:center
Hint: it's a lot.

00:17:46.608 --> 00:17:50.195 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI] Man, Tenten!
You're ad-libbing like crazy!

00:17:50.236 --> 00:17:51.988 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Should I maybe tone it down?

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:53.573 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
Nah, don't change a thing!

00:17:53.615 --> 00:17:58.203 position:50% align:center
This is actually hella fun!
I see no reason to stop now!

00:17:58.244 --> 00:18:01.164 position:50% align:center
[MUKU] I never could've imagined
that I'd end up here.

00:18:01.206 --> 00:18:03.708 position:50% align:center
Performing on a
huge stage like this,

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:06.878 position:50% align:center
in front of a big,
excited audience.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:10.674 position:50% align:center
I'm glad I mustered up my
courage to start acting.

00:18:10.715 --> 00:18:13.468 position:50% align:center
[TENMA] You know, your courage
is what saved me.

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:15.720 position:50% align:center
You guys taught me that
there's no need to be afraid

00:18:15.762 --> 00:18:18.932 position:50% align:center
of expressing myself on stage.

00:18:18.973 --> 00:18:20.767 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI]
Hup!

00:18:20.809 --> 00:18:24.062 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI]
Grandpa, I wonder...

00:18:24.104 --> 00:18:28.775 position:50% align:center
If he was alive, would my
performance make him happy?

00:18:28.817 --> 00:18:32.028 position:50% align:center
[TENMA] I'm sure he would've
loved it. He'd be proud.

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:34.614 position:50% align:center
Look at the huge grins
on everyone's faces,

00:18:34.656 --> 00:18:36.991 position:50% align:center
including yours!

00:18:41.871 --> 00:18:44.958 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] So. Tonight,
I have another tale to share.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.460 position:50% align:center
It's a tale of a three-year-old
Ali Baba wetting the bed.

00:18:47.502 --> 00:18:49.087 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
What? No!

00:18:49.129 --> 00:18:50.547 position:50% align:center
Ten seconds, then.

00:18:50.588 --> 00:18:53.049 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
I'll get your damn water, jeez!

00:18:53.091 --> 00:18:56.344 position:50% align:center
Maybe I rushed into this.

00:18:56.386 --> 00:18:59.055 position:50% align:center
Seriously, thank you.

00:18:59.097 --> 00:19:01.725 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:19:01.766 --> 00:19:05.854 position:50% align:center
[AUDIENCE cheers]

00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:13.153 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN A] Is it me, or was that
last line totally moving?

00:19:13.194 --> 00:19:16.614 position:50% align:center
[WOMAN B] It really was!
I'm in tears, here.

00:19:20.452 --> 00:19:22.912 position:50% align:center
[cheering continues]

00:19:26.124 --> 00:19:27.000 position:50% align:center
[GROUP laughs]

00:19:27.042 --> 00:19:29.336 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI] Whoa, I've got
goosebumps! Holy crap!

00:19:29.377 --> 00:19:31.713 position:50% align:center
They're giving us
a standing ovation tonight!

00:19:31.755 --> 00:19:34.174 position:50% align:center
It's making me feel all
kinds of things, you know?

00:19:34.215 --> 00:19:36.551 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI] Man, Tenten,
you went nuts with adlibs!

00:19:36.593 --> 00:19:38.928 position:50% align:center
I did ask if you could
follow my lead.

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:42.849 position:50% align:center
This has been so much fun!
Theater is the best, isn't it?

00:19:42.891 --> 00:19:44.184 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
Ya got that right!

00:19:44.225 --> 00:19:46.269 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
Absolutely!

00:19:47.437 --> 00:19:49.647 position:50% align:center
Hey, Yuki. Thanks.

00:19:49.689 --> 00:19:50.607 position:50% align:center
Gross.

00:19:50.648 --> 00:19:51.941 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Could you not?

00:19:51.983 --> 00:19:53.860 position:50% align:center
[GROUP laughs]

00:19:57.447 --> 00:19:59.366 position:50% align:center
Good job tonight, guys.

00:19:59.407 --> 00:20:00.408 position:50% align:center
Same to you.

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:01.659 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much, everyone!

00:20:01.701 --> 00:20:03.370 position:50% align:center
The applause was amazing.

00:20:03.411 --> 00:20:05.163 position:50% align:center
It showed no signs
of letting up!

00:20:05.205 --> 00:20:08.541 position:50% align:center
It kinda made me want
to stay on stage forever!

00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:09.834 position:50% align:center
[IGAWA]
Tenma.

00:20:15.507 --> 00:20:17.676 position:50% align:center
[IGAWA]
Just so you know, your parents

00:20:17.717 --> 00:20:21.137 position:50% align:center
unfortunately had to leave
to catch their flight.

00:20:21.179 --> 00:20:22.639 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
I see.

00:20:22.681 --> 00:20:25.308 position:50% align:center
[IGAWA] But they did
leave this note for you.

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:27.477 position:50% align:center
"We won't nag you anymore.

00:20:27.519 --> 00:20:29.646 position:50% align:center
You can do as you see fit.

00:20:29.688 --> 00:20:33.483 position:50% align:center
We hope you'll try
and surpass us."

00:20:33.525 --> 00:20:35.568 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Dad.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:39.656 position:50% align:center
[IGAWA] Also, they said that
you should call more often.

00:20:41.616 --> 00:20:43.493 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Got it.

00:20:48.665 --> 00:20:50.125 position:50% align:center
[door creaks]

00:20:50.166 --> 00:20:53.211 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, Sakyo! Did you
come hoping to watch?

00:20:53.253 --> 00:20:55.714 position:50% align:center
No, thanks. Are you here
to pay off your debt?

00:20:55.755 --> 00:20:57.757 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Uh, no.

00:20:57.799 --> 00:21:00.719 position:50% align:center
I just came to pick these up.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.595 position:50% align:center
I was doubtful after
reading the reviews

00:21:02.637 --> 00:21:03.930 position:50% align:center
of your dress rehearsal.

00:21:03.972 --> 00:21:05.515 position:50% align:center
But it looks like
you pulled it off.

00:21:05.557 --> 00:21:08.893 position:50% align:center
However, if you relax
for even a second,

00:21:08.935 --> 00:21:10.937 position:50% align:center
you'll lose your audience.

00:21:10.979 --> 00:21:12.647 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:12.689 --> 00:21:14.607 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:21:14.649 --> 00:21:17.235 position:50% align:center
Please, take one with you!

00:21:17.277 --> 00:21:18.987 position:50% align:center
What're you up to?

00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:21.072 position:50% align:center
I've wondered this for a while.

00:21:21.114 --> 00:21:24.034 position:50% align:center
I think you love this
theatre as much as I do,

00:21:24.075 --> 00:21:25.785 position:50% align:center
so don't pretend that you don't.

00:21:25.827 --> 00:21:27.912 position:50% align:center
I know you'll make
the effort to be here.

00:21:27.954 --> 00:21:29.914 position:50% align:center
See ya soon!

00:21:29.956 --> 00:21:31.082 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI exhales]

00:21:37.172 --> 00:21:40.759 position:50% align:center
[FURUICHI] Now she's starting
to act like a decent director.

00:23:21.109 --> 00:23:22.902 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Yo!

00:23:22.944 --> 00:23:23.778 position:50% align:center
[JYUZA grunts]

00:23:27.866 --> 00:23:29.576 position:50% align:center
[BANRI]
Hmph.

00:23:29.617 --> 00:23:32.454 position:50% align:center
Well? What's your problem?

00:23:32.495 --> 00:23:36.374 position:50% align:center
I'm Banri Settsu.
Undefeated, as yet.

00:23:36.416 --> 00:23:40.295 position:50% align:center
Just like you, from what I hear!

00:23:40.337 --> 00:23:44.424 position:50% align:center
So! Anyway, friend.
Are you ready?

00:23:44.466 --> 00:23:46.926 position:50% align:center
Cause I'm gonna beat your ass!
