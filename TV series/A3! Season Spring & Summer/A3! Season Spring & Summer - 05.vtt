What's the rush, Masumi?

You didn't even give me
enough time

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:15.724 position:50% align:center
to change clothes
or wash my face.

Sorry, that was my fault. Huh?

We'll try going at a
more comfortable speed.

Who would've thought?

Guess things have
changed between them.

Don't mention it.

holding the rest of us back.

[IZUMI] At this rate,
he'll be ready in time

That doesn't mean you should
get overzealous and burn out.

How about it? Are you free to
keep giving him these lessons?

Why didn't you tell us
the company had a site?

So lame.

It'd be a punishable

could use a lot of work, too.

So, um. I kinda know
a graphic designer

Really?

He was a year ahead
of me in high school.

But I guess it
wouldn't hurt to ask.

You sound kind of hesitant.

to you this morning.

Let's kick him out.

reached out to Miyoshi.

forsake my family.

try delivering it

from a slightly different angle?

Imagine you're talking
about your own family.

That'll be a stretch.

they would say the line.

00:07:43.838 --> 00:07:46.800 position:50% align:center
Then try delivering it
in a similar way.

00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:49.094 position:50% align:center
Got it.

I can't forsake my family!

00:07:56.851 --> 00:08:00.355 position:50% align:center
Better! There was a huge
difference with your intonation.

00:08:00.397 --> 00:08:02.232 position:50% align:center
If you can channel
the same emotions

00:08:02.273 --> 00:08:05.485 position:50% align:center
your character's feeling, you'll
nail that part every time.

00:08:05.527 --> 00:08:07.320 position:50% align:center
Keep working on it.

00:08:07.362 --> 00:08:09.364 position:50% align:center
Then, I'm not selling
the performance yet.

00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:11.366 position:50% align:center
It's getting there,
and with a little practice,

00:08:11.408 --> 00:08:13.118 position:50% align:center
you'll sell the part.

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:16.454 position:50% align:center

so much faith in me.

the show's coming
together more and more!

00:08:50.864 --> 00:08:52.157 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI grunts]

00:08:52.198 --> 00:08:55.160 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] So, how many people
are going to see my costumes?

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:56.911 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:08:56.953 --> 00:08:58.246 position:50% align:center
Four tickets?

00:08:58.288 --> 00:09:01.499 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE]
Me, Tetsuro, Yuzo, Kamekichi.

00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:03.418 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU]
Kamekichi doesn't count!

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:04.544 position:50% align:center
[ITARU]
This isn't good.

00:09:04.586 --> 00:09:07.297 position:50% align:center
Our debut will also be
our final performance!

00:09:07.339 --> 00:09:09.549 position:50% align:center
If we want people to know
about Mankai Company,

00:09:09.591 --> 00:09:13.303 position:50% align:center
we've gotta get the word out!
Advertise to a wider audience!

00:09:13.345 --> 00:09:16.014 position:50% align:center
[sighs] So, it's come to this.

00:09:17.849 --> 00:09:20.185 position:50% align:center
I can make a social media post
about the show.

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:22.812 position:50% align:center
This legend has
over 50K followers!

00:09:22.854 --> 00:09:24.314 position:50% align:center
You're famous online.

00:09:24.356 --> 00:09:25.648 position:50% align:center
Speaking of social media,

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:27.192 position:50% align:center
we should start
a blog for the troupe.

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:29.319 position:50% align:center
Keep people up to date
on what we're doing.

00:09:29.361 --> 00:09:31.571 position:50% align:center
Is that something
you could handle, Itaru?

00:09:31.613 --> 00:09:34.074 position:50% align:center
--Sure thing.
--I'll help Mister 50k.

00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:36.951 position:50% align:center
I'll reach out to Miyoshi again
and see what he can do.

00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:39.537 position:50% align:center
From what I gather,
he's pretty well-connected.

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:42.290 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
We better go hand out flyers.

00:09:42.332 --> 00:09:43.875 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA] You got it!

00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:46.836 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Though I should be
comped, I'll buy a ticket,

00:09:46.878 --> 00:09:47.712 position:50% align:center
and take some flyers.

00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:48.838 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE]
Huh?

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.799 position:50% align:center
I put blood and sweat
into these costumes

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.759 position:50% align:center
and I want them to be seen.
I'll help promote.

00:09:52.801 --> 00:09:54.844 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE]
You're an absolute angel.

00:09:54.886 --> 00:09:57.597 position:50% align:center
Fantastic! Thanks, Yuki!

00:09:59.474 --> 00:10:01.768 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA] Please come and see
<i>Romeo and Julius</i>!

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:05.105 position:50% align:center
A new play performed by the
Mankai Company's Spring Troupe!

00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:07.982 position:50% align:center
Get your tickets
before they're gone!

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:10.694 position:50% align:center
The crowd's good, but we
haven't handed out many flyers.

00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:14.030 position:50% align:center
Veludo Way is packed with
different theater companies.

00:10:14.072 --> 00:10:17.158 position:50% align:center
We need something unique
to draw people in.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:22.163 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
Hm? Hey, where are you--?

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:31.840 position:50% align:center
Romeo, you're Romeo Montague?

00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:32.924 position:50% align:center
[WOMEN gasp]

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:35.885 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI] I don't believe it.
Are you really Romeo?

00:10:35.927 --> 00:10:38.805 position:50% align:center
Born and raised in
House Montague?

00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:44.352 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Huh?

00:10:44.394 --> 00:10:47.689 position:50% align:center
And you are named Julius,
from the House of Capulet?

00:10:47.731 --> 00:10:48.690 position:50% align:center
What is this?

00:10:48.732 --> 00:10:49.941 position:50% align:center
Shakespeare, I think.

00:10:49.983 --> 00:10:51.526 position:50% align:center
[PASSERBY C]
That's <i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

00:10:51.568 --> 00:10:53.153 position:50% align:center
[PASSERBY D]
But both the actors are guys.

00:10:53.194 --> 00:10:54.571 position:50% align:center
[PASSERBY E]
What an interesting twist.

00:10:54.612 --> 00:10:57.073 position:50% align:center
The Mankai Company presents
a brand-new play!

00:10:57.115 --> 00:10:58.950 position:50% align:center
Let's check it out! C'mon!

00:10:58.992 --> 00:11:00.535 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]  Hope to see you there!
Here you go!

00:11:00.577 --> 00:11:01.369 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
Excuse me.

00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:02.370 position:50% align:center
Hi, there.

00:11:02.412 --> 00:11:03.705 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
Could I have one of those?

00:11:03.747 --> 00:11:06.291 position:50% align:center
Certainly! Here, thanks!

00:11:07.959 --> 00:11:10.628 position:50% align:center
I can't wait to see your play.

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:16.801 position:50% align:center
[TENMA] What's this? <i>Romeo
and Juliet </i>with two guys?

00:11:16.843 --> 00:11:19.596 position:50% align:center
You can't be serious.

00:11:19.637 --> 00:11:23.141 position:50% align:center
Please stop by and see our play!

00:11:23.183 --> 00:11:24.976 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Maybe I will.

00:11:25.018 --> 00:11:29.189 position:50% align:center
Romeo. Oh, why must you
be called Romeo Montague?

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:31.858 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA] Forsake your home
and name, Julius.

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:36.112 position:50% align:center
After all, don't you and I
have a grander dream to share?

00:11:36.154 --> 00:11:38.990 position:50% align:center
I cannot. I can't--

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:44.120 position:50% align:center
[STREET murmuring]

00:11:44.162 --> 00:11:44.996 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:45.038 --> 00:11:46.498 position:50% align:center
[PASSERBY F]
Wait, what happened?

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:47.582 position:50% align:center
[PASSERBY G]
That's it?

00:11:47.624 --> 00:11:49.167 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:54.631 --> 00:11:55.840 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Thanks to you two,

00:11:55.882 --> 00:11:58.551 position:50% align:center
we were able to pass out
most of our flyers!

00:11:58.593 --> 00:11:59.678 position:50% align:center
I, uh...

00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:01.680 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, the part
you forgot will be fine

00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:04.307 position:50% align:center
by the actual performance
if you just keep at it.

00:12:04.349 --> 00:12:05.642 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:05.684 --> 00:12:11.940 position:50% align:center
[CITRON]
Row-Me-Oh and Jew-Lee-Ess! Yay!

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:14.609 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh, love the typos.

00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:16.861 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU]
Hey! You guys!

00:12:16.903 --> 00:12:18.446 position:50% align:center
[CITRON]
What is it, Tsuzuru?

00:12:18.488 --> 00:12:22.659 position:50% align:center
Just take a look at this!
It's from Miyoshi.

00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:25.704 position:50% align:center
[ITARU]
TV?

00:12:28.498 --> 00:12:32.043 position:50% align:center
Hello! Today, I'm with
the Mankai Company.

00:12:32.085 --> 00:12:35.338 position:50% align:center
They're a long-established
theater troupe here in our city.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.465 position:50% align:center
I'm joined right now by
their two leads.

00:12:37.507 --> 00:12:39.342 position:50% align:center
So, let's hear from them first!

00:12:39.384 --> 00:12:42.220 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah! For sure!
Thanks, this is gonna be great!

00:12:42.262 --> 00:12:44.222 position:50% align:center
Little nervous, huh, dude?

00:12:44.264 --> 00:12:45.974 position:50% align:center
[REPORTER A] I understand
your characters' friendship

00:12:46.016 --> 00:12:47.475 position:50% align:center
is the main theme of the play?

00:12:47.517 --> 00:12:49.144 position:50% align:center
Yes, that's correct, it is!

00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:51.354 position:50% align:center
And the two of us are
completely in sync!

00:12:51.396 --> 00:12:53.606 position:50% align:center
Right? Don't you agree?

00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:57.152 position:50% align:center
This feels like a blooper.

00:12:57.193 --> 00:12:59.863 position:50% align:center
Thing is, it was kinda tough
'cause we'd all just met,

00:12:59.904 --> 00:13:01.656 position:50% align:center
but yeah, I wrote the script.

00:13:01.698 --> 00:13:04.659 position:50% align:center
Not that it's-- I mean,
this is my first time.

00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:07.412 position:50% align:center
Ha! You're one to
talk about nerves.

00:13:07.454 --> 00:13:09.789 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow, you're quite the
handsome one, aren't you?

00:13:09.831 --> 00:13:12.500 position:50% align:center
Heh. Thanks so much,
I appreciate that.

00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:14.294 position:50% align:center
Considering we're
an all-male troupe,

00:13:14.336 --> 00:13:16.463 position:50% align:center
I think our production
will be especially enjoyable

00:13:16.504 --> 00:13:18.173 position:50% align:center
to our female audience.

00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:22.093 position:50% align:center
Itaru's all growed-up.
Never guess he's a gamer bum.

00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:24.554 position:50% align:center
[CITRON] Hi, I'm Citron
and I play the priest!

00:13:24.596 --> 00:13:26.806 position:50% align:center
When did you decide
to wear a mask, Citron?

00:13:26.848 --> 00:13:28.683 position:50% align:center
I will not be filmed
without makeup.

00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:30.060 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:32.437 position:50% align:center
I hope all of this helps
with spreading the word.

00:13:32.479 --> 00:13:34.022 position:50% align:center
You and me, both.

00:13:34.064 --> 00:13:37.525 position:50% align:center
We need to thank Kazunari for
his connections at the station!

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:43.490 position:50% align:center
Uh.

00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:46.076 position:50% align:center
Hey, good morning.

00:13:46.117 --> 00:13:49.120 position:50% align:center
Good morning, Chigasaki.

00:13:52.499 --> 00:13:54.834 position:50% align:center
I saw you on TV.

00:13:54.876 --> 00:13:56.586 position:50% align:center
You really joined
a theater troupe?

00:13:56.628 --> 00:13:59.172 position:50% align:center
That's right. You should
come to my show.

00:13:59.214 --> 00:14:01.716 position:50% align:center
I think it's gonna turn out
to be pretty decent.

00:14:01.758 --> 00:14:04.302 position:50% align:center
I will, eventually.

00:14:13.103 --> 00:14:14.729 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] If you can channel
the same emotions

00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:18.650 position:50% align:center
your character's feeling, you'll
nail that part every time.

00:14:20.694 --> 00:14:22.612 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Masumi?

00:14:27.534 --> 00:14:29.994 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Thanks for helping me
carry this stuff.

00:14:30.036 --> 00:14:31.413 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:01.609 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI]
Hey.

00:15:01.651 --> 00:15:03.153 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Hm?

00:15:03.194 --> 00:15:05.905 position:50% align:center
How do you think I'm doing?

00:15:05.947 --> 00:15:10.035 position:50% align:center
In your role? You're doing good,
Masumi. You are.

00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:11.536 position:50% align:center
You mean it?

00:15:11.578 --> 00:15:13.663 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Your sword-fighting
is getting better, too.

00:15:13.705 --> 00:15:15.540 position:50% align:center
Remember, even Yuzo said so.

00:15:15.582 --> 00:15:18.209 position:50% align:center
I don't care what
that old geezer thinks.

00:15:18.251 --> 00:15:21.171 position:50% align:center
Don't you get it?
I'm doing this for you.

00:15:21.212 --> 00:15:24.716 position:50% align:center
What do you mean, for me?

00:15:24.758 --> 00:15:27.052 position:50% align:center
That's not gonna work.

00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:29.220 position:50% align:center
You need to find
a goal of your own.

00:15:29.262 --> 00:15:30.972 position:50% align:center
One that'll help you
grow, personally,

00:15:31.014 --> 00:15:33.725 position:50% align:center
rather than to seek my praise.

00:15:36.853 --> 00:15:39.397 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT A]
Hey! Isn't that Masumi?

00:15:39.439 --> 00:15:42.442 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT B] Oh my gosh!
Masumi, we just saw you on TV!

00:15:42.484 --> 00:15:43.818 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT A]
Can I shake your hand?

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.236 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT B]
I bought tickets to your play

00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:47.489 position:50% align:center
and I'm inviting
my friends, too.

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:48.948 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI]
Go away.

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:50.367 position:50% align:center
Hey, Masumi!

00:15:50.408 --> 00:15:53.661 position:50% align:center
Excuse me? Who's the hag?
His manager?

00:15:53.703 --> 00:15:57.332 position:50% align:center
The wha--? Funny. I'm the
director of his theater troupe.

00:15:57.374 --> 00:16:00.251 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT B]
Really? The hag's the director?

00:16:00.293 --> 00:16:01.586 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT A]
Sad, right?

00:16:01.628 --> 00:16:04.881 position:50% align:center
Do you think she's doing it
just to get close to Masumi?

00:16:04.923 --> 00:16:06.675 position:50% align:center
Total abuse of power!

00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:09.344 position:50% align:center
Ugh, it's messed up,
she's so freakin' old.

00:16:09.386 --> 00:16:11.971 position:50% align:center
Hey! That's not-- [gasps]

00:16:12.013 --> 00:16:13.765 position:50% align:center
[splash]

00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:14.849 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT B]
Back up!

00:16:14.891 --> 00:16:17.560 position:50% align:center
Don't you dare get close
to Masumi, you troll.

00:16:17.602 --> 00:16:22.065 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS laughs]

00:16:22.107 --> 00:16:24.734 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI]
How dare you.

00:16:24.776 --> 00:16:26.277 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
No!

00:16:34.369 --> 00:16:37.831 position:50% align:center
What's up? You okay?
Did something happen?

00:16:37.872 --> 00:16:40.625 position:50% align:center
No, I'm fine,
it's nothing, really.

00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:44.838 position:50% align:center
Sorry. I, um, I didn't mean to--

00:16:44.879 --> 00:16:47.298 position:50% align:center
Huh? Masumi?

00:16:59.936 --> 00:17:02.564 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU] It's not normal
for him to be so down.

00:17:02.605 --> 00:17:04.607 position:50% align:center
[CITRON]
Did he and Izumi argue?

00:17:04.649 --> 00:17:09.654 position:50% align:center
I dunno, but I hope
it's gonna all work out.

00:17:09.696 --> 00:17:11.114 position:50% align:center
It's weird.

00:17:11.156 --> 00:17:15.535 position:50% align:center
I thought we-- I thought Masumi
and I had gotten closer.

00:17:15.577 --> 00:17:18.121 position:50% align:center
[CITRON] I think it's maybe
not that simple.

00:17:18.163 --> 00:17:20.832 position:50% align:center
You must remember,
we just met each other.

00:17:20.874 --> 00:17:23.835 position:50% align:center
We don't know large piles about
each person, and that's fine.

00:17:23.877 --> 00:17:25.545 position:50% align:center
It's this same way for Masumi.

00:17:25.587 --> 00:17:27.839 position:50% align:center
He doesn't know who we are.

00:17:27.881 --> 00:17:30.175 position:50% align:center
These friendships we make--

00:17:30.216 --> 00:17:33.345 position:50% align:center
they will continue
to grow, and grow,

00:17:33.386 --> 00:17:37.098 position:50% align:center
for a long time,
this is one step.

00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:46.274 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
Masumi? We're coming in, okay?

00:17:46.316 --> 00:17:47.400 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU]
Come on, man,

00:17:47.442 --> 00:17:49.152 position:50% align:center
just tell us what
happened, already.

00:17:49.194 --> 00:17:51.279 position:50% align:center
Masumi. You've got to jeer up.

00:17:51.321 --> 00:17:52.530 position:50% align:center
You mean "cheer."

00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:55.158 position:50% align:center
Keeping your feelings to
yourself won't help you.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.577 position:50% align:center
That makes things worse.

00:17:58.912 --> 00:17:59.954 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI]
Just kill me.

00:17:59.996 --> 00:18:00.872 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
What?

00:18:00.914 --> 00:18:02.290 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU]
What happened?

00:18:02.332 --> 00:18:05.293 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI] There's no point
in living. I got dumped.

00:18:05.335 --> 00:18:08.630 position:50% align:center
Wait a second. Did you confess
your love to the director?

00:18:08.672 --> 00:18:09.506 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI]
No.

00:18:09.547 --> 00:18:11.091 position:50% align:center
Did you find out
she has a boyfriend

00:18:11.132 --> 00:18:11.966 position:50% align:center
or something like that?

00:18:12.008 --> 00:18:15.428 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI]
I'd-- [groans]

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:17.681 position:50% align:center
No way. You know
I'd just kill him.

00:18:17.722 --> 00:18:20.266 position:50% align:center
Hey, hang on a sec. Calm down!

00:18:25.313 --> 00:18:27.148 position:50% align:center
What happened?

00:18:28.858 --> 00:18:30.402 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA chuckles]
I don't know,

00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:32.195 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't really call
that getting "dumped."

00:18:32.237 --> 00:18:33.780 position:50% align:center
A misunderstanding...

00:18:33.822 --> 00:18:37.701 position:50% align:center
With one-sided love, it's easy
to assume negative things.

00:18:37.742 --> 00:18:41.204 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but unrequited love is
actually the best, in the end.

00:18:41.246 --> 00:18:43.081 position:50% align:center
How are you suddenly so mature?

00:18:43.123 --> 00:18:45.625 position:50% align:center
No time for gaming if
you're really dating.

00:18:45.667 --> 00:18:47.836 position:50% align:center
Never mind,
you're still an infant.

00:18:47.877 --> 00:18:49.921 position:50% align:center
You should talk it out with her.

00:18:49.963 --> 00:18:52.090 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI] I have no clue
what I would say, though.

00:18:52.132 --> 00:18:55.760 position:50% align:center
Easy. Apologize! Say you're
sorry for hitting her.

00:18:55.802 --> 00:18:57.345 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI]
I think she hates me now.

00:18:57.387 --> 00:19:01.349 position:50% align:center
No, she'll forgive you!
And I'll go with you!

00:19:04.269 --> 00:19:05.770 position:50% align:center
Aw, man.

00:19:05.812 --> 00:19:08.606 position:50% align:center
It's weird, Sakuya's got
that older brother vibe.

00:19:08.648 --> 00:19:10.275 position:50% align:center
--Huh?
--[ITARU] It's true.

00:19:10.316 --> 00:19:11.985 position:50% align:center
[CITRON]
Masumi is the little bro!

00:19:12.027 --> 00:19:13.695 position:50% align:center
I love that!

00:19:13.737 --> 00:19:16.239 position:50% align:center
I don't have any siblings,
so it's kinda nice.

00:19:16.281 --> 00:19:18.491 position:50% align:center
I'm going alone.

00:19:18.533 --> 00:19:20.452 position:50% align:center
Masumi!

00:19:24.039 --> 00:19:28.043 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Uh. What's up?

00:19:28.084 --> 00:19:29.544 position:50% align:center
Go on.

00:19:29.586 --> 00:19:34.257 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, for before.
I didn't mean to...

00:19:35.592 --> 00:19:38.053 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
It's fine, don't worry about it.

00:19:38.094 --> 00:19:39.554 position:50% align:center
But are you sure?

00:19:39.596 --> 00:19:41.681 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Yep. It happened
accidentally while

00:19:41.723 --> 00:19:43.016 position:50% align:center
you were trying to help me.

00:19:43.058 --> 00:19:46.895 position:50% align:center
I know that.
Actually, I was worried

00:19:46.936 --> 00:19:50.190 position:50% align:center
you might be upset
about what I said.

00:19:50.231 --> 00:19:51.858 position:50% align:center
I've been thinking a lot.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.694 position:50% align:center
It's like, I don't know why
I'm acting anymore.

00:19:54.736 --> 00:19:56.363 position:50% align:center
You're making progress, though.

00:19:56.404 --> 00:19:59.240 position:50% align:center
So much so that I thought,
maybe you'd finally found

00:19:59.282 --> 00:20:01.201 position:50% align:center
an actor whose work
inspires you.

00:20:01.242 --> 00:20:03.703 position:50% align:center
There was always someone
whose acting I liked.

00:20:03.745 --> 00:20:04.579 position:50% align:center
Hm?

00:20:04.621 --> 00:20:07.415 position:50% align:center
You're that person for me.

00:20:07.457 --> 00:20:09.626 position:50% align:center
I've always loved your acting.

00:20:09.668 --> 00:20:13.588 position:50% align:center
So, I was doing my best
to be like you.

00:20:14.589 --> 00:20:17.175 position:50% align:center
You like my super-cheesy acting?

00:20:17.217 --> 00:20:19.177 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI]
I really do.

00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:24.182 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Thank you, Masumi.

00:20:24.224 --> 00:20:25.600 position:50% align:center
Thanks for what?

00:20:25.642 --> 00:20:28.353 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] I guess... because I
thought I made no impression

00:20:28.395 --> 00:20:33.692 position:50% align:center
on anyone as an actor.
But that's not true.

00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:38.530 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much for
appreciating my work. Truly.

00:20:40.365 --> 00:20:42.158 position:50% align:center
I love you.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.285 position:50% align:center
[gasping]

00:20:44.327 --> 00:20:46.246 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI]
I love you.

00:20:46.287 --> 00:20:47.706 position:50% align:center
Wait, hold on!

00:20:47.747 --> 00:20:51.251 position:50% align:center
Ahh! Masumi, listen,
you have to stop!

00:20:51.292 --> 00:20:52.752 position:50% align:center
--Right now! Please!
--You're in my way, Sakuya.

00:20:52.794 --> 00:20:57.132 position:50% align:center
No, it's wrong! You can't
force her love-- Hold on.

00:20:57.173 --> 00:20:59.551 position:50% align:center
Did you call me
by my actual name?

00:20:59.592 --> 00:21:00.635 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
He did!

00:21:00.677 --> 00:21:03.138 position:50% align:center
That's the first time
you've used my name!

00:21:03.179 --> 00:21:05.181 position:50% align:center
Would you shut up?

00:21:06.891 --> 00:21:10.395 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA laughs]
That makes me so happy, Masumi!

00:21:10.437 --> 00:21:12.814 position:50% align:center
Thank you! Come on,
call me by my name again!

00:21:12.856 --> 00:21:15.066 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI]
Get off me.

00:21:15.108 --> 00:21:16.735 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA] We in the
Spring Troupe started off

00:21:16.776 --> 00:21:19.779 position:50% align:center
kinda like little flower buds.

00:21:19.821 --> 00:21:24.993 position:50% align:center
But we've grown and we're
working towards our moment.

00:21:25.035 --> 00:21:28.747 position:50% align:center
I have faith we'll get there.

00:21:35.712 --> 00:21:38.256 position:50% align:center
Forsake your home
and name, Julius.

00:21:38.298 --> 00:21:39.799 position:50% align:center
Because, after all,
don't we have

00:21:39.841 --> 00:21:42.218 position:50% align:center
an even grander dream
we both share?

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:49.684 position:50% align:center
I can't. Don't ask, I can't!
I won't forsake my family.

00:21:51.644 --> 00:21:53.730 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE] We'll begin seating
for the <i>Romeo and Julius</i>

00:21:53.772 --> 00:21:56.274 position:50% align:center
dress rehearsal shortly!

00:22:07.452 --> 00:22:08.995 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
This, I know:

00:22:09.037 --> 00:22:13.792 position:50% align:center
Together on this stage,
we're all about to bloom!
