[IZUMI gasping]

00:00:17.892 --> 00:00:20.937 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Here, I just came
to give you the script!

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:23.064 position:50% align:center
Sorry to bother you!

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:24.357 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:01:58.868 --> 00:02:00.245 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Okay!

00:02:00.328 --> 00:02:01.955 position:50% align:center
Today, we're going to start
reading through the play.

00:02:02.038 --> 00:02:04.541 position:50% align:center
But you've all found time to get
through it on your own, right?

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:05.792 position:50% align:center
Yeah, for sure!

00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:07.168 position:50% align:center
All ready to go!

00:02:07.252 --> 00:02:10.255 position:50% align:center
I can't believe I only
have five lines.

00:02:10.338 --> 00:02:12.674 position:50% align:center
Itaru, did you get
a chance to read it?

00:02:12.757 --> 00:02:14.843 position:50% align:center
Sure did. Thanks for
the hand-delivery.

00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:18.138 position:50% align:center
I was half-asleep, though. Hope
I didn't say anything too crazy.

00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:19.764 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Uh. Heh, heh...

00:02:19.848 --> 00:02:21.349 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
Hold on.

00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:23.810 position:50% align:center
Masumi, where's your script?

00:02:23.893 --> 00:02:26.187 position:50% align:center
I've got the whole play
memorized already.

00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:27.939 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
What? You're already off book?

00:02:28.023 --> 00:02:28.940 position:50% align:center
I am.

00:02:29.024 --> 00:02:30.942 position:50% align:center
You're amazing!

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:35.905 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] Well, let's do it!
How 'bout we start from the top?

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.742 position:50% align:center
I guess what I mean is,
there's a whole world out there

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:41.995 position:50% align:center
that I know nothing about yet.
And someday,

00:02:42.078 --> 00:02:44.581 position:50% align:center
I want to see it with
my very own eyes.

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:46.249 position:50% align:center
If we both share
that same dream,

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:49.210 position:50% align:center
then I say there's only
one thing to do!

00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:53.882 position:50% align:center
Let's go on... Let's go on
a journey together, Julius!

00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:57.802 position:50% align:center
Uh... We can ditch this little
town and go travel the world!

00:02:57.886 --> 00:02:59.429 position:50% align:center
Uh, hold on, what's next?

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:00.972 position:50% align:center
Uh. Whaddya say, pal?

00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:02.390 position:50% align:center
Maybe so.

00:03:02.474 --> 00:03:05.852 position:50% align:center
You've got brawn, Romeo,
and I've clearly got the brains.

00:03:05.935 --> 00:03:07.228 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:09.647 position:50% align:center
"So, Romeo, did you
get your heart broken?

00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:11.232 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about it.

00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:14.694 position:50% align:center
You know what they say, there
are plenty of fish out there."

"If there's any more of this,

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.492 position:50% align:center
I'll take it as a declaration of
war against House Montague."

00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:23.995 position:50% align:center
Ooh! My God!

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.748 position:50% align:center
"Julius. I promised
to go on a journey

00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:29.834 position:50% align:center
with you and I think..."
That's not right.

00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:31.419 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI]
This sucks.

00:03:31.503 --> 00:03:34.172 position:50% align:center
You keep messing up,
it's impossible to engage.

[SAKUYA grunts]

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.717 position:50% align:center
Give him a break,
it's our first time through.

00:03:37.801 --> 00:03:39.344 position:50% align:center
Let's just try to get to the--

00:03:39.427 --> 00:03:41.262 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI] He can't even read
the script in front of him.

00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:42.389 position:50% align:center
Sorry...

00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:43.890 position:50% align:center
As for you.

00:03:43.973 --> 00:03:45.850 position:50% align:center
You wrote the thing and you
still don't know your lines.

00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:47.018 position:50% align:center
Wha--?

00:03:47.102 --> 00:03:49.104 position:50% align:center
That's enough, you two!

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.650 position:50% align:center
I'm really sorry.
This is all because I'm no good.

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:55.026 position:50% align:center
Hey, don't say that.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.862 position:50% align:center
The whole reason we rehearse
is to get better, right?

00:03:57.946 --> 00:04:00.740 position:50% align:center
[ITARU]
Excuse me, Director?

00:04:00.824 --> 00:04:03.576 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid I'm still not
feeling that great.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.288 position:50% align:center
Do you think I could
be excused early?

00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:09.082 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:14.170 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
I-It's okay. Feel better soon!

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:15.714 position:50% align:center
[door closes]

00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:18.675 position:50% align:center
Okay! I guess I'll be reading
all of Itaru's parts, then.

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:21.011 position:50% align:center
Let's pick it up from
where we left off.

00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:36.151 position:50% align:center

00:04:57.464 --> 00:05:00.550 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU] "Romeo. One day,
this family's entire future

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:02.844 position:50% align:center
will hinge upon you. And I"...

00:05:02.927 --> 00:05:04.596 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI]
"This town's."

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:07.891 position:50% align:center
The line is "this town's
future," not "this family's."

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:09.059 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU]
Oh.

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:11.061 position:50% align:center
How are you not
getting this right?

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:14.272 position:50% align:center
Hold on, you know
everybody else's part, too?

00:05:14.356 --> 00:05:16.858 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI] Any idiot would
if they hear them every day.

00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:17.901 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU]
That an insult?

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:19.527 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI]
You'd know if it were.

00:05:19.611 --> 00:05:21.488 position:50% align:center
Anyway, you're the writer--

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:24.074 position:50% align:center
shouldn't you at least
understand your own character?

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:25.158 position:50% align:center
Hey, now!

00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:26.701 position:50% align:center
You think I don't
get my character?

00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:28.119 position:50% align:center
It's like you're reading lines

00:05:28.203 --> 00:05:29.871 position:50% align:center
without putting
thought into them.

00:05:29.954 --> 00:05:31.122 position:50% align:center
I'm still learning the part!

00:05:31.206 --> 00:05:33.041 position:50% align:center
It's not 'cause I don't
get what he's feeling.

00:05:33.124 --> 00:05:34.918 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI]
Either way, it blows.

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:36.294 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU]
Huh?!

00:05:36.378 --> 00:05:38.088 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Stop this!

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:41.466 position:50% align:center
Masumi, you went too far.

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:43.760 position:50% align:center
Learn to be a team player!

00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:45.512 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI] So you're saying
you want me to suck

00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:46.846 position:50% align:center
like the rest of you?

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.098 position:50% align:center
Halt right there!

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:51.226 position:50% align:center
My friends, you're both
oozing yourselves!

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:54.145 position:50% align:center
I think you might mean "losing"?

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.110 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Everyone just calm down.

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:02.570 position:50% align:center
I think it's a good
time for a break.

00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:05.115 position:50% align:center
[exhales]

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:09.411 position:50% align:center
You feel that? The air
in here is so thick.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.417 position:50% align:center
Good work! Now, let's call it
a day. We're moving slowly,

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.253 position:50% align:center
so I hope everyone'll
keep working on their own.

00:06:18.336 --> 00:06:21.381 position:50% align:center
I think you're really
just talking to two of us.

00:06:21.464 --> 00:06:22.757 position:50% align:center
Who are you talking about?

00:06:22.841 --> 00:06:24.384 position:50% align:center
Just guess.

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:27.053 position:50% align:center
It's me! I'm the worst one here.

00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:28.805 position:50% align:center
I need practice.

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:37.355 position:50% align:center

00:06:55.331 --> 00:06:58.418 position:50% align:center
Can I come in?

00:06:58.501 --> 00:07:01.921 position:50% align:center
Well, this is quite
a treat. It's so late!

00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:03.965 position:50% align:center
Is everything okay?

00:07:04.049 --> 00:07:05.967 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU]
I don't wanna see his face.

00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:09.596 position:50% align:center
Ya think I could sleep here?
I'll take the floor.

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:11.473 position:50% align:center
Something up with
you and Masumi?

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:13.266 position:50% align:center
I dunno what his deal is.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.478 position:50% align:center
I can't even practice on my
own without him butting in.

00:07:16.561 --> 00:07:19.814 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA] Really? Wow.
That's not like him.

00:07:19.898 --> 00:07:21.566 position:50% align:center
Isn't it, though?

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:24.152 position:50% align:center
At school he's always alone.

00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:27.614 position:50% align:center
He won't talk if someone
tries to say hello.

00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:32.118 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA] To be honest,
it was kind of surprising

00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:35.372 position:50% align:center
how quickly he latched
on to the director.

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:38.875 position:50% align:center
I always assumed he couldn't
care less what anyone else did.

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:42.337 position:50% align:center
It seemed like he barely noticed
we were there before today.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.672 position:50% align:center
Now that I think about it,

00:07:43.755 --> 00:07:46.216 position:50% align:center
he did change once we started
the read-throughs.

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:48.551 position:50% align:center
That's when he started
making comments and stuff.

00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:49.969 position:50% align:center
I think he's oh-so-shy!

00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:51.763 position:50% align:center
No, he's prickly.

00:07:51.846 --> 00:07:53.348 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
Here's the thing.

00:07:53.431 --> 00:07:54.724 position:50% align:center
He's always alone at home

00:07:54.808 --> 00:07:57.769 position:50% align:center
because his parents are
constantly traveling abroad.

00:07:57.852 --> 00:08:02.232 position:50% align:center
Maybe he's just not used to
interacting with other people.

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:05.318 position:50% align:center
Oh, man, I can't even
imagine being an only child.

00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:07.237 position:50% align:center
I have a ton of siblings.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.531 position:50% align:center
Listen, I know Masumi
can be super harsh,

00:08:09.614 --> 00:08:12.659 position:50% align:center
but as far as his critiques go,
I think he's right.

00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:14.077 position:50% align:center
When it's my line,

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.455 position:50% align:center
I tend to get super nervous
and mess up a lot.

00:08:17.539 --> 00:08:19.916 position:50% align:center
So, as insensitive as
he sounds sometimes,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.584 position:50% align:center
it might just be his
messed-up way of trying

00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:23.586 position:50% align:center
to help the show succeed.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:28.550 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU]
I dunno.

00:08:28.633 --> 00:08:32.929 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I don't think he's
all that serious about acting.

00:08:33.972 --> 00:08:37.434 position:50% align:center
Look. We won't let him
have the last word, okay?

00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:38.935 position:50% align:center
Wha--?

00:08:39.686 --> 00:08:41.062 position:50% align:center
I wanna prove him wrong.

00:08:41.146 --> 00:08:43.481 position:50% align:center
Let's start practicing
every morning, 'kay?

00:08:43.565 --> 00:08:45.275 position:50% align:center
Totally! I love that!

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:47.652 position:50% align:center
And I'll join you!

00:08:47.736 --> 00:08:50.280 position:50% align:center
Let's meet up in the
practice room at six A.M.

00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:52.490 position:50% align:center
Great! I guess we should
probably go to bed

00:08:52.574 --> 00:08:55.785 position:50% align:center
early tonight. My bunk
is yours if you want it.

00:08:59.247 --> 00:09:01.041 position:50% align:center
Uh. Actually...

00:09:01.124 --> 00:09:02.667 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:02.751 --> 00:09:05.712 position:50% align:center
Thank you, but I should
get back to my room.

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:09.174 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna need to tell Masumi
about the morning practice.

00:09:09.257 --> 00:09:10.675 position:50% align:center
Oh, good idea!

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:12.552 position:50% align:center
Let's let Itaru know, too!

00:16:23.274 --> 00:16:25.360 position:50% align:center
Last up, Romeo!

00:16:25.443 --> 00:16:27.404 position:50% align:center
Oh! Yes, sir!

00:16:27.487 --> 00:16:30.240 position:50% align:center
'Fraid you're hopeless, kiddo.
You're charged with carrying

00:16:30.323 --> 00:16:33.076 position:50% align:center
this play but you understand
nothin' about the stage.

00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:35.537 position:50% align:center
You gotta go back to square one.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.080 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:40.917 position:50% align:center
All right, well,
that's it for now.

00:16:41.001 --> 00:16:44.087 position:50% align:center
I'll do my best to drop
by again if I'm free.

00:16:45.255 --> 00:16:47.424 position:50% align:center
That was annoying.

00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:50.051 position:50% align:center
Thanks so much, I really
appreciate you coming today.

00:16:50.135 --> 00:16:54.305 position:50% align:center
That Romeo. He has potential
if he finds his way.

00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:55.348 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:57.892 --> 00:17:01.354 position:50% align:center
[YUZO] What I mean is,
whether he succeeds or fails,

00:17:01.438 --> 00:17:04.816 position:50% align:center
completely depends on you.

00:17:04.899 --> 00:17:07.235 position:50% align:center
I'll be honest. As the director,
you're at fault

00:17:07.318 --> 00:17:09.195 position:50% align:center
for this disaster whether
you like it or not.

00:17:09.279 --> 00:17:11.698 position:50% align:center
They need a lot more from you.

00:17:11.781 --> 00:17:14.159 position:50% align:center
It's your responsibility.

00:17:16.703 --> 00:17:20.665 position:50% align:center
Okay! Then I'll refocus
and give it another shot!

00:17:20.749 --> 00:17:22.083 position:50% align:center
Good.

00:17:41.519 --> 00:17:43.897 position:50% align:center
Do you think everybody's
okay, though?

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:47.067 position:50% align:center
What if he was too harsh and
they decide to quit on us?

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:48.735 position:50% align:center
They're not going to do that.

00:17:48.818 --> 00:17:52.405 position:50% align:center
Just trust me! I'm sure
they'll come back around.

00:17:57.369 --> 00:17:58.828 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU]
Sakuya?

00:17:58.912 --> 00:18:00.705 position:50% align:center
Oh. Hey, Tsuzuru.

00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:03.958 position:50% align:center
Where're you lugging that
stuff to this time of night?

00:18:04.042 --> 00:18:06.670 position:50% align:center
I keep thinking about everything
Yuzo said before,

00:18:06.753 --> 00:18:08.588 position:50% align:center
so I can't get to sleep.

00:18:08.672 --> 00:18:10.840 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I can relate.

00:18:10.924 --> 00:18:13.385 position:50% align:center
Before... I was just happy
to be on the stage

00:18:13.468 --> 00:18:15.428 position:50% align:center
and I was satisfied with that.

00:18:15.512 --> 00:18:16.888 position:50% align:center
Now, I know...

00:18:16.971 --> 00:18:19.974 position:50% align:center
I wasn't taking the craft
of acting seriously at all.

00:18:21.643 --> 00:18:24.646 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
I... can't go on like this.

00:18:24.729 --> 00:18:26.940 position:50% align:center
Wait! Hold up!
You're not leaving, are you?

00:18:27.023 --> 00:18:28.441 position:50% align:center
Of course not!

00:18:28.525 --> 00:18:30.735 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna try sleeping on
the stage so that maybe I can

00:18:30.819 --> 00:18:33.738 position:50% align:center
start feeling more
comfortable up there!

00:18:33.822 --> 00:18:35.240 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:35.323 --> 00:18:37.242 position:50% align:center
I shall join the stage-sleeping!

00:18:37.325 --> 00:18:38.868 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU]
Citron's going, too?

00:18:38.952 --> 00:18:42.288 position:50% align:center
That's right! I'm ready to go!

00:18:42.372 --> 00:18:44.666 position:50% align:center
Jeez, all right, it's happening.

00:18:44.749 --> 00:18:46.543 position:50% align:center
Uh, what do you mean?

00:18:46.626 --> 00:18:52.007 position:50% align:center
Follow me. Let's drag Masumi
and Itaru with us, yeah?

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:53.383 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:18:58.596 --> 00:19:02.267 position:50% align:center
Hey, guys. It means a lot
to me that you're doing this.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:05.395 position:50% align:center
I don't really care where I am,
as long as I have my games.

00:19:05.478 --> 00:19:06.646 position:50% align:center
What am I doing here?

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:09.274 position:50% align:center
Who cares. You're here.
Now, stop complaining.

00:19:09.357 --> 00:19:13.737 position:50% align:center
This is just like summer camp,
don't you think? So fun!

00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:24.039 position:50% align:center
Hey, um, are any of you
guys still awake?

00:19:24.122 --> 00:19:25.415 position:50% align:center
Sadly, yes.

00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:27.167 position:50% align:center
What did you think
about earlier?

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:29.669 position:50% align:center
Everything Yuzo said?

00:19:29.753 --> 00:19:31.671 position:50% align:center
It pissed me off.

00:19:31.755 --> 00:19:33.548 position:50% align:center
He sucked.

00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:36.301 position:50% align:center
Yeah, he definitely didn't
have to be that blunt.

00:19:36.384 --> 00:19:38.178 position:50% align:center
He was whipping us
rough with love!

00:19:38.261 --> 00:19:39.554 position:50% align:center
Phrasing, Citron!

00:19:39.637 --> 00:19:40.930 position:50% align:center
I know, right?

00:19:41.014 --> 00:19:42.974 position:50% align:center
I thought he was being
way too harsh at first, too.

00:19:43.058 --> 00:19:45.018 position:50% align:center
I think it was
tough love, though.

00:19:45.101 --> 00:19:47.812 position:50% align:center
[CITRON]
Yeah, that!

00:19:47.896 --> 00:19:49.439 position:50% align:center
Have you guys noticed?

00:19:49.522 --> 00:19:51.358 position:50% align:center
Our director's been
looking pretty troubled

00:19:51.441 --> 00:19:53.777 position:50% align:center
while watching us rehearse.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.738 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI] Ever since we
started our run-throughs.

00:19:56.821 --> 00:19:59.574 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA] Guess I'm not
surprised you caught on.

00:19:59.657 --> 00:20:03.703 position:50% align:center
I take it that means she's not
satisfied with our performances?

00:20:03.787 --> 00:20:06.206 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA]
Yeah. I think that's prob'ly why

00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:08.333 position:50% align:center
she wanted to give us a
wake-up call, you know?

00:20:08.416 --> 00:20:09.793 position:50% align:center
That makes sense.

00:20:09.876 --> 00:20:14.464 position:50% align:center
She is smart. It's good
motivation to improve.

00:20:14.547 --> 00:20:17.759 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA] You know,
when I saw my first play,

00:20:17.842 --> 00:20:20.804 position:50% align:center
I was just in elementary school.

00:20:20.887 --> 00:20:23.640 position:50% align:center
I was completely
engrossed by it,

00:20:23.723 --> 00:20:25.809 position:50% align:center
and it made me
want to be on stage--

00:20:25.892 --> 00:20:29.229 position:50% align:center
to tell stories
in that same way.

00:20:29.312 --> 00:20:30.980 position:50% align:center
I kinda know what you mean.

00:20:31.064 --> 00:20:32.065 position:50% align:center
[GROUP gasps]

00:20:32.148 --> 00:20:33.817 position:50% align:center
Thought you didn't
care about acting,

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:36.736 position:50% align:center
or, you know, anything else.

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:39.739 position:50% align:center
I have my moments.
I'm a human being.

00:20:39.823 --> 00:20:41.783 position:50% align:center
How sweet.

00:20:44.452 --> 00:20:47.122 position:50% align:center
I just... I wanna do better!

00:20:47.205 --> 00:20:49.541 position:50% align:center
I wanna know so much more!

00:20:49.624 --> 00:20:55.130 position:50% align:center
No matter what!
I have to be an actor!

00:21:05.015 --> 00:21:06.975 position:50% align:center
I'm in.

00:21:07.058 --> 00:21:08.309 position:50% align:center
Let's do it!

00:21:08.393 --> 00:21:12.564 position:50% align:center
I'll prove Yuzo wrong if
it's the last thing I do!

00:21:12.647 --> 00:21:13.898 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI]
So loud...

00:21:13.982 --> 00:21:17.318 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna show the rest
of you I mean it, too!

00:21:17.402 --> 00:21:18.903 position:50% align:center
You better.

00:21:18.987 --> 00:21:21.281 position:50% align:center
Me, too! I'm gonna work hard!

00:21:21.364 --> 00:21:23.783 position:50% align:center
We can do this!

00:21:23.867 --> 00:21:26.953 position:50% align:center
That means we're all
in this together, huh?

00:21:27.037 --> 00:21:28.329 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:21:31.499 --> 00:21:34.044 position:50% align:center
Sakuya, I think you might've
just skipped a line.

00:21:34.127 --> 00:21:35.086 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry!

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:36.713 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU]
What if I try something?

00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:39.674 position:50% align:center
I could direct the previous
line more towards Romeo.

00:21:39.758 --> 00:21:42.844 position:50% align:center
[SAKUYA] Oh! Yeah, actually,
that would help a lot!

00:21:42.927 --> 00:21:46.097 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU] What if we take it
back from there? Is that cool?

00:21:46.181 --> 00:21:47.223 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI]
Works for me.

00:21:47.307 --> 00:21:48.308 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Hm?

00:21:51.936 --> 00:21:53.813 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
They're really growing, now.

00:21:53.897 --> 00:21:56.941 position:50% align:center
If this keeps up,
we're gonna be fine!

00:21:57.025 --> 00:21:58.318 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI laughs]

00:23:29.284 --> 00:23:31.828 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI humming]

00:23:31.911 --> 00:23:34.664 position:50% align:center
[phone ringing]

00:23:34.748 --> 00:23:36.249 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Itaru?

00:23:37.542 --> 00:23:39.544 position:50% align:center
Hey! What's up, Itaru?

00:23:39.627 --> 00:23:41.880 position:50% align:center
[ITARU]
Hi. It's, uh...

00:23:41.963 --> 00:23:44.132 position:50% align:center
Well, I've been
thinking a lot, and...

00:23:44.215 --> 00:23:46.259 position:50% align:center
I'm quitting the troupe.
