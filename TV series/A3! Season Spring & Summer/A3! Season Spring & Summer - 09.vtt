00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:21.271 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Man, this weather. I was
not made for this kind of heat.

00:00:21.312 --> 00:00:24.774 position:50% align:center
C'mon, let's make some
memories together!

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.071 position:50% align:center
Guys! Over here!
I found a triangle!

00:00:30.113 --> 00:00:32.365 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI] Oh, buddy,
I'm gettin' a pic of that!

00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:33.867 position:50% align:center
Well, we should be heading off.

00:00:33.908 --> 00:00:35.744 position:50% align:center
Are you certain
the dorm will survive

00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:37.787 position:50% align:center
if I'm not around
looking after it?

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.165 position:50% align:center
Don't worry!
We got things covered.

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:42.542 position:50% align:center
We probably won't even
notice you're missing.

00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:44.461 position:50% align:center
Care to sit next to me?

00:00:44.502 --> 00:00:45.295 position:50% align:center
What?

00:00:45.337 --> 00:00:47.714 position:50% align:center
This trip is for the
Summer Troupe's rehearsal.

00:00:47.756 --> 00:00:49.466 position:50% align:center
Not a problem, I'll join then.

00:00:49.507 --> 00:00:52.427 position:50% align:center
Masumi, you'd just turn
your back on the rest of us?

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.013 position:50% align:center
[MASUMI] How come he
gets to go and I don't?

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:56.556 position:50% align:center
I have an important job.

00:00:56.598 --> 00:00:59.017 position:50% align:center
Nobody makes a
better gofer than me!

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.144 position:50% align:center
[TSUZURU] Why're excited
about being an errand boy?

00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:03.480 position:50% align:center
You'll need an assistant.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.775 position:50% align:center
Do me a favor--
stop acting like a kid.

00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:08.276 position:50% align:center
I am not! You are!

00:01:08.318 --> 00:01:11.279 position:50% align:center
Better make your escape
while I hold this one back.

00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:14.783 position:50% align:center
Good luck! All of you!

00:01:14.824 --> 00:01:18.787 position:50% align:center
Oh, and Tenma. Hope
everything goes well.

00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:20.955 position:50% align:center
You bet.

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:04.934 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE]
Wait till you see the inside!

00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:07.270 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Well, we made it, guys.

00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:12.817 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
This is where we're staying?

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:14.736 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
So stereotypical.

00:03:14.778 --> 00:03:17.572 position:50% align:center
[MUKU] It really reminds me of a
club training camp, you know?

00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:19.908 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI] What a beautiful
triangular roof!

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:23.578 position:50% align:center
And so retro, too!
Gonna post this to my socials!

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.872 position:50% align:center
All right, you two.
Let's get a pic!

00:03:25.914 --> 00:03:27.165 position:50% align:center
No photos, please.

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:27.999 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
Huh?

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:30.919 position:50% align:center
If we're done messing around,
can we go inside?

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.504 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI]
Okie dokie!

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:33.880 position:50% align:center
[YUKI growls]

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:38.176 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Is he ever not in boss mode?

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:40.470 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
Yuki, come on.

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:50.522 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Tell me, Scheherazade!

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:53.566 position:50% align:center
Where is the legendary
paradise Oasis?

00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:55.944 position:50% align:center
I'll spin another tale
for you tonight.

00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:58.113 position:50% align:center
Long ago, in a faraway land, a--

00:03:58.154 --> 00:04:00.115 position:50% align:center
I don't have all day,
get it out!

00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:03.076 position:50% align:center
Aladdin. A magic lamp.
And a magician.

00:04:03.118 --> 00:04:05.453 position:50% align:center
Be right back!

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:08.164 position:50% align:center
Careful out there, Ali Baba!

00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:09.416 position:50% align:center
For that line, Yuki.

00:04:09.457 --> 00:04:13.586 position:50% align:center
[TENMA] Hey. Scheherazade
shouldn't sound so carefree.

00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:15.046 position:50% align:center
Why?

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:18.133 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's probably because

00:04:18.174 --> 00:04:21.136 position:50% align:center
she's been forced to join
the king's harem, huh?

00:04:21.177 --> 00:04:24.097 position:50% align:center
[TENMA] Bingo, even though
it's made clear at the end,

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.891 position:50% align:center
you need to act the scene
with that in mind.

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:28.601 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Yeah, I get it.

00:04:28.643 --> 00:04:30.520 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:04:30.562 --> 00:04:32.939 position:50% align:center
You be careful out
there, Ali Baba!

00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:34.941 position:50% align:center
I know listening to
others has always

00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:35.984 position:50% align:center
been your biggest flaw,

00:04:36.026 --> 00:04:38.611 position:50% align:center
but for once in your life,
please give it a try.

00:04:38.653 --> 00:04:41.865 position:50% align:center
Put more of her feelings
toward Ali Baba into the line.

00:04:41.906 --> 00:04:43.992 position:50% align:center
Don't just go off instinct.

00:04:44.034 --> 00:04:46.953 position:50% align:center
Sure, whatever you say.

00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:49.497 position:50% align:center
Wow! That is one
cute girl over there!

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.875 position:50% align:center
What do ya say? Do you
wanna go out with me?

00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:53.418 position:50% align:center
You need to sound
more enthusiastic.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.754 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
Oh, but I just met her.

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:57.505 position:50% align:center
She's your future wife.

00:04:57.547 --> 00:05:00.216 position:50% align:center
Alter your delivery when
you're flirting with her.

00:05:00.258 --> 00:05:04.637 position:50% align:center
Flirt more enthusiastically.
Cool. I got it.

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:08.391 position:50% align:center
[MUKU] Oh, grow up, Ali Baba.
Legendary parasite?

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:09.267 position:50% align:center
Paradise.

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:12.937 position:50% align:center
Sorry, my bad! Where was I?

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.398 position:50% align:center
"Oh, grow up, Ali Baba.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.069 position:50% align:center
There is no legendary paradise."

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.154 position:50% align:center
There's no legendary paradise.

00:05:21.196 --> 00:05:24.074 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, it wouldn't
be called a legend!

00:05:24.115 --> 00:05:27.285 position:50% align:center
Time to face up to reality! Uh!

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:28.787 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
What's wrong?

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:34.709 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI gasping]
Up there! A triangle cloud!

00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:36.670 position:50% align:center
[TENMA] Hey, we're in
the middle or rehearsal!

00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:38.129 position:50% align:center
Focus on your lines.

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:40.590 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI]
But there're so many triangles!

00:05:40.632 --> 00:05:43.760 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI] This seems like a
perfect time for a break!

00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:47.764 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] In terms of motivation,
why did Scheherazade tell

00:05:47.806 --> 00:05:50.308 position:50% align:center
the <i>Thousand and One Nights
</i>stories anyway?

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.810 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
It was probably her job.

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:52.811 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Guess again.

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:55.563 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI] As a thank you
for giving her onigiri!

00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:57.190 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
That definitely wasn't it.

00:05:57.232 --> 00:05:58.274 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
Who knows?

00:05:58.316 --> 00:06:01.695 position:50% align:center
If only Tsuzuroon
was around to tell us.

00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:04.239 position:50% align:center
There's a chance I might be
reading too much into this,

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.158 position:50% align:center
but the play's an adaptation
of <i>Arabian Nights</i>.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.285 position:50% align:center
In the original work,
the king winds up

00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:13.331 position:50% align:center
executing every woman he spends
the night with the next morning.

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:15.458 position:50% align:center
Until Scheherazade marries him,

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.503 position:50% align:center
and tells him stories to put
an end to the murders.

00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:21.840 position:50% align:center
Each night, she told him a
different tale until its climax,

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:24.968 position:50% align:center
then promised to reveal the
ending the following day.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.387 position:50% align:center
That's how she kept him
from executing her.

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:29.222 position:50% align:center
How do you know so much?

00:06:29.264 --> 00:06:31.349 position:50% align:center
[MUKU] To be honest,
I read the whole series.

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:34.310 position:50% align:center
The whole thing?
That's a huge book!

00:06:34.352 --> 00:06:36.271 position:50% align:center
I got it from the library.

00:06:36.312 --> 00:06:38.231 position:50% align:center
Even though there're
some mature parts

00:06:38.273 --> 00:06:39.649 position:50% align:center
and it was sort of lengthy.

00:06:39.691 --> 00:06:43.445 position:50% align:center
Once I started reading,
I couldn't put the books down!

00:06:43.486 --> 00:06:44.696 position:50% align:center
Muku.

00:06:44.738 --> 00:06:46.614 position:50% align:center
[MUKU gasps]

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:47.490 position:50% align:center
Well done!

00:06:47.532 --> 00:06:50.702 position:50% align:center
And as a reward, I present you
with Super Mister Triangle!

00:06:50.744 --> 00:06:52.495 position:50% align:center
I don't know what to say.

00:06:52.537 --> 00:06:56.499 position:50% align:center
Super cute triangle!
Yeah, cute. That's it.

00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:58.209 position:50% align:center
Poor delivery.

00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:01.296 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI] The crown takes
him to a whole new level.

00:07:01.338 --> 00:07:04.007 position:50% align:center
Looks like I've been
promoted from the eraser.

00:07:04.049 --> 00:07:05.175 position:50% align:center
It's an honor, really.

00:07:05.216 --> 00:07:07.927 position:50% align:center
Did you read the play to
better prepare for your role?

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:10.805 position:50% align:center
[MUKU] Yeah. I wanted to dive
in and understand the world

00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:12.807 position:50% align:center
of <i>The Thousand
and One Nights.</i>

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:15.560 position:50% align:center
You put in the effort,
I'll give you that.

00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:16.936 position:50% align:center
Thank you so much!

00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:20.940 position:50% align:center
Ew. The plot revolves around
a king who kills women?

00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:23.902 position:50% align:center
Then it makes sense why
she never wanted to marry him.

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:26.946 position:50% align:center
[TENMA] Now do you get
Scheherazade's emotional state?

00:07:26.988 --> 00:07:28.698 position:50% align:center
You could learn a lot from Muku.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.950 position:50% align:center
Do you have an off switch?

00:07:30.992 --> 00:07:32.744 position:50% align:center
We'll talk details later.

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:34.454 position:50% align:center
It'll help with the costumes.

00:07:34.496 --> 00:07:36.081 position:50% align:center
That sounds great!

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:39.959 position:50% align:center
[door creaks]

00:07:40.001 --> 00:07:42.087 position:50% align:center
Heard rehearsal was productive!

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:44.089 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI] Time for us to grab
some grub and recharge.

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.591 position:50% align:center
Onigiri! Onigiri!

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:48.718 position:50% align:center
How's the dinner
situation lookin'?

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.846 position:50% align:center
We'll cook the meal together
as a team building exercise!

00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:52.764 position:50% align:center
A what?

00:07:52.806 --> 00:07:54.724 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
There's not even an onsite chef?

00:07:54.766 --> 00:07:55.975 position:50% align:center
I have no problem cooking.

00:07:56.017 --> 00:07:57.936 position:50% align:center
No thanks.

00:07:57.977 --> 00:08:00.522 position:50% align:center
You're in for real treat,
because for tonight's dinner,

00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:01.940 position:50% align:center
we're making authentic curry,

00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:03.817 position:50% align:center
a favorite staple
of all humankind!

00:08:03.858 --> 00:08:06.820 position:50% align:center
--Again?
--This is getting so ridiculous.

00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:08.238 position:50% align:center
Even if it's an encore,

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:10.573 position:50% align:center
her curry gets a standing
ovation from me.

00:08:10.615 --> 00:08:13.076 position:50% align:center
It's great. You got
no complaints here.

00:08:13.118 --> 00:08:15.453 position:50% align:center
As long as there's onigiri,
I'm on board.

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:16.579 position:50% align:center
And just so you know,

00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:18.998 position:50% align:center
these spices were imported
directly from India.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.126 position:50% align:center
I call dibs on making the rice.

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:23.128 position:50% align:center
All you have to do
is press a button.

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:25.380 position:50% align:center
I guess I'll wash
the vegetables, then.

00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:26.631 position:50% align:center
I'm looking up the recipe.

00:08:26.673 --> 00:08:29.634 position:50% align:center
And the onigiri will
be my department.

00:08:34.264 --> 00:08:36.391 position:50% align:center
If you're gonna handle the rice,
wash it properly.

00:08:36.433 --> 00:08:38.309 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] You've got an attitude
about everything,

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:39.144 position:50% align:center
not just acting.

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:40.603 position:50% align:center
What I've got is common sense.

00:08:40.645 --> 00:08:43.690 position:50% align:center
Do you? Just what kind
of rice is that anyway?

00:08:43.732 --> 00:08:46.609 position:50% align:center
I refuse to eat any kind
of rice except for Pikarin.

00:08:46.651 --> 00:08:48.486 position:50% align:center
Maybe you're too picky.

00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:50.572 position:50% align:center
[TENMA] No. I'm just more
refined than you!

00:08:50.613 --> 00:08:54.075 position:50% align:center
No need to fight. There's
no such thing as bad rice.

00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:56.369 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Why don't you zip it, ham?

00:08:56.411 --> 00:09:00.206 position:50% align:center
Ham, you say?
Radish goes great alongside it!

00:09:00.248 --> 00:09:01.541 position:50% align:center
As long as there's onigiri,

00:09:01.583 --> 00:09:03.335 position:50% align:center
there's no way the
meal can go wrong!

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:05.587 position:50% align:center
Do you know how to stop
being weird for one second?

00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:06.796 position:50% align:center
Don't be like that.

00:09:06.838 --> 00:09:08.298 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.842 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, is this boring you?

00:09:10.884 --> 00:09:13.303 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] You ruined dinner
before it even started.

00:09:13.345 --> 00:09:14.512 position:50% align:center
How's it my fault?

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:16.890 position:50% align:center
This all started because you
didn't wash the rice right!

00:09:16.931 --> 00:09:18.933 position:50% align:center
Don't blame me
for your failures.

00:09:18.975 --> 00:09:20.185 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
What was that?

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:21.644 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
C'mon, Tenten!

00:09:21.686 --> 00:09:23.605 position:50% align:center
If you don't play nice,
you could end up losing

00:09:23.646 --> 00:09:25.732 position:50% align:center
some friends, and nobody
here wants that.

00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:28.109 position:50% align:center
[gasps, growls]

00:09:28.151 --> 00:09:30.111 position:50% align:center
Well unlike you,
I'm not some shallow,

00:09:30.153 --> 00:09:33.114 position:50% align:center
suck up who only has
superficial friendships!

00:09:33.156 --> 00:09:34.449 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
Uh?

00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:40.163 position:50% align:center
If you say so.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:42.957 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:44.918 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.755 position:50% align:center
Are you gonna apologize,
or do you need a script first?

00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:50.548 position:50% align:center
[TENMA grunts]

00:09:52.342 --> 00:09:53.802 position:50% align:center
[TENMA grunts]

00:09:53.843 --> 00:09:55.679 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
Tenma, wait!

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.722 position:50% align:center
Just let him go.

00:10:09.234 --> 00:10:10.068 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.945 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
There you are.

00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:19.369 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
What do you want?

00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:22.288 position:50% align:center
Try it. You won't believe
how good it tastes!

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:27.210 position:50% align:center
Even better than usual.
Everyone else already finished.

00:10:27.252 --> 00:10:28.294 position:50% align:center
I'm good.

00:10:28.336 --> 00:10:31.923 position:50% align:center
[stomach grumbles]

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:34.592 position:50% align:center
You haven't eaten anything
today, have you?

00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:37.387 position:50% align:center
You'll need the energy
for rehearsals.

00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:48.148 position:50% align:center
Hey, not bad.

00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:49.232 position:50% align:center
I know, right?

00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:51.234 position:50% align:center
The others can't
stop raving about it!

00:10:51.276 --> 00:10:52.569 position:50% align:center
Keep hanging with me

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:55.155 position:50% align:center
and you'll be a master
of curry curriculum!

00:10:55.196 --> 00:10:58.074 position:50% align:center
I'm working on a play right now,
so I don't have the time.

00:10:58.116 --> 00:11:01.703 position:50% align:center
Hey. Try eating with the
group tomorrow, all right?

00:11:01.745 --> 00:11:03.413 position:50% align:center
You're their leader,
and they realize

00:11:03.455 --> 00:11:06.499 position:50% align:center
the enormous pressure
you're putting yourself under.

00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:08.752 position:50% align:center
Don't you think their
acting is improving, too,

00:11:08.793 --> 00:11:10.378 position:50% align:center
like they're learning
a deeper understanding

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.631 position:50% align:center
of their roles thanks to the
way you're coaching them?

00:11:13.673 --> 00:11:15.633 position:50% align:center
They need work.

00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:19.763 position:50% align:center
Rurikawa has the talent.
I'll admit to that much.

00:11:19.804 --> 00:11:22.432 position:50% align:center
But he should be thinking more.

00:11:22.474 --> 00:11:24.184 position:50% align:center
His movements
will shine on stage,

00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:26.603 position:50% align:center
but that's not gonna be enough.

00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:28.063 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:11:28.104 --> 00:11:29.397 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
And Miyoshi.

00:11:29.439 --> 00:11:32.233 position:50% align:center
He has a habit of just
going with the flow.

00:11:32.275 --> 00:11:35.445 position:50% align:center
He can match an actor's energy,
but isn't aggressive enough.

00:11:35.487 --> 00:11:39.324 position:50% align:center
Still. His flexibility is
a helpful trait onstage.

00:11:39.366 --> 00:11:42.535 position:50% align:center
Sakisaka's acting
is absurdly bad.

00:11:42.577 --> 00:11:45.789 position:50% align:center
I don't think anyone in the
troupe works harder, though.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:46.873 position:50% align:center
He actually spent the time

00:11:46.915 --> 00:11:50.251 position:50% align:center
to analyze his
character's intentions.

00:11:50.293 --> 00:11:52.587 position:50% align:center
Now, Ikaruga has
some real skill.

00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:54.130 position:50% align:center
I bet his acting
could rival mine

00:11:54.172 --> 00:11:56.508 position:50% align:center
if he ever got serious about it.

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:59.135 position:50% align:center
The problem is he's
always playing around.

00:11:59.177 --> 00:12:00.512 position:50% align:center
That won't fly.

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:02.305 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI laughs]

00:12:02.347 --> 00:12:03.890 position:50% align:center
What's so funny?

00:12:03.932 --> 00:12:07.060 position:50% align:center
I'm just suddenly positive that
appointing you as their leader

00:12:07.102 --> 00:12:09.104 position:50% align:center
was the right decision.

00:12:11.648 --> 00:12:13.942 position:50% align:center
You need to apologize
to them tomorrow.

00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:15.402 position:50% align:center
Continue to point out
where they have

00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:18.571 position:50% align:center
some room for improvement,
but celebrate their achievements

00:12:18.613 --> 00:12:20.740 position:50% align:center
and praise them
when they do well.

00:12:20.782 --> 00:12:23.118 position:50% align:center
You have had more
experience as an actor.

00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:25.245 position:50% align:center
You can handle that, right?

00:12:25.286 --> 00:12:28.456 position:50% align:center
[TENMA] Who do you think
you're talking to?

00:12:28.498 --> 00:12:30.625 position:50% align:center
One day I'll sweep
every Best Actor award

00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:33.962 position:50% align:center
around the world,
you wait and see.

00:12:34.004 --> 00:12:37.465 position:50% align:center
Something like this
is a piece of cake.

00:12:37.507 --> 00:12:39.843 position:50% align:center
[laughs] All right, then.

00:12:39.884 --> 00:12:41.469 position:50% align:center
Why are you laughing at me?

00:12:41.511 --> 00:12:46.725 position:50% align:center
Sorry, sorry. I'm counting
on you, Tenma. Our leader!

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:50.562 position:50% align:center
Ha. Well, this should be fun.

00:12:59.446 --> 00:13:00.447 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:13:00.488 --> 00:13:05.201 position:50% align:center
You're here already.
So, good morning.

00:13:05.243 --> 00:13:06.828 position:50% align:center
Yeah, hey.

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:08.955 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
Good mornin'!

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:12.584 position:50% align:center
Everyone.

00:13:17.756 --> 00:13:21.551 position:50% align:center
Zero triangles in the sky today.

00:13:21.593 --> 00:13:26.264 position:50% align:center
That's such a bummer...
makes me gloomy.

00:13:26.306 --> 00:13:30.602 position:50% align:center
Morning, guys!
Let's start with a few warmups.

00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:38.902 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Okay, stretches?

00:13:38.943 --> 00:13:40.528 position:50% align:center
--Wait!
--[GROUP murmurs]

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.947 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
What's up?

00:13:42.989 --> 00:13:46.951 position:50% align:center
We're listening,
get on with it.

00:13:46.993 --> 00:13:55.126 position:50% align:center
[TENMA] The thing is. Uh. About
yesterday. I was, you know...

00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:57.545 position:50% align:center
No, I don't.

00:13:57.587 --> 00:14:01.800 position:50% align:center
What I said. That was...

00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:04.678 position:50% align:center
I was way too harsh yesterday!

00:14:06.054 --> 00:14:09.015 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Say what?

00:14:09.057 --> 00:14:10.767 position:50% align:center
Let's stretch.

00:14:10.809 --> 00:14:13.186 position:50% align:center
Really? That's your apology?

00:14:13.228 --> 00:14:16.106 position:50% align:center
[TENMA] Yup, now hurry up
and get loose.

00:14:16.147 --> 00:14:17.982 position:50% align:center
[GROUP laughs]

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:21.361 position:50% align:center
Why can't he just come out
and say that he's sorry.

00:14:21.403 --> 00:14:24.948 position:50% align:center
I think this is probably the
best he can manage for now.

00:14:24.989 --> 00:14:28.368 position:50% align:center
[ALL chattering]

00:14:30.537 --> 00:14:34.499 position:50% align:center
If I can't find the Oasis,
what then?

00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:38.753 position:50% align:center
I've stalled as much as I can.
But my hands are tied.

00:14:38.795 --> 00:14:42.257 position:50% align:center
I must soon join
the king's harem.

00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:45.301 position:50% align:center
Try not to come off so
emotional on the line.

00:14:45.343 --> 00:14:46.594 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Yeah, whatever.

00:14:46.636 --> 00:14:48.805 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
But your body language was good.

00:14:48.847 --> 00:14:50.598 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:51.766 position:50% align:center
Something wrong?

00:14:51.808 --> 00:14:53.768 position:50% align:center
Tenten praised you?

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:57.147 position:50% align:center
He's right, I could see your
emotions in your gestures.

00:14:57.188 --> 00:15:00.608 position:50% align:center
It's weird to hear you be nice.
I've got goosebumps!

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:02.360 position:50% align:center
What's so strange?

00:15:02.402 --> 00:15:03.361 position:50% align:center
This is good,

00:15:03.403 --> 00:15:05.488 position:50% align:center
you don't have to pretend
that you're not happy.

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:07.782 position:50% align:center
I'm not, it's freezing in here!

00:15:07.824 --> 00:15:11.077 position:50% align:center
Yuki, you're not
telling the truth.

00:15:12.537 --> 00:15:14.748 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
Oh, grow up, Ali Baba.

00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:17.667 position:50% align:center
There is no legendary
paradise to find.

00:15:17.709 --> 00:15:19.336 position:50% align:center
You're not going to
walk into the desert

00:15:19.377 --> 00:15:23.381 position:50% align:center
and leave a wealthy man,
try doing some honest work.

00:15:23.423 --> 00:15:25.633 position:50% align:center
I'd suggest pausing
at a different part.

00:15:25.675 --> 00:15:26.968 position:50% align:center
Right! Sorry.

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:30.680 position:50% align:center
But nice. Your read was solid.

00:15:30.722 --> 00:15:34.017 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow! Thanks so much!

00:15:35.185 --> 00:15:37.604 position:50% align:center
Don't be afraid to
vary your inflections.

00:15:37.645 --> 00:15:40.774 position:50% align:center
And body language will help
you express more emotion.

00:15:40.815 --> 00:15:43.109 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
Okay, I'll try it out.

00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:46.279 position:50% align:center
Line up! I've cooked us
something special.

00:15:46.321 --> 00:15:47.155 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
Huh?

00:15:47.197 --> 00:15:50.325 position:50% align:center
Great, another person here is
convinced that they're a chef.

00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:52.077 position:50% align:center
Please be anything but curry.

00:15:52.118 --> 00:15:53.370 position:50% align:center
What did you make?

00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:54.746 position:50% align:center
Onigiri?

00:15:54.788 --> 00:15:57.791 position:50% align:center
I figured you'd ask that.

00:15:57.832 --> 00:15:59.668 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I don't believe it.

00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:01.503 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Curry udon.

00:16:01.544 --> 00:16:02.796 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE]
I used last night's leftovers,

00:16:02.837 --> 00:16:05.382 position:50% align:center
so I can assure
you it's delicious.

00:16:05.423 --> 00:16:08.176 position:50% align:center
Food is food,
I'm sure we'll enjoy it.

00:16:08.218 --> 00:16:10.970 position:50% align:center
No onigiri, what misery.

00:16:11.012 --> 00:16:14.099 position:50% align:center
But look!
A triangular potato.

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:17.852 position:50% align:center
You're right! Just like
that lunch saved.

--[YUKI] Hey.
--Hm?

00:16:21.272 --> 00:16:22.941 position:50% align:center
We're not having
curry-flavored food

00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:24.567 position:50% align:center
the whole time
we're here, right?

00:16:24.609 --> 00:16:27.070 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI laughs] You're gonna
to have to wait and see.

00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:30.407 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
I got it. No point in dreaming.

00:16:30.448 --> 00:16:31.658 position:50% align:center
[IZUMI]
By the way,

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:35.078 position:50% align:center
this morning's rehearsal seemed
much better than the last one.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.622 position:50% align:center
Aw, jeez. That smug
expression on your face

00:16:37.664 --> 00:16:39.874 position:50% align:center
is seriously annoying.

00:16:39.916 --> 00:16:43.378 position:50% align:center
I'm guessing you had a chat
with our hack of a leader.

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.922 position:50% align:center
Is it that obvious?

00:16:45.964 --> 00:16:47.007 position:50% align:center
I didn't say this,

00:16:47.048 --> 00:16:50.010 position:50% align:center
but he does seem to have
a keen eye for direction.

00:16:50.051 --> 00:16:52.303 position:50% align:center
On the stage, at least.

00:16:52.345 --> 00:16:53.179 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:53.221 --> 00:16:55.306 position:50% align:center
Oh, never mind.

00:16:57.684 --> 00:17:00.311 position:50% align:center
Brutal, I am so beat again.

00:17:00.353 --> 00:17:01.771 position:50% align:center
[GROUP chattering]

00:17:01.813 --> 00:17:03.481 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE]
Good work, everyone!

00:17:03.523 --> 00:17:06.276 position:50% align:center
We should celebrate your
improvements, whatcha say?

00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:08.611 position:50% align:center
What's in the bags?

00:17:08.653 --> 00:17:10.697 position:50% align:center
[ISUKE]
Summer is for fireworks!

00:17:10.739 --> 00:17:14.075 position:50% align:center
Making memories is an
important part of camp!

00:17:14.117 --> 00:17:16.536 position:50% align:center
This'll be so fun! I can't wait!

00:17:16.578 --> 00:17:19.205 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I've never heard
of these things.

00:17:21.666 --> 00:17:23.376 position:50% align:center
[MUKU]
Here we go.

00:17:23.418 --> 00:17:26.254 position:50% align:center
Aw, yeah! I love me
some bottle rockets!

00:17:26.296 --> 00:17:27.464 position:50% align:center
What are those?

00:17:27.505 --> 00:17:29.049 position:50% align:center
[MUKU] Why does it seem
like you've never shot

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.425 position:50% align:center
fireworks before?

00:17:30.467 --> 00:17:33.803 position:50% align:center
Well, I did hold sparklers for
a photo shoot back in the day.

00:17:33.845 --> 00:17:36.514 position:50% align:center
Ugh. You've lived
such a different life

00:17:36.556 --> 00:17:37.557 position:50% align:center
than the rest of us.

00:17:37.599 --> 00:17:40.685 position:50% align:center
Me and an actress around my age
were both wearing yukata.

00:17:40.727 --> 00:17:42.645 position:50% align:center
I don't need the details.

00:17:42.687 --> 00:17:46.149 position:50% align:center
Wow. It's like a scene
from a shojo manga!

00:17:46.191 --> 00:17:48.818 position:50% align:center
Your life sounds so amazing!

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.654 position:50% align:center
You for real?
Look, I'm not gonna lie.

00:17:51.696 --> 00:17:54.574 position:50% align:center
The sparklers were
sort of a letdown.

00:17:54.616 --> 00:17:56.993 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI] You're in luck.
Bottle rockets explode.

00:17:57.035 --> 00:17:59.996 position:50% align:center
I'm talking boom!
Here, take one.

00:18:00.038 --> 00:18:01.039 position:50% align:center
They what?

00:18:01.081 --> 00:18:04.376 position:50% align:center
Yep. The firework goes
off and explodes.

00:18:04.417 --> 00:18:06.378 position:50% align:center
Usually right in
front of your face.

00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:08.296 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
That's sounds so dangerous!

00:18:08.338 --> 00:18:11.716 position:50% align:center
Firecracker alert!
This is a firecracker alert!

00:18:11.758 --> 00:18:14.010 position:50% align:center
Hey. Don't scare him
like that, you guys.

00:18:14.052 --> 00:18:16.346 position:50% align:center
All righty, let's light 'em up!

00:18:16.388 --> 00:18:17.847 position:50% align:center
Wait. Hold on a second!

00:18:17.889 --> 00:18:21.476 position:50% align:center
--And 3... 2... 1...
--I gotta put my helmet on!

00:18:21.518 --> 00:18:22.435 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Go!

00:18:22.477 --> 00:18:25.021 position:50% align:center
--Tenma--
--Watch out! Get down!

00:18:30.902 --> 00:18:32.195 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:18:32.237 --> 00:18:33.571 position:50% align:center
What the--?

00:18:33.613 --> 00:18:34.614 position:50% align:center
[MUKU laughs]

00:18:34.656 --> 00:18:35.907 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:18:35.949 --> 00:18:36.991 position:50% align:center
Oops. Sorry.

00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:39.494 position:50% align:center
I was just joking
about the explosions.

00:18:39.536 --> 00:18:42.330 position:50% align:center
You believed him!

00:18:42.372 --> 00:18:45.125 position:50% align:center
Huh? You morons.

00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:48.044 position:50% align:center
Sorry, dude.

00:18:48.086 --> 00:18:49.129 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:53.091 position:50% align:center

00:18:53.133 --> 00:18:54.676 position:50% align:center

So fun!

00:18:54.718 --> 00:18:58.388 position:50% align:center
[laughing continues]

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:00.682 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI]
Let's do more!

00:19:00.724 --> 00:19:03.977 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Miyoshi.

00:19:04.019 --> 00:19:08.523 position:50% align:center
I apologize. Seriously.
I'm so sorry.

00:19:08.565 --> 00:19:09.733 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:09.774 --> 00:19:10.859 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
About time.

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.820 position:50% align:center
Our arrogant leader shows
he's human after all.

00:19:13.862 --> 00:19:14.946 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:14.988 --> 00:19:16.406 position:50% align:center
Tenten, it's no biggie!

00:19:16.448 --> 00:19:21.369 position:50% align:center
I pranked you, so...
why don't we just call it even?

00:19:21.411 --> 00:19:24.289 position:50% align:center
Hey, what are you two
talking about over here?

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:28.501 position:50% align:center
Nothing. Now,
let's really celebrate.

00:19:31.129 --> 00:19:34.215 position:50% align:center
[MISUMI, KAZUNARI]
That's for the Summer Troupe!

00:19:34.257 --> 00:19:37.218 position:50% align:center
So, then, I guess they're
normal fireworks.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:38.970 position:50% align:center
Yeah, obviously.

00:19:39.012 --> 00:19:42.349 position:50% align:center
C'mon. We've got a lot
to burn through!

00:19:51.066 --> 00:19:53.610 position:50% align:center
Look over here!
A pretty triangle!

00:19:53.651 --> 00:19:57.405 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI] Pure genius, Sumi!
Do you mind if I post it?

00:20:01.701 --> 00:20:02.535 position:50% align:center
You know what?

00:20:02.577 --> 00:20:04.662 position:50% align:center
This is starting to
feel like a school trip.

00:20:04.704 --> 00:20:06.331 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Yeah, I guess...

00:20:06.373 --> 00:20:08.625 position:50% align:center
I mean, I've never
actually gone on one.

00:20:08.667 --> 00:20:10.210 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
What? You're kidding.

00:20:10.251 --> 00:20:11.586 position:50% align:center
[TENMA]
Showbiz kept me busy,

00:20:11.628 --> 00:20:15.131 position:50% align:center
so I skipped the normal
events most kids went to.

00:20:15.173 --> 00:20:17.759 position:50% align:center
Makes sense.
That's the celeb life.

00:20:17.801 --> 00:20:19.636 position:50% align:center
It is a little sad, though.

00:20:19.678 --> 00:20:21.930 position:50% align:center
I've never gone on a
school trip, either.

00:20:21.971 --> 00:20:25.767 position:50% align:center
I had no money and nobody
hanging around to pay for it.

00:20:25.809 --> 00:20:28.019 position:50% align:center
[YUKI] Misumi, I know you've
been living at the dorm

00:20:28.061 --> 00:20:31.147 position:50% align:center
for a while, but...
Do you ever go home?

00:20:31.189 --> 00:20:33.358 position:50% align:center
Nope, can't say that I do.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.776 position:50% align:center
Uh?

00:20:34.818 --> 00:20:37.487 position:50% align:center
Right. Let's make a ton of
memories while we're here.

00:20:37.529 --> 00:20:39.322 position:50% align:center
It'll be like these two
never missed out.

00:20:39.364 --> 00:20:40.156 position:50% align:center
Hang on!

00:20:40.198 --> 00:20:42.117 position:50% align:center
What's wrong, my man,
we're all buddies here!

00:20:42.158 --> 00:20:44.661 position:50% align:center
So, let's all just pretend
it's a school trip!

00:20:44.703 --> 00:20:48.331 position:50% align:center
Kaz and Tenma! I'm so glad
that you're my buddies.

00:20:48.373 --> 00:20:50.500 position:50% align:center
Uh, don't get ahead of yourself.

00:20:50.542 --> 00:20:52.669 position:50% align:center
We're just in the
same theater troupe.

00:20:52.711 --> 00:20:55.171 position:50% align:center
I dunno that I'd
call us friends.

00:20:55.213 --> 00:20:56.214 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI]
Ta-da!

00:20:56.256 --> 00:20:58.258 position:50% align:center
These'll be the proof
of our friendship!

00:20:58.299 --> 00:21:00.135 position:50% align:center
Oh cool. A ground spinner.

00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:01.386 position:50% align:center
Is that lame, too?

00:21:01.428 --> 00:21:04.014 position:50% align:center
Actually, it sends sparks
flying around your feet

00:21:04.055 --> 00:21:07.017 position:50% align:center
like you've just walked into a
bunch of downed power lines.

00:21:07.058 --> 00:21:09.519 position:50% align:center
Sure, you guys aren't
gonna trick me again.

00:21:09.561 --> 00:21:12.897 position:50% align:center
It's a special event so...
I'll just light... 10...

00:21:12.939 --> 00:21:15.233 position:50% align:center
--[ALL gasp]
--[YUKI] Shoot! Take cover!

00:21:15.275 --> 00:21:19.070 position:50% align:center
--[KAZUNARI] 3... 2... 1...
--Yeah, yeah, yeah nice try.

00:21:19.112 --> 00:21:21.197 position:50% align:center
...go!

00:21:24.075 --> 00:21:27.162 position:50% align:center
[TENMA gasps, screams]

00:21:27.203 --> 00:21:29.080 position:50% align:center
Can't say we didn't warn him.

00:21:29.122 --> 00:21:30.707 position:50% align:center
--[fireworks popping]
--[screaming continues]

00:21:30.749 --> 00:21:34.377 position:50% align:center
Dammit. I could have
died! What the hell?

00:21:34.419 --> 00:21:35.795 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laughing]

00:21:35.837 --> 00:21:36.671 position:50% align:center
That was sick!

00:21:36.713 --> 00:21:38.882 position:50% align:center
--I hope he's okay!
--So pretty!

00:21:38.923 --> 00:21:39.966 position:50% align:center
[YUKI]
Sorry, can't help you!

00:21:40.008 --> 00:21:42.552 position:50% align:center
[KAZUNARI] Calm down, Tenten,
it's almost over!

00:23:33.621 --> 00:23:37.417 position:50% align:center
[snoring]
