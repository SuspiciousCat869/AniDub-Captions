00:01:48,967 --> 00:01:50,834
[sigh]

4
00:01:50,867 --> 00:01:52,434
-What's the matter,
Master Jaken?

5
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:53,234
-What's the matter?

6
00:01:53,267 --> 00:01:54,534
Do you not sense anything?

7
00:01:57,501 --> 00:02:01,101
It is true that Tenseiga's Meido
expanded considerably after

8
00:02:01,134 --> 00:02:04,167
that incident in the underworld,
but it still cannot form

9
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:07,434
a complete circle.

10
00:02:07,467 --> 00:02:10,067
I suspect that is why
Lord Sesshomaru has

11
00:02:10,101 --> 00:02:12,934
been impatient and
ill-tempered since.

12
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:15,101
I'm scared.

13
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:18,767
-Lord Sesshomaru,
do you wish to know

14
00:02:18,801 --> 00:02:20,734
the secret behind your sword?

15
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:23,334
Do you wish to know what
Tenseiga is lacking?

16
00:02:23,367 --> 00:02:23,834
-What?

17
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:31,234
-You're going to tell me
what Tenseiga is lacking.

18
00:02:31,267 --> 00:02:32,267
Really?

19
00:02:32,301 --> 00:02:33,201
-Yes.

20
00:02:33,234 --> 00:02:35,734
I'm sure it must
trouble you greatly.

21
00:02:35,767 --> 00:02:37,934
The fact that
Tenseiga's Meido has yet

22
00:02:37,967 --> 00:02:40,567
to achieve a complete circle.

23
00:02:40,601 --> 00:02:41,434
-How dare you?

24
00:02:41,467 --> 00:02:43,801
How do you even know about that?

25
00:02:43,834 --> 00:02:45,034
-Silence, Jaken.

26
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:45,534
-Who?

27
00:02:45,567 --> 00:02:46,801
Me?

28
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,567
But I didn't say
a word, my lord.

29
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:50,567
-Why do you always lie
like that, Master Jaken?

30
00:02:56,267 --> 00:02:58,034
-If you wish to
know more, then I

31
00:02:58,067 --> 00:03:01,834
suggest you follow
me Lord Sesshomaru.

32
00:03:01,867 --> 00:03:02,801
-Lord Sesshomaru.

33
00:03:06,767 --> 00:03:14,734
INUYASHA: "A Complete Meido."

34
00:03:14,767 --> 00:03:15,567
-This way.

35
00:03:15,601 --> 00:03:17,567
I sense a Shikon jewel shard.

36
00:03:17,601 --> 00:03:18,367
It's Kohaku.

37
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:20,467
-I can smell Sesshomaru too.

38
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:23,301
I guess the two of them
must be working together.

39
00:03:23,334 --> 00:03:26,001
-That does make it harder
for Naraku to reach him.

40
00:03:26,034 --> 00:03:28,867
A very wise decision.

41
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:29,367
-Kohaku.

42
00:03:36,434 --> 00:03:38,701
-Lord Sesshomaru,
are you acquainted

43
00:03:38,734 --> 00:03:40,934
with this odd child
we're following?

44
00:03:40,967 --> 00:03:42,634
-No.

45
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:45,801
-Well then, might this not
be a trap of some kind?

46
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:46,901
-A trap?

47
00:03:46,934 --> 00:03:48,934
-I don't know, promising
to reveal something

48
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:50,634
that Tenseiga lacks
and then leading

49
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:52,701
Lord Sesshomaru to his death.

50
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:55,567
-In that case, I'll
have to kill him.

51
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:57,901
-Huh?

52
00:03:57,934 --> 00:04:00,434
KOHAKU: The child disappeared.

53
00:04:00,467 --> 00:04:01,267
[blast]

54
00:04:01,301 --> 00:04:01,767
-Hm.

55
00:04:10,134 --> 00:04:12,034
-There you are.

56
00:04:12,067 --> 00:04:13,001
Meido Zangetsuha!

57
00:04:16,501 --> 00:04:19,934
-Master Jaken, grab this.

58
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:21,934
-Did I not just say
it might be a trap?

59
00:04:21,967 --> 00:04:23,434
-You're still
alive, Master Jaken.

60
00:04:23,467 --> 00:04:24,934
-Are you disappointed?

61
00:04:24,967 --> 00:04:25,967
Did you want me to die?

62
00:04:29,801 --> 00:04:32,734
-I see you deliberately
aimed at my footing.

63
00:04:32,767 --> 00:04:35,434
Are you so desperate to learn
the secret behind Tenseiga

64
00:04:35,467 --> 00:04:38,901
that you would knowingly
walk into a trap, Sesshomaru?

65
00:04:38,934 --> 00:04:42,367
-Just who do you think you are?

66
00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:44,334
-I do not care who you are.

67
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,101
Now, tell me why do you
know about Tenseiga?

68
00:04:47,134 --> 00:04:51,967
-Because once, long ago,
I faced it in battle.

69
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:55,534
Although, it looked nothing like
it does now, nothing at all.

70
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:57,101
When I fought
against your father,

71
00:04:57,134 --> 00:04:58,967
the sword was in
a different form.

72
00:04:59,001 --> 00:05:00,534
SESSHOMARU (VOICEOVER):
Against father?

73
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:02,567
-How dare you make
yourself look so young.

74
00:05:02,601 --> 00:05:04,867
SESSHOMARU (VOICEOVER): The
sword had a different form.

75
00:05:09,467 --> 00:05:11,267
-Your tactics amuse me.

76
00:05:11,301 --> 00:05:13,801
You fight without your sword
in order to learn its secret.

77
00:05:13,834 --> 00:05:16,267
You underestimate
me, a deadly mistake.

78
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:22,467
SESSHOMARU
(VOICEOVER): The Meido.

79
00:05:26,267 --> 00:05:27,067
-How did he--

80
00:05:27,101 --> 00:05:28,867
-Meido Zangetsuha.

81
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:31,834
Not bad, but Lord
Sesshomaru's is bigger.

82
00:05:31,867 --> 00:05:36,101
-True, but that Meido
was a complete circle.

83
00:05:36,134 --> 00:05:38,467
-I'll have you know Meido
Zangetsuha was originally

84
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:39,801
my technique.

85
00:05:39,834 --> 00:05:40,934
That's right.

86
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:43,967
It was mine until your
father stole it from me.

87
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:48,134
He took it along with my face.

88
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:50,267
-From what I've
heard thus far, you

89
00:05:50,301 --> 00:05:52,901
summoned me here not
to reveal a secret,

90
00:05:52,934 --> 00:05:55,567
but to whine about your
technique being stolen

91
00:05:55,601 --> 00:05:57,801
and your face being destroyed.

92
00:05:57,834 --> 00:06:00,901
-Only one practitioner is
needed for each technique,

93
00:06:00,934 --> 00:06:04,367
especially considering Tenseiga
is an incomplete blade.

94
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:05,901
SESSHOMARU (VOICEOVER):
Incomplete?

95
00:06:05,934 --> 00:06:06,534
-Look out.

96
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:07,067
-Lord Sesshomaru!

97
00:06:11,101 --> 00:06:13,534
-Well, what is this secret?

98
00:06:13,567 --> 00:06:17,434
-Still curious-- even as
you approach your death?

99
00:06:17,467 --> 00:06:21,401
-Very well, it appears you have
no intention of answering me.

100
00:06:21,434 --> 00:06:23,467
In which case, you
are no longer needed.

101
00:06:27,767 --> 00:06:32,201
-Sesshomaru, your Meido is
needlessly large and malformed.

102
00:06:32,234 --> 00:06:35,367
You will never be able to create
a complete Meido like I can.

103
00:06:43,834 --> 00:06:44,967
-What?

104
00:06:45,001 --> 00:06:46,967
-His Meido just absorbed
Lord Sesshomaru's Meido

105
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:49,401
like it was nothing.

106
00:06:49,434 --> 00:06:50,834
-Sesshomaru.

107
00:06:50,867 --> 00:06:52,201
SESSHOMARU
(VOICEOVER): InuYasha.

108
00:06:56,434 --> 00:06:58,134
-Kohaku.

109
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:58,634
-Sister.

110
00:07:04,734 --> 00:07:06,567
-Could it be?

111
00:07:06,601 --> 00:07:07,934
-Shishinki.

112
00:07:07,967 --> 00:07:08,934
-What is it, Myoga?

113
00:07:08,967 --> 00:07:09,567
-Huh?

114
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:10,601
You're still here?

115
00:07:10,634 --> 00:07:11,634
-What did you say, Myoga?

116
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:13,967
You know the guy
Sesshomaru's fighting?

117
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:15,034
-I do.

118
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:17,401
He's known as Shishinki,
the Ogre of Death.

119
00:07:17,434 --> 00:07:19,567
He's a demon who was
defeated by your father

120
00:07:19,601 --> 00:07:21,067
many, many years ago.

121
00:07:21,101 --> 00:07:23,467
He was a fierce
opponent as I recall.

122
00:07:23,501 --> 00:07:24,567
It's impossible.

123
00:07:24,601 --> 00:07:26,267
How is he still alive?

124
00:07:26,301 --> 00:07:28,101
Oh dear, this isn't good at all.

125
00:07:28,134 --> 00:07:30,467
If Lord Sesshomaru learns
the secret behind Tenseiga

126
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:33,234
there's no telling
what he'll do.

127
00:07:33,267 --> 00:07:35,367
-Is that the old flea, Myoga?

128
00:07:35,401 --> 00:07:38,001
I wasn't sure until now,
but if you're here too,

129
00:07:38,034 --> 00:07:40,167
there can be no mistake.

130
00:07:40,201 --> 00:07:41,234
-That is Meido Zangetsuha.

131
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:47,101
-That's it.

132
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,101
You're going to
regret doing that.

133
00:07:49,134 --> 00:07:49,967
Wind Scar!

134
00:07:57,401 --> 00:08:00,534
-So it is Tessaiga.

135
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:03,934
I heard that he had two
sons, and now here you are.

136
00:08:03,967 --> 00:08:07,334
The old man gave Tessaiga
to his youngest, did he?

137
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:09,934
-Hey, Sesshomaru, what
the hell's going on here?

138
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:12,567
Why are you fighting
with this guy?

139
00:08:12,601 --> 00:08:15,501
-Sesshomaru, do you
not find it strange?

140
00:08:15,534 --> 00:08:18,634
Shouldn't the elder brother
have received Tessaiga.

141
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:22,667
Now, why do you suppose your
father left it to him instead?

142
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:25,034
-Such cruelty, bringing
up the one thing that

143
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:26,767
has tortured Lord Sesshomaru.

144
00:08:26,801 --> 00:08:30,367
He has tried to take Tessaiga
many times without success.

145
00:08:30,401 --> 00:08:32,734
He even sacrificed his arm.

146
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:36,134
He'd finally given up and begun
focusing on training Tenseiga.

147
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:38,701
And now this.

148
00:08:38,734 --> 00:08:41,434
-Master Jaken, your explanation
makes perfect sense.

149
00:08:41,467 --> 00:08:43,334
-But if Lord
Sesshomaru heard it,

150
00:08:43,367 --> 00:08:46,967
he would make you suffer
just for saying it out loud.

151
00:08:47,001 --> 00:08:50,501
-Shishinki, you summoned me
here to fight, did you not?

152
00:08:50,534 --> 00:08:52,067
Then what are you waiting for?

153
00:08:52,101 --> 00:08:54,067
There is no need for
all this idle chatter.

154
00:08:58,901 --> 00:09:00,434
-Sesshomaru's using it too.

155
00:09:00,467 --> 00:09:02,334
-And look, his is way bigger.

156
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:03,167
-Bigger, yes.

157
00:09:03,201 --> 00:09:05,067
But his technique is incomplete.

158
00:09:05,101 --> 00:09:08,401
-Uh, Myoga, weren't you just
with InuYasha, a minute ago?

159
00:09:08,434 --> 00:09:09,267
-He ditched him.

160
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:17,101
-Sesshomaru, what do
you know of your sword?

161
00:09:17,134 --> 00:09:20,034
Do you have any idea
how Tenseiga was born?

162
00:09:20,067 --> 00:09:23,401
As I said, Tenseiga was
nothing like it is now.

163
00:09:23,434 --> 00:09:26,934
It was in a different form
back when I fought your father.

164
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:31,001
The truth is Tenseiga didn't
actually exist at the time.

165
00:09:31,034 --> 00:09:33,834
The sword I fought against
was none other than Tessaiga.

166
00:09:33,867 --> 00:09:34,801
I

167
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:36,101
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER):
Is he saying

168
00:09:36,134 --> 00:09:38,067
that Tessaiga was the one
that stole Meido Zangetsuha?

169
00:09:42,067 --> 00:09:44,567
-So you didn't know, Sesshomaru.

170
00:09:44,601 --> 00:09:47,334
Well, let's see how
should I say this?

171
00:09:47,367 --> 00:09:48,767
Tenseiga was
originally Tessaiga.

172
00:09:48,801 --> 00:09:49,267
-Silence!

173
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:02,867
-Now then, I presume
the old man was

174
00:10:02,901 --> 00:10:05,501
unable to control Meido
Zangetsuha after stealing it

175
00:10:05,534 --> 00:10:07,601
from me, its rightful owner.

176
00:10:07,634 --> 00:10:08,301
-Wow.

177
00:10:08,334 --> 00:10:09,601
Is all that true, Myoga?

178
00:10:09,634 --> 00:10:10,201
-Yes.

179
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:10,867
Yes.

180
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:11,867
Yes.

181
00:10:11,901 --> 00:10:13,501
It is true that my
Lord was pondering

182
00:10:13,534 --> 00:10:16,167
how to use this technique
once he'd acquired it.

183
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:19,501
-That is why he cast
away from Tessaiga.

184
00:10:19,534 --> 00:10:23,267
And so that unwanted technique,
the one Tessaiga had no use for

185
00:10:23,301 --> 00:10:25,701
was given to your
Tenseiga instead.

186
00:10:25,734 --> 00:10:28,134
SESSHOMARU (VOICEOVER):
Unwanted technique.

187
00:10:28,167 --> 00:10:30,834
-So Tenseiga was cast
off from Tessaiga.

188
00:10:30,867 --> 00:10:33,001
-If that's true, it would
mean the two of them

189
00:10:33,034 --> 00:10:34,934
were originally one sword.

190
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,167
SESSHOMARU (VOICEOVER): Why?

191
00:10:36,201 --> 00:10:38,867
Why did father do this?

192
00:10:38,901 --> 00:10:40,901
-And on top of that,
if I'm not mistaken,

193
00:10:40,934 --> 00:10:43,534
the younger brother
smells part human.

194
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:45,001
It seems unthinkable.

195
00:10:45,034 --> 00:10:47,801
Why would the old man bequeath
Tessaiga, his original sword,

196
00:10:47,834 --> 00:10:51,701
to a mere half-demon?

197
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,901
Poor Sesshomaru, it looks
like your father passed you

198
00:10:54,934 --> 00:10:57,935
by in favour of your
younger brother.

199
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,875
SESSHOMARU (VOICEOVER): Why?

200
00:11:09,908 --> 00:11:13,709
Tessaiga's barrier rejects
me from even touching it.

201
00:11:19,976 --> 00:11:21,343
-All right.

202
00:11:21,376 --> 00:11:22,876
[growling]

203
00:11:28,109 --> 00:11:28,576
-Tessaiga.

204
00:11:37,576 --> 00:11:38,376
Take this!

205
00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:57,509
-First, I was given
Tenseiga, a sword meant

206
00:11:57,543 --> 00:11:59,076
for healing instead of fighting.

207
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:06,443
Now, I find out the
technique I finally learn,

208
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:10,843
Meido Zangetsuha, was the one
Tessaiga no longer needed.

209
00:12:10,876 --> 00:12:12,076
Why, father?

210
00:12:12,109 --> 00:12:15,509
Why would you treat me this way?

211
00:12:15,543 --> 00:12:17,576
SHISHINKI: Do you
understand now?

212
00:12:17,609 --> 00:12:19,143
Tenseiga is an incomplete sword.

213
00:12:19,176 --> 00:12:21,576
It cannot perform my technique.

214
00:12:21,609 --> 00:12:24,376
What you wield is just
a part of Tessaiga.

215
00:12:24,409 --> 00:12:27,909
As such, it will never be able
to perform a complete Meido.

216
00:12:27,943 --> 00:12:31,576
No amount of training
will change that.

217
00:12:31,609 --> 00:12:33,509
-Look out, Lord Sesshomaru!

218
00:12:33,543 --> 00:12:34,209
-Wind Scar.

219
00:12:42,143 --> 00:12:43,076
[growl]

220
00:12:46,309 --> 00:12:50,043
-So half-demon, trying to help
your older brother, are you?

221
00:12:50,076 --> 00:12:51,909
Well, there's no need
to rush into battle.

222
00:12:51,943 --> 00:12:54,476
I shall deal with you once
I've buried Sesshomaru.

223
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:55,343
-Shut up!

224
00:12:58,176 --> 00:13:00,476
What the hell was that for, huh?

225
00:13:00,509 --> 00:13:02,943
-Do not interfere.

226
00:13:02,976 --> 00:13:04,276
-What's his problem?

227
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:06,576
-Well, if everything that
was just said is true,

228
00:13:06,609 --> 00:13:09,009
that's a lot for
one man to bear.

229
00:13:09,043 --> 00:13:11,409
-You can't blame
Sesshomaru for being angry.

230
00:13:11,443 --> 00:13:13,809
-Still, if the technique
was unwanted like this guy

231
00:13:13,843 --> 00:13:16,776
says, then why not just
get rid of it for good?

232
00:13:16,809 --> 00:13:19,143
Instead, their father chose
to leave it in Tenseiga

233
00:13:19,176 --> 00:13:21,643
and entrust
Sesshomaru with that.

234
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:23,609
MYOGA (VOICEOVER):
That he did, Kogame.

235
00:13:23,643 --> 00:13:26,209
But if Lord Sesshomaru were
ever to learn the reason why

236
00:13:26,243 --> 00:13:28,043
my lord left him
with Tenseiga, I

237
00:13:28,076 --> 00:13:30,009
fear he would not be
able to accept it,

238
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:32,143
especially not in his
current state of mind.

239
00:13:35,443 --> 00:13:38,076
-To the underworld with you.

240
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:40,409
-Shishinki's Meido is
powerful but small.

241
00:13:40,443 --> 00:13:43,543
He just has to avoid it.

242
00:13:43,576 --> 00:13:45,943
-How long can you keep this up?

243
00:13:45,976 --> 00:13:47,909
-He can fire a bunch
of those at once?

244
00:13:50,909 --> 00:13:52,343
-Stop it, Sesshomaru.

245
00:13:52,376 --> 00:13:55,909
Even you won't be able
to dodge all of those.

246
00:13:55,943 --> 00:13:57,443
-It would appear
that despair has

247
00:13:57,476 --> 00:13:59,809
clouded your
judgment, Sesshomaru.

248
00:13:59,843 --> 00:14:03,643
Well, that works for me.

249
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,809
-Lord Sesshomaru!

250
00:14:06,843 --> 00:14:08,776
KOHAKU: We have to move
away or we'll get hit.

251
00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:13,443
-You fool.

252
00:14:13,476 --> 00:14:15,776
You think you can defeat
me with only your claws?

253
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:20,576
-He's doing a good
job of dodging them.

254
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:23,009
-But his movements are
becoming predictable.

255
00:14:23,043 --> 00:14:25,743
-It's only a matter of time
before one of those hits him.

256
00:14:25,776 --> 00:14:27,209
-Plus, it looks
like all that stuff

257
00:14:27,243 --> 00:14:29,376
Shishinki said about his
father is getting to him.

258
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:31,543
He's not thinking
clearly right now.

259
00:14:31,576 --> 00:14:33,876
-I must tell him what my
lord really had in mind.

260
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:35,943
It's only right that he know.

261
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:39,009
Ah, but sadly, I lack
the means to approach.

262
00:14:39,043 --> 00:14:40,609
Could it be the end for him?

263
00:14:40,643 --> 00:14:42,676
-I can help with that.

264
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:43,676
Now, you have the means.

265
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:44,276
See ya.

266
00:14:44,309 --> 00:14:47,476
-I don't want to.

267
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:48,476
-Ha.

268
00:14:48,509 --> 00:14:50,109
At least, you're
good at running away.

269
00:14:50,143 --> 00:14:51,376
-You are wrong.

270
00:14:51,409 --> 00:14:54,443
I have no intention of running
away from scum like you.

271
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:55,743
MYOGA: Lord Sesshomaru, please.

272
00:14:55,776 --> 00:14:57,843
You must listen to
what I have to say.

273
00:14:57,876 --> 00:15:00,909
I came over, because I couldn't
stay silent any longer.

274
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:01,976
-Oh.

275
00:15:02,009 --> 00:15:04,243
-Lord Sesshomaru, you
were not slighted.

276
00:15:04,276 --> 00:15:06,943
On the contrary, your father
bequeathed Tenseiga to you

277
00:15:06,976 --> 00:15:08,243
because of who you are.

278
00:15:08,276 --> 00:15:10,576
Meido Zangetsuha is
a fearsome attack

279
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:13,243
which sends one's foes
directly to the underworld.

280
00:15:13,276 --> 00:15:16,143
It is not a technique
that just anyone can use.

281
00:15:16,176 --> 00:15:17,409
-That is quite true.

282
00:15:17,443 --> 00:15:18,876
Your half-demon
brother wouldn't be

283
00:15:18,909 --> 00:15:22,009
able to endure the demonic
energy from the underworld.

284
00:15:22,043 --> 00:15:23,009
-Hm.

285
00:15:23,043 --> 00:15:24,343
-Knowing that you
were a true demon,

286
00:15:24,376 --> 00:15:26,843
your father was betting on
your strength, Lord Sesshomaru.

287
00:15:26,876 --> 00:15:28,676
You see he believed that
you would eventually

288
00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:31,576
master Meido Zangetsuha
and be able to use Tenseiga

289
00:15:31,609 --> 00:15:33,043
as it was intended to be used.

290
00:15:33,076 --> 00:15:34,443
It was for that--

291
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:36,476
-And you would have me believe
that was his reason for casting

292
00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:39,843
Tenseiga off of
Tessaiga, would you?

293
00:15:39,876 --> 00:15:41,643
-Huh?

294
00:15:41,676 --> 00:15:43,176
-That is a good question.

295
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:46,409
If his faith in Sesshomaru
was so great could he not have

296
00:15:46,443 --> 00:15:50,243
bequeathed Tessaiga to him
along with Meido Zangetsuha.

297
00:15:50,276 --> 00:15:52,209
He certainly could
have if he thought

298
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,376
that you were promising enough.

299
00:15:54,409 --> 00:15:57,276
-Well, you do have
a point there.

300
00:15:57,309 --> 00:16:00,143
-Hey, you can't let
him win the argument.

301
00:16:00,176 --> 00:16:03,176
-Frankly, now even I'm
starting to feel sorry for him.

302
00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:04,276
SESSHOMARU: Silence, Myoga.

303
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:09,509
There is no longer
anything to discuss.

304
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,943
-Lord Sesshomaru.

305
00:16:18,976 --> 00:16:19,643
-Ha.

306
00:16:19,676 --> 00:16:21,309
He's only got one arm.

307
00:16:21,343 --> 00:16:23,409
SESSHOMARU (VOICEOVER): I
already lost my left arm

308
00:16:23,443 --> 00:16:28,476
to Tessaiga, the sword that
my father left to InuYasha.

309
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:35,309
However, I am not
one to hold a grudge.

310
00:16:35,343 --> 00:16:38,509
After all, it happened
in the heat of battle.

311
00:16:41,176 --> 00:16:43,543
-How dare you hit my face?

312
00:16:43,576 --> 00:16:46,443
-The secret behind
Tenseiga, it is not

313
00:16:46,476 --> 00:16:48,209
meant to be uttered
by a mouth as wretched

314
00:16:48,243 --> 00:16:50,109
and twisted as yours.

315
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:54,143
Every word you speak
brings shame to it.

316
00:16:54,176 --> 00:16:56,343
-Silence, you insolent brat.

317
00:16:56,376 --> 00:17:00,509
I will make you regret damaging
my face, as your father did.

318
00:17:00,543 --> 00:17:02,043
-Sesshomaru!

319
00:17:02,076 --> 00:17:03,676
-I told you not to interfere.

320
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:07,009
-I don't care.

321
00:17:07,043 --> 00:17:07,976
-Adamant Barrage!

322
00:17:15,343 --> 00:17:16,776
-Tenseiga?

323
00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:17,276
-Tessaiga?

324
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:22,776
Sesshomaru, you
should draw Tenseiga.

325
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:23,476
Try it.

326
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:24,543
Something might happen.

327
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,109
SESSHOMARU (VOICEOVER):
What do you want?

328
00:17:26,143 --> 00:17:28,943
Are you telling me to
fight alongside Tessaiga?

329
00:17:28,976 --> 00:17:32,043
Worse yet, are you telling
me to help Tessaiga,

330
00:17:32,076 --> 00:17:32,743
to help InuYasha.

331
00:17:35,543 --> 00:17:37,943
-There's nowhere
for you to run now.

332
00:17:37,976 --> 00:17:40,709
Prepare to be banished
to the underworld.

333
00:17:40,743 --> 00:17:43,509
SESSHOMARU (VOICEOVER): Tenseiga
was only cast off Tessaiga

334
00:17:43,543 --> 00:17:45,343
to be rid of Meido Zangetsuha.

335
00:17:45,376 --> 00:17:49,076
Now, after inheriting this
unwanted sword from my father,

336
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:52,443
I'm supposed to use
it to aid InuYasha.

337
00:17:52,476 --> 00:17:54,243
-Are you ready for it?

338
00:17:54,276 --> 00:17:55,943
Now, you and your
father's swords

339
00:17:55,976 --> 00:17:59,209
shall spend the rest of
eternity in the underworld.

340
00:17:59,243 --> 00:18:00,576
-InuYasha!

341
00:18:00,609 --> 00:18:01,776
-There are so many.

342
00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:03,176
-They'll never make it.

343
00:18:03,209 --> 00:18:03,743
-No!

344
00:18:03,776 --> 00:18:05,409
Lord Sesshomaru!

345
00:18:05,443 --> 00:18:06,409
-Sesshomaru!

346
00:18:06,443 --> 00:18:07,776
SESSHOMARU (VOICEOVER):
I still do not

347
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:10,276
know what father was thinking
when he gave me Tenseiga.

348
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:13,609
Perhaps, I never will, but
I no longer care about that.

349
00:18:13,643 --> 00:18:15,276
Never, Shishinki.

350
00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:17,909
I would not allow my life to
be taken by scum like you.

351
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:29,243
-Lord Sesshomaru's
Meido Zangetsuha

352
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:30,943
has achieved a complete circle.

353
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:32,543
-It's swallowing
Shishinki's Meido.

354
00:18:39,776 --> 00:18:40,743
-It can't be.

355
00:18:40,776 --> 00:18:42,309
Tenseiga is supposed
to be incomplete.

356
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:51,876
Now, I see.

357
00:18:51,909 --> 00:18:54,043
I pity you, Sesshomaru.

358
00:18:54,076 --> 00:18:56,076
What your father did was cruel.

359
00:18:56,109 --> 00:18:57,276
It was cruel, you hear.

360
00:19:17,076 --> 00:19:17,876
-Wow.

361
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:19,443
-Such immense power.

362
00:19:19,476 --> 00:19:20,643
-Yeah, no kidding.

363
00:19:20,676 --> 00:19:22,709
I mean just look at this place.

364
00:19:22,743 --> 00:19:24,543
-Still that was too close.

365
00:19:24,576 --> 00:19:27,009
A moment later, and
InuYasha and Sesshomaru

366
00:19:27,043 --> 00:19:29,443
would have been banished
to the underworld forever.

367
00:19:29,476 --> 00:19:32,109
-Just witnessing it
took years off my life.

368
00:19:32,143 --> 00:19:33,376
-How did you get here?

369
00:19:33,409 --> 00:19:34,176
-What do you know?

370
00:19:34,209 --> 00:19:35,509
Myoga ended up somewhere safe.

371
00:19:35,543 --> 00:19:36,009
-Again.

372
00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:42,843
-Hey, uh, Sesshomaru.

373
00:19:42,876 --> 00:19:44,909
That thing you just did,
that was a complete Meido

374
00:19:44,943 --> 00:19:46,476
Zangetsuha, wasn't it?

375
00:19:50,576 --> 00:19:52,809
Wait up, Sesshomaru.

376
00:19:52,843 --> 00:19:55,343
This means you've
mastered Tenseiga now.

377
00:19:55,376 --> 00:19:56,709
I can assume that, right?

378
00:20:01,676 --> 00:20:02,876
Look.

379
00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:05,076
Father died before I was
old enough to remember him.

380
00:20:05,109 --> 00:20:07,509
I have no way of knowing what
he was thinking back then.

381
00:20:07,543 --> 00:20:11,276
But all of those things
that Shishinki was saying,

382
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:13,309
that Tenseiga was something
Tessaiga didn't need,

383
00:20:13,343 --> 00:20:16,043
that it's incomplete,
those were lies, right?

384
00:20:16,076 --> 00:20:18,443
I mean father left you
Tenseiga because he trusted you

385
00:20:18,476 --> 00:20:20,543
and because you
are a real demon.

386
00:20:20,576 --> 00:20:21,743
-InuYasha.

387
00:20:21,776 --> 00:20:24,076
-Why do you ask anyway?

388
00:20:24,109 --> 00:20:25,109
-Why?

389
00:20:25,143 --> 00:20:26,743
Because Sesshomaru,
I'm sick and tired

390
00:20:26,776 --> 00:20:29,776
of you giving me trouble
about this sword.

391
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:32,709
Let's just agree that Tenseiga
was your proper inheritance

392
00:20:32,743 --> 00:20:35,209
from father and let
that be the end of it.

393
00:20:35,243 --> 00:20:38,043
-InuYasha is showing his
respect for Tenseiga.

394
00:20:38,076 --> 00:20:40,609
-I think he's trying
to cheer up Sesshomaru.

395
00:20:40,643 --> 00:20:41,909
-I hope it works.

396
00:20:41,943 --> 00:20:45,043
-Can we agree, Sesshomaru?

397
00:20:45,076 --> 00:20:46,943
-InuYasha, are you blind?

398
00:20:46,976 --> 00:20:47,776
Can you not see it?

399
00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:48,809
-See what?

400
00:20:48,843 --> 00:20:50,309
SESSHOMARU (VOICEOVER):
Tenseiga was

401
00:20:50,343 --> 00:20:53,343
able to produce a complete
Meido only because Tessaiga

402
00:20:53,376 --> 00:20:54,609
was nearby.

403
00:20:54,643 --> 00:20:57,643
They responded to one
another, and that would only

404
00:20:57,676 --> 00:20:59,976
lead to conflict.

405
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,943
-What your father did was cruel.

406
00:21:01,976 --> 00:21:05,043
It was cruel, you hear.

407
00:21:05,076 --> 00:21:10,443
-InuYasha, like it
or not, you and I

408
00:21:10,476 --> 00:21:14,043
are destined to fight each
other until the day we die.

409
00:21:14,076 --> 00:21:15,143
Do not forget that.

410
00:21:18,376 --> 00:21:21,343
-Hey.

411
00:21:21,376 --> 00:21:24,643
-Please wait for
us, Lord Sesshomaru.

412
00:21:24,676 --> 00:21:28,643
-Kohaku, shouldn't you talk
to your sister before we go?

413
00:21:28,676 --> 00:21:29,743
-No.

414
00:21:29,776 --> 00:21:31,109
We should keep up
with Lord Sesshomaru.

415
00:21:36,843 --> 00:21:37,276
-Kohaku.

416
00:21:41,743 --> 00:21:44,143
-Let there be no mistake,
my lord entrusted

417
00:21:44,176 --> 00:21:47,743
Lord Sesshomaru with Tenseiga
because he trusted him.

418
00:21:47,776 --> 00:21:51,076
However, it would appear that
Lord Sesshomaru has finally

419
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:53,809
realized my lord's true
intention for doing so.

420
00:22:00,071 --> 00:22:01,405
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER):
Sesshomaru.

421
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:12,146
[theme music]

422
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,820
KAGOME: Sesshomaru decides
to pay a visit to Totosai

423
00:23:47,853 --> 00:23:50,553
after he realizes Tenseiga's
true hidden purpose.

424
00:23:50,587 --> 00:23:53,587
While he's away, Naraku
tries to make his move.

425
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,853
KOHAKU: Have you come for
my Shikon jewel shard.

426
00:23:55,887 --> 00:23:59,420
NARAKU: With your shard, the
Shikon jewel will be complete.

427
00:23:59,453 --> 00:24:02,587
I'm afraid there's nowhere
for you to run now.

428
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:05,253
INUYASHA: Next time, on
InuYasha The Final Act,

429
00:24:05,287 --> 00:24:06,587
"In Pursuit of Naraku."

430
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,920
-Silence, Naraku.

431
00:24:07,953 --> 00:24:10,487
I'm sick of listening
to your nonsense.
