[theme music]

3
00:01:46,627 --> 00:01:47,561
-(THINKING) Huh?

4
00:01:47,594 --> 00:01:50,794
What is this?

5
00:01:50,827 --> 00:01:52,127
GIRL: I'm there!

6
00:01:52,161 --> 00:01:53,327
-Me too!

7
00:01:53,361 --> 00:01:54,094
-Oh yeah.

8
00:01:54,127 --> 00:01:54,861
So is mine.

9
00:01:54,894 --> 00:01:57,061
-Kagome, what about yours?

10
00:01:57,094 --> 00:02:00,994
-Oh, (THINKING) that's right.

11
00:02:01,027 --> 00:02:02,161
I almost forgot.

12
00:02:02,194 --> 00:02:03,961
I made it through my exams.

13
00:02:03,994 --> 00:02:04,961
-Isn't it awesome?

14
00:02:04,994 --> 00:02:06,394
All of us passed.

15
00:02:06,427 --> 00:02:07,927
-What about you, Kagome?

16
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:14,194
-Oh, um-- huh?

17
00:02:14,227 --> 00:02:22,027
[nervous giggling]
It's not there.

18
00:02:22,061 --> 00:02:24,461
No way!

19
00:02:24,494 --> 00:02:26,427
I failed!

20
00:02:26,461 --> 00:02:28,127
No!

21
00:02:28,161 --> 00:02:31,761
[gasping] Huh?

22
00:02:31,794 --> 00:02:32,461
I failed?

23
00:02:32,494 --> 00:02:34,161
-What's wrong, Kagome?

24
00:02:34,194 --> 00:02:35,261
Are you still in pain?

25
00:02:35,294 --> 00:02:38,861
-But how'd I-- You
lost consciousness

26
00:02:38,894 --> 00:02:40,461
after Magatsuhi glared at you.

27
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:41,861
Do you remember what happened?

28
00:02:41,894 --> 00:02:47,194
-[gasp] (THINKING) That's right.

29
00:02:47,227 --> 00:02:48,494
I remember now.

30
00:02:48,527 --> 00:02:51,494
I suddenly felt weak.

31
00:02:51,527 --> 00:02:56,327
[gasp] Kohaku, how is he, Sango?

32
00:02:56,361 --> 00:03:00,827
-Well, he hasn't woken
up since it happened.

33
00:03:00,861 --> 00:03:03,927
-I'm sure it's because
Magatsuhi defiled his shard.

34
00:03:03,961 --> 00:03:05,494
Let me purify it.

35
00:03:05,527 --> 00:03:08,427
-But I still don't
understand why Magatsuhi

36
00:03:08,461 --> 00:03:11,227
was able to defile
Kohaku's shard.

37
00:03:11,261 --> 00:03:12,694
MALE SPEAKER:
Magatsuhi originates

38
00:03:12,727 --> 00:03:15,561
from the Shikon Jewel, which
contains a speck of light that

39
00:03:15,594 --> 00:03:17,661
was planted there by Lady Kikyo.

40
00:03:17,694 --> 00:03:20,361
When Naraku made contact
with Kohaku's shard,

41
00:03:20,394 --> 00:03:23,627
that speck of light produced an
intense purifying illumination,

42
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:27,394
which seemed to
cause him great pain.

43
00:03:27,427 --> 00:03:28,761
-Yeah, that's true.

44
00:03:28,794 --> 00:03:31,527
Magatsuhi comes from the Jewel,
and was using Naraku's body.

45
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:33,261
When he touched
Kohaku's shard, it

46
00:03:33,294 --> 00:03:34,727
should have had the same effect.

47
00:03:34,761 --> 00:03:37,761
-I would presume that the speck
of light, the purification

48
00:03:37,794 --> 00:03:42,061
spell planted by my sister is
only effective against Naraku.

49
00:03:42,094 --> 00:03:43,827
-What do you mean by that?

50
00:03:43,861 --> 00:03:46,727
The purification spell
was cast by my sister

51
00:03:46,761 --> 00:03:48,561
in her final moments.

52
00:03:48,594 --> 00:03:50,294
Naraku was her target.

53
00:03:50,327 --> 00:03:52,961
It only makes sense that the
spell would apply to him,

54
00:03:52,994 --> 00:03:55,194
and him alone.

55
00:03:55,227 --> 00:03:57,561
-So it can't hurt Magatsuhi.

56
00:03:57,594 --> 00:04:00,094
He's going to be quite
a challenging opponent.

57
00:04:00,127 --> 00:04:03,561
It's a shame we couldn't finish
him off before he escaped.

58
00:04:03,594 --> 00:04:05,161
-The next time
Magatsuhi shows up,

59
00:04:05,194 --> 00:04:06,861
I'm going to give him
a taste of Tessaiga.

60
00:04:10,794 --> 00:04:12,094
-How does it look?

61
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:13,861
Better?

62
00:04:13,894 --> 00:04:15,594
-What's going on?

63
00:04:15,627 --> 00:04:17,627
It's not working.

64
00:04:17,661 --> 00:04:19,327
I can't purify it.

65
00:04:19,361 --> 00:04:21,094
I--

66
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:22,761
-You, you can't?

67
00:04:22,794 --> 00:04:24,094
-Kagome?

68
00:04:24,127 --> 00:04:26,261
-I don't get it.

69
00:04:26,294 --> 00:04:28,194
I could do this before.

70
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:31,461
-If you can't what will happen?

71
00:04:31,494 --> 00:04:33,194
--[gasp] (THINKING)
Hold on a sec.

72
00:04:33,227 --> 00:04:36,727
Did Magatsuhi do this to me?

73
00:04:36,761 --> 00:04:42,027
-(THINKING) He did
something to Kagome's power.

74
00:04:42,061 --> 00:04:43,527
The day of days.

75
00:04:49,627 --> 00:04:52,961
-Honestly, how dare he bring
the mighty Lord Sesshomaru

76
00:04:52,994 --> 00:04:56,494
to a lowly human
village like this?

77
00:04:56,527 --> 00:04:58,427
-OK.

78
00:04:58,461 --> 00:05:00,294
All done.

79
00:05:00,327 --> 00:05:02,027
A scabbard for Bakusaiga.

80
00:05:12,461 --> 00:05:13,361
-Hold on.

81
00:05:13,394 --> 00:05:15,161
Please wait, Lord Sesshomaru.

82
00:05:15,194 --> 00:05:17,561
Kohaku still hasn't
woken up yet.

83
00:05:17,594 --> 00:05:19,061
If we wait a little longer I'm--

84
00:05:19,094 --> 00:05:21,194
-Kohaku stays behind.

85
00:05:21,227 --> 00:05:23,394
You too, you stay as well.

86
00:05:23,427 --> 00:05:24,327
-Huh?

87
00:05:24,361 --> 00:05:27,027
But, but why, Lord Sesshomaru?

88
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:28,961
-(THINKING) Kohaku I understand.

89
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:30,661
But he's leading Rin behind?

90
00:05:30,694 --> 00:05:32,061
Then again--

91
00:05:32,094 --> 00:05:33,961
-No, I want to go with you!

92
00:05:33,994 --> 00:05:36,227
-You are acting like
a spoiled brat, Rin.

93
00:05:36,261 --> 00:05:38,561
Lord Sesshomaru
is a born warrior.

94
00:05:38,594 --> 00:05:39,927
He lives to fight.

95
00:05:39,961 --> 00:05:41,927
It made no sense to
drag two kids around run

96
00:05:41,961 --> 00:05:43,227
with him in the first place.

97
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:44,661
It is simply not practical.

98
00:05:44,694 --> 00:05:47,461
-Jaken, you'll be
staying behind, too.

99
00:05:47,494 --> 00:05:48,661
-What?

100
00:05:48,694 --> 00:05:49,361
But you can't.

101
00:05:49,394 --> 00:05:51,494
Why, Lord Sesshomaru?

102
00:05:51,527 --> 00:05:52,194
No!

103
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,861
I want to go with you.

104
00:05:53,894 --> 00:05:55,261
I won't let go.

105
00:05:55,294 --> 00:05:59,994
-Hey, Sesshomaru,
what's all this about?

106
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:02,194
You're going after
Magatsuhi, aren't you?

107
00:06:04,927 --> 00:06:07,694
-Magatsuhi is my prey now.

108
00:06:07,727 --> 00:06:09,094
-You're weak, demon.

109
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:11,394
-(THINKING) Now that I
have learned his scent,

110
00:06:11,427 --> 00:06:14,627
I shall hunt him
down, and kill him.

111
00:06:14,661 --> 00:06:16,827
-[whimpering]

112
00:06:16,861 --> 00:06:18,394
Whoa!

113
00:06:18,427 --> 00:06:20,594
-What are you doing, Sesshomaru?

114
00:06:20,627 --> 00:06:22,294
-Why not let him go?

115
00:06:22,327 --> 00:06:25,094
-You know well that Magatsuhi
is not of this world.

116
00:06:25,127 --> 00:06:28,427
Only Sesshomaru's Tenseiga is
capable of cutting him down.

117
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:29,794
-Please don't cry.

118
00:06:29,827 --> 00:06:31,861
We'll just have to wait
for him like we always do,

119
00:06:31,894 --> 00:06:32,761
Master Jaken.

120
00:06:32,794 --> 00:06:34,927
-I'll be waiting.

121
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:38,861
-(THINKING) Please come
back soon, Lord Sesshomaru.

122
00:06:38,894 --> 00:06:41,361
-InuYasha, Magatsuhi
must have been

123
00:06:41,394 --> 00:06:42,861
the one who sealed
Kagome's powers.

124
00:06:42,894 --> 00:06:44,461
It's the only explanation.

125
00:06:44,494 --> 00:06:45,994
-Yeah, I know.

126
00:06:46,027 --> 00:06:49,261
That means we'll have to destroy
Magatsuhi to undo the seal.

127
00:06:49,294 --> 00:06:52,627
And I'm not very happy about
leaving the job to Sesshomaru

128
00:06:52,661 --> 00:06:53,127
alone.

129
00:06:58,594 --> 00:07:01,827
-Little demon, you're staying
behind as well, are you?

130
00:07:01,861 --> 00:07:03,227
-It's Master Jaken!

131
00:07:03,261 --> 00:07:05,727
-Will you please be
polite, little demon.

132
00:07:05,761 --> 00:07:07,327
-That attitude is
bigger than he is.

133
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:08,161
-Huh!

134
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,527
Look who's talking, small fry.

135
00:07:10,561 --> 00:07:12,094
KAGOME: Sorry, InuYasha.

136
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,161
-What for?

137
00:07:13,194 --> 00:07:15,094
There's no reason
for you to apologize.

138
00:07:15,127 --> 00:07:15,894
-I guess so.

139
00:07:15,927 --> 00:07:17,761
But it's just frustrating.

140
00:07:17,794 --> 00:07:19,061
I feel so useless.

141
00:07:19,094 --> 00:07:20,494
-Don't worry about it.

142
00:07:20,527 --> 00:07:23,461
We'll fix this.

143
00:07:23,494 --> 00:07:26,094
Besides, I know it doesn't
seem like it right now.

144
00:07:26,127 --> 00:07:27,461
But this is a good sign.

145
00:07:27,494 --> 00:07:29,661
If Magatsuhi and Naraku
went to the trouble

146
00:07:29,694 --> 00:07:33,094
of sealing your power, they
must be pretty scared of it.

147
00:07:33,127 --> 00:07:35,627
-(THINKING) Am I really
a threat to them?

148
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:44,794
-Well, Naraku, it looks
like he isn't coming back.

149
00:07:44,827 --> 00:07:46,694
-I'm not expecting
him to come back.

150
00:07:46,727 --> 00:07:49,027
The body I lent him
has been destroyed.

151
00:07:49,061 --> 00:07:51,627
-So you mean
Magatsuhi is no more.

152
00:07:51,661 --> 00:07:53,394
-He cannot be killed.

153
00:07:53,427 --> 00:07:58,327
Anyway, I have a good idea of
what Magatsuhi will do next.

154
00:07:58,361 --> 00:08:00,794
In fact, I'm looking
forward to it.

155
00:08:04,327 --> 00:08:05,994
-Look, I'm sorry.

156
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,227
I know it's a bad time to leave.

157
00:08:08,261 --> 00:08:08,961
-It's OK.

158
00:08:08,994 --> 00:08:09,994
We understand.

159
00:08:10,027 --> 00:08:11,694
It's not your fault, Kagome.

160
00:08:11,727 --> 00:08:12,727
-Sango's correct.

161
00:08:12,761 --> 00:08:14,527
We'll be right here with Kohaku.

162
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:15,394
-Wait, Kagome.

163
00:08:15,427 --> 00:08:16,661
You can't go home yet.

164
00:08:16,694 --> 00:08:18,161
What's InuYasha doing?

165
00:08:18,194 --> 00:08:19,827
He should be here.

166
00:08:19,861 --> 00:08:20,927
-It's OK.

167
00:08:20,961 --> 00:08:22,761
I spoke to InuYasha yesterday.

168
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,494
We said our goodbyes.

169
00:08:24,527 --> 00:08:27,227
Well, I'll come back as soon
as my entrance exams are done.

170
00:08:41,327 --> 00:08:44,161
-Kagome has gone back to
her homeland, has she?

171
00:08:44,194 --> 00:08:45,294
-Uh, yeah.

172
00:08:45,327 --> 00:08:47,394
Something about having
to face this weak demon

173
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:48,527
called entrance exams.

174
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,394
She's been talking
about it for a while.

175
00:08:50,427 --> 00:08:53,494
-But is it safe for Kagome
to travel there by herself?

176
00:08:53,527 --> 00:08:55,027
Couldn't you have gone with her?

177
00:08:55,061 --> 00:08:56,761
-I'm sure she'll be fine.

178
00:08:56,794 --> 00:08:59,561
It's actually a lot safer
there than it is here.

179
00:09:02,761 --> 00:09:04,994
(THINKING) This battle
will only get worse.

180
00:09:05,027 --> 00:09:09,561
If Kagome were to lose her life
somehow, just like Kikyo did,

181
00:09:09,594 --> 00:09:14,427
I, I'd be-- it would
be hard to let her go.

182
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:17,094
But I'd rather she live safely
on the other side of the well

183
00:09:17,127 --> 00:09:19,727
than to see that happen to her.

184
00:09:19,761 --> 00:09:23,094
At least Kagome's family
is there on the other side.

185
00:09:23,127 --> 00:09:25,827
She wouldn't be alone.

186
00:09:25,861 --> 00:09:26,894
-Huh?

187
00:09:26,927 --> 00:09:28,361
KAGOME'S MOTHER'S
VOICE: Dear Kagome, we

188
00:09:28,394 --> 00:09:30,561
won a trip to a hot
spring in a local draw.

189
00:09:30,594 --> 00:09:32,194
Sorry you couldn't make it.

190
00:09:32,227 --> 00:09:34,327
-You mean nobody's here?

191
00:09:34,361 --> 00:09:37,694
Oh well I guess I can't
really blame them.

192
00:09:37,727 --> 00:09:40,294
They didn't know I was going
to come back, after all.

193
00:09:40,327 --> 00:09:41,294
Huh?

194
00:09:41,327 --> 00:09:43,727
I forgot school!

195
00:09:43,761 --> 00:09:45,027
I'm so late.

196
00:09:45,061 --> 00:09:47,561
I have to catch up on all
the schoolwork I've missed.

197
00:09:47,594 --> 00:09:51,461
I don't have time to relax.

198
00:09:51,494 --> 00:09:52,161
Huh?

199
00:09:52,194 --> 00:09:55,327
It's Sunday?

200
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:59,261
[phone ringing]

201
00:09:59,294 --> 00:10:00,261
WOMAN (ON PHONE): Hello.

202
00:10:00,294 --> 00:10:01,794
-Hi, this is Kagome.

203
00:10:01,827 --> 00:10:03,294
Um, is Yuka home.

204
00:10:03,327 --> 00:10:04,227
WOMAN (ON PHONE): No.

205
00:10:04,261 --> 00:10:06,761
She went out with
Eddie and Ayumi.

206
00:10:06,794 --> 00:10:09,527
-Do you know if they're studying
at the library by any chance?

207
00:10:09,561 --> 00:10:10,561
-Hmm.

208
00:10:10,594 --> 00:10:11,661
I'm not sure.

209
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,961
Could you call her cell?

210
00:10:13,994 --> 00:10:18,061
--[sigh] i don't even
have a cell phone.

211
00:10:18,094 --> 00:10:21,827
I can't get a signal in
the feudal era, anyway.

212
00:10:21,861 --> 00:10:23,494
I'll go to sleep.

213
00:10:23,527 --> 00:10:26,827
Oh, I'm sleeping in a real bed.

214
00:10:26,861 --> 00:10:30,161
[traffic noise]

215
00:10:30,194 --> 00:10:33,361
-It's too noisy!

216
00:10:33,394 --> 00:10:36,327
All right, time to eat.

217
00:10:36,361 --> 00:10:37,461
So delicious.

218
00:10:37,494 --> 00:10:40,427
I'm a genius in the kitchen.

219
00:10:40,461 --> 00:10:43,227
Yeah, it's good.

220
00:10:43,261 --> 00:10:47,361
[sigh] I want mom's cooking.

221
00:10:47,394 --> 00:10:49,194
OK, time to hit the books.

222
00:10:49,227 --> 00:10:52,827
After all, that's the
reason I came home.

223
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,961
(THINKING) I wonder what
InuYasha and the others

224
00:10:54,994 --> 00:10:57,094
are doing right now?

225
00:10:57,127 --> 00:10:57,761
Hang on!

226
00:10:57,794 --> 00:10:59,694
What is InuYasha doing?

227
00:10:59,727 --> 00:11:03,694
Usually he comes to bug me
right after I get back home.

228
00:11:03,727 --> 00:11:06,594
Hmph.

229
00:11:06,627 --> 00:11:10,594
I'm lonely, and after
I finally came home.

230
00:11:16,961 --> 00:11:19,494
[sigh] Heavy.

231
00:11:19,527 --> 00:11:21,361
Huh?

232
00:11:21,394 --> 00:11:22,894
A blanket?

233
00:11:22,927 --> 00:11:23,394
Huh?

234
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,427
-So, you sleep well?

235
00:11:30,194 --> 00:11:31,461
-InuYasha.

236
00:11:31,494 --> 00:11:32,427
-What is it?

237
00:11:32,461 --> 00:11:34,561
I didn't do anything
wrong, I swear.

238
00:11:34,594 --> 00:11:36,661
-No, that's not it.

239
00:11:36,694 --> 00:11:37,527
-Huh?

240
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:39,194
-I'm just so glad to see you.

241
00:11:39,227 --> 00:11:41,961
That's all.

242
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:44,461
-Uh, OK.

243
00:11:44,494 --> 00:11:46,461
So here.

244
00:11:46,494 --> 00:11:49,094
Kaida said you should
hold onto this.

245
00:11:49,127 --> 00:11:50,927
-The bow from Mount Azusa?

246
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:52,961
-Your spiritual power
might be sealed.

247
00:11:52,994 --> 00:11:54,894
But it can still help
you clear your mind.

248
00:11:54,927 --> 00:11:56,827
That will probably
help you in your battle

249
00:11:56,861 --> 00:11:58,494
against entrance exam.

250
00:11:58,527 --> 00:11:59,694
-Yeah.

251
00:11:59,727 --> 00:12:02,627
I'm not sure how much
use it'll be, but thanks.

252
00:12:02,661 --> 00:12:03,461
Huh?

253
00:12:03,494 --> 00:12:04,527
-Well, guess I'll seeing you.

254
00:12:04,561 --> 00:12:05,294
Later.

255
00:12:05,327 --> 00:12:08,961
-Sit, boy.

256
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:10,927
-Why?

257
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:11,827
Nobody's here?

258
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:12,927
-Yeah.

259
00:12:12,961 --> 00:12:14,161
-That's stupid.

260
00:12:14,194 --> 00:12:16,094
Instead of sitting here
feeling sorry for yourself,

261
00:12:16,127 --> 00:12:17,494
you should have just come back.

262
00:12:17,527 --> 00:12:19,927
-Look, it's not that easy.

263
00:12:19,961 --> 00:12:22,094
For one thing, I
have school tomorrow.

264
00:12:22,127 --> 00:12:24,961
Plus, mom and everyone
might come home soon.

265
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:25,994
-Hmm.

266
00:12:26,027 --> 00:12:27,427
Listen, Kagome.

267
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:28,594
-Huh?

268
00:12:28,627 --> 00:12:31,394
-Do you, do you like
living here in this world?

269
00:12:31,427 --> 00:12:33,194
-Yeah, of course I do.

270
00:12:33,227 --> 00:12:35,027
This is where I was
born and raised.

271
00:12:35,061 --> 00:12:37,161
And my family and
friends are here.

272
00:12:37,194 --> 00:12:38,461
-Of course.

273
00:12:38,494 --> 00:12:40,294
-What brought this on?

274
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:44,127
-Look, uh, how would you feel
about staying on this side

275
00:12:44,161 --> 00:12:46,194
until the battle
with Naraku's over?

276
00:12:46,227 --> 00:12:47,227
Hmm?

277
00:12:47,261 --> 00:12:49,694
-Huh, there's no fever.

278
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,527
-I'm not delirious, OK?

279
00:12:51,561 --> 00:12:54,461
I'm just looking out for you.

280
00:12:54,494 --> 00:12:57,694
-[gasp] Oh.

281
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,827
I see.

282
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,394
Well, guess you don't
need me here anymore.

283
00:13:01,427 --> 00:13:03,661
Next thing you know, you'll
be going to the hot springs

284
00:13:03,694 --> 00:13:06,161
and stuff with Moroku and Sango.

285
00:13:06,194 --> 00:13:08,894
-No, I'm not going
to any hot springs.

286
00:13:08,927 --> 00:13:10,261
Huh?

287
00:13:10,294 --> 00:13:14,594
Kagome, this is only
a fake, am I right?

288
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,761
-It's a lucky charm.

289
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:17,061
We sell them at our shrine.

290
00:13:17,094 --> 00:13:20,361
Maybe Magatsuhi was able to
steal your spiritual power

291
00:13:20,394 --> 00:13:23,461
because that was Kikyo's wish
back when she was still alive.

292
00:13:23,494 --> 00:13:24,861
-Huh?

293
00:13:24,894 --> 00:13:27,694
-Originally, the Shikon Jewel
was neither good nor evil.

294
00:13:27,727 --> 00:13:29,761
It would reflect the
heart of its owner.

295
00:13:29,794 --> 00:13:33,261
But within the Jewel, good and
evil are constantly at battle.

296
00:13:33,294 --> 00:13:35,827
When Kikyo died after
we wounded each other,

297
00:13:35,861 --> 00:13:39,861
she had no intention
of being reincarnated.

298
00:13:39,894 --> 00:13:40,994
-I see.

299
00:13:41,027 --> 00:13:43,194
All the feelings she had
for you were channeled

300
00:13:43,227 --> 00:13:47,427
into this Shikon Jewel,
until they were reborn in me.

301
00:13:47,461 --> 00:13:49,527
And then I ended up bringing
the Shikon Jewel back

302
00:13:49,561 --> 00:13:52,127
into the feudal era.

303
00:13:52,161 --> 00:13:56,061
So even if the seal on your
powers was Kikyo's wish,

304
00:13:56,094 --> 00:13:59,894
it was only because she
didn't want to fight anymore.

305
00:13:59,927 --> 00:14:03,827
The Jewel granted her her wish.

306
00:14:03,861 --> 00:14:05,727
-That reminds me of something.

307
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,761
My grandpa once said,
when the person who

308
00:14:07,794 --> 00:14:10,327
obtains the Jewel makes the
one and only correct wish,

309
00:14:10,361 --> 00:14:13,827
then the Jewel will be purified,
and disappear from this world

310
00:14:13,861 --> 00:14:16,027
forever.

311
00:14:16,061 --> 00:14:18,261
Even if sealing my
powers was Kikyo's wish,

312
00:14:18,294 --> 00:14:20,661
somehow it wasn't the
one and only correct

313
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,594
wish my grandpa
was talking about.

314
00:14:22,627 --> 00:14:24,694
-Hmm.

315
00:14:24,727 --> 00:14:28,327
-Not only that, I promised
Kikyo that I'd fight.

316
00:14:28,361 --> 00:14:32,327
-Kagome, the rest is up to you.

317
00:14:32,361 --> 00:14:34,061
-That's why I have to do this.

318
00:14:34,094 --> 00:14:35,794
I have no choice.

319
00:14:35,827 --> 00:14:39,061
InuYasha, do you
think I'll be stronger

320
00:14:39,094 --> 00:14:40,994
once the seal has been removed?

321
00:14:41,027 --> 00:14:42,527
-So you chose to fight?

322
00:14:42,561 --> 00:14:44,061
Is that what you're
saying to me?

323
00:14:44,094 --> 00:14:45,427
-I want to see this through.

324
00:14:45,461 --> 00:14:49,027
But I know I can't stay with
you guys, unless I get stronger.

325
00:14:49,061 --> 00:14:51,494
Anyway, I should say thanks.

326
00:14:51,527 --> 00:14:53,061
It's sweet that
you'd worry about me.

327
00:14:53,094 --> 00:14:56,761
-Uh, well, I, I guess so.

328
00:14:56,794 --> 00:15:00,594
-Please just let
me stay with you.

329
00:15:00,627 --> 00:15:02,494
-Uh, Kagome--

330
00:15:07,327 --> 00:15:09,694
-[gasp]

331
00:15:09,727 --> 00:15:12,261
-If that's what you
want, then I promise

332
00:15:12,294 --> 00:15:15,427
I'll protect you with my life.

333
00:15:15,461 --> 00:15:15,927
-InuYasha.

334
00:15:24,361 --> 00:15:27,761
(THINKING) Is he
going to kiss me?

335
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:29,427
Yeah, I think he is.

336
00:15:32,594 --> 00:15:34,227
KAGOME'S MOM: We're home!

337
00:15:34,261 --> 00:15:34,794
-[gasp]

338
00:15:34,827 --> 00:15:35,694
-Hey, Kagome.

339
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:37,827
When did you get back?

340
00:15:37,861 --> 00:15:39,894
Uh, what are you guys doing?

341
00:15:39,927 --> 00:15:42,894
-Well, we, uh, uh, I wish
I'd known you were coming.

342
00:15:42,927 --> 00:15:44,727
Were you lonely, my dear?

343
00:15:44,761 --> 00:15:47,094
-It's a shame you
couldn't have joined us.

344
00:15:47,127 --> 00:15:48,361
-I know.

345
00:15:48,394 --> 00:15:50,294
But I sure hope you didn't
hurry home on my account.

346
00:15:50,327 --> 00:15:54,661
[nervous laugh] I didn't
realize that one day I

347
00:15:54,694 --> 00:15:58,694
would have to choose between the
two worlds-- this one or his.

348
00:16:07,156 --> 00:16:11,589
Exam ticket, pencil
case, and test guides.

349
00:16:11,623 --> 00:16:12,989
OK.

350
00:16:13,023 --> 00:16:16,389
(THINKING) It's finally here,
the day of high school entrance

351
00:16:16,423 --> 00:16:16,889
exams.

352
00:16:21,256 --> 00:16:22,923
Well, I'll see you later.

353
00:16:22,956 --> 00:16:24,556
-You didn't forget
anything, right?

354
00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:26,389
-We'll be praying
for your success.

355
00:16:26,423 --> 00:16:30,623
-Yeah, just do your best, sis.

356
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,256
-(THINKING) Over
the past 10 days,

357
00:16:32,289 --> 00:16:34,623
InuYasha never
came to visit once.

358
00:16:34,656 --> 00:16:37,323
So I was able to focus
on studying for a change.

359
00:16:37,356 --> 00:16:38,923
I'm as ready as I'll ever be.

360
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,689
I'm going to pass these exams.

361
00:16:40,723 --> 00:16:42,089
-Oh, there she is.

362
00:16:42,123 --> 00:16:44,656
-Kagome, we're over here.

363
00:16:44,689 --> 00:16:45,556
-Hold on.

364
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:46,456
What is this?

365
00:16:46,489 --> 00:16:47,823
Why isn't Kagome here?

366
00:16:47,856 --> 00:16:50,256
-InuYasha, what
are you doing here?

367
00:16:50,289 --> 00:16:51,756
-Isn't that kind of obvious.

368
00:16:51,789 --> 00:16:54,223
Kagome told me to come back
and get her in 10 days.

369
00:16:54,256 --> 00:16:55,856
So I'm here to take her back.

370
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,223
-Are you insane?

371
00:16:57,256 --> 00:16:59,289
She's taking
entrance exams today.

372
00:16:59,323 --> 00:17:00,423
-Huh?

373
00:17:00,456 --> 00:17:03,856
-My boy, you may not be
able to understand this.

374
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:08,056
But Kagome's entire
life is riding on this.

375
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:09,423
Listen well.

376
00:17:09,456 --> 00:17:12,523
Under no circumstances are you
allowed to bother Kagome today.

377
00:17:12,556 --> 00:17:13,056
Wait a minute.

378
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:13,856
He's gone?

379
00:17:13,889 --> 00:17:15,223
-He left a long time ago.

380
00:17:15,256 --> 00:17:17,489
-He didn't hear a
single word you said.

381
00:17:17,523 --> 00:17:19,656
RECORDING: The express
train with service to Tokyo

382
00:17:19,689 --> 00:17:22,256
will be leaving from Platform
Four in three minutes.

383
00:17:22,289 --> 00:17:23,889
-[panting]

384
00:17:23,923 --> 00:17:24,456
-Whoa.

385
00:17:24,489 --> 00:17:26,156
It's so crowded.

386
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:29,123
RECORDING: Until the train
has come to a complete stop.

387
00:17:29,156 --> 00:17:31,223
-If we can just get
on this express train,

388
00:17:31,256 --> 00:17:34,089
we'll make it there
with time to spare.

389
00:17:34,123 --> 00:17:35,189
Let's go, girls.

390
00:17:35,223 --> 00:17:36,523
INUYASHA: Hey, Kagome.

391
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:37,656
-What?

392
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:39,423
-And just where do you
think you're going, huh?

393
00:17:39,456 --> 00:17:41,323
-InuYasha, why?

394
00:17:41,356 --> 00:17:42,223
-We're going back.

395
00:17:42,256 --> 00:17:43,823
You promised 10 days.

396
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:46,556
-Sit, boy.

397
00:17:46,589 --> 00:17:48,156
-Hey wasn't that, uh--

398
00:17:48,189 --> 00:17:49,056
-Your boyfriend.

399
00:17:49,089 --> 00:17:51,023
-You're seeing things.

400
00:17:51,056 --> 00:17:51,689
-Cosplay.

401
00:17:51,723 --> 00:17:53,489
-Why is he barefoot.

402
00:17:53,523 --> 00:17:55,889
-Hey, what are you
three looking at?

403
00:17:55,923 --> 00:17:58,256
-Definitely cosplay.

404
00:17:58,289 --> 00:17:59,989
-With a really bad temper.

405
00:18:00,023 --> 00:18:00,723
-(THINKING) Yikes.

406
00:18:00,756 --> 00:18:02,423
This is a total nightmare.

407
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:06,189
I mean, why would InuYasha
come for me today of all days?

408
00:18:06,223 --> 00:18:10,223
Demons, makeup exams,
demons, extra classes,

409
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:15,023
demons-- looking back on all
that, I've gone through so much

410
00:18:15,056 --> 00:18:16,389
just to make it to this point.

411
00:18:16,423 --> 00:18:20,123
And so help me, I'm not about
to let InuYasha interfere today.

412
00:18:23,956 --> 00:18:25,056
-Damn.

413
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:27,189
Stupid Kagome changing
her stupid attitude

414
00:18:27,223 --> 00:18:28,623
all of a sudden.

415
00:18:28,656 --> 00:18:31,056
-Please just let
me stay with you.

416
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:33,756
-If that's what you
want, then I promise

417
00:18:33,789 --> 00:18:35,723
I'll protect you with my life.

418
00:18:35,756 --> 00:18:37,423
I gave you my word, Kagome.

419
00:18:37,456 --> 00:18:39,223
And I don't go back on my word.

420
00:18:39,256 --> 00:18:40,789
You can run all you want.

421
00:18:40,823 --> 00:18:42,589
But I won't let you get away.

422
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:44,456
ANNOUNCER (ON INTERCOM):
Shinjuku, Shinjuku,

423
00:18:44,489 --> 00:18:46,389
this is Shinjuku.

424
00:18:46,423 --> 00:18:47,856
-We're getting off.

425
00:18:47,889 --> 00:18:48,823
-Excuse me.

426
00:18:48,856 --> 00:18:50,723
-Uh, um, help!

427
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:55,123
Ah, my bag!

428
00:18:55,156 --> 00:18:56,456
[screaming]

429
00:18:56,489 --> 00:18:58,789
ANNOUNCER (ON INTERCOM):
Please stay back from the train

430
00:18:58,823 --> 00:18:59,756
for your own safety!

431
00:18:59,789 --> 00:19:01,189
I'm talking to you, miss.

432
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,556
-Kagome.

433
00:19:02,589 --> 00:19:04,623
ANNOUNCER (ON INTERCOM): OK,
the next train is approaching.

434
00:19:04,656 --> 00:19:06,556
Will you please stand back?

435
00:19:06,589 --> 00:19:08,489
-My exam ticket!

436
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:09,923
-Kagome, find an attendant.

437
00:19:09,956 --> 00:19:12,556
-Yeah, get an attendant
to report it, quick.

438
00:19:12,589 --> 00:19:13,989
-Huh?

439
00:19:14,023 --> 00:19:15,223
-Calm down.

440
00:19:15,256 --> 00:19:16,889
-Kagome, your boyfriend's here.

441
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:17,423
-Huh?

442
00:19:22,689 --> 00:19:24,156
-That's the train.

443
00:19:24,189 --> 00:19:25,089
Hurry, InuYasha.

444
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:27,556
-All right.

445
00:19:27,589 --> 00:19:28,389
-OK.

446
00:19:28,423 --> 00:19:29,489
I knew we weren't seeing things.

447
00:19:29,523 --> 00:19:31,356
That was her boyfriend
at the last station.

448
00:19:31,389 --> 00:19:32,456
-Yeah.

449
00:19:32,489 --> 00:19:35,456
Is it me, or does it
look like he's flying?

450
00:19:35,489 --> 00:19:36,823
-Please catch it.

451
00:19:36,856 --> 00:19:38,956
There's something more important
than my life inside that train.

452
00:19:38,989 --> 00:19:40,223
-Someone stole it?

453
00:19:40,256 --> 00:19:44,689
This world is pretty
dangerous, too, huh?

454
00:19:44,723 --> 00:19:45,489
Finally.

455
00:19:45,523 --> 00:19:47,023
It's about time you stopped.

456
00:19:49,723 --> 00:19:50,823
Now take this!

457
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:51,356
-No!

458
00:19:51,389 --> 00:19:52,256
No cutting.

459
00:19:52,289 --> 00:19:53,723
Sit, boy.

460
00:19:53,756 --> 00:19:54,689
Pardon me.

461
00:19:54,723 --> 00:19:55,623
Coming through.

462
00:19:55,656 --> 00:19:56,456
Excuse me!

463
00:19:56,489 --> 00:19:58,023
I'm looking for my school bag.

464
00:19:58,056 --> 00:20:01,556
There's a very important
exam ticket inside it.

465
00:20:01,589 --> 00:20:03,256
-You'll pay for that, Kagome.

466
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:04,589
Huh?

467
00:20:04,623 --> 00:20:05,556
-Come on.

468
00:20:05,589 --> 00:20:06,723
It has to be in
this car somewhere.

469
00:20:06,756 --> 00:20:08,289
-[sniffing]

470
00:20:08,323 --> 00:20:09,656
-Where is it?

471
00:20:13,156 --> 00:20:13,623
Whoa!

472
00:20:19,623 --> 00:20:20,423
Stupid!

473
00:20:20,456 --> 00:20:23,056
Why did you pull me-- [gasps]

474
00:20:26,089 --> 00:20:27,423
-InuYasha.

475
00:20:27,456 --> 00:20:28,023
-Is this it?

476
00:20:28,056 --> 00:20:28,823
It had your scent.

477
00:20:28,856 --> 00:20:30,823
-So is this the missing bag?

478
00:20:36,823 --> 00:20:37,789
-Huh?

479
00:20:37,823 --> 00:20:39,089
-Why are you crying?

480
00:20:39,123 --> 00:20:39,923
-Thank you!

481
00:20:39,956 --> 00:20:42,123
I am so, so glad you were here.

482
00:20:42,156 --> 00:20:44,123
You completely saved my life.

483
00:20:44,156 --> 00:20:47,323
-Yeah, well I'm glad you
finally figured that out.

484
00:20:51,756 --> 00:20:55,456
-Applicants, the exam
is about to start.

485
00:20:55,489 --> 00:20:57,489
-We're heading back
once you're done, right?

486
00:20:57,523 --> 00:20:58,356
-Mhmm.

487
00:20:58,389 --> 00:21:01,089
And thanks for getting me here.

488
00:21:01,123 --> 00:21:02,489
Oh, my exam ticket.

489
00:21:02,523 --> 00:21:06,623
Uh, exam ticket, exam ticket.

490
00:21:06,656 --> 00:21:07,389
What?

491
00:21:07,423 --> 00:21:09,589
It's not-- it's not here.

492
00:21:09,623 --> 00:21:12,556
My exam ticket is gone!

493
00:21:12,589 --> 00:21:15,656
It's over!

494
00:21:15,689 --> 00:21:16,389
That's done.

495
00:21:16,423 --> 00:21:17,623
-Huh?

496
00:21:17,656 --> 00:21:19,156
-It's all over.

497
00:21:19,189 --> 00:21:20,623
It was a short life.

498
00:21:20,656 --> 00:21:21,923
-Oh, there she is.

499
00:21:21,956 --> 00:21:22,556
Kagome!

500
00:21:22,589 --> 00:21:24,756
[panting]

501
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:25,823
-Mother?

502
00:21:25,856 --> 00:21:28,056
-Here, your exam ticket.

503
00:21:28,089 --> 00:21:28,989
Go on.

504
00:21:29,023 --> 00:21:30,256
I guess you must
have forgotten it.

505
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,523
I found it on your desk.

506
00:21:32,556 --> 00:21:36,356
-[gasp] I don't believe it.

507
00:21:36,389 --> 00:21:37,423
-I don't really get it.

508
00:21:37,456 --> 00:21:39,656
But knock 'em dead, Kagome.

509
00:21:39,689 --> 00:21:41,956
-Yeah!

510
00:21:41,989 --> 00:21:43,489
(THINKING) What a morning.

511
00:21:43,523 --> 00:21:45,756
I don't think I've ever
been that stressed.

512
00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:48,123
It felt like a roller
coaster ride from heaven

513
00:21:48,156 --> 00:21:50,489
to hell, and back
to heaven again.

514
00:21:50,523 --> 00:21:52,523
-You've been dressed like
that the entire time?

515
00:21:52,556 --> 00:21:53,323
-Of course.

516
00:21:53,356 --> 00:21:55,223
-Let's hide those, shall we?

517
00:21:55,256 --> 00:21:56,789
-Yeah, thank you?

518
00:21:56,823 --> 00:21:58,589
KAGOME: (THINKING)
After all that,

519
00:21:58,623 --> 00:22:01,323
I finally made it through my
high school entrance exams.

520
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:12,837
[music playing]

521
00:23:44,779 --> 00:23:47,046
MALE SPEAKER: Byakuya leads
Sesshomaru on a wild chase,

522
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:49,412
while Miroku sucks in
poison, and collapses.

523
00:23:49,446 --> 00:23:52,112
FEMALE SPEAKER: Magatsuhi
takes control of Kohaku's body,

524
00:23:52,146 --> 00:23:55,046
and attempts to transport
the defiled shard to Naraku.

525
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:57,579
The shard forces Kohaku to
relive the dreadful sins

526
00:23:57,612 --> 00:24:00,279
of his past, over
and over again.

527
00:24:00,312 --> 00:24:02,579
Even so, you still have
to wake up, Kohaku.

528
00:24:02,612 --> 00:24:04,112
MALE SPEAKER: Next
time on "InuYasha,

529
00:24:04,146 --> 00:24:07,412
the Final Act: Kohaku's Shard."

530
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,546
MALE SPEAKER: Sister,
it isn't too late?
