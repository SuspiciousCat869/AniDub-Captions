Like a giant Shikon Jewel this
has been completely defiled.

-Inuyasha.

169
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,087
-Look, if we don't
come back, you'll

170
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,387
have to take over for us.

171
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,087
You understand, Shippo?

172
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,120
-How long do I
have to wait here?

173
00:11:40,154 --> 00:11:43,420
You should have let me come
with you guys, Inuyasha.

174
00:11:43,454 --> 00:11:44,454
JAKEN: Hm!

175
00:11:44,487 --> 00:11:46,087
You say that now.

176
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,020
-Ahh!

177
00:11:47,054 --> 00:11:48,287
-It's easy to be
brave when you're

178
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,054
watching from a safe distance.

179
00:11:50,087 --> 00:11:51,154
-Oh, yeah?

180
00:11:51,187 --> 00:11:52,754
And tell me what are
you doing here, Jaken?

181
00:11:52,787 --> 00:11:54,154
Let me guess.

182
00:11:54,187 --> 00:11:57,187
You were probably hiding from
Narraku when they left, right?

183
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,720
-Such slanderous conjecture!

184
00:11:58,754 --> 00:12:00,254
I was sitting in
the shadows deep

185
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:02,554
in thought when
Inuyasha and the others

186
00:12:02,587 --> 00:12:04,720
rushed off without
even consulting me,

187
00:12:04,754 --> 00:12:06,787
the tragic result
of which is that I

188
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,587
wasn't able to join
them in battle.

189

-Yeah, and pigs can fly.

[music playing]

191

-Shippo, you can
fly, can you not?

192
00:12:18,787 --> 00:12:19,587
-Huh?

193
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,154
-I want you to take me up there.

194
00:12:21,187 --> 00:12:24,620
You must take me up to that
big black sphere in the sky.

195
00:12:24,654 --> 00:12:27,787
Yes, I belong at Lord
Sesshomaru's side.

196

Hey!

197
00:12:28,887 --> 00:12:30,887
You can't run off by
yourself like that!

198
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,920
-See you later!

199

Ow!

200
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,554
Hey, what was that for?

201
00:12:35,587 --> 00:12:37,520
-You dare use the
Staff of Two Heads,

202
00:12:37,554 --> 00:12:40,254
a precious give from
Lord Sesshomaru!

203
00:12:40,287 --> 00:12:41,687
You hit me!

Even in demon form, your
human heart remains.

However, your pitiful attacks
cannot even scratch me.

I, Magatsuhi, will show you
just tell powerless you are!

He's trying to control him,
just like he controlled Kohaku.

-Huh!

224
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:05,820
This half demon will serve well
enough to challenge Sesshomaru.

-See, Jaken?

238
00:14:47,154 --> 00:14:50,420
You could have taken A-Un
if you wanted a ride so bad.

239
00:14:50,454 --> 00:14:53,887
-So why were you trying to ride
Shippo up to Naraku anyway?

-Silence, child!

241

What kind of fool would I have
to be to rush up here alone?

-So that was your way
of inviting him along?

243

But Shippo's only
a child, Jaken.

-Only a child!

Look who's talking.

246
00:15:05,454 --> 00:15:07,287
You shouldn't be here, Kohaku.

247
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,554
Sango kept telling
you not to come.

Don't you remember?

249
00:15:10,687 --> 00:15:13,887
-True, but it's too
late to turn back now.

SHIPPO: Whoa!

when you get up close to it.

going inside Naraku?

Just a thought here.

But what if we're just
getting in their way?

-That's right.

-Now I see.

Inuyasha's sword provides
the final link to his senses.

his sword, I have

-Interesting.

283
00:17:08,187 --> 00:17:11,120
Now that both your mind
and body are in demon form,

284
00:17:11,154 --> 00:17:13,354
it makes you a bit
tougher than usual.

285
00:17:13,387 --> 00:17:16,420
-Showing no mercy
to your own brother?

286
00:17:16,454 --> 00:17:19,320
You must really hate Inuyasha.

-Hm!

288
00:17:20,154 --> 00:17:22,320
I feel nothing towards him.

289
00:17:22,354 --> 00:17:25,020
I've never consider that
half demon to be my brother!

290
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,454
-You are weak, Sesshomaru.

You fool!

292
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,654
Had you drawn
Bakusaiga, Inuyasha

293
00:17:38,687 --> 00:17:41,020
would have been
obliterated in an instant.

294

But instead you chose
to draw Tenseiga,

295
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:47,020
a blade that cannot cut
through anything of this world.

296
00:17:47,054 --> 00:17:49,354
You should have
know that as long

297
00:17:49,387 --> 00:17:53,487
as I'm using Inuyasha's body
your Tenseiga is useless.

298
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,420
Now, prepare to die.

get Tenseiga to him quickly!

corner of Inuyasha's heart.

Tenseiga's power can
no longer restore him.

307
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:44,154
He is lost to you now.

want, then I promise

Obey me!

-Well, well, Magatshui.

343
00:20:12,787 --> 00:20:14,420
What will you do now?

344
00:20:14,454 --> 00:20:16,054
It appears the
half demon is more

345
00:20:16,087 --> 00:20:18,054
difficult to control
than you thought.

346
00:20:18,087 --> 00:20:20,554
-Do you want me to
leave Inuyasha's body?

347
00:20:20,587 --> 00:20:23,654
Then why didn't you say
so in the first place?

348
00:20:23,687 --> 00:20:25,987
SESSHOMARU (VOICEOVER):
However, if Magatshui

349
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,554
abandons Inuyasha's
body, he will try--

KAGOME (VOICEOVER): --to
take control of me next!

351
00:20:31,487 --> 00:20:35,687
SESSHOMARU (VOICEOVER):
I'll have only one chance.

352
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,587
-Get away!

353
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,854
-I can't move!

354

INUYASHA (VOICEOVER): He's
trying to move to Kagome.

I won't give in!

359
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,454
I refuse to let this beat me!

360
00:20:51,487 --> 00:20:53,954
-It would've been a good
idea if you'd done it sooner,

361
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:57,754
but you were too late.

362
00:20:57,787 --> 00:20:59,654
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER):
You bastard!

363
00:20:59,687 --> 00:21:02,054
You won't stop me
from protecting her!

364
00:21:02,087 --> 00:21:02,554
Huh?

365

INUYASHA (VOICEOVER):
Dragon-scaled Tessaiga?

-What?

367
00:21:11,587 --> 00:21:12,920
I'm being forced out!

00:21:12,954 --> 00:21:14,554
KAGOME (VOICEOVER):
It's working.

369
00:21:14,587 --> 00:21:17,487
Magatshui's being drawn out.

370
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,687
-What's wrong?

371
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,187
Have you given up hiding
in other people's bodies?

372
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,354
-What's happening!

373
00:21:23,387 --> 00:21:26,520
I can neither return nor escape!

374
00:21:26,554 --> 00:21:29,287
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER): The source
of my demonic energy, my demon

hold of Magatshui.

-You couldn't have
picked a worse person

00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,854
to try and possess.

379

-No!

380
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:44,487
I cannot lose to the demonic
energy of a half demon!

-Tenseiga!

382
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:51,087
It's over, Magatshui.

383
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,587
