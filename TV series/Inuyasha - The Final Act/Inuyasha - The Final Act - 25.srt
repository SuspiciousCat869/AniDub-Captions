00:01:44,372 --> 00:01:48,972
-So you're all here, you
and your worthless group

4
00:01:49,005 --> 00:01:51,539
of so-called friends.

5
00:01:51,572 --> 00:01:59,305
-Yeah, all of us,
everyone survived.

6
00:02:06,139 --> 00:02:07,605
INUYASHA: Thoughts Fall Short.

7
00:02:19,605 --> 00:02:22,105
-Lady Kaede, what is that?

8
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:23,272
KAEDE: It's Naraku.

9
00:02:23,305 --> 00:02:25,239
He's falling apart

10
00:02:25,272 --> 00:02:26,772
-Wind tunnel!

11
00:02:26,805 --> 00:02:29,239
-Hiraikotsu!

00:02:29,272 --> 00:02:30,239
-Meido Zangetsuha!

-[chuckling]

15
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:45,772
-Naraku cut himself
free from his own body.

16
00:02:45,805 --> 00:02:49,372
-He must be trying to escape
Bakusaiga's destruction.

17
00:02:49,405 --> 00:02:50,072
-Escape?

18
00:02:50,105 --> 00:02:51,472
A futile efforts.

19
00:02:57,605 --> 00:03:00,472
KAGOME: (THINKING) There's
light within the jewel.

20
00:03:00,505 --> 00:03:02,905
-What a simple bunch you are.

21
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:05,639
This little gathering of
friends has bought my back

22
00:03:05,672 --> 00:03:07,705
to the Shikon Jewel yet again.

23
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:09,605
Was that what you hoped for?

24
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:12,405
Do you think you have won?

25
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:14,539
I assure you, you have not.

26
00:03:14,572 --> 00:03:16,739
For the Jewel and I are now one.

27
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:21,705
-The darkness is
pushing out the light!

28
00:03:26,705 --> 00:03:27,872
-Bastard.

29
00:03:27,905 --> 00:03:32,472
So he finally fed his
soul to the jewel, did he?

30
00:03:32,505 --> 00:03:36,305
-It's another mass of miasma.

31
00:03:36,339 --> 00:03:37,272
-Meido Zangestuha!

32
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:42,639
Come on.

33
00:03:42,672 --> 00:03:43,839
I keep hitting him.

34
00:03:43,872 --> 00:03:45,639
But he just won't go down.

35
00:03:45,672 --> 00:03:47,639
Well, I wasn't
expecting the Jewel

36
00:03:47,672 --> 00:03:49,139
to leave this world
without a fight.

37
00:03:49,172 --> 00:03:50,605
-More miasma!

38
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,605
-You're worthless.

39
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,105
Bakusaiga!

40
00:03:56,105 --> 00:03:59,005
(THINKING) The miasma leaking
from his severed flesh

41
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,005
is stronger than it was before.

42
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:02,639
Jaken.

43
00:04:02,672 --> 00:04:04,205
-Yes, my lord?

44
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,305
-Leave Naraku's body at once.

45
00:04:06,339 --> 00:04:09,539
-At once? (THINKING) I've
been long awaiting that order.

46
00:04:09,572 --> 00:04:10,205
-But--

47
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,405
-Silence, you fool.

48
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,605
Two children such as you
will only get in his way.

49
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:16,539
-Lord Sesshomaru.

50
00:04:16,572 --> 00:04:18,505
-It's outside too.

51
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:20,005
SANGO: Hiraikotsu.

52
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:20,939
-Sister?

53
00:04:20,972 --> 00:04:22,972
-Kohaku, get out quickly.

54
00:04:23,005 --> 00:04:26,205
-Oh, Lady Sango, this is yours.

55
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,472
Thank you so much.

56
00:04:28,505 --> 00:04:29,205
-You're welcome.

57
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:36,839
-Miroku, take this.

58
00:04:36,872 --> 00:04:38,372
-Kohaku?

59
00:04:38,405 --> 00:04:39,139
-Use it.

60
00:04:39,172 --> 00:04:41,105
And take care o my sister.

61
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:42,505
-I will.

62
00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:43,639
Let's go, Sango.

63
00:04:43,672 --> 00:04:44,139
-Right.

64
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:49,072
-Wow.

65
00:04:49,105 --> 00:04:50,939
This cloud of
miasma is enormous.

66
00:04:50,972 --> 00:04:52,972
-It's the same size
as the first time

67
00:04:53,005 --> 00:04:56,072
we saw it, only now it's
just a hollow shell.

68
00:04:56,105 --> 00:04:57,539
-Oh, this is bad.

69
00:04:57,572 --> 00:04:58,972
I think it's starting to fall.

70
00:04:59,005 --> 00:05:01,805
And look where it's heading!

71
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:04,272
-Wind tunnel!

72
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:07,572
No matter how much I suck in,
more miasma keeps flowing out.

73
00:05:07,605 --> 00:05:09,572
-Are you OK, Kagome?

74
00:05:09,605 --> 00:05:10,839
-Yeah, I'm fine.

75
00:05:10,872 --> 00:05:13,405
I don't know why, but
all the miasma around me

76
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:16,172
seems to have been purified.

77
00:05:16,205 --> 00:05:18,172
(THINKING) Still,
Naraku interferes

78
00:05:18,205 --> 00:05:20,105
every time I try to draw my bow.

79
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:22,139
If only I could get a shot off.

80
00:05:22,172 --> 00:05:25,605
-(THINKING) I won't
let you shoot, not yet.

81
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:27,105
-Meido Zangetsuha!

82
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:27,605
-Bakusaiga!

83
00:05:30,605 --> 00:05:35,505
-Just a little longer,
a little longer.

84
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:36,505
VILLAGER: We're doomed!

85
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:38,005
Lady Kaede!

86
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:39,972
-It' coming this way.

87
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:42,939
-All of you, flee to the forest.

88
00:05:42,972 --> 00:05:44,272
-OK!

89
00:05:44,305 --> 00:05:47,872
-(THINKING) Naraku and Onigumo
have a fated connection to this

90
00:05:47,905 --> 00:05:48,372
village.

91
00:05:48,405 --> 00:05:49,372
Of course!

92
00:05:49,405 --> 00:05:52,772
He intends to destroy it.

93
00:05:52,805 --> 00:05:53,739
-Meido Zangetsuha!

94
00:05:58,705 --> 00:06:00,505
It's no use, Naraku.

95
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:01,572
You've lost.

96
00:06:01,605 --> 00:06:03,239
No matter how much
you try to resist it,

97
00:06:03,272 --> 00:06:04,839
your body's falling apart.

98
00:06:04,872 --> 00:06:07,405
-Enough of my body
still remains, enough

99
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,839
to wipe out a single
village, at least.

100
00:06:10,872 --> 00:06:13,772
-A village?

101
00:06:13,805 --> 00:06:14,972
-Oh!

102
00:06:15,005 --> 00:06:17,205
-The masses of miasma are
falling to the ground.

103
00:06:22,772 --> 00:06:26,572
[screaming]

104
00:06:26,605 --> 00:06:29,405
-Any exposure to the
miasma will be fatal.

105
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:31,339
You must get the young
ones out of here.

106
00:06:31,372 --> 00:06:33,739
-Naraku, bastard.

107
00:06:33,772 --> 00:06:35,972
-Don't tell me you didn't
realize where we were,

108
00:06:36,005 --> 00:06:36,872
InuYasha.

109
00:06:36,905 --> 00:06:39,839
[cackling] It's too late now.

110
00:06:39,872 --> 00:06:42,539
If you kill me, my
miasma-laden corpse

111
00:06:42,572 --> 00:06:46,639
will descend on the village,
destroying everything.

112
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,105
-And what of it?

113
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:48,605
Bakusaiga!

114
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,472
-He's fallinga apart.

115
00:06:57,505 --> 00:06:59,572
-The Shikon Jewel
is still alive.

116
00:06:59,605 --> 00:07:02,839
It's falling by Naraku's will!

117
00:07:02,872 --> 00:07:05,172
Hey Shippo, can you
make it outside?

118
00:07:05,205 --> 00:07:07,072
-Yeah.

119
00:07:07,105 --> 00:07:08,739
-Sango, we should join them.

120
00:07:08,772 --> 00:07:10,105
-Yes.

121
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,939
-(THINKING) It would appear
that not even Bakusaiga can cut

122
00:07:11,972 --> 00:07:13,839
the Shikon Jewel.

123

-Meido Zangetsuha!

126
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,172
-(THINKING) I see it!

127
00:07:40,205 --> 00:07:41,639
This is my chance!

128
00:07:44,605 --> 00:07:47,105
Believe in yourself, and shoot.

129
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:49,739
My arrow will pierce
the Shikon Jewel.

130
00:07:49,772 --> 00:07:50,672
I know it will.

131
00:07:54,939 --> 00:07:56,372
-The arrow disappeared.

132
00:07:56,405 --> 00:07:58,305
-(THINKING) Please
pierce the Jewel.

133
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:04,539
Nothing will ever satisfy you.

134
00:08:04,572 --> 00:08:08,039
Because the Shikon Jewel
didn't grant your real wish.

135
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:10,472
NARAKU: My real wish, you say?

136
00:08:10,505 --> 00:08:11,939
That's right.

137
00:08:11,972 --> 00:08:14,105
Now I remember.

138
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:15,939
All I wanted was Kikyo's heart.

139
00:08:22,805 --> 00:08:28,372
It seems I won't
be joining Kikyo

140
00:08:28,405 --> 00:08:31,372
in this or the next world.

141
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:39,072

142
00:08:39,105 --> 00:08:41,039
-Oh!

143
00:08:41,072 --> 00:08:42,972
VILLAGER: Is it over?

144
00:08:43,005 --> 00:08:45,305
VILLAGER: The masses of
miasma are disappearing.

145
00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:47,872
VILLAGER: We're saved.

146
00:08:47,905 --> 00:08:50,805
-The miasma around the
village is being purified.

147
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:53,439
-This must mean that Kagome's
arrow defeated Naraku.

148
00:08:53,472 --> 00:08:55,905
-Did I do it?

149
00:08:55,939 --> 00:08:56,405
[gasp]

150
00:08:56,439 --> 00:08:56,905
-Huh?

151
00:08:56,939 --> 00:08:57,405
Kagome!

152
00:09:00,405 --> 00:09:01,372
-Kagome!

-InuYasha!

154

-Damn!

-[screaming]

156
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:11,772
-Damn it!

157
00:09:21,205 --> 00:09:21,705
Naraku.

158
00:09:31,105 --> 00:09:33,272
At that very moment,
I made a final wish

159
00:09:33,305 --> 00:09:35,472
upon the Shikon Jewel.

160
00:09:35,505 --> 00:09:36,539
-That moment?

161
00:09:36,572 --> 00:09:38,872
NARAKU: The moment
Byakuya of the Dreams

162
00:09:38,905 --> 00:09:41,139
cut you with his blade.

163
00:09:41,172 --> 00:09:41,905
-Hang on.

164
00:09:41,939 --> 00:09:43,139
She was cut by Byakuya?

165
00:09:43,172 --> 00:09:46,139
-That wish shall be
granted when I die,

166
00:09:46,172 --> 00:09:49,005
though it was not
mine to begin with.

167
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:51,939
The Shikon Jewel forced
me to make its wish.

168
00:09:51,972 --> 00:09:54,872
In the end, I was
but its instrument.

169
00:09:58,439 --> 00:10:00,805
-Naraku.

170
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:03,272
-[gasp]

171
00:10:14,105 --> 00:10:17,039
-[gasp] Miroku!

172
00:10:17,072 --> 00:10:18,972
-Has the wind
tunnel disappeared?

173
00:10:19,005 --> 00:10:21,905
-The curse has been broken!

174
00:10:21,939 --> 00:10:26,005
-It has indeed, which
means Naraku is no more.

175
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,039
-Hmm.

176
00:10:27,072 --> 00:10:29,005
Huh?

177
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:30,005
-What?

178
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,772
A Meido?

179
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:32,839
Kagome!

180
00:10:32,872 --> 00:10:33,339
-InuYasha!

181
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:39,605
InuYasha!

182
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,272
-The Meido vanished.

183
00:10:41,305 --> 00:10:42,539
She's gone!

184
00:10:42,572 --> 00:10:45,105
-(THINKING) What's going on?

185
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:47,239
Kagome?

186
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:50,005
-Um, was Kagome
really cut by Byakuya?

187
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:52,105
-Yeah, she was.

188
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:55,305
-Because I saw him,
inside Naraku's body.

189
00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:59,639
He was stealing demonic energy
from the Meido Zangestuha.

190
00:10:59,672 --> 00:11:00,605
-Huh?

191
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:02,039
KAEDE: The well.

192
00:11:02,072 --> 00:11:03,605
-Yes, what about it?

193
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:06,205
-What happened to the
bone eater's well?

194
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:06,705
-Huh?

195
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:14,739
-She's right.

196
00:11:14,772 --> 00:11:15,672
It's disappeared.

197
00:11:22,572 --> 00:11:25,039
-Hey, Sota.

198
00:11:25,072 --> 00:11:26,072
-What's going on?

199
00:11:26,105 --> 00:11:27,705
Is Kagome still sick?

200
00:11:27,739 --> 00:11:30,239
-I mean, can't she even make
it to our high school entrance

201
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:30,905
ceremony?

202
00:11:30,939 --> 00:11:31,972
-Afraid not.

203
00:11:32,005 --> 00:11:34,472
We're as worried as
you are, believe me.

204
00:11:34,505 --> 00:11:35,572
-[sigh]

205
00:11:35,605 --> 00:11:37,139
-(THINKING) I wonder
what happened to sis.

206
00:11:37,172 --> 00:11:40,805
She said she'd back in time for
the entrance ceremony for sure.

207
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:42,672
[screaming]

208
00:11:42,705 --> 00:11:44,139
-Was that an earthquake?

209
00:11:44,172 --> 00:11:45,272
-I don't think so.

210
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:47,505
It felt like it came
from inside the shrine.

211
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:48,072
-Wait.

212
00:11:48,105 --> 00:11:49,439
-Oh, wait up.

213
00:11:49,472 --> 00:11:51,039
-Hey, you can't go in there!

214
00:11:51,072 --> 00:11:54,572
-Maybe something broke inside.

215
00:11:54,605 --> 00:11:56,105
Hmm?

216
00:11:56,139 --> 00:11:57,072
-Huh?

217
00:11:57,105 --> 00:11:59,039
Mom, grandpa, this is bad!

218
00:12:01,605 --> 00:12:02,505
GRANDPA HIGURASHI: Ah!

219
00:12:02,539 --> 00:12:05,639
The bone eater's
well has disappeared.

220
00:12:05,672 --> 00:12:06,739
-(THINKING) Oh, Kagome!

221
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:16,405
-Maybe Kagome went home,
you know, to the world

222
00:12:16,439 --> 00:12:18,072
on the other side of the well.

223
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:19,305
-I doubt it.

224
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:22,372
-The thing is, if Naraku
wanted to eliminate Kagome,

225
00:12:22,405 --> 00:12:24,705
he could have done it long ago.

226
00:12:24,739 --> 00:12:27,672
Instead, he was focused
on reaching this well

227
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,472
in this village.

228
00:12:29,505 --> 00:12:30,405
What was it?

229
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:32,439
What was Naraku's final wish?

230
00:12:37,705 --> 00:12:38,139
InuYasha!

231
00:12:38,172 --> 00:12:39,139
-Huh?

232
00:12:39,172 --> 00:12:40,505
-What happened to
the Shikon Jewel.

233
00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:41,705
-(THINKING) The Shikon Jewel?

234
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,472
Please, Tessaiga,
take me to Kagome!

235
00:12:48,505 --> 00:12:49,872
-InuYasha.

236
00:12:49,905 --> 00:12:50,872
-Meido Zangetsuha!

237
00:12:55,805 --> 00:12:58,239
-[gasp]

238
00:12:58,272 --> 00:12:59,972
-(THINKING) Of course.

239
00:13:00,005 --> 00:13:01,705
The Shikon Jewel was
afraid of Kagome.

240
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:05,572
At the very end, it would
have done anything to survive.

241
00:13:05,605 --> 00:13:08,539
So there's no way it could
risk letting her live.

242
00:13:08,572 --> 00:13:09,839
Hang in there, Kagome!

243
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,939
I'll find you, no
matter what it takes!

244
00:13:28,555 --> 00:13:29,288
-One, two.

245
00:13:29,321 --> 00:13:29,921
One, two.

246
00:13:29,955 --> 00:13:30,821
One, two.

247
00:13:30,855 --> 00:13:31,755
-Oh, there she is!

248
00:13:31,788 --> 00:13:33,921
Kagome!

249
00:13:33,955 --> 00:13:34,855
-Huh?

250
00:13:34,888 --> 00:13:35,955
Oh, hey guys.

251
00:13:35,988 --> 00:13:37,088
-Sorry to keep you waiting.

252
00:13:37,121 --> 00:13:38,788
Come shopping with us.

253
00:13:38,821 --> 00:13:40,488
-We need to get some sportswear.

254
00:13:40,521 --> 00:13:41,821
KAGOME: (THINKING) That's right.

255
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:43,121
I almost forgot.

256
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,488
I'm in high school now.

257
00:13:48,988 --> 00:13:50,721
KAGOME'S FRIEND: So
what did you tell him?

258
00:13:50,755 --> 00:13:52,155
KAGOME'S FRIEND: That
I'm just not into him.

259
00:13:52,188 --> 00:13:52,655
KAGOME'S FRIEND: What?

260
00:13:52,688 --> 00:13:53,721
Why?

261
00:13:53,755 --> 00:13:55,488
-But you guys are
perfect for each other.

262
00:13:55,521 --> 00:13:56,588
-Yeah, right.

263
00:13:56,621 --> 00:13:58,455
I can't date someone
who's shorter than me.

264
00:13:58,488 --> 00:13:59,755
-Uh, OK.

265
00:13:59,788 --> 00:14:01,188
-Huh, what's this?

266
00:14:01,221 --> 00:14:02,655
Someone asked you out?

267
00:14:02,688 --> 00:14:03,555
Who was it?

268
00:14:03,588 --> 00:14:04,488
-Really?

269
00:14:04,521 --> 00:14:05,888
The guy from the
entrance ceremony.

270
00:14:05,921 --> 00:14:07,021
Don't you remember?

271
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:09,155
-Yeah, you were right
here with us, Kagome.

272
00:14:09,188 --> 00:14:13,321
-Oh, right, him. (THINKING)
The entrance ceremony?

273
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:19,788
MAMA HIGURASHI: Kagome, can
you come give me a hand?

274
00:14:19,821 --> 00:14:21,621
Have you decided on a
school club to join?

275
00:14:21,655 --> 00:14:23,421
-I have, the tennis club.

276
00:14:23,455 --> 00:14:27,255
Hey, uh, grandpa, how about
my real graduation present?

277
00:14:27,288 --> 00:14:28,088
-Huh?

278
00:14:28,121 --> 00:14:29,955
But I already gave it to you.

279
00:14:29,988 --> 00:14:33,088
A dried dragon's tail and
tangu whiskers, for good luck.

280
00:14:33,121 --> 00:14:34,555
Didn't you like them.

281
00:14:34,588 --> 00:14:35,655
-Sorry, grandpa.

282
00:14:35,688 --> 00:14:37,421
But I'm pretty sure
sis fed those to Buyo.

283
00:14:37,455 --> 00:14:38,288
-They're dried foods.

284
00:14:38,321 --> 00:14:39,288
-[gasp]

285
00:14:39,321 --> 00:14:40,588
-Maybe you should
give her something

286
00:14:40,621 --> 00:14:42,355
she'd appreciate next time.

287
00:14:42,388 --> 00:14:44,288
COACH: All right,
freshmen, you ready?

288
00:14:44,321 --> 00:14:46,388
Five laps, starting now.

289
00:14:46,421 --> 00:14:47,588
-We bought all the gear.

290
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:51,188
-And we don't even get
to step on the court.

291
00:14:51,221 --> 00:14:51,688
Huh?

292
00:14:59,488 --> 00:15:01,088
-Wow, the archery club.

293
00:15:01,121 --> 00:15:02,421
-That looks so cool.

294
00:15:09,155 --> 00:15:10,055
-Hey, sis!

295
00:15:10,088 --> 00:15:12,988
-Oh, Sota, welcome home.

296
00:15:13,021 --> 00:15:15,355
-Man, I'm starving.

297
00:15:15,388 --> 00:15:17,688
Uh, what's the matter, sis?

298
00:15:17,721 --> 00:15:20,821
-Hey, was this shed always here?

299
00:15:20,855 --> 00:15:22,088
-Yeah.

300
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:25,755
-Wasn't there, like, a shrine
here, with a well in it?

301
00:15:25,788 --> 00:15:27,055
-What are you talking about?

302
00:15:27,088 --> 00:15:29,755
-Oh, back from school already?

303
00:15:29,788 --> 00:15:30,621
-Hi, grandpa.

304
00:15:30,655 --> 00:15:32,788
-A shrine with a well?

305
00:15:32,821 --> 00:15:33,988
-Yeah, don't think so.

306
00:15:34,021 --> 00:15:36,688
There's never been
anything like that here.

307
00:15:36,721 --> 00:15:39,521
-I could have sworn.

308
00:15:39,555 --> 00:15:41,821
(THINKING) Why does
everything feel so weird?

309
00:15:41,855 --> 00:15:42,821
What's wrong with me?

310
00:15:42,855 --> 00:15:43,555
[phone vibrating]

311
00:15:43,588 --> 00:15:44,788
Huh?

312
00:15:44,821 --> 00:15:46,721
A message?

313
00:15:46,755 --> 00:15:48,721
It's from Hojo.

314
00:15:48,755 --> 00:15:52,988
HOJO: You want to go
see a movie this Sunday?

315
00:15:53,021 --> 00:15:54,921
-(THINKING) I don't know.

316
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:55,655
What to do?

317
00:15:58,255 --> 00:16:00,388
-Hey, Kagome, long time no see.

318
00:16:00,421 --> 00:16:02,221
-So, are you getting
used to your new school?

319
00:16:02,255 --> 00:16:04,255
What's a boy's
school like, anyway?

320
00:16:04,288 --> 00:16:04,955
-I don't know.

321
00:16:04,988 --> 00:16:08,121
There's a lot of guys.

322
00:16:08,155 --> 00:16:09,488
-And?

323
00:16:09,521 --> 00:16:12,555
-We went to the movies, and
then the arcade, ate some food,

324
00:16:12,588 --> 00:16:13,488
and went home.

325
00:16:13,521 --> 00:16:14,721
-So you decided to
go out with him.

326
00:16:14,755 --> 00:16:15,955
KAGOME: No, we just hung out.

327
00:16:15,988 --> 00:16:18,455
-But that was obviously
a date, Kagome?

328
00:16:18,488 --> 00:16:20,021
KAGOME: We're just friends.

329
00:16:20,055 --> 00:16:21,521
-You're just friends?

330
00:16:21,555 --> 00:16:22,721
That is too cruel.

331
00:16:22,755 --> 00:16:24,988
You do realize Hojo's
had a major crush on you

332
00:16:25,021 --> 00:16:26,021
since junior high.

333
00:16:26,055 --> 00:16:27,288
-Why don't you just go for it?

334
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:29,221
-It's not like you
hate him, right?

335
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:30,288
-No.

336
00:16:30,321 --> 00:16:32,188
But it's just not
like that, all right?

337
00:16:32,221 --> 00:16:33,255
-OK.

338
00:16:33,288 --> 00:16:34,521
Is there someone else you like?

339
00:16:34,555 --> 00:16:35,688
That, I could understand.

340
00:16:35,721 --> 00:16:36,188
-No.

341
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,821
(THINKING) It's different.

342
00:17:09,621 --> 00:17:13,288
there's supposed to be a
scar on the sacred tree.

343
00:17:13,321 --> 00:17:14,488
A scar?

344
00:17:14,521 --> 00:17:15,355
From what?

345
00:17:20,021 --> 00:17:20,488
InuYasha?

346
00:17:26,655 --> 00:17:27,855
That's right!

347
00:17:27,888 --> 00:17:31,021
500 years ago, InuYasha
and I were under this tree!

348
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:39,721
The bone eater's
well has disappeared.

349
00:17:39,755 --> 00:17:40,321
-Kagome!

350
00:17:40,355 --> 00:17:41,921
-You there, sis?

351
00:17:41,955 --> 00:17:43,255
-Kagome!

352
00:17:43,288 --> 00:17:46,621
-Mom, grandpa, Sota.

353
00:17:46,655 --> 00:17:47,588
-Kagome!

354
00:17:47,621 --> 00:17:48,455
-Huh, what's wrong?

355
00:17:48,488 --> 00:17:49,688
-Kagome!

356
00:17:49,721 --> 00:17:51,155
-What are you doing, mom?

357
00:17:51,188 --> 00:17:52,155
I'm here.

358
00:17:52,188 --> 00:17:53,121
-What's wrong?

359
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,588
Mrs. Higurashi, what
happened to her?

360
00:17:55,621 --> 00:17:58,021
-Huh?

361
00:17:58,055 --> 00:17:59,988
-Is Kagome missing?

362
00:18:00,021 --> 00:18:01,455
-Huh?

363
00:18:01,488 --> 00:18:03,055
They don't see me.

364
00:18:03,088 --> 00:18:04,855
No one sees I'm here.

365
00:18:04,888 --> 00:18:06,188
-We were worried about her.

366
00:18:06,221 --> 00:18:08,121
Because she hasn't made
it to high school yet.

367
00:18:08,155 --> 00:18:10,055
And we know how hard
she worked to get in.

368
00:18:10,088 --> 00:18:12,388
-[gasp]

369
00:18:12,421 --> 00:18:15,055
SHIKON JEWEL: The
well has been sealed.

370
00:18:15,088 --> 00:18:19,021
There is nowhere for you to go.

371
00:18:19,055 --> 00:18:20,955
-It's the Shikon Jewel.

372
00:18:20,988 --> 00:18:23,188
-Kagome, where are
you? (THINKING)

373
00:18:23,221 --> 00:18:24,221
I have to keep searching.

374
00:18:24,255 --> 00:18:27,055
She's got to be
somewhere in this Meido.

375
00:18:27,088 --> 00:18:28,021
MAMA HIGURASHI: Kagome!

376
00:18:28,055 --> 00:18:28,921
SOTA: Sis!

377
00:18:28,955 --> 00:18:30,188
MAMA HIGURASHI: Kagome!

378
00:18:30,221 --> 00:18:33,455
-Those voices, it's Kagome's
mom, and her brother.

379
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:35,288
Kagome isn't back on your side?

380
00:18:35,321 --> 00:18:36,621
-Is that InuYasha

381
00:18:36,655 --> 00:18:37,255
-Yeah.

382
00:18:37,288 --> 00:18:38,088
That's his voice!

383
00:18:38,121 --> 00:18:39,488
-Huh?

384
00:18:39,521 --> 00:18:40,155
I don't--

385
00:18:40,188 --> 00:18:41,455
-That sounds like--

386
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:43,255
-That was Kagome's boyfriend.

387
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,655
-The bone eater's well
has just disappeared.

388
00:18:45,688 --> 00:18:47,455
What on earth
happened on that side?

389
00:18:47,488 --> 00:18:49,121
-Do you know where Kagome is?

390
00:18:49,155 --> 00:18:49,788
-Is sis OK?

391
00:18:49,821 --> 00:18:51,188
Did someone hurt her?

392
00:18:51,221 --> 00:18:52,321
INUYASHA: Try not to worry.

393
00:18:52,355 --> 00:18:54,921
I promise you, I'm
going to find her.

394
00:18:54,955 --> 00:18:56,221
Just hang on.

395
00:18:56,255 --> 00:18:56,721
Kagome!

396
00:19:00,088 --> 00:19:00,888
-Where am I?

397
00:19:00,921 --> 00:19:03,688
What did you do to me?

398
00:19:03,721 --> 00:19:08,021
-Kagome, you are where
you've been all along.

399
00:19:08,055 --> 00:19:08,988
-That's impossible.

400
00:19:09,021 --> 00:19:10,421
I was living at home.

401
00:19:10,455 --> 00:19:11,821
I was going to high school.

402
00:19:11,855 --> 00:19:14,288
SHIKON JEWEL: That was an
illusion, nothing more.

403
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:17,755
It was a glance at the future
that you might have had.

404
00:19:17,788 --> 00:19:20,255
Do you wish to
return to that world?

405
00:19:20,288 --> 00:19:22,188
It's not too late.

406
00:19:22,221 --> 00:19:24,188
Wish upon the Shikon Jewel.

407
00:19:24,221 --> 00:19:27,455
And the life you saw
shall be yours once more.

408
00:19:27,488 --> 00:19:30,321
That, or do nothing.

409
00:19:30,355 --> 00:19:32,421
And you shall spend
the rest of eternity

410
00:19:32,455 --> 00:19:35,555
here, alone in the darkness.

411
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,388
-Out of my way.

412
00:19:43,421 --> 00:19:43,888
[inaudible]

413
00:19:53,288 --> 00:19:56,555
I tore that thing to pieces,
and it's already regenerating.

414
00:19:56,588 --> 00:19:58,321
It doesn't make any sense.

415
00:19:58,355 --> 00:20:00,821
-There's no need to search.

416
00:20:00,855 --> 00:20:03,988
The priestess will
be here shortly.

417
00:20:04,021 --> 00:20:05,188
-Priestess?

418
00:20:05,221 --> 00:20:06,821
You mean Kagome?

419
00:20:06,855 --> 00:20:09,021
-We can sense her
heart trembling

420
00:20:09,055 --> 00:20:12,955
with fear in the darkness.

421
00:20:12,988 --> 00:20:14,688
-Mom!

422
00:20:14,721 --> 00:20:16,821
Grandpa!

423
00:20:16,855 --> 00:20:18,688
Sota!

424
00:20:18,721 --> 00:20:20,221
SHIKON JEWEL: No
one can hear you.

425
00:20:20,255 --> 00:20:22,055
-InuYasha!

426
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:22,988
Miroku!

427
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:24,855
Sango!

428
00:20:24,888 --> 00:20:26,121
Shippo.

429
00:20:26,155 --> 00:20:27,755
-No one will come.

430
00:20:27,788 --> 00:20:30,921
-It, it can't be.

431
00:20:30,955 --> 00:20:33,921
-Soon she will give in
to a fear of darkness,

432
00:20:33,955 --> 00:20:35,655
and wish upon the Shikon Jewel.

433
00:20:35,688 --> 00:20:38,121
She will wish to be saved.

434
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:41,055
Already she longs to
escape the darkness,

435
00:20:41,088 --> 00:20:44,021
and return to the peaceful
world she once knew.

436
00:20:44,055 --> 00:20:46,655
-So then the Shikon Jewel
was never destroyed?

437
00:20:46,688 --> 00:20:50,288
-Haven't you noticed, half
demon, where you are now

438
00:20:50,321 --> 00:20:53,088
is inside the Shikon Jewel?

439
00:20:53,121 --> 00:20:54,021
-Inside it?

440
00:20:54,055 --> 00:20:55,088
-Yes.

441
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:58,355
And should Kagome
choose to save herself,

442
00:20:58,388 --> 00:21:01,255
she will spend eternity
here, along with you.

443
00:21:01,288 --> 00:21:02,555
-What?

444
00:21:02,588 --> 00:21:05,088
-Once she is imprisoned
in the jewel,

445
00:21:05,121 --> 00:21:08,588
she will be forced to do battle
against us for all eternity.

446
00:21:08,621 --> 00:21:11,588
-There's no way I'm going
to let you imprison her.

447
00:21:11,621 --> 00:21:14,888
-The Shikon Jewel will
never be destroyed.

448
00:21:14,921 --> 00:21:17,255
The battle will continue
within the Jewel,

449
00:21:17,288 --> 00:21:20,421
just as it always has,
until it is passed on

450
00:21:20,455 --> 00:21:24,288
to another who will use
it for dark purposes.

451
00:21:24,321 --> 00:21:26,788
It is a never ending cycle.

452
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,588
-Don't give in, Kagome.

453
00:21:31,621 --> 00:21:33,421
Please, just hold on
until I get there.

454
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:37,721
-InuYasha.

455
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:40,688
SHIKON JEWEL: Kagome, you never
belonged in the feudal era.

456
00:21:40,721 --> 00:21:44,055
Return, return to the
world where you belong.

457
00:21:46,988 --> 00:21:54,455
-(THINKING) If I wish
to return, I can?

458
00:21:54,488 --> 00:21:59,188
-Kagome, don't you
make any wishes!

459
00:21:59,221 --> 00:21:59,688
Kagome!

460
00:22:07,773 --> 00:22:12,673
[music playing]

461
00:23:43,411 --> 00:23:44,844
-Lady Kaede, hurry!

462
00:23:44,877 --> 00:23:46,277
The baby's about to be born.

463
00:23:46,311 --> 00:23:47,711
KAEDE: Congratulations, girls.

464
00:23:47,744 --> 00:23:50,711
-It's three years since that
final battle with the Shikon

465
00:23:50,744 --> 00:23:51,411
Jewel.

466
00:23:51,444 --> 00:23:52,344
I feel for him.

467
00:23:52,377 --> 00:23:54,177
InuYasha must be lonely.

468
00:23:54,211 --> 00:23:56,944
-I realized that I'm not the
only one who cares for Kagome.

469
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:58,611
Her family needs
her as much as I do.

470
00:23:58,644 --> 00:24:01,711
KAGOME: But InuYasha,
I want to see you.

471
00:24:01,744 --> 00:24:04,144
INUYASHA: Next time on
"InuYasha, The Final Act."

472
00:24:04,177 --> 00:24:06,877
KAGOME: The final episode,
"Toward Tomorrow."

473
00:24:06,911 --> 00:24:10,577
INUYASHA: Kagome came into
this world to be with me.
