[theme music]

2
00:01:44,307 --> 00:01:46,674
[roar]

3
00:01:54,889 --> 00:01:55,589
-Masterful.

4
00:01:55,623 --> 00:01:57,324
Masterful, Lord Sesshomaru.

5
00:02:04,656 --> 00:02:06,723
-A technique that cuts
through to the underworld.

6
00:02:06,756 --> 00:02:08,689
TOTOSAI: Instead of just
wounding your opponent

7
00:02:08,723 --> 00:02:10,656
in battle, the
master of Tenseiga

8
00:02:10,689 --> 00:02:12,889
cuts a path to the
underworld, and in doing

9
00:02:12,923 --> 00:02:14,689
so sends your enemy there.

10
00:02:14,723 --> 00:02:16,723
That is how you use t.

11
00:02:16,756 --> 00:02:20,689
And the name for that
technique is Meido Zangetsuha.

12
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:23,723
At present, you can only achieve
a Crescent Moonlight Cut,

13
00:02:23,756 --> 00:02:25,356
but once your
technique is perfected,

14
00:02:25,389 --> 00:02:27,756
you will be able to cut
a complete circle that

15
00:02:27,789 --> 00:02:31,523
will instantly swallow your foe,
sending him to the next world.

16
00:02:31,556 --> 00:02:33,223
-It seems i have much to learn.

17
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:40,623
TOTOSAI: The demon
blade Dakki, huh?

18
00:02:40,656 --> 00:02:43,323
-Come on, you must know
something about it.

19
00:02:43,356 --> 00:02:45,556
-Well, yes, I have heard of it.

20
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:46,923
Take a look at this.

21
00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:51,389
-What is that thing?

22
00:02:51,423 --> 00:02:53,156
-One of Ryujin's scales.

23
00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:54,523
-I've heard of this sword.

24
00:02:54,556 --> 00:02:56,323
The legendary Dakki.

25
00:02:56,356 --> 00:02:59,456
-This one is a failed attempt,
hardly worthy of the name.

26
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:00,756
-A failed attempt?

27
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:04,056
That thing absorbed all of
Tetsusaiga's demonic energy.

28
00:03:04,089 --> 00:03:06,723
Naturally, it still wasn't
enough to defeat me.

29
00:03:06,756 --> 00:03:08,589
-If the blade bad been
successfully forged,

30
00:03:08,623 --> 00:03:09,556
you wouldn't be here.

31
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,123
-Are you saying it's
possible there's

32
00:03:11,156 --> 00:03:12,789
a real one like this somewhere?

33
00:03:12,823 --> 00:03:14,556
-Why would you ask such a thing?

34
00:03:14,589 --> 00:03:16,389
-Well, if Tetsusaiga
had the ability

35
00:03:16,423 --> 00:03:18,256
to absorb demonic
energy like that,

36
00:03:18,289 --> 00:03:20,689
then fighting Naraku and
Moryomaru would be easier.

37
00:03:20,723 --> 00:03:22,589
-Out of the question.

38
00:03:22,623 --> 00:03:24,289
To achieve that
kind of power, you'd

39
00:03:24,323 --> 00:03:25,723
have to fight against Dakki.

40
00:03:25,756 --> 00:03:27,489
If you were to
lose such a battle,

41
00:03:27,523 --> 00:03:30,689
and all of Tetsusaiga's demonic
energy were to be absorbed,

42
00:03:30,723 --> 00:03:33,456
it'd be just a rusty
blade, incapable of being

43
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:35,489
returned to its original form.

44
00:03:35,523 --> 00:03:38,089
Tell me, Inuyasha, is that a
risk you're willing to take?

45
00:03:38,123 --> 00:03:39,956
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER):
Dragon Scale Tetsusaiga.

46
00:03:46,556 --> 00:03:50,023
[grunting]

47
00:03:54,056 --> 00:03:55,523
-I've done it.

48
00:03:55,556 --> 00:03:58,756
I've finally managed to combine
Ryujin's scales with a blade.

49
00:03:58,789 --> 00:04:00,023
[shouting]

50
00:04:00,056 --> 00:04:03,289
-It's a monster!

51
00:04:03,323 --> 00:04:03,989
-Toshu!

52
00:04:04,023 --> 00:04:05,089
Show yourself!

53
00:04:05,123 --> 00:04:05,923
Where are you hiding?

54
00:04:09,956 --> 00:04:11,989
Right here?

55
00:04:12,023 --> 00:04:14,156
So you've finally
completed Dakki.

56
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:15,189
Hand it over to me.

57
00:04:15,223 --> 00:04:16,123
Now.

58
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:18,523
-Wind Scar!

59
00:04:18,556 --> 00:04:21,889
[scream]

60
00:04:21,923 --> 00:04:23,323
-Did you get him?

61
00:04:23,356 --> 00:04:24,256
-Huh.

62
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:25,056
Didn't take much.

63
00:04:27,756 --> 00:04:30,289
-Master, that man is most
definitely the swordsmith

64
00:04:30,323 --> 00:04:31,489
Toshu.

65
00:04:31,523 --> 00:04:33,123
I've heard that he's been
using Ryujin's scales

66
00:04:33,156 --> 00:04:34,756
to attempt to forge Dakki.

67
00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:37,256
-This must be where that
giant raccoon got his.

68
00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:39,556
-He must have stolen
it from this guy.

69
00:04:39,589 --> 00:04:41,489
-Is it possible for
a human to craft

70
00:04:41,523 --> 00:04:42,956
a demon blade such as that?

71
00:04:42,989 --> 00:04:44,189
-You must run!

72
00:04:44,223 --> 00:04:48,623
Ryujin is alive, I assure you!

73
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:50,589
[roar]

74
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,156
-Now, I'm looking
forward to this.

75
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:55,323
-I suggest you
stand back, Toshu.

76
00:04:55,356 --> 00:04:56,856
-You should let us handle this.

77
00:04:56,889 --> 00:04:59,089
-Young fools, you
dare to protect Toshu?

78
00:04:59,123 --> 00:05:01,556
Then I shall tear each
one of you limb from limb!

79
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:03,156
-Sounds like fun to me!

80
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:07,756
Damn.

81
00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:09,389
Wind Scar!

82
00:05:09,423 --> 00:05:10,856
[laughter]

83
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:12,223
-Is that all?

84
00:05:12,256 --> 00:05:14,989
-Wind Scar!

85
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,289
-Attack me as many
times as you like.

86
00:05:17,323 --> 00:05:18,589
My shield is invincible.

87
00:05:18,623 --> 00:05:20,856
The more demonic
energy it's exposed to,

88
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:23,756
the stronger it gets.

89
00:05:23,789 --> 00:05:25,989
[laughter]

90
00:05:26,023 --> 00:05:29,356
-So this is the extent of
the wolf demon tribe's power?

91
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:30,723
How pathetic.

92
00:05:30,756 --> 00:05:32,056
-Run for it, Shinta!

93
00:05:32,089 --> 00:05:33,389
-Brother!

94
00:05:33,423 --> 00:05:34,623
-What's this?

95
00:05:34,656 --> 00:05:35,456
Leftovers?

96
00:05:35,489 --> 00:05:35,956
-Yah!

97
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:41,823
-Kai!

98
00:05:41,856 --> 00:05:42,956
-That won't do.

99
00:05:42,989 --> 00:05:44,523
What would be the
point of this if you

100
00:05:44,556 --> 00:05:46,456
don't leave any survivors?

101
00:05:46,489 --> 00:05:47,489
There, there.

102
00:05:47,523 --> 00:05:49,189
Don't be afraid, boy.

103
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:51,123
I'm going to lend you this.

104
00:05:51,156 --> 00:05:55,023
It'll ease your pain,
and make you run faster.

105
00:05:55,056 --> 00:05:56,856
-How about this?

106
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:58,756
Wind Scar!

107
00:05:58,789 --> 00:05:59,956
-You're wasting your time.

108
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:07,756
-I'll smash that shield
of yours eventually.

109
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:08,856
-You amuse me.

110
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:10,456
You really think
your feeble attacks

111
00:06:10,489 --> 00:06:12,956
will crack this
dragon scale shield?

112
00:06:12,989 --> 00:06:15,023
Thanks to all your
attacks, I can give you

113
00:06:15,056 --> 00:06:16,989
a taste of your own medicine.

114
00:06:17,023 --> 00:06:18,223
-He absorbed all that energy.

115
00:06:18,256 --> 00:06:19,523
-He's about to attack.

116
00:06:19,556 --> 00:06:21,023
-Inuyasha, run away!

117
00:06:21,056 --> 00:06:22,089
-Run away?

118
00:06:22,123 --> 00:06:23,356
I don't think so.

119
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:25,523
-Now, die!

120
00:06:25,556 --> 00:06:28,523
-This is what I've
been waiting for!

121
00:06:28,556 --> 00:06:29,523
Backlash Wave!

122
00:06:36,023 --> 00:06:37,989
-Ah!

123
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,456
-Oh, wow he did it!

124
00:06:39,489 --> 00:06:40,789
-Brilliant!

125
00:06:40,823 --> 00:06:42,856
The master must have known
that his best chance at victory

126
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:45,523
was to wait for an attack, then
hit him with the Backlash Wave.

127
00:06:45,556 --> 00:06:46,623
-Brilliant?

128
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,723
This is Inuyasha we're
talking about, right?

129
00:06:48,756 --> 00:06:51,189
-You bastard.

130
00:06:51,223 --> 00:06:53,889
[groan]

131
00:06:53,923 --> 00:06:55,823
-Why'd you do that?

132
00:06:55,856 --> 00:06:57,789
-It's mine.

133
00:06:57,823 --> 00:06:59,989
Ryujin's power is mine!

134
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:05,023
Now Dakki is finally complete.

135
00:07:05,056 --> 00:07:07,589
-Huh?

136
00:07:07,623 --> 00:07:09,323
MAN: Wait for us, Koga!

137
00:07:09,356 --> 00:07:11,656
MAN: Let's rest for a bit.

138
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:12,823
KOGA: You're kidding, right?

139
00:07:12,856 --> 00:07:13,756
We just took a break.

140
00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:14,723
MAN: Just took a break?

141
00:07:14,756 --> 00:07:16,456
That was a half day ago!

142
00:07:16,489 --> 00:07:18,689
MAN: Are you trying to kill us?

143
00:07:18,723 --> 00:07:19,656
-Man.

144
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:20,823
(VOICEOVER) What is that?

145
00:07:20,856 --> 00:07:22,023
Something's closing in on us.

146
00:07:22,056 --> 00:07:22,889
And fast.

147
00:07:22,923 --> 00:07:23,523
Hit the ground!

148
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:29,523
-You're Koga, aren't you?

149
00:07:29,556 --> 00:07:30,289
-That depends.

150
00:07:30,323 --> 00:07:31,556
Who are you?

151
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:33,756
-My friends were all killed
because of you, all right?

152
00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:36,623
I've come to take the Shikon
jewel shars in your legs!

153
00:07:39,223 --> 00:07:40,423
-Don't be stupid.

154
00:07:40,456 --> 00:07:43,289
You can't seriously believe
that you can defeat me,

155
00:07:43,323 --> 00:07:44,089
you little brat.

156
00:07:44,123 --> 00:07:46,856
-Oh, no?

157
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:47,356
-Wah!

158
00:07:50,823 --> 00:07:52,456
-What's really
going on here, kid?

159
00:07:52,489 --> 00:07:53,889
You have the stench of Naraku.

160
00:07:53,923 --> 00:07:56,489
Is he behind this?

161
00:07:56,523 --> 00:07:57,689
Is that why you're here?

162
00:07:57,723 --> 00:07:58,723
Do you work for him?

163
00:07:58,756 --> 00:07:59,556
-Course not!

164
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:00,689
-Then what are you doing here?

165
00:08:00,723 --> 00:08:04,556
And why are you after
my Shikon jewel shards?

166
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:07,023
-(VOICEOVER) The sun's setting!

167
00:08:07,056 --> 00:08:08,756
-Make sure you
return before sunset,

168
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:12,556
or you will never see
your brother again.

169
00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:13,256
-Shinta!

170
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:14,656
-Get back here, brat!

171
00:08:14,689 --> 00:08:17,023
I'm trying to tell you I want
to hear what you have to say!

172
00:08:17,056 --> 00:08:19,389
-Uh, it didn't really
come across like that!

173
00:08:19,423 --> 00:08:20,323
-Not even close!

174
00:08:23,223 --> 00:08:24,856
-This sword is precious to me.

175
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:27,389
I would never hand it over
to you or anyone else.

176
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,289
On the other hand, I'm
very interested in that

177
00:08:29,323 --> 00:08:31,023
blade you have there.

178
00:08:31,056 --> 00:08:33,723
Dakki desires the demonic
energy in that sword.

179
00:08:33,756 --> 00:08:36,323
-I say kill him and just
get it over with, Inuyasha.

180
00:08:36,356 --> 00:08:37,523
Isn't that what we all want?

181
00:08:37,556 --> 00:08:38,923
-Come on, Myoga.

182
00:08:38,956 --> 00:08:41,889
-We came here with the intent to
get the Dakki's power, anyway.

183
00:08:41,923 --> 00:08:45,656
So this should be a simple
task against a mere human.

184
00:08:45,689 --> 00:08:47,656
-Simple minded as usual.

185
00:08:47,689 --> 00:08:50,223
-A sword like that
won't do you any good.

186
00:08:50,256 --> 00:08:52,756
You should know it's far too
powerful for an ordinary human

187
00:08:52,789 --> 00:08:53,956
to handle.

188
00:08:53,989 --> 00:08:55,656
-If that's true, then this
should be easy for you!

189
00:08:55,689 --> 00:08:56,156
-Idiot!

190
00:09:02,423 --> 00:09:05,423
-I can't believe he's able to
overpower Inuyasha like that.

191
00:09:05,456 --> 00:09:07,489
-I wonder if Toshu
really is human?

192
00:09:07,523 --> 00:09:09,523
-Of course I'm human, you fools!

193
00:09:09,556 --> 00:09:13,489
It is because I am human that
I long for a powerful weapon.

194
00:09:13,523 --> 00:09:15,689
So I devoted every
waking moment of my life

195
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:17,923
to forging the ultimate sword.

196
00:09:17,956 --> 00:09:19,389
After forging
hundreds of swords,

197
00:09:19,423 --> 00:09:21,056
I learned an important lesson.

198
00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:24,256
The greater the infusion of
energy, the stronger the blade.

199
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:27,989
I scoured countless battlefields
in search of broken swords

200
00:09:28,023 --> 00:09:31,256
that had absorbed the feelings
of regret and bitter blood.

201
00:09:31,289 --> 00:09:34,389
On one such battlefield,
he found me.

202
00:09:34,423 --> 00:09:35,589
-Human!

203
00:09:35,623 --> 00:09:38,756
Your energy has summoned
I, Ryujin, to this place.

204
00:09:38,789 --> 00:09:41,223
TOSHU: I trembled at the
sight, but it was with joy

205
00:09:41,256 --> 00:09:42,489
more than fear.

206
00:09:42,523 --> 00:09:43,823
Great Ryujin!

207
00:09:43,856 --> 00:09:47,223
I beg of you, please allow
me to forge a sword for you.

208
00:09:47,256 --> 00:09:48,656
-Very well.

209
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:54,023
Your wicked nature makes you
well suited to craft Dakki.

210
00:09:54,056 --> 00:09:58,223
-And that is how Dakki was born.

211
00:09:58,256 --> 00:10:01,323
Every time our blades cross,
Dakki's demonic presences

212
00:10:01,356 --> 00:10:04,489
eats away at Tetsusaiga,
absorbing its demonic energy

213
00:10:04,523 --> 00:10:05,989
little by little.

214
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:08,356
-There's a crack in Tetsusaiga!

215
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:10,856
-(VOICEOVER) Looks I'm gonna
have to shatter Dakki before it

216
00:10:10,889 --> 00:10:13,689
absorbs all of
Tetsusaiga's energy.

217
00:10:13,723 --> 00:10:15,056
Huh?

218
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:17,223
SHIPPO: The dragon scales are
spreading to Toshu's hands!

219
00:10:17,256 --> 00:10:19,923
MIROKU: Dakki's demonic presence
is eating away at him as well.

220
00:10:19,956 --> 00:10:21,456
-I'm trying to help you, Toshu.

221
00:10:21,489 --> 00:10:22,589
You're running out of time.

222
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:24,389
Now drop that sword
before it's too late.

223
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:27,489
-Not until I've taken the last
of Tetsusaiga's demonic energy!

224
00:10:30,356 --> 00:10:34,323
[laughter] I feel it
surging through me.

225
00:10:34,356 --> 00:10:35,623
-Don't you understand?

226
00:10:35,656 --> 00:10:38,289
If this keeps up, your whole
body will be consumed by Dakki.

227
00:10:38,323 --> 00:10:39,656
-You're wrong!

228
00:10:39,689 --> 00:10:44,623
Dakki has chosen me, and I alone
shall be the one to wield it!

229
00:10:44,656 --> 00:10:46,389
-(VOICEOVER) I can't
lose this battle!

230
00:10:46,423 --> 00:10:48,823
TOTOSAI (VOICEOVER) Tetsusaiga
would be just a rusty blade,

231
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:52,189
incapable of being returned
to its original form.

232
00:10:52,223 --> 00:10:55,323
INUYASHA: (VOICEOVER)
Hang in there, Tetsusaiga.

233
00:10:55,356 --> 00:10:57,856
-What a strong gust
of demonic wind.

234
00:10:57,889 --> 00:11:00,723
Dakki, you desire
that power, don't you?

235
00:11:00,756 --> 00:11:02,056
-(VOICEOVER) Just hold together.

236
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:03,456
It won't be much longer.

237
00:11:03,489 --> 00:11:05,123
-It will be ours, Dakki!

238
00:11:05,156 --> 00:11:06,723
-One more time, Tetsusaiga!

239
00:11:10,023 --> 00:11:12,256
KAGOME: Is that wind
protecting Inuyasha?

240
00:11:12,289 --> 00:11:13,423
MYOGA: No!

241
00:11:13,456 --> 00:11:15,023
Tetsusaiga's merely
avoiding contact with Dakki

242
00:11:15,056 --> 00:11:16,556
by any means necessary.

243
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:18,289
The sword has reached its limit.

244
00:11:18,323 --> 00:11:19,656
-What?

245
00:11:19,689 --> 00:11:21,289
-(VOICEOVER) One more strike
is all it would take to destroy

246
00:11:21,323 --> 00:11:22,256
Tetsusaiga.

247
00:11:22,289 --> 00:11:23,923
It can't take much more of this.

248
00:11:23,956 --> 00:11:25,989
-A barrier of wind, huh?

249
00:11:26,023 --> 00:11:29,689
I know of one way to defeat
you without getting too close.

250
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:33,523
But you should know
that better than anyone.

251
00:11:33,556 --> 00:11:34,989
-Wind Scar!

252
00:11:35,023 --> 00:11:36,423
-Come on, Tetsusaiga!

253
00:11:36,456 --> 00:11:36,989
Backlash Wave!

254
00:11:44,989 --> 00:11:48,956
BYAKUA: As you can
see, the sun has set.

255
00:11:48,989 --> 00:11:52,423
So, I assume you brought me
Koga's Shikon jewel shars?

256
00:11:52,456 --> 00:11:53,456
-Where's Shinta?

257
00:11:53,489 --> 00:11:56,989
Where's my brother?

258
00:11:57,023 --> 00:11:58,389
-Ah-ha.

259
00:11:58,423 --> 00:12:00,723
So you brought Koga
here in person, did you?

260
00:12:00,756 --> 00:12:02,523
Well, I suppose that will work.

261
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:03,789
-That damn smell.

262
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,856
You're one of Naraku's
incarnations, huh?

263
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:07,289
-Let Shinta go!

264
00:12:07,323 --> 00:12:07,789
-Stand back!

265
00:12:10,523 --> 00:12:13,189
-I think I understand
what's going on here.

266
00:12:13,223 --> 00:12:17,056
First you had that thing kill
this kid's fellow wolf demons.

267
00:12:17,089 --> 00:12:19,456
Then, like cowards, you
took his brother hostage

268
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,089
so you could get
him to attack me.

269
00:12:21,123 --> 00:12:22,756
Is that about right?

270
00:12:22,789 --> 00:12:24,556
DEMON: So what if it is?

271
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:29,656
-I shall avenge the grievances
of the wolf demon tribe!

272
00:12:29,689 --> 00:12:31,089
[laughter]

273
00:12:31,123 --> 00:12:34,223
-These claws have been washed
in gallons of wolf demon blood.

274
00:12:34,256 --> 00:12:36,689
And now they thirst
for your blood, too.

275
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:39,289
-Shut your mouth-- and die!

276
00:12:39,323 --> 00:12:42,723
[scream]

277
00:12:42,756 --> 00:12:44,223
-Oh.

278
00:12:44,256 --> 00:12:45,489
-So much for him.

279
00:12:45,523 --> 00:12:46,823
You're next, coward.

280
00:12:46,856 --> 00:12:48,189
-Am I?

281
00:12:48,223 --> 00:12:50,023
-After all, you were the one
commanding that beast to kill,

282
00:12:50,056 --> 00:12:51,989
even if it was on
Naraku's orders.

283
00:12:52,023 --> 00:12:53,423
-Yes, that's true.

284
00:12:53,456 --> 00:12:55,056
But if you kill
me, I'm afraid you

285
00:12:55,089 --> 00:12:56,923
might be putting his
brother's life at risk.

286
00:13:00,723 --> 00:13:02,623
-Please help me.

287
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:03,689
-Where is he?

288
00:13:03,723 --> 00:13:05,523
Tell me, or I swear
I'll kill you.

289
00:13:12,756 --> 00:13:13,689
[muffled scream]

290
00:13:13,723 --> 00:13:15,589
KAI: Shinta!

291
00:13:15,623 --> 00:13:16,723
-Hey, wait up!

292
00:13:16,756 --> 00:13:18,189
-You'd better hurry if
you wish to save him.

293
00:13:18,223 --> 00:13:20,489
The demonic energy being
emitted by that moth

294
00:13:20,523 --> 00:13:23,989
might make it quite appetizing
to larger predators.

295
00:13:24,023 --> 00:13:25,356
-I've already come this far.

296
00:13:35,705 --> 00:13:37,071
-Ha ha ha!

297
00:13:37,105 --> 00:13:40,638
I've absorbed all the demonic
energy from the Backlash Wave.

298
00:13:40,671 --> 00:13:42,839
MIROKU: Dakki is cracking!

299
00:13:42,873 --> 00:13:45,139
-It couldn't absorb all of
Tetsusaiga's demonic energy.

300
00:13:49,073 --> 00:13:49,806
-Huh?

301
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,173
Tetsusaiga?

302
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:53,439
-It's reverted back
to its original form!

303
00:13:53,473 --> 00:13:55,939
-It's exactly as
Totosai forewarned.

304
00:13:55,973 --> 00:13:57,406
-Now what happens?

305
00:13:57,439 --> 00:13:58,139
-Sango?

306
00:13:58,173 --> 00:13:59,473
Let's go.

307
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:00,239
-No.

308
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:02,106
You guys stay out of this.

309
00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:04,306
Tetsusaiga and I need to
finish what we started.

310
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:05,706
-That's fine with me.

311
00:14:05,739 --> 00:14:07,339
Now that Tetsusaiga
is dead and gone,

312
00:14:07,373 --> 00:14:09,839
you shall be the next to
serve as fodder for Dakki.

313
00:14:09,873 --> 00:14:10,973
-No, Toshu.

314
00:14:11,006 --> 00:14:13,173
You see, Tetsusaiga and
I are one in the same.

315
00:14:13,206 --> 00:14:16,706
So long as I'm still alive,
Tetsusaiga will never die!

316
00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:17,839
-This is suicide!

317
00:14:17,873 --> 00:14:19,439
-Then I shall finish you off!

318
00:14:22,606 --> 00:14:24,006
INUYASHA: (VOICEOVER)
Tetsusaiga, I

319
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:25,873
won't waste the
path you've opened.

320
00:14:28,806 --> 00:14:31,173
Dammit.

321
00:14:31,206 --> 00:14:32,139
-Ha ha ha!

322
00:14:32,173 --> 00:14:33,439
I've won!

323
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:37,273
[scream]

324
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:43,039
KAGOME: Inuyasha!

325
00:14:43,073 --> 00:14:44,006
-Huh?

326
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:45,139
-Look at that.

327
00:14:45,173 --> 00:14:47,173
Toshu's hand is completely
fused with Dakki.

328
00:14:47,206 --> 00:14:50,073
-I can only presume that
Dakki was afraid of breaking,

329
00:14:50,106 --> 00:14:52,539
and thus transferred the damage
from Tetsusaiga's attacks

330
00:14:52,573 --> 00:14:54,439
directly to Toshu instead.

331
00:14:54,473 --> 00:14:55,639
-(VOICEOVER) Idiot.

332
00:14:55,673 --> 00:14:57,773
In the end, it was his
own sword that killed him.

333
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:08,406
SHIPPO: Tetusaiga is
back to normal now!

334
00:15:11,606 --> 00:15:12,673
-You've done it, master.

335
00:15:12,706 --> 00:15:15,039
Tetsusaiga now
has dragon scales.

336
00:15:15,073 --> 00:15:17,139
Not that I ever doubted
you for an instant.

337
00:15:17,173 --> 00:15:18,373
My faith in you has--

338
00:15:18,406 --> 00:15:20,806
-Sure you did.

339
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:23,006
(VOICEOVER) Sorry to push
you so hard, old friend.

340
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:26,839
But you did well, Tetsusaiga.

341
00:15:26,873 --> 00:15:27,639
MAN: Koga!

342
00:15:27,673 --> 00:15:29,073
-Hm?

343
00:15:29,106 --> 00:15:31,606
INUYASHA: It's those
two scrawny wolf boys.

344
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,539
-I can sense three
Shikon jewel shards

345
00:15:33,573 --> 00:15:34,906
in the direction
they're heading.

346
00:15:34,939 --> 00:15:35,539
No.

347
00:15:35,573 --> 00:15:36,339
Four jewel shards.

348
00:15:36,373 --> 00:15:37,473
-Well, Koga has two shards.

349
00:15:37,506 --> 00:15:39,206
Who do the other two belong to?

350
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:40,373
-Could It be Kohaku?

351
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:41,739
-It doesn't feel like him.

352
00:15:41,773 --> 00:15:43,339
I don't know where
these two are from.

353
00:15:43,373 --> 00:15:45,906
-Well, there's only one
way to find out, right?

354
00:15:45,939 --> 00:15:46,406
-I concur.

355
00:15:54,373 --> 00:15:55,706
-Shinta!

356
00:15:55,739 --> 00:15:56,206
Huh?

357
00:15:59,906 --> 00:16:01,073
-Moryomaru.

358
00:16:01,106 --> 00:16:02,006
-Koga.

359
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:03,406
What good fortune.

360
00:16:03,439 --> 00:16:05,839
I thought I'd have to
come looking for you.

361
00:16:05,873 --> 00:16:09,106
-You've changed quite a bit
since the last time I saw you.

362
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:09,806
-Help me!

363
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:10,839
Get me outta here, Kai!

364
00:16:10,873 --> 00:16:11,939
-Hang in there, Shinta!

365
00:16:11,973 --> 00:16:13,306
I'm coming to save you.

366
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,439
-No you're not.

367
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,806
You don't stand a chance
against this thing, kid.

368
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:19,106
-Does that mean you're
going to help us?

369
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:20,573
-Oh, I'll help.

370
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:22,206
In fact, I've been
waiting for a chance

371
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:24,573
to use the Goraishi
on this thing.

372
00:16:24,606 --> 00:16:25,773
-Hm.

373
00:16:25,806 --> 00:16:29,173
I shall absorb you and
your Shikon jewel shards.

374
00:16:29,206 --> 00:16:30,406
-(VOICEOVER) Damn!

375
00:16:30,439 --> 00:16:33,373
Shards couldn't have picked
a worse time to act up.

376
00:16:33,406 --> 00:16:35,239
-Let's see how
you like Raimeiho!

377
00:16:35,273 --> 00:16:35,739
-Goraishi!

378
00:16:39,673 --> 00:16:40,873
-What's wrong?

379
00:16:40,906 --> 00:16:43,406
You seem a bit sluggish
compared to the last time.

380
00:16:43,439 --> 00:16:44,506
-Shut up.

381
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:46,639
You don't know what
you're talking about.

382
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,739
-Let's put that to
the test, shall we?

383
00:16:48,773 --> 00:16:50,006
Prepare to be incinerated.

384
00:16:53,306 --> 00:16:54,273
-Are you OK?

385
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:55,539
-Don't worry about me.

386
00:16:55,573 --> 00:16:58,439
Worry about yourself.

387
00:16:58,473 --> 00:16:59,373
-Ah.

388
00:16:59,406 --> 00:17:00,606
It would appear
the child has also

389
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,206
brought me a Shikon jewel shard.

390
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:05,773
Now to you, Koga.

391
00:17:05,806 --> 00:17:07,573
I'll be taking your shards next.

392
00:17:07,606 --> 00:17:09,306
-(VOICEOVER) My
legs feel so heavy.

393
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:10,139
INUYASHA: Wind Scar!

394
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:18,939
What are you doing
here anyway, pup?

395
00:17:18,973 --> 00:17:20,373
Moryomaru, you
swallowed something

396
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,417
that didn't belong to
you again, didn't you?

397
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,517
-Ha!

398
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,117
I'll have you know this
shell is invincible.

399
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:28,417
Nothing can reach my heart,
not even an army of soldiers.

400
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,450
-Is that a fact?

401
00:17:29,484 --> 00:17:31,784
Well, can an army
of soldiers do this?

402
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:34,784
Adamant Barrage!

403
00:17:34,817 --> 00:17:36,950
-Your Adamant Barrage.

404
00:17:36,984 --> 00:17:40,150
That will be a great
addition to my arsenal.

405
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,417
-What were you
thinking, you moron?

406
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,317
-Last time I checked,
I was saving your neck.

407
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:47,484
Now get out of here!

408
00:17:47,517 --> 00:17:49,584
-I have this feeling that
Koga's jewel shards are

409
00:17:49,617 --> 00:17:51,550
being controlled
by Midoriko's will.

410
00:17:51,584 --> 00:17:52,250
-Inuyasha!

411
00:17:52,284 --> 00:17:53,550
-You have to save Koga!

412
00:17:53,584 --> 00:17:54,884
-That's what I'm doing.

413
00:17:54,917 --> 00:17:57,450
You've got something
that belongs to me.

414
00:17:57,484 --> 00:17:58,950
And there's no way
in hell I'm going

415
00:17:58,984 --> 00:18:03,217
to let you use my Adamant Spears
to crush scrawny wolf boy.

416
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,750
-Dragon Scale Tetsusaiga.

417
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:07,550
-He's gonna use it already?

418
00:18:07,584 --> 00:18:09,917
-Huh?

419
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,050
INUYASHA: (VOICEOVER) What?

420
00:18:11,084 --> 00:18:12,050
Tetsusaiga's heating up!

421
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,550
-Inuyasha!

422
00:18:18,584 --> 00:18:20,150
-I'm fine.

423
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:21,150
-Impossible.

424
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:24,050
How did you absorb
my demonic energy?

425
00:18:24,084 --> 00:18:26,784
-Now to finish it.

426
00:18:26,817 --> 00:18:29,484
-Inuyasha won't last much
longer, while Moryomaru

427
00:18:29,517 --> 00:18:31,317
has vast amounts
of demonic energy.

428
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,284
-Then what's he doing?

429
00:18:32,317 --> 00:18:33,817
If he keeps up like
this, he's going

430
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:36,384
to end up being consumed
the way Toshu was.

431
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:39,184
-Inuyasha, the arm that has
your Adamant Spears-- there's

432
00:18:39,217 --> 00:18:41,217
a Shikon jewel shard in there.

433
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,017
-You see that?

434
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,584
-It's deep within his shell.

435
00:18:43,617 --> 00:18:46,484
I don't know if my
arrow can reach it.

436
00:18:46,517 --> 00:18:50,617
INUYASHA: Just mark the
spot so I know where it is.

437
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,217
-A futile effort.

438
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:52,717
Huh?

439
00:18:56,684 --> 00:18:57,184
What?

440
00:19:01,284 --> 00:19:01,917
-His arm!

441
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,050
-It opened up!

442
00:19:03,084 --> 00:19:05,484
-You'll pay for making
me look like a fool.

443
00:19:05,517 --> 00:19:05,984
Goraishi!

444
00:19:08,184 --> 00:19:10,150
MORYOMARU: (VOICEOVER)
The wound that Sesshomaru

445
00:19:10,184 --> 00:19:11,050
gave me is reopening!

446
00:19:14,984 --> 00:19:16,850
-Can you move now, wolf boy?

447
00:19:16,884 --> 00:19:17,550
-Yeah.

448
00:19:17,584 --> 00:19:18,817
What choice do I have?

449
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:21,250
-Good. 'Cause I'm not planning
to wait around for you.

450
00:19:21,284 --> 00:19:22,050
You got that?

451
00:19:22,084 --> 00:19:23,817
-Yeah, well, right back at you.

452
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:26,450
INUYASHA: Come on,
Dragon Scale Tetsusaiga!

453
00:19:26,484 --> 00:19:27,917
-One more time, Goraishi!

454
00:19:31,884 --> 00:19:33,350
-No! ow can this be?

455
00:19:33,384 --> 00:19:34,650
-Nice work, pup.

456
00:19:34,684 --> 00:19:36,717
Now, I want you to attack
the same spot as last time,

457
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,684
then I'll deliver
the finishing blow.

458
00:19:38,717 --> 00:19:41,350
-Don't you get carried
away, wolf boy.

459
00:19:41,384 --> 00:19:42,417
-Bring it on, pup.

460
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,017
-You didn't look so
tough when Moryomaru

461
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,350
had you strung up by your legs.

462
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,250
-I don't remember
asking for help!

463
00:19:47,284 --> 00:19:48,117
-You're both strong!

464
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:48,784
-He's right.

465
00:19:48,817 --> 00:19:49,850
You're both strong.

466
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:51,650
-Just get it over with
and work together!

467
00:19:51,684 --> 00:19:53,284
-In situations
like these, someone

468
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:56,150
needs to be the bigger man.

469
00:19:56,184 --> 00:19:58,050
-Take this!

470
00:19:58,084 --> 00:20:03,284
[shouting]

471
00:20:03,317 --> 00:20:05,250
INUYASHA: (VOICEOVER)
My hands are burning.

472
00:20:05,284 --> 00:20:07,284
I can barely hold onto
Tetsusaiga anymore.

473
00:20:07,317 --> 00:20:09,284
It's like I can feel the
demonic energy passing

474
00:20:09,317 --> 00:20:10,984
through the blade.

475
00:20:11,017 --> 00:20:12,484
Gonna finish you!

476
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:18,984
Ah!

477
00:20:23,217 --> 00:20:24,217
-You OK, pup?

478
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:28,084
Dammit.

479
00:20:28,117 --> 00:20:30,084
He got away.

480
00:20:30,117 --> 00:20:31,284
-Inuyasha!

481
00:20:31,317 --> 00:20:32,384
Hang in there.

482
00:20:32,417 --> 00:20:33,317
Huh?

483
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:35,584
Who are you?

484
00:20:35,617 --> 00:20:37,217
-I am Byakuya.

485
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,850
Byakuya of the dreams.

486
00:20:38,884 --> 00:20:42,384
I must say, that Dragon Scale
Tetsusaiga is most impressive.

487
00:20:42,417 --> 00:20:46,050
Even Moryomaru had to run away
with his tail between his legs.

488
00:20:46,084 --> 00:20:47,517
Although I assure
you, it would've

489
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,850
been Inuyasha running if
there had been one more of us

490
00:20:49,884 --> 00:20:50,784
involved.

491
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:52,084
-You mean if you'd
been involved.

492
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:53,217
Is that what you're saying?

493
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,050
-Not another step!

494
00:20:54,084 --> 00:20:56,550
I won't let you touch Inuyasha.

495
00:20:56,584 --> 00:20:58,150
-You misunderstand me.

496
00:20:58,184 --> 00:21:00,650
My role is merely to
observe, nothing more.

497
00:21:00,684 --> 00:21:03,217
At least for the time being.

498
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,750
So long.

499
00:21:05,784 --> 00:21:09,117
-That one sure gives
me the creeps, dammit.

500
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,717
-Koga, do you know
who that guy is?

501
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,650
-The latest
incarnation of Naraku.

502
00:21:12,684 --> 00:21:15,117
-I thought so.

503
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,084
Inuyasha!

504
00:21:16,117 --> 00:21:19,517
Pull yourself together.

505
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,150
-(VOICEOVER) Tetsusaiga.

506
00:21:21,184 --> 00:21:23,017
I don't understand.

507
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,217
What happened to you?

508
00:21:32,017 --> 00:21:35,150
-I watched the entire spectacle
from the sidelines, as ordered.

509
00:21:35,184 --> 00:21:36,217
-Imagine that.

510
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,384
A sword that injures its
user with every swing.

511
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:40,784
Fascinating.

512
00:21:40,817 --> 00:21:43,417
-Are you sure I shouldn't have
just finished him off myself?

513
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:44,917
Or perhaps you would
rather have him

514
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:48,017
use that sword to
kill Moryomaru?

515
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:50,217
-Will Inuyasha be
destroyed by his own sword,

516
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,050
his beloved Tetsusaiga?

517
00:21:52,084 --> 00:21:55,150
Or will he manage to find
Moryomaru and kill him first?

518
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,750
I can't wait to find out.

519
00:22:09,011 --> 00:22:14,845
[theme music]

520
00:23:44,845 --> 00:23:46,845
KAGOME: Moryomaru
attacks Kinka and Ginka.

521
00:23:46,878 --> 00:23:49,845
Then Sesshomaru faces
off against Moryomaru.

522
00:23:49,878 --> 00:23:52,078
Meanwhile, we find
a way for Inuyasha

523
00:23:52,111 --> 00:23:53,678
to cope with
Tetsusaiga's new ability

524
00:23:53,711 --> 00:23:55,211
to absorb demonic energy.

525
00:23:55,245 --> 00:23:57,178
-The Great Holy Demon Spirit?

526
00:23:57,211 --> 00:23:59,345
-He's the demon equivalent
of a wise old hermit.

527
00:23:59,378 --> 00:24:02,011
If you Always to master the
Dragon Scale Tetsusaiga,

528
00:24:02,045 --> 00:24:04,245
you have no choice but
to train under him.

529
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:06,911
INUYASHA: Next time on
Inuyasha, The Final Act,

530
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,345
The Great Holy
Demon Spirit's Test.

531
00:24:08,378 --> 00:24:11,545
-I'll train you well, Inuyasha.
