00:01:44,282 --> 00:01:47,082
KANNA: As I pass through
the lengthy struggle of life

3
00:01:47,115 --> 00:01:52,015
in this fleeting world, I cannot
help but long for the midnight

4
00:01:52,048 --> 00:01:54,482
moon I once saw.

5
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:56,948
-Do not let him escape, Kagura.

[roar]

00:02:22,815 --> 00:02:25,082
KAGURA: (VOICEOVER)
He's consuming them.

8
00:02:25,115 --> 00:02:26,082
-Hey, Goryomaru.

9
00:02:26,115 --> 00:02:27,982
What exactly are you?

10
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:30,315
And why has Naraku
imprisoned you in here?

11
00:02:30,348 --> 00:02:32,282
HAKUDOSHI: If you truly
wish to know the answer

12
00:02:32,315 --> 00:02:34,848
to your questions,
then release him.

13
00:02:34,882 --> 00:02:36,915
-Hakudoshi.

14
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:39,748
-You too afraid of
Naraku to follow through.

15
00:02:39,782 --> 00:02:42,715
-I suppose you have no
fear of betraying Naraku.

16
00:02:42,748 --> 00:02:44,348
GORYOMARU: Enough of this.

17
00:02:44,382 --> 00:02:47,382
The time has come for you
to make a choice, Kagura.

18
00:02:47,415 --> 00:02:49,015
Will you die as a
slave to Naraku,

19
00:02:49,048 --> 00:02:51,815
or will you escape with
me and have your freedom?

20
00:02:51,848 --> 00:02:53,115
-What?

21
00:02:53,148 --> 00:02:54,048
Freedom?

22
00:02:54,082 --> 00:02:54,548
-Yes.

23
00:02:54,582 --> 00:02:55,648
Freedoom.

24
00:02:55,682 --> 00:02:58,248
If you truly desire
liberation from Naraku,

25
00:02:58,282 --> 00:03:01,682
then you must destroy him.

26
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:03,382
KAGURA: (VOICEOVER)
Originally, these two

27
00:03:03,415 --> 00:03:07,482
came from Naraku's heart, which
he removed at Mount Hakurei.

28
00:03:07,515 --> 00:03:10,382
Afterwards, that strane
monk split it in two,

29
00:03:10,415 --> 00:03:12,548
leaving Hakudoshi
and the infant.

30
00:03:12,582 --> 00:03:15,348
-I assure you, when
the time comes,

31
00:03:15,382 --> 00:03:18,782
I will return your heart to
you before I obliterate Naraku.

32
00:03:18,815 --> 00:03:19,682
-Huh.

33
00:03:19,715 --> 00:03:21,048
And?

34
00:03:21,082 --> 00:03:25,015
What do you expect me to do once
Goryomaru has been released?

35
00:03:25,048 --> 00:03:27,848
-We still lack the necessary
power to overcome him.

36
00:03:27,882 --> 00:03:30,415
And there's only
way to attain it.

37
00:03:30,448 --> 00:03:31,482
-Now I see.

38
00:03:31,515 --> 00:03:32,982
You need jewel shards.

39
00:03:33,015 --> 00:03:34,715
Right?

40
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:36,248
INUYASHA: (VOICEOVER)
Naraku's Heart.

41
00:03:45,648 --> 00:03:47,348
-Close enough for you, Miroku?

42
00:03:47,382 --> 00:03:48,115
-Wow.

43
00:03:48,148 --> 00:03:49,715
That's fantastic.

44
00:03:49,748 --> 00:03:52,182
You look like me
from every angle.

45
00:03:52,215 --> 00:03:54,682
Now, you've just got to hang
around Sango in that form,

46
00:03:54,715 --> 00:03:55,415
all right?

47
00:03:55,448 --> 00:03:56,682
-Seriously?

48
00:03:56,715 --> 00:03:58,915
You mean the whole time
Inuyasha's at Kagome's house?

49
00:03:58,948 --> 00:03:59,982
-Yes.

50
00:04:00,015 --> 00:04:03,148
I'm going to spread
my wings for a bit.

51
00:04:03,182 --> 00:04:04,215
Ah!

52
00:04:04,248 --> 00:04:06,382
-He threatened me
with his Wind Tunnel!

53
00:04:06,415 --> 00:04:06,882
-So typical.

54
00:04:11,615 --> 00:04:13,215
-(VOICEOVER) Aw, I don't get it.

55
00:04:13,248 --> 00:04:14,882
I just don't get it.

56
00:04:14,915 --> 00:04:17,382
I don't even know what
I'm not getting anymore.

57
00:04:17,415 --> 00:04:18,915
-She's taking
another make-up exam?

58
00:04:18,948 --> 00:04:19,915
-Yeah.

59
00:04:19,948 --> 00:04:21,815
She's got tons of
catching up to do.

60
00:04:21,848 --> 00:04:23,982
-I just hope she's ready
for entrance exams.

61
00:04:24,015 --> 00:04:24,782
Huh?

62
00:04:24,815 --> 00:04:25,282
Hey.

63
00:04:25,315 --> 00:04:25,982
-Whoa.

64
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,448
What are you doing here?

65
00:04:27,482 --> 00:04:28,082
-(VOICEOVER) OK.

66
00:04:28,115 --> 00:04:29,348
You know you know this.

67
00:04:29,382 --> 00:04:31,615
I'm positive this question's
from the study guide.

68
00:04:31,648 --> 00:04:32,215
Got it.

69
00:04:32,248 --> 00:04:33,982
I can do this!

70
00:04:34,015 --> 00:04:36,382
-So, did you come
to pick up Kagome?

71
00:04:36,415 --> 00:04:37,548
-That's so sweet.

72
00:04:37,582 --> 00:04:38,048
-Yeah.

73
00:04:38,082 --> 00:04:38,715
I know.

74
00:04:38,748 --> 00:04:39,548
-(VOICEOVER) Focus.

75
00:04:39,582 --> 00:04:41,915
I'm so close to solving this!

76
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:42,415
Huh?

77
00:04:45,415 --> 00:04:46,948
-I think I just
heard something snap.

78
00:04:46,982 --> 00:04:49,182
-That's the sound of
broken concentration.

79
00:04:49,215 --> 00:04:51,482
-Yeah, I've heard that before.

80
00:04:51,515 --> 00:04:52,382
-Sit, boy!

81
00:04:52,415 --> 00:04:53,415
-Ah!

82
00:04:53,448 --> 00:04:55,982
Kagome, what the
hell was that for?

83
00:04:56,015 --> 00:04:58,882
-I specifically told
you to wait at home!

84
00:04:58,915 --> 00:05:00,748
-I couldn't just sit
around there all day.

85
00:05:00,782 --> 00:05:03,615
-I was trying my best to get out
of here as quickly as possible.

86
00:05:03,648 --> 00:05:06,415
But then you-- you
distracted me and made

87
00:05:06,448 --> 00:05:07,948
me forget all the
equations that I

88
00:05:07,982 --> 00:05:10,015
was getting very
close to remembering.

89
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:12,015
-Glad I'm not in
his place right now.

90
00:05:12,048 --> 00:05:13,048
-No kidding.

91
00:05:13,082 --> 00:05:15,115
Look how she uses
fear to control him.

92
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,815
-You didn't get one right.

93
00:05:16,848 --> 00:05:19,382
You'll be lucky if can find
a school that will take you.

94
00:05:21,882 --> 00:05:24,748
GIRL: Are you OK, Kagome?

95
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:25,748
[sigh]

96
00:05:25,782 --> 00:05:27,115
-Heh.

97
00:05:27,148 --> 00:05:29,348
I bet you're glad I came to
get you at school now, huh?

98
00:05:29,382 --> 00:05:31,582
-They're so lovey-dovey.

99
00:05:31,615 --> 00:05:32,882
-We'll be going now.

100
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:33,748
You two have fun.

101
00:05:33,782 --> 00:05:35,048
-See ya.

102
00:05:35,082 --> 00:05:36,948
-Uh-- wait a sec.

103
00:05:40,315 --> 00:05:42,048
Oh, well.

104
00:05:42,082 --> 00:05:43,415
I'm home!

105
00:05:43,448 --> 00:05:44,948
MRS. HIGURASHI:
Welcome home, Kagome.

106
00:05:44,982 --> 00:05:46,848
Oh.

107
00:05:46,882 --> 00:05:49,048
-You just got home,
and you're leaving?

108
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,682
-I see you're restless as usual.

109
00:05:50,715 --> 00:05:52,215
-It won't get in
the way of studying.

110
00:05:52,248 --> 00:05:53,182
I promise.

111
00:05:53,215 --> 00:05:54,715
-Let's go, Kagome.

112
00:05:54,748 --> 00:05:56,248
-Bye.

113
00:05:56,282 --> 00:05:57,615
-Goodbye, sweetheart.

114
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:00,282
Take care of yourself.

115
00:06:00,315 --> 00:06:02,915
-Hey, Kagome, you want me
to take care of these school

116
00:06:02,948 --> 00:06:04,682
and entrance exam
things for you?

117
00:06:04,715 --> 00:06:05,948
Just show me where to find 'em.

118
00:06:05,982 --> 00:06:08,115
-This isn't something
you can take care of.

119
00:06:08,148 --> 00:06:09,248
-Yeah, right.

120
00:06:09,282 --> 00:06:10,348
You're saying I can't
take a couple of demons

121
00:06:10,382 --> 00:06:11,682
with stupid names like that?

122
00:06:11,715 --> 00:06:14,782
That's like saying I can't
take a weakling like Jaken.

123
00:06:14,815 --> 00:06:16,448
-Ah-choo!

124
00:06:16,482 --> 00:06:18,782
-Master Jaken, are you sick?

125
00:06:18,815 --> 00:06:21,182
-No, but I have the
overwhelming sensation

126
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:22,915
that someone is
talking about me.

127
00:06:22,948 --> 00:06:23,648
SESSHOMARU: Jaken.

128
00:06:23,682 --> 00:06:24,748
-Huh?

129
00:06:24,782 --> 00:06:26,715
-Have there been any
changes in the crystal?

130
00:06:26,748 --> 00:06:27,648
-Not at all.

131
00:06:27,682 --> 00:06:29,482
I can still sense
a demonic aura,

132
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:32,082
which can only mean that
we're not near the Fuyoheki

133
00:06:32,115 --> 00:06:34,182
that Naraku uses to
conceal his heart.

134
00:06:34,215 --> 00:06:36,148
And of course, that begs
the obvious question--

135
00:06:36,182 --> 00:06:37,348
[singing]

136
00:06:37,382 --> 00:06:38,682
-If it's not around here,
then where could it be?

137
00:06:38,715 --> 00:06:40,382
RIN: (SINGING) Now
he's been left behind.

138
00:06:40,415 --> 00:06:41,348
-Huh?

139
00:06:41,382 --> 00:06:42,815
Hey, aren't you
forgetting someone?

140
00:06:51,215 --> 00:06:52,182
-Oh!

141
00:06:52,215 --> 00:06:53,148
Hang on.

142
00:06:53,182 --> 00:06:53,948
-Huh?

143
00:06:53,982 --> 00:06:55,015
-I knew I brought too many.

144
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:56,982
I should have left some at home.

145
00:06:57,015 --> 00:06:58,782
INUYASHA: Just what
we need right now.

146
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,482
-Feel free give me a hand.

147
00:07:00,515 --> 00:07:02,482
Huh?

148
00:07:02,515 --> 00:07:03,915
Saimyosho!

149
00:07:03,948 --> 00:07:04,415
-Naraku!

150
00:07:08,015 --> 00:07:09,582
-What a nice surprise.

151
00:07:09,615 --> 00:07:11,148
You dropped out of
sight for so long,

152
00:07:11,182 --> 00:07:13,382
I was beginning to
worry about you.

153
00:07:13,415 --> 00:07:14,615
-Hakudoshi!

154
00:07:14,648 --> 00:07:15,448
[scream]

155
00:07:15,482 --> 00:07:15,948
-Kagome!

156
00:07:19,115 --> 00:07:22,048
-The Shikon jewel shard!

157
00:07:22,082 --> 00:07:24,682
-Hold on, Kagome!

158
00:07:24,715 --> 00:07:26,615
-Remember not to use
your Wind Tunnel, Miroku.

159
00:07:26,648 --> 00:07:28,615
The Saimyosho will poison you.

160
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:31,615
-Not to mention you'll
suck in the jewel shard.

161
00:07:31,648 --> 00:07:33,415
-Now that I have
the jewel shard,

162
00:07:33,448 --> 00:07:35,682
I no longer have any
business with you.

163
00:07:35,715 --> 00:07:37,882
-You won't get away that easy.

164
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:40,782
Wind Scar!

165
00:07:40,815 --> 00:07:42,248
-Farewell.

166
00:07:42,282 --> 00:07:42,782
-Damn!

167
00:07:42,815 --> 00:07:43,982
He got away.

168
00:07:44,015 --> 00:07:45,048
-It's OK.

169
00:07:45,082 --> 00:07:46,848
I can sense the
Shikon jewel shard.

170
00:07:46,882 --> 00:07:48,682
We'll find him.

171
00:07:48,715 --> 00:07:49,648
[heavy breathing]

172
00:07:49,682 --> 00:07:51,048
BOY: Wait up, Koga!

173
00:07:51,082 --> 00:07:52,482
-Not a chance!

174
00:07:52,515 --> 00:07:54,782
-But why are you
in such a hurry?

175
00:07:54,815 --> 00:07:59,615
-Because I smell something
real shady around here.

176
00:07:59,648 --> 00:08:02,082
-At last, the Shikon
jewel shards have arrived.

177
00:08:07,382 --> 00:08:10,715
[scream]

178
00:08:10,748 --> 00:08:12,182
[roar]

179
00:08:31,682 --> 00:08:34,715
MALE VOICE: Kohaku, go
and hunt strong demons.

180
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:35,215
-Huh?

181
00:08:42,215 --> 00:08:43,815
That must be the
demon's true form.

182
00:08:47,648 --> 00:08:49,448
Huh?

183
00:08:49,482 --> 00:08:49,948
Gotcha!

184
00:08:54,482 --> 00:08:55,948
-What is it, Taichi?

185
00:08:55,982 --> 00:08:56,448
Huh?

186
00:08:56,482 --> 00:08:56,948
-Father--

187
00:09:00,148 --> 00:09:01,282
-You OK?

188
00:09:01,315 --> 00:09:02,548
That's a pretty nasty cut.

189
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:08,982
Does it still hurt?

190
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:09,748
-No.

191
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:12,715
It feels a lot better.

192
00:09:12,748 --> 00:09:14,382
-That should do it.

193
00:09:14,415 --> 00:09:15,382
-Thank you.

194
00:09:15,415 --> 00:09:16,148
Huh?

195
00:09:16,182 --> 00:09:17,282
Oh!

196
00:09:17,315 --> 00:09:18,582
(VOICEOVER) He's been
possessed by the demon.

197
00:09:22,515 --> 00:09:23,115
-Taichi!

198
00:09:23,148 --> 00:09:23,582
-No!

199
00:09:23,615 --> 00:09:24,115
Stay back!

200
00:09:28,082 --> 00:09:32,015
Father-- Stop!

201
00:09:32,048 --> 00:09:33,682
-My son-- it's me!

202
00:09:33,715 --> 00:09:35,082
-He can't hear you now.

203
00:09:35,115 --> 00:09:38,115
That thing's controlling him.

204
00:09:38,148 --> 00:09:39,148
-Taichi!

205
00:09:39,182 --> 00:09:40,648
-Don't worry, I'll
bring him back to you.

206
00:09:44,682 --> 00:09:46,448
I won't let this kid
end up like I did.

207
00:09:46,482 --> 00:09:47,982
I won't allow it to happen!

208
00:09:52,348 --> 00:09:54,715
-Huh?

209
00:09:54,748 --> 00:09:55,715
KAGURA: Dance of Blades!

210
00:10:00,148 --> 00:10:00,748
Hello.

211
00:10:00,782 --> 00:10:01,882
-Kagura.

212
00:10:01,915 --> 00:10:04,748
-I've learned the location
of Naraku's heart.

213
00:10:04,782 --> 00:10:05,248
-Really?

214
00:10:05,282 --> 00:10:05,882
You did?

215
00:10:05,915 --> 00:10:07,048
-Yes.

216
00:10:07,082 --> 00:10:10,782
However, Kohaku, you stand
no chance against it.

217
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:13,648
Because you will die here!

218
00:10:13,682 --> 00:10:14,148
-Whoa!

219
00:10:24,698 --> 00:10:25,531
-Nicely done!

220
00:10:25,565 --> 00:10:26,298
-He got it?

221
00:10:26,331 --> 00:10:27,698
KOGA: (VOICEOVER) Damn!

222
00:10:27,731 --> 00:10:30,598
He just keeps regenerating, no
matter how many times I attack.

223
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:31,998
Just like Naraku.

224
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:32,498
Wait.

225
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:33,331
That's it.

226
00:10:33,365 --> 00:10:35,265
Now I know what smelled shady.

227
00:10:35,298 --> 00:10:37,398
You're one Naraku's
allies, aren't you?

228
00:10:37,431 --> 00:10:38,765
-And so what if I am?

229
00:10:38,798 --> 00:10:39,998
-I'll kill you!

230
00:10:40,031 --> 00:10:41,798
This is for my pack, bastard!

231
00:10:44,565 --> 00:10:45,865
[laughter]

232
00:10:45,898 --> 00:10:49,298
-No, I'll kill you, and
take your jewel shards.

233
00:10:53,531 --> 00:10:53,998
What?

234
00:10:57,965 --> 00:11:00,231
You and I aren't finished.

235
00:11:00,265 --> 00:11:02,565
-You're damn right
we're not finished!

236
00:11:02,598 --> 00:11:04,198
-Was that the sacred arrow?

237
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:06,098
-You mean Miss Kagome?

238
00:11:06,131 --> 00:11:06,931
-Not her.

239
00:11:11,365 --> 00:11:13,298
-I can't believe how
much spiritual power

240
00:11:13,331 --> 00:11:15,198
I lost with just one shot.

241
00:11:15,231 --> 00:11:17,998
But that Moryomaru demon
appears to be a lot different

242
00:11:18,031 --> 00:11:19,365
than the last time I saw it.

243
00:11:19,398 --> 00:11:21,465
It's as though he's
acquired a soul.

244
00:11:26,398 --> 00:11:28,498
-If you know where
Naraku's heart is,

245
00:11:28,531 --> 00:11:30,065
then you've got to tell me!

246
00:11:30,098 --> 00:11:34,765
-I'll need your Shikon
jewel shard first, boy!

247
00:11:34,798 --> 00:11:37,098
You'll die once I
take your shard.

248
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:39,865
If you cooperate, I
promise to make it quick.

249
00:11:43,798 --> 00:11:45,198
There's nowhere to run.

250
00:11:45,231 --> 00:11:46,531
Are you prepared to die?

251
00:11:46,565 --> 00:11:48,865
-I've been prepared to
die for a long time now,

252
00:11:48,898 --> 00:11:51,898
but I have no intention
of dying here.

253
00:11:51,931 --> 00:11:53,531
If you need a
shard so badly, you

254
00:11:53,565 --> 00:11:55,831
can take me there and
present me as an offering.

255
00:11:55,865 --> 00:11:59,331
Then at least I can plunge
my blade into Naraku's heart,

256
00:11:59,365 --> 00:12:02,665
even if it costs me my life.

257
00:12:02,698 --> 00:12:04,198
Isn't that the
reason you gave me

258
00:12:04,231 --> 00:12:07,065
this crystal in the
first place, Kagura?

259
00:12:07,098 --> 00:12:10,031
I may have been under Naraku's
control at the time-- Father!

260
00:12:10,065 --> 00:12:14,365
But it was still me who
killed my father and comrades.

261
00:12:14,398 --> 00:12:14,931
-That way!

262
00:12:14,965 --> 00:12:15,898
Don't worry.

263
00:12:15,931 --> 00:12:18,298
I can tell Hakudoshi
isn't far off.

264
00:12:18,331 --> 00:12:19,065
Huh?

265
00:12:19,098 --> 00:12:20,165
-What is it?

266
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:22,131
-I just sensed another
Shikon jewel shard.

267
00:12:22,165 --> 00:12:23,365
-Another shard?

268
00:12:23,398 --> 00:12:24,065
-Koga?

269
00:12:24,098 --> 00:12:24,931
KAGOME: No.

270
00:12:24,965 --> 00:12:26,965
This one feels different.

271
00:12:26,998 --> 00:12:28,731
-Is it Kohaku?

272
00:12:28,765 --> 00:12:31,765
-I committed many evil acts
under Naraku's control.

273
00:12:31,798 --> 00:12:34,798
I killed my family and caused
my only sister great injury

274
00:12:34,831 --> 00:12:36,431
and overwhelming grief.

275
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:39,398
However, I kept myself
alive the entire time.

276
00:12:39,431 --> 00:12:41,698
-All for the sake
of revenge, huh?

277
00:12:41,731 --> 00:12:42,231
-Yes.

278
00:12:42,265 --> 00:12:43,365
It's my duty.

279
00:12:43,398 --> 00:12:46,198
And I must fulfill
it before I die.

280
00:12:46,231 --> 00:12:48,098
It's the only way I
can make up for what

281
00:12:48,131 --> 00:12:51,331
I did to my father and comrades.

282
00:12:51,365 --> 00:12:53,165
-It's useless, Kohaku.

283
00:12:53,198 --> 00:12:56,431
Can't you see it doesn't
matter how determined you are?

284
00:12:56,465 --> 00:12:58,331
Your blade will never
be enough to overcome

285
00:12:58,365 --> 00:13:01,298
Naraku, the infant,
or Hakudoshi.

286
00:13:01,331 --> 00:13:06,898
In the end, you're doomed to
lose your shard and your life.

287
00:13:06,931 --> 00:13:09,265
-Exactly right.

288
00:13:09,298 --> 00:13:10,565
-Kagura.

289
00:13:10,598 --> 00:13:12,865
-(VOICEOVER) As for me,
my loyalty now lies with

290
00:13:12,898 --> 00:13:15,398
the infant, rather than Naraku.

291
00:13:15,431 --> 00:13:17,298
There's no such thing
as true freedom.

292
00:13:17,331 --> 00:13:18,465
-Please, Kagura.

293
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:20,198
You must take me to his heart.

294
00:13:20,231 --> 00:13:21,598
If you don't, I'll go alone.

295
00:13:24,865 --> 00:13:25,498
No!

296
00:13:25,531 --> 00:13:26,698
What are you doing?

297
00:13:26,731 --> 00:13:27,831
-There.

298
00:13:27,865 --> 00:13:30,298
Now you've lost the means
to find Naraku's heart.

299
00:13:30,331 --> 00:13:31,565
-Kagura-- why?

300
00:13:31,598 --> 00:13:33,098
-Shut up and go!

301
00:13:33,131 --> 00:13:36,365
Run away before you lose your
shard and your life, you fool.

302
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:39,765
-Such an untrustworthy woman.

303
00:13:39,798 --> 00:13:43,498
You intend to betray Naraku,
and then betray us, too?

304
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,331
-Run, Kohaku!

305
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,065
-But--

306
00:13:45,098 --> 00:13:46,398
-I said run!

307
00:13:49,031 --> 00:13:52,531
Kohaku, try not to hurt
yourself on the way down.

308
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:53,465
-Kagura!

309
00:13:53,498 --> 00:13:55,398
-He won't get away.

310
00:13:55,431 --> 00:13:56,798
-Dance of the Dragon!

311
00:14:00,831 --> 00:14:02,898
-Kagura, how'd you like
to taste your own blades?

312
00:14:02,931 --> 00:14:04,331
See how you like them?

313
00:14:07,298 --> 00:14:07,931
[gasp]

314
00:14:07,965 --> 00:14:08,698
INUYASHA: Wind Scar!

315
00:14:13,598 --> 00:14:14,331
-Inuyasha!

316
00:14:14,365 --> 00:14:15,965
-What the hell's going on?

317
00:14:15,998 --> 00:14:18,331
I thought you and Hakudoshi
were on the same side.

318
00:14:18,365 --> 00:14:20,831
-What makes you think
it's any of your business?

319
00:14:20,865 --> 00:14:22,598
-Sango, you'd better
go after Kohaku.

320
00:14:22,631 --> 00:14:23,565
-Got it.

321
00:14:23,598 --> 00:14:26,465
Let's go, Kirara.

322
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,698
-Adamant Barrage!

323
00:14:28,731 --> 00:14:31,565
-I can still sense
the shard, you guys.

324
00:14:31,598 --> 00:14:34,498
He must still be
in the vicinity.

325
00:14:34,531 --> 00:14:37,798
-Shouldn't you be a bit
more careful, Inuyasha?

326
00:14:37,831 --> 00:14:41,198
-I will split you in half
if you try anything funny.

327
00:14:41,231 --> 00:14:43,531
-Listen up, I want you tell
us everything you know.

328
00:14:43,565 --> 00:14:45,631
You might as well do it
while you have the chance.

329
00:14:45,665 --> 00:14:48,098
Hakdoshi's not going anywhere
until he's finished you off.

330
00:14:48,131 --> 00:14:49,465
-True.

331
00:14:49,498 --> 00:14:54,065
He doesn't want me to reveal
the location of Naraku's heart.

332
00:14:54,098 --> 00:14:56,465
Here he comes.

333
00:14:56,498 --> 00:14:58,298
-It's Goryomaru.

334
00:14:58,331 --> 00:15:00,065
He's still alive?

335
00:15:00,098 --> 00:15:02,065
-Who's responsible for
those who injuries?

336
00:15:02,098 --> 00:15:03,898
-None of that matters right now.

337
00:15:09,398 --> 00:15:09,865
-Huh?

338
00:15:12,898 --> 00:15:16,331
-I have come to get
the Shikon jewel shard.

339
00:15:16,365 --> 00:15:18,831
-Goryomaru is Moryomaru?

340
00:15:18,865 --> 00:15:19,765
-Use this

341
00:15:19,798 --> 00:15:22,231
KAGOME: A Shikon jewel shard!

342
00:15:22,265 --> 00:15:24,065
HAKUDOSHI: I'll take
care of these ones.

343
00:15:24,098 --> 00:15:27,798
You need to go and
find that other shard.

344
00:15:27,831 --> 00:15:29,131
-Your'e not going anywhere!

345
00:15:36,165 --> 00:15:38,531
Hakudoshi!

346
00:15:38,565 --> 00:15:40,431
An illusion?

347
00:15:40,465 --> 00:15:41,365
-Traitor.

348
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,498
-Huh?

349
00:15:42,531 --> 00:15:45,198
-Did you really believe
I would let you escape?

350
00:15:45,231 --> 00:15:46,931
-Get back here!

351
00:15:46,965 --> 00:15:47,698
Bastard!

352
00:15:47,731 --> 00:15:48,465
-Go on.

353
00:15:48,498 --> 00:15:50,065
What are you waiting for?

354
00:15:50,098 --> 00:15:51,931
Is it Kagura?

355
00:15:51,965 --> 00:15:53,431
-(VOICEOVER) he won't do it?

356
00:15:53,465 --> 00:15:55,598
What a pathetic fool.

357
00:15:55,631 --> 00:15:56,698
-I'm surprised.

358
00:15:56,731 --> 00:16:00,065
I didn't think I could
use you as a shield.

359
00:16:00,098 --> 00:16:01,465
-Fool!

360
00:16:01,498 --> 00:16:04,031
We don't have much
time, so listen up.

361
00:16:04,065 --> 00:16:06,831
Naraku's heart, the infant,
is inside Moryomaru.

362
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:08,231
-What?

363
00:16:08,265 --> 00:16:10,898
-Hakudoshi and the infant intend
to empower Moryomaru and have

364
00:16:10,931 --> 00:16:12,165
him overthrow Naraku.

365
00:16:12,198 --> 00:16:15,265
-An impressive
deduction, Kagura.

366
00:16:15,298 --> 00:16:17,298
It was a grave
mistake for Naraku

367
00:16:17,331 --> 00:16:19,231
to release his heart that day.

368
00:16:19,265 --> 00:16:22,665
He entrusted the Fuyoheki to the
infant to keep his heart safe,

369
00:16:22,698 --> 00:16:25,498
knowing it would conceal
its demonic aura.

370
00:16:25,531 --> 00:16:28,031
That gave the infant an idea.

371
00:16:28,065 --> 00:16:31,265
To create a durable
armor to protect himself.

372
00:16:31,298 --> 00:16:35,331
And that armor is Moryomaru, who
swallowed the dead Goryomaru.

373
00:16:35,365 --> 00:16:38,165
It was at that point
that we realized,

374
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:40,798
Naraku without his heart
is but an empty shell.

375
00:16:40,831 --> 00:16:43,931
The infant and I
are the real thing.

376
00:16:43,965 --> 00:16:46,798
And one day soon,
we'll overthrow him.

377
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:48,498
-Naraku has been
aware of your plot

378
00:16:48,531 --> 00:16:50,431
from the very beginning, fool.

379
00:16:50,465 --> 00:16:51,798
-No doubt.

380
00:16:51,831 --> 00:16:54,465
But if I were you, I'd be more
concerned about my own fate

381
00:16:54,498 --> 00:16:55,598
right now.

382
00:16:55,631 --> 00:16:57,898
After all, we may
both be traitors,

383
00:16:57,931 --> 00:17:00,698
but it is your
heart Naraku holds.

384
00:17:00,731 --> 00:17:02,431
It's hopeless for you.

385
00:17:02,465 --> 00:17:04,298
No matter what,
you'll never be free.

386
00:17:04,331 --> 00:17:05,798
-Shut up!

387
00:17:05,831 --> 00:17:07,831
-You can rip my body to pieces.

388
00:17:07,865 --> 00:17:09,898
I still won't die.

389
00:17:09,931 --> 00:17:10,865
Nobody can kill me.

390
00:17:10,898 --> 00:17:13,265
Not even Naraku himself.

391
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:15,165
[laughter]

392
00:17:15,198 --> 00:17:15,665
-What?

393
00:17:18,565 --> 00:17:19,831
-Take this!

394
00:17:19,865 --> 00:17:20,331
Wind Scar!

395
00:17:24,231 --> 00:17:25,031
-Right.

396
00:17:25,065 --> 00:17:26,531
-You're using your Wind Tunnel?

397
00:17:26,565 --> 00:17:29,731
-Too late.

398
00:17:29,765 --> 00:17:30,531
Hold on.

399
00:17:30,565 --> 00:17:31,965
Why aren't they protecting me?

400
00:17:31,998 --> 00:17:32,765
KAGURA: Well, well.

401
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:34,731
Isn't this interesting?

402
00:17:34,765 --> 00:17:36,898
It looks like Naraku's
given up on you.

403
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:37,798
-Silence.

404
00:17:37,831 --> 00:17:41,031
I cannot be killed.

405
00:17:41,065 --> 00:17:41,598
-Look out!

406
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:44,398
-I'll purify it.

407
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:46,498
-I'm not like you, Kagura!

408
00:17:46,531 --> 00:17:49,398
I cannot be used up and
thrown away like that!

409
00:17:49,431 --> 00:17:51,398
-Run, Kagura!

410
00:17:51,431 --> 00:17:52,398
-I am--

411
00:17:52,431 --> 00:17:55,398
-Wind Tunnel!

412
00:17:55,431 --> 00:17:58,365
-I am his essence!

413
00:18:04,865 --> 00:18:06,631
-I have a very bad feeling.

414
00:18:06,665 --> 00:18:07,798
-Huh?

415
00:18:07,831 --> 00:18:10,165
-It's as if Naraku planned
for this to happen.

416
00:18:10,198 --> 00:18:11,665
-He probably did.

417
00:18:11,698 --> 00:18:12,998
It makes sense.

418
00:18:13,031 --> 00:18:15,798
Naraku decided to let us take
care of Hakudoshi for him.

419
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:22,165
-So, now what will you do?

420
00:18:22,198 --> 00:18:23,965
You could come with
us if you wanted.

421
00:18:23,998 --> 00:18:25,431
-No thanks.

422
00:18:25,465 --> 00:18:27,765
I can't go with
you, or with anyone.

423
00:18:27,798 --> 00:18:30,031
Anyway, you don't
have time to waste.

424
00:18:30,065 --> 00:18:32,898
It won't be long before
Moryomaru finds Kohaku.

425
00:18:32,931 --> 00:18:34,131
-She's got a point there.

426
00:18:34,165 --> 00:18:34,865
-Come on, Kagome.

427
00:18:34,898 --> 00:18:36,065
We have to go.

428
00:18:36,098 --> 00:18:37,665
-Y-- yeah.

429
00:18:37,698 --> 00:18:38,898
-Listen, Kagura.

430
00:18:38,931 --> 00:18:40,898
I'm going to make sure
that we get your heart back

431
00:18:40,931 --> 00:18:43,231
from Naraku, so
just hang in there.

432
00:18:43,265 --> 00:18:44,898
All right?

433
00:18:44,931 --> 00:18:46,265
-Who do you think
you're kidding?

434
00:18:49,331 --> 00:18:51,831
-Just promise me you won't
die before it happens!

435
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:53,065
You got that?

436
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:55,665
-I don't need you to tell
me to run for my life.

437
00:18:55,698 --> 00:18:58,165
I'll go as far as I have to.

438
00:18:58,198 --> 00:18:58,931
-(ECHOING) Kohaku!

439
00:19:02,065 --> 00:19:05,198
-Sister, please just keep going.

440
00:19:05,231 --> 00:19:06,131
Huh?

441
00:19:06,165 --> 00:19:08,798
Whoa!

442
00:19:08,831 --> 00:19:10,231
[laughter]

443
00:19:10,265 --> 00:19:13,031
-I can see what's in your heart.

444
00:19:13,065 --> 00:19:16,231
Haunted by the memories of
killing your own family.

445
00:19:16,265 --> 00:19:18,431
You seek atonement by
giving your own life.

446
00:19:18,465 --> 00:19:20,931
How very noble.

447
00:19:20,965 --> 00:19:23,231
Then you shall die for
the sake of your sister.

448
00:19:23,265 --> 00:19:26,131
For that woman will forget how
her brother killed her father

449
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,431
in cold blood.

450
00:19:27,465 --> 00:19:28,398
SANGO: Kohaku!

451
00:19:28,431 --> 00:19:31,065
-As long as you
live, both of you

452
00:19:31,098 --> 00:19:33,498
will continue to
suffer this torment.

453
00:19:33,531 --> 00:19:36,465
-Sister--

454
00:19:36,498 --> 00:19:38,431
SANGO: Hiraikotsu!

455
00:19:38,465 --> 00:19:38,931
-Huh?

456
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:43,031
-Stay away, sister!

457
00:19:43,065 --> 00:19:43,698
-Kohaku!

458
00:19:43,731 --> 00:19:45,298
So you do remember.

459
00:19:45,331 --> 00:19:48,365
-Your resistance is pointless.

460
00:19:48,398 --> 00:19:51,431
-You're the one who's fighting
a losing battle, Moryomaru.

461
00:19:51,465 --> 00:19:53,298
Or should I say, Naraku's heart?

462
00:19:53,331 --> 00:19:54,298
-Huh?

463
00:19:54,331 --> 00:19:56,265
-Now that we know
your identity, we'll

464
00:19:56,298 --> 00:19:58,298
never allow you to escape.

465
00:19:58,331 --> 00:19:59,798
Prepare yourself!

466
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:02,798
Adamant Barrage!

467
00:20:02,831 --> 00:20:05,398
You're gonna run away?

468
00:20:05,431 --> 00:20:07,465
-Inuyasha, it's only
a matter of time

469
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:11,898
before I absorb the demonic
power that's in your blade.

470
00:20:11,931 --> 00:20:12,798
-Huh?

471
00:20:12,831 --> 00:20:13,631
-Coward.

472
00:20:13,665 --> 00:20:15,298
-I can't sense the shard now.

473
00:20:15,331 --> 00:20:16,598
He got away.

474
00:20:16,631 --> 00:20:18,365
-That was close.

475
00:20:18,398 --> 00:20:19,165
SANGO: Kohaku?

476
00:20:19,198 --> 00:20:20,565
You recognize me, don't you?

477
00:20:20,598 --> 00:20:21,265
-Huh?

478
00:20:21,298 --> 00:20:22,365
-Tell me that you do.

479
00:20:22,398 --> 00:20:23,965
Tell me.

480
00:20:23,998 --> 00:20:25,265
-I remember.

481
00:20:25,298 --> 00:20:25,765
Everything.

482
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:34,165
From that day.

483
00:20:34,198 --> 00:20:37,498
And for that reason, I
can't stay with you, sister.

484
00:20:37,531 --> 00:20:38,231
-Kohaku--

485
00:20:38,265 --> 00:20:39,131
-Why not?

486
00:20:39,165 --> 00:20:40,998
I mean, you just got here.

487
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:41,931
-Kohaku!

488
00:20:41,965 --> 00:20:43,531
What will that accomplish, huh?

489
00:20:43,565 --> 00:20:45,065
You're just going
to go off and die?

490
00:20:45,098 --> 00:20:46,398
-Maybe.

491
00:20:46,431 --> 00:20:49,465
KAGOME: But it hurts
too much to be together.

492
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,865
-Kagome.

493
00:20:50,898 --> 00:20:53,465
-Being with Sango reminds
you of what you did, huh?

494
00:20:56,165 --> 00:20:57,465
She still loves you.

495
00:20:57,498 --> 00:20:59,765
For her, no one else in the
world could take your place.

496
00:21:02,865 --> 00:21:05,498
-I'm so sorry.

497
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:07,731
-Kohaku--

498
00:21:07,765 --> 00:21:09,865
-I guess even you
wouldn't be able to fill

499
00:21:09,898 --> 00:21:12,298
the void in Sango's
heart, Miroku.

500
00:21:12,331 --> 00:21:14,131
-I will have you know
that nobody could ever

501
00:21:14,165 --> 00:21:15,798
take my place, either.

502
00:21:15,831 --> 00:21:16,298
-Huh?

503
00:21:19,731 --> 00:21:20,598
-Lady Kikyo.

504
00:21:20,631 --> 00:21:22,498
-Are you in much pain?

505
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,665
-Don't worry.

506
00:21:23,698 --> 00:21:27,031
It's just a scratch.

507
00:21:27,065 --> 00:21:28,631
-M--m-- master, look!

508
00:21:28,665 --> 00:21:29,898
-Spirits?

509
00:21:29,931 --> 00:21:31,598
-She's looking straight at us!

510
00:21:31,631 --> 00:21:32,698
-So you can see me.

511
00:21:32,731 --> 00:21:34,565
How interesting.

512
00:21:34,598 --> 00:21:35,898
-Stay back!

513
00:21:35,931 --> 00:21:38,398
Begone, demon!

514
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:42,098
-I'm afraid your demon repelling
charms have no effect on me.

515
00:21:42,131 --> 00:21:42,831
-So sorry!

516
00:21:42,865 --> 00:21:43,765
Please don't kill me!

517
00:21:43,798 --> 00:21:44,998
-Spirits!

518
00:21:45,031 --> 00:21:46,498
-Somehow those two breached
Lady Kikyo's barrier.

519
00:21:46,531 --> 00:21:50,131
-I don't understand how
they got through it.

520
00:21:50,165 --> 00:21:51,465
Lady Kiyko?

521
00:21:51,498 --> 00:21:54,631
-(VOICEOVER) At this rate, I
won't be able to defeat Naraku

522
00:21:54,665 --> 00:21:55,965
before I--

523
00:21:55,998 --> 00:21:58,731
KANNA: As I pass though the
lengthy struggle of life

524
00:21:58,765 --> 00:22:03,398
in this fleeting world, I cannot
help but long for the midnight

525
00:22:03,431 --> 00:22:06,198
moon I once saw.

526
00:22:08,732 --> 00:22:13,632
[theme music]

527
00:23:45,566 --> 00:23:47,666
KAGOME: Kikyo attempts
to use Midoriko's soul

528
00:23:47,699 --> 00:23:50,199
to stay alive long
enough to destroy Naraku.

529
00:23:50,232 --> 00:23:52,566
Meanwhile, Koga tries
to obtain the Goraishi

530
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:53,966
from the grave of his ancestors.

531
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:56,899
With Hakudoshi now eliminated,
will Narkau's next target

532
00:23:56,932 --> 00:23:58,066
be Kagura?

533
00:23:58,099 --> 00:23:59,966
INUYASHA: I can
smell Kagura's blood.

534
00:23:59,999 --> 00:24:02,699
Naraku holds her heart!

535
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:07,032
Next time on Inuyasha, The
Final Act, Kagura's Wind.

536
00:24:07,066 --> 00:24:10,699
KAGURA: I am the
wind, the free wind.
