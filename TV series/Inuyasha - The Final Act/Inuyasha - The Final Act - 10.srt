[theme music]

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,394
-Flowers wither and
lose their color.

3
00:01:53,427 --> 00:01:58,394
Much as I reflect in vain
time lost to the long rain.

4
00:02:04,994 --> 00:02:05,894
Kagura.

5
00:02:05,927 --> 00:02:09,260
Are you free now?

6
00:02:09,294 --> 00:02:13,660
Did you ever become the wind?

7
00:02:13,694 --> 00:02:18,627
I-- I have nothing.

8
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,627
I have nothing.

9
00:02:37,627 --> 00:02:38,094
-Go!

10
00:02:43,627 --> 00:02:44,094
-What?

11
00:02:47,527 --> 00:02:49,560
It's still there.

12
00:02:49,594 --> 00:02:53,394
One speck of purity
within the Shikon jewel.

13
00:02:53,427 --> 00:02:57,094
Despite my efforts to defile
it, the stubborn point of light

14
00:02:57,127 --> 00:02:58,260
remains.

15
00:02:58,294 --> 00:03:01,827
And our last battle
powered Inuyasha's blade.

16
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,260
It could still cost me my life.

17
00:03:04,294 --> 00:03:05,694
Kikyo.

18
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:09,560
Even in death you
continue to haunt me.

19
00:03:09,594 --> 00:03:10,260
Damn you.

20

INUYASHA: (VOICEOVER)
Flowers Drenched in Sadness.

21
00:03:23,194 --> 00:03:24,594
-Ah.

22
00:03:24,627 --> 00:03:25,660
The sun's coming out.

23
00:03:25,694 --> 00:03:28,327
Shall we take a short break?

24
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,994
-Why don't you
suck it up, Miroku?

25
00:03:30,027 --> 00:03:32,560
You know we don't
have time to spare.

26
00:03:32,594 --> 00:03:35,294
-Inuyasha, you really are
a fool, you know that?

27
00:03:35,327 --> 00:03:38,527
He was suggesting we take a rest
for your sake, not his, dummy.

28
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,994
-For my sake?

29
00:03:40,027 --> 00:03:40,894
Why me?

30
00:03:40,927 --> 00:03:42,894
-Because you're ah-- ah choo.

31
00:03:42,927 --> 00:03:45,327
-Oh.

32
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,560
-Smells great.

33
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:50,060
A little village.

34
00:03:50,094 --> 00:03:51,194
The smell.

35
00:03:51,227 --> 00:03:54,827
There's something
soothing about it.

36
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,494
-Soothing?

37
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:56,494
More like sickening.

38
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,260
It's making me
dizzy, it's so sweet.

39
00:03:58,294 --> 00:03:59,360
-Ah choo!

40
00:03:59,394 --> 00:04:00,394
-Wow, Shippo.

41
00:04:00,427 --> 00:04:01,460
Are you OK?

42
00:04:01,494 --> 00:04:02,860
-Can't stop sneezing.

00:04:05,994 --> 00:04:06,927
-Kirara.

45
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,627
You too, huh?

46
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,294
-Hope you don't have far to go.

47
00:04:10,327 --> 00:04:11,427
It'll be dusk soon.

48
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,294
-You're welcome to
stay if you'd like.

49
00:04:13,327 --> 00:04:15,427
We could put you
up for the night.

50
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,327
-We'd love to.

51
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,427
-That's very kind of you.

52
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:17,960
-Choo!

53
00:04:17,994 --> 00:04:18,627
-That's it?

54
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,694
No discussion?

55
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:21,394
Just like that, we're staying?

56
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,260
-Your village is so lovely with
all these flowers everywhere.

57
00:04:24,294 --> 00:04:25,660
-Yes, isn't peaceful?

58
00:04:25,694 --> 00:04:27,227
-I'm exhausted.

59
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,760
-Don't you walk away from me.

60
00:04:29,794 --> 00:04:32,527
MIROKU: Hurry up, Inuyasha.

61
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,627
-This house was built especially
for travelers like you to use.

62
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,294
Please.

63
00:04:36,327 --> 00:04:37,327
Make yourselves at home.

64
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,760
We'll see you in the morning.

65
00:04:38,794 --> 00:04:39,394
-Yes.

66
00:04:39,427 --> 00:04:40,794
Enjoy your stay.

67
00:04:40,827 --> 00:04:42,827
-You're all so careless.

68
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,760
-Look.

69
00:04:43,794 --> 00:04:45,860
You need rest more
than any of us.

70
00:04:45,894 --> 00:04:46,494
-Ha.

71
00:04:46,527 --> 00:04:47,694
What do you know?

72
00:04:47,727 --> 00:04:49,894
Sitting around just
makes it worse.

73
00:04:49,927 --> 00:04:50,694
-Sheesh.

74
00:04:50,727 --> 00:04:52,194
He mever stops complaining.

75
00:04:52,227 --> 00:04:53,727
Kagome, please tell him to sit.

76
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,360
-Hmph.

77
00:04:55,394 --> 00:04:57,027
-What's the point?

78
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,427
He can't help it.

79
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,194
It's obvious
Inuyasha still hasn't

80
00:05:00,227 --> 00:05:01,527
gotten over Kikyo's death.

81
00:05:04,627 --> 00:05:06,260
MAN: Esteemed
Flower Prince, sir.

82
00:05:06,294 --> 00:05:07,627
You'll be pleased
to know that we

83
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,494
have new travelers
staying the night.

84
00:05:09,527 --> 00:05:11,494
-Oh?

85
00:05:11,527 --> 00:05:14,494
You're right, that
does please me.

86
00:05:14,527 --> 00:05:16,894
Ah, the scent of
an injured soul.

87
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,427
This fragrance.

88
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,660
I never tire of it.

89
00:05:23,127 --> 00:05:25,660
[sneezing]

90
00:05:25,694 --> 00:05:28,160
-(VOICEOVER) The scent of those
flowers is getting stronger.

91
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,827
Damn it.

92
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,560
I can't stand this sweet smell.

93
00:05:35,594 --> 00:05:38,827
The stronger it gets,
the more uneasy I feel.

94
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,560
KAGOME: Inuyasha.

95
00:05:39,594 --> 00:05:40,460
-Huh?

96
00:05:40,494 --> 00:05:41,960
-You should try
to get some rest.

97
00:05:41,994 --> 00:05:43,194
I know you're tired.

98
00:05:43,227 --> 00:05:44,760
You haven't been sleeping much.

99
00:05:48,094 --> 00:05:50,994
Not since the day Kikyo died.

100
00:05:51,027 --> 00:05:52,027
-Don't worry about it.

101
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,760
I'll be fine.

102
00:05:53,794 --> 00:05:54,827
-You can't sleep?

103
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,760
-Of course I can.

104
00:05:55,794 --> 00:05:58,327
I just don't want to.

105
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,760
If I fall asleep,
I'll dream about ehr.

106
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:03,527
About Kikyo.

107
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,694
-Ah-- Ah-- Ah choo!

108
00:06:06,727 --> 00:06:07,294
-Shippo.

109
00:06:07,327 --> 00:06:07,994
Poor thing.

110
00:06:08,027 --> 00:06:09,160
You're all stuffed up.

111
00:06:09,194 --> 00:06:10,827
You should probably
blow your nose.

112
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,627
-Sorry if I woke you up.

113
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,327
I wonder what this is.

114
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,994
My eyes are itchy too.

115
00:06:17,027 --> 00:06:19,294
-It's gotta be all
these stupid flowers.

116
00:06:19,327 --> 00:06:20,560
-You mean allergies?

117
00:06:20,594 --> 00:06:21,060
-Aller-what?

118
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,727
-I knew something wasn't
right about this village.

119
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,294
I mean, why would they build
a house just for travelers?

120
00:06:31,327 --> 00:06:32,994
It's not like they're
that well off.

121
00:06:33,027 --> 00:06:33,960
It's weird.

122
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:34,960
-I guess.

123
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:36,294
It's kind of weird.

124
00:06:36,327 --> 00:06:38,027
-Sh.

125
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,060
-Are those the villagers?

126
00:06:39,094 --> 00:06:39,894
-Yeah.

127
00:06:39,927 --> 00:06:40,860
Something's definitely wrong.

128
00:06:40,894 --> 00:06:43,227
-It's so soothing.

129
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,227
-Yes.

130
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,994
The flowers soothe my soul.

131
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,294
-I'm so happy.

132
00:06:52,327 --> 00:06:53,860
-My soul is at peace.

133
00:06:58,194 --> 00:06:59,894
-(VOICEOVER) What's
happening to them?

134
00:06:59,927 --> 00:07:02,894
It looks serious.

135
00:07:02,927 --> 00:07:04,627
-Indeed, we cannot
afford to ignore this.

136
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,294
-What do we do?

137
00:07:19,594 --> 00:07:20,560
-Wake up!

138
00:07:20,594 --> 00:07:21,994
-Are you OK?

139
00:07:22,027 --> 00:07:23,194
-I don't think so.

140
00:07:23,227 --> 00:07:25,560
-They all turned into soil.

141
00:07:25,594 --> 00:07:27,960
-They'll be perfect
for my flowers.

142
00:07:27,994 --> 00:07:29,094
Look around.

143
00:07:29,127 --> 00:07:32,027
Flowers thrive in happy
soil, don't you find?

144
00:07:35,227 --> 00:07:37,194
-Who the hell are you?

145
00:07:37,227 --> 00:07:38,560
-Flower Prince, sir.

146
00:07:38,594 --> 00:07:39,960
-Flower Prince?

147
00:07:39,994 --> 00:07:42,960
-My dear villagers,
you seem upset.

148
00:07:42,994 --> 00:07:45,427
I imagine you must be
quite disappointed.

149
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,894
-Yes, we are, because we
were unable to become soil.

150
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:49,927
-Bastard.

151
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,594
What have you done
to all these people?

152
00:07:51,627 --> 00:07:52,994
-Now, now.

153
00:07:53,027 --> 00:07:55,527
I simply offered the villagers a
chance a peace and tranquility.

154
00:07:58,427 --> 00:07:59,060
-Everyone.

155
00:07:59,094 --> 00:08:01,394
Don't breathe it in.

156
00:08:01,427 --> 00:08:03,127
-I've missed you, sister.

157
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,294
-Kohaku?

158
00:08:05,327 --> 00:08:05,960
-Sango.

159
00:08:05,994 --> 00:08:07,427
-The poor girl.

160
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,994
Worrying about the
fate of her brother

161
00:08:09,027 --> 00:08:11,160
has obviously driven
her to madness.

162
00:08:11,194 --> 00:08:13,394
Perhaps I can ease
her pain, though.

163
00:08:13,427 --> 00:08:15,160
-(VOICEOVER) How does
he know about Kohaku?

164
00:08:21,227 --> 00:08:22,294
-You.

165
00:08:22,327 --> 00:08:24,860
How were you able to
read Sango's mind?

166
00:08:24,894 --> 00:08:27,194
-You are haunted
by injury, a wound

167
00:08:27,227 --> 00:08:29,327
you sustained that
threatens your life.

168
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,560
Not that I blame you.

169
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:31,960
All men fear death.

170
00:08:31,994 --> 00:08:33,827
-(VOICEOVER) He even
knows about my injuries.

171
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,227
How is he doing it?

172
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,227
-You don't have
to worry anymore.

173
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,294
Resign yourselves
to the flowers.

174
00:08:39,327 --> 00:08:41,727
It will bring you the
joy and everlasting piece

175
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,627
that has so long eluded you.

176
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,960
-I've heard enough of this.

177
00:08:45,994 --> 00:08:46,927
Wind Scar!

178
00:08:53,327 --> 00:08:54,260
Huh?

179
00:08:54,294 --> 00:08:55,527
He's gone?

180
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,427
-Is that his blood?

181
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,894
-You must've wounded him.

182
00:08:59,927 --> 00:09:01,394
-I'm gonna follow his trail.

183
00:09:01,427 --> 00:09:02,927
The rest of you, stay here.

184
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,527
-I'm coming with you.

185
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,194
-Thanks anyway, but I can deal
with this freak by myself.

186
00:09:08,227 --> 00:09:09,194
-Be careful.

187
00:09:09,227 --> 00:09:10,827
It might not be as
easy as you think.

188
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,560
-She's right, Inuyasha.

189
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:15,260
The Flower Prince seems to feast
on people's sorrow and pain,

190
00:09:15,294 --> 00:09:16,860
and you've got
both in abundance.

191
00:09:16,894 --> 00:09:18,327
Don't worry about me.

192
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,727
I'm not as delicate as
the rest of you people.

193
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,227
-Wait!

194
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,127
Inuyasha!

195
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,360
-Lady Kagome.

196
00:09:23,394 --> 00:09:25,560
Take these.

197
00:09:25,594 --> 00:09:26,627
Beads of demon repulsion.

198
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,760
-Thanks Miroku.

199
00:09:27,794 --> 00:09:29,627
Stay here and look after
Sango and the villagers.

200
00:09:32,294 --> 00:09:33,060
-Hello?

201
00:09:33,094 --> 00:09:35,694
Where did-- Ah choo!

202
00:09:35,727 --> 00:09:38,360
--everyone go?

203
00:09:38,394 --> 00:09:42,827
-This is rough, huh Kirara?

204
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,194
-(VOICEOVER) I'm glad we're
not just sitting around.

205
00:09:45,227 --> 00:09:46,394
I'd rather be fighting.

206
00:09:46,427 --> 00:09:49,227
At least then I don't have
to think about anything.

207
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,160
Like Kikyo.

208
00:10:03,127 --> 00:10:06,594
-(VOICEOVER) Farewell, Kagura.

209
00:10:06,627 --> 00:10:07,427
-Hello, Kanna.

210
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,960
I bring a message for Naraku.

211
00:10:12,994 --> 00:10:15,460
He wishes for you to lure
Inuyasha and his friends

212
00:10:15,494 --> 00:10:17,360
in and unleash the mirror.

213
00:10:28,338 --> 00:10:29,405
KAGOME: Is that the place?

214
00:10:29,438 --> 00:10:30,238
INUYASHA: Yesh.

215
00:10:30,272 --> 00:10:33,072
There's no mistake.

216
00:10:33,105 --> 00:10:35,372
FLOWER PRINCE: Welcome
to my humble abode.

217
00:10:35,405 --> 00:10:36,005
-Bastard.

218
00:10:36,038 --> 00:10:37,305
-Oh.

219
00:10:37,338 --> 00:10:39,872
If you've come to apologize
for your violent behavior,

220
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:41,305
there's no need.

221
00:10:41,338 --> 00:10:41,872
-Ha.

222
00:10:41,905 --> 00:10:42,772
Not a chance.

223
00:10:42,805 --> 00:10:44,172
It hardly matters.

224
00:10:44,205 --> 00:10:46,605
As you can see, I
wasn't actually injured.

225
00:10:46,638 --> 00:10:48,805
And as for the blood,
well, that was merely

226
00:10:48,838 --> 00:10:51,205
a personal invitation
to my home.

227
00:10:51,238 --> 00:10:52,772
-So, you think you fooled us?

228
00:10:52,805 --> 00:10:55,938
-I have little doubt your
soul will taste exquisite.

229
00:10:55,972 --> 00:10:59,472
I prefer to devour it here
where I can truly savor it.

230
00:10:59,505 --> 00:11:00,838
-What the--

231
00:11:00,872 --> 00:11:03,472
-They're turning red!

232
00:11:03,505 --> 00:11:04,438
-(VOICEOVER) Dammit.

233
00:11:04,472 --> 00:11:05,405
I can't move.

234
00:11:05,438 --> 00:11:07,438
-I've studied tou,
and I can tell

235
00:11:07,472 --> 00:11:09,838
that your soul is in
a very fragile state.

236
00:11:09,872 --> 00:11:14,305
I can feel your pain through
the vines and the pollen.

237
00:11:14,338 --> 00:11:16,405
I see you've suffered
a great loss.

238
00:11:16,438 --> 00:11:20,238
The woman you love most in this
world has died, hasn't she?

239
00:11:20,272 --> 00:11:22,038
You must be sad.

240
00:11:22,072 --> 00:11:25,005
Sad enough to follow her into
death, and beyond, perhaps?

241
00:11:25,038 --> 00:11:26,238
-Shut your mouth!

242
00:11:26,272 --> 00:11:29,005
-Come, and I shall
set your mind at ease.

243
00:11:32,138 --> 00:11:32,605
-Inuyasha!

244
00:11:37,138 --> 00:11:39,038
Inuyasha.

245
00:11:39,072 --> 00:11:40,072
He's gone too.

246
00:11:44,572 --> 00:11:47,405
The beads of demon repulsion.

247
00:11:47,438 --> 00:11:48,538
I see.

248
00:11:48,572 --> 00:11:52,238
They prevent the flowers
from invading my soul.

249
00:11:52,272 --> 00:11:54,205
I guess that's why
I still feel sad.

250
00:12:01,705 --> 00:12:02,572
-Is it you?

251
00:12:05,238 --> 00:12:06,538
-I knew you'd come, Inuyasha.

252
00:12:09,638 --> 00:12:10,072
-Kikyo.

253
00:12:12,472 --> 00:12:13,205
-You're hopeless.

254
00:12:13,238 --> 00:12:15,838
You know that?

255
00:12:15,872 --> 00:12:19,005
-Kikyo-- huh?

256
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:19,505
Kikyo!

257
00:12:23,072 --> 00:12:25,672
-Inuyasha, let's go.

258
00:12:25,705 --> 00:12:26,172
Together.

259
00:12:37,572 --> 00:12:41,238
FLOWER PRINCE: Your face
looks so peaceful now.

260
00:12:41,272 --> 00:12:43,672
I see you've suffered
a great lost.

261
00:12:43,705 --> 00:12:46,805
The woman you love most in this
world has died, hasn't she?

262
00:12:46,838 --> 00:12:48,572
You must be sad.

263
00:12:48,605 --> 00:12:52,272
Sad enough to follow her into
death, and beyond, perhaps.

264
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:54,105
-(VOICEOVER) You can't
want to follow her.

265
00:12:54,138 --> 00:12:54,938
You can't, Inuyasha.

266
00:12:58,705 --> 00:12:59,605
Inuyasha!

267
00:12:59,638 --> 00:13:02,472
Where are you?

268
00:13:02,505 --> 00:13:04,405
Ah!

269
00:13:04,438 --> 00:13:06,738
-There's no sense
in fighting it.

270
00:13:06,772 --> 00:13:09,272
Go ahead and cry if you want.

271
00:13:09,305 --> 00:13:10,705
[gasp]

272
00:13:10,738 --> 00:13:11,605
-Inuyasha!

273
00:13:11,638 --> 00:13:13,005
I know you're in there!

274
00:13:15,538 --> 00:13:17,305
Inuyasha!

275
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,038
-It's too late.

276
00:13:19,072 --> 00:13:21,938
For the heart of this man
is no longer in this world.

277
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:27,605
-(VOICEOVER) Kagome.

278
00:13:32,105 --> 00:13:33,238
-But why?

279
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:35,705
You-- you were finally at peace.

280
00:13:35,738 --> 00:13:38,072
Why would you give that up?

281
00:13:38,105 --> 00:13:40,172
-You talk way too much.

282
00:13:40,205 --> 00:13:42,072
Shut it!

283
00:13:42,105 --> 00:13:44,672
-I merely showed you the
dreams you wished to see.

284
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:02,938
I shall rip your heart
out for defying me!

285
00:14:02,972 --> 00:14:05,038
-(VOICEOVER) I have to
break through this barrier.

286
00:14:05,072 --> 00:14:06,405
Before it's too late!

287
00:14:06,438 --> 00:14:07,938
Please let this work.

288
00:14:15,838 --> 00:14:17,272
-Kagome's arrow?

289
00:14:17,305 --> 00:14:18,738
Kagome, where are you?

290
00:14:21,838 --> 00:14:24,372
Kagome.

291
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,872
Kagome, hang in there.

292
00:14:25,905 --> 00:14:27,172
FLOWER PRINCE: What a surprise.

293
00:14:27,205 --> 00:14:28,472
Huh?

294
00:14:28,505 --> 00:14:29,872
FLOWER PRINCE: The girl's
soul has a delectable taste.

295
00:14:29,905 --> 00:14:31,605
More appealing than yours.

296
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:33,272
-I thought I killed you!

297
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:35,838
FLOWER PRINCE: Indeed, that girl
is hurting more than you are.

298
00:14:35,872 --> 00:14:36,838
-What?

299
00:14:36,872 --> 00:14:38,472
FLOWER PRINCE:
It's plain to see,

300
00:14:38,505 --> 00:14:42,572
the source of this
girl's sorrow is--

301
00:14:42,605 --> 00:14:44,538
-Why so quiet?

302
00:14:44,572 --> 00:14:45,738
I know why.

303
00:14:45,772 --> 00:14:47,772
You just figured out
what was on my mind.

304
00:14:47,805 --> 00:14:50,705
Isn't that right?

305
00:14:50,738 --> 00:14:51,205
-Kagome--

306
00:14:54,738 --> 00:14:57,138
-In that case, you
know what comes next.

307
00:14:57,172 --> 00:14:57,638
Take this!

308
00:15:03,405 --> 00:15:04,538
-Damn you!

309
00:15:04,572 --> 00:15:05,672
-Huh?

310
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:07,405
-Is it amusing for you
to look into the hearts

311
00:15:07,438 --> 00:15:08,338
of other people?

312
00:15:08,372 --> 00:15:10,038
Remind them of their pain?

313
00:15:10,072 --> 00:15:12,805
Well, the pain I feel
isn't for you to consume.

314
00:15:12,838 --> 00:15:14,872
You won't get so
much as a taste.

315
00:15:14,905 --> 00:15:15,872
You hear me?

316
00:15:21,238 --> 00:15:23,705
-You get 'em?

317
00:15:23,738 --> 00:15:24,205
-No.

318
00:15:24,238 --> 00:15:25,205
Not yet.

319
00:15:25,238 --> 00:15:27,172
There are still flowers left.

320
00:15:27,205 --> 00:15:27,972
Go hide.

321
00:15:28,005 --> 00:15:30,038
You're the one he wants now.

322
00:15:30,072 --> 00:15:30,738
Wait.

323
00:15:30,772 --> 00:15:31,438
Don't move, Kagome!

324
00:15:34,005 --> 00:15:35,938
Take that!

325
00:15:35,972 --> 00:15:36,872
[gasp]

326
00:15:45,805 --> 00:15:48,272
[sneeze]

327
00:15:48,305 --> 00:15:49,905
MIROKU: The flowers.

328
00:15:49,938 --> 00:15:53,038
SANGO: They're disappearing.

329
00:15:53,072 --> 00:15:55,805
-Yeah, and my eyes
have stopped itching.

330
00:15:55,838 --> 00:15:58,005
-Kagome, are you OK?

331
00:15:58,038 --> 00:15:58,605
-Fine.

332
00:15:58,638 --> 00:15:59,505
How about you?

333
00:15:59,538 --> 00:16:00,772
-Fine.

334
00:16:00,805 --> 00:16:01,538
Thanks to you.

335
00:16:04,972 --> 00:16:06,872
-(VOICEOVER) He
wept tears of blood.

336
00:16:06,905 --> 00:16:10,905
Whatever happened, it must
have been hard for him.

337
00:16:10,938 --> 00:16:14,238
-Before you came, I had
a dream about Kikyo.

338
00:16:14,272 --> 00:16:15,338
-Oh?

339
00:16:15,372 --> 00:16:17,838
-When I saw her, she
asked me to go with her.

340
00:16:20,872 --> 00:16:22,505
-Did you want to?

341
00:16:22,538 --> 00:16:25,838
-I never answered.
you woke me up.

342
00:16:25,872 --> 00:16:28,138
-(VOICEOVER) That doesn't
answer my question.

343
00:16:28,172 --> 00:16:30,272
-I couldn't save Kikyo's life.

344
00:16:30,305 --> 00:16:33,205
And that caused
me a lot of pain.

345
00:16:33,238 --> 00:16:36,805
For some reason, I
didn't want help.

346
00:16:36,838 --> 00:16:40,072
I thought it was something
I had to go through alone.

347
00:16:40,105 --> 00:16:43,405
I guess I was so focused
on my own suffering,

348
00:16:43,438 --> 00:16:45,138
I couldn't see yours.

349
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:49,272
I never realized that you
were in pain, just like me.

350
00:16:49,305 --> 00:16:51,105
Forgive me, Kagome.

351
00:16:51,138 --> 00:16:52,038
-OK.

352
00:16:52,072 --> 00:16:53,272
I'm just glad you came back.

353
00:16:59,805 --> 00:17:03,105
The thing is, Kikyo's death
was hard for all of us.

354
00:17:03,138 --> 00:17:06,438
But I know that it must have
been especially hard on you.

355
00:17:06,472 --> 00:17:08,272
I understand.

356
00:17:08,305 --> 00:17:10,005
It'll all be OK.

357
00:17:10,038 --> 00:17:12,805
-Kagome-- you-- I don't get it.

358
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:14,005
How are you so strong?

359
00:17:14,038 --> 00:17:16,338
-I am not strong, you idiot!

360
00:17:16,372 --> 00:17:17,672
-Ah!

361
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:20,172
-You should be asking,
are you so kind?

362
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:20,872
I'm kind.

363
00:17:20,905 --> 00:17:21,405
-Right.

364
00:17:21,438 --> 00:17:22,205
You're kind.

365
00:17:22,238 --> 00:17:23,572
Very kind.

366
00:17:23,605 --> 00:17:25,038
-(VOICEOVER) He
might be cluseless,

367
00:17:25,072 --> 00:17:26,738
but I'm still glad he came back.

368
00:17:56,738 --> 00:17:58,105
-It doesn't make sense.

369
00:17:58,138 --> 00:18:00,205
How come only Kirara
and I had to deal

370
00:18:00,238 --> 00:18:02,972
with sneezing and the sniffles?

371
00:18:03,005 --> 00:18:04,172
-Let me see.

372
00:18:04,205 --> 00:18:05,505
Maybe it's because you
don't have a single worry

373
00:18:05,538 --> 00:18:07,138
in the world, just like Kirara.

374
00:18:07,172 --> 00:18:10,072
-Maybe Shippo's just trying
to help us his own way.

375
00:18:10,105 --> 00:18:11,105
-Yeah, that's right.

376
00:18:11,138 --> 00:18:13,205
Since you're always so gloomy.

377
00:18:13,238 --> 00:18:14,672
-Sorry I'm not a
ray of sunshine.

378
00:18:20,072 --> 00:18:22,572
-Naraku, it would apear
that our troublesome friends

379
00:18:22,605 --> 00:18:24,772
are on the move yet again.

380
00:18:24,805 --> 00:18:27,005
[laughter]

381
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:28,572
MIROKU: A strange
light, you say?

382
00:18:28,605 --> 00:18:29,338
-Yes.

383
00:18:29,372 --> 00:18:30,638
We noticed it last night.

384
00:18:30,672 --> 00:18:33,138
-The mountains were lit
up as if it were daylight.

385
00:18:33,172 --> 00:18:34,705
It was very unnatural.

386
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,805
-I wish we could tell
you more, but none of us

387
00:18:36,838 --> 00:18:38,005
dares go near it.

388
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:39,505
-I think I see it.

389
00:18:39,538 --> 00:18:40,705
-Yes.

390
00:18:40,738 --> 00:18:44,738
It looks to be coming from
somewhere near the lake.

391
00:18:44,772 --> 00:18:47,072
-This is kind of
weird, isn't it?

392
00:18:47,105 --> 00:18:48,105
-Why's that?

393
00:18:48,138 --> 00:18:49,272
-Well, as far as I
remember, you never

394
00:18:49,305 --> 00:18:50,505
liked helping out strangers.

395
00:18:50,538 --> 00:18:53,072
But you agreed to help them
without a second though?

396
00:18:53,105 --> 00:18:53,872
-So?

397
00:18:53,905 --> 00:18:55,705
I can't help people out now?

398
00:18:55,738 --> 00:18:57,905
-He gets anxious if he
doesn't do anything.

399
00:18:57,938 --> 00:18:59,605
He needs to do this.

400
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:00,972
-I am not anxious.

401
00:19:01,005 --> 00:19:02,438
I don't get anxious.

402
00:19:02,472 --> 00:19:03,105
-Sure, sure.

403
00:19:03,138 --> 00:19:04,105
Of course you're not.

404
00:19:04,138 --> 00:19:05,472
-(VOICEOVER) Besides.

405
00:19:05,505 --> 00:19:07,505
Even though it's faint, this
is definitely Naraku's scent.

406
00:19:12,905 --> 00:19:14,072
-What happened here?

407
00:19:14,105 --> 00:19:16,605
-The lake water has been
transformed into a mirror.

408
00:19:16,638 --> 00:19:20,805
-Kagome, there's something
in the middle of the lake.

409
00:19:20,838 --> 00:19:21,838
-You're right.

410
00:19:21,872 --> 00:19:23,005
It's Kanna's mirror.

411
00:19:26,405 --> 00:19:27,472
-It's a mirror demon.

412
00:19:30,105 --> 00:19:31,638
-I was waiting for this.

413
00:19:35,605 --> 00:19:36,072
-Kanna.

414
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,572
This must be another
one of Naraku's traps!

415
00:19:50,438 --> 00:19:51,372
-So bright!

416
00:19:54,338 --> 00:19:55,805
-That's pathetic.

417
00:19:55,838 --> 00:19:59,905
Were you hoping
that would blind us?

418
00:19:59,938 --> 00:20:00,905
-What is that?

419
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:08,372
Tetsusaiga?

420
00:20:08,405 --> 00:20:10,438
-(VOICEOVER) Why does that
thing have Tetsusaiga?

421
00:20:10,472 --> 00:20:11,638
In his hand?

422
00:20:11,672 --> 00:20:12,338
-Careful.

423
00:20:12,372 --> 00:20:13,438
That's no reflection.

424
00:20:13,472 --> 00:20:15,372
It seems that Kanna's
mirror has actually

425
00:20:15,405 --> 00:20:16,938
transformed into a demon.

426
00:20:16,972 --> 00:20:19,505
It may have all the
powers of your Tetsusaiga.

427
00:20:19,538 --> 00:20:22,505
-It's just a trick
of the mirror.

428
00:20:22,538 --> 00:20:24,105
A phantom reflection.

429
00:20:24,138 --> 00:20:25,972
Nothing more!

430
00:20:26,005 --> 00:20:27,672
You're not fooling me, Kanna.

431
00:20:27,705 --> 00:20:28,838
Now take this.

432
00:20:28,872 --> 00:20:29,672
Wind Scar!

433
00:20:33,438 --> 00:20:36,605
-His Wind Scar isn't working!

434
00:20:36,638 --> 00:20:38,505
-(VOICEOVER) So it didn't
just copy the shape?

435
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:40,338
It also stole the
demonic energy?

436
00:20:44,605 --> 00:20:45,338
-Your turn.

437
00:20:45,372 --> 00:20:48,372
Wind Scar.

438
00:20:48,405 --> 00:20:49,038
-It's real!

439
00:20:49,072 --> 00:20:51,538
Get out of here.

440
00:20:51,572 --> 00:20:53,038
You're too slow.

441
00:20:53,072 --> 00:20:55,772
Adamant Barrage!

442
00:20:55,805 --> 00:20:57,705
That doesn't work either?

443
00:21:05,572 --> 00:21:06,605
-Inuyasha.

444
00:21:06,638 --> 00:21:08,472
I suggest we pull back now.

445
00:21:08,505 --> 00:21:10,905
-Hurry up, before
the Adamant Barrage!

446
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:13,438
-Adamant Barrage.

447
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:14,905
-Dammit.

448
00:21:14,938 --> 00:21:15,905
-Fox Magic!

449
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:47,205
-A flower.

450
00:21:49,772 --> 00:21:53,772
Flowers wither and
lose their color.

451
00:21:53,805 --> 00:21:59,672
Much as I reflect in vain
time lost to the long rain.

452
00:22:08,629 --> 00:22:11,595
[theme music]

453
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,033
KAGOME: Naraku intends
for Kanna and Inuyasha

454
00:23:47,067 --> 00:23:49,267
to kill each other.

455
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,467
-Don't let up, Kanna.

456
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,933
Continue until there's
nothing left of Tetsusaiga.

457
00:23:53,967 --> 00:23:57,433
Know that this is the very
purpose of your existence.

458
00:23:57,467 --> 00:23:59,900
-There's a light within
the defiled Shikon jewel.

459
00:23:59,933 --> 00:24:02,633
Kanna, are you the one
showing this to me?

460
00:24:02,667 --> 00:24:04,667
INUYASHA: Next time on
"Inuyasha, The Final Act."

461
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,233
Kanna's Gravestone.

462
00:24:06,267 --> 00:24:08,033
-The light.

463
00:24:08,067 --> 00:24:10,200
The light will destroy Naraku.
