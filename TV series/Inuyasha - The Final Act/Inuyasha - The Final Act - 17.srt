[theme music]

3
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:44,925
-Take this!

4
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:53,925
--[chuckling] The
arrow disappeared?

5
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:54,425
Huh?

6
00:02:02,924 --> 00:02:04,491
-You are a true mystery.

7
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:05,458
-Huh?

8
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:07,391
-In the end, you
were able to combine

9
00:02:07,424 --> 00:02:09,958
your own power and the
spiritual power of the bow

10
00:02:09,991 --> 00:02:12,058
to shatter the evil
presence that bound me.

11
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:13,691
You saved me, Kagome.

12
00:02:13,724 --> 00:02:15,524
That much I understand.

13
00:02:15,558 --> 00:02:17,791
However, it was
only in the moment

14
00:02:17,824 --> 00:02:21,358
you released the arrow that
your power became visible.

15
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,624
Something is sealing
your true power.

16
00:02:23,658 --> 00:02:25,691
What it is, I do not know.

17
00:02:25,724 --> 00:02:26,958
-What's the matter, Kagome.

18
00:02:26,991 --> 00:02:28,891
You haven't said a
word since we left.

19
00:02:28,924 --> 00:02:30,124
-It's nothing.

20
00:02:30,158 --> 00:02:32,924
I'm fine.

21
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:35,658
(THINKING) If what Lady
Hitomiko said was true,

22
00:02:35,691 --> 00:02:40,091
my power is being sealed
by something, or someone.

23
00:02:40,124 --> 00:02:41,791
Kikyo, maybe?

24
00:02:41,824 --> 00:02:42,558
Or perhaps--

25
00:02:46,824 --> 00:02:48,758
Magatsuhi's evil will.

26
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:10,158
--[evil chuckle] Word
has spread, Sesshomaru.

27
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:14,491
-Rumor has it you've
lost your weapon.

28
00:03:14,524 --> 00:03:16,358
-Lord Sesshomaru.

29
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:19,991
-Master Jaken, how come everyone
wants to fight Lord Sesshomaru?

30
00:03:20,024 --> 00:03:23,491
-Honestly, these weaklings swarm
to challenge Lord Sesshomaru

31
00:03:23,524 --> 00:03:27,058
in the hopes they can defeat
him now that he is weaponless.

32
00:03:27,091 --> 00:03:28,991
For even that would
earn them prestige.

33
00:03:29,024 --> 00:03:33,091
--[cackle] I've always wanted to
eat the flesh of a dog demon.

34
00:03:33,124 --> 00:03:34,824
It looks like this is my chance.

35
00:03:34,858 --> 00:03:38,758
-And once we defeat you,
the human boy will be ours.

36
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:39,558
-[gasp]

37
00:03:39,591 --> 00:03:40,024
-Silence.

38
00:03:49,124 --> 00:03:50,091
We're leaving.

39
00:03:50,124 --> 00:03:52,424
-[gasp] Yes.

40
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:53,824
Wake up, Kohaku.

41
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,224
-Oh, right.

42
00:03:55,258 --> 00:03:58,358
-I trust you understood, even
Lord Sesshomaru didn't quite

43
00:03:58,391 --> 00:03:59,491
let them finish.

44
00:03:59,524 --> 00:04:00,858
-Yes.

45
00:04:00,891 --> 00:04:03,191
All of these demons have been
after my Shikon Jewel shard.

46
00:04:05,724 --> 00:04:08,524
-Just knowing that, I shrink in
fear every time we're attacked.

47
00:04:08,558 --> 00:04:11,524
-If you shrink anymore, you'll
disappear, Master Jaken.

48
00:04:11,558 --> 00:04:13,524
-Like you're in any
position to talk.

49
00:04:19,324 --> 00:04:22,658
-So Sesshomaru isn't
using his sword anymore.

50
00:04:25,424 --> 00:04:29,191
I heard that InuYasha stole
that nasty Meido Zangetsuha

51
00:04:29,224 --> 00:04:31,658
from him, and now
the sword at his side

52
00:04:31,691 --> 00:04:36,224
is merely a dull piece of
junk that can't cut a thing.

53
00:04:36,258 --> 00:04:37,924
Apparently what I heard is true.

54
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,724
I see.

55
00:04:46,758 --> 00:04:48,791
So she's gone.

56
00:04:48,824 --> 00:04:50,258
-I'm so sorry.

57
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,858
But I couldn't save her.

58
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:56,158
-InuYasha, you, too, have
suffered more than most.

59
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:58,058
-Well it's inevitable.

60
00:04:58,091 --> 00:05:01,124
-Now, after many years of
great agony and suffering,

61
00:05:01,158 --> 00:05:03,691
my sister's finally free.

62
00:05:03,724 --> 00:05:06,724
-Yeah, I guess.

63
00:05:06,758 --> 00:05:09,158
-We need to focus
on the present.

64
00:05:09,191 --> 00:05:12,591
I'm afraid Kagome will have to
take on my sister's role all

65
00:05:12,624 --> 00:05:14,424
by herself.

66
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:15,058
-But she can't.

67
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:26,824
Kagome's spiritual
power has been sealed?

68
00:05:26,858 --> 00:05:29,291
-At least that's what
Hitomiko told her.

69
00:05:29,324 --> 00:05:31,491
-And you believe my
sister's will is somehow

70
00:05:31,524 --> 00:05:33,158
responsible for this?

71
00:05:33,191 --> 00:05:35,724
-Well, that's what
Kagome believes, anyway.

72
00:05:35,758 --> 00:05:36,391
-No.

73
00:05:36,424 --> 00:05:38,158
That isn't possible.

74
00:05:38,191 --> 00:05:41,224
My sister left everything
to Kagome, even her bow.

75
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:42,624
Why would she have
given her that,

76
00:05:42,658 --> 00:05:45,124
if she were planning
to seal her powers?

77
00:05:45,158 --> 00:05:47,158
-But who else could it be?

78
00:05:47,191 --> 00:05:49,824
-I presume the
Shikon Jewel feared

79
00:05:49,858 --> 00:05:52,924
Kagome's spiritual power,
and decided to take action.

80
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:55,491
-The Shikon Jewel?

81
00:05:55,524 --> 00:05:57,558
-As you well know,
the Shikon Jewel

82
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:59,658
contains both a
good spirit we call

83
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:03,491
Naohi, and an evil
spirit, Magatsuhi.

84
00:06:03,524 --> 00:06:06,624
If you are right about
Kagome's innate spiritual power

85
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:12,724
being sealed, there can
be but one explanation.

86
00:06:12,758 --> 00:06:15,791
The evil will of the Jewel
sealed that power out of fear.

87
00:06:21,524 --> 00:06:22,524
-Hmm, what's this?

88
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:34,458
-You must act now.

89
00:06:34,491 --> 00:06:35,458
Mark my words.

90
00:06:35,491 --> 00:06:37,424
If you continue
to stand by idly,

91
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,524
Midoriko will seize control.

92
00:06:39,558 --> 00:06:42,524
And the evil we've put so
much effort into amassing

93
00:06:42,558 --> 00:06:43,224
will be purified.

94
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:49,358
-(THINKING) That's
the Shikon Jewel.

95
00:06:49,391 --> 00:06:50,958
What is Naraku doing?

96
00:06:50,991 --> 00:06:54,124
-If it is flesh you
require, I will gladly

97
00:06:54,158 --> 00:06:56,524
donate my own, manifest.

98
00:06:56,558 --> 00:06:59,224
And then you can finally
eliminate the sacred light.

99
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,258
[grunting]

100
00:07:26,624 --> 00:07:27,791
-That was strange.

101
00:07:27,824 --> 00:07:28,891
What was that?

102
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:36,491
Naraku, was that a new
incarnation, or something?

103
00:07:36,524 --> 00:07:38,991
-No, not quite.

104
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:41,391
It came from inside
the Shikon Jewel.

105
00:07:41,424 --> 00:07:43,224
It is the evil will
of the demons that

106
00:07:43,258 --> 00:07:45,191
have been sealed within
it for many years.

107
00:07:54,024 --> 00:07:54,991
-Huh?

108
00:07:55,024 --> 00:08:00,358
[gasp] What was that?

109
00:08:00,391 --> 00:08:02,658
-Did you feel that
as well, Kagome?

110
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:03,658
-Yes.

111
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,491
I sensed something.

112
00:08:04,524 --> 00:08:06,258
It was pure evil.

113
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,324
(THINKING) And I bet
it's coming to find us.

114
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,058
-Naraku's scent.

115
00:08:14,091 --> 00:08:17,358
-Is something troubling
you, Lord Sesshomaru?

116
00:08:17,391 --> 00:08:18,758
-Stand aside.

117
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:19,258
-Huh?

118
00:08:23,258 --> 00:08:26,191
[screaming] What?

119
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:36,991
-Another incarnation?

120
00:08:37,024 --> 00:08:37,991
Huh?

121
00:08:38,024 --> 00:08:39,924
-[screaming]

122
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,524
-Kohaku, are you OK?

123
00:08:41,558 --> 00:08:42,958
-I'm fine.

124
00:08:42,991 --> 00:08:45,191
-(THINKING) Is this thing after
Kohaku's Jewel shard as well?

125
00:08:52,524 --> 00:08:54,458
-You're weak, demon.

126
00:08:54,491 --> 00:08:56,724
-What did you just say?

127
00:08:56,758 --> 00:08:58,724
-I'll say it one more time.

128
00:08:58,758 --> 00:08:59,724
You are weak.

129
00:09:06,758 --> 00:09:08,224
-You got him, Lord Sesshomaru.

130
00:09:10,924 --> 00:09:12,391
That insolent fool!

131
00:09:12,424 --> 00:09:14,591
You do not call Lord
Sesshomaru weak,

132
00:09:14,624 --> 00:09:16,391
unless you are very
brave, or very stupid.

133
00:09:16,424 --> 00:09:18,724
Your loose tongue has
just condemned you.

134
00:09:21,591 --> 00:09:26,358
-Now then, have you realized
how weak you are yet?

135
00:09:26,391 --> 00:09:27,224
-Something's wrong.

136
00:09:27,258 --> 00:09:28,758
-Why, Kohaku?

137
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,558
-Look at Lord Sesshomaru's arm.

138
00:09:30,591 --> 00:09:33,758
When he attacked, it should
have pierced that thing's body.

139
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:36,758
But it looks like
it's being swallowed.

140
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:37,224
-Huh?

141
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:43,891
-Oh.

142
00:09:43,924 --> 00:09:45,891
-Lord Sesshomaru's arm!

143
00:09:45,924 --> 00:09:46,891
-What's this?

144
00:09:46,924 --> 00:09:49,991
His venom is too
powerful for my Lord!

145
00:09:50,024 --> 00:09:52,958
-[cackling]

146
00:09:52,991 --> 00:09:55,058
-You must escape,
Lord Sesshomaru.

147
00:09:55,091 --> 00:09:56,524
If you were to lose
your right arm,

148
00:09:56,558 --> 00:09:58,491
you would no longer
be able to fight!

149
00:09:58,524 --> 00:10:00,958
-Rinka, down.

150
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:01,858
-Huh?

151
00:10:01,891 --> 00:10:02,558
-(THINKING) Fool.

152
00:10:05,124 --> 00:10:06,824
-He's the Raku's incarnation.

153
00:10:06,858 --> 00:10:09,823
So even if I attack
him, he can't touch me.

154
00:10:09,857 --> 00:10:11,823
Because Lady Kikyo
purified my shard.

155
00:10:15,023 --> 00:10:16,457
Ah!

156
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,390
(THINKING) What?

157
00:10:17,423 --> 00:10:20,357
My shard is being defiled.

158
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:20,890
My shard!

159
00:10:27,357 --> 00:10:30,823
-Lord Sesshomaru!

160
00:10:30,857 --> 00:10:32,323
-That should stop you.

161
00:10:35,357 --> 00:10:35,823
-Bastard!

162
00:10:39,857 --> 00:10:40,823
-Kohaku!

163
00:10:40,857 --> 00:10:42,723
Is he OK?

164
00:10:42,757 --> 00:10:45,890
-Well, you must be
Naraku's latest.

165
00:10:45,923 --> 00:10:47,490
-Naraku?

166
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:49,890
How dare you group me
with that half demon?

167
00:10:49,923 --> 00:10:54,023
-Oh, Lord Sesshomaru,
such a tragedy.

168
00:10:54,057 --> 00:10:56,057
-Sesshomaru doesn't look good.

169
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,257
-Passing Meido Zangetsuha
to InuYasha has cost him.

170
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,890
-Please, just be strong.

171
00:11:00,923 --> 00:11:02,457
The shard's been defiled.

172
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:03,657
I'll purify it.

173
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,557
-(THINKING) Did
that guy defile it?

174
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:10,857
Is he just another one
of Naraku's incarnations?

175
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:14,857
Something feels
different about him.

176
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:17,790
[gasp]

177
00:11:17,823 --> 00:11:18,790
-Kagome!

178
00:11:18,823 --> 00:11:20,290
-What's wrong, Kagome?

179
00:11:20,323 --> 00:11:21,323
-She just fell.

180
00:11:21,357 --> 00:11:22,090
-All right.

181
00:11:22,123 --> 00:11:23,323
What did you do to Kagome?

182
00:11:23,357 --> 00:11:26,023
-[giggling maliciously]

183
00:11:26,057 --> 00:11:27,657
-Take Kohaku and leave.

184
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:28,990
He's in the way.

185
00:11:29,023 --> 00:11:29,490
-Huh?

186
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:30,357
-You too.

187
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:36,723
-Back off.

188
00:11:36,757 --> 00:11:37,890
You're too badly injured.

189
00:11:37,923 --> 00:11:40,023
You don't stand a
chance right now.

190
00:11:40,057 --> 00:11:41,157
-Listen to this.

191
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:43,423
Whose fault do you think
this is the first place?

192
00:11:43,457 --> 00:11:45,623
Since the day Lord
Sesshomaru generously

193
00:11:45,657 --> 00:11:47,890
yielded Meido
Zangetsuha to you--

194
00:11:47,923 --> 00:11:48,923
-Shut up.

195
00:11:48,957 --> 00:11:50,090
-Hmm.

196
00:11:50,123 --> 00:11:52,457
It seems you underestimate me.

197
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:56,490
I have no need for the
protection of a half-demon.

198
00:11:56,523 --> 00:11:56,990
Hmm!

199
00:12:00,423 --> 00:12:01,157
-See that?

200
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,623
The power of sheer will.

201
00:12:02,657 --> 00:12:04,490
-I guess you want some more.

202
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:07,957
Gah!

203
00:12:11,457 --> 00:12:11,923
-Sesshomaru!

204
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,657
-How's that feel?

205
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,657
You will now suffer the
wrath of Lord Sesshomaru,

206
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:19,657
a mighty demon.

207
00:12:24,957 --> 00:12:25,857
Take Kagome.

208
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:29,057
-I've got her.

209
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:29,790
-Oh no!

210
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,523
We forgot Master Jaken!

211
00:12:31,557 --> 00:12:32,123
-Don't worry.

212
00:12:32,157 --> 00:12:34,190
He should be fine.

213
00:12:34,223 --> 00:12:36,623
-Huh?

214
00:12:36,657 --> 00:12:38,057
-He's following us!

215
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,490
-He's after Kohaku's
Jewel shard.

216
00:12:40,523 --> 00:12:42,957
-Yah!

217
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:45,757
-[giggling] Go on.

218
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,090
Tear me to pieces.

219
00:12:47,123 --> 00:12:49,557
I'm just borrowing this body.

220
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,423
-Who are you, anyway?

221
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,123
-Since you ask, I'll tell you.

222
00:12:57,157 --> 00:12:59,557
My name's Magatsuhi.

223
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:00,290
-You're Magatsuhi?

224
00:13:13,076 --> 00:13:14,076
-Magatsuhi?

225
00:13:14,109 --> 00:13:16,442
-The evil will within
the Shikon Jewel.

226
00:13:16,476 --> 00:13:17,576
-Hmm.

227
00:13:17,609 --> 00:13:20,242
It must have found a way
to manifest as a demon.

228
00:13:20,276 --> 00:13:21,176
-Ha.

229
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:22,909
I don't care if
you are Magatsuhi.

230
00:13:22,942 --> 00:13:24,209
I'll still cut you down!

231
00:13:24,242 --> 00:13:25,042
-All right.

232
00:13:25,076 --> 00:13:28,409
But I'll take the dog with me.

233
00:13:28,442 --> 00:13:31,676
-(THINKING) Lord Sesshomaru
can't even break free when

234
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:34,242
he's using his true
power as a dog demon.

235
00:13:37,542 --> 00:13:39,409
Although, while
he's in that form,

236
00:13:39,442 --> 00:13:42,042
he can only rely
on brute strength.

237
00:13:42,076 --> 00:13:43,309
He is a dog, after all.

238
00:13:43,342 --> 00:13:45,942
And from the look of
it, not a bright one.

239
00:13:45,976 --> 00:13:47,576
If he undid the
transformation, he'd

240
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:49,476
shrink, and be
able to slip free.

241
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:51,942
But right now, that
won't occur to him.

242
00:13:54,909 --> 00:13:55,709
Oh Lord Sesshomaru!

243
00:13:58,642 --> 00:14:00,609
That's Lord Sesshomaru for ya.

244
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,109
No, I wasn't thinking anything.

245
00:14:05,142 --> 00:14:06,242
I swear.

246
00:14:06,276 --> 00:14:08,476
-That means Master Jaken
was thinking something.

247
00:14:08,509 --> 00:14:09,609
-Yes.

248
00:14:09,642 --> 00:14:11,709
It seems the two of them
are connected somehow.

249
00:14:11,742 --> 00:14:13,109
-All right, Sesshomaru.

250
00:14:13,142 --> 00:14:13,976
Leave him to me.

251
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:22,109
-Yah!

252
00:14:22,142 --> 00:14:23,376
I know you don't want my help.

253
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:24,742
But I can't let you die.

254
00:14:24,776 --> 00:14:25,676
Now watch out.

255
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:26,942
I'll use Meido Zangetsuha.

256
00:14:29,576 --> 00:14:30,976
-[chuckling]

257
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:32,409
-What?

258
00:14:32,442 --> 00:14:35,709
-By all means, give that
Meido Zangetsuha a whirl.

259
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:37,542
But be careful where you aim.

260
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:41,209
You could just as easily
end up killing your friends.

261
00:14:41,242 --> 00:14:42,376
-Follow me.

262
00:14:42,409 --> 00:14:42,876
-Huh?

263
00:14:48,609 --> 00:14:50,076
-Whatever could he be doing?

264
00:14:50,109 --> 00:14:51,376
-Isn't it obvious?

265
00:14:51,409 --> 00:14:54,209
He's gathering Magatsuhi's
body parts in one place.

266
00:14:58,342 --> 00:14:59,242
-I see.

267
00:14:59,276 --> 00:15:01,142
This way the Meido
won't touch us.

268
00:15:01,176 --> 00:15:02,942
-[giggling] How clever.

269
00:15:02,976 --> 00:15:04,709
Now you won't end up
hurting your friends.

270
00:15:04,742 --> 00:15:08,276
Still, how long do
you think you'll last?

271
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:11,076
-Sesshomaru would actually
risk his life for InuYasha

272
00:15:11,109 --> 00:15:11,976
and the rest of us?

273
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:13,309
-I'm not surprised.

274
00:15:13,342 --> 00:15:16,176
Lord Sesshomaru's a good person
once you get to know him.

275
00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:19,242
-OK, you'll have to
defend yourselves now.

276
00:15:19,276 --> 00:15:21,942
-Huh?

277
00:15:21,976 --> 00:15:23,376
-Sesshomaru!

278
00:15:23,409 --> 00:15:26,542
-Magatsuhi, he must
die by my hand.

279
00:15:26,576 --> 00:15:29,809
My very pride is at stake.

280
00:15:29,842 --> 00:15:35,176
[metal clanging]

281
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:36,342
[metal resonating]

282
00:15:36,376 --> 00:15:37,542
-Huh?

283
00:15:37,576 --> 00:15:42,776
[resonating continues]

284
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:47,842
-Whoa, well that was faster
than I expected, Sesshomaru.

285
00:15:47,876 --> 00:15:50,442
Well, here we go again.

286
00:15:50,476 --> 00:15:50,876
Go!

287
00:15:54,576 --> 00:15:55,876
-[giggling]

288
00:15:55,909 --> 00:15:58,642
-(THINKING) I could smell it,
the true form of Magatsuhi

289
00:15:58,676 --> 00:16:00,842
that's manipulating
these other parts.

290
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:05,042
The scent is slightly different
from Naraku's rotten stench.

291
00:16:05,076 --> 00:16:06,576
-Sesshomaru, you idiot.

292
00:16:06,609 --> 00:16:08,776
Come back!

293
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:10,242
-[gasp]

294
00:16:10,276 --> 00:16:10,942
-Tenseiga?

295
00:16:10,976 --> 00:16:11,976
-Will it work?

296
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:14,009
-Why use Tenseiga,
a sword that heals?

297
00:16:14,042 --> 00:16:16,309
-Yeah, I thought that sword
couldn't cut anything.

298
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:19,242
-Because there is one
thing Tenseiga can cut.

299
00:16:24,409 --> 00:16:25,342
-No!

300
00:16:25,376 --> 00:16:26,742
Damn you!

301
00:16:26,776 --> 00:16:27,776
-What is that?

302
00:16:27,809 --> 00:16:29,676
-Perhaps it's
Magatsuhi's true form.

303
00:16:29,709 --> 00:16:30,642
-I see.

304
00:16:30,676 --> 00:16:32,442
Magatsuhi was formed
from the souls

305
00:16:32,476 --> 00:16:34,809
of demons sealed
within the Jewel.

306
00:16:34,842 --> 00:16:37,509
It seems Tenseiga's blade
is still effective, as long

307
00:16:37,542 --> 00:16:39,876
as what it's cutting
is not of this world.

308
00:16:39,909 --> 00:16:40,809
-You'll pay!

309
00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:46,242
-Ha, how pathetic.

310
00:16:46,276 --> 00:16:48,242
That sword may be able
to cut through souls.

311
00:16:48,276 --> 00:16:52,376
But it will never be able to
cut through Naraku's flesh.

312
00:16:52,409 --> 00:16:53,876
-Ah.

313
00:16:53,909 --> 00:16:54,409
-[gasp]

314
00:16:54,442 --> 00:16:54,891
-Sesshomaru!

315
00:17:00,876 --> 00:17:03,509
-Now I'll say it one last time.

316
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:06,409
You are weak.

317
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,809
-Somebody help him!

318
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:15,542
-Damn it!

319
00:17:18,976 --> 00:17:21,542
Sesshomaru, I don't care
if you don't want my help.

320
00:17:21,576 --> 00:17:23,109
I won't leave you here to die.

321
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,242
-InuYasha.

322
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:25,142
-Oh no.

323
00:17:25,176 --> 00:17:26,042
He's dead!

324
00:17:26,076 --> 00:17:27,342
-Don't cry!

325
00:17:27,376 --> 00:17:30,142
We should be celebrating
Lord Sesshomaru's courage.

326
00:17:30,176 --> 00:17:33,609
He knew he'd lose, but
he chose to fight anyway.

327
00:17:33,642 --> 00:17:34,876
-Master Jaken.

328
00:17:34,909 --> 00:17:37,976
-Our tears would only
dishonor his magnificent end.

329
00:17:38,009 --> 00:17:39,642
[weeping]

330
00:17:39,676 --> 00:17:42,476
-(THINKING) Are you so proud
that you'd rather die than

331
00:17:42,509 --> 00:17:45,342
accept help from the person who
took Meido Zangetsuha from you?

332
00:17:45,376 --> 00:17:46,209
You idiot.

333
00:17:46,242 --> 00:17:47,809
I won't accept that, Sesshomaru.

334
00:17:47,842 --> 00:17:49,776
-[chuckling]

335
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:50,276
-Huh?

336
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:58,209
[grunting]

337
00:17:58,242 --> 00:17:59,442
-What's wrong?

338
00:17:59,476 --> 00:18:01,376
Why not use that
splendid sword of yours

339
00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:03,709
to blow them all to pieces?

340
00:18:03,742 --> 00:18:06,909
Oh, you needn't worry about
what will happen to him.

341
00:18:06,942 --> 00:18:08,809
Even if he shattered
into little pieces,

342
00:18:08,842 --> 00:18:13,076
he'll be restored-- as a part
of Naraku's body, that is.

343
00:18:13,109 --> 00:18:14,576
-I'm going to get you for this!

344
00:18:18,076 --> 00:18:18,542
Huh?

345
00:18:21,576 --> 00:18:22,042
-Whoa!

346
00:18:37,542 --> 00:18:39,509
-Sesshomaru?

347
00:18:39,542 --> 00:18:41,842
-He's still alive?

348
00:18:41,876 --> 00:18:44,809
-This sensation.

349
00:18:44,842 --> 00:18:46,209
-Lord Sesshomaru.

350
00:18:46,242 --> 00:18:49,276
-I'm so glad you're safe.

351
00:18:49,309 --> 00:18:50,542
-Wha--

352
00:18:50,576 --> 00:18:51,209
-Is that?

353
00:18:51,242 --> 00:18:51,876
-Master Totosai.

354
00:18:55,642 --> 00:18:57,076
-(THINKING) Totosai.

355
00:18:57,109 --> 00:18:59,742
In that case, this is it.

356
00:19:07,209 --> 00:19:08,642
-But how?

357
00:19:08,676 --> 00:19:10,142
-Master Jaken, do you see that?

358
00:19:10,176 --> 00:19:10,642
-I do.

359
00:19:16,109 --> 00:19:17,342
-His arm.

360
00:19:17,376 --> 00:19:20,276
-I-i-i-it's the arm
that InuYasha cut off.

361
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:23,576
-So it's finally
appeared, Sesshomaru.

362
00:19:23,609 --> 00:19:26,509
Finally, a weapon that did
not belong to your father.

363
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:29,509
This is your sword, Bakusaiga.

364
00:19:29,542 --> 00:19:31,409
-This is my new sword, is it?

365
00:19:31,442 --> 00:19:31,909
Bakusaiga.

366
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:38,576
-Are they going
to combine again?

367
00:19:38,609 --> 00:19:39,542
-What?

368
00:19:39,576 --> 00:19:41,276
Not only can't I
regenerate, but now

369
00:19:41,309 --> 00:19:44,142
even body parts that were
unscathed are coming apart.

370
00:19:44,176 --> 00:19:46,509
-The effect of his
blade remains even now.

371
00:19:46,542 --> 00:19:49,509
-Not only does it remain,
it continues to spread.

372
00:19:49,542 --> 00:19:52,576
-(THINKING) If Naraku absorbs
any demons touched by that

373
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:55,642
sword, of the damage
will spread to him too.

374
00:19:55,676 --> 00:19:59,709
-I'll admit this diversion has
proven to be very surprising.

375
00:19:59,742 --> 00:20:02,442
However, as I am only
borrowing this body,

376
00:20:02,476 --> 00:20:03,876
you've done me no harm.

377
00:20:06,776 --> 00:20:09,142
Ah!

378
00:20:09,176 --> 00:20:11,409
-Serves you right,
insolent talking head.

379
00:20:11,442 --> 00:20:12,809
That's what you
get for attempting

380
00:20:12,842 --> 00:20:14,642
to belittle Lord Sesshomaru!

381
00:20:14,676 --> 00:20:16,276
-Where's Magatsuhi's true form?

382
00:20:20,542 --> 00:20:21,476
-(THINKING) It escaped.

383
00:20:33,309 --> 00:20:34,109
-How is she?

384
00:20:34,142 --> 00:20:36,176
-She still hasn't woken up.

385
00:20:36,209 --> 00:20:37,409
-Hmm.

386
00:20:37,442 --> 00:20:39,309
-Lord Sesshomaru, I thought
you were going to die.

387
00:20:39,342 --> 00:20:42,276
-I never once stopped
believing in your victory, Lord

388
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:43,609
Sesshomaru.

389
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,409
-(MIMICKING MOCKINGLY) Our
tears would only dishonor his

390
00:20:45,442 --> 00:20:46,342
magnificent end.

391
00:20:46,376 --> 00:20:48,242
-[gasp] Staff of two heads.

392
00:20:48,276 --> 00:20:48,776
-Whoa!

393
00:20:48,809 --> 00:20:49,242
That's hot.

394
00:20:49,276 --> 00:20:50,342
Hot.

395
00:20:50,376 --> 00:20:52,409
-Please show me your
Bakusaiga, Sesshomaru.

396
00:20:55,642 --> 00:20:56,509
Hmm?

397
00:20:56,542 --> 00:20:58,142
Hmm.

398
00:20:58,176 --> 00:21:01,209
This sword has always been
a part of you, Sesshomaru.

399
00:21:01,242 --> 00:21:03,442
It was waiting for you.

400
00:21:03,476 --> 00:21:06,009
But before you
could wield it, you

401
00:21:06,042 --> 00:21:08,909
needed to show you were worthy
of it by standing on your own

402
00:21:08,942 --> 00:21:09,742
as a great demon.

403
00:21:09,776 --> 00:21:10,942
-What's this?

404
00:21:10,976 --> 00:21:13,609
Why, I'll have you know
Lord Sesshomaru has always

405
00:21:13,642 --> 00:21:14,809
stood on his own.

406
00:21:14,842 --> 00:21:16,209
-Will you shut up?

407
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:17,309
-Shutting up, sir.

408
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:19,276
-(THINKING) It
makes perfect sense.

409
00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:21,509
Overcoming his
attachment to Tessaiga,

410
00:21:21,542 --> 00:21:23,509
that was the test
for Sesshomaru.

411
00:21:23,542 --> 00:21:25,209
He had to let go of the past.

412
00:21:28,376 --> 00:21:30,876
TOTOSAI: You once lost
your left arm in an attempt

413
00:21:30,909 --> 00:21:32,242
to take Tessaiga.

414
00:21:32,276 --> 00:21:35,376
It was a most unfortunate event.

415
00:21:35,409 --> 00:21:39,376
But now you have gained a new
arm, along with Bakusaiga,

416
00:21:39,409 --> 00:21:42,476
a sword that is truly
yours, and yours alone,

417
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,876
proving that you have finally
surpassed your father,

418
00:21:44,909 --> 00:21:47,776
and that you would have been
released from your obsession

419
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:48,376
with Tessaiga.

420
00:21:53,476 --> 00:21:54,442
-[whimpering]

421
00:21:54,476 --> 00:21:57,576
-Kagome, are you OK, Kagome?

422
00:21:57,609 --> 00:21:58,076
-Yeah.

423
00:22:08,695 --> 00:22:13,628
[music playing]

424
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,027
KAGOME: It's finally here,
entrance exams for high school.

425
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,760
I've been studying
for the past 10 days,

426
00:23:49,794 --> 00:23:51,127
so I'm sure it will be fine.

427
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,494
I can definitely pass.

428
00:23:52,527 --> 00:23:53,994
-We're going back, Kagome.

429
00:23:54,027 --> 00:23:54,694
-Uh, uh!

430
00:23:54,727 --> 00:23:55,527
Sit, boy!

431
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,960
What a nightmare.

432
00:23:56,994 --> 00:23:59,727
I mean, why would you come
for me today of all days?

433
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,660
Next time on InuYasha the
Final Act, the day of days.

434
00:24:03,694 --> 00:24:05,294
KAGOME: At this
point, I still didn't

435
00:24:05,327 --> 00:24:06,627
realize that I
would one day have

436
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:10,927
to choose between two
worlds-- this one or his.
