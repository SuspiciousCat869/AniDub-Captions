00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,737
NARAKU: It all began long
ago, with the simple dream

4
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,670
of a villain who was
clinging to life--

5
00:01:48,703 --> 00:01:51,470
a prisoner in his own body.

6
00:01:51,503 --> 00:01:55,170
Kikyo, to claim this beautiful
priestess as his own,

7
00:01:55,203 --> 00:02:02,503
and escape this dark cave-- that
was the villain's only desire.

8
00:02:02,537 --> 00:02:06,403
He fed his body to demons
to fulfill that wish.

9
00:02:06,437 --> 00:02:09,403
Many demons were drawn
to the villain's body.

10
00:02:09,437 --> 00:02:12,537
There they were united as one.

11
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,970
Thus Naraku was born.

12
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,170
-[grunt] Huh?

13
00:02:26,203 --> 00:02:27,270
-Fool.

14
00:02:27,303 --> 00:02:33,303
I have no desire
whatsoever to become human.

15
00:02:33,337 --> 00:02:36,237
But I shall take the
Shikon Jewel nonetheless.

16
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,470
Thanks.

17
00:02:37,503 --> 00:02:39,903
This jewel is about to
absorb a great deal of pain

18
00:02:39,937 --> 00:02:42,603
and suffering when I use it
to slaughter the villagers.

19
00:02:45,637 --> 00:02:46,570
-It's InuYasha!

20
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,537
-So there.

21
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:55,670
Finally, a way for me to
become all demon at last.

22
00:02:55,703 --> 00:02:57,270
Ha!

23
00:02:57,303 --> 00:02:57,770
-InuYasha!

24
00:03:01,703 --> 00:03:02,670
-Oh!

25
00:03:02,703 --> 00:03:04,437
[gasp]

26
00:03:09,003 --> 00:03:11,737
-Kikyo?

27
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,370
How could-- I thought--

28
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:24,503
-And so I give this to
you, the Shikon Jewel,

29
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:27,670
which you must bun with my body.

30
00:03:27,703 --> 00:03:34,103
It must not fall into the hands
of those who would abuse it.

31
00:03:34,137 --> 00:03:36,037
[whimpering] Oh.

32
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,970
-Sister Kikyo!

33
00:03:38,003 --> 00:03:38,937
Sister Kikyo!

34
00:03:41,837 --> 00:03:44,903
-I shall take it with
me to the other world.

35
00:03:51,137 --> 00:03:54,903
NARAKU: 50 years have
passed since then.

36
00:03:54,937 --> 00:03:56,803
It's been a long time, Kikyo.

37
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:59,137
The Shikon Jewel
was supposed to have

38
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,737
been lost to the flames
that consumed your remains.

39
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:05,470
And yet it now rests
in the palm of my hand.

40
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,670
-(THINKING) The Shikon Jewel
has been fully defiled by Naraku

41
00:04:11,703 --> 00:04:15,937
now, so much so that Magatsuhi
himself will no longer be able

42
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,270
to go back inside of it.

43
00:04:20,103 --> 00:04:22,470
-Our fates are tied, InuYasha.

44
00:04:22,503 --> 00:04:25,337
For as you and your group's
hatred towards me grew,

45
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,303
I consumed and
transformed your rage,

46
00:04:27,337 --> 00:04:29,903
and channeled it into
the Shikon Jewel.

47
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:33,570
Now at last the defiled
Shikon Jewel is complete.

48
00:04:33,603 --> 00:04:36,570
By the end of this battle,
you and your friends

49
00:04:36,603 --> 00:04:40,470
will be consumed by the very
darkness you helped to create.

50
00:04:40,503 --> 00:04:43,570
Kikyo's light has died.

51
00:04:43,603 --> 00:04:44,570
INUYASHA: Inside Naraku.

52
00:04:50,603 --> 00:04:52,003
KAGOME: Huh?

53
00:04:52,037 --> 00:04:53,437
Really?

54
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,370
I got in?

55
00:04:54,403 --> 00:04:55,837
No way!

56
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,903
-They wait-listed you.

57
00:04:56,937 --> 00:04:58,070
But you make it.

58
00:04:58,103 --> 00:05:00,403
You'll be a high school
student in the spring.

59
00:05:00,437 --> 00:05:01,703
Isn't it just wonderful?

60
00:05:01,737 --> 00:05:02,737
-Oh, mom.

61
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,537
-You should be proud, Kagome.

62
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,270
Wait-listed or not, you got in.

63
00:05:07,303 --> 00:05:10,003
-And that's after missing
all those classes, too.

64
00:05:10,037 --> 00:05:11,337
-I must be a genius.

65
00:05:19,137 --> 00:05:20,070
Good morning.

66
00:05:20,103 --> 00:05:21,270
-Kagome!

67
00:05:21,303 --> 00:05:22,437
You made it.

68
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,003
-Like I'd miss your graduation.

69
00:05:24,037 --> 00:05:26,003
-I guess that life
threatening illness

70
00:05:26,037 --> 00:05:27,270
gave you a break for the day.

71
00:05:27,303 --> 00:05:28,303
-Yeah, Kagome.

72
00:05:28,337 --> 00:05:29,703
We got worried when
you didn't show up

73
00:05:29,737 --> 00:05:31,403
to check you exam results.

74
00:05:31,437 --> 00:05:32,770
-Tell me about it.

75
00:05:32,803 --> 00:05:35,170
I totally almost cried when I
saw all or numbers up there.

76
00:05:35,203 --> 00:05:37,003
-That was pretty
emotional, wasn't it?

77
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:38,137
-Yeah.

78
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:38,970
-That's great.

79
00:05:39,003 --> 00:05:40,070
I'm glad to hear you made it.

80
00:05:40,103 --> 00:05:41,403
-What are you talking about?

81
00:05:41,437 --> 00:05:42,503
I knew we'd pass.

82
00:05:42,537 --> 00:05:44,837
You were the one we
were worried about.

83
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,503
-I need everyone to line up.

84
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,937
-Oh no.

85
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,803
I'm too nervous to go up there.

86
00:05:52,837 --> 00:05:54,537
-They say write
person on your palm

87
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,603
and swallow it to fight nerves.

88
00:05:56,637 --> 00:05:57,737
Just do it.

89
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,437
It'll work.

90
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:59,103
-There.

91
00:05:59,137 --> 00:05:59,970
Swallow it.

92
00:06:00,003 --> 00:06:02,170
-Uh, OK.

93
00:06:02,203 --> 00:06:03,437
-Let's go.

94
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,003
ANNOUNCER: Congratulations.

95
00:06:05,037 --> 00:06:12,437
[applause]

96
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,437
-(THINKING) I can't believe it.

97
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,237
I'm graduating
from middle school.

98
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:22,470
Mom, grandpa, I have to
admit, I didn't participate

99
00:06:22,503 --> 00:06:24,870
in many, well, any clubs.

100
00:06:24,903 --> 00:06:28,270
But I did have a lot of fun
at the cultural festivals.

101
00:06:28,303 --> 00:06:31,803
And even though only made
it to gym class a few times,

102
00:06:31,837 --> 00:06:34,437
I was able to build up a
lot of stamina fighting

103
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,370
for my life in the feudal era.

104
00:06:36,403 --> 00:06:39,503
It was painful trying to
make up for all the classes I

105
00:06:39,537 --> 00:06:42,603
missed to prepare for exams.

106
00:06:42,637 --> 00:06:45,903
But I managed to graduate.

107
00:06:45,937 --> 00:06:47,070
-Picture time.

108
00:06:47,103 --> 00:06:47,870
-Huh?

109
00:06:47,903 --> 00:06:51,070
-OK, say cheese.

110
00:06:51,103 --> 00:06:53,637
-Hey, Eri, let me
take the next one.

111
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:54,470
-Higurashi.

112
00:06:54,503 --> 00:06:55,737
-Huh?

113
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,303
-It's Hojo.

114
00:06:57,337 --> 00:06:59,537
-So, looks like we're going
to different high schools.

115
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:00,637
-Oh, that's too bad.

116
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,203
-I heard he's going to
an all boys' school.

117
00:07:03,237 --> 00:07:04,337
-Oh my gosh.

118
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,003
I wonder if Hojo still
has a crush on Kagome.

119
00:07:06,037 --> 00:07:07,237
-Probably.

120
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,537
-I guess no on told him
about Kagome's crazy hoodlum

121
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,470
boyfriend.

122
00:07:10,503 --> 00:07:11,503
-Higurashi?

123
00:07:11,537 --> 00:07:12,737
-Hmm?

124
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,603
-I'd like if we could still
stay friends, you know?

125
00:07:14,637 --> 00:07:15,603
-Of course.

126
00:07:15,637 --> 00:07:17,870
Let's stay friends
forever, Hojo.

127
00:07:17,903 --> 00:07:19,237
-Poor guy.

128
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:22,003
-As something to remember me
by, I want you to have-- huh?

129
00:07:22,037 --> 00:07:24,337
-Wow, is that really the time?

130
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,337
-Ah, got it.

131
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:32,103
I wanted you to have my second
button as a way to say-- huh?

132
00:07:32,137 --> 00:07:32,937
Higurashi?

133
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:33,637
-I'm sorry.

134
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,070
But Kagome left already.

135
00:07:35,103 --> 00:07:37,070
-What?

136
00:07:37,103 --> 00:07:37,703
-Poor guy.

137
00:07:40,637 --> 00:07:42,437
MAMA HIGURASHI: leaving
already, Kagome?

138
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,670
-Yeah.

139
00:07:43,703 --> 00:07:45,970
-Oh, at least stay for
dinner, so we can celebrate.

140
00:07:46,003 --> 00:07:47,103
-I'm sorry.

141
00:07:47,137 --> 00:07:49,637
I had to beg them to let
me come in first place.

142
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,737
-But mom said she's making
all your favorite foods,

143
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:52,970
and everything.

144
00:07:53,003 --> 00:07:55,003
-When I get back, you'll
have that graduation present

145
00:07:55,037 --> 00:07:55,937
for me, right grandpa?

146
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,803
-I have it now.

147
00:07:57,837 --> 00:07:58,470
-Really?

148
00:07:58,503 --> 00:07:59,803
-Here you go, dear.

149
00:07:59,837 --> 00:08:03,203
A dried dragon's tail and
tengu whiskers for good luck.

150
00:08:03,237 --> 00:08:07,070
This is for graduating, and this
one here is for high school.

151
00:08:07,103 --> 00:08:08,170
-Oh.

152
00:08:08,203 --> 00:08:10,537
I'll just assume this
isn't my real present.

153
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:15,770
-Kagome, you worked really hard.

154
00:08:15,803 --> 00:08:17,803
We're all so proud of you.

155
00:08:17,837 --> 00:08:21,637
-Mom, um, thank you.

156
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,437
See you, grandpa, Sota.

157
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,703
-Please be careful.

158
00:08:25,737 --> 00:08:27,437
-I will.

159
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,903
GRANDPA HIGURASHI: Go get 'em.

160
00:08:28,937 --> 00:08:31,370
SOTA: Say hi to
the big dog for me.

161
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:40,337
-Hmm.

162
00:08:47,303 --> 00:08:50,770
[dramatic music]

163
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,970
-The demons are on the move.

164
00:09:32,003 --> 00:09:32,503
-Hmm.

165
00:09:32,537 --> 00:09:33,803
It's strange.

It's almost as if they're
being drawn to something.

167
00:09:37,037 --> 00:09:39,237
-Look, a demonic presence.

168
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:42,870
-Yes, it's a mass
of demonic energy.

169
00:09:42,903 --> 00:09:45,670
-Hey, InuYasha, did
Naraku use the Jewel?

170
00:09:45,703 --> 00:09:48,070
-Yeah, he must've.

171
00:09:48,103 --> 00:09:51,003
Naraku, the light from
Kikyo that you feared

172
00:09:51,037 --> 00:09:53,337
has become Kohaku's life now.

173
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:56,137
Kikyo will no longer be
able to fight against you.

174
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,570
And that's why
I-- no, that's why

175
00:09:58,603 --> 00:10:00,737
we must defeat you ourselves.

176
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:03,670
Time to finish this,
once and for all, Naraku.

177
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:06,037
-InuYasha, thanks for waiting.

178
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,170
I'm all finished.

179
00:10:07,203 --> 00:10:08,003
-Good.

180
00:10:08,037 --> 00:10:09,137
Hope you're ready to get going.

181
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,937
-Welcome back, Kagome.

182
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,137
-That didn't take long.

183
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,003
-All right, InuYasha.

184
00:10:14,037 --> 00:10:14,603
Let's go.

185
00:10:23,307 --> 00:10:24,507
-Huh?

186
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,388
What happened to me?

187
00:10:26,422 --> 00:10:28,222
-Awake at last.

188
00:10:28,255 --> 00:10:30,955
-It's coming back to me.

189
00:10:30,988 --> 00:10:33,088
We were about to leave.

190
00:10:33,122 --> 00:10:34,322
Why InuYasha?

191
00:10:34,355 --> 00:10:35,988
Why are you leaving me behind?

192
00:10:36,022 --> 00:10:38,855
-This battle's no place
for a kid, all right?

193
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,888
-This isn't going to be anything
like the other battles, Shippo.

194
00:10:41,922 --> 00:10:43,888
-This time, Naraku has
used the Shikon Jewel

195
00:10:43,922 --> 00:10:45,955
to transform himself completely.

196
00:10:45,988 --> 00:10:47,055
-That's right.

197
00:10:47,088 --> 00:10:48,955
And I'm going to be
busy protecting Kagome

198
00:10:48,988 --> 00:10:51,055
until her spiritual
power returns.

199
00:10:51,088 --> 00:10:53,522
I won't be able to
look after you, too.

200
00:10:53,555 --> 00:10:55,288
-I'm sorry, Shippo.

201
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:59,488
-Kohaku, I want you to stay here
with Lady Kaede as well, OK?

202
00:10:59,522 --> 00:11:00,422
-Sister.

203
00:11:00,455 --> 00:11:03,188
-Your life's a gift from Kikyo.

204
00:11:03,222 --> 00:11:04,722
You mustn't waste it.

205
00:11:04,755 --> 00:11:05,888
-Right.

206
00:11:05,922 --> 00:11:07,222
-But why?

207
00:11:07,255 --> 00:11:09,655
After being together
all this time,

208
00:11:09,688 --> 00:11:12,822
aren't, aren't I a
member of this group.

209
00:11:12,855 --> 00:11:14,388
INUYASHA: Of course you are.

210
00:11:14,422 --> 00:11:15,655
-Am I really?

211
00:11:15,688 --> 00:11:19,522
-You'll always be one
of us, Shippo, always.

212
00:11:19,555 --> 00:11:21,355
Look, if we don't
come back, you'll

213
00:11:21,388 --> 00:11:22,688
have to take over for us.

214
00:11:22,722 --> 00:11:23,955
You understand, Shippo?

215
00:11:23,988 --> 00:11:25,988
-InuYasha?

216
00:11:26,022 --> 00:11:28,822
-Huh, me, by my myself?

217
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,922
-Of course, it can always
wait until you grow up,

218
00:11:30,955 --> 00:11:32,422
and become a great demon.

219
00:11:32,455 --> 00:11:34,722
You understand, Shippo?

220
00:11:34,755 --> 00:11:35,522
-But still--

221
00:11:35,555 --> 00:11:36,188
-You understand?

222
00:11:39,655 --> 00:11:42,755
-I'll get him for this,
sucker punching me like that.

223
00:11:42,788 --> 00:11:44,222
I will hunt you down!

224
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,988
-It's too late to
go after them now.

225
00:11:46,022 --> 00:11:46,488
-Huh?

226
00:11:50,788 --> 00:11:54,055
-Lady Kaede, it's growing.

227
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:54,555
-InuYasha.

228
00:11:59,188 --> 00:12:00,255
-Poor Shippo.

229
00:12:00,288 --> 00:12:02,022
It must be hard to
have been left behind.

230
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,222
-Hah.

231
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:05,022
That was quite
unexpected, hearing

232
00:12:05,055 --> 00:12:07,222
InuYasha sound so sensitive.

233
00:12:07,255 --> 00:12:08,455
-What?

234
00:12:08,488 --> 00:12:10,622
-Indeed, all that stuff
about if we don't come back?

235
00:12:10,655 --> 00:12:13,122
-Heh, I had to say
that, or Shippo never

236
00:12:13,155 --> 00:12:14,255
would have agreed to it.

237
00:12:14,288 --> 00:12:16,488
-Why bother if you were
just going to punch him?

238
00:12:16,522 --> 00:12:17,822
-You're right.

239
00:12:17,855 --> 00:12:19,688
I should have just knocked
him unconscious to begin with.

240
00:12:19,722 --> 00:12:21,922
-That wasn't my point.

241
00:12:21,955 --> 00:12:24,655
But this is going
to be dangerous.

242
00:12:24,688 --> 00:12:27,555
My spiritual power is
still sealed by Magatsuhi.

243
00:12:27,588 --> 00:12:29,822
And who knows when
it will come back.

244
00:12:29,855 --> 00:12:32,222
-Well, it won't happen
until Sesshomaru

245
00:12:32,255 --> 00:12:33,888
uses Tenseiga to
finish off Magatsuhi.

246
00:12:49,222 --> 00:12:51,755
-You've transform, Naraku.

247
00:12:51,788 --> 00:12:56,588
But you're still just a
spider to be stepped on.

248
00:12:56,622 --> 00:12:57,088
Bakusaiga!

249
00:13:00,388 --> 00:13:02,288
BYAKUYA: I must admit,
that new sword of yours

250
00:13:02,322 --> 00:13:03,888
is really something.

251
00:13:03,922 --> 00:13:05,988
-Byakuya of the Dreams.

252
00:13:06,022 --> 00:13:07,588
-One swing in the
demon's direction

253
00:13:07,622 --> 00:13:09,055
leaves a crumbling corpse.

254
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:11,722
And if that corpse is
reabsorbed by the main body,

255
00:13:11,755 --> 00:13:13,122
it, too will crumble.

256
00:13:13,155 --> 00:13:16,722
Naraku won't have a
chance, even his new form.

257
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:19,055
So by all means, sing away.

258
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:29,288
Or are you worried about
your little companion?

259
00:13:29,322 --> 00:13:32,122
As you may have guessed,
she's there, inside Naraku.

260
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:43,555
-Hmm?

261
00:13:43,588 --> 00:13:44,555
-Look who's here.

262
00:13:49,022 --> 00:13:50,522
-That spider.

263
00:13:50,555 --> 00:13:52,822
-It's Naraku.

264
00:13:52,855 --> 00:13:53,488
Hold on, Kagome.

265
00:14:02,322 --> 00:14:04,722
What?

266
00:14:04,755 --> 00:14:06,688
-Its body is opening up?

267
00:14:11,622 --> 00:14:13,722
-Huh?

268
00:14:13,755 --> 00:14:14,222
Sesshomaru!

269
00:14:18,755 --> 00:14:20,455
BYAKUYA: My, he
didn't even hesitate

270
00:14:20,488 --> 00:14:22,188
to go in after the little girl.

271
00:14:22,222 --> 00:14:24,022
Brings tears to my eyes.

272
00:14:24,055 --> 00:14:24,922
-Rin's inside there?

273
00:14:24,955 --> 00:14:26,655
Come on, InuYasha.

274
00:14:26,688 --> 00:14:28,455
-All right.

275
00:14:28,488 --> 00:14:29,255
-Sango?

276
00:14:29,288 --> 00:14:30,788
-Yes, we're right behind them.

277
00:14:33,822 --> 00:14:35,388
-You two are going as well?

278
00:14:35,422 --> 00:14:38,388
You realize you might end
up getting eaten if you do.

279
00:14:38,422 --> 00:14:39,222
-Hmm.

280
00:14:39,255 --> 00:14:40,222
-Uh oh.

281
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:42,088
Going to use your
wind tunnel on me.

282
00:14:42,122 --> 00:14:42,922
No.

283
00:14:42,955 --> 00:14:45,222
That would accomplish nothing.

284
00:14:45,255 --> 00:14:47,355
(THINKING) Though I
gladly would if my wind

285
00:14:47,388 --> 00:14:49,122
tunnel weren't at its limit.

286
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,388
It may hold for one
or two more uses.

287
00:14:51,422 --> 00:14:54,288
But after that, it will
certainly tear open.

288
00:14:54,322 --> 00:14:56,655
And I will be sucked
in and destroyed.

289
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:59,188
In order to survive,
I must kill Naraku,

290
00:14:59,222 --> 00:15:01,888
and break the curse of
the wind tunnel forever.

291
00:15:01,922 --> 00:15:07,588
-Miroku, let's defeat Naraku.

292
00:15:07,622 --> 00:15:08,822
-Yes.

293
00:15:08,855 --> 00:15:13,155
And Sango, once this is all
over, let's get married.

294
00:15:13,188 --> 00:15:16,055
-Huh?

295
00:15:16,088 --> 00:15:18,322
Yes.

296
00:15:18,355 --> 00:15:19,655
-Those fools.

297
00:15:19,688 --> 00:15:22,722
If it were me, I'd much rather
sacrifice the human girl,

298
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,588
and destroy Naraku
from out here.

299
00:15:28,555 --> 00:15:30,288
-Naraku's body is a
lot bigger than it

300
00:15:30,322 --> 00:15:31,688
looks from the outside, huh?

301
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:32,188
-Yeah.

302
00:15:37,455 --> 00:15:38,422
KAGOME: It's him.

303
00:15:38,455 --> 00:15:41,422
-Naraku!

304
00:15:41,455 --> 00:15:43,388
Yah!

305
00:15:43,422 --> 00:15:45,888
-You finally made it inside.

306
00:15:45,922 --> 00:15:47,788
I've been waiting for you.

307
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:49,288
[cackling]

308
00:15:49,322 --> 00:15:50,755
-InuYasha!

309
00:15:50,788 --> 00:15:51,255
-Huh?

310
00:15:54,255 --> 00:15:56,855
INUYASHA: Will you destroy
me from the inside?

311
00:15:56,888 --> 00:15:58,755
Start where you like.

312
00:15:58,788 --> 00:16:01,122
Everything around you is me.

313
00:16:01,155 --> 00:16:03,888
-Hiraikotsu.

314
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:06,322
-It's miasma!

315
00:16:06,355 --> 00:16:09,255
-Don't tell me
you didn't notice.

316
00:16:09,288 --> 00:16:10,955
The fact is, you
and your companions

317
00:16:10,988 --> 00:16:15,022
have been exposed to my miasma
ever since you entered my body.

318
00:16:15,055 --> 00:16:17,955
Yet curiously, none
of you have died.

319
00:16:17,988 --> 00:16:19,422
Do you know why?

320
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:23,155
It is because the Shikon
Jewel desires you souls.

321
00:16:23,188 --> 00:16:24,888
-Our souls?

322
00:16:24,922 --> 00:16:25,988
-That's right.

323
00:16:26,022 --> 00:16:28,355
It's because of your
hatred towards me,

324
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:30,722
all the rage and
despair you feel.

325
00:16:30,755 --> 00:16:32,155
-That what you think?

326
00:16:32,188 --> 00:16:33,088
Shut up.

327
00:16:33,122 --> 00:16:34,288
I'm done talking.

328
00:16:34,322 --> 00:16:37,355
It's time to settle this
once and for all, Naraku.

329
00:16:37,388 --> 00:16:39,655
-It matters not what you do.

330
00:16:39,688 --> 00:16:42,422
You can not change the fate
of the Shikon Jewel, which

331
00:16:42,455 --> 00:16:43,822
has endured for
hundreds of years.

332
00:16:50,188 --> 00:16:52,055
-Is that him, too?

333
00:16:52,088 --> 00:16:54,188
-His entire body is
covered in armor.

334
00:17:07,188 --> 00:17:12,688
-Well, it looks just
like the Shikon Jewel.

335
00:17:12,722 --> 00:17:15,022
-Yah!

336
00:17:15,055 --> 00:17:16,422
Damn.

337
00:17:16,455 --> 00:17:18,788
-Now fight me, InuYasha.

338
00:17:18,822 --> 00:17:20,555
We have nothing but time.

339
00:17:20,588 --> 00:17:23,688
You have an eternity and
more to fight me in here.

340
00:17:27,155 --> 00:17:30,055
-Tessaiga.

341
00:17:30,088 --> 00:17:31,022
Huh?

342
00:17:31,055 --> 00:17:32,488
Ah.

343
00:17:32,522 --> 00:17:33,488
-InuYasha!

344
00:17:33,522 --> 00:17:35,922
-Hiraikotsu.

345
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:38,855
-Got him.

346
00:17:38,888 --> 00:17:40,988
-Hiraikotsu seems to
have worked against him.

347
00:17:41,022 --> 00:17:41,822
Wait, what?

348
00:17:41,855 --> 00:17:46,222
-[gasp]

349
00:17:46,255 --> 00:17:46,722
Two?

350
00:17:59,055 --> 00:17:59,988
-Adamant Barrage.

351
00:18:04,455 --> 00:18:04,988
Damn.

352
00:18:05,022 --> 00:18:06,388
It's endless.

353
00:18:06,422 --> 00:18:10,388
In that case, Meido Zanhetsuha.

354
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,488
-A sword which sends its foes
to the depths of the underworld.

355
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:18,355
-Miroku, look.

356
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,622
I can see something over there.

357
00:18:20,655 --> 00:18:21,322
MIROKU: The girl.

358
00:18:24,522 --> 00:18:26,922
-It's Rin!

359
00:18:26,955 --> 00:18:28,922
NARAKU: [menacing laugh]
It appears

360
00:18:28,955 --> 00:18:30,688
the little girl is awake.

361
00:18:30,722 --> 00:18:31,388
-Ha.

362
00:18:31,422 --> 00:18:32,888
That's just an illusion.

363
00:18:32,922 --> 00:18:35,588
NARAKU: Then by all
means, swing away.

364
00:18:35,622 --> 00:18:38,422
No harm in sending this
illusion of the little girl

365
00:18:38,455 --> 00:18:40,122
to the underworld.

366
00:18:40,155 --> 00:18:42,355
-Rin.

367
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:43,688
-[gasp]

368
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:45,055
-Look out.

369
00:18:45,088 --> 00:18:47,122
NARAKU: What are
you waiting for?

370
00:18:47,155 --> 00:18:49,855
The little girl this is
Sesshomaru's companion,

371
00:18:49,888 --> 00:18:51,155
not yours.

372
00:18:51,188 --> 00:18:54,488
In fact, you have no
connection to her whatsoever.

373
00:18:54,522 --> 00:18:56,822
And yet you're unwilling
to sacrifice her.

374
00:18:56,855 --> 00:18:59,322
Well, I suspect you will
soon change your mind.

375
00:18:59,355 --> 00:19:02,088
Either that, or all
of you will die.

376
00:19:02,122 --> 00:19:05,322
-The Shikone Jewel, we have
to find and destroy it.

377
00:19:05,355 --> 00:19:07,622
Then Naraku will die.

378
00:19:07,655 --> 00:19:08,488
-The Jewel?

379
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:11,288
-What do you mean, Kagome?

380
00:19:11,322 --> 00:19:12,322
-Hold on.

381
00:19:12,355 --> 00:19:13,822
Didn't Naraku absorb
the Jewel already?

382
00:19:13,855 --> 00:19:15,155
-Maybe not.

383
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:17,422
I sense a strong presence
from deep within Narku's body.

384
00:19:17,455 --> 00:19:20,322
Which means the Jewel is
probably still in its original

385
00:19:20,355 --> 00:19:21,322
for.

386
00:19:21,355 --> 00:19:23,988
-Naraku hasn't
absorbed it after all.

387
00:19:24,022 --> 00:19:25,722
-Ah!

388
00:19:25,755 --> 00:19:27,055
-Whoa!

389
00:19:27,088 --> 00:19:27,555
-InuYasha!

390
00:19:27,588 --> 00:19:30,488
-Kagome!

391
00:19:30,522 --> 00:19:31,688
He closed it.

392
00:19:31,722 --> 00:19:33,455
-He must be trying
to split us up.

393
00:19:36,855 --> 00:19:37,755
-Damn it.

394
00:19:37,788 --> 00:19:40,155
Kagome, where's the Jewel.

395
00:19:40,188 --> 00:19:41,555
-Huh?

396
00:19:41,588 --> 00:19:43,288
That way.

397
00:19:43,322 --> 00:19:44,955
-We're better off
looking for the Jewel

398
00:19:44,988 --> 00:19:47,855
than trying to regroup
with Miroku and Sango.

399
00:19:47,888 --> 00:19:52,122
[grunt]

400
00:19:52,155 --> 00:19:52,622
-Huh?

401
00:19:55,955 --> 00:19:56,396
InuYasha?

402
00:20:00,455 --> 00:20:02,855
[gasp]

403
00:20:02,888 --> 00:20:10,288
-[roar] [snarling]

404
00:20:10,322 --> 00:20:11,822
NARAKU: Don't look so surprised.

405
00:20:11,855 --> 00:20:13,755
Surely you must
have realized what

406
00:20:13,788 --> 00:20:15,255
it would mean to
approach the Shikon

407
00:20:15,288 --> 00:20:17,355
Jewel after I defiled it.

408
00:20:17,388 --> 00:20:19,655
InuYasha is but a
weak half demon.

409
00:20:19,688 --> 00:20:24,055
It seems his spirit has been
consumed by the Jewel's poison.

410
00:20:24,088 --> 00:20:26,855
-Hey, snap out of it.

411
00:20:26,888 --> 00:20:28,888
Ah!

412
00:20:28,922 --> 00:20:30,488
-What's wrong, Kagome?

413
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:33,088
All you need to do is calm
him down, and purify him.

414
00:20:38,055 --> 00:20:40,488
[chuckling] But
you can't, can you,

415
00:20:40,522 --> 00:20:42,555
not as long as your
spiritual power remains

416
00:20:42,588 --> 00:20:43,522
sealed by Magatsuhi.

417
00:20:47,422 --> 00:20:49,355
You can not escape.

418
00:20:49,388 --> 00:20:50,322
-[gasp]

419
00:20:50,355 --> 00:20:52,822
-The demon form of
InuYasha will not

420
00:20:52,855 --> 00:20:56,255
rest until he's ripped
your body to shreds.

421
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:58,688
-[panting]

422
00:20:58,722 --> 00:21:02,122
-[growling]

423
00:21:10,422 --> 00:21:12,288
NARAKU: I should
give you a present.

424
00:21:17,188 --> 00:21:21,355
An arrow that's been completely
covered in my miasma.

425
00:21:21,388 --> 00:21:25,288
If you use it on InuYasha,
your life will be spared.

426
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:31,688
-Do you think I'm
that stupid, Naraku?

427
00:21:31,722 --> 00:21:34,122
You could never get
me to hurt InuYasha.

428
00:21:34,155 --> 00:21:35,855
And he would never hurt me.

429
00:21:35,888 --> 00:21:37,522
NARAKU: You think he's
not capable of it?

430
00:21:37,555 --> 00:21:39,488
You will soon understand.

431
00:21:39,522 --> 00:21:42,455
History will repeat
itself, Kagome.

432
00:21:42,488 --> 00:21:47,988
Like Kikyo, you too will
be slain by InuYasha.

433
00:21:48,022 --> 00:21:50,955
-[roar] Yah!

434
00:21:50,988 --> 00:21:53,888
-InuYasha.

435
00:21:53,922 --> 00:21:58,022
NARAKU: [cackling]
Poor, foolish girl.

436
00:22:08,533 --> 00:22:13,300
[music playing]

437
00:23:44,724 --> 00:23:46,691
SANGO: Was that really
how your father perished?

438
00:23:46,724 --> 00:23:48,658
-Calm down, Sango.

439
00:23:48,691 --> 00:23:50,958
KAGOME: Miroku and Sango
are tormented by illusions.

440
00:23:50,991 --> 00:23:53,258
And InuYasha's
inability to save Kikyo

441
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:55,491
comes back to haunt
him, yet again.

442
00:23:55,524 --> 00:23:57,124
NARAKU: You were but
a weak half demon.

443
00:23:57,158 --> 00:24:00,891
InuYasha is now completely
under my control.

444
00:24:00,924 --> 00:24:03,124
INUYASHA: Next time on
"InuYasha, The Final Act:

445
00:24:03,158 --> 00:24:05,158
Naraku, the Trap of Darkness."

446
00:24:05,191 --> 00:24:09,058
NARAKU: Forget everything
you knew-- your human heart,

447
00:24:09,091 --> 00:24:10,858
and Kagome.
