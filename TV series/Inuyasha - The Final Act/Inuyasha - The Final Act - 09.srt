[theme music]

2
00:01:44,501 --> 00:01:46,934
-In the-- the end,
I couldn't save you.

3
00:01:46,967 --> 00:01:48,767
KIKYO: It doesn't matter.

4
00:01:48,801 --> 00:01:51,034
You came for me.

5
00:01:51,067 --> 00:01:54,967
That was enough.

6
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:55,467
-Kikyo.

7
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:08,067
-It's so warm.

8
00:02:08,101 --> 00:02:10,601
Inuyasha?

9
00:02:10,634 --> 00:02:12,201
-Kikyo doesn't want
us to mourn her.

10
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:19,967
She says She'll
protect us forever.

11
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:22,101
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER):
Sesshomaru in the Underworld.

12
00:02:29,267 --> 00:02:32,567
RIN: Master Jaken, why has Lord
Sesshomaru brought us here?

13
00:02:32,601 --> 00:02:34,034
JAKEN: How would I know?

14
00:02:34,067 --> 00:02:35,534
For the past few
days, he appears

15
00:02:35,567 --> 00:02:37,401
to have been searching
for something, though.

16
00:02:37,434 --> 00:02:40,734
-If he's searching that hard,
I guess it must be important.

17
00:02:40,767 --> 00:02:41,867
-Of course it is important!

18
00:02:45,934 --> 00:02:46,901
-(VOICEOVER) Lady Kikyo.

19
00:02:50,034 --> 00:02:51,467
The light I saw last night.

20
00:02:51,501 --> 00:02:53,934
It was yours, wasn't it?

21
00:02:57,567 --> 00:02:59,834
-I'm sorry, Kohaku.

22
00:02:59,867 --> 00:03:03,401
I'm sorry we couldn't take
you to the priestess in time.

23
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:04,567
-It's my fault.

24
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,467
If only I was stronger.

25
00:03:12,801 --> 00:03:13,701
Huh?

26
00:03:13,734 --> 00:03:14,434
-What is it?

27
00:03:22,434 --> 00:03:24,767
-Lord Sesshomaru, wait!

28
00:03:34,267 --> 00:03:37,567
Lord Sesshomaru!

29
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:38,501
Huh?

30
00:03:38,534 --> 00:03:39,734
-Sesshomaru.

31
00:03:39,767 --> 00:03:41,501
I thought that might be you.

32
00:03:41,534 --> 00:03:42,601
-Who do you think you are?

33
00:03:42,634 --> 00:03:43,967
Show a little respect!

34
00:03:44,001 --> 00:03:46,134
That's Lord Sesshomaru to you.

35
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:48,701
-I can only assume you have
questions about the Tenseiga

36
00:03:48,734 --> 00:03:50,101
your father left you.

37
00:03:50,134 --> 00:03:52,967
I can think of no other reason
you'd come visit your mother.

38
00:03:53,001 --> 00:03:58,734
-M-- M-- Mo-- M-- M---
You're his mother?

39
00:03:58,767 --> 00:03:59,734
-I see.

40
00:03:59,767 --> 00:04:01,434
So, you were following
Naraku's scent.

41
00:04:01,467 --> 00:04:02,401
-Yeah.

42
00:04:02,434 --> 00:04:03,967
We figured it would
lead us to Koga.

43
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:06,434
-We wanted to get there
in time to help him fight.

44
00:04:06,467 --> 00:04:08,767
-Unfortunately, we
didn't make it in time.

45
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:11,101
SHIPPO (VOICEOVER): Yeah right.

46
00:04:11,134 --> 00:04:13,234
-Well, what matters
is that you came.

47
00:04:13,267 --> 00:04:15,534
-I'm sure Koga must've
been relieved to see you.

48
00:04:15,567 --> 00:04:16,767
-Yeah.

49
00:04:16,801 --> 00:04:19,767
-It's just that Koga must
feel really frustrated

50
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:23,167
that his shards were taken away.

51
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:25,701
-Kagome, are you gonna be OK?

52
00:04:25,734 --> 00:04:27,434
-Yeah.

53
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,001
-Wish I could see that.

54
00:04:29,034 --> 00:04:31,601
My legs feel like
they're made of lead now.

55
00:04:31,634 --> 00:04:34,734
I guess I just didn't
expect to survive like this.

56
00:04:34,767 --> 00:04:35,701
-Mm-mm.

57
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,367
It's a blessing
you're still alive.

58
00:04:37,401 --> 00:04:40,734
Shards or no shards,
you've helped us so much.

59
00:04:40,767 --> 00:04:42,567
-Anyway.

60
00:04:42,601 --> 00:04:44,934
KAGOME: Koga.

61
00:04:44,967 --> 00:04:45,767
-Oh hey.

62
00:04:48,934 --> 00:04:50,101
-You leaving?

63
00:04:50,134 --> 00:04:52,067
-There's no sense me
sticking around any longer.

64
00:04:52,101 --> 00:04:55,167
I'll only end up
holding you guys back.

65
00:04:55,201 --> 00:04:56,267
-I see.

66
00:04:56,301 --> 00:04:58,901
So you're leaving us too.

67
00:04:58,934 --> 00:05:01,667
-Quit feeling
sorry for yourself.

68
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,034
Wait.

69
00:05:03,067 --> 00:05:05,601
You know, I don't mean to sound
harsh, Inuyasha, (SHOUTING)

70
00:05:05,634 --> 00:05:07,567
but do you think you're
the only one suffering?

71
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:09,401
Huh?

72
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,701
-I know.

73
00:05:10,734 --> 00:05:12,067
-I mean, look at me.

74
00:05:12,101 --> 00:05:15,001
Try to imagine how it feels
for me to leave Kagome behind.

75
00:05:15,034 --> 00:05:16,301
You think that doesn't hurt?

76
00:05:16,334 --> 00:05:17,234
-You're right.

77
00:05:17,267 --> 00:05:18,967
-Would you stop
agreeing with me?

78
00:05:19,001 --> 00:05:20,634
It's creeping me out!

79
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:21,634
-Wolf boy.

80
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:23,201
I'm only sitting
here listening to you

81
00:05:23,234 --> 00:05:24,901
talk 'cause you're
injured, all right?

82
00:05:24,934 --> 00:05:26,834
Now back off!

83
00:05:26,867 --> 00:05:27,534
-Um, Koga--

84
00:05:27,567 --> 00:05:28,467
-See that?

85
00:05:28,501 --> 00:05:30,201
He's acting like a dumb dog.

86
00:05:30,234 --> 00:05:32,801
Looks like he's got a long
recovery ahead of him.

87
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:34,367
-Look, Kagoma.

88
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:37,234
What he needs now is to
have you by his side.

89
00:05:37,267 --> 00:05:38,367
-I know.

90
00:05:38,401 --> 00:05:39,701
Thanks Koga.

91
00:05:39,734 --> 00:05:41,801
I'm sorry to make
you worry so much.

92
00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:43,167
-I know.

93
00:05:43,201 --> 00:05:45,501
-You take care of yourself, OK?

94
00:05:45,534 --> 00:05:49,401
-Yeah, you too Kagome.

95
00:05:49,434 --> 00:05:52,001
-(VOICEOVER) Damn you, Koga.

96
00:05:52,034 --> 00:05:52,567
-All right.

97
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:53,134
Bye Kagome!

98
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:54,634
-See you soon!

99
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:56,201
-You take care.

100
00:05:56,234 --> 00:05:56,834
-Goodbye.

101
00:05:56,867 --> 00:05:57,501
-INUYASHA: Koga!

102
00:06:00,601 --> 00:06:03,201
Listen wold boy, if you
think you lost your jewel

103
00:06:03,234 --> 00:06:04,834
shards for nothing,
you're wrong.

104
00:06:04,867 --> 00:06:07,234
Your effort won't go to waste.

105
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:10,001
-Yeah, w I'm
holding you to that.

106
00:06:10,034 --> 00:06:12,067
Kagome, feel free
to come look me up

107
00:06:12,101 --> 00:06:13,601
if you get sick of the pup.

108
00:06:13,634 --> 00:06:14,534
-Sure.

109
00:06:14,567 --> 00:06:16,767
-Well, let's go, Koga.

110
00:06:16,801 --> 00:06:19,401
-We'll run nice and
slow so you can keep up.

111
00:06:19,434 --> 00:06:19,901
-Whoa!

112
00:06:19,934 --> 00:06:20,467
Hang on!

113
00:06:20,501 --> 00:06:21,734
-Wait up, Koga!

114
00:06:21,767 --> 00:06:24,834
-And just like
that, they're gone.

115
00:06:24,867 --> 00:06:26,667
-Huh?

116
00:06:26,701 --> 00:06:27,534
-What is it?

117
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:33,601
-(VOICEOVER) It's coming
from above those clouds.

118
00:06:33,634 --> 00:06:37,801
I can smell Sesshomaru,
and some other demon.

119
00:06:47,967 --> 00:06:49,167
-Sesshomaru.

120
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:52,601
As I recall, you used to
despise humans, did you not?

121
00:06:52,634 --> 00:06:55,967
And yet here you are with two
human children in your company.

122
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:58,234
Perhaps you intend to eat them.

123
00:06:58,267 --> 00:07:01,134
-Tenseiga can be used to open
a path to the underworld.

124
00:07:01,167 --> 00:07:03,867
Father must have told you
about it at some point.

125
00:07:03,901 --> 00:07:04,701
-Oh?

126
00:07:04,734 --> 00:07:06,101
Your father never spoke of it.

127
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,601
He simply gave me
this Meido stone.

128
00:07:08,634 --> 00:07:10,234
-A Meido stone?

129
00:07:10,267 --> 00:07:13,201
-He told me to use if you should
ever come to me for advice.

130
00:07:13,234 --> 00:07:15,967
Oh, and he mentioned
something else as well.

131
00:07:16,001 --> 00:07:18,334
As I recall, he said that
using the Meido stone

132
00:07:18,367 --> 00:07:20,767
would place you in great
danger, but he told me not

133
00:07:20,801 --> 00:07:23,234
to be worried or sad about that.

134
00:07:23,267 --> 00:07:25,234
-She seems to be really
good at not worrying.

135
00:07:25,267 --> 00:07:26,634
-(VOICEOVER) This
explains a lot.

136
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:28,734
Like mother, like son.

137
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,734
-What ever shall I do?

138
00:07:30,767 --> 00:07:33,734
Your mother is
terribly distressed.

139
00:07:33,767 --> 00:07:36,134
-Your words are
hollow, as always.

140
00:07:36,167 --> 00:07:37,034
-Very well, then.

141
00:07:37,067 --> 00:07:38,401
I shall have you entertain me.

142
00:07:40,801 --> 00:07:41,501
-Meido Zangetsuha!

143
00:07:45,001 --> 00:07:47,634
-So this is Sesshomaru's Meido.

144
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,701
It's nowhere near
a complete circle.

145
00:07:49,734 --> 00:07:51,001
-What?

146
00:07:51,034 --> 00:07:53,167
You mean Lord Sesshomaru's
sword can't cut through it?

147
00:07:53,201 --> 00:07:54,834
-It's a hound from
the underworld.

148
00:07:54,867 --> 00:07:57,101
At present, Sesshomaru,
it would appear

149
00:07:57,134 --> 00:08:00,467
that your sword can neither
do any real harm nor any good.

150
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:07,034
Wait, Sesshomaru!

151
00:08:07,067 --> 00:08:09,601
You intend to take the
path to the underworld.

152
00:08:09,634 --> 00:08:10,401
For what?

153
00:08:10,434 --> 00:08:12,134
To save two human children.

154
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:15,001
You have never been prone
to such foolishness.

155
00:08:15,034 --> 00:08:17,367
-Nor am I prone
to it now, mother.

156
00:08:17,401 --> 00:08:19,267
-Lord Sesshomaru!

157
00:08:19,301 --> 00:08:23,167
Please come back!

158
00:08:23,201 --> 00:08:25,634
-The tragedy here is that
none can return alive

159
00:08:25,667 --> 00:08:27,534
after the path has closed.

160
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:29,867
Oh, I tried to tell him, but
he just would not listen!

161
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:31,467
JAKEN (VOICEOVER):
You wait until now

162
00:08:31,501 --> 00:08:33,534
to mention this little
piece of information?

163
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:40,234
-(VOICEOVER) There it is.

164
00:08:40,267 --> 00:08:42,867
A path leading straight
to the underworld.

165
00:08:58,101 --> 00:08:59,834
-I can understand that
his father might've

166
00:08:59,867 --> 00:09:03,734
wanted to test him,
but this is just cruel!

167
00:09:03,767 --> 00:09:04,701
-Stop crying.

168
00:09:04,734 --> 00:09:05,701
It's irritating.

169
00:09:05,734 --> 00:09:07,634
-What will happen to him?

170
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:10,001
What will happen
to Lord Sesshomaru?

171
00:09:10,034 --> 00:09:11,601
-Sacrifices are
an inevitable part

172
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,601
of mastering the
art of the sword.

173
00:09:18,867 --> 00:09:20,734
-(VOICEOVER): Minions
of the netherworld.

174
00:09:20,767 --> 00:09:22,534
Mindless creatures.

175
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:23,267
Healing Tenseiga!

176
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:33,934
INUKIMI: Minions of the
netherworld and the Meido hound

177
00:09:33,967 --> 00:09:36,067
are all demons of
the underworld.

178
00:09:36,101 --> 00:09:38,601
He used Healing Tenseiga
to cut them down.

179
00:09:38,634 --> 00:09:39,834
-He did?

180
00:09:39,867 --> 00:09:42,067
But why would Lord Sesshomaru
use healing powers?

181
00:09:42,101 --> 00:09:44,667
(VOICEOVER) I've only ever
seen him do that once before,

182
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:46,501
and it was to bring
Rin back to life.

183
00:09:46,534 --> 00:09:47,467
INUKIMI: Little demon.

184
00:09:47,501 --> 00:09:48,534
-Huh?

185
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:49,801
You mean me?

186
00:09:49,834 --> 00:09:51,701
My name is Jaken.

187
00:09:51,734 --> 00:09:54,134
-What is the relationship
between the human girl

188
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:55,301
and Sesshomaru?

189
00:09:55,334 --> 00:09:57,234
-Her relationship
to him, you say?

190
00:09:57,267 --> 00:09:59,034
Well, based on
what I've seen, one

191
00:09:59,067 --> 00:10:01,667
might say that he tends
to favor Rin over me,

192
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:04,467
despite my long years
of loyal service.

193
00:10:04,501 --> 00:10:06,334
-The human girl will die.

194
00:10:06,367 --> 00:10:06,834
-Huh?

195
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:13,967
-L-- Lord Sesshomaru.

196
00:10:14,001 --> 00:10:16,001
-It appears that
you're able to move.

197
00:10:16,034 --> 00:10:18,501
I suppose that's the power
of the Shikon jewel shard.

198
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:22,767
-The path.

199
00:10:28,801 --> 00:10:31,134
-Take Rin and run away.

200
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:31,667
-OK.

201
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:39,667
Wah!

202
00:10:48,867 --> 00:10:50,634
SESSHOMARU (VOICEOVER):
What lies ahead?

203
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:52,101
Is there something
at the other end

204
00:10:52,134 --> 00:10:55,201
of this path that can help me
to perfect the Meido Zangetsuha?

205
00:10:55,234 --> 00:10:59,267
-My lady, what will he find
when he reaches the underworld?

206
00:10:59,301 --> 00:11:00,534
-I don't know.

207
00:11:00,567 --> 00:11:03,667
In truth, I don't wish to know.

208
00:11:03,701 --> 00:11:06,034
Once he steps into the
darkness of the underworld,

209
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:07,134
he will be finished.

210
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,034
Despite his powers,
not even Sesshomaru

211
00:11:09,067 --> 00:11:11,001
will be able to return.

212
00:11:11,034 --> 00:11:13,367
Much less those
two human children.

213
00:11:13,401 --> 00:11:17,901
Sadly, there is no turning back
on the path to the underworld.

214
00:11:17,934 --> 00:11:19,734
-Hey, Rin?

215
00:11:19,767 --> 00:11:22,334
Lord Sesshomaru?

216
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:23,501
It's Rin.

217
00:11:23,534 --> 00:11:25,001
I don't think she's breathing.

218
00:11:25,034 --> 00:11:27,134
-Hm?

219
00:11:27,167 --> 00:11:28,467
INUKIMI: Sesshomaru.

220
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:31,601
The darkness of the underworld
is right in front of you.

221
00:11:38,103 --> 00:11:40,003
-You're sure Rin is dead?

222
00:11:40,036 --> 00:11:41,203
-She isn't breathing.

223
00:11:41,236 --> 00:11:43,503
And I can feel her body
getting colder and colder.

224
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,103
-Very well.

225
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:44,903
Set her down.

226
00:11:48,736 --> 00:11:50,903
(VOICEOVER) What is
the meaning of this?

227
00:11:50,936 --> 00:11:54,236
Where are the minions
of the netherworld?

228
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:57,038
INUKIMI: You cannot save
her if there are no minions

229
00:11:57,071 --> 00:11:58,938
of the netherworld
for you to kill.

230
00:11:58,971 --> 00:12:01,738
-Uh, does that
mean Rin will die?

231
00:12:01,771 --> 00:12:03,671
-The human girl
will have to die.

232
00:12:03,704 --> 00:12:04,971
-It can't be!

233
00:12:05,004 --> 00:12:06,704
-Although in
theory, she could be

234
00:12:06,738 --> 00:12:08,804
revived if Tenseiga
was used to cut down

235
00:12:08,838 --> 00:12:10,238
the guardian of the underworld.

236
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,071
[gas]

237
00:12:11,104 --> 00:12:12,471
-So there is hope for her yet.

238
00:12:12,504 --> 00:12:15,304
-However, in actual fact,
that would never happen.

239
00:12:15,338 --> 00:12:17,871
The guardian exists beyond the
darkness of the underworld,

240
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,871
and no one has ever
returned from the darkness.

241
00:12:20,904 --> 00:12:22,204
The girl's time has come.

242
00:12:22,238 --> 00:12:25,071
She cannot be saved.

243
00:12:25,104 --> 00:12:26,971
-Why, Tenseiga?

244
00:12:27,004 --> 00:12:28,071
Answer me!

245
00:12:28,104 --> 00:12:30,104
-Please forgive me,
Lord Sesshomaru.

246
00:12:30,138 --> 00:12:31,804
I was supposed to keep her safe.

247
00:12:31,838 --> 00:12:33,371
SESSHOMARU (VOICEOVER):
I never should

248
00:12:33,404 --> 00:12:36,304
have brought her with me.

249
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,404
When I summoned Rin back
from the netherworld

250
00:12:38,438 --> 00:12:41,838
after she was
killed by wolves, I

251
00:12:41,871 --> 00:12:43,504
should have left her
in a human village.

252
00:12:47,238 --> 00:12:47,771
-The darkness!

253
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:53,438
Lord Sesshomaru,
Rin's been taken.

254
00:12:58,104 --> 00:13:00,804
-So he leaped into the darkness.

255
00:13:00,838 --> 00:13:03,004
-Lord Sesshomaru is
my reason for living!

256
00:13:03,038 --> 00:13:05,138
I'd be lost without him!

257
00:13:05,171 --> 00:13:06,104
-Little demon--

258
00:13:06,138 --> 00:13:07,704
-It's Jaken, my lady!

259
00:13:07,738 --> 00:13:10,204
-I am not a heartless monster.

260
00:13:10,238 --> 00:13:13,304
It would sadden me as well if my
son were to lose his life while

261
00:13:13,338 --> 00:13:14,838
training with his sword.

262
00:13:14,871 --> 00:13:17,204
I intend to open a path for him.

263
00:13:17,238 --> 00:13:18,038
-You do?

264
00:13:18,071 --> 00:13:20,638
I expected no less, my lady!

265
00:13:20,671 --> 00:13:21,138
Huh?

266
00:13:27,904 --> 00:13:29,038
-A way out.

267
00:13:29,071 --> 00:13:31,204
INUKIMI: Please come
out, Sesshomaru.

268
00:13:31,238 --> 00:13:32,738
If you continue
towards me, you'll

269
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:34,471
be able to exit the underworld.

270
00:13:34,504 --> 00:13:37,271
However, this path I've
opened will soon close.

271
00:13:37,304 --> 00:13:41,304
And once it does, you will never
able to return to this world.

272
00:13:41,338 --> 00:13:43,671
-Kohaku, take this
path while it is open.

273
00:13:43,704 --> 00:13:44,171
-What?

274
00:13:50,438 --> 00:13:51,838
(VOICEOVER) A path is forming.

275
00:13:55,771 --> 00:13:57,938
SESSHOMARU (VOICEOVER):
It's Rin's scent.

276
00:13:57,971 --> 00:13:59,371
-Lord Sesshomaru, wait for me.

277
00:14:04,138 --> 00:14:05,704
JAKEN: So what will
happen to him now?

278
00:14:05,738 --> 00:14:07,838
-That fool is no
concern of mine.

279
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,238
He had his chance.

280
00:14:09,271 --> 00:14:10,638
-What?

281
00:14:10,671 --> 00:14:12,704
-Ignoring his
mother's kind gesture.

282
00:14:12,738 --> 00:14:14,838
What a spiteful child he is.

283
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:23,938
SESSHOMARU (VOICEOVER):
I smell death.

284
00:14:35,238 --> 00:14:36,538
-It's Rin.

285
00:14:36,571 --> 00:14:39,738
-I suppose that must be the
guardian of the underworld.

286
00:14:46,471 --> 00:14:46,938
-Whoa!

287
00:14:50,904 --> 00:14:52,871
Whoa!

288
00:14:52,904 --> 00:14:54,371
-That's the last time.

289
00:14:54,404 --> 00:14:56,538
I won't have you causing
me any unnecessary trouble.

290
00:14:56,571 --> 00:14:57,804
You understand?

291
00:14:57,838 --> 00:14:58,971
-Yes.

292
00:14:59,004 --> 00:15:00,604
(VOICEOVER) I can't
let my guard down.

293
00:15:00,638 --> 00:15:02,738
If I relax for a second,
I'll be swept away.

294
00:15:13,971 --> 00:15:17,304
A mountain of corpses?

295
00:15:17,338 --> 00:15:19,171
[roar]

296
00:15:23,671 --> 00:15:25,671
SESSHOMARU (VOICEOVER):
I'm coming for you, Rin.

297
00:15:31,571 --> 00:15:35,471
[scream]

298
00:15:35,504 --> 00:15:36,471
-He did it!

299
00:15:46,338 --> 00:15:47,804
-Please, Rin.

300
00:15:47,838 --> 00:15:49,571
You're safe now.

301
00:15:49,604 --> 00:15:51,304
Wake up.

302
00:15:51,338 --> 00:15:52,604
INUKIMI: That's odd.

303
00:15:52,638 --> 00:15:54,871
The guardian of the
underworld has been cut down,

304
00:15:54,904 --> 00:15:56,871
and yet she remains lifeless.

305
00:15:56,904 --> 00:15:57,738
Little demon--

306
00:15:57,771 --> 00:15:59,704
-It's Jaken, as I've told you.

307
00:15:59,738 --> 00:16:02,204
But you've no intention
of remembering my name.

308
00:16:02,238 --> 00:16:04,404
-Tell me, is it
possible the human girl

309
00:16:04,438 --> 00:16:07,471
has been revived by
Tenseiga once before?

310
00:16:07,504 --> 00:16:08,538
-She has.

311
00:16:08,571 --> 00:16:10,104
Why do you ask, my lady?

312
00:16:10,138 --> 00:16:12,204
-Then she cannot be
brought back to life.

313
00:16:17,271 --> 00:16:19,071
SESSHOMARU (VOICEOVER):
She cannot be saved?

314
00:16:22,804 --> 00:16:23,938
-Is she OK, Lord Sesshomaru?

315
00:16:26,738 --> 00:16:29,171
SESSHOMARU (VOICEOVER):
I cannot save her?

316
00:16:29,204 --> 00:16:33,938
Tenseiga-- I let her die
for something like this.

317
00:16:38,004 --> 00:16:41,471
Nothing I could have gained
was worth losing her.

318
00:16:41,504 --> 00:16:42,538
Nothing at all.

319
00:16:48,104 --> 00:16:49,004
-Tenseiga's glowing.

320
00:17:04,771 --> 00:17:06,104
What's happening to them?

321
00:17:08,971 --> 00:17:10,171
They want help.

322
00:17:10,204 --> 00:17:12,671
It's like they're
pleading with Tenseiga.

323
00:17:12,704 --> 00:17:14,771
SESSHOMARU (VOICEOVER):
You all wish to be saved.

324
00:17:14,804 --> 00:17:15,771
Is that it?

325
00:17:28,604 --> 00:17:29,071
-Huh?

326
00:17:44,371 --> 00:17:47,638
-The corpses of the underworld
are all being purified.

327
00:17:47,671 --> 00:17:49,738
SESSHOMARU: Meido Zangetsuha!

328
00:17:49,771 --> 00:17:50,238
-Huh?

329
00:17:53,704 --> 00:17:56,438
He's opened another
path to the underworld!

330
00:17:56,471 --> 00:17:58,571
and it is so much bigger
than it was before!

331
00:18:03,238 --> 00:18:04,704
Oh, Lord Sesshomaru!

332
00:18:04,738 --> 00:18:05,538
-So you've returned.

333
00:18:10,771 --> 00:18:12,038
What's wrong, Sesshomaru?

334
00:18:12,071 --> 00:18:14,004
You look so sad.

335
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:16,171
Tenseiga has matured
considerably,

336
00:18:16,204 --> 00:18:18,838
and your Meido has expanded,
just as you'd hoped.

337
00:18:18,871 --> 00:18:21,104
Isn't that cause
for celebration?

338
00:18:21,138 --> 00:18:23,204
-Did you know this
would happen to Rin?

339
00:18:23,238 --> 00:18:24,738
Did you, mother?

340
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,438
-If I'm not mistaken,
you have already

341
00:18:26,471 --> 00:18:29,671
used Tenseiga to revive
her once, have you not?

342
00:18:29,704 --> 00:18:33,238
Son, Tenseiga can only call a
person back from the dead once.

343
00:18:33,271 --> 00:18:34,804
-Hm?

344
00:18:34,838 --> 00:18:36,304
-It only makes sense.

345
00:18:36,338 --> 00:18:38,904
Life is not supposed to
be limitless, after all.

346
00:18:38,938 --> 00:18:41,671
It's not something that can
be renewed over and over again

347
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,271
for your own convenience.

348
00:18:43,304 --> 00:18:44,938
Sesshomaru, had
you come to believe

349
00:18:44,971 --> 00:18:46,604
that you were a god, perhaps?

350
00:18:46,638 --> 00:18:49,138
That you did not need to fear
death, as long as Tenseiga

351
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:50,871
was in your hands?

352
00:18:50,904 --> 00:18:52,904
You needed to learn two things.

353
00:18:52,938 --> 00:18:54,838
The desire to save the
life of a loved one

354
00:18:54,871 --> 00:18:57,871
taken by death, and the
sorrow and fear which

355
00:18:57,904 --> 00:18:59,771
companies that loss.

356
00:18:59,804 --> 00:19:02,704
SESSHOMARU (VOICEOVER):
Sorrow and fear.

357
00:19:02,738 --> 00:19:05,071
-Your father wanted
me to tell you this.

358
00:19:05,104 --> 00:19:07,304
Tenseiga is a sword for healing.

359
00:19:07,338 --> 00:19:09,704
Only a person who values
life and possesses

360
00:19:09,738 --> 00:19:12,104
a compassionate heart
may wield such a weapon

361
00:19:12,138 --> 00:19:14,738
and use its power to
bury their enemies.

362
00:19:14,771 --> 00:19:16,438
That is the
requirement of any who

363
00:19:16,471 --> 00:19:19,838
wish to be worthy of Tenseiga,
a sword that can save lives,

364
00:19:19,871 --> 00:19:21,204
and condemn others.

365
00:19:21,238 --> 00:19:22,804
JAKEN (VOICEOVER):
So Rin had to die

366
00:19:22,838 --> 00:19:25,238
in order for Lord Sesshomaru
to learn about compassion?

367
00:19:28,204 --> 00:19:30,338
-Little demon, why
are you crying?

368
00:19:30,371 --> 00:19:32,304
-The name's Jaken, my lady.

369
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:35,104
It's just that Lord
Sesshomaru by his very nature

370
00:19:35,138 --> 00:19:38,571
will never shed tears, so
I must cry in his stead.

371
00:19:38,604 --> 00:19:39,504
-Oh.

372
00:19:39,538 --> 00:19:41,471
Is that how you
feel, Sesshomaru?

373
00:19:44,204 --> 00:19:45,771
This is her last chance.

374
00:19:45,804 --> 00:19:46,404
You understand?

375
00:19:56,304 --> 00:19:57,538
-What is that?

376
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,938
-It's the little
girl's life which

377
00:19:58,971 --> 00:20:00,371
was left behind
in the underworld.

378
00:20:10,004 --> 00:20:12,171
-Hm?

379
00:20:12,204 --> 00:20:12,738
-Rin.

380
00:20:12,771 --> 00:20:13,204
-You're back!

381
00:20:15,904 --> 00:20:16,371
-Huh?

382
00:20:19,338 --> 00:20:20,538
Lord Sesshomaru.

383
00:20:20,571 --> 00:20:21,971
You're here.

384
00:20:22,004 --> 00:20:23,538
-You're OK now, Rin.

385
00:20:23,571 --> 00:20:24,904
-I am.

386
00:20:24,938 --> 00:20:27,004
-Excuse me, my good lady.

387
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:30,204
Please allow me to thank you
on Lord Sesshomaru's behalf.

388
00:20:30,238 --> 00:20:33,038
-Is Sesshomaru happy that
I've brought her back?

389
00:20:33,071 --> 00:20:35,571
-Very happy, I presume.

390
00:20:35,604 --> 00:20:39,071
INUKIMI: All this fuss
over a little human girl.

391
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:41,704
He's inherited one of his
father's more unusual traits.

392
00:20:45,638 --> 00:20:47,138
KOHAKU (VOICEOVER):
I'll follow them.

393
00:20:47,171 --> 00:20:50,038
If anyone can destroy
Naraku, it's Lord Sesshomaru.

394
00:20:50,071 --> 00:20:52,071
I'm sure of it.

395
00:20:52,104 --> 00:20:53,004
INUKIMI: Child.

396
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:54,871
-Hm?

397
00:20:54,904 --> 00:20:56,538
-I have a question for you.

398
00:20:56,571 --> 00:20:59,438
How was it you were able
to survive the underworld?

399
00:20:59,471 --> 00:21:02,204
As far as I knew, that was
only possible for demons.

400
00:21:02,238 --> 00:21:03,471
Never for humans.

401
00:21:03,504 --> 00:21:06,671
-It's because my life is
sustained by a Shikon jewel

402
00:21:06,704 --> 00:21:07,804
shard.

403
00:21:07,838 --> 00:21:09,138
-I see.

404
00:21:09,171 --> 00:21:10,971
Then you'd best remember this.

405
00:21:11,004 --> 00:21:13,871
Your life cannot be
saved by Tenseiga.

406
00:21:13,904 --> 00:21:18,071
Just as the girl was beyond
its reach, so too are you.

407
00:21:18,104 --> 00:21:19,038
-Thank you.

408
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:20,204
I will remember that.

409
00:21:22,804 --> 00:21:24,204
-Kikyo said that?

410
00:21:24,238 --> 00:21:25,204
-Protect the last shard.

411
00:21:25,238 --> 00:21:28,138
Protect Kohaku's light.

412
00:21:28,171 --> 00:21:34,004
This is something
only you can do now.

413
00:21:34,038 --> 00:21:34,904
-Protect his light?

414
00:21:34,938 --> 00:21:36,371
What is that supposed to mean?

415
00:21:36,404 --> 00:21:38,304
-I presume she wants
Kagome to purify

416
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,604
his shard as she
was trying to do.

417
00:21:40,638 --> 00:21:42,271
-If she wanted
that, then does it

418
00:21:42,304 --> 00:21:44,671
mean that Kohaku's shard can
still be used to a weapon

419
00:21:44,704 --> 00:21:45,838
to defeat Naraku?

420
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:48,171
-I don't really know
what Kikyo meant by that,

421
00:21:48,204 --> 00:21:50,938
and I don't know what she
wanted for Kohaku either,

422
00:21:50,971 --> 00:21:53,638
but I do know she wanted us
to find him and protect him,

423
00:21:53,671 --> 00:21:56,771
so I say we start looking.

424
00:21:56,804 --> 00:21:57,504
All right.

425
00:21:57,538 --> 00:21:58,071
Let's go.

426
00:22:08,626 --> 00:22:11,493
[theme music]

427
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,960
INUYASHA (VOICEOVER):
I couldn't save Kikyo.

428
00:23:46,993 --> 00:23:49,226
FLOWER PRINCE: The woman
you loved most in this world

429
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,660
has died, hasn't she?

430
00:23:50,693 --> 00:23:52,660
You must be sad.

431
00:23:52,693 --> 00:23:55,360
Sad enough to follow
her into death.

432
00:23:55,393 --> 00:23:56,960
KAGOME: We encounter
the Flower Prince,

433
00:23:56,993 --> 00:23:59,726
a demon that feasts on
people's sorrow and pain.

434
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,293
Inuyasha is lured in and
trapped by his dreams of Kikyo.

435
00:24:03,326 --> 00:24:05,393
INUYASHA: Next time on
"InuYasha, The Final Act."

436
00:24:05,426 --> 00:24:07,860
Flowers Drenched in Sadness.

437
00:24:07,893 --> 00:24:10,726
FLOWER PRINCE: I merely showed
you the dreams you wish to see.
