1
00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:14,583
[AOI]
There we go!

2
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:18,791
So, are you going to
get up anytime soon?

3
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:20,708
The day is wasting
away, you two.

4
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:21,833
[AKANE groaning]

5
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:23,916
The day can go stuff it.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,083
[AOI]
Everyone else is already awake.

7
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:27,875
What for?

8
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:29,125
[gasps]

9
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:32,041
[AKANE] Why didn't you
tell me it was so late?

10
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:33,458
Sorry, gotta go!

11
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:34,875
Huh?

12
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:38,208
[AKANE] Every day in the
Sakurada household is a battle.

13
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:40,166
[SHU]
Hey, Haruka, get a move on.

14
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,375
Teru's about to burst.

15
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,458
Don't worry, Big Bro...

16
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:45,875
[AKANE] You see,
I say "battle" because--

17
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:46,916
[groans]

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,791
Dad...

19
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,541
[AKANE]
Our family is huge.

20
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:52,000
And we have to scramble
for the bathroom.

21
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:53,666
[AOI]
There. All set.

22
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,791
Thanks for helping me out, Aoi.

23
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:58,708
I hope you enjoy it. It's
a special veggie omelette.

24
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:00,791
And there's plenty more
where that came from.

25
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:02,875
[ALL]
Thanks for all the food, Mom!

26
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:04,500
[SATSUKI]
Darling, the paper can wait.

27
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:06,125
[SOICHIRO]
Uh. Of course, dear.

28
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:08,875
Ew! No one said anything
about peas for breakfast!

29
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:10,333
If you don't quit
being so picky,

30
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:12,416
you're never going
to get any taller.

31
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,000
Hey, Mom.

32
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:16,666
Since I'm not picky at all, does
that mean I'll grow up faster?

33
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,291
Yup! That's right.

34
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:20,125
Try not to eat so fast, Shiori.

35
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:21,750
[SHIORI]
Mh-hm.

36
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:23,000
[HARUKA]
Oh, right.

37
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,416
We're out of toilet paper.
Sorry about that.

38
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,458
Uh oh, who's in charge of
doing the shopping this week?

39
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:30,458
[KANADE]
It's Shu, right?

40
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:32,375
Me? Really?

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,791
In that case, I'll get
some after school today.

42
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:37,958
[AOI]
Thanks, Shu, you're a lifesaver.

43
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:40,083
[SATSUKI] We have the best
children in the whole world,

44
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:40,833
don't we?

45
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:41,833
[MISAKI]
Yeah, you do!

46
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:42,875
[giggles]

47
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:44,708
[AKANE]
So, that's my family.

48
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:47,875
Things can get kinda hectic when
you're one of nine siblings.

49
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:50,625
But we do our best
to make it work.

50
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:52,208
If you saw us,

51
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:54,500
you'd probably think we were
like any run-of-the-mill family.

52
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:56,458
But there's something
special about us

53
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:58,333
that makes us less
than ordinary.

54
00:01:58,416 --> 00:01:59,750
[SOICHIRO]
It's fine. I don't need to rush.

55
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:02,250
[SATSUKI] The driver is
already waiting for you.

56
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:04,166
Why are you wearing
your crown, Dad?

57
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,708
[SOICHIRO]
Well, I...

58
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:08,125
I accidently brought it home
with me so I thought, "why not?"

59
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:10,583
You actually look
like royalty, Daddy!

60
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:13,291
[SOICHIRO] I hope so.
I am the king, after all.

61
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:14,875
[AKANE]
Yep, that's right.

62
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:19,250
Our dad just so happens to be
this country's king. Crazy, huh?

63
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,541
[AOI]
Have a good day, Dad.

64
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:58,541
[SATSUKI]
Take care, honey.

65
00:03:58,625 --> 00:03:59,916
Thanks, you too.

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,541
And, dear, I'll be home
in time for dinner tonight.

67
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:03,458
Okay!

68
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,041
Have a good day, Daddy.

69
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,708
You too, pumpkin.

70
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:11,333
Sorry about the noise, every
morning. We try to keep it down.

71
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:13,416
[SHIORI]
Sorry.

72
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,625
The cherry blossoms
are almost gone.

73
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,166
Yeah.

74
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,250
This weekend might be our last
chance for a viewing party.

75
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,166
What a shame.

76
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,250
[OLD MAN] Good morning.
Lovely day, isn't it?

77
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:24,500
Why yes, it is indeed.

78
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,083
You have a great day, sir.

79
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,625
Good morning, have a good one.

80
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,041
So, I was thinking,

81
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,500
we could have a picnic before
they're all gone and--

82
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:32,541
[WOMAN] Well, look who it
is! Good morning, everyone.

83
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,875
Have a wonderful day, ma'am.

84
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,458
[GIRL]
Bye, bye!

85
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:39,208
Yeah, uh, bye, bye.

86
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:40,458
[AOI, KANADE sigh]

87
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:43,458
There's no reason for
you to be so shy, Akane.

88
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,083
Just get over it already.

89
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,375
[AOI] Aw, c'mon,
leave her alone, Kanade.

90
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:48,375
[KANADE]
Whatever.

91
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:49,541
[AKANE]
Even though we're royalty,

92
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,708
we live in town just
like everybody else.

93
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,708
Dad wants us to have as
normal a life as possible.

94
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,166
And we do, for the most part,

95
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,125
but we also have to deal
with being local celebrities.

96
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:02,250
Which, as you can imagine,
causes some problems.

97
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,125
For example...

98
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,625
[shrieking]

99
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,208
[AKANE] They moved
the surveillance cameras

100
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:11,333
around again!

101
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,375
I just memorized
where they all were!

102
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,083
That's pretty impressive
in its own right.

103
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,291
I don't want praise!
I want privacy!

104
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,875
It can't be helped.

105
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:21,250
They're just monitoring us
in order to keep us safe.

106
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,833
We are royalty, y'know.

107
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:25,791
[AKANE]
Yeah, I get that. But...

108
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,875
Don'tcha think 2,000
of them is overkill?

109
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,083
Akane, that memory of yours
is nothing to scoff at.

110
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,666
If I knew where all
the cameras were,

111
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,625
I'd be showing off
to everybody nonstop.

112
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,041
What for?

113
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:40,041
[KANADE] To win them over
before the election, duh.

114
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,791
We're all in line for
the throne, remember?

115
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,041
[AKANE crying]

116
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,708
Why does there have to
be a stupid election?

117
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,333
There's nothing we can do.

118
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:49,125
Dad already made up his mind.

119
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,541
[AKANE]
Wait! You're serious?

120
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:52,708
Well, I'm not joking.

121
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:55,333
I could've sworn I
told you all of this.

122
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,500
Once Aoi graduates,
we'll hold an election

123
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,625
and let the public
decide their next king.

124
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,833
That's been my plan
from the beginning.

125
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,083
We'll hold it in March

126
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:05,250
and announce the final
results in early April.

127
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,583
You don't have a lot of time,
so do your very best.

128
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,875
[SOICHIRO laughing]

129
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,125
[AKANE]
Why is he doing this to me?

130
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,833
[KANADE]
Whoa! Is that the time?

131
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,125
I'm gonna be late
for Student Council!

132
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:19,208
Guess I'm off, too.
I'll catch you later.

133
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,500
We should probably get
moving. Are you ready?

134
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,333
[AKANE]
The camera's still there.

135
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,666
Well. Would it help if I went
out and distracted it for you?

136
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,666
They're slow, so it
should be easy.

137
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,958
[AKANE]
You're a lifesaver!

138
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,875
[screaming]

139
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:40,666
[AOI] The cameras must have
gotten an upgrade as well.

140
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,125
Poor Akane.

141
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,541
[AKANE groaning]

142
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,208
[AKANE] Now I have to come
up with a whole new route

143
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,791
just to avoid them.

144
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,916
There's no time. We're gonna
be late enough as it is.

145
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,916
[AKANE groans]

146
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,833
Fine. I'll do it.

147
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,166
[AOI]
Are you sure about that?

148
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,375
Every time you use it, you end
up feeling like you cheated.

149
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,041
Yeah, but I'd feel
a whole lot worse

150
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,791
if I made you late
for school again, Aoi.

151
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,583
You're so thoughtful.

152
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,833
[AKANE]
Take my hand.

153
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,375
Okay.

154
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,333
[AKANE]
Each member of the royal family

155
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:20,250
has a unique special
power we can use.

156
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,958
Think of them as a
"proof of royalty."

157
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,833
My power lets me change
the weight of my own body,

158
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:28,750
along with anything I
happen to be touching.

00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,416
[AOI] Akane, would you fly
a little slower, please?

160
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,291
Huh? What for?

161
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,708
How to put it? I see
London, I see France.

[BOTH screaming]

164
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,750
[AKANE] As you can see,
my power requires some finesse.

165
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,000
[KUSUNOKI]
Your Majesty.

166
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,375
I'm sorry to repeat myself,

167
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:50,125
but I must insist you leave
the crown in the palace.

168
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,541
[SOICHIRO]
Yeah, yeah.

169
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,500
[KUSUNOKI] Please, sir,
my ulcer goes crazy

170
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:54,833
when I think it's been lost.

171
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,791
[SOICHIRO] That's because
you're a worrywart. Ha.

172
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,208
[KUSUNOKI]
Your Majesty!

173
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,125
[SOICHIRO]
How are my children doing?

174
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,625
Let's see.

175
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:04,208
Princess Shiori has already
arrived at her kindergarten.

176
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:07,541
Princesses Misaki and Hikari,
and Princes Haruka and Teru

177
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:10,541
will arrive at school
within five minutes.

178
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,916
[SOICHIRO]
Very good. Aoi and Akane?

179
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
[KUSUNOKI] Off the map.
They've used their powers.

180
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:18,333
Unfortunately, our cameras
aren't able to catch them.

181
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:19,583
[SOICHIRO]
Can't be helped.

182
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:20,750
They might cause you trouble,

183
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,250
but I'm glad you're
watching over them.

184
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,208
It's my honor, Your Majesty.

185
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:28,458
[SOICHIRO] Now then, time
to get down to business.

186
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:29,791
[KUSUNOKI]
If you wish an audience

187
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,166
with His Majesty, the king,
please step forward.

[KING'S AIDE]
Sir!

189
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:37,708
[AKANE]
I made it.

190
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,291
Rough morning, Princess?

191
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,458
I don't know how you even make
it through the day, Princess.

192
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,083
You both know I hate
being called that

193
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,000
when we're in school.

194
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,125
[KAREN] I guess this is the
only place you can blend in

195
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,208
with the crowd when
you're not hiding at home.

196

[AN]
Plus, there are no cameras here.

00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,958
Yeah!

198
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,125
Where did the day go?

199
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,500
Time really does fly
when you're having fun.

200
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:58,916
You're the only person I know

that loves school
more than anything.

202
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,166
It's kind of unhealthy.

203
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,416
[AKANE] It's just that
I feel normal here.

204
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,291
Everyone treats
me like an equal.

205

Yeah.

206
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,416
That's because we're friends.

It's Princess Aoi!

[STUDENT A]
Will you marry me?

210
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:17,291
[AKANE]
Or maybe I'm just not popular.

You really are amazing, sis.

could you tell us
more about the arrest?

words for the perpetrator?

Please stop filming me.

be any worse.

broadcast everything we do?

There's no reason to
be embarrassed, Akane.

It won't hurt when the
election rolls around, too.

they do a special on me?

It's that time.

approval ratings

[NEWSCASTER B] Go ahead,
Mr. Mashima, it's all yours.

253
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:57,333
According to the results from
the public opinion polls,

254
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,375
the first princess, Aoi,
is the most popular

255
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,833
among all age groups.

256
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,583
No shock there.

257
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:06,000
Second princess Kanade
is also quite popular.

[MR. MASHIMA]
It's hard to say for sure yet.

262
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,666
When you take the other
polls into account--

One of us is going to be chosen

as the country's
next king. But--

265
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,375
Wouldn't it be fun

266
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,416
if the youngest princess,
Shiori, got the throne?

267
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,875
It would be rather adorable.

268
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,291
I know, right?

00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:25,791
[AKANE]
They treat it like a joke.

270
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,500
I wouldn't be surprised
if we see a change

after the next public polling.

to become more popular.

As you may know,

00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:25,083
every member of the royal
family has a special power

that is unique to
each individual.

those powers in action

as the royal siblings play
a game for all to enjoy!

The goal is to get

303
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,791
as many of the Hairy Dandy
dolls from the roof as you can.

304
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,916
Whoever saves the most within
the time limit is the winner.

305
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,791
The rules are simple, but the
game may prove otherwise!

306
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,333
Before we start,
here's a message

Kids, I want you to go
all out, understand?

309
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:01,666
This contest will let the people
of the nation get to know you,

310
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,625
so you better not
hold back on them.

311
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,083
Because whoever comes in last

314
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,416
Dad can be so sadistic.

315
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,166
[AKANE] If that's all,
I'm okay with coming in last.

316
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,041
I'd rather clean than do
anything to stand out.

317
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,791
[NEWSCASTER B]
The clock's set for one hour.

318
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:21,208
[NEWSCASTER A]
Okay, I hope everyone's ready.

319
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,041
[NEWSCASTERS]
Let the game begin!

320
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,833
[SPECTATORS cheering]

321
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,250
[KANADE]
I could just use the elevator,

322
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,291
but that wouldn't
be very entertaining.

323
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,208
--[footsteps]
--[KANADE] Huh?

324
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,500
I'll see you losers at the top.

325
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,583
[NEWSCASTER A]
The third son,

326
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:37,708
Prince Teru's power
is "Limit Over."

327
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,291
All right! Let's rock!

328
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:43,708
[NEWSCASTER A]
With his super strength,

329
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:46,916
climbing this skyscraper
is child's play!

330
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,458
Uh-oh.

331
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:51,500
[NEWSCASTER A] Whoops! Looks
like he's having some trouble.

332
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,916
[NEWSCASTER B] I'm not sure
that I can watch this!

333
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,375
Okay! My turn!

334
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:58,875
Try not to go overboard.

335
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:02,208
[HIKARI] Yeah, yeah,
I know. This should work.

336
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,708
Let's see how
they like this one!

337
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,166
Go!

338
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:11,500
[NEWSCASTER A]
The fifth princess,

339
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,583
Hikari's power is "God Hand."

340
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:17,125
She can manipulate any
living creature's life force.

341
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,041
[NEWSCASTER B]
What a great strategy.

342
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:23,041
She's speeding up the growth of
the tree to get her to the roof!

343
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,750
I had a feeling you'd
try something like that.

344
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,083
[HIKARI]
Huh?

345
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,583
Wait! Quit growing!
Now you're too big!

346
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:31,958
[NEWSCASTER A]
The tree won't go back to normal

347
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:35,083
for 24 hours so I hope
she likes the view!

348
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,458
The idea has merit.

349
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,291
I mean, why reach
the top on your own

350
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:42,875
when it's far more efficient to
let something else do the work?

351
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:50,541
Okay! I'm counting on you!

352
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:51,666
[NEWSCASTER A]
The second princess,

353
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,750
Kanade's power
is "Heaven's Gate"!

354
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:56,541
She can make anything
appear just by thinking it!

355
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:58,125
[KANADE]
Yeah, but the problem is,

356
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:01,041
the value of the materialized
object is automatically deducted

357
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,541
from my bank account.

358
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:06,041
These drones are gonna
cost me about two million.

359
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,041
[TERU]
Hey!

360
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,083
Great. Get back up there.

361
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:13,750
No fair.

362
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,375
If I had robots,
I'd be winning, too!

363
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,583
[NEWSCASTER B] Teru and
Kanade score the first points

364
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:19,666
of the game.

365
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,791
I can't afford to
hold back either.

366
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,500
[NEWSCASTER A]
The fourth princess,

367
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,791
Misaki's power is "All for One."

368
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:32,291
She can create as many as
seven clones of herself!

369
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:34,708
We're in this to win it!

370
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,875
[RAIO]
I call dibs on the elevator!

371
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,833
[YUNIKO] Then I'll use
the emergency stairs.

372
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,291
[REVI]
This is so lame.

373
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,166
[SHAURA] I'll try extra
hard if Haruka's watching.

374
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,583
[BUBU]
If I help, do I get candy?

375
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:46,916
I'm taking my sweet time.

376
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,791
What? Say that again.

377
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:51,958
I'm sorry, but I still
don't know what you mean.

378
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,958
Don't worry, maybe
I can help you.

379
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,416
Okay.

380
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,458
Mr. Fire Hydrant was telling
me a shortcut I could use

381
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:00,083
to get to the top faster,
but I don't understand.

382
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,791
Well, what did he say?

383
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:04,416
"Take the B-2 elevator to 27.

384
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,750
And then switch to
the normal elevator."

385
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,458
Ah-ha! He means use the freight.

386
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,250
How can you be so sure?

387
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,666
My class came here on a field
trip when I was a little kid.

388
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,791
[NEWSCASTER A]
The sixth princess,

389
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,083
Shiori's power is
called "Soul Mate."

390
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:19,416
With it, she can talk to both
living and non-living things!

391
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,250
And the first princess,
Aoi's power is "Invisible Work."

392
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:26,875
Once she learns something,
she never forgets it!

393
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,583
Guess it's my turn.

394
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,958
After all, the camera's
pointing in our direction.

395
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:33,583
[AKANE screams] Don't leave me!

396
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:34,750
[NEWSCASTER A]
There's the first prince,

397
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,541
Shu and his "Transporter."

398
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,791
He uses it to instantly
teleport himself

399
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,625
and anything he's touching!

400
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,291
With each new display of power,

401
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,750
this game is getting more
exciting by the second!

[NEWSCASTER A] What do you
think of our contestants?

[SPECTATORS cheering]

00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,166
[HARUKA]
Calculating probabilities.

405
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:55,208
[NEWSCASTER B]
Look!

406
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:57,500
Prince Haruka's finally
making his move!

407
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:58,833
[NEWSCASTER A]
The second prince's power

408
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,666
is called "Lots of Next."

409
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,791
Whatever the situation,
he can tell you the odds!

410
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,958
[HARUKA]
Hey, Sis.

411
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,166
This is terrible!

412
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,125
Everybody's watching me
and I have no idea

413
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,791
what I'm should be doing!

414
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,916
[HARUKA]
Stop freaking out.

415
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
[AKANE]
But--

416
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,541
If you just stand here
and do nothing,

417
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:20,916
you have an 87% chance
of being last.

418
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,166
It's 74% for me.

419
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,375
But, if we work together,
my prediction says

420
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:28,291
that probability will
be reduced to 25%.

421
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:29,375
I like those odds.

422
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,625
[AKANE]
I don't care if I come in last.

423
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:32,958
[HARUKA]
Huh?

424
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:34,791
I'd much rather clean
bathrooms than stand out.

425
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,500
Leave me here, I'll be fine.

426
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,083
Um, Akane.

427
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:41,833
Do you know how many toilets
there are in the castle?

428
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,958
I'm not sure of
the exact number,

429
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:48,291
but the castle is so big. It's
gotta be in the double digits.

430
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:49,916
Not to mention all
of the foot traffic.

431
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,041
You'd be surrounded
by strangers all day.

432
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:56,083
I'm going for eighth. There's
no way I'm coming in last place.

433
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,583
Good! Let's work together.

434
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,541
[NEWSCASTER A]
The third princess,

435
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:05,708
Akane's power is "Gravity Core."

436
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:07,833
With it, she can manipulate
her body's weight

437
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:10,416
as well as anything
she's touching!

438
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,750
[HARUKA]
Why're you going so slow?

439
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:17,083
One spurt would have us
topside in a flash.

440
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:20,041
Yeah, I know, but it's
better than the alternative.

441
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:21,416
[HARUKA]
Which is?

442
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,458
[AKANE]
Showing my underwear.

443
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,333
Guess we have no choice.

444
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,416
Here, I'll help hold it down.

445
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,750
[gasps]

446
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,000
[AKANE] What do you think
you're doing, Haruka?

447
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,708
We might be siblings,
but there are some lines

448
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:34,791
you don't cross and
that was one of them!

449
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,333
Did anyone else see that
coming from a mile away?

450
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,500
[SHU]
And that makes 50.

451
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:41,375
You're so cool, Big Brother!

452
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:42,583
Keep doing your best, Teru.

453
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,250
I will!

454
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,708
Outta the way!

455
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,208
[SHU]
You all right, squirt?

456
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,458
Of course I am.
I knew we'd be okay.

457
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:04,791
Sure.

458
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:07,291
[TERU] But I have no idea
where we are right now.

459
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,791
[SHU]
Hm.

460
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,708
I dunno but at least we got
to see the cherry blossoms.

461
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,375
[TERU]
Yeah.

462
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:13,500
[SHU]
I guess what Akane said

463
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,541
had been stuck in
my head all week.

464
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:16,833
[SHU chuckles]

465
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:19,375
[TERU] Big Brother,
what're you holding?

466
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,416
[SHU]
Uh.

467
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,208
[AKANE]
Are you okay, Haruka?

468
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,291
What kind of question is that?

469
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,125
We almost hurt Teru and Shu--

470
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,041
[HARUKA gasps]

471
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,000
What is it now?

472
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:33,208
[HARUKA]
Down! Uh, Look down!

473
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:34,125
[squeals]

474
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,750
[SPECTATORS cheering]

475
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,583
If she hasn't died
of embarrassment yet,

476
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:41,416
she'll be coming
for my head. Lovely.

477
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,666
Well, we know there's
still plenty of time

478
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,250
left on the clock.

479
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,333
But we're going to call the game
on account of unmentionables.

480
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:49,791
Prince Shu is on top,

481
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:52,791
while princesses Akane and
Hikari are tied for last.

482
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:53,958
[HIKARI whines]

483
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,125
This sucks. I busted
my booty out there.

484
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,500
You spent the entire
game on top of a tree.

485
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,791
All right, let's take
a look at the polls.

486
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:04,500
Here are the current rankings
for the King Election!

487
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:07,083
These results were just
released to the public.

488
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,916
We can assure you that
they're completely accurate.

489
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,041
What? Why am I in fifth place?

490
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,166
I lost to Shiori.

491
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,791
[AKANE] I'm not on the board,
but is that a good or bad thing?

492
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:21,000
[NEWSCASTER B]
The third place sibling is.

493
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,958
Princess Kanade!

494
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,541
Uh. Sorry about that.

495
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:26,791
Yeah, of course you are.

496
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:28,583
[NEWSCASTER A]
Who will secure the top spot

497
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,500
for this week's ranking?

498
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:33,000
Will it be the first
princess, Aoi?

499
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:36,375
Or the crime fighting
princess, Akane?

500
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:41,083
[AKANE]
Oh, thank goodness!

501
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,833
That's not good at all!

502
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,875
I have to clean
bathrooms tomorrow.

503
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:48,708
Everyone and their dog
saw my underwear.

504
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,791
[crying]

505
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,166
Akane, you've barely
touched your dinner.

506
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,416
Is your tummy upset?

507
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,333
[AKANE groans]

508
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:56,666
[SHU sighs]

509
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,625
[SOICHIRO] I know this has
been tough on you kids,

510
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:03,125
but no one ever said that being
a member of the royal family

511
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,666
was easy.

512
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,375
Like it or not, you're going
to be scrutinized by the public.

513
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:08,875
But you can't let it get to you.

514
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:12,250
Being in the public eye is
simply one of your royal duties.

515
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:15,166
You children are symbols
of hope for this country.

516
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,625
Don't ever forget that.

517
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,666
At this point, it's impossible
to guess who'll succeed me.

518
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,958
But it's my duty to make
sure all of you are ready

519
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,250
to take on that responsibility.

520
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,083
That was a lovely speech, honey.

521
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:30,125
But it's hard to take you
seriously with that thing on.

522
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:33,291
I'll be sure to leave it
at the castle tomorrow.

523
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,500
[AOI]
What're you doing, Akane?

524
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:40,541
You should be sleeping.
Let's get to bed.

525
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:43,916
[AKANE] I wish I could turn
into a blooming dandelion.

526
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
[AOI]
Why?

527
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:46,375
[AKANE]
I could ride the wind,

528
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:49,541
away from people and
surveillance cameras.

529
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:53,791
There is one way you
could fix your problems.

530
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,625
All you have to do
is become king.

531
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,250
That way you could abolish
the use of surveillance cameras,

532
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:02,791
or even cancel the royal
family news altogether.

533
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,750
[AKANE]
Aoi, I'm going to be king.

534
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,125
[AOI]
Huh?

535
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:13,291
Once I have the crown,
I'll live a quiet life.

536
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,708
[AOI]
That sounds contradictory.

537
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:49,583
[KANADE]
Hi, I'm Kanade Sakurada.

538
00:23:49,666 --> 00:23:51,333
[SATSUKI]
My sweet Kanade has always been

539
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:52,791
an independent child.

540
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:54,916
When she was younger
she loved to play royalty,

541
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,375
and would run around
saying, "If you pwease,"

542
00:23:57,458 --> 00:23:59,208
just like a little princess.

543
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:01,125
[KANADE] Thankfully those
days are behind me.

544
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:02,583
[SATSUKI]
She may seem a little strict,

545
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:05,625
but she's really a gentle
soul who loves her siblings.

546
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:06,958
If she were to become king,

547
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:09,166
the country would probably
be filled to the brim

548
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,458
with hard-working,
orderly citizens.

549
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:13,375
[KANADE]
Sounds like a Golden Age to me.

550
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:16,000
Philip the II,
eat your heart out!
