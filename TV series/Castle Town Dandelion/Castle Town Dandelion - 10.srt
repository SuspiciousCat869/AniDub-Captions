00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:09,541
[NEWSCASTER 1B]
In other news, we've received

2
00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:12,083
the latest poll results
for the royal election.

3
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:14,416
On top is fan favorite:
Princess Aoi.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,041
Meanwhile, Princesses Kanade

5
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:17,916
and Akane are neck-n-neck
in their battle

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,583
for the second place spot.

7
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:21,333
Princess Aoi's
still got my vote,

8
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:23,333
that's for sure.
What about you, Sacchy?

9
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:24,958
Who's your vote going to?

10
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,416
[SACCHY]
It doesn't matter who wins.

11
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,083
Nothing's gonna change
after the election anyway.

12
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:30,833
It's gotta matter a little.

13
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:32,416
I never liked royalty.

14
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,250
They don't have to work
for anything they get

15
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,791
and they live free without
a care for the future.

16
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:39,708
They get to dance through
life on free royal passes.

17
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:42,416
They wouldn't know real
hardship if it bit them!

18
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,500
Oh...

19
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:44,791
[SACCHY]
I've worked hard, but some royal

20
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:46,458
could swoop in and replace me.

21
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:48,291
In fact, they could
probably become a top idol

22
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:49,875
without much effort at all!

23
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:51,208
Uh...

24
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:52,666
[SACCHY]
Uh...

25
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:56,625
It's not like I'm jealous
or anything crazy like that!

26
00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:58,875
No, of course you're
not. Not at all.

27
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:02,333
[AKANE groans] I've watched
this concert a million times

28
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:04,250
and it still makes
my heart soar!

29
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:06,291
You rock, Sacchy!

30
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:10,333
[AKANE] I wanna meet her!
No, I need to meet her!

31
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:12,041
Then go to the show.

32
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:14,958
[AKANE]
No, I mean really meet her!

33
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,125
Like talk to her and become
her best friend, y'know?

34
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:18,583
It's not like you
need permission.

35
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:20,041
You are royalty.

36
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:21,583
[AKANE] But it can't
be okay for me to use

37
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:23,583
my position for personal gain.

38
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:26,833
Although, we are talking
about meeting the Sacchy!

39
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:28,333
I don't think that
makes it okay.

40
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:29,916
[AKANE]
Yeah, you're right.

41
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,333
[MATSUOKA]
Here's my plan for your career.

42
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:12,041
As we get close to the election,
I want to reveal your identity.

43
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,291
Laito's become a huge
sensation and the fans

44
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:17,708
absolutely adore her energy!
She's not a one-hit-wonder!

45
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,958
If we went ahead and revealed
your true identity now,

46
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,083
think of the impact!

47
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,500
Hikari-mania would
sweep the polls!

48
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,833
If Laito's fan base
and Hikari's supporters

49
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,750
band together, they could
take you all the way

50
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,208
to the royal palace!

51
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,375
Then you'd be in a position
to make some real change!

52
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:34,666
So after this next concert,
Laito Sakurapa will retire

53
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,500
and the royal idol,
Hikari Sakurada will--

54
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,916
Uh. Are you even
listening to me, Laito?

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,166
Huh? Yeah.

56
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,708
Is something wrong?

57
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,916
You know I'm here if you ever
need to talk about anything.

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,375
[HIKARI]
It's this dumb hangnail.

59
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:48,708
Would it kill you
to pay attention

60
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:51,375
when we're talking
about important things?

61
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:53,791
[SACCHY]
I don't know why,

62
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,333
but my work as
an idol has seemed

63
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,666
so much more fulfilling lately.

64
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,000
[SACCHY] I've pushed
so hard to get this far

65
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:04,458
and I'm still giving it my all.
I'm getting better by the day.

66
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,458
Before, I always felt like
I was just going through

67
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:09,125
the motions when I performed.

68
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:12,333
But now, I'm loving
every minute of it.

69
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,500
[SACCHY] I think it's
all because of Laito.

70
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:17,666
[MATSUOKA]
Then it's decided.

71
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,875
Laito's gonna retire
after her next show.

72
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:24,291
[SACCHY]
What? She's gonna leave?

73
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,416
No. It's not possible!

74
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,208
She's at the top of her
career! Maybe not even!

75
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,583
She could probably rise
higher if she wanted!

76
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:34,291
What in the world could
make her want to quit now?

77
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,791
I guess if there was some
kind of trouble at home,

78
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:39,250
she'd have to leave her
music career behind.

79
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,916
Come to think of it, she's
never talks about her family.

80
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,625
Or anything outside
of work. I wonder why.

81
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:45,916
[MS. YAMAMOTO]
Hey there.

82
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,375
You were deep in thought.
Everything good?

83
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,833
Oh, yeah, everything's great.

84
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,875
[MATSUOKA] Laito's
popularity has skyrocketed

85
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:55,666
since her debut and she's
gaining a strong fan base.

86
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,625
Your collaboration
was a great success.

87
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,041
And your support
has meant a lot.

88
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,583
Thanks very much, Sacchy.

89
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,500
And, though you may not
be a permanent duo,

90
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:05,291
the fans did love seeing
you sing side-by-side.

91
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,750
Oh, yeah, they did!

92
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,541
So whaddya say we do it again?

93
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,791
Who's up for a Search
Light reunion show?

94
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,500
[HIKARI, SACCHY]
Mm...

95
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:15,125
[MATSUOKA]
Uh... So this concert.

96
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,333
Let's pull together
and make it special.

97
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,833
Sachiko. I want you
to take the lead.

98
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,708
[SACCHY]
I can't believe she's leaving.

99
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,958
Let's get out there and give 'em

100
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,250
one heck of a show.
All right then.

101
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,958
Make sure to take
good care of yourselves.

102
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,333
No getting sick now.

103
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:29,708
--[SACCHY] Of course.
--[HIKARI] Yes, sir.

104
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,333
[SACCHY]
They're not gonna say a word.

105
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,666
She's going to leave
and never come back.

106
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,291
Come on, that's enough! What
am I worrying about, anyway?

107
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:38,708
I got all the way here on my own

108
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:41,000
and survived fine
before she showed up.

109
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,625
I bet she has perfectly
good reasons to leave.

110
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:46,583
I'll just go back
to being alone.

111
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,625
[MATSUOKA]
What?! How'd you get the flu?!

112
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,333
[MS. YAMAMOTO]
I'm sorry, Mr. Matsuoka.

113
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:51,708
I have no idea how it happened.

114
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:52,875
Don't come in to work!

115
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,833
Even if you feel better,
you understand?

116
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,541
We can't risk an epidemic,
not with the concert so close!

117
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:58,875
[MS. YAMAMOTO]
Okay.

118
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,375
I can't believe poor
Ms. Yamamoto caught the flu.

119
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:02,958
Yeah.

120
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:04,791
And on top of that, we're now
short staffed for the concert.

121
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,166
We need some back up, quick.

122
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,625
Ah! Actually, I know
someone who would be

123
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,625
willing to work hard
for basically no pay!

124
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,375
Oh, really, who?

125
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,833
[MATSUOKA] We have a new
assistant joining us.

126
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:19,958
She'll be filling in for
Ms. Yamamoto until she recovers.

127
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:21,708
Meet Lady Akagi.

128
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:22,916
[MATSUOKA, HIKARI
laugh nervously]

129
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,041
[SACCHY]
The heck?

130
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,791
You can just call me Akagi.

131
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,250
I'm so grateful for the
opportunity to help out.

132
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,125
Lemme know if there's
anything you need.

133
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:33,125
Okay. Well, I'm excited
to work with you.

134
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,458
[SACCHY]
Wow, she's blushing like crazy.

135
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,416
Maybe this is her first job?

136
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,375
[AKANE] Wait, I get to
be Sacchy's assistant?

137
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:42,083
You would be our assistant!

138
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,291
I'm gonna hug her so
close and never let go!

139
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,083
Don't you even think about it!

140
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,791
After I transform you
with my powers,

141
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,125
we'll need a good disguise
so no one will recognize you.

142
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,875
You don't have to
worry about a thing!

143
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,458
I've got my pair of Jamming
Glasses, they'll do the trick.

144
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,500
[HIKARI] Um, I don't think
that those are gonna help.

145
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,958
Uh?

146
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,625
I am truly honored to
meet you, Your Highness.

147
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:03,708
Allow me to apologize for any
trouble we may have caused.

148
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,083
If you're gonna call
her "Your Highness,"

149
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,000
then why bother with a disguise?

150
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,916
[MATSUOKA] I must be polite
in front of the princess.

151
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,125
Thank you, but there's
no need for all of that.

152
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:13,791
Honestly, I'd rather you
just be yourself around me.

153
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:16,875
[gasps] My, what a
gracious gesture.

154
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:20,041
You're so humble. I'll do
anything I can to help.

155
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,375
[HIKARI]
Is he blushing?

156
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,125
He's never fawned
over me like that!

157
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,333
[music playing]

158
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,458
[AKANE] Hikari practices
for hours on end.

159
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,583
I never knew she had it in her.

160
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,500
[HIKARI] Everyone's gonna
know who I really am.

161
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,583
What'll they think of me
when I tell the truth?

162
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,208
And what about Laito?

163
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:48,958
[SACCHY] You're a little
off on that last part.

164
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,000
[gasps] Oh. I'm sorry.

165
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,291
Gotta make it right.

166
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:53,583
Or you'll regret it at the show.

167
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:56,041
[gasps] Yeah, guess so.

168
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,208
[gasps]

169
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,708
I'm gonna run to
the store real quick.

170
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:04,583
I'd be happy to go for you!

171
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,166
[SACCHY]
Thanks, but I got it.

172
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,083
I could really use
some fresh air.

173
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:10,541
[AKANE]
Okay. Be safe.

174
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:15,375
Do you think maybe she's
nervous about the show?

175
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:18,250
No, she just wants
everything to be perfect.

176
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:23,333
[SACCHY gasps]
I totally forgot my purse.

177
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:37,916
[SACCHY sighs]

178
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,833
Now what? This is
driving me crazy.

179
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,791
[sighs]

180
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,333
If it's gonna be
her final concert,

181
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,458
I can't let her down.

182
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:55,750
[MATSUOKA]
Aren't you and Sachiko supposed

183
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:56,625
to rehearse tonight?

184
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,416
Yeah, she just ran to the store.

185
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,708
I see. This is a big
concert for you two.

186
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,125
You ready for the world to
know your real identity?

187
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,541
Your fans are gonna
be so blown away!

188
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:07,625
I wanted to talk to you.

189
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:08,916
Huh?

190
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,250
It's about this "revealing
my identity" thing.

191
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,625
[MATSUOKA] What? You don't
want to do the reveal now?

192
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:16,250
I've been thinking about
why I became an idol.

193
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,083
At first, I was just
looking for an easy way

194
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,916
to campaign, y'know?

195
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,250
But now, it's different.

196
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,791
Being an idol has become
a special part of my life.

197
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:26,458
And I think that's because
this is the first time

198
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:29,250
I've ever had to work
for something on my own.

199
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,666
The first time. Huh.

200
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,791
When I see my fans cheering,

201
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:35,708
and I know it's because
of me, it's like...

202
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:39,958
...I finally understand how
much strength I have inside.

203
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,208
In the end,

204
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,041
the good I've done as
an idol belongs to Laito

205
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,000
and her crowds more than to me.

206
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,958
And it's not right to use
that for my own gain.

207
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,500
I love my fans.

208
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,416
And I'm so grateful
for their support.

209
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,458
Performing as Laito
is how I pay them back.

210
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,958
Okay then.

211
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,583
I hope your fans know how
lucky they are to have you.

212
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:01,000
[HIKARI] I can't tell you
how much this means to me.

213
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,375
But--

214
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:05,041
I still feel like I'm lying
to the entire agency.

215
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,666
Do you think I should tell them?

216
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,041
Everyone's been so
supportive of me.

217
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,000
[MATSUOKA]
That's a big decision to make.

218
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,291
Why don't you take some
time to think it over?

219
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,625
[HIKARI]
Okay.

220
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,000
[HIKARI]
Hey, can I ask you something?

221
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,333
Sure.

222
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:21,458
Okay, so...

223
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,333
If you keep up a lie
for a long time,

224
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:24,750
does it ever become the truth?

225
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:28,000
[gasps] Yes, it's possible,
but in the end,

226
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,791
it depends on who you're
lying to. You know?

227
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,125
Sorta.

228
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,583
If you're lying to yourself,
it'll never be true.

229
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,541
But what's worse than
that, it'll eventually

230
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,458
hurt the ones you love.

231
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,791
[MATSUOKA]
All right, ladies.

232
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,041
We've hit a few bumps on
the road, but we've made it!

233
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:50,000
Now it's time to get on that
stage and sing your hearts out!

234
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,708
[HIKARI, SACCHY]
Let's do it.

235
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,166
[AKANE]
Aw man, the poor things must be

236
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,208
a bundle of nerves right now.

237
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,666
Okay, I gotta do what I
can to change the mood!

238
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,166
Let's get it rockin', you two!

239
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,833
When the curtain falls,
katsu bowls are on me!

240
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,291
[SACCHY]
That's too much food for me.

241
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,916
[HIKARI]
I'm more of a ramen girl.

242
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,416
Uh-- Eh-heh...

243
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,416
[SACCHY]
So, Laito's really a princess.

244
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,958
Has she been "playing idol"
as a campaign publicity stunt?

245
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,916
Maybe she only got this
far because her family

246
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,458
was pulling some strings
in the background.

247
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,875
But I've seen her work so hard.

248
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,125
[SACCHY]
At least she's not really

249
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,666
going to retire after this.

250
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,208
We can still perform
together and--

251
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:29,541
[gasps]

252
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,875
[SACCHY] What am I even
thinking? Focus, Sachiko!

253
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:37,500
[SACCHY] Gotta make it right.
Or you'll regret it at the show.

254
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,041
Five minutes. You okay?

255
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:43,916
[HIKARI]
Yup!

256
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:47,625
You'll never catch an idol
without her smile on!

257
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,833
I'm gonna go out there
and rock this thing!

258
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:50,750
[SACCHY gasps]

259
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,291
[AKANE giggles]
Yeah, you will!

260
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,208
[HIKARI]
Time to make it happen!

261
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:59,375
[AUDIENCE cheering]

262
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,750
[HIKARI]
I have to tell her the truth.

263
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:06,041
Just say the words, be brave
or you'll regret it.

264
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,583
Hey, Sacchy.

265
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,833
There's something
I need to tell you.

266
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,000
We're at places.

267
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,375
Can you wait till
after the show?

268
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:14,208
I can't.

269
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:15,208
Well, you may have to.

270
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,916
If I don't tell you this now,

271
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,541
I won't be able to
perform at my best.

272
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:22,166
I've been keeping
a secret from you.

273
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,833
I wasn't sure if I should
say, but we're a team,

274
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,875
so it's only fair that you know.

275
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,041
I don't want to lie, Sacchy.
I've done enough of that.

276
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:34,041
My real name is Hikari
Sakurada. The royal princess.

277
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:38,416
I know. Why did you
hide it until now?

278
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,916
Because I was scared.

279
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,083
I was worried you wouldn't
take me seriously anymore

280
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:45,083
if you knew I was royalty.

281
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,833
But being an idol
means everything to me

282
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,291
and I'm willing to
work crazy hard

283
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,708
so I can get as good as you!

284
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,041
Ow, that hurt!

285
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:54,083
Stop! Now I got something
to tell you, Princess!

286
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,916
I can tell when my friend
is giving it her all!

287
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,333
Do you think I care what
family you come from?

288
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:00,958
They aren't the ones
who spent endless hours

289
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,583
rehearsing with me.
You may be "Hikari"

290
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,708
whenever you're at home,
but you'll always

291
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:08,083
be Laito to me, got it?

292
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,791
[SACCHY]
Now, let's get out there.

293
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,666
[SACCHY]
This is our moment to shine.

294
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,666
[HIKARI]
Yeah!

295
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,416
[AKANE] We were born
and raised as royalty.

296
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,750
And I'd always thought that
meant staying inside the lines,

297
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,333
and thinking twice
before I acted.

298
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,958
Life wasn't about
what I wanted to do,

299
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,041
but what I was supposed to do.

300
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,666
[AKANE] But when my little
sister's on that stage,

301
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,583
I barely recognize her.

302
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:40,250
That silly, irresponsible
girl has suddenly grown up

303
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:44,208
before my eyes. She's doing
something that matters to her!

304
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:47,166
She found a song, and she's
gonna sing her heart out.

305
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,208
And never worry if
it's appropriate or not

306
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:52,791
for a princess. I've
never been more proud.

307
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,833
And I'll admit,
maybe a little jealous.

308
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,375
[KANADE]
It was great to meet you two.

309
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,208
And you as well,
Princess, thank you.

310
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:14,125
Nice meeting you. I hope
you win the election!

311
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:16,500
[KANADE]
Aw, thanks! Have a good day!

312
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:17,791
[KANADE]
And that's how you win 'em over

313
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,750
on the campaign trail!

314
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:28,541
[KANADE] I've got a long
list, where do I start?

315
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,208
Vegetables are probably
the way to go,

316
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,750
even if I have to
lug them around,

317
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,083
then the meat won't spoil.

318
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,625
Okay then.

319
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,666
Tomorrow looks like it's gonna
be a big day of campaigning.

320
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,916
Two important speeches
before noon.

321
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,708
Close the day with
handshakes and a talk show.

322
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,625
I'm not that crazy about
doing a talk show.

323
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,791
If you're gonna do this,
you'll do it right.

324
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,166
Do you wanna win
the crown or not?

325
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,083
[SHU]
Okay, okay.

326
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,000
But what I need right now
is for you to go over

327
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,666
the speech I wrote you
and make sure it's okay.

328
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,541
I'm so lucky to have you.

329
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,125
[BUTCHER 10A] Very sorry
to keep you waiting, Miss.

330
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:57,916
[gasps]

331
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,666
What can I get for ya?

332
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,250
Uh, I'm looking for
Chuck Eye Roll

333
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,375
if you have it in the shop.

334
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:03,291
[BUTCHER 10A]
Coming right up.

335
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,125
[sighs]

336
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:05,458
[GIRL 10B]
Hey, Mommy?

337
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,291
Can we go to the park
when we're done shopping?

338
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:08,708
Pretty please?

339
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,125
Sorry, sweetheart, but Mommy's
gotta get dinner ready.

340
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,375
We promised to help
set the table, remember?

341
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,625
You wouldn't wanna eat
without a napkin, would ya?

342
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,291
[GIRL 10B]
But I'm not ready to go home.

343
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,750
I wanna play some more!

344
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,208
[BOY 10A]
Twist my arm, why dontcha?

345
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,500
Tell you what, when we get
home, I'll read you a book.

346
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,250
[GIRL 10B]
You mean it?

347
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,541
[KANADE gasps]

348
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:30,666
[KANADE]
But, what happened?

349
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:34,000
No!

350
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:38,416
[DOCTOR 10A] Both children have
come through the worst now.

351
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,291
I suspect that Princess Akane
is going to experience

352
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:45,166
some memory loss, but she's
physically unharmed.

353
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,375
[SOICHIRO]
Thank goodness.

354
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,291
[DOCTOR 10A]
As for Prince Shu, however,

355
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,125
his injuries were more severe.

356
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,458
I doubt it'll affect his
day-to-day activities,

357
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:55,750
but his leg's motor functions
will never be the same.

358
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,583
I am sorry, my liege.

359
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,666
Modern medicine can
do no more than this.

360
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,125
[SOICHIRO] All of my children
are alive and safe.

361
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,416
A father can't ask
for anything else.

362
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,041
[DOCTOR 10A] There's one thing
to note about Princess Kanade.

363
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,708
Her creations are
limited only by money.

364
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:12,166
If she has the funds,
she can materialize

365
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,125
almost anything she wants.

366
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,500
Although...

367
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,375
It appears that if she tries
to conjure up something

368
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:20,166
outside her means, like
she did at the park,

369
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,958
then her other creations will
be consumed as collateral.

370
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:25,250
[SOICHIRO]
I don't understand.

371
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,166
[DOCTOR 10A] Well, in this
instance, when she tried to make

372
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:31,208
the staircase, the castle's
foundation was appropriated.

373
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,666
[sobs]

374
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,791
[KANADE] That fateful day,
Shu lost something precious.

375
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,166
And in the end, so did I.

376
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,958
[KANADE] My brother's dream
of playing soccer was gone.

377
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,958
But maybe I can bring it back.

378
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:52,125
If I win this election,
I just might.

379
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,333
[BUTCHER 10A] Is there anything
else I can get for ya?

380
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:55,333
Prince Shu!

381
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,208
How about a few
of those sausages?

382
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:58,458
[BUTCHER 10A]
Right away!

383
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,125
[SHU] I can tell there's
something on your mind.

384
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,583
What, I can't just
stand here and think?

385
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,833
Weren't you spending
the day with Sato?

386
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:07,458
I didn't want her to
have to walk in the rain.

387
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,291
So I just teleported her home.

388
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,291
Geez, you're dumb.

389
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:11,166
What?

390
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,875
Rainy days're romantic, moron!

391
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,000
It's the perfect weather
to walk a girl home!

392
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,875
Wait, that's how it works?

393
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,500
[sighs] Man, you're hopeless.

394
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,166
You want me to carry that stuff?

395
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,416
I could just teleport
us back home, you know.

396
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,958
Yeah, but I don't mind walking.

397
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,000
It gives me the chance
to connect with citizens

398
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,541
and do a little campaigning.

399
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,000
You are all about the votes.

400
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,833
You got a problem with that?

401
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,166
Hey, Kanade?

402
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,416
Yeah?

403
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,958
I really hope you're not
trying to become king

404
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:40,583
just so you can use the national
budget in some crazy attempt

405
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:44,833
to fix my legs, or anything
like that nonsense.

406
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,166
If you'd like to
know my opinion,

407
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,375
I'd rather you not
do that, actually.

408
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,041
Why's it matter?

409
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,458
Because I care about you.

410
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:52,833
I'd never want you
to waste your life

411
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,666
on something silly like that.

412
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,333
And besides, I may not be
able to sprint anymore,

413
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:59,583
but teleporting is
much more fun, anyway.

414
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:01,541
And, I'm not really
the bragging type,

415
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,000
but I'm doing pretty
great life-wise,

416
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,250
if you catch my drift.

417
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,875
I catch it just fine, thanks.

418
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:08,416
Whenever you talk about
Sato, you're smiling.

419
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,250
Huh?

420
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,333
Hint, hint, maybe you should

421
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,041
be with your girlfriend
instead of me.

422
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,333
But you're the one I'm
trying to get a smile outta.

423
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:15,708
Please, I smile plenty.

424
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:18,250
I dunno, that answer
didn't sound too upbeat.

425
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,583
Look, I'm your twin, I know what
you're thinking at all times.

426
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,583
Of course, how could I forget?

427
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:23,833
What, you doubt me?

428
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,875
Yeah, that's the word,
'cause I know I've got

429
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,875
no clue what's going on inside
that thick skull of yours!

430
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,666
I know you're thinking
about the accident.

431
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,666
And I want you to let it go!

432
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,416
[KANADE] Well, that's never
gonna happen, okay?

433
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,541
[gasps]

434
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,125
I'm sorry.

435
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,125
I didn't mean to yell like that.

436
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,791
I'm just frustrated
because I want

437
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,625
to make it up to you somehow.

438
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:45,958
Thing is,

439
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,583
I don't think I'll ever
really be able to do that

440
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:48,916
because I owe you so much.

441
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,625
That's not true.

442
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:53,458
But I'm gonna keep trying.
It's the least I can do.

443
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:56,375
C'mon, don't be ridiculous,
you don't owe me anything, sis.

444
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:57,708
I do!

445
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,833
Nuh-uh. That's not how
it works with your family.

446
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:00,750
[gasps]

447
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,291
As a matter of fact.

448
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,791
Even back when it happened,
I didn't hold it against you.

449
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,333
So leave the past in the past.

450
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:09,541
No way. I can't accept
that and just move on!

451
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,750
That's cool. You don't
have to accept it.

452
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,000
But I'm pretty sure that you do

453
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,416
have to listen to
your big brother.

454
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,416
[gasps] What the heck's
wrong with you?

455
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,166
You've never pulled
rank on me before.

456
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,958
Don't get all
"big brother" on me now.

457
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,416
C'mon, lil' sis.

458
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,375
I've been around the block
a few times, so I know best.

459
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:26,083
You're only older than me
by like 30 minutes, you jerk!

460
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,750
Thirty minutes or 30 seconds.

461
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,083
It still makes me
older than you.

462
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,666
I'm not gonna stand
here and listen to you

463
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,000
mock me like this!

464
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,416
Hey, calm down, you don't
wanna fight out here.

465
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,416
I mean, I'd hate for your
image to suffer in the polls

466
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,583
because of a sibling squabble.

467
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,666
Would you just shut up?

468
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,541
[panting]

469
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:46,583
[KANADE grunting]

470
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:48,291
Kana, come back!

471
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:53,000
[gasps]

472
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:04,375
[KANADE gasps]

473
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:05,500
[SHU]
Wow.

474
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:08,875
Got out right in the
nick of time, huh?

475
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,791
Are you all right, Kana?

476
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,541
[KANADE]
Yeah. I'm okay.

477
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,083
[SHU]
Good.

478
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:16,041
I don't know what I'd do if
anything ever happened to you.

479
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,125
[KANADE gasps]

480
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,958
I'm so happy that you're safe.

481
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,958
How can you be so reckless?

482
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:21,791
[SHU]
Hm?

483
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,291
You put yourself in danger.

484
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:25,625
What would you do if these
stupid risks got you hurt again?

485
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,875
And why in the world
are you always like this?

486
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,250
Even after everything
you've been through,

487
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,791
you still act like a hero!

488
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:31,958
Aw, c'mon.

489
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,208
[gasps]

490
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:34,875
Any brother worth his
salt would rather die

491
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,833
than let something happen
to his little sister.

492
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,541
Don't count on me
stopping anytime soon.

493
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:42,291
It's not fair for you to be
responsible for everyone!

494
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,958
Oh, yeah, totally unfair.
You got a problem with that?

495
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,458
[gasps]

496
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,833
No matter what happens to me,
I will always protect you.

497
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,916
And I know you're gonna
hate it when I do.

498
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,500
But there's no chance I'll
stop riding to your rescue.

499
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,750
That's the sort of thing
big brothers do.

500
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,041
That said.

501
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,666
How about you quit
fighting it and just let me

502
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,291
protect you when need be?

503
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:04,166
Brothers and sisters don't
"owe" each other anything.

504
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,291
If I wanna spoil you
rotten, then let me.

505
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:09,875
Because there's nothing
I love more in the world.

506
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,416
Shu...

507
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:25,125
[KANADE sobbing]

508
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:29,458
[KANADE]
Okay, I'm not crying anymore.

509
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:30,750
You can put me down!

510
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,583
C'mon, this is
getting embarrassing.

511
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,875
What, you think you're too
old for a piggyback ride?

512
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,333
Yeah.

513
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:37,583
Here's the thing.

514
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,375
I know I could teleport
you home, but I chose

515
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:40,791
to give you a
piggyback ride because

516
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,166
I wanted to prove a point.

517
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,000
[gasps] Yeah, yeah, I get it,

518
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,583
you're like super
strong or whatever.

519
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,500
The point is, I don't
have to carry you.

520
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,833
I'm doing it 'cause I want to.

521
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:53,375
Don't try to become
king for my sake,

522
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:57,375
'cause that's not the right
reason. You understand?

523
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:59,625
I, Kanade Sakurada,
hereby promise

524
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,250
I won't win the crown for you.

525
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:01,916
Great!

526
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,125
That would be wrong.

527
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,958
I'm gonna win it
because I want to!

528
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,041
And then I'll rule this
land as a terrifying

529
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:10,250
tyrant and be feared
as the overlord!

530
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,541
I will conquer this realm
with an iron fist!

531
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:13,166
What?

532
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,333
Believe me.

533
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,916
I'm gonna sit on
the throne someday!

534
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:49,583
[HARUKA] Hello, I'm
Haruka, the second son.

535
00:23:49,666 --> 00:23:51,833
[SATSUKI] Haru's a kind boy
who works tirelessly

536
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:53,916
behind the curtain to
keep his family happy.

537
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,291
I know he loves us very much.

538
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:56,541
[HARUKA]
True.

539
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:57,875
I'd rather be at home
than hunting for votes.

540
00:23:57,958 --> 00:23:59,916
[SATSUKI] If he is elected
your king, this country

541
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,625
will become full of polite,
considerate citizens,

542
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:03,708
just like him.

543
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:05,291
Tell them your
campaign slogan, honey.

544
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:07,416
[HARUKA] I don't really have
one, but I do have a ruler

545
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,625
I look up to! He wasn't a king,
but Prime Minister Gajah Mada

546
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:12,916
of the Majapahit
Empire's my favorite.

547
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,291
Please make sure
to get out and vote

548
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:16,750
for whomever you think
is best for the job!
