1
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:18,708
[AKANE] What's happening?
Why can't I breathe?

2
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:23,916
It almost feels as if...
something's sitting on my chest.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,208
[BORSCHT] Wake up and feed me,
little girl. I'm starving.

4
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:32,583
[AKANE]
C'mon, Borscht.

5
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:35,833
Why am I the one you're
always picking on?

6
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:37,083
What's your problem?

7
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:39,083
There's still food left
over from last night.

8
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:42,500
You need to just eat this.
And quit bugging me.

9
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:48,666
I get it. You're
so dramatic, cat.

10
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:57,250
You'd rather eat a plastic
bag than eat your food?

11
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,166
Hey, Shiori.

12
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,541
Can you ask the cat why he
likes chewing on plastic bags,

13
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:05,208
but then turns his nose up at
the kitty kibble I feed him?

14
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:06,333
[SHIORI]
Mh-hm.

15
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:11,416
[SHIORI] It was nice of your
family to take in a stray cat

16
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,083
like me and give
me a proper home.

17
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:16,666
But here's the deal. The
sub-par cat food being served

18
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,000
under this roof has truly
been a disappointment.

19
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:21,416
I expected so much more
from the royal family.

20
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,375
I've found better
meals in dumpsters.

21
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,875
[BORSCHT, SHIORI]
So what I'm trying to say

22
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:26,666
is that I'd rather
eat a plastic bag

23
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,750
than the processed
pellets I'm being fed.

24
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:30,375
The plastic actually
tastes better

25
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:33,083
than whatever so called
"meat" is in your tasteless--

26
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:34,541
You can stop, Shiori.

27
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:36,250
I get the message.

28
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:20,750
[KAREN]
My name is Karen Ayugase.

29
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,708
Akane and I have been best
friends since we were little.

30
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:27,708
So, of course, she's
my favorite Sakurada.

31
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:28,791
Good morning!

32
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,375
Right back at ya, Akane.

33
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,500
We were worried you weren't
gonna make it today.

34
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:35,125
Yeah, me too. I had to fly here.

35
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:36,375
[FUKUSHINA yelps]

36
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:37,958
I don't get why you're
always freaking out

37
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,541
about getting here on time.

38
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:42,333
It's no big deal to be tardy
to class every once in a while.

39
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:43,875
Yeah. I know,

40
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:46,375
but I'm hoping to win a perfect
attendance award this year.

41
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:49,583
An award's not that
important when you have to...

42
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:04,458
[KAREN]
Oh, no!

43
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:05,750
Akane's not...

44
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,666
[STUDENTS]
Wearing her skirt!

45
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,375
[KAREN] There's no doubt
that the whole class noticed

46
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,208
Akane's skirt was missing,

47
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,916
but she went about her day
as if nothing was wrong.

48
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,500
So everyone kept quiet about
the elephant in the room.

49
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,375
Nobody had the
guts to bring it up.

50
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,041
So we all just went
along with it,

51
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,750
as if none of us noticed the
half-dressed princess either.

52
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:25,958
Even I didn't say anything to
her. Which is weird, right?

53
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,583
I guess since our class
seems to have made

54
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:31,083
some mental pact not to
mention it, I go with the flow.

55
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,333
If everybody keeps quiet, then
we can get through the day

56
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:34,416
without incident.

57
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,291
After all, ignorance is bliss.

58
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,583
But this is too weird to ignore!

59
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:43,125
Can I get away with quietly
asking her about the skirt?

60
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,833
Course not! This is
Akane we're talking about.

61
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,041
She would die of embarrassment

62
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,708
if she really forgot
to wear her skirt.

63
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:53,000
[AKANE] I'm too embarrassed
to live! Ah! I've died.

64
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,875
[KAREN] She has to have
noticed a breeze going on

65
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,333
down there by now.

66
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,041
Is it possible that she came
to school without a skirt

67
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,250
on purpose?

68
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,000
Like maybe she's trying
to make a statement

69
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,750
or start a "no pants"
fashion trend.

70
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,166
How do I approach this?

71
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,708
If she thinks I'm making
fun of her clothes,

72
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,125
she'll be so hurt
that she could die!

73
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,250
Hey, girl.

74
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,416
Where on earth did
your skirt run off to?

75
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,000
[screaming]

76
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,125
[KAREN] I can't have my
best friend dying on me!

77
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:20,750
I am so confused.
What am I supposed to do?

78
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,250
You okay, Karen?

79
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,458
You've been acting kinda
weird all day long.

80
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:27,583
[KAREN] How can she stand
there like nothing's wrong?

81
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,541
Calm down. It's all
right. I'm okay.

82
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,250
I'll just assume that
nobody has the guts

83
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:35,625
to say anything about the skirt
to Akane, and that's that.

84
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,166
Akane, quick question for ya,

85
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,833
would you rather wear a skirt,
shorts, or a pair of pants?

86
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:42,791
It doesn't really matter to
me as long as they're cute.

87
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,875
C'mon, that's not true. You
have to have a preference.

88
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,333
Okay.

89
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:48,916
If I have to choose,

90
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,041
I guess I would take
a skirt over the others.

91

Oh, so you must be into
micro-minis then, huh?

93
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:59,666
I guess so. Wait, why?

94
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,291
[KAREN]
How are they only now noticing?

00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:04,458
[STUDENT B]
Am I crazy,

96
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,791
or is Akane Sakurada
not wearing a skirt?

97
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,083
No, you're not.

98
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,125
Are you sure?

99
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:09,750
[STUDENT B]
Huh?

101
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:13,500
Be quiet! Do you want
people to hear you?

102
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,125
Sorry. Just slipped.

103
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,791
Are you guys 100% certain that
Akane's not wearing a skirt?

104
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,416
Uh. I'm not sure.

105
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,208
I guess she could be
wearing a mini skirt

106
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:23,666
that's hidden under her sweater.

107
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,708
We didn't want to get caught
staring at her, y'know?

108
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:29,166
Well, then, there's no
way for you to know

109
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,875
what's going on underneath
her shirt, now is there?

110
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,625
Nope. You have no idea.

111
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,041
Have you guys even
stopped to think

112
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,625
that if Akane forgot her skirt,

113
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,708
she might've forgotten to wear
what goes underneath it, too?

Hey, Kanade.

Rumors about what?

117
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,250
That your little sister
Akane's walking around

118

without a skirt on today.

119
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,000
There's no way.

120
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,583
I could see her
forgetting to wear it,

but someone would've
told her by now.

You aren't worried
about her at all?

No, not in the slightest.

Even if something were going on,

125
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,250
Akane is old enough
to handle it herself.

Okay then.

127

I guess if you're sure

much stock into it--

What is she up to?

Using the PA system to call
me is kinda overkill.

157
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,875
[KAREN]
It's actually not your shyness

158
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,083
that I'm concerned about today.

159
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:16,250
[AKANE]
C'mon, let's head over.

160
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:19,625
[FUKUSHINA] This is it.
The perfect opportunity.

161
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,291
[STUDENT B]
The Akane Sakurada...

162
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,250
[STUDENT C] Is walking to
the student council room!

163
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,083
[FUKUSHINA] Everybody knows
the student council room

164
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,333
is on the third floor
of the south tower.

165
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:31,083
We are currently on the second
floor of the east tower.

166
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,791
She'll have to go upstairs
to meet her sister.

167
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,333
Which means...

168
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:42,958
[MALE STUDENTS] Sneak a peek.
Sneak a peek. Sneak--

169
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,875
I seriously can't
thank you enough

170
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,583
for always being
there for me, Karen.

171
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,416
That's what friends
are for, silly.

172
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,500
But, you're such a good friend I
could totally marry you one day.

173
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,458
Wonder if you're my type.

174
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:57,958
[MALE STUDENTS]
Sneak a peek.

175
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:06,416
Sneak a peek. Sneak a peek.

176
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,458
Maybe this isn't
a good idea, guys.

177
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:11,625
Uh, I mean, she's royalty
for crying out loud!

178
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:14,416
It's crude! Not to
mention disrespectful!

179
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,875
[STUDENT C]
Typical Fukushina.

180
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,583
Always trying to be Akane's
knight in shining armor.

181
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:19,583
[STUDENT B]
If you honestly think

182
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:20,958
its "wrong" and "disrespectful,"

183
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,708
then why are you marching
right along with us?

184
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:24,750
[KAREN]
Oh, no!

185
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,416
Those dudes have
definitely noticed.

186
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,125
Am I going crazy, or is that
horde of boys following us?

187
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,833
[KAREN] She's so oblivious.
And it's kinda adorable.

188
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,000
[KAREN]
Hurry up, Akane!

189
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,291
[MALE STUDENTS]
Sneak a peek.

190
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,000
[KAREN]
They're gaining on us!

191
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,791
I should've told her about
the skirt as soon as I noticed!

192
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,083
If she realizes it's missing
in front of this crowd,

193
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,000
she's gonna have a
serious break down!

194
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,500
And it'll be all my fault
for being a bad friend!

195
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,875
I need to find a way to ditch
these drooling hooligans

196
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:52,541
and gently tell her the truth
about what's happening.

197
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,750
[KAREN] Kanade!
I'm so glad we found you!

198
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,666
Dear, God! The rumors are true!

199
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,708
You're walking
around pantsless!

200
00:09:58,791 --> 00:09:59,708
No!

201
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,250
[AKANE]
What're you talking about?

202
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,875
Of course I'm wearing something.

203
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:03,625
What?

204
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:04,291
[MALE STUDENTS]
What?

205
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,166
[KANADE]
For real?

206
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,041
That's kinda hard to believe.

207
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:11,083
So, that's why everyone's
been staring at me.

208
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:14,416
Boys. They can be so ridiculous.

209
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,250
Coming to school, I ripped
my skirt on a branch

210
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:20,166
while hiding from the
surveillance cameras.

211
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:25,083
Luckily, I found a pair of gym
shorts in the bottom of my bag.

212
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,750
Well, it sounds like something
that would happen to you.

213
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,583
I was getting kinda worried.

214
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:32,541
I can't believe you thought
I'd come to school half naked.

215
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,750
Sorry, but it did look that way.

216
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:38,333
[AKANE] Here, I'll prove
it to you. Take a look!

217
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,166
[ALL gasp]

218
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,666
What... the...?

219
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,708
[KAREN]
No matter how you look at them,

220
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:05,833
they're definitely panties.

221
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:10,333
[AKANE screaming]

222
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,916
[OFFICER ] And now the student
council Vice President,

223
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,666
Kanade Sakurada, will be
making an announcement

224
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,000
in the president's absence.

225
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,458
[STUDENT H] Seriously?
The president's out again?

226
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,041
[STUDENT E] I've been in
the council a long time

227
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,666
and I've never even
seen the president.

228
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,083
[STUDENT F] Me either!
I have no clue who it is.

229
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,375
[STUDENT G] I heard a rumor
that it's a freshman.

230
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:38,625
[STUDENT J]
Everyone knows they can't become

231
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,000
student council officers.

232
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:40,833
[STUDENT I]
Oh, really?

233
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,250
[STUDENT K]
Yes, really.

234
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,791
I've heard the prez is short

235
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,291
and that's why everyone
thinks they're a freshman.

236
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:50,333
First, I've got an
exciting announcement.

237
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:53,041
Next weekend, our school
will be participating

238
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,375
in the first Community
Clean Up Day.

239
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,000
[AKANE]
"Community Clean Up Day"?

240
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,541
[KANADE]
With a little elbow grease,

241
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:01,208
we can help our city become
an even more beautiful place

242
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,375
to live.

243
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,750
I look forward to seeing
all of you there.

244
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,083
[AKANE]
Cleaning up the community?

245
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,250
That sounds like torture.

246
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,500
Do you want me to ask Kanade

247
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,333
if the freshman class
can just be in charge

248
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,166
of the beautification
of our school grounds?

249
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,458
No, I shouldn't ask her
for special treatment.

250
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,708
Cleaning up the city'll
make the residents happy

251
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:22,166
and as a member of the royal
family, I should take part.

252
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,291
[FUKUSHINA]
Huh?

253
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,708
But I'm nervous.

254
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:27,708
There's gonna be people
helping us that I don't know.

255
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,083
[FUKUSHINA]
This is probably gonna be tough

256
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,333
for Akane since strangers
make her skittish,

257
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,000
but it's gonna be great for me!

258
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,958
She's so cute when
she gets embarrassed.

259
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:37,500
I'd die a happy man if I could
stare at that flustered face

260
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:38,666
for the rest of my life.

261
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,375
[TAKEDA]
President!

262
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:40,708
[FUKUSHINA]
Hm?

263
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,375
We really need to discuss
this morning's meeting.

264
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,583
[FUKUSHINA]
Are you sure that's something

265
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:46,375
you need to discuss
with me, Takeda?

266
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,833
Hi, Miss Sakurada!

267
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:51,208
Hi! How's your day
going so far, Takeda?

268
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:52,708
Sorry, but I've gotta run.

269
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,500
Apparently the seniors need
me for some unknown reason.

270
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:56,750
Do you mind taking these for me?

271
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,333
Sure. Of course.

272
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:01,083
[FUKUSHINA] All right, now let's
go see what's so important.

273
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,333
[AKANE] Why would a senior
need to talk to Fukushina

274
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,125
about the student
council meeting?

275
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,291
And why did he call
him "president"?

276
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,791
What in the world
is going on with him?

277
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,666
[FUKUSHINA] How many times
do I have to tell you

278
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,666
not to call me
"president" at school?

279
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,250
[TAKEDA]
I'm sorry, sir.

280
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,250
I promise it won't happen again.

281
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,666
[FUKUSHINA]
Please see that it doesn't.

282
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,541
You're right though,
Akane is stressed out

283
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,500
about the upcoming
community clean up.

284
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:27,916
We need to devise a plan to
get her out of participating.

285
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,916
What genius came up
with this dumb project?

286
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,833
[FUKUSHINA]
I'm sure it was Kanade.

287
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,916
She seems to run
the council nowadays.

288
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,208
[MEMBER A]
I know!

289
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,958
Let's gather some students
and start a protest!

290
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,291
[FUKUSHINA]
Bad idea.

291
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,708
It would draw even more
unwanted attention to us.

292
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:43,166
[MEMBER B]
Then what are we going to do?

293
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,583
Don't worry, gents.

294
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,750
Fukushina is on the case.

295
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,208
[STUDENT L]
Hey, Kanade!

296
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,666
There's a freshman
asking for you!

297
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,833
'Kay.

298
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,208
[STUDENT D]
Oh, is that a new boyfriend?

299
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,875
Yeah, right, like I would
date an underclassman.

300
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:00,416
Hey, check it out. Some kid's
hittin' on your sister.

301
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,666
The president?

302
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,833
[YAMAMOTO]
Huh?

303
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,916
Nothing. Just thinkin'.
Everything's cool.

304
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,166
If you say so.

305
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,083
Hey, you know the
community clean up thing

306
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:13,958
happening this weekend?

307
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,458
It's really lame.
Ask Kana to call it off.

308
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:17,083
Sure.

309
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:18,583
Wow, really?

310
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,166
[SHU] There's only
one reason the president

311
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,583
would need to talk to Kanade.

312
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,666
Something's up with Akane.

313
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,750
So, what is it you
want this time?

314
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,208
As you might've suspected,

315
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,458
I've got issues with this
"community clean up."

316
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:32,291
Of course you do, and you think
Akane'll feel more comfortable

317
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,125
if she sticks to cleaning
the school grounds.

318
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,041
Correct.

319
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,333
Not gonna happen.

320
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:37,875
[FUKUSHINA]
Uh.

321
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,791
[KANADE] I won't take pity on
her. She owes me 40 million.

322
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,041
[FUKUSHINA]
Uh?

323
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,041
You're looking at this
the wrong way though.

324
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,541
Akane's gonna have to work with
strangers during the clean up

325
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,250
and that's gonna make
her super nervous.

326
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,500
That's precisely what I've
been trying to tell you!

327
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,833
You like it when she gets
all flustered, don'tcha?

328
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:54,333
You think it's cute.

329
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,166
[FUKUSHINA]
She's got my number all right.

330
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,375
Embarrassed Akane
is my favorite.

331
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:01,208
Nothing could beat a whole
day of watching her blush.

332
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,375
[KANADE]
Well, that was easy.

333
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,583
[AKANE] I wonder what
Fukushina is up to.

334
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:15,083
Oh, I spot a cute little
red-headed princess.

335
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:16,625
[AKANE yelps]

336
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:21,583
Hey, Sakurada's sister's here!

337
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,041
Hello, Akane!

338
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:25,916
Hi, Sato!

339
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,125
What'd I miss? Oh, hi, Princess.

340
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,041
Did ya want me to
grab your brother?

341
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:33,291
Or maybe your sister?

342
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,833
Well, uh.

343
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:37,708
[HITOMI] Ha. I doubt she wants
to talk to Shu. Nobody does.

344
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,250
What? Why would you say that?

345
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:42,666
She's clearly joking. C'mon,
let's hang out with Akane!

346
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:46,833
[SHU]
Hey, Kanade.

347
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:47,916
[KANADE]
Hm?

348
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,958
Whoa, what's with
the furrowed brow?

349
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:51,916
What were you and the
president talking about?

350
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,958
The usual, Akane's
hand in marriage.

351
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,208
That dweeb has some nerve

352
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:56,875
if he thinks I'd ever
allow that to happen!

353
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,500
You can't just marry
a Sakurada on a whim!

354
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,958
We're royalty,
for crying out loud!

355
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,208
Relax, I'm kidding.

356
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:02,583
We were talking
about the cleanup.

357
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,125
Oh, good. I was worried
it was something important.

358
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,083
You're a jerk!

359
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,416
So?

360
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,125
Did you get a chance to
clear the air with Kanade?

361
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:09,166
[SHU]
Huh?

362
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,000
Oh yeah, I just had
a chat with her.

363
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,250
[SHU]
About Akane's fan boy.

364
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,375
Awesome! I knew you'd
change her mind!

365
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:18,041
[YAMAMOTO] Kanade's not
stealing my weekend. No way!

366
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:21,291
Uzuki, are you feeling
okay? Need anything?

367
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:25,125
Nah, I'll be fine, but
thanks for the tissue.

368
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:29,000
[SHIZURU] Hey, Aoi, there's
a freshman here asking for ya.

369
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,583
As much as I would love to see

370
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:33,583
Akane get all cute and flustered
during the cleanup, I'm torn.

371
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:36,625
As president, I feel like it's
my obligation to protect her.

372
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,625
I don't want to act
like a selfish leader.

373
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,416
Um, you know what I'm saying?

374
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,000
[AOI]
Uh.

375
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,916
[AOI] Is he asking me to make
some sort of a decision for him?

376
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:50,041
Well, honestly, it's not your
place to make that decision.

377
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:53,333
It's up to Akane,
so let her decide.

378
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:56,583
And I happen to know that Akane
plans on giving it her all,

379
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,625
despite the fact that
she's feeling nervous.

380
00:16:58,708 --> 00:16:59,791
If you're a good friend,

381
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,125
you'll let her work
through her anxiety.

382
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,750
Besides, you and I both know,

383
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,708
participating in this
will be good for her.

384
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:08,000
Yes. Of course you're right.
I'll stand by m'lady.

385
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,333
I'll only offer my
assistance if she needs it.

386
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,833
'Kay! I'll inform the club.

387
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,250
Thank you for all of your help.

388
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,291
I feel good about this
decision. I'll see you later.

389
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:20,291
[AOI] I guess I gave him
the answer he wanted to hear.

390
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:23,625
[NANAO]
Aoi, you sure are popular today.

391
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:24,458
[AOI gasps]

392
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,166
[AOI]
Akane?

393
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,416
What a surprise, you
never visit my class.

394
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,791
Is everything okay?

395
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:32,541
So, um, just curious,
aren't you like good friends

396
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,291
with the student
council president?

397
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:37,208
Of course I am. We've been
friends for a long time now.

398
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,416
So, the president
is a senior then?

399
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,708
Yes, definitely.

400
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,083
Is that all you wanted?

401
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:44,583
Well, no.

402
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:47,166
There's one more thing I need
from you. Please help me!

403
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,250
[UZUKI]
Huh?

404
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,166
Why do you keep
running away from us?

405
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,791
Yeah, you know we'll
always find you.

406
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,708
[FUKUSHINA] I've decided
that we will be participating

407
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:58,875
in the community clean up.

408
00:17:58,958 --> 00:17:59,833
[MEMBER B]
But I thought that we all agreed

409
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,041
it was a bad idea!

410
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:03,250
Do you not remember
our club's sole purpose?

411
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,708
We swore to respect,
honor, and cherish her.

412
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:08,583
To act in her well-being in
any and every circumstance,

413
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,500
regardless of the personal cost.

414
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:13,708
That's the goal of the
Princess Akane Fan Club!

415
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,041
You hear me?!

416
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,250
As secret admirers we
must follow those tenets,

417
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:18,583
it is our duty!

418
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,208
Hold up there, Mr. President,

419
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:21,791
I thought we were all
supposed to help make

420
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,625
our princess's life
more peaceful.

421
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,416
Not put her through this kinda
unnecessary embarrassment.

422
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,666
This project will
upset her, sir!

423
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,750
[FUKUSHINA]
Quiet, Takeda.

424
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,458
It's our responsibility
to support Akane

425
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,000
in all of her endeavors.

426
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,458
She wants to participate
in the community clean up,

427
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,458
so we'll be there
working alongside her.

428
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:38,791
[MEMBER C]
But, President,

429
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,166
she's gonna be surrounded
by hundreds of people

430
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,208
and they're all gonna be
staring at her all day long!

431
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:43,750
Yes, I know.

432
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,916
But she wants to do this to
overcome her crippling shyness.

433
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,958
As club members we must
offer her our support

434
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,791
during this challenging time.

435
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,250
This is madness. She's not
ready to face the public,

436
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,583
dontcha think she's
moving too fast?

437
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,083
Yea probably, but
we'll get the chance

438
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:57,083
to see her blush when she's
embarrassed and stuff.

439
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,250
[ALL]
Uh...

440
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,583
Oh, boy.

441
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:04,333
I never should've gone into
the seniors' classrooms.

442
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:07,541
I give up. I'm done
looking for Fukushina.

443
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:08,250
Uh?

444
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,458
How'd he end up here?

445
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:10,791
Hey, where've you been?

446
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,083
Thanks for dealing with
those books for me.

447
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,583
Oh! Sure!
It wasn't a big deal!

448
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:18,666
[AKANE] But why'd her run off
earlier? It can't hurt to ask.

449
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:22,791
About that, is everything okay
with your friend Takeda?

450
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:26,500
Yeah. Everything's fine.

451
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,416
[FUKUSHINA] I need to make
sure my camcorder is charged

452
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,791
and ready to capture
this weekend.

453
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,458
[UZUKI]
All right, everyone!

454
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,166
Let's show the community
how much we care

455
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,583
by making our town
squeaky clean!

456
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,416
[STUDENTS]
Okay!

457
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,625
[UZUKI]
Phew.

458
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,875
[KANADE]
Way to rally the troops!

459
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:46,458
Are you feeling okay
today, President Uzuki?

460
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:49,708
Yeah. I actually haven't
felt this good in a while.

461
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:51,583
I'm sorry that you've had
to fill in as president

462
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:52,750
so much lately.

463
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,833
No prob. It's my job, after all.

464
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,666
Hey, Shu, my so-called friend!

465
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,708
What happened to Kanade
cancelling this clean up?

466
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,041
You told me I wouldn't
have to do this...

467
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,083
What the heck is he
shouting about over there?

468
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:05,875
I think he's completely
lost it. Keep it down, man!

469
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:10,958
Um. Okay, class. Do your best
to pick up all of the trash.

470
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,333
Is everybody ready?!

471
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:13,875
[FRESHMAN]
Yeah!

472
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,958
Let's show 'em freshman
class is the best!

473
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,458
We'll have fun.

474
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,750
And we'll pick up more trash
than all the upperclassmen!

475
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,666
Remember, Akane's our class rep,

476
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:25,500
so our actions will reflect
upon her. Don't screw this up!

477
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:26,750
[FRESHMAN]
Yes, sir!

478
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,583
[AKANE] Who'd've thought
Fukushina cared so much

479
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,833
about this community clean up.

480
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:40,916
[AKANE] I'm so tired.
I could sleep forever.

481
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,875
[KANADE]
You're too young to be so tired.

482
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,583
You did this to me.

483
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:47,375
I'm emotionally drained from
being in the public eye all day.

484
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,375
It's exhausting.

485
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:55,083
Man, that cat doesn't sleep
on anybody, but you, Akane,

486
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,458
how did you win him over?

487
00:20:56,541 --> 00:21:00,250
He likes me 'cause I always
get up to feed him, duh.

488
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,583
[BORSCHT]
Firm, but not too firm.

489
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:06,125
Her smell and body temperature
are most pleasing to me.

490
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:09,458
Reminds me of my former
living conditions.

491
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:11,625
[SHIORI]
I can't tell her that.

492
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,458
I'm pretty sure the only
reason he likes you

493
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:14,291
is 'cause your flat.

494
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:15,833
[AKANE]
Uh!

495
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:17,583
Well, if that's all he's looking
for then he should come over

496
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:18,916
and give me a try.

497
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,250
Come on over here, Borscht-y.

498
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,916
And dissed.

499
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,916
Pretty sad when you're little
sister is working with more

500
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,625
than you are.

501
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:36,916
[AKANE yelps]

502
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,708
Hey, wait a second, when
did these two bumps grow in?

503
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:43,333
No! This isn't fair,
I'm older than you!

504
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:45,583
They're definitely bigger
than mine, but how?

505
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,000
Would you please stop?

506
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:48,541
Dinner's ready, kiddos.

507
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,833
Hope you like borscht 'cause
that's what we're having.

508
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:51,750
[BORSCHT]
Uh!

509
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:53,208
I knew they were
up to something!

510
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:54,958
They've been fattening
me up for weeks.

511
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:57,666
Just waiting to take a
bite out of my juicy flesh.

512
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,083
But I won't go down that easy.

513
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:02,041
They'll have to catch
me first, and I'm fast!

514
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:05,041
[SHIORI] Borscht!
We're having soup! Not cat!

515
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:06,333
[AOI]
And here's your borscht soup.

516
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:08,208
[AKANE]
Oh, wow, it looks yummy!

517
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:10,333
Uh!

518
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:12,958
Don't worry, everybody,
the cat is back.

519
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,916
He simply couldn't
resist the smell.

520
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:50,416
[SHIORI] I'm Shior Sakurada,
the sixth daughter.

521
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,083
[SATSUKI]
Shiori is my youngest child

522
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:53,916
but is very wise for her age.

523
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,375
She's a responsible young lady

524
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:57,166
and is always
looking out for Teru.

525
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,750
[SHIORI]
Trouble follows him.

526
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:00,750
[SATSUKI] I have no doubt that
Shiori would be a good leader

527
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:02,875
if she won the election
and became king.

528
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:05,125
The citizens would
absolutely love her.

529
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:06,625
What's your campaign
promise, sweetie?

530
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:08,958
[SHIORI] Um, I don't really
have a promise or anything.

531
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:11,291
I just hope that Teru
gets lots of votes.

532
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:12,708
And I kinda have a secret:

533
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:15,208
The king I like the most
isn't really a king at all.

534
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:16,666
It's Snow White!
