Are you okay, citizen?

Whenever calamity strikes,
just call my name!

00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,916
In the royal garden of
Castle Town, I bloomed.

you all for coming.

My name is Akane Sakurada, and I
want to become the next king

00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:42,166
of our great country,
so that I can protect

19
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,208
the peace of every citizen.

Good!

Did I already say that
my name is Akane Sakurada?

23
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:53,541
So, um, if I am elected king,
I promise to carry out

24
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,083
the following three points.

This is great, Akane!

Media coverage is
a good thing, right?

00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,208
Yeah, but--

Go on!

30
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:06,875
First, I will ban the use
of surveillance cameras.

31
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:09,916
They've been a plague on
our privacy for too long.

32

You can do it! Just trust me.

36
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,041
So that is my solemn
promise to each of you

it if you'd vote for me.

00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,791
[AOI] I'm glad Akane finally
worked up the nerve

43
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,333
to go out and campaign.

44
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,125
But she's so frazzled
in front of the crowd

45
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,958
that she can barely
talk, and she never

46
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,875
makes eye contact with them.

47
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,791
She's fifth in the
opinion polls this week,

48
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:50,708
so the public speaking isn't
really helping her cause.

49
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,583
There must be something
else we can try.

the peace of the people from

No one knows her true identity.

55
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:08,208
For she is really Hanae, the
clumsiest girl in her class!

56

They must be dumb. It's
totally obvious it's her.

Please don't say that!

58

If anyone finds out it's her,
she'll turn into a rabbit

and the show will end!

But wouldn't they be
grateful if they knew?

make Akane a superhero?

[AOI]
Yes.

66
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,666
If she hides her identity,
she can protect people

67
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,666
without her shyness
getting in the way.

68

After a while, she could
reveal herself to the public

and her popularity will
shoot through the roof.

And I'm not just talking
about the election.

Her social anxiety could
cause major hardships for her

If she can learn to be
assertive in front of others,

get over her shyness.

They'll only work if Akane

00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,375
you live to Prince
Shu's campaign rally.

316
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,708
[SATO]
Uh, hello all. Welcome!

317
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:59,416
Isn't this lovely
weather we're having?

318
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,083
It's the perfect evening
for a speech or two!

319
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,750
Hana. Try to relax.

320
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:06,625
Sorry! Uh. I'm done now.

321
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:09,375
[AKANE] Poor Hana. I heard
she's managing all of Shu's

322
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,583
campaign speeches lately.

323
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,958
[HARUKA sighs] I need to
find a way to make this one

324
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,291
stand out from the others.

325
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:18,458
[MISAKI]
I'm home.

326
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:19,541
'Bout time.

327
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,875
I could use your
help. Hear me out.

328
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:23,958
For the next speech,
I'd like to shift focus

329
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:27,333
to promoting your
clones and their, uh--

330
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,791
Hey. What's wrong?

331
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:32,208
I was thinking about
Shu and Akane.

332
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:34,625
They're both working so hard.

333
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:35,958
Yeah. You're right.

334
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,250
That's exactly why we
can't afford to slack off.

335
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:39,541
[MISAKI]
I dunno.

336
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:42,250
I'm not sure I deserve
to become king.

337
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,250
[HARUKA]
What are you talking about?

338
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:47,208
[MISAKI] To be honest, the only
reason that I wanna win,

339
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,833
is not necessarily
because I wanna rule.

340
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:52,333
I just thought it'd make
you appreciate me more.

341
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:54,041
I wanna be your favorite sister.

342
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,375
[gasps]

343
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:58,083
I mean, what kinda
king thinks like that?

344
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,041
You must be disappointed.

345
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,333
Why would you think that?

346
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:02,958
[MISAKI]
'Cause you support me.

347
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,166
Without you, I wouldn't
have any speeches to give

348
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,625
or any confidence
in my own abilities.

349
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,583
And yet, compared to
Akane and the others,

350
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,875
I might as well
be standing still.

351
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,458
They've come so far
and they did it

352
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:15,583
through their own efforts.

353
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,375
[HARUKA]
I'm not sure Akane did.

354
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:21,166
[MISAKI] Sorry, Haru, but I'm
just not fit to be the king.

355
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,666
[HARUKA]
You're the most fit to be king!

356
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,583
[MISAKI]
Huh?

357
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:24,833
[HARUKA]
You're a regular Joe.

358
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,958
That's why people feel
comfortable around you.

359
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,166
Let's see. How
should I put this?

360
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,000
Perspective. You see the
world through the same eyes

361
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,083
as every normal person
in this country.

362
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,666
[gasps]

363
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,416
[HARUKA] That's why you're the
best candidate for the throne.

364
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,583
That's what I think, anyway,
and it's why I support you.

365
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:44,250
But you would be a better
choice than I ever would.

366
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:47,041
[HARUKA] My talents are more
suited to an advisory role.

367
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,291
So that's what I've
decided to do.

368
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,000
Besides.

369
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,791
[gasps]

370
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:56,000
[HARUKA] You're no good
without me. Isn't that right?

371
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,791
Thanks, Haruka.

372
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,708
[MISAKI] He actually believes
that I could win this thing.

373
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,375
I don't wanna let him down.

374
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:06,250
So I'd better start
believing in me, too!

375
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:10,708
I may not be able to live up
to his ideal yet, but for now--

376
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:14,666
I will try. And I will win!

377
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,875
Good.

378
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,083
Then we should start
working on that speech--

379
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:20,625
[MISAKI] No. I'm writing
this one on my own.

380
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,166
It has to be me.

381
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,416
If they aren't my words,
then what's the point?

382
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,875
I can do it.

383
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,750
Yes, you can.

384
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,208
[REINDEER SUIT MAN 9A]
Merry Christmas!

385
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,625
Get your holiday cakes
before they're gone!

Gluten free available!

387

Time flies. Christmas
Eve is tomorrow night.

388
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,333
[AOI] I almost forgot.
My birthday's tomorrow.

389
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,041
The New Year will come and go
before we even realize it.

390
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:43,458
[MISAKI]
Hello, everyone.

391
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,875
I know you're super busy
shopping for the holidays,

392
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,791
but I could really
use your help.

393
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:50,125
I'm Misaki Sakurada,
and I would like to turn

394
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,208
our country into an
even brighter place

395
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,583
than it already is.

396
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:56,250
To be honest, I haven't
figured out how to do that.

397
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,708
Well, not yet.

398
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,958
But, with your help, I know
that we can work together

399
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:02,333
to achieve that goal.

400
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:03,666
That is my dream.

401
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,666
[NANAO] Whoa. Misaki's
all by herself today.

402
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,208
Yeah. She wanted to try
on her own this time.

403
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,541
[SHIZURU] Nice. She's not
even using her clones.

404
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,208
[UZUKI]
That's pretty cool.

405
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,000
[WOMAN 9A] Look! Princess Aoi
and her attendants!

406
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,625
[WOMAN 9B] She's probably
watching the rally.

407
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,375
[WOMAN 9C]
Or on business.

408
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,208
[WOMAN 9D]
We should stay out of her way.

409
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,208
Am I the only one with a
wicked case of déjà vu here?

410
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,583
It's not like it
happens every time.

411
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,416
Let's get going.

412
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,708
Right.

413
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,375
Sorry that happened.

414
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:33,708
[NANAO]
No big. We're used to it.

415
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:36,083
[UZUKI] Yeah! It doesn't
bother me at all!

416
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,625
[SHIZURU]
Nothing bothers you.

417
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:41,708
[AOI giggles] What should we
do now? You wanna go for tea?

418
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:42,916
I'm out.

419
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,916
My boss asked me to
cover a shift at work.

420
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,916
[AOI]
We can wait if it'll be quick.

421
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,416
Well,

422
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,583
I have to go to my club's
meeting afterwards, so, sorry!

423
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,750
Next time!

424
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,625
Bummer. She's so busy.

425
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,875
That girl is always
up to something.

426
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,000
What's new?

427
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,500
Her social circle's
gotten even bigger

428
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,250
since she started her job.

429
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,458
Oh, I see.

430
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,541
Well, I'm fine with just
the three of us hanging out

431
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,250
if you'd still
like to go get tea.

432
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,416
[SHIZURU]
I can't.

433
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,875
I have a couple of
errands I've gotta run.

434
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,250
[AOI] Is it anything
we could help with?

435
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,833
No, it's... uh...

436
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:17,708
Bye!

437
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:20,958
[AOI]
Uh... See ya later.

438
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,375
--Well, what about you?
--[yelps]

439
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:23,625
I'm sorry, Aoi.

440
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,375
Actually, I have to
deliver some medicine

441
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,416
to my sick aunt on
the other side of town.

442
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,458
I didn't know that
you had an aunt.

443
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,125
Uh! Maybe next time!

444
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,833
Okay. I'm sorry for
holding you up.

445
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:37,083
No. It's fine. Really! Later!

446
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,166
[AOI] I made the three of
them spend time with me

447
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,375
and never thought
about their lives.

448
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,333
It's always been the four of us.

449
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:51,083
I guess I just thought
that would never change.

450
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:54,416
But the truth is, if I
become king next year,

451
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,916
everything will be different.
Especially our social lives.

452
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,958
Being around me always seems
to cause trouble for them.

453
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,208
Maybe I shouldn't invite
them out as much.

454
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:07,125
I don't have the right to
monopolize their lives.

455
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:11,833
It's time I learned to
stand alone, like royalty.

456
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:14,000
Don't be sad! This is life!

457
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:16,125
You knew that you had
to grow up someday!

00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,958
[SHIZURU] My errands
were suddenly cancelled.

461

Yes!

[AOI] No worries. I really
wasn't doing anything.

[SHIZURU]
Well, I'm glad you came.

We rarely get any
one-on-one time together.

468
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,625
[AOI giggles] For real,
I'm looking forward to it.

469
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,375
[SHIZURU]
Mm... Could you give me a sec?

470
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:44,833
It's messy in here.

471
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,875
Oh, it won't bother me.
Remember, I have eight siblings.

472
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,291
[gasps]

473
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,833
Sorry, you probably have
personal items to clean up, huh?

474
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,333
What are you going on about now?

475
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:54,625
[AOI]
I can be ignorant sometimes.

476
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:57,375
I wasn't being sensitive.
Please, go ahead!

477
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,458
Okay.

478
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,000
[AOI]
I just realized.

479
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,583
It's been a long time since
I've been in Shizuru's room.

480
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:06,083
[cellphone vibrates]

481
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:09,083
[AOI]
Wow. That was fast.

482
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,291
I'm coming in.

483
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:14,000
[AOI gasps]
Why is it dark?

484
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,250
Hey. Where are you?

485
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:23,083
[ALL]
Surprise! Happy Birthday, Aoi!

486
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:25,541
[gasps]

487
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,041
[UZUKI]
Did you suspect us?

488
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,500
No. Not at all.

489
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,000
Good!

490
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,875
We thought you were on to us
after all our lame excuses.

491
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,291
We 've always wanted
to celebrate with you,

492
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:36,208
but that would intrude
on your family.

493
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:40,125
It might be a day early,
but, at least this way,

494
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,833
we get to celebrate it together.

495
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:42,875
--[AOI whimpers]
--[SHIZURU, UZUKI gasp]

496
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:43,666
Hey...

497
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,083
[UZUKI]
Aoi?

498
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:49,000
You guys. Thank you...

499
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,166
...so much.

500
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,041
Our pleasure.

501
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,500
Oh, and, you forgot
to take your shoes off.

502
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:56,208
Sorry!

503
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:57,708
Jeez. Shizu!

504
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,500
[SHIZURU] I'm starving.
This cake won't eat itself.

505
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:01,375
[NANAO]
Not yet, doofus!

506
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:02,541
She still needs to...

507
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,625
[AOI] Happiness is
different for everyone.

508
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:07,375
And it can take a
long time to find it.

509
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,416
But, as far as I'm concerned,

510
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,500
I don't have to look any
farther than right here.

511
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:15,333
I wish this feeling could
stay with me forever.

512
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:18,041
I'd give up everything
to make it happen.

513
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,666
Even the crown.

514
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,500
[SHIZURU, UZUKI, NANAO]
Happy birthday, Aoi!

515
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,833
[SHIZURU] Okay, she blew
them out. Can we eat now?

516
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,583
[UZUKI] No! The birthday girl
gets the first slice!

517
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,750
[NANAO]
Go ahead, Aoi. Pick one.

518
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,375
Uh... That one!

519
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,541
[NANAO] Darn it. I was
eyeing that strawberry.

520
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:37,375
[UZUKI]
You can have this piece, Nanao.

521
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:38,916
[AOI]
Then I'll take this one.

522
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,166
[SHIZURU]
Aw, that's mine!

523
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,958
--[UZUKI] Wow! Rude much?
--[AOI] For real.

524
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,291
[SHIZURU]
Rock, paper, scissors for it!

525
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:44,625
[NANAO]
No way!

526
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:49,041
[AKANE] All right.
Tomorrow is Christmas Eve.

527
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:52,583
So, we're throwing
Aoi a surprise party!

528
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:55,000
As you know, she has
always found out about it,

529
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:57,958
despite our best efforts.
That won't happen this year!

530
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:01,291
I need you to be extra diligent
in your duties, understood?

531
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,791
[SHIORI, TERU, HIKARI, MISAKI]
Roger!

532
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,916
[AKANE] I'll be counting on
your clones, in particular.

533
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,583
They're all yours, Akane!

534
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,166
[AKANE]
This is a top secret operation!

535
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,416
Anyone who spoils it will
pay the ultimate penalty!

536
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,916
We'll surprise her,
or die trying!

537
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,625
[SHIORI, TERU, HIKARI, MISAKI]
Yeah!

538
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:16,875
[AOI giggles]

539
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:51,000
[AKANE] I'm the rose of
justice, Scarlet Bloom!

540
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:52,583
[SATSUKI] When you were
younger, you used to play

541
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:55,166
superhero all the time,
but I always thought

542
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,125
you would grow out of it once
you got a little older.

543
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:59,625
[AKANE] It's fun to pretend
to be someone else for a while.

544
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:02,583
I feel like I can do things
I normally can't, you know?

545
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:05,541
Maybe I should start campaigning
for king as Scarlet Bloom!

546
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:06,916
[SATSUKI] But if you do,
she'll be the king,

547
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,333
and not my sweet Akane.

548
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:09,375
[AKANE]
Oh, good point.

549
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:10,833
Did you hear that, everyone?

550
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,250
Please do not write Scarlet
Bloom on your ballots!

551
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:14,666
If you do, they won't be valid!

552
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,708
And that would be
very bad for me!
