1
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:17,083
[MISAKI]
Winning!

2
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:19,083
[AOI]
We hit the jackpot.

3
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:22,250
[chuckles]

4
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:24,666
[HARUKA]
Hi there. I'm Haruka Sakurada.

5
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,916
I'm 14 years old and second son
of the Sakurada Royal Family.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,333
I have eight siblings.

7
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:33,291
Four older sisters
and an older brother,

8
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:35,750
plus two younger sisters
and a younger brother.

9
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:37,916
And we all have special powers.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,750
Yeah. Life is interesting.

11
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:19,333
[AKANE] I didn't know dad bought
a private beach for us to use.

12
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:21,125
He wanted to make sure
we could all relax

13
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,916
in total privacy
on our vacation.

14
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,875
So there's no cameras either.

15
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:27,208
[AKANE] There's nothing
but ocean out there.

16
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:30,875
Your Transporter must go
even further than I thought.

17
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:33,791
It's been a while since
all of us got out like this.

18
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:34,875
[HIKARI]
Hey!

19
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:36,750
Wanna play "split
the watermelon"?

20
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,666
[AKANE]
You bet!

21
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,583
[HIKARI] It was my idea
so I'm should go first!

22
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:42,041
[SHIORI]
Split it? Won't that hurt?

23
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:44,083
[TERU] Don't worry,
Shiori, I'll make it quick!

24
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:47,541
[HARUKA] Eight percent for Teru.
Two percent for Hikari.

25
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:51,083
Five percent for Misaki.
Shu's at one percent.

26
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:55,291
Looks like Akane's around
ten. Aoi's also at one.

27
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,791
And Shiori's rockin' 80%.

28
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:04,416
This is Lots of Next.
It's my special power.

29
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,083
[KANADE]
What numbers are you crunching?

30
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:07,875
Who will split the melon first.

31
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,333
Huh?

32
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:12,125
[HARUKA]
Kanade has a 50% shot, huh?

33
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:13,125
[gasps]

34
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:15,083
[KANADE]
Shiori's really that high?

35
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:16,250
[HARUKA]
Yup.

36
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:18,708
Well, it's just a chance,
not an absolute,

37
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,083
so I guess we'll
see what happens.

38
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,583
[yelling]

39
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,625
[TERU]
Oh, you dodged me, huh? Not bad.

40
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,791
But let's see you
survive my grand slam!

41
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,750
Nice.

42
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,125
I can't even split
a stupid watermelon?

43
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:37,041
If this crap keeps up, there's
no way I'll become a real man!

44
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,541
Geez. Chill, Teru.
It's just a game.

45
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:40,750
[HIKARI]
Gotcha!

46
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:44,541
Whoopsy-daisy.
Looks like I missed it!

47
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:47,375
Tone down the idol act. You
don't have an audience out here.

48
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:50,958
Mr. Matsuoka said I should
practice every waking moment.

49
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:51,791
Next.

50
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:54,083
[yells]

51
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,958
That... was close.

52
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,708
Show it whose boss, Akane!

53
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,916
[AKANE]
Uh, sure!

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,125
[HIKARI]
It's right in front of you!

55
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,125
She's lying! It's to your right!

56
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:12,208
[AKANE]
Which way is right again?

57
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:13,416
Swing now and you've got it!

58
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,166
Aw! She went right passed it!

59
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,333
To your left now!

60
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:19,750
This is way too confusing.
Is it over here?

61
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:22,333
Yes!

62
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:23,166
[grunts]

63
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,250
Darn it! You were so close!

64
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,416
[SHU] This is even
harder than it looks.

65
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,750
[SHIORI]
You can do it, Big Sister.

66
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:34,833
So close and yet so far.

67
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:38,250
Oh. I see what's going on.

68
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:42,375
[KANADE] The two of them missed
on purpose so Shiori could win.

69
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,041
Sorry, short stuff.

70
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:47,916
I love you, but I can't let
Haruka's prediction come true.

71
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:57,250
[HARUKA] She's getting serious
about this. I can feel it.

72
00:04:58,416 --> 00:04:59,125
In front of you!

73
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,375
It's to the right!

74
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,416
[HIKARI]
No, keep going forward!

75
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,750
[TERU]
Go to the right!

76
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:06,083
[HARUKA] Kanade's not even
listening to the others.

77
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,791
She has a purpose.

78
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:11,250
Not to mention a 50-50 shot
at splitting the melon first.

79
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,125
This could be really bad.

80
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,250
Shiori's supposed
to be the winner.

81
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:19,000
She has the highest
chance of all!

82
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:22,333
Oh no. Her distance
and angle are perfect!

83
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:23,958
Here comes the moment of truth.

84
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,583
[yells]

85
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:26,250
[KANADE]
No way.

86
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,000
[HARUKA]
Yes.

87
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:31,583
You're tougher than you
look, I'll give you that.

88
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:32,916
It's your turn, Shiori.

89
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,291
You got this.

90
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,958
If you can't do it,
we'll start over.

91
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:37,916
[TERU]
It's dead ahead.

92
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,375
C'mon, give it a good whack!

93
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,625
[AKANE] That's it!
Keep going straight ahead!

94
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,125
[MISAKI]
You can do it!

95
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,208
[HARUKA]
She's got this in the bag.

96
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:47,666
Then again,

97
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,708
Kanade gave it her all and
the melon didn't even crack.

98
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,833
Is Shiori strong
enough to split it?

99
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,291
No, don't go there.

100
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:57,166
I need to believe in my power!

101
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,041
[WATERMELON]
Halt, villain!

102
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:03,375
Thou shalt not reach my juicy
center without a fight, knave!

103
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,875
Try if thou darest!
Have at thee!

104
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:08,625
[SHIORI] I don't wanna
hit you, Mr. Watermelon.

105
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:12,750
[WATERMELON] Uh! Doth this mean
thou feel-eth pity for me?

106
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,500
Truly, child?

107
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:19,208
[SHIORI] I do. It's not nice
to hurt someone. I hate it.

108
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:20,375
Swing, Shiori!

109
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:21,708
It's right where you want it!

110
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:24,958
[SHIORI]
I can't. I don't want to.

111
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,708
[WATERMELON]
Tis fine, little one.

112
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,166
Thou art the first soul

113
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,416
who hath ever shown me
true kindness and respect.

114
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,041
For that, I am deeply grateful.

115
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,083
Now, giveth me a good thunk!

116
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:37,958
[SHIORI]
I can't.

117
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,375
[WATERMELON]
Ye must.

118
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:42,750
For there is no other way
to reach my deliciousness.

119
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:45,041
[SHIORI]
Mr. Watermelon.

120
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:51,166
[WATERMELON]
Farewell. I am glad that we met.

121
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,416
[HARUKA]
No!

122
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,541
Looks like we're starting over.

123
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,250
She did it!

124
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,000
[HARUKA]
Eat it!

125
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,708
[AKANE]
Split perfectly?

126
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,500
I'm sorry.

127
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:06,875
[WATERMELON]
Don't be!

128
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:10,458
For I do not regret a single
slice of life. Huzzah!

129
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:14,250
[HIKARI] Akane! Let's play
some more volleyball!

130
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,250
'Kay!

131
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,958
You can run around all you like,

132
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,916
but make sure you don't
go past the fence line.

133
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,416
It's for your safety.

134
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,125
Is there some kinda animal
out there, or something?

135
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:27,416
[SHU] No. Just don't
go past it, all right?

136
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,458
[MISAKI]
Hey! Who were you passing to?

137
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,083
Akane, go get it!

138
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,291
[AKANE]
You bet!

139
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,833
Leave it to me and my
patented super jump!

140
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,208
Hey! What did I just tell you?

141
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,458
It's going faster
than I thought.

142
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:40,125
[SHU] No, Akane! Stop!
Don't go past the fence!

143
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:42,333
It's okay, there's nothing!

144
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,250
[HARUKA]
Nailed it.

145
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:56,666
Whoa. What is this?

146
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,833
[SHU] I was hoping
you wouldn't find out.

147
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,458
[AKANE]
Huh?

148
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:03,833
[SHU] We're not actually
on a tropical island.

149
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:07,833
It's a prefabricated set
in the middle of an empty lot.

150
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,333
Not cool!

151
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:10,666
[SHU]
Did you guys honestly think

152
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,208
the guards would let us
get that far out of sight?

153
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,875
You big dumb jerk!

154
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,583
If you're going to trick us, at
least put some effort into it!

155
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,750
You know you messed up
when Hikari gets angry,

156
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,375
and to be honest with you,
I'm right there with her.

157
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,041
[SHU]
Don't worry. It's not all fake.

158
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,041
The sand and water are real.

159
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,291
Oh, that's okay then.

160
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,000
He's only saying that
to make you feel better!

161
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,583
[AKANE] You didn't have to
go to all this trouble, Shu.

162
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,708
Really. I'm not shy
when I'm having fun.

163
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,208
[SHU]
Oh, my bad.

164
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,416
I was afraid you might
be stressed out.

165
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,208
Nah. But you're sweet.

166
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:42,958
[thudding]

167
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,416
[MISAKI] Wow, this is
pretty sturdy stuff.

168
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,166
[HIKARI] Don't they use
these things on game shows?

169
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,333
[TERU]
It looks so real.

170
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,125
Yeah, it felt real, too.

171
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:53,458
[TERU]
Yeah.

172
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:54,125
[MISAKI gasps]

173
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,500
[AKANE]
Huh?

174
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:56,875
[SHU]
Uhh...

175
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:02,500
[ONLOOKERS mummbling, gasping]

176
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,875
[screaming]

177
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:18,083
[AKANE screaming]

178
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,541
I wish Shu would think
things through sometimes.

179
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,166
[HARUKA]
What? No way!

180
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,250
[AKANE]
Uh?

181
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:38,500
[HARUKA]
Wow. There's this many already?

182
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:41,375
Ugh. There're even more here.

183
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,083
[HARUKA]
I better get started.

184
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,333
[gasps]

185
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:50,125
[HARUKA] Misaki, I told
you to knock before--

186
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,166
[BOTH screaming]

187
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,666
Akane, how long were you there?

188
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,083
Uh. A couple of seconds, maybe?

189
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:57,833
[HARUKA]
Tell me.

190
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,083
[AKANE]
Huh?

191
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,833
[HARUKA]
Did you see?

192
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,333
Um. See what?

193
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:03,750
[HARUKA]
You did!

194
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,833
[HARUKA]
Of course she'd walk in now.

195
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,625
Darn it! What should I tell her?

196
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:11,541
I'm sorry, Haruka.
I guess you're busy, huh?

197
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,875
Lots of pictures to
look at. Maybe I--

198
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:17,083
Back up. Did you even knock?

199
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,375
You know what I think of people

200
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,750
who don't respect
other's privacy.

201
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:21,791
I forgot!

202
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:22,666
[HARUKA]
Got her!

203
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,291
Hey, are you trying to trick me?

204
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,541
[HARUKA]
Fine. I'll tell you.

205
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:28,875
'Kay.

206
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,500
That wasn't you.

207
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,125
It was your doppelgänger.

208
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,791
I've been tracking it
down so I can slay it.

209
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,041
[AKANE]
Like I'd believe that crap!

210
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,000
Why won't he tell
me the truth?

211
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:42,791
I mean, it was only a picture,
right? What is he hiding?

212
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,291
[HARUKA]
Oh, Akane.

213
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,791
[AKANE]
Stop it, Haruka!

214
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,500
That's wrong on so many levels!
We're brother and sister.

215
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:51,041
And, even if we weren't, this
would still be a problem.

216
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,958
I mean, it's not that I
don't like you or anything,

217
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,500
but it's all so sudden.

218
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,916
What would our family think?
What would the country think?

219
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,166
It's not like that.

220
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,375
No reading my mind
without permission!

221
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,375
Now you respect privacy?

222
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:05,708
Relax. I was just watching
your body language.

223
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:09,000
Okay, out with it. Is there
a reason you can't tell me?

224
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,708
Does anyone else
know about this?

225
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:13,083
[HARUKA]
Yes to both, actually.

226
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,166
Hey, Misaki, guess what?

227
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,458
[HARUKA]
Okay, okay! Hold on!

228
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,291
Look, nobody else
knows, all right?

229
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,666
I can't tell anyone,
no matter who they are.

230
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,500
Trust me, it's nothing you
need to worry about at all.

231
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,250
In fact, if you could forget
this ever happened,

232
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,875
that would be great.

233
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,791
Would you please put that away?

234
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:29,875
[HARUKA]
If Misaki finds out,

235
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:33,583
she'll blab about
it to everybody!

236
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,750
Should I go ahead and spill it?

237
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,750
No, that would defeat
the purpose entirely.

238
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:39,750
Your time's up.

239
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:40,666
[HARUKA]
Let me say one more thing!

240
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,958
Give me all the juicy details!

241
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,333
[HARUKA screaming]

242
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:44,791
If you buy me some
pudding from the shop

243
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,000
next to the train station,

244
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,916
I'll take you to any
amusement park you want!

245
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,041
For real?

246
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,541
Back in a flash!

247
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,666
[HARUKA]
Okay, fine, I'll tell you.

248
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,916
You're almost never online,

249
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,208
so I figured you didn't
know about this.

250
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:00,833
There are all kinds
of fan websites

251
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:03,583
dedicated to our family.

252
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,416
I've been flagging all
of the uploaded pictures

253
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,583
of you for deletion, but it's
hard to keep up sometimes.

254
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:10,833
And that means?

255
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:13,000
[HARUKA]
This'll take a while.

256
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,500
You know what a website is?

257
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:17,541
Well, fan sites are made
to discuss specific topics.

258
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,333
In this case, the
topic is our family,

259
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:21,083
and it's loaded
with pictures of us.

260
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,916
People share the pics
and videos they like

261
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,416
and chat about all
of us ad nauseam.

262
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,375
It's considered entertainment,
so it's perfectly legal.

263
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:31,041
But I know how embarrassed
you get, so I kept it from you

264
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,041
and got rid of everything
that I could find.

265
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,083
[AKANE]
What are they saying about me?

266
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,791
[HARUKA]
Um, nothing really.

267
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:39,458
"She's adorable" or
"I like how shy she is"

268
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,250
or "I didn't see it."

269
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:44,208
"I didn't see it"?
What do they--?

270
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,583
[screaming]

271
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,250
[HARUKA] If you didn't
keep losing your skirt,

272
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,833
this wouldn't happen.

273
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:53,791
[AKANE] I'm never leaving the
house again! Stupid internet!

274
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,208
[HARUKA] Welcome back.
I'm glad you're still with me.

275
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,875
Now, shall we continue?

276
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,625
Next, I'll be talking about
my twin sister, Misaki.

277
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:09,833
Okay. What's my
schedule for today?

278
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:14,083
Baseball club, soccer club,
cooking club, tea ceremony club,

279
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:17,416
subbing in for the drama club,
and modeling for the art club.

280
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,666
[sighs]

281
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,291
They never take a break,
do they? Even in summer.

282
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:25,625
[MISAKI]
Time to work!

283
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,333
[CLONES]
Got it!

284
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,083
[HARUKA]
This is Misaki's special power.

285
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:30,750
It's called All for One.

286
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:34,041
It allows her to create up
to seven clones of herself.

287
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,625
[MISAKI] All right.
What do I have lined up?

288
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:39,708
Interview for the school
newspaper's next column piece.

289
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:42,500
"The Sakarada Family's
Six Royal Beauties."

290
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:43,791
Hmm.

291
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,416
I'm so sorry, Misaki,

292
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,750
but I said I would lend a hand
to the student council today.

293
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,833
You've handled these before.
Why fix what isn't broken?

294
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:53,875
I can't just sit in front of
strangers and talk about myself!

295
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,250
Please take care of
this for me, Misaki!

296
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,625
[sighs]

297
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,416
No choice. Let's do this thing.

298
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,791
Buh-bye!

299
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,625
I can't forgive you, Cinderella.

300
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,333
Bam!

301
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:14,875
[OPPONENT]
Lost again.

302
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,708
[BUBU]
Yummy noms.

303
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,375
I hope you enjoy it.

304
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,833
[RAIO]
'Scuse me while I rock this!

305
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:30,291
[MISAKI] Aoi and Kanade
are great at home.

306
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:33,791
They're like the perfect older
sisters. Strong and reliable.

307
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,333
Akane is energetic and
tons of fun to be around.

308
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:37,833
She really sets the mood.

309
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,041
[INTERVIEWER]
Wonderful.

310
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,208
Now, your older sisters
are pretty popular.

311
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,375
What do you think sets you
apart from the three of them?

312
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:44,416
[INARI]
Misaki!

313
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,666
[CLONES]
I finished helping the club!

314
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,250
Great job, guys.

315
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,333
[HARUKA] Each clone
represents a different part

316
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:54,000
of Misaki's personality.

317
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,000
They also have their
own special talents,

318
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:59,041
which make them good additions
to the various clubs at school.

319
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,708
[CLONES chattering]

320
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:02,333
[INTERVIEWER]
Hey!

321
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:03,750
What a snore fest.

322
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,041
Why don't you try asking
some entertaining questions?

323
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,791
Will you give that
back, already?

324
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,500
I can think of at
least a dozen zingers

325
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:10,958
right off the top of my head.

326
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,791
Like, "What color is
Misaki's underwear?"

327
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,583
You can keep that
stuff to yourself!

328
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,916
Haruka! I'm ready
to go home, are you?

329
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,416
I'm kind of busy.

330
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,833
I'll be here for a bit,
so don't wait up for me.

331
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:26,416
Yeah, right. There's
no need to be shy.

332
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,833
I know you were waiting
with baited breath.

333
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,666
C'mon, let's get
moving, silly-billy.

334
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,291
You can read with your
fake glasses on at home.

335
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,708
You wouldn't believe
the day I've had.

336
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:38,333
Misaki! Bubu was
a great help today.

337
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,750
Send her anytime.
We'd love to have her.

338
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,166
'Kay! See ya!

339
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,125
Oh, Misaki. Yuniko was awesome.

340
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,750
She hit a grand slam in
the bottom of the ninth.

341
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,666
Could she play again
with us next week?

342
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,291
Hold on, I'll check.

343
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,625
Yup.

344
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,708
She's totally free to play
whenever you need her.

345
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,458
You can use her all you like.

346
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:00,125
You're kind of like your
clones' manager, aren't you?

347
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,250
[yelps]

348
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:05,375
Well, I don't have any special
talents of my own, so, y'know.

349
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,000
[PLAYER C]
Thanks for earlier, Misaki.

350
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,875
Raio's kick is out
of this world.

351
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,416
She was the star
of the game today.

352
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,875
Sure. It's no biggie,
I'm glad she could help out.

353
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:16,541
[chuckles] You're so modest.

354
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,583
Now that I think of it,
your clones have helped

355
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,708
almost every club in
school, haven't they?

356
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:24,125
Huh? Yeah. They all
have been pretty busy.

357
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:27,250
It kinda feels like the only
one with any free time is me.

358
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,416
[PLAYER B] Between your clones
and your older sisters,

359
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,708
I bet it's like being in a
school full of superheroes.

360
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,791
It goes to show how much we can
rely on the Sakurada family.

361
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,541
Yeah, I guess so.

362
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,708
You carry our school
on your shoulders.

363
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,666
It's a good thing you
have eight pairs of them.

364
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,083
[MISAKI chuckles nervously]

365
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,583
[MISAKI]
See you tomorrow.

366
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,375
[HARUKA]
It's not just the school.

367
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:50,083
The country's future is
also your burden to bear.

368
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,458
[MISAKI]
We're home.

369
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:52,958
[AKANE]
Oh, welcome back!

370
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:56,166
Perfect timing!
Mr. Mashima is coming by.

371
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,625
Could you do the interview?

372
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:58,833
Another one?

373
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,333
Yeah.

374
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:02,708
Aoi and Kanade aren't home,
and you know how I can get.

375
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:03,750
Please?

376
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:06,291
Sure. No problem.

377
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:12,833
Man, I'm just an
interviewing machine today.

378
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:15,125
It's like the only thing
I'm good for is yammering on

379
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,833
about how freakin' amazing
my older sisters are.

380
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:21,708
I'm so sick and tired of being
pushed into these things!

381
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,708
[HARUKA]
Talk about a 180.

382
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,625
Did you drag me here
so you could vent

383
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,208
or was there another reason?

384
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,875
[MISAKI] You're supposed to be
there for me! You're my twin!

385
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,791
[PLAYER C] Between your clones
and your older sisters,

386
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,333
I bet it's like being in a
school full of superheroes.

387
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,000
[INTERVIEWER] Your older
sisters are pretty popular.

388
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,583
What do you think sets
you apart from them?

389
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,333
[PLAYER A] You're kind of like
your clones' manager,

390
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:41,375
aren't you?

391
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:42,625
[MISAKI]
My clones are always praised

392
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:45,041
and everyone wants to
know about my sisters.

393
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:48,000
I might as well be their
shadow or invisible.

394
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:51,750
People are so insensitive!

395
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:54,791
You agree with me,
right, Haruka?

396
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,875
Ugh! Fine, don't listen to me!

397
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:59,583
Keep your stupid eyes glued
to your stupid books!

398
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:02,083
[HARUKA]
Yep. People are insensitive.

399
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,875
[MISAKI]
I don't need you for this.

400
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:07,291
I've got my clones.
They'll be my punching bags.

401
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:16,750
[HARUKA] She can't be serious.
She's gonna yell at herself?

402
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,416
More ball? I'm game!

403
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,916
No way, there's
too much sweating.

404
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,583
We could play shogi, then!

405
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,541
[RAIO] That's all you
ever want to play.

406
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:27,083
[MISAKI] Quiet! All of you!
It's my turn to talk!

407
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,125
[CLONES]
Huh?

408
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,333
[MISAKI]
Where the heck is Bubu?

409
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:34,375
Everyone, sit! I didn't
bring you out to socialize!

410
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,583
I'm gonna vent and
you're gonna listen, okay?

411
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,291
You know, if you had
any kind of pride,

412
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:41,666
you wouldn't have to resort to
ranting at yourself like this.

413
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,166
It's probably some
first world problem.

414
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,375
It must be nice, huh?

415
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,458
[SHAURA] Come on, let's all
relax and cuddle for a while.

416
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:51,875
Whoa, would ya quit
being so creepy?

417
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:52,750
Ugh!

418
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,583
Forget it! I'm done with you.

419
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,083
Do whatever you want.
I don't even care anymore.

420
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,375
Calm down, hun.

421
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,916
I'm sitting, now, so
there's no need to fuss.

422
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,666
Have you been skipping meals?

423
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,250
Want some?

424
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,250
[MISAKI] Shut up! You have no
idea what it's like to be me!

425
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,708
Everyone adores you!

426
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:10,625
Meanwhile, I'm a useless,
no talent, clone factory!

427
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,875
Huh? The heck are
you talking about?

428
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:15,500
They were practically
lining up to praise you.

429
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,833
[MISAKI]
No, that's not true!

430
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:19,250
They were stopping me
to praise all of you!

431
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:22,208
It's like I'm nothing but
an extra, don't you get it?

432
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:23,500
[MISAKI cries]

433
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,750
[knocking]

434
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,541
He's here! Thanks for
doing this, it means a lot.

435
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,666
[MISAKI]
I'm not.

436
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,500
Great! Then, I'll
just be in my roo--

437
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:35,958
[AKANE screams]

438
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,000
You're rebelling now?

439
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,958
[YUNIKO]
I always feel sorry for Akane.

440
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:44,500
[MISAKI] They're not
interested in me. You go do it.

441
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,000
No way! I can't!

442
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,416
You're much better
at this than me!

443
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,875
Don't worry, it'll be okay.

444
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:51,583
I'll help you get through
it this time, no problem.

445
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,125
[AKANE]
But--

446
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,458
[SHAURA] Let's go. We don't
want to keep him waiting, do we?

447
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:55,791
[AKANE]
Hold on!

448
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,291
[MISAKI]
It's no use.

449
00:19:57,375 --> 00:20:00,708
My clones can even handle
interviews better than I can.

450
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:03,458
I guess I really am their
manager, after all.

451
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:04,791
Ugh, okay.

452
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,916
I know you're feeling down,
but you'll be fine.

453
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,833
[MISAKI] Sorry. It wasn't
fair to complain.

454
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:12,541
It's just that everything
about me is below average:

455
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:15,458
grades, sports, looks, fashion.

456
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,708
I should expect this by now.

457
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,041
But I couldn't help feeling
jealous of you guys

458
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:23,208
and my sisters. It all
comes easy to you.

459
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:25,291
It's fine, I don't care anymore.

460
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,625
Besides, it's not like
special people like you

461
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:30,541
would understand a
regular Joe like me.

462
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,291
[CLONES] Like a normal
person could create

463
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,791
clones of themselves.

464
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,500
I don't get you, Misaki.

465
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:39,791
You keep saying you feel
like a useless extra...

466
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,500
...but we're all a part of you.

467
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:44,250
Without you, we
would be nothing.

468
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,083
[HARUKA]
It's okay to be normal.

469
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:51,916
I mean. I'm surrounded by
weirdness on a daily basis.

470
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,458
But you?

471
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:57,250
You're the one dose of normal
that I can always count on.

472
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:00,541
If you suddenly stopped
being yourself...

473
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:02,583
...I don't know what I'd do.

474
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:08,791
You're far from being a
useless shadow, okay? In fact--

475
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,708
Misaki! Help!

476
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:14,875
This one's a disaster! She just
keeps flirting with Mr. Mashima!

477
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,708
You're the only one I can trust!

478
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:19,208
You know how to socialize,
you're objective about everyone,

479
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,750
and you're not a total perv!

480
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,208
There's no one else
who can do this...

481
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:25,416
[HARUKA] In fact,
you're perfect as you are.

482
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,750
Haru.

483
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,291
I was having so much fun,
but Akane stopped me.

484
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:30,458
Do you wanna play?

485
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:31,958
Why did I think you
could handle this?

486
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,000
You're the worst choice of all!

487
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:35,500
I don't know why
you're so angry.

488
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:38,000
I just did what I thought you
would do in the situation.

489
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,791
Yeah, right, you
obviously don't know me!

490
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:43,291
Fine. I can take it from here.

491
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,875
I swear, you guys are
hopeless without me around.

492
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,541
You're my hero!

493
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:50,083
[MISAKI] Come here.
Play time's officially over.

494
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,166
Oh, well.

495
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,416
That goes for the
rest of you, too!

496
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:57,458
[MISAKI]
Darn it, Bubu!

497
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,833
All right, I'll be back.

498
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,166
I knew she'd be okay.

499
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,791
I'm glad I was here to
watch out for her though.

500
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,375
[HARUKA]
Misaki, you missed another one!

501
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:10,583
Morning.

502
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:12,333
[HARUKA] Get going!
The others already left!

503
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:16,333
[HARUKA]
Yep. Life sure is interesting.

504
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:49,875
[MISAKI] I'm the fourth
daughter, Misaki Sakurada!

505
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:51,750
[SATSUKI]
Misaki tends to be overshadowed

506
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:53,166
by her unique siblings.

507
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,125
But she's always been
a wonderfully caring

508
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:56,583
and considerate young lady.

509
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:58,750
[MISAKI] You're the only one
who really gets me, Momma!

510
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:01,333
[SATSUKI] As king, she would
be empathetic to her people,

511
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:03,500
and would work hard to
take good care of them.

512
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:05,416
Do you have a campaign
promise, sweetie?

513
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,625
[MISAKI]
I'd allow normal people

514
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:09,125
to enjoy living in a
normal country, I guess.

515
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:10,833
By the way, the king
I look up to most

516
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,541
is Justinian the I of
the Byzantine Empire.

517
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:16,666
Let's have a clean election.
See you next time.
